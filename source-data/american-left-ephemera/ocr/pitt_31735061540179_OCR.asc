In other words, the Truman Administration was bowing to the
wishes of the U.S. oil trusts and the Pentagon, which had their
own ﬁsh to fry in Middle Eastern ﬁres.

While Britain was actively aiding the aggressors and Wash-
ington sought’ to‘ hamstring their victim, who was it that came
to Israel’s aid?

It was socialist Russia, whose initiative had made possible the
passage of the original UN resolution, together with its allies. They
stood ﬁrmly by Israel’s side and insisted that the UN back up its
decision.

And it was Czechoslovakia—the same Czechoslovakia which
today is being viliﬁed by the big money press an-d radio——that came
to Israel’s rescue by providing the weapons of victory.

Arms from Czechoslovakia were a major factor in Israel’s tri-
umph. I was there at the time and know what a difference those
arms made. The conﬂict of imperialist interests between the United
States and Britain was another factor. But what proved decisive
was the great political, moral and military aid of the socialist
countries to Israel’s gallant struggle, plus the force of American
public opinion, particularly effective in an election year.

Though Israel won its liberation war against British imperialism
and its Arab mercenaries, today Wall Street and Washington are

\ the real rulers of that country.

Direct private United States investments in Israel leaped from
$2,000,000 in 1948 to $63,000,000 in 1954—a 31-fold increase in six
years! Israel Digest, published by the Israel Office of Information
in New York, boasts (January 7, 1955) that “except for a number
of highly industrialized countries and areas rich in natural re-
sources, Israel is among the world’s leading centers of attraction
for new United States private investment capital.”

Israel’s new-born oil industry is Israeli in name only. Of eight
oil companies that hold concessions covering one-half of Israel’s
territory, seven are U.S.-controlled and the eighth is Canadian.

The Israel government has gone out of its way to offer special
inducements to foreign investors and has accorded them tax exemp-
tion and other privileges that give them advantages over Israeli capi-
talists. All this is being justified on the ground that it is necessary
for Israel’s development. However, what is chiefly being developed
are fat proﬁts that are funneled out of the country, low living
standards for the people of Israel and a lopsided economy domi-
nated by American big business.

, Besides direct investments, hundreds of millions of dollars in
U.S. government credits and grants have been given under condi-
tions which make Washington the real boss of the Israel econ-
omy. Additional hundreds of millions, raised through the sale
of Israel bonds and through voluntary contributions, could be of
great help in developing the country’s economic life were it not
for the fact that these funds are controlled by the same U.S. big
business interests that have investments in Israel and use this “aid”
to impose submission to Washington.

Israel has thus become a province in Wall Street’s Middle East
economic empire. And the dollars from America, instead of putting
Israel on its feet, have put it on its knees. This is true politically
as well as economically.

VVhat vWall Street and Washington want of Israel—besides fat
pr0ﬁts—is no mystery. Said Rep. Joseph Martin, ]r., House GOP
leader, in a statement in 1951 on a bill to grant Israel $150,000,000:

“The young army of Israel, with more than 200,000 men and
women, is one of the strongest forces for the survival of freedom
in the Near East. By word and deed the young state of Israel has
demonstrated its willingness to stand ﬁrmly and resolutely against
the forces‘ of tyranny and despotism. It can be an outpost of Ameri-
can strength and inﬂuence in the Middle East.”

Unfortunately, the government of Israel, instead of striving for
real independence, has become largely an instrument of our State
Department. It was only with the greatest reluctance and under
massive pressure from their own people and the peoples of the
world that the Palestine Zionist leaders took up the independence
struggle in 1947-1948. But for them this merely meant switching
masters, andthey lost no time in transferring their allegiance from
London to Washington.

Despite the fact that the Soviet Union and its allies had been
Israel’s staunchest friends in the liberation war, Prime Minister
Ben-Gurion and Foreign Minister Sharett adopted Washington’s
cold-war line.

At the moment when new winds of neutralism and indepen-
dence were beginning to blow in Asia, Africa and the Middle East,
Sharett in a speech to the Knesset (parliament) on November 4,
1951, dropped the last shreds of pretended neutrality in the East-
West conﬂict and openly made a bid for inclusion in a Middle
East war alliance, a “little NATO.”

As part of its subservience to Washington the Israel delegation
to the United Nations has repeatedly backed the colonial powers

11

  

against their rebellious peoples. Whereas even such reactionary
U.S. puppet regimes as that of Guatemala voted in the Fall, .1955,
session of the UN General Assembly to place on the agenda the
issues of Cyprus, Algeria and West New Guinea, the people of
Israel had to endure the shame of seeing their own delegation-
taking its cue from Washington—support the British, French and
Dutch imperialists.

This policy has widened the gulf between Israel and the increas-
ingly neutralist Arab states, all of whom, except Iraq, have refused
to join the military alliance sponsored by Washington. This mis-
guided policy has also had the effect of undermining Israel’s
security by isolating it from most of the nations ' of Asia, Africa

and the Middle East—more , than half the world’s population. It’

was the very opposite policy, temporarily imposed on the leaders
by popular pressure, that made possible Israel’s birth and victori-
ous independence struggle.

THE ARAB STATES

In launching their armed assault on Israel, the governments of
the Arab states served, not Arab interests but British imperialist
interests. Indirectly they also served American imperialist aims.
Washington was quite ready to help boot Britain out of all or
part of Palestine provided the door was left open for it to walk in
and take over. This is exactly what happened.

What is often overlooked is that the war against Israel was
directed not only at the independence struggle of the ]ewish people
of Palestine, but at the national liberation movements of the Arab
countries as well. And while the Arab rulers failed in their effort
to crush Israel, they succeeded in strangling in the womb the in-
dependent democratic Arab state that was to have been established
in the rest of Palestine and economically joined to Israel. Instead, the
Arab nation in that sector of Palestine, without being consulted,
was annexed by Jordan. Which meant annexed by Britain, since
the government of Jordan was created and ﬁnanced and its Arab
Legion subsidized by London.

What’s more: by their war against Israel the Arab ruling classes
shortcircuited the anti—imperialist national liberation movement in.
the other Arab countries. A case in point is Iraq. In January, 1948,
tremendous protest "demonstrations against a new military pact
with Britain, which the Iraq Prime Minister had just signed, com-

12

pelled the Regent of that British semi-colony to repudiate the
agreement and forced the Prime Minister to. resign and ﬂee for
his life.

But the Palestine conﬂict was already brewing. Through chau-
vinist propaganda and incitement against Israel, London’s stooges
in Baghdad succeeded in pulling the teeth of the anti-British protest
movement.

After the armistice agreements ended the war against Israel in
1949, the policy of the Arab governments toward the Western
powers developed in two stages. In the ﬁrst stage, the Arab regimes
eagerly sought military and economic “aid” from foreign imperial-
ism and supported the Washington-London cold-war objectives
in the Middle East and throughout the world. Most of the Arab
governments indicated their readiness to join, together with Turke
and Iran, a so—called Middle East defense pact or “little NATO,”
directed at the Soviet Union and at the anti-imperialist strivings of
the masses of the Middle Eastern countries.

The Arab regimes placed one major condition on their joining
a “little NATO”-that Israel be excluded.

Strange as it may seem, the government of Israel, newly liber-
ated with the help of the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia, pursued
a policy parallel to that of its deadliest enemies. In fact, Israel and
the Arab states vied with each other for Washington’s favors, each
side insisting that it could provide better guarantees for the “free
world” against “Communist subversion” and “Soviet aggression."

A However, on the rock of the implacable enmity of the Arab *
governments toward Israel the plan for an all-inclusive Middle

East “defense” pact foundered.

When the Eisenhower Administration took oflice, Secretary of
State Dulles began an ardent courtship of the Arab governments,
dangling before them such glamorous hardware as planes, tanks and
guns. He proposed moving toward a “little NATO” in piecemeal
fashion by means of a series of bilateral treaties.

In this way he linked up at the Soviet border Iraq, Turkey,
Pakistan, Britain and Iran. The idea was that the other Arab
countries would ‘soon ﬁnd this armed-to-the-teeth fraternal order
irresistible and would join up.

But Dulles made a slight miscalculation: he failed to take into
account the great social tides that were sweeping Asia and Africa.
The policy of the Arab governments had in various ways and to
varying degrees entered a second stage. The Arab countries had
become part of that great movement of colonial, semi-colonial and

13

  

ex-colonial peoples toward freedom and the determination of their
own destiny. Both inside and outside the UN, this is a movement
away from subservience to imperialism and toward greater inde-
pendence in relations with the Western powers; away from identi-
ﬁcation with war policies and war blocs and toward neutralism and
peace.

Among the Arab governments this trend is most pronounced
in Egypt and Syria, especially the former. In Egypt, which has
compelled the British to end in 1956 their 74-year military occupa-
tion of the Suez Canal zone, the trend is intimately linked with
internal developments: the mass anti-British demonstrations in
January 1952; the guerrilla warfare against the British occupation
forces in the Suez Canal zone; and the oflicers’ revolt in July 1952,
which ousted King Farouk, abolished the monarchy, initiated
limited agrarian reform, undertook a program of econo-mic develop-
ment and began to further trade relations with the socialist
countries.

A recent outstanding expression of this anti—imperialist and
neutralist trend in the Arab countries were the great protest demon-
strations in Jordan, beginning in December 1955, against the British
effort to force that country into the Baghdad Pact. These demon-
strations, which were also directed at the United States and Turkey,
were all the more signiﬁcant in View of the fact that they occurred
in one of the most backward of the Arab countries an-d the one
that previously had been most completely controlled by Western
imperialism.

The historic Band-ung conference of 29 Asian and African na-
tions in April 1955 marked a new high expression of unity in this
vast movement of more than half the world’s population toward
national freedom and peace. And Bandung helped cement new
close ties between the Arab states and such great Asian powers
as the Chinese People’s Republic, India, Indonesia and Burma.

These positive developments in the external relations of most
of the Arab states are organically linked with the internal demo-
cratic struggle against a semi-feudal economic setup, a struggle
which reflects the growth of capitalism and an industrial working
class. However, at this stage the political leadership of the struggle
is of a contradictory type, with capitalist elements interwoven with
reactionary semi-feudal influences. Nevertheless, under pressure
of the mass movement and of international developments, the posi-
tive trends more and more hold sway.

The decisive test of a colonial liberation movement or a govern-

si-

ment of a semi~colonial country is: what course is it pursuing in
relation to foreign imperialism and its oppressive, war-instigating
policies? With this as the touchstone we ﬁnd that history chooses
varied and at times “illogical” instruments to achieve progressive
social change. In Iran the nationalization of the British-owned oil
industry was carried through under the leadership of a wealthy
landowner, Mossadegh. In Morocco the symbol of the struggle
against French colonial rule is a sultan. In Egypt the liberation
of the country from British occupation and the turn toward a policy
of growing neutralism and independence from all imperialist domi-
nation is being carried through by a group of professional army
officers headed by Col. Gamal Abdel Nasser. But in all three
cases it is the masses and the rising class of industrial capitalists
that provide the spur.

On the other hand, the reactionary war against Israel in 1948
was directed by a British government headed by men who called
themselves “Socialists.” And the Israeli government that today
leans so heavily on U.S. imperialism is also led by men who call
themselves “Socialists.”

Since the Egyptian government is capitalist—as is the govern-
ment of Israel—its policies are not consistent, and it is also subjected
to pressure from pro-imperialist elements. There is no doubt, for
example, that in the increasingly neutralist policy of mo-st of the
Arab governments there is a serious contradiction: their attitude
toward Israel. Their refusal to make peace or enter into direct
negotiations is a reactionary vestige of the past that is in conflict

« with the growing tendency toward neutralism and anti—imperialism.

In the case of Egypt and Syria, this positive trend is undoubtedly
now the main. emphasis in international affairs.

Expanding economic and political relations with the socialist
countries and the active presence of the Soviet Union in the JMiddle
East can help resolve this contradiction and further peace between
Israel and its Arab neighbors.

ISRAELI GOVERNMENT POLICY

One would ‘think that the government of Israel would welcome
the growing neutralism of the Arab states—-that is, their resistance
to imperialist pressures which caused them to make war against
Israel in 1948 and to contin-u.e maintaining a posture of hostility.
In this connection it is worth recalling that shortly after the present
Egyptian regime took power, Ben-Gurion, speaking in the Knesset

15

 
   

on August 18, 1952, praised the new rulers and greeted their state-
ment that they had opposed the invasion of Israel in 1948.

However, it seems that it was all a case of mistaken political
identity. The Israeli premier thought that the new Egyptian govern-
ment, which was anti-British, would play ball with Washington.
Ben-Curion and Washington were speedily disillusioned. Wrote
Dana Adams Schmidt in a dispatch from Tel Aviv (New York
Times, February 23, 1953): “Israeli officials are convinced that
Egypt and the other Arab states still are wedded to neutralism be-
tween East and West and can be brought into‘ the Western camp——
if at all——only by a ‘dynamic policy’ on the part of the United States
and the West in general.”

It is as part of such a “dynamic policy”—a policy to combat
Egg/pt’s and Syria’s neut-ralism—that Washington has secretly incited
Israel against its neighbors, while seeking to prevent Israel from
going beyond the point where the State Department could control
the situation. It is this Eisenhower-Dulles “dynamic policy” that
has intensiﬁed the danger to the peace of Israel and the whole
Middle East.

Unfortunately, instr-uments of that policy have not been lack-
ing within Israel itself. In fact, subservience to Washington has
given free rein to advocacy of “preventive war” against that Arab

state—Egypt——which has shown the greatest resistance to U.S. A

imperialism. This is all the more ominous in view of the fact that
it is precisely the Egyptian government which in recent months
softened its attitude toward Israel.

Wrote Kennett Love in a Cairo dispatch to the New York Times A

of October 9, 1955:

“Colonel Nasser [Egyptian premier] went so far this week as
to make the statement . . . that the Arabs no longer want to destroy
Israel. Earlier he showed an unorthodox lack of hostility by lifting
boycott restrictions to permit a two-way exchange of assignments
for the New York Times correspondents in Israel and Egypt. . . .

“Five weeks ago Colonel Nasser forbade the Army to strike
back into Israel after the humiliating defeat at Khan Yunis.”

The Times correspondent concludes: “These straws blown against
the prevailing wind are indications that Colonel Nasser himself is
unwilling to see a realization of the West’s and Israel’s fears.”

The “preventive war” advocates in Israel are not limited to
the fascist party, Herut, now Israel’s second largest political party.
These advocates may also be found among the leadership of the
dominant Mapai (Right-wing labor Zionist party), the General

Zionists (party of big capitalists), Achdut Avoda (“Left” labor
Zionist party) and other groups.

Ben-Gurion himself is, as C. L. Sulzberger p-ut it (Times, Nov.
2, 1955), “an old extremist.” On November 2, 1955, only a few hours
after Ben-Gurion as premier-designate proposed peace talks with
the Arab states, the Israel army launched in the El Auja dernili-
tarized zone the bloodiest ﬁghting since the liberation war—a
strange way to further peace. 9

Soon Ben-Gurion struck again, this time against Syria on De-
cember 11. In that operation—ordered by the premier without con-
sulting his cabinet—56 Syrians and six Israelis were killed. The
attack on Syria evoked much criticism within Israel itself and
caused the inﬂuential Tel Aviv daily, Haaretz, to ask whether it

« was not out of all proportion to the hostile Syrian action for which

it was supposed to retaliate.

Americans who want Israel to live and grow and stand on its
own feet cannot but look with alarm at tactics that have nothing to
do with Israel’s security and invite disaster. Such acts and “pre-
ventive war” talk are no less grist to the imperialist mill than simi-
lar acts and talk in some of the Arab states.

And the tragic consequences of ‘the Israeli goVernment’s made~
in-Washington foreign policy became evident when the attack on
Syria came up for discussion in the UN Security Council. Israel
proved to be completely isolated. For the third time in two years
the Security Council unanimously condemned Israel for acts of
aggression.

From all this, it becomes clear that, as the pro-Zionist, bitterly
anti-Communist Philadelphia Jewish Exponent put it (October 7,
1955): “Nothing co'u1d more nauseatingly point up the hypocrisy
of the Western nations than their caterwauling plea to the Soviets
‘not to encourage an armament race between the Arab countries
and Israel.’ This, despite both England and America’s obstinate
refusal . '. . to alter their policies of supplying munitions to the
Arab states! Both VVashington and London have been maddeningly
guilty of fanning the ﬁres of the cruel and punishing conflict that
burns in the Middle East.”

On the other hand, paradoxical as it may seem, Czechoslovak
arms are in this case bearers of peace. The arms transaction with
Egypt represents a move by the socialist countries to strengthen
neutralism and counter the U.S.-British effort to build a military
bloc that threatens peace—Israel’s peace as well as Russia’s.

A signiﬁcant admission on this point has come from an unex-

17

  

pected source. The Tel Aviv Hebrew daily, Haboker, organ of the
Right—wing General Zionist party, declared on September 30, 1955:

“Soviet diplomacy cannot ignore the fact that the Turkey-Iraq-
Britain-Pakistan pact, which the U.S. will soon join, presents a
serious danger to‘ the peoples of the Soviet Union. The states adher-
ing to the Baghdad pact and those which will join it at a later
stage will receive arms from America. Why, then, is it wrong for
the Soviet Union to send arms to Egypt, which is opposed to any
military pact in whatever form? . . .

“As for Israel, Moscow intends no harm to it. The Soviet Union
sends arms not to Israel’s enemy but to the state which carries
forward a struggle against the Baghdad pact, which is directed
against the Soviet Union. If the present situation indirectly brings
bad effects for Israel, Israel itself is responsible.

“Didn’t Sharett declare in the Knesset on June 1 that he is trying
to conclude a military pact with the United States? And he is doing
this in spite of his clear commitments in his letter to Molotov.”
(This refers to the letter of july 6, 1953, in which Sharett pledged
that “Israel will not be a member of any kind of union or agree-
ment which pursues aggressive aims against the Soviet Union.”)

For Egypt, the exchange of cotton and rice for Czechoslovak
arms is part of its effort to expand trade relations with the socialist
countries in order to buttress both national independence and a
neutralist course in international affairs. Whose fault is it if Israel’s

government follows the opposite policy? Did not a spokesman for '

the Israel Embassy in Washington hasten to‘ reject the idea of pur-
chasing arms from the socialist bloc and insist that his government
would continue to be completely dependent on the Western powers
in this respect? And has not Israel’s government, in its eagerness
to please Washington, from the outset seriously restricted trade with
the socialist countries to the detriment of the Israel economy?

A case in point is oil. Cut off from Middle Eastern oil, Israel’s
government has imported U.S.-controlled oil from Venezuela at a
high price. Not till 1954 did it begin to purchase limited amounts
from the Soviet Union in exchange for citrus fruit and bananas.
The May 10, 1955, issue of Davar, inﬂuential Tel Aviv daily, esti-
mated that Israel could have saved $10,000,000 a year by purchas-
ing Soviet oil from the outset. Whose fault is it if Israel’s govern-
ment—in deference to Washington—chose to squander this money?
And why has a Soviet offer of technical assistance been gathering
dust in the Israel Foreign Ministry for many months?

In Israel itself there is considerable support for a different for-

eign policy. In the elections to the Knesset in July, 1955, three left-
wing parties—Achd=ut Avoda, Mapam and the Communist——whose
platforms urged a change in the direction of neutralism and peace,
received 20 percent of the vote. In national campaigns conducted
by the Israeli peace movement a much higher proportion-—nearly
one-half the adult population—has signed petitions supporting
peace and foreign policy proposals at variance with the govern-
ment’s course. A

The internationally known Israeli Zionist leader, Yitzchak Green-
baum, Minister of the Interior in the ﬁrst Israel government, in an
article in the October 7, 1955 issue of Letste N aies, Tel Aviv Yiddish
paper, criticized the Israel government’s “abandonment of the path
of neutrality toward East and West and its identiﬁcation with the
West.” “Can anyone doubt,” he asked, “that our loyalty to the
United States brings us nothing but trouble?”

The editor of Letste Naies, M. Tsanin (who is also the Israel
correspondent of one of the most rabidly anti-Communist and anti-
Soviet papers in the United States, the Iewish Daily Forward), in a
biting editorial in the November 21 issue, pointed out that Israel
began life with the friendship of 33 countries and the Ben Gurion-
Sharett leadership had succeeded in losing them all.

It is time for a new look at the Israel-Arab conflict. The old
methods, the old approaches have been tried and found badly want-
ing. Bo-th the Eisenhower-Dulles and the Eden policies, which are
primarily responsible for the present situation, have proved bank-
rupt. It is time for all peace-minded Americans, whatever differ-
ences they may have on other questions, to get together on the com-
mon meeting ground of what’s good for America and Israel.

Is more arms for Israel the answer? Is more arms for the Arab
states the answer?

Israel, like every non—aggressor country, is entitled to arms for
self-defense and to get them wherever it wishes. Secretary Dwulles’
carrot-and-club tactic of withholding arms from Israel is designed
to put the squeeze on that country—-just as earlier, the same tactic
sought to put the squeeze on E'gypt—-in order to compel the Ben—
Gurion regime to come across. This is conﬁrmed by the well-
informed Alsop brothers, who reported ‘(New York H erald-Tribune,
December 30) that when Sharett came to this country and pleaded
with Dulles for $50,000,000 of arms for Israel, the U.S. Secretary of
State demanded territorial concessions of such a nature that Sharett,
according to the Alsops, “furiously replied that apparently Dulles
wanted to destroy Israel.” 19

The British government has been even franker in its efforts to
dismember Israel. In an interview in the N. Y. Times of November
26, 1955, Premier Ben-Gurion, commenting on proposals made
earlier that month by Prime Minister Eden, charged that Britain
wants the Negev area——more than half Israel’s territory—to be given
to Jordan. “He felt,” wrote the Times, “that the motive was to ﬁnd
a large secure base for the British Middle East forces.”

In the face of these imperialist proposals and pressures from
both Washington and London, can Israel’s security be safeguarded,
as both the Israel government and American Zionist leaders insist,
by a “security” pact with the United States? Would not such a
pact deliver Israel even more completely into Washingto-n’s hands
and involve it in a military alliance against the only great power
that has no designs on its territory or anything else—the Soviet
Union? '

Even worse for Israel is the counsel of those in our country
who urge for the Middle East a policy similar to what Senators
McCarthy and Knowland advocate for the Far East: the stepping
up of aggressive military alliances, a Big Stick against national
liberation movements and the conversion of Israel into a second
Formosa under U.S. military occupation. Rarely has this view been
expressed more brazenly than in a letter in the Times of November
5, 1955, by Harry Torczyner, chairman of the Commission on Israel
and the Middle East of the Zionist Organization of America.

The fact that this flagrantly anti-American, anti-Israel letter
was not repudiated by Zionist leaders ought to arouse the concern
of all who have the welfare of America and Israel at heart.

Torczyner admits that the Czechoslovak arms deliveries to Egypt
“are n0't directed against Israel but, in the ﬁnal analysis, against
the Western grand alliance.” This is precisely what infuriates him.
He writes:

“This is the time for the direct presence of the United States in
the area surrounding the Suez Canal. The harbors, the airﬁelds, the
roads, the factories, the wherewithal of an arsenal for democracy
in the Middle East are available in Israel.”

_ An-d Torczyner urges a U.S.-Israel military pact, not in the name
of Israel’s defense against the Arab states but of “defense” against
“Soviet penetration” of the Middle East and Africa. What is actually
meant is a pact against the capitali.st—led national liberation move-
ments.

Such a policy would make a shambles of the promise of Geneva
and would lead our country as well as Israel to disaster.

Fortunately, there are more sober voices being raised even
among those who have supported the cold war. Dr. Israel Goldstein,
president of the American Jewish Congress, has urged a Big Four
guarantee to Israel and the Arab states against “aggression from
any source.” (Times, November 3). The October 31, 1955, issue of
Congress lVeekly, organ of the American ]ewish Congress, made
a similar proposal.

Clearly, what is required is a new approach to the Israel-Arab
conflict and the problems of the Middle East. The great need is
for joint efforts by the United States, the Soviet Union, Britain and
France to end the arms race in the Middle East and bring about
direct negotiations between Israel and the Arab states, possibly
under the sponsorship 0-f the UN. This means action in the spirit of
the Geneva heads of government conference.

Hugh Gaitskell, leader of the British Labor Party, has publicly
demanded that the Soviet Union be asked to “join in discussions
to safeguard peace between Israel and the Arab states.” (N. Y.
Times, ]an. 25, 1956.) Earlier, during the Geneva foreign ministers’
conference, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov indicated his gov-
ernment’s readiness to participate in four-power efforts at a settle.-
ment. The average American must be wondering: if the great
powers can get together to condemn Israel for an act of aggression,
as they did at the UN on January 19, why can’t they get together
to help end a situation which breeds aggression and threatens
peace?

Yes, why do Dulles and Eden persist in refusing to join with
the Soviet Union in such discussions? Is it because the oil trusts
are against it? Is it because the cold-war generals are against it?

The failure of Israel’s government to sfpeak up for such discus-
sions shows what a heavy price it pays or its one—sided, ruinous
foreign policy. Here too a change would contribute greatly to
Israel’s security and peace. The greatest ]ew of our time, that
great American and world citizen, Albert Einstein, shortly before
his death wrote words of wisdom that point the way out of Israel’s
dilemma. In a letter in january 1955 to Zvi Lurie, a leader of the
Mapam party, he summed up his views on Israel’s policy as follows:

“First: Neutrality regarding the East-West conﬂict. Through
such a position we (Israel) will be able to contribute our modest
portion to softening the antagonisms in the great world, and also
to make easier the achievement of good neighborly relations with

the Arab people and their governments.”
21

 

He went on to urge’ as his second point “equal rights in
every respect” for the Arab citizens of Israel.

This is a two-point program which every peace-minded, demo-
cratic American can endorse. But besides endorsing it we ought to
insist that American big business and its Cadillac Cabinet end
the pressure which has converted Israel into a U.S. satellite and a
pawn in the cold war.

Along what lines can a settlement between Israel and the Arab
states be achieved? The two most important issues in dispute are
territorial boundaries and the Arab refugees. The Israel govern-
ment has properly refused to make the drastic territorial conces-
sions demanded of her by Washington and London. Whatever
boundary revisions are ﬁnally, worked out, they must not lead to
the dismemberment of Israel.

In regard to the refugees, the Israel government is on less solid
ground. Those refugees who formerly lived in the territory now
constituting the state of Israel have a legal and moral right to
return if they wish. The Israel government’s discriminatory treat-
ment of its Arab minority, its seizure of the property of refugees
and its refusal to admit more than a token number 'eopard1'zes
Israel’s security much more than any threat from an alfeged “ﬁfth
column” among the refugees. However, not all the 900,000 refugees-
assuming this ﬁgure to be accurate—formerly lived in the territory
of Israel or are children of former residents. The actual number
entitled to return if they wish is probably no more than half
that ﬁgure.

Whether it ‘would be practicable for all bona-ﬁde refugees who
wish to return to do so is not certain. Admittedly the refugee
problem is a knotty one and there is no sim le solution for the
tragic plight of hundreds of thousands of home ess Arabs. The Ihud
Association, founded by the late Dr. Judah L. Magnes, ﬁrst president
of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, has recently made con-
structive proposals for sending a UN commission to Israel and the
refugee camps to draw up a plan for the return of those for whom
this would be feasible. Any solution would also have to include
resettlement of those who do not return and payment by Israel,
with international aid, for pro erty losses suffered by the refugees.
Meanwhile, relief for the refugees, who are supported by UN
funds, should be increased.

The precise details of the settlement of this and other questions
would have to be worked out by both parties in the course of
negotiations—negotiations, as a spokesman of the Israeli Embassy
‘ 22

in London put it (N. Y. Times, ]an. 21, 1956), “in a spirit of give
and take, on the basis of compromise and mutually agreed con-
cessions.

After the passage of so many years of bitter conﬂict it is clear
that such negotiations—whether with or without UN sponsorship,
with or without the direct participation of the great powers-
cannot be achieved without the cooperation of those powers. And
a settlement, to be lasting, requires measures to end the cold war
in the Middle East, which has fed the Israel-Arab conflict. As the
New York Herald Tribune pointed out (]an. 31, 1956): “The
Arab-Israeli conflict is simply the most critical of a number of
clashes involving the position of the United States and Britain in
the Middle East.” The paper cited “riots in Jordan against pro-
Western policies and in Cyprus against the British, smoldering
discontent between Turkey and Greece, Saudi Arabia’s dispute
with Britain "over the Buraimi Oasis.”

The H erald Tribune failed to mentio-n the greatest source of
mischief: the U.S.-British cold war with its attendant armaments,
military pacts and intrigues. The building of peaceful coexistence

‘between Israel and the Arab states requires concrete measures

toward abating the cold war and advancing peaceful coexistence
between the capitalist and socialist systems. ‘

Secretary Dulles has intimated that the Israel-Arab conﬂict
ought to be kept out of domestic politics. But the American people
have no interest in sweeping under the rug issues that vitally
affect their peace and welfare. The Israel-Arab conﬁict is such an
issue.

In the 1956 campaign, regardless of differences on other points,
tens of millions should unite to demand an end of the Dulles-Eden
squeeze on Israel. Let us insist that the Cadillac Cabinet release its
grip on the economy and government of Israel. Let us join with
Senator Herbert Lehman in urging a large-scale program of eco-
nomic aid for both Israel and the Arab states—adding that this
program must be without economic, political, military or territorial
strings attached.

Above all, it is time to make it plain to the Eisenhower Adminis-
tration that our own national interests urgently require an approach
to _the Middle East, no_t along the lines of a “little NATO,” but of
a “little Geneva.”

Which Way Israel?

By A. B. MAGIL

Exploding headlines tell of border ﬁghting between Israel and
Egypt, between Israel and Syria. Headlines snarl charges and
counter-charges between Jerusalem, Cairo, Damascus. Headlines
shriek about Czechoslovak arms shipments to Egypt, about a So-
viet “threat” to the Middle East.

What’s it all about?

The news out of the Middle East in recent months has ﬁlled
with alarm millions of Americans, Jewish and non-]ewish, who are
deeply concerned about the dangers that beset the young state of
Israel. They see in Israel a tiny beleaguered country which only
a few years ago won its independence in a stubborn heroic struggle.
It seems as if the land in which so many survivors of the Nazi gas-
ovens found refuge is constantly being pushed to the brink of new
annihilation. v

Democratic Americans have a big stake in Israel’s welfare. Our
support helped forge victory in the liberation struggle of 1948-49
when powerful forces in Wall Street and Washington sought to
betray it. Many of us have contributed dollars and pennies in the
hope of advancing the development and national independence of
Israel. The American people also have a vital stake in the well-
being and peace of all the nations in the Middle East.

VVhen I was in Israel in 1948, people used to say, speaking of
the difficulties of life in that country and the barrenness of the
soil: “VVhen Moses was leading the children of Israel out of the
wilderness, why did he have to stop here? Why couldn’t he have
gone a little farther—say, to California?”

Israel’s misfortune lies, however, not in the fact that Moses-
who was fated to gaze at the Promised Land only from afar—stopped
there, but that many centuries later the oil trusts—-including those
from California—did, The poverty-stricken lands of the Middle
East, the area in which Israel is located, are rich in oil. In fact, the
Middle East is the world’s greatest oil gusher. Three-quarters of the
known oil reserves of the capitalist world are there, or more than

3

 
 

twice as much as in the United States, Canada, Britain, France and
Italy combined.

And all of it is controlled by American, British, Dutch and
French corporations, with the lion’s share in the hands of the Ameri-
cans—-Standard Oil of New ]ersey, Standard Oil of California, So-
cony Vacuum, Texas Company, Gulf Oil, and the American Inde-
pendent Oil Co.

Until recently it had been thought that Israel’s soil was indeed
barren as far as oil was concerned. But on September 22, 1955,
oil in substantial amounts and of excellent quality was struck at
Heletz in the Negev region, nine miles from the Egyptian-controlled
Gaza strip. This produced quite a boom on the New York Stock
Exchange in the stocks of the oil companies operating in Israel-
U.S.-dorninated companies of course.

The oil of the Middle East could be a blessing for the peoples
of that area were it used to promote their well-being instead of
the proﬁts of Wall Street and London investors. Under present
conditions the politics of oil, 'oined with the politics of cold war and
preparations for hot war, is t e curse of Israel, as of the Arab states
and non-Arab Iran, Turkey and Pakistan.

Oil was chieﬂy responsible for net proﬁts of $413,000,000 in
1954 for American corporations from their Middle East investments.
But in addition to these economic attractions, the Middle East has
great strategic importance. It is the land bridge between Europe,
Asia and Africa. It controls communications by land, sea and air
that bind the world together. It embraces the Suez Canal and the
Eastern Mediterranean. And it borders directly on the southern
ﬂank of the Soviet Union.

Clearly, whatever happens in the Middle East, there’s more
than meets the eye. To understand the Israel-Arab conﬂict or. the
meaning of the Czechoslo'vak arms shipment or the demonstra-
tions in Jordan against the Baghdad Pact, we have to look behind
the headlines.

And we also have to make a distinction between peoples
and governments. Especially must we make a distinction between
the American people and the Cadillac Cabinet that is our govern-
ment.

The problems involved in the Israel-Arab conflict are‘ complex
and there aren’t any easy answers. But if we take as our starting-
point what’s really good for Israel, even though our government
may be against it and Israel’s government may be against it, we
will begin to ﬁnd an approach to the constructive solution of these

problems. To do this, the speciﬁc Arab-Israel developments must
be seen in relation to the larger struggles that are shaping the
Middle East and the world. ,

Today the Middle East is an arena of ﬁerce conflict between the
American and British oil trusts and their governments for domina-
tion of this fabulously proﬁtable and strategically vital region.
Since World War II the U.S. has been steadily pushing the British
back, replacing Britain as the dominant power in Iran, Saudi Arabia
and Israel, and even invading such formerly exclusive London do-
mains as Iraq and ]ordan.

However, Washington and London are not only rivals but part-
ners in the Middle East, as elsewhere-—partners in keeping the
Middle East safe for exploitation by the oil trusts, partners in
suppressing the peoples of the Middle East and their movements
for democracy and freedom. Above all, partners in pursuing ag-
gressive cold-war and hot-war objectives. Ever since the end of the
Palestine ﬁghting in 1949, the American and British governments
have been straining all efforts to convert the Middle East into a
gigantic military base and to dragoon the Arab states and Israel,
as well as Turkey, Iran and Pakistan, into a “little NATO.”

We are told that all this is for “defense” against “Soviet aggres-
sion.” One of the best answers to that is contained in a remarkable
map of the Middle East and Northern Africa published in the
New York Times of October 16, 1955. Also shown on the map
are the southern part of the Soviet Union as far east as the Afghani-
stan border, and Europe south of a line that passes through Ger-
many and Poland. What is remarkable about the map are the US,
British and Soviet bases marked on it. '

From the map we learn that there are in the countries of the
iMiddle East» eight U.S. and British bases. Of these, ﬁve are in
Turkey and Iraq, members of the Washington-sponsored “northern
tier” alliance—nucleus of a Middle East “little NATO”; one is in
Cyprus, colony of another “northern tier” member, Britain. In
addition, nearby are the British bases in Malta and Crete and
seven other U.S. and British bases in North Africa. Three of the
latter are in Libya, next door to Egypt, and all are within easy
striking distance of Russia. This is not to mention the numerous
U.S. bases in Spain, Britain, France, West Germany, etc., all of
which are far closer to the Soviet Union and its allies than they
are to the United States.

What about the Soviet bases? The map shows not a single one
outside the territory of the Soviet Union. No-t one in the Middle

East, not one in the countries of people’s democracy which our big
business press calls “satellites.” In fact, in the whole vast stretch
of Soviet territory shown on the map (no-t the whole of the U.S.S.R.
by any me-ans, but a sizeable chunk of it), there are only two bases.
These are on the northern shore of the Black Sea, where the So-
viet ports of Odessa and Sevastopo'l are located. In other words, not
a single Russian base is located on territory that borders any of
the Middle Eastern countries.

For that matter, a map of foreign investments in the Middle
East would show pretty much the same thing. Do'llars and pounds
by the ton are being pumped out of the Middle Eastern countries,
but there isn’t a single Russian ruble invested in or extracted from
any of them. A

WHO THREATENS WHOM? ‘

Who then threatens whom in the Middle East? And who is
stirring up war and who is seeking peace?

The answers are basic for understanding the Israel—Arab conflict.
They are no less basic for determining where Israel’s true interests
lie and how its security may be safeguarded.

The fact is that it is not the exchange of Egyptian cotton and
rice for Czechoslovak arms that has sharpened tensions in the Mid-
dle East, but Washington’s and London’s cold-war policy and their
action—in the midst of the Geneva four-power, negotiations—in
pointing a gun at the Soviet Union by means of the “northern tier”
military alliance of Britain, Turkey, Iraq, Pakistan and Iran, the so-
called Baghdad Pact.

Suppose Russia sponsored a military alliance of Mexico, Guate-
mala, Honduras and Nicaragua. And suppose Czechoslovakia also
joined this military alliance. And suppose that Soviet and Czech
bases were established in several of these countries. Then what?
Would the United States he expected to pretend that this was simp-
ly a game of charades and do nothing? Clearly the Soviet Union
and its allies do not intend sitting on their hands while Dulles
builds a time-bomb at the Soviet border.

But it is not only against the Soviet Union that the reactionary
U.S.-British policy is directed. It is also directed against Israel. It is
designed to suppress the efforts of all the peoples of the Middle East
and North Africa to throw the foreign proﬁteers off their backs,
to achieve full national independence, to cease being used in impe-

 

 

rialist-generated cold-war alarms and hot-war tempests. And the
old imperialist tactic of divide and rule has been employed time
after time, with disastrous effects on the national liberation strug-
gles of the Middle Eastern peoples.

The Israel-Arab conﬂict does not stem from any “natural” hatred
of ]ews and Arabs for each other. It is in fact a product of foreign
imperialism. Before the British took over Palestine after World
War 1, Jews had lived there as well as in other Middle Eastern
countries for centuries without serious friction with their Arab
neighbors.

It was the British imperialists who “invented” the Arab-]ewish
conflict in Palestine during the twenties and thirties. It was the
British imperialists who instigated, armed and ﬁnanced the war of
the Arab states against Israel in 1948-49. And today it is the Ameri-
can and British imperialists who keep the pot of hatred boiling,
inciting both sides against each other in order to weaken and
impose their will on both.

Who is responsible for the arms race in the Middle East? It
was Washington which, in August, 1949, pressured the United Na-
tions Security Council into lifting its embargo on arms shipments
to the Middle East. This touched off the arms race between Israel
and the Arab states. I

In 1950 the U.S., Britain and France issued a joint declaration
under which they. began to control and limit the ﬂow of arms to
both sides. What this meant was that arms were converted into
a lever for exacting economic and political concessions from both
Arabs and Israelis. Washington, London and Paris sold arms to
both sides and withheld arms from both sides in pursuance of their
reactionary war-inciting objectives. And the controls imposed by
the western powers, instead of ending the arms race, had the op-
posite effect, with Israel and the Arab states “straining their econo-
mies to buy arms wherever they could.” (Dana Adams Schmidt,
New York Times, October 2, 1955.)

One thing is clear: neither Czechoslovakia nor Russia nor any
other socialist country had anything to do with starting or stimu-
lating this arms race.

And who decided that the time had come fo-r Egypt to get a
large supply of arms? Dana Adams Schmidt reported in the Times
of October 15:

“Going back to the origins of the current Middle Eastern crisis,
the diplomats disclosed that the "arms the United States had agreed
in principle to sell Egypt last June [1955] were valued at $27,000,-

. 7

  

000. Since the U.S. had sold only about $1,000,000 worth of arms
each to Israel and to Egypt since 1952, the size of the order aston-
ished some United States officials.”

But there were strings attached to this “agreement in principle.”
The Eisenhower Administration demanded cash. This was, how-
ever, merely a mask for something else. As far back as August 11,
1953, a Cairo dispatch to the New York Times reported:

“But with no domestic armaments industry, with British de-
liveries halted and with United States aid unavailable so long as
the Egyptian government is unwilling to enter into formal defense
arrangements with the West, this country [Egypt] is on the verge
of equipping its growing forces with arms from the other side of
the Iron Curtain.” (My emphasis—A.B.M.)

Egypt actually waited two years before turning to Czecho-
slovakia. There it obtained not only arms (minus strings), but a
market for its most important export, cotton. Washington had tried
to bribe Egypt into abandoning its neutralist course and joining
an aggressive war bloc. The bribe turned into a boomerang.

Suppose Egypt had turned, instead, to Switzerland or Sweden.
Would this have rated more than a few lines in the press? Would
Dulles and Eden have stormed and fumed? Would the leaders of
Israel’s government have denounced Switzerland or Sweden, as
they have Czechoslovakia and the Soviet Union? Would American
Zionist leaders have hired even a two-by-four hall for a protest
meeting, let alone Madison Square Garden where on November
16 they organized a cold-war vendetta in the name of “defense”
of Israel?

The fact is that both the United States and Britain have been
supplying arms, respectively, to Iraq and Egypt, while denying
them to Israel, and no hullaballoo has been raised here or in Israel.
And remember, Iraq is the most anti-Israel of all the Arab states-
the only one that has refused to sign an armistice with Israel.

Wrote Robert S. Allen in his syndicated Washington column
(N. Y. Post, ]an. 23, 1956): “The Arabs have gotten more British
tanks and other ﬁghting equipment in the last few months than
from Communist Czechoslovakia.”

To top this off, came the revelation, on February 16, that
while the State Department was banning arms to Israel on the
hypocritical pretext that it wished to avoid intensifying the arms
race, it was secretly about to ship 18 tanks to Saudi Arabia.

After a temporary halt because of protest a green light was given
for the tank shipment. '

Clearly, arms to Egypt is not the issue. It is the source of the
arms that has caused certain people in Washington, New York,
London, Paris and ]erusalem to cry havoc. What bothers them is
that the Western imperialist arms monopoly in the Middle East
has been broken, that the U. S.-British political stranglehold is
being loosened, that the socialist policy of peace and support of
all peoples ﬁghting for national liberation is in danger of converting
“little NATO” into a “paper tiger.” V

And what also bothers the imperialists and their satellites is
that certain Arab states, especially Egypt, are refusing to be
vassals of the cold warriors, refusing to sell their sovereignty for
a mess of U. S. planes and tanks. As Dana Adams Schmidt re-
ported in the New York Times of October 2, 1955, Washington
oflicials “consider the arms contracts with the Communists annoy-
ing and potentially dangerous aﬁirmations of Egyptian indepen-
ence and neutralist inclination.” (My emphasis-—A.B.M.)

ROLE OF U.S. GOVERNMENT

Israel’s birth was made possible by a small respite in the cold
war. On November 29, 1947, both the United States and the So-
viet Union voted in favor of the United Nations resolution which
provided for the creation in Palestine of two independent demo-
cratic states, one ]ewish and the other Arab. The weight of the
agreement of the two principal world powers produced the neces-
sary two-thirds majority.

However, Washington’s favorable vote had come after much
backing and ﬁlling. It was followed by strenuous efforts to sabotage
the UN resolution and prevent Palestine ]ewry from implementing
their part of it. Testimony to Washington’s true role has come
from an authoritative source: jorge Garcia-Granados, Guatemalan
representative to the UN and member of the UN Special Committee
on Palestine. In his book, The Birth of Israel, Garcia-Granados
described the frantic but unsuccessful efforts of Washington ofﬁ-
cials to nullify the UN resolution and place Palestine under a
UN trusteeship.

According to Carcia—Cranados: “In a number of private talks
at Lake Success, New York, and Washington, representatives of
the United States State Department exerted the strongest possible
pressure on Jewish leaders in an effort to persuade them not to
proclaim a state.”
