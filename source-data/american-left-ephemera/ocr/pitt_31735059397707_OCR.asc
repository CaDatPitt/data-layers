Racism is a corrupt manifest-
ation of injustice perpetrated by
individuals concerned‘ only for
their own end or maintainance of
the Status Quo.

Any man ﬁho can take money’
from its members and give them
nothing in return is concerned ab-
Also inorder to

his opposition hw must sell his
members a bad contract;
is concerned about his own end.

I'm describing the Gigantic Monster 1

the U.A.W. (Unite All White)
I wonder if the United all

Whites (UAW) forgot about their
Black workers last week in their
letter. I read it twice but I co-

. u1dn't find anything in there ab- 5

out Jr. Brookins. You remember

him, he's

thought he had a stick of dynamite
in his lunch. After the fight he
was charged with felonious assault
This happened in September of 1967
so, I'm sure the grievance is at
the International step NOW! But I
didn't recall reading about him in
that letter.; OH That's rightlll,

' after he was found innocent the

UAW pulled his grievance. He's
still in thelstreet.

While reading that paper I
recall them (racist) talking about
pitting- Blacks against whites.’
well, my Union dues and credit un-
ion deposits are still in two li-
lly-white Banks and that UAW says
DRUM'S pitting Blacks against, May
be we are fools - HOW!!! Skilled
trades are still lilly-white; Reu-

ther made a deal with Hahn Conyers l

he again ‘

the Black brother that j
was fired because two Honky Guards,

‘in the name of the white liberals;

George Morrellii told DRUM that

racism does not exist in Hamtramck;

Charlie Brooks under pressure ad-
mitted it did exist; Former Vice-
President_HHH told the Black Unit-
ed Caucus, The Committee of Inqu-
iry that Walter Reuther was hand-
vling his Civil Rights program; (no
wonder he lost!) The Metropolitan

Housing Council says Reuther
against low-income Housing; (for:
low-income Blacks and whites and,
mzuws p1cc1ng271????)
FUCK._THE. U.A.W.

P.S. I don't recall them saying
that ‘DRUM could withdraw and
will stop our Union Dues.‘
