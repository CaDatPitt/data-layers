ing dramatic increases over the same period in the
banner year of 1966, the 1967 round of negotiations in
the industry is now underway.

THE MINE-MILL UNION

 

xx. '9-.-_ fr -5?

May. mi  ,

“Big Four” Can Meet Unions’ Demands,
Mine-Mill Research Material Indicates

The rosy 1966 profit figures of the major U. S. nonferrous metals producers, reported in the last issue of the
Mine-Mill Union, are no flash in the pan. Instead, all indic atlons are for the continued prosperity of the industry in

the foreseeable future.

These are a few of the basic conclusions to be found in “Facts for Bargaining—1967”—four special pamphlets
on the “Big Four” copper companies, prepared by the Mine-Mill Research Department for distribution to union
bargaining committee members.

Designed primarily for those USWA and Mine-Mill negotiators who soon will be sitting down at the bargaining
table with representatives of Kennecott, Anaconda, _AS&R, and Phelps Dodge, the concise booklets pack in a wealth

of information for anyone with
an interest in the industry. The

' often complicated fin a n c i a 1

standings of the companies are
translated into terms making
more sense to the average work-
er.

Anaconda. AS&R Hit Highs

For example, company profits,
which for both AS&R and Ana-
conda hitirecord highs in 1966,
are broken down in terms of
profit per employee. How much
are these giant corporations
dragging in for the output pro-
duced by an average worker in
an hour or in a year?

Here are those figures for the
“Big Four” in 1966—in each
ease up substantially over the
-previous few years: AS&R’s
gross profit per worker last
year totaled $7,461, which
amounts to almost $3.75 per
hour; for Anaconda, it was $5,-
828 or nearly $3.00 an hour;
Kennecott, $10,583 or about $5.00
per hour worked by every one
of its 24,812 employees; Phelps
Dodge, $9,065 or close to $4.50
per hour.

In most cases, these figures
are close to or better than dou-
ble the profit per worker in
1964, when the most recent con-
tracts were negotiated.

With production per worker
continuing to rise and with
prices of most nonferrous metals
either climbing or holding
steady, the huge proﬁt gains
are not surprising. Where does
that money go?

Executive Salaries

For one thing, it provides
handsome salaries and other
forms of compensation to cop-
per company executives. Rob-
ert G. Page, for example, the
president of the Phelps Dodge
Corporation, received in 1965
salary and fees of $151,200 plus
additional compensation of $30,-
000 for.a total of $181,200. His
annual pension upon retirement
at age 65 will be $44,865. Addi-
tionally, he has received $148,-
785 since Jan. 1, 1953 from a
-profit sharing plan.

“Facts for Bargaining—1967”
list similar information on other
executives of PD and the other
nonferrous metals companies.

Of course, shareholders in
these companies, too, are the
beneficiaries of booming profits.
Last year, Thomson and Mc-
Kinnon, a New York stock
,brokerage firm in the heart of
the ﬁnancial district, issued a
report on PD, recommending
purchase of its stock as a good
investment. Noting the com-
pany’s expansion into the alumi-
num fabricating field as well_
as - additional copper fabricating
units now under construction,
the report also pointed to PD's
low, copper production costs-—an
average of 20 cents per pound.
A comparison of this cost with
the present price of the metal-
33 Cents Per pound—shows why
this company, and others in_the
industry, _are racking up the

 tremendous profits‘ they are;

Qllﬂqok‘ for: Anaconda 

 /‘ Another ipromirrenyt _sto_ck

broker with headquarters on

-Wall Street, Blythe and Com-

pany, issued a glowing fore-
cast on 1967 and future pros-
pects for Anaconda-a company
whose sales and other income
last year went over the billion
dollar markfor the first time,
to t a 1 i n g $1,234,640,000. The
broker’s report on the company
said that a number of factors
should benefit Anaconda’s sales
and earnings this year—one of
them being an expected in-
crease in the company’s produc-
tive capacity by about 10 per-
cent in 1967 alone.

Indicating that a further rise
in the price of copper to the
40-42 cents per pound level is a
distinct possibility, Blythe and
Company concludes, “It is our
judgment that Anaconda is in
a favorable position to absorb
actual apd prospective rises in
labor ciists and a domestic
corporate tax increase without
impairment of its earning pow-
er.”

The “Facts for Bargaining”
pamphlets, too, focus on the
continuing expansion by the non-
ferrous metals giants. Kenne-
cott Copper, for example, which
always has had its major source
of income from copper produc-
tion, last year became a full
ﬂedged lead producer as well,

when its Tintic Division brought-

the Burgin mine in Utah into

.full production. The Burgin is

considered one of the richest
lead-zinc mines in the country.

production next year. Mining
engineers figure that the ore
from this and other new lead
mines in that state is rich
enough to produce lead profit-
ably even if the price of the
metal, now 14 cents per pound,
were to drop below 91/2 cents
per pound.

American Smelting and Refin-
ing, which recorded record
profits in 1966, also paid an all-
time high in cash dividends to
its common stock holders-$36;
058,000, which was more than
the company’s total yearly net
profit for the years 1957 through
1963.

Production of the company’s
three major nonferrous metals-
copper, lead, and zinc-has
grown steadily since 1963, in-
creasing from that year to 1966
by 20 percent, 9.3 percent, and
18.3 percent respectively._-

Cadmium Output in Denver

Additionally, with cadmium
prices currently about two-
thirds higher than in 1962, the
company’s Globe refinery in
Denver, which for years has
been refining the metal from
lead and zinc ﬂue dust, now is
contributing to AS&R’s gross
profits about $3 million per
year, based on a conservatively
estimated production of 3 mil-
lion pounds. That’s about $30,000
per employee at the Denver
plant, which also is the site of

the successful intallation last

year of a facility for the recov-
ery of indium, a by-product that
previously was lost.

Only a very few of the high-
lights of “Facts for Bargaining”
have been mentioned -here. But
from them alone, it is obvious

u

 

that union negotiators will be
sitting down at the bargaining
table in 1967 holding more am-
munition than they’ve had in
many years.

PITTSBURGH, Pa.——International officers of the United Steel-
workers of America and the Aluminum Workers International
Union met here on,April 27 to sign a mutual assistance pact which
will “implement and increase the cooperative activities and ar- 
rangements” between the two unions. Together the two unions—-rep-new
resent the vast majority of workers in the aluminum industry.-

USWA President I. W. Abel and AWIU President -Eddie R. _ 
Stahl signed the aid document, which noted that overlapping jur.is- . “

dictions in the aluminum in-
dustry in the past have resulted
in “wasteful disputes and con-
tests.” Also signing the pact
were USWA Secretary-Treas-
urer Walter J. Burke, Vice-
President Joseph P; Molony,
and AWIU Secretary-Treasurer
Patrick J. Reilly, Sr.

The six-point agreement pro-
vides that the two unions will
respect each other’s ‘established
bargaining relationships, protect
one another’ against raids, avoid
organizing conflicts or competi-
tion; respect the other organiza-
tion’s integrity, improve pro-

-cedures for _ coordinated bar-

THE MINE-MILL UNION

Cdnadan USWA--Mine-Mill
Merger Agreement Signed

TORONTO, Ont.—If recommended merger terms are approved by its member-
ship, the Canadian section of Mine-Mill will unite with the‘ United Steelworkers of
America on July 1 this year——the same date that the formal merger between the
two unions in the United States becomes effective. Top officers of both unions signed
a nine-page merger agreement on the morning of April 29 at the Royal York Hotel

here.

While the ceremony was short, it was one of profound importance to workers
in the metal mining and processing industry, to the nonferrous companies, and to the

V entire Canadian labor move-

' ‘ment.

 = I Merger of the two unions in
"_,"’\._-_.C,:znada will unite more than
T  54,000 employees in the non-
_ _ ’ ferrous industry——approxi-
 -' * mately 90 percent of the total
in that country. Its fundamen-
. tal purpose, the merger docu-
ment emphasized, is to elim-
1 inate the rivalry between the
_ two organizations and “there-
‘ _‘-by to unite and strengthen
the -employees‘ ‘for more ef-
fective bargaining with the
employers."

At the‘ same time, it noted
that other gains would inevi-
tably result from the unity of

-* the” two most important labor
unions in the industry—gains
“in progressive provincial and

' federal legislation, in political
action, andin the total elimina-
tion of discrimination based up-

-'_"on (race, color, -creed, religion,

’' nationality, place of origin, or
sex."

Signing the document in the
brief ceremony that was cov-
ered by press and television
newsmen were, for the United
Steelworkers, Joseph P. Molony,
international vice-president;
William Mahoney, Canadian na-

. tional director; and Larry Set-

ton, District 6 director; and,
for Mine-Mill, Kenneth Smith,
national president;‘Harvey Mur-
phy, vice-president; and Wil-
liam Longridge, secretary-
treasurer.

_60 Staffmen Present

Also in attendance were A. C.
Skinner, Mine-Mill international
president, and some 60 staff
members from_ the two unions.

The merger document repre-
sents the fruits of many hours

of discussion and bargaining be-.

tween the leaders of the two
unions siifce a Mine-Mill lead-
ership conference in Edmonton
in February had authorized pro-
ceeding with the merger talks.

Delegates to the USWA inter-
national convention“ in Atlantic
City, N. J. last September en-
thusiastically granted approval
for merger between the two
unions. Detailed terms of the
nine-page document will -be re-
ported to the Canadian Policy
Conference of the Steelworkers,
scheduled for May 17 and 18 in
Toronto.

June Convention Set

The Canadian section of Mine-
Mill will discuss the merger
terms at a special convention
slated to begin on June 23 in
Winnipeg. Final ratification or
rejection of the merger will be
decided by a referendum vote
by all Mine-Mill Canadian mem-
bers, to be held “as soon as
practicable” after the conven-
tion.

If approved, Mine-Mill ' will
bring about 13,000 workers into
the merged organization. Be-
sides holding bargaining. rights
with the giant Cominco chain in
British Columbia, the North-
west Territories, and New
Brunswick and at the Falcon-
bridge nickel-copper operations
in Ontario, the union has an-
other 80 bargaining units in non-
ferrous production, in service
trades, and in mine exploration
and development.

The United Steelworkers in

‘Canada bargain for the vast

bulk of the basic steel em-
ployees and iron ore miners,
as well as for all aluminum
workers, in addition to repre-
senting many nonferrous indus-
try employees.

membership of 150,000. The
merged union would have 715
bargaining units, located in 225
communities in all provinces
and the Yukon and Northwest
Territories.

Initial bargaining tests will
take place at Brunswick Mining
in Bathurst, N. B. this fall, at
the CPR-owned Consolidated
Mining and smelting operations
in British Columbia in the
spring of next year, and at a
number of smaller mining op-
erations later in 1968.

Both Smith and Skinner, in
their remarks at the signing
ceremony, stated that the
merger presents unprecedented
opportunities for effective bar-
gaining. “We should from here
serve notice on the industry
that the days of its growing fat
at the expense of the workers
are rapidly drawing to a close,”
declared Longridge.

Molony termed the event a
“triumph of the ecumenical
spirit,” and Mahoney, Murphy,
and Sefton all noted its signifi-
cance to the future of the Ca-
nadian trade union movement.
“If we can unite, anybody can
unite,” said the Mine-Mill Cana-
dian vice-president, getting. a
laugh, but also making a seri-
ous point.

University Strike

forces Rehiring

Of liberal Priest

WASHINGTON, D. C.—A five-
day strike by some 6,600 grad-
uate and undergraduate students
and 600 faculty members of the
Catholic University of America
last month sent shock waves
throughout the American Cath-
olic hierarchy. The Rev. Charles
E. Curran, a priest who was
fired from his teaching. position
by university trustees because"
of his liberal views on moral
theology and birth control, has
been reinstated as a result of the
general boycott organized in
his behalf.

His promotion to associate
professor also was announced.

The students and faculty of
the school refused to attend
classes on April 19, charging
that Father Curran’s dismissal
constituted a serious threat to
academic freedom at the insti-
tution.

Adding strength to the first
teacher revolt in the school's
78-year history, the 22-member
faculty of the School of Sacred
Theology, of which Rev. Cur-
ran is a member, passed a reso-
lution saying, “we cannot and
will not function unless and
until Father Curran is rein-
stated.”

Further support for the priest
came when Lawrence Cardinal
Shehan of Baltimore, Md., and
the Most Rev. Paul J. Hallinan
of Atlanta, Ga. announced their
backing for him. Archbishop
Hallinan called Rev. Curran “a
very competent man . .” say-
ing that “it was unwise for the
trustees to act in a situation
in which faculty members were
not heard.”

The strike ended on April .‘-24
after word was received that
the trustees had reversed their

earlier position and had rein-

stated the priest. Archbishop
Patrick A. O’Boyle also an-
nounced that a new committee
would be created to review “is-

sues in the academic commun- .

ity as awhole.”

Faculty
made it clear that they intend
to keep an ’eye"‘on; future devel-
opments at the university. “The
immediate battle is won,”. said
one faculty leader,‘ “but-~the

war is still‘ far from over.

THE MINE-MILL UNl_ON‘

Labor Pressure Yields Unemployment

  Benefits for Strikers in New Jersey

, TRENTON, N. J .—With nearly 2,000 unionists jamming the spectators’ gallery and spilling over into the hall-
,0 i ways, the New Jersey State Assembly by the narrowest of margins on April 24 approved" a bill ‘improving state un-
’ _employment compensation benefits and making them available to workers on strike for more than seven weeks.
' When Gov. Richard J. Hughes signed the measure into law within the hour after passage, New Jersey became
the third state in the nation to extend such benefits to strikers. New York and Rhode Island have similar laws.

The Assembly vote was 32 to 21. Thirty-one votes—-a majority of the chamber—are needed for passage. The N.J.

Senate,,a few weeks previously,
_ ‘had approved the controversial
_ proposal by a wide margin.

Lengthy‘ Campaign

Enactment of the legislation
,marked the end of a long cam-

in its behalf. Many years ago,

_ Mine-Mill was one of the first

, paign by organized labor here ~

unions in the state to begin ac-
tively lobbying for such a bill.
And the’ union’s New Jersey 10-
cals played a' key role in this
year’s successful effort. V

-   Tactics used to Convict Hoffa
  - Threaten All, Says M-M Board

‘ . DENVER, Colo. — The Mine-Mill international executive board,
A in a statement’ condemning the “unsavory methods’? used by the
United I States. government in its long and ultimately successful
campaign to jail Teamsters Union President James R. Hoffa, «said
that ‘such tactics “have. no place in a society which proudly calls

he , itself free and democratic.”

Meeting at the Cosmopolitan

‘Hotel here early this month, the

, board noted that the most damaging evidence against the trade
2 unionist in his jury-tampering trial was the testimony of a paid

informer, Edward Grady Par-
tin. Further, it stated, there are
widespread indications that
wire-tapping and bugging of ho-
tel rooms were involved in Hof-
fa’s conviction.

Such methods, the Mine-Mill
b o a r d declared, “potentially
threaten the security of each
and every citizen.”

Noting the union’s gratitude
for the moral and financial sup-
port received from the Team-
sters during thelong and bitter

. nationwide copper strike of 1959,
the board said that the assis-

; tance was “only one example
of the sincere devotion to the
cause of American workers that
Hoffa’s leadership has meant to
the Teamsters.” The resolution

- pointed to th e solid contract

, gains won during his presidency
and the Teamsters’ great prog-
'1'ess in organizing the unorga-
nized as other examples.

“The government of a strong

“History will show,” said
Richard Lynch, vice-president
of the state AFL-CIO, only a
few days prior to the crucial
Assembly vote,’ “that if this bill

is passed, thecontribution made_

by the Mine, Mill and Smelter
Workers at a critical -point in
the legislative process made the

s difference between failure and .

success.”

Opponents of the bill had»

made every effort to bottle up
the proposal" in .committee.
Mine-Mill played an important
role in thwarting this attempt

by helping to line up the re-'

quired four votes to release the
measure from the Labor Com-
mittee, chaired by Joseph Doren
(D-Middlesex County),

The bulk of Mine—Mill’s New
Jersey membership is concen-
trated in Middlesex County, and
its political muscle there has
engendered close relationships
between the union and many of
the area’s public officials. All
four assemblymen and both
state senators from the county
supported the unemployment bill.

The Assembly vote on the pro-
posal split generally along party
lines, with Republicans voting
solidly in opposition, but for one
abstention. Five D e m o c r a ts
joined that opposition and two
abstained,

Lockouts Covered
While strikers will be eligible
to collect weekly. unemployment

benefits after a_six-week period 0

of disqualification and an addi-
tional one-week waiting period,
workers who are locked out by
their employer can draw pay-
ments after one week, under
terms of the new law.

' Also eligible for benefits after
seven weeks are other persons
working, at struck plants who
refuse to cross picket.lines.

. The new law bothpbroadens
the coverage of unemployment
compensation and increases ben-
efits. Maximum benefits for

' boththe unemployed and tem- '

porarily disabled ‘are. upped
from $50 to about $62. A person
becomes eligible for benefits if
he had‘ earned $1,350 before

had stipulated, he had worked
for 13 weeks. '

Another important provision
in the new law is one setting
benefits on a sliding scale, cal-
culated each Sept. 1‘ on the basis
ofjthe state's average weekly
wage. The maximum benefit
_will.be two-thirds of a worker's
salary or 50 percent of the state
average wage, and thus‘ will in-
crease over the years as wages
go up.

The present average salary in .

New Jersey is about $123 a

week. A ’ _
The bill provides for an in-

crease of $600, to $3,600, in the

taxable base for both employee _ ;

and employer to help finance

the benefit improvements. The . :

tax rates—2.3 percent for em-

» ployers and 0.5 percent for work-

ers——will remain unchanged.

,$50 A Million Excess

During the lengthy floor de-
bate on the proposal, it was
noted that the unemployment
and temporary disability funds
last year showed an excess -of
some $50 million, which also
could be applied to finance "ben-
efit increases and. other im-
provements.

The new law, which will take‘

effect on Jan. 1, was opposed by
virtually every newspaper in
the state, and many Republicans
are crowing that the measure
will do more to help elect mem-
bers of the GOP than almost
any other bill in history.

Direly predicting a massive

~ departure of industry from the

state, Republican debaters also
maintained that the new law
would encourage strikes. Yet,
the.bill specifies that the Com-
missioner of Labor must certify
good faith bargaining by the
union of ‘any applicant for strik-
er’s benefits. Thelaw also re-
quires the unionlto be willing.-to
submit the dispute to arbitration
or mediation.

THE Mine-tllitti

Labor Stakes High in Battle   Bdfgdiﬂiﬁg Begiﬂf
To Save “One Man, One Vote”

The Alaska State Senate last month killed a resolution which would have urged
Congress to call a Constitutional Convention for the purpose of overturning the his-
toric 1964 “one man, one vote” decisions of the U. S. Supreme Court. The State House
of Representatives there previously had approved such a resolution and, had the Sen-
ate concurred,‘ Alaska would have become the 33rd legislature in the nation to issue

such a plea to Congress.

U. S. Sen. Joseph D. Tydings (D-Md.), one of the leaders in the battle to preserve
the high court’s reapportionment rulings, was at least partially responsible ‘for the ac-
tion of the Senate in Alaska. He had been on the phone with the majority leader of

that body, effectively presenting

 \_t;l_1e. many sound arguments

"f-against the proposed resolution.

With 32' legislatures already
on record, however, the cam-
paignby U..S. conservatives is
dangerously close to its goal.
The U. S." Constitutionprovides
that when two-thirds of the state
legislatures petition‘ Congress, it
“shall call a cponventionfor pro-
posing amendments . . .” That
‘two-thirds figure is 34.

Leader of the quiet drive, de-
scribed by many observers as a
“sneak attack,” is U. S. Sen.
Everett M. Dirksen of Illinois,
the Senate’s Republican leader.

5, Liberals Alarmed

Although the addition of two

' more legislative resolutions does

, not automatically guar ante e

Dirksen’s success, his efforts

have progressed to the point

where political liberals through-

"  out the country are, with good
5 reason, alarmed.

' _ The three top officers of the
~ United Steelworkers of America
 on March 30 mailed an appeal

on the subject to every district

9.: _ director, staff representative,
. V and local union recording secre-

— tary; The letter, alerting the

, union to the dangers of the con-
servatives’ campaign, called for
action in helping to prevent any

‘more legislatures from passing

such resolutions and seeking

chances. to get legislatures which
 - already have approved such
’ .. resolutions to rescind them.

The letter, too, urged that
communication be made with
Congressmen and Senators, who
“must be shown that there is

. massive opposition to the Dirk-
. sen campaign.”

The AFL-C10 News also has

, strongly condemned the attempts

‘ 1 to overturn the “one man, one

vote” rulings of the Supreme
 Court.

Basic Struggle

Labor’s stakes in the current
. struggle are high indeed, for the
battle is a basic one of political
, power and representative gov-
‘ ernment. The court’s 1964 orders
;, jg--very simply provide that every-

Government Starts to Move
On New Mine Safety Law

WASHINGTON, D. C.——A top-echelon reorganization of the U. S. Bureau of Mines
was announced on April 5 by Secretary of the Interior Stewart L. Udall, who said the
move was designed both to increase the Bureau's emphasis on protecting the health
and safety of miners and to strengthen its research program. - H r

Appointed to a newly created position of associate director for health and safety

was Frank C. Memmott, known to many Mine-Mill members who heard him address '

the union's 1965 convention in Denver. .
Formerly headed up by an assistant director, the health and safety activities of the

Bureau of Mines are being ex-
panded as a result of last_ year's
Congressional enactment of the
Federal Metal and Nonmetallic
Mines Safety Act and the ex-
tension to small mines of the
Federal Coal Mine Safety Act's
coverage.

Underscores importance

Calling Memmott the man
“best qualified” to undertake the
“major new responsibilities”
created by the new laws, Udall
said his designation to the new
post underscores the vital im-
portance of health and safety in
future Bureau of Mines opera-
tions. ’

Two assistant directors—still
to be named—will work under
Memmott and report to him.
One will work in the area of
metal mine safety, the other
in coal mine safety. Also re-
porting to the associate direc-
tor will be a new Office of
Research Coordination, to pull
together all research, develop-
ment, and testing programs in
the ﬁeld of health and safety
research. -

Signed into law by President
Johnson last Sept. 16, the Fed-
eral Metal and Nonmetallic

Mine Safety Act calls for the
establishment of health and
safety standards that the mine
operators will have to meet. Al-

though labor and industry-

groups have been contacted

visory committees, which will

standards, no appointments to
-the committees have yet been

announced.

Under terms of the new law,
which covers underground and
open pit mines, mills, quarries,

M8,. 71281 

Congress Ponde

WASHINGTON, D. C.——For nearly 23 million Amer-

icans, the course of action taken by the 90th Congress on’

a single legislative proposal—the call by President John-
son for an average -increase of 20 percent in Social Secur-
ity benefits—will be a crucial one. For many of them, the
direction taken can mean the difference between a life of
dignity and one of poverty and continuing despair.

“Too many citizens,” said the President, in empha-
sizing the absolute need for the proposed benefit hikes,

build.” -

_“have been left behind by the progress they helped

Reports published by the Social Security Administra-
tion bear out his statement. Of the nearly 15 million per-
sons receiving retirement benefits under the Old Age,

Survivors and Disability Insur-.
ance program, 85 percent have

‘no other source of income. Yet,

the average yearly benefits of
$984 for an individualland $1,-
728 for a couple are far below
the $2,500 to $3,000 annual in-
come" level that the U. S. De-
partment of Labor says is
needed by an elderly couple if

it is to escape the jaws of-

poverty.

, For many of those who had ,
enthusiastically looked forward
to their “golden years,” ex-
istence can turn out to be bleak
indeed. V

While even a 20 percent in-
crease in Social Security bene- -
fits will not provide the in-
come security needed by" the
elderly, the disabled, and
widows, the labor movement
is agreed that it would certainly
be a substantial step in the right
direction. Bert Seidman, direc-
tor of the AFL-CIO’s Depart-
ment of Social Security, states
that a 20 percent boost would
constitute only the first step
“toward an eventual rise of
50 percent”—a figure set as"
labor’s goal.

Greatest Need Considered

Under the terms of the John-
son" administration’s c u r r e n t
proposal, however, generally a
larger portion of the 20_percent
average increase would go to
those who need it most. Some

‘ 2.57million citizens now receiv-

ing the minimum retirement

benefits would receive a 59 per-
_ cent increase. The remaining

20.5 beneficiaries would receive

at least a 15 percent hike.

Various sections of the bill
would provide: '

C Retirement B e n e fits for

’ ‘persons with less than 25 years’

participation would be uppedito
monthly, minimums of $70 for 1

, individuals and $105 for couples. ~
.People. who had contributed to

the program for -25 or‘ more"
years- would _be guaranteed ‘a

minimum of’ $100 , for individuals

and'$150 for couples.

. 0 Disability Pension provi-

: ‘ sions would beexpanded to in-
‘ clude Medicare coverage -for

the 1;5_,million disabled pension-
ers, with-the same hospital and

\

1 doctor benefits -furnished to
those 65 and older. , ‘ ,

 Widow’s Benefitswould be

 ._‘extended_ to disabled widows
who don’t qualify under‘ the
-. present law.“ Currently, bene-
 fits_-are limited to those‘:62 or_
_ . _ older-_ and to those ,With’children2 .

visiting nurses and other health
services provided at home to
the ailing_ aged. Pilot programs
in medical and rehabilitation
services for the aged would be
started, and the possibility of
including prescription drugs un-
der Medicare would be studied.

0 Welfare Aidpaid by the in-
dividual states would be re-
quired to meet payment levels

necessary‘ for subsistence. The '

states‘ also would be encouraged
to allow elderly welfare recipi-
ents to work without their earn-
ings being deducted from their
welfare checks.

0 Tax Revisions for persons
over 65 would allow a $2300 ex-
emption for individuals and
$4,000»for couples. This would

eliminate tax payments for 500,-

000 elderly persons and reduce
tax liabﬂities for an additional
3 million.

0 Employment Provisions
would be enacted prohibiting
arbitrary age limits on hiring
to cover workers 45 to 65 years
old. -

The House Ways and Means
Committee, chaired by Rep.
Wilbur D. Mills (D-Ark.), last
month _completed its hearings
on HR 5710, the administration’s
Social Security Amendments of
1967. The lengthy hearings had
opened March 1.

Labor testimony g e n e r ally
supported the proposed 20 per-
cent increase as a minimum at
this time and also advocated an
automatic adjustment, or cost-
of-living adjustment to keep the
higher benefit levels up-to-date.

Financing Proposal '
The New York City Central

"Labor Council (AFL-CIO), ca1l- 7'

ing for benefit increases in ex-
cess of the proposed 20 percent,

stated, too, that Congress should .
8 turn to general revenues "to fi-

nance the program, rather than

‘continuing to -rely on Social Se-

curity payroll taxes.

Two House Democrats, Reps.
Henry S. Reuss and Clement ‘J.
Zablocki, both of Milwaukee,
have introduced bills which
would finance about a third of
the Social Security costs from
federal income taxes. Sen. Gay-
lord Nelson, also a_ Democrat
from Wisconsin, is sponsoring a

8 similar proposal, which would

provide, as well, 2 for cost-of-

livingi adjustments in the pro-

gram.

ent 4.4 percent on the first $6,-

Idea Not New
It is because of the fact that

workers with lower wages con-'

tribute a greater percentage of
their total income to the pro-
gram than do those with larger
earnings- (more than the $6,-
600 taxable base) that the idea
of financing from general reve-

ity, the group, which in 1934
worked to develop the original
Social Security law, and almost
every Security Advisory Coun-
cil since then proposed some
form of general revenue financ-

A ing.

Shortly after the_ enactment
of the program, Congress
agreed to provide full benefits
to the persons retiring at the
time even though their short
periods of participation did not
provide full financing for their
benefits. While it was wise to
insure those covered for full
benefits from the outset, it
necessitated an “accrued liabil-

. ity” which had to be financed

through future contributions. .

Social Security actuaries have
computed that this accrued
liability amounts to one-third of
the program’s total cost. This
fact constitutes another argu-
ment in support of partially fi-
nancing the program from gen-
eral revenues. ‘

Such a proposal, on the other
hand, certainly does not mean
that the program has become
a heavy burden within the coun-
try’s economy. While critics
have screamed that the present
4.4 percent contribution is evi-
dence of spiraling costs, they
fail to note that the present
taxable base of $6,600 repre-
sents only 81 percent of the to-
tal payroll. '

If the amount taxed today
encompassed 95 percent of the

total payroll, as it did in 1936,»

the present . contribution, would

be about 3.56 perc_ent—less than’
-one percent more than in_1939._

This. is_ _true despite the in-

’ creases, in cash benefits "over.

Hidden Short-Term Unemployment

Unemployment figures by the federal government do not in-

clude many persons

suffering from short-term layoffs, claims a

Pittsburgh, Pa., economist. When business is slow, he says, some
companies deliberately time brief layoffs to prevent their disclos-
ure in the monthly surveys on unemployment. Workers are laid-off
shortly after one month’s report is completed and reinstated before
the survey week for the next report.

Government figures, in many cases, are reflecting only the
“ups” in an up-and-down employment picture.

ism. Most younger members do not remember the great‘ depres-
sion of the 1930’s, and many are unaware of the outstanding gains

_ registered by organized labor since then. V

‘Also alarming are the results of a poll conducted by the AFL-
CIO’s Committee on Political Education which revealed that most

union members get their -labor news from television and news mag-__

azines,_not from union publications.

Importance of Early Retirement

The United Auto Workers union states that 30,000 new jobs
have been created—4,000 by the Chrysler Corp. a1one—as a result

of the early retirement program won in its 1964 contract negotia-r ',

tions with the automobile industry. Union officials point out that

recent layoffs would

have been even greater had it not been for

older workers retiring early under the provisions of the program.

Pension Plan Hearings Slated
Senate Labor subcommittee hearings on President Johnson’s
request for tighter controls _on private pension plans are expected
to begin soon. Regulation proposals also have been submitted by

» Senators: John L. McClellan (D-Ark.) and Jacob K. J avits (R-N.Y.).

Chairing the subcommittee is Sen. Ralph W. Yarborough (D-
Tex.), who is talking. of reforms to provide for the funding of pen-
sion plans to ensure payment to participants, job-to-job portability,

and vesting of pension rights."

Layoff Aid Reforms Sought

Labor will seek major changes in the current’ federal system‘
of aid for workers laid-off due to competition from the importation
of foreign products and materials. There is general support among
members of the House Ways and Means Committee for progressive
changes in the Trade Expansion Act, due to come up for renewal

later this year.

A key union goal is to have the administration of layoff aid
wrested from the hands of the Tariff Commission, which has re-
jected every union petition for aid thus far. Labor leaders cite the

impressive record of

a special committee, consisting of the Secre-

taries of Labor, Commerce, and the Treasury, which has approved

layoff aid under the

U.»S.-Canada auto trade pact -in each of the

four cases it has decided in its first year of operation.

THE MINE-MILL

USWA Presidentwarmly
Welcomed by Carteret Local

CARTERET, N. J. — Workers at three of the largest smelting and refining
operations in the United States, all within a radius of four miles, willbe joined
together in one union when merger between the United Steelworkers and Mine-Mill
becomes official on July 1, declared USWA President I. W. Abel on April 21 at a din-
ner in his honor, sponsored by Mine-Mill Local 837 at its modern union hall.

Referring to Anaconda’s Raritan refinery, AS&R’s Perth Amboy plant, and the
U. S. Metals facility in Carteret, he said that this fact clearly dramatizes, in a compact

geographical area, what all the
discussions about merger have
been about -— the uniting for
increased strength of workers
that previously had been divid-
ed. The United Steelworkers
hold bargaining rights at Rari-
tan, with Mine-Mill contracts
currently in effect at the other
two properties.

Attended by some 250 persons,
including representatives from
nearly 20 Mine-Mill‘ and Steel-
workers locals fr 0 n1 Ansonia,
Conn. to Trenton, 'N.J., the din-
ner meeting featured speeches
by several public officials from
the area, as well as by Abel and
other trade unionists. All hailed
the impending union merger as
a move that will mean progress
on b 0 t h collective ' bargaining
and political ~action fronts.

Mine-Mill International Pres-
ident A. C. Skinner, who said

that this year's nonferrous nego- _

tiations would find’the workers
united as never before, also dis-
cussed a bill before the state
legislature, passed and signed
into law only a few days later,
which would provide unemploy-
ment benefits f or strikers.
Terming the proposal “one of
the most important unemploy-
ment bills in this state in 10
years,” he said its progress was
a tribute to the strength of
organized labor in New Jersey.

Important Role
The visits to the legislature by

‘labor delegations from Middle-

sex County had played an ex-
tremely important role in mov-
ing the bill, admitted Assembly-
man Joseph Doren, chairman
of the Labor Committee and_ one
of the measure’s sponsors. Dor-
en and Assemblymen Robert
Wilentz and Norman Tanzman
all spoke briefly at the ban-
quet, and all pledged to sup-
port the bill, upon which a

Safefy Commiffee Lawl    
Won for NW Terriforiesi

OTTAWA, Ont.-—-Meeting for the first time under the;
manship of Commissioner Stuart Hodgson, the No1'thwest'Terr§
torial Council recently amended a proposed Mines Safety ordinaziége,
to compel every mine in the region employing more than 25
to establish safety committees, comprised jointly of two manage-.5’ .,_ ,
ment appointees and two workers elected by the employees at fthe “ . ‘

operation.

“This is the most advanced legislation on this question in
Canada,” declared Kenneth Smith, national president of Mine--Mill“
which successfully lobbied for theproposal. » . V

In spelling out the duties of the committees, the new_ legisla-

  
    

 

 

   

tion calls for inspections of the properties “'at least once a month"£.[‘

and the filing of a report on
conditions found with both the
manager and a government in-
spector.

Other provisions agreed upon
in_clude:

O The inspector is to advise
the mine safety committee
when he is in camp;

I The mine manager is to
notify the safety committee
when either a “serious ac-
cident” or a fatality oc-
curs;

0 Copies of the reports of the
safety committee are to be-
posted in conspicuous
places.

The action marks only the
second time in Canada that a
government of a province or
territory has shown a recogni-
tion of the important role of
the workers themselves in the
area of mine safety. The gov-
ernment of British Columbia,
which received pressure from
the union there, passed such
legislation years ago, but none
of the other provinces have
doneso.

Union Delegation

Heading the Mine-Mill dele-
gation to the meeting of the
council were Wililam Berezow-

- ski, northern regional director,

and Les Walker, western com-
pensation and welfare officer.
Reg MacDonald, president of
Con Sub-Local 802; Bill Jordan,
safety ofifcer for Pine Point

  Labor Columnist Authors

N cw Civil Liberties Text

“With"Liberty and Justice for All: The Meaning of the Bill
of Rights Today,_” recently published by Oceana Publications, Inc.
of Dobbs Ferry, N .Y.,' is a book by Harold V. Knight, for the past
15 years a regular weekly columnist for the Colorado Labor Ad-
vocate, official publication ofithe state’s.AFL-C10.

The 300—page work deals with the rights enjoyed by Americans
and with many of the struggles that have been required over the
years to prevent encroachment upon them. While tracing some of

the major court decisions that have

ing body of law" as conditions in
the country have changed, the
book emphasizes the applica-
tion of these rights in today’s
society. C

Knight, who served as the ex-
ecutive director of the Colorado
branch of the American Civil
Liberties Union for nearly a
decade on a part-time basis, is
a strong civil libertarian. Yet
his book does not attempt to
give all the answers, particu-
larly in those frequent cases

_ where the exercise of a right

by one may’ diminish another
right of others.

V Pertinent Questions Raised

Instead, Knight’s work serves
to raise clearly the many ques-
tions that the broad area of civ-
il liberties involves. The book

 would serve asla good discus-
" sion guide‘ in high school class-

rooms, particularly if moretde-
tailed supplemental. readings on
First and Fifth“ Amendmen

‘cases were available.’ 1"

Although the right to picket‘
and other labor questions are

, dealt with only sparingly, the-
e ‘book should be of interest to

union ,members’ who are con-
cerned with the American con-

cept of freedom, as are many
members of‘ Mine-Mill, whose.

union has played an important
role in the history ofcivil liber-
ties in. the United States.‘

In describing how the Bill of
Rights came_ into being, Knight
points’ to the role of political
compromise. Pressure, both po-
litical "and otherwise, from U. S.

‘citizens has played a continu-‘

ing role in the expansion. of

I liberties since that. time.-

conservative quarters.

Born on March 16, 1907 in
Cameron, M0,, Knight worked
on a weekly newspaper during

"the depression years, following

his graduation from Jamestown
(N.D.) College in 1929. He ed-
ited the North Dakota Farmers
Union publication prior to com-
ing to Colorado, where he has
covered legislative news for
scores of newspapers through-
out the state in his column

-“Statehouse Drama.” Married

to the former Ruth Gallup, long
an active member of the Den-

.ver Federation of Teachers,

Knight has written articles for
numerous national publications.

An introduction to the new
book, which is priced at $6, is

written by Roger Baldwin, well-

known\ nationally in the civil
liberties area. “Many books

‘have appeared on the new -con-

cepts of law, and their striking
effects . on . the practice of
rights,".he states, “but! know
of none other than this that I

' would commend as‘ highly to

the general reader for accu-
racy, fairness, and lucidity; . . .

THE MINE-MILL UNION

May. 1 957-‘ 

Recent Demonstrations Show Growing

Magnitude of Vietnam War Protests

A broad cross-section of Americans from civil rights organizations, student groups, the trade union movement,
the religious community, and many other walks of life marched together on April 15 in protest over the war in Viet-
nam. Peace demonstrations in New York City and San Francisco on that day were among the largest ever held in
the United States, whether one chooses to believe newspaper accounts stating that some 200,000 persons took part
or other estimates that put the figure closer to half a million.

While New York City participants marched along Central Park South, down Madison Avenue, an-d across to the
United Nations building for a rally, a similar contingent in San Francisco paraded 28 blocks from the Embarcadero

to fill Kezar Stadium.

The Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, J r., president of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, who in recent

policy in Southeast Asia, was
the featured speaker at the
massive U.N. gathering. De-
claring that the war is prevent-
ing progress on the domestic
front besides being itself “ille-
gal and unjust,” the noted civil
rights leader said, “I think this
is just the beginning of a mas-
sive outpouring of dissent."
Dr. Benjamin Spock, well-
known pediatrician, now -being
mentioned as a’ possible inde-
pendent 1968 presidential candi-
date of- the country’s peace
movement, also addressed the

east coast rally.

Robinson ‘Participates

Other 5 p e a k e r s included
Cleveland Robinson, president of
the Negro American Labor
Council and secretary-treasurer
of the Retail, Wholesale, and
Department Store Union, Dis-

.tric't 65; Dr. Linus Pauling, a

Nobel prize winner in Chemis-
try; Stokley Carmichael, head
of the Student Non-Violent Co-
ordinating Committee; and
Floyd McKissick, national chair-
man of the Congress of Racial
Equality.

Dr. King's wife addressed the
Kezar Stadiumcrowd, and, like
her husband, called for a halt

‘to the bombing of North Viet-

nam, as a step towards the in-
itiation of negotiations. Severai
U.S. Senators have urged the
President to take this --step.
Television star Robert Vaughn
and Georgia state legislator Ju-
lian Bond also spoke, as did
Gerald Hill, president ‘of the
California Democratic Council,
whose -organization is on record
as favoring the fielding of an

‘anti-war slate in the stat e’s

presidential p r i m a r i e s next

‘year.

The resolution adopted by the
recent convention of the Inter-
national Longshoremen’s and

VWarehousemen’s Union, calling

for the U.S. to withdraw from
Vietnam, was read at the rally,
which also heard from Paul
Schrade, western regional di-
rector of the United Auto Work-
ers.

Delegations from several 10-

cal unions of other internation-

als also participated in the
march. ‘ ‘

Distorted Reports

While there was no lack of .

news coverage of the demon-
strations by the American press,
many accounts were badly dis-
torted. Participants maintained
that so-called “beatnik types”
didn’t come close to dominating
the demonstrations—contrary to
the impression left by at least
some of the press reports.

The editor of the East Bay

‘ Labor Journal, published by the

Central Labor Council and the
Building and Construction
‘T r a d ‘e s Council of. ‘Alameda

V County in California, calling the
.ma-rches “effective,” comment- .

ed that .he‘would participate in’

future ones. “Another reason"
he would take part, he ex-
plained, is that "‘-I want to know
what is said at the rallies after
them. You certainly couldn’t
find that out by reading either
the San Francisco or Oakland
monopoly dailies."

Only three weeks prior to the
April 15 marches, an estimated
10,000 persons took part in a
peace demonstration in Chicago
—the largest in the city's his-
tory. At a rally at the Chicago
Coliseum, Dr. King advocated
a program of “demonstrate,
teach, preach, and organize,
until the very foundations of
our nation are shaken.” Here,
too, demonstrators represented
a cross-section of the are a--
trade unionists, Negroes, Puer-
to Ricans, young people.

 A W Secretary - Treasurer

_Emil Mazey also spoke, criti-

cizing President Johnson for
carrying out “Goldwater’s for-
eign policy” while betraying his
own campaign pledges of 1964.

The Spring Mobilization Com-
mittee, which organized the
New York and San Francisco
marches, already has scheduled
another mass demonstration for
May 17 in front of the White
House in Washington.

Los Angeles SANE Group

Earlier this year, 130 union-
ists in Los Angeles established
a Trade Union Division of the
Committee for a Sane Nuclear
Policy (SANE), similar to such
branches in New York and Chi-
cago. Taking part in the organi-
zation were members of the
Teachers Union, ILWU, Auto

Workers, Steelworkers, T y p 0-
graphical Union, Ladies Gar-
m e nt Workers, Amalgamated
Clothing Workers, Carpenters,
Painters, State, County and Mu-

nicipal Workers, .and several
other unions.

In Pittsburgh, too, an ad hoc
Trade Union SANE group has
been set up. It sponsored an
April 21 panel discussion on
“Labor's Stake in the War in
Vietnam.”

Participating w e r e Thomas
Quinn from the United Electri-
cal Workers; John Powderly
from the Steelworkers; Joseph
Zunic, president of Local 400,
American Federation of Teach-
ers; and Arthur Edelman from
the Carpenters and Joiners.

The union members involved
in the TUD-SANE groups, which
are becoming increasingly ac-
tive, participate on an indi-
vidual basis, and are not neces-
sarily representing official posi-
tions of their respective unions.

Rusk’s Appraisal
The government’s response to
the increase in the number a-nd
frequency of anti-war -demon-

strations and meetings has been '

a critical one. Appearing on
NBC’s “Meet the Press" on Sun-
day, April 16, the day following
the New York and San Francis-
co marches, Secretary of State
Dean Rusk said he had “no
doubt at all that the Communist
apparatus is very busy indeed
in these operations . . .,” tem-
pering his statement only
enough to add that he didn’t
think “all those who have ob-
jections to the war in Vietnam
are Communists.” ,
Rusk’s statement was quickly
rapped by The Denver Post, a
newspaper that has generally
supported the administration’s
policy in Vietnam, which main-
tained that the Secretary had
stretched a point. Pointing to
the nation’s cherished heritage
of nonviolent dissent, the paper
editorially said, “to attribute

THE LARGEST PEACE DEMONSTRATION ‘IN CHICAG.O'S HISTOEY took place on March
25, as 10,000 marchers made their way‘ to —the Chicago ‘Coliseum for CI rally. Leading the -

m a jor responsibility for the
demonstrations to a ‘worldwide
Communist movement’ gives
the internally - torn Communist
bloc more credit than it de-
serves.”

A recent survey of Democrat-
ic Congressmen, meanwhile, in-
dicates that, while few, admit
the possibility of .1’ resident
Johnson's defeat in 1968, 102 be-
lieve he will face a difficult
fight for re-election. Only 30
members of the House and Sen-
ate willing to be tallied in an
Associated Press poll thought
that the war would not damage
his position, would not be a ma-
jor issue in the campaign, or
might help his chances.

A BROAD CROSS-SECTIOISL
of the Chicago community
was represented in the Chi-
cago peace march, "which --
involved trade unionists, re,-A
ligious leaders, minority
g r 0 up members, business-
men, students, veterctns.

Non-Bias Progress Being    
Made at Miami Operation 0  

MIAMI, Ariz. — The Inspiration Consolidated Copper Company
has indicated that Mexican-American workers will be moved into
craft jobs here, and some such movement has taken place, follow-
ing action in recent months by Mine-Mill Local .586 in filing com-
plaints of discrimination with the federal Equal Employment

Opportunities Commission.

Over the-years, the company has kept members of the minority
group from becoming helpers, apprentices, and journeymen at the
property, despite the many written applications for such positions
submitted by Mexican-Americans. Although Inspiration argued that

the practice was necessitated by
union jurisdictional lines, it
often filled such openings with
Anglos from the Mine-Mill unit.

When pressure last year from
both Mine-Mill and the craft
unions here failed to effect a
policy shift on the part of the
company, Mine-Mill decided to
contact the EEOC. This Jan. 6,

Meeting on,Copper Seffor June

Government leaders from major Latin American and African
copper-producing countries will meet in Lusaka, Zambia in June
to discuss copper marketing and prices. Attending will be repre-
sentatives of Zambia, Chile, Peru, and the Congo, which jointly
turn out about 40 percent of all free world copper. Copper pro-
duced by these four is pegged to the London Metal Exchange price,
and one rumor has it that Chile would like to substitute a new pro-
ducers’ price. (The LME price hit almost $1 a pound last year,

. but is now around 43'cents.) r , A

Simon Strauss, vice-president of the American smelting & Re-
fining Company, warns, in a public statement, that an attempt by
the four producing nations (most of whose output is for export)
to control the world market could have serious repercussions from
consumers switching to substitutes. He points out that the fabri-
cating industry leaders, not government heads, make the decisions
on use of copper rather than other materials, and urges that
market demand be permitted to control the copper price. I

Other U. S. operators have not commented publicly. A
The Lusaka meeting, which will involve leaders of govern-

ments, not representatives of industry, will not include any U’. S.

Era New hontract

PERTH AMBOY, N. J .—A new
two-year contract with Bird and
Son was ratified last month by
members of the Genasco Roof-
ing Workers’ Union, Mine-Mill
Local 847.. Among the gains won
are 18 cents in ‘across-the-board
wage increases and 11/2 addi-
tional paid holidays.

An eight-cents-per-hour gen-
eral wage increase became ef-
fective on May 1, with another
10—cent raise due on May 1, 1968.
Several wage adjustments were
made, providing increases of
from five to nine cents an hour.

An additional half-day holiday
on New Year’s Eve goes into
effect this year and Washing-
ton’s Birthday will be observed
during the second year of the
agreement. Double time for Sun-
day work will now be -received
by firemen, who formerly were
the only employees excluded
from the premium. The over-
time lunch allowance was in-
creased to $1.50.

Life insurance for employees
was raised to $3,000 per year.
Pension plan improvements in-
clude a provision for early re-
tirement after 25 years of ser-
vice or upon reaching age 55
with at least 15 years’ service.

The union negotiating commit-
tee was comprised of Steve

“Preliminary statistics indicate that 233 miners were killed in 1966 while producing coal, Ani‘eri-

ca’s number one energy source. Of this total ‘— a record low for any year in statistical history -— 189

_ miners were killed underground. The number one cause of death is still falls of roof, face and rib.
,Such accidents accounted for 111 deaths, 59 percent of the underground total. The second highest

cause of death underground was
from haulage accidents, which
took 39 lives, six more than in
1965. ‘

“The above figures deal only
with fata1ities,_ which certainly
are tragedies in the truest sense
of the word, but they do not
