A similar conference of Western

Shortly before these‘ developments

were annouhced, Internation_al_ Vice--',-1_
President Orville Larson and Washing- 4
ton Legislative Representative .Herman X

Clott held a_ series of discussions with

1 _) Western congressm’en in ‘Washington, 

urging upon them immediate" action in

“rolling readjustment” and tl1ere’s ,

’* Eisenhower also told a press con-

ference that a““‘readjustment” is ,

“necessary and healthy.”

How it can be healthy for sev-
eral million family heads to be
without jobs is not -explained.

The way. to cure unemployment is
not to count the unemployed. The
U. S. Census Bureau unemploy-
ment spot check for January
showed slightly less than 2'/; mil-

lion out of work. Labor economists_
point out that in order to _r'each‘~
this figure, the Bureau has “de- 

fined away” nearly one million per-
sons who should be in the labor

. force. The Bureau's theory is that
a lot of people who worked during
the Korean war 'aren’t really in the
labor force and therefore if they

_ are not working’ now they should
not ‘be counted ‘ as unemployed. .

In addition to ‘this weird logic,_. A

 

the Bureau also uses some other _'

queer gimmicks. 9

If you are not working, but not
actively looking for a— job-“(ev‘en if
no jobs ‘are available) they don’t
count you as unemployed.’ Also, if
you are working only 15 hours a

eweek ‘or if you have been laid off
and told you "will be taken back
soon, the Bureau says you are not
unemployed. When all these left»
out persons are added, the unem-

ployment count total comes to over’

four million.

he thought it was more important
to cut taxes on corporations than
on low income groups. This is ex-
0 actly what the.adm'inistration is

If Montana workers were in-

‘the raiders before, today they

 

 ' are snowballing a crusade against A

.. the disrupters, mainly because of
the threat .to their living stan-
dards, posed by the Anaconda
Copper Mining Company’s intro-

- duction of the five-day week. ,

ACM is shutting down two mines and
re—assigning miners to other Butte op-.
erations. The company has announced
that it will remain on a six—day sched-

‘ only five shiftsper week. This will be

A “There is a worrisome air about Butte
these days. The community has had» a
shock. This holds true for‘ the smelter
A towns of Anaconda and Great Fallsas
 Well. You cansee the concern written
on the faces of the miners and. their
wives. You can"see it in the faces of
the business 'men and ?others. H
_ “The income of this community is

Ai ‘ A _du_ced by about,;22..or 23 per cent. “What
A i this will mean tolliving standards and
business prosperity can be readily seen.
The announcement by the company that
the Butte miners will be on afive-dAay
_week is a blow .to the entire community

the very jobs and economic life of the

~ THE CUTBACK by'ACM sealed the
doom of the-Masons and their raiders.
What was previously just a good,
energetic and enthusiastic / campaign

were groups who had been hanging
back with a‘“wait and» see” attitude.
But the march on the hall changed all
that; the successful reoccupation was

hailed as the symbol ofthe unleashed’

of the International Union of Mine,‘
Mill and Smelter Worke1's.‘A

~ From that moment on, there was no a

doubt -‘ but, that the Masons and the
-Steel raiders had\ had it. * A S
VICTORY piled upon victory.
District Judge John B. McClarnan
ruled Feb. 8~that‘the Steel raiderswere

- enjoined and restrained.“from interfer-

ing in any way with thepossession of
the Miners_HalI now being held by

‘ Mine-lVIill.’’ He gave as reasons for his'
_ ruling, read in a packed courtroom,
-that “Mine-Mill had acquired and is

holding peaceful possession of the hall

I’ and this is one instance where that is

nine points of the law,” and also that
»“Mine-Mill is still at thisdate the au-
tliorized bargaining representative of
the miners of this community.”

“As the organization in peaceful pos-
session‘ and as the authorized bargain-
court said,
“tl'1is‘court will support Mine-Mill to

fthe. full extent of its power and author-

ity until the Butte miners can express
,their opinion in a free and secret bal-
lot.” 2 I ’ A 

THE JUDGE’S CONCERN for a

newspaper; Roy Richmond, City.Man- '

ager; Russell Rhodes, presidentof the

I Chamber of Commerce; Alton P. Bryan,-

Mayor of Chewelah; Warren Nelson

OPENING the discussion on Mine-

’ Mill’s anti-depression program, the Un-

ion committee pointed out that serious
layoffs were taking place at the major

. property in the area, Northwest Mag-
ynesite, with more layoffs scheduled.

V-The, unemployment situation both 10- V

i , cally and‘ nationally was discussed, with

State Senator Dahl observing that-he

' felt the major responsibility for aid in»
such a situation should and would come

from the national administration.

With everyone present agreeing,
however, that something must be done
locally right away, the Union, group
presented the 'Mine-Mill jobs program
and specifically asked for consideration
on a new school, park improvement,

road improvements and a children’s'

public playground with a swimming

pool as immediate and necessary proj-

; ects. .

The discussion finally "resolved

iaround the proposition that a new

school bond issue was approved and
that those responsible would push for
immediate action on that project, spe-

. cifying that local labor _be used in

any contract signed. Senator Dahl also
revealed that funds had been allocated
for a National Guard Armory and that
he would move for allocationof the

. contract latonce, again specifying that

the contractor must use ‘local labor.
THE ENTIRE Mine-Mill program to

' head off’ a depression was discussed,
» including removal of‘ trade barriers be- A
tween East and West, and while no
"formal position was taken everyone _

appeared to agree with the general

principles of the program.
The’ luncheon ended with the under-

:standing that another such meeting

may be arranged for a later date.

Meanwhile, Int’l reps. Gardner and
Cochran have met with the chairman

. of the Chamber of Commerce at Meta-

line Falls, Wash., who "agreed to ar-
range a similar meeting for that area
some time this month.

‘ GILMAN, Colo.-—A sneak raid start-

’ I ed by Steel “organizers” here la-st week

a is being opposed by a/growing majority
. of ‘Battle Mountain Miners Union, Lo-
, cal 581. Four raiders came into the
‘ area and called meetings at whichi
‘Mine-Mill members were given the “

.1‘

usual red-‘baiting and the phony prom-
ises. Int’l Rep. Leo Ortiz resigned
quickly when it was discovered that

. he had a part in the, scheme.

Joe» Lopez," financial secretary of

' nearby Leadville~Local 393, was made
; Administrator of Local 581 after some

of - the Gilman officers had joined the

' raiders and others had resigned. Lo-
" pez has joined the Mine-Mill ‘staff to
u. help_ fight the raid here. “ - "

A meeting of Local 581 is planned

."at an early date to elect new officers

‘ and make plans to completely cleanse
‘ the local of union-splitting influences.

Leaders of an AFL.local union at

' the big Climax Molybdenum mine near

., have been alerted to fight off the

 

 

a Mine-Mill leadership conference was
a recommendation that each local un-
ion “immediately set up a committee on
unemployment and political action.
“This committee to work on all- of
the questions which affect the welfare
of our membership on these fronts.
“Following the setting up of these
committees, a general meeting of same
will be held and from them an execu-.

‘tive or coordinating committee “will be

selected for the entire State of Ala-.

bama.” V
This action followed reports

spokesmen for the local unions parti-_

cipating. All but one reported layoffs, ‘

short weeks, or both. The one excep-
tion reported the company using “poor
business conditions”. to balk at a decent
wage increase and to threaten a shut-
down. . '
The conference was -addressed b
Int’l Vice Presidents Orville Larson and
,Asbury Howard, Secretary-Treasurer
M. E. Travis and’ Board Member Alton
Lawrence. - ‘ \ '
‘Greetings were sent to the Butte,
‘Anaconda and El Paso locals which re-
cently have defeated attacks by the
Steel raiders. . 1 .

Any movement for" people's political
action in Alabama facesthe first hur-
dle of getting people registered to vote.
One of‘ the two major bars to voting

h.as..been removed this yearwith the '

reduction of the accumulative poll tax
from $36 to a maximum of $3.

The second bar isthe state law per-
mitting registrars ’to determine the

by.

“fitness” of a person to vote. In some
places this is being abused more than
ever, now that the poll tax law has
been altered. In practice, registrars
turn down almost all Negroes who ap-
ply, and a big proportion of Whites,
especially working people. _

However, pressure of public opinion
has caused more and more Boards of
R.egistrar's to extend the hours of reg-
istration and to use volunteer regis-
trars who usually are more fair than
the political appointees who tradition-
ally have had complete control over

. who could vote.

If the question asked of would-be
voters in Jefferson County, Ala. (Birm-
ingham and Bessemer) were placed
before citizens anywhere in the coun-
try,.only an occasional school teacher
would pzgss the test. In practice, those
whom the registrar wanted to qualify
are passed, while the difficult and ir-
relevant questions are used to bar
others. ‘ _ -

To be sure of knowing the answers

under» the traditional practice, a per-

son would have to know. the names of
dozens of - minor "public officials, the
major officials of the state and na-
tion,,,. as well as many technical points
of law and election procedure——in-
formation not possessed ‘by one voter
in a thousand in most states.

There is also a questionnaire asking
intimate details of the applicant and
members of his family for five years
past, plus insulting questions such as:
“Are you now or have you ever been
..a dope addict or an habitual drunkard;

if youare or have been, explain as If

fully as you ‘ can.”

that immediate action be taken-to

- cushion the shock to the economic life‘
of our community, state and nation."-

Appealing for support “to” a large

public projects,” the letter proposes as

_ a start towards such action “that meet-

ings be arranged so -that the repre-

The urgent need for such meetings
to be arranged and measures taken to
relieve the growing economic problem
is pointed up in the letter’s reference
to the Idaho Employment Security
Agency report on the total drop in em-

, ployment of 16.7 per cent in the dis-

trict since last year, as well as the
fact that most workers in the area have
now been cutdown to a five day work

here to break down the bars against’
the Negro citizen’s right to vote. In

League reported what some of its mem-
bers have faced-in trying to register
to vote. The letter was signed by As-
bury Howard as President,’and Rev.

The letter said, in part: _ .-

‘ The three-man Board of Registrars
was split _up-—two Board members
serving the whites and one. member
serving the Negroes, viz., Chairman
H. A. “Gus” Thompson.

The Negro people were kept in the

DEPRESSION is an ugly word.
1 Nobody should use it and say; ‘“It’s.here,

right now,” unless he can prove it»-— witlr

facts. I

There are many ugly facts which prove

~ depression is here for the non-ferrous metals

industry. .Let’s look at the key facts—- -.

Top economists. have beencarryingon a

-talky debate for months. . They’ve argued

about whether the‘ nation’s employment in
1954 will drop by 5 per cent or by 10 per cent. ;"
There’s no such debate in lead and. zinc min-
ing. There, employment has already fallen

by nearly 40 lper‘cen't, from the peak of last ~-

year.

These same economists say total national 1

production willl also drop by 5 or 10 per cent
-——maybe. Zinc mine production is already,

dropped 20 per cent and is still plummeting‘.

This depression has been iniitliemaking

' down 34 per cent. Lead mine production has _

for almost two years. Lead and zinc were the»

first to- feel its impact. Since April, 1952,
-zinc prices have fallen 51, per cent. Lead

prices thudded downward 32 per cent.

V All this happened‘ while the U.S. economy
as a whole was enjoying the greatest boom in
its history! _f* 1 . . ' * ~

that the crisis~was caused by any lack of

 Why the crisis ‘came    

Hour DID all this happen? ,
What became of those great “scarcities” of

l,non—ferrous metals that threatened our “na-

tional security”? . 
Not so long ago government agencieswere

" pleading with lead and ‘zinc miners to do every- .

I’

thing they could to increase production. Today, V ‘
most of thosefmines are shut down.

. ‘Not so long» ago. whole plants were shut
down’ or had, to hobble along because they

 ‘ couldn’t get enough metals. Any company that
- j wanted copper, lead or zinc had to file umpteen

forms, in triplicate, with various government“
agencies explaining why they needed the
metal, why they couldn’t use substitutes, how

I V . much they would need month by month. Now

you can’t get many of these same companies

‘to buy the metal, no matter how cheap the

price.
How could all these drastic changes take
place in less than two years? i ' '

The war economy i

The answer can be found in what happened

" in our over—all economy these last five years.

‘President Eisenhower _put it this way, in a

campaign speech at Peoria, I1l., October 2,
1952— i ‘ —  '
' “. . . Just as these war-bred. shortages
(of the first five years after” World War
II) began to disappear, and the economy
a was beginning to Weaken, along, came-
Korea. Defense production again propped

‘ up the economy.” , -

.Military needs, or what the military said

they needed, have been the basis for all gov-7
 ernment decisions on economic matters for
.- - many years. These needs also determined U.S.
T mineral policies. ' '

'Scarcity' was the cry

, Our war-based economy provided a perfect

4 backdrop for monopoly to-.extend its control

over mineral resources of the world. “We just.

_ ._ don’t have enough raw materials for our na-
tional security,” we were told. '

“Scarcity” became the battle—cry. And U.S.
mono-poly ‘corporations moved in, with govern-
mentﬂaid and support, to.take over new mines
in foreign countries.

'. Our government has spent‘ over $400 mil-
lion in loans and grants to push foreign mine

" 4 production. “Scarcity’*"was the excuse. Wages

Hit Grant County 

Grant County, New Mexico, was the fifth
largest zinc producingarea in the U. S. as re-

cently as 1951. The county’s mines produced.

nearly 42,000 tons of zinc that year.

Today, not a single lead ‘or zinc mine is
operating in Grant -County—.-or, in the whole
state of New Mexico.

Nearly 900 workers had jobs a couple of

years ago in Grant County’s lead—zinc mines
and mills. Now ‘most’ of them have drifted

away to look for jobs elsewhere. Theirmeager '

unemployment benefits didn’t last long. A few
workers, very ‘few, did manage to get other
jobs nearby. Others have‘ just hung on,

doubled up with relatives or on county relief. —

The county is now poorer by the,-lossiof
42,000 tons of.zinc annually—‘-and the payroll
that goes with that much production. It has

lost several hundred families. And it has many ’-
’ idle workers and relief cases.

The 42,000 tons of zinc once produced in
Grant county has been more than made _up by
increased imports. To take only one example,
Peru boosted its zinc shipments to U. S. by
more than 55,000 tons since 1951. '

Cerro de Pasco is Peru’s biggest’ zinc pro-
ducer. It accounts for above 80 .per cent of

that country’s output. Cerro de Pasco is _a._

. “foreign” company in the sense that it oper-
ates in South America, not in the U. S. But
it is owned by -U.S. interests. It is incorporated
in New York, state. ‘Sizeable chunks of its
stocks are owned by American Metal and
American Smelting and Refining companies.
Newmont Mining Company also owns an in-
terest in Cerro de‘ Pasco.

InA1951, the U. S. Export-Import Bank, a
government agency, made a $20,800,000 loan
to Cerro de Pasco to help finance a zinc ex-
pansion program. The zinc was needed, the
bank said, for “defense production.” That
money helped to step up the output of zinc,
which is now being dumped on the U. S.
market. , .

' Ameiiican Smelting & Refining Co., one of
"the owners of Cerro de Pasco, has now shut
down its mine and mill in Grant County, N. M.
Cerro de Pasco was paying its miners 58 cents
a day in 1949——the latpst year for which
figures are available. AS&R was paying its
Grant County miners ’,$l4.60 a day before it

  Reps. about Butler

NEW YORK, N. Y'.—An analysis or

it ‘the Butler bill, exposing its dangers

and urging its defeat, has been sent*by
Mine-Mill locals in the New York City-
New Jersey area to some 20 U. S. Con-
gressmen and Senators as a follow-up
on local legislations. ‘
A covering letter points outtliat “an
-:.-‘examination of this analysis will bon-
firm that the proposed measure would,
if enacted, work a grievous harm on
lmembers of all trade unions and, by

, vundercutting basic democratic rights,

O



would affect adversely the whole of
the American people.”

The analysis points «pp the purpose
of both the Butler—Miller bill (S 1606
and H. R. 4548) and the Goldwater-
Rhodes" bill (s 1254 and H. R. 3993)’
“to destroy workers’ free choice of their
unions and union officers through gov-
ernment licensing control of unions.”

“Since 1951,” the analysis declares,
"“a major drive has been under waylrby

the NAM, the Chamber of Commerce,
and major corporations to establish
government controls over unions that
would eliminate workers’ free choice of

. 1' their unions and officers. This push for

- repressive labor legislation which would
"destroy the democracy of the free
American. labor movement is being

- ‘camouflaged behind what the CIO Oil-'

. -workers Union recently called ‘a phony
V facade.of anti-communism.’ In spite of
their ~many differences and rivalries, all

ranks of organized labor are bitterly’

’ .-opposed to this effort to set up govern-
..§me1__1t~l,icensing of unions. These pro-
, posals‘ constitute the .foremost labor
“'”is's1ie'béfore Congress‘ in 1954. It is a

" ..-‘:“very.real and dangerous threat.” '

Support the Murray bill’

to raise minimum wage

WASHINGTON——Senator James E. Murray of Montana, ranking '

Democrat on the Senate labor committee, last week introduced a bill
to increase the minimum wage from its present 75c to $1.25 an hour.
The bill would also increase coverage of the minimum wage by several

million, Workers and eventually reduce the maximum workweek from ,
A 40. hours to 35.‘ - ' -' A '

Murray is also working with other Democrats in both houses on
proposals to prepare a federal public works program in case of con-

tinued economic slow-down. He expressed keen dissatisfaction with

the Eisenho-wer program for easingthe economic slump by cutting big

business taxes.

It is important that Mine—Mill locals should quickly come to the
support of Sen. Murray’s minimum-wage bill, one of the very few con-

structiveproposals to come before this session of Congress. Write to-
{your Senators and to Sen. Murray about it. Tell\them you intend to
support the public works legislation when I

WASHINGTON, D. C.—More anti-

A and depressiomwhile the Eisenhower

administration proceeds with its blue-

Big .business spokesmen in Congress
have launched a full-scale drive to get

The senate labor committee, to which
the Goldwater union-busting bill ‘ was
referred in the first session of the 83rd

' Congress last year, has already voted

to ask that it be discharged from fur-
ther consideration of the bill and thatjt

“ Union demands 
drop move againstTravis

The International Union last week
announced it has demanded, through

its General Counsel, that the NLRB.
withdraw its order on February 4 for.

an “administrative investigation” of
Taft-Hartley affidavits filed by ,Int’l
Secretary-Treasurer M. E. Travis.

The motion, filed with the Board in

‘Washington, D. C., by General Coun-

sel, Nathan 'Witt, asked that if the
order is notwithdrawn promptly, op-

‘ portunity be given to argue the de-

mand. for withdrawal before the Board
any time after February 15.
A .f‘The one and only basis for this

,Board order,” the Union commented in

announcing its action, “is a -statement
issued by Travis in August, 1949, when

he signed the first Taft-Hartley. affi-._

davit——a statement which“ is inaccur-

ately quoted and badly distorted.fin the_
Board ord/erof February 4, 1954. 1, '

“In any case, the Travis statement
was published in our Union’s newspa-
per in 1949,” the Union went on. “It
has been public knowledge ever since

. then»; It is ridiculous ~non'sense_ for the
‘V Board to claim it is acting now on the

basis of a statement that is nearly 5
years old, regardless of whether. the

' a (Board has the statement accurately or

not.  _

. ‘-‘The Board is well aware that since
1949', Secretary-Treasurer Travis has
filed no fewerjthan six, affidavits,” the
Union added. “Our current compliance
with ‘Taft-Hartley regulations is based
on affidavits filed. by Travis and other
Executive Board members in” Decem-
ber 1953. All this makes the 1949 busi:

’ press yprertty out-of,-date. 1 . « 

“We 3;,believe our 10_0,0.00 member;

r 1-». 4r'i 9- 2 .‘.

_will be i deeply: resentful‘ of the vicious‘; 1

  

suggestion made in the Board’s order
that the membership of the Union
since 1949 ‘was’ aware’ that all the
Travis affidavits were false. That is
an insult to the integrity’ and good

faith of every single member of our~

Union. Our tens of ', thousands of
members who live in the U. S., the
majority, of whom have ’re—elected
Travis three times since the 1949 af-
fidavit was sigxied, will’ consider this

1 aldirect attack on them and their hon-

- esty,”_the Union’s comment went on. ‘
“This attempt to get at the affi-
davit on the basis of a 5-year-old state-
ment,,made ‘separately from the affi-

davit, is obviously a back-doorlattempt '

to do what the Board cannot do via the
front‘ door." ’
' “We are assuring the members of
our Union that this latest NLRB ma-:
-neuver does not jeopardise their rep-
resentation by Mine—Mill in the slight-
est, despite the-distorted stories which
have’ appeared in many newspapers.”
The union’s motion contends that
‘both the District _'Court and Court of
Appeals in Washington, D.~ C., “have
decided that the Board is without power
to. determine whether_or not, affidavits
‘filed pursuant to Section 9h of ‘the
Taft-Hartley Act are false.” It de-
scribes the latest Board-I order as“im-
provident and oppressive.”
The Union said “We have instructed
our General" Counsel‘ to seek an in-

junction against this Boaid order. The -

District Court and the Court of Ap-

,peals in Washington have rebuffed, two

previous attempts of the Board to as-
sert this kind! of authority. We are
5confident the“same*courts will ‘hold

3 ._the Board {has =-abused. its» authority in

this .ca,se_, ’_too’.”

Cafholic magazine
blasts Butler bill a

A’ national Catholic magazine has
come out against the Butler bill. I .
_ The magazine “America,” a Catholic-
weekly review, condemned the Butler
bill as giving “irresponsibles”' the
opportunity “to bedevil industrial re-
lations by bringing groundless charges
of communism against unions.” }*7

In a recent issue, the Catholic pub-
lication said: I .

“The Butler bill provides that the
Subversive Activities Control Board
would Iruleson all charges of Commu-
nist domination (of unions). As soon
as a. complaint of Commum'st-domiuo‘,-
tion ‘has been filed against a, union,
its bargaining rights would be sus-
pended. They would /remain suspended

I

‘ until the Board handed down its ver-

dict. ‘Should it eventually, find‘ that
the charge is justified, the union may
appeal to the courts, the. union would
remain suspended. . This ‘ procedure

reverses the principle that 0, man is

innocent until proved guilty. It affords
endless opportunity for irrespousibles
to bedevil industrial relations by
bringing groundless chdrges of ‘com-
munism against unions.” A ’

froimjthe T-H law. It was indicated that 
p more drastic and far-reaching. provi-my
~ sions would be ‘prepared to take. the :

place of the affidavit. ..

IT WAS LEARNED that formal [ac-
tion by the labor‘ committee on the
Goldwater bill came several days after

the judiciary committee, already had‘

, begun consideration of the Goldwater‘ .

A task force spokesman said that
the Butler committee, set up to conduct ',

‘hearings on the bill introduced by its >
Senator Butler, will ‘ '

combine hearings on both the Gold-
water and Butler bills. After a series

' of executive sessions, the Butler com-

mittee will reopenpublic hearings in.
the next couple of weeks.

Transcripts of the Butler committee’s
first hearings, held in Pittsburgh, are
expected to be published soon. Although
the hearings were announced as legis- '
lative in character, witnesses observed
that they were actually. in the style of

the general anti-union witchhunts of

the McCarthy-McCarran-Jenner—Velde

committees. ~

.THE GOLDWATER .BILL in the

Senate and a companion measure intro-

duced in the House by Rep. John J.

Rhodes (R., Ariz.) were presentedglast

year at the beginning of the first ses-

sion of the 83rd Congress.

. When the bill stirred up universal‘
opposition from organized labor, Sena-

tor Butler of Maryland introduced hi.
bill, S 1606, claiming that ‘it was a.

compromise to soften the Goldwater

bill against unions. It’s provisions,

‘however, are essentially the s‘ame—-to

place unions under control of people\

.With the farm crisis getting worse,

’ the Eisenhower budget sets aside only
3.6 cents of the tax dollar for agricul-
