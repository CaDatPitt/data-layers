The Government and Labor

ANALYSIS OF GOVERNMENT ACTION ON SOCIAL
INSURANCE AND COLLECTIVE BARGAIN ING

By MARY VAN KLEECK
DIRECTOR 01-‘ INDUSTRIAL STUDIES, RUSSELL SAGE FOUNDATION

zfddress at Conference Called by flartford ‘Central Labor Union_.
Attended by Representatives of Trade Unions of the State,
for Discussion of Proposals for Forming a Connecticut

Labor Party June, 30, 1933

HIS seems to me, to be an historic occasion. Throughout the
country, as I have discovered in a recent journey from coast
to coast, proposals for 21 Labor Party are under discussion. But this
is the first time, so far as I know, that a state-wide conference has

been held to take deﬁnite action.
I am not here to give you advice as to what that action shall

be, but rather, on the basis of investigations of industrial rela— , _

tions during the economic crisis, to analyze the experience of the
labor movement in the program for social insurance and in federal
legislation for collective bargaining.

As a background, may I speak of the change which is occurring.

in the attitude of professional workers and so-called White-collar
workers toward trade-union organization? This is significant
because if the trade unions launch a Labor Party its program must
be such as to win the support of a much wider group, at present
outside the trade-union movement, including Workers in the
professions, white-collar workers, and in general the middle class

who can be strongly inﬂuenced by professional workers.

Already professional Workers are organized in unions affiliated
with the American Federation of Labor. Teachers in public
schools organized some time ago in the American Federation of
Teachers. The musicians have their trade union, as do other
professional groups. But during this economic crisis insecurity in

12

 

‘the professions is bringing many others to a realization of the
'necessity of some sort of economic program. Minority groups are
to be found in practically every major profession, and in some
instances these are pressing deﬁnitely for organization in affiliation

with the A. F./of L.
Among them is the Newspaper Guild, which elected at its

Convention in June officers who were pledged to the accomplish- .

ment of this affiliation. The newspaper men have come to this
decision, not out of sympathy for the labor movement or from
a detached interest in it, but because under federal legislation they
have had precisely the same experience as the coal miners, the
steel workers and the workers for munition-makers, such as those
in the Colt Firearms Company. In the Jennings case, the News-
paper Guild experienced discrimination for trade-union activities,
and they went through the process of having the case referred
to the National Labor Board, only to secure finally a decision
from the President that the Board did not have jurisdiction and
that the case should be referred to the publishers’ code authority,
made up wholly of publishers, with no representation of news-
paper workers. Similarly the strike of newspaper men employed
on the Newark Ledger has given this professional group ﬁrst—
hand experience which leads them to the labor movement because
they recognize a common interest with all other workers. '

INTER-PROFESSIONAL ASSOCIATION

Another evidence of the movement among professional workers
_is the organization of the Inter-Professional Association for Social

Insurance, which has supported the Workers’ Unemployment, I

Old Age, and Social Insurance Bill, H. R. 2827. The I.P.A. was
organized to bring the support of professional workers to indus-
trial workers and farmers in securing social insurance which should
be all~inclusive, since professional workers and the self-employed
are generally ‘excluded from the traditional forms of social in-
surance. But the I.P.A. has another purpose, which is growing
with experience—namely, to promote inter-professional co-opera-
tion in all matters of economic protection, but, again, to do so in
relation to the labor movement. as a whole. There is little doubt
that if the trade unions launch a Labor_ Party they will find that

...- . ..............7~n.uw,u.:.,_—»

1.».-am-~g-._<, k,.....r~.».,.,, ......  ....-_~..._s

these professional workers who are already turning to the labor
movement in their common interest with industrial workers will
be active allies in political effort.

Why should a Labor Party be proposed at this time? May it
not be asked whether the passage of the Economic Security Act
and of the Wagner Labor Disputes Act does not signfy that al-
ready in the. present Administration labor is securing such legis-
lation as it advocates? VVhy, then, does this demand for a Labor
Party arise in so many parts of the country? The answer, in
brief, is to be found in the fact that in the day—to-day struggles
in the workshop the trade unions are ﬁnding themselves affected
vitally by legislation and by its administration. This doubtless
is the reason why the proposers of a new Labor Party ask that it
.should grow out of the day-to-day struggles and be directed toward
a program arising out of them, based upon the trade unions and
not upon a party which seeks merely to win the votes of labor
by putting forward a program appearing in words to respond to
their demands but having no responsibility to the trade unions for
fulﬁlment of the program.

CONFLICT IN GOVERNMENT

It should be recognized at the outset that governmental action
arises out of a threefold pressure from conflicting interests.
Government is a phase of the community, and, like the community,
it is a house divided against itself. First is the conflict between

labor and employers in industry. The existence of this conﬂict.

needs no demonstration to a trade union group. But it is not
always recognized in the trade unions that this conflict is reflected
in all legislation and in its administration. Always the stronger
influence is that inherent in economic ownership, that is, in the
employer group.

The conflict is, however, tempered by the third element, namely,
the interest of the political administration to keep itself in power
by winning the votes of labor. Hence concessions are made to
the labor group, but always the group in conﬂict seeks to resist
legislation in the interest of labor, or, if such legislation is passed,
tries to defeat it through failure of enforcement, or ﬁnally the
Supreme Court may declare it unconstitutional. This conﬂict

14

\

and its results for labor are clearly illustrated in the recent ex-
periences of the trade unions with legislation for social security
and for the guarantee of collective bargaining.

The history of social insurance is an illustration of legislation.
put forward to appeal to labor, giving, however, only the form
and not the substance. In the last session of Congress, in the
spring of 1934, there had been introduced the Wagner-Lewis bill
for social insurance, similar to the Economic Security Act which
has just been passed. In the same session, in February, 1934, the
Workers’ Unemployment, Old Age, and Social Insurance Bill,
numbered then H. R. 7598, had been introduced by Congressman
Lundeen. The Wagner-Lewis bill, though presumably backed by
the administration, was not pushed by the party in power nor by
the President. The demands of the trade unions and other work-
ers’ organizations for the Workers’ Bill were, however, extensive,
and by the middle of June, 1934, it was evidently -realized that
Congressmen returning to campaign for re-election would be con-
siderably embarrassed if they had to give the reasons why no social
insurance measure had been passed in the first Congress of the
New Deal. .

Early in June, 1934, the President therefore gave them a con-
venient piece of paper to take home, in the form of his message
on economic security, in which he declared that security must be
established for every man, woman and child in the country, and

«that as part of this program there must be social insurance. He

announced that he was appointing a committee to study the sub-
ject and to bring in a program at the next session.

DEMANDS or EMPLOYERS

Meanwhile, in December, 1934, there met at White Sulphur
Springs representatives of the National Industrial Conference
Board and the National Association of Manufacturers, who laid
down their demands regarding -relief and social insurance. The
federal government must quit this business of relief, they said, in
effect. Such help as must be given should be in the form of work
relief, and at wages lower than those in private industry. As for
social insurance, it could not apply anyway to the present unem-
ployed, and therefore there was no hurry about it, and it was sug-

gested that American industry should study the subject of
establishing reserves. \

Faced with these demands and at the same time with the de-
mands which had centered around the Workers’ Bill, the P_resident
worked out a compromise on the social insurance program recom-
mended by the experts appointed to study it. The compromise
arranged for old-age pensions, with an appropriation from the
federal treasury to take care of the present aged. Thereafter
funds are to be raised by a tax on payrolls and by a tax on wages.
Unemployment insurance is to be provided by a tax on payrolls,
and if a state wishes it there may also be a tax on each w0rker’s
wages.

Both measures depend upon the passage of state laws. Both
pass the burden of old age and unemployment back to the worker,
who as consumer pays in higher prices for the tax on payrolls and
as worker faces in every wage negotiation the added labor costs
imposed by the payroll tax, which thus keeps wages down while
at the same time raising prices. In any gvent, the bill applies
only to a limited group, excluding those in plants employing less
than ten, domestic workers and agricultural Workers, government
employes, public school teachers and many others; and it does not
apply to any of the present unemployed.

New York State is an example of the limitations, for it has
already passed a law to put the federal law into operation. New
York will begin collecting taxes on March 1, 1936, but no‘social
insurance will become available until 1938. It will then cover
not more than 50 per cent of wages for approximately ten to
fifteen weeks in the year. It will not be paid in the first three
weeks of unemployment. Thus it will be possible to lay off
workers for two and one—half weeks without payment of social
insurance beneﬁts and then take them back andlay oﬁ” another
group, thus going through a period of unemployment without
paying anything to the unemployed. Moreover, the waiting period
must be ten weeks in case of discharge for misconduct or in a
strike.

PoLI'r1cIAN's "SOCIAL INSURANCE”

Thus the President, representative of the interest of a political

16

$1

  -;-_}-_.l

I

party to keep itself in power, has devised a social insurance law
which appears to put social insurance into "effect, and yet serves
substantially the interests of those who wish to avoid all claims
for social insurance from the federal treasury and from higher
taxation. To be sure, the employing groups. are opposing even
this form of social insurance. They do so because they want no

social insurance at all; and there are trade unionists who say

that if the employers are against it, it must be in the interest of
labor. But it is not always safe to assume that a measure opposed
by employers will be to the advantage of the workers. Employers
would prefer no unemployment insurance, but once it is establish-
ed, prices can be readjusted so as to avoid burdens upon proﬁts
and higher incomes. .

In contrast with this bill is the VVorkers’ Bill, which will re-
main an issue before the country until a genuine social insurance
measure is enacted. The VVorkers’ Bill puts forward clear-cut
and simple demands. It would give to all workers who are in-
voluntarily unemployed average local wages for the entire period
of unemployment; and it would take funds for this from the
federal treasury from taxes on higher incomes of individuals and
corporations, from inheritances and gifts, and from other sources,
such as the accumulated undivided surpluses of industry. Thus it
would transfer funds from channels of investment to channels of
purchasing power, and at once it sets up the claim for higher
income taxes on those who are able to pay.

WORKERS" BILL CONSTITUTIONAL

Moreover, this bill stands out as constitutional. The railroad
men are finding this out. The Railroad Pension Act was declared
unconstitutional in l\/Iay by the Supreme Court on the ground
that the tax on payrolls was taking property Without due process
of law. The same tax device is found in the Economic Security
Act, and it is altogether probable, therefore, that it may be declared
unconstitutional. Meanwhile Senator Wagner, putting forward
a proposal for a new Railroad Pension Act, is suggesting that
taxes be paid directly to the federal treasury and that the benefits
be paid by the federal treasury, thus using almost the very words
of the Workers’ Bill and incidentally supporting it by a declara-

17

tion that Congress has the power to tax for the federal treasury
and to appropriate funds, these being the grounds of constitution-
ality of the Workers’ Bill. In addition, the income tax, which is
a suggested source of funds for insurance under the Workers’
Bill, is already in the Constitution.

The Workers’ Bill, in short, will remain an issue challenging /

the government to this measure of compensation for insecurity in
American industry and at the same time demanding increase in
taxes on higher incomes. The effects of this demand are already
evident in the President’s announcement promising higher taxes
on higher incomes of individuals and corporations. This reflects
the demands centering around the Workers’ Bill, and yet it by no
means provides any gains for labor. It is only a political promise.
It applies only to annual incomes of a million dollars or more.
This does. not mean Wealth, but income. And because of limitation
to a very few, the total amount collected would be comparatively
small. Nothing is said as to how this money would be used. It
is not intended for social insurance. Probably it would go to
provide more funds for war purposes. And though at first put

forward for immediate passage, step by step it is now being with- V

drawn, in the hope, however, of its having a political effect in
rallying support to the Democratic Party.

RESULTS or LABoR’s DEMANDS

It should be noted that the campaign for the Workers’ Bill
has had deﬁnite results, and it should not be overlooked that as
many as 52 Congressmen actually voted for the Workers’ Bill
as an amendment to the Economic Security Bill when it was
before the House. This is an astonishing number in a Congress
elected as was this one, by the old parties," and indicates how
already the demands of labor can influence even those whogare not
directly responsible to labor in a political party with a labor
program.

The whole experience with the guarantee for collective bar-
gaining as enacted in the National Industrial Recovery Act il-
lustrates again the conflict of interest and the weakness of labor
in legislation and in its administration. I need not do more than
sum up this experience. It is familiar to all of you. You know

18

the growing disappointment of labor as Section 79., which was
supposed to guarantee Collective bargaining, received no real sup-
port and no genuine enforcement at the hands of the Administra-
tion. Every major case carried to the I/Vhite House was decided
against labor. No major case was decided and enforced in favor
of labor.

But what may not be widely known among the worker is the
 origin of Section 7a in the National Industrial Recovery Act. It
I should be recalled that when this act was proposed in the spring
1' of 1933 there had been built up widespread demands on the part
 of the workers and the trade unions for the Black thirty-hour

bill. It was an active political issue, supported by the vigorous
demand of the American Federation of Labor, voiced by its
president in the preceding convention.

There had been growing in American industry during the
preceding ten years the active wish to secure the repeal of anti-
trust laws. Trade associations had received substantial support
from the Administration, particularly during Mr. Hoover’s regime
as Secretary of Commerce and as President. Trade associations
frequently held conferences at the Department of Commerce, and
in many instances they collected statistical material used by the

~ Government. But so far it was all on a voluntary basis, and no
proposal had been made by M1‘. Hoover to give them legislative
status.

BIRTH OF THE N.R.A.

In the spring of 1933 the United States Chamber of Com-
merce held a. meeting in Washington, and it is known that at
that time the demand for “self-government” by industry came to
a head and the members of the Chamber of Commerce made
known to the President that they wanted such legislation to free
them from anti-trust laws and to permit them to govern them-
selves in a recovery program, and that they wanted something done
to stop the agitation for the thirty-hour bill. Thus ‘emerged the

~ plan for the National Industrial Recovery Act. Its central point

is that it gave to industry the right to act through trade associa-

tions, which would draw the codes and afterward become the

i » enforcing authorities. The quid pro quo for labor was Section 7a,

19

i .

which labor believed would guarantee the right of collective bar-
gaining and establish minimum wages and maximum hours.

At once it became clear that American industry would sub-
stitute the company union for the trade union, as fulﬁlling Sec-
tion 7a. The National Industrial Conference Board issued a
pamphlet entitled Collective Bargaining Through Employees’
Representation. “Employees’ representation” is the term used
for company unions. When the steel code was proposed in Wash-
ington, it contained such a plan for ‘employees’ representation;
and in the automobile code Section 7a was nullified by the merit
clause, which prevented any charge of discrimination for trade-
union activities because it explicitly gave to the ‘employer the right
to hire, fire and promote for individual merit.

l\/Iruu: Pm.‘-.VIISF..s'

In the administration of Section 721 you know the whole story.
You know how organization spread in response to it and strikes
were declared, calling for recognition of the union in fulﬁlment
of the law. These strikes would be called off with the promise
of an election. The elections, probably in the great majority of
cases, resulted in the choice of the trade union, but the trade
union would then be met b_v the employer’s statement that the
act did not require him to recognize the union; and the decisions
of the National Labor Board in favor‘ of recognition of the union
were not enforced, or were carried to the courts, as in the Weirton
steel case, in which the District Court of Delaware decided in
favor of the company union.

These disappointments led leaders of labor to conclude that
the trouble was with the lack of enforcing power. Hence their
support of the \Vagner Labor Disputes Bill. But let me point
out that that bill merely makes permanent the disappointments
of labor with Section 7a. It speaks of dealing with a labor or-
ganization as a fair practice in industry, but it deﬁnes a labor
organization as any employees’ representation committee or plan
or any other form of organization. Furthermore, as laying the
basis for constitutionality, the act in its statement of purpose
declares that a strike interrupts commerce and hence jurisdiction
is to be given to a National Labor Board to intervene in any

20

 . D_...$

labor dispute likely to lead to a strike. l\/Ioreover, ﬁnal settlement
is given to district courts.

VVAGNER LABOR DISPUTES BILL

The failure to secure enforcement of Section 7a is a measure
of the political weakness of the Labor groups. The Wagner
Labor Disputes Bill likewise will be an instrument used against

" Au~2;-1:-rear->«.-y.,.............,. . ‘Ha;

labor to stop strikes and to establish the company union, unless -

meanwhile labor’s political strength can be made eﬁective enough
to influence enforcement. Thus it is that a law may be passed
which appears to fulfill promises to labor, but in the conflict of
interest labor’s comparative weakness is measured by the form
of legislation which defeats the essential demands; by failure to
enforce; and ultimately by a Supreme Court decision declaring a
troublesome law unconstitutional. Again in the VVagner Labor
Disputes Bill labor saw the Chamber of Commerce and the manu-
facturers opposing it, and was led thereby to believe all the more
that it would be to the advantage of labor. And yet it should
always be remembered that this opposition is but the first step,
and that beyond it is the possibility of so interpreting a law as
to turn it against labor. This will happen with the VVagner
Labor Disputes Act, unless the labor movement is strengthened.
The position of the labor movement throughout this Adminis-

' tration is clearly seen to be that of a constant petitioner before the

government in Washington. The codes have been drawn by the
trade associations. The Administration never suggested that pre-
ference would be given to codes drawn through negotiations be-
tween trade associations and trade unions. Instead, the trade
unions could only make their protests at public hearings after
codes were drawn by the trade associations.

I recall as an example the experience of the representative of
the machinists’ union, who \vas obliged to appear at practically
all hearings in Washington in the hot summer of 1933, because
machinists are to be found in so many industries. Always it was
merely a protest at a hearing on a code already drawn, asking
for higher minimum wages and shorter hours and other condi-
tions for the machinists. But it was only a petition. Again,
lacking any representation on code authorities, the trade unions

21

have had to be petitioners on all points affecting them in the
administration of codes. I I

SIGNIFICANCE ‘OF LABOR MOVEMENT

The crisis reveals the signiﬁcance of the labor movement for
the American people as a whole. I wonder if you trade unionists
can see yourselves as others see you. I refer to the views of those

‘ who see in this present crisis that the only sound way out for
civilization is the way which has for its objective the raising of

standards of living through the full utilization of productive
capacity. There is only one organized movement which has as
its constant objective and its day-to-day effort the purpose of
raising standards of living, and that is the labor movement.
Support for the labor movement, therefore, by the American
people in a program such as a Labor Party might advocate is not
merely in the interest of the labor movement narrowly conceived,
but in the interest of the whole society.

A contrasting way out is to restrict production in order to keep
up prices and maintain profits, and this restriction of production
is always against the interests of the community as a Whole and
particularly against the interests of the workers, because it results
in lowering the workers’ standards of living. We ﬁnd this
restriction of production reflected in the agricultural program and

also in the powers given to industry to govern itself and to control '

its markets. Along with these restrictions goes the constant effort
to cut wages and thus to lower living standards.

ACTION ON THE POLITICAL FIELD

It is in these wage cuts that the wholeproblem for labor, both
economically and politically, is to be found. The forces which are
seeking to lower standards of living as "the way out of the economic
crisis can accomplish this end only if the labor movement be
weakened in every possible way.- Hence the drive for company
unions and for the denial of civil liberties and all the additional
legislation put on the statute books and all the unjust enforce-
ment of laws which tend to restrict human rights and therefore
to hamper workers in freedom of organization. It is important
clearly to see that all this legislation and all these developments

22

L-,1-,a:m§__ .‘_ .

in governmental organization have their origin in just this conﬂict
of interest over Workers’ living standards. Hence it is that the
trade unions in their day-to—day struggle to resist wage reductions
come face to face with the struggle not only in the Workshop
against their own employer, but on the political ﬁeld» against gov-

‘ ernmental restrictions on the very existence of trade unions.

Vital issues for American civilization center in the Workers’
day-to-day struggles to maintain their standards of living. The
task of a Labor Party is to center the political program around
these day-to-day struggles, to keep both the program and the
political leadership responsive and responsible directly to the
Workers’ organizations for their immediate economic interests,
broadly conceived as the basis for the standards of living for all
workers, industrial, agricultural and professional. Upon these

‘living standards, civilization itself is based.

What You Should Do

A SPLENDID beginning towards the formation of a Con-
A necticut Labor Party has been made. Too much emphasis,
however, cannot ‘be placed on the fact that we have only begun. ‘
To realize our aim, certain concrete tasks must be undertaken by
every A. F. of L. local in the State. These tasks are as follows:

1. ,A. F. of L. Committees for the Promotion of a Labor
Party should be set up in every city and town.

2. Every local should discuss and endorse the Labor Party
and send oﬂicial copies of the endorsement to the Connecticut
American Federation of Labor Committee for the Promotion of
a Labor Party, 97 Park Street, Hartford.

3. A. F. of L. Committees in each city should canvass all
organizations which are ready to join the move for a Labor Party.
These include groups of Veterans, Farmers, Negroes, small home 9,
owners, taxpayers, ‘professionals, fraternal, religious organiza-
tions, organizations of the unemployed, and workers, political
organizations. 4

4. Intensive educational work must be carried on in every a
community. There is a tremendous amount of interest in this
movement, and lectures, symposiums, and discussions can be ar-
ranged with no difﬁculty. Information and speakers may be ob-
tained upon application to the Committee.

5. All locals are urged to obtain copies of this pamphlet for
distribution in shops and organizations in their vicinity.
Pamphlets, which should be sold for three cents, may be obtain-
ed from the Committee at the rate of $2.00 per hundred.

To Every Union Man

By WILLIAM E. KUEHNEL

PRESIDENT, HARTFORD CENTRAL LABOR UNION

HE Connecticut American Federation of Labor Conference
for the Formation of a Labor Party Was called by the Hart-
ford Central Labor Union. The call was issued upon the complete
realization of the failure of labor’s official ‘political policy—
that of rewarding its friends, and punishing its enemies. Bitter
experience in the Colt Fire Arms strike, and in the strike of our
brothers in the Textile Unions, demonstrated clearly that this
traditional policy meant that We played right into the hands of
either the Democrats or the Republicans. Neither party is,sin-
cerely interested in Working with us or for us—they Want only
our votes to put their men into oﬂice. The result has been a
tragedy, as far as labor is concerned. The reason is not hard to
find: the Democratic and Republican Parties are in the hands
of the employers, and represent their interests, not ours.

If you need evidence of this, see if there has been any genuine
legislation in Connecticut in behalf of workers and the .unem-

ployed. Have any laws been passed dealing with unemployment ,

insurance, shorter Work week without pay cuts, rights of Workers
to organize, etc.? Instead, we have the so-called “Old Age Pen-
sion Bill,” passed by the last session of the Legislature, which is
nothing but an economy measure which will be paid for by a

head tax, and which evenithen will be very inadequate. There’

are other reasons why the old hook-up with the old parties has
been a bad thing. We have elected governors and mayors who
have used the state militia (textile strike) and the police (Colt
strike and in many other cases) against us While we were trying
to get a decent living wage; and attempts are being made every

3

day to interfere with our constitutional rights of free speech and
assembly. ~

We in Hartford felt the full effect of the present political
set—up when, in the Colt strike, the Government refused to en-
force Section 7:1; our brothers in the textile unions not only
had similar experiences, but had to contend with the State Militia,
called out by a man elected to oﬂice as a “friend of labor”. This
is not the place to deal in detail with these struggles, but it was
our experiences in these strikes that led to a preliminary conference
in Hartford on the part of those active in the Colt and textile
strikes. Atithis conference we decided to issue the call for a state-
wide meeting of American Federation of Labor locals on the
subject of forming a Labor Party. The meeting was called with
the idea of uniting all working class elements into a political
group which could give concrete and effective expression to the
needs and desires of labor.

The response to this call, which is described in the pages which
follow, is overwhelming evidence of that fact that the working
class of this state is prepared to support a Connecticut Labor
Party! We call upon you for your immediate support and
action in this momentous undertaking.

Laying the Foundation

NEW chapter in American labor history was written at
Hartford on Sunday, June 30, 1935, when representatives of
150 Connecticut Federation of Labor locals, meeting under the
auspices of the Hartford Central Labor Union, unanimosuly voted
for the formation of a Connecticut Labor Party, anti-capitalist in
nature, to be based on trade unions and other mass organizations.
More than 41,000 Connecticut trade unionists were represented
by 165 registered representatives from 31 Connecticut cities and
towns, the Central Labor Union of Danbury, VVate1'bury, Hart-
ford, New Britain, Meriden, and New London also being oth-
cially represented. Sixteen independent locals, with a member-
ship of 14,200, sent their delegates, and pledged!’ support.
The meeting, in the words of its principal speaker, was of a
“historic r.-ature,” in that it was the first state-wide meeting of
unions called to consider the formation of 21 Labor Party. That
it was highly successful is indicated not only by the attendance,
but by the spirit of the delegates and ‘the plans which have been
formulated for the future. Machinery to continue and broaden
the work of the first session has been set up; a beginning has been
made. Upon the work done in all of the locals, in other organ-
izations, and by individuals, depends the success of this movement.

The purpose of the Conference, as is now well known, was to
establish the Connecticut Federation of Labor as the basis of a
Connecticut Labor Party. With this foundation, it is planned
to contact the various groups in the state who are disgusted with
the Democratic and Republican Parties, and who are prepared
for independent political action. This will unite all other trade
unions such as independent bodies, railroad brotherhoods; other
existing working class political organizations, and farmers, work-
ers, Negro, and Veterans’ organizations, as well as professional
groups sympathetic to labor. VVhen such mass support is developed,
we will be prepared to launch a state-wide Labor Party. Prior to

. that time, however, the Conference voted to’ support labor tickets

in cities and towns where a united labor front is established.

Program for a Labor Party

HE program and platform of the Connecticut Labor Party
was clearly outlined in the following resolution, which was
unanimously adopted by the Conference:

RESOLUTION
“WHEREAS, it is becoming plain to labor that after ﬁve

years of economic crisis, its conditions of life have been growing
worse, and that the old political parties, the Republican and
Democratic, clearly represent the interests of the wealthy em-
ployers, bankers and others who live off the toil of labor;

“WHEREAS, the trade union movement of the state of Con-
necticut realizes now that labor must depend on itself on the
political field to resist the new attacks of capital, through its own
independent political action;

“WHEREAS, any further support by labor of the two old
political parties dominated by, and acting for, the employers, would
be to the greatest detriment of the workingmen, as shown by the
fact that no real legislation favorable to labor has been adopted
by the politicians of these parties;

“WHEREAS, the very legislative measures adopted by the
last legislative session palmed off on us such an ‘old age pension
bill’ which in reality is an "economy measure to be paid for by
a head tax on the working people, instead of by taxation of the
wealthy; and furthermore, a special session of the legislature
threatens to put over a sales tax burden on the working people
of this state;

“WHEREAS, this legislative offensive against labor goes hand
in hand with continuous reduction in rates of pay on relief pro-
jects, persistent chiseling of labor’s conditions, attacks on trade
union rights, the increased use of the police and national guard
against strikes for better conditions (textile, etc.), failure on the
part of the administration to enforce Federal legislation for col-
lective bargaining, as in the Colt Fire Arms case;

6

“VVHEREAS, this all emphasizes now more than ever the fact
that labor must stand on its own feet politically; and

“WHEREAS, such independent political action could best»
be realized by the formation of 3. Labor Party based primarily
upon the American Federation of Labor Trade Unions through-
i ‘ out the state of Connecticut, uniting further all other trade
T unions, such as independent bodies, railroad brotherhood, and other
‘1 existing working class political organizations, Negro organiza—
T tions, professional groups sympathetic to labor, etc.

“BE IT THEREFORE RESOLVED, that this conference
called by the Central Labor Union of Hartford and vicinity, here-
by favors the formation of such a Labor Party. This conference
calls upon labor of the state henceforth to end the traditional
practice of the organized labor movement of ‘punishing its enemies
and rewarding its friends,’ on the Republican and Democratic
tickets which have been traditionally enemies of the laboring people;

“BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the delegates. here
assembled from all parts of the state of Connecticut go on record
' for the formation of such an anti-capitalist Labor Party, organ-
ized by the trade unions and other working class organizations,
and sympathetic professional people, farmers, and Negro organ-
izations. Such a Labor Party to be actively built and supported
by the whole labor movement for the purpose of creating a mighty
: weapon in the fight against wage cuts, company unions, and to
achieve genuine unemployment and social insurance at the expense
of the employers and the wealthy; for the immediate cash pay-
ment of the bonus by taxation of the rich; for the thirty-hour Week,
without pay reductions, for the defense of civil rights of the
workers; for the defense of the trade unions against employers’
attacks; for the right to organize and strike; against company
unions; against the use of police and National Guard in strikes;
against taxation of the toilers and farmers, but for the taxation
of the wealthy to meet the needs of the unemployed and labor
growing out of the capitalist induced crisis; against the threat of
- fascism which endangers the labor movement, and against the

threat of a new world war.
“BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that to realize these aims,

this conference hereby elects a committee to be known as the

.-_.__ ,.__v V _.____. ____._T _.._.._ -_. L” _

, r-r
l I

Connecticut Federation of Labor Committee for the Promotion
of a Labor Party. This conference further empowers the said
committee to initiate a referendum in all A. F. of L. local unions

on this question, also in all other organizations which it sees fit,-

with the aim of carrying on an educational and organizational

campaign to lead to the earliest formation of such a party needed -

and desired by labor. The Committee further urges the delegates
to get their locals to instruct delegates to the State Convention of
the A. F. of L. to vote for a Labor Party. The Committee is
also authorized to solicit all affiliated organizations within the
Connecticut Federation of Labor to pledge support and co—opcra-
tion in the founding of 21 Labor Party. The Committee is em-
powered to call public meetings, issue publications, hold discussions
in local unions, and other organizations to further this aim.

“BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that to facilitate its ob-
jective, the delegates to this conference are urged on their return
to their localities immediately to propose and work for ‘the forma-
tion of local labor party organizations, or in the preparation for
the coming municipal elections, to begin the creation of united
labor tickets, on the general principles of the Labor Party enun-
ciated in this resolution.

“BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that this Committee be
empowered to call a State Convention when it shall deem ﬁt after
carrying on the tasks outlined in this resolution for the organiza-
tion of a State Labor Party at the earliest possible time, and

“BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that this Conference. is
prepared to support the movement for and the actual organization
of a Labor Party on a national scale based upon these principles.”
