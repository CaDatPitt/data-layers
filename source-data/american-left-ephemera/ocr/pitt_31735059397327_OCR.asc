' the shooting.

On September 13, the State moved in, by order

I u of Rockefeller ‘and the blessings of Nixon. Over, .
' 1,000 state troopers, prison guards and national ‘

guardsmen, along with sharpshooters ﬂying low in
helicopters burst into the prison area held by the

prisoners. With no regard for the -hostages’. safety, ..
. - Rockefellers’ army ﬁred indiscriminately at
- anything that dared to. move. When the smoke

cleared, 32 inmates and 9 hostages were dead, with
some 300,.wounded.. « _' g . _
.0 To cover up the incident of the dead hostages,

' _i Oswald claimed that ,9 of the dead guards had

their throats slashed bytthe prisoners righttbefore
ll hours later, the autopsy report by Dr. John"
Edlund proved that all of the hostages “died of

gunshot wounds. There was no evidence of slashed V

throats.” . ' -
The only people who had guns were the police;
Despite the S_ta_te’s lying, it was clear to many

people that the prisoners and guards “were killed
by bullets that had the name Rockefeller on

them,”

_ There are many lessons to be learned and
-understood from the heroic Attica rebellion; The .
unity of prisoners, the ﬁght to defeatracism and A
apathy, as well as the developing consciousness of‘
prisoners about their common oppression and how -

to_ﬁght it. The prisoners at Attica understood that
they were challenging an entire system of

oppression and came to see themselves for what _

they’. were-political prisoners. Their demand for
political. refuge. in a “non-_imperialist country”
showed“ that.they did not consider what they were

‘ doing -to "be a senseless, criminal act, but political

. liberation from, an unjust system.-

‘ ~.Attica was just "one chapter in the developing-'

. struggle  against "prison oppression. ‘George -
. Jackson’s murder spurred the ‘prisoners’ on. and _
_,streng_htened their _determination to overcome all
Yobstacles andvhold strong in their just fight.

George Jackson showed that . the only way for

' prisoners to acheivea solid force for fighting back

was to see the struggle as,a class strugglefnot a race:

 war, It was the oppressed "class of prisoners fighting
the oppressing ruling class of ‘the US. ‘ .

‘Previously, ‘all prison rebellions were between

- inmates; white against Black. The prison authorities '
".didn’t worry ..a bit. ;-_F__or example, in 1925.. San
Quentin prison was the scene‘ of a bloody series of -V

riots between- Chicanos and :whites ._that_ resulted in

six deaths. All this ' went. on while the guards ,

"looked on smiling.  .:  .

The arrival‘-of the .1..960’s', brought thearrival of t i

a’ fast,-"growing, ‘non-white prison population.‘ Black
and ‘Brown prisoners were ‘beginning to develop

political awareness. "They were beginning to

understand that they weren’t really the criminals,
but that they were the victims of an unjust society

that, because of its need to make money, forced ‘ I

people to commit crimes. The brutality, the
insults, the open racism, and the whole
dehumanizing process only led these new prisoners
to the finalconclusion that their only hope lies in
resistance. ' ‘ ‘ . ’ .

To understand.Attica fully, means to discover.

the real. role of prisons in our society and what ; 0
‘ exactly their purpose -is.» - ' ‘ ‘

0 ROLE op PRISONS IN CAPITALIST SOCIETY_ ‘
_ The real: role and purpose of prisons in capitalist ‘
, society can be broken down into two statements;

1-The prison is a tool used by the rich to keep their

power over the poor, to keep the order, and, 2éThe 
prison "provides a source of cheap labor‘ which 

makes more money for the-capitalists.

victims.

“Frederich Engels(a German ‘social,-scientist
and writer of A the Communist Manifesto)
observed over a century ago that along with the
army and the police, prisons are the most essential
instruments of State power. The prospect of long
prison terms is meant to preserve order; it is
supposed to serve as a Athreatto anyone who dares
disturb existing social relations, whether by failing
to observe the sacred rules of PROPERTY or by
challenging the right of an unjust system of racism
and domination to function -smoothly”.
. A Angela Davis
A Law and order is the line the State pushesAall
the time on poor and working people. The ruling

class pushes the line that the system(of capitalism) '

is fine and" basically a good one, and the few

morally unfit people in society must be isolated.

and kept away from the general population in
order‘ to preserve this‘_‘free~ society.”They maintain
that there are- no prisons in ‘the U.S., just
“correctional facilities”.

All‘ the big books on criminology that the
Government’s agents, as well - as the
government-controlled media put out try hard to
instill in the minds of the masses the idea that the“
prisoners are mentally defective, and the prison
system is not at fault. But the population of U.S.
prisons clearly shows that this theory is a lie. Over
50% of the’ prisoners in U.S. jails are Black and
Brown poor people, even though Blacks, Puerto-
Ricans and Chicanos represent only 15% of the
population. A . ‘ ' '

In California, the total - “inmate
population(including reformitories, county jails
and federal and state prisons) is 50,000.

Another fact is that. over 52% of all these
people in U.S. jails have not been convicted of any
crime, but simply cannot afford to post bail. As a
result of their inability to pay, they must spend
months and even years in prisons and jails awaiting
trials. ‘ ~ '

It is the poor and working people who suffer as

a result of the U.S. prison system. You’ll never see-
Rockefeller or any of his kind in prisons, only their

The courts are also a tool used by the rich to
beat back the poor and railroad them to jail.

In Oklahoma, for example, a man was given
forty-ﬁve years in jail ‘for stealing ONE'cow! In
that same area, a banker was given three years for
stealing" $750,000. As another example, a Chicago
judge gave a man convicted‘ of a $13 robbery a
sentence of from five to fifteen years in jail, while‘
three rich businessmen, who kept $2,000,000 of

customers’ money got only a small fine and a

suspended sentence.

«The- prison system is a‘ necessary part of
capitalist class society. All of the horrible
conditions, the brutality, the oppression and

considered ‘a-human being. A

injustices are all major parts of the system that

helps to keep the system going .the way it is. These"

conditions can’t be ended by reforming the system,
because they are not minor errors or mistakes, bu
are a basic and vital part of the system. A . =

In other systems, where prisons are not an '

instrumentof class oppression, we ﬁnd a-different
type of prison structure. For example, in many

A countries  Africa and Asia, they have a systemof ‘
“djemaasZ’where thosepeople who commit crimes.
against the common good of all are brought before A

the whole village “ or tribe, criticized openly and

educated to see the mistakes he or she has made. ‘*3

In socialist ’countries. prisons are used to

A A rehabilitate prisoners, not jail them. "Most prisons "

are camps where the only difference between the
prison and the outside are the guards and

sometimes a f_ence_. Political. leaders live and work V .
with the ‘prisoners to show them how a collective *

society works for _the. good of all. They have’
visitation rights and are given leaves regularly
during their ‘stay in prison. In some camps the
whole ‘family‘lives' together and only theindividual

who committed the crime has restrictions. This . I

type of rehabilitation is-very successful inreturning
the prisoner ‘to a normal ‘life ’ and helping the
prisoner to correct- his". or her mistakes against
society. In Asocialist countries such as China, a

prisoner is just _someone whohas committed an act
' that was against the welfare of the people. A

prisoner is, never treated as ‘an animal but is still

  

PRISONS . ARE MAXIMUM SECURITY
F ACTORIES -. V c

Prisons are maximum security factories, where
inmates are paid as little as 8 cents an hour for a
hard days work. In fact, prisons are one of the
most productive industries in this society.

_ Soledad Brother John Cluchette has noted,
“The prison system should be abolished because it
is a system designed and constructed to warehouse
the people of undeveloped and lower economical
communities. Under the existing social order men

. and women are sent _to prison for labor (free labor)

to further the economical gain (money) ‘by the
State.”

In such _ places as Cummins prison farm in
Arkansas, prisoners are forced to pick cotton for 2

cents a bushel from sun-up to sun-down 7' days a..

week. Other prison farms lease inmates out to
work in other industries, politicians, planters,
mining firms and big Northern syndicates for
somehting like 30 years of labor. This free forced
slave labor of inmates reaps big proﬁts for the rich
capitalists. -. .

This system of exploitation has its roots in the
years after the Civil War. At that time, the former
slaveowners and farmers were forced to free their

"slaves and so had to look elsewhere ‘ for a new

source of cheap labor power. Prisons provedto be
the answer. \In Arkansas and North Carolina, the
prison system was set up right from the start as a
pool of cheap labor, by which the goverment
became richer. ._ '

According to former Arkansas prison warden,

Tom Murton, “The State prison farms have always
been self-supporting. They were run for the profit
of the State and for the benefit of a few
individuals. In 1966, the Penitentiary made a proﬁt
of $300,000 for the State. Proﬁts for the selected

1 ‘individuals have not been calculated.

.....The major part of I this farm work was done
with mules and convicts who labored in the ﬁelds
ten-to-fourteen hours a day, six or seven days a
week. Within the prison, the needs to maintain
discipline and meet work quotas were the
immediate causes of the brutality which sometimes
resulted in murder. NOTHING WAS TO GET IN
THE WAY OF PRODUCTION FOR PROFIT!”

.In the North, the prison industry has followed

- in the footsteps of heavy industry. Inmates in
prisons are forced to workin all kinds of shops and.

at different jobs to make millions upon millions for
the prison industry. ' N _

In Philadelphia, the inmates at Holmesburg bake
bread not only for their own jail, but for all the
other Philadelphia. prisons, as well as Gratesford
prison., These inmates have. to get up at 4 in the
morning, slave in the bake shops until around 10 or
11, and are paid a mere $.50 cents a day for their

work. But the prison bosses take the bread they
bake and then sell it to others for 20 times as much
as the inmates get. One warden has even
commenqted “these convicts are such good bakers
that I even take some of their bread home for my
family.” .

License plates for all cars in Pennsylvaniacome
from the hard labor of inmates‘ inside the prisons.
Here again the State makes a bundle selling them
for $14 a plate, while the inmates are getting a
$.50 cents wage. V

It is clear that the PRISON SYSTEM IS A
BUSINESS THAT MUST PROFIT TO SURVIVE'

wonraaas AT A pnso 3;;

One of the basic laws of capitalist business is
that each worker employed must produce so many
units of a product. Any business that has more
workers than units produced is on the road to the
poor-house(bankruptcy). This is true. with the
prison" system as well, because its existence
depends on production. That is why the prison
bosses have to go all out to destroy all
prisoners-workers strikes. One of the usual tricks is

 

to divide the prisoners by racism. The strike

forgotten and the inmates ﬁnd themselves in an
endless race war. ~‘ '

When prisoners demand just wages for ' their
labor and begin to organize, another trick of the
prison bosses is to push immediately ‘for prison
reforms. All this reform means is “changing the
frame on the wall, but not the picture.” The new
frame of prison reform is supposed to pacify the
prisoners and keep them quiet by offering “them a
mo.vie,a new radio station, a new freshly" painted
cell, etc. Everything but ‘immediate parole or
justice. In short, the idea is to keep the inmate
happy and the assembly lines rolling.” "The same
principle they try to use in factories. -

Finally, when a prisoners" labor has earned so
much profit for the State, the inmate is then
rented out to the outside world‘ for a week, a

‘ month, or a year, until he or she is soon brought

back to the plantation, to . the factory. Its a
never-ending circle !‘

WOMEN IN PRISON

About 15,000 women enter the criminal justice
system every day in this country. More than half
are charged with drunkeness, vagrancy, disorderly
conduct, and other minor offenses. Others are
booked and sent to jail for shoplifting,
prostitution, larceny, forgery, burglary and crimes
relating to drug and alcohol addiction. Together
with traffic violations, these offenses cover almost
all the crimes charged against women. J

A little known fact is that very few crimes are
ever dealt with in court. Police make arrests on
only 12% of all reported crimes. Out of that 12%
less than 2% go to jail. The “less than two percent”
of lawbreakers are always poor women. They are

"poor whites, poor Blacks, Chicanos, Puerto-Ricans,

and Native Americans. The percentage of Brown
and Black women in prison far outnumbers their
population in society. While the Black population
of the country is only 11%, more than 60% of
women prisoners are Black. I .

One third of the women in jail are awaiting trial,

jailed because they cannot pay bail or get out on .

their own recognizance. -

Women in prison are regarded as girls, mere

children, incapable of working, thinking, making
decisions. In prison, their jobs are scrubbing floors,
cleaning, ironing, cooking and sewing. If the prison
is isolated, from ' a neighboring men’ prison, the
women are then forced to become butchers, truck
drivers, and other workers who slave for $.50 a day
while the prison administration gets rich from their
work. ' l ‘

Local and state jails often exclude women from
most, or all work, recreational and educational
programs, increasing the deadly boredom which is
the reality of life for women in jail. Male guards are
often used to

qualifications and lower pay than male guards. ,
A “model prison” in Ins Angelos’ has five
sections-. maximum security, minimum security,
mental observation, lock up and the daddy tank. ‘
Maximum security is a block of cells holding
women not yet convicted of anything, but are
awaiting trial. Minimum security holds women

, serving time and consists of crowded dormitories.

Mental observation holds women supposedly
needing psychiatric care. Lock up is solitary
confinement with all privileges taken away. The
daddy tank is a maximum security cellblock for
women whom prison officials “may think” are
lesbians. Women are kept in. the daddy tank
regardless of whether they are serving time or just
awaiting trial.

“handle” - (and sometimes
mis-handle) women prisoners. Matrons, as women -
jail guards are called, usually have lower

In this “model prison”, as in most other “model .

prisons” the food is mostly starch, the meat is
usually pork or beef, there is strict censorship of
mail, restrictions on outside visitors, a prison
library stocked full of books designed to teach the
woman prisoner the proper “female role”, and no
educational facilities. Medical care and health care
are mostly a joke. Many women die in these jails
because of the unsanitary health conditions in
these jails. '

Although it is rough for men when they get out
of jail to try to secure a good job and erase the
stigma of being a convict from peoples’ minds, it is
twice as rough for women. Besides the stigma of ‘a
criminal record when they do get out, women are
looked upon as morally “inferior” (like the
branded women of olden days).

The Federal Reformatory V for Women in
Alderson, West Virginia is the only allwomens’
federal penitentiary in the U.S. Women are kept
there who have rebelled against their “lower class”
or “racial place”. There are .287 Blacks, 9 Native
Americans, and 21 women of other countries in the
total population of 529. c

This “model prison” is called a cam us and the
“girls” are said to have a great many privileges:

,_ they can wear their own clothes if they can afford, *

them, they can work for 19 cents an hour, they
can write freely to their friends in English. If a

woman refuses to work without pay in the kitchen,

laundry ‘or cleaning rooms, if she openly shows
that she’s a lesbian, or if she fights, engages in
“unladylike” behavior or language, she is
immediately thrown into a maximum security cell
where all herchlothesand personal belongings are
taken. There is no such thing as a disciplinary

_ hearing or even a mock.trial. A woman is punished
without a chance to represent herself or defend h

herself.

WOMEN/ARE FIGHTING BACK!

But just as male prisoners are fighting back
against their unjust oppression in jails, so are
women prisoners uniting and standing up for their
human rights.

On the day after the murders of the men at
Attica State Prison by Gov. Rockefeller, last
September, the women prisoners at Alderson held

a memorial service, then "presented a list of 42.

demands to the warden and other prison officials.

These demands were for immediate positive,

changes in the prison condition, in regard to
medical care, wages_for work, more representation
on parole hearings, more case workers, and‘, choice
of legal counsel for all prisoners in the institution.

The prison bosses responded to these just’

demands with tear gas and shipping prisoners to
other prisons. Many of the women considered
“ringleaders” were , kept in solitary confinement
that whole year.

Simply stated,‘ the political prisoner _is one ‘

whose words or actions have, in some ‘way,

who has fought against unjust laws, exploitation
and racism, and who attempts to change the worl

Angela Davis was not on trial for committing a
crime, but was on- trial because she was a militant
woman Communist and was black.

This was the case with such trials as the New
York Panther 121, the Soledad Brothers, Bobby
Seale & Ericka Huggins,‘ Martin Sostre, and Joe Hill
back in 1914. * '

But then there is the other kind" of political '

prisoner-the victim of oppression who doesn’t have
the political awareness af an Angela Davis or a

George Jackson, but who is just an ordinary victim . .

of economic exploitation. These countless people,

-black, brown and white, are the majority  jails

and prisons, the sons and daughters of working

people and poor people, most of whom don’t,have
big legal defenses or committees and aren’t known ~
' as well. These, people are also political prisoners,
because their being in jail is tied to the very '
political and economic" basis of capitalist. society.

Over 80% of the prisoners in this ‘country enter
prison» convicted of crimes having something to do

with money, whether they stand convicted of. ‘

murder-robbery, 1st or 2nd degree robbery, grand
theft, ‘petty theft,“ picking pockets, 1st or 2nd

A degree burglary, passing worthless checks, forgery, ‘
‘selling narcotics, panhandling, etc. All these crimes

are committed to obtain money, tolsecure food, to

. secure clothing and/or shelter-in some manner, to . .
A obtain the basic essential needs of life. .
' i To provide for both themselves and their _
families, poor and working people are forced into
committing “crimes” against the system. ‘

_ _Capitalism- is set up on the idea that there isnnot -
enough to go around, so that only a privileged few _

can “make it”. The majority, who are at ‘the
bottom of society ‘have to ﬁght it out as best they
can, while the ‘-‘smart_one's”, like. Rockefeller, walk
away clean and happy. Those at the bottom’ of the
pile are forced to survive by committing crimes and
‘so end up sooner or later in jail.

. People like Rockefeller and Ford thenlset up
laws so that their system, "of. profits will be

protected and can grow and grow..and Anyone‘ who
gets in the way must be “taken care of”, and

to keep the people who e,d'on’t have ‘a damn

capitalist system of “free society”.

Prisons are not built to rehabilitate so-called

the goverment.

‘in the spirit of George Jackson’s life and actions.
There" has been an uprising at Attica State prison,_ _

Dallas State prison. Inmates in prison, from San

_‘ the brutality and injustices that they are forced to
‘ suffer. a t

‘It was mainly George Jackson who pointed out

"prisoners, but that the fight must also be directed

GEORGE JACKSON '& LIFE   A  

EARLY CHILDHOOD AND TROUBLE,
. George Jackson was ‘ born in Chicago‘ on
September 23, .1941.’ He was the second of 4

_ children of Robert & Georgia Jackson. ,
After kindergarten, he was sent to a Catholic

mission school, where he receiveda boring and,

totally irrelevant education by white nuns and '

teachers. , _
Like most young Blackimales in US ghettoes,
George discovered that trouble was never far away;

1 He and other Black youth_ ran the blocks looking i

for excitement. This led to trouble with the local

cops, and he soon began to be picked up regularly

on “suspicion of” charges. ' ' ._ ' -
When he was fifteen, his father took him and

the family to Los Angeles in an attempt‘ to move .
- George away from the Chicago environment. ’

- ' But the changeof scenery was in vain. . .«
It was in LA that the prison phase of Georges’

V For allegedly breakinginto a large downtown

‘ department store, George was shot 6 times AT

POINT-BLANK RANGE by a LA .cop. Convicted:
of robbery and assault, herwas sent to Paso Robles,
a California Youth Authority Correctional Center._

It is important to point out here that even
though George was unarmed and the cop‘ was’

clearly in no immediate danger, th_e'cop‘ still fired 6 ii
i shots at point-blank range. The reason for this is

simple. Cops are employed "to PROTECT
PROPERTY FIRST-- the private property of -the

 rich capitalists. When this property is threatened in
any way (in Georges’ case, a large dept..store) the _

guilty person is charged with the .greatest__ of crimes

in the eyes. of therich. PROPERTY MEANS I
MORE THAN H-UAMAN -LIFE TO THE L

CAPITALIST! . . _
Paso Robles was a hard adjustment for George.

_ Anyone who _has been in jail more than ‘once will,‘
. agree _that the very first time. is quite a shock.

There’s the feeling of being caged like an- animal.‘

. Youbegin to feel lessthan human,’like a slave.

After 7 months in Paso Robles, George was.-
released, only ‘to be re-arrested soon after on a

number -of robbery charges, most of which‘ he‘

. knew nothing about. ' - A . .'
This is a familiar practice of cops everywhere. '

The police clean up the ‘record books "of all. ,

unsolved crimes when_ "they can. find a-_ poor
‘suspect A with a record. that they can pin all

‘these unsolved crimes on. This injustice is, a

common experience to Black and poor youth. ,
George escaped jail this time by walking out- in

In 1960-’ 18 years old-- George. was accused of
robbing a gas stationcof $70. The DA offered a
deal. If he would plead guilty and confess tofthe
charge‘ (this spares the county the court expenses)
Georgewould get a_ light sentence’. George accepted.

.the deal. When it came time for sentencing, he was

-‘given the infamous ‘indeterminate sentence?" one ’
year to life. This sentence meant that every year he ' ,
would have to ;go before a "parole board which .
would then decide whether he’shouldbe?releasedor_'- ‘
not. Without ever knowing an exact release date, _

George’s future depended upon the annual whims

_ ‘of the racist [California Adult Authority Board. - 7 -

that proved an effective weapon in radicalizing and ' - _

through letters he wrote from his cell.

brother Jonathan.by teaching him" African. history '

George saw the need for educating his fellow
inmates in the same way that he had become
re-educated. He turned his attention to helping

other prisoners with legal work, teaching Arabic_

and Spanish, and in the study of revolutionary
theory. ' .

Another inmate, Jimmy Carr was serving time
back in 1959 when he first met George. When he
met George again 6 years later, he was impressed at
the self-less person George had become. '

“George was a different type of fellow... At that
time I couldn’t read or write, or anything like this

‘ you know. I was to find out later that George was

ap selﬂess person, selfless in that George would go
out of his way to help anyone. Like he started me
to reading, started me to writing... And he started
bringing me up to a stature I could respect.”

In a letter he ‘wrote called “P.S. On Ulysses” \

George talked about another inmate who had a
great effect on the awakening Black prisoners’ in
Soledad and San Quentin. This inmate, Ulysses
McDaniels wrote the following poem, which Black
inmates took as their revolutionary oath .upon
entering the circle of revolutionary inmates:

If ever I should break my stride,

Or falter at my comrade’s side,

This oath will kill me!

If ever my words should prove untrue,

‘. Should I ever betray the many or you few,
This oath will kill me!

Should I be slow or make a stand.
Or show fear before the hangman,

’ This oath will kill me!

. Should I misuse the peoples’ trust,
Should I submit ever to greed or lust,
This oath will kill me! A
Should I grow lax in discipline,

In times of strife, refuse my hand,
This oath will kill me!

George spent most of his prison life” in

maximum ‘security cells-- known as the “hole”.
Places like San Quentins’ 0-wing, where “one
cannot get a parole directly to the outside

prison(general population).

Georges’ political thinking led to many conflicts
with the prison authorities. The worst thing to be,
in the eyes of the prison bosses, is a “militant”, an

. inmate who refuses to surrender to the ‘breaking in

process’. Once the prisonofficials branded George
as a “militant”, a “troublemaker”, he was

. .constantly harassed, threatened and insulted. Other
convicts were used by the guards to threaten his

life. George reports that many times other inmates
were told “get Jackson, it’ll do you some good.”
"Despite these numerous attacks, George refused

to compromise, or reject his new-founded.

awareness. “There is no turning away from
awareness”, he said. I

Because of inmates like Ulysses, W.L. Nolen
and George Jackson, prisoners who were ‘thrown
into prison found a new direction to channel their
energies. Before they were forced to break down
and submit to the every whim of the prison
authorities. They had to obey every dehumanizing
rule and regulation set down by the prison
administration. But now these men were beginning

. to “awaken to the fact that their ‘only hope lies in

resistance.” r
But the long hard road of 10 years in prison also
affected George in other ways as well.

If I ever leave here alive, I’ll leave nothing
behind. They’ll never count me among the broken
men, but I can’t say that I am normal either. I’ve
been hungry too long. I’ve gotten angry too often.
I’ve been lied to and insulted too many times.

They’ve pushed me over the line from where there '

can be no retreat. I know that they won’t be
satisfied until they have pushed me out of this
existence altogether. I’ve been the victim of too
many racist attacks that I could never relax again.

. THE SOLEDAD BROTHERS I

During the 11 years George was in Soledad and
San Quentin, there were many attempts by the
prison bosses, either through guards or racist

" convicts to kill him. '

The most determined attempt came in early

January of 1970- the incident which led to the-

Soledad Brothers trial. " -

In December, 1969, a Black inmate, W.L. Nolen
and two other Black prisoners was shot down by a
white guard in Soledads’ recreation yard. The
guard justified the murders saying he was ‘trying to
stop a fight between the Blacks inmates and the
white prisoners. '

On Jan. 16, a guard was killed in retaliation for
the murderof the three inmates. ’

The prison authorities began an intense search,
but not for the actual murderer. No! This was the
goldenopportunity they had waited so long to get.

Three men were soon charged with the killing of
the guard- Fleeta Drumgo, John Clutchette and
George Jackson. ‘

John Clutchette was in Soledad for burglary. On
April 28, 1970, he was to have been released on
parole. .

, Fleeta Drumgo was also in jail for burglary. He
had been denied parole once before.because of his
“militancy”.

‘ But George Jackson was in the most serious
situation of all. If he was convicted, he- would get
the automatic death sentence. This was Californias’
Penal Code 4500, which states that an inmate
serving a life sentence or an indeterminate sentence
MUST get the death penalty if convicted.of
assaulting a non-inmate. ~

One thing was standing in the way of the prison

authorities. No real evidence! So, they took extra.
. precautions to keep the three men under control.

They were not allowed to get in touch with their
families or lawyers, and were held in solitary

confinement, locked in the hole. Finally, John’

Clutchette -‘managed to smuggle out a note to his

family telling them of the situation.
But even after defense lawyers were found, and X

allowed into the prison, they discovered that the

-prison wing where the murder had taken place had
been remodeled and painted over. Other prisoners ~

who were willing to testify in the Soledad Brothers
defense had been quickly shipped out to another
prison where they couldn’t be reached.

But there was also another thing that the prison

rulers didn’t see, and it caused a lot of worry. The .

trial they had hoped to keep quiet and quick
escaped beyond the walls of Soledad. Suddenly

' there were massive campaigns and Soledad Defense
Committees set up all over the country. The cry of '

“Free the Soledad Brothers” was heard all over.

What had started out as just another trial
blossomed into a clear,‘ loud indictment of the
prison structure and the judicial system in this
country.

With each new trick the State pulled, another
part of the judicial and the prison system was being
exposed. ’ I

_ The Soledad Brothers had to fight constantly
against the appointment of racist judges, like
Gordon Campbell, who repeatedly referred to the.
Brothers as “_nigras” and other insulting remarks.
Campbells’ blatant violation of the’ Brothers”rights
opened up more and more eyes to the fact that US
courts are a lot different in practice than what they
say they are. ' '

On August 7th, 1970, another unexpected
event added a whole new dimension to both the
case and Georges’ life.

Jonathan, Georges’ younger brother, just 17,
walked into a courtroom near San Francisco and
attempted a courtroom escape. Armed with guns
and hostages, Jonathan, William Christmas, James
McLain and Ruchell Magee were shot down as they

tried to get away in an escape van. Jonathan,‘ I

McLain and Christmas (both were San Quentin
inmates) were killed. Ruchell was wounded and
charged with murder.

This incident led, of course, to-the_An,gela Davis a

trial, just over.‘ _ p —
After Angela was caught, the defense for her

and Ruchell became world-wide. Linked up with

the Soledad Brothers trial, the issue of political
prisoners was a major‘ topic of concern and action
everywhere. . -

In-October of that year, Georges’ book of‘.

prison letters, “-Soledad Brother” was released. The

book did more than any other work to point out in

detail just what goes down in prisons and why. .
Meanwhile preparations for the Soledad

. Brothers trial went underway. John, Fleeta and

George were transferred from’ Soledad to San
Quentin. —

Pretrial hearings began August 9, 1971. In the
courtroom was\built a huge glass cage seperating
the spectators from the bench.’This bullet-proof

‘ cage was designed not for protection, but for the

purpose of making the inmates look likevicious
criminals, who had to be kept away from normal
people. . ' " '

» ‘SAN QUENTIN V ~ _ .
. To get‘ a clearer picture of- the situation“ that was
. happening at San Quentin at this time, "this

In addition to the glass cage’, was the personal
treatment the Brothers were forced to suffer. They
had chains wrapped around their ankles and hands,
and their waist, They had to go through elaborate,
unnecessary’ skin searches everywhere they went.
lawyers and friends of the Brothers were harassed

and‘ insulted whenever.‘ they came to the"

courtroom.‘ . .
On April 6th, as the Brothers were leavingthe

' ~. court after a small hearing, they were attacked by .
_ prison guards and two units’of the Tactical Police

Squad. Francis Jackson, Georges’ sister, who was

seven "months pregnant was stabbed in the stomach .
-A by one of the guards‘ with a_ blackjack. V

But this only. served the purpose of bringing

_ "more'_"an_d more people into ‘the struggle against the
 unjust. prison system. All the. racism,’ brutality and
harassment became the "seeds of their own

exposure.

interview with George explains the setting:

—. Here in "San Quentin, its different’ (from
Soledad). These guards are drawn from_' the
metropolitan area around here in the Bay Area.
And they’re clearly, very, very highly politicized to
the right.vThere is an infrastructure (a structure

I .within _ a‘ structure) ‘here inside the joint. Well

ac‘tuallyi'th‘ere__is. a conflict in the infrastructure.

. that‘.

There’s one group of pigs, headed by James Park

(Associate Warden) who would like to convey to
_the public, to the people outside, that things are

going allright in here, and that they are going as
well as circumstances could allow. A

Then there is the other element- the hard liners,
the out-and-out fascist cats, who really identify
with the John Blrch society, and the blatant open
fascist Bideology.... I certainly shouldn’t forget to
mention Assistant warden Jacobs, who is really the
motive force behind the whole hard—line, right-wing
political line. Their goal is. directly opposite to
Parks’ line. ‘ _

Park would like to convey to the public that
things are ‘going smoothly, and they are handling
the ‘animals as well as theycan, with as little force
as possible. )

_ : But the hard-liners took over from Park (control
of the prison).

...They saw that Park’s line wasn’t too effective, "

it was failing. And so they just moved in and took
over. Their vehicle for the take-over was the

creating of ‘a contrapositive mobolization of

right-wing cons. They have-control over dozens of
right-wing cons, who, really, .don’t consider
themselves ' convicts but as . right-wing political
animals. The prison authorities, through these-
cons, attempt to convey to the public that all

', convicts are animals, and that extreme measures.

are needed to keep them in line.”

This statement‘ is a clear picture of the two

opposing‘ policies used by ' the San Quentin
authorities to keep control over the inmate

‘population. One faction is willing to give small

favors to keep the peace and give people the image
that they run a happy jail. The other ‘faction

 pushes the line that “these convicts are animals,

maniacs. And if we allow them any favors, it will
be ‘to society’s disadvantage. If given the chance,
these animals will slit our throats and go beserk.
They have no human feelings and are entitled to no

' rights at all. They’re just cold-blooded animals and‘

ONE DAY WE’LL PROVE THIS TO YOU!”

THE DEATH OF GEORGE JACKSON I
August 21, 1971 .

It was early that morning when strange reports

came out of San.‘ Quentin which hinted that
' something was about to happen. -

San Quentin Associate Warden James Park
stated a new prison policy aimed at reducing the
number of press interviews of “celebrity inmates”.
This was a clear indication at the Soledad Brothers
and, Ruchell Magee, who were all being held on the
1st tier of the maximum security row of the jail.
Park restricted the number of reporters coming to

see the 4 men to gangaverage of 1 every 3' months.

I ' The reason for this sudden move was the “doubling

back "by funny people who I doubt are ‘really

repprters”, he said. ‘

Later that afternoon, the first word leaked out
that there had been "a prison, break from the
cellbl_ock. The break had been led by George

Jackson, waving a gun he had smuggled into the '
a prison". The break had left 3 guards and 2 white

inmates dead. Jackson was shot by a guard as he

‘ .,ran out into the’ yard and tried to jump a 20-foot’
- -. "high wall. " - '

A quick press conference was ‘called by the

ofﬁcials, where Park handed out this story. A

’ 7 Nelson told the press that the person  had

Bingham. It had been Bingham who had smuggled

the gun. into Jackson. (But how had the weapon "

escaped notice by a metal detection device at the
gate to the prison?) ‘ ' ' ’
Then. an ‘officer Frank De Leon

escorted

Jackson from the visiting area (see no. 1 _on the . ;~' A

‘ﬂoor. of the "maximum security cellblock(no 2). On
this floor, 3 guards were on duty at the-time. There .
A were .26 other _inmateL (called, by Nelson the ..

“worst of our. incorrigibles’A’)° locked on "that ﬂoor.

Itwas then that Jackson pulled out the gun,» took .

over command of the room and forced the guards.

— _ to trip the cellblock device which locks all the cell , ,
doors. Jackson and other inmates held 3 guards ‘ ‘ '
hostage and forced them into the back of the '

It ‘was then that alarms went off all over the -
prison. Over 20 gaurds rushed into the wing and; _ .

this helped the‘ three gaurds held hostage to escape. . 3

(This was said just minutes after Nelson had told

‘ Nelson goes on to say that Jackson and Spain

‘ then» bolted out of the cellblock (past 20 armed. . '
guardsl?) onto the yard. The two ran towards the A
‘brick’ wall '75 yards away from the door. Jackson

was then hit by bullets from a sharpshooter

_A ‘stationed in" a gun tower (~nma_rked‘lx on the chart").

Jackson then stumbled .a few feet and collapsed

‘ near the‘ prison chapel. Spain jumped into nearby A
. ._bushes and was later captured. _ -- " ‘

Next came in the autopsy report by a Dru.-Cooke

of San Marin county, explaining how the 3 guards .
' _.and Jackson had been killed. A ' " '

Guard DeLeon had been choked ‘to daethnwith

cloth andhis neck had been cut with a razor. _ . 2

.. . ’But_it is the report on Jackson’ that is most‘ .
important, According .-to Dr. Cooke, George. had '

their’ throats

been hit on the top of his head by a riﬂe bullet
that went through the base of his skull down his
back, along his spine, fracturing a rib and coming
out through the lower back.

This means that George had to be shot in the
back, or most likely, lying down. He could not

"have been running in the direction of the gun

tower and have the bullet enter the back of his
head.. , .
On August 25th, the San Rafeal Independent

Journal_ reported that the prison officials had
conducted a search of the entire cellblock and had‘
’ uncovered “more evidence”. They said they found
7 “an elablorate escape map in his (GEorge) cell,‘
along with 2 containers of plastic explosives, an-

assortment- of shotgun shells, and a number of .38
caliber pistol shells.” .
The. Philadelphia Inquirer reported on that same

[day that “a zip gun was discovered in a bar of soap,
and the barrel of a .22 caliber pistol hidden in a‘

package of cheese.” V «

i The San Francisco Chronicle of August’ 27,
reported that their reporters had used an identical
gun (.9mm), and had someone try to conceal it
under a similiar wig as Jackson was supposedly to
have worn that day. This experimebt proved
beyond a shadow of a doubt thatit was close to
impossible that Jackson could have walked passed
guards with the gun unnoticed sticking out of his
hair. ‘ ‘

were fired. , e »

George knew the guards were after him, John,
Fleeta and Ruchell especially. So he ran out of the

away from thexothers. ' . ‘

He was shot down by guards in the back. He

J was leftto bleed for an hour on the ground. When
they saw that he wasn’t dead, another guard shot»
him in the head. -

Ruchell Magee further stated that the gun
George was supposed to have smuggled into the jail
belonged to one of the guards who threw it down
on the ground besides the dead body. Then they
took pictures of it to make it look like an escape
attempt. . A '

All 26 inmates of the maximum security row of
the San Quentin adjustment center swore to the
‘facts stated above, under the ever-present threat of
brutality and even death by the prison officials. It

' is not the act of desperate men, but the firm belief '
thatthe truth about George Jacksons’ murder must’ -_
be told no matter what the cost. '

Despite all the lies and distortions that have
ﬂowed out of the mouths of the San Quentin
officials, all evidence points to the fact that they
murdered George Jackson in cold blood, to prevent '
him from exposing their corrupt system -of '_
oppression to the world. He was shot in the back in
his last act of selﬂessness, attempting to protect '
the lives of his fellow inmates. . ‘

last ten years now and they’ve finally done- it.” --—-

AFT ERMATH _ _
After the murder of George Jackson, a reign of

A terror existed at San Quentin for the other 26

inmates. They were beaten, shot, kept in complete
isolation and thraetened with death.

' When John and Fleeta appeared in court to
present their testimony of what had happened, the
racist judge wouldn’t let them speak and hadthem

. dragged out of the courtroom.

Nation-wide protests and demonstartions
followed the muder all across the country. .'A
24-hour vigil was held at the gates of San Quentin
to protest the murder and the isolation of the 26
prisoners. ‘

Mass protests grew and public pressure finally
forced the prison officials to open the prison to
inspection by outsiders. On August 28, bombings
of courthouses in San Francisco, San Mateo and

‘Sacramento,were claimed by the Weathermen

Underground. This was in retaliation for the
murder, they said. The very next" night, a San
Francisco cop was shot and killed inside a police
station. This act was also in retaliation for the

murder. of George Jackson, with the warning that '

similiar acts would follow everytime “one of our
sisters and brothers is killed.” _

' I And ﬁnally, on August 29, 8 days after he was
murdered,'and 24 days before his 30th birthday,

H GEORGE LESTER JACKSON was buried in

Bethel Cemetery, Mt. Vernon, Illinois. He’ was
buriedright near his younger brother Jonathan,

Prisons In
America

In the early morning hours of September-9,
1971, a group of inmates at Attica State Prison in

New York seized 40 guards and civilian hostages,
and took over the prison. The ‘1500

inmates who participated in‘ this rebellion drew up..
130 demands, designed to change the horrible .

conditions at Attica, as well as V voice the fact
that, even though they were prisoners they were
still human ‘beings and men with basic. human
rights.

At the time of the rebellion 75% of the 2250 r
V inmates at Attica were Black and Puerto-Rican,

while all 383 guards were white. These. white
guards showed their racism by saving the best of

the prison jobs for white inmates, as well as"

constantly beating and brutalizing the Black and

Puerto-Rican prisoners with their “nigger clubs?’. . ‘

The conditions at Attica prison are similar" to

conditions found in. every jail and prison in the .

U.S. s

The inmates wanted a change in "the shower
-schedule. They were permitted to only take one

shower a week. They also demanded that the food I

served in the prison be cleaned of the many bugs
and insects usually found in it. Inmates demanded

' that they be paid the minimum wage for their

work. They were being paid slave wages of $.25 a
day for an average 7-Shourworkday in such places
as the metal shop(where the normal temperature is

' ' 104 degrees).

After the prisoners took control of cellblock D
with 40 guards and civilian workers as hostages,
Russell Oswald, the State Corrections
Commissioner came to the prison to begin
negotiations. Oswald and other high prison ofﬁcials

' thought that the rebellion could be put down, and

the prisoners sent meekly back to their’ cells with
just ‘a little “talk and understanding . But the

determination and the militant organization of the I

prisoners could not be denied. ' I -

While Oswald kept stalling the agreement on the
inmates’ demands, he was keeping close touch with
his boss «Nelson Rockefeller, who was lounging at
his Pocantico Hills estate. The fact that these
prisoners were united and couldn’t.be. tricked or
frightened threw the prison" officials into panic.
They became desperate. Rockefellers’ only thought
was to GET BACK CONTROL OF HIS ‘PRISON
NO MATTER WHO DIED IN THE PROCESS! _
