Third Force, The Paris Agreements call for a three-part coalition
including religious leaders, students, workers and farm people who make
up the Third Force. Yet, ironically most Third Force leaders are in jail
because of their belief that the best way to end the war is through recon-
ciliation, not killing.

Doan Khac Xuyen, age 24, was an executive member of the Young
Catholic Workers movement. He was arrested in May, 1972, during martial
law and brought to court charged with being dangerous to national secur-
ity. Because of lack of evidence, he was not convicted, but instead of being
released, he spent the next two years at Con Son Island, Tan Hiep and Chi
Hoa Prisons. Once he appeared before the Military Court, charged with
not having an ID card. Charges were again dismissed because he did in fact
have an ID card which was confiscated when he was first arrested. Instead
of being released, Xuyen was told he must join the armed forces of the
GVN. When he refused, he was again imprisoned to await trial for draft
evasion. In a recent appearance before the Military Field Court, the follow-
ing exchange took place:

Judge: “Why will you not join the army?”

Xuyen: “Because I am a political prisoner who is a member of the Third
Force. According to the Paris Peace Accords, Article 8c,I must
be released.” .

Judge: “Are you a Communist? How long have you been working for
them?”

Xuyen: “I am not.”

‘ Judge: “Are you a Communist?”

Xuyen; “I am not a Communist.”

Judge; ‘‘If you are not a Communist, why do you quote the Paris
Accords?”

Xuyen: “The Paris Accords are for all Vietnamese.”

Judge: “You said you are a political prisoner and not a Communist. How
long have you been an activist?”

Xuyen: “You already know that in the South of Vietnam there are two
kind of political prisoners, Communists and members of the
Third Force.

Judge: (shouting) ‘‘I will not speak with you any longer.

The judge passed sentence: five years of hard labor. This is heavy punish-
ment, since draft-evaders are usually sentenced to four to six months, or
at most two years.

A Mother’s Words To Her Imprisoned Son
by Hoang Nghia

I have spent many sleepless nights crying,
_ for my son is suffering these days and nights in prison.

They accuse you of struggling for peace
instead of devoting all your time to study,
of being concerned for others

instead of enjoying the life of the city,

of speaking out against evil

instead of bearing your shame in silence
in the role of a slave

like many arrogant intellects

who ﬂounder in silence

and simply accept their shame.

Why did you protest? Why did you resist?
Why didn’t you do like your friends,

stay calm and study

finding comfort only in your degrees?

You have walked the road of our ancestors.
For the sake of our people, and our homeland,
you have struggled.

Many times I have asked myself,

“Why didn’t you fear the danger

of prison and torture

of those who betrayed the/country

and injured their fellowmen?”

I have heard they captured you because

you refused to bend your head to be a slave.
They took away your freedom

because you could not betray your heart.

No! You must not be a beggar!

You must not open your hand

asking for aid money

and living an indifferent life!

That is a life of imprisonment worse than you now suffer.

They are seeking for ways to accuse you
\ of crimes which are terrifying,

even though you have never committed them.

Within’ these wens,

do you hear the sound of laughter?

How could you hear from behind the iron bars‘?

They are laughing at these comedies

in which clowns act their roles and try to make it look real.
What a pity for our peopie, my son.

At this hour you probably cannot sleep

for you are suffering after hours of torture.
I have been told how they beat without pity
those who are their fellowmen.

They do not miss any cruel way to torture
until bones and flesh break into pieces.

My heart suffers every second, every moment.
My heart is broken from day to day while you are in prison.

But if there were none like you

to bear these sufferings,

to ask for independence,

to demand the Vietnamese’s right to live a human life,
how much longer would our people have to suffer?
Therefore, tonight

even though you and I still have to bear hardships,
although you are hungry and imprisoned,

I am sad but- have no regrets,

for you are worthy to be a man of a brave country.

Have faith, my son,

There are still many other friends

who continue to follow your steps.

There are still many other heroes to save the country,
to break these shackles and shame we have today.
You will some day be free,

and on that day our country shall brighten.

Day Two
Eight Spoonfuls of Rice

You Should Know

Reports coming out of South Vietnam’s prisons describe near-starvation
diets and denial of medical treatment. Huynh Tan Mam, well-known stu-
dent leader and one of Vietnam’s most charismatic and popular neutralists,
had a report smuggled out of Chi Hoa prison where he was confined. He
says, “(The Saigon Government) deprives the political prisoners of suf-
ficient nourishment and refuses to provide the ill with medical treatment.
As a result many prisoners have died. At Chi Hoa prison the daily ration is
comprised of 300 grams of rice (about two bowls); -a few pieces of spinach;
a bit of dried fish. At Tan—Hiep prison, the daily ration has been reduced
to a level threatening the lives of political prisoners there. At every meal
they are given two bowls of red rice and a bowl of salted water. At Thu-
Duc prison, the situation is much worse. Political prisoners there have been
forced to eat grass.”

Five students who returned from Con Son prison wrote:

“We want to affirm clearly, at the beginning, that all year round our
fellow prisoners are given just two main things to eat; namely, fish sauce
and dried fish, along with rice.”

“. . . in the tiger cage we were given three minutes to eat.”

“We” ate and drank only twice a day; first around 8:00 a.m., which we
called lunch, and then again around 2:00 p.m., which we called dinner.
The time between the afternoon and next morning’s meal was 18 hours.
Since it was hot and humid in the crowded and dark cell, we mutually
quenched our thirst with our collected urine.”

“To sum up the issue of food and drink, we constantly were in a state
of insufficiency, misery, and — compared with an animal who has someone
to feed him —— we were much worse off, even if you don’t consider the
savage beatings we received.”

The International Red Cross suspended inspections of the major South
Vietnamese prisons in March, 1972, as a sign of protest against the Govern-
ment’s refusal to allow its inspectors unannounced visits and unsupervised
talks in these prisons. The visits have not been resumed.

But in addition to the known major prisons there are concealed, secret
“rehabilitation centers”, whose existence the authorities deny. Conradin

Perner, an International Red Cross ofﬁcial, discovered and visited two such
camps in Phong Dinh Province in March and April, 1973. His report says:
“The detainees -— before we distributed things to them — had neither a
mat, nor a mosquito net, nor blankets, nor adequate shelter. All of them
are kept in army tents open to the wind. Contrary to what was believed
when we compiled our first reports, the prisoners do not receive any food!
Relatives of prisoners must bring them what they need.” The report also
says most of the inmates were older men, between 45 and 80, and younger
women, in their 30s, their little children and babies with them.

The Prison Island of Con Son

You ask me where on earth

People cannot live as human beings,

Where people with heart and soul

Live like beasts,

And I remember the days at Con Son.

The days of my youth

The beautiful blossoming days of my manhood

Still engraved in my heart with hate;

I engrave in this burning heart

The days of starvation at Con Son

Meals of eight spoonfuls of rice

Burning my stomach,

One cup of water for five people

Burning my throat.

Do you know the nauseous smell of rotten shrimp paste?
Despite my empty stomach, the bile ﬂows bitter

And I spit out “Human Rights” to the Second Republic!
Yet listen to them:

   

   
 
 
 
 
 
  

“Eat and lie flat on your back for twenty-four hours.
Remember, son,

Raise your head and we’ll b-reak your ribs:

Unbutton your shirt and you’ll eat lime dust.”

You ask me where is Hell,

Deep in my heart I remember night at Con Son-
The echo of a creaking door

The beatings

The crying out at midnight

The shouting of guards,

“Look Boy! Ask for medicine

And we’ll send you to the cemetery of Ham Duong.”
The beating of clubs on my back.

Oh, my heart, how it aches,

Yet I still have the heart to ask

Whether they are human beings.

I ask all of you,

I ask the regime of the Republic

Who are they? Those whom the regime has trained
To “reform” the prisoners at Con Son.

You are responsible, Regime of the Second Republic,
Responsible to all of the people,

To each of us

Today

In this Twentieth Century

The century of human progress.

Day Three

Chained in the Tiger Cages

You Should Know

Tiger Cages. “This is a room, or more correctly a small cage, about three
meters (10 feet) long and one and one-half (ﬁve feet) wide, in an area
separate from the other cages by many walls and totally isolated from all
life outside. They threw five people into this narrow cage. On the average,
each person had only about two hand-breadths of space in which to lie
and live. The legs were shackled and held high day and night — even while
eating, sleeping, washing — fastened to a metal rod about four or five
meters long. They forced us to lie in silence; we couldn’t sit or stir in this
hot, narrow, dark cage. The cages are separated by stone walls more than a
meter thick. A small door is kept tightly shut all day, except for a few
minutes when it is opened and reclosed during meals. Above it are metal
bars running horizontally lengthwise, with a small space or passageway left
for the orderlies who make regular checks. We had to lie there all day.
Sitting or standing was not allowed.” —— From a report of five students
who have been returned from Con Son prison.

In 1970, the Tiger Cages of Con Son Island were disclosed. Public
uproar brought about at least temporary closing of these cages. Three
months later the prisoners were ordered to build new cages as a self—help
project. They refused and were put back in shackles. Then in 1971 the
American firm of Raymond, Morrison, Knudsen-Brown, Root and Jones
received a $400,000 contract to build new “isolation cells” of tiger cage
design except two square feet smaller.

“Con Son Today,” a report from a released prisoner, says “At present,
(August, 1973) there are over 4,000 political prisoners on Con Son Island,
being held in camps II, IV, VI, VII, and VIII. Camp II has 281 women,
Camp IV .has 493 women and six small children, Camp VI has 1,545 men,
Camp VII (where the tiger cages are located) has 1,128 men, 28 women
and 9 small children. Camp VIII has 600 men. The total is: 3,272 men,
802 women, and 15 children from two months to five years of age.”

because of their peace activities. His two sisters were released after nearly
six months at the interrogation center. His brother was tortured to death
at the Saigon Municipal Police Station because he would not sign confes-

Le’s wife was sentenced under An Tri law to two years in Thu Duc
Women’s Prison. Because of torture, she is paralyzed and can only crawl.
Despite her two-year sentence, she actually spent almost five years in
prison, being moved from Thu Duc to Chi Hoa and finally to Con Son
Island. She was kept in isolation in both the old and the new tiger cages.

The author was a deserter from the Saigon Army and consequently was
forced to serve as a porter on the battle field. Despite the peace agree-

from prison. “Return From Con Son” is the songhe composed for her

Return From Con Son

From the Isle of Con Son

You have returned home

In the peaceful afternoon sun.
Your legs paralyzed

Your hands covered with scars
From years of shackles and pain.

This late afternoon I hear you singing
Under the warm sky of our country.
Life blossoms afresh

In the sparkle of your loving eyes.

Your song is strong

And makes our blood surge through our bodies.
Your sacrifice has been made

So the rice can bloom in joy.

Your song resounds over the

Guns, bayonets and dark prisons.

Your sacrifice has been made

So our motherland will grow in freedom.

Here are the seeds of rice for our country.
Here is the love of your fellowmen

Which will warm your heart
And carry your voice to the sky.

Our Unity
By Kien Nam

One morning, chained in the Tiger Cages

We met, and understood each others’ heart.

I saw the blood still red on your shoulder

And the scars of terrible lashes on your back;

As I lay there

My bones and skin crying out in hunger and thirst,

We understood each other through simple looks.

Full of faith, looking to the eternal future of our country
And yet before the enemy, our spirit hardened

As our eyes met

And smiles ﬂourished on our lips comforting one another.
We shall fight to death, though they beat us,

We shall hold our hands, and live or die together.

A deep love exists in our hearts

As though we have known each other since long ago,
Long ago when the earth began to turn.

We met one another at Con Son.

Day Four

The Excruciating Contradiction

You Should Know

The Paris Ceasefire Agreement for Peace in Vietnam provides for
humane treatment of prisoners. Following is an excerpt from Article 8B
of the Protocol on Prisoners:

“All Vietnamese civilian personnel captured and detained in South
Vietnam shall be treated humanely at all times, and in accordance with
international practice.

They shall be protected against all violence to life and person, in par-
ticular against murder in any form, mutilation, torture and cruel treat-
ment, and outrages against personal dignity. The detaining parties shall
not deny or delay their return for any reason, including the fact that
captured persons, may on any grounds, have been prosecuted or sen-
tenced. These persons shall not be forced to join the armed forces of
the detaining party.”

In actual practice a multitude of tortures have been devised to extract
information from prisoners. One common practice is to tie prisoners’
hands behind their backs and hang them from the ceiling by the arms.
Often prisoners lose consciousness within a few minutes after being sus-
pended in this manner.

Another torture is to place the prisoner in a barrel of water and beat on

"the barrel. The water distributes the pressure over the prisoner’s body, and

although there may be little, if any, outward bruises on the body, the
prisoner suffers severe internal injury, and the pain is almost unbearable.

men tried to extract some confession of guilt from her. The girl said she
was guilty of nothing. The men were not satisfied. They fastened down
her hands and attached wires to her fingers. At the other end of the wires
was a hand cranked generator. I am told the Americans used to call it the
Bell Telephone Hour. But Hien still said she was guilty of nothing.

“Then beating. So severe she would fall to the floor. She was pulled up
by her hair and beaten again. Soapy water forced down her nose into her
stomach. Then beating and kicking her stomach until the soapy bile was
forced back up through nose and mouth.

“No confession acquired, the beatings resumed. Down, and up by the
hair. Two men holding her legs apart; another man kicking. By this time
Hien was unconscious. When she awoke, Hien found she had no control
over her legs.

For ten days after the first interrogation Hien was sent back and forth
between the interrogation center and a province hospital. Beatings were
less severe. She was bleeding internally. At a doctor’s request she was sent
to a Saigon hospital where she met the MCC worker. (Mennonite Central
Committee News Release).

Within a few days Hien was again taken to prison, where she received a
two-year sentence. However, the efforts of many resulted in a telegram
received in June, 1974: REJOICE! HIEN RELEASED.

Volunteer workers in Vietnam were repeatedly asked to provide bribe
money in order to gain this release. One volunteer, describing such an
encounter, said, “The excruiating contradiction was that here I was face

Day Five

The Eyes of a Child

You Should Know

' Many young mothers in Vietnam who are arrested must take their
children with them into prison. The atmosphere of deprivation and terror
in which such children grow up can scarcely be imagined. It is also docu-
mented that children as young as I4 years of age have been jailed on their
own as political prisoners.

An MCC volunteer in Vietnam reported the following incident which
took place while he was visiting a prison:

“Quy (a prison official) began speaking of humanitarian concerns he
had with regard to the prison. ‘These people eat only a half bowl of rice
per meal, twice a day. This diet is especially hard on mothers with small
babies,’ he said.

‘Small babies in the prison?’ ‘Yes,’ Quy replied, ‘there are ten or so, and
they just don’t have milk for their children because of their meager
diet.’ Quy suggested that it would be good for some organization to
bring milk to the children regularly.”

Conradin Perner, in April, 1973, International Red Cross report, relates
first his inability in one camp to assist a teen-age prisoner, then tells of
another attempt:

“What I could at least try in Camp B, taking advantage of the general
attitude of the guards, was to comment on an adolescent, 16 years old,
thin, trembling, with tears in his blood-shot eyes. I asked a militiaman
about him and was told that he had just arrived that day after having spent
several months in prison. I learned that he is named Nguyen and that he
was originally from the village of Nhon Nghia; his father was dead and his
mother worked in the fields; he had been arrested ‘because he had helped
the Viet Cong.’ I learned that his ‘crime’ consisted in the fact that he had
‘lost’ ammunition when he was on civil defense duty; it was supposed he
had given it to the Viet Cong. . . ”

Perner tells how with many arguments he urged the District Head to
have the boy released, and finally said:

The May, 1974, Newsletter of the International Committee to Free
South Vietnamese Political Prisoners carried an interview by Ann
Buttrick:

“On January 15th, 1974, in Hanoi, Frank Dingrnan and I interviewed
four young South Vietnamese mothers with their children. They had
been released to the PRG during 1973.

Duong Thi Men, 26-year-old mother of two, cradled her small son of
23 months in one arm and stroked his irritated skin to soothe the con-
stant itching with the other. She spoke quietly of her terrifying exper-
iences in South Vietnam prisons.

She was arrested at her uncle’s house in January, 1972. ‘I had heard
that my uncle, who had brought me up from early childhood, was sick
and so I had come to visit him in Binh Vinh village. Within two hours
the Saigon soldiers came and arrested me. Even though I produced my
identification papers, and they knew my husband was in their army at
the time, the soldiers said I was a suspect and arrested me anyway.

She said she had never been connected with any political group, and
had no links with the PRG, the NLF, or any other group.

During the next hour, this tired-looking young woman described sixteen
months of torture; the sort documented in the Amnesty International
report, HOSTAGES OF WAR, the Brown/Luce book . . . ‘I was six
months pregnant at the time of arrest;’ at this point she stopped her
narrative to show me the scars from beatings. Her little boy squirmed
as she bent over; he seemed nervous and unhappy. Have you ever seen

of a prisoner. Vo Que, author of “The Baby Prisoner,” was on that ship
and wrote the poem during the journey.

The Baby Prisoner
by V0 Que

You have been in prison
since birth.
In the arms of Mother
you look like a tiny red mouse.
Prison has forced you
to live a slave’s life.
But Mother has taught you
the power of your homeland.
You have learned through her songs
which are strong enough
To tear down all the walls
and to sweepaway
All the barbed wire fences.

Only the little violets
Are left standing,
The tiny violets
Under the boundless heaven.

Little baby, stop crying.
Stop crying so this sadness
Won’t weigh so heavy on my heart.
Try to finish
This bowl of prison rice
Although it is so tasteless on your lips.
Tomorrow, when you go, i
You shall leave it behind.

Little baby, help yourself to sleep
for beyond these prison walls
Life is forever green
and upn its roof-
The sky is high and wide
with the wind and moon.
The wind and the moon
have lulled you to sleep
While waiting for Father’s return
to open the door of freedom.

22

 

 

In the middle of the night
Mother starts singing again.

You can learn from her songs
thousands of heroic stories

Of our people,
our country.

You Can Act

Day Six
Together in One Hope

‘ You Should Know

A Mennonite volunteer in Vietnam recently interviewed a person just
released from prison:

I visited with a young student who had spent time in the tiger cages. He
had been shackled so long that he had lost use of his legs, but with
medical treatment fortunately they were restored. He had stories to
tell of torture,'hunger and death. Yet he was not bitter or resentful. He
never said a hateful word about those who had tortured him. He dis-
played no antagonism against the Americans who had paid for and
built the tiger cages in which he was kept. He came out of the exper-
ience full of compassion for those who continue to suffer. His com-
munity with those he met in prison was solid, his desire for freedom
stronger than before.

When asked if he knew in advance what the results of his participation
in peace demonstrations would be, he gave an affirmative answer. Asked
if he would do it again, he answered, “definitely.” Asked why he did
not sign the confession papers to avoid more beatings, he answered, ‘‘I
could not betray myself by signing something that was not true. That
would be worse torture than anything they could do to me. I believel
did nothing wrong, and therefore I must be honest.”

Who is the victim, who is the free person? There are those who make
their living arresting and torturing fellow human beings. They are victim
of their fears and suspicions. They are anything but free. They are so
imprisoned that they will even beat a relative, as has sometimes been
the case.

What about those who pay money which is used to build tiger cages
and carry out repression? Are they less repressive simply because they
themselves do not carry out the actual torture? What about those who
close their ears to the cries of their brothers and sisters instead of becom-
ing involved? What about those who fear bringing suffering on themselves
so much that they fail to do what they believe they should do? Are they
prisoners or are they free persons?

What about the governmental systems which establish these laws, build
the prisons and pay for the arrests and tortures? Are they free if they so
fear their population that they must rule with terror and repression? They,
too, are victims.

Let us look at our own lives. We know where much of our money is
going. What are we doing about that? We know that prisons all over the
world, including the United States, are holding prisoners of conscience.
What are we doing about that? We know what actions we should take.
Have we taken those actions, or are we afraid because of the consequences?
Are we prisoners?

You Should Meet

Dong Co was arrested as a young university student of Van Han Budd-
hist University. Victim of the mass arrest of May, 1972, Dong Co and his
older brother spent eight months of “investigation period” at the National
Police Command.

When they were brought before the Military Field Court, the govern-
ment prosecutor accused them of taking part in a communist armed plot
which had assassinated a very important person in Saigon. But, because
there’ was no evidence to convict them, and with pressure from the
Buddhist church, the Military Field Court released them.

Dong Co’s poems, written from inside prison, express the aspirations
of many young people in Vietnam. They desire to study in a time of
peace, when no bombs and shells burst over their heads. They desire to
live in the countryside with their old parents in peace and freedom.

You Will. Understand
I’ll Know You Have Returned
by Dong Co

The afternoon hesitates on the young leaves of the manioc
The sun drops its last rays on the garden.

I stand waiting anxiously by the door.

When birds start to sing in the fruit trees,

I’ll know my son has returned.

The day you left I was sorry
for I had not been able to sell all my areca nuts
to buy new material so I could make clothes for you
to show your friends.
Then, the night after you left
the bullets crashed through the trees and terriﬁed me.

26

 

 

In the morning, our areca trees, our livelihood,

were broken and twisted in the garden.
I spent the day trying to collect the nuts left on the ground,
But even with just a small shallow basket I could not fill it.
I carefully dried those nuts .
Selling enough to survive a whole month.
I pitied Ba Hai Bang,
Her two buffalo were killed by the bombs.
She cried bitterly as if at her father’s funeral,
For in our village, hers were the best.

A day later, the foreigners came into our village.

They came from all directions.

Some were black as Chinese ink, some pale as whitewash.
Searching our poor village from front to back,

They captured half the villagers, and tied them in a line.
Three days later we ventured out to look for them.

Oh! Among the bushes they were lying,

All dead!

Some bodies were ﬂoating in the river.

That day, there was no boat at the ferry-landing.‘
Our people hurriedly left the village,

But promised to return to the land

When there would be no more invaders.

Since the day these invaders began destroying our homeland,

Their heavy footsteps have echoed like the sound of bullets.

I anxiously question traveling visitors for news of people we know
Living in battle fields far away.

Tu Trung, Chu Hai, and Chu Ba De were killed in the Benh Rang attack.

The years and the months passed by.

I waited for you in the daytime and prayed for you at night,
Wondering when this war will end.

When will the shells no longer fall on our heads,

The hunger and fear of napalm cease?

Walking out to the fence one morning
I’ll look at the old New Year’s tree,
With its buds starting to blossom.
Then l’ll know you’ve come back.

I have just finished drying the rice,

And the chickens are satisfied with the rice left on the ground.

I have just built the framework for squash

Which cannot grow, for sun and rain have stopped.

The day will come when planes no longer drop their ﬂares,
Vegetable gardens in our village will be green again,

Hands will be cultivating the land everywhere.

Those lucky enough to survive will return to rebuild their homes.

27

All the young men who had gone to fight on this side or that
Will return as brothers.

When that day comes, I will be very happy.

Chu Ca Bong returns with his sleeve empty,

For he has left his arm in the field.

Cuong comes back on one leg, for a bamboo trap took the other.
They talk about their time in prison.

And on that day, the three parts of Viet Nam
Become One.

The North, the Center, and the South

Will join together in one hope.

Weapons will be replaced by hoes

To break the forest into farms.

Although I have heard nothing about you, my son,
My heart beats more quickly, for I know it won’t be long
Before you return.

With napalm marks and scars

Upon your body. ,

.You Can Act

1) Read and discuss Isiah 2: 1-4

2) Decide what steps you would like to take to become personally free.
Be honest and courageous. When all in the group have made a decision,
break the bars of the model cage and remove the prisoner. The prisoner
represents you, the cage those attitudes and actions which imprison you.

3) For an indepth educational experience, sponsor the Indochina Mobile ‘
Education Project’s exhibit and program.

Forward

In January of 1973, the Vietnam Peace Agreement was ﬁnally signed
in Paris. The world breathed a sigh of relief that peace had once again
returned to the earth. The American G.l.s in Vietnam packed up their gear
and returned home, the Vietnamese released our POWs who were joyfully
reunited with their families and most Americans immediately proceeded to
forget the longest and most devisive war in our history.

But for the Vietnamese, the sweet fruit of peace turned rancid in
their mouths. Peace, independence, unity and sovereignty promised by the
Paris Accords were betrayed. More Vietnamese were killed in the first year
of “peace” than American G.I.s in the ten preceeding years of the war.
The American taxpayers continue to pay nearly $10 million every day to
buy guns and ammunition for the Saigon Government. By congressional
estimates, we are spending as much as USSR and China combined for
military supplies. ’

The Vietnamese most clearly betrayed by the Paris agreements are
the thousands of civilian political prisoners who still remain in South
Vietnamese prisons. The agreements call for their release within 90 days
after signing. To date, only a few thousand have been released. The London
based Amnesty International estimates 100,000 political prisoners are still
detained in South Vietnam —— three times the estimate of the combined
total of political prisoners in the Soviet Union, Brazil, Turkey, Spain,
Ceylon, Portugal, Angola, Mozambique, Czechoslovakia, East Germany
and South Africa. In numbers alone the situation is grotesque, but condi-
tions in the prisons —— hunger, torture and degradation — make this a major
blot on world conscience,

For Americans, the responsibility is even more clear — we have in-
stalled and continue to support the government which has imprisoned so
many of its citizens. We have trained their police, advised their prison
officials and continue to pay for salaries, construction and maintenance
of their entire prison system while we have turned a deaf ear to the
prisoners’ pleas for help.

Let us accept our responsibility for the prison conditions in South
Vietnam. The prisoners remain in jail because you and I maintain the
prison system with our taxes and condone it by our silence. We must
struggle this week not to lavish the prisoners with pity, but to learn from
their strength; not to become immobilized by guilt, but resolve to struggle
for change.

Introduction

Books have been written detailing the Vietnam prisoner situation.
Facts included here as background information have, for the most part,
already been printed elsewhere.

The real strength and originality of Release Us From Bondage is
found in writings and artwork done by prisoners themselves as they com-
municate dreams, fears and doubts. As a study guide, the booklet attempts
to let one sit down beside the prisoner more than it tries to give a broad
base of information.

Ink drawings are done by Buu Chi, a 25-year-old Vietnamese artist
being held in Chi Hoa prison because of his opposition to the Thieu regime.
Well known in Vietnam for his strong, modern style, Buu Chi has been
arrested repeatedly because his art work was found to “weaken the fight-
ing spirit of the army and the people.”

He was picked up by a police patrol in April, 1973, and commanded
to join the armed forces. As the police knew he would, Buu Chi refused
to carry arms and is now awaiting trial for “draft resistance.”

The poems are collected from many writers. Vietnamese people love
poetry, and though they recognize the superior talent of especially gifted
poets, in Vietnam writing poetry is for everyone — farmers, shopkeepers,
students. Thus it is natural that prisoners will tell their stories and express
their feelings through this medium. Many compose poems and songs to
help pass the time. Afraid to write them down, prisoners may memorize
long works and then commit them to papers after they are released.

To our Western ears their works may seem emotional and overly
sentimental. In the West we are taught to suspect those who wear their
hearts on their sleeves. Many of us cling to the belief that an emotional
cry from the heart should be restrained. But the Vietnamese have not lost
their capacity to weep in the face of suffering. These poems are affirma-
tions of feelings on the part of a people who have long been treated by
many Americans as if they had no feelings.

The prisoners speaking here are political prisoners. It is easy for us
to view such people as destructive, bitter radicals. In fact, they may be
the most creative and concerned persons of their society. Their aims are
freedom and independence for their people. The works show many of
them rising above hate and responding to harsh treatment with compas-
sion, patience and long-suffering. Many find community in mutual suffer-
ing. Kien Nam says:

“One morning, chained in the Tiger Cages
We met, and understood each others’ hearts.”

HOW TO USE THE MATERIALS

——Form a small group of about ten personswho will covenant to meet
together daily for a meal for six days. This group will represent the cell
group found in many prisons.

——Serve only one bowl of rice for each person as the meal. The purpose
of this limited fast is not to save food or raise funds but rather to share in
the forced fast of our brothers and sisters in prison.

———Someone in the group constructs in advance a small model of a tiger
cage, perhaps of cardboard, and places a simple paper figure inside. See
the description on page 10. The cage is placed on the center of a table
around which the group gathers. Concentrate on the figure as the materials
are read and during times of meditation, prayer and discussion. The person
represented by the figure is not some distant, unknown individual, but it
is you. You have been beaten. You are starved, sick or paralyzed. You
long for freedom, the bright sun on your face, a chance to laugh and live.
You feel your only crime is the desire for peace.

——Study one chapter each day.
——-—Before parting, try to state what persons in the group are thinking and

feeling. Have any members decided to take a specific action? Can the rest
of the group support them in it?

But if there were none like you

to bear these sufferings,

to ask for independence,

to demand the Vietnamese ’s right to live a human life,
how much longer would our people have to suffer?

  

Day One

Why Did You Resist?

You Should Know

The Phoenix Program began in the mid-1960’s as a means of “neu-
tralizing the Viet Cong infrastructure.” This was carried out by kidnapping,
harassing and assassinating suspects. It was totally an American program,
operating without recognition from the Government of South Vietnam
(GVN). But in time, the program developed into a means of repression by
the GVN over the population.

The Phoenix Program was funded by U.S. tax dollars, and according
to William Colby, presently CIA Director and former head of Phoenix,
20,587 Vietnamese were killed as part of its operations between 1968 and
1971. An operation generally included a sweep through an area of country-
side or a town. Political suspects were picked up and taken to interroga-
tion centers. Many were then placed in prisons without trial; many were
never heard from again. A

At present, the Phoenix Program has been ended, but a Vietnamese
program called F-6, which follows the Phoenix system, still operates. It is
heavily funded by U.S. tax dollars.

The An Tri Law. In South Vietnam a variety of Decree—Laws have
been set up to discourage any type of political activity. Life imprisonment,
hard labor and death are set punishments for crimes including peace dem-
onstrating, advocating neutralism and resisting the police.

Another law called An Tri provides for persons to be held for two
years or longer without trial if they are “considered dangerous to the
national defense and public security.

Adjusted Charges. The Paris agreement makes it illegal to hold
political prisoners. After the ceasefire, many political prisoners simply
had their charges changed to “common criminal” by the Military Field
Court. One such event was described by Huynh Tan Mam, a prisoner in
Chi Hoa:

“Late in March, the Military Field Court went directly to Con-
Son Prison and sentenced at night more than 4,500 people
who were held without trial for years, turning them into regu-
lar prisoners with crimes such as robbery and draft-dodging in
order to avoid releasing them . . . ”
