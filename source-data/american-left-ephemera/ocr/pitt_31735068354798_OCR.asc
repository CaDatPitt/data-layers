they now use every vicious anti-American attack there is in the book.

LETkUS' LOOK at the "record. In the first place loyalty to your

 union hasgained settlementsin the past few. years’ unequalled by any ’

..other_ union. This was achieved through the knowledge that you had "a
_ union that truly represented the workers in thisﬂindustry and with
‘unity of- action could force these gains.

, We as a union have taken hp many‘issues which we felt were
part of the welfare of the worker and,of the country at large. These
issues, in spite of all the lies and assertions to the contrary, were
taken up in a spirit of loyalty for the wellbeing of the people of our
country and_ those of every country in these crucial ‘times. It now
seems that these issues are to be the base of this spurious attack
of those using internal security as their investigation. These proposed
hearings are undeniably to deter our bargaining program. I for one
‘ will be happyto present our case. The filthiest part of all this mess

as Mr.’ Eckert‘.

I can’t help but quote here the thinking of Zechariah Chaffee
.lr., Professor of Law at Harvard, on, a creature of this type: “The
worst spy of all" is the renegade. ‘H e has already doable-crossed the
cormniinity by engagingin wrong doing, and then double—crossed his

A associates by deserting them and helping punish them .  Truth telling .

C does not come natiirally. The renegddem-has to make a good story in

order to obtain immunity ‘ for his own admitted misconditct. Hence
there is great temptation to ea:a_ggera.te or falsify the iliehaviour of his
former associates.” a . - L

, I AM SURE no member of this union ,reg.r.ets the policy of this
International laid down byfits members iniconvention on other mat-
ters such as the Marshall‘Plan and Peace. We stated we were for aid
for the war devastated European: countries, and gave‘ our, support to

this program. This was to feed the unfortunate, and "to; build» their ‘

'_ economy from the grass roots. This was to make friends of’ our
enemies and ucreateda brotherhood of man to‘ insure against further

slaughter and aggression. This was dropped for a program of arms,

We said. ‘this would mean industry and ‘inonopoly reaping the

large proportion of the money, the common people_forgot,ten': What 

an “uproar this createdin CIO, but today, leaders in the'CIO, AFL,
/I ‘ UMWA and Railroad Brotherhoods have visited these countries and
. state ‘that such is the case. . , ~

We asked for peace, for a cease-fire in Korea, note. withdrawal.
We asked this of all nations, not of one. We were accused of the
ridiculous and inane idea that this was a move to weaken our democ-
racy——that it was an inspired Moscow move.

TODAY, people are more and more becoming _ appalled at the
"slaughtering, maiming, mind-destroying actions, and more and more
fearful of a world conflagration which in a single flash can destroy
millions of men,» women and children who have had‘ no part or no say
in its unleashing. Yes, moreand more people the World over are be-.
ginning to raise their voices against it. .

L I wonder if this great surge can be the inspiration oftan enemy
to- our democracy. To me the greatest loyalty to my ‘country is fight-
ing for its preservation through peace, fighting in an understanding
way to gain the friendship of peoples of all nations, to promote con-.
tacts for this through _free trade, to give. more than lip service to
Point 4 of the Truman program—and to exploit these backward na-
tions, their resources, for the benefit of their people and not for the
monopolies.

War breeds hatred. It is a despoiler of friendship, a destroyer of
,3 resources and fa retarder of further social advancement in this highly
' . .civilized day. ~

McCarran was born August 8,\,1876,
in the Truckee Meadows.- His parents,
Patrick, Sr. and Margaret O’Shea

McCarran, were Irish immigrants and
Nevada pioneers. He attended Reno
schools and the University of Nevada.
His autobiobraphy in the Congressional

Directory makes note of the fact that '

he holds a master of arts degree. One
Nevada biographer says that this
degree is honorary and was conferred-
upon him in ‘E915, that he did not grad-
uate from the University ’of Nevada.

There being no law school at Nevada,
McCarran taught himself. He was ad-
mitted to the bar on February 13, 1905;
He hung his shingle in the thriving,
Irrininrg center of Tonopah and Gold-
field (an historic"camp of early West-"
ern Federation "of Miners days). He

‘‘ lived there‘ until 1909, serving in the

meantime as district attorney for Nye
county, and as a member of the Nevada
state legislature. .
S Three years after his return to Reno
he’ was elected an associate justice of
the state supreme court. Later, he-

.. served as chief justice.

from outside, as well as inside, Nevada.
He was Mary 'Pickford’.'s lawyer in
1920 when she sued her film-actor

husband, Owen Moore, for divorce. ,

There was a whole business of charges
of improper residence and what not.

The stﬁe’s attorney general, Leon-,7

ard Fowler, charged that fraud and

perjury had been committed, but the
courts upheld the decree and the sup-

The details of his acquisition of
Mary’ Pickford’s Nevada home are

fuzzy. The known fact is that McCar-V -
ran l_ater took as his own home the '

« palatial ranch—residence of “The Sweet-
heart of America.” ‘ V
Six ‘years later, McCarran decided
he wasready for big things. He scraped
together enough money to’ seek ‘the’
Democratic nomination for U. S. Sen-
ator. He got licked. Then the Hooyer-

Tasker L. Oddie by 1,600 votes in the

no Nevada Democrat had wanted, and

Washington that he was no New Deal-
er, despite his campaign slogan. He
made himself generally obnoxious to
the White House andisoon earned a
reputation as “a Republicanin Demo-
crat’s clothing.” '

He was biding his time. The then
senior senator from Nevada, Democrat
Key‘ Pittman, was in charge of federal
patronage in the state. He had nothing
but disdain for his junior colleague,
a fact that McCarran was to remember
in later” years. When Pittman died,
McCarran. shifted into high gear.~‘With
patronagefirmly in his grasp,“ he set
about building a machine in the state
of Nevada that has’ few counterparts
in American. political history for ruth-

lessness, cynicism, and absolute power. —«

THE McCARRAN MACHINE has all of
the elements of the Tammany, Hague,
Crump, Pendergast, and Kelly-Nash

 

machine. That cog. is known as the
“McCarran Plan” in Nevada politics.

THE McCARRAN PLAN works this
way: K ' _ ' '

‘A young man wants to study, law.
But he’s without funds. Some friend
of a friend gets the word to McCarran.
The young man’s‘ ‘potentialities are
carefully weighed by the self-taught
senior‘ senator. McCarran gets the
youth‘a job on the federal payroll in

Washington.- The matter of funds’

taken care of, McCarran sees to it that

the budding Supreme Court justice. is

accepted by Georgetown university
world-famous Catholic institution in
the nation’s capital. Up to this -point,
the “plan” has hurt no one, except,
perhaps, the taxpayers.

man’s receipt of his law degree, how-
ever, and the time for an expression of

organizations, plus some refinements
that are peculiar to desert politics. It
is a more personal machine than the
big-city combines; it is far more
mobile. Aboveall, it is hyper-sensitive

to irritations. Malcontents are squelched "V

with dispatch and without the finesse
‘sometimes necessary in urban politics.

When a McCarran enemy ispurged,
everyone in the staterknows the reason
and how it‘ was done. The whole idea
is to frighten hell out of others who
may aspire to “independence.” Yet

there are brave and hardy souls in the -'

state who do fight McCarran’s_ auto-

cratic methods.
forces have gained many

allies in. the

The McCarran ,machine is bi-
partisan; no nonsense here ‘about

“party loyalty” and “regularity.” Pat-H

rick Anthony’s influence is as decisive
many times in Republican ranks as it
is in" the ‘Democratic party. Part of
the McCarran technique is to punish

his critics in the Democratic party by

throwing-his machine" support to Re-
publican candidates. ,

critics in Nevada say the grateful"

young lawyer soon becomes an import-
ant addition to the McCarran machine.
Maybe~he’ll find himself as a junior
partner in some important firm. Or
perhaps he’ll get into politics immedi-

ately, running for some minor office, v

or becomingah assistant to some dis-
trict attorney. a

Eventually, he may seek and win
election as a district attorney in one
of Nevada's counties. An important
public official in Nevada told me that

an analysis of the list of Nevada’s :

district attorneys at a given moment
will show a high percentage of “Mc-
Carran Plan” products...

_ On occasion, the McCarran Plan law- ‘

contempt that the Pittmans held for
his ambition and self—importance, Mc-

THE EPITHET that most enemies and

tive.” They cite examples of. sweet.
revenge to prove their points Time

' March 20, 19500, when it described eight

Vail Pittman for daring to run against

sagebrush Caesar had rounded up Re-
publicans to vote against Pittman in
the Democratic primary. ~

Nevada is a state run by lawyers;
At least, that’s an outsider’s impression
based on thegfrequency of attorneys’
names in public life. And yet the state

it necessary for would-be lawyers to

study elsewhere. It is this quirk of

'“ LAS VEGAS SUN/ls fighting for its life against an crmuck by Senator McCarran. The

Sun published part of the Kefuuver crime investigating committee’: report, including
criticism -of McCarran. The Senator then ordered all [us Vegasnight clubs,.hofels and
bars to pull their advertising out of the paper. Full page ud reproduced above is
part of cccampuign to stop this attack on freedom of the press.

‘A .mdn who s'l-rul-s alone‘

tax difficulties, allegedly in return for
tax favors.“ Greenspun’s columns of
the dates cited had quoted from testi-
mony given before the Kefauver Senate
Crime Invesitgating Committee, impli-
cating the senator.”

Following the McCarran phone call,
according, to Greenspun and Baker, 3.
meeting. of the gambling interests on
the stripwas called by Hicks. “As a
_result,” the Sun description of the
events “continued, “all . . . advertising

was cancelled by the defendants.” The ‘

Sun’s.complaint claims “that said’ con-
spiracy further consisted of an attempt
to coerce plantiff to refuse to "print
news of any kind or character, and to
interfere with the dissemination of
news which might in any way be
detrimental 05- mm;-qr’ of the said Pat-
rick A,,‘M‘cCarran . . .’-’. "

It is the Sun’s..charge that McCarran
threatened the gamblers with with-
drawal -of his political support of the
gambling industry and “cause gambling
‘to be outlawed in Nevada.”

The Sun’s’ suit charged the, Las ,.

Vegas resort owners and McCarran
with a violation of .the Sherman,ar5ti-
trust act, “having formed a conspiracy,”_

according to the. newspaper, “in re- ~
,1straint_ of trade and ., . . attempting to
monopolize: a part of ﬂhat trade to/

“benefit a third party, the Las ‘Vegas
Review Journal.” '

McCarran,“ of course, dismissed the
whole-idea of the suit with a_. royal
opinion: “Ridiculous,” he said’, then
went on to piously” remind the people of
‘Nevada that “I don’t have anything to
advertise, so I haven’t any advertising
to withhold.” -

‘A SIMILAR‘ MEETING of the downtown
group of gamblers wasrheld and, they,
too, voted to withdraw their ads, ac’-
cording to Greenspun, who commented
on .Hick’s denial of the whole deal with
this inquiry: - .-

“Why did the downtown clubs sud-

idenlysdecide to follow the lead of the

Strip hotels .-when all they had ever
done was to» battle the -Strip for busi-
ness? . . . And  Mr. Hicks did not
tell the downtown group that it was
the wishes of the senior senator that
the advertising. ‘be: curtailed, why did

Fred Soly and another club owner ad- A
but to Mayor Baker that they curtailed

rri ' Tr"-

    

the ads‘because the senator ordered
it?” '
Then Greenspun drew a conclusion
just. begging to be drawn :'
.“If McCarran’s internal
committee is sincere in its effgrts to
protect this country from its enemies,

‘ then they should look into the recent

attempt on the part of the chairman
of the committee to destroy the free-

_dom of thefpress in his own state.’f .

The Sun’s lawsuit against‘McCarran

' and the Las. Vegas gambling industry
has attracted national attention. Green-A

spun has .many well-wishers who ap-

parently hope that the aging, "desert,

 easy way,-I-0. kill a [free press‘ - i 

sheik has as last got stranded without
at tent to creep into.

- Federal Judge Roger Foley has
issued -an injunction in the Sun’s favor,

ordering the 4 advertisers to reinstate ‘

their space in the newspaper. He has
set next‘ January 5 as the date of the
trial. Meanwhile, attorneys for the
casino operators are preparing. their
appeals. One of Greenspun’s lawyers
is Col. William A. Roberts of‘ Washing-

, ton, D. CL, attorney for Drew Pearson.

Nevadans are licking -their political
chops‘ in anticipation of the all—out

The Madison -(Wisc.) Capital«Times,
a leader in the fight against. Mc-
Carran’s Senate and democracy~baiting
colleague, Jumping Joe McCarthy,
utilized the Sun case to display edito-
rial annoyance with the timidity of the’

press generally in failing to rally to
Greenspun’s support.

“McCarran and McCarthy, obviously,
' have the same attitude toward freedom

‘ of the press,” the'Wisconsin paper

-‘said, “they believe it should be free
to publish what these twins of bigotry A
want to see published.”

“In this case, as in the cases in-which

_ McCarthy sought to organize advertis-'

ing boy'cotts,"the so-called custodians
of the free press in this country have "
been timidly silent. The American
Society of Newspaper Editors and the .
American Publishers Association are
quick to. stand up and thunder their
indignation at some far off threat to
freedom of the press . . . But when Mc-,
C_'arthy and McCarran are carrying on . .
like ju/nior~grade Perons right in their
own backyard they are fearfully silent.
.They might lose an advertiser them-
selves.”

A LAS VEGAS COMMITTEE for Press
Freedom has been organized to, fight
the McCarran—casino gang. Headed" by
citizens such as. Mayor Baker, the com-
mittee is rallying hundreds of Las
Vegas citizens to the cause of free
speech. McCarran has indeed bitten
off .a‘ big hunk this time. What News-

Sun” may yet result in a political »hair- .
‘cut for the silver-crowned tycoon ‘of
Truckee Meadows.

The links: between McCarran and the
gambling industry which the Sun suit
has exposed were .d i s c u s s e d only
casually before. ‘Greenspun bought his

‘ paper from the AFL Typographical

 
 
  

Union and began, printing ‘interesting _  "

tid-bits about various" shady characters, '
who dominate the roulette‘-faro set.
The million-dollar damage suit has set
into motion a -number of wheels within
wheels, the resulting‘ clatter of which
may drown out the protesting wails of
the senator who. is rapidlyp.roving that
he can dish it out, but can’t take. it.

- Gambling was legalized in Nevada in
1931. ~The licensing system ‘was
amended in 1949 to require all gambl-
ing operations to be licensed by the
Stateas well asxby the county or city
in which they .operate. State licenses

-are issued‘ by the Nevada State Tax

Commission which is ‘empowered to
hold hearings ' and -‘grant and revoke
licenses on the basis of the qualifica-

Itions ofgthe’ applicants or ‘licensees.

There is a’ two per cent state tax ‘on
gambling proceeds. An important I

‘ public official. who askedrthat his name

be withheld ;told - me that there was
little doubt that the “joints” zskimmed
-off a good chunk ~-‘of profit .bef’oI'.e‘ re-

ports were ‘filed and taxes levied;

A One boast of the advocates of legal- ,
ized gamblingis that it supports the T
-state and ‘city governments. But the
gamblers have been holding. out and
the state needs more money. .Quiet1y,.
the movement has been built up for a

This wduldmean that Nevada, haven

Saints (Mormon), commented -editor-
ially: L  ' . V
“Senator Pat McCarran, Nevada's“
venerable king-maker, may have over-
stepped. himself at last . _. . We have
little ‘doubt of Senator M'cCarran’s
political power in Nevada. It is com-
mon knowledge through the state. But
if he is attempting to control the press

'. _. . the residents ‘of Nevada should,

flood the senator’s office‘ with their
protests. '

“A group of ‘political scientists polled
recently by Denver University listed

Senator McCarran as No. -87' in. a merit ~
_ ranking “of .96 United States senators.
If Senator McCarran is .attemptin'g"to“

squash ‘criticism aimed at himself‘ by
the press of his state through. intimi-

, porations-,.'and V‘ the big stockmen -would’

escape.

‘GAMBLING is big business, in Ne-
vada ‘as well as elsewhere. . How""big
can be judged from the fact that Gen-
eral Motors’ sales amount to about six,

-billions‘ a yea'r, U.S "Steel, two" billions.

Twenty billion dollars is gambled“na—-
tionally every year. This gigantic'in-
dustry has itd firm «grip on tl1e-pol‘iti-

That McCarran has consistently fought‘
to‘. protect the interests of this big

JESS LARSON, head of Defense Minerals
Procurement Agency, who according to

_ Rep. Walter S. Baring of Nevada, injured

the welfare of small mining operators
at the expense of the big ones. It Is

- chargcl that such deals have been ar-

ranged at the request of Senator Mc-
Carran.

(Continued from Preceding Page)

porters something to the effect that
“the racetrack will go through,” de-

. spite a freeze on steel.

But Smoot ran into trouble. The Se-
curities and Exchange Commission is-

, sued a stop order on the sale of stock.

An amended prospectus was filed and

‘carried through, also quite magically.

‘In December, 1950, apolitical slush
fund waspset up by the race track cor-

to use the money for political purposes.
The siush fund was unaccounted for.
The amount was never announced, but
Smoot was ‘given $10,000 to pay any
additional income tax necessary for
his having received the. slush fund.
Questioned during a recent federal
court hearing into the; disappearance.

. of the corporation’s funds, Smoot was

asked to name individuals who received

cash favors from the- slush fund. He
- refused“ to name any others except
‘ Gov. Charles Russell, ex-Gov. Pittman

and one Roland Wiley. ,

Consulting his file, Francis Quittner,
attorney for the preferred stockholders
committee, asked Smoot if he had not
contributed to “any U. S. Senators,
congressmen, —or lieutenant governors.”
Smoot denied this was true.

As construction of the track pro-

~ ceeded, another SEC stop order was
i‘ issued and Smoot heated the wires to
v McCarran. SEC permitted stock sales

to continue.

Lawyers to whom I spoke in Las
Vegas expressed doubts that Smoot
would ever go to trial.’ It seems there

' is no criminal violation to prove. No

information has been filed. But the
stockholders remember that picture of
McCarran and Smoot which was sup-
posed to reassure‘ them.

if ANOTHER PROMOTER grateful to the
McCarran machine is" Bert Nicholas,

~ who wante to build a Federal homes

PI‘0.l0Ct- e couldn’t get F".H.A. ap-
proval for his big deal. Stymied, he
appealed to McCarran. He then saw
Cal Cory, one of McCarran’s “plan”
lawyers, attorney fo Union Pacific,

cl water Co. and
other plushy clients. Suddenly, all
doors opened for Nicholas. A

. V Wanting a $1,000 evaluation per lot!
. on Boulder City land owned by the

Federal

government, -he had been

‘turned down by Weldon Harrison,

F.H.A. underwriter in Reno. After Ni-

ﬂtholas had turned to Cory, Harrison
...was fired. The evaluation asked’ by

Nicholas was approved out of Wash-
Ington. The project went through.
McCarran is the perfect example of

 Augus"t 25. 'l952i 

No restrictions _on its ‘use.
V were indicated except that Smootywas V

the evolution of a politician from lib-
eral to demagog to arch-reactionary to
pro—fascist. As a young state legis-
lator he successfully sponsored a bill
for the eight—hour day for miners and
smeltermen. As a ,,bitter old man he
successfully sponsored a bill inlCon-
gress which set up concentration camps
in America, a law designed to control
even the thoughts of Americans.

It is logical that a man so hyper-
sensitive to crit-icsm and opposition
should write a law making criticism and
opposition illegal. '

Back in 1935, Today magazine, edited
by Raymond Moley and owned by Vin-
cent Astor, published an article by
Max Stern which described McCarran
as follows:

“The depre'ss.ion is a heyday for all

 

least during this» generation, could of-
fer a rival to McCarran as the most un-
desirable member of the Senate. Com-
pared with him, the late Bilbo of Mis-
sissippi was a knight in shining ar-
mor.”

Time magazine said in November,
1950: '

“. . . Democrat McCarran, during

‘be dismissed as a demagog, but he is

His own illustrationgof his political
outlook reminded McCarran of his
college football days: .

“My first year,” he said, “I was a
left tackle. The next year they moved
me to 'right guard, and I have never
been left of center since.”

Harold L. Ickes’ estimate ‘of ’McCar-
ran’s political vision was more pointed.
He said back-in 1949:

“He (McCarran) is one of the most

' socially retarded members of-the Sen-

ate."
Ickes also said: _

BIG BUSINESS likes Pat McCarran
and the feeling is mutual. In Nevada
they’ll tell you’——a'nd the evidence sup-
ports the charge—-that McCarran is the
senatorial champion of the big metal
mining interests. A close friend of the
aging senator is Jack Kinnear,,form-

-er vice-president of Kennecott Copper

Corporation and now U. S. representa-
tive for copper, lead and zinc on the
International Materials Conference. He
is also assistant to the director of the

One of McCarran’s most powerful ,2

political lieutenants is Jess Larson,
director of the General Services ‘_—Ad-
ministration and head of the Defense,

Minerals Procurement Agency. Larson, 

has done many a political job for Pat,

particularlypwith reference to mining‘;

The extent of Larson’s power in the-
government came to light last April
when Nevada’s Congressman Walter

S. Baring, Democrat, charged that Lar-

son was injuring the welfare of small

mining operators at the expense of

the bigger operators. ‘ _

The big operators, when they Want‘.

for example, find the entire govern-

pay for the construction of new pro-

But let a small.operator trydto gelg-la; *
government assistance and he finds 
men like Larson have grown suddenly
deaf. Baring said flatly that Larson. -

“has no desire or intention to help"

' the small miner.” _ _ _ 
As a political sidelight, it ‘might be
- mentioned that Baring is a former law

partner’ of McCarran. Baring is ‘nom-
inally being supported by McCarran
for re—election this year, but it is

widely known that McCarran’s kiss is-"'

MCCARRAN IS A FAVORITE with the '
big mining operators. Last October he
addressed the American Mining Con-
gress in Los Angeles and hpent ‘an;
hour bemoaning the growth of the"
“socialistic state" in America, a con-
dition which. he blamed on the poli-
cies of\,Fra-nklin D. Roosevelt. He-tips

In his ‘ ‘ W a s-h i n g to n Merry-Go-

cently revealed a “sleeper” which Mc-I

“He came within a-whisker,” Pear-
son said, "‘of slipping an amendment

' on a defense contract for the govern-

“McCarran?s amendment also would

toed by the courts.

In brief, any of McCarran’s contrac-
tor friends who lost money could sim-
ply turn their bills over to the gov-
ernment which would have had to
make up the deficit.” .

McCarran did. not appear on the
floor, but got Senator Eastland, Mis-
sissippi Democrat, to carry the ball
for him. The whole deal came to a
screeching halt when Senator Francis

 , Pearson said that the uncovering of

 In 1‘9,49,,he was \paired against an ap-
1-’; propriation of 54 millions for the con‘- 
..struction of a new TVA ‘steam plant
‘designed to increase the system’s gen-
 erating capacity. . , 1 ' ’
 Each of these votes was a vote for
4 the, big private power interestsand a
‘vote against the people, particularly

 

  *‘labor,» which was fighting for cheaper

power.  _
The Tidelands oil fisaco was another
McCarran adventure. Five hundred
- _ stockholders wanted federal control of
,  the ocean fields.’ But Standard Oil
 had its way; McCarran made like a
Dixiecrat and shouted’ about “state’s
rights,” a neat gimmick in this case
 -« that ‘meant more profit and fewer con-
 9 trols for the big oil barons.. McCarran

"pushed the ,“state’s rights” angle de-

;'  spite the -Supreme‘ Court ruling in 1947

that the government had “paramount
, rights” tothe oil-rich lands beyond the

 - low water mark. v

_ Government officials have contend-
1, ..ed that coastal states such ‘as Cali-
“ ﬂfornia, Texas and Florida have no more
right to oil -reserves under the mar-
ginal seas than inland states have to,"
federal forests and minerals. They
contend revenues from the underwa-
, ter riches should go for- the'_general
-_ welfare of all the people. But McCar-‘
ran has persisted in his “public be
damned attitude. ‘ '

 " .OTHER BIG. BUSINESS FAVORITES‘ of
the Nevada political boss are‘ the big’
'f'.ai'r lines. ‘They particularly likejhim

 cept Pan American and ‘United op-
, ‘;posed the measure on — the grounds

.Chief among McCarran’s pet sup-
porters, of course, are the big stock-
 men of Nevada, whose cause he cham-

-“With energy and persistence worthy

 exploit the public domain in the inter-
estoof the big stockmen who are his
principle political supporters. He has
 been particularly vicious in his attacks
upon the property rights of Indians.
l 4 . Year‘ after year, he has introduced and
pressed bills to give white trespassers

of land for the use of the_ Indians of
Nevada. It is he who is responsible for;

use their own money to buy land. It
was he who helped deny the right of
the Indians to employ their own law-
yers “to defend them.from’his rapa-
cities,” as Ickes put it. . _ - 1

THE PAIUTE INDIANS did not take
McCarran’s W h i te supremacist-big
rancher activities, lying)" down. They

. sent their tribal chairman’ to Washing-
ton to trygto stop McCarran. The chair-
man, , Avery Winnemucca, descendant
of the Paiute Warrior chiefs of the
same name,’got »a job as a street clean-
er in the District of Columbia in order
to stay on and ‘fight —»for_hisipeople.

That great friend of .labor’s anti-
unionirecord overshadows his votes for
the Wagner Act and against Taft-
Hartley. Back in 1937, he voted to
recommit the

1943 to bar the National Labor Rela-
tions Board from holding elections in
certain instances —— an amendment
which Senator Wagner of New York
characterized as follows: i

“What is proposed here will in ef-
fect authorize a company union.”

Pat voted in 1945 to support a pro-
posal of the National Association of
Manufacturers.(introduced by Senator
Scott Lucas of Illinois) to sabotage
the United States Employment Serv-
ice by returning its powers to the
states- The proposal carried. 9

‘\'There is }other, evidence‘ of "Me-

Carran’s master race bigotry. Willard _ ‘

Shelton reported an. incident in the

--1 Sept. 1, 1951 issue of The Nation mag-

£ azine. He told‘ of a witness testifying
before the McCarran committee about
an alleged former colleague, a man
named Finkelstein. The witness testi-
fied that Finkelstein had changed his
'_name to Finley. ' - .
“He would take an Irish’ name,’
wouldn’t he?” McCarran said. ‘
Sielton wrote in ‘disgust:
“And across the guarded face flick.
ered for a moment the tight little glim-
mer of a self-congratulatory smile.”

McCarran’s demagoguery appeals t9 .

such labor bureaucrats as 'A1i‘L Pres-

A revelation of the brittle and shal-
low nature of McCarran’s “opposition”

vote on the substitute bill offe-red by
Senators Chavez, Green, Johnson, Kil-
gore, McGrath,' Magnusson, Murray,

The Baldwin “

i  llmmlgkugusi-11-   I

illustrated earlier this year in a Wage:
Stabilization Board case involving 1
Mine—Mill members at the Nevada-
Massachusetts Co., Tungsten, Nev.

When the case appeared before’ the
review and appeals committee ‘of the
WSB, McCarran sent a representative
from his office to attend as an “oli-
server.” No explanation was given,
butthe “observer” mustehave been 8.
busy little beaver. His name was Ar-
rant, an officer in the Nevada National
Guard. *

The unorganized Hardy’-G e t c h ell
tungsten, mine owners were urging the
WSB. to hold ‘wages down to $1.65 an
hour at Nevada—Massachusetts, on the‘
grounds that Hardy—Getchell I couldn’t—
induce, miners to work for themx if.
other operators paid more! Mine-Mill
had received word that the WSB com-
mittee was originally prepared to grant
$1.83 per hour, in keeping with area
scales. , 1 »

After Arrant came into the picture,
the review committee reversed ‘its po-
sition and held the wages to the figure
requested by the_ unorganized mines.
A few days later, the board upheld a
$1.82 rate in a Utah case.

.Arrant is said to be a “McCarran

' Plan” law student.

/

It is known that recently McCarran“-—

personally called the department of
Labor Conciliation Service “ordering”
them not to “butt in” on the tungsten
case. The Mine-Mill local had shaved
its» demands, but was again turned
down.-

As -far back as 1933, McCarran’s
vote on. various tax measures show
how zealously he protects big bus-
iness. In that year, for example, he‘
voted against prohibiting the issuance '
of tax. exempt secufities, a favorite
millionaireiinvestment dream. ' '

IN ‘I942. he voted against the La-
Follette amendment to increase cor-
\poration income taxes, He’s on record‘
in the same year against Roosevelt’s ,
attempt to limit personal salaries of
corporation officials to $25,000. He
voted“’for an amendment for salaries
to be the highest level reached between
January 1 and September 15, 1942 for
1943.

McCarran voted for the conference
tax bill in“"1943, a measure incorporat-
ing some of the worst features of the
infamous Ruml Tax Plan, drawn up
by Beardsley Ruml, New York banker‘

. and businessman, and special pleader

for wealthy clients who wanted part

On February 22, 1944, President
Roosevelt wrote the first veto of a.
tax bill in history. Of the bill, he
said: “ . . . it is not a tax bill, but a
tax relief bill providing relief not for
the needy but for the greedy.” _Mc-

to override_ the President’s veto. He.
voted in May, 1947, for a bill reducing
income taxes, particularly levies on
big incomes. ’ ‘ _
Pat McCarran’s excursions into‘ for-'
‘eign policy are vulgar affairs replete
with pro-fascist overtones. The men.- ,
tality of a man who‘will author the
crass, anti-democratic provisions of the‘

\.

McCarran Act and- the ‘,new immigra-e _
tion law will lead him, logically to  ‘ '

championing the causes of internation-
al, knaves like Dictator" Franco of

Spain and the Formosan precinct cap-‘ A

The stinginess he displays over fed-
eral funds to aid maltreated Indians

in.his own state is not evident when it _A

comes to raids on the federal treasury
for these two mountebanks. He‘ once
asked a billion dollars for the deposed‘
-Chinese dictator. He succeeded in win-
vning authority for $62'/; million for

Spain in 1950‘and 1951. The follow- 1 «

ing year’s legislation provided for $100 =

Ickes followed McCarran’s friend-
ship for Franco’s cause with anger and
disgust. In August of 1947 he wrote in
New Republic magazine: _‘

“By joining with James A. Farley,
Eric Johnston and other individuals if

Franco, he (McCarran) is not repre-
senting American sentiment. He is

and for those still’ involved in dif-..

VANCOUVER, B. C.—The Cana-
dian dollar is now worth four cents

more than the American, and most
Canadians are already beginning to
bemoan the unfortunate circum-
stance. This may sound strange to
Americans,_but the fact is that the

‘ better his dollar is, the poorer the
Canadian becomes.

Trade among the "U. S. satellites
is carried.on with the dolldii as the
medium. This has lost a huge vol-
ume of trade to the Canadian pro-
ducers in many "lines, who have to
compete with the cheaper dollar of
the United States. v

The British market received most
of the B. C. lumber export; but it
needs no Paul Bunyan to cut for the
export market today, and in relation
to former voélume a boy with a bent
pin could ca ch all the fish the Brit-
ish‘ now buy from Canada.

' PRACTICALL the only voume ex"-'
port from Canada today consists of '
such-raw materials as iron ore, pulp,
and base metals, a circumstance
which recently "prompted the pres-
ident of the slowly awakening Can-
adian Manufacturers Association

to wail. that Canada “is being loaded "

into. b.oxcars: and shipped‘ south of
the line.” C o
On the other hand, the reduced

price of the American dollar en-
able dumping on an unprecedented
scale to be carried on by the Amer-
ican manufacturer. A lot of sur-
plus was always dumped here, but
now, with a premium of four per-
cent, Canada is being flooded with
cheap electrical goods, textiles, (par-
ticularly manufactured dress goods)
and farm and orchard produce.

For instance, this province once
foresaw a fair export trade in ap-
ple and tomato juice from the hot
belts of the interior. But today Cal-
ifornia orange or grapefruit, juice
can be bought in Vancouver for less
money than apple juice squeezed
through Okanagan presses! '

BASE METAL and gold prices are

, set‘ in the U. S., and Canadian mines
have suffered a consequent cut in
their returns. This has not madeit
too difficult for base metal opera-
tors since most of their prices are
highly ‘inflated anyway, but gold
mines _are in considerable difficulty.
Consequently, although the cost-of-
living is on a constant ascent, the
loss of export for revenue gives the
industry a welcome argument for
keeping wages depressed.

. Gold can be sold on_'the free mar- ,
ket, but payment cannot be made
in Canadian funds, but must consist
of manufactured goods. One mine

hunting for a free market in India,
found it wopld have to take in pay-
ment enough rugs and carpeting to
make a boudoir out of half the Gas-
cade Mountains. So, gold -must still
be sold to the U. S. at a price set
there, just to be dumped back into
the ground at Fort Knox.

The gold mining industry is act-
ually in serious crisis, and with some
40,000 people and many comvmuni- »
ties entirely depending on -it, there‘
has been a menacing effect on the -
Canadian wellbeingu ‘

V With cut exports and increased
dumping the country’s economy is
thus in a condition which already
bodes ill for the future. Unemploy-
ment is mounting steadily, _if not
yet spectacularly, and when next

. winter sees the shutdown of the

many construction 5 projects pro-
moted for the, looting of Canadian
resources" by Wall Street, the “Hun-
_ grier Fifties” may commence in,
stern reality. ’ ' .

SO; THE THINKING Canadian
can get onlyemotional ‘satisfaction
out of denganding four“percent~on
the Americ 11 dollar, after years of
hearing their own currency dubbed
“phoney,” in the United States. He
knowsthat the fact may feed his
prid"e,"but will put less grub in his
stomach. ‘ ‘ '
