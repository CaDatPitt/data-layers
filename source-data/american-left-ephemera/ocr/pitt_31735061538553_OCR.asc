‘question of who shall be the master in the land", In their mad‘

drive to conquer and enslave the entire world the American
monopolists are today preparing war against the Soviet Union.
This war program, which may be brought to a head by a crisis
or the fear of a crisis at home, will meet with incalculable
obstacles and difficulties. A war will not solve the internal dilﬁ‘
culties of American imperialism but will rather sharpen and

V complicate them. Such a war will meet with ﬁerce resistance ‘

not imly by the peoples of the USSR, but also by the European
and colonial masses who do not want to be the slaves of Wall

Street. At home the fiercest resistance will be generated. Wall‘

Street’s war drive, aggravating the social crisis, may under
certain conditions actually precipitate it. In any case, another
war will not cancel out the socialist alternative to capitalism
but only pose it more sharply.

The workers’ struggle for power in the US. is not a perspec-
tive of a distant and hazy future but the realistic program of
our epoch.

IX

The revolutionary movement of the American workers is an
organic part of the world revolutionary process. The revolution-
ary upheavals of the European proletariat_which lie ahead
will complement, reinforce and accelerate the revolutionary
developments in the U.S. The liberationist struggles of the
colonial peoples against imperialism which are unfolding before
our eyes will exert a similar inﬂuence. Conversely, each blow
dealt by the American proletariat to the imperialists at home
will stimulate, supplement and intensify the revolutionary strug-
gles in Europe and the colonies. Every reversal suffered by
imperialism anywhere will, in turn, produce ever greater reper-
cussions in this country, generating such speed and power as
will tend to reduce all time-intervals both at home and abroad.

X

The role of America in the world is decisive. Should the
European and colonial revolutions, now on the order of the
day, precede in point of time the culmination of the struggle in
the U.S., they would immediately be confronted with the neces-
sity of defending their conquests against the economic and
military assaults of the American imperialist monster. The
ability of the victorious insurgent peoples everywhere to main-
tain themselves -would depend to a high degree on the strength

. and ﬁghting capacity of the revolutionary labor movement in

America, The ‘American workers would then be obliged to come

time. The Russian Revolution raised the workers and colonial
peoples to their feet. The American Revolution with its hundred-
fold greater power will set in motion revolutionary forces that
will change the face of our planet. The whole Western Hemi~
sphere will quickly be consolidated i.nto the Socialist United

States of North, Central and South America. This invincible I,

power, merging with the revolutionary movements in all parts
of the world, will put an end to the outlived capitalist system
as a whole, and begin the grandiose task of world reconstruction

 Whereas the main problem of the workers in the Russian
Revolution was to maintain their power once they had gained
it, the problem in the United States is almost exclusively the

‘ problem of the conquest of power by the workers. The conquest

‘sensitivelypand violently’ to any infringement upon their living

standards; This has already been demonstrated by the strike
waves in. which great massesjof ‘5conserVa_tive” workers have
resorted to theimost militant andradical course of action. In
the given situation, therefore, the relatively high living standard
of the American workers a revolutionaryiand not, asis com-

» __ monly believed, a conservatizing factor. V
The revolutionary potential of the class is further strength- i A

ened by their traditional militancy coupled with the ability to
react almost spontaneously in defense of their vital interests,

and their singular resourcefulness and ingenuity (the sitdown “

strikesl). ,

Another highly important factor in raising the revolutionary
potential of the American working class is its greatly increased
cohesiveness and homogeneity———a transformation accomplished
in the last quarter of a century. 

Previously, large and decisive sections of the proletariat in

the basic industries were recruited by iymmigration.,These for-e ‘

eign-born workers were handicapped and divided by language
barriers, treated as social pariahs and deprived of citizenship
and the most elementary civil rights. All these circumstances
appeared to be insuperable barriers in the way of their organi-
zation and functioning as a united labor force. In the interven-
ing years, however, these foreign-born workers have been assimi-
lated and “Americanized”. They and their sons today constitute
a powerful, militant and articulate detachment of the organized
labor movement. ‘

An equally signiﬁcant and profound development is repre-
sented by the transformation that has taken place in the position
occupied by the’Negroes. Formerly barred and -deprived of the
rights and benefits of organization by the dominant reactionary

craft unions and, on the other hand, regarded and sometimes a

utilized by the employers as a reserve for strikebreaking pur-

poses, masses of Negroes have since the twenties penetrated into i

the basic industries and into’ the unions. Not less than two mil-

lion Negroes are members of the CIO, AFL and independent "

unions. They have demonstrated in the great strike struggles‘ that
they stand in the front lines of progressiveness and militancy.

The ‘American workers have the advantage of being com-
paratively free, especially among the younger and most militant
layers, from reformist prejudices. The class as a whole has not
been infected with the debilitating poison _of reformism, either

of the classic “Socialist” variety or the latter-day Stalinist,

brand. As a consequence, once they proceed to action, they more
readily accept the most radical -rsolutions. No important section,

of the class,‘ let alone the class asa whole, has been demoralized

13

by ‘defeats. Finally, this youngpand mighty power is being
drawn into the decisive phases of the “class struggle at a tempo
that creates unparalleled premises for mass radicalization.

XIII

Much has been said about the “backwardness” of the Ameri-
can working class as a justiﬁcation for a pessimistic outlook,
the postponement of the socialist revolution to a remote future
and withdrawal from the struggle. This is a very superﬁcial
view of the American workers and their prospects. I

It is true that this class, in many respects the most advanced
and ‘ipI?'o”gressive in the world, has not yet taken the road of
independent political action on a mass scale. But this weakness
can be swiftly overcome. Under the compulsion of objective

W necessity not only backward peoples but backward classes in

advanced countries ﬁnd themselves driven to clear great dis-
tances in single leaps. As -a matter of fact, the American work-
ing class has already made one such leap which hasﬂadvanced it
far ahead of its old positions.

The workers entered the 1929 crisis as an unorganized,
atomized mass imbued with illusions concerning “rugged

‘ individualism,” “private initiative,” “free enterprise,” “the

American Way,-” etc., etc. Less than 10 per cent of the class as
a whole was organized on the trade union ﬁeld (fewer than
3 million out of 33 million in 1929). Moreover, this thin layer
embraced primarily the highly skilled and privileged workers,
organized in antiquated craft unions. The main and most de-
cisive section of the workers knew unionism only as “company

« unionism,” remaining without the beneﬁt, the experience and

even the understanding of the most elementary form of workers’
organization——the trade union. They were regarded and treated
as mere raw material for capitalist exploitation, without rights
or protection or any security of employment.

As a consequence, the 1929 crisis found the working class
helpless and impotent. For three years the masses remained
stunned and disoriented by the disaster. Their resistance was
extremely limited and sporadi-c. But their anger and resentment
accumulated. The next ﬁve years (1933-37), coincident with a
partial revival of industry, witnessed a series of gigantic clashes,

by street ﬁghts and sit-down strikes——an embryonic civil war—the

end result of which was a leap, a giant leap, for millions of
workers from non-existence as an organized force to trade union
consciousness and organization. Once fairly started, the move-
ment for unionism snow-balled, embracing today almost 15
million in ‘all the basic industries.
14

 

 

 

In one leap-——in a brief decade——the American workers at-
tained trade—union consciousness on a higher plane and with
mightier organizations than in any other advanced country. In
the study and analysis of this great transformation, rather than
in vapid ruminations over the “backwardness” of the American
workers, one can ﬁnd the key to prospective future develop-
ments. ‘Under the impact of great events and pressingaiecessities
the American workers will advance beyond the limits of trade
unionism and acquire political class consciousness and organi-
zation in a similar sweeping movement.

XIV

The decisive instrument of the proletarian revolution is the
party of the class conscious vanguard. Failing the leadership of

' such a party, the most favorable revolutionary situations, which

arise from the objective circumstances, cannot be carried
through to the final victory of the proletariat and the beginnings
of planned reorganization of society on socialist foundations.
This »-was demonstrated most conclusively—and positively-—-—in
the 1917 Russian Revolution. This same principled lesson de-
rives no less irrefutably-—-even though negatively—-from the
entire World experience of the epoch of wars, revolutions and
colonial uprisings that began with the outbreak of the First
World War in 1914. '

However, this basic conclusion from the vast and tragic
experience of. the last third of a century, can be and has been
given a reactionary interpretation by a school of neo-revision-
ism, represented by the ideologues, philosophers and preachers
of prostration,capitulation and defeat. They say in effect:
“Since the revolutionary party is small and weak it is idle to

speak of revolutionary possibilities. The weakness of the party .

changes everything.” The authors of this “theory” reject and
repudiate Marxism, embracing in its place the subjective school
of sociology. They isolate the factor of the revolutionary party’:
relative numerical weakness at a particular moment from the

— totality of objective economic and political developments which

creates all the necessary and sufficient conditions for the swift
growth of the revolutionary vanguard party. ,

Given an objectively revolutionary situation, a proletarian
party———even a small one——equipped with a precisely worked out
Marxist program and ﬁrm cadres can expand its forces and

. come to the head of the revolutionary mass movement in a

comparatively brief span of time. ‘This too was proved conclu-

~ sively—and positively—-by the experiences of the Russian Revo-
lution in 1917. There the Bolshevik Party,‘headed by Lenin and

Trotsky, bounded forward from a tiny minority, just emerging

The Coming  
American Revolution

T By James P. Cannon

We have undertaken as our“ central task at this 12th Conven-
tion of the Socialist Workers Party to analyze the present stage
in the development of United States imperialism as it emerged
from the Second World War——and its further perspectives——

q and to draw the necessary conclusions from this analysis.
In our main thesis we deal exclusively with the perspectives '

of the American Revolution. Secondary questions of tactics,
_and even of strategy, are left for consideration under another
point‘ on the agéhda after we have discussed and decided the
main question of perspective. '

Why Are the Theses on Perspectives
Needed Now? » V

The question might be asked: Why are the theses on per-
spectives needed n.ow? In order for the party to see’ clearly on
the road ahead it is necessary to have a main orientation and
a long-range view of future developments. The theses we have

presented are needed at the present moment for a number of

reasons.

First, the whole Trotskyist concept of our epoch as the epoch
of revolutions, has been challenged by a new school of revi-
sionists of Marxism. What answer do we give to this challenge,
with speciﬁc reference to the United States of America?

What conclusions do we draw from the war and its con-
sequences; from the new- power of American imperialism;
from the postwar prosperity; and from the retardation of the
European revolution? What conclusions do we draw from these
great events for the conduct of our own work and for our
own future outlook in the United States?

Secondly, what shall we say to our co-thinkers in other
lands about revolutionary prospects in the United States? They
are surely waiting to hear from our convention on this ques-
tion, for it is of the most vital and decisive importance for them.
This applies to the workers of Europe, but not only to them,

17_

 

 

It applies to the workers of Russia, of South and Central Amer-
ica, of China, Japan, Asia as ‘a whole, India—-—in fact, to the
workers of the whole world which lies today under the shadow I
of American imperialism.

And ﬁnally, what shall the party teach the new members
who today are streaming into our ranks by hundreds and who 
will cometo us tomorrow in thousands? What shall we tell .1
them concretely about the prospects of the revolution in the T
;_ United States? That is what they want to know‘ above every-
7’>"fhing else. ' '

Our document undertakes to give straight answers to all
these questions. ""

Another question may well be asked: What is new in the
“Theses on the American Revolution” presented by the National
Committee? I * . _

In one sense it can be said that nothing is new; for all our
work has “been inspired by, and all our struggles Witl1.0ppO1'-* ~
tunist tendencies have been derived from, a ﬁrm conﬁdence on
our part in the coming victory of the American workers.

In another sense it can be said that everything is new; for
in the theses of the National Committee on the American Revo-

V I
a

 

 

lution we are now statin_g, explicitly and concretely, what has
always been implied in our ﬁghts with opportunist organiza-«
tions, groups and tendencies over questions which were deriva-
tive from this main outlook of ours.

That has been the underlying signiﬁcance of our long
struggle to build a homogeneous combat party.L That has been
the meaning of our stubborn and irreconcilable fight for a single
program uniting the party as a whole; for a democratic and a
centralized and, disciplined party -with a professional leader- ﬁ
ship; for principled politics; for the proletarianization of the “K N
party composition; for the concentration of the party on trade 1,
union work (“trade-unihnization of the party”) ; and, if I may
say so without being misunderstood, for its v“Americani,zation.”
All of this derived from our concept of the realism of revolu-
tionary prospects in America, and of the necessity to create a
party with that perspective in mind.

In short, we have worked and struggled to build a party fit
to lead a -revolution in the United States. At the bottom of all
our conceptions was the basic conception that the proletarian
revolution is a realistic proposition in this country, and not
merely a far-of’f_“ultimate goal,” to be referred to on cere-
monial occasions.

I‘ say that is not new. In fact, it h-as often been expressed by
many of us, including Trotsky, in personal articles and speeches.
But only now, for the ﬁrst time, has it been incorporated in a

’Revo'l‘ution.a x

You will note in your reading of the ‘theses that secondary
questions-» of tactics and even of strategy, with all their im-r

portanee-,2 are left out. And“ this is not by accident or negli-
gence, but by design’; The theses deal only with analysis and
perspectives-——an~d these only in the broadest sense-—becau;se
that‘ is the fundamental basis from’ which we proceed.
Tactical questions and even questions of great strategical
irnpoTttance——such as the alliance of the labor movement and
the Negro people, the role of the returned war Veterans, the
relations between the workers and. the poor farmers and the
urban petty-bourgeoi-sie, the’ questions of fascism and of the
labor p-arty—-these questions with all their great subordinate
irnportanceare left out of the main theses sforgsepairate con-
sideration in‘ other documents. They will be considered at
another time in the convention, because the correct answer to
all of them depends in reality on a correct answer to the main
question of general perspective posed in the theses of the Na-
tional Committee.’ a

Of course, a general line’, a general» perspective, does not

A guarantee that one will always find the right answer to deriva-
tive questions, the secondary issues. But without» such a general

orientation, without this broad over-all ru-ling- conception, it is 

quite hopeless to expect to ﬁnd one’s way in tactical and stra-
etegical quest-ibns. i " ~

The theses have been criticized already by people who deal:

Our theses speciﬁcally outline the revolutionary perspectiifes’ 
. in America and require the party to conduct and regulate all
its daily activity in the light of theseperspectives. ‘

lnternationalism V

Our preoccupation at this convention with American affairs
and American perspectives does not signify a departure on our
part from the time-honor/ed internationalism which has always
distinguished our tendency. Rather, we are ‘taking a step for-
ward in the application of our internationalist concepts to
American affairs. That means to bring them down from the‘
realm of abstraction and give them ﬂesh and blood. ,

_ .We began in 1928 with a struggle ‘for internationalism
against the dogma of “socialism in one country” which “had
been imposed upon the Comintern and all its sections by, the "=

 Stalinist revisionists. That was the most fundamental of all the
principled questions which have shaped and guided the de- l
velopment of our movem_ent_,inVAmerica for the past 18 years.

We said then, and we still believe, that the modern world
is ‘an economic unit; and that not a single’ important social
problem——and certainly not the most important problem, the
socialist reorganization of society——can be deﬁnitively solved
on national grounds. A

With the presentation of the theses of the National Commit-
tee on the perspectives of the American Revolution, we are add~
ing a correlative idea to the following effect: It is no longer

A’ possible to speak seriously about the world socialist revo-—
lution without speciﬁcally including America in the program.
Today that would be almost as utopian as was the theory
of “socialism in one country” when it was first promulgated by
Stalin for Russiain 1924. K A

V This was always true, but it is truer now than ever in the
light of the Second World War and its outcome. The United
States has emerged from the war as the strongest power in the .
‘world, both economically and militarily, Our theses assert that 1 - 
" the role of the United States in further world developments will A
be decisive in all respects. A r V
If the workers in another country, or even in a series of
other countries, take power before the revolutionary victory in
the United States, they will have to defend themselves against /4
the American colossus, armed to the teeth and counter-revolu-
tionary to the core. ' ‘ t
On the other hand, a revolutionary victory in the United
States, signalizing the downfall of the strongest bastion of capi-
talism,gwould seal its doom on an international scale.
Or, in a third variant, if the socialist revolution should be

pushed. back-and retarded, we can still ﬁght and win inthe
United States. And that would again revivethe revolution every-

where else in the world.
Theiworld situation makes it quite clear that platonic inter-

A nationalism is decidedly out of date in this country. Interna-~

tionalism, as the? Trotskyists have conceived it, means ﬁrst of

all, international collaboration. But in our view this interna-

tional collaboration""must signify not only the discussion of the

problems and tasks of co-thinkers in other countries——this is

where platonic internationalism begins and ends—but also the

solution of these problems, above all our own speciﬁc problems,-
in action. That is our conception of internationalism as we mean

to apply it and as we have expressed it in the theses.

One-sided internationalism——preoccupation with far-oﬁ ques-
tions to the exclusion and neglect of the burning problems on
one’s own doorstep-—is a form of escapism from the realities at
home, a caricature of internationalism. This simple truth has _
not always been understood, and there are some people who do
not understand it yet. But our party can justify its existence

only if, beginning with’ an international program, it succeeds
in applying this program to the conditions of American life and ,

conﬁrming it in action.

This presupposes first of all an attentive study of America
and a ﬁrm conﬁdence in its revolutionary perspectives. Those
who are content with the role of commentators on foreign af-
fairs———and it is surprising how many there are~or that of a
Red Cross society to -aid other revolutions in other countries,
will, never lead a revolution in their own country; and in the
long run they will not be of much help to other countries either.
What the other countries need from us, above everything else,
is one small but good revolution in the United States.

Trotskyism———which is only another name for Bolshevism——is
a world doctrine and concerns itself with all questions of world _
import. But let us not f0rget——or rather, let some of us begin i
to recognize for the ﬁrst time———that America, the United States,
is part of the world; in fact, its strongest and most decisive
part, whose further development will be most fateful for the

It is from this point of View that we deem it necessary now
to outline more concretely and more precisely than before our
estimation of American perspectives, and to concentrate on the‘
preparation for them. When we speak of the “Americaniza-

Menshevism.‘ ' g

. Inconsidering the perspectives of the American capitalist

system in general and of the present postwar prosperity in
particular, we observe a peculiar a,nd_,rather interestingvanomaly.
The capitalist masters of society, and their ideologues and eco-
nomic experts, enter the new period with doubts and fears
which they do not conceal; while the greatest conﬁdence in the
long life and good health of the present order of society in
America“ is either openly expressed or tacitly implied by those
who" set themselves up as representatives of the workers——name-V

ly, the oﬂicial leadership of the labor movements and the Men-

sheviks of all grades. p

The American bourgeoisie entered the great boom of the
Twenties with the exuberant conﬁdence and enthusiasm of
alchemists who had ﬁnally discovered the philosopheris stone
which turns everything into gold, In that golden age of American
capitalism a new school of bourgeois economists came from
the colleges to proclaim the glad tidings that Marx had been
refuted by Henry Ford; that American business genius had dis-
covered the secret of full erhiployment and permanent prosperity
Without interfering with the private ownership of the means of
production, but on the contrary, strengthening it and aiding
its concentration. ’

They continued to beat the drums on this theme up to the
year, the month and even to the day when the stupendous myth

of the Twenties was exploded in the stockmarket crash of 1929. .

Theﬁvery week in which the whole structure came tumbling

down, the most learned articles were published in the name of

the most eminent college professors explaining that this pros-
perity was going to go higher and would continue endlessly.

It is true that the labor leaders and the Social Democrats
in this country and throughout the world were captivated by
the myth of permanent prosperity in the Twenties and were
enlisted in the great parade. But they only followed; they did
not lead. The capitalists were in the lead, full of conﬁdence
and optimism in those days. The capitalists and their economists
were fortiﬁed in their faith by their ignorance, and that is a
wonderful fortiﬁcation for some kinds,of faith. _

They simply observed that proﬁts rolled in and productivity
increased at a rate and on a scale never known before, and that
this continued year after year. Hypnotized by the marvelous

empirical phenomenon, they mistook a passing phase for a

permanent condition.
This misunderstanding was widely shared. The myth of the
Twenties penetrated deeply into all social strata in‘ the United

23

 

 

 

 

 

 

States and imbued even the great -mass of the workers ‘Willi-
future hopes of prosperity and security under capitalism. Those" '
were the conditions under which the pioneer communists had to
lay the foundation for a party aiming at the revolution. The C1,»
conﬁdence and illusion in the permanence of the prosperity of
capitalism penetrated dowh into the depths of the working
class itself. . -

T The great boom of the Twenties developed under the most
favorable conditions. The American sector of capitalist econ-

. omy was still in its healthy prime, relying on a vast internal

market of its own which extended from coast to coast and from.
Canada to the Gulf, and on an expanding foreign trade. All
other conditions were'most favorable then.

But in spite of that, it is now. a matter of historical record
that this great boom ended with the stockmarket crash of 1929.
It is a matter of record that the crisis lasted, with some fluctua-
tions, for ten years.

The salient facts and figures about the crisis of the Thirties
are recited in our theses, They show the depth and intensity
of the crisis, its horrible effects in terms of human misery, and
the irreparable blows it dealt to‘ the American capitalist system‘.
National income was cut in half, and with it the living standards

, of the Workers were cut in half. Unemployment reached the

ﬁgure of 20 million out of a working-class population of no
more than 40 million at the time.

The partial recovery, brought about in large measure by_
huge government expenditures, only led to a second sharp.drop

. in 1937, a crisis within the crisis. The crisis as a whole lasteld
for ten solid years. And even then, a way out to the revival

and increase of production and the absorption of the unem-
ployed,‘ was found only in the war and the colossal expenditures
connected with it. ‘

And this artiﬁcially induced recovery, which greatly ex-
panded the productive plant of the country and the numerical,
force of the working class, has only deepened the contradictionsw
and has prepared all the conditions for the explosion of another
crisis, far worse than the Thirties and fraught with far more
serious social implications.

S0, in surveying the future prospects of American _capitalism,.
we simply heed the counsel of realism by putting the question:
If American capitalism was shaken to its foundations by the
crisis of the Thirties, at a time when the world system of cap-
italism—and America along with it, and America especially-—
was‘ younger, richer and healthier than it is now; if this crisis.
lasted for ten years, and even then could not be overcome by
the normal operation of economic laws; if all the basic causes

24

fool can deny it, for the facts are clearly to be seen—-then what
chance has the capitalist boom of the Forties, that we are
living under now, to have a different ending than the boom of
the Twenties? - ‘ a
Marxist realism tells us that it can be different only insofar
as the crisis must go far deeper, must be far more devastating
in its consequences, and must come sooner than it came in the
boom of the Twenties. ' i‘
The specious theory expounded by the foolishly optimistic

V bourgeois economists in the heyday of the capitalist boom of
i the Twenties, to the effect that Marx’ had been outwitted by

American business genius,’ was refuted by the ten~year crisis of
the Thirties——and that crushing refutation remains in the mem-
cry of all. c

How inexcusable, then, how absurd, how downright reac-
tionary is the cultivation of this myth under the new conditions
today! V ‘T v . .

In justice to the bourgeoisie and their ideologists it must-
be admitted that they, instructed by the experiences of the past,‘
now take a far more sober and cautious positionwin their prog-
nostications of the future. The burnt child fears the ﬁre—that is,

’ if he is a bourgeois economist, a businessman, and not a theo-

retical triﬂer.
The bourgeois economists and businessmen talk today far

more of “boom” and bust” than of boom without end. Any‘

busine‘ssmen’s economic review you may pick up at random
expresses’ dark forebodings for the economic future. They speak
quite casually—as though it is a matter of course, to be taken
for ‘granted—-of an impending “shake-out” which will slow
down the wheels of productibn and bankrupt the smaller ﬁrms
which have ﬂourished on the fringes of the boom.

_At ﬁrst, they referred to this process as a “shakedown,” but
that expressed their thoughts too truthfully. And since bourgeois
economists cannot live without lying and dissimulating, they
stoppedtalking about the “shake-down” and ﬁnally- hit on the
euphemistic substitute of a “shake-out.”

Thatsounds better ,but it will notkbe one cent cheaper.

The sole chorus of optimism, where the economic prospects
of American capitalism are concerned, is that raised by the
American variety of Mensheviks. And that is a thin, piping
chorus oftrebles and tremolos, without a bass voice in it, or a
baritone, or even a_; first-class tenor. It is a eunuch’s chorus.

Our fundam_ental.theses on the American Revolution do not‘
tie themselves to the economic lprospectsof the next month or
the next year. They deal exclgusivelylwithy the long-range inevi-
table outcome of the present artiﬁcial prosperity. From the point
of View of our theses it makes no difference whether the deep-
going crisis begins in the earlyspring of 1947, as many bour-
geois economists are predicting; or six months later, as many
others think; or even a year or two later, as is quite possible
in my opinion. Our theses do not consider immediate time-
schedules, but the general perspective. That is what we have to
get in mind ﬁrst.

We take the position that the crisis is inherent in the situa-
tion; that it may not be escaped or avoided; and that this
crisis, when it strikes in full force, will be far deeper and far
more devastating than was thecrisis of the Thirties. As a con-
sequence it will open up the most grandiose. revolutionary
possibilities in the United States. That conception must be at
the base of the policy and perspectives of our party from now on.

The Transformation of the

R I proceed from the discussion of the objective factors in the
broadest sense, as our theses do, to go over to another of the
most fundamental factors making for the coming American
Revolution and its victory. , .

The American working class which confronts the next crisis
will not be the disorganized and helpless mass which met the . ' 
crisis of the Thirties in bewilderment and fear, and even with
meantime, and all these changes redoiind to the advantage of A ’
the revolution.

The proletariat greatly increased in numbers with the ex- A -
pansion of industry during the war. Millions of Negroes, of
women, and of the new generation of youth have been snatched
up out of their former existence and assimilated into the pro-
cesses of modern industry. Thereby, they have been trans-
formed from a multitude of dispersed individuals into a co-
herent body imbued with a new sense of usefulness and power.

Most remarkable of all, the most pregnant with conse- .
quences for the future, is the truly g—ig'antic‘ leap which the 
American workers made from disorganized "individual help- 'i
lessnesis to militant trade union consciousness and organi-
zation in one brief decade. The trade union movement in the
early Thirties embraced barely more than three million mem-

 “One -can point to this fact and say that tliis represents,
V ‘; remarkable growth; But these bare ﬁgures, eloquent as fears, ‘ 
; to do not in themselves, tell the whole story,‘ the true? story. For  L
iogfthe three million-odd “members of the trade unions inithef;
earlY Thirties, the great majority were composed‘ of they tthin,f,,
stratum of the most skilled and privileged workers who: are t’He‘*‘s ff,
most conservative in their social thinking: ‘The great. bulk offi/‘_
workers in the mass production industries———the most decisive
section of the pr'oletariat——were entirely without beneﬁt of‘
organization and had never even known the experience ‘of it.
V In spite of that———or mo‘/re correctly, because of tha_t———wl1'en' 
‘_ theiseiirnass production workers took the road of trade union M
organization, with the partial revival of industry in the middle ii i
, Thirties, they were not impeded by the old baggage and deaden-i
ing routine of the conservative craft ‘unions. They started .from 
scratch with the modern form of organization—-—the industrial . -V
union, forrn——and with the most,\militant methods bf. mass
struggle, which reached their apex in the great wave of sit-
down strikes in 1937. ’ ~ . -
_ A, The beneﬁts these ‘mass production workers derived froiilf V
trade unionism were wrested from the employers in Vopen__j_ 
struggle, and-therefore were all the more ﬁrmly secured. The
stability and cohesiveness of the trade uinion organizations cre-
ated in these struggles were put to the test in the strike wave of?’
the past year. Here we saw a clear demonstration of”'the great
, difference in the relationship of forces between the workers and
;;,the capitalists at the end. of World War II’ from that which,
«prevailied at the end of the First World War, a difference entirely
in favor of the workers. if r
After the successful termination of the First World War
“to make the world safe for democracy,” the‘ ruling class of
America embarked on" a furious reactionary campaign to break
the unions, to establish the open shop and to suppress all forms.
of labor radicalism. In the “Palmer Red Raids” of 19_19,hun-. ..
dreds of political meetings were broken up and thousands of f
radical workers were arrested, hundreds were sent to prison, ,

The great industrial unions of the steel, auto, oil, packing‘-

tion of strike-breakers——the decisive factors in the defeat of
the strikes following ‘World War I—could even be attempted
by the bosses. ' .

Millions and tens of millions of workers in other industries,

proﬁting by the example of the auto, steel, packinghouse, elec-

t » trical and other strikes, and riding on the wave created by them,

gainedpwage increases by “collective bargaining,” while keep-
, ing their unions intact and even‘ strengthening them. A
I Where did this marvelous labor, mpvement come from? Who
created it? i
Here we must pay dueacknowledgement to American capi-
talism. By the blind operationofiits internal laws and method
, of operation, it has created the greatest power in the world-—
the American working class. Here is where Marx takes ‘revenge
on Henry Ford. Capitalism produces many things at a rapid
rate and in great quantities. But its richest contribution to the
further andhigher development ‘of human civilization is the
production of its own grave-digger
- American capitalism, as we know, could not work the
miracle of boom-without-crisis. But inthe period of the Twenties
and Thirties, working blindly and unbeknownst to itself, it
wrought some other wonders which border on the miraculous.
American capitalism took millions of bare—footed country
boys from the bankrupted farms, of the country; put shoes on
them and marched them into the regimented ranks of socially-
operated modern industry; wet them in the rain of the man-
killing speed-up exploitation of the Twenties; dried them in the

sun of the frightful crisis of the Thirties; overworked them on V

“J the assembly line, starved them on the bread-line, mistreated
and abused them; and ﬁnally succeeded in pounding them into
a-coherent body which emerged as a section of the most power-

, ‘ ful and militant trade union movement the world has ever known.

iThis same capitalism took tens of thousands and hundreds V’
of thousands of prejudiced,hill‘-billies from the South, many of
them members and sympathizers of the Ku Klux "Klan; and ‘

thinking to use them, with their ignorance and their prejudices,

as a barrier against unionism, sucked them into the auto and
 ‘rubber factories of Detroit, Akron and other industrial centers.
.. There it sweated them, -humiliated them and drove and exploited

them until it ﬁnally changed them and made new men out of
them. In that harsh school the imported southerners learned to
exchange the insignia of the K.K.K. for the union button of the
iC.I.O., and to turn the Klansman’s ﬁery cross into a bonﬁre to
warm pickets at the factory gate. ’

You won’t find Ku Kluxers or Black Legionnaires in the
auto and rubber factories today- or at any rate, not many of

them. But there is a mighty sight of iﬁrst-class shop stewards and L at A

picket captains who originally came down out of the hills and

up from the bayous of the backward South at the summons of .

American capitalism.

The American working class covered the great distance from

atomization, from non-existence as an organized force, to trade

union consciousness and organization, in one gigantic leap, in i

one brief decade. -

What grandiose perspectivesiithis achievement opens up -for
the future! What are the limits to the future possibilities and
powers of this remarkable class? There are no limits. All things
are possible; and all things that are necessary will be achieved.

If someone had predicted in 1932, at the depthsiof the crisis,

that in ten-years’ time 10 million new workers who had never

known unionism would organize themselves into industrial
unions of the "most modern ‘type and demonstrate their ability to

force the absentee owners of the steel and auto and rubber and _ T
\ other mass production industries to come to terms and not even

to dare to attempt to break the strikes—the skeptics would have

said: “This is fantasy. This is ultradeftﬁradicalism.” ‘ ‘
But it happened just the same.

revolutionists call them, as many of us have learned to our

- i_ sorrow. But they do move when they are ready, and then they/ _ T

  Theses on the

l American Revolution

Adopted by the Twelfth National Convention
of the Socialist Workers Party I

 

‘.9?

 

The United States, the most powerful capitalist country in
history, is a component part of the world capitalist system and
is subject to the same general laws. It suffers from the same in-
curable diseases and is destined to share the same fate. Tlie
overwhelming preponderance of American imperialism does not
exempt it from the decay of world capitalism, but, on the con-
ga trary, acts to involve it ever more deeply, inextricably and hope-
‘ lessly. U. S. capitalism can no more escape from the revolution-
ary consequenges of world capitalist decay than the older Euro-
pean capitalist powers. The blind alley in which world capital-
ism has arrived, and the U. S. with it, exclude_s a new organic“
era of capitalist stabilization, The dominant world position of .
American imperialism now accentuates and aggravates the
death agony of capitalism as a whole.

American imperialism emerged victorious from the Second
World War not merely over its German and Japanese rivals
but also over its “democratic” Allies, especially Great Britain.
‘Today Wall Street unquestionably is the dominant world im-
perialist center. Precisely because it has issued from the war
vastly strengthened in relation to all its capitalist rivals, U. S.
imperialism seems indomitable. So overpowering in all ﬁelds——
diplomatic, military, commercial, ﬁnancial and industrial—is‘
.Wall Street’s preponderance that consolidation pf its world
hegemony seems to be within easy reach. Wall Street hopes to
inaugurate the so-called “American Century.”

In reality, they American ruling class faces more insur-
mountable obstacles in “organizing the world” than confronted
the German bourgeoisie in its repeated and ﬁbortive attempts

» to attain a much more modest goal, namely: “org’anizing

‘ ’ Europe.” __
l The meteoric rise of U. S. imperialism to world supremacy
comes too late. Moreover, American imperialism rests increas-

than that. But they , moved when they were ready andfwhen
conditions were mature for it, and then “they moved on a
scale and at a speediscarcely dreamed of by the pioneers of
0 industrial unionism. - 
The scale of the diﬂerence is remarkable. ‘Bill Haywood,
the great “captain of the IWW——l love to rﬁention ‘his name%
it-used to dream and speak in his intimate circle of the goal of
fa “million members” in the IWW. As a ‘matter. of fact, the
organization never had more than 100,000 at any one time in
all its history, and most of the time only a fraction of that
number. The great strikes of the  which took placein its
J heyday, those great pioneer battles which heralded and blazecli
the way for the CIO~——Lawrence, ‘Akron, Paterson, McKees V
Rocks, the lumber strikes in the Northwest—-—they never involved J > » ;
more than 10 to 20 thousand workers at any one time. A  ,.
But in 1946 nearly two million workers of the C10, with   A
only a few years of trade union experience behind them, were’  
on strike at one time!  
A These comparative ﬁgures show not growth, not simply 
progress, but a veritable transformation of the class. And what. A
has been seen up to now are only the preliminary movements,
the promise and the assurance of far greater movements to
come. Next in order——and not far‘ Aaway—-comes the political

The young generation entering the revolutionary movement
today’, with the goal of socialism shining bright in their far-

The younggeneration coming to us today comes to a party
that foresees the future and prepares for it. They come to a
great"party with a glorious record and a stainless banner, a.
party that has already been prepared for them and awaits their -
enlistment. They come to a strong party, ﬁrmly built on the
granite rock of Marxism. This party will serve them well,‘ and
is worthy of their undivided allegiance.

_.This 12th Convention coincides with the 18th Anniversary of
the party. The experience and tradition of the party are the
capital of the new generation. The work of many people for
two decades has not been done in vain. And, besides that, the
new recruits can ﬁnd in a realistic examination of the objective
facts many assurances that the course of development is work-
ing mightily in favor of the realization of their ideal.

' Our economic analysis has shown that the present boom of 1
American capitalism is heading directly at a rapid pace toward
a crisis; and this will be a profound social crisis which can
lead, in its further development, to an objectively revolutionary
situation.

Our analysis of the labor ‘movement has shown that the

ively and rapidly forward in the field of trade unionism; and
we haveevery right to conﬁdence that they will move even more

the days to come. i

The objective prerequisites “for the social revolution in
America will not be lacking. Capitalism itself will provide
them. The manpower of the revolution will not be lacking
either. The many-millioned masses of the organized workers of
America will provide this manpower. It is already partly as-
sembled and partly ready.

The rest is our part. Our part is to build up this party which
believes in the unlimited power and resources of the American
workers; and believes no less in its‘ own capacity to organize
and lead them to storm and victory.

ingly on the foundations of world economy, insharph contrast '
S to the situation prevailing before the First World War, when

it rested’ primarily on the internal market—the source of if its

previous successes and equilibrium. But the world foundation is ’

today shot through with insoluble contradictions; it suffers

from chronic dislocations andiis mined with revolutionary

powder kegs.

American capitalism, hitherto only partially involved in the
deathvagony of capitalism asa world system, is henceforth
subject to the full and direct impact of all the forces and con-

, tradictions that have debilitated the old capitalist cggntries of

Europe.

The economic prerequisites for the Socialist revolution are
fully matured in the U. S. The political premises are likewise
far more advanced than might appear on the surface.

Ill‘
The U. S. emerged from the Second World .War, just as it

_did in 1918—as the strongest part of the capitalist world. But

here ends the resemblance in the impact and consequences of
the two wars upon the country’s economic life. For in other
major aspects the situation» has'in the meantime drastically
altered.

In 1914-18 continental Europe was the main theater of ‘war;
the rest of the world, especially the colonial countries, was left
virtually untouched by the hostilities. Thus, notonly sections
of continental Europe and England but the main framework. of
the world market itself remained intact. With all its European
competitors embroiled in the war, the way was left clear for
American capitalism to capture markets.

More than‘ this, during the First World War capitalist Eu-
rope itself became a vast market for American industry and
agriculture. The American bourgeoisie drained Europe of her
accumulated wealth of centuries and supplanted their Old W’orld
rivals in the world market. This enabled the ruling class to
convert the U. S. from a debtor into the world’s' banker and
creditor, and simultaneously to expand both the heavy (capital
goods) and the light (consumer goods) industries. Subse-
quently this wartime expansion permitted the fullest possible
development of this country’s domestic market. Finally, not
merely did the American bourgeoisie make vast proﬁts from
the war but the ~,country as a whole emerged much richer. The
relatively cheap price of imperialist participation in World
War I (only a few score billion dollars) was covered many
times over by the accruing economic ‘gains. iii

Profoundly different in its effects is the Second World ‘Var.

\

This time only the .Western hemisphere has been left untouched
_ militarily. The Far East, the main prize of the war, has been

subjected to a devastation second only to that suffered by Ger-
many and Eastern Europe; Continental Europe as well as Eng-

land have been bankrupted by the war.‘The world market has '

been completely disrupted. Thus culminated‘ the process of
shrinking, splintering and undermining that went on in the

interval between the two wars (the withdrawal of one-sixth of ’

the world—'—the USSR——from the "capitalist orbit, the debase-
ment of currency systems, the barter methods of Hitlerite Ger-

many, Japan’s inroads on Asiatic and Latin Americanmarkets,

England’s Empire Preference-System, etc., etc.). ,

Europe, which defaulted on ‘all its prior war and post-war
debts to the U. S., this time served not as an inexhaustible and
highly proﬁtable market, but as a gigantic drain-upon the
wealth and resources of this country in the shape of Lend-
Lease, over-all conversion of __American economy for wartime
production, huge mobilization of manpower, large-scale casual-
ties, and so on. 4 '

With regard to the internal market, the latter, instead of
expanding organically as in 1914-18, experienced in the course
of the Second World War only an artiﬁcial revival based on
war expenditures. ' W

While the bourgeoisie has been fabulously enriched, the

country as a whole .has become much poorer: the astronomic
costs of the War Will never be recouped; ‘
In sum,»the major factors that once served to‘ foster and

’- .

‘fortify American capitalism either no longer exist or are turn-

ing into their opposites.
‘ iV ,

The prosperity that followed the First World.War, which
was hailed as a new capitalist era refuting all Marxist prognosti-
cations, ended in an economic catastrophe. But even this short-
lived prosperity of the Twenties was based on a combination of
circumstances which cannot and will not recur again. In addi-

tion to the factors already listed, it is necessary to stress: (1) ‘-

that American capitalism had a virgin continent to exploit;
(2) that up to a point it had been able to maintain a certain
balance between industry and agriculture; and (3) that the
main base of capitalist expansionhad been its internal market.
So long as these three conditions existed—although they were

already being und,ermined——‘it wasipossible for U. S. capitalism. .

to maintain a relative stability.

The boom in the Twenties nourished the myth of the per-

manent stability of American capitalism, giving rise to pompous

and hollow theories of a “new capitalism,” “American excep-

tionalism,” the “American dream,” and so forth and so on.
—“ The illusions about the possibilities and future of American
capitalism were spread by the reformists and all other apologists
for the ruling class not only at home but abroad. “American-
ism” was the gospel of all the misleaders of the European and
American working class..

What actually happened in the course of the fabulous pros-

perity of the Twenties wasthat under these most favorable con-_

ditions, all the premises for an unparalleled economic catas-
trophe were prepared. Out of it came a chronic crisis of Amer-
ican agriculturel Out of it came a monstrous concentration of
wealth in fewer and fewer hands. Correspondingly, the rest of
the population" became relatively poorer. Thus, while in the

decade of 1920-30, industrial productivity increased by 50 per_

cent, wages rose only 30 per cent. The workers were able, to
buy—in prosperity——proportionately less than before.

The relative impoverishment of the American people is like-
wise mirrored in national wealth statistics. By 1928 the work-
ers’ share of the national wealthihad dropped to 4.7 per cent;
while the farmers retained only 15.4 per cent. At the same time,
the hourgeoisie’s share of the national wealth had risen to 79.9
per cent, with most of it falling into the hands of Sixty F ami-
lies and their retainers.

The distribution of national income likewise expressed this
monstrous disproportion. In 1929, at the peak of prosperity,
36,000 families had the same income as 11 million “lower-
braolcet” families.

This concentration of wealth was a cardinal factor in limit-
ing the absorbing capacity of the internal market.

Compensating external outlets for agriculture and industry

could not be found in a constricting world market.

Moreover, the need to export raw materials and agricul-
tural ‘products tended to further unbalance American foreign
trade. This inescapably led to a further dislocation of the world
market, whose participants were debtor countries, themselves
in need of selling more than they bought in order to cover
payments on their debts, largely owed to the U. S.

While appearing and functioning‘ in the role of stabilizers
of capitalism, the American imperialists were thus its greatest
disrupters both at home and abroad. The U. S. turned out to be
the main source of world instability, the prime aggravator of
imperialist contradictions.

In the interim between the two wars this manifested itself
most graphically in_the fact that all economic convulsions be-
gan in the Republic of the Dollar, the home of “rugged indiv-

 

 

idualism.” This was the case with the ﬁrst post-war crisis of»

1920-21; this was repeated eight years later when the dispro-
portion between agriculture and industry reached the breaking
point and when the internal market had become saturated owing
to the impoverishment of the people at one pole and the ag-
grandizement of the monopolists at the other. The Great Amer-
ican Boom exploded in a crisis which shattered the economic
foundations of all capitalist countries. ' V

V

The economic crisis of 1929 was not a cyclical crisis such
as periodically accompanied organic capitalist development in
the past, leading to new and higher productive levels. It was a
major historical crisis of capitalism in decay, which could not
be overcome through the “normal” channels; that is to say,
through the blind interplay of the laws governing the market.

Production virtually came to a standstill. National income
was cut into less than half, plummeting from 81 billion dollars
in 1929 to 40 billion dollars in 1932. Industry and agriculture
sagged. The army of unemployed swelled tenfold “normal,”
reaching the dizzy ﬁgure of 20 million, According to oﬁicial
estimates, based on 1929 averages, the losses in the years 1930-
38 amounted to 43 million man-years of labor, and 133 billion
dollars of national income.

By 1939 the national debt soared to 40 billion dollars, or
14 billion more than the highest point at the end of the First

World War. The number of unemployed kept hovering at 10»

million. Industry and agriculture stagnated. The foreign trade
of the U.S. in a reduced world market fell to less than half of
its “normal” peacetime share.

What all these ﬁgures really express is the fearsome degra-
dation of living standards of the workers and the middle class,
and the outright pauperization of the “underprivileged one-
third” of the population. The wafer-thin layer of monopolists,
naturally, did not suffer at all, but on the contrary utilized the
crisis in order to gobble up even a larger share of the country’s
wealth and resources. - ‘ 

The bourgeoisie saw no way out of the crisis. They had no
way out. They and their regime remained the main obstacle in
the way not only of domestic but of world recovery. In its down-
ward plunge, the American bourgeoisie dragged the rest of the
capitalist world with it, and ‘kept it down.

Decisive is the fact that despite all the “pump-priming,”
“brain-trusting,” and emergency “reforms,” American capi-
talism was incapable of solving the crisis. The partial upswing

.— of 1934-37 proved to be temporary and passing in character.

.7

 

 

  

The preci'pitousV, drop that occurred in 19371 revealed the -abyss

 

  

facing ‘American capitalism. The threatening new downward,

plunge was cut off only by the huge expenditures made in

preparation for the Second World War. it '
Only the war temporarily resolved the economic crisis which

had lasted in both hemispheres for ten years. The grim reality,

 

however, is that this “solution” has solved exactly nothing. Least .

of all did it remove or even mitigate a single one of the basic
causes for the crisis of 1929.

VI

The basis ofthe current American post-war prosperity is
the artiﬁcial /expansion of industry- and agriculture through

unprecedented government spending which is swelling constantly.

the enormous national debt. In its ﬁctitious character the war
and post-war boom of the early Forties far exceeds the orgy
engaged in by European capitalism during 1914-18 and the
immediate post-war years.

The diversion of production into war industry on an un-
heard-of scale resulted in\temporary shortages of consumer
goods. The home and foreign markets seemed to acquire a

 

new absorbing capacity. Universal scarcities andwar havoc are _

acting as temporary “spurs to production, especially in the con--
Iumers’ goods ﬁeld. ' . A V _
Over-all there is, however, the universal impoverishment,

 disrupted economic, ﬁscal and governmental systems-—

coupled with theichronic diseases and contradictions of capi-

talism, not softened but aggravated by the war.

If we multiply the condition in which European capitalism,
with England at its head, emerged from the First World War

' by ten times and in some instances a hundred times——because

of 'the vaster scale of the consequences of World War II’——then

- we will arrive at an approximation of the actual state of Ameri-

can capitalism.

Every single factor underlying the current'“peacetime” pros-
perity is ephemeral. This country has emerged not richer from
the Second World War as was the case in the Twenties, but
poorer—in a far more impoverished world. The disproportion
between agriculture and industry has iikewise increased tremen-
dously, despite the hot-house" expansion of agriculture. The

concentration of wealth and the polarization of the American

population into rich and poor has continued at aforced pace.

The basic conditions that precipitated the 1929 crisis when
American capitalism enjoyed its fullest health, not only persist
but have grown more malignant. Once the internal market is

‘again saturated, no adequate outlet can be hoped for in the

 

 

  

unbalanced world market-. The’ enormously augmented produce
tivel capacity of the U.S. collides ‘against the limits of the world
market and its shrinking capacity. Ruined Europe herself needs

to export. So does the ruined Orient, whose equilibrium has
been ruptured by the shattering of Japan, its most advanced

ICCIOI.
.e

. Europe is in dire need of billions in loans._In.addition’ to”:

Lend-Lease, Wall Street ‘has already pumped almost 5 billion
dollars in loans into England; almost 2 billions into France;
and smaller sums into the other satellite countries of Western
urope——without, however, achieving any semblance of sta-
bilization there. Bankrupt capitalist Europe remains both a
competitor on the, world market and a bottomless drain. The
Orient, too, needs loans, especially China, which,’ while in the
throes of civil war, has already swallowed up as many American
dollars as did Germany in the early Twenties. '

At home, the explosive materials are accumulating at a truly
American tempo. Carrying charges on the huge national debt;
e astronomic military “peacetime” budget (18.5 billion dol-
lars fog this year); the inﬂation, the- “overhead expenditures”
of Wall Street’s program of world domination, etc., etc.—all
this can come from one source and one only: national income.
In plain words,’from the purchasing power of the masses.
Degradation ofaworkers’ living conditions and the pauperiza-
tion of thecfarmers and the urban middle class——thNat is the
meaning of Wall Street’s program. ‘

r VII

The following conclusion flows from the objective situation:
U.S. imperialism which proved incapable of recovering from
its crisis and stabilizing itself in the ‘ten-year period preceding

the outbreak of the Second World War is heading for an even

more catastrophic explosion in the current post-war era. The
cardinal factor which’will light the fuse is this :~ The home
market, after an initial and artiﬁcial revival, must contract. It
cannot expand as it did in the Twenties. What is really in store
is not unbounded prosperity but a short-lived boom. In the wake
of the boom must come another crisis and depression which
will make the 1929-32 co/nditions look prosperous by com-V
parison. — ' '

The impending economic paroxysms must, under the existing
conditions, pass inexorably into the social and political CI'1S1S

~ of American capitalism, posing in its course pointblank the-. .
