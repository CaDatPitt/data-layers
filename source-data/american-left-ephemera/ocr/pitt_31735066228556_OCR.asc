proposition made by the Socialists.
, CONFISCATION

The question now arises, how will the
Socialists take possession of the trusts?
There are a great many ways of getting
hold of the /other fellow’s property. One
way is by conﬁscation, which means to
swipe, to hook, to take the other fellow’s
property without saying “Thank you,” or
“Please, ma’am,” and without batting an
eye. And we Socialists have the reputa-
tion of being the ﬁrst conﬁscators that ever
came down the pike. If it were not for the
grand old Republican Party that stands

like a rock on the shore, throwing back the

waves of conﬁscation and repudiation, the
Socialists would have swiped John D.
Rockefeller’s grease business long ago.
Certainly the Republican Party never
conﬁscated anybody else’s property. ~Far
be it from such! But let us refresh the

. memory of our Republican friends. About
1863, when that party was still young, it‘

conﬁscated ﬁve million chattel slaves,
valued at one billion dollars, and belong-
ing to the Southern people. Here was
property—private property—holy, sancti-
ﬁed, private property—recognized as‘ such
by the constitution of the United States,
and upheld by every decision of the Su-
preme Court of the United States, yet our
Republican friends went down to Dixie,
hooked and swiped all that property, and
never paid a counterfeit nickel with a hole
in it to the rightful, legitimate owners.
The men who defended private property in
1863, were called rebels and traitors, and
our Republican friends even used to sing a
cruel song about hanging Jeff Davis to a

10

   '

sour apple tree, and yet the _only .-crime

committed by Jefferson Davis and his.

crowd" was, that they defended private
property in black men.

Certainly, our Democratic friends
would never do such a thing. But some
time ago, in the state of Oklahoma, that
party had 40,000 majority. It was then
that these‘ good Democrats established pro-
hibition. By doing so they conﬁscated
every booze joint, saloon and brewery in
the state. Anheuser-Busch of St. Louis had
invested a million dollars of hard earned
money in a brand new brewery in Okla-
homa City-———invested a million dollars
earned in the sweat of their brow, the
fruit of their thrift and frugality, the re-
ward of their abstinence, in a legitimate in-
dustry, and our good Democrats destroyed
all that value, wiped out the whole indus-
try with the scratch of a lead pencil, and
never offered a wooden nickel as indemnity
to the rightful owners.

Later, the idea spread to other states,
and- both Republicans and Democrats
joined in putting through national prohibi-
tion—conﬁscating additional millions of
dollars of property.

This was conﬁscation with a vengeance.
If the time ever should come when we So-

- cialists have to go into the conﬁscating

business, we shall be only too glad to turn
the job over to the Republicans and Demo-
ocrats, for we believe they are past masters
in the gentle art of conﬁscation.

ANOTHER WAY
Conﬁscation is one way of acquiring

other people’s property, but it may not be
the best way. Slavery was abolished in the

11

 

‘ just behind his ears!

'’'..'y.s_'._-.,-'. . —.,..-.....l, .......-.;-... L.‘-‘-'-‘gt-’—;'...k.......'.--.....'.'.'.. -.‘ . ;.. .. .

coloniesof England, Portugal and Spain,

"by paying an indemnity to the slave own-

ers. In the long run, this was cheaper
than the American way, for the freedom of

these ﬁve million chattel slaves, valued at 1
.one billion dollars in 1861, has cost the

American peopleby this time about ten
billion dollars in"money, hundreds of'thou-
sands of valuable young lives, seas of blood
and rivers of tears. - After all, the price
was too big to pay.

Up to 1789 the soil of France belonged
to the clergy’ and the nobility. About that
time the French people raised a disturb-
ance. During the excitement, some of the
nobles and clericals lost their heads and
ran off to Germany. Still others lost their
heads like the dog did———his tail was cut off
Their land was in-
herited by the French peasantry. It looks
like a cheap Way of acquiring land, and yet
the French revolution, followed by the Na-
poleonic war, cost more money, lives and
blood, than the soil of France is worth
even today. , ‘

A similar condition to that in France,
in regard to land ownership, existed in
Prussia until 1815. In that year the Stein
laws were enacted, which allowed the serfs
to purchase land from their former mas-
ters on the installment plan. It required
many years to do this, but in the end, it
was a cheaper way than the one taken by
the people of France.

We Socialists, who understand history,
are not pledged to conﬁscation, and, for the
sake of expediency, we are perfectly will-
ing to pay the trust owners for their prop-
erty in their own coin.

a  , ,, ACQUIRING STANDARD OIL

The question now arises, how. will So-
cialists do this? Let us take for illustra-
tion, the Standard Oil Company. 4 This
concern is a perfect illustration of the fu-
~tility of “busting the trusts.” When it was
organized in 1870, the business atmosphere
was dominated by the ideal of competition.
John D. held a different view. His ideal
was a large well-organized efficiently man-
"9 aged industrial unit, based on the principal
T of co-operation rather than of competition,
and from his ﬁrst investment in an oil re- .-

_.+ ﬁnery in 1862, through the organization of
the Standard Oil Company and during the
succeeding years, Rockefeller did his best
to get his potential competitors to come in-
side and share the benefits of joint effort.
Acting on this principle, within ten years’,
he had in the Standard Oil control more
than nine-tenths of the oil reﬁning busi-
ness of the country. The manner in
which the competitors were urged to come
inside is told‘ by Miss Ida M. Tarbell, in
“The History of the Standard .Oil Com-
pany” when she says: ‘

“There is no gaming table in the world
where loaded dice are tolerated, no athletic
ﬁeld where men must not start fair. Yet

.-?'~ Mr. Rockefeller has systematically played
with loaded dice, and it is doubtful if there
has ever been a time since 1872 when he has
run a race with a competitor and started
fair.

“In many of the great State Legisla-
tures one of the ﬁrst persons to be pointed
out to a visitor is the Standard Oil lobby-
ist. Now, no one can dispute the right of
the Standard Oil Company to express its

 1 opinions on proposed legislation... It has
 ' ' _ the same right to do this as all the rest of
' the world. It is only the character of its
iii, opposition which is open to" criticism, the
' -' fact that it is always ﬁghting measures
which equalize privileges and which make
it more necessary for men to start fair and
‘ play fair in doing business.”
__ , Standard Oil quickly became one of the
»?i ' masters in American public life and those
'»_ - a who questioned its sway or crossed its path
 made a quick exit from public office. So in-

_  \ u ‘-

 .  sistent became the demand for public action

 '0 that on May 11, 1911, the United States Su- .

 A ‘ preme Court handed down a decree declar- «’

 ing the Standard Oil Company, a trust in

*5}; restraint of trade, and ordering its dissolu-

gi tion into a number of constituent compa-

'i’:‘~. nies; such as, The Standard of New Jer-

sey, of Indiana, and the like. The events

that followed show an interesting side

light on the relative powers of the Supreme

J21 V Court and of the Standard Oil Company.

’ Standard Oil’s stock, at the time of the

,, ‘ Supreme Court’s decree_ had a paper value §

if ' of about $98,000,000. During the next ten ~,

‘ years the entire cash and stock dividends «:5

paid by the “dissolved companies” (the 7

Standard Oil Properties as they are now ‘:

called) had a market value of $1,833,000,- f,,;

3 000. More than eighteen times the capital

V value of the property ten years before. The - «'
market value of the stock of the “dissolved
companies” in 1921 was $3,276,000,000, or j
about thirty-ﬁve times the capital value in 3

 1911. »Also, the amount of dividends has

 been steadily mounting year after year.

 This is merely the" proﬁt side of the

3]; . 1 problem. On February 28, 1925 the Fed- ;

 14 

 

eral Trade Commission reported that- the
Standard Oil Company still set the price
of oil for the country.

Now let us suppose that we have a ma- A 3'

jority of Socialists in Congress, and these
men decide that the Standard Oil properties
shall become the property of Uncle Sam,
and shall be run like the postal depart-
ment, not for the proﬁt of the few, but to

; serve the many. They will send Uncle Sam

43 to John D. Rockefeller and he will say:

J “Rocky, the boys down in Congress have

‘-4 decided to buy out your grease business.” .

,5 “What’s that for?” says Rockefeller. “Oh,”
says Uncle Sam, “the boys say that at one
time you were all right; you organized the
grease business, you eliminated the foolish
waste, strife and competition. But of late,
you have become the durndest nuisance
we have in this country, for,.instead of
sticking strictly to the grease business, you
have gone into the government business
also.

“The boys say it’s got to stop. You
have got to go out of the government busi-
ness, and the only way we can put you out
of the government business, is by putting
you out of the grease business, for you are
 only in the government business to protect
‘“ your grease business.”

;- “Well,” says Rockefeller, “an all-wise

E providence has entrusted me with the run-

'ning of the oil industry. I cannot relin-
quish this sacred trust.”

“Well,” says Uncle Sam, “every year
my government takes millions of dollars
worth of property for public use through
its power of eminent domain, and you are
not exempt from that. Our courts, our po-

 ‘  lice_, and our army are here to see that
’ Uncle Sam’s decisions are carried out.”

John D. is one of those long-headed
 business men we read about in the Sunday
. " papers, and before Rocky goes to jail he
‘ will say: . “Uncle, I'll take your money.”

1 WHERE ARE YOU GOING TO GET THE

 . _ MONEY?

 Now comes our Republican and Dem-

 l ocrat doubting Thomas, and says: “Well

‘i and good, but where are you going to get 
the money from?” Well, boys, I’ll tell you. I

R Uncle Sam runs a, "great money factory in W
the City of ,Washington, Where he makes

. all kinds of m0ney——green-backs and yel-
low-backs, and as long as he puts his name

? to"it, it is good money. The boys in that

3 great money-shop work by the day and not

, by the piece, and they don’t care a conti-

_ I nental how many ciphers they put behind

Al, a ﬁgure. They’d just as soon make a thou-

: :._' 4.2;‘ .'.:.::1:;..:'_.-..

j sand dollar bill as a one dollar bill.
1‘ Uncle Sam steps into the shop some
lg _ afternoon and says:
“,3 “Boys, a condemnation jury has just
I decided that the Standard Oil Companies
R5; are worth a billion dollars with the Water
'4‘ . squeezed out. I want you to make me a
, billion dollars of gold bonds like you made
gj when We. bought the Panama Canal. Make
7 R them 3%. . L
It’s half past three now. We quit at
ﬁve o’clock. Now be sure and have that
4 billion ready before quitting time, and
 ' ‘,_don’t you spend more than 75 cents’ worth
4  of paper on the old geezer.” Well, ﬁve
‘ ‘ o’clock comes. Uncle Sam turns the bonds
53 over to Rockefeller, and the boys go home
for supper. Rockefeller has the money and

, _ * 16
.{={«f"‘i.
I

Uncle Sam has the grease business.

HOW ARE YOU GOING TO RUN IT?
“Well,” says our opponent, “you have

got it all right enough, but how will you run  tn  " ii
it?” The answer of the Socialist is: “We’ll i

run it with the same people who run it
now.” For in the Standard Oil Company,
as in every modern industry, the separation
between ownership and labor is perfect.
Those who own the business do not run it,
and those who run the business do not own

it. It is immaterial to the employes of the '

Standard Oil Company whether they work
for Uncle Sam or for John D. Rockefeller.

They may not know all of Uncle Sam’s nep- ‘

hews and nieces, but neither do they know

the stockholders of the Standard Oil Com-'

pany. From the manager and superintend-
ent, expert accountant and auditor, chemist
and salesman, clean down to the tank wagon

‘ driver, they are all hired hands. All they

want is a good job and regular pay. Uncle
Sam has always been a better boss, paid
higher wages and given better working con-
ditions than any other boss in this country.

Uncle Sam will call all these working
people together and say: “Boys, I have
bought Rockefeller’s grease business. From
now on you are working for me. "=%¥~ask you
to work for the same wages and the same
hours as you did before for a while. I would
like to raise your wages, but can’t do it just
now, because, I owe that old skinﬂint a bil-
lion dollars, and the money has got to come
out of the business.” And then he will turn
around to the consumer and say: “You have
been in the habit of paying twenty cents for
a gallon of gasoline. We are going to cut

17

 

 

r. I "—-V.‘-.— :.:— .-.~s—-r- -«;.-—..-,.~ ._.,,._

  

down that price by and by, but not until

‘ Rockefeller is paid}?

Well, do you think that the boys would
run away from their jobs, just because we
got Socialism in the grease business? Do
you believe that the Republicans and the
Democrats, who voted against it, would run
away fromthe job ?‘ Have you ever heard
of a Republican or a Democrat who ever ran
away from a government 3' ob? Is it not a
fact that_they' are running their legs off,
cl-ear up to the second knuckle, just to get a
government job? And so it will be perfect-
ly safe to assume they will hang onto their
positions, and give to Uncle Sam the same
faithful service that they formerly gave to
Rocky. '

Now, if the same people who worked for
the Standard, will work for the government
for the same wages and the same number of
hours, and if the ’ product is sold for the
same price to the consumer, then it follows,
as day follows night, that the proﬁts at the

end of the year will be the same as before, '

and since these yearly proﬁts just about
equal one—half the value of the Standard
Oil Company, we are able to give to Mr.
Rockefeller the billion dollars at the end of
a very few years and he returns our bonds.

From now on we have Socialism in the
grease business proper. Dividends and in-
terest are abolished. Every one of the

employes of the Standard created a surplus

for the stockholders of several thousand
dollars a year. But there are no more
stockholders to be paid, no more melons to

V be cut. The proﬁt will be divided among

the producers and the consumers. Uncle
 " “ 18

--———.<.----~,- ...

.___._‘.——--- --

Sam could take, ‘say $2,000 out of that sum‘
to increase the wage of each worker, and‘

he will still be able to distribute several
thousand dollars among the consumers in
the form of cheaper oil, gasoline and grease.

THE DREADFUL RESULTS
Now, what do you suppose would hap-

’ pen? Understand, we have Socialism in the

grease business. Imagine one of those poor
workingmen coming home on pay-night,
with $50 instead of the usual ten-spot, in
his pay envelope. The ﬁrst thing he would
do, would be to give his wife-a black eye,
kick the children out of the house, smash
the dishes, and break the furniture. You
see, he is mad, mad all over. He is furious
because they raised his wages. That’s
enough to make anybody mad.

The next Sunday morning, he will go to A
~ church for the last time, and when the

preacher comes around fora little contribu-
tion, he tells him to go to the devil. That
man had his wages raised-from $10 to $50.
That’s enough to cause anybody to lose his
religion. And on Monday morning, he re-

. fuses point blank to go back to work, for

what incentive has a man to work for $50
a week for the government, as long as he can
get a $10 job on the outside?

Isn’t that about the sum total of all-the
objections that they bring against Social-
ism? Don’t they come around to V011 and
say: “Socialism would break up the fam-

ily, destroy religion, and rob men of all in-
centive to labor?" Well, I had my wages
raised once or twice in my life, never from
$10 to $50; that delicate constitution of .

mine wouldn’t have stood the shock; so they -
I broke ‘the news to me gradually, by raising

my salary about 50 cents at a time. t And, if
I am able to judge the feeling of a. man who
gets a $40 raise by the emotion that used to
surge through my heart when I got a 50
cent raise, that fellow is going to act alto-
gether differently than the opponents of So-
cialism are trying to make us believe.

BREAKING UP THE HOME 3

I'll tell you how that fellow will act.
Heill come home all out of breath, throw the
dinner pail as far as he can throw it, and
shout at the top of his voice: “Hurrah, old
lady, come out here! Uncle Sam raised my
Wages from $10 to $50.. Put on your glad
rags and dress up the kids.‘ Let’s go down
town and take in every dog—gone picture
show on the white way.” Then he throws
in a couple of hugs and smacks and kisses
that can’t be expressed in words.

DESTROYING RELIGION

But will he still go to church? Oh, I
guess he would._ In fact I, am pretty sure he
would, because he bought himself a new suit
of clothes on Saturday night.. His old girl
got a spiffy hat, and all the kids have new
shoes. You couldn’t keep that family out of
church with an ox team. And there they’ll

.-be," bright and early Sunday morning, all

togged’ up in their new ﬁneries, but instead
of standing up in the Amen corner, kind of
humble like, they’ll walk right up to the
front, and take a seat; because from now on,

they can pay the pew rent, and don’t have .

to stand up along the walls. And when the

_ preacher comes around for a little money
 to; pay for the new carpet, or to buy a pipe

er a lead slug, or a counterfeit quarter, or a
beer check from Kansas City when he lives
in Cincinnati, he goes down in his new pants
pocket and he yanks out a roll of dollar
bills, with a ﬁve—spot wrapped around the
outside. He peels off the aforesaid ﬁve-
spot, forks it over to the preacher, and says:
“Here, Parson, take this V; go and buy
yourself a square meal. You never had one

under capitalism anyhow, and if that ain’t «

enough, come around for more.”
THE LOSS OF INCENTIVE

" But how about that incentive? Wouldn’t
he lose his ambition to work? Did you ever
see a mule that had an incentive for any-
thing? Now if you want to give an incen-
tive to a mule, tie a stick to his neck and
hang a bundle of alfalfa hay about two feet
The first thing that mule-
does is to stretch his neck. In all yourllife,
did you ever see such a stretching as that
mule is doing now? You see, he never had
an incentive to stretch his neck like that
before. Unable to reach the hay, he takes a
step forward and then another, and still an-
other, and by and by he falls into a trot, and
before long he runs with all his might and
main, and if he is big enough of a mu_l“e,;_,he~

will run until he falls down “é){-ha31isité_fEl«§A~.

You see, as long as the mule can’t get the

_hay, he has an incentive to run after it.
. Now, if the mule should get a little horse

sense, break the stick and eat the hay, he
would lose his incentive to run. a ‘

The great question for the philosophers
and political economists to decide is: Is

V the mule after the hay, or does he want the '

incentive? Most_ mules of my acquaint-
ance, don’t seem to care much about the in-
. centive. All they want is the hay. But I
If _ .have met a great many two-legged mules,
‘ who don’t seem to care for the hay, but are
hell bound to have the run. .We Socialists
don’t belong to that kind. We want the hay, -
and if the other fellow wants the run with-
’ out the hay, bless his little heart, let him
A have it. -
A LIE, A LIE, A HORRIBLE LIE *
. Some people may not believe that Rocke-
.. feller doesn’t run the Standard Oil Com-
? ’ pany,- but we will let the old gentleman V
speak for himself. - 5
Years ago, when he was in Judge Landis’ ’
, court in Chicago, where he was ﬁned $29,- :
.§ _ 000,090 for disorderly conduct, every cent of 
‘g which he paid, NIT! he testiﬁed under oath 3
‘ ——-and, mind you, Rocky was over 70 years
old and a Baptistdeacon besides, so he sure-
ly Wouldn’t lie: “For nine years I haven’t
 been on the inside of an office belonging to
L the Standard Oil Company.” A
» V Nobody has seen him in one since.
= Then there are still.' other doubting 
; «Thomases who don’t believe that the proﬁts 2
g’  of the Standard are quite as big as stated 
4. -.-.:*"above, and again we call on Mr. Rockefeller 3
to testify in our behalf. Some years ago,
Frank Monett, the attorney general of Ohio,
brought “ouster proceedings” against the
, Standard. Henroved by expert testimony
 that it only cost one cent to manufacture a 3
‘[3 gallon of coal oil or gasoline. This got 
 -Rockefeller excited, and he asked to be put ‘
I

on the stand once more, where he swore that 

it was a lie, a lie, a horrible lie, that it cost “

,  two ?c‘er=its. J

Now, to a man up a tree, it looks as if
the difference between two cents and twenty
cents leaves a fairly good margin.

I realize that a billion dollars isn’t very
much money nowadays. I found that out
in my own experience. At the present price
of meat and flour, vegetables and house

rent, a billion dollars doesn’t go very far,"

and if it were anybody but Rockefeller, I’d
say let’s give him more; but fortunately, the
old gentleman lost his stomach chasing dol-
lars, and he can’t eat anything richer than
crackers, or drink anything stronger than
skimmed milk. A billion dollars, will buy
him a Rocky mountain range of crackers
and an ocean of skimmed milk. All the
Rockies of the future, never will be able to
eat all the crackers, or drink all the skim-
med milk that the billion dollars will buy,
and there will be a little money left over for

. monkey dinners, dog parties, cat weddings,

butterﬂy balls and diamond dog collars, and
all such other necessities of life as our rich
folks must have nowadays.

AS TO THE MEANS OF TRANSPORTATION

The transportation trust ought to be gr.-~--~, ‘.

taken over by the people also. The railroads
carry the products of the ﬁeld from the
farm to the city, and the products of the
factory from the city to the country. Now,
let us suppose there is a river. On one side
of the river are all the people who make
foodstuffs and raw material. On the other
side are the people who make shoes, cloth_—
ing, furniture, books and cottage organs.
The people on one side of the river, who
make. clothing and furniture, cannot live
without food, and those on the other side of

the river, who raise food, cannot-live With- ’ T

to them, and some of these gentlemen, so-

b tors, etc., may thank their Lord if they. es- ‘

But, should we decide not to restore to
the people what justly belongs to them,
without paying an indemnity to the present
owners, he may buy them. In this manner
the German government acquired the pri- 
vately owned railroads of that country. Be- . .4
-tween 1873 and 1878 the government issued 7'
bonds and used the proﬁts of the roads to '.
retire the bonds. 3

Commerce Commission reports that “with
the exception-of one small issue of C. B. &
Q. bonds which matured and were paid off
‘in 1922, there seems to be no record of any
railroad bonds ever having been retired.”
In 1898 the Swiss government started to I
nationalize the railroad_s,._. It bought the g
controlling interest in some of the leading 
lines, levied a heavy inheritance tax on ‘
'. _ _ large fortunes, and in this manner conﬁs-
cated the property of the dead capitalists in ‘F
order to pay the live ones. This is a very “
sensible method, inasmuch as dead capital-
istsnever kick, no matter how hard we pull
their leg. Millionaires die all the time but
: the government has many years to live. It
« may act in the capacity of the smiling heir. ’

A The next question then is: How would

them? Well, what’s the »matter with Uncle
Sam? Hasn’t’he been working at this job

for many years? Every time the capitalist»
runs a railroad into the ground, they appeal.
to the government to have a receiver ap..
pointed. Thislfunctionary is nothing but a ' - 3
manager, responsible to the courts. If ' 
Uncle Sam can run bankrupt railroads and "1!
place them on a paying basis for a capital- ,
‘A J ist, he ought to have sense enough to run 1

railroads that pay already, for the people. =‘

To prove that private ownership is much . -
more efficient than public ownership, we’. 
3, have only to read the records of 700 rail-»
road failures in the past 30 years, all of .
3- which the government took over and man- , -‘I
f aged until they became proﬁtable and then
T handed back to their owners.

The trouble is that the government be-
longs to the railroads and is bound to work »
, for them. Some day when the people cap- 1
4 ture the government, the same institution
‘ can be used inthe interest of the masses. V

There are still other people who main- V
9 tain that if the government owned the rail- »
roads, politics would creep in. The two mil-
lion railroad employes would use their polit- -
ical power to elect men to represent their “
interest, and this would lead to the sorry I
predicament of the railroaders running the
railroads. /

What a fearful calamity! Just imagine, 2
gentle reader, the railroaders would run the -
railroads! ‘ »

There are a great many people who
claim that therailroads are run by their
owners. This is not the case. We have eight
hundred thousand stockholders and bond-
holders, who claim to be part owners of our
railroad systems. The stockholder’s share in
the management and ‘operations consists in

SEPARA’l‘ION BETWEEN OWNERSHIP AND
LABOR

In the railroad industry, the separation
between ownership and labor is perfect.
Those who own the roads do not run them
and those who run the roads do not own
them. The operating personnel, from the
managers, superintendents, traffic and pas-
senger agents, accountants, civil engineers,
locomotive engineers, ﬁremen, switchmen,
clear down to the cheapest section hand,
are all hired hands. They hold no owner-
ship in the properties which they operate.
It is immaterial to them whether they work
for Uncle Sam or the Princess de Sagan.

The Socialists do not ask to change the
operating force, but 'to change the owner-
ship, so that the dividends may go to the
people who run and use the roads, instead
of the innocent bystanders at Monte Carlo.

Since the owners perform no useful func- '

tion whatsoever, they can be dispensed with.
They are nothing but pure and unadulter-
ated parasites, and about as useful to man-
kind as fleas are useful to a dog.

FRIENDSHIP OF FLEAS FOR DOGS, EAND
VICE VERSA

Did you ever see a dog without fleas?
If you did, you saw a happy, cheerful dog;
a dog that lies in the shade of the old apple
tree, dreaming of pork chops, jack rabbits
and dog ﬁghts. Now, if we give this con-
tented dog a handful of fleas, his dog na-
ture will change immediately. Instead of
dreaming about juicy pork chops,‘ or how he
would lick that brindle pup across the pike,
or what he woulddo to the hind legs of that
rabbit running. through the underbrush, he

Socialism
What It Is and How to Get It

I THE PARABLE OF THE HUNTER

Once upon a time there lived in the Land
of Stars and Stripes, a mighty hunter,,by
the name of Eagle-eye. This man could hit
the left hind leg of a ﬂying mosquito four
hundred yards off. But, alas, he had no gun.
Whereupon h_e hiked himself to,“Old Man”
Bateye, who was blind and lame, but who
owned many guns. And Eagle-eye spake
unto Bat-eye thus: “Lord! I am a hunter
without a gun; wherefore the wife of my
bosom iscleansing the soiled garments of
your wife, and my children cry papers in

‘the Wilderness of Chicago, while my stom-

ach is empty as the House of [the Lord in
summer time. Therefore, I beseech thee, let
me have one of your guns that I may follow

- my vocation, which is that of a hunter of

quails; so that’I, too, may eat, drink and be
merry.”

Then up spake Bateye and said: “Glad-
1y Will I lend you a gun, for I, too, crave hot
birds, cold bottles and warm babies, but for
the use of my capital (as guns are called
in the lingo of the chosen few) thou must
give unto me four quails out of every ﬁve
you shoot.” 3 '

This-looked fair and reasonable to the
hunter, for he was sorely pressed and up
a stump, from which he could not descend.
Therefore he accepted the terms of Bateye

* 3

L‘

sits‘up:and notices things. Pointing a cold,
melancholy nose toward h e a v e n, he
stretches his neck and starts that peculiar

‘_up and down stroke characteristic of all
flea-bitten dogs. He has found a job now;

he has found useful employment; he has

something to scratch for. Now, suppose the _

flea /would sit up on the nose" of that dog
and say: “Lo and behold me, the benefac-
tor... I have given work to this poor pup.
Without me that doggie would have no job.
Without me he would have no incentive to
scratch.” Wouldn’t it be funny if the flea

' would make such an argument? And sup-

pose the dog would vote for the flea on the

strength of it, Wouldn’t that be still fun-

nier? Yet this is exactly what the Working

people have done for many, many years.
TYPICAL ARGUMENTS

There are lots of people who still insist
that we cannot do without the capitalist. I
have seen many a poor devil, who was a
workingman from his eyebrows down, and a
capitalist from his syebrows up, standing
on a street corner, and, by vigorously work-
ing his jaw, produce the following noise:

“What would the poor people do without
the "rich folks? Supposing there wasn’t
some people to take the money that We poor
people make, and spend it, thereby giving us
work, how would we poor folks ever ﬁnd
something to do?” .,

Then there is another lantern-j awed,
slab-sided, hungry looking individual, usual-
lycalled a renter, and he says: “What
would people do without landlords? Don’t
the landlords furnish the land for the rent-

ers? Nowadays a poor devil what ain't got .

any land, can always go to the landlord and
30

 

' ‘:5;--°-—--' *'~-*=M;r’‘‘ ‘ .

 

 

get: some. Under Socialism, when no man
can hold eland who doesn’t Work land, fro
whom would the renter rent land?” -

Anybody with a grain of sense, ‘knovvs At

that the landlord furnishes the land. If the

landlord had never been born, there "

wouldn’t be any land, and if the landlord
dies and goes to heaven," he takes the land

down With him, and Where that nice farm »

used to be, there is a big square hole in the

ground, through which you can see the sun C

rise.
. CONCLUSION

To rid the body politic of the useless
parasite, and to relieve the Working class of
the bloocl-suckers and exploiters, is the main
aim of the great Socialist movement. We
have social production and co—operative la-
bor in all our great industries. Without the
brains and the muscles of the Workers, all
the wheels would stop. The stockholder,
bondholder, the silent partner and the
sleeping partner, furnish the capital, but We
have learned that this function of providing
the capital can be assumed very readily by
society. It takes equipment to run the post

department, but it does not require the capi-

talist to take a rake-off. It takes equipment
to run the school system, but no capitalist is
needed to make dividends out of our educa-
tional institutions. It takes equipment to
build roads and bridges, but we have dis-
pensed with the capitalist who formerly col-
lected the toll. If Uncle Sam can carry
mail, there is no reason Why he shouldn’t
carry male and female also. Many cities
furnish Water to their citizens, others sup-
ply them with gas, electricity and trans-
portation. A number of European munici-

_ _ But municipal and state ownership_ is
not Socialism». State owned railroads and
state monopolies are even today used as a
means to exploit the working people for the
beneﬁt of the capitalist taxpayers. In order

to give to the masses the full beneﬁt of so __
.. cial ownership, it is necessary that the state  " ~

, and fetched to him four quails out of every

ﬁve, but the ﬁfth one he ate himself.

This lone bird ﬁlled but a small part of
his inners and he was hungrymost -of the
time, and then Bateye would slap himvon
the back and say: “I’d give a million quails
to have your appetite!” But he never did.

Sometimes when he was weary, wet and
Worried, Eag1e—eye would bemoan his lot
and curse fate for having been born. At
such times Holyman, the soothsayer, who
ate at the table of Bateye, would come to
him with incantations and promises of man-
sions on the other side of the silver lining.
He also spake much of golden harps.

Eagle-eye thought these things were
good to eat and was made happy again.

Thus he Worked for many years, until

i his eyes became too dull and his legs too

Wabbly to shoot birds. But his appetite

. Was as good as ever, when Bateye gave the

gun to a younger hunter with clear eyes and
steady legs. Thereupon Eagle-eye, who had
eaten less every year as he grew older, quit
eating altogether and gave up his ghost.

Holyman preached the funeral sermon
and spake much of Providence, dust and
being called home to the mansion above the
clouds; whereupon a crazy man laughed
and said: “If Eagle—eye had a gun of his
own he could have kept all the birds he shot
and he would now be still among the living.”
But all the people called this man loony and
scoﬁed him, and laughed him to scorn and
said he was a dreamer, for even a fool
knoweth that guns are made for some to
own and for others to "use.

land, are in the same predicament as is the
hunter without a gun. They cannot follow
their vocations unless they get the use of
capital or land belonging to theother fel-
ow. . »

The heart and soul of capitalism is the
separation of ownership and labor and the
resultant division of mankind in two classes,
one of which owns the means of life and

does not use them,‘ the other that uses the .

means of life and does not own them.

This arrangement allows a few people to
live without work and forces the many to
work without getting a living.

The aim of Socialism is to bring about.

a union between ownership and labor by
making the means of production the com-
mon property of all the people. ,

The principal means of life are con-

trolled by great aggregations of capital, ,
‘commonly called trusts. These giant com-

binations, by forcing the wages of labor
down to the very minimum of subsistence,
and by charging for their products all that
the traffic will bear, have become a serious
menace to the well-being of the American
people, and all kinds of remedies are ad-
vocated against the evils of monopoly.
REGULATION

A large portion of the Republican party
has declared itself in favor of trust regu-
lation. This, we are told, is to be accom-
plished through the federal government.
But even if we grant to the government the

right to interfere with the private business

of its citizens We seriously doubt its ability
to do so, for those who own the principal
wealth of a nation usually own the govern-
ment, too. If there is one thing surer than

5

 

 

. .—'2rvv."'-v A»-~-~._» ‘ -~ .' -7;» .—_~A —.-‘~—~~l.—'»—~-- '

death and taxes, it is that this beloved gov-
ernment of ours belongs hair and hide,
body and soul, to the trusts. .
We don’t expect our own bull-p_up to
bite us in the hind leg, but we expect him
to bite the other fellow; and when thrifty

gentlemen like Rockefeller, Morgan and‘

Carnegie, spend their hard earned cash to
acquire a‘ government after their own
heart, this institution can not be utilized
against its rightful owners.

The fact is, we have two governments
in the United States, a little one with its
headquarters in Washington and a big one
with its headquarters in Wall Street and
its hindquarters all over the country. This
Wall Street government owns all the
mines, water power, forests, railroads, fac-
tories, colleges, banks and life insurance
companies.

It determines what kind of clothes we

Wear, what sort of houses we live in, what A

kind of grub we eat, whether our children
go to school or to the_factory and whether
little Mary plays piano or slings hash.

The little affair in Washington is only
the errand boy, or, at the most, the police-
man of the real thing in Wall Street. We
cannot control the master with his servant,
and a government belonging to the trusts
has neither the power nor the inclination to
regulate the trusts. All attempts in this
direction have been miserable failures.
That the advocates of regulation are still
taken seriously by some folks is a clear in-
dication that the American people have
lost their sense of humor.

pose that the trusts be busted, and they
advise us to return tocompetition and the
good old days of Jackson and Jefferson.
There is but one objection to this plan.
Somehow mankind has a habit of traveling
forward instead of backward, and when-
ever a people have followed such advice
and returned to the Ways of their fathers,
as- happened in the case of the Egyptians,
their posterity had to hire a German pro-
fessor to decipher the inscription on their
tombstone.

The trust, after all, is not an invention
of the devil, as some “statesmen” believe,
but the product of industrial evolution.
Competition may be the life of trade, but it
is also the mother of monopoly. In the
competitive struggle only the “ﬁt” survive.
The “ﬁt” in this case are those who‘ succeed
in getting the most value for the least ex-
penditure. This is usually accomplished
through‘ the reduction of wages, the em-.
ployment of children, adulteration, mis-
representation, state paternalism as exem-
pliﬁed in the high tariff policy, freight rate
manipulation, rebating, stock watering and
the installation of more and bigger ma-

The trust was born when Brown and

" Smith, competitors in the same territory,

got sick of hammering each other and
formed a partnership to hammer the dear
public. No one should blame them for try-
ing to make money. Soon Brown and
Smith came in competition with the ﬁrm
of Mueller and Jones, and knowing a few
things about the blessings of competition,

they merged the._two concerns intoa stock

company.

The Brown-Smith Mfg. Co. soon dis- -

covered that Harry Dick & Co. were selling
thesame goods in the same market for
less money. Consolidation followed as the
only means to protect proﬁts. Partner-
ships, stock companies, corporations, syn-
dicates, holding companies and trusts have
but one aim, the elimination of competi-
tion. Those who had sense enough to com-
bine survived; those who didn’t were left
behind! To go back to competition would
be as rational as sitting on an oak tree in
the hope of squeezing it back into the acorn.
or coaxing a rooster to return into the egg.

During a Democratic convention, pro-

v ceedings dragged along until Friday morn-

ing at three o’clock, when the time arrived
to nominate a candidate for president. As
everybody knows, Friday is an unlucky day.
Democracy should not jeopardize its bril-
liant prospects by nominating a candidate
on Friday. Whereupon the cunning gentle-
men turned the clock in the convention hall
from Friday morning 'at 3 o’clock back to
Thursday night at 11 o’clock. But while
the Democratic Party may be able to turn
back the hands of a helpless clock, it is
unable to turn back the wheels of progress.
SOCIAL OWNERSHIP

Trust control having failed, returning
to competition and to the happy days of
Jackson and Jeﬁerson being an impossi-
bility, what other solution is there, then,
for the trust question? Socialists say, the
trust is a good thing and a bad thing. It is
a good thing for all the fellows on the in-

side and a bad thing for all the people on

the outside. If we should ask Rockefeller
what he thinks of the trust, he would tell

* us candidly that it is the best money mak-

ing machine he ever tumbled into, but the
people who buy the products of that money
making machine, hold an entirely differ-
ent opinion.

A trust is like an automobile. To chase
down the pike and to see some old farmer
climb a barbed wire fence behind a pair of
runaway mules, is very funny to the fellow

on the inside of the automobile. Giving the »

people the dust of the road and the stink
of the gasoline. is highly amusing to the
fellow on the inside of the automobile.
Chasing through the streets of a city at six-
ty miles an hour, blowing the honk, honk,

which means for us to jump, jump, is the '

funniest thing that ever happened——to the
fellow on the inside of the automobile.

\ But the old gentleman who climbed the
barbed wire fence behind a pair of bob-
tailed mules; the people who swallowed

-the dust of the road and inhaled the stink

of the gasoline, and all those who do _not
jump, jump, when they hear the honk,
honk, join in one grand and glorious
chorus, saying: “Damn the automobile.
The machine should be busted. Those peo-
ple ought to be sent to the penitentiary.
Why don’t you shoot them, Jim?” etc., etc.

The only way we ever_ become recon-
ciled to the automobile is by getting on the
inside of it. .And since We ﬁnd that all the
people on the inside of the trust, are ‘Well
pleased with the trust, the only remedy
and the only way we will ever become re-
conciled to the trust, is by all of us getting
on the inside of the trust. And that is the
