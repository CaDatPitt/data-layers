OFFICIA ORGAN INTERNATIONAL UNION of MINE. MILL and SMELTER WORKERS
Vol. XXIV. No. 3 '

 

   

VANADIUM, N. M.—-Defeating the United Selworkers of America in an NLRB
representation election on Feb. 5, Mine-Mill again gained bargaining rights for work-

ers at AS&R’s Ground Hog mine here and its mill in Deming——properties which are
‘renewing operations ‘after having been closed since 1957.

The vote was 60 for Mine-Mill to 40 for Steel, with three workers choosing “no”

union” and five votes being challenged. While only 112 employees were eligible to
vote, the work force at the two units will eventually reach about 230. The workers will
become members of Mine-Mill Local 890, the Amalgamated Bayard (N.M.) District
Union.

The election victory climaxed a vigorous organizational campaign started in De-
cember under the leadership of District 2 Board Member Maclovio R. Barraza, Pres-

ident A. C. Skinner, and Secretary-Treasurer Irving Dichter. International Represen-

tative Alfred C. Montoya was assigned responsibility for the campaign, assisted by
International Representative J a- '
cob Mercado, Local 890 Presi-
dent S. Q. Merino, Lo-cal 509
President Rodolfo Garcia, and
Arthur Flores of Local 890.

Although the Ground Hog and
Deming mill workers always in
the past had been represented
by Lo~cal’890, American Smelt-
ing and Refining abruptly an-
nounced in December that it
would not go aheadwith nego-
tiations for the reopened prop-
erties, thus necessitating the
election. In the meantime, the
company had been hiring work-
ers-—very few of them former
employees at the mine and mill.
In addition, the Steelworkers
had entered the picture.

Commi-I-tees Elected

Within two weeks after the
start of the Mine-Mill campaign,
however, 80 percent of the work-
ers in the mine had signedup
with the union. An organization- ‘
al mine committee was elected,
as well as a contract prepara-
tion committee.

Regular meetings of the work-

Mill’s AS&R Council which
broke through last summer with
a security-severance package as
part of its 37-cents-an-hour
three-year contract settlement
with the company, which set
the industry pattern for the ex-

ers were well attended through-
out the campaign, and Mine-Mill
leaflet distributions were highly
successful. Another important
factor was the support given by
the union’s Kennecott, Empire
Zinc, and Peru workers, who on
three occasions joined the AS&R
workers as they came off shift.
This demonstration of support
provided evidence to the AS&R
employees that they would have
powerful support in the district.
Steel’s Red-baiting atta cks
and standard pitch that Mine-
Mill is a “weak” union failed

THE POWERFUL DEMONSTRATION OF SUPPORT for Mine-Mill from Kennecott, Empire
Zinc, and Peru Workers in the‘ Vanadium, N.M. area was considered an important
factor in the outcome of the Ground Hog election. Here is a group of Workers at the
AS&R property, Mine-Mill staff members, and local union officers campaigning on Feb.
4,. the day before the election. Pointing to the Sign is’S. Q. (Chano) Merino, presi-
dent of Local 890, the Amalgamated Bayard District Union, of which the Ground Hog
Workers will become members. ‘ o

     

About 40 men were trapped in
the tunnel for several hours

after the 10:16 a.m. slide, being V

reached late in the day by
rescue workers digging with
hand shovels because their
power tools had been buried.
Seventeen men in the tunnel
were injured.

I20 Rescued

About 120 miners, construction 1

workers, and camp personnel
have been ﬂown out of the area
by helicopter. Those dead or
still. missing were generally
men caught in or about the bunk
houses when the avalanche hit.
“No buildings-—everything was
just chunks of wood, steel, and

tin,” said Gus Ritchie, of the ,

scene encountered by the men

who were able to grope their

way out of the tunnel.
The mine, which was slated
to go into production in 1967, is

' expected to produce some 44,000

tons of copper in concentrates
per year, which will go to the
AS&R smelter in Tacoma,

WASHINGTON, D. C.—Senators Lee Metcalf (D-Mont.), Frank,M0ss (D-Utah), A
and Joseph Montoya (D—N.M.) reintroduced in the U. S. Senate on Feb. 4 their bill of
last session which would establish a mine saftety inspection and enforcement program

 

under the direction of the U. S. Bureau of Mines.

During the past month, a similar bill in the House, introduced in January by
(D-Mont.) and David King (D-Utah), gained support, as Reps.
E. S. (Johnny) Walker (D—N.M.) added their names
Rep. Morris Udall (D-Ariz.), addressing the Mine-

Bureau ofthe Budget to? have it
introduced in Congress in the
near future. When_ this is done,
the way will be cleared for com-

With the’ introduction of Met-_

joint statement from Mine-Mill,
the United Mine Workers of

- America, and the United Steel-

workers of America in Utah was
issued, ' calling upon the entire
Congressional delegation from
that state to support the pro-
posal. The statement, which
also was distributedto‘ all mem-
bers of the Utah state legisla-
ture, asked Gov. Calvin L.
Rampton to assist in speeding
the scheduling of Congressional
hearings. i

In stating that their unions’
support for a federal mine safe-
ty program “stems fromrthe
breakdownof state mine safety
inspection and enforcement,”
the representatives of the three
unions pointed out that 68 out
of 69 metal and mineral mines

While the bill will undoubtedly be studied by. a subcom- ;.

The statement, which ‘was 1

highly critical of Miles P. Rom-

to any federal legislation in this

area, expressed confidence that c

the legislation would be enact-
ed. District 3 Board Member

, VerneCurtis, Intern_ational Rep-

resentative G. L. Buckner, and
"Orlando Lawson, political action
committee chairman for Local

ment for Mine-Mill.

Signing for the Steelworkers
were Kenneth McTavish, sub-

and M. E. Saathoff, legislative
education committee chairman.
Frank M. Stevenson, president
of UMW Local 22, and Arthur

- Biggs and Frank J. Sacco, both

international, board members,
represented the United Mine
Workers in the statement.

Early this month, a resolution
on the matter will be introduced
in the Utah House of Represent-
atives and Senate, which would
memorialize Congress to consid-
er and enact SB 996 and HR
2993 (the Metcalf-Montoya bill).
Gov. Rampton has indicated that
_he will concur with the resolu-
tion if passed, and, in fact, will
urge the Democratic members
of the legislature to approve the
measure. _

Bruce S. Jenkins, president
of the Utah Senate, wrote to the
union, saying that the matter
would be given serious consid-
eration in the Senate.

pany last month. ’ ‘ .
-Saying that the union is willing at any time to sit
down with the company to work out problems of safety,
the leaflet points out that several union recommendations

  
  

made in past meetings have not been carried out.
Following the death of Merritt T. Paice on Dec. 28,
who was killed when his truck went over the edge of an

unlit waste dump at the open
pit mine at Ruth, union officials
made several suggestions to
Kennecott in order to prevent

future accidents of that nature. A

The recommendations were:

0 Lighting of all dumps in use.

I A dump man or spotter at
all sites where dumping was
going on.

0 Repair of any truck which
had been turned in as a bad
order.

C Safety belts for the trucks.

0 Correction of the present situ-
ation which makes it impos-
sible to brake or steer most
of the trucks when the hoist
is being used.

None of these suggestions have
been put into effect. Instead,

-on Jan. 18, the company sent
.out a letter to all Nevada em-
ployees, over the signature of
7W. H. Winn, general manager

of the Nevada Mines Division,
which implied that safety was
primarily the responsibility of

the individual worker.

Alertness Appeal _
“The appeal for this alertness

. on the part of every employee is

the purpose of this letter,” wrote
Winn, who mentioned, in pass-
ing, that “Company manage-
ment recognizes that a safe
working atmosphere is one of
the prime" requirements of any

good operation.”

Called an “Open Letter to
W. H. Winn," the union leaﬂet
charged the company with being
more interested in production
than with the safety of its em-
ployees, saying that other com-
panies accept the responsibility
for maintaining" safety.

In investigating the accident
which killed Paice, a member
of .Mine-Mill Local 124, the U.S.
Bureau of Mines said it was
caused by “inadequate means
of preventing trucks traveling
beyond a safe place for dump-
ing.” The Bureau made three

specific recommendations to the
company.

The report by the Nevada
State Inspector of Mines did not
pinpoint the cause of the acci-
dent, nor did it contain any
recommendations aimed at pre-
venting similar accidents in the
future.

“Lack of alertness and poor
judgement were the primary
factors in two haulage truck ac-
cidents, one of them tragically

fatal,” Winn said in his letter to

the Nevada workers.

Nebraska Election Law
To See Increased Use

OMAHA, Neb.—Ray C. Skow, the manager of the American
Smelting and Refining Company’s plant here, may well be sorry
next‘ year that Richard Schill, ‘newly-elected president of Mine-Mill
Local 461, w,asn’t promptly paid for the two hours that he took off

on Nov. 4 in order to vote.

State law in Nebraska provides that, if a worker does not have
three consecutive hours of free time between the opening and clos-
ing of the polls on Election Day, he can take two hours off from
work-—with pay. The majority of states have similar laws.

Schill, not then president of the local- union, exercised this option »

on Nov. 4, 1964. A block worker for the Democratic party during the
campaign, he planned to use his time before and after work that

day knocking‘ on doors and ‘en-
couraging others to get out and
vote. V

Prior to Election Day, he in-
formed his foreman that he was
going to take the two hours.
Arriving at work at 8 a.m. on
Nov. 4, he was given from 8:30
to 10:30 a.m. to vote . . . and
vote he did. —

38 Hours Pay

The hitch came with the pay-
check for the week, which was
two hours short. .

Plant ' Manager Skow [argued
that the company would not pay

for time during which Schill was

campaigning, claiming that he
had time to vote after work. “I
was voting, not campaigning
during my two hours off,” Schill
shotback, quoting thelaw to
back himself up.

Well, it took more than Schill’s

word to the boss to get the two

hours pay. It took rulings from

the local election commission
and from the county ,attorney’s
office before an additional check
for $5.25 was made out.

So far as he knows, Schill
says, only he and Eugene Fen-
derson, the local’s political ac-
tion committee chairman, took
the two hours off from the plant
in November, 1964.

Since then, Schill has been
elected president-of the Omaha
Smeltcrmen’s Union and Fen-
derson has moved up to chief
steward. Both are betting that in
future elections far more work-
ers will take the two hours.

If they don’t, Schill vows, it
won’t be because provsions of
the law weren’t explained to
them.

BRITANNIA BEACH, B.C.——A further attempt by the Anacon-
da Company. to evict Mine-Mill Local 663 from‘ the headquarters
it has maintained since 1944 was thrown out of court in February,
as the seven-month-old strike against the company continues.

Judge H. Swencisky of the Vancouver County Court handed A

down the decision, ruling thatpinsufficient evidence was produced
to establish any case for eviction. - ‘

Aimed at denying the striking’ local quarters in the strike area, S

the eviction attempt is another indication that Anaconda. would

dearly like to be operating the mine—the oldest copper producer

in the country. While the company for months has been saying

’- that it closed the mine, which it describes. as a marginally profit- ‘

able operation, the fact is thatonly the Local 663» strikers are keep-
ing the mine down. . -

The following contributions toward the Britannia strike (through. * A

While conference leaders were unanimous in calling it a success, representatives of some groups felt that
the meeting did not get specific enough or that the poverty-stricken themselves had too little opportunity to pre ent
their problems. '

“They gave fo-ur members of the NAACP 10 minutes to talk,” said Rev. George Brooks

ing, “They couldn’t even get started.”

Hopi, Navajo, and Yaqui In- :““‘“”*“" ‘‘‘‘ "   " ”  ‘ T "

inadequately represented at the
conference and that too few
members -of the Caucasian com-
munity attended.

who was the first Negro to
crack the color barrier in the

maintaining that the program
will not work “unless the people
concerned become deeply in-

_‘Mrs. Barbara Norton, a
Scottsdale social worker, testi-
fied that the Arizona Welfare
Board wastes time and money
“in an effort to ferret out wel-
fare chiselers—and they have
found very few of them”—-
charges which were later denied
by State Welfare Commissioner
John 0. Graham. ,

The state’s welfare regula-
tions, Mrs. Norton also charged,
are “designed to punish and in-
timidate and to deprive its
citizens of human dignity.”

In the closing hours of the
conference, Father Vizzard
called for a ‘Congressional in-
vestigation of state employment
commissions in California, Ari-
zona, and Texas, saying that, in
farm labor placement, the agen-
cies “have long been a tool of
the employer and in most cases
could in no way be ‘called a
friend of the working man.”

Shriver, who also heads the
Peace Corps, said that “The
problems of poverty are not
going to be solved by tourists,
professional or amateur, who
work an eight-hour day and then
retire to the suburbs.”

“We have,” said Vice-Presi-
dent Humphrey in his address
to the conference, “at long last
begun to challenge the eco-
nomic and social injustices we
had often permitted to go un-
recognized and unrelieved.”

Some 700 delegates had been

expected to attend the two-day
meeting. About 2,200 registered.

‘Arizona M-M Council Drafts,

Pushes Legislative Program

 ‘PHOENIX, Ariz.—The Arizona Mine—Mill Council, which adopted its legislative

program for 1965 and elected officers at a meeting here on Jan. 21, has been urging
;itslocal unions and ladies auxiliaries to prepare to testify before legislative commit-
tees and to launch letter-writing campaigns on behalf of the several important labor
bills that have been introduced this session.

Of particular interest to Mine-Mill is a bill introduced by Rep. Fred Smith of Pinal
County wliichwould extend the jurisdiction of the State Mine Inspector to cover mills
and smelters. Reported out of the House Labor Committee, the proposal went to the
committees on state government, banking, and judiciary. A similar bill is in the Senate

hopper. Another bill, introduced
in both houses, calls for a mine
safety code study by a three-
man committee——one represen-
tative froin labor, one from the
industry, and one from the gen-

eral public. The Senate Mining"

Committee has proposed to’ hold
its own hearings on revisions in
the present code.

 -Although Democrats gained
, the governorship in November,
3 with Sam Goddard’s win over

Richard Kleindienst, the House
of Representatives has again
been organized by a coalition
of Democrats and Republicans.
Rep. A. J. (Jack) Gilbert (D-
I Cochise) won the speakership
1- with the aid ofthe 35 GOP votes,
despite the fact that Democrats
hold numerical control.
 Mine-Mill Council officers, who
met with Gov. Goddard while
:? they were in Phoenix on Feb. 2

" and ,3 to work on the union’s A

legislative program, indicated
, that the governor saw the,_House

as‘ a possible major stumbling
block to his program.

iv .. .  Other Bills
 Council-backed bills to im-
“prove the occupational disease
and disability laws have been
introduced in both chambers,
,whi1e bills calling for a mini-
mum wage of $1.25 per hour and
for the establishment of a com-
mission on human relations are
now in the House. A civil rights
proposal modeled on the federal
act passed last year has been
introduced in the Senate by Sen.
Sol Ahee (D—Pima).
Also in the Senate hopper is
S.B. 43, which would limit the
amount of a worker’s wages
that are subject to garnishment.

 S3lrStabIeii[anid Peaceful World

   Music biirhhiet deal

by Irving Dichter
International Secretary-Treasurer

N THE GRAND DESIGN for the “Great Society,” there is a

missing page. While we move ahead on a program to grapple
with a variety of domestic problems, we lack a design for interna-
tional stability and peace. We hold our breath with every new de-
/velopment in Viet Nam. We watch the United Nations and pray for
its continued existence. Everyone of us realizes -that a nuclearwar
means the end of all civilization. '

True, a grand design for peace is not as simple to evolve as
medicare. We live in a changing, turbulent world. And every change
and new development seems to throw shadows which threaten and
frighten a section of our country. But we
are a strong country and at present with a
strongleadership with a mandate from the
people to move ahead—-to move ahead to
eliminate poverty and discrimination in our
country and to contribute towards a stable
design for the world as a whole.

Of course the responsibility is not ours
alone. The Soviet Union, China, and West-
ern Europe share in that responsibility. But
we must chart our course towards interna-
tional peace and stability. Walter Lipp-
mann, one -of the most astute observers of
the international scene, in arecent column
saidin effect “the time is now.” '

E TRADE UNIONISTS have a contribution to make towards
, a stable and peaceful world. We cannot confine our activities
only to the day-by-day problems which affect our membership.
Without a stable international peace, all of our efforts will be found
wanting. --

We take pride in the fact that on domestic issues we stand on
the side of progress. Why shouldn’t we do the same on matters of
-foreign policy? John Kenneth Galbraith, former ambassador to
India and an intimate associate of the late President Kennedy, in
an articlein the February issue of The Atlantic Monthly perhaps
points a finger atthe trade union movement, when hestates:

“There is no reason why our foreign, policy should be the natu-
ral stronghold of conservatism or contentment. And in foreign policy
as well as in domestic policy, there cannot be progress without
controversy. There is now great-need for bringing our foreign
policy abreast of the times, and even more for bringing it abreast
of simple necessity, and, of what accordingly, we end up doing . . .
I also venture to think the American people are in a mood for
change.” ,

NIXON, N.J.—John Valeri of
Highland Park, who reached age
65 on Jan. 29, is one of the first
workers to retire since the con-
tract agreement between the
Nixon Plastic Workers Union,
Mine-Mill Local 679 and Nixon-
Baldwin Chemicals, Inc. became

. effective on Oct. 1.

He has received a severance

pay check for $2,160 —— $80 for

each of his 27 years of service-
as provided by the settlement.
In addition, he will get a month-
ly pension benefit of $60.75 ($2.25
per year of service), a‘ $1,500
paid-up life insurance policy,
and his pro-rated four weeks
vacation check. He is also, of
course, eligible to start»receiv-
ing Social Security benefits.‘

Valeri, who started work at
the Nixon Nitration Works, now
Nixon- Baldwin Chemicals, on
June 21, 1937, is planning a vaca-
tion trip to his home town in
Italy. He worked in the stuffing
department as a stuffing ma-
chine operator, coming to Nixon

from ‘the Newark plant of the

Celanese Corporation, where he
had performed a similar job. He
soon advanced to shift leader in
his department. '

A charter member of Local

679, Valeri was instrumental in.

organizing the union in 1941 in
the fight for improved wages. It
affiliated with Mine-Mill on Oct.
1 that year. A
For many years a shop stew-
ard in the stuffer department,
Valeri did not seek re-election
this year because of his pending

-retirement. He will long be re-

membered by fellow workers,
however, for his confidence and

‘calmness in handling grievances

as well as for his friendliness.

Mme Safety Drwe      
DENVER, Colo.—Preparations for four district conferenceslin

February and discussion of political action, with particular em-
phasis on the drive for mine safety -legislation, consumed thema-

jor portion of an international executive board meeting on Jan. 30, .

and 31.

The board agreed to encourage local unions not only to launch

letter-writing campaigns on the mine safety bill, but to set. up
meetings with their Congressmen during the Easter break. The
possibility of sending rank-and-file delegations to Washington, D.C.

' when committee hearings are set on the mine safety proposals was A

also discussed.

Mine-Mill Research Director Arthur Stuart outlined the history ‘, .
of the Federal Coal Mine Safety Act, pointing out several short,—  -

comings and maintaining that
the union must make a fight for
a stronger bill to cover metal
and mineral mines and associ-
ated smelters and refineries.
Title 1' of the Coal Mine Act
was passed by Congress in 1941,
giving the Bureau of Mines

authority to inspect mines and

issue reports, but no enforce-
ment powers to correct unsafe

conditions. Only after two par-

ticularly bad coal mine disas-
ters in 1951 was the act strength-
ened by the addition of Title 2
the following year. That section
gives the Bureau of Mines power
to evacuate amine and order
the correction of certain unsafe
conditions only—conditions, said
President Truman in signing
the bill, that had led to only
about 10 percent of the acci-
dents that had occurred over the
years.

Resolution on Brace:-as

The board also unanimously
passed a resolution reaffirming
“its opposition to the presently
expired bracero program and
underhanded attempts now , be-

ing made to revive it."

Saying that the low standards
created by the bracero program,

which causes an oversupply of

farm labor, has a depressing ef-

fect on the economy in areas
where Mine-Mill members lwﬁe

and work, the, board resolution, .
moved by Distrzict 1 Board Mem- _

her Barney Rash, urges local un-

ions to notify tl*z,eir Congressmen...‘

and Senator's, P7'csz'dem‘. .IolmV-
son, and the Labor Dcpcrrtmem;
of the ?Ln.ion"s position. ’ V

The board said that many
growers have refused to hire

domestically-r ec r u i t e d farm I

workers, refused to pay decent
wages, and have resorted to

“spurious claims of crop losses -

allegedly due to labor shortages
. . . in a gamble for reestablish-
ment of the bracero program.’-’

In other action, the executive
board approved a donation of

$100 for civil rights work in Sel,- I
ma, Ala.—the sceneof massive‘

arrests of Negroes attempting -to

register to vote. Also discussed ’

were finances, the Mine-Mill

  THE MINE-MILL UNION

Dist. 3 Talks argaining,

  31 Delegates Attend Three-Day Meet;
Represent 12 locals in Four States

SAN FRANCISCO, Calif.——Negotiating pension im-
provements, the building of a $1 million international
union strike fund, influencing legislative developments

‘on the national and state scenes—these were some of
the many questions with which delegates to the Mine-Mill
District 3 conference concerned themselves on Feb. 5,
6, and 7 at the Olympic Hotel.

Thirty-one delegates representing 12 local unions in
the district’s four states attended the meeting, chaired
by Board Member Verne Curtis.

The conference hammered-out and approved reso-
lutions supporting the mine safety and early retirement
bills now before Congress and urged support for a major
portion of the Johnson administration’s legislative pro-
gram.

After extensive discussion, the delegates approved,
in amended form, a resolution on the strike fund, sub-
mitted by four of the five Utah locals, calling for an

March. —  A 

   

 

increase in the per ‘capita tax
from $2.50 to $3.50 per member
per month. The resolution also
asks that strike relief from the
international strike fund be dis-
tributed equitably to any local
involved in a shutdown, regard-
less of the shape of the local’s
own strike fund. '

The international convention,
scheduled for Denver, Colo. in
August, is‘ expected to deal
further with the question of the
strike fund. The District 3 reso-
lution is, of course, only a rec-
ommendation. Any increase in
dues requires not only conven-
tion action, but also a referen-
dum vote of the union’s entire
membership.

Joseph Dispenza, president of
Local 485 in Bingham, Utah,
headed a nine-man committee
which amended the original
resolution, as presented by Lo-
cals 55 in Tooele, 392 in Magna,
485, and 692 in Salt Lake City.

Pension Goals

Paul Pinsky, the union’s in-
surance consultant, reported on
health and welfare gains made
by Mine-Mill in the recent round
of negotiations and on recent de-
velopments in pension negotia-
tions in -other industries. The
Mine-Mill pension agreements
with the major companies in
nonferrous metals will be open
in 1967, except for American
Smclting and Refining, where
the pension contract expires
nextyear on July 1.

The goals in these negotia-
tions, said Pinsky, should in-
clude a reduction in the normal
pension age, continued pension

benefits for widows in the event.

of the death of a retired worker,
and contract provisions so that a
worker’s pension will be based
on total service in the industry,

Reports were also given by
International President A. C.
Skinner; Arthur Stuart, Mine-
Mil1’s research director; Nathan

Witt pointed out that close to
40 percent of the union’s’ mem-
bership is located in “right-to-
work” states, in stressing the
importance of Congressional. ac-
tion to repeal Section .14(b) of
the Taft-Hartley Act, originally
passed in 1947. Two of the four
states represented at the con-
ference——Utah and Nevada,-are
“right-to-work” states," although
there is a bill calling for repeal
in the Utah state legislature.

Noting that oral arguments
were heard by the 10th‘ Circuit
U.S. Court of Appeals in Janu-
ary, Witt expressed “great con-

THE MINE-M||.’l. UNION

 

5 I Aﬂend District 

TUCSON, Ariz.-—S-ome 65 delegates from 14 Mine-Mill locals in Texas, Arizona,
and New Mexico attended a District 2 conference at the Hiway House here on Feb.
12, 13, and 14, hearing reports on the progress made by the union in 1964 and grap-
pling with problems Which confront the union in this and future years.

Cong. Morris Udall (D-Ariz.), a brother of Interior Secretary Stewart Udall, ad-
dressed the opening session of the conference on Friday, and said he was ready to

“go again” in sponsoring the Mine-Mill-backed Metcalf-Montoya mine safety bill. He

predicted action on the measure this year or next, pointing out that the House Rules
Committee, so often in the past the graveyard of progressive legislation, is no longer
the stumbling block it was, as the result of procedural reform at the beginning of this

session of Congress.

On Saturday, Mrs. Graciela Olivarez of Phoenix, executive secretary of the Choate
'Foundation, which has been active in the_ Johnson adm1n1strat1on’s war on poverty

program, spoke to the delegates, urging increased union participation in the program

locally.» A key to the success
of the program, she said, was
the ‘active involvement of the
poverty-stricken in the planning
of various projects.

Union Support Pledged

International President A. C.
Skinner, who chaired the con-.
ference because of the serious
illness of District 2 Board Meni-
ber Maclovio R. Barraza,
pledged the union’s support,
calling the program “one with

‘courage which has the possi-

bility to do something about
some of the ugly things in
America.” Although the pro-
gram has only been appropri-
ated “meager amounts” so far,
he stated, “for the first time
the federal government’ has ac-
cepted the responsibility for
poverty in this country.”

In addition to approving an

eight-point program of legisla-

tive priorities on the national
level, the delegates unanimously
agreed to the need for increas-
ing the union’s operating fund.
and for building a $1 imillion
strike fund in the near future.

No concrete method of achiev-
ing those goals was discussed,
but the‘ subject is certain to
come up at the Mine-Mill inter-
national convention, scheduled
for August .in Denver, Colo.
Specific proposals will be de-
bated at that time, with ’ any
recommendation for a dues in-

SANTA FE, N. M.—-The New Mexico legislature early last
month. turned thumbs down on attempts to outlaw the union shop
through a “right-to-work” constitutional amendment. The Senate
defeated on Feb. 8 a “right-to-work” resolution, 18 to 14, with the-
House voting three days later, 51 to 21, to “postpone indefinitely”.

consideration of a similar bill.

Ellis Whitney of Roswell, a former ‘state legislator and head of
the “right-to-work” forces in the state, said he was “stunned’7 by
the Senate vote, and conceded that the issue was “dead” insofar
as.the present legislature is concerned. .

Thelegislature has repeatedly defeated anti-union shop bills
and the “right-to-work” proposal was rejected by the voters in a
1948 referendum. However, in 1963, the Senate passed a “right-to-

work” bill, and the state was
singled out this year as a major
target of “right-to-work” forces.
The 1963 bill was killed in the
Houseby a 36 to 27 margin.
Two Senators who had voted
to ban the union shop two years

ago switched positions on this

year’s vote. Also voting against
the proposal was a Senator who
had joined in co—sponsoring the
bill at the beginning of the ses-
sion.

The Senate’s four Republican
members and 10 Democrats
voted in favor of “right-to-work,”
with 18 Democrats opposing it.

Population Breakdown

In terms of population repre-
sented, the rejection of the mea-
sure was even more decisive.
Senators opposing the ban on the
union shop came from counties
with a total population of 636,-
000, while those supporting the
bill represent counties with
316,000 population. In New Mex-

. ico, each country, regardless of

its size, has one Senator in the
legislature. '

In November, Gov. Jack Mg»
Campbell, a Democrat -who‘: 0
pleged, to’ veto any ‘fright-to-1~

work” bill that might reach his

desk, trounced U.S. Sen. Edwin"
L. Mechem in the gubernatorial
race — winning by a margin
more than three times as great‘

as his majority in 1962. Mine-'

Mill Local 890 in Bayard active-
ly worked for Gov. Campbell,
at least partially because Sen,
Mechem had sponsored a “right-
to-work” bill when he was? a
member of the state legislature.

In order to avoid the threat-
ened gubernatorial veto, “right-
to-work” forces this year at-:
tempted to have the legislature
pass a measure calling for
another referendum vote on the
proposal. .

James G. Patton, president of
the National Farmers Union
and chairman of the National
Council for Industrial Peace,‘
whose New Mexico affiliate ac-
tively opposed the measure,
hailed the legislature’s action,
saying, “We have repealed the
law in Indiana and turned back
this effort in‘ the New Mexico
legislature. It is‘ time toget on

‘with ending theloophole in‘ fed’-
Ieral law which permits such

legislation in the states. I refer

‘to .section 14(b) of the .’l‘aft.-Ha,.rt-

ley Act.”  ~-

Qlhdha Local 0PPoses Bill
L ‘To Require"Strike Notice

OMAHA, Neb.—The political action committee of the Omaha
, Smeltermen’s Union, Local 461 is sponsoring a letter-writing drive ,
in opposition to a bill, introduced on Feb. 12 in the state’s unicam-
eral legislature, which would require labor unions to present a
written notice to employers 30 days in advance of any strike, slow-
down, or work stoppage. Eugene Fenderson, chairman of the com-
.mittee and chief shop steward at the AS&R property, said that a
prize will be awarded to the person writing the best letter against

the bill.

The proposal would provide a $500 fine for violators, plus treble
damages for.“any injury which results” from violation of the law.
It would also make it unlawful to elect officers of a labor organi-

zation or authorize a strike with-
out a secret ballot of union mem-
bers, with violators subject to
another $500 fine.

Fenderson, who hopes that the
bill can be killed in committee
and not reach the floor, called
the hill “just another example
of the anti-labor bills that the
labor movement has to fight
every year” in the “right-to-
work” state of Nebraska.

He also complained about the
unicameral form of the state
government, maintaining t h at

/ there was more of a chance for

alsniall, powerful clique gaining
excess power over the‘more im-
portant legislative committees
than would bethe case in a two-
house legislature.

Nebraska is the only state in
the [union with a single house
legislature, which was estab-
lished in 1937 in accordance with

a -5 c'onstitL1tional a m e n cl me n t .

adopted in 1934. It consists of a
body of 49 “Senators,” elected
on a non-partisan basis, repre-
sentinggeographic areas which
are roughly equal in terms -of
population. The lieutenant gov-
ernor, currently Philip C. Soren-
son, a Democrat, presides over
the chamber. ‘

The legislature meets bi—annu-
ally in the odd-numbered years.
There is no limit on the length
of the sessions, but no bill or
resolution may be introduced at
a regular session, after the first
20 days except at the request of
the governor, now Frank B.
Morrison, also a Democrat, or
of one of the committees.

New Savannah

Plant Organized
By Mine-Mill  

SAVANNAH, Ga.—-The Atlan-
tic Manufacturing Company, a
new operation that re c e ntly
moved to Savannah, was organ-
ized by Mine-Mill on Feb. 19 in
an NLRB election which result-
ed in 20 votes for the union
against 10 “no union” votes. One
ballot was spoiled and one was
challenged.

The new members will come
under the charter of Local 870,
the Savannah Fertilizer, Chemi-
cal, and Manufacturing Local,
which represents several prop-
erties in the area. The 10 work-
ers who voted against the‘ union
have already promised that they
will also join.

Expansion Probable

Although the company pres-
ently employs only 32 workers,
there is a great possibility of an
expansion of operations, one
reason being a large government
order to build houses received
by the company.

The organizing c a In p a i g n,
headed by International Repre-
sentative Jesse G. Doster, got
underway about three months
ago. It was slowed down brieﬂy
when the company discharged
two of the Mine-Mill leaders and
began a smear campaign after
first discovering the union ac-
tivity going on.

Although representatives of
two other unions attempted to
get cards signed, they did not
get enough to intervene. The
election, therefore, was a simple

' “yes-”- or “no” vote.

dent of Local 870.

When you pay $35 instead of $7-$13 fol‘ 8 Pail’ Of Slacks, YOVII
may get something for the extra money. But that something IS

in not necessarily durability——as was shown by tests on 23 models of

men’s dress slacks. Ratings of the models tested appear in the
March‘ issue of CONSUMER REPORTS.

‘ ' Factors of fashion and taste could not be tested. But in fabric
performance and in tailoring, only small variations were found,
despite the $6.98-$35 price range. None of the slacks was outstand-

, ingly good; none was really had. A low-priced pair, if you liked

it, could well be considered a Best Buy.

, ’ * This doesn’t mean, of course; that the hundreds of models of
slacks on the market are all equally well made. It pays to check

 some specific points when you buy—with special attention to mat-
 ters that have given you trouble in the past.

FIRST, THE FABRIC: Testers found that the wool-and-acrylic

blends were often somewhat stronger than the all-wool fabrics.

But the all-wools tended to be softer, more pliant and more ab-
sorbent.

Flannels shed wrinkles better than the plain weaves did.
Slacks with “permanent crease” held a crease better than non-

' treated slacks-

Certain details of tailoring add considerably to comfort and

9 wear: V

‘Front Closuriezi The hook and bar should be reinforced against

6 strain by means of an inside tab that buttons to the other side.

The zipper should be attached with two rows of stitching.

The seat seam is more durable if double stitched. This and
the other main seams should be pressed open and flat, andthe
edges‘ finished either with overcast stitching or tape. There should
be at least aninch available in the seat seam near the waistband,
to allow for letting out the slacks.

‘VWAISTBAND: The exposed left edge will wear better if made

. ‘of body material doubled back. Also, look for two layers of stiff
V mesh interlining.

Tacks——a number of stitches made over and over across a

L seam—he1p take up strain at crucial points. Look for tacks at both

ends of each pocket opening, at both ends of each -belt loop, at the

The crotch should not be pieced together. Instead, the leg

and seat-‘seams should meet to form a single cross-shaped inter-.

-section.
POCKET BOTTOMS should be double-seamed, and of twill

‘ rather than plain-weave material. The body fabric should extend

deep enough inside each pocket to hide the pocket fabric.

ll-lair Colors You Can Shompoo~Ou'|- '  

6 Temporary hair colorings-—-the ‘kind that wash out with one
shampoo-can’t change a dark shade to a lighter one, but the

‘D -good ones do well at restoring color to faded andivariegated hair,

and improving‘ hair sheen and manageability. They work best on

‘ hair that has not been bleached, dyed or permanent-waved. -

In its March issue CONSUMER REPORTS gives performance
ratings. of 49 colorings of nine nationally distributed brandszblack,
brown, blonde, auburn, silver, and platinum are included‘. The
eolorings were rated primarily for five factors: ease of applica-
tion, color strength, plausibility, resistance to rub-off, and. remov-
ability by» shampooing. Also considered’ were uniformity of cover-
age, “bleeding” when wet, ﬂaking, and fading.

Most brands did not rub "off, bleed, ﬂake, or fade. However,
there were important differences between brands in plausibility-
some were judgedto look more natural than. others.

Colors that came in powder form generally turned out to be

V ‘ easier to apply than most of the liquids. V V
Estimated cost per application ranged from 6c to 38c, but cost‘
1 was no indication of quality; the best tints in most of the six colors
/ tested were among the lowest in cost. Brand was not much of an

indication either, since some brands that were good in one color
turned out to be only fair in another.

. Don’t use any hair colorant without first making a patch test
to determine whether or not it will irritate your skin. Wash an

I area the size of a quarter, behind the ear or in the inner fold of

the elbow. Pat it dry. Prepare some of the tint as directed and
apply a few drops to the area. Let it dry, and leave it uncovered
and‘ unwashed for 24 hours. If there is any irritation or eruption,
don’t use the product.

Similarly, before attempting to tint the hair, do a test on a
..-mall strand to see if the result is satisfactory. -

 Fly;-Fishing Rods

A fly rod can be used for casting not only with flies but with a

I" wide variety of lures; it can even be used for fishing with natural
 bait like worms and minnows. What makes it a “fly rod” is that
3, the‘ user casts the line rather than the almost weightless bait or

lure.
I In its March issue, CONSUMER REPORTS carries ratings of

. 28 two’-piece rods of medium weight, 8 or 81/2 feet long, and costing
V from $4 to $28. The rods were tested primarily for casting per- .

Ml. Isa Strike
Coninues; Issue
Now Is Mackie

The strike at Australia’s big
Mt. Isa mine (53 percent owned
by American Smelting and Re-
fining Company) is still unset-
tled, despite the fact that the
Queensland Industrial Commis-
sion reversed an earlier ruling
-and ordered a pay increase
amounting to $6.75 pe-r week.

The major outstanding issue,
according to reports received in
Denver, is the status» of Pat
Mackie, leader of the Mt. Isa
strikers, who was fired by the
company on December 13.
Mackie is in disfavor with the
national leadership of the Aus-
tralia Workers Union and is
charged with leading a break-
away from that organization. At
a January meeting, members of
the Mt. Isa local voted to sup-
port him; however, the govern-

ment ordered him out of the-
district and he was not permit- ‘

ted to participate in negotiations
between Mt. Isa strikers, the na-
tional AWU, the company, and
mediators.

On February 17, the company
offered work to all men onits
payroll on December 14, thus
automatically excluding Mackie,
and the general president of the
‘national Australian W0 r k e r s
Union, Edward ,Williams, told
Mt. Isa employees to go back-
to work. “This is no longer a

genuine strike,” the American‘

Metal Market quotes him. Some
workers—one source says 119-
have accepted the offer to re-
turn to work, but reports indi-.
cate they are too few to operate
the mine. Then too, the Australi-
an Federated Engine Drivers
and Firemen’s Association has
instructed its 27 members, who
operate the hoists at the prop-
erty, not to return. .

Meanwhile, in the face of
mounting labor protests from
throughout the country, the gov-
-ernment lifted its ban on cer-
tain labor leaders being in the
district. Mackie immediately
called a press.conference.at a
Mt, Isa ‘hotel, saying he had
slipped back into town two days
earlier.

Mine-Mill Editor Heads 

Denver Young Democrats  

DENVER, Colo. -6 Richard L.
Miller, the managing editor of
the Mine-Mill Union, was elected
on Feb. 4'president-of the Young
Democrats of.Denver. He was

i unopposed for the office.

‘About 150 persons attended the

meeting, which featured a close
contest for the vice-presidency,
won by Barbara Rutherford, an
X-ray technician. Twelve mem-
bers of the club’s board of direc-
tors were elected from 17 candi-
dates. ‘
_ Last year, the Denver YD’s
generally supported a resolution
in support of the Metcalf-Mon-
toya bill, which was passed by
the Young Democrats at a na-
tional convention in 'Las Vegas,
Nev. ‘

Miller, 30, became active with r

the Denver organization soon
after moving to Colorado in late
1959—editing the club’s monthly

newspaper for two years and

serving several terms on the
board of directors. Last year, he

' was the chairman of the club’s

political action committee, while
in 1963 he and another Young
Democrat had directed the suc-
cessful mayoralty campaign of
Thomas Currigan in five of the
city’s then 35 election districts.
Stresses Recruitment

In his election night speech,

Miller said that the club should

concentrate on stimulating ac- -

tivity of its various committees
and on finding and educating
active people who might be en-
_couraged to run for precinct
committeepeople’s jobs around
the city in 1966. He hopes to re-
cruit new members from labor
organizations and from minority
groups.

While the club and its new
president have upon occasion
had squabbles with the Demo-
cratic party organization in Den-
ver on matters of policy, the
Young Democrats is conceded to
be a hard-working campaign or-
ganization which has also been
an effective force at the party’s

Local 365 Looks Backward  

(B t O Iy for One Night)
. by Alfred Petit-Clair. District 5 Board Member A

PERTH AMBOY, N. J .—The installing of the new officers of Local 365 was
proceeding in a routine way until someone recalled that President John Infusino was
entering his ninth year as president, and that only one other person had served that
long in that position in the history of the local union. Coincidentally, that man, the
first president of the local union, was presentat the installation meeting as a retiree.

Louis Sandry was the leader of the union in its early days and continues to
come to meetings faithfully. This combination of events at the meeting, plus the pres-
ence of David Mandel, the local’s attorney since it received its charter, led to a dis-
cussion of the past. An important part of labor history unfolded.

According to Brother Sandry, the organizing of the workers began with the
NRA and the Roosevelt administration’s granting of the right to representation. For a
few years prior to 1937, the men were represented by the type of organization which
was called “departmental representation.” Even then, the men’s militancy was ap-
parent.’ They staged a sit-down to win a wage increase in 1937. According to Brother

Sandry, management had indi-
cated they would grant a 10-cent

raise and then reneged. The 10-

cent raise was won as a result
of this action.

The Organizing Drive

The men, however, realized
that legitimate representation
was needed and contacted the
late Jess Gonzales who assisted
them in organizing into Mine-
Mill. At that time, according to
Sandry, only one ' other Mine-

"Mill local existed in the East

and that was a zinc_ plant in
Pennsylvania.

The actual organizing in the
plant began in April 1937. The
men signed rapidly and the
charter was received toward the
end of the same year. Sandry
was the first president. He held
the presidency for some part of
each of the next nine years. He
often stepped down to vice-presi-
dent .or some other office to en-
courage new leadership or be-
cause of the need for him to as-
sist in organizing at other non-
ferrous properties.

“We sent committees out to
northern New Jersey and Con-
necticut,” said Brother Sandry,
stating that “Local 365 members
assisted in the sweep of Mine-
Mill that was developing in the
nonferrous industry in the East.”
But all was not easy. In 1937 the
local struck for recognition.
Then, in 1938, the union had to
battle a company-union element
called “Asarco.” In 1938 and
1939 the union was fighting for
its life. Only a vigorous educa-
tional program conducted by the
local and the militancy of the
Mine-Mill followers saved the
umon.

Community Support
In 1938 another strike had
taken pla'ce_——this one for a con‘-
'tract and conditions. Community

port in those early days,”
Sandry remembers.

World War II, the need for
industrial peace, and the in-
crease in labor’s strength-na-
tionally established the union
firmly. But while it brought
stability, other weaknesses de-
veloped, such as a false sense
of security and the lack of or-
ganizing zeal, However, even
during the no-strike period, this
local union had its labor dis-
putes and did not hesitate to
shut down when it was neces-
sary.

Sandry was last active in
leadership in 1946. It might be of
interest to our members in
Mine-Mill to, know that’ Louis
Sandry was one of the young-
sters present at Ludlow, Colo-
rado atthe massacre by com-
pany agents and later was at
Cabin Creek, West Virginia dur-
ing its historic coal strike.

Post-War Period

Since World War II the union
has continued to go forward "-
still loyal to its tradition of hon-
est trade unionism and mili-
tancy. Between 1946 and 1956 all
was not easy. In the attempt by
other labor unions to split and
dissolve Mine-Mill, this local
union’s loyalty was tested again
and again. Local leaders who
succumbed to the anti-Mine-Mill
attempts were rejected by the
membership and new leadership
was elected.

In 1951, the last raid took
place on this local and new,
young leadership led the fight
for Mine-Mill. The raid was
smashed decisively.

Active then were many of the
local’s present leaders, including
John Infusino, then a stewardin
the plant. Other of the new

leadership. are Walter .Cer‘vo’ny-‘, if.

was Edmund Wallens,.wl1o
served as grievance chairman
for many years.

Immediately after the raid the
union played an outstanding role
in Mine-Mill’s great negotiating
victory of 1951, when Mine-Mill,
insistent that a wage freeze was
not necessary and was in fact
unfair to the workers, led its
historic fight. A 21-cent one-year
wage package was the result.
That was the year when fully-
paid hospital-medical coverage
was established, three weeks
vacation, and the seventh holi-
day. In addition, in the East,
death-in-the-family leave and
jury duty pay first appeared.

In 1956, when Brother Infusino
took office as president after
having served as trustee and
financial secretary, the local
leadership had a vision of a
local headquarters where union
activities could be conducted in
the proper atmosphere and with
the facilities needed by a
modern union. Infusino recalls,
“The local union ‘adopted its
present economic practices. We
set up a budget for all our activ--
ities and stuck to it. As a re-
sult, our local, which had been
in financial straits for ‘years,
began to build up its finances.”

"I959 to the Present

But once again all was not
without effort, and the wonder-
ful unity of the membership was
againcalled upon in a number
of long labor struggles. The
strike of 1959 lasted over five
months and the loyalty of the
men of 365 never wavered. The
outstanding victory of the strike,
Infusino feels, is “when we in-
sisted that the company pay
back charges on hospital-medh

.- _cal -c.0v.erage ..which they. had

dropped during the ‘strike.’_’ .

call that the first breakthrough
came in the 'AS&R ‘chain. Par-
ticipating in that struggle was
the membership‘ and local
leaders of" the Perth Amboy
Smelter and Refinery Workers
Union. Infusino was chairman
of the union’s- AS&R Council.

The local union,.'now the old-
est in the East, makes up, along
with Baltimore AS&R and the
U. S. Metals Refining plant in
Carteret, N .1 J ., a powerful com-
bination in the struggle for con-
ditions for the nonferrous metals
workers. Its membership re-
mains determined to continue
the march forward.

They continue to support the
basic militancy and democracy
of Mine-Mill and practice it in
their trade-union lives.

Ashury Howard Honored

For Registration Work  

BESSEMER, Ala.-—Mine-Mill Vice-President Asbury Howard,

who has served as president of the Bessbmer Voters League for the
past 16 years, was honored at the group’s annual Lincoln-Douglass
Day Dinner on Feb. 12 at the George Washington Carver High

School.

In his absence, Howard’s wife Mabel accepted the gifts and
flowers that were presented on behalf of the citizens of Bessemer
and surrounding areas, thousands of whom are now registered to

vote because of the activities of
the Voters League.

The Rev. Jesse Leon Dansby,
pastor of the Salem Baptist

Church in Greensboro, delivered -

the major address of the even-
ing.

Although Howard is now work-
ing out of the Denver Mine-Mill

‘office, it was reported that the

v ot e r registration campaign
which he formulated some years
ago is still gaining momentum.

Mrs. Howard graciously ac-
cepted the gifts and thanked the
citizens, but told those in the
audience that they might better
express their appreciation “in
deeds of service to humanity.”

The theme of the affair was
“Facing Our Responsibility in a
Changing Age.” The common
reasons given for‘ opposing
change—-—the time is not ripe;
the situation is hopeless; the
problem involves a controver-
sial issue—are often simple ra-
tionalizations with little or no

basis in fact, said the program.

“In times like
“we can’t afford

these,” it said,
to do nothing.” ,
In Bessemer and other areas
of the South, of course, it’s
sometimes dangerous" to do any-
thing.‘ »

Anaconda Development in Arizona

The Anaconda Company has announced that it has exercised

its option to develop an open pit copper mine, Twin Buttes Mine,

in Pima County, Arizona, under a lease arrangement with the
Banner Mining Company. The cost of development is expected to
run to about $50 million over the next five years, with ore pro-
duction to be available in 1970. Stripping will remove about 100
‘million tons of overburden, averaging a depth of 460 feet, to un-
cover an ore body that may hold out 40 to 50 years. Copper yield
will be about 13 pounds to the ton.

About four years will be required to uncover the orebody,

 and during this time a mill will be constructed. A 900-foot pilot

shaft h-as been sunk and stripping will begin around the end of
this year. _ ‘

 _ ‘Ultimately the operation will employ 500 to 600 men.

cooper shortage. A recent proposal by Senator Stuart Symington

Die Casters Predict Another Record Year

Die casters, who had a record year in 1964, are hopeful that
zinc_ stockpile release will relieve the shortage of metal that has
hampered the industry, (Zinc supply was further tightened last
month with a two—week strike at AS&R’s Corpus Christi‘ plant,
the tie-up of imports by the dock strike, and loss of production
that has resulted since flooding of the Spanish Reocin zinc mine.)

The American Die Casting Institute reports that record auto

- productionresulted in zinc die "casting output ofi826 million pounds,-

topping the high set in 1955. David Laine, secretary of the insti-
tute, forecasts an increase in 1965 of six to seven percent over 1964
’ producti'on. .
' ’ At the same time, development of an improved process for
chromium plating of plastic may cut into zinc die casting. The
newprocess would eliminate the need for zinc castings for pro-

.,duction_of auto door lock buttons, insignia and bumper parts,

  

,  sheriijparts, cradio knobs, fishing reels, plumbing supplies, and
 :%,variety'?_of other";compon'ents. It is reported to be not onlyless

ijl'i:expensive,. but more flexible in terms of product design, and per-

ning at Anaconda’s El Salvador mine for 3,600 workers. The con-
tract expires April 30 and demands include a wage increase of
85 percent and fringes running from 80 to 150 percent. Previous

contract settlement resulted in a 45 percent wage increase, but

not until after workers struck for a month. '

Slash in Antimony Oxide. Price ,

.The National Lead Company, whose antimony smelter in La-
redo, Texas is under contract with Mine-Mill Local 412, announced
a 10-cent cut in antimony oxide prices early this month——from 60
to 50 cents a pound on carload lots. American Smelting and Refin-
ing followed along, although M&T Chemicals of New York cut only
to 57 cents. A

.Reason for the price reduction is the increased availability of
antimony metal over the period early last year when China, the

world’s leading producer, stopped selling its output to Europe. At,

that time, prices went up from 36'cents in March 1964 to 60 cents,
in a few jumps. Industry spokesmen said that new mines opening
up in Latin America were the reason for the easing of supplies.
_ , Antimony is used in battery grids,‘ for type metal, in flame-
proofingchemicals, and has applications in the chemical, plastics,
and ceramics industries.

Lead. Situation snii Tight

Lead statistics _for‘_1964 compiled by the American Bureau,

of Metal Statistics begar .out=t‘he.tight picture, that was _recognized

some time ago. Although, production was ‘up 61,000’ tons" over 1963, ‘

to 479,250, shipinients‘ ’fell'by 5,500 pounds. This "does not mean that
supplies are catching up—on the contrary—it indicates that pri-
mary ‘producers are rea'chi_ng the end of their capacity. ‘ . 2,

Although -U. S. ‘Amine ‘output isbeing ex_pa'nd_ed, the results are

n.ot expected to show up in ‘1965, and competition for foreign ores"

is still keen. If the Tariff Commission decides to eliminate quotas

on foreign imp_orts -and. if-Congress releases the requested 150,000

tons of stockpile lead, there maybe some relief, although demand
is expected to increase still further. ~

Gov't-Company Agreement "IHTHIE Congo 8.
' An agreement has‘ been signed between Congolese‘ -Premier"
Moise Tshombe and the -Belgian-owned copper company, Union .-
Miniere’ of Katanga province in the Congo. Union Miniere is the-

single largest economic prop of the Congolese. economy, and the
government, as a result of the agreement, nowholds a 24 percent
interest in the company. V

Terms oftheagreement covered payment of royalties to the
government, and the ending of rights to grant mining and land
concessions, formerly held by the Special Committee of Katanga,
a corporation through whichithe old Belgian colonial administration
and a private Belgian concern had controlled Katanga mining.
The agreement also provides for settlement of the Congo’s debt

to the Belgian government, and the resumption of interest pay-z

ments to Belgian holders of defaulted Congo bonds.

The agreement is regarded by some as having a stabilizing
effect on relations between the Tshombe government and Belgium,
and as boosting the premier’s prospects for the March 18 elections
in the Congo. The Mining Journal of London notes, however, that
“Against the sombre back-ground of organized rebellion and the
discouraging outlook for -therestoration of a cohesive and orderly
Congo, it is hard to assess in realistic perspective the significance
of the agreement. . . .” ~
