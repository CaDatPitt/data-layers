’ TRAIL, B. C.—-Local 4230, Trail, and Local 651 Kimberley,
have voted 1673 to 947 to accept the majority report of the.
conciliation board on the disputed agreement with Consolidated
Mining and Smelting Company Ltd. The company also accepted.
. The dispute arose out of the refusal of the CM&S directors
to approve revisions to the pensions plan, and their consequent
’ repudiation of their management’s bargaining committee, They .
_ claimed the plan was not a subject for negotiations, since it,

On this point, the majority'report ruled that under the

pany to read the Industrial Conciliation and Arbitration. Act,
and certain literature on the subject furnished by the govern-
ment. This u n d o u b t e d l y settles the question for future

CANADA HAS  
,NAT'L FEP LAW

Canada now has a Fair Em-
ployment Practices Act, passed
at thelast session, of the Domin-
ion Parliament, just prior to the-
proposed general election in
August.

The act will apply to all _oper-
ations in territories, and to
Crown companies (such as in the
uranium industry) anywhere. The
provinces are being urged by

, unions to .enact similar legisla-
tion to cover provincial labor.

The Act isdesigned “to pre-
vent and eliminate practices of

, discrimination against persons in
regard to employment _ and in
regard to membership in a trade
union because o'f race, national
origin, color, or religion,’?,-it is
stated in the preamble.

Le Delft for justice

¢1 letter bi/President ‘Robert Barcon -of Miami (Arizona) Miners Union, Local'5'86,' to Attorney General iBrownell

. expresses what thousands of other union members think about‘ frame-ups of union leaders.

The two union leaders referred to are Clinton"Jen_clcs, Mine—Mill Int’l representative, and Hugh Bryson, president of
the Marine Cooks &: Stewards Union. Both have been accused by the Justice Department of swearing falsely in their
Taft-Hartley non-C'ommunist affidavits, and grand jury indictments _ha_ve~been obtained. A  _ '

Excerpts from Barcqnis letter follow:_ -
' Letter sent earlier

,Mr. Herbert Brownell, Atty. Gen.

United States of America “
Justice Department_
Washington, D. C. I
Dear Sir: ' -

On behalf, of the other officers. and
the membership of the Miami Miners
Union, Local No. 586, International
Union of Mine, ”
Mill an d Smelter
-Workers, I respect-
fully request that
the indictments
against Clint
Jencks and Hugh
Bryson be dropped."

We know ‘these
brother trade. union-

no crime,_ nor vio-
lated any law. They _
only did what thousands of other union

Robert . Barcon

fleaders  By this'we mean the _sign-_

ing of the non-communist affidavits.

 

The Taft-Hartley ‘Act in reality‘ left _

these people no choice in the matter.

If they didn't sign these a:ffidavits,- ’

_ then the unions that adopted the policy

of raiding and disruption could‘ and
would move in and try to destroy’ their '
unions.

.Now that they did sign those‘ affi-

’ davits, the government finds it easy

to secure the help of disgruntled mem-
bers and professional stool—pigeons
who, for a price, will gladly swear
that those leaders were and are mem-’
bers of the communist party.

Perhaps we wouldn’t consider it so
serious if -this thing was to be limited
td only Jencks and Bryson, but we"
know that if they can be persecuted
by this‘ method, then any trade union

    

ll...

\

a

manner. Not only that, but we're_con-

vjnced thatthey will_be before this is _

over. . _

So long as the vast majority of the
membership of the Marine Cooks’ and
Stewards Union, or the International
Union of Mine, Mill. and Smelter
Workers, or any other union, support
their leaders and think they are doing
a good job, then the government with
all their disgruntled members, paid

stool-pigeons and ‘Taft-Hartley Acts,

cannot destroy these unions. We will
never cease to fight until these, and
any others, who "are leaders or mem-
bers of, our unions,’ are free.

\

The records’ show that, the Justice _

Department nor an/yonegelse, in this
"government ‘is particulaivly~ concerned
about any communistin the unions, of’
this country. We’ve had leaders in our
own union who ’were' red-baited C by

‘other unions and by the government"

‘leader, either international or local, ,1 -
can likewise bepersecuted in the same

 
   
 

itself, as long as they were leaders
in our union, but the day they left the
union and went into private business,‘
that’s the day they became» respectable
businessmen, as well as the ‘day they
ceased to be red-baited. and hounded”

- by agents of the FBI and others.

You people aren’t kidding us one bit,

you aren't concerned about what ,,a

manis politics are as long ashe doesn’t
fight for decent wages, decent living
conditions, as long as he doesn’t— fight
for peace and equality for the Mexican-
American, the Negro and other mi-
nority gro/ups. ,  ‘

The day any man ceases to ,_fight
for, these things, you lose interest in
him, butso long’ as he does it doesn’t
matter what his politics are, his -is a
hard life for he is immediately branded.‘

We therefore respectfully request

that- you" use your office to secure the ’

disin'ssal of the indictments. against
thes ,two . men and any others who’.
may .,be-‘facing similar charges. .We'—

of the Ship Owners, the Mining Com-
panies and the-other corporations of
.thi_s.country and use the forces at
' your commandto round upithe many
criminals that are roaming ‘around
the country like the racketeers, the

 ‘income tax evaders, the dope’ peddlers

‘ and many, many others who are, day

after day,. violating every kind of law
and going -scot free. -

We'll be more than‘ glad to back you
and your depiirtment in any effort to
jail those who are degrading and
wrecking the lives of our high school
‘kids byselling them dopenwhiskey and
selling them into, a life of crime, and
prostitution. , -_

We know and you know that these
things are going on ‘E11’ over the coun-
try in almost every community of any
‘size. Yet the FBI and the Justice De-

_ partment doesn’t have the time or per-
'-sonnel to do anything about it because

they have to "‘ seek out the so-called-
reds in the labor unions of this country._

We make these criticisms of this
branch of our government in a con-

’ structive frame of mind. We know that’

, the Justice Department is one of the

most important departments in our
government; we’d like to be proud of
our Justice Departrrﬁant; we’d like fat‘

 the whole world to be.proud of‘ it, but

Yukon local

KENO HILL, Yukon-—'After many
abortive attempts, the lasbremaining‘
standout among leading Wester
Canada mines, the United Keno Hil
has at last been organized and the
local has been" chartered as No. 924,
Mayo District Mine, Mill and Smelter
Workers Union. '

Administration of the Yukon Terri-
tory is undenthe Federal Government,
and the company has‘ always taken

» full advantage of the lack of produc-‘

tion to workers and organizers im-
plicit in the national labor code. Any-
one who so much as mentioned “union"
was dismissed on one pretext or an-
other, and lately a preponderance of
immigrants and displaced persons of
several nationalities was utilized to
keep the union out. 

To the surprise of no one but the
owners, however, ese New Canadians
were almost unanimous for the union
when the cpportunity was presented
by International Representative Bar-

’ ney McGuire, who put on an organizing

\

blitz after some careful groundwork
had been, laid. ' «

THE BIG NEWS this week was the nation-wide strike Vote—the
second only in the 60 year ‘history of our union. The other vote taken
in August, 1951 presaged the first nation-wide strike in our industry. A
- The significance of the vote this year, even in contrast to the
6?‘ 1951 vote, was the high percentage» of “Yes” votes. There ‘is a reason
for this. It lies in the position being taken by the operators and their
attitude in negotiations. ..For the first time in _many years the big
{chains looked for the possibility of retracting long-standing benefits
in our contracts. The 90% strike vote was the workers’ answer.

If it is considered, this is an extraordinarily high “yes” vote.
Particularly in the face" of the employer barrage of propaganda this

. ear about threatened shut-downs and the alleged.‘.‘poverty”
 ndustry faces. But the bosses let the cat out of the bag.

Company demands to change seniority clauses so that they could’ '“

transfer and demote as they please _cannot be traced to a sick lead-'

The unprecedented demands for so-called “management” clauses.
which give/the company the right to_do everything but name your

i f  ’:‘;WASH‘I‘NGTON‘ —‘ Senator McCarthy's iron—fi:sted control over the’ acts and the.
5 "words" ‘of official America has begun to»slip.'_’ _When the three; Democratic members or
. "hisisub-comlnittee walked out, and President Eisenhower blasted his _chief “investiga-
tor,” others found‘ the courage to stand up and say what they thought, too.
L. .It -started when the Executive‘ Director of -the sub-colnmittee on “Internal Secur-
- ity,” J. B. Matthews, fired a red—bai-ting charge against tlletPi'otestalltclergy.

,. The three --Democratic members of the sub—committee then demanded..th_at Mat-
thews be fired. “When McCarthy refused, they quit the sub-comrnitt'ee.. Wide-spread
protests against" Matthew's attack brought astrong‘ statement from the President.
Within an hour, Matthews was fired. ' ' pp . __ ~_ _‘ .,

.As denunciation of M_cCarthy came from many quarters, the Democratic nflembers
refused to ret,urn. to the sub—committée. The Republicans, unwilling to be solely re-
sponsible for McCarthy, began to wonder whether he was becoming a political liability.

THE 0’BvI0Us ANSWER to" 'this‘lsi'tua-

tion, and one that other_gove1-mnent agen-
'cies‘re'cogn-ize, is to compute sepai-_ate‘;pro1 ~
ductivity indexes foreach lninipg (li.s_t1;i.cpt.'
This is ,what was done by the pre‘-_\va,r ,Na‘-_
tional Researcii Project (W.P.A.)". “The ‘Bu-
’-reau of Mines and Geological Survey in
their report, Material Survey-Lead, issued
-last year, also pointed up the need for this. —
type \of regional approach,

, The data needed for ,regional_ produc- I
tivity studies ‘is now available in the Bureau
'of‘Mines_; B.‘L.S.“compI'etely ignores these
very significant .-regional .dif’r.'erenees -2-
.doesn’t even mention them in its produc-

‘use the Bureau of_ Mines data"to“get_ a_

proper productivity series.-  . _~”.

'The World Congress of Women took
place in Copenhagen, Denmark, in-
June, 1953. This Congress was a gath-
ering of official d e l e g a t e s (2000

people all told) from over 70 countries, '

and representing 135, million women all
over the world. '
The purpose of this Conference was
to. give opportunity to the women of
different countries and "worlds, dif-
ferent races and nationalities, different

political and religious beliefs, to sit _,
togetger to discuss and find solutions

to b ing about the emancipation of-
women, to obtain ' and defend equal
rights for women, to safeguard our

' children and to attain a lasting peace
in the world.

4 I attendedthe Congress as a dele-

- gate on behalf of the ‘Ladies’ Auxiliary,
Local 117, IUMM&SW,.. the United
Ukranian Qanadian ‘ organization of
Sudbury, two Finnish organizations of
Sudbury and District, and the Sudbury
Chapter of the Congress of,/Canadian
Women. . _ r‘ "

I have never seen or,felt unity and
common purpose such as wasapparent
in» this Congress. During the reports
of the various countries, I was often

-overcome with. emotion, to hear how‘
terribly women still suffer in this day
and age. p

In Korea, Vietiiam and Malaya the
women suffer doubly with the war ra. -
in'g. Othersisee their children slaugh-
tered before their eyes, and others are

-starving to death. Delegates_ from__

these three countries were'not allowed
visas to enter Denmark., but .-sent
their reports in which were read to
a tearful and deeply moved delegation.

The Koreans begged the American
delegates, on their return_ to the
United \States‘,‘-to unite the mothers
and wives of soldiers in‘ Korea to de-
mand‘ their government to recall all
troops fromtheir country. Women. in
the U. S.,‘,Gr_eat Britain and France,
as well as in’ the war-torn countries,
mourn husbands and sons killedin the
war, yet’ armament production in-
creases, using upxas much as 70% of
some countries’ budgets, leaving only
small sums for ‘health, housing and
food. ’

‘ In Japan the people sell their very

t

blood for. American soldiers in order
to buy food. 55% of all suicides in
Japan are women who first kill“ their
small babies and then’ themselves, _be-
cause they have no way to provide food

. mouth to feed at home. An actual true
story of conditions is given by a work-

_ ing Iranian mother who gave birth to"

OPEN FORUM

A REPORT ON WOMEN'S WORLD CONGRESS '

— To the Editor:

;

a'chi1d at her, factory machine, and
since it died, had to bury her baby in
the factory.~ ‘She wasn’t allowed time
off, and had she left her much needed
job even for 8. little while, hundreds
of starving women waited in line out-
side the gate to take her place.

In France old-age pensioners are
forced to beg on the streets to supple-
ment their pension sufficiently to live.
One working mother we saw returning
from market on her way home from
work‘ (Paris), her two little ragged
girls with her, had only one onion. in
her n1a1'ket/basket‘. The average per-

son in France is poor. There are a

million people right in Paris without’-
any kind of bathing facilities.

In Copenhagen I visited the slums
where 70,000 people live in over-
crowded, old and shabby housing units.
A family with 10 ‘children lived in a.
very small two and a half room flat
which we visited. We asked the lady
of the place how they all fit in there.
She just shrudded her shoulders and
said what else can we do. This was »
not the worst example of over-crowd-
ing, just chosen at random.

In some countries the women have
attained rights on _an equal footing
with men. The Rumanian spokes-
woman, who was a delegate from a
trade union and from the Democratic
Federation of Rumania, said: “We are
the masters in our country today. Our
equality has been ratified in_the Con-

stitution and we enjoy thesame rights . -

with man. The many-sided activities
we have are new for most of the
women and the magnificent example
of the Soviet women constitutes inval-~
uable help to us. - 

.From the German Democratic Re-V ._

public delegates’ repo1't—“We have not
forgotten the chaos of our economy
caused by the terrible war only a few-
years ago. Women and children, those ..
who were left, had to work fields alone
wherjtlieir men had been killed. After
liberation’ by the Soviet Army and
their constant help, a new life began.
Education fields widened -for women,‘
children’s ca1'e and medical ‘services
have been set up free of charge. We

can only accomplish more when Peace _

is secure in the world. Long Live
Peace.” . -. I .

Every delegate came away from this
Congress with a renewed strength and
a will to work still harder to unite all
peoples, both men and ‘_women, in this
struggle for a world at Peace, women’:

.. Let us unite‘ our efforts, in this

common struggle. ~UNITY‘is‘the con-
dition of victory. .
