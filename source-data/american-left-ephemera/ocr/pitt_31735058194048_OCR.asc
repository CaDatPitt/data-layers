distribution in the United States. Within a matter of days,
across the whole great span of the land, Americans were
enlisting by the thousands in the worldwide crusade to avert
the measureless horror of an atomic war. In city after city,
peace committees and trade unions, organizations of
women, youth, veterans, parents. and students pledged
themselves to collect signatures on the Appeal. Prominent
churchmen, scientists, writers, jurists and educators en-

. dorsed the Appeal and urged others to sign.’

In a letter informing the Peace Infonnation Center of

their intention to collect 50,000 signatures, members of the ,

Pension Union in Washington State wrote: “Of course, we
are old people, but we want to see the state we helped build
stay green and beautiful and not be turned into a bleak
Nagasaki.”

Ahnost one million Americans had signed the World
Peace Appeal by the fateful last week of June, when
smouldering international tensions ﬂamed into war in Korea
and the armed forces of the United States were committed
on the side of the Syngman Rhee regime.

And during the dark and perilous days that followed, as a
third world war seemed ever more imminent, Americans
added their signatures by the tens of thousands in an
impassioned expression of their resolve to maintain peace.

There were, however, powerful interests in America
which regarded not war but peace as a dread menace.

On August -4, with corporation proﬁts from war orders l

5 Among the noted Americans signing the Appeal were Bishop Arthur
W. Moulton of Utah; Bishop Sherman L. Greene of Alabama: Justice
James H. Wolfe of the Supreme Court of Utah: composer Duke
Ellington; nuclear physicist, Dr. Philip Morrison: Fred Stover, President
of the Iowa Farmers Union; Paul Robeson; Emily Greene Balch, Nobel
Prize winner: and Dr. Anton Carlson of the University of Chicago.

soaring to unprecedented heights, the big business journal,
U. 8. News and World Report, admonished its readers:

Just keep this point in the back of your minds.

A peace offensive can break out. Peace is Russia's
propaganda game. ’

Peace moves by Russia, right now, could embarrass
U. S. They would get much support in a world fearful

of big war . . . Of course, if a real “peace scare” should_

now develop, watch out . . . the boom would crack.

. A similar anxiety over the chance of peace was felt in top
army circles. As Holmes Alexander reported in his syn-
dicated column:

Military chiefs dread even the remote possibility of
mediation in Korea . . . They need an extensive period in
that bloody peninsula in order to pyramid what is realis-
tically called “bodies and gtms.” Pentagon chiefs know
that the more men in Korea, the more men and weapons
Congress will authorize for services elsewhere. . . ‘. War»
mongering may now be called the almost ofﬁcial Pen»
tagon policy.

Nor were high—ranking members of the U. S. Covemment

K disregarding the danger of a “peace offensive.”

4. COUNTER-OFFENSIVE
SooN AFTER the outbreak of the Korean war, conﬁdential
letters were dispatched from the U. ,'S. State Department
to a number of carefully selected individuals in different
parts of the United States. I chanced to see one of these

a communications. Signed by Francis H. Russell, Director of

-Oflice of Public Affairs, the letter had been sent to the
president of a West Coast bank. Russell informed the
banker that the State Department was holding private

(at)

conferences to devise methods of thwarting the collection

of signatures on the World Peace Appeal in America. “I,

should be pleased,” wrote Russell, “to arrange for you to
attend one of the Department’s regular brieﬁng sessions on
world developments if you will let me know anytime that
you plan to be in the vicinity.” p

Accompanying Russell's letter was a three-page mimeo-
graphed memorandum entitled Moscow’s “Signatures for
Peace” Campaign. Characterizing the World Peace Appeal
as “the newest major development in Moscow’s ‘peace
offensive’,” the memorandum declared that one of the
sinister aims of the Appeal was “to make any use of the
atom bomb seem morally indefensible.”

This memorandum had not been prepared solely for the
consideration of the West Coast banker. Although bearing
no markings identifying its origin or authorship, the memo-
randum was being sent by the State Department to con-
gressmen, government agencies and U. S. foreign missions,
as well as to numerous editors, radio news-commentators,
educators, Negro leaders and other persons in a position to
inﬂuence public opinion . . ."

° As the two Americans on the Resolutions Committee at__Stockholm
which had drafted the World Peace Appeal, Rockwell Kent and the author
of this pamphlet wrote Secretary Acheson informing him of the ﬂagrant

inaccuracy of the State Department memorandum on the Appeal. We
advised the Secretary that the American delegates to the Stockholm

. Conference had received no “orders from Moscow” but had supported the

demand to outlaw the atom bomb because “we knew we were expressing
the heartfelt desire of millions of Americans to eliminate the threat of
this most monstrous weapon." We added that we would be glad ‘to come
to Washington to give a firsthand account of the democratic parliamen-
tary conduct of the Stockholm Conference and its “broadly representative
character . . . not only in terms of nationality but also of vocation,
religious faith and political persuasion.”

However, unlike the West Coast banker and other recipients of letters
from Director of Public Aifairs Francis Russell, Kent and I were not
invited to visit the State Department.

(xi)

On July 12 Secretary of State Acheson released to the
press an official statement denouncing the World Peace
Appeal as a “propaganda trick” in a Soviet “peace offen-
sive.” “I am sure,” declared Secretary Acheson, “that the
American people will not be fooled by the so-called ‘world
peace appeal.’ ”

The Administration, however, preferred not to rely upon
the judgment of the American people in this matter. Secre-
tary Acheson’s statement and the memorandum, M oscow's
“Signatures for Peace” Campaign, were the opening phases
of an elaborately contrived, intensive propaganda campaign
to convince the public that the World Peace Appeal was
part of a Machiavellian Soviet conspiracy against the inter-
ests and security of the United States.

Newspapers from coast to coast were soon featuring
articles and editorials virulently attacking the Appeal.
Radio commentators urged their listeners to turn in to the
police authorities or FBI the names of persons circulating
the Appeal. The Un-American Activities Committee pub-
lished a report assailing the Appeal as “a Communist world-
wide peace offensive.” Ambassador Warren Austin, Ameri-
can delegate to the United Nations, publicly declared that
signers of the Appeal were “traitors to their country.”

There were other, more grim aspects to the campaign
against the World Peace Appeal. ..

An epidemic of violence against persons circulating the
Appeal had broken out in the country. In Linden, New
Jersey, a man collecting signatures was set upon by hood-
lums and beaten unconscious. In Milwaukee, Wisconsin,
a man who had signed the Appeal was hurled from a
second—story window; he ‘suffered a broken back. In Phila-
delphia, Detroit, Los Angeles and other cities, peace rallies

we)

were forcibly broken up and peace demonstrators assaulted.
When arrests were made, the police almost invariably jailed

those who had been attacked or were circulating the peace '

petitions. “Instead of putting these guys in jail,” declared
Covemor ]ames Duff of Pennsylvania, “they ought to be
hanged.”

On August 2, in New York City, the campaign of violence
against the peace movement reached a bloody climax.

Arally sponsored by the National Labor Peace Con-
ference had been scheduled for that afternoon in Union
Square; but Mayor O’Dwyer had arbitrarily refused to
grant a permit for the assembly. To protest the ban and
demonstrate their desire for peace, thousands of New
Yorkers gathered quietly along‘ the streets bordering the
Square at the time set for the meeting. The Square itself
was ringed by more than a thousand uniformed police
ofﬁcers, mounted policemen, radio-car patrolmen and
detectives. . . .

Suddenly, and without warning, the police charged into

v the crowd. F lailing right and left with their riot sticks,

they savagely beat men and women to the ground. Mounted
police spurred their horses onto the sidewalks, riding
people down, indiscriminately clubbing demonstrators and
onlookers. Describing the scene, Sid Kline later reported
to the New York Daily Compass:
I heard beaten men groan- with pain, and saw them
kicked again before the sound of their cries had vanished.
I heard women scream in agony, and I heard the sobs
of other women driven near to hysteria by what they
saw happen to others whom they did not know—but who
were human beings.

Scores were seriously injured . . .

if (xiii)

Ted Thackrey, editor and publisher of the Compass,
bitterly commented: “Our democracy is not dying—it is
being clubbed to deat .”

5. THE NATURE OF THE CRIME

THE WIDESPREAD concerted campaign of propaganda,
intimidation, repression and violence had failed, however,
to dam the ground swell of anti-war sentiment surging
through the land.

With casualties grimly mounting among U. S. troops on
the desperately-held beachhead in Korea, more and more
citizens on the home front were demanding an end to the
sanguinary military adventure. Press and radio polls showed
overwhelming majorities opposed to continued American
participation in the war. By rnid-surnmer the number of
young men failing to answer their draft calls had reached
such proportions nationally that the ﬁgure was being kept
a military secret and special FBI contingents had been
formed to round up the delinquents.

Regarding peace activities during the early days of
August, the National Guardian reported:

From thousands of pulpits in hundreds of U. S. com-l

munities religious leaders were resisting the tide toward
war . . . From coast to coast a small army of brave people
were still ringing doorbells, canvassing their neighbors,
holding street corner rallies, getting more signatures to
peace petitions. In many localities this had become dan-
gerous but the work went on . . .

By August the Peace Information Center had distributed
throughout the country more than a million peace emblems,
pamphlets, bulletins and petitions. Included among the
petitions were tens of thousands of copies of the World

( xiv )
Peace Appeal. Notwithstanding every oﬂicial and unoﬂicial
contrivance to stop them, two million Americans had thus
far signed the Appeal . . .

It was clear that if the growing demand for peace was
to be stiﬂed, new and more stringent measures were essen-
tial on the part of the Administration. One such measure
was about to be taken.

On August 11 the Department of justice summarily
demanded that the Peace Information Center register
immediately “as an agent of a foreign principal . . . under
the terms of the Foreign Agents Registration Act.”

Shocked and outraged, the leaders of the Peace Informa-
tion Center denounced the ]ustice Department’s action as
an effort to discredit their work and frighten them into
inactivity. Speaking as the Center’s Chairman, Dr. Du Bois
declared in a public statement:

The Peace Information Center is an entirely American
organization whose sole object is to prevent a third World
War . . . The desire for peace cannot be made an "alien
sentiment.”

But the action of the Justice Department was not without
its effect. Branded as a “foreign agent” by the press and
radio, it became increasingly diﬂicult for the Center to
function effectively and raise suﬁcient funds for its work.

On October 12, after bringing its message of peace to
millions of Americans, the Peace Information Center was
dissolved by decision of its executive board.

Four months later, on February 9, 1951, the Justice
Department indicted Dr. Du Bois and four of his former
associates in the Peace Information Center for failure to

register ‘as foreign agents. Conviction on this charge could

(xv)

carry a prison sentence of ﬁve years and a $10,000 ﬁne for
each of the accused.

For the Administration had not been content merely with
the dissolution of the Peace Information Center. The
American people needed to be taught a more important
lesson.

And this was the lesson Americans were intended to
learn: that advocacy of peace had become a crime in the
United States and that those who spoke out against war
were “foreign agents.”

6. FOR THE DEFENSE

THE SHOCKING indictment of Dr. Du Bois and his associates
precipitated an outcry of protest and condemnation through-
out the country. Numerous civic, religious, professional,
labor and Negro organizations, and scores of outstanding
public ﬁgures, sharply decried the persecution of the former
leaders of the Peace Information Center and called for the
immediate withdrawal of the indictment.

“As a worker in science,” declared the eminent nuclear
physicist, Dr. Philip Morrison, "I am especially moved to
protest the injustice of a prosecution based on the idea that
the search for peace is alien. Peace, like science, ought to
know no boundaries. It demands- not stigma, but recog-
nition.”

From every section of the American Negro community
came ﬁery denunciations of the Govemment’s action against
Dr. Du Bois and the monstrous indignity of his arraignment
in Washington.

“If an outstanding American like Dr. Du Bois who has
given ﬁfty years of his life in the battle to wipe out second
class citizenship for the Negro could be indicted because he

(xvi)

was an oflicer sponsoring a petition for peace throughout
the world,” stated ]udge Hubert T. Delaney of New York
City, “then few of us are safe from attack upon our loyalty
to the country of our birth.”
In the Pittsburgh Courier, Marjorie McKenzie wrote:
The choice of Dr. Du Bois as a defendant is neither
random nor routine . . . It occurs at a time when no other
American Negro of comparable stature has spoken so
fearlessly and critically of United States policies . . . We
have to take a stand, here and now, with Dr. Du Bois.

‘ On February 23, one week after his arraignment, a tes-
timonial dinner to honor Dr. Du Bois on the occasion of his
eighty-third birthday took place in New York City. The
sponsoring committee of the dinner was composed of more

, than three hundred of the nation’s outstanding educators,

writers, religious leaders and scientists.

“I stand tonight facing the possibility of celebrating my
future birthdays in prison,” Dr. Du Bois told the hundreds
of men and women assembled to pay tribute to him. “The
prospect is not pleasant. Yet I continue to maintain that
advocacy of peace is not treason; that I am the agent of no
foreign principal and never have been; that I am the cham-
pion of no idea alien to this nation; and that I have the right
within the law in the future as in the past to ﬁght for peace.”

It is to safeguard this right not only for Dr. Du Bois and
his associates but for the nation as a whole that ever-growing
numbers of Americans are demanding the Government
abandon its willful prosecution of the Peace Information
Center.

And in proclaiming their prerogative to ﬁght for peace
and the prevention of an atomic war, these Americans are
asserting their unalienable right to life itself.

HOW TO AID IN THE DEFENSE

There are a number of ways in which to render aid to the
defense of Dr. Du Bois and his associates.

Messages should be sent to President Truman and At-
torney General McGrath urging that the indictments be
promptly dropped.

Financial support should be given to the National Com-
mittee to Defend Dr. W. E. B. Du Bois and Associates in
the Peace Information Center, 16-18 West 29th Street,
New York City, N. Y. (Make checks payable to Shirley
Graham, Treasurer.)

Concerning the author of this pamphlet

A graduate of Dartmouth College and winner of the
Crawford-Campbell Literary Fellowship, Albert E.
Kahn was editor during 1939-1944 of The Hour,
a newsletter which achieved wide distinction for its
revelations concerning Axis espionage, sabotage and
propaganda operations in the Americas. In 1942, in_
collaboration with Michael Sayers, M_r. Kahn wrote
Sabotage], which was reprinted in condensation in
Reader’s Digest and became one of the leading
bestsellers of the war years. Together with Michael
Sayers, Mr. Kahn wrote two more bestsellers: The
Plot Against the Peace ( 1945) and The Great Con-
spiracy (1946). In addition to reaching a circula-
tion of a quarter of a million copies in the United
States, The Great Conspiracy has been translated
into approximately thirty languages and published,
in probably more foreign lands than any other non-
fiction book of the last decade. Mr. Kahn’s most
recent book, High Treason: The Plot Against the
People, has already had a circulation of more than
60,000 copies in America and has been translated
into numerous languages.

—Dr. W. E. B. Du Bois ~

1. COURT HOUSE SCENE

ON THE MORNING of February 16, 1951, in the Federal Dis-V
trict Court House in Washington, D. C., one of the greatest
living Americans was arraigned on criminal charges brought
against him by the United States Department of Justice.
He was Dr. W. E. B. Du Bois, the eighty-two year old
world-renowned scholar and Negro statesman who, as John
Gunther writes in Inside America, "has a position almost
like that of . . . Einstein, being the most venerable and
distinguished of leaders in his ﬁeld.”

For more than half a century, the vast and varied talents
of Dr. Du Bois had been passionately devoted to the ad-
vancement of world peace and the well-being of mankind.
On myriad fronts, he had waged an incessant, uncompro-
mising, wrathful struggle against war, the wrongs of society
and the suffering of man. Universally revered as a protag-
onist of his people, world-famed as an exponent of freedom
for the colonial nations, this small, sedate, quiet-spoken

(ii)

American Negro stood as a colossus of his time whose thun-
dering eloquence echoed around the earth like a tocsin of
the human conscience.‘

Now Dr. Du Bois was accused by the Justice Department
of a most extraordinary crime. He was charged with the
advocacy of peace. Together with four former associates in
the Peace Information Center, of which he had been Chair-
man, Dr. Du Bois had been indicted by the Department of
Justice on the charge of failure to register as a foreign
agent.”

The proceedings in the Federal Court House were held
in the Criminal Courtroom. Before Dr. Du Bois and his
associates were summoned to the bar, a number of accused
criminals appeared before the presiding magistrate, judge
Dickinson Letts, to have dates scheduled for their trials.
As one of the journalists present, I noted down the crimes
with which these individuals were charged: “Manslaughter
—assault to commit robbery-—violation of lottery laws—theft
—forgery.” Such was the category in which the Peace In-
formation Center case had been placed . . .

After setting the date for the Peace Information Center

9 Poet and university professor; co-founder of the National Associa-
tion for the Advancement of Colored People and editor of The Crisis for
more than twenty years; U. S. minister plenipotentiary to Liberia and
special consultant to the United Nations; founder of the Pan-African
Congresses and author of such brilliant works as The Souls of the Black
Folk, Dark Water, Dusk of Dawn and Black Rcco-natruct1'on—these were
some of the multiple attainments of the amazingly versatile and proliﬁc
Dr. Du Bois.

*5 Indicted with Dr. Du Bois were Mrs. Elizabeth Moos, well-known
educator, the first executive director of the Peace Information Center;
Abbott Simon, subsequent executive director, a World War II veteran
who had played a leading role in peace organizations since the end of the
war; Kyrle Elkin, a public-spirited businessman who had been the Center's
treasurer; and Sylvia Soloﬂ, a young woman indicted merely because she
had been employed at the Center as a clerical worker.

trial,’ Judge Letts ordered Dr. Du Bois and his co-defend-
ants into the custody of a U. S. marshal while bond was
being posted on their bail. They were led from the court-
room and taken down the “criminal chute” into the cell
block. There, behind heavily barred doors, in the company
of suspected drug addicts and prostitutes, they were photo-
graphed, ﬁngerprinted and searched for weapons.

Then Dr. Du Bois was brought from the cell block; and
on the wrists of the elderly genius there were manacles . . .

Later, outside the courthouse, near a statue of Abraham
Lincoln, newsmen interviewed Dr. Du Bois. .

“It is a curious thing,” Dr. Du Bois told the reporters,
“that today I am called upon to defend myself against
criminal charges for openly advocating the one thing all
people want—peace.”

2. MEETING PLACE FOR PEACE

IT WAS early in April 1950 that a group of writers, church-
men, small businessmen and trade unionists had come
together in New York City and founded the Peace Informa-
tion Center."

Only ﬁve short years had elapsed since the agony and
havoc of the Second World War; and yet, incredibly
enough, the dark clouds of a new and even more fearsome
conflict now brooded ominously over every land. The secure
and lasting peace so hopefully projected at Yalta and Pots-
dam seemed like an ill—remembered dream of the past.
Fierce international tensions, prodigious armament pro-

5 Originally set for April 2, the date of the Peace Information Center
trial was subsequently postponed to May 14 and then October 2.
“V Those assembled at the meeting constituted themselves as Advisory
Council to the Peace Information Center. Dr. Du Bois was elected Chaib
man, and Mrs. Elizabeth Moos was appointed Executive Director.

( iv )
grams and frenzied preparations for atomic global warfare
were the nightmarish reality of the present.

“We have drifted into an age of unprecedented anxiety
and fear,” declared Dr. John B. Thompson, Dean of the
Rockefeller Memorial Chapel. “It is not simply that we
fear that we shall die . . . It is the fear that the whole human
enterprise is washed up and hopeless.” But there were
Americans, added the eminent churchman, who refused to
resign themselves to the ineffable disaster of another war.
“We still believe that peace is possible . . . we do not believe
that there are any differences between us and our potential
enemies great enough to justify mutual destruction.”

The beliefs of Dr. Thompson were fervently shared by
the founders of the -Peace Information Center. Of urgent
moment, they felt, was the spreading of knowledge about
the tidal wave of peace sentiment sweeping through the

world. Day and night, the American press and radio were '

bruiting dire prophecies of war and portentous accounts of
the imminent danger of armed attack. Scarcely a whisper
was to be heard about mammoth peace conferences in Paris,
Rome, Bombay and Prague, or the activities of multiple
peace groups in the United States. Yet what was of more
momentous concern than that the peoples of all lands be
made aware of their common hopes and strivings for peace?
VVhat, indeed, could more surely advance the cause of
peace than the dissemination of this knowledge?

Reasoning thus, the founders of the Peace Information
Center set these as the organization’s chief objectives: to
publicize facts about peace endeavors of all sorts in America
and throughout the rest of the world; and to provide media
for the interchange of ideas for the promotion of peace and
amity among the nations.

( 0 )

Headquarters for the Peace Information Center were es-
tablished in a small oﬂice in New York City, and the work
of the organization got under way.

The initial project of the Center was a bi-weekly bulletin,
entitled Peaoegram. Concisely summarizing international

peace developments, the first issue of the bulletin reported

such events as these:

A Italy: 30,000 peace committees organized. . . . In
Israel, Bombay, Budapest thousands attend peace con-
ferences and call for banning atomic weapons. . . .

Geneva: Worldwide appeal to outlaw atomic weapons
launched by International Red Cross Committee. . . .

United States: Philadelphia—Women organize petition
campaign for peace. . . . Boston—Massachusetts Action
Committee for Peace inaugurates campaign for 100,000
votes to outlaw the atom bomb, for general disarmament,
and immediate peace talks between the great powers. . . .
Chz'cago—Mid-Century Conference for Peace called by
Committee for Peaceful Alternatives. . . .

There was nothing pretentious about the Peacegram. The .

terse facts ﬁlling its four multigraphed pages were pre-
sented without stylistic embellishment or editorial comment.
But the facts had an eloquence of their own.

Letters began pouring into the office of the Peace In-
formation Center. They came from the Paciﬁc coast, the
deep South and the midland plains, from great industrial
centers and obscure little towns, from organizations and
individuals. They enthusiastically hailed the establishment
of the Center, eagerly requested more news of the world
peace movement, and exuberantly told of local peace ac-

‘ tivities—of forming peace councils and holding peace rallies,

of staging demonstrations, distributing leaﬂets, circulating
petitions. In different words, they all voiced the same mes-

(vi)

sage: a message of kinship with the peoples of other lands
and of determination to keep the peace.

And suddenly it was as if, by some strange alchemy, the
hectic little oﬂice with its clattering typewriters and jan-
gling telephone had been transformed into a meeting place
where men and women from all parts of the land were
clasping hands in a solemn covenant to safeguard the lives

and laughter of their children.

With requests for more peace material mounting daily,
the Peace Infonnation Center supplemented its Peacegram
with a series of leaﬂets.“ As rapidly as they were printed,
the leaflets were consumed by communities throughout the
country. Surfeited with war propaganda, people were fam-
ished for words of peace.

Numerous persons urged that a peace petition be added
to the literature distributed by the Peace Information Cen-
ter. Hundreds of peace petitions with various appeals were
being circulated in America and other lands. Of all of them,
one promised to inspire the broadest response among the
American people.

It was known as the World Peace Appeal or Stockholm
Pledge.

3. WORLD PEACE APPEAL

TI-IE WonLn PEACE APPEAL called for outlawing atomic
weapons, strict international control to enforce this measure,
and branding as a war criminal the ﬁrst government to
resort in the future to the use of such weapons. Crystallizing
the fervent will of countless millions in every nation, the

Information Center: The People of the World Want Peace, Catholics
Speak for Peace, The Negro People Speak for Peace, The Text of the
International Red Cross Appeal.

(vii)

Appeal had been unanimously voted in Stockholm on
March 19, 1950, by the Permanent Committee of the World
Congress of the Defenders of Peace.‘

Overnight the Appeal had become the rallying cry of a
peace crusade of titanic scope. In scores of languages, its
words raced across the continents of the world. Unresting
legions of people yearning for peace began collecting sig-
natures on Appeal petitions. By the end of May, more than
100,000,000 human beings had already signed the Appeal.

“Who is signing the Appeal?” wrote the famous French‘
priest, Abbe ]ean Boulier, in a letter addressed to religious
leaders in every land. “The human race.”“"

Early in June, responding to insistent demands on all
sides, the Peace Information Center undertook to print
World Peace Appeal petitions and make them available for

* The World Congress of the Defenders of Peace had been founded in

Paris in April 1949 at a huge congregation of 2000 delegates from seventy-
two countries who represented organizations with a total membership of

approximately 700,000,000 persons. Attending the Congress was a delega- ‘

tion of forty Americans, headed by Dr. W. E. B. Du Bois and 0. John
Rogge, former Assistant U. S. Attorney General. both of whom had
served together with Bishop Arthur W. Moulton as co-chairmen of an
American Sponsoring Committee. The Congress elected a Permanent or
Executive Committee of 140 members, including eight Americans. The
central theme and purpose of the Congress was the promotion of peace
activities among the peoples of the world.

The March 1950 conference at Stockholm of the Permanent Committee
of the World Congress was attended by one hundred delegates from ap-
proximately ﬁfty countries. The three members of the American delega-
tion were the famous artist and writer, Rockwell Kent. 0. John Rogge
and the author of this pamphlet.

9'' In addition to Abbe Jean Boulier, many religious leaders endorsed
the World Peace Appeal. Twenty-four outstanding French Protestant
Pastors issued a manifesto entitled “For Peace,” in support of the Appeal.
Eight Italian Bishops signed the Appeal. The General Conference of the
French Rabbinical Organization endorsed the Appeal, as did Cardinal
Sapieha, Roman Catholic Primate of Poland, Monsignor Santin, Arch-
bishop of Trieste, and scores of other religious leaders of every de-
nomination.

A total of some 500,000,000 persons ultimately signed the Appeal.
