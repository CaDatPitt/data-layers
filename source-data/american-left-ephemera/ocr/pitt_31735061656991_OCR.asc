and against everything they are for. You must also make sure

you don’t associate with any Communists. Offhand, this sounds

easy; after all, there are not many Communists around to
associate with. But wait a minute — do you know who all the
Communists are? Of course not; probably nobody does. But
your organization can be condemned because there were secret
Communists in it who exercised some degree of inﬂuence, even
if nobody else knew they were Communists. So, in order to
make sure, you must suspect your friends and neighbors, spy
on them, check up on their pasts, watch to see what they read
and who they talk to, eavesdrop their conversations, tap their
wires, make them sign oaths about what they do and«don’t
believe. And they, if they are not Communists, must meanwhile
be doing the same things to check up on you.

If there were any doubt where this sort of atmosphere leads,
we could judge from the effect of the loyalty-security program
on government workers. It makes people afraid to sign any“-
thing, even though they agree with it; afraid to join anything,
even though they like it; afraid to stand up for their convictions;
afraid to have any convictions. It inhibits collective action and
thereby makes most people helpless, since collective action is
the only way most people can make their inﬂuence felt. Carried
far enough, it could create a nation of political eunuchs who,
being unable to organize to make their own wills effective, would
be easily manipulated by whoever held the power..

AND WHAT is all this for? Is it to “expose” the California
Labor School as an institution which teaches Marxism or has
Communists on its staff ? As the California Department of Edu-
cationireport amply demonstrates, the School has a broad, well
balanced and inclusive curriculum. The School has always wel-

8

 

 

corned capable Communists and non-Communists on its faculty
and has always offered, for those who desire to take them,
courses in Marxist theory taught by Marxists.

But suppose it were an exclusively Marxist school — what
then? When a movement based on a political theory has tri-

umphed in countries which contain a third of the World’s popu- H

lation, and become the largest opposition party in a number of
others, isn’t it about time that Americans who wish to do so
should have an opportunity to study that theory for themselves
and arrive at their own conclusions?

But perhaps Americans should be allowed to hear Marxist
theories only from those who think there is nothing to them?
The great philosophy, John Stuart Mill, would not have thought
so. In his essay, “On Liberty,” Mill wrote:

“He who knows only his owniside of the case, knows little
of that. His reasons may be good, and no one may have been
able to refute them. But if he is equally unable to refute
the reasons on the opposite side; if he does not so much as
know what they are, he has no ground for preferring either
opinion. The rational position for him would be suspension
of judgment, and unless he contents himself with that, he is
either led by authority, or adopts, like the generality of the
world, the side to which he feels most inclination. Nor is it
enough that he should hear the arguments of adversaries
from his own teachers, presented as they state them, and
accompanied by what they offer as refutations. That is not
the way to do justice to the arguments, or bring them into

- real contact with his own mind. He must be able to hear
them from persons who actually believe them; who defend
them in earnest, and do their very utmost for them. He
must know them in their most plausible and persuasive

form...”

 

THE CONSEQUENCES

Despite its tradition of freedom, this country has experi-
enced many outbreaks of bigotry, intolerance and repression.
Yet the right of every dissenting sect or group to teach its own
doctrine in its own schools to those who care to come and listen
has very seldom been questioned. One of the few occasions
when it was questioned was in the years just prior to the Civil
War, when schools in which abolitionist doctrines were taught
were impossible in some states and harassed by private citizens
in others. Yet, not even at the height of the slavery controversy
was it suggested that the federal government could crack down
on a private school because it taught controversial views on the
slavery question.

Remember, the California Labor School is not a school con-
ducted on public money into which little children are herded
by compulsory school laws. It is a school to which mature and
responsible adults go, because it teaches something they desire
to learn. This is the strongest possible case for the freedom of
the institution to select whatever teaching personnel it deems
best qualiﬁed, without governmental supervision, and for the
freedom of the teachers to teach the truth as they see it, with-
out governmental supervision. If these freedoms can be de-
stroyed in this situation, they can be destroyed in any.

If the proceedings against the California Labor School are
upheld by the courts, it will be established as a legal proposi-
tion that the federal government can place any private educa-
tional institution on trial before an administrative board which
is empowered to condemn the institution for its teachings, or
for the ideas and affiliations of its teaching personnel. Courts
and boards are not created to try only the guilty, but to try
anyone who may be accused. If the California Labor School

10

 

 

can be tried, your organization, your school, can be tried too,
if the Attorney General cares to accuse it.

The case of the California Labor School before the Subver-
sive Activities Control Board brings to mind that of the J effer-
son School. In that recent case the same Board, in its “Final
Report and Order,” noted that the Jefferson School had argued:

“ . . . that teaching from a partisan standpoint is not un-
common to educational institutions in that Harvard and
Yale, for example, were founded as Calvinist institutions
and Fordham University trains its students in Catholicism;
but that is not to say that these institutions may validly
be denied their status.”

To this argument the Board replied:

“In attempting the analogy, respondent (the Jefferson
School) omits to say that those religious movements in this
country were not found by Congress to constitute a clear
and present ‘danger to the security of the United States.”

I N PLAIN words, the principle invoked by Mr. Brownell and
the Board could extend _to the closing of Harvard, Yale or
Fordham. And lest anyone think this logic far-fetched, it should
be recalled that Senator McCarthy’s reckless attacks upon intel-
lectuals have frequently centered upon Harvard. In a more
recent andslightly different phase of this general situation, the
New York Times, most respected of America’s daily journals,
was singled out for attack by the Senate Subcommittee of Sena-
tor Eastland of Mississippi. In digniﬁed but ﬁrm reply, The
Times editorialized that it would continue to oppose McCarthy-
ism, witch-hunting Congressional committees, oppressive laws,
racism and bigotry, and would continue to insist “that the true
spirit of American democracy demands a scrupulous respect
for the rights of even the lowliest individual and a high stand-
ard of fair play.”

11

 

Pastor Martin N iemoeller, the famous German Protestant
leader who spent so many years in German concentration camps
for preaching doctrines regarded as subversive by his govern-
ment, wrote of his experiences: C

“When Communists were jailed —I was not a Com-
munist. When Jews were hounded — I was not a Jew. When
union leaders were jailed — I was not a union member.
When Catholics were jailed —I was not a Catholic. When
I was jailed — it was too late to do anything.”

Liberty is indivisible. Because it is indivisible, those who
cherish it must be eternally alert lest enemies steal in and seek
to -divide it. Those who would preserve their own liberty can
'do so only by ﬁghting off division. This is a philosophical, prag-
matic, and practical proposition in which the California Labor
School is historically qualiﬁed to provide leadership. The School,
from the beginning, has never deviated in slightest degree from
its original concept. It will not now. And as the national relaxa-
tion from hysteria grows and spreads, exactly so do the chances
increase for public understanding of the School’s position. Of
the people, Thomas Jefferson said: “Educate and inform the
whole mass . . . They are the only sure reliance for the preserva-
tion of our liberty.” With the people, victory is assured.

THE CASE FOR ACADEMIC FREEDOM

NOW—The California‘ Labor School
NEXT—Thaf Is The Quesﬁon

I N 1945 most of the nations of the world met in San Francisco
to launch a new world organization, the United Nations. On
that momentous and historic occasion, the California Labor
School assumed, at the request of its government, a delicate
and highly responsible diplomatic role. It was designated by
the U. S. State Department as official host to the labor dele-
gates from all over the globe, assembled to contribute labor’s
voice to the deliberations.

The California Labor School was then scarcely three years
old, but its phenomenally rapid growth, its united support by
anti-fascists of right, left and center, its dedication to friend-
ship among nations and the eradication of fascism, its optimistic
enthusiasm toward a new and better future for all mankind,
made it representative of the spirit in which the Second World
War had been fought and the spirit in which the nations were
meeting to chart their common future.

On June 23, 1945, Edward R. Stettinius, United States Sec-
retary of State, wrote to David Jenkins, director of the Cali-
fornia Labor School, expressing “deep appreciation” for services
performed by it during the United Nations Conference, and
adding: -

“Such patriotic and public spirited organizations as you
so ably represent have done much in making the conference
a success, in helping to create a basis for a better under-
standing among the citizens of the United’ Nations.”

A decade later, another federal cabinet officer took quite a
different view of this organization. On March 31, 1955, Attorney
General Herbert Brownell, J r., ﬁled a petition before the Sub-

1

 

versive Activities Control Board asking it to declare the Cali-
fornia Labor School a “Communist-front organization.”

Of course, either a school or a government can change a lot
in ten years. And so it could be that it is the school which has
changed and that the California Labor School which the govern-
ment praised and relied on in 1945 was fundamentally different
from the California Labor School which it sought to suppress
in 1955. It could be, but it isn’t, and Mr. Brownell does not
claim that it is. Instead, he contends that:

“Throughout its existence, the school has been and is.
substantially directed, dominated and controlled by the Com-
munist Party.” (emphasis added)

IN 1946, a division of the California State Department of
Education conducted an investigation of the School to deter-
mine whether it should be approved for students studying
under the G.I. Bill. The investigation was much more thorough,
searching and critical than is customary in such cases, since
the school had already been attacked by one of California’s red-
scare artists, former State Senator Jack Tenney. The School
was approved and a report of the investigation was issued.
When it is borne in mind that the petition purports to state
things about the school which, according to Mr. Brownell, have
been true from its inception (in 1942), and which therefore
should be equally applicable to the time of the investigation on
which the report was based, it will be seen that the petition and
the report read almost like a debate:

 

Mr. Brownell:

FROM ITS INCEPTION the
School has derived its support and
continues to derive support, ﬁnan-
cial and otherwise from and at the
direction of the Communist Party
. . . (emphasis added)

Department of Education:

Reports indicate that the
school has received contribu-
tions from the Rosenberg
Foundation, RKO, the Mar-
shall Foundation, the Colum-
bia Foundation and receives
monthly contributions from
the CIO and AF of L affiliates

 

Mr. Brownell:

The’ Communist Party has
placed its members and re presenta-
tives in active control of the School

. . . The School has conducted
classes to train Party members and
prospective Party members . . .

Oﬂicers, teachers, and other
personnel of the School have been
and are members and functionaries
of the Communist Party, and sub-
ject to its discipline.

Department of Education:

. . . Before the school was ap-
proved, it was thoroughly in-
vestigated and endorsements
were received from many local
chapters of both the CIO and
the AF of L. A large number
of industrial .and business es-
tablishments also endorsed the
school as to its local standing
. . . A number of leading edu-
cators in California, as Well as
state and legislative officials,
recommended the approval of
the school. . .

From time to time the
school has submitted outlines
of their courses in catalog form
which compare favorably as to
objectives and content with
schools accredited by state and
higher educational agencies.

Dr. Holland Roberts, for-
merly of Stanford University
staff, is educational director of
the school and has for the most
part a faculty composed of ex-
perienced teachers who have
received degrees from some of
the best colleges and universi-
ties of the United States. The
names of the instructors, with
their colleges and degrees,
were listed in the catalog.

 

Mr. Brownell:

The School, in its course: has
conformed its teachings of the
principles of Marxism-Leninism
to the interpretation of those
principles made by the Communist
Party . . . Throughout its existence,
the School has never knowingly
deviated from the positions taken
and udvanced by the Communist

Department of Education:

Visitors from this office to

the school have visited various
classes and have been im-
pressed with the sincerity of
purpose of both students and
instructors . . . The discussion
appeared to be democratic with
the instructor stressing no

 

particular point of view.
Party . . . '

Mr. Brownell also charges that “Throughout its existence
. ..the School has supported the position of the Communist
Party concerning the Party concept of the status of racial and
nationality groups in the United States.” The Committee for
Fair Employment Practices (created by President Roose-
velt) in 1946 gave the California Labor School an award for
its outstanding work in “making America a place where all
groups can live together in harmony.”

How is it that the government can put a privately-ﬁnanced
adult education institution on trial for its life, charged in effect
with continuing to abide by the same policies and principles
which, a scant decade before, caused it to be praised, rewarded
and relied upon by that same government? The answer lies
in the Whole story of civil liberty in the last ten years. The
McCarran Act, under which the California Labor School is
attacked, makes clear a signiﬁcant part of it.

WHAT IS THE MCCARRAN ACT?

W HEN THE McCarran Act was passed, President Truman
called it “the greatest danger to freedom of speech, press and

assembly since the Alien and Sedition Laws of 1798.” Professor.

4

 

Zechariah Chafee of Harvard Law School, recognized as an out-

standing authority on freedom of speech, said of the Mundt-.

Nixon Bill (an earlier draft of the McCarran Act) that it inter-
feres “by law with freedom and discussion through organiza-
tions” and “proposes to twist out of all recognizable shape one
of the leading traditions of American life: the possibility of
freely forming associations for all sorts of purposes — religious,
political, social and economic.” A brief recently accepted by
the United States Supreme Court, signed by 360 leading citi-
zens headed by U. S. Senator McNamara, ‘calls the McCar-
ran Act “the most terrible threat so far devised to freedom in
America.”

The McCarran Act pretends to be a registration measure,
but it isn’t because it attaches penalties calculated and intended
to destroy the organization for refusal to register. Destruction
of the organization is thus the end sought; registration is’
merely part of the machinery of one of the alternative methods
for bringing the destruction about. There is a reason for this
indirection. Congress, in the McCarran Act, was attempting
something which it feared would be held unconstitutional, if
done too openly.

Since the McCarran Act penalizes affected organizations
whether they register or not, its essential meaning lies not in
the consequences of registration, but in the kind of conduct
from~which other people and other organizations must refrain
in order to feel reasonable assurance that similar penalties will
not be applied to them. In order to ﬁnd out what this is, we
must take another look at the accusations brought against the
California Labor School.

OF WHAT IS THE SCHOOL
ACCUSED?

THE SCHOOL, it should be noted, is not accused of having
done anything against the law. It is accused of two things only:
policies and associations.

 

This means that the School (as its award from the Presi-
dent's FEP Committee recognizes) is opposed to all forms of

discrimination and segregation. Of course, millions of Ameri-

cans take this position, and only a small fraction of them are
Communists. According to the logic of the McCarran Act, how-
ever, the non-Communists who take it, as soon as they learned
the -Communists agreed with them, should have changed their
minds and come out in favor of discrimination and segregation.

Here’s another accusation:

“The School has supportedthe position of the Communist‘

Party concerning the Chinese People’s Republic.”

The principal planks in “the position of the Communist Party
concerning the Chinese People’s Republic” seem to bethree;
that it should be recognized; that we should trade with it; that
it, as the government actually governing China, should occupy
China’s seat in the United Nations. Again, millions of non-
Communist Americans would agree with one or more of these.

A Quite a few would agree with all three.

Another accusation:

“The School has supported the position of the Communist
Party concerning the Taft-Hartley Act.”

If opposition to Taft-Hartley is to become ideological for-
bidden fruit, merely because the Communists have eaten of it,
how low must the labor unions bow? We have plenty of schools
training “labor relations experts” for jobs with management.
The California Labor School is one of the very few which has
undertaken to train a few experts for the other side. Are we

to have no such schools?

 

 

Still another accusation:

“The School has supported the position of the Commun-
ist Party in denouncing legislative committees investigating
Communism.”

SO IT isn’t safe to criticize a McCarthy, or a Velde, or a Jenner,
or, in earlier days, a Martin Dies or a Jack Tenney. Or, take
Senator Eastland of Mississippi, who is now running around
trying to prove that anyone who favors compliance with the
Supreme Court decision against school segregation must be
subversive. ‘

The new orthodoxy has many planks. You must be against
trade with China, for Taft-Hartley, for segregation, for Mc-
Carthy, for Senator Eastland, of Mississippi, and many, many
more. You don’t even get a chance to be for these things
voluntarily.

The other type of accusation against the California Labor
School is that of Communist associations, exempliﬁed by the
following:

“ . . . a substantial number of the persons who have been
active in the management, direction, and supervision of the
School, including office-holders and those not holding office
therein, have been active in the management, direction and
supervision of, and as representative of, the Communist
Party.”

If you think this charges something deﬁnite and speciﬁc,
read it again and a little more slowly. How many persons con-
stitute “a substantial number” ? What does “active in the
management” mean in the case of persons “not holding office” ?

In order to feel reasonable assurance that the penalties of
the McCarran Act will not be applied to your organization, you
must not only be for everything the Communists are against,
