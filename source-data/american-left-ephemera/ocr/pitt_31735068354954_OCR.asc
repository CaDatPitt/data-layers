DENVER——Mine—lVlill members will vote Tuesday,
October 30, on five proposed amendments to the Interna-
tional Union constitution submitted to referendum «by,
recommendation and approval of the 1962 convention in

Toronto. , Covered by separate propositions in the union- ‘
wide ballot are constitutionalchanges dealing with con-
vention dates and places, the number of International
officers and board members, reorganization of the dis-
tricts, per capita and minimum local dues, and revision
of -the wage structure for International officers and staff.
“All are proposed to strengthen your Union and your
benefits as members of Mine-Mill,” the International offi-
cers said in a special letter mailed directly to the rank

 

7

The letter, signed by President Clark, Vice-Presidents
Howard and Skinner, and Secretary-Treasurer Dichter,
urged “all members to support these five propositions by
voting fyes’ on each one . . . to consolidate ‘our Union,
conserve funds and provide the necessary income to
operate the Union effectively._”. - - I I

Never has -the membership been so informed on
propositions they are asked to vote on than in this~ref-

erendum.

. An ‘exact copy of I the
sample referendum ballot
was reproduced in the last issue
of the Mine-Mill Union paper.
Since then, copies of the sample
ballot have been mailed to each
member on the Union mailing
list, along with the letter from
the officers explaining the pro-
posals to be voted on. Posters
of the sample ballot have been
sent to each local union for
mounting on plant‘ bulletin
boards, around the union hall
and any place else where the

A ‘ members can study the issues

themselves well in advance of
the time they vote by secret
poll. , V‘ .

Locals have been urged to put
out their own material on the
referendum, and many have

done _so.
.  a’:

EVERY area" local leadership
meeting held since the referen-
dum date was announced ‘a con-
ple of months ago has gone on
record in favor of a “Yes” vote
for all five amendments.

Such action was taken at the

‘meetings of Utah local leaders

Political Action Work Nears VoteCIimax

DEANVER——Mine-Mill locals in

9 key voting areas set their sights

on the November general elec-
tions as registration and get-out-
the vote drives approached their
climax in political action work.

On Nov. 6 the union’s mem-.

bers in 28 states from Alaska
to Georgia will be involved in
the election of ‘some 20 gover-
nors, 21 U. S..Senators, 75 U. S.

. Representatives and hundreds

of state legislators plus county
and city officials.

As in the past, the union’s po-
litical influence will be impor-
tant in many contests. In sev-
eral areas of Mine-Mill mem-
bership concentration, particu-
larly in the Southwest. and
Rocky Mountain states, this vote
is expected to be decisive. .

As the Mine-Mill Union went
to press toward the end of Oc-

detailed discussion of state con-
stitutional amendments going be-
fore the Arizona electorate on
Nov. 6.

Prof. Rod Hastings of the Uni-
versity of Arizona addressed the

tutional amendments discussed)

being uppermost in the minds of

the state’s voters.

ter of the Arizona Association of
Realtors on No. 103 and Hector
Morales of the Tax Assessor’s
office on No. 200. Pima County

‘ seats between regular elections

ment“; for No. 102 to allow new
residents in the state to vote for
U. S. President and Vice Presi-
dent; and for No. 103 dealing

mended against No. 100 which
would deny constitutional rights
to elect the state’s government
in case of disaster; and against
No. 200, relating to taxation, be-
cause the legislature and state
tax commission already have

District 2 Delegates Outline
Legislative Goals, J ob Action

TUCSON, Ariz.-——The Committee on Employment, appointed by Executive Board
Member Maclovio Barraza at the District 2 conference in Tucson, October 5-7, prepared
a significant report outlining legislative objectives and a program of job action.

The report was approved unanimously by the conference. . _

Committee chairman was Stan Loader, Recording Secretary of Bingham Open Pit

Miners Union, Local 485
it 9% it

LEGISLATIVE objec-
tives outlined included:

The 35-hour week, increased
duration and amount of unem-
ployment compensation benefits,
retraining pro gr a in s, federal
legislation to halt discriminatory
hiring practices, shifting tax
burdens to an ability-to-pay ba-
sis, an expanded public works
program, action under the anti-
trust law against pricing poli-
cies of the copper trust, an in-
ternational lead-zinc commod-
ity agreement.

Also urged was a go-slow
program on tariff cuts author-
ized by the recently passed so-
called “Trade Expansion Act.”

THE section on job action
read in part:

“We can and we will make in-
creased and more effective use
of the trade union forms of
struggle against company pro-
grams that sacrifice people to
profits.

“We don’t try to restrict the
introduction of improved ma-
chinery. We do seek to minimize
adverse effects on employment,
wage rates and working condi-
tions. . . . A number of points
should be watched for by every
local union, every day. We have
to be alert to every change in
machinery, equipment, W 0 r k
methods and job assignments,
and then immediately act on
every one of the f0l10wing_prin-
ciples that might apply:

0 “WE will examine every
change to see if any unsafe or
burdensome working condition
has been created. _

0 “We will resist by every

possible means the excessive,

cuts,-in the ‘crew that companies

always impose any time they
install a more productive de-
Vice.

0 “We must begin to explore
the question of writing into our
agreements provisions on crew
consist and manning scales on
many operations to prevent
overloading of duties.

0 “Speedup, whether through
job elimination, job combination
or just plain whipcracking, has
to be resisted on the job itself,

by a determination not to jeop-

ardize our health and safety,
and by a concerted refusal to
giveto the companies more
than a fair day’s work reason-
ably due.

0 “Where changed methods

or new machinery are installed

and the safety factors and work-
ing conditions do measure up to
proper standards, we have the
duty of mainta-ining the purchas-
ing power of working people to
offset the increased productiv-
ity.

0 “WE will fight against com-
pany attempts to downgrade
jobs as the result of changes.

*0 “Besides the general insist-
ence on the sharing of the bene-
fits of greater efficiency, we
need to be sure that job rates
are upgraded to compensate for
the increased responsibilities
and greater skills required by
new machinery or job combi-
nation.

mously adopted the committee
report» calling‘ on the member-
ship of District 2 and the entire
International Union to vote
“Yes” forpassage of all five
constitutional am,endments.

‘ The resolution also urged each
local in the district to setup
“pass the referendum commit-
tees” and take the organiza-
tional-steps necessary for assur-
ing passage of all the issues on
the ballot. ,

Linked with this action was
the conference declaration on
defense of the union which de-
nounced the legal attacks
against Mine-Mill - and went on

_ record to support its leadership

in every way.
SIC Ill IR
AMONG the defense commit-

tee’s recommendations adopted
for action were visits by local

union delegations to political 1

candidates and incumbents ask-
ing they urge the President and
Attorney General to stop the
harassment of Mine-Mill and its
leaders».

The conference also called on
all locals to make regular
monthly contributions to the un-
ion’s defense fund.

ON political action, the com-
mittee report adopted by the
delegates emphasized mobiliza-
tion of the membership to vote
in the Nov. 6 general election
for labor-minded candidates and
cooperation with other unions to
get out the vote for endorsed
candidates. Education of the
members on state constitutional
initiative issues was also
stressed. —

Major campaign issues in the
general election were outlined in
the PAC report, which suggested
they be discussed with candi-
dates.

First was administrative ac-
tion to stimulate jobs

Underscored, too, were: aged
medical care under social secu-
rity, federal mine safety legisla-
tion in non-ferrous metals, fair
employment ‘practice and equal
pay for women laws, and a con-
stitutional amendment to abol-
ish poll taxes.

DICHTER emphasized the im- ’

portance of passage of all

. amendments in the Oct. 30 ref-

erendum to strengthen the un-
ion, tighten its organizational

-structure, provide adequate fi-

O nances and continue the high

levelof servicing to the mem-
bership.

The delegates, after much
discussion, voted unanimously
to support all five propositions
and pledged to work to get the
amendments passed in their re-

E‘.  gspective locals.

On political action, they con-
curred in the recommendation
of the Montana Mine-Mill Joint
Legislative Committee that each
local pay 10 cents per member
during December and January
for legislative work. Fonk and
Int’l Rep. George Kalafatich
led the discussion.

=l=’ll'l¢

AMONG the major endorse-E

ments made by the meeting on
political candidates were:

Arnold Olsen for re-election to
Congress from the western dis-
trict and Leo Graybill for Con-
gress from the eastern district;
Robert Durkee for State Auditor
and Hugh Adhair for State Su-
preme Court Justice. (See other
endorsements in round-up PAC
story, Page 1.)

Following a report by Rask
on labor unity, considerable dis-
cussion was held on the subject
with the unanimous conclusion
of the delegates being that talks
with all unions in the industry
be expedited. :

1311!’!

IN the discussion on union de-
fense, Skinner pointed out that
the legal harassment of Mine-
Mill is part of a general attack
against all unions reflecting the
constant anti-labor drive by em-
ployers.

Jack Harris led a discussion O

on the industry job situation, in
which all the delegates par-
ticipated.

DAVID BENNETT, Local 392,
Magna, Utah: The five consti-
tutional amendments on the bal-
lot arise because they were
brought to the convention as
resolutions by delegates from 10-
cals which recognize the need
for them. I only want to im-
press upon all Mine—Mill mem-
bers the tremendous importance
in the passage of all five
amendments to be able to carry
on and advance our Union.

STANLEY WENHAM, Lo cal
593, Buffalo, N. Y.: I urge sup-
port for the per capita increase
for sound trade union reasons:
our dues are among the lowest;
our gains are among the high-
est while our officers and staff
are the lowest paid; the in-
crease will build a substantial
strike fund, raise our local in-
come, and give our Union the
funds needed to do an even bet-
ter job for our membership.

 

L; C. BOLIN, Local 735, Clev
land, Ohio: When we’ve got a

Union like ours fighting for
equality in all its affairs and on
the job, the wise thing is to give
it the financial support it needs
to keep up that fight. Let’s all
go for the per capita increase
to the International. It will be
the most profitable investment
our members could ever make.

      

STEVE TROSKO, Lo c al 837,
Carteret, N. J.: I attended the
last two International conven-
tions where per capita was dis-
cussed. I am convinced of the
need for raising our Internation-
al Uni_on’s revenue. When we
are facing problems with more
grievances from speedup and

automation,’ it is our. responsi-
 bility —to strengtlien - the —. union ..

WILLIAM THOMAS, Local 531,

have always stood ready to help
the International in any way
that was asked because we
know how much the union’
means to us. We are for the per
capita increase, and better pay
for our officers and staff who
serve us. You have to put in to
get. Putit in your union and
let's do a job.

 

OTTO GROSS, Local 124, Ruth,
Nevada: I- only want to say
this: the executive board of
Ruth Miners Union Local 124
supports all the issues in our.
Mine-Mill referendum vote on

JOHN INFUSINO, L o c a l 365,
Perth Amhoy, N. J .: Our Inter-
national Union gives service and
leadership superior to that giv-
en by any other union I know
of. A per capita increase is
needed to continue the -high

level of our work. I am sure I
speak for the executive board
of Local 365 when I pledge we
will do everything possible to
show the membership the need
for increased revenue.

 

JAMES RUSH, Local 552, Stam-
ford, Conn.: Mine-Mill is one of
the few Unions that submits
questions like this for the full
membership to decide. We are
all proud of this democracy.

Great Falls, Mont: Now that
the Int’l Board is taking econ-
omy measures, I feel allthe
Propositions deserve the sup-
port of every member . . . espe-
cially 4 and 5. In Local 16, this
would mean $1.50 dues increase,
75 cents to the International and
-75 cents to the local. This is
needed to strengthen both the
local and International. I
support all. five amendments.

 

JOE DISPENZA, Local 485,
Bingham Canyon, Utah: Local
‘485’s officers and membership
urge all members of the Inter-
national to vote “Yes” on all
five constitutional amendments.

The entire union’s welfare is‘

the only issue we must consider.
If we are to continue to operate
our union on the same high level
as in the past, all these changes
in the International constitution
must-be made.

FRED SANCHEZ, L o c a l 937,

of my local, I speak in support

JAMES PINTA, Local 758, Chi-

this country has a harder work-
ing and m ore effective, but
lower-paid, group of officers
and staff. I say every member
should support the per capita
tax raise for the International
so that the leaders we elect to
Serve and represent us can be
more f a i r l y compensated for
their untiring efforts on our be-
half.

JOE SCRUGGS, Local 632, In-
dianapolis, Ind.: The members
of my Local 632 have discussed
the importance of raising our
dues and increasing the per
capita to the International Un-
ion. We have gone on record to
support a “yes” vote in this
referendum because we know

that a per capita increase is
‘vital to have our_Union do a job.

for everyone we represent.

REGINALDBEAVIS, Local 1,
Butte,‘ Mont.: All the proposi-
tions should be accepted in their
entirety if our union is to con-
tinue the benefits we’ve become
accustomed to. Prop. 4 is espe-
cially important. More money
is needed for the program
ahead, including our bill in Con-
gress for voluntary early retire-
ment A to build our strike

increase. Vote “Yes” for all.

J. B. CHAVEZ, L oc al 501,-El

bers realize the need for in-
creasing per capita. We passed
it by 2 to 1 in the last:referen-

SALT LAKE CITY, Utah—-“Pass the Referendum’?
committees involving hundreds of rank and file leaders in
seven Utah-Nevada locals were on the ball last month

rallying the membership for a big “Yes” vote on all five .

constitutional amendments in the Oct. 30 referendum.

Their activity was moti-
vated by a sense of mutual
responsibility to the need for
approval of the five propositions
as “a single ball of wax” to
strengthen the International Un-
ion and make it more solvent.

While a down-the-line “Yes”
vote was the over-all theme,

‘particular emphasis was being

given in «special leaflets and let-
tersto ‘Kennecott local mem-
hers-in the Utah-Nevada area
regarding the close link between
the measures to increase per
‘capita and raise the pay of In-
ternational officers and staff.

Leaflets distributed in the var-
ious’ Operations compared Ken-
necott wage rates between. 1945
and 1962 unde‘r=‘-‘Mine-Mill con-
tr'ac'ts‘. I ‘ ‘ " I .

the announced retrial of the T-II

makes no sense at all, in view
of the fact that this (affidavit)
section of the law, upon which
the case was based, was re-
pealed over three years ago.”

The letter termed 10 years
of harassment by government
agencies against Mine-Mill’ a
“stupid waste of time‘, money
and effort which has resulted

“came as a complete surprise
to us.”

“We had the right,” he de-
clared, “to assume that the re-
versal of the original conviction
by the U. S. Federal Cir cu i t
Court of Appeals in D e n v- e r
would relegate this conspiracy
case to the legal scrap heap
where it belongs.”

He stated flatly:

“There never was a conspir-
acy as charged and no official
of this union ever engaged in
any such conspiracy. The whole
procedure has been a vengeful
persecution of Mine-Mill.”

“The non-Communist affida-
vit section of the Taft-Hartley
Act, which the defendants‘ were
charged with conspiracy to vio-
late, was repealed three years
ago,” Clark pointed out. He add-
ed: “From the time of its pas-
sage until its repeal, it was con-
sidered by many a stigma upon
our American democracy. To
think that the Department of
Justice would revive a case
based on a law which no longer
is in existence is an outrage to
our understanding of justice.”

_ ‘ “DURING the past 10 years,”

he continued, “our Union has
been subjected to the‘ most bru-
tal legal prosecution ever ex-
perienced by any labor organi-
zation in the country. We can
only conclude that today’s ac-
tion is continued legal harass-
ment for harassment’s sake.”

repudiations of similar charges

INDICTMEN.-TS in the case,

charging. conspiracy to defraud
the government through viola-
tion of the Taft-I-Iartley act,
were first handed down in 1956,
but it was three years before
the defendants. were brought to
trial in late 1959 at a time when
Mine-Mill was in the middle of
a 61/2-month nation-wide copper
strike.

Charges against two of the 11
defendants who stood trial were
dismissed by trial Judge Alfred
Arraj for lack of evidence. They
were Asbury -Howard and. Jack
C. Marcotti. The remaining nine
were convicted on Dec. 17, 1959,
and their case was appealed.

On March 5, 1962, the U.S.
Federal Circuit Court of Ap-
peals in Denver reversed the
conviction of the nine, ruling
they had been improperly tried
and convicted‘.

The Court dismissed the in-
dictment against Chase Powers
and James Durkin because of
insufficient evidence’ and voided
the conviction of the other seven
on the grounds that the key
testimony of a principal govern-
ment witness was hearsay, had
no connection with any of the

defendants. and was inad-

missible.

ARIZONA MINES are escaping their fair share of the Arizona
property tax burden, according to University of Arizona Professor
Rod Hastings in a recent article appearing in the magazine Arizona
Frontiers.

He says, “with regard to ‘mining property the League [of Ari-
zona Cities and Towns] found that [assessed] mining valuations

have been going down relative to either production o_r net income,” 

and this trend has tended to throw an increasing share of taxation
onto other property groups.” Referring to the industry’s much
vaunted changeover to highly mechanized plants, the report re-
marked that “from inspecting valuations for smelters~[-a’nd"1nills]
. . . one would conclude that virtually no capi ‘" ’
been made. . . . i

“The conclusion’ is inescapable that the ba
property assessment has been discriminatory if
to place the burden on . . . utilities and city
improvements. . . . The additional burden o -_  ,
evitably have tended to be passed on to consumers through in-
creased rates.”

E. A. MORGAN, U. S. Bureau of Mines Suhdistrict Supervisor from Phoe-V;
nix, Ariz., addresses District 2 conference Oct. 5. Seated. left is Board g

Member M. R. Burruzu who chaired conference.

These reports are being used by
local unions.» “Most of our mem-
bers,” Stuart said, “are seeing
for the first time what a compe-
tent, impartial agency can do to
uncover unsafe conditions and
point the way to their correc-
tion.” — ,

He characterized the typical
state mine safety program as
g r 0 s sly under-financed, gov-
erned by outmoded laws
and regulations, inadequately

- staffed, and all too ‘frequently

influencedby political and com-
pany pressures.

Stuart said the_ recommenda-

tions of the Secretary of the In-
terior to Congress next year, as

‘ called for by Public Law 87-900,

would have a vital bearing on
mine safety legislation to be
considered in 1964. The law di-
rects the Secretary to submit a
report of his findings, together

with recommendations for an ef- -

fective mine safety program.

Stuart said he felt the current
survey by the Bureau of Mines
of safety conditions and of state
mine safety laws and their ad-
ministration could pnly point to

the urgent need for permanent

federal mine safety legislation.

In Mine-Mill States,

Voting Time-off ‘Laws,
Register Dates Listed

Twen-ty—nine states have . laws protecting Workers
against penalty or loss ofwages if they take time off the
job to vote in the general election this November 6.

Nineteen of these are states in which Mine-Millmem-

bers live. They are: Alabama,

Colorado, Illinois, Indiana,
Iowa, Kansas, Maryland,
Missouri, Nebraska, Nevada,
New Mexico, New York, Ohio,
Tennessee, Texas and Utah.

According to AFL-CIO’s
Political Memo, the laws vary
in each state. Most, however,
provide that an employee who
is an eligible voter can take
time off to vote if he submits
prior notice to his employer.
A Most of these laws also im-
pose penalties on employers for
failure to comply.

Meanwhile, since this issue

Alaska, Arizona, California,

of the Mine-Mill Union is going
to press early enough, it is
worthwhile reminding Mine-Mill
members in seven states that
they can still register for the
November election.

Here are the states and their
general election registration

Alabama, Kansas and Ne-

’ braska—0ct. 26; Iowa--Oct. 27;

Utah—0ct.. 30; Idaho—Nov. 3;
Alaska—Nov. 6 (same day as
voting).

In Texas, where there is no
registration, payment of poll tax
is evidence of voting eligibility.
