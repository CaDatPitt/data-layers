LOOK WHAT HE’S DONE TO
INDOCHINA

Nixon was elected President after promising
to end U.S. involvement in Vietnam with a
“secret plan.” But where is that plan?

thousands of North and South Vietnamese
have died in Indochina.

O LOOK WHAT HE
OUR HEALTH, EDUCATION, WEI-Fl

Nixon’s health plan seeks only to regulate the
health insurance industry and not to meet the
crisis in health care delivery.

Nixon has recommended that Medicare
hospital benefits be sharply reduced.

Nixon twice vetoed bills to increase federal
funding of our schools, including tens of
millions to aid disadvantaged children.

Nixon vetoed the landmark comprehensive
child development bill.

Nixon’s demagogic call for a law to limit the
courts’ power to enforce the 14th Amendment
is an unconstitutional attack on civil rights.

political dissenters. Congressmen, newsmen,
clergymen and union officials have also been
subject to surveillance.
