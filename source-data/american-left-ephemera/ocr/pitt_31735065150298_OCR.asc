American people and to -prevent the possi-
bility of a serious recession. ‘ A T

urged a continued fight against “right-to-Work”
laws in the states. » '
Public power and flood control were strong-

ation of the high dam at Hell’s Canyon, -as
well as all legislation necessary to -fully de-

ment in the great Northwest and other areas.
Also included in the broad legislative pro-
gram were: support of a bill on school ‘con-

Another convention action emphasized the’

New Anaconda

CHRISTMAS, A Ariz.—Another
unorganized mining property
came under the banner of Mine-
Mill in a major Labor Board
election victory March 27 at In-
spiration Consolidated Copper
Co.’s new underground Christ-
mas mine here. Inspiration is
a subsidiary of the Anaconda
Copper Company.

Although only approximately
70 men are presently employed
in development work at the new
copper property, the company
estimates the work force will be
in the neighborhood of 300 men
at peak production by 1959, all
within the bargaining unit of

the election. A new mill__ar'1d

- In a smaller separate elec-
tion for which the AFL-CIO
Operating Engineers union
had filed a “carve-out” peti-
tion, the vote was three for
Mine-Mill to one for the op-
erating Engineers. As a" re-
sult, this unit becomes partof.
the single over-all Mine-Mill
production and maintenance
unit. While this small voting
group included only three
hoistmenand a bulldozer op-'

the men themselves whowanted
our union to represent them de-
spite the fact that only develop-
ment Work was still in progress

forat least another. year.

At the National Labor Rela-
tions Board hearing on Jan-
uary 8, 1957, the company
argued against an election
on'the ‘grounds that "they were
‘not yet in production.‘ Mine-Mill
argued that the Christmas mine
was not a new company but an
_expansion of Inspiration’s min-
ing operations‘ at, Miami, Ari-
zona. The NLRB ordered the
election on the groundsthat the
men should have the opportu-
nity to Vote on whether. they
wanted to be" represented by a

ERNEST SJ OMAN, presi-

Union No. 1—A per capita in-

ent time is essential for the
following reasons: Continual
expansion program of the
union; to increase wages of
staff members and organizers
to meet with the increase of
wages on industrial jobs where
these men come from; the
present building program of,
our International Union head-
quarters; the rising cost of

——We realize that the boys on

delegates to support a per cap-
ita increase. I’m convinced
that we should have this in-

GIVE REASONS
Twenty-four out of 26 dele-

‘ gates who spoke on the per

capita resolution supported the
50-cent increase for a variety"
of reasons. "Their arguments for
increased international u n i o n
income were:

’ . ‘ I
I. To successfully’ carry out
the program ofincreased union
service and new organization
now under way in the union
since the signing of the three-
year agreements, additional in-
come will be necessary. The
program cannot be achieved on
the basis of the present balance
between income and expenses.

2. A union administering mil-
lions’ of dollars in contracts,
health and welfare programs,

bership benefits is a big busi-
ness and these gains would be

‘ endangered by false economy.

3. The real evil is that the
uni.on dollar, like everybody’s
dollars, is worth less than _it
once was and the cost of run-
ning the union has increased
tremendously because of infla-
tionary raises in travel fares,
hotel rates, telephone and tele-
graph and telephone tolls, sta-
tionery prices, printing costs,
the cost of all union supplies,
and other items.

4.. Mainly, the need for more
income arises from the pro-
gram adopted at the conven-
tion which will strengthen Mine-
Mill’s positionas the dominant
union in the non-ferrous metals
industry. The principal features
of this program are:—

0 Continuation of the program
of new organization ‘which al-
ready has resulted in such vic-
tories as the Labor‘Board vic-
tories at San Manuel_and Christ-
mas, Ariz., and the rechartering
of old _local unions in‘Utah and
Northern Michigan.

0 Increased service from the
International Union in griev-
ance and arbitration work, edu-
cation, research, health and wel-
fare programs, legislative and
political activity, community re-
lations, publications, and wage-
rate studies. ’
0 A new union headquarters
will be necessary to increase the
efficiency of the International
headquarters. Present leased
headquarters will bedemolished
in the near future.

5. Canadian autonomy has
meant the refunding of a con-
siderable portion of per. capita
collected from locals in that
country. The Canadian section
is now paying all of its own ex-
penses and salaries. But this
means considerably less income
from Canada for the Interna-
tional union. ‘

6. None of the increase in ex-

the labor movement. 7

In short, the delegates de-
clared, the future growth and
stability of the union depends
upon increased income, modest
though the half-dollar increase
would be.

cial -secretary, Morenci (Ariz.) '

per- capita "increase for our
International Union is badly
needed, if we expect. to. con-
tinue to get the services that

WILLIAM DUKE, president,
Western Mechanics Union No.
709, Los Angeles, Cal.—I’think
the per capita increase is long
overdue. Our officers and
staff do need an increase, and
it seems silly to-try to oper-
ate, on the same old amount
of money we did a few years
ago when the over-all costs to
operate the union have ‘in-
creased so much. Also, with
the planned expansion of the
union’s activities in organiza-
tion, research, legislative work,
education and health, safety
and welfare, it stands to rea-
son that more money for the
International is necessary.

A. C. THOMAS,. president,

-—Because of the increased
‘cost of operating, organizing

Telles Wins

EL PASO, Texas——The Ray-
mond Telles People’s ticket
made a complete sweep of the
El Paso city.election March 2,
electing Telles Mayor and _an
entire city council.

 

A Telles is the first Mexican- T
American to be elected Mayor

of El Paso. He was supported
by a labor-veteran coalition with
support also by, many social and
fraternal organizations as well
as by the Scripps-Howard El
Paso Herald-Post. --

‘ _ The role of the El Paso Mine-
Mill Council was recognized as
outstanding, with Smeltertown
turning out 98 per cent of the"

_ total’ registered vote and a count

of ’288 for Telles to 29 for in-
cumbent Mayor Rogers. Other
districts with Mine-Mill member-
ship Voted equally high as, for
example, one which showed
more than 1,200 for Telles to 49

for Rogers. , ,

 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
    
 
 

DEAD—Ray lee, former Interna-
tionalgrepresentative and veteran
member of Butte Miners Union
No. 1 died in Butte during the
St. Paul convention. Brother lee
was also a former Montana state
representative. The convention

   

stood in silence‘ in tribute to the,
well-known trade unionist who
began a career of hard rock min-
ing as a youth in the 'I',ri-State

area.

 

 

PAUL MANESS, president,

Coeur d’Alene (Idaho) District

Union No. 18-1 feel that the
50 cent per capita increase is
a- must in order to strengthen
Mine-Mill’s position as the
dominant union in the non-
ferrous metals industry. Also
so that the International Un-
ion can carry out its program
on legislative action, giving
more assistance .to legislative
programs such as in Idaho in
our fight against right-to-Work
and Other, anti-labor laws, and
to get progressive legislation
passed that will help labor.

TOM JONES, president, Step-
toe Mine & Smelter Union No.
233, McGi1l,'Nevada—I believe
all locals should support the
raise in per capita in order to
continue the progress we have

rnade up to this time and makes

us stronger in the years to
come, We made a lot of fine
plans at this convention. VVe
need the additional money to
carry outthese plans.

 

BRYANT KELLY, president, ’

Jackson (Miss.) Fertilizer &

‘Chemical Workers Union N o."

867-I believe the per capita
should be raised for the simple

reason that, we’ve had in-.'

creases in pay and other bene-
fits for several years, and it
costs the International offi-

rcers and representatives as

much to live as the men in
the plant. I don’t ‘believe that
we could be good union mem-

'bers and fight against an in-

crease in per capita tax.

ROBERT BEY, president,
Chicago (Ill.) Amalgamated
Union No. 758——I feel that the
entire membership should vote
for the per capita increase.

-This Will enable the Interna-

tional office to meet the in-

creased costs of running the

union and expanding our ac-
tivities the way the convention
voted.

C. A. BICKERSTAFF, presi-
dent, Carlsbad (N. M.) Potash
‘Workers Union No.‘ 415—We.
back the per capita increase
with the understanding that it
will be used to increase the

contributing funds in addition

DISTRICT 6 WORK

An outstanding example of
civil rights activities by local
unions was contained in a re-
port to.the ‘convention by dele-
gate William Morton, secretary
of the District 6 Civil Rights
Committee and vice president of

Morton reported that the lo-.
cals of District 6 had established
their district-wide civil rights
committee over a year ago with
Int’l Rep. Edward Coleman of

;9iConvention Urges Eke to Use Powers  
VV f’To Enforce Hgh Court Civil Rights Edict

 

Stamford, Conn. as chairman
and including representatives
from locals in New York, Con-
necticut, New Jersey and Mary-
land. Since establishment of
the district committee, .he said,
practically every local has been
carrying on political -action in
civil rights, -meeting with state
officials on legislation, sponsor-

" ing and lobbying for bills in the

legislatures, distributing leaf-
lets, collecting ‘contributions and
fighting Jim Crow where they
found it.  _
Last October, qlvlorton said,
Committee chairman, Coleman
visited the Montgomery and

, Birmingham areas of. Alabama
accompanied‘ by‘ Vice’ President

Howard, reporting back to all
locals in the district. ' V"

Morton also referred to an

" excellent printed leaflet put out

for mass distribution by the
District 6 Civil Rights Commit-
tee, entitled “Civil Rights
Mean-s Human Rights,” which-
was contained in the delegates

kits.. The-V leaflet traces the his-

tory7.'of the civil rights fight

, since the" American Revolution-
and makes the point that civil".

rights .is a. national and Ameri-
can problem, not just a south-

ern or Negro ‘problem. It also

outlines a number of ways in
which locals and _. individual
members can advance th.e cause‘
of civil rights on the job and in
the communities. ‘ j 5

DENV_ER——Press reports‘, of

V charges that “threats of physi-

cal violence” weremade against
“western delegates” to the re-
cent 52nd Mine-Mill convention
in St. Paul, _Minn'., were an-

 ‘ swered last week in a special

letter from ‘the four interna-

’ tional officers toevery delegate

who was present.
.The press stories cropped up

. in a few places around the west

and quoted Rex Pollock,’ Kel-
logg, Idaho, Local 18 delegate,
that James Buck of Local 51,
candidate against Board Mem-
ber Chase Powers in District 7,
and Roy Martin, also of- Local
'51, had been “threatened” with
physical attack by “staff. mem-

f ..bers” and others who were
_. supporting Powers and Vice-

President Orville Larson. ‘Lar-

and Buck "were nominated, by

’ SENDCOPIES ,

_.Reproductions of the "stories
were sent to each convention
delegate by the International
“We are
sending them so you can com-
pare these stories with your
own experience and observa-
tions as_ a convention delegate.
The facts of the‘ convention as
you observed.them_are the best
answer to the fantastic charges.

‘The stories themselves are full

of contradictions which ‘will be
obvious to 7 anyone who .reads

them. We believe they "speak for‘

themselves regarding the mo-
tives of the individuals who are
quoted," as well as the news-

papers which give them space.”
DELEGATES REPLY

Supporting the officers’ re-
ply, the other five delegates of
Local 18, Pollock’s. local, ‘tele-
graphed international .head-
quarters denying Pollock’s ac-
cusations and his published
claim that he was the only
delegate to live up‘ to the local
union instructions on nomina-
tions for board member and.in-
ternational officers.- They .said
that the local at.noV time, had
instructed the. delegates on‘ this.
Said the wire: “Statements that
any‘ delegate was "denied. his
rights or threatened in any way
at any time‘ are.‘ completely
false, and could only be planted
‘by an enemy ‘who desires, to
harm‘ the ‘union and its mem-

bers.:’ The ‘five delegatesiwere

Paul Maness, Harry Roe, Lu-
ther Church, Rudy Hanson, and
James Daugherty. V ' -« 
From an unexpected source
came another A reply to the
charges. It was an articleby
Sam Romer,’ Twin Cities corre-
spondent for Business VWeek, ‘a
Wall " Street publication. ‘Said
Business. Week: “Loyalty, and
solidarity, were shown on all
convention piss u_es
leadership and policies. . . .
Thereis little question of the
union’s power in the “industry.”

Mill “showed no signs of weak-

-ness ‘at its annual convention.

He pointed out that there has
been no continued federal re-

said, 1941 was the last time
any authoritative publication

was. made on the subject, by the
Public Health Service. The Bu-

He said he had also gone
with Clott before the House

to the 52nd convention.

delegates referred the whole
question of higher tariffs
and relief for the industry to

the International -Executive
board ‘for serious study and
recommendations.

Acting on a resolution pro-
posed by U. S. Senator George
W. Malone (R., Nev.) in his
speech before the convention,
the delegates adopted a state-
ment declaring that despite the
union’s past oppositionto higher
tariffs “we are prepared to re-
examine the entire question of
tariffs and its effects on the in-
dustry.”

DEBATES AUTHORITY

‘Malone proposed that all tar-
iffs be set by theTariff com-
mission instead of by the" Pres-
ident, that the 1934 Trade Agree-
ments (reciprocaltrade) Act be
killed by‘ allowing it to expire
in June of 1958, and that tariffs

‘ on imports be set high enough

to-- deprive foreign producers of

their advantage of low "foreign .

wages.

A major section of Presi-
dent", Clark's report dealing
with an analysis of the indus-
try was under consideration at
the time that the Senator ad-
dressed the convention. ‘ It
was in the context of‘ both
lVIalone’s speech and Clark's
report that the delegates
adopted a position .-stating:

Democratic Leader Lauds

ST. PAUL, Minn. —— Highest
praise for Mine-Mill's leadership
ability and effectiveness in legis-
lativeactivity was given to the
52nd convention by.Arnold Ol-
sen, former Attorney General
of Montana. .

The youthful, attorney, who
_was the Democratic candidate
for governor of Montana in last
November's elections, _told the
delegates that during this ses-
sion of the Montana legislature
“Mine-Mill showed itself to be
made of great leadership.”
“Mine-Mill was carrying the
ball,” he said,’ “Mine-Mill was
leading the parade because
Mine-Mill knew and was expert
in this field oflegislation.”

“The gains in Montana by"
this kind of program,” he
said, “were the greatest gains
experienced in industrial ac-
cident compensation in the
history of the act that dates
from 1915.” ‘ ,

~ WARMLY RECEIVED

Olsen, the youngest "attorney
general in the state’s history,
-was elected to that office in
1948 at the age of 32 and served
as Montana’s highest legal of-
ficial for eight years until this
past January. He was recently
retained by the Montana Mine-
Mill locals as special legislative
representative. An eloquent and

Our Legislative Work I

“They save money for manage-
ment and save lives for labor,”
he. said. 1

“In Montana,” he said, “we.
had the experience of showing
the ‘legislature that though the
dollar benefits paid injured
workers were about half the
dollar benefits paid in the state
of Oregon, the cost of insurance
premiums against industrial ac-
cident was actually higher in
Montana, thus the more ade-

less expensive. The answer is
that the greater benefits in Ore-
gon, reflecting greater value on
workers’ lives, promoted better
safety programs, fewer acci-
dents and less severe injuries.”

HIGHER VALUES

“As we improve the industrial
accident and disease programs,”
he continued, “we place higher
vaues on the feet, hands, eyes
and lives of workers. As fast
as we increase these values, in-
dustry practices greater ‘safety

saves industry money because

the program saves them the ef-

their skilled workers.”
“No matter which way you
look at‘ it,” Olsen said, “as
you. place greater value on

.men’s lives by higher bene- .

fits in industrial accident in-

decrease and the-cost of the
insurance against accidents
will also decrease. As we

Issue eferred to Board ‘ i.

_ . ST. PAUL,‘Minn.——Reconsideration of Mine-Mill’s tra- ,
ditlonal opposltlon to tariffs as a means of protecting our
members from foreign imports was voted by the delegates

. _ In a policy statement on the uncertain economic con- 1
d1t1on of the non-ferrous metals lndustry, the convention _I

to protect the wages and
of .our members.”

“We recommend,” the decla-
ration said, “that this proposed

jobs

resolution (by Senator Malone) _

be referred to the Executive
Board for their consideration
and study, and that any final

recommendations made by the-I

Board be circulated throughout
the International Union.”

VOTE THANKS

The convention vbted further’

to thank Senator Malone for‘-the
forceful manner in which he-
pictured the plight of the non-
ferrous metals and other indus-
tries in which wages and work-
ing conditions are being threat-
ened by competitive imports
from foreign operations, many
of them owned by American
companies seeking to take ad-

vantage of‘ cheap labor and‘

more favorable tax rates.
Malone, one of the few Re-
publican ' Senators.-who voted
against the Taft-Hartley bill in
1947 and supported President

‘ Truman’s veto of the bill, de-

voted muchof-his speech at the
convention to “an attack on the
1934 _'_l‘rade ,Agreements Act
wh1‘ch,,he"said, “was designed to
put the ‘sweatshop’ labor of
Europe and Asia in direct com-
petition with American work-
lrrgmen.” '
CONSTITUTION ISSUE

That Act, he declared, “in ef-
fect amended the,Constitution
without submitting it to the
people.” He called "for a return

"‘to the Constitution of the Unit-

ed States in the regulation of
foreign trade and the national
economy” by letting the Act die
when it is due to expire next
year. ‘ This, he said, would re-
turn to Congress its authority
and responsibility of regulating
foreign commerce. ' .
The convention position on
Malone’s proposal stated:
“We note that Senator Ma-‘
Ione’s resolution will‘ not au-»
tomatically impose higher tar-
iffs on ‘products of this or
other industries but will con-
fer authority upon the Tariff
Commission, as the agent of
Congress, to impose such
higher duties as may be re-
quired to equalize the effects
of lower wages in foreign
countries on American pro-
duced goods.’{ '

HALF FINISHED
An education simply supplies
the patterns-—the rest is up to
the individual.

0 Speakers at the convention in-
cluded International Vice-Pres}
dent “Orville Larson, Interna-

tional District 7 Board Member,

Chase Powers, Canadian Parlia-
ment Member James Byrne, and
three fraternal delegates from
the Scottish Area of the Na-

tional Mineworkers Union who

travelled 6,000 miles to come to
Kimberley. The Scottish Miners’
delegates were President Abe
Moffat, Executive Officer Joe
McGowan and Pit Man Willie

‘ Bannerman.

Mine-Mill Int’l Rep. Tom Mc-
Guire ‘of California was also a
guest of honor. , _ “ ‘f,

.'I‘he convention heard and
acted on the report of the Cana-

. dian officers presented by Pres-
ident Thibault which led off

with a review of the greater-
ganizaiional strides made by

Mine-lVl'ill in Canada during the.

last year.

‘Names of places previously
unknown to the delegates now
became real as the homes of
new Mine-M ill local unions
across the 4,000-mile width of
Canada, testifying to the new
strength and influence of the
union in Canadian life.

ORGANIZATION
The report on new organiza-

’ tion stated: “,The fact that these

organizational gains were made
despite the resistance of the em-
ployers. raiding and disruption
byfthe Steel Union and the use

. of legal tricks by governlment‘
. ‘boards proves that the program
_ of the‘ union has been effective.-
. It proves that our policies of"
_-~ .‘--{inner union democracy, Cana-

 

dian autonomy and militant ac-
tion have been correct.” The re-
port outlined a perspective of
further expansion and "growth

of the union by organizing the

unorganizedin the expanding‘in-
dustry. . - ’ —

A review in the officers’ re-.

port of the economic situation
noted that gains made inbar-’
gaining last year were greater
than in any year since—1952. In
view of still rising living -costs,
the reports recommended that
“substantial wage increases be
sought in 1957.” ‘
‘ JBARGAINING

The bargaining program unan-
imously adopted by the gon-
vention also includes the estab-
lishment of week-end punitive
‘pay, early retirement on full
pension, paid sick leave and the
winning of "major improvements
in health and safety provisions.
- In the section on labor unity
the officers’ report disclosed de-

tails of. exploratory talks which‘
have taken place between Mine-’

Mill Canadian officers and of-
ficers of the Canadian Labor
Congress on the question of
Mine-Mill’s reaffiliation with the
Congress.

The delegates, by unanimous
standing vote, approved a reso-
lution endorsing the stand on
labor unity advanced by the of-
ficers’ report——to continue fur-
ther discussions with the View
of -achieving labor unity on the
basis of ' re-establishing Mine-
Mill's ‘rightful place has a labor
organization within the Con-
gress, an entire organization
with its rightful autonomous
jurisdiction over miners, mill-
men, smelter and refinery work-
ers’ and service trades.

Also endorsed by the conven-
tion Was the legislative section
of the officers report and the
outlook for increased activities
embodied in it.

The report pointed out that '

legislative activities of the union
111 1956 were conducted on a
wider scale than ever before,
with ‘ briefs presented at all
levels of government including
the Territorial Council of the
Northwest Territories, and the

Yukon Territory Council. “These

legislative activities are to’ be
extended. even more in area
and broadened in scope," the re-
port said. ' g ' - '

More than 100 resolutions were
submitted to the convention by
locals and auxiliaries.

June Deadline
On Disability

WASHINGTON, D. C.;i\/line.

Mill VVashi,ng_t‘on3 P.epre.s',entative‘

Herman‘ Clott has issued a
warning to workers in the_in-
‘dustry regarding disability pro-
visions in the Social Security
law, New legislation providing
for‘ total and permanent disabil-
ity goes into effect this June,
but many workers are not aware
of the provisions or application
procedure necessary to protect

the rights of the permanently,

disabled.

Clott pointed out that failure
to file an application for total‘
disability» benefits before June

could mean loss of disability pro-

tection to those entitled to it.
It could alsomean loss of rights
to old age and survivor's insur-
ance benefits, ‘not only for the
disabled workers, but for their
families in the future. A

knows it all seldom wins an ar-
gument.  _ I

Resolutiogns  

 

"STI PAUL, Minn;—f‘The lead-
ers of this union hold no brief
for communism,‘ the Communist
party or its program.” , -

That is the official, clear
andunequivocal _posi_tion of the
International» Union of, Mine,
Mill and Smelter Workers. It
was again stated in a resolu-
tion adopted bythe ~52nd»con-
vvention affirming the position
already taken by the Interna-
tional Executive Board. ’

The convention resolution,‘
quoting the Executive Board,
also declared:

“We are opposed to all
‘forms of dictatorship, includ-.
ing the communist, and we
stand as always for-the elim-
ination of all attacks on free-
dom of thought and civil.

Hunga1'y‘,-.'South Africa.o1_' the
public schools, buses, mining,
camps and factories of our
own, United States. We be-
lieve in and are devoted to
the American democratic "sys-
tem.” . ‘

The . resolution ‘pointed ‘out
that th‘e.Taft-Hartley law pro-
hibits communists from holding
office in any local or interna-
tional union, that both our In-
ter-national’ and_ local unions
have complied with the Taft-
Hartley law and that “any.ex-
tension of the, provisions of this

Ask S-ACB to Strike
Eckert Testimony  

WASHINGTON, D. ‘C.-—-Shortly after the news deadline for
the current issue of the M me-Mill Union, General Counsel Nathan
Witt made a motion before the Subversive Activities Control '
board here that testimony against the union by Kenneth Eckert,‘ I
perennial informer, he expunged from the record. _ _ " ’

Former Gov. Francis Cherry, who is conducting the hearingsfil
communist-infiltrated, had'- note;
ruled on the motion at press time. , .  V 

. ‘The motion declared that inconsistencies and contradictions,
in Eckert’s statements were perjurious and that all of the UAW=,
organizer’s testimony should be strickenas Worthless. _ _ __ . , .

g It was" pointed out that major contradictions were 1no'ted in 
Eckert’s current‘ testimony -' as compared with ‘his testimonyl

jagainst the unionin six earlier appearances before Congressionali I S
committees, court trials,,and~befo're the CIO.- A specific ‘-pattern‘
intEckert_’s testimony is thathe would place certain Mine-Mill!
figures at-a given’ “cornmunist” meeting on a given date. -In testi-
mony‘ -on other occasions, however,ohe would omit the namesof 
to relate who had attended the.  

 

\/\.'\/\/\/\,

On one occasion,‘ for example, he placed Mr. Witt. at a cer-_  .';j-«
tain meeting, when on other occasions he did not name Mr. Witt ' .
when testifying about the attendance at the same meeting.‘ This 
was similarly true‘ in the case of Clinton Jencks. A . — S ~

.Also, the motion declared, Eckert’ named Vice-President As- _
bury Howard, Intl. Rep. Jesse Van Camp,'and one-time organizer_"7' 
James Durkin as communists for. the first time. in «the: SAGE
hearings when he had never mentioned them, on six‘ pre'vious‘oc-
casions while testifying against the union.’ Eckert has offered
long lists of alleged communists in Mine-Mill totvarious investi-
gating committees, etc., but this is the first time that thenames‘
of the three men have been includedin such lists. H i .

L Anotherwitness last week was Mrs. Phyllis Henryof Denver
who, according to press reports, testified with a. straightﬁjface
that “you had to be a member of the Communist party” ].to be
an officeworker for Mine-Mill. She was referring to the period J
of 1942.and 1943. What she didn’t say was that James J. Leary _,
was then secretary-treasurer of the union.’ Leary is now a sub- ,,, 
regional director for the AFL-CIO. None of the officers o_f~Mine- 
Mill at that time are now connected with the union. . ‘ ; ’ ‘

“This is not an attack- against _

a" group‘ of -individuals,” there-
solution said, “but rather a ‘di-
rect attack against our " union
and all it stands. for, with the
objective’, of weakening M and de-
stroying it, iffpossible.” -4 ‘  '
The ‘ convention. went on_ rec-.

ord “in support, both financially »

and ‘morally, of the fourteen
brothers who are now under-the
indictments,” to give the same
support “‘to any of our Union
brothers who may be indicted
in the future. for the same or
like cause,” ‘and to continue. the
fight to repeal? the Taft-Hart-7?
ley, Brownell-Butler and “any
other laws that will endanger
our rights as established by the-.
_ V United
States.” ' * ‘ ~
--  _'DI_SCUSS PROBE
f— V Another resolution adopted by
the,‘ ‘convention called it “un-
fortunate” that the AFL-CIO
Executive Council"s first reac-
tion on the McClellan Commit-

tee investigation was to. take" a-

position on the Bill of Rights
and Fifth Amendment “which
is defensive and a serious step
backward in the fight to main-
tain our constitutional -liberties.”

The resolution noted that, “.\lI1
answer to; many protests, the
AFL-CIO Council has already
foundit necessary "to clarify its
position by- stating that no "la-
bor unionofficial should bere-
moved from office simply?.be-

ca_se he uses t'he‘5th 'Amfend- .

ment, and by also stating that _ .
