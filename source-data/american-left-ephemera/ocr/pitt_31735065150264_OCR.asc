CHICAGO—-That the International‘ Union of Mine,‘ I

Mill and Smelter Workers and its members throughout ‘a

the United States will measure the newly-elected 86th
Congress and the various state legislatures by the results

they achieve was established here last month by the

union’s’ International Executive board. _ V
Before recessing in order to meet jointly with the’

Mine-Mill Canadian Executive board in Toronto, the IEB '
spent several days one full ‘agenda which included the.

drafting and approval of a 1959 legislative program, prep-

arations for the March convention in San Francisco, 
increased support for the Inco strike in Ontario, and the;

upcoming collective bargaining with the major sections

of the industry t ear. Another IEB session was sched- 0, 
further convention .-  

uled for Jan. 15 and 16 in Denver-for
and bargaining planning. »

Legislative activity in the coming year was upper-A j

most in the minds of the officers and board members and

the job was tackled with new enthusiasm created by the ; _:
union’s remarkable achievements in the November elee-  » 1

tions and the improvement which the voters made in both
the national and state legislative bodies. Any tendency.
of lawmakers to ffbreathe easy”. now that they have

been elected will not be tolerated if the scope and content  3

of Mine—Mill’s program is any indication.
PROGRAM ‘

For the‘ new Congress which opens this month, then.

Executive board drafted a program which includes rec-

ommended legislation on the non-ferrous metals industry,  I

labor, the national economy, taxation, education, housing,
social security, unemployment compensation, power and ~
natural resources, civil rights and liberties, agriculture, ,
and the admission of Hawaii to statehood.

On the state level, the board recommended that local 7

unions take advantage of newly-created opportunities to i 

improve state laws affecting the membership, and their

communities as a whole. The board said the union intend- - -

ed to press for a program including improvements. in," ,§;.£-f
unemployment compensation, workmen’s compensation,. ,  

industrial safety and health, taxation, and education, and -

the _repeal of anti-labor legislation. — .

Raid; Agree to Pact:

BULLETIN!

LOS ANGELES,"Calif.—-
Hailed as the “best settlement
in brass this year,” an agree-
has been reached here between
Mine-Mill Local 700 and Re-
vere Copper & Brass Com-
pany. (See details in late story
on Page 11.) _

(Special to Mine-Mill Union)

LOS AN GELES, Calif. —- It ,

was slaughter on Slauson
avenue here Nov. 25.

That’s when a combined raid
by _ AFL-CIO’s two largest
unions on Mine-Mill Local 700
at Revere Copper & Brass
company was smashed. Mine-
Mill trounced Auto and Steel
together by nearly two to one
in a single-unit NLRB elec-
tion at both Revere plants in
Los Angeles and Santa Ana.

A third big AFL-CIO union
also involved in the raid, the

~ Boilermakers, pulled off the

ballot a week before the elec-
tions to avoid disgrace similar
to that suffered by the Steel-
workers who were completely
skunked. Nqtjeven their elec-

tion observers voted for the
Steelworkers.
FAREWELL

Thus almost ‘a. year of

harassment by the Auto and‘

Steel disorganizers was
brought to an end when the
Revere workers voted over-
whelmingly to bid the raiders
goodbye. L
Official election results were:
MINE-MILL LOCAL

700 .............................  90 I
UAW AFL-CIO .......... .; 55
STEEL AFL-CIO ........ .. 0
NONE ............................ _. 1

There were no challenged or
void ballots. Interest in the
outcome was so keen that
every man on the job election

day voted, 146 out of 150
eligible.

Despite the relatively small
size of the unit, the UAW-Steel
raid campaign was geared in
staff and propaganda concen-

tration as though ten times as .

many workers were involved.
No horses were spared by the
raiders in their attempts to
sway the Revere membership

V against Mine-Mill.

Both the UAW and Steel

brain-trusters boasted about

their unions’ multi-million dol-
lar treasuries, and dipped into
them liberally. They called
meetings, they visited homes,
they poured out a flood of

If the election results had‘_i—h~

been determined by the‘ num-fl

ber of leaflets put out, the e

UAW would have won hands 2’

down. Revere workers were
deluged with UAW leaflets of

from one to three pages every t 5‘

day, sometimes even more.

THE MINE-MILL UNION

j tensified on all fronts as the
 deepened depression in lead

 and zinc began to be felt
 copper as well. By the time
 .the'85th Congress convened in

“‘J§1_nuary the unemployment
o;blem‘was being front-paged
a_"national'crisis. The down-
. w'ard“slide of the general econ-

orny further aggravated the

- metals situation.

’ - Meeting at the beginning _of
the year, the International Ex-
,'ecf,utive board outlined a re-

 néwed attack by the union on

unemployment in our indus-

. tryi This blueprint was then

1 .-hammered into a multiple pro-
gram of action for all levels
by the delegates to Mine-Mill’s

"53rd convention in March.

’ Byoth events charted the course

that was to keep top officers,
‘staff and local unions busy for
the rest of the year.
CONVENTION

I The ‘March convention itself
celebrating 65 years of Mine-

 Mill history, was a declaration
.* or strength and ‘confidence in
‘the union’s future. Organiza-

tion, legislative and political
action, ‘expanded servicing of

 the locals, and continued

growth of Mine-Mill's prestige

 ‘as the most powerful voice of

workers in the industry were
attested, to in every phase of
: the convention proceedings.
This was evident in the un-
precedented number of mes-
sages received from members

of Congress, the Senate, gov-

‘- ernors’ mansions, state offi-

 cials, other unions and civic

~~ {organizations in communities
1 where. Mine-Mill me in b e r s
work and live. It was appar-
ent in the kind of guest speak-

METAL CRISIS
With tariff commission rec-
’“ ommendations still pending as
the» new Congress convened,
the union began anew its cam-

' paign to dramatize the plight

of the industry's workers,

 D'g for emergency legis-
  on or White House action

ggo relieve the metals crisis.

 Top Mine-Mill officers and

»-the union’s Washington repre-
sentative met in January with
, Secretary of Labor James P.
Mitchell and his assistants to

fdiscuss the problems of unem-

_ployment and mine safety and
health.

7 At» the same time locals

‘ throughout the union were mo-

bilized in the continuing ﬁght

for jobless aid, including the

release of federal surplus food

I commodities, and forremedial

‘action to ease the metals
crisis.
A VICTORY
On April 24 the commission
finally issued its report to
President Eisenhower, unani-
mously ‘agreeing that there

. was serious injury to the do-
 mestic lead-zinc industry, but

" split evenly on what to do

f_’abou't»it., Once more the union

TEN TONS OF FOOD (above) was collected by United Electrical union locals in General Electric plants in

Canada for the Mine-Mill International Nickel strikers in Sudbury and Perl Colborne. (See story on"

Page I).

the metals crisis first.arose in
June when leaders of the In-
ternational Union converged
on Washington. Vice President
Orville Larson, speaking for
the union, testified before the
Metals and Minerals subcom-
mittee headed by Senator

James Murray of Montana and-

backed new plans to stockpile
lead and zinc as well as the
program for stockpiling cop-
per proposed by Secretary of
the Interior Fred Seaton.

The union’s program was
further advanced during the
month by a busy round of talks
held by the Mine-Mill officers
with members of the Senate
Minerals and Metals commit-
tee and other senators and
congressmen as well as with
Interior Secretary Seaton him-
self.

July saw a‘ race to get the .

Seaton bill through Congress

after it had been passed by the ,
Senate and approved by the

full House Interior and Insu-
lar Affairs committee. On July
18 the International Executive
board addressed a communica-
tion to every member of the
House urging passage of the
bill as a minimum step in the
right direction. Similarly, mes-
sages from Mine-Mill locals
throughout the country poured

‘into Washington. Nevertheless,

with a majority of Republicans
voting against it, the bill was
defeated in the House by a
vote of 182 to 159 and Con-

gress adjourned shortly there '

after.

The issue was then placed
squarely before the Eisen-
hower administration in a
statement signed by Mine-
Mi1l’s top officers. who called
on the President himself to au-
thorize some immediate relief
of the industry.

IMPORTS CUT

On Sept. 22 President Eisen-
hower announced a sharp cut
in imports of lead and zinc
under a“-new quota system. It
was the first definite remedial
action to take effect in Mine-
Mill"s long fight for federal
assistance in saving the jobs
of the industry's workers. ’

The union,
quick to declare that while the
government's action might be
expected to provide some slight
relief in metals, the basic prob-
lem of achieving an adequate
long-range minerals program
still remained, and that Mine-
Mill would be back before the
86th Congress battling for
just that.

At the turn of the year cau-
tlous observations ,were noted
on. signs of improvement in
the non-ferrous metals indus-

try, the most -optimistic note 1

however, was

follovving indications of a pick
up of business and increase in
employment in several mining
areas.

SILICOSIS
A major objective of Mine-

.Mill’s long fight against sili-

cosis was also won in 1958
when it was disclosed last
summer that the most compre-
hensive investigation of the
dread disease in metal mines
ever launched by the govern-
ment had been started by
trained field teams of the US.
Bureau of Mines and the Pub-
lic Health service.

In breadth and scope the
joint study, still in» progress,
is actually the first investiga-
tion gof its kind ever under-
taken"by any Federal‘ agency.

Another direct result of
Mine-Mill activity in Washing-

ton during the year was the

inclusion of a special appro-
priation to step up and in-
crease the scope of the sili-
cosis investigation begun by
the Mines bureau and Health
service. ’ V
POLITICS

The union’s broad program

of political action, projected.

early in the year by the con-
vention delegates, was effec-
tively pursued more energet-
ically than eve_r by our mem-
bership in state and local pri-
maries where Mine-Mill's po-
litical weight was felt in key
congressional races, guberna-
torial contests and high state
posts. .

Results of the ‘general elec-
tions on -Nov. 4 showed that
our members and their local
political actioncommittees did
a job. In every state, county
and - district where our. union

has strength they produced're- ‘

stilts for the candidates whom
they had endorsed." Most not-
able of these were the results

‘in ‘Montana (where not only

were. Mine-Mill supported. in-

- cumbents re-elected with rec-

ord pluralities, but" two Butte
miners, including ,Int’I Rep.

‘Maurice “Sonny”. Powers, won

seats in the state legislature),
Arizona, New Mexico, ‘Utah,
Nevada and Idaho. 9

Mine-Mill played a decisive
part as well in the fight against
right-to-work propositions in
those states where they were

_defeated on the Nov. ballot,

especially inldaho where the
votes of Shoshone county, the
home of Local 18, made the

-difference between victory and
defeat of the union-busting.

measure. Earlier, Montana
was the only state in the nation

to defeat the “wrec ” proposi- —

tion by keeping it off the..bal-
lot altogether because of in-
sufficient ‘petitions.  ~ .. -

CONFERENCES

All of these fields of activity
were given direction and ad-
vancement through special dis-

trict and area-wide conferences

of rank and file local leaders
who gathered to assess prog-
ress and plan further applica-
tion of the union’s program
during the year.

Major sessions included: the
California state-wide confer-
ence at San Francisco in
February; several meetings of
the Arizona Mine-Mill coun-
cil; the second annual confer-
ence of District 2 locals in Ely,
Nev., in September;
September, the political action
conference in East.Helena of
the Montana Mine-Mill Legis-
lative committee, and the New
Jersey area dinner of Mine-
Mill local leaders in Carteret;
the joint political conference
of New Mexico Locals 890 and
415 in El Paso in October; and
the annual District 6’ Educa-
tional conference held Oct. 24-
26 in New York City.

BARGAINING

Special meetings of the vari-
ous bargaining councils were
also convened during the year
to consider counter-actions

against intensified drives by.

the major company chains to
cut costs at the expense of
workers’ jobs and established
working conditions. Among
these were joint meetings of
the Anaconda ' locals in Mon-
tana, special sessions of the
Kennecott and Phelps Dodge
councils and area meetings of
the AS&R council.

The year also marked com-
pletion of a whole series of
highly successful regional con-
ferences conducted by the
Mine-Mill Research depart-
ment on health and welfare.
Led by Research Director Ber-
nard W.’ Stern and Insurance
Consultant Paul Pinsky, the
coast-to-coast series wound up

"« at Ansonia, (John, in February

with the biggest meeting of
any held during. the five
months of area sessions.

Altogether, approximately 80
local unions sent over 450 rank
and file delegates, some trav-
eling hundreds of miles, to the
21 I-I&W conferences conduct-
ed by the International Union
throughout the United States.

SUPERIOR

Labor history was made in
Arizona on Jan. 5 when Mine-
Mill International President
John Clark installed the char-
ter of the first local union. ever
to represent Magma Copper
company workers in the firm’s
46 years of mine, mill and
smelter operations in Superior.

“   Mill’s fight for jobs in-

ivties

history was completed in June
when M a g m a management
signed its first union contract
with Local 938, ending nearly
a half-century of open-shop
domination by this major cop-
per producer over its workers.

In.July, Mine-Mill Local -4115
won bargaining rights for
more than 200 production and
maintenance workers at the
Duval Sulphur & Potash com-
pany mine in Carlsbad, New
Mexico, defeating the AFL-
CIO Stoneworkers and the Op-
erating Engineers. The Stone-

 

workers had ’held the Duval '

contract for two years. Earlier
in May, an attempted raid by
the Stoneworkers on Local 415
at the International Minerals
& Chemical Corporation mine
was clobbered by two to one.

A combined raid by the AFL-
CIO’s two biggest unions, Auto
and Steel, on Local 700 at the
Los Angeles and Santa Ana
plants of Revere Copper &
Brass company in November
was also smashed by nearly
two to one. The Steelworkers
were completely blanked in
that election.

INCREASES -
The last money dividend un
der Mine-Mill’s 1956 three-year
contracts went into effect,July
1 when all workersxin the bas-
ic sections of our industry re-
ceived automatic boosts aver-
aging more than 7 cents an
hour in general wage and in-
crement increases. '

On April 29 Mine-Mill's of: -

fiees were moved from rented
space in the ‘Tabor building to
the newt headquarters pur-

. chased by the union at 941 E.

17th ave. in Denver.
Defense of the union placed
high on agendas of Mine-Mill
rank and file meetings and
conferences throughout the
year as_ the membership ral-
lied with demonstrations of

moral, organizational: and fi- 1

nancial support for its leader-

ship under attack. The gov-

ernment held no further hear-

ings on the SACB case which ’

remained stalled on dead cen-
ter pending a high court ruling

on FBI _records of stoolpigeon -~

witnesses. Under appeal was
the second conviction of for-
mer Secretary-Treasurer M. E.
Travis whose first conviction
was set aside and a new .trial
ordered by the Circuit Court
in Denver on the ‘grounds he
had been. improperly convicted.
A new element in the second
appeal was the startling reve-
lation in October that Fred
Gardner, a key witness against
Travis, was a deserter from
the U. S. Army and had re
peatedly lied under oath in his
testimony.

Another year passed without
“conspiracy” charges , against
the fourteen Mine-Mill defend-
ants coming to trial. While
the drive for defense funds
was gathering steam through-
out the union in anticipation of
a scheduled trial in January,
1959, the trial was again post-
poned until Sept. 21, 1959. This
will make it almost three years
since the date of the indict-
ment.

Mine-Mill’s position was com-_
pletely vindicated and an end
was finally written to the
Jencks case when, at the be-
ginning of 1958, the Depart-
ment of Justice announced it
would not attempt a second
prosecution following the his-
toric decision of the Supreme
Court of the United States

which ,set aside Jencks' con-I

viction.——S.

President Clark:

Bargaining Tops Mine-Mill’si
Big Agenda for the New Year‘.

ALL OFTHE ingredients for a very happy

new year for Mine-Mill members and their
families will be present in 1959. What We do
with those ingredients is ‘what will spell the
difference between a “happy” year and just
any old year.

Coming up in the months
ahead are some very im-
portant i t e m s: collective
bargaining on our new con-
tracts with major sections
of the nonferrous metals
industry, the San Francisco
convention, legislative work
in connection with the new ,
Congress and legislatures, 9
new organizational cam-
paigns, the 1959 referendum  -. .-
on officers and constitutional amendments, in-
creased health and safety work, and improved
educational activity. .

Although the amount of work facing us at
the beginning of each new year seems stagger-
ing, Mine-Mill does manage to Win its share
of prestige, strength, and important gains with
each passing month. Somehow, the work gets
done, the contracts signed, the new properties
organized, the legal victories achieved, the raids
beaten off, the elections won, the bills passed
or defeated, as the case may be. Somehow, the
lot of Mine-Mill members is improved.

All this is done not with mirrors, but with
hard work, as every local union leader and
International staff member knows. It is heart-
ening to be an officer "of such an organization
as this. An exemplary reason is the Inco
strike in Canada. Here we had about 75,000
people to feed, clothe, and keep warm. The
response of our union and the entire Canadian
labor movement has proved again that labor
takes care of its own. ~

diminishing “conspiracy” case, now set for

Second of.Politica1 Show  

Will be Opening   of Congress  

HIS month the men and women we elected
to Congress and the various state legisla-
tures take office. The people we selected" for
the county court houses and the state capitol
terms-——many of
them new careers. The con- ~- ‘
stables, the peace justices,
the town clerks, and the vil-
lage commissioners again
take on the ‘job of protect-
ing and representing us.
This is called the demo-
cratic process and it has
happened many times in
the past. For better or
worse, we have selected our
stewards, so to speak, and
it’s up to them to give us
an accounting when their terms are up.

‘ But this is the point: It isn’t just up to
them; it’s up to us, too. Believers in democracy
cannot afford to be cynical about “politicians.”
We can’t afford to feel that aside from voting
for candidates there’s nothing much we can do
about them. “Go tell city hall” is an expression
in American life that has come to mean that
politicians will do as they please and it won’t
do us much good to complain because they.-are
the “bosses” and we are the poor‘ suckers
they're victimizing. 7 ~ .

anything they proved the American people,
the average Joe and Jane, do not feel "that
politicians can escape forever" the judgment

do about the public officials who fail us——and
the Novemberpelections showed what it was:“
We can retire them to private life if they are
tried and found wanting. _

average American. He dislikes being promised

OThe 86th Congress must
correct the failure of its pred-

rates. We also point out that a

struction industry.

McCLELLAN ’

I In a separate action, the In-
ternational Executive
adopted a statement on _the
McClellan committee and the
Kennedy-Ives bills and simi-
lar proposed legislation. The
statement reads:

It is generally recognized
that this International union
adheres, to democratic proced-
ures under a democratic con-_
stitution and is free from any
taint of racketeering or cor-
ruption. We are none the less"
opposed to the continuation of
the McClellan committee and
to the enactment of the Ken-
nedy-Ives bill or similar legis-

.. ‘ lation regulating the internal

affairs of unions.

Although the McClel1ani
Committee ‘may have served
some purpose to date, we be-
lieve that the Committee has
outlived its usefulness and_ has
in fact become a danger to the
labor movement as a whole.
By exposing and. dramatizing
the misdeeds ofa few officials
in a few unions, the commit-
tee has succeeded in giving
the impression that the whole
labor movement .or a good part

of it has been -taken over by

crooks and racketeers. This
has given rise to many far-
reaching anti-labor proposals

' having no ' bearing on racke-
teering and has weakened‘ la- ~

bor’s position as a whole. We
therefore think the commit-
tee should be abolished. *

I(EN‘NEDY-IVES
The Kennedy-Ives bill is one.

of the products of the atmos-

phere which the McClellan
committee has generated. The
fact) is that its provisions
which deal with internal union
procedures are. no guarantee
against racketeering. Only an
alert,_ active,‘ and informed’
rank - and - file can guarantee
honest and devoted leader-

ship and the democratic work-
ing of their unions. Under the .

guise of making the labor
movement, more honest . and
democratic, the Kennedy-Ives
bill will take a long step to-
ward the regulation by gov-
ernment of the internal affairs

Charter for

HELENA, Mont. — Fortified
by the tremendous success of
Montanalabor unity which re-
sulted in the recent election
victories and earlier defeat\of
right-to-work in their state,

. the Montana Building Trades

council here last month re-
newed its call on national AFL-

I CIO to charter Mine-Mill as an

affiliate of the merged federa-
tion. L

A resolution adopted by the
state group urged that “every
possible legitimate effort be
made” to bring the Mine, Mill
and Smelter ‘Workers union
“into honorable affiliation with
the AFL-CIO, to the end that a
more fully united front in the
ranks of organized labor may
be welded together for the in-
evitable battles that lie ahead.”

The resolution was ad-
dressed to the AFL-CIO’s
Building Trades Department,
parent body of the state or-
ganization, and the leadership
of the AFL-CIO itself. A simi-
lar effort was urged to bring
the Teamsters union back into
the federation.

EXAMPLE

Noting that the defeat of
the right-to-work initiative pe-
tition in Montana last July had
attracted nation-Wide attention,
the resolution declared: “This
temporary success against an-
ti-union forces was made pos-

r~-zsible through the coordinated

efforts of all branches of or-
ganized labor, the Farmers Un-
ion". and other groups of citi-
zens and businessmen.

“This coordination of effort
must be greatly perfected and

} ‘enlarged upon, if Montana is

to remain free of the curse of

THE MINE-MILL -UNION '

Washington Column

Democratic Council Erecfs
A New Congress Guide Post

WASHINGTON, D.C.—It is
only a few days before the
opening and organization of
the 86th Congress.

With the election of two
Democratic senators and one
representative from Alaska,
Democrats now have the
greatest majorities since the
height of the New Deal. But
with election victory comes re-
sponsibility and this first ses-
sion of the 86th Congress will
demonstrate just how respon-
sive -will be the candidates
who campaigned in November.

The Democratic National committee,
through its Advisory council, has offered a
program to its members in Congress _as a
guide post. In past years this same Advisory
council also set forth a program with which
on the whole labor could find little fault. But
the carrying out of such a program through
the enactment of the necessary legislation was
another matter. More often than not the coali-
tion of conservative Republicans and the Demo-
crats from the South thwarted attempts to pass
much needed welfare legislation. Speaker Sam
Rayburn of the House of Representatives and
Majority Leader Lyndon Johnson of the Sen-
ate, both Texas Democrats, have stated that
they are not bound by the program of the
Advisory council and that as legislators they
are free to follow their own dictates. Never-
theless, any program which comes out of the
Democratic National committee must have its
impact on -the men from that party in Con-
gress. In addition, the 86th Congress will write
the record for the Presidential and congres-
sional campaigns of 1960.

MAIN ISSUES

The program of the Democratic Advisory
council begins with the issues which are most
near the people's hearts———peace and economic
stability. The statement calls for international
cooperation among all governments with an
understanding among all peoples and a prac-
tical and realistic attempt to reduce disarm-
ament among all governments. ‘At the- same
time the Advisory council , realizes that , not

only adequate arms but, more important}. the

raising of living standards in the backward
countries of the world is equally important
to the maintenance of peace. The council calls
for a rededication to these objectives with a
reshaping of our foreign policy to attain the
above two goals.

On the question of economic growth at
home, Democrats are evidently not scared off
by the label of “spenders.” Citing population
increases and the need for a continuing grow-
ing economy, the council calls for governmental
assistance wherever necessary to stimulate our
economic growth and, at the same time, for
preventive checks and balances against in-
flation.

Civil rights and education also are impor-
tant points by the Council’s standards for the
Congressional agenda next year. Despite the

Matter of Law

NE of the issues most important to labor
which will be coming up in the new Con-
gress is the repeal of Section 14(b) of Taft-
Hartley. This is the provision which leaves it

open to the states to outlaw union security,

clauses, thus paving the way for the anti-
union “right-to-work” laws. Taft-Hartley other-
wise permits union security except the outright
closed shop. Although some states had adopted
“right-to-work" laws before Taft-Hartley, Sec-
tion 14 (b) encouraged their spread. Arizona,
Utah, and some other states where Mine-Mill
has members, are included in the states with
such laws.

No good reason has ever been advanced
why the states should retain the power to act
on the subject’ of union ‘security as distin-
guished from all the other matters covered by
Taft-Hartley. Section 14(b) was put over un-
der the banner of state-rights. This is the
same banner which is waved in many other
cases. There are important reasons why this
IS so.

Even before the abolition movement got
started early in the 19th century, the slave-
holders and other reactionaries were exploiting
the state rights doctrine in demagogic mammer
in order to halt progress and to hold on to their
privileges. As Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr., says
in “The Age of Jackson,” these elements
“hardly" espoused the state rights doctrine
“for the benefit of the common man."

ND this has always been the significance

 

pressure of the Southern wing
of the party, the national com-
mittee understands that the
Democratic party can be suc-
cessful only if it meets the
threat of violation of the Su-
preme Court ruling. The coun-
cil also calls for additional
powers to the Attorney Gen-
eral to protect voting rights
and to use civil injunctions
against those who would de-
~prive citizens of their right
to vote. Note is taken also of
the challenge to our country
in the closed schools of the
South and the effect such closed schools will
have on our growing youth.

PROCEDURES

The first job suggested by the council is an
improvement in Congressional procedures so
that decision can be made by a majority after
reasonable debate without a filibuster by a
minority in either house of Congress. This
should mean, of course, at least in the Senate,
support of the move by Senators Douglas,
Humphrey, and other to amend Rule 22 dealing
with unrestricted debate.

In education the call is made for a Federal
scholarship program, school construction, as-
sistance to states for vocational education, and
continued aid to areas with great Federal
installations and impact. ,

The council also calls for liberalization of
immigration laws, improved and enlarged
hospital construction, social security improve-
ments with provision for medical care to pen-
sioners, improved widowbenefits and increased
public assistance and child welfare aid. Small
business and the farmer also come in for
special attention by the Advisory council.

Conservation, hydro-electric and atomic re-

source development, rural electrification coop-’

eratives, community facilities, low and medium
cost housing and area development all receive
support in the program. The program makes
special note of the area redevelopment bill
vetoed by the President after, the last session
of Congress»; I
Taxatign E is

movement proposes, that is,

LABOR A . .. j ~
On labor, the Council calls -for repeal of
14(b) of the Taft-Hartley Act and broadening
the minimum wage law to $1.25 with additional
coverage to 10,000,000 more’ workers. Also the
council again asks for the enactment of the
Kennedy-Ives labor management bill.

On the whole, no one would say there is
much difference between the above program
and the one recently adopted by the Mine-Mill
Executive Board. There are, of course, differ-
ences and changes of emphasis. Especially as
it applies to labor. Mine-Mill has called for
another look at the whole idea of Kennedy-
Ives. Also the Executive Board feels that it
is about time that in addition to extension and
raising of minimum wage coverage, hours at
which overtime must be paid should be cut
to 35 hours per week. This would be bringing
the minimum wage law up-to-date. Also we
find no reference to the -“Murray-Kennedy un-
employment compensation bill which should
be a “nmst” for the 86th Congress, especially
in view of the weak unemployment bill passed
in the last. session.-V-H. C.

issue because lawyers and professors can de-
bate it endlessly without really ever settling
it.

That this is the real issue is shown by the
fact that during the period froml Reconstruc-
tion until Franklin D. Roosevelt forced a
change in 1937, the reactionaries and anti-labor
forces supported the conservative majority on
the U. S. Supreme court in the decisions declar-
ing progressive social and labor legislation
passed by the States to be unconstitutional.
They .didn’t shout about state rights then.

American history—leaving the Civil war
aside--shows that, on the whole, labor and the
common man are much more likely to get bet-
ter breaks from the Federal government than
from State government. The “right-to-work”
issue is a“ good illustration. The issue of racial
integration is, of course, a dramatic illustra-
tion. In fact, it is proved in the caseof almost
any other current issue which lends itself to
legislation or judicial decision. The action of
a majority of the state chief justices aifew
months ago, attacking the U. S. Supremecourt
for its recent civil liberties decisions, is further

proof that the rights of the people are more .

likely to be protected and advanced by the’ Fed-

THE MAINE-MILL UNION

Channel-Eyes
Flub in C omo

ON ONE OF HIS Saturday night shows last
month, Perry Como stopped dead in the
middle of a song while the off-camera orchestra
continued to play for a few seconds before_it,
too, petered out with an unfinished tune. With
the mastery of a top showman, Como easily
carried the flub off by making a gag out of
it, ‘admitting to the TV audience that the
prompter behind the camera had held up a cue
card with the wrong lyrics. He even did a
special take-off on the flub on his next show.

To most hep TV viewers the fact that per-

gporlners on the living room screen don’t
exactly work ad lib, but rely heavily on cue
cards’ behind the camera, is nothing startlingly
new. Few, however, appreciate the high art
and vital importance to the illusion of a per-
former’s impromptu “naturalness” that the
whole business of cue-carding has become on
TV. -

There’s no star on TV who looks more im-
promptu, relaxed and just plain “natural” than
Perry Como. Skillfully-created illusion or not,
it so happens that Como employs the two
top cue-card artists in the business. It’s a rare
occasion, indeed, when 33-year old Don Stewart
and 35-year-old Carl Marlow flub a cue-card as
they did on that show last month, leaving Como
without a song. i

'k**

TEWART and Marlow at work are never
seen by TV viewers, but they are a pair
who have made a career out of developing
tricks of the TV prompters’ trade, and contrib-
uting significantly to Como’s high ratings -while
they were at it. Nine years ago the enterpris-
ing duo were mere studio page boys on
Como’s show. Today they cue not only their
“main “client,” Como, but "Patti Page, Pat
Boone, Jimmy Dean and Sammy Kaye, too.
They're in business for themselves, so sought-
after that they have to hire assistants to handle
calls for their particular brand of know-how.

A  It’s all in the cards——-and how they're

handled (so the performer doesn’t LOOK like
he or she’s actually reading them) that Mar-

‘ A low and Stewart have become so expert.
According to one New York Times reviewer
who watched them work and later interviewed

them, the craftsmen’s only tools are 20x30-inch B

placards, each one numbered and each carry-
ing about 15 lines of big-lettered words printed
by hand in different colors. The star's lines
are black, with different colored lines for each
of the other regular or guest performers on
the show.

The situation sometimes gets a little com-
plicated with a guest star who's color blind

and .can’t distinguish his own lines from

,somebody else's, but this is taken care of by
Marlow and Stewart through ingenious varia-
tions in brightness and shading of colors. It
gets even more complicated with a performer
who’s near-sighted, in which case bigger letters
(sometimes as high as six inches) and fewer
words have to be used‘ on each card to permit
that particular guest to see and read his lines
“naturally.” .

NO MATTER what color or how big the let-
ters, though, the big trick of the prompters
is to get the cue cards into such positions in
«:2-rmelation to the camera lenses that the per-
formers appear to be talking or singing di-
rectly * to you in front of your TV screen at
home instead of -reading the words on a cue
card right behind, alongside, over or under the
camera. ‘ » "

That trick of card manipulation isn't _as
easy as it" sounds, because a top show like
Como’s uses several cameras for constantly
changing action shots, angles and close-ups.
Every move of each” camera throughout the
show is mapped out in advance like a blue-
print, and wherever a camera is shooting that’s
where Marlow or Stewart have to be with
their cue-cards. .' .

It takes considerable skill» and shifty foot-
work for these two guys to hop, skip, jump,
crawl or climb into just the right positions
from camera to camera so that some comic
can ask a straight man “Who was that lady
I seen you with last night?” and the straight
man can answer “That was no lady that was
your wife," without either performer seeming

V“ to be reading his beige or pink-colored lines
half a foot high on a 20x30-inch cue card being
held in front of his face a. yard away by Mr.

S Stewart or Mr. Marlow.

It has to look “spontaneous,” see?

A Once a comic did ask “Who was that lady

I seen you with last night?” and the poor

A straight man just stood there dumb and word-

‘ less because the guy with the cue-card, shifting
to the other-angle camera, had tripped off
_the stage -and fallen smack into the studio au-

" A dience. It got a laugh, anyway.

:Well, Happy New Year. That's TV show

PD Reinstatement Fight

EL PASO, Texas—Officers and members of Local
501 at the big Phelps Dodge copper refinery here were
advised last month that their fight for vindication and
reinstatement of 13 union brothers would be backed by
the full resources of the International union.

Assurances that “every
possible effort in their be-
half will be vigorously pur-
sued by our Union" were con-
tained in a statement adopted
Dec. 6 by the International
Executive board during its re-
cent meeting in Chicago. The
action of Mine-Mill's top offi-
cials followed a similar declar-
ation m ad e earlier by dele-
gates from five locals of the
Phelps Dodge council at a spe-

cial meeting in El Paso. on

Seven local leaders were dis-
charged and an additional six
members were given 30-day
penalty layoffs on Nov. 17 for
allegedly participating in a 13-
day walkout over mounting
grievances and a wa v e of
“tough guy” discipline by PD
formen and efficiency men.

Production at the world’s
biggest copper refinery was
halted on Oct. 18 and resumed
Oct. 31 only after the workers
decided at a meeting to return
to work with assurances from
the company that it would
“err, if at all, on the side of
leniency rather than severity.”

A thorough review and ap-
praisal of all the facts in the
situation by the International
Executive B 0 a r (1 concluded
that the walkout “was caused
by a management policy of re-
fusing for over two years to
give any serious consideration
to many proposals and sugges-
tions of the union advanced
in dozens of meetings with the
El Paso management of the
company.”

COMPANY BLAMED
V “Phelps AD od g e manage-
ment,’A’ the. Board declared, “is
guilty of arrogant treatment
of its employees and an irre-
sponsible‘ labor relations pol-
icy in the El Paso refinery.”
The Mine-Mill officers de-
scribed the PD action as “the

-decision of the company to

shift the responsibility for
their own failures in the El
Paso refinery to the local un-
ion leadership.” These penalty
layoffs and firings “are a
gross violation of the agree-
ment and of generally accept-
ed and elementary principles
of labor relations," the Board's
statement charged.

Notice was served on PD
management that “the Execu-

tive Board in behalf of our

Union shall not accept this de-

cision of the Phelps Dodge

company.”

Both Local 501 and the
Phelps Dodge council were ad-
vised that the International
Union “Will continue the fight

for vindication _and reinstate-
ment of these discharged lead-
ers with every means at its

. disposal until this objective is

achieved.”

ARBITRATION .
“As the first step in this de-
termined;'“ effort to achieve
justice for the workers affect-
ed,” the Board urged Local
501 “to proceed with arbitra-
tion of this issue with all pos-
sible speed.” Assurance was
also given the local that all
necessary assistance in the
arbitration proceedings will be
provided by the International
Union. Mine-Mill G e n e r a 1
Counsel Nathan Witt will rep-
resent the union in the case.

The Board statement con-
cluded with a commendation
of the El Paso Refinery Work-
ers leadership “for its respon-
sible attitude in the face of
irresponsible and provocative
actions of Phelps Dodge man-
agement prior to and since the
walkout of October 18th."

The membership and leaders
of Local 501 were assured “of
continued support until these
important issues are properly
adjusted and settled."

Action by the Board followed
a meeting of PD council dele-
gates with company officials
which failed to change man-
agement’s position on the fir-
ings and disciplinary layoffs.

Working Youth

WASHINGTON -— By 1965
more than four million boys

.- COPPER showed signs of weakness both at. home and
abroad in late November and early December. Prices sagged on
London metal exchange, and U. S. custom smelters in four cuts
spread over little more than a week dropped the price from 30
"cents to 28% cents per pound. Explanation seems to be that
sfcarce buying of copper has come on an end as some European
consumers, finding themselves overbought, offered copper for
sale,*and expanding mine production, settlement of all but one
majorstrike, promise ample supplies. Large sales of fabricated
a"n‘d-ingot copper last October seem to have reflected decision of
many companies to stock up, rather than big increase in end

o I ' o o ’
Mmcl on Labor Leg Islatlon
WASHINGTON—In November,  S. Senator Barry M. Goldwater (Re-p., Ariz.), I
reversed the national Democratic landslide and was re-elected after a it bitter battle -

against the AFL-CIO. ‘During the campaign, he

labor bosses.”

Last » month, a Washington newspaper Dispatch said that »“one of the staunchest

Republican advocates of
legislation to curb political

A activity by labor unions has
. evid_ently.abandoned the idea.”

The, story was referring to
Senator-- Goldwater, who, it
said, had declared that busi-
ness and labor leaders should
get together and agree volun-

tarily to limit their political -ef- -

forts. ‘It was also obviously re-
ferring to such proposed legis-
lation as the Kennedy-Ives bill.

Information here was that

Goldwater and Secretary of
Labor James P. Mitchell had
agreed ‘in a conference that
Congress is not going to be
able to do much about restrict-
ing the political work of un-
ions without violating the Con-
stitutional guarantees of free
speech and association. The
Arizona senator told a news
conference that he is now pro-
posing that key labor and bus-
iness leaders meet and try to
agree on the extent of their re-

’ spective political activity. -

= Goldwater was quoted as
saying that he would hate to
see a ‘situation in which a can-

 didate. for office “would have
..-to be bound-by any one of the
two groups,” labor or busi-
ness. - ~ ’

- -Meanwhile a new Senate
vestigation was ordered early
last month into the circulation
of an anonymous handbill that
attacked Goldwater in the clos-

ing days of the campaign. The -

leaflets depicted a grinning

A Joseph Stalin who wasasking,

“Why not vote for Goldwater.”
It‘ also linked Goldwater and
Mine-Mill. Both Goldwater and
his apponent, ex-Gov. Ernest
McFarland, attacked the smear
against Mine-Mill as unfair
and unfounded. The senator
said that Mine-Mill was .“the
largest and most democratic

union in A Arizona.” Although.

Mine-Mill’s A r i z o n a council
delegates had officially en-

‘ dorsed I McFarland, they said

at the time that they were
“fully appreciative of Goldwa-
ter’s efforts in the non-ferrous
metals crisis and are con-
vinced bypersonal contact of

his basic /‘honesty - and sincer-’

ity.” 1

‘Best Brass Settlement’ I
Is -Wonat Revere Plant  

BULLETIN

LOS ANGELES, Calif.—The best settlement of the
year in the brass industry has been won here by the work-
ers at"Revere Copper & Brass company under Mine-Mill

Local‘ 700, just 22 days after smashing a combined raid by .

the Auto" and Steel unions. (See earlier story beginning
on page 1.) . . ' I
Ratification of the new three-year agreement was

voted by the Revere membership at both.the Los Angeles .-
and Santa Ana plants. on Dec. 18. ,

It ‘provides for an across-the-board general wage in-
crease of 12 cents an hour retroactive to Dec. 1, which is

' a full two months prior to the existing contract’s Jan. 30,

1959, expiration date. ' A
Running until Jan. 30, 1962, the new contract calls
for wage reopeners on Jan. 30, 1960 and 1961.

IMPORTANT GAINS

The settlement also provides for a modified union A.

shop,‘ plus‘ other important gains in straight money, fringe
benefits and contract .conditions. A
Additional increases ranging from 3 to 5 cents an hour

-were negotiated for five classifications on top of the 'gen- _

era! 12-cent payboost. . . . . ~.

 All %maintenance,fshipping and yard employees] will
1 also be-placed on a bonus designed to give them an addi-
tional substantial increase in earnings. 'l‘his'_ puts prac-
tically everybody on bonus at the L. A- and ASanta Ana
plants. ,  - — -. X ._ ,A.

, Improved hospital and surgical benefits paid for by

the company were also won, including: increase in hos- .

pital room and board allowance from $12 to $16 per day,
hospital extras increased from $180 to $300,‘ and surgical
schedules upped from $200 to $300. -

year of service and vesting rights after. 10 years.

Other gains include removal of most strings from the
paid holidays clause and stronger seniority and job va-
cancy provisions in the contract.

The base rate at Revere is now $2.05 per hour.

Int’l. Rep Harlow Wildman and Business Agent Rito
Valencia assisted the Revere negotiating committee which
included James Wright,’ A. J. Dilworth, .Woodrow White,
,Al Jensen and Jewell ,Williams. .

Last year under’ a one-year contract settlement,
Revere‘ workers were granted a general wage increase of
13 cents an hour, plus an additional 5 cents per hour for
‘maintenance and machine shop employees.

The new agreement just signed is only the third since

, Mine-Mill won bargaining rights at Revere three years ago

and signed the first contract ‘with a Wage reopener in
December-ilf 1956. A    . . -.

and a completely different one
coming off. In the" last two
days before the vote, the UAW
put out five different leaflets
—and used a sound truck at
the plant gates.

But the raiders’ -leaflets,
really, differeil only as to
color of paper on which the
propaganda was printed. In
the main their pitch was one

continual re’-hash of unfounded-

red ‘smears against Mine-Mill
used by Steel and Auto in
every raid, plus a few hand-
picked comparisons of wage
rates—-and constant references
to size of membership in each
union.

Mine-Mill stuck to the is-
sues of greater concern on the
job—the union’s recordv on
wages and working conditions
at Revere and the bargaining
program for the new contract
which only the raid was hold-
ing up. Also emphasized was
the failure of both Auto and
Steel to adequately represent
workers in copper and brass
where their members hold
only secondclass citizenship,
and the weaknesses of both
raiders in bargaining outside
the auto and steel industries.
BARGAIN .

. The NLRB vote count made
the choice for Mine-Mill of-
ficia1.~Negotiations, delayed by
the raid, were immediately
scheduled. 6 \

‘Active in the campaign

were: unit chairman Jame“

_ Wright; vice chairman Al Jen-

sen, chief steward A. J. Dil-

wworth; recording secretary

Woodrow White; financial sec-
retary Jewell Williams, and
members of the Mine-Mill
staff.

Other rank and file leaders
most active in assuring Mine-
Mill’s victory were Angelo
Cicconi and Bill Libby at the
Santa Ana plant; and Hodges
Farrell, Ray Diaz, Ernie Villa,
Robert Taylor and Mac Ma-
cedo at the Los Angeles
plant; plus others too numer-
ous to mention at both plants.

“Recent experiments
show that extremely fine
silica dust kills cockroaches
faster and more surely than
customary toxic insecticides,
and the‘ insects cannot de-
velop immunity to the
dust.” i

In this case, human be-
ings were used as the guin-
