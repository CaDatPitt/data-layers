through a special training in the military academies. They
are “skilled workers,” and make the army their life’s pro-
fession.

What about discipline?

On duty discipline must naturally be maintained; though
cases of insubordination are rare owing to the strong revo-
lutionary consciousness of the army. Abuse of authority is
punished far more severely than insubordination.

Serious offenses against the discipline of the workers’ ar-my
—such as non-fulﬁllment of duty, insubordination, embez-
zlement and corruption—-are treated as crimes against the
Workers’ State and are punished according to revolutionary
law.

OE duty, every soldier enjoys all the rights of a citizen,
and as such is subject to the same laws that govern the con-
duct of other citizens. All men must be given leave of
absence to register their votes in elections, to exercise their
functions if elected, to attend conferences and to serve on
the peoples’ tribunals.

What is the daily routine of the Red Army?

As a rule, duty occupies not more than eight hours a day.
Every encouragement is given to participation in training
classes of all types in spare time. Men must not be wakened in
the morning more than an hour and a half before work begins.
After the midday meal at noon an hour and a. half’s rest
must be allowed. A full supper is eaten between six and
eight o’clock. Evening roll call is at nine and lights out at
eleven, when all entertainments must end.

The Red Army is now a mechanized force. This was ren-
dered possible by the complete success of the Five-Year Plan.
The degree of mechanization is reflected in the ﬁgures sub-
mitted by Voroshilov to the 17th Congress of the Russian
Communist Party on February 3, 1934. In 1929 the aver-
age of mechanized horsepower in the Red Army was 2.6 per
man; in 1930, 3.07; and in 1933, 7.74. This ﬁgure is con-
siderably higher than that of the French and American armies,
higher even than that of the British army. Thus the Red Army
is becoming an army of technicians. Fifty per cent of its men
are technical specialists to a greater or lesser degree. If one
includes machine-gunners, the percentage is raised to 70.
Given the vast numbers in the army, this ensures a tremendous
ﬁghting capacity.

The Red Army is mechanized for defense only; for de-
fense also the frontiers of the Soviet Union have been
strongly fortiﬁed.  chain of fortiﬁed areas now extends
from Lake Ladoga (near Leningrad) to the Black Sea, and
along the Far Eastern frontiers. The coast defenses on the
Black Sea and the Baltic, the White Sea and the Pacific, have
all been considerably strengthened. The navy—in accordance
with the defensive policy of the Republic—is limited to such
smaller vessels, submarines, hydroplanes and light cruisers,
as are required for coast protection.

Thus the ,’Red Army stands on guard over the vast and

growing achievements of Socialist construction, in which the‘

army has itself played a most conspicuous part. For the
Red Army first remolds its men and then sends them out to
remake the social fabric of the country and to transform

12

-,_(:. _

the mental outlook of its people,_ especially of the peasants.
It is a training ground for the builders of Socialism.

The inﬂuence of the army as a body and of the ex-army
men as individuals in the collectivization of agriculture has
been decisive. Men returned to their villages not only as
trained mechanics but as the conscious political leaders of
the countryside. The Red Army of today is reaping the
fruits of the patient work of former years. Whereas not long
ago the recruit contingents showed a high proportion of
illiterates, these now number scarcely one per cent. Needless
to say, no man is illiterate on leaving the army.

How does the army educate its men?

By January 1, 1934, the army had 1,478 army clubs and
over 2,000 libraries containing more than thirteen million
volumes, 5,300 cinemas and innumerable reading rooms,
study circles and classes. These classes provide training on
all theoretical and practical subjects. Besides the central Red
Army playhouse in Moscow, there are twenty-ﬁve army thea-
ters and 2,800 amateur dramatic groups.

The army has its own daily paper, the Red Star. Ten other
dailies for the army and two for the navy are published in
various parts of the Soviet Union.

The barracks are not, as in other countries, "closed to the
public.” The men in them receive numerous visits, both from
the local factories with which they are in close touch and from
the peasantsin the collective farms, whom they regularly assist
during harvest time or other emergencies.

To illustrate the spirit of absolute unity that binds the

soldier to his class, we may quote the solemn promise made‘

13

 

  

by each recruit on entering the army—a promise that has
been substituted for the old oath of allegiance to the Czar:
"I, the son of the toiling people, and a citizen of the Union
of Soviet Socialist Republics, assume the duties of a ﬁghter
in the Workers’ and Peasants’ Army. Before the working
class of the U.S.S.R. and of the whole world, I promise to
bear this title with honor, conscientiously to study the pro-
fession of arms and to guard like the apple of my eye
the national and military property from damage -and theft. I
promise to observe military discipline strictly and unswerving-'
ly and to carry out implicitly all orders given me by the com-
manders appointed by the workers’ and peasants’ government.
I promise both to refrain myself and to restrain my comrades
from any act unworthy of a citizen of the U.S.S.R., and to
direct all my acts and all my thoughts towards the great goal
of the liberation of all workers." I promise at the first call
of the workers’ and peasants’ government to come forward
in defense of the U.S.S.R. against every danger and against

1 the attacks of all enemies. In the struggle of the U.S.S.R.

for Socialism and for the brotherhood of all nations, I promise
not to spare either my strength or my life itself. Should I of
evil intent break this my solemn promise, may the general
contempt of all be my lot and the heavy hand of revolution-
ary justice fall upon me.”

Announcing a New Book

VETERANS
ON THE MARCH

By JACK DOUGLAS

With a Foreword by
IOHN DOS PASSOS

THE relation of American capitalism to those
whom it uses to ﬁght its wars is here inter-
woven with the story of the Bonus Marches of
1932 and 1933. “Although written in a narra-
tive style, the book is entirely factual.

The battles of the veterans, from the Pay
March of the Revolutionary War soldiers,
through the famous pension ﬁghts after the
Civil War, up to the recent Bonus Marches, are
shown as a ﬁght between those who proﬁt from
wars and those who ﬁght them.

This book is a history, an interpretation, and
a story. .

"We do not,” said Stalin, leader of the Russian workers,
. "want an inch of anyhody’s land; but neither will we surrender

an inch of our own territory to anyone.” Echoing his words; ‘A J’
upon all the frontiers of the Soviet Union stands the army .
of the workers, grimly prepared to fling back every attack of 

its capitalist enemies.

THE RED ARMY
The Making of the Red Army

N November, 1917, the old Czarist army was in the last
stages of dissolution. But in the meantime a genuine army

of workers and peasants was already being formed; it drew
its main strength from the Red Guards or armed corps of
industrial workers, organized by the factory councils, trade
unions, and similar working class bodies. These were rein-

forced by the revolutionary sailors of the Fleet and certain

units of the old army. ’

By January, 1918, the Red Guard formations numbered
ﬁfty to sixty thousand men. The new olfensive of the Ger-
man army made it necessary to tighten up the loose structure
of this force; and on January 28, 1918, a Soviet decree
formally established the Red Army, the class army of the
workers. At first this army was based on voluntary service;
but the appearance of White Guard forces, subsidized by the
former allies of the Czar, so lengthened the revolutionary
front, that by June the calling up of certain “age classes” of
young peasants and workers became inevitable.

During the subsequent period of civil war the army con-
tinuously gathered strength from the inexhaustible reserves
of the Russian masses. It was an army led by a number of
capable commanders, who sprang as by a miracle from the
ranks of the workers themselves. A few Czarist oﬂicers also

3

    

threw in ‘their lot with the revolutionary army, but the vast
majority took arms against their own country.

By 1920, after the defeat of the last counter-revolutionary
forces and after the Polish War, the Red Army numbered
ﬁve and a half million men. Peace brought with it the prob-
lem of demobilization. The reduction of this enormous
army to the normal strength of 560,000 men took several years
and taxed all the organizational resources of the Soviets.

It was not until 1924 that the second great period opens
in the history of the Red Army, a period of reforms associated
intimately with the work of Frunze, one, of the most outstand-
ing of the Red commanders. This period continued until
1928, the year in which the first Five-Year Plan was initiated.
In the course of these four years every detail in the structure,
training and equipment of the army was examined and re-
modelled. A new system of recruiting was established and
the territorial system fully developed (see below). Statutes
and regulations, based on the experience of the Civil War,
were drawn up. A network of military schools was established
throughout the country. The result was a thoroughly mod-

ern army but an army different from all others, in that its
class character as a workers’ army revealed itself even in the
smallest particulars of routine and discipline.

But as yet the Red Army, while modern in structure and
theoretical outlook and always prepared to defend the revo-

lution, was still backward in equipment; and for what equip-'

ment lit possessed, it depended partly upon its potential ene-
mies, the great capitalist countries. It was only the completion
of the first Five-Year Plan that gave this army the technical

4

equipment it required to make effective the vast man-power
of the Republic.

Voroshilov, People’s Commissar for the Naval and Military
Affairs, said in 1933:

“The industrialization of the country, the growth of Soviet
metallurgy, engineering, chemistry—this is what created the
favorable conditions that enabled us to strengthen the defenses
of the Soviet Union. We have produced our own heavy
artillery. We have designed and put into production our own
anti-aircraft guns, tanks, and anti-tank artillery. We have now
not only scout planes, which predominated in 1928, but all types
of modern machines, bombers, raiders, chasers, and heavy bomb-
ers—and these in a proportion that makes our air ﬂeet reallv
powerful. . . . We can also safely say that in facing chemical
weapons we shall not be defenseless.”

Service in the Red Army
The Red Army is ﬂesh of the ﬂesh of the toiling masses

of the Soviet Union, not divorced from them. It can never
be used against the workers, as can the armies of the capi-
talist world. All toilets in the Republic—and none but the
workers—bear arms. As Frunze said in 1924, “The regular
army of peace time is but the skeleton that, at the moment
of danger, must be clothed in the ﬂesh of the armed masses
of the workers.” This principle ﬁnds expression in the law
of 1928 on recruitment to the army, which lays down that,

' although the defense of the -Soviet Union is the duty of every

citizen of the Republic, only those belonging to the toiling
population are called upon to do their duty with arms in their

hands.

Thus military service in the Soviet Union is a proud priv-
ilege of the whole working class. ‘

This privilege is as a matter of course extended to the
peoples of the national minorities. The well-known policy
of the Soviet Union in giving complete national independence
to these minorities is necessarily mirrored in the structure of
the Red Army. Although each nation contributes its own
contingents, it must not be supposed that any of the republics
forming the Soviet Union maintains an army of its own as
distinct from the Red Army. The Red Army is thus a genuine
international force. '

What about conscientious objectors?

Members of religious bodies, whose doctrine forbids the
bearing of arms and forbade it also before 1917, may be
exempted from service or employed for sanitary duties. In
peace time they may be called upon for special duty in ﬁght-
ing epidemics, animal epidemics, forest fires and so forth;
such service may not extend beyond the period of two years
in all. In war time objectors are drafted into special de-
tachments for auxiliary service.

What is the period of training?

The first stage is pre-military training at the age of nine-
teen and twenty. The young men are trained fo_r one month
a year in their home districts.

For the regular army recruits are called up at the age of
twenty-one. Their period of service is two years in the land
and air forces or three to four years in the navy, after which

they are on the reserve list, training for one month each year,
until they have completed five years in all.

Territorials also begin their service at the age of twenty-
one and terminate it at the age of twenty-ﬁve. Their train-
ing lasts eleven months in all—three months the first year, and
two in each succeeding year.

Reservists are divided into two categories. One includes
ex-regulars up to the age of thirty-four, the other ex-regulars
from thirty-four to forty. Both categories may be called up
for not more than three months’ special training in all.

In addition to these, all men eligible for service, but in excess
of the numbers required for regulars and territorials, are
trained for a period of six months in all, but not more than
two months each year, in their own localities. I

What are the numbers in the Red Army?

The regular army consists of -560,000 men. Each year a
contingent of about 270,000 men is drafted into the regulars,
while the same number passes out on completion of its train-
ing. I

The entire annual contingent of recruits is about one mil-
lion two hundred thousand. Of these, an average of about
300,000 are found medically unﬁt. As was stated above,
270,000 go into the regulars and a further 350,000 pass into
the territorials. The remainder receives a certain military
training outside the army.

The Red Army as a Workers’ Army

What is the class composition of the Red Army?
It will be seen from the ﬁgures quoted below that the
8

    

Fl
J

 
 

vast increase in the number of industrial workers under the
Five-Year Plan is reﬂected in the changed composition of the
army.

In 1921, 18 per cent were workers, 71 per cent peasants,
11 per cent others. V

- In 1930, 31.2 per cent were workers, 57.9 per cent peasants,
10.9 percent others.

On January 1, 1934, 45.8 per cent were workers, 42.5
per cent" peasants, 11.7 per cent state and cooperative em-
ployees, etc.

These proportions apply not merely to the rank and ﬁle
but to the commanding ranks as well.

What about “oﬂicers” in the Red Army?

The Red Army has no “oﬂicers” in the old sense of the
term. The Red Army knows no rank; all men in the army
are members of the same class, fulﬁlling different functions
in one and the same organization. To emphasize this, those
in command of any unit are not called captain, colonel, etc.,
but after their function: "company, commander,” “battalion
commander.” They are addressed by everyone alike as "Com-
rade company commander,” etc., while they themselves also

address the rank and ﬁle as “Comrade.”

The commander is responsible not only for the military
but also for the political training and the welfare of his unit.
Orderlies are detailed to commanders but must in no case
be used for personal service. Off duty commanders and rank
and ﬁle mingle on a footing of absolute equality at mess, in
the libraries, clubs and so on.

The senior and higher commanders are required to pass
