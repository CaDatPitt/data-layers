 W?Abraham Lincoln ‘once pointed out

that “the wolf and tie sheep cannot
vagree on a. definition ‘of the word li-
jberty.” . *

. A , ' The same confusion, it now appears,
1 exists around the word “taxes.” V

During the recent election campaign,
Ike Eisenhower made a great to-do
about “lower taxes”—a sentiment with
which all Americans quickly agreed.
But it "becomes rlcleare. by the day that
only the wolves of Wall Street are to
Lbenefit by “lower taxes,” and that, the
‘mass of the’ people, particularly the
workers (who are the sheep of Lin-

g coln’s analogy) are to "pay more.

How will it be done?

By reducing corporation and higher
Income taxes and coming up with a
new Federal Sales tax, exactly the kind
of tax which bears most directly and
heavily on working people.

IT HAS ALREADY been reported

  I Ban student paper ”

for telling truth

about Mcpcarranz
SALT LAKE CITY, Utah——'Suspen-

sionpof ,a student journal of opinion ,

was announced-Lby the University of
Utah recently,
of an article by Gordon Avery, one» of
the student editors, which attempted
to give an objective analysis of the so-
called investigation of Mine-Mill by
the McCarran committee.

The Salt Lake City Tribune said the
action was taken by’the university’s re-
gents “after three years of turbulent
life” for The Forum, journal of the

‘ College Forum.‘ But university sources
A said that the action against the paper
was taken because of the article which
attacked procedures of the McCarran

' committee.

In his article, which appeared in
the October 15 issue of The Forum,
Avery said that the committee con-
eentrated on accomplishing two thin‘gs:

“1. To try by clever questioning to
induce the subpoenaed union officers
into an aclmittance by Vwhich they
oou-Id be clzargecl with perjurry,” and

“2. By clever wording of questions

’ to induce the union officers into waiv-
ing their right to the protection of-
forded by the Fifth Amendment.”

(Avery then, declared that “there is
only one solution, and that is to dis-

» how the subconmzittee. This committee
accomplislzetl nothing which benefits .
. the American people, and yet it is

guilty of a. great many unethiéal prac-
tices which restrict the freedom guar-
anteed by the Constitution.”
The University of Utah board of re-
ents is composed of Salt Lake City
a» ‘linkers and industrial officials.

_ that the staff of the ‘Joint Committee

on Internal Revenue has prepared’ a
special report_ urging a general sales
tax at the manufacturers’_ level which

. would exempt only food, clothing and

medicine. The New York Times also
refers to “revivals of reports that the
new Administration may consider a
Federal Sales Tax.” — .

The excess profits tax on corpora-
tions is due to expire on June 30, 1953;
and~a further cut in regular corpora-

tion taxes is scheduled for April 1', —

1954. On Dec. ‘31, 1953, the'11%_ indi-
vidual‘ income tax increase is also sup-
posed to come to an end.

So, many of the new Republican lead-
ers in -Congress are now openly calling
for letting the corporate taxes lapse,
but reducing the proposed-jcut in per-
sonal taxes. (Representative Read, of
N. Y., for example, is proposing only
a. 5%% reduction in personal taxes in-

by the present law.) ' 3.
PLANS FOR a Federal Sales Tax
are being given little publicity just
now, and the danger is that the pl-an
will be “slipped over” before the_.peo-

ple can see what’s happening. The U. S. '

Chamber of Commerce and the National

Association of Manufacturers have long .
favored such sales tax plans.‘ Today '

such a salesltax is seen as a means of
continuing the gigantic military spend-
ing while cutting the taxes on the cor-
porations and the rich. ,

It is time that the ima-ss of the peo-
ple, at whom the new taxes are aimed,

‘spoke up. Here is another programi
every union in this land can unite‘ to

fight against.

AS€vR- to start huge
open pit mine in Peru
,American _Smelting & Refining Co.

is now seeking a loan from the Export-.

Import Bank in order to start produc-
tion at what will be one of the largest
copper mines- in the. .world—the To-
quelpa mine in Peru. This was re-
ported by Roger W. Straus, chairman
of the 'AS&R board, to a recent meet-
ing of stockholders. -

Straus is reported to have said that
the new mine “when ready, is expected
to be among the first ten copper mines
in the world, probably ranking around
seventh to ninth.” The recently com-
pleted drilling campaign indicated a

very large tonnage of better-than-one- ’

percent ore which can be mined by open
pit methods, he Said. ~ I
The Toquelpa project marks AS&R’s
first large scale venture in copper min-
ing, The company operates‘ mainly in
smelting and refining of ores in the

U; S., although it has some lead-zinc

mines here. It ndw also has extensive
foreign mine and ‘smelter holdings in

Mexico, Canada, Peru and parts of.

Africa. V, .

Mine-Mill’s recent study’, “A World
at .Peace,’’- estimated ‘that American
monopoly groups will, as a resultof
new projects now under way, control
nearly 70%. of the world’s- supply ‘of

copper by 1955. The- addition of the

Toquelpa project will now niaterially
increase that control.

A new “wage reducer” will be handed to employers
as a New Year’s present. The package. will come wrap-
5' newly revised Consumers Price Index, deg 7
signed and produced by~the U. S. -Bureau of Labor
Statistics. The Index is commonly- used as a measure
of changes in workers’ costof living. '

About three -and a half million workers are now
under “escalator clauses” which tie wages directly to
The escalator contracts cover workers
mainly in the auto, farm equipment, railroad and air-
craft industries, and in the big General Electric Corp.
Practically all wage negotiations—-especially undenthe
wage freeze—are affected in one way or another by

Mine—M'ill, the United Electrical Workers and many
other unions have objected strenuously to the Index
as it has operated up to now. A carefully documented
study, issued by UE nearly two years‘ ago, showed
that the Index underplayed the real amount by which
the cost of living has risen ‘for the American worker’s

THE NEW INDEX plays down these results of in-
flation even more. The first new Index will be pub-
lished in February, based on prices during January.

The Bureau is giving its new Index a big build-up
as “modernized” ’and “up to~da.te.” But labor leaders. '
point to the fact that nearly all the announced changes 1
will have the effect of making living costs APPEAR
lower than under the present Index. Thus, millions of
workers will be -deprived of needed wage boosts.

Under the revised Index, current prices will be com- -
pared with prices during the years "1947-49, instead"
of during the years ‘I935-39——the period used ’as the
base up to now. The November Price Index,‘for ex-
ample,.stood at 191, based on the» 1935-39 levels. This
means that prices of goods bought by moderate income
families were 91 per cent higher in November than

than the 91 per‘ce'nt rise. The later base periodthus .— 5

The new Index will also include\prices on some.~,7'5,,
items which are not" now used figuring changes in-9
' living costs. It_ willinclude such items as refrigerators}.
‘self—ser’vice laundries, used cars; ice cream, candy, res-' I
~ taurant meals, and many others which are supposed 7’
to make up the expenses of a modern city family. _
MANY OF THESE ITEMS, however, are being
-added at a time when prices on‘ them have begun to..
decline from previous peak levels. Including them" {in
the Index at this time will tend to depress the Inde
below what it._ would be on the old basis.  ‘
A third important change is a further reduction,
the weight to be given food in the new Index. Food?
accounts for about .a third of the total in tl1e_‘p1'esent",.'

ISSUANCE of the new Index will inmost cases‘

The man who made big headlines -by
his lying charges against Mine—Mill
during the McCarran committee hear-
ings in Salt Lake City has now been
exposed in another bare-faced lie.

I This time the exposure came in court.

He -is Harvey Matusow-

The exposureeof Matusow as a liar ‘
and perjurer, as reported by the Den- 
ver Post, came early this month in the
New York trial of 13 Communist Party
leaders. Matusow had testified as a
government witness against the de-
fendents.

Will Harrison, former editor of the

_ Santa Fe New Mexican, took the stand

as a defense witiiess, according _to the_
Denver Post story. He told the court
Matusow was the man who came to
November, 1950, using the

him an article on Puerto Rico.
The article which Matt, or Matusow,

. claimed he had written, was actually
‘lifted in whole from the" Communist

magazin,e,iPolitical__ Affairs, for April,

' 1954. Ilthad been written by Cesar ~An- .

‘ROCKWOOD, Tenn. —Inspired .

by the efforts and accomp_lish—
‘ ments of Mine—Mill locals in this

~_ area, Workers of the Rocklwoodl

Millscast their ballots last Week
for the. union they knew would
end their sweat shop conditions.

/, Against an unprecedented cam-
paign ‘ of intimidation and red-

’ baiting, the‘workers fought back i

for their union—261-voting for Mine-
Mill. In the months before the election,
\'more than 90% of the-workers had
signed with Mine-Mill, but in the clos-
ing days, the company stepped up its

attacks; and on the voting day, spread’

the threat that avictory for the union
would bring about the closing down
of the mills.

The victory is a’ real tribute to Mine-

Mill and the kind of living unionism it’ I

' champions. About 425 of the labor
force at the mills are women, many of

them related to members of Local 579"
and Local 919. These two locals were

active in the campaign to organize the
mills, contributing time and money.
Leaders of Local 579——n1en like Robert
Wicks, Leland Burnette, Henry Bur-
dette, George Keys, Arnold Golliher —

were’ decisive in bringing the message.

of unionism to the mills.
THROUGH THEIR OWN family life

and associations, the women at the "

mills found out the value of unionism.
Here were workers at Tennessee Prod-
ucts and- Chemical, members. of Local
. 579, getting high wages, overtime, paid
vacations, paid holidays; and there

__dreu, president of Puerto" Rico’s Com-

munist Party. .

Harrison identified‘ the $12 check
which Matusow had received in pay-
ment for the article and which Matu-
sow had cashed. Harrison is now in

— the newspaper-radio business in Santa

Fe. He testified that Matusow had
told him he was living in Taos, New
Mexico, -preparin I a book on Puerto
‘Rico, and f‘wante% toibe a correspon-
'd/ent” for the‘ New Mexican. .
When Matusow .was on the stand
last summer, he had denied flatly that

he had anythingto do with either the 
article or the Santa Fe New Mexican. A

He had also denied that he knew any-
thing about the $12 check which had
‘his signature on- the back.

Mine-Mill’s four International offi-
cers said “the facts make a damned
liar” out of Matusow after he told the

,McCarran committee that our union
had engaged in a nationwide‘ copper

‘- strike in 1950.

Mine,-Mill’s exposure of Matusow’s

headlines and space that the ‘news-
rpaperérgavo the-lie itself.   .- Ii

"they" were at the Rockwood Mills get-

ting 75c. an hour ‘-7- and no vacations

or paid holidays. 1 »
Here were the workers of Local 579

it with a fighting, alert steward’ systemi

to do daily battle for them; and there.

I , were they——-helpless before the bosses.

So long before, the actual election, ‘
after they had signed the vast*majority
of the workers in the union, 3. commit-
tee _of over 50 workers went in, with

Mine-Mill representatives to see the ,_

boss and demand bargaining rights.
When the boss refused, the‘ workers
‘proceeded to?‘ build their union never-4.
theless;\they elected. stewards, started
handling grievances, and directed their —
fire ag%.inst.so.me of the most abusive
foremen. They -didn’t wait for the
Company toirecognize them; they rec-'
ognized. their own need fora union and

‘proceeded to fulfill it. - .

‘ f‘
NOW, WITH VICTORY officially in
theii;'hands,,they intend to step up the
process, fill.out their steward system, ,
and formulate» their contract demands;
And with the ‘grief they have suffered
at the hands of this sweat shop com-

’ pany, their demands will flow from ,

every- department and every shift.

J. P. Mooney, Mine-Mill Internation-
al representative for Tennessee, who
has been doing abang-up job through-
out the whole state, gave chief credit
for the victory to the Mine-Mill people
in Rockwood. It was their pride in
Maine-Mill and their determinationvto
bring unionismyto the Rockwood Mills
that convinced the rank and file in the
mills. He also pointed out that Linus
Wampler and Horace White of the-
Mine-Mill- staff were very instrumental
in the closing phases of the campaignr

It.‘ did not need to happen! The POWB1’

utility companies which have, pre-
vented the steps necessary to bring:
sufficient power to the Northwest -and

the Mountain West.“ '

The reason for their opposition,‘ of

I course, .is that they are doing all right
as it is.» They monopolize the sale of ,_

life-giving electricity tofthe public‘ and
they always manage to‘ roll up tremen-

dous profits and pay dividends on their‘

stock regularly. The expansion of
hydroelectric pnower’ in the West would
Lrequireothe intervention of the Federal
government. And such intervention

’ woulrlbe al danger-‘to_their nice, tight

monopoIy.’“Greatcr hydroelectric facili-
ties would mean cheaper oowerrates.

All Big'Business, including the mine
operators, joins in with the utility com-
panies in "opposiiig public power-pro}
ects, such as the proposed Hel1’s Can‘-5
yon Dam ‘and the Columbia Valley Au-
thority. As things stand now, it is the

* people who pay the way. Federal in-
tervention would mean that corpora- f

tions might have to pay greater taxes‘

and the people would benefit through p

"lower power rates. « i -.

For many years, the Mine, Mill and
-Smelter Union has suppiorted all at-
tempts to remedy this situation. It was
solidly behind Franklin D. Roosevelt
when the Tennessee Valley Authority
was proposed and

brought prosperity out -of -poverty in its

AT ITS CONVENTION in Septem-

Try as they might, the bureaucracies

_fheadin»g both the Canadian Congress

of"Labor and the Canadian Trades‘ and
Labour "Congress were unable to com-

’pletely’ disregard the growing- mili-
;tancy of the Canadian workers at the
_two national convention held recently.

This--is theconclusion of C.  Jack-
son, president of District 5 of the in-

_dependent United Electrical, Radio and
"Machine Workers,~in his “Report on
'Can'ada”.-published in _the December

issue of the March of Labor.
Describing the background against

"which the two labor federations met,
V Brother Jackson recalls the "large num-
- bers of Canadian workers who were
' on picket lines in 1952 and the intensi-

ty of- the struggles which resulted in
longer-strikes and "in some instances,
were marked by company- inspired vio-
lence. ‘Jackson reported: I

“THE ISSUE of which. group should
control the Congress (CCL)———the,in-'

ternational‘ unions, the national unions’,
or a- blend of the two——had erupted in-
the closing hoursof the 1951 conven-
ii tion and, dominated _the.speculation in
the press and the thinking of the_ dele- I

gates '~'as ’this year’s convention got un-

A 3der way. ‘

“A; R. ‘Mosher had’ seen the hand-

. writing on the wall in his own Cana-

dian Brotherhood of Railway -Em-

‘ ’ployees and resigned as its president,
though indicating" he would continue
' to runfor president of the CCL.

«‘.‘The international union (CIO)
forces nominally led by C. H. Millard
of the United Steelworkers, were on

',record as“ intending to place a Steel
»official William, Mahoney, as secre-
[tar-y, ousting McDonald of the\UMW,-..-
V" and thereby subjecting the Congress
to the Millard policies of ‘tight control,<=‘'

,  universal raiding and anti—national un-
 ionism . . .

“The results of the elections were '

an impo_rtant defeat for the Millard

"forces. While Mosher was re-elected
I by 737-to 85 votes Millard’s man,~Ma-

honey, was defeated by the incumbent
Donald lMcDonald by 455 to_410.

, -“f.‘In the elections for the four vice- «
presidents, Millard was given the low- .

est "vote, and in the Executive‘ vote,
’Millard’s man hit. the bottom low of
those elected.”.

JACKSON’S REPORT said that “the
.. convention was not many hours un-

der way before the experiences of the
demands for militant . . '. struggle and

“Administration attempts to intro-

-duce a watered» down resolution on
wages and a' united front were at-.

tacked . . . The convention overwhelm-

 

. . found reflection in ,

 

  gcksonsees unity demands 9‘.

 ipgirgowing in both C CL and   TLC

ingly supported a motion to refer back

and to substitute for it resolutions

. . . calling for an all-in wage confer-
ence in 1953 and for support at the
local level of all workers in struggle,
regardless of affiliations.”

“Delegates speaking on the unity‘

resolutions had paid tribute to the sup-
port received in picket-line struggles
from these expelled unions (UE, Mine-
Mill, Fur)‘-—thus for the first time in
three years bringing favorable men-
tion of these‘ organizations on the floor
of a CCL convention.

In his report, on the'TLC convention,

Jackson said that “the workers were;
visibly restive against the iron hand”

of the administration.” _
“This was ’_lpart.icu_larly evident,’-’ he

- said, “in the attempt ofcthe admin-
istration to steamroller, on behalf of g
“the Liberal government, a resolution

calling for the outlawing of . . . the

Labour Progressive Party. ’
“Despite a’ week or ‘more of press

buildup‘ for this resolution ‘and the

fact that President Percy‘ Benvgough
centered attention on it in his open-

ing speech, the resolution went down

in resounding defeat when presentedt

on the floor.” H
Jackson concludes:

“IN SPITE of the efforts of‘ the top

leadership“ of the two congresses to‘
hold back the rank and file from unity<

moves," locality after locality, is show-
ing new examples‘ of unity in action.

“These arise both, around picket
lines andaround basicissues such as
the impending", proposals for legisla-
tion which would ,be far‘ more danger-

- ous and damagingto civil *rights in.
.Canada than the sum total of the Taft-
Hartley, Smith and McCarran,Acts in _

 Raid supporter is defeated  
, in Vancouver civic elections

VANCOUVER, B. C.—The labor tide
against raiding and red-baiting’, first

‘ -evidenced on the turn at Trail, was
_ ~'manifest* this month in the results of
, the Vancouver civic, elections. '

Candidate for; mayor, endorsed by

1 _  Cooperative Commonwealth Federa-
“ tion, (CCF) was Tom Alsbury, presi-
- dent of the “local Trades and Labor

Council (AFL), who was opposed by

. three business aspirants. The CCF ad-
vanced a full slate for the councilyand

school board as well. ' »

Alsbury was the strong favorite be-
fore the election, it being announced
that with a solid CCF vote behind him,
and his opposition split, he was a sure
But the CCF wasn’t behind
him. He lost by over 5000 votes.

WHEN THE BALLOTS were count,-,
,. ed in the mayoralty box, paper after
lfpaper came out blank, a phenomenon

which aroused some comment_ in ‘the

;daily papers without, of course, any

‘explanation.
The reason was plain. Alsbury had
been identified with the raid on Trail,

‘ led by pther CCF-ers like himself. He

had also commenced, and is still pro-

" moting a raid on the Civic Employees
: Union, Outside Workers, and has as
‘ well been -a particularly virulent and
H disruptive red-baiter in the council he

heads.

but they weren’t taking Alsbury. "

In fact, the CCF showed ‘surprising.

lack of strength throughout, electing
only one candidate, a Parks Board
member. In all other contests, they

_ were topped by independents, runners

up to the Non Partisan candidate’s.who
took practically all positions.

I By Nels Thibaulf
. - Board Member, Dt'strt'ct 8
_V 1952 is almost gone and each year at
this’ time we pause for a moment to
review the progress of our Union.
Many times :the gains ~made by our
.membership are too lightly regarded.
-First in the field of cont'ra’ct’, bar-
gaining, practically all our collective
agreements have been renewed: ‘with
many; major gains and improvements.
Our Locals in the U.S. were able with-
out- having to resort to final strike
action, to winicontract renewals from
the big‘ four in copper, namely, Ana-
conda, Phelps Dodge, A.S. 82: ‘R. and
.Kennecott. In the main these contracts
provided‘, gains approximately 10c per
hour plus'substantial improvements in
the. pension plan. 1 i ‘
In Canada, we, also made outstanding
gains. Beginning with the two major
mining companies, Inco in the east and

C.M.&S.' -in the west, the resultlof our .
.'program of bargaining coordination be-

tween our Joint Committee in both

places reflects‘ itself in’ the. wage rates '

presently established\and the greater

strengthening of our contracts. ,, -

BARGAINING='was-much stiffer this
‘year withlead,-izinc and gold producers

and to, some extent as well with the g

copper companies [because of a. reduced
market price for lead and zinc, a froz-

en price on gold andwhat appeared to»
be a less critical situation in the supply

of copper. ~' ‘ j ,
* Our first 1953 bargaining has opened
between Local 880 in Calumet, Que-

bec and Calu-met Mines. This is a lead- I

zinc property and reports from Local

. 880' President Leon Brazeau indicate a
fight ahead. A relatively small number « 1

of strikes were ‘conducted throughout
our International Union-

The strike that was forced ‘on us at
Marmora (Local 8_89) by the Deloro

.Smelting and Refining Company per-

sisted for four- weeks before the mem-

bers of that local were able to win J
their, demands,'_ The few others in.
 western Canada and in the U. S. were

also" terminated successfully.

Throughout the yearfnew organi- L

zation has extendediitself with many
new ‘members being added to" our
Union. In the last few weeks however,
cutbacks in parts of the industry in
B.C. has resulted in the. layoff of some
of our. members, '

Taking into consideration the fact
that raiding by other unions and har-
rasing activitiesi//stemmin-g from the
McCarran Act were still being directed
against our Unio'n,.th'e year -1952 gen-
erally was quite successful for our
members. 1, . ,.

[The 42nd Annual Convention of our
International Union was hard hitting
and again determined a program that
provides a perspective for all Local
Unions- Our’ Convention did not pus-
sy-foot on the real,/bread and butter
issues facing the working people. A
clear position was put forth on our
stand for peace, for civil liberties, for
minority rights, for greater gains in
the field of collective bargaining, for
political action and for unitylin the
Labour Movement.

IT WAS VERY GOOD to iseenour

Brothers in Trail, B. C., take action to ”
