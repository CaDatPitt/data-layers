0 you want a union prepared to meet any situation or emergency?

« Do you want a union that can take advantage of opportunities in
organization and collective bargaining? Do you want a union that is
adequately staffed and which provides adequate year-round servicing?

Of course you do. Every worker who is a union member wants that
kind of union. Mine-Mill members. especially. want their union to grow.
want to consolidate its magnificent victories over the raiders and in wage
negotiations. ' ‘ - '

That is why the 47th Mine-Mill Convention at Nogales last month
approved for referendum vote an amendment to the union constitution
which. if approved. will increase per "capita ‘tax by ten cents. This will
make the total per capita income one dollar per member.

That 10 cents will help your union organize the rest of the industry.
It will help increase the regular servicing your local union gets. It will
help protect your union from further raids and attacks. It will help your
union to further strengthen its financial structure. It will mean more ed-
ucational. publicity and research facilities. It will mean greater strength
in collective bargaining with the employer.

-That is why the convention delegates and the leaders of your union
ask that you vote "YES"‘on Monday. November 5. for amendment No. 3.

 

COMPARE your union's financial stru i
ture with other unions and you will fincq

that Mine-Mill still has the most democratic!
requirements: it still has one of the low-
est per capita taxes in the labor move’-
ment: it still has the best “financial protec-
tion for local unions and members.

In CIO Steel. for example. all dues’, Va
monies collected are sent directly to Sec: KN ‘
retary-Treasurer David J. McDonald. Noth-
ing is withheld by the local. Then—if the:
local union behaves itself and does nothgg
ing to offend Philip Murray and other Steel
offices-—some. of the dues money is re,-
funded. But there is no guarantee that sucli

will be done!

Unions like Steel. Auto. Rubber. etc.. so .
their dues rates by convention action. An Q
their per capita rates. too. The member-n.
ship does not get the chance to approve‘
or vote down the actjon. Mine-Mill leav ‘ ~
the dues rates up to the local unions. «:3
it cannot increase per capita rates except!
by secret ballot vote of all the members,

Here are some typical per capita ratesj _

‘charged by other unions:

Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers ...... "$2.0 ,
Order of Railway Conductors.....

United Mine Workers

Steelworkers (CIO) ................... ..

 A SALMON, Idaho—The first contract
,_ covering workers in Idaho’s Salmon
Rivercountry has been won by Mine-
; Mill’s newest local union, Salmon
_*Miner’s and Mil1men’s Union No. 911.
'"-f.The contract with the Clayton Silver
‘(Mines calls for wage increases of
Lnine and one—half cents across the
, board and fringe issues totaling eight
 ‘cents.
A Fringe issues include vacations, rub-
her money and shift differentials. Be-
cause of the isolations of the Clayton
property, the union requested com-
j..bined holidays and vacations. It is
extremel_v difficult to get “out” and
“back to the area in a single day.:The
 Vacation plan agreed upon gives‘ every
’-\wo'rker some paid‘ time off. Men with
has little  six month’s seniority get

six days; men with one year get ten

%_days, and men with three years get
14 days. -
,_r The new contract brings the 1niner’s
rate up to '$12.52, plus differentials.

this month in wage negotiations with

«Travis reports full details
of new AS&R seﬂlenienf

DENVER—Int’l secretary-treasurer
M. E. Travis, chairman of the -AS&R
Council, last week released a break-
down of the new settlement with
American Smelting & Refining Co.,
giving more details than were car-
ried in the brief announcement in the
last issue of THE UNION.

The agreement, reached in con-

Columbia, Tennessee

Armour workers act
on grievances, win

_g COLUMBIA, Tenn.—When the Ar-
mour Fertilizer company refused to
settle several grievances filed by Mine-
Mill’s Armour Acid and Phosphate
Workers Union No. 546, the local went
into action and within three days the
union had settled three major griev-
ances and won an agreement from the
company on arbitration, even though
the current contract does not provide
for it. .  V

The union called in a federal con-
ciliator and a meeting was held with
the company on Oct. 10. The concil-

iator recommended arbitration, but.

the companyrefused. That night every
man in plant walked out. Even fore-
men‘ were not permitted to enter.

The plant remained closed the entire
next day and that night the union met
again and decided to return to work.
This action, too, caught the company
unprepared since no. foremen showed
up for work. The" men‘ entered the
plant and started it. going in the. same
manner that they had closed it — with-
out, telling the. compny. . ._ ‘

This was enough for management,
Wvho called in a conciliator and agreed
to the following concessions to the
union: -_

1. "Lester Alexander, discharged lo-
comotive engineer, was reinstated

without loss of seniority and with the

question of back :pay going to arbi-
tration. . - .
2. George Heathcoatwas promoted

-to Grade “C” electrician with an in-

crease of. six cents _._an hour,“ effective
July 12, with back pay; amounting to
"$31.20. V ' i

3. Clifford Wells, who had been uri-
justly laid off, was put backto work
on his regular job. h —

Local union officers and commit-
teemen participating in the negotia-
tions. were L. D. " Lunn, preident;
Ernest Kin, vice-president; W. N.
Stamps, financial, secretary; Lem Es-
tep, trustee, and Herman McKinney,

nection with AS&R’s smelter at Ta-
coma, was already providing a pat-
tern for the entire chain of 13
AS&R operations under Mine-mill con-
tract. At presstime for THE UNION,
settlements based on the same provi-
sions had been reached at Perth Am-
boy, Baltimore and Omaha, and fur-

_ther agreement reports were expected

quickly from the rest of the chain.
Travis commented that the new pact
“compares f a. v o r a bl y” with settle-
ments reached by Mine-Mill earlier this
year. Outstanding feature is a prece-
dent-making company paid pension
plan,’ under which AS&R workers will
accumulate pension benefits of $1 a.

” month for every year of service. These
benefits will be available to the Work-,

er, regardless of how many years he
works for AS&R, and will be over and
above Social Security payments. ‘
THE NEW PENSION plan will‘ be"
open‘ to any AS&R worker who wishes
to becovered by it, even if. he is now
covered by the plan which the company
has had in effect for 10 years. Those
wanting to remain under the old plan
may do so, under a provision for dras-
tically reduced employee contributions.
‘The settlement also calls for a wage
increase of 8 cents an hour to all
AS&R employees. An additional 8.58
"cents in “fringe” benefits isialso pro-
vided,‘ including: reclassifications and

"revision of the wage rate structure,

medical plan, death and dismember-
ment insurance, non-occupational acci-
dental bodily injury and sickness pay-
ment of $30 weekly for 13 weeks, thi;ee

weeks’ vacation after 15 years, increase '

in shift differentials from 4 cents and
8 cents to 5 cents and 10 cents.

This brings the total “economic’;"

package in AS&R to 16.58 cents, exclu-
sivegof the pension program, the hourly

value of which has not been computed

as "yet. Travis po‘in_ted out that the
pension benefits under the plan are

:yf‘better than the Steel .~p1an,.’’ ‘ ‘

h All economic provisions of the new
contract, with the exception _of the

' pension plan, are retroactive_ to July 1,

the expiration of the old AS&R agree-'

ments. The-pact runs for two years, _ H,

with a reopening clause on all eco-
nomic matters June 30, 1952.

[for Mine-Mill as against the AFL ,Ce- _

ment, Lime and Gypsum Workers in an

I NLRB election.

I The election came after -more than

. two years of a long, ;bitter, ‘uphill’
. struggle

carried on by Mine-‘Mill
through the NLRB and the courts to
" force Monolith. to set" aside the illegal

“back door” contract which it entered r

into -withnthe‘ AFL in July, "1949’,”a

"short time after Monolith workers" had‘

voted against the AFL’ inan ‘election.
’Mine—Mlill filed charges of unfair

I ‘labor practices against the ‘company »

‘and the AFL. The NLRB conducted
a hearing_in Tehachapi. during March
and April. of 1950. The NLRB trial ex-

V aminer handed down ,a report in_ .July,
1950, in which he‘ found the company
and -the AFL guilty of entering into
an illegal agreement and of conspiring
togethe_r to coerce and intimidate work-

‘ ~ ers into joining the‘ AFL. The company

appealed this ruling to the Washing-
ton NLRB. , '

ON JUNE 20, 1951, the Washington

Board issued its Decision and Order

' in the case upholding the Trial Exami-

ner’s finding and ordering the company

-- to set aside the illegal AFL. contract

and to cease giving aid and assistance

. to the AFL, or attempting to intimi-

date or coerce employees to‘ prevent
them from joining Mine-Mill.

Even after the decision of the Wash-
ington Board, the company and the
AFL still refused tocomply, but in-
stead the company filed another appeal
with the Federal Court.

In the meantime, however, Mine-Mill
had filed a petition for an NLRB elec-
tion: and ‘despite all the delaying and
stalling tactics of the company and the
AFL, the Board ordered a hearing on

, the Mine-Mill, petition, and the elec-

tion resulted.

MINE-MILL Local 550 was the bar-
gaining representative of the Monolith-
workers from 1941 until the unholy al-

' liance between the company and AFL

was consumated in 1949. From the

time of the signing of the shameful 5- ~

year AFL sell-out contract, Mine—Mill

' “members fought ceaselessly to expose
' it and throw it out. '

In spite'of fierce .company repres-

V‘ sion, Mine-Mill members carried on a

.. running fight against the denial of
workers’ rights and privileges by the
company and "the AFL. They fought

 _ against the intensive speed-up system
'_ that was put into effect after the AFL
 sell-out, andthey fought for the set-
 tlement of grievances. Since the com- "
' . pany and the—AFL‘ werejworking hand

in glove, the, result of the Mine Mill

_campaign was a complete exposure of

the company’s domination over the

0 AFL’s outfit.

Bingham local votes dollar

SALT. LAKE CITY, Utah—Members
of Bingham Open Pit Miners’ Union,
Local 485, know what it means to carry
on a strike for manymonths. And they
believe workers who carry on such
strikes deserve more than an occa-

‘ sional “expression of support.”

So the Bingham‘ local has ‘voted
unanimously to take an action that

-will show howeit feels, and how far

it is willing to go in helping out"strik-

summed up in a telegram received last

strike-bust drive  

BAYARD, N. M.——Invited by a small
group of business men, the CIO Steel-

7 workers Union has joined hands/with
' the Empire Zinc. company and corrupt

law" enforcement_ agencies in an at-
tempt to smash the year-old strike by
Mine-Mi1l’s Local 890 against the sub-

sidiary of the New Jersey Zinc Com--

pany. I _ - .
The first move in the raid was a

physical assault on Int’l. rep. Clinton

Jencks, who was attacked by Earl Lett,

i . one of the merchants who “palled in the
A Murray payrollers.

That the raid will die the premature

' death it deserves was predicted by Lo-
cal v890 president Cipriano Montoya,‘

who told reporters:

“l_Vo miners want Steel-—only a few '
businessmen crying over some short.
checks , from our three-week's strike» ‘

(the national strike) a, month ago.
This /is a ,miners’ union and no un-

_ will get nowhere‘ in Grant County, un-

less they want to organize some bus-
inessmen into a sewing circle.”

From Timmins, Ont., came word last
_week from Dorothy McDonald,‘ chair-
man of Mine-.Mill Auxiliaries, ‘it h a t

‘ women's auxiliaries have donated more

than $400 to the Empire Zinc strike to

Murray pooh-poohs
labor unity idea‘

Philip Murray’s disdainful attitude
toward labor unity was revealed last

i week by the CIO Brewery Workers’

paper, which reported a speech by
the CIO king before Jim Carey’s rump
Electrical Workers’ union in Buffalo.

Murray can take labor unity or ..

leave it alone. He told the Careyites
that “no calamity has overtaken the
nation because we donjt, have the

vUnited Labor Policy Committee any

more.”

(The ULPC, formed in December, V
‘ 1950, to provide united action by the

CIO and AFL on national .issues af-
fecting‘~ “labor,” was dissolved when

the AFL withdrew its members’ on

August 28.) ‘ '

Murray became very self-righteous‘

and told the IUE delegates that he
would never considerturning the CIO
over to “those crustytindividuals” and
“fossils” who run the AFL. —
Murray’s whole "approach to th

ULPC breakup was one of relief.’ NoV

regrets. Labor unity, his speech in-
dicates, is just something that labor.
leaders talk about when they're not
busy raiding each other’s unions. His
remarks did not contain a single ref-
erence to any CIO plans for tryingsto
unite the divided labor movement.

Each of us is extremely proud to be

the fact that we were able to run as a

two years. We have come through the
initial stages of the attack in vastly

better shape than most unions. That »

is because our union and its members
have been prepared. It was Mine-Mill
who was chosen to be the first victim
of the terrible conspriacy to transform

legitimate trade unions into anemic
company unions stripped of the will to
fight back.

That the first “victim” roared back
and fought to a standstill the employ-
ers and their pets in high union office
was something the company-union plot-
ters hadn’t counted on. Labor his-
torians of the future will record this
achievement as the turning point in
the struggle to preserve American
trade unions. Mine-Mill accomplished
that and its greatest weapon was unity.

Each of us is proud to have been
chosen a leader for this great fight.
We all recognized, no matter what of-
fice we held, that if we were to win
the fight we would have to work as a
team, devoted to Mine—Mill’s traditional
democratic Constitution and to its pro-
gram——a program hammered out not
by one man or group of men, but by
the rank-and-file, the membership of
our organization.

Sometimes there were differences
among us. These were settled without
the factionalism so rampant these days
among the opportunists who hold office

sensible thing—settle our differences
by conference and compromise, keeping
our unity intact, our love for Mine-Mill
unmarred by any personal bitterness.
Your four international officers have
deep respect for the rank—and—file and
for each other—and deep admiration.
Each of us fervently believe that it
will be in thebest interests of Mine-Mill
and its members to keep our team in-
tact. While the union has made great
strides, the job is just beginning. The
fight is not over. For the first time
since World War II Mine-Mill has the
opportunity to consolidate its strength.
This we can do by organizing the un-
organized workers in our industry, by
further strengthening our financial

structure, by achieving ever-greater ..

victories in collective bargaining, by
working diligently for labor unity, and
by putting into practice the magnifi-
cent program adopted by our 47th Con-
vention at Nogales, Arizona.‘

The future of Mine~Mi1l is bright.

On every hand we are winning im- '

portant victories.

In the past two years, Mine-Mill

by C10, AF of L, and the LAM.

' We have engaged in" and won NLRB

quately show the service rendered dur-
ing the past two years to members of .

the manner in which we of District No.

feated the concentrated attempt of
the raiders to take over the long?

tana and at the same time negotiated
contracts, fought companies winning
major grievances, organized new 10-
cals, carried on legislative work and
other activities’ throughout, the ‘Dis-

Candidate for Board Member. District 7

This union has won some mighty
important victories in the last two
years——and especially in thepast year.
 We’ve smashed the raiders every-

Where, and that was no small feat,

when you consider the size of the raid-

ing crews and the huge amounts of
money they were given to use in their
attempt to wreck- our union.
We’ve taken on the employers on a
5-_ V‘ nationwide basis, and shown that Mine-
' ' Mill has the stuff to win, when the
chips are down and the going gets
rough. .

We’ve graduated. We’re "no: longer
on the defensive, fighting to hold our
union together. We're on the offen-
sive, confident that our unity and
strength» can takeuus places. ’

As we take the offensive, it is im-
portant that wetkeep the. tried’ and
proven leadership which led us through
the trying, period. just over. Our union.
new has ‘a leadership that has learned
how to work {well together, how to
get things. done. It is a leadership that
sees» not only the problems of today,
but has vision’ enough to understand:

the problems of tomorrow, and to plan
ahead‘ against those problems.

The leadership provided by John
Clark, Orville Larson, Charles Wilson
and Maurice Travis fills the bill exact-
ly. It operates as a team should oper-
at<.~—i.n united style. And this team

'. has been tested in every manner con-
ceivable.

This four-man team is just what
Mine-Mill needs right now as it moves
into an all—out campaign to organize

new properties, and to consolidate the .-

, V very real" gains we have won in the last
.— . year. _

I  = .It’s also a team we need in view of
Wthe‘ many-sided and complex problems

our union\faces as a result of the
' Wage freeze and all the other by-prod-
ucts of the so-called defense “emer-‘
_gency.” Ours is a militant, fighting
union. We want to keep our militant,
fighting leaders. I
So I’m urging every member of
Mine-Mill to vote for another two years
under the successful, united leadership

.- of PresidentiJohn Clark, Vice President

A, Orville Larson, Vice’President Charles

Wilson and Secretary-Treasurer ‘Mau-

rice. Travis. '

__ I also urge every member to vote
" .“yes.” on the three proposed changes in
 the Constitution. I was chairman of

_ the Constitutional Committee at ‘our
, ' Nogales -convention, when those amend-

I . \
ments were drafted, and I feel very
strongly that they should be passed.

Our union has -come of age. "

If we want our union to continue
its growth, and at the same time to
continue winning its battles against the

employers, we've got to furnish the
funds to do the Job. It’s just as simple

- as that.

leadership, our workers have succeed-
ed in fighting off the attacks on our
union.

Today, our union, the rank and file
and our" leaders, are faced with the
responsibility, the utmost necessity, of
fulfilling a twofold task.

We must _do all in .our tﬁwer to
help the working people of Canada and
the United States to. re-unite their
forces on a program and policies which
will beat back the inevitable on-
slaughts of the profiteers, the ex-
ploiters and the war makers.

At the same time, we must continue
the progress we, ourown union, has
recorded, and consolidate and expand
that progress by an all-out campaign
to organize the thousands in our jur-
isdiction who are still unorganized,‘
and to carry the battle to our own
employers to further improve the
working and living‘ standards of our
people. '

To accomplish. two such tremendous
tasks, we must first assure our Inter-
national Union a’ strong, capable, pro-
gressive and, above all, united leader-
ship. Such a leadership is possible in
re-election of President John
Clark, Vice-President Orville Larson,
Vice-President Charles ” Wilson- and
Secretary-Treasurer Maurice Travis.

.Secondly, in order to strengthen and

to consolidate our union, it is essen-
tial to approve by overwhelming ma-

todas nuestras ganancias del contrato

de le Empire Zinc en Bayard, N. M.,
no se esperan ser muy dificiles. V
De las corriente negociasiones del

 (Committee to U

To The Editor:
Your publication deadline prevents

A us from publishing a complete list of

those Mine-Mill members who have
accepted membership on the Mine-Mill
United ‘Leadership Committee. This
letter is signed by a partial list.
Our committee has been organized
to express support for the re-election
of our present four international offi-
cers-—John Clark, president; Orville
Larson, Charles Wilson, vice-presidents,
and Maurice E. Travis, secretary-
treasurer. Our four leaders are seeking
re-election as a team, a team that can

‘safely run on its record of magnificent

»

accomplishinent in the last two years.
Some members will vote for the four
international officers because of their

. great leadership in the Victories over

 

the union bureaucrats who raided us.

Some will vote for them because of
our historic victories in collective bar-

' gaining this year. Others will vote for
.them because under their leadership

Mine-Mill has strengthened its finan-
cial structure. Others will choose them

'-for their great devotion to the princi- ‘

ples of democratic trade unionism.
While each of the undersigned may
be supporting.\Clark, Larson, Wilson,
and Travis for one or more of the
above reasons, all of us would support
them if they had accomplished nothing
else except to forge the unprecedented
unity in our union at the present time.

‘That is why we call ourselves a com-

mittee for united leadership. Our four
international officers are united and
their leadership has helped build the
(greatest degree of solidarity Mine-Mill
has ever enjoyed. This contribution of
unity is the outstanding achievement

of Clark, Larson, Wilson, and Travis.

We think it would be unwise, to say
the least, not to continue this kind of
leadership. Our four international offi-
cers are experienced, courageous, able,
loyal, and’ united. What more can we
ask? P"

I We urge all members of Mine-Mill,

. in the United States and Canada, to go

to their local union polls on Monday,
November 5, and cast their ballots for
John Clark, Orville Larson, Charles
Wilson, and Maurice Travis.

To the Editor:

At a regular membership meeting
held last night the candidacy of Sec-
retary-Treasurer Maurice Travis was
discussed in the coming International
election. At a well-attended meeting
it was regularly moved, seconded and
voted unanimously to endorse’ Travis
for a further term as Secretary-treas"-
urer. We feel that he has done an
excellent job in the past and will con-
tinue to do so in the future.

early“ enough people in the United
tates or Canada know exactly what a
 workers" union really is and what it is
to attain. There are still many
thousands’ under thefimpression that a’

la hipocresia con ‘quo lo dice.

“La compania quiere buenas rela-
ciones can sue empleados. Nos pre-
ocupamos por su bienstar, queremos
que todos esten contentos.”

Ahora vamos viendo si es posible
quehaiga buenas relaciones entre la
compaﬁia y sus empleados.

Vamos viendo si es posible que todas
esten. contentos, y si debéras se pre-
ocﬁpan por el bienstar de los mis-
mos.

La hoia suelta nos dice que por ulti- ,

mos 30 0 40 aﬁos se ha mantenido a
los mexicanos separados de los anglos.
En baﬁos separados. En excfiados
separados. De acuerdo con lo que la
gérencia dice, esto se hace porque los

"empleados mexicanos son; “rateros y

I

sucios.”

Siempra ha sido el mexicano el que
desempeﬁa los trabajos mas sucios,
calientes y peligrosos; y no puede de-
sempeﬁar algunos de los trabajos
livianos y bien pagados que hay en
esa planta. L’ razén es‘ segun’ la
gérencia, porque e1 mexicano “no cali-
fica.” Y si no califica no sele da op-
ortunidad para que aprenda. Hombres
hayque han trabajado con” es emprésa

  

   

toda su vida y ni a segundos mayor-
domos han llegado. ’

La misma constitucion esta diciendo
que, “todo hombre es creado igﬁal."
Pues en esa planta, no es igual. Alli
el mexicano es inferior. Es inferior
como hﬁmano y como trabajador. ‘

Por lo anteriormente expuesto,

vemos que no es cierto que esa com-
paﬁia quiera buenas relaciones con sus
empleados. Ni es cierto que se‘pre-
ocupe por su bien-estar ni quiere que
todos esten contentos.

COMO VA A ser posible que unos
seres racionales; unos seres hﬁmanos,
jovenes veteranos de la guerra esten
contentos en ese ambiente? ’

protested by Smotherman

MAGNA, Utah—C. D. Smothermon,
Mine-Mill executive‘ board member for
District 2 and co-chairman of Mine-
MiI1’s minority and. civil rights com-
mittee protested to President Truman
on October 10 against the Department
of Interior’s announcement that it will

take complete control over employment-

of attorneys by any Indian tribe;

“This is to respectfully request’ that

you give this problem your serious and
personal discrimination in any move
which would force attorneys, not of
their choosing, upon the Indians. or
any other people as their. legal ad-

viser-s.”' "

Calling the President’s attention to
the large Indian membership of,Mine-
Mill, Smothermon that also said that

:-

‘‘one of the most shameful conditions _

is the failure of our government to live
up to the terms of a treaty negotiated
with the Navajotribe. _
“To this date,” Smothermon said,
“the government fails to extend to the
Indian children the educational guaran-

_tees which are provided in that treaty.”

the release of Brother,Paul Corcoran

from the Idaho penitentiary, where he I,

has been confined for-over two years.

Pardon was granted August 15
(1901). Petitions signed by eight of
the jurors and 6,000‘ Idaho residents
were’ presented to the board on July

‘5. ‘Attorney A.- A. Frazer of Boise, for

Corcoran, stressed the- method of se-
lecting the jury and the evident bias

and prejudice of Judge Steward who ,
was brought to Wallace from the “
southern part‘of the state to try the» .

cases of men in the hull pen.

Corcoran was. convicted of shooting.
' a man named Cheyne, although he ’

was 19 miles away from the place
where Cheyne was shot. This fact was
established during the: trial and ad'-

mitted. by the p1“osecution.._ This judge ~

would disgrace: the judiciary of any
country. He now admits the man he
sentenced to seven years was not
the one who should have. been pun-

ished. ‘

 “ ' The officers of Local 9 had re-

Steps are being taken to enforce

tion was headed by Frank L. Lamb,
chairman of the bargaining committee,

and accompanied by John Paradise of —.

the UE staff.

The presence of these union repre- ~
‘ sentatives marked a great step ~ in
building cooperation andunity among »

all Anaconda ,workers. As -further
steps in this direction, the Council not

only voted to open allits future meet- -
ings to other Anaconda and American '

Brass unions,.and to maintain continued
contact, but also to keep all other brass
industry unions informed of the prog-
ress of negotiations with the American
Brass Company.

A SETTLEMENT between UE and.

Anaconda Wire‘ & Cable was reported
by Brother Lamb, who credited the _co-
operation between Mine-Mill and UE
Local 404 with having ‘made possible
the settlement of 8c across the board
and 8.7c in fringe issues. This package,

excluding a pension plan which was not ‘

a local demand because of -the short
lengthtof service of the Hastings work-

ers," is the first one to‘ break'"the‘'b‘ras§s‘ " '

company line of '7c-9$éc' established
with various other unions. ' -

In explaining how the Kenosha work-

ers were forced because their isolation,

into accepting the ABC settlement of
7‘/zc, Brother Madison also reported
that the Wage Stabilization Board had
approved only 5c of the -settlement, dis-
allowing the additional 2'/zc. He there-
fore stressed the need" for complete

unity of all brass ‘workers, regardless
of their affiliation, in order to gain‘

their maximum economic demands.

Other guests at the Council meeting
included a delegation from the Carteret
Copper and Refinery Workers Union,
Local 837, of Mine-Mill, whose "out-
standing settlement reached in August
with the U.S. Metals Company, was
reported upon to the Council meeting
by president John Mitro. A report on

— the national bargaining situation was

made by District 6 board member A1

Pezzati, who emphasized that any set-
'- tlement short of the: "national agree-

ment would be unacceptable to the.
- brass workers. ,. ~ ‘V ’ -

Regional director Irving’Dichter pre- , H

sented a program for unity of brass

workers. and a specific proposal for a.

calling of a conference of all Connecti-

cut brass workers on the common ob- .
' jective of winning 20'/2 an hour pack-_
age. Herman Clott, Mine-Mill .,legisla-

tive representative in Washington re-
ported on the curtailment of copper and
other metals which have again affected

employment in the brass industry, ‘A’

pointing up the necessity of an imme-
diate action program in order to avoid
serious layoffs in the’ industry. “

. The meeting was chaired by pre‘si- .
dent Michael Gazy of Ansonia Local

tional ' representatives  Henry» "Rapuano, * ‘

Torrington brass workers meet,
to protest ABC contract stall

TORRINGTON, CONN .-—Rising re-

sentment of Anaconda-American Brass
Company workers against manage-
ment's stall in reaching 3 - contract

settlement with Mine-Mill 0.’ the basis »

of the industry pattern of 20% cents
an hour erupted October 16 at the

ABC plant. here‘ when a spontaneous‘ _’

protest meeting of men in the Scrap
Room and Casting Shop brought pro-
duction to a‘ trickle.’ -~ ~

Involved were all the crane oper- 2

stars and truck drivers in the two key

«departments who quit work two hours

before "the. end of ‘the morning shift
to_ hold a meeting at the union hall
next to the plant. The workers are
members of Mine-Mill Torrington
Brass~Local 423. V . ~ '

Tied up as aresult were the rolling,
rod and tube mills as well as the
whole flow’ of production to other de-
partm'ents'aro‘und the plant which em-
ploys nearly ’a thousand men in the
bargaining unit.

THE_ NEXT DAY -workers in the
tube mill staged a similar protest
meeting-—wm‘cn- ..,.... ’ the same kind
of effect on the plant's output.

The meetings occurred spontaneously
as rank and file demonstrations pro-

_.testing the_ company's delay in reach-

ing a settlement. in negotiations of s

new contract. Approximately fifteen .-
. negotiations meetings in the last five

months have failed to bring suitable

. counter-proposals from management

to the union's demands.

Int’i rep. Winslow Lesniewski said A

Earlier this month, the four Inter-

that the action of the men reflected
the sentiment of the entire plant
against ‘:the delaying tactics -of the
company in refusing’ to meet the ‘pat-
tern of Mine-Mill settlements already
concluded with Kennecbtt, PD, AS R
and other major copper and ‘non-

ferrous metals producers. -

- "The men’ at the ABC plant here
say they are sick and tired of working
