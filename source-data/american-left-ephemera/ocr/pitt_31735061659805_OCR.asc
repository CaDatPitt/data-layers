And here are some ﬁgures: The Paris group asked
40,000,000 metric tons of bread grains over four years;
the President only offers 23 million.

The Paris group asked for 12 million tons of fats; the
United States offered two million. _

tons of semi-ﬁnished steel so their own factories could
fabricate it. .

But the President offered exactly the reverse. He
boosted the ﬁnished steel products from 1,272,000 to
1,802,000 tons in the ﬁrst year while he gt the crude and
%gﬂi_&i% steel ﬁgures down to l,266,000_t'o—ris"' fromm
t e 2,86 ,000 ﬁgure.

Taken over a four-year period, the Western European
group asked for about 2,400,000 tons of ﬁnished steel and
will be getting about 5,200,000—or more than twice what
they asked for. -

On the other hand, their requests for crude and semi-
ﬁnished steel products were about’ one billion two
hundred thousand tons, and they will be getting about

half a bil1ion—or 40 erc much. ’

Even I. F. -Ston  Plan, admits in the
Nation on Dec. 27, 1947: “In steel, shipbuilding, factory
construction, ho_2£.§_z'_ng, and p_o_zLe_r the United States -has
lowered Europe’s sights in deference to its own basic in-
dustries, which fear E ean com etition.”

In other words, this fancy recovery plan won’t bring y
recovery to Western Europe at all: at the very best, it will
leave Western Europe pretty much a satellite of Wall
Street, dependent on western hemisphere food, while at
the same time struggling—within the limits of a much
smaller capitalist market—to keep itself alive against Amer- J
ican COIIlpCt1tl0Il.

V

The “Plan” is so rigged that it will beneﬁt Big Business
in this country—and that's one good reason why American
workers ought to look twice before they lend their support.

Here are some examples:
12

 

  

American Big Business would be able to buy up German
and other Western European business ﬁrms, and pick up
these assets cheap. For American workers this means tha
the same companies they work for here at home woul
own and exploit companies abroad. If Big Business here
decides that it wants to break American trade unions, or
lower wages, it could carry on lock-outs or even shut down
plants, and still continue to draw super-proﬁts from foreign
investments, based on the exploitation of cheap labor.

Another example: while the President sharply cuts the
allocations for the 16 countries in capital goods andfood,
he sharply raised the ﬁgures for thE"6i'l'?€ﬁning indTstry
in Western Europe.

The 16 countries had asked for half a billion in reﬁning
equipment; the President takes into account “allowances
needed by United States companies within the participat-
ing countries” and therefore proposes three times as much,
or $l,500,000,000. _

In other words, the U.S. oil trust wants to sell crude oil
from the Middle East in Western Europe, and also wants
to dominate the reﬁning plants there. So the government
obligingly olfers three times what the governments them-
selves asked for——with the understanding that it goes to
the U.S. oil companies.

In fact, the bill sent to Congress proposes to guarantee
investments of the private trusts to the extent of $850,-
000,000. Such guarantees would last for 14 years.

Another device which favors Big Business is the guaran-
tee of convertibility of foreign proﬁts. Suppose General
Electric buys into French factories or Italian factories. Its
proﬁts are quoted in francs or lire. Under French or
Italian law, these proﬁts may not be convertible into dol-
lars very easily since the governments of these countries
may be trying to save dollars for essential purchases. Or

13

 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
  
   
 
 
 
 
 
   
  
     

they may wish to nationalize these plants. Under the
Truman-GOP plan, all American companies would have
convertibility of proﬁts guaranteed out of the U.S. Treas-
ury—a device which practically makes these corporations
sovereign outﬁts within other nations. _

A third beneﬁt for Big Business is the proviso that‘ for-
eign countries must make available any strategic minerals
we may desire in payment for that part a1l
Plan which isn't an outright grant.

These countries get “he1p”—and we’ve seen'how little,
misdirected, and costly that help will be—only if they
hand over nickel from New Caledonian mines, or uranium
from the Be-l_g—i':n Congo, or copper from\B?i"tish Rliddésia.
Under such a scheme it will be easy for the State.Depart-
ment to name the terms of trade and make them very
favorable to the United States.

Now let’s see just how this so-called Plan gives the
United States the Levers of Control over the alfairs of
other nations, how it would interfere’ in their internal
politics. U

From the very outset, the M_a£sl_1alL£1an was ann-ounced
ggan anti-Communist measure._Even before ifgoes into
effect, c ce and Italy have had to qualify
for it by o aLlyMgelected Cg,r,!1.1.:I.1.111?1.i.%...ministers, by
undertaking to s__rn_a§h and‘§_fid'eWthe French labor move-
ment and all the other reactionary things which have been
happening in Western Europe. The Plan has already had
the political effect which its authors de-s}e—and that’s one
reason why European labor suspects it.

Moreover,  e preliminary aid pro-
gram on Nov. 12, 1947, Secretary Harriman was asked

--~--———.- - Q

what would happen if any country receiving aid “went
Communist.” He replied: “We would lose interest in it—
in that particular country—-and deal with it as we are no
dealing with countries in that situation.”

This is a frank warning which interferes in other na-
tion’s affairs just as effectively as if an American ambassa-\
dor chooses the governments for other people. .

A second form of interference is the fact that the E.R.P.

allows for a special assistant to the American admin-K
istrator, who would be attached to the American embassy
in each one of the participating countries. The scope of
the program would be under his supervision—a sort of eco-
nomic “gauleiter,” just as the Nazis and the Japanese fas-
cists used to have them in the countries they dominated.
_ Thirdly, the program is not a many—sided, or multi-
lateral affair in which the United States makes available
its help to a committee of 16 nations. On the contrary, a
bi-lateral pact has to be negotiated between the United
States and each one of the 16 nations. In other words, it
isn’t really a co-operative plan: it is a pact in which each
country must meet the terms of Washington -and Wall
Street.

And when President Truman agreed with Senator Ar-
thur Vandenberg that American appropriations should be
on a year-to—year basis, instead of a ‘four-year period, he
made Ere’-VElE'tl71i’r1’g even less of'a Plan, and allows -for ‘
even more dictation to each participant. "

months.
Fourth, each country must live up to a set of eight con-

ditions. Some of these are general—like expanding pro-
15

   

duction, or stabilizing currency. Others are just keys by
which the United States can unlock the gates to the dom-
ination of 'the trade and economic life of the country
getting aid.

For example, the fourth condition speaks of “reducing
barriers to trade among themselves and with other coun-
tries” as a pre-condition for signing a bi—lateral pact. Now
many countries may ﬁnd it necessary to protect their own
industries by tariffs, just as we did for 75 years while our
industry was being expanded, and just as we do now. But
under this provision, the United States could force other
countries to lower all barriers which protect their indus-
tries. American goods could ﬂood and wreck other peoples’
economies.

The ﬁfth condition I have already mentioned-the
stock—piling of “materials which are required by the
United States as a result of deﬁciencies or potential deﬁ-
ciencies in its own natural resources.” -

The sixth condition sets up a currency pool—in the-

currency of other countries—equivalent to the value o_f all
goods granted outright.’

This pool “shall be held or used for such purposes as
may be agreed to between such country and the govern-
ment of the United States.” Since the government receiv-
ing aid will be at the short end of the stick, these currency
pools could be used ‘for’ anything Washington or _VVall

_ Street wants—depressing the currencies of other countries,

trade wars, ﬁnancing civil wars, buying up local stooges,
etc.

And No. 8 binds a recipient country to “furnishing
promptly, upon request of the United States, any relevant
information which would be of assistance to the United
States in determining the nature and scope of future
operations under this Act.”

In other words, the affairs of all states would become an
open book to the State Department—whether the costs of
production, the extent of sales to non-participating’ na-
tions, or any private affairs in economic dealings among
nations or individuals.

In a speech on Dec. 18, 1947, to the Committee for
Marshall Plan Aid at the Biltmore Hotel in New York,
former Assistant Secretary William L. Clayton summed
the whole thing up bluntly: _

“We will hold in our hands at all times the powerful
sanction of discontinuance of aid if, contrary to our expec-
tations, any country fails to live up to its agreement.”

No wonder the Soviet Union and the Eastern European
countries declined to come into this spider’s web! For
there are much more than “political strings” attached to
the P1an—there are steel cables binding a quarter of a
billion people, and even more in the colonial world, to
the decisions and destinies of Wall Street.

Such is the shape of the Marshall Plan—and the heart of
it‘is accepted by the majority of both Democrats and Re-
publicans in Congress. Most of the Congressional differ-
ences over the Plan have been on non-essentials, a smoke-
screen to cover up the basic agreement of the two major
parties and their leaders.

For instance, it doesn’t make much difference whether
the State Department runs it, or a separate agency admin-
isters the Plan—-the “big boys” will control it anyway. And
the argument over just how much should be spent the ﬁrst

‘year isn’t very substantial either. Even if the allocations

are cut, the Administration has funds on which it can draw
to make up the deﬁcit.

Herbert Hoover’s idea of drastically reducing the amount
of capital goods to be sent to Europe, and demanding col-
lateral from Europe in terms of “transferable property,”

17

l

l

 

was not a basic disagreement with the Plan; it's just a logi-
cal step in the same direction as the Plan itself, as the above
analysis has shown. '

Those liberals who pretend that there's a fundamental
conﬂict between the Democrats and Republicans over re-
constructing Europe, as though the former have the right
idea andthe latter the wrong idea, are largely kidding
themselves: what’s worse, they’re kidding the people.

VII

Now then, ‘how much wouldthe plan cost the American
people?
The answer is: plenty.

The cost cannot be measured only in terms of money _,

or even in terms of living standards, although that’s where

‘ it may hit us most dramatically. There also are other

types-of cost which go into the moral and political budget
of the nation. For example, civil liberties.

The Marshall Plan, as an extension of the bi-partisan
reactionary foreign policy, is responsible for the current
Red-scare and witch-hunt. Washington is a city of fear,
and hundreds of thousands of government workers are
being examined for “dangerous thoughts.” In the hunt
for Communists, not only‘ are their rights—and any Ameri-
can has a right to be a Communist—being curtailed but
liberals and democrats of all kinds are being deprived of

constitutional protection‘. Trade _unions have felt this

under the Taft-Hartley Act, which is the logical counter-
part of the Marshall Plan.

Americans are losing the respect of other people: a M

recent British poll shows that more and more Britons are

coming to suspect and hate us. In China, the‘ United States

has replaced japan as the object of popular hatred and
. 18

 

 

"‘|

contempt; in France and Italy, it’s coming to the same
thing; in Greece, people are ﬁghting us. -
A poll of 62 Latin-American students studying i
American universities now shows great hostility—just a
fraction of what the peoples of Cuba, Puerto Rico, Chile,
Brazil, and Panama feel.
And then there are the direct costs, the pork-chop ac-'
count.
. I don’t have to cite the increased cost of living, now in
its inﬂationary stages. Not all of this can be attributed

‘ fairly to the shortages created by the high level of exports

abroad; much of this forest ﬁre of high prices is due to
the wrecking of price controls by both a Democratic Presi-
dent and a Republican Congress, and the refusal of _both
of them to restore such controls, thereby doing the bidding
of Big Business.

But in a situation where no controls exist, ‘and where
the big monopolies refuse to expand production, the
shortages caused by high exports certainly contribute to

— inflation. As the Marshall Plan continues, inflation will,

too.

Then there’s» the matter of taxes. Whether the Truman
proposal for a tax credit passes or not, the fact is that taxes
are way higher than ever. That goes to pay for the “Plan.”

And in addition to $6.8 billion this year, goes ,the $11 bil-
lion military budget, which is a back-stop for the Marshall
Plan. In the 1948-49 budget, the Army, ,_Navy and Air
Force cost the average family of ﬁve about $375 a year.
Only one per cent of the budget is asked for education and
one-tenth of one per cent for housing; but 28 per cent is
going for the Army alone. .

All that comes out of your pockets—not only in taxes;
the corporations which also pay taxes manage to shift their
costs to you—in high prices.

L And then there are speciﬁc ways in which the Marshall
Plan hurts speciﬁc sections of the community. Maritime

- workers, for example, will ﬁnd that the effort to have for-

eign vessels carry much of the supplies is going to .put
them on the beach.

Small businessmen will ﬁnd that shortages in steel
hamper them more than the big fellows; “gray markets”

and black markets are created which hurt the little manu—_

facturer more than the big ones.

And farmers may think that boom markets for grains I

will help them; but how about the family-sized farmer,
the producer of poultry, vegetables and such? He won’t
have boom markets at all, and will be competing with the
Marshall Plan for feed. Moreover, what good does the
boom do for some farmers when all industrial goods are
high as a result of the “Plan”?

Even workers, who think they’ll be kept working be-
cause of a high level of exports—let them stop to look
beyond the tips of their noses. They are paying for what
prosperity they seem to have now in prices; and they
are letting American Big Business build up sources of
super-proﬁts in other countries, so that when Big Business
wants to crack down on them, it will do so and continue
to proﬁt by exploiting foreign workers abroad.

A tremendous and vicious cycle is being built up by
this “Plan”—a feverish boom, which is already based on
civil wars in Greece and China, that will be followed by
a fatal collapse, in which Big Businessmen will quickly
try to move the country into war.

The Marshall Plan is already stimulating warfare in the
eastern Mediterranean and the Paciﬁc; it is threatening
civil war in France and Italy; it -is being accompanied by
a fantastic military budget for a super-Navy, a super-
Air _Force, atom bombs and.universal military training.

20

 

 

Despite the boast that the “Marshall Plan” is the way

to peace, the same men who‘ are running it are at the'

same time clearly preparing for war. So little do they them-
selves believe their Plan will make for peace, that they
simultaneously speed up the current warfare in Greece
and prepare for even more fantastic adventures.

Virgil Jordan, director of the National Industrial Con-
ference Board, a Big Business research organization, put
this very frankly when he told the Union League Club in
Philadelphia on Feb. 12, 1946:

“If any one complains that the dilemma implies or
drives us to a type of imperialism which must end as all
others have ended, let them make the mostof it, for this
time we have no other choice.”

Just think this ghastly sentence over. Jordan admits
frankly that the present program is imperialism. He even
admits that it will end in failure—and war, “as all others

i have ended.” But he tells us that we have no choice.

VIII '

But there is a choice. It’s not thechoice between the
Marshall Plan and failure to reconstruct Europe—for it is
perfectly clear that the Marshall Plan will fail.

It’s not a choice between the Marshall Plan—and war . . .
because that plan will lead to, and is already creating
small wars, and the condition for World War. ‘

But there is another way and, if it is taken in time, the
-American people can, must, and will avert thetrap into
which the German people were led by the German Virgil

Jordans.

That way is to reverse and change our present foreign

policy. And that requires building the People's Party which

21

  

Henry Wallace and all true progressives, among them
American Communists, are. supporting.

For we could have a foreign aid program which would
really meet our own needs, keep our factories and farms
going, and yet help the peoples of both Eastern and West-
ern Europe.

Such a “get-practical” plan, as Henry Vvallace called it,
would require: .

a) a decision to meet the Soviet Union half way on the
political ﬁeld, to sign a peace treaty based on sharing
control of the German Ruhr. It would require calling off
the wars in Greece and China, and scrapping the present
policy of hostility toward the new democracies of Europe
and the colonial peoples. ,

b) the allocation of American money—and the setting
aside of goods—to an international organization, under
the United Nations. It should never be forgotten that
when the Soviet Union came to the original Paris confer-
ence it was perfectly prepared to submit a list of its needs
to the U.N., and sign business-like contracts for repayable
loans with the United States. Other peoples are prepared
to do the same.

In fact, the U.N."s Commission for Europe, which the
President and the G.O.P. are completely by-passing, has
estimated that proper help for Eastern Europe would not
only rebuild that area quickly, but would help_ Western
Europe. _ . ‘

Western Europe could save $90,000,000 in timber im-
ports from the United States if the United States would

supply $5,000,000 worth of special timber-cutting machin--

ery to Eastern Europe.

In fact, if Poland were granted ninety millions worth
of new coal.-mining equipment, she could expand her coal
production three times as much as France could with a

22

3 .

 

“f"""""‘

 

a similar amount, and twice as much as western Germany.

And that would _eliminate the need for a half billion
dollars’ worth of coal imports from across the Atlantic.

c) a system of price controls and roll-backs, plus strict
rationing and taxing the big corporations could accomplish
such a foreign aid program and at the same time spike
the inﬂationary pressures here at home. It could lower the
American. cost of living—which means increase the Ameri-
can standard of living;

We could have plenty in the United States, or fairly
ration our scarce commodities. And we could at the same
time aid those countries which are really rebuilding, and
encourage the rest of the world to make a go of it on the
same principles that are operating in Eastern Europe.

But all this can't be done by the two present parties.

And it can’t be done by trying to ‘ﬁght progress by an
anti-Communist crusade, It requires a. peaceful settlement
with those countries which are Communist, ormoving in

P ' that direction.

It can’t be done by trying to hold back the tides of
anti-capitalism throughout the world, or by trying to run

the United States in the interests of the capitalists, instead‘
. of the people.

American democracy and peace can be saved—only by
rejecting the “Martial Plan,” as Henry Wallace has called
it, and adopting the Plan of Peace, and Production for
Plenty in the United States and dovetailing it with the
peace and production-for-plenty plans of other peoples.

Sounds good, doesn’t itP—-a plan for the economic recon-!
struction of Europe.

Big plans appeal to the ‘American imagination. And the
idea of reconstruction strikes a sound, solid note; we
Americans like to think of construction, of building. And
helping other people out of the jam in which the war left
them—that, too, appeals to our generosity, our ideals of
doing good for others.

The trouble with the Marshall'Plan is——that it isn’t any ’

of these things. It isn’t a plan. And it won’t reconstruct
Europe. Somebody is trying to put something over, not
only on other people, but on us Americans.

And. it will cost us plenty‘——in terms of our living
standards, our civil liberties, the respect of other nations
and friendship of other people, if we let the “somebodies”
who are trying to put this over‘ get away with it.

Before long, a large part of Europe may be so disor-
ganized and chaotic that new-style Hitlers will come to the
top. In the end, this hoax of a plan may cost the world
another war. Yes, American boys ﬁghting against other

people. In the end, such a war could lay waste America,
1500. . ‘

II

How did the Marshall Plan start?
Some people think it was just a bright idea which Sec-

retary of State George C. Marshall threw out in a speech
. 3

  

,.................. . ,_ -._._._

at Harvard University on June 5, 1947. But it started be-
fore that.

It began when the United States broke up an organiza-
tion called the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation

- Administration—we know it better under the -name of

U.N.R.R.A.

The late Fiorello LaGuardia was the head of it, and it
was a pretty effective way of putting the war-torn countries
on their feet. It was a truly international set-up, with all

1. the eastern European countries (those who really felt the

war hardest) in it. The United Nations ran it. But the
State Department killed it. i '

On July 26, 1946 _Assistant-Secretary William Clayton
pronounced the dirge on U.N.R.R.A., and then said:
“The proper solution for any countrythat may require
assistance is to apply to another country which in its
opinion is able and prepared to furnish this assistance.”

That was a- pretty blunt way of saying: “Come over to
Washington and Wall Street. We’ll look you over, and de-
cide for ourselves whether you get help, how much, and
on what terms.”

That’s only part ofhow the “Marshall Plan” started.
The rest of the story lies in the disagreements over the
shape of the post-war peace. The men who run our coun-
try didn’t like the ”fact that in eastern Europe, a new type
of government was coming to be—anti—fascist governments,
led by the workers themselves, who had nationalized the
big industries, and were beginning to do some real
planning.

; Wall Street and Washington didn’t like the fact that the
‘working people of Italy and France were bidding for
power, that Communists were in the governments of those
countries. They didn’t like the fact that Soviet Russia
gwas holding the United States \tO the war-time agreements
ias far as Germany was concerned. Wall Street and Wash-

ington didn’t want to see reparations from Germany go

to rebuild Eastern Europe; neither did they want to share
control of western Germany (the Ruhr) with the Soviets,
as had been agreed in Roosevelt’s day.

 

When the Moscow conference in the spring of 1947].

broke down over the refusal to live up to war-time com-
mitments, Mr. Marshall and his main Republican adviser,
Wall Street lawyer, John Foster Dulles, ﬁnally decided on
trying to organize Western Europe against Russia and!
Eastern Europe. -

The idea was to threaten the Soviet Union and her
allies: “Either you do as we say, or we’ll organize the rest
of the world against you.” That, after all, was the heart of
President Truman’s famous Doctrine as early as March,
1947——even before the Moscow meeting foundered.

In other words, the Marshall Plan was a political and
economic strategy from its very beginnings. It still.is to-
day as we shall see. _

Right after Marshall’s come-on speech at Harvard, the
British and French governments took their cue. The S0-
viet Union sent its delegates to Paris to look the thing
over. And the Soviet diplomats said they would have
nothing to do with the “Plan” for one main reason: they
did not like the idea of ﬁtting their own economies, and
the economics of Eastern "Europe, into a project in which
Wall Street and Washington would have the ﬁnal say.

After defending their own way of life for 28 years and’
building Socialism very painfully against the hostility of
the whole world, Stalin and Molotov had no intention of
turning control of their economic destinies over to the men —

 

‘ of Wall Street and Washington.

We would be willing, said Molotov, to draw up
estimates of what we need and negotiate regular com-
mercial loans with the United States. But we are not
willing to give Wall Street and Washington the levers of *

; control. The other Eastern European countries made the
E same decision: “Better to rebuild the hard way, by tighten-

ing our own‘ belts,‘ thanto give» up our economic inde-

_ pendence after having fought af hard war for it.”

What remained at Paris was a collection of sixteen na-
tions.
1 And who are they? _

One of them is A1_1_s_t_ria, formerly part of the German
Re___j§h. A peace treaty hasn’t even been written for her.

Two of them are Tuigkey and Portugal, fascist states
which aided the ./ggis. As the State Department admits on
page 79 of its explanation of the Marshall Plan, both these
countries “had guick_tl_o®llc_tr;_'r~e:s»o_ur_ces as of ]une 30, 1947,

3 equal to, or in excess of their needs.” In other words,

there’s no real pressing reason to offer them dollars.

Three other members of - the 16 were Swit§_e_1;l_a1nd,
Svy__eg_en, and Ir_e_l_2;nd, all of them neutrals and two of them
pretty heavy war-proﬁteers.

Then there is fa_§_c_j_§t Greece, a war-time ally whose peo-
ple surely deserve aid but who have been governed by a
gang of quislings, operating in the interests of 3,000 rich
Greeks. Of them, Raymond Daniell wrote in the N. Y.

‘ Times for April 5, 1947 : “The present regime is paralyz-

ing the nation’s economy and endangering its security.
Greece faces a staggering budgetary deﬁcit largely because
of unwise spending and the omission to impose taxation
and controls.” '

And then there were Holland, Bq_lg_,iu,II1., Lu3ge_r_nbourg,
Nor1_«_r_a_y, Iceland, De_n_n_}g.rk, France, Italy and Great
Britain. W

Add—western Germany, and you have Marshall Plan
countries.

As you can see, this is a pretty motley crew, leaving out
an important p’ art of Europe, where a good deal of the fo__gd
‘and ti_1;1_ber for Western Europe used to come from, and

 

 

where important centers of industry exist, as in Czecho-

Why, you might ask, were these particular countries in
a jam?

Of course, the actual physical‘ devastation of war was
partly responsible. But Q1‘ the most part these..cou.n.tries
had made a big recovery fro_r_i;1___V-E Day. The main reason
for th?iT'fam is the attempt to rebuild their economies,Qn

t_}_z_e basis of capitalism, the same system which led them

5 r. -
An t ey are trying to rebuld on a capitalist basis at a

time when that system is much weaker, and new parts

of the world—such as Eastern Europe and colonial ’Asia— '
are pretty much closed to the capitalist way of doing ,

things. ‘ , _~

For example: in some countries, like Gy;er_c, the
wealthy classes have such a complete grip on the economy
that they will not even allow income taxes to be placed

on them! How can anybody expect to balance the budget, '

to set aside funds for recovery, or to do the minimum

planning when the wealthy escape taxes?
Britishagriculture had been neg ected for half a cen-
iij u o o a s a "W

tury: the whole country was living off imperialist invest-

ments. But to ay for the war, these investments were

 

c2_1_s____e_d in-—m'_<_:>'_'§tly to Wall Street. As a result, Britain

Or take France: here's another case w_l_1_g1_;§- the 
market r_t_1_1_1s riot, where a reactionary government re£1_1_s_e_s
to evelo its own agriculture, and where one-third of
the national budget is spent on military matters, mostly
for a war aai_r_1st the people of Indo-China, who want the
right to determine their own affairs. e same can be said

' for Holland. Imagine how much of her reso.11'rces are going

for warfare aga_i_r_;_st 60 000 000 Indonesians!

Most of these countries would not have to come to the ‘

United States for “Marshall Plan” help if the workers
and the farmers were running those countries, if peace
were made with the colonial peoples, if big military
budgets were scaled down, if rationing and price controls
and a crackdown on the black market were instituted, if
they started some real business with Eastern Europe.

Of course, if they did all these sensible things, our State
Department and Congress would call them “Red” and

1‘ “Communist.” That is to say—the Marshall Plan is the

high pricefor preventing other peoples from reorganizing
their own aﬁairs sensibly ‘and economically. '

So long as the United States attempts to keep these
peoples on the old capitalist basis, there will never be real
recovery for them. And we shall pay ‘through the nose for
the attempt.

Now let's look at the ﬁgures themselves. .

After a whole summ'er’s«work, the 16 nations came up

with a proposal that the United States give or lend the

equivalent of $29.4 billion in goods over a £o.u1;.y£gr{
period... """"‘ T"""‘ -
Former Secretary Clayton rushed to Paris, and said
tha_t was altogether too high. The ﬁgure was scaled down ‘
to 22.4 billion—which is a deﬁcit that our country

sup_po_sed to ﬁnance dircjly o y.

Then three separate comm7ttees, appointed by Presi-
dent Truman, went to work on the ﬁgures of the 16-na-
tion group. The purpose was to determine what Ameri-
can resources are available and what the minimum aid
for the 16 nations could be.

The most important committee, headed by Secretary

of Commerce Averill Harriman, brought in the most im-

‘portant report——and it made quite a scaling-down of the

16-nation proposals. Finally in mid-December, Truman
submitted his European Recovery Plan to Congress along
with detailed analysis of what it means by the State
Department. .

Here are some of the results: .

First of all, the Marshall Planners would give real
p_g'Qrity t‘o_/therebuil in Ruhr. As the?
Foreign Policy Association report for Dec. 15 says: “High
State Department ofﬁcials have sai_d in eﬂect that the eco-

....

nomic recoi/7f of Germany is the heart o}: the Magshdll 

p o osal.” , . .
LS£c?€tary of the Army Kenneth C. Royall told a House

A_ Appropriations Committee on Dec. 9, 1947: “We are not .

trying merely to make western Germany self-supporting;
we are called upon to make its potential industrial pro-
ductivity the cornerstone of the European Recovery
Pr_ogram.” ’ ’
And Harriman’s committee speciﬁcally rebuked the 16
nations for not giving western Germany suﬂicient priority.
