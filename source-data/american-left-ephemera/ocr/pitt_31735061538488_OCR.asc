grasped at any pretext to oppose a clean-cut break of the _

labor movement from the two-party system of Wall Street.
Not all the violated campaign promises, not all of Truman’s
strikebreaking, not even the revolt of the voters in No-
vember 1946 against Democratic misrule and corruption
could swerve the allegiance of these union leaders to‘ the
capitalist politicians. -

Political Deception and Betrayal

Why do these labor leaders ‘continue to support Wall
Street’s political parties? They are bound to the capital-
ist system and its way of life by their ‘whole tradition and
training. They are tied by a thousand threads to the
capitalist government and the political parties of Wall
Street. A few union officials, like Lewis, stand under the
Republican wing of the Wall Str-eet vulture. Most of them
flock under the Democratic wing. They know no other
political game but that of back—room deals, petty intrigues,
and button-holing labor’s political enemies for small per-
sonal favors.

The most pernicious group in this monstrous political
deception and betrayal of the. workers is the so-called
Communist Party—the Stalinists. During the war, the
Stalinists were the most servile supporters of the Dem-
ocratic administration, the leading advocates of the no-
strike pledge, notorious finks and strikebreakers, shame-
less supporters of Roosevelt’s demand for universal labor
conscription.

In November 1946 they attempted to whitewash Dem-
ocratic reaction and called on the workers to back the
party of Bilbo, Rankin, Boss Hague, Boss Kelly and Tam-
many Hall. They urged the workers to vote for Demo-
cratic candidates who were openly spewing anti-labor,
red-baiting, war—mongering poison. Today they continue
as loyal supporters of the Murray bureaucracy and apolo-
gists for their cowardly policies. .

tion‘ of a labor party One of the first things CIO Presi-

These bureaucrats either do "not understand or delib-

present crucial struggle between the capitalist classiand

the "working class.

‘The immediate issue is the distributionof the national

The. billionaire mo-nopolists have answered these ques-

mean to continue, at any cost, their control of the na-

tional economy and to exploit its resources and labor’

power for their o-wn exclusive benefit. —
The basic issue confronting American labor, in its full
implications, is: Who shall govern the land? What class

shall govern this country? What shall be the fate of man-

‘kind? , -

Ward? Unfortunately. no. The bureaucratls are now

urging the workers to limit themselves to appeals in the. .

slow-moving, corporation‘-dominated courts." V Relinquish
the fight to a few,high-priced lawyers! That is the_sniv-
eling counsel of the “labor statesmen.”

Whom can the workers depend on to begin organizing

a Labor Party and lead an effective struggle to repeal the

Slave Labor Law? They must depend on themselves.
There are thousandsof courageous, tested and-far-sighted
fighters in the ranks of the unions. They are the. back-
-bone of the shop committees, the picket-line captains,

the men and women who built the unions and stood: firm.

in times of storm and stress.

Join the Socialist Workers Party

Theseare the men and womenwho must. forge. a. new;

leadership; a leadership imbued with courage and devo-

tion and class consciousness. This leadership must be

prepared- to meet the great political tasks facing the~Amer—
icanl working. class. .

Over and over again the workers have indicated their
desire for a new party, a party of their own, to fight
against capitalist rule and corruption. Hundreds of un-

ion locals have passed resolutions for a new party. Severals
CIO international unionshave gone on record for a break;
"with the capitalist Republican and Democratic parties.

The next step is to mobilize the union militants, arouse
the ranks and break down the inertia and resistance of;
the top bureaucrats.

The formation of an independent Labor Party with
a program of militant struggle against Wall Street will
inspire a crusade of the people a.gainst entrenched. reac~

tion. All the poor people, all the oppressed races and.
minorities, all who face nerve—wracking insecurity under-

capitalism, are looking for political leadership and a pro.-

gram. They want a way out of poverty, depressions, race i

hatred, wars and fascism.

Those who assume the initiative in the~stru.gg1e for
the political‘ emancipation o-f the American workers must
unite with all like-minded people in la-bor’s ranks.

the party in the forefront of the struggle for the aboli-‘

ment of a Workers’ and Farmers’ Government.

All who earnestly want to prepare themselves for le-ad~

Do not think that this oppressive and tyrannical law

The Taft~I-Iartley Act is the first big pay-off on they

gilt-edged promises made by the imperialist war propa-

The Workers Wanted to Fight ,

The union rank-and-file instinctively grasped the
meaning of this postwar assault. ‘ They felt that the
capitalists were conducting ruthless class warfare. They
understood that the spirit of compromise displayed by
the labor bureaucrats was regardedby the capitalists as
a sign of miserable weakness. The slogan inscribed on

a the banner of Big Business is, “Class against class! War

without quarter!” .

The workers wanted to fight passage of the Slave La-
bor Law without compromise, with every means at their
command, on every front. They tried to force the;top
CIO and AFL leaders into national joint action. They
initiated local joint actions in scores of communities. They

A ‘Why They Got Away with It

i In the face of -the workers’ determination to resist

.,4,Wall Street’s attack, Congress nevertheless steamrollered
through the savage Taft-Hartley Act. How did these -po-

litical representatives of the rapacious rich, this hand-
ful of political-hatchetmen, dare to strike such a blow
against 15,000,000 organized workers, their families and
allies? What made them so sure they could get away

 “ with it?

They consider themselves immune from public wrath

’ and reprisal for two reasons:- 1) Wall Street has a monop-

oly of politics; 2) The labor bureaucrats oppose mass ac-
tion and independent labor politics.

Big Business wields the government as a powerful
Weapon against labor. Wall Street’s legislators pass the
laws." Its courts’ decide their constitutionality. Its ad-

ministrators enforce them.

b Wall street’s political monopoly is maintained through
the two major parties, the Republicans and "Democrats,

interests.

political Siamese twins are nothing but lies designed to

 back wages. ’ V
The Republicans and Democrats in Congress took
their cue from Truman. As they vied with each other
in cooking up the harshest anti‘—labor laws’, Truman—
looking ahead to the 1948 elections—-changed his tactics.
He hoped to evade political responsibility for the oppres-
sive law. He became silent, uttering no protest as the
Taft-Hartley Act was slicked through Congress.

Then, at the last hour, Truman made his grandstand
play for labor support by a belated veto. This was the
selling-point he provided the top labor bureaucrats in
their efforts to peddle the Democratic Party in 1948. ,

As for the -Democrats in Congress, who have long
painted themselves as “friends” of labor, they gave a
decisive majority to the Slave Labor Law—voting 106 to _71
in the House and ?0 to 22 in the Senate.
