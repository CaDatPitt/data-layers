A 100% MENACE

Marie . Kratochvil

Do you have a grandmother?

    

Is she always telling you to take care‘ of yourself? Does she‘ always »seem=
selﬂess in her concern for your welfare, for your happiness, for your future?

That is the way Marie Kratochvil lived—not only. for her" own grand-
children, but for everybody. . ~ e S " — ‘ -‘

Friendly, warm, sincere. . . . The people of Chicago, who knew her,

calledher “everybody’s grandmother.”

Separated from her husband in 1932, Marie Kratochvil went to work
to support her four daughters. When . jobs were not available, eshevfought
for relief. She sent her children to school and they grew up to marry and
have families of their own. - 2 ‘ " ‘ '

Her daughters wanted to provide for Marie Kratochvil in her old age,'p
to care for her and to repay, in some ‘small measure, her sacriﬁces and her‘

selﬂess devotion to their welfare. ~

But, in August 1954, at the age of 71, ‘Marie Kratochvil was deported to
Czechoslovakia. ’

You see, Marie Kratochvil “menaced” the safety and security of the
United States.

This gentle, warm, grey-haired woman was a “menace”?
Ridiculous.

This charge by the Justice Department exposes the vicious aspects of its
deportation drive.

121:

 

Each of the following people are also a “menace”:
Francesco Costa, of Rochester, New York.

Morris Taft, of New York City.

Joseph Semashko, of Chicago, Illinois.

Mrs. Mary Baumert, of Elsinore, California.

Francesco Costa is 83 years old. Joseph Semashko is 80 years old.
Morris Taft is. just a youngster, only 74.» years old.

Even if these men were hale and hearty, they would not menace the safety
or security of the United States. All of their lives they have tried to do only
what, in their judgment, was best for their families and for the people of
this country.

These are the people who helped build this country. They laid the rail-
road tracks and the roads, dug the coal, erected the skyscrapers, and peopled
the factories. . v ’

They fought to build unions, for relief, and for unemployment insurance.
They fought for peace and for democratic rights. And, at 83 or at 74, they
maintain their allegiance to the democratic principles that have always been
an essential part of their existence.

But, a “menace” to the government?

Francesco Costa, for years a miner in Western Pennsylvania, has sili-
cosis of the lungs and a serious heart ailment. John Semashko can walk only
with the aid of a cane. Marie Kratochvil had a serious heart condition and
suffered from arthritis.

Of the 350 non-citizens arrested to date under the Walter-McCarran Law,
about 100 are over the age of 65.

Arresting these people is not law enforcement. It is cruel and extraor-
dinary harassment. It is inhuman.

The Justice Department, however, did show its concern earlier this year
when it arrested Mrs. Mary Baumert, of Elsinore, California. Appearing at
Mrs. Baumert’s home one morning to serve the deportation warrant were
two immigration agents—accompanied by a nurse. The Justice Department
knew that Mrs. Baumert, who is 73 years old and has lived in the United
States for 52 years, is ill with a serious heart condition. The nurse was along
just in case Mrs. Baumert had a heart attack while she was being arrested.

12

 

 

SOME
ARE MORE FORTUNATE . . .

Wornr Emma Grondahl

If Werner Grondahl stood erect, he would probably make six feet.

But, his body is bent with arthritis and a life-time of work as a cabinet-
maker and carpenter. In 1904, at the age of 18, he worked his way across
the ocean as a seaman and settled in this country. Some 15 years ago, he
bought a home in Manhattan Beach, a small community just outside of Los
Angeles, and settled down to gardening and making a home with his wife.

Emma Grondahl, Werner’s wife and companion, is 63, ﬁve years younger
than her husband. She too, is ill, suffering with arthritis.

But, the Grondahls are happy in their home and in their life together.
Married in 1922, their son Herman, a war veteran, is 31 and making his
own way in the world.

Looking at the Grondahls one is impressed with the feeling, that is so
much a part of them, of a good life. Obviously, they belong together.

And the Justice Department wants to deport Werner Grondahl to Finland,
where he was born 68 years ago.

What will happen to Emma Grondahl?

Is she to be left alone in this country?

No.
Emma Grondahl is to be deported to Sweden, which she left 35 years ago.

13

 

Their son? ‘'

He cannot be deported. He was born in the United States. He is free to
go with his father to Finland, or with his mother to Sweden, or stay in the
United States.

Some, however, are more fortunate.

m Lars August Berg is 78 years old and has lived in the United States for
50 years. He faces deportation to Sweden. His wife, Sabina, 70 years old, has
lived here 43 years. Lars and Sabina Berg, residents of Los Angeles, are not
threatened with separation. Sabina Berg also faces deportation to Sweden.

Mary and Nick Karman, of New York, were both born in Yugoslavia
and face deportation, therefore, to the same country. Their son, however,
was born in this country and cannot be deported. At the age of 14, Peter
Karman is to be orphaned by the Walter-McCarran Law.

Can the Justice Department be so cruel, so unfeeling, so inhuman?

Yes.

The Justice Department is cruel and unfeeling and inhuman —— in the
cases of the Grondahls, the Bergs, the Karmans, and in the cases of thousands
of other non-citizens.

Leon Callow and his family

CRUMBLING CORNERSTONES

Americans believe in the sanctity of the home.

Community, religious, fraternal, and political leaders regularly oin the
parade, telling the American people that the family is the cornerstone of our
American society.

But, with the Walter-McCarran Law functioning, these sentiments take
on a hollow ring.

They are meaningless in the face of what confronts thousands of Ameri-
can families as a result of the Walter-McCarran Law.

Niles, Ohio, is some 20 miles west of Youngstown. It is a community
of 18,000 people. For the past 19 years, Leon Callow has lived in Niles and
worked in Youngstown steel mills. Big, heavy set, of Macedonian descent,
Callow served as president of his CIO Steelworkers Union local during the war.

In 1945, Callow started to build his own home on an acre of ground he
had bought. Every day, after ﬁnishing work in the steel mill, he would work
on his house. He laid each brick himself. Week-ends, he worked around the
clock. It was the only way he could house himself, his wife, and their eight
children.

15

 

Finally, the one-story rambling brick home was nnished. It had been
hard work, especially after a full day’s labor in the steel mill. But, his family
had a home. \

Then, in March 1948, Leon Callow was arrested in deportation pro-
ceedings.

Youngstown, Ohio, has only one daily newspaper, “The Vindicator.”
It trumpeted Leon Callow’s arrest and maintained a relentless ﬁre of hysteria-
provoking stories about the “dangerous red” unearthed in Niles.

When Leon Callow was released on bail and reported back to his job,
where he had six years’ seniority and was supposed to have union protection,
he was barred from the plant.

For six months, the Callow family lived on $26 a week unemployment
insurance. There were eight children and two adults. For another three
months theylived without even that.

Then Leon Callow got another job, starting at the bottom of the ladder.
Two days later, he was ﬁred because he was Leon Callow. That happened on
four other jobs in the next two months. With the sixth job, the harassment
ended.

The Justice Department charges that Leon Callow was a member of the
Communist Party from 1928 to 1930. Therefore, in 1954, he should be
deported to Greece, where he was born.

In 1950, a ninth child was born to the Callows. Ten American citizens
would be thrown on relief if Leon Callow is deported.

Is the Callow home any less sacred because its head and bread-winner
is not a citizen?

Of the 350 non-citizens arrested in deportation proceedings, about 320
have children and grandchildren, almost all have a husband or wife or
parents from whom they would be separated.

Eusebio Mejia, of Norwalk, California, is 60 years old. He came to the
United States from Mexico 38 years ago. Two years ago his wife died,
leaving him alone to provide a home for their seven young children, all of
whom were born in the United States. Now, Eusebio Mejia faces deportation
to Mexico.

Elias Espinoza, of Orange, California, is 56 years old and has lived in
the United States for 50 years. Father of 8 American-born children, he faces
deportation to Mexico and separation from his wife and family.

In Cleveland, Ohio, Mary Todorovich, 59 years old, faces deportation
to Yugoslavia after having lived in the United States for 40 years. Living in
Cleveland are her 8 children and 17 grandchildren, from whom she would
be separated if deported.

16

 

 

The Espinoza family

Some families have special problems.

William Sentner, Jr., of St. Louis, is 16 years old. His sister, Susan Jo,
is 12. Their mother, Antonia, has been ordered deported to Yugoslavia. Their
father, William, has been sentenced to serve a ﬁve-year jail sentence under
the Smith Act. Billie and Susan can go to Yugoslavia with their mother, or
stay in St. Louis and see their father once a month in some American jail.

Mrs. Annie Hobson, of Seattle, was ordered deported for the first time
in 1934. But, England would not accept her as a deportee. Now, for a second
time, the Justice Department is seeking her deportation to England. Mrs.
Hobson’s daughter, Mignon Wellman, of Detroit, is threatened with deporta-
tion to Canada. Mrs. Hobson’s son.-in-law, Saul Wellman, of Detroit, has
been sentenced to serve ﬁve years in jail under the Smith Act. What is to
happen to Saul and Mignon Wellman’s two young children?

When Jose Estrada, of San Antonio, Texas, was kidnapped by the Justice
Department and deported to Mexico in May 1952, he left behind his wife
and 13 American-born children, two of whom had served honorably in the
United States Army during the second World War.

When Charles Doyle was deported in 1953, he left four children and two
grandchildren in Buffalo, probably never to see them again. His second wife,
a native-born American citizen, left behind her son and daughter in order to
accompany her husband to his new home in Scotland.

17

 

When Miriam Stevenson was deported to England in 1953, her liusband
and 23-year-old son remained in Los Angeles, where they are now living while
she lives in London.

Multiply these heartaches, these forced separations, these exiles by
thousands in order to weigh the effect of the 12,000 political deportations the

_ Justice Department plans under the Walter-McCarran Law.

Mothers torn from their children. . . . Husbands separated from their

_ wives. . . . Men and women leaving their brothers and sisters. . . .

Did someone say that the family is the cornerstone of our American

_ society? /

In that case, the cornerstone is crumbling. A

Frank Borich Harry. Bridges

YOU ARE NEVER FREE

It is perhaps just as well that neither the Justice Department nor
Congress has anything to do with making up rules that govern baseball and
tennis and football and other sports.

If the administration of the sport world were under the Attorney
General, it would spell the end of baseball as a national pastime.

Fortunately for the American people, the Justice Department has no
control over sports.

Unfortunately for the foreign born, the Justice Department does control
the rules and regulations governing their entry and right to live here.

If the Justice Department tries to deport a non-citizen and fails, they
get Congress to amend the law so that they can try again on a new basis.

They have been “playing” with Harry Bridges that way for the past
20 years.

Harry Bridges came here from Australia in 1920. In 1934, he emerged
as a leader of the West Coast waterfront strike and was elected president
of the newly-established International Longshoremen’s and Warehousemen’s
Union. The same year, he was investigated by the Immigration and Na-
turalization Service, which found that there were no grounds for initiating
deportation proceedings against him.

In 1938, he was arrested in deportation proceedings. After months of
hearings, Dean James M. Landis, of the Harvard Law School, held that

Bridges was not subject to deportation. The proceedings were cancelled.

After Congress amended the law in 1940, new deportation proceedings
were initiated against Bridges. This time, on the basis of the same evidence

ABOUT THE AUTHOR

ABNER GREEN is executive secretary of the American Committee for
Protection of Foreign Born. He has ﬁlled this post since 1942, and,
previous to that, served as educational director and Washington
Legislative Representative for the Committee. A native of New York,
Mr. Green has been actively engaged in the ﬁeld of civil A rights for
the past eighteen years.

The American Committee for Protection of Foreign Born was or-
ganized in 1932 and has functioned since then as an agency assisting
non-citizens and naturalized citizens with problems arising as -a result
of their foreign birth. The Committee maintains a Naturalization Aid
Service and is currently defending more than 350 non-citizens who
face deportation and 60 naturalized citizens threatened with revocation
of their citizenship because of their political opinions under the
Walter-McCarran Law.

Dean Landis heard, the presiding inspector ordered Bridges deported. In
1945, the United States Supreme Court threw out the Bridges deportation
case and this second attempt to deport him failed, too.

Already then, nine years ago, U. S. Supreme Court Justice Frank Murphy
said of the proceedings against Bridges that, “The record in this case will
stand forever as a monument to man’s intolerance of man. Seldom if ever
in the history of this nation has there been such a concentrated and relent-
less crusade to deport an individual because he dared to exercise the
freedom that belongs to him as a human being and that is guaranteed to
him by the Constitution.”

In 1945, Harry Bridges became an American citizen.

Ordinarily, that might have been the end of it. But Harry Bridges is a
leader of a militant trade union, a ﬁghter for the things in which he believes.

In 1949, Bridges was indicted for perjury on the basis of his answers
in his application for citizenship. Found guilty in 1950, he was sentenced
to serve ﬁve years in jail and had his citizenship cancelled. In 1953, the
United States Supreme Court threw out the perjury conviction and restored
Harry Bridges’ citizenship. ’

In August 1954, just 20 years after the ﬁrst investigation, argument
started in the United States District Court in San Francisco on a Justice
Department motion to revoke Harry Bridges’ citizenship.

Well, Harry Bridges is a “controversial” ﬁgure. He has made enemies
of people who wield inﬂuence in the government. No one else has been
followed up and hounded this way for 20 years.

N 0 one else?

Did you ever hear of John Greenberg?

John Greenberg never was president of any union. John Greenberg
never led any strikes. He is a dentist and has lived most of his life in San
Antonio, Texas. For the past 21 years, the Immigration and Naturalization
Service has been trying to deport him.

In 1933, Dr. Greenberg was ordered deported but Rumania refused to
accept him. Over the years, the Service tried repeatedly to get travel docu-

' ments for Dr. Greenberg. In 1948, the case was again reopened.

Dr. John Greenberg was born in Rumania and lived there for the
ﬁrst 22 years of his 1ife——from 1885 to 1907. He lived in Austria for 9
months in 1907. He has lived in the United States for 47 years, since 1907.
In 1954, the Justice Department ordered Dr. John Greenberg, at the age
of 69, deported—to Austria! ’

Anyone else?

Relief oﬂicials in Luzerne County, Pennsylvania, called her “That

Dangerous Woman” because Stella Petrofsky fought so hard and so well
to win relief for miners’ families. Then, in 1935, Stella Petrofsky was

20

 

 

I

arrested for deportation on the ground that she was a member of the Com-
munist Party. Born in 1898, she came to this country from Poland in 1914.

The people of Wilkes-Barre and vicinity rallied to Mrs. Petrofsky’s
defense. Protest meetings were held. Petitions were circulated.

In March 1936, Mrs. Petrofsky took her six small children to Wash-
ington and saw Secretary of Labor Frances Perkins, since the Immigration
and Naturalization Service was at that time a part of the Labor Department.

Two months later, Secretary of Labor Perkins announced that the de-
portation proceedings against Mrs. Stella Petrofsky were being cancelled.

Sixteen years later, Stella Petrofsky is the mother of 9 grown children
and has 16 grandchildren. She is 56 years old, living in Philadelphia. For
the second time, Stella Petrofsky was arrested in 1952 and held for de-
portation on exactly the same “evidence” that was thrown out in 1936.

Frank Borich was arrested in deportation proceedings in Pittsburgh
in March 1932. Born in Yugoslavia in 1899, Borich crossed the ocean alone
at the age of 14 to join his father in the United States.

When arrested, Frank Borich was married to an American citizen and
was serving as executive secretary of the National Miners’ Union. Three
months after F rank’s arrest, Mary Borich gave birth to twins, two girls.

Frank Borich’s deportation to Yugoslavia in 1933 was prevented only
as the result of a special appeal to the Federal courts. Then, in 1934, while
the Borich case was pending before the United States Supreme Court, Secre-
tary of Labor Frances Perkins offered to cancel the proceedings if Borich
withdrew the Court appeal.

Frank Borich was a free man. He no longer faced deportation. He
went on working. His daughters grew up, both of them excellent students.

Except that a non-citizen is never really free.

On July 11, 1949, Frank Borich was arrested a second time and held

for deportation on exactly the same charges as those levelled against him
in 1932.

More than 25 non-citizens have had deportation proceedings pend-
ing against them since before 1935. For more than 20 years, these men

and women have lived with the threat of deportation hanging over their
heads.

Harry Bridges, Dr. John Greenberg, Stella Petrofsky, Frank Borich
and many others have demonstrated, in their reaction to this constant op-

pression over the years and to the repeated harassments, that this isindeed
“the home of the brave.”

But, they obviously could seriously question the validity of the claim
that this is also “the land of the free.”

Martin Young and son:

IWTHEY CAl*l’T'.$TOP ME FROM THINKINCA.-3

I‘ Listen for a moment‘ to Martin Young tell about things that are becom-
ing all too common in the life of the American people. A I V '
“‘In October 1951, I was arrested in: deportation proceedings on the
charge of past membership in the Communist Party. I
“Worse than deportation proceedings at the time "Was the denial of bail.
While the Justice Department fed and "housed--‘me ‘free of charge,’ my wife
and two young sons had to eat. V "
“Relatives and friends came to my family’s assistance.
V-“When the Justice Department found there was ‘no country to which
~ I could'~be sent—which it had known all along since I was born in Russia—
I was released after one year of imprisonment.
“I had committed no crime. I had harmed no one. But, I sat in jail
forone year. I L I 4 I . ’ _ I I
“When released from Ellis _Island in October_,1952,’I resumed my normal ;
life, ‘working and supporting my family. Except, something new ‘had, been
added. Wllen released, I was placed on Supervisory" Parole.‘
"4‘*-*3 “I- ‘li’ad'=-to'"report in person to an , inspector “at Ellis Island once a week.
If I didn’t report, I could be sent to jail for one year. The process of ‘reporting’
takes at least four hours of a day’s time. I was fortunate. I got time off from
my job every Tuesday‘ morning.

Q2

 

 

Rose Nelson

“Others have not been -so fortunate. Some’ non-citizens have not been
able to get a job for months at a time because they have to tell a prospective
employer that they are non-citizens ordered deported and. have to. have a
morning a week off in order to report at Ellis Island. Others have. not been
able to keep_a job for more than a month at~a time." ' - ~ ~ 

“When released on Supervisory Parole,’ I was ‘told that Iihald 't'o*'-atislwer
questions when I report and that I had to stop any political or social activities
which did not have the approval of the Attorney General.

“I was told that, if I failed to live up to these conditions, I could be
indicted and sent to jail for one year.

“But, it is humanly impossible to live under these conditions. Some
non-citizens would have to get a divorce or refuse to have anything to do
with their own children. You could be sent to jail for thinking.

“Each Tuesday, when I report, the inspector starts asking me questions.

Do you live at the same address?

Are you working at the same place?

Were you arrested during the past week?

Did you attend any meetings?

Whom did you see?

23

 

“To all questions, other than my name and address and place of employ-

ment, I ‘ refuse answers.

“I have seen inspectors try to bully non-citizens and try to force answers
from them. I have seen inspectors insult women and threaten elderly people
with jail because they refuse to become stool-pigeons or informers.

“It is unbelievable. Unless you have been unfortunate enough to have
had to stand in that room where non-citizens report, you cannot begin to
realize what is being done to people. I became accustomed almost to the
weekly trip to Ellis Island. But, I could never get used to the brutal manner
in which people are treated there.”

Martin Young doesn’t exaggerate.

The inspectors at Ellis Island are completely unrestrained in their insult-
ing manner.

Last year, when Mrs. Rose Nelson reported at Ellis Island one week,
among the questions thrown at her were:

“Why don’t you get a job and go to work?”

“What do you do with your time?”

“Who cleans your‘ home for you?”

“Who does shopping for you?”

Rose Nelson has spent her life organizing women’s groups and partici-
pating in the leadership of fraternal organizations. She has earned the
admiration and respect of the people with whom she has worked. These
insults directed‘ at her, and thrown at countless other non-citizens, are
shocking. I

The constitutionality of the Supervisory Parole conditions of the Walter-
McCarran Law is being tested in 14- cases in the Federal courts by the
New York Committee for Protection of Foreign Born and will be fought,
if necessary, to the United States Supreme Court.

 

 

    

TRIBUTES TO THE PAST, ONLY

Cedric Belfruge

“Freedom of the press” is perhaps even more popular with the state-
ment-makers and the speech-makers than “sanctity of the American home.”

If not more popular, it is at least a close second.

By his trials and tribulations in the 18th century, John Peter Zenger
established freedom of the press ﬁrmly as a part of the American way of
life.

Therefore, when Cedric Belfage in 1954 edits a newspaper whose editoral
policies McCarthy doesn’t like, they can’t throw Belfrage into jail or ban
his newspaper. N 0, there is freedom of press in the United States.

Cedric Belfrage is free to speak and to write as he pleases, to edit
his paper as he sees ﬁt--from a cell on Ellis Island.

Cedric‘ Belfrage came to the United States from England in 1926.
In 1941, he went to work for the British security unit engaged in the war
against Hitler Germany. In 1944 and in 1945, he worked in France and
Germany with the Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Forces under
direct control of the United States Army. at

As a newspaperman and writer, Belfrage was assigned to help establish
anti-Nazi newspapers in Germany after the war.

In 1945, he returned to the United States. In 1947, the FBI and the
New York Grand Jury conducted an extensive investigation of Cedric
Belfrage’s work in Europe and in the United States as a part of an hysteria-
provoking “spy-hunt.” Nothing came of the investigation.

In 1949, Belfrage helped found the “National Guardian,” a weekly
newspaper dedicated to the cause of peace and the preservation of civil
rights in the United States.

Despite the fact that the records of the 1947 investigation were available,
another “investigation” of Belfrage was launched in 1953. On May 5th, the
House Committee on Un-American Activities “investigated” Cedric Bel-
frage. Then, the McCarthy Committee of the United States Senate hauled
Belfrage to Washington for public hearings on May 14th. A representative of

25

  

the Justice Department sat through the Belfrage hearings on the invitation
of the Committee’s counsel. -

Cedric Belfrage refused to submit to the Committee and exercised his
rights under the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States.
As a result, the Committee threatened him with deportation.

On May 15th, two immigration agents walked into the oﬂice of “The
National Guardian” in New York City and arrested Cedric Belfrage for
deportation. He was held on Ellis Island without bail but was released one
month later by a decision in the Federal District Court on 335,000 bail after
the frame-up nature of the proceedings were exposed in Court.

Cedric Belfrage is only one editor.

Al Richmond, the editor of the “Daily People’s World,” of San Fran-
cisco, and John Steuben, editor of “March of Labor,” of New York, are
threatened with loss of citizenship, which both obtained while members of
the armed forces during the second World War.

In one newspaper, “The Jewish Morning F reiheit,”_ of New York, the
editor, Paul Novick, and an editorial writer, Sol Almazov Pearl, face de-
naturalization, while the labor editor, Paul Yuditch, and the Midwest repre-
sentative, Moses Resnikoif, of Chicago, face deportation. In another, the
“Nardoni Glasnik,” Croatian-American weekly, the editor and assistant editor
face denaturalization, while a reporter faces deportation.

The editors or former editors of newspapers published in the following
languages face deportation or denaturalization:

Croatian
Estonian
Finnish
Hungarian
Jewish
Korean
Lithuanian
Russian

Add to this the fact that the editors of Bulgarian, Greek, Italian, and

-Polish newspapers have been deported already in the course of the Walter-

McCarran Law hysteria. . .
The people erect statues and memorials to John Peter Zenger for his

How LONG?

 

Lena Halverson

If you live in New York City then Portland, Oregon, is some 3,000
miles away from home.

But, when you sit in the Halverson living room, you feel that you are
at home. The feeling of security and peace ﬁlls the atmosphere.

Lena Halverson speaks in a slow, ‘hesitant manner, as though she were
unfamiliar with the language. Born in Sweden in 1885, she came to the
United States to stay with a sister in Colorado in 1903, at the age of 18.
After 50 years, her speech retains an unmistakable Swedish accent.

In 1920, Lena Halverson and her husband moved to Portland with their
two young children. In 1930, her husband died and she later married Martin
Halverson.

Lena’s diﬂiculties date back to the 1934 longshore strike when she
was working in the soup kitchen in Portland. The Portland “Red Squad”
raided her home and carted away all the literature it could ﬁnd. Lena didn’t
care. The longshore workers won their strike.

But, in 1945, when Lena Halverson tried to became a United States
citizen, the Judge denied her citizenship because she had worked in that
soup kitchen and had done many other things the Portland “Red Squad”
didn’t like.

But, Lena didn’t care. She didn’t like the Portland “Red Squad.” She
had lived already 42 of her 60 years without citizenship. She was sorry she
couldn’t be a citizen. But, the Portland “Red Squad” wasn’t going to in-
timidate her.

27

Then, in August 1949, the Justice Department arrested Mrs. Lena Hal-
verson for deportation to Sweden.

She was 64 years old. She had lived in this country 46 years. Her
two sons were 43 and 41 years of age, both married, and they had four

children, _ her grandchildren.

But, her husband, Martin, now 71 years old, was ill and bed-ridden.
She had taken a job as caretaker of Linnea Hall, in Portland, in order to
maintain a home for him. She couldn’t leave him.

As Lena speaks, the atmosphere changes. You feel yourself getting angry.

 

You ﬁnd you are outraged by what is threatening Lena and Martin’ Halversonf

and hundreds of others like them throughout the United‘States.

F orty-six years of living in the United States. . . .

How long is one supposed to live in the United States before one has
a right to live here?

What kind of government is it that treats people in this manner?

Lena Halverson, at the age of 69, is forced to ﬁghtagainst deportation
in order to remain in the United States, where she belongs.

 

A TARNISHED MEDAL

Maria Cruz

When Joseph Cruz, son of a Mexican immigrant, came back
from the war in 1945, he was a hero.

Jesus and Maria Cruz beamed happily at their son, taking pride in his
accomplishment and relieved that he had escaped unhurt. Pinned on Joseph’s
chest was an Oak Leaf Cluster awarded to this United States Air Force gunner
on the completion of 30 hazardous missions over Germany during the second

World War.

Joseph Cruz went back to civilian life in his native city of Los Angeles.
The Oak Leaf Cluster was put away in a drawer.

It was good to be home after three years. He was surprised to see how
his younger brother had grown. When he left, Carlos was an infant. But,
already, he was running into the street playing with the other kids on the
block. Next year, he would be going to school.

Five years after Joseph returned from the war, the same government
that had pinned an Oak Leaf Cluster on his chest pinned a warrant of
arrest on his father.

In 1952, Jesus Cruz was deported to Mexico on the charge of past mem-
bership in the Communist Party.

In 1953, word came from Mexico that Jesus Cruz had died and had
been buried in his native town.

Joseph became the family’s main support. His mother was 50‘ years
old. His brother, now 13, was attending a junior high school in Los Angeles.

INTRODUCTION

 

IN 1912, almost one million immigrants entered the United States.
One of them was a 23-year-old actor from England by the name of Charles
Chaplin.

In a few years, this immigrant from England came to be known
affectionately by young and old as Charlie Chaplin. His walk and his cane
and his moustache and his pantomine amused and delighted generations of
Americans. His art and creations became an integral part of our culture and
our society. _

In 1952, Charlie Chaplin decided to visit England on a com-
bined business and pleasure trip. It was his ﬁrst visit to his native land since
he came to this country in 1912.

Before leaving the United States, Charlie Chaplin applied to
the Immigration and Naturalization Service for a re-entry permit. The
Service granted him a re-entry permit good for six months and told him
that, if need be, he could extend it for another six months in London.

He didn’t expect to be gone for six months. He planned to
return in less time than that.

But, after he left and was on the high seas, the Attorney
General, in Washington, announced that the Justice Department was can-
celling Charlie Chaplin’s re-entry permit and would exclude him from the
country if he should try to return to the United States.

If the Justice Department hadn’t promised that he would be
allowed to re-enter, Charlie Chaplin probably would not have left the country.
If he hadn’t left the country, Charlie Chaplin could not be deported since
he was a legally-resident non-citizen and was not in violation of any law.
Charlie Chaplin was “deported” by a trick after he had lived in this country
for 40 years.

But, what happened to Charlie Chaplin is not unusual in the
United States today. Many non-citizens ﬁnd themselves being treated in the
same shabby and underhanded manner. Many non-citizens ﬁnd their lives
disrupted and their homes uprooted by the same forces that succeeded in
“deporting” Charlie Chaplin despite the fact that he is loved and respected
by the American people.

 

New trouble developed for the Cruz family.

One day, shortly after word came of Jesus Cruz’s death, Maria Cruz
lost her pocketbook and, with it, her Alien Registration Card. As required
by the Walter-McCarran Law, she applied immediately for a new card.

Mrs. Cruz had been brought to the United States by her_ father in
1908, when she was ﬁve years old, and had lived here since.

Immigration ofﬁcials used the pretext of the lost Alien Registration
Card to subject Mrs. Cruz to all kinds of questioning. 0

They showed her a picture of her dead husband and wanted to know‘

whether he had been a member of the Communist Party. They wanted to
know the names of her dead husband’s friends in Los Angeles. They wanted
to know why Mrs. Cruz h'ad belonged to the International Workers Order
and the National Association of Mexican-Americans. They wanted to know
about J oseph’s political beliefs and about his associations in Los Angeles.

To all these questions, Mrs. Cruz refused answers.

For four long months they kept hounding her.

Then, in February 1954, two immigration agents accompanied by a
..natron, appeared at the Cruz home to arrest Maria Cruz and hold her for
deportation to Mexico. ’

Joseph Cruz couldn’t believe what was happening before. his eyes. He
had heard many stories about how Mexican immigrantsl were treated by
the Justice Department—rounded up and arrested without warrants,’ denied
the right to consult counsel, refused the slightest human consideration,
summarily shipped to the border like so many heads of cattle and dumped
into Mexico. (During 1953, almost 1,000,000 persons were deported to
Mexico in exactly this manner.) ’ i

This was a familiar story to Joseph Cruz. ‘And, in front of him, the
matron said she was going to search Maria Cruz for “weapons and narcot-
ics.” A wave of disgust overwhelmed Joseph and he protested this treatment
of his mother. Maria Cruz was taken to Terminal Island without any search.

The Oak Leaf Cluster rests still in a drawer in the Cruz’ home. '

Joseph hasn’t looked at it lately. i '

The next time he looks in that drawer Joseph Cruz will discover probably
that the medal he once wore so proudly has tarnished somewhat.

Leonard Costa and his family

HE COULDN'T TELL A LIE

Francesco Costa came here from Italy in 1904 with his wife
and three-month-old son, Leonard, and settled in a small mining town in
Western Pennsylvania. He went to work in the coal mines to support himself
and his family.

Nine months after arriving in this country, one-year-old Leonard fell
from a window and was killed.

Francesco was heart-broken. But, a year later, there was rejoicing again
in the Costa_home when another son was born. This second son, as is the
custom in some immigrant communities, was given the same name as the
mourned ﬁrst-born-—Leonard. With the passage of the years, seven more
children were born to Francesco Costa and his wife.

Leonard Costa, native-born American, grew up in the mining towns of
Western Pennsylvania. When Francesco’s health started to fail, as the result
of silicosis contracted in the mines, the family moved to Rochester.

Leonard married an American citizen and became the father of two
children. He was elected president of Local 14«-B of the Amalgamated Clothing
Workers of America, CIO, for eight consecutive years. He became active in
local politics and ran for public oﬂice on the American Labor Party ticket.

Then, one Monday morning in November 1952, shortly after the elec-
tions, immigration agents arrested Leonard Costa and held him for deporta-
tion. They claimed he was born in Italy in 1903, had entered the United States

31

 

at the age of three months, had never become an American citizen, and was
subject to deportation for past membership in the Communist Party.

But, Leonard Costa was born in the United States in 1905.

Go back 47 years and try to prove you were born, if you were born in
a Pennsylvania mining town. Birth never recorded. Your brother’s death never
recorded.

All your life an American citizen. Now, prove it.

Perhaps, if you had joined the Young Republicans and gone to work
for the NAM, you might not have had to prove you were born. But, you
organized workers into unions and joined the American Labor Party. You
are a “red” and, therefore, you have to prove you were born, Leonard Costa.

But, there is one living eye-witness who could testify as to Leonard
Costa’s place and manner of birth.

Francesco Costa is still alive. His eight children had presented him with
20 grandchildren and two great-grandchildren. At 83, he is sick with a serious
heart ailment, silicosis of the lung, and arthritis. V

But, there is nothing the matter with F rancesco’s memory. He knows
where his oldest living son was born. He knows how his first-born died.

The Justice Department went after Francesco Costa. His ill-health and
his age didn’t deter them in their efforts to make him bear false witness against
his own son.

Francesco Costa couldn’t tell a lie, despite the threats and intimidations
of the Justice Department. He stuck to the facts as he had lived them.

Francesco Costa couldn’t tell a lie.

Millions of American school-children, as well as adults, are fond of the
story about another American who “couldn’t tell a lie.” The ﬁgure of George
Washington is made a bit more romantic and a degree prouder by the story
of the cherry tree.

George Washington, of course, was never arrested for deportation.

But, on July 16, 1953, Francesco Costa, 83 years old, was arrested for
deportation to Italy because he couldn’t tell a lie.

NO ONE IS SAFE!

They banged on Charles Tuteur’s door one night and woke him. A

They ransacked his apartment and discovered “subversive” literature.

Two days later, a decree in the newspaper cancelled Charles Tuteur’s
citizenship.

But, that can’t happen here!

It didn’t.

That happened in Cologne, Germany—under the Nazis——in 1938.

Charles Tuteur escaped with his life and found his way to the United
States. After Pearl Harbor, he volunteered for the Army but was rejected

for physical reasons. He got a job in the Tacoma, Washington shipyards
and felt that he was helping in some way to defeat the Nazis.

He married and applied for naturalization. In 1945, he became an
American citizen. ’ I

After the war, Tuteur and his wife moved to Chicago. In “I949, a
daughter, Judy, was born.

Then, they banged on Charles Tuteur’s “door” one night and woke
him.

They ransacked his “mind” and discovered “subversive” literature.
Two days later, court proceedings to cancel Charles Tuteur’s citizenship.
That can happen here.

It did--in Chicago, Illinois, in June 1951.

The Justice Department seeks to cancel Charles Tuteur’s citizenship

on the ground that he read “subversive” literature before he became an
American citizen.

When questioned by a naturalization examiner in Tacoma in 1944 as
to what periodicals he read, Charles Tuteur answered “Life,” “Time,” and
daily newspapers. But, the Justice Department claims, the “New Masses”
and the “People’s Daily World” were also delivered to his home by mail.
Therefore, the Justice Department says, his citizenship should be cancelled.

The Attorney General has issued dozens of statements about his de-
naturalization program.

Why so much smoke?

Is the Attorney General trying to pull a fast one?

Is there more than meets the eye?

United States citizenship is a treasured possession. But, there is one
peculiar thing about United States citizenship. Whether you obtained it
by birth or by naturalization, your rights as a citizen are the same.

33

That is what our Constitution says. That is’ the way it works out in
the everyday life of the country. \

Perhaps, you may appreciate why the Attorney General’s oﬂice in
Washington is so busy making smoke. In order to becloud the issues and
confuse the people. Under the Walter-McCarran Law, citizenship obtained
by naturalization can be attacked at the political whim and caprice of the
Attorney General.

But, it is United States citizenship that is being attacked. It is
United States citizenship, whether obtained by birth or naturalization, that

is being cheapened. To this extent, the citizenship of all Americans, native

born as well as foreign born, is undermined.

The Attorney General says that he will seek to revoke the citizenship
of 10,000 naturalized Americans‘ on political grounds. " ‘

Charles Tuteur is one of them.

Stanley Nowak is another. Stanley Nowak became an American citizen
in Detroit in 1938. Immediately after he became a citizen, Stanley Nowak
was elected as a Democrat from the 5th Senatorial District to" the Michigan
State Senate. He was re-elected four times and served as a State Senator for
ten years. For two of those years,Ahe was I Minority Leader of the Michigan
State Senate. N ow, proceedings are pending in the Federal District Court in
Detroit to revoke Stanley Nowak’s citizenship.

Isidore Begun, of New York City, was indicted under the Smith Act,
with 16 others, in 1951. In 1952, Federal District Court Judge Dimock dis-
missed the charges as to Isidore Begun at theconclusion of the,government’s
case. In February 1953, the Justice Department started proceedings to
revoke Begun’s citizenship. ‘V " ' I A

Isidore Begun was born in Russia in December 1903. He was brought to
the United States in April 1904, when four months old. In December .1924‘,

John Steuben, labor leader and editor of “March of Labor,” became
a citizen in 1943, while" wearing the uniform of the United States Army.
The country was at war and John Steuben was a soldier. ’

The Justice Department now says that Steuben’s service in the armed
forces means nothing. : ' ‘ '

Steve Tsermegas Nick Tsermogas

A HAVEN OF REFUGE

Nick Tsermegas came to the United States from Greece in 1926. His
brother, Steve, followed him in 1927.

In 1937, Steve went to Spain to ﬁght fascism as a member of the
International Brigades. In 1939, he returned to this country.

Both brothers were active in the democratic‘ and peace movement in
the United States.

Steve served as Midwest representative of the “Greek-American Tribune,”
a weekly newspaper. On December 8, 1953, he was arrested in Chicago in
deportation proceedings and held without bail in Cook County Jail.

Nick was secretary of the Hellenic American Brotherhood of the In-
ternational Workers Order. On February 3, 1954-, he was arrested in New
York in deportation proceedings and held without bail on Ellis Island.

Both were charged with past membership in the Communist Party.
In Chicago and in New York, attorneys for the two brothers fought un-
successfully to win their release on bail. Hearings resulted in deportation

orders for both brothers.

Counsel for the brothers emphasized that both faced persecution if
deported to Greece since they are anti-fascists and have opposed the die-
tatorial regime ruling in their native land.

The Walter-McCarran Law provides that no person shall be deported
to any country where he faces “physical persecution.” But, the Law gives
the Attorney General unchallengeable discretion to decide whether the de-
portee will face “physical persecution” in any given country.

36

 

 

The Attorney General makes his “decision” without having to support
it by any facts and the Courts have invariably refused to interfere with the
Attorney General’s discretion in matters of this sort.

The Attorney General has ruled that anti-fascists will not face physical
persecution if returned to Greece.

Nick and Steve Tsermegas did not face physical persecution in Greece?
They faced death.

Just before Steve’s arrest in December 1953, the brothers received a
letter, smuggled out of Greece, from their 78-year-old mother.

For more than two years, they had heard nothing from their mother.
Now came news of their family.

Their sister and her husband had been exiled to a distant town.
Their mother, at the age of 78, had just been released after having

i been imprisoned for two years in the dread Makronissos concentration camp.

On her release, she was ordered to live in a town about "100 miles distant
from her home. The Tsermegas home, where the family had been born and
raised, was burned to the ground by the Greek government.‘ Mrs. Tsermegas
was ordered not to step foot in her native town, on penalty of death.

Why this persecution of a 78-year-old woman? Why were her daughter
and son-in-law exiled?

Because Mrs. Tsermegas refused to divulge the whereabouts of still
another son, a leader in the Greek anti-fascist underground movement.

Nick and Steve Tsermegas made a last-minute appeal to the People’s

Republic of Poland.

The Polish government granted both asylum.

There was a time when the United States was a haven of refuge, an
asylum for those threatened with persecution.

There was a time when Emma Lazarus expressed this proud American
tradition in the words now inscribed on the base of the Statue of Liberty:

“Give me your tired, your poor,
Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free,
The wretched refuse of your teeming shore,
Send these, the homeless, tempest-tossed, to me.
I lift my lamp beside the golden door.”

There was a time when the New World served as a haven for the
persecuted.

Now the weary steps of the political refugee turn back to what used
to be called the Old World.

THEY KILL PEOPLE, TOO

Refugio Roman Martinez

Refugio Roman Martinez came to the United States from Mexico on
May 1, 1924. c

He was 21 years old. Young, healthy, energetic.

He went to Chicago and got a job in a packing-house. Working condi-
tions were miserable and the pay worse. Time and again the employers

. succeeded in dividing packinghouse workers—-Poles against Mexicans against

Italians against Negroes—and prevented union organization of the plants.

In 1931, Martinez started to work for union organization of packing-
house workers. He distributed leaflets in front of the plants, and was
repeatedly beaten up or arrested for his pains. He organized and participated
in meetings. He visited workers in their homes.

In 1936, Martinez threw himself into the CIO organizing drive, con-
centrating all of his energies among Mexican workers. His efforts met with
all kinds of obstacles but each obstacle was surmounted by his determination
and spirit. .

A union was organized—the United Packinghouse Workers of America,
CIO.

Refugio Roman Martinez continued his work as a union organizer. He
fought for higher wages and better working conditions, for an end to all
discrimination. He married and became the father of two girls. He gave

of his time and energies freely to other Mexican communities, in the South-.

west and in California.

Martinez was a warm, cordial, friendly person. Always, he responded
with a ready smile. Always, he was prepared to help, to counsel, to assist.

38

 

 

The union was his life, helping a fellow-Mexican his creed. He had seen
so much suffering, so much hardship and starvation in the Mexican com-
munity that his entire life was devoted to ending discrimination and its
effects, to wiping out starvation and misery.

Then, in January 1947, the Justice Department arrested Refugio
Roman Martinez in deportation proceedings based on the charge that he
had been a member of the Communist Party in 1934. The Union came to
his defense, provided him with counsel and a defense committee.

’ The ﬁght against Martinez’ threatened deportation started. Unions and
organizations throughout the country came to his support. The Mexican
community rallied to his defense. Protest meetings and activities throughout
the country were organized.

The main inspiration and spark-plug in the ﬁght against deportation
was Martinez himself. He knew deportation to be a weapon used by the
Justice Department against Mexicans. He felt this to be another opportunity
to strike a blow against the discrimination suffered by Mexicans in the
United States.

Refugio Roman Martinez was ordered deported to Mexico. His case
was appealed to the Federal courts.

The Federal District Court in Chicago sustained his deportation and
an appeal was taken to the Federal Court of Appeals.

While the case was pending on appeal, Martinez suffered a heart
attack. A month later, he had a second heart attack and, a month after
that, he suffered a stroke, which paralyzed his left arm and the left side
of his face. For several weeks, he was hospitalized. When released from the
hospital, he was ordered by his doctor to change his job.

Martinez bought a small restaurant in the Mexican community in
Chicago, which he ran with the help of his wife.

Throughout this entire period, he was concerned mainly with the
welfare of his two young children.

The Court of Appeals sustained deportation. The case was taken to
the U. S. Supreme Court, the Union continuing in its determination to defend
Martinez since it felt that he was being victimized because of his work in
organizing the Union.

The Supreme Court refused to hear the case.

Martinez’s health, meanwhile, had deteriorated seriously. His paralysis
was arrested but he had been in the hospital two more times during these
seven months.

The Justice Department ordered him to surrender for deportation to
Mexico. .

Martinez’s friends went to the Justice Department, explained his con-

39

 

 

This is their story.

A few of them, like Charlie Chaplin, are headline names. But,
most of them are people who would ordinarily not come to the attention of
their fellow-Americans.

As individuals, they are distinguished by many facets of their
personalities and lives. But, special events have forced them from relative
obscurity into the limelight of public view as “cases.” This has been a painful
process for many reasons, including the fact that most of them are average
people who do not seek the limelight. '

These people have certain things in common. _

As a group essentially varied in occupations and inclinations,
they aretied by a devotion to democratic principles, to better living and
workingconditions for the American people, to a hatred of oppression and
discrimination. -

, There is one other factor that ties them together. In recent
years, in the face of a growing hysteria, these people——like many others—
refused to deny their own beliefs, refused to submit to threats and intimida-
tion, and maintained their principles in the face of all consequences.

In one sense, they were cast in the mold out of which heroes
are made. None of them, however, feel like heroes. They are just people
doing what they feel people should do in the face of hysteria.

Their role in the public eye was forced upon them by special
events.

Despite many years of residence in this country and many
attempts to secure naturalization, they were not able to become citizens and
now face deportation and exile from the United States; or, having become
citizens, they face revocation of their naturalization, and then deportation.

Ignoring popular will and a Presidential veto, Congress passed
the Walter-McCarran Law in 1952, giving legal sanction to repression and
terror against 14,000,000 foreign-born Americans.

In 1953, speaking at a St. Patrick’s Day dinner in New York
City, the Attorney General announced his intention to use the provisions of
the Walter-McCarran Law to deport 12,000 non-citizens and to denaturalize
10,000 naturalized American citizens.

The people against whom this Walter-McCarran Law campaign
is directed? ‘ .

It is these people who wrote this pamphlet. It is their lives
and their refusal to submit to this hysteria that give these pages whatever
substance they may possess.

This is their story.

dition, brought doctors’ statements, hospital records. They urged that
Martinez be granted a stay and that his deportation be postponed for a few
weeks.

No.

The country apparently could not survive Martinez’s presence within

if its borders. He had to be deported.

Twenty-nine years before, a hale, hearty and healthy man had crossed
the border from Mexico. '

Now, paralyzed and heart-broken over the impending separation from

his two young daughters, Refugio Roman Martinez presented himself by

order of the Justice Department for deportation.

On April 28, 1953, Refugio Roman Martinez was deported from the
United States.

On May 2, 1953, Refugio Roman Martinez died of a heart attack in
Mexico at the age of 50.

 

 

DEPORTATION CANCELLED

The plane lands in Tampa and you walk
down the plank in the blistering heat. You look
around. Eric Quist waves to you from the waiting
area and you walk his way.

You go out to the car and she is there.

You ride for thirty minutes and get to the
" ‘ "  ' ‘ ' lawyer’s oﬂice. Eric goes up with you. Mary

M‘'''‘' °""' Quist waits in the auto.

Then you ride out to the farm-house. Eric guides Mary to the door. It
is done naturally because Mary is very self-conscious about the fact that she
is practically blind. She won’t go into any public place because she has to be
led and helped.

', , -Invtheir living room Mary starts talking.

Her first husband, John J andeska, died in Akron as a result of a heating
from police during an unemployed demonstration in the 1930’s. She moved
to South’ Bend and, later, married Eric Quist, a native-born American citizen
of Danish ‘descent.

'  Every strike in South Bend saw Mary in the soup kitchen, preparing
the food and serving it. Every action against discrimination found Mary in
its 3 midst, walking the picket-line, distributing leaﬂets, organizing meetings.
Her memory reaches back to the murder of Sacco and Vanzetti, the Scotts-
boro frame-ups, the ﬁght to free Tom Mooney.

The Quist living-room in the Florida farm-house echoes with memories
of-the "days that organized the C10, in steel and in auto, and the ﬁght to
support the democratic struggles of the people of Spain.

 ‘A lOl‘d and sick from a lifetime of work and worry. For the past ﬁve years,
almost blind. The Quists moved to Tampa in 1953 for Mary’s health. Then,
on November 24, 1953, Mary Quist, 70 years old, was arrested in deportation
proceedings—to be deported to Hungary after 4-4« years of living in the
United States.

41

Mary’s arrest was based on a 4«-page statement she had signedin South
Bend in 1952, after several hours of questioning by immigration officials.
She had objected to signing the statement but the immigration agents said
that she would be arrested right there if she didn’t sign,

Mary Quist didn’t know what she had signed. She never could read
English. And, anyway, at the time, her sight was already almost gone.

No witness was called at Mary’s deportation hearing in Tampa other
than Mary herself. The 4o-page statement was the only evidence against her.

Mary Quist was on the stand for two days. The immigration authorities
kept hammering away, throwing question after question at her. They wanted
her to supply information against people she was supposed. to have known
in South Bend. Her health and her age made no difference to the immigration
authorities, To them, she was not a human being. To them, she was just a
ﬁle number, a possible source of information.

The day after the hearing was closed, Mary Quist did what file numbers
cannot do. She suffered a heart attack and, for weeks, was seriously ill.

Now, Mary Quist was worried. They had been living in Tampa for only
a year. They didn’t know many people. How was she to defend herself
against the threat of deportation in this Florida community? She wanted to
ﬁght back. All of her life she had supported movements to defend civil rights.
Now, she was in need of defense.

What could she do in Tampa——sick and almost blind?

Eric Quist had written to everyone and everyplace he could think of
about Mary’s case. He had written to the American Committee for Protection
of Foreign Born, in New York.City. The American Committee sent material
and encouragement. People and organizations in South Bend held meetings.
sentprotests, raised funds.

T T The hearing officer, in Tampa, ordered Mary Quist deported to Hungary
on the charge of membership in the Communist Party in 1920, which had
been “established” on the basis of Mary’s “sworn” statement. Mary’s dis-
avowal of the statement and denials of its contents, while on the stand,‘wer
dismissed by the hearing oﬂicer as “self-seeking.” ’

The hearing oﬁicer’s decision was appealed to the Board of Immigration
Appeals in Washington.

T The American Committee sent an attorney to Washington to- argue the
appeal. a V»

On July 22, 1954, the Board of Immigration Appeals ordered the deporta-
tion proceedings against Mary Quist cancelled on the ground that there was
no case against her since she had disavowed and denied the contents of the
4‘-page statement, the only evidence presented at the hearings.

 

 

 

THE WIND BLOWS THROUGH YOUR’ HAIR

Behind you is the always-impressive sky-line of Manhattan Island,

Ahead, in the shimmering sunlight, is the hazy outline of the Statue of
Liberty.

This is the ferry to Ellis Island. ( - -

Stand on the front platform of the boat in the open air and sense the
ferry’s rhythm as it chops through the water. The wind blows through your
hair. . _ . , .
The open expanse of water, the Manhattan. sky-line and the Statue there
in the harbor merge in a sensation of democratic well-being.

This is the United States, in symbol and in a broad historical sense.

The ferry ride takes ﬁfteen minutes.

Then, a new reality takes shape. a

A guard points the way down a path to the visitors’ desk. Through a
dingy, littered areaway, up some steps, where another guard takes your pass.
On into a large r_oom with one section set apart by a wired enclosure around
which chairs are strung. I ’ _

You sit on a chair and squint through the mesh wire to visit. Features
are almost indistinguishable. This is the way husbands see wives and sweet-
hearts and friends converse in the modern America. Words and thoughts and
feelings ﬁltered through a mesh wire of a prisoner’s.visiting room. These are
non-citizens arrested in deportation proceedings and held without bail.’

The immigration authorities are very sensitive and demand that Ellis
Island be referred to as a “detention” center. It is not a jail. Men and women
held for months and years, deprived of their freedom. The only difference
between this “detention” center and a jail is that the men and women 
prisoned on Ellis Island have committed no crimes but are deprived of their
liberties solely because they are not citizens. .

Perhaps this is not a jail, since its inmates are not criminals.’ Perhaps
it can more appropriately be termed a concentration camp.

The time allowed for visits is one hour, twice a week.

If children are visiting, then the visit is held in a small room down the
hall rather than through the mesh wire. '

Last year, if you had gone along on a visit to see Charles Doyle one

43

 

Saturday, you would have found him in the small room down the hall. His
wife was there with her niece. Her son and daughter were there, too, since
Doyle was scheduled to leave for England in another two weeks. They were
saying good-bye.

I Sitting there, too, was Manuel Cuevas Diaz, playing with his two young
children, one on each lap. The smile on his lips and the laughter in his
eyes spoke eloquently of his warm, human feelings. For almost two years,
he had been separated from his family and held on Ellis Island, facing
deportation to Spain. Only special court action prevented the Justice Depart-
ment from sending Manuel Cuevas Diaz to his death in Spain. (Later, Diaz
was granted asylum as an anti-fascist by the government of Guatemala. Since
the United Fruit Company “revolution” in Guatemala, no word has been
received from Diaz. His wife and two children are living in New York.)

It is just a visit to see someone you know, to speak to them. There is
laughter, without rejoicing. The only thing real in this prison atmosphere are
the tears.

The hour is up. Last-minute farewells, until next week.

A guard points to "the aisle down the steps, through the dingy, littered
areaway. Around the walk to the waiting ferry. The ferry starts.

The visitors move out into the open front part of the ferry. As the ferry
reaches the end of the island, just before it goes out into the open water, every-
one starts to wave.

The men are there in the yard, waving through the wire fence separating
them from the lawn fronting the island.
Mrs. Diaz lifts the two children and they wave to their father.
Finally, the men are lost to sight.
This is not a jail? It looks like a concentration camp.
There is the sky-line coming up through the haze.
There is the Statue, standing proud and big.
The wind blows through your hair.
But, there is a different reality.
For there, too, rests Ellis Island.

Now you look at the proud ﬁgure of Lady Liberty and wait to hear from
her lips the cry that will warn and wake the people of this land. The Torch
held aloft in her mighty hand will some day turn its rays upon this Isle of
Tears to expose to the eyes of all the cruelties and the suffering imposed on
good and decent human beings.

Standing there in the harbor, she would undoubtedly weep, if she could.

Because, after’ all, the Statue of Liberty, too, is an immigrant—from
F rance.'

STORY WITHOUT END

The story is far from told.

At best, only a part of it can be told.

There is a dentist in San Antonio, Texas . . . A farmer in Renton,
Washington . . . A worker in Pittsburgh, Pennsyvania . . . A script writer in
Hollywood, California . . . A housewife in Gary, Indiana . . . An editor in
New York . . . ‘ .

There are 350 deportation cases and 60 denaturalization cases, as of
this writing. Each one has his or her life involved in this deportation hysteria.

To be complete, the story would have to capture in essence the thoughts
and the lives and the day-to-day existence of each one of these men and
women. One of them might be sitting next to you on the bus as you read
this pamphlet. One of them might wait on you the next time you go to a
restaurant or a department store.

One of them must have helped build the automobile that stands in your
garage or cut the cloth used to make the suit you wear or planed the wood
that went into building your home.

They are in every part of the United States, engaged in the normal
pursuits of daily living: working and raising their families; talking and
thinking and organizing.

But, as non-citizens or as naturalized citizens, they are subjected to
legal attacks on their rights -— especially on their right to reside in the
United States.

The Justice Department’s objective:

Force them to stop thinking, to stop talking, to stop acting in unison
with their fellow-Americans.

Imprison the minds of these men and women and dictate their thoughts
and actions.

To refuse to submit may mean exile from the United States, separation
from family and friends, deportation to what may be a strange and unfamiliar
land and, in some instances, possible persecution and death.

In the face of all threats, these non-citizens have refused to submit to
the dictates of the Justice Department.

Perhaps some historian of the future will be able to weigh in its full
heroic quality and epic content the attitude of these men and women who
persist in exercising their rights as Americans and, especially, their right
to be free from the dictation of police oﬂicers and FBI agents.

Perhaps some future historian will be able to weigh, too, the contribu-
tion these non-citizens and naturalized citizens are making to the people’s
ﬁght to preserve human liberties in the United States.

Today, the American people express their opposition to this hysteria

45

  

‘/‘destroy totally our rights and our liberties.

 

and deportation drive by _their growing support for those victimized under
the provisions of the Law. S
While there are casualties, there are many victories. Many have become
citizens despite the efforts of the Service to prevent naturalization. Many
have been saved from deportation. Many have won freedom after an original

denial of bail.

These Victories have been won at a great cost of time, money, and work.
But, people can be saved only by ﬁghting for their rights and defending
their liberties.

While the ﬁght continues to defend the rights of those under attack,
major attention is being devoted to the campaign to win as speedily as
possible repeal of the Walter-McCarran Law, which serves as legal justiﬁca-
tion for the unwarranted excesses in which the Justice Department engages.

Attacks on the rights of the foreign born have been recognized always
by Americans, since the founding of the country as an attempt to destroy
the rights and liberties of all of the people.

It was for this reason that the American people, under the leadership
of Thomas Jefferson, fought and nulliﬁed the Alien and Sedition Laws of 1798.

It was for this reason that the American people refused to accept the
program of the Know Nothing Party in the 1850’s.

It was for this reason that the American people were revolted by, and
condemned, the Palmer Raids of 1920.

Attacks on the rights of the non-citizen are not new in the history of
the United States. Each generation of Americans had to learn for itself the
real signiﬁcance of these attacks on civil rights as
a smoke-screen behind which to destroy all lib-
erties in the United States.

The story of the men and women told in this
pamphlet is an integral part of the people’s struggle
to preserve democratic rights in the United States
against the assaults of the McCarthyites. It is an
unending struggle against all odds and against
all forces that seek to spread hysteria in order to

_ It __ is this people’s opposition to the Justice
Department’s hysteria, ‘as well‘ as the intended
victim’s refusal, to submit ' to intimidation or
threats, that creates of this a story without end.

It will end only when the people win.

 

 

 

You can help write a ﬁnal chapter to this pamphlet.

The attack on the rights of foreign-born Americans is part of the general
assault on the liberties of all sections of the American people. Each
phase of this hysteria must be defeated if the rights of all are to be

preserved.

The ﬁght to defend the rights of the foreign born and to repeal the
Walter-McCarran Law can be won with your help.

A 99% AMERICAN

The bus moves up Market Street and the man sitting next to you
looks pretty much like everybody else.
Bill Heikkila’s words are part of the idiom of America.
He has already lived in this country longer than the average American-
48 years. All of his life really, since he is only 48 years old. _
The hollow in his right sleeve? That is where his arm hung before it
was ground into the earth of Minnesota in a train accident.
Not alone his arm but all of Bill Heikkila, and all of Bill Heikkila’s life,
is mixed in the soil and sweat of America.
What then makes him a “foreigner” in a land made up of foreigners?
_ Bill Heikkila’s parents came here from Finland in 19.00. In 1905, they
went home for a Christmas visit. The visit had to be extended for Bill’s birth,
on March 14, 1906. When Bill was three months old, his parents returned
to the United States, carrying him across our borders. ‘

5

 

Bill grew up in Northern Minnesota and later moved across the country
to settle in San Francisco, where he now lives with his American citizen wife
and works as a structural draftsman. Twice he tried to become a citizen but
failed each time because of circumstances over which he had no control.

If his parents had not gone home for a Christmas visit, Bill Heikkila
would have been an American-born citizen. . . .

But, Bill Heikkila is not a citizen and he faces deportation under the
Walter-McCarran Law for past membership in the Communist Party.

Peter Warhol, of Minneapolis, also faces deportation.

Peter Warhol has lived here 41 years, since he was three years old. In
these 41 years, he left the United States only once-when he was sent over-
seas by the Army and, for 14 months, fought to defend the United States.

After he was honorably discharged from the U. S. Army, Pete Warhol
was arrested in deportation proceedings.

All week long, Pete works in a pole-yard" in St. Paul, pouring creosote
over poles and loading them onto ﬂat cars.

Over week-ends, the Warhol family often piles into their 1938-model car
and Pete drives them around Minneapolis, the lakes, and the country-side.
To‘ his wife and their four children, Pete is the guide, naming the trees and
pointing to all the familiar places where he grew up, giving to them the
atmosphere of the country which is so much a part of him.

Worker, trade-unionist, father, soldier, husband. . . .

What makes Peter Warhol a “foreigner”?

What makes Raye Rubin a “foreigner”? Former president of the Wom-
en’s Auxiliary of the CIO National Maritime Union and now running a large
chicken farm with her husband, Charlie, in Torrance, California, Raye Rubin
was born in Lithuania on October 14, 1900, and brought into this country
in December 1900, when she was two months old.

Or David Hyun? His father, Rev. Soon Hyun, 77-year-old retired Meth-
odist minister, opposed the Japanese in Korea and escaped to Hawaii with
his family in 1924, when David was seven years old. David grew up in Hawaii
and, in 1947, the family moved to Los Angeles. David became an architect,
married, became the father of two boys and now faces deportation to South
Korea, despite the fact that he would be executed by the Syngman Rhee
government there.

Or Claudia Jones? Born in the British West Indies, she was brought
to the United States by her parents in 1924, when she was 9 years old.
Claudia Jones was raised in New York City, where she attended the public
schools and where, in 1934, she received the highest award given by the
New York City Board of Education: the Theodore Roosevelt Medal for
Good Citizenship. As a Negro, Claudia Jones grew up and dedicated herself
to the ﬁght to end the discrimination suffered by her people in the United

.6

 

 

States. She became a leader of the Communist Party and now faces deporta-
tion.

Bill Heikkila and Peter Warhol and Raye Rubin and David Hyun and
Claudia Jones are only 99% Americans. But, then is anyone, other than
perhaps the descendant of the American Indian, a 100% American?

In tracing our geneology, each one of us must at some point say “immi-
grant,” even if we have to go back as far as the Mayﬂower.

Did any one of us born on these shores select this as the country of
our birth, or was that purely accidental? Ten years ago, Lowell Mellett said,
“I can’t claim any credit for being an American. Sidney Hillman can. It was

A his own idea, not the idea of a great-great-grandparent.”

Today, there are those who would attribute strange values to place of
birth either because they do not understand the history of our country or
because they seek to create false standards in order to place those who were
not born in this country at a disadvantage.

Take Bill Heikkila, as one example. He just happens to be foreign born.
But, he has lived all of his life in the United States. His entire personality
was formed in this country. All of his ideas came out of his living in this
country, out of his contact with people in Minnesota and Montana and Cali-
fornia. His schooling was right here in the United States. V

William Heikkila is an American in every sense of the word.

Some day, if you are ever in San Francisco, look him up, ride up
Market Street on a bus with him, and draw your own conclusions.

 

 

Benny Saltzman and his family

WHY DON'T THEY BECOME CITIZENS?

There are both usual and unusual answers to this question.
’ Bill Heikkila was living in Duluth.

One Tuesday in 1927, shortly after he became 21, Bill Heikkila was
walking down Superior Street, on his way to the local office of the Immigra-
tion and Naturalization Service. In his pocket was a letter from the Service
advising him that he was to appear at 2:00 P.M. before a Federal judge
to be sworn in as a United States citizen.

Bill Heikkila was on his way to become an American citizen.

His path brought him past a line of strikers picketing a store on Superior
Street. Just as Bill was passing the picket-line, a squad of police swooped
down and arrested all the pickets. Bill Heikkila was not on strike. He was
not a picket. At that time, he was not even a member of any union. But,
he was taken into custody with the pickets and held overnight.

Bill Heikkila missed his chance—for the second time. The ﬁrst was
when his parents went to Finland for a Christmas visit three months before
he was born.

Bill Heikkila’s story is unusual. He is twice a non-citizen by accident.

But, Peter Warhol’s story, too, is unusual even though he is twice a
non-citizen by choice.

In 1943, Pete Warhol was business agent of the AFL Upholsterer’s Union,
Local 61, in Minneapolis. On his Union’s application, Pete was granted a
deferred status in the draft. Pete refused to accept a deferred status. After
many attempts and many arguments, he was drafted.

Shortly after being inducted, Pete ﬁled an application for American
citizenship. Then, one day, his commanding officer told Pete Warhol that
he could be sure of getting his citizenship if he were transferred to another

8

. ...-. ,  _ . , _ .. _ _. ., ,, ...., . . . ,-. H . , ..............s......—mw...,_..,.«..,..-w--——,»..,—

company that was to remain in the United States. His own company was
going overseas. Pete decided to go along with his company. He elected not
to become a citizen at that time.

Pete Warhol served overseas for 14 months. On January 4, 1946, he was
honorably discharged—still not a citizen. He followed up his application but,
in September 1947, he was arrested in deportation proceedings on the charge
of past membership in the Communist Party.

Pete went to court to seek to win a hearing on his application for
citizenship.

In 1950, however, as the result of a law passed by Congress, Pete Warhol
was no longer able to become a citizen as long as deportation proceedings
were pending against him. He fought the deportation but a ﬁnal order was
entered against him in 1951. As long as that order remains in effect, Pete
Warhol can never become an American citizen.

In 1954, representatives of the immigration service sent word to Pete
Warhol: they would cancel the deportation order and make him a citizen
if he cooperated. The Service wanted Pete Warhol to appear as a government
witness against the American Committee for Protection of Foreign Born at
hearings before the Subversive Activities Control Board.-

Peter Warhol told the Service that he planned to appear as a witness
before the Subversive Activities Control Board. But, he was going to be a
defense witness for the American Committee for Protection of Foreign Born.

For the second time in 10 years Peter Warhol elected not to become
an American citizen, although each time he wanted to become a citizen per-
haps more than anything else in his whole life.

There is only one Bill Heikkila and one Peter Warhol. Their stories are
unusual. But, somehow or other, once you have examined the stories of the
350 non-citizens arrested in deportation proceedings, the Heikkila story and
the Warhol story symbolize the problems and the difficulties faced by the
average non-citizen who wants to become a citizen.

The endless red tape. . . . The unavailability of necessary records. . . . The
difficulty of securing needed witnesses. . . . The aura of suspicion against any
person who has been active in any way in a union or a strike. . . .

Then, simple things. , .

Jack Stachel says that he doesn’t have to become naturalized since he
is a citizen. The Justice Department claims that he is not a citizen and is
planning to hold Stachel, a leader of the Communist Party, for deportation
when he completes serving a ﬁve-year jail sentence under the Smith Act.
Jack Stachel says that he was born in 1900 in Russia. Birth records are not
available and, unless Stachel can prove birth in 1900, he faces deportation.
His father became a United States citizen in January 1921. Therefore, if
Stachel was born in 1900, he was under 21 when his father became a citizen
