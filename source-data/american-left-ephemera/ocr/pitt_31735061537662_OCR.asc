“dim: Tltruth About

the Communists Which

the Un-American Committee

Tried to Suppress

am ..

It would put an end to academic freedom in all American
schools and colleges.

In the language of H.R. 1884, “It shall be unlawful . . .
.to convey the impression of sympathy with communism
or Communist ideology.” If this proposal were to be
adopted, teachers and writers—even the writers of private

letters—could be ﬁned $10,000 and jailed for ten years for-

conveying the impression of sympathy with a fundamental
-/Communist tenet—that all men are created equal. That
this happens also to be a fundamental tenet of American
‘democracy as set forthin the Declaration of Independence
would not exonerate them. »

Why is it that H.R. 1884, and all similar so-called anti
Communist legislation, spreads so very wide a net? Secre-
tary Schwellenbach, among others, argues that this’ is un-
avoidable because only by policing themind and probing
the heart of every American will it be possible to uncover
the “hidden” Communists. The fact, of course, is that the
overwhelming majority of the members of the Communist
Party declare themselves openly and with pride. But it is
also unfortunately true that some ‘few of them, for reasons

of economic security, ﬁnd it necessary to avoid public an-

nouncement of their Communist affiliation.

At an appropriate time I should like to propose to the
Congress an effective and practical means of helping to
terminate this situation, which is not of my Party’s making
nor to its liking.

I shall propose a joint resolution by the two Houses of
Congress, whichwill state that it is the sense of the Con-

A gress that the Constitution .and the Bill of Rights afford

to members of the Communist Party the same protection
afforded to all other American citizens. The joint resolu-
tion should further state that the Congress interprets
Secretary Marshall’s declaration that all patriotic citizens
shall be permitted to live without “fear of being denied
the /right to work or deprived of life, liberty and the pursuit
8

 

 
 

 

of happiness” to apply without discrimination for race‘
creed, national origin or political belief—and to make no
exception of Communist Party members. Finally, the joint
resolution shall state that Congress holds there shall be no
discrimination against Communists or other anti-fascists-
Negro or white—in either private or public employment
or in the right to run for and hold public ofﬁce or office in

I a trade union or other democratic organization.

    

_ I pledge that on the day Congress adopts such a resolu-
tion every single member of my Party will be more than
happy and willing to publicly declare his Communist
affiliation, of which he is so proud!

I would remind the Committee that both the methods
of the Rankin and Sheppard Bills and the methods pro-
posed by me have been tried and tested in situations
similar to that faced by the Communist Party in the United
States today.

Many early Christians concealed their religious beliefs
to escape persecution by the emperors of Rome. The
Emperor Diocletian tried to ferret them out by decrees
closely resembling the anti-Communist measures now be-
fore Congress. He failed. But when Constantine the Great
proclaimed Christianity as the state religion, the Christians
publicly avowed themselves.

Different and more moderate remedies have proved
much more successful. I cite two examples from American
history. Some of the followers of Thomas Jefferson were
obliged t-o conceal their views while the Alien and Sedition
laws were in effect. They avowed themselves openly when
those laws were repealed. Thousands of American trade
unionists were obliged to conceal their trade union- affilia-
tion in the days of the labor spy and the open shop. They
too avowed themselves openly when the Wagner Act gave
them the guarantee that they could wear a union button
without getting ﬁred from their jobs.

My proposal would eliminate fro-m American public

9 .

 

 

 

life the socalled problem of the “hidden” Communist.
The Rankin and Sheppard Bills, on the contrary, would

endeavor to, drive all Communists and other progressives ‘

into hiding.

I now turn brieﬂy to H.R. 2122. The Sheppard Bill
would also nullify the right of Americans to join the Com-
munist Party. It would further deny them the right to join
any organization directly or indirectly afﬁliated to virtually
any international body. T

WHAT H.R. 2122 WOULD DO

A “’ I am sure H.R. 2122 would not have Chairman Thomas’

support if there were the slightest danger it might be used
to create difﬁculties for his inﬂuential constituent, Stand-
ard Oil of New ]ersey—which as late as March, 1944 was
turning over vital American military secrets to the Nazis
by way of its partners in the I. G. Farben cartel.

It would be interesting to know if members of the Com-
mittee concur in my opinion that H.R. 2122 could and
might be used to require the C.I.O. to terminate its present
alﬁliation to the World Federation of Trade Unions. And
also to know how they think it would affect organizations
associated with U.N.E.S.C.O. and other agencies of the
United Nations.

I come now to the allegations that the American Com- '

munist Party is the “agent of a foreign power”; that it
“advocates the overthrow of the United States Govern-
ment by force and violence”; and that it is not a political
party in the accepted sense, but “a conspiracy.” ,

As to the ﬁrst of these slanders—‘it is a lie that the Ameri—
can Communists are agents of a foreign power. That was
what Hitler said of the German Communists, Quisling of
the Norwegian Communists, Laval and Doriot (the
French Louis Budenz) of the French Communists. When
V-E Day came just two years ago, the peoples of the world
rejoiced that “the lie was dead and damned and the truth

10

_; >i;;‘3g_

 

 

. 3 ><,-rm. _......_

 

 

stood up instead.” But now, on the eve of the second an-
niversary of V—E Day, Hitler’s Big Lie rises again here in
our America to shame the living and desecrate the war
dead.

Loyalty and patriotism must be judged by the test to
which they were put in the most bitter and costly war of
our nation’s history. We American Communists pass that
acid test with ﬂying colors, and no group or individual can
escape its judgment. °

In the second World V/Var, ﬁfteen thousand American
Communists took up arms. Major General Clayton Bissel,
wartime head of the U.S. Army Intelligence Corps, de-
fended the loyalty of Communist oﬂicers before a sub-
committee of the House Military Affairs Committee on
March 13, 1945. He said, “. . . they have shown by their
deeds that they are UPHOLDING the United States by
force and violence.”

American Communists sealed in blood our Party’s
loyalty to the only power to which our members give
allegiance—the sovereign power that resides in the Ameri-
can people. A

Before the hearings on these bills are over, I shall sub-
mit to the Committee as relevant testimony an extensive
though incomplete list of the Communist war dead, H of
our.Communist leaders who are war veterans and of our
comrades who have been decorated by their government
for distinguished service in the nation’s cause.

THE EXAMPLE OF BOTT CHER

But at this point I wish to cite the example of Capt.
Herman Bottcher. The GI’s in his outﬁt called him “the
one man army.” Assistant Secretary of War John J. McCloy
said of Bottcher, “He went to the South Paciﬁc. There he
was promoted to sergeant, then made a captain in the ﬁeld.
He was wounded, decorated and killed in action at Leyte.
This man proved his loyalty, regardless of what the War

A 1 1

 

 
 

Department might have found.” Like 4,000 other veterans
of the Spanish Republican war, Capt. Herman Bottcher;
decorated with Distinguished Service Cross with Cluster,
learned, in the ranks of the American Communist Party,
to hate and to fight fascism.

Likewise I give you Pvt. Hank Forbes, who was killed
in action at Anzio. His commanding oﬂicer said this ‘Com-
munist was an outstanding morale builder who inspired
his whole outﬁt with his own deep feelingfor what the
anti—Axis war was all about.

I also give you Robert Thompson, veteran of the Spanish
Republican war, bearer of the Distinguished Service
Cross and now Chairman of the New York State Com-
munist Party. On January 19, 1943 Lt. Gen. R. L. Eichel—
berger, recommending the promotion of Staff Sergeant
Thompson to the rank of First Lieutenant, Wrote, “It is
believed that the appointment of Staﬁ Sergeant Thompson
to the grade recommended, for‘ demonstrated battlefield
leadership ability, will have a very favorable effect through-

 

out the 32nd Division and encourage emulation of his‘

ﬁne example.” ‘ V
Only enemies of the American people, fascists and per-
jurers would dare impugn the patriotism of these men, or

question the loyalty of some 70,000 Communists, veterans‘
and non—Veterans,«who have deepened their devotion to ’

their country as a result of their membership in the
American Communist Party.

In peace as in war, we Communists have ever served the
true interests of our country, its workers and’ common
people. We never could and never can do otherwise, for
we were born of the American working class, endowed
with its aspirations and revolutionary traditions, educated
and strengthened in its struggles. '

ATo charge that we are Soviet agents is to deny the fact

a that there were Marxists in America long before there was

   

a Soviet Union. These early Socialists, the forebearsof the
12 '

 

 

 

modern American Communist Party, stood with Lincoln
against the ‘slaveholders’ rebellion. Lincoln did not doubt
their loyalty. He made the Communist Joseph Wedemeyer
a colonel in the Union army.

While the czars still ruled Russia, the modern Ameri-
can Communist movement was developing in the Socialist
Party of Eugene Debs, in the I.W.W. of “Big Bill" Hay-
wood, in the American Federation of Labor where Jack
Johnstone and VVilliam Z. Foster led the great struggles to
organize the unorganized in the mass production in-
dustries.

MOVEMENT YCUNG AS CAPITALISM .

Our movement is as young as American capitalism and
the working class it brought into being. But the charge of
“foreign agent” is older—as old as Toryism in America. It
was hurled against Thomas Jefferson when he championed
democratic rights at home and the right of self-determina-
tion for the young French Republic.

There is no conﬂict between the American patriotism

-and the working class internationalism of American Com-
munists-—as the proposed legislation implies. Modern capi-
talism and modern science have combined to make this
One World. X/Vithin that One World of which all men and
all nations are a part,“ we American Communists feel
special bonds that link us with the workers and Com-
munists of other lands.

We share with other workers the common bond of our
working class origin. In the often quoted phrase of'Abra—
ham Lincoln, we American Communists hold that “The
strongest bond of human sympathy, outside of the family
relation, should be one uniting all working peoplejof all
nations and tongues and kindreds.”

Our universal Marxist science is the fraternal bond be-
tween us and the Communists of all lands. Scientists in
every ﬁeld know this kinship with other scientists. Ameri-

13

 

.-.3; .,

 
 

  

  

can physicists who study and put to use the laws of matter
and motion, including nuclear energy, incorporate into
their work the experience and knowledge of physicists of
other countries.

So it is with us Marxists. Ours is the science of the laws
that govern the development of human society, of the
progress man has made from tribal times, through feudal-
ism and capitalism to socialism. We believe that man him-
self, and particularly the working—man, can help to shape
that progress and he will do so more effectively when he
acts not on blind instinct but on the basis of scientiﬁc
socialist theory and practice.

It is now seven years since the American Communist
Party severed its connections with the Communist Inter-

_ national. At that time we acted on our own initiative, to

meet the special conditions arising in our country out of
the Voorhis Act—which we then condemned. It is now
four yearssince the/Communist International voluntarily
dissolved by the vote of its affiliated parties. .

During the years of our organizational aﬂiliation to the
Communist International we published in our press com-
munications we received from that body. We made no

I secret of the fact that we sent delegates to its international

congresses. They came home and reported publicly to as
many Americans as would listen to them. They reported
publicly to our Party members, without whose approval
Communist International decisions had no validity for us.

We were at particular pains to publicize as widely as
possible the decisions of the Seventh Congress of the Com-
munist International in 1935. The heroic Bulgarian,
Georgi Dimitrov, presided over that historic Congress.
Even the members of this Committee must admit that
Dimitrov was well qualiﬁed by ﬁrst-hand experience to
lead a discussion on the subject of how to ﬁght fascism.

14

 

 

 

 

PREPARED WAY FOR DISSOLUTION

The Seventh Congress of the C.I., to which we Ameri-
can Communists made important contributions, prepared

. the way for the dissolution of the Communist Interna-

tional. It registered the fact that the Communist Parties
of the world were independent organizations, each of
native origin and making their own decisions. It cor-
rected some mistakes made by young Marxists who were
just beginning to learn that Marxism is a scientiﬁc guide
to action, and not a dogma. It called on the Communist

Parties of the world to check and defeat the fascists in

every land by studying the concrete conditions and the
special methods of fascism in each country. It called on
them to rally and mobilize the workers and people of every
nation for united action against fascism and war.

Our American Communist Party brought to the "Ameri-
can people, openly and publicly, the lessons we learned
through that fraternal exchange of experience with other
anti-fascist ﬁghters. If this was treason to the United
States—why didn’t Mr.  Edgar Hoover make the most of
it at the time?

What does Mr. J. Edgar Hoover know now about the
Communist International that he didn’t know when it
was in existence? Why does the F.B.I. consider the Ameri-
can Communist Party a more dangerous “foreign agent”
seven years after it left the Communist International than
it was while it maintained that affiliation?

Mr.  Edgar Hoover and the F.B.I._ are currently en-
gaged in the most extensive antiquarian research, combing
their dead ﬁles for ancient documents, resolutions, and
outdated pledges and other published and public relics of
the Communist Party’s past. A

We Communists are the ﬁrst to admit that some of us

’made more than a few mistakes and did many infantile

things in the period of our immaturity. But Mr. Hoover
15

  

 

 

  

 

will ﬁnd no evidence of Communist “crime” in his ﬁles.
Even Hoover himself is witness that we Communists
never in any way or at any time injured or subverted the
government of the United States.

It was after  Edgar Hoover had directed the arrest of
thousands of real and suspected Communists in 1920, as
the officer in charge of the infamous Palmer Raids, that
he himself ofﬁcially admitted that the Communists had not
been guilty of “any violation of the federal laws.” This ad-
mission was made in an inner—ofﬁce memorandum to As-
sistant Attorney—General Donovan on October 16, 1924,
several months after Hoover was made Acting Director
of the F.B.I. Attorney-General Harlan Stone, later a Chief
Justice of the Supreme Court, secured this reluctant ad-
mission from Mr. Edgar Hoover.

On May 15, 1924 Attorney-General Stone declared:
“The bureau of investigation is not concerned with politi-
cal or other opinions of individuals. It is concerned only
with such conduct as is forbidden by the laws of the
United States. When a police system passes beyond these
limits, it is dangerous to the proper administration of

justice and to human liberty, which itshould be our ﬁrstv

concern to cherish.”

I let Mr. Stone’s~ remarks stand as my own comment on
the President's March 22nd Executive Order establishing
a secret police system over the political opinions of gov-
ernment employees. I should like at this point to state
that I shall introduce shortly into the record, a statement.
issued by the National Board of the Communist Party on
this executive nulliﬁcation of the Bill of Rights. I

As a further comment on the responsibility of the Com-
munist Party for any curios Mr. J. Edgar Hoover may
unearth, I draw the Committee’s attention to the fact that
Article XIV of our Party’s Constitution rightfully and ex-
plicitly guards against just such an attempted perversion
of,justice and common sense. Article XIV states, “The
16

 

 

 

 

i lican Party has taken similar action. We Communists would

 
    
 

Communist Party is not responsible for any political docu-
ment, policy, book, article or any other expression of politi—
cal opinion except such as are issued by authority of this
and subsequent national conventions and its regularly con-
stituted leadership.”

DRAWS ATTENTION TO C.P. CONSTITUTION

In this connection I would also like to point out that we
Communists adopted Article XIV of the Constitution of
the C.P. U.S.A. because we have changed our policies and
views on many questions of theory, program and tactics in
accord with changing conditions and new economic and
social developments. This is only natural because Marxism
is a science, and as a science must take into account new
phenomena and thereby must constantly be enriched and
developed. Therefore, clearly, we do not necessarily ap-
prove nor agree with our position or documents of former
years—nor do we condone the mistakes and errors of our
past which we are the ﬁrst. to admit. Hence, we can be held
accountable and responsible only for those acts, documents .
or publications of the past" of which we may now affirm the V 35:;
correctness and which we accept ofﬁcially to-day or on the ‘
morrow. ’ ,

So far as I know, neither the Democratic nor the Repub—

not however hold -Congressman Thomas nor Hoover’s
G.O.P. responsible for Abraham Lincoln’s democratic as-
sertion that “Any people anywhere being inclined and hav-
ing the power have a right to rise up and shake 017 the
existing government, and form a new one that suits them
better.”

Nor do we hold Congressman Rankin, or even President
Truman, responsible for Thomas ]efferson’s prayer, “God
forbid we should ever be twenty years without. a rebellion.”

J. Edgar Hoover, Attorney-General Clark,~Legion Com~
mander Griﬂith, Congressmen Rankin and Thomas-and

now the Federal Commission on Employee Loyalty—all
profess to be mind readers. Proponents of this legislation
assert that it is necessary because Communists “think this”
and “believe that.” We reply that by our deeds you shall
know us——and not by what the persecutors of “dangerous
thoughts” think we think.

' All our deeds have been the deeds of patriots, of anti-
fascists and of champions of the American people’s wel-
fare. It was in America’s interest that we fought fascism in
Spain, opposed Japanese aggression in China, demanded
sanctions against Italy in Ethiopia, upheld Roosevelt’s call
to quarantine the Axis aggressors and condemned Cham-
berlain and Daladier for selling out Czechoslovakia and
world peace at Munich.

This Committee called, us “un—Ameriean” and “pro-Rus-
sian” before the war, and after Pearl‘ Harbor it dubbed us
the “premature anti-fascists.” But millions of Americans
know now that the policies we Communists fought for be-
fore the war were American policies. They know now that
if all the anti-fascists of the world had refused to be stam-
peded by those who condemned as unpatriotic any policy
that coincided with a policy advanced by the Soviet Union

——the second World War might have been prevented or, at _

least, very quickly ended.

During the war some phrase—maker——it might have been
William Randolph Hearst or maybe it was Col. Robert
McCormick—said we must be “Soviet agents” because we
were “over-zealous patriots.” We do not admit that there
could be an excess of zeal on the part of any American
worthy to be thought a patriot when the fate of our nation
hung in the balance. Do the proponents of this legislation
contend that we should have worked for the defeat of the

United States—in order to “clear” ourselves of the charge V

that we were zealous for a Soviet victory, for a United Na-\

"V tions victory?

18

 

 

 

BILLIONAIRES RETURN TO ATTACK

Now and in unprecedented furor the billion dollar

A “patriots” and their spokesmen return to the attack. But

we Communists will not be stampeded now into taking
an un-American stand merelyito please those who have
resurrected Hitler’s Red Bogey to advance their own quest
for empire and for Anglo-Saxon supremacy. And now there

are millions of Americans who have learned from the war _

and the tragic decade that preceded it. They aren’t going to
be stampeded either.

VVe Communists are by no means alone in our demand
that the Yalta and Potsdam agreements be carried out to
uproot the last vestiges of fascism everywhere. Millions of
non—Communists also know that the" _du Ponts, Standard
Oil, General Electric, Westinghouse and the other cartel-
lists rearmed Germany after the ﬁrst World War. These
millions are as determined as we are that the cartellists
shall not succeed in their current effort to rearm Germany
again.

The American people know that the men of the trusts
sold American short to their Axis partners during the war.
They know that these men without a country come into
court with unclean hands. They know that they drive for
strategic posts in Greece and the Mediterranean, not be-
causeilthey love democracy, but because their supreme
loyalty is to their oil wells in Saudi Arabia, and to their
cartel investments in Germany, Japan, Franco Spain and
Chiang Kai—shek China.

Others besides the American Communists will not be
stampeded into abandoning their faith in the United Na-
tions. They will condemn unilateral action that usurps the
power or undermines the authority of the United Na-
tions—-whether that action is taken by the United States
or by any other nation. —

Millions of Americans will crack down hard on any ad-
ministration or party that seeks to betray the aims for

19

 

 

    

which the war was fought and the peace whose outlines
Roosevelt made clear. '

Not only the American Communists, but millions of
other Americans, advocate universal disarmament, a drastic
reduction in our gigantic armaments program, the im-
mediate destruction of our atom bomb stockpile and the
outlawing of atomic weapons.

Neither we Communists nor these millions who work
for peace oppose a strong nationaldefense or wish to
weaken our country in order to strengthen some other
 power. We and they know that America’s national security
‘ C does not rest‘on “secret weapons” but on policies which
will promote a prosperous and anti—fascist America in a
democratic and peaceful world.

 

LINCOLN HELPS TO NAIL THE LIE

The truths which Abraham Lincoln spoke in another
hour of grave national crisis ring true for the America of '
today: V
A) “What constitutes the bulwark of our own liberty and
 independence? It is not our frowning battlements, our
' bristling sea coasts, our army and our navy. These are not
- our reliance against tyranny. All of those may be turned

against us without making us weaker for the struggle. Our
reliance is in the Love of Liberty which God has planted
in us. Our defense is in the spirit which prized liberty as
the heritage of all men, in all lands everywhere. Destroy
this spirit and you have planted. the seeds of despotism at
your doors. Familiarize yourselves with the chains of
bondage, and you prepare your own limbs to wear them.
Accustomed to trample on the rights of others, you have
lost thegenius of your own independence and become the
ﬁt subjects of the ﬁrst cunning tyrant who rises among
you.”

Gentlemen of the Committee, I believe that Abraham
Lincoln’s words help nail the lie that we Communists are

20

 

 

   

 

 

I

 

 
  

V “foreign agents”—and at the same time make a very rele-

-vant comment on H.R. 2122 and H.R. 1884.
‘ It is of course also untrue thatthe Communist Party has

ever in the past advocated, or advocates today, the use of

force and violence either as a means for achieving govern-
mental change or as a method of struggle for immediate
economic or social gains by labor and the people’s forces
generally. , u

Here I ask leave to introduce into the record the ques-
tions recently asked me on this subject by‘ the New York
Times,’ and my answers. (Exhibit C.*)

Congiessman Sheppard’s Bill repeats this moth—eaten
charge of force and violence. But H.R. 2122 offers no
proof, and there is no proof that can be offered. Many at-
tempts have been made in the press and the courts of this
land to establish such proof, but every one of them has
failed; In the 28 years of our Party’s existence, not a single
American Communist has ever been proven or convicted
of acting or conspiring to employ force and violence to
overthrow the government of the United States. It is there-
fore obvious that such a charge cannot possibly be upheld
against our Party as a whole.

DO NOT ADVOCATE FORCE OR VIOLENCE

I shall submit now for the record the full text of the
Constitution of our Party. (Exhibit D.**) I read. now from
Article IV, Section 10: “Every member is obligated to ﬁght
withiall his strength against any and every eﬁort, whether
it comes from abroad or from within our country, to
destroy the rights of labor and the people, or any. section
thereof, or to impose upon the United States the arbitrary
will of any group or party or clique or conspiracy, thereby"

violating the unqualiﬁed right of the majority of the peo-
ple to direct the destinies of our country.”

I read also from Section 2 of Article IX: “Adherence to
or participation in the activities of any clique, group,
circle, faction or party which conspires or acts to subvert,
undermine, weaken or overthrow any or all institutions of
American democracy, whereby the American people can
maintain their right to determine their destiny in any
degree, shall be punished by immediate expulsion.”

I wish to emphasize that it is precisely those who ad-
vocate the use of force and violence to overthrow the new
democracies of Europe and to put down the national libera-
tion movements of Asia, and who now seek to bring fas-
cism to power in the United States—who accuse us Com~
munists of wanting to overthrow the government of the
United States by force and violence.

Force and violence are the weapons which have always
been advocated and employed by those who resist basic
social change. In American history, the classic examples of
this are the British Tories and their American agents who
resisted the national liberation movement of the thirteen
colonies; and secondly the counter—revolution of the slave-
ocracy which forced the nation into Civil War.

Pro-fascist monopoly can not have its reactionary way
in these United States without resorting to force and
violence. ‘And history has shown that, once fascism is
entrenched in ‘state power, the people have no other
recourse but to overthrow it by force and violence.

The right to take such revolutionary measures when and
if they become necessary is proclaimed as an American
right in_ the Declaration of Independence. It was through

_the American pe0ple’s exercise of this inalienable right that

 

our nation was founded.

But fascism has not yetcome to power in the United
States. We Communists and millions of our fellow Amer-
icans are determined that it shall never come to power.

22

 

 

 

 

That is why‘ we Communists and other anti-fascist progres-
sives urge that the American people unite in a broad labor
and democratic coalition whose concerted, public, mass
action can check and curb the imperialists, the reactionary
monopolists and save our country from the hell of fascist
terror.

Fascist terror is force and violence in their most brutal
form. Where it reigns there can be no democratic and
orderly progress.

Today, the way‘ to democratic and orderly progress is
to keep force and violence away from the factories by
defeating the anti_—labor legislation of the G.O.P. and the
Southern Bourbons.

Today, the way to democratic and orderly progress is to
prevent a return of the force and violence which marked
the Harding-Hoover period, by defeating the predatory
post-war foreign and domestic policies of the trusts-
which jeopardize the peace and hasten the coming of
another economic crisis.

Today, the way to democratic and orderly progress is to
stop the force and violence of American Action, Inc., of
the K.K.K. and the lynch mobs—by helping win equal
rights for the Negroes and civil liberties for all.

Today, the way to democratic and orderly progress is
to oppose the force and violence of imperialist expansion
and atomic war which could bring nothing but ruin and
tragedy to the United States and other peoples.

These are the ways of democratic and orderly progress
which we American Communists advocate and take.

COMMUNISM NOT A CONSPIRACY

Now as to the third allegation, namely, that the Amer-
ican Communist Party is not a political party in the ac-
cepted sense, but a conspiracy. Rep. Mundt told the press
on February 26th that this Committee is endeavoring to
prove the truth of this allegation.

23

 

 

    

This third allegation is as false as the other two which
are lodged by the proponents of H.R. 2122 and H.R. 1884.

e I ask leave to submit to this Committee while" these hear-

ings are» still in progress a list of the many Communists
who have run for federal and state ofﬁce, including the

.presidential Communist candidates in 1928, 1932, 1936

 

and 1940 and the number of votes received by each.

As is well known, there was no Communist presidential
candidate in 1944. Communists in that crucial war year
subordinated partisan interest to national unity, and
worked, actively for the electoral victory of our great war-
time president, Franklin D. Roosevelt.

In the 1946 elections we ran several dozen federal and
state candidates’ and gave qualiﬁed or conditional support
to pro—Roosevelt candidates. We campaigned actively and
publicly for those candidates who had the united support
of labor and all progressives, regardless of their party
designation. ‘ .

It is a matter of regret to us that t-he number of our can-
didates was not larger. We should like to contest many
more ofﬁces,‘ but unfortunately in some states, especially
in the South, we have been unlawfully deprived of our
electoral rights. Some other states, such_ as Illinois and
California, have provisions which make it extremely dif-
ﬁcult for the Communist Party or any minority or new
party to get on the ballot.

In spite of discriminatory restrictions and persecution,
our Communist candidates have not made a bad showing.
Under the New York P.R. election system, the New York
City Communist Councilman and ,_ outstanding Negro
leader, Benjamin  Davis, Jr., received a total of 63,498
votes——56,l29 being ﬁrst choice votes. In contrast, in the 1st

this Committee, received a total of 14,815 votes out of a

course, take into acount that whereas there are six political
parties on the New York ballot, Georgia and Mississippi
are in effect states with a one-party system.

ULTIMATE AIM IS SOCIALISM

We Communists have never made any secret of the fact

that our ultimate objective is socialism. But there is

nothing in this fact to substantiate the charges that we are
a “conspiracy,” that we are “foreign agents,” or that we ad-
vocate the “overthrow of the United States government by
force and violence.” ‘

As American workers we strive publicly and by demo-
cratic means to convince the American people that social-
ism/is the only way to end the scourge of economic crisis,
unemployment and violent class conﬂict. We strive to
convince them that only socialism can once and for all put
an end to reaction, fascism‘ and war which are engendered
by monopoly capitalism.

We Communists are conﬁdent that the day will come
when the majority of Americans will decide by their own
free choice, on the basis of their own experience‘ and in
harmony with their fundamental interests, to march for-
ward along the road of social progress toward socialism-
that is, to establish the common ownership of the national
economy under a government of the people, led by the
working class.

. As Marxists, we know the road cannot be mapped out
in advance. It will be prospected and cleared by the mil-
lions of democratic. Americans who seek it. It will be an

‘American road, opening new frontiers for the traditions

of American democracy and built according to American

‘ speciﬁcations by the common people of America who

develop further the democratic know—how which is ours.

Our path will not necessarily follow the twists and turns
taken by the peoples of other countries who also, because
of the inexorable logic of economic and social develop-
ment, move toward a similar goal.

We Communists are not utopians, and come what may,
we are not nor never will be adventurers. Marxism and
patriotism alike teach us that we must differentiate be-
tween what is possible today and what can be realized to-
morrow.

The better and more progressive America toward which
we strive can be built only by the,..American people, led
by labor, and on the foundation of a stronger, American
democracy.

What kind of America do the proponents of this legisla-
tion want? They begin by demanding that the Communist

_ Party be outlawed. That was how Hitler began. Shall we

not conclude that they seek the end that Hitler sought?

And who are the proponents of this legislation? They
include the N.A.M. and the U.VS. Chamber of Commerce.
Thus, they are the spokesmen for the big trusts who raked
in 251 billion dollars in war proﬁts, and now want to
destroy the labor movement so that their profiteering can
go on without check. They are the du Ponts, General.
Electric, " Standard Oil, the Aluminum Corporation—and
the rest of the cartellists for whom the war was just another
big bankruptcy squeeze. Now that their Nazi and Japanese
partner—competitors have been put through the wringer—
the American monopolists dream of an imperialist “A mer-
ican Century,” and seek to dominate the globe. The agents
of‘ the former Axis enemies in this country also support
H.R. 2122, H.R. 1884 and similar proposed legislation.

WHO WANTS TO OUTLAW COMMUNISTS?

During the war, Mr.  Edgar Hoover and the Justice
Department brought sixteen Red-baiting, labor—hating,

.anti—Semitic and anti-Negro seditionists to trial-. Some of

 

them had at one time or another appeared before this Com-
mittee as friendly witnesses. I am sure they would be glad
to repeat now their support for legislation to outlaw the
Communist Party. The case against them was dropped like-
a hot potato. Now they are at liberty to appear and back
up Mr. Edgar Hoover, Mr. Rankin, Mr. Sheppard and Mr.
J. Parnell Thomas.

Thank to Mr.  Edgar Hoover, Donald Day and Axis
Sally are also at liberty. I think it vital that this Committee
ascertain and make public their views on outlawing the
Communist Party. Their opinion should be of special in-
terest to all rank—and-ﬁle members of the American Legion-
and the Veterans of Foreign Wars. For it was the GI’s in
the fox-holes who had to take Donald Day and Axis Sally
along with Hitler’s bombs and gunﬁre.

On July 5, 1945 the BBC reported the discovery of
stacks of articles clipped from the Chicago Tribune and
Hearst’s ]ournal—American in the Nazi broadcasting sta-
tion at Koenigswesterhausen. A typical item: “Mr. Roose-

 

velt consistently stresses the interests and wishes of other -

nations without regard to his own.” And another —|.:eamed‘
to German troops on February 18, 1945: “Col. Robert
McCormick is a lonely patriot who takes his responsibil-
ities toward his country seriously. . . . . He is prepared’
to go to Hell for his opinions~—which are anti-Roosevelt,
anti—British, anti-Bolshevik, and anti-Semitic.” The “lonely
patriots” Hearst and McCormick are ardent backers of this
legislation. .

It is only four years since Franklin Roosevelt warned
the Congress: “The philosophy of the Axis powers is based
on profound contempt for the human race. If, in the for-‘

mation of our future policy, we were guided by the same

cynical con-tempt, then we should be surrendering to the
philosophy of our enemies, and our victory would turn to
defeat.”

Today there exists in our country a dangerous conspiracy
whose aim is to turn the anti-Axis Victory into defeat, to
destroy American democracy and put in its place an Amer-
ican form of fascism. A

' Those who organize this conspiracy fought Roosevelt
-‘(and labor) tooth and nail while he lived. They have in-
volved in it the man who gave his solemn pledge to the
American people that he would walk in Roosevelt’s foot-
steps and continue Roosevelt’s policies. But now this man,
having labelled the Hoover—Dulles-Vandenberg policy of
world domination as the “Truman Doctrine,” is hounding
the ghost of Roosevelt’s'New Deal from all government
agencies. V

H.R. 2122 and H.R. 1884 play their part in the con-
spiracy to make America the land in which Roosevelt
shall have become the forgotten man and his progressive
and foreign policies the forbidden thought.

Do not these bills demand that the Communist Party be
outlawed so that the pro—Roosevelt labor—democratic coali-
tion can be outlawed? Do they not propose to ban all
candidates who would preserve the Wagner Act and other
New Deal legislation? Do they not imply that the Roose-
velt who waslthe strategist of coalition warfare sold the
nation to its staunchest and most heroic ally—the Soviet
Union? Do they not imply that the war was won against
the wrong enemy? Do they not seek to tear down the
United Nations, whose architect was Roosevelt, and
crumble in ruins its corner-stone of American-Soviet
friendship? ’

It is only natural that we Communists should bear the
first brunt of this current Red-baiting attempt to turn vic-
tory into defeat, to wipe out all memory of the war and the

 

 

aims for which it was-fought and to rob the American

28

' paths and by peaceful means.

   

people of Roosevelt’s heritage. It is just as natural that
this un—American Committee, which gave aid and comfort
to the Axis enemy during the war, should play a leading
part in this post-war pro—fascist conspiracy.

But the lessons of the anti-Axis war and of Franklin
Roosevelt’s partnership with the common man live in the
hearts and minds of the American people. The German
people had no such reservoir or experience and strength
to draw on when Hitler proclaimed his 1000—year rule of 
terror, nor had the rest of the world’s peoples. And yet—« 
Hitler’s Greater Reich lasted not 1,000 years, but 12. It
should be long remembered that those 12 years, so terrible
for the people of Germany and of the world, were the same
12 years in which the German Communist Party was out—
lawed.

 

WE COMMUNISTS ARE HERE T O STAY

VVe American Communists are here to stay. VVe will
endure as long as America’s working people endure. Re-.
gardless of what repressive measures are taken against our
Party in violation of the Constitution and the basic demo-.
cratic principles upon which our nation was founded—«
hundreds of thousands of American workers and progres«
sives will learn to be American Communists. Their school
is the struggle of Amer"1ca’s common people against the
American trusts and empire builders.-

In the agony of his last torture, Galileo told his in-
quisitors, “the earth still moves.” We Communists know»
that human society moves, and that it moves in the direc-.
tion of democratic advance and social progress.

Here in our America we wish to move along democratic

We call on all Americans who share this wish, whatever

questions, to oppose and work for the defeat of H.R. 1884,.
H.R. 2122 and all similar legislation. We call with con‘. ’

ﬁdence on all patriotic Americans to check the pro—fascist
conspiracy which now menaces the Bill of Rights and the
United Nations. e

I have insisted on my right to come here to give my
testimony on H.R. 1884 and H.R. 2122, because the legis-
lative hearings of this committee are the only means‘
afforded to anyone to be ofﬁcially heard on these bills.

However, when I denounced the original decision of
this committee to exclude the Communist Party from
these hearings, and insisted ,on my right to present testi-‘
mony on behalf of my Party, I also said that I did not
recognize the committee’s legal or constitutional authority.‘

_ My appearance here, therefore, cannot in any waybe
construed as de facto recognition of an authority which
does not exist in reality, and which this committee has
arrogated to itself in deﬁance of the Constitution of the
United States. On the contrary, by advice of counsel, I

poena witnesses, to ask questions of anyone under penalty
of law for contempt of Congress as a result of one’s refusal
to be bulldozed by what even the most conservative
Republican press, i.e., the New York Times on March 24,

American activities” that “violated all rules of fairness.”
First, I challenge the authority of the committee on the
ground that its powers have not been deﬁnitively and
properly deﬁned by Congress.
Secondly, I challenge its authority on the ground that
neither communism nor the Communist Party fall under
the deﬁnition "un—American.”
Thirdly, I challenge the legality of the existence of this
committee on the following grounds: ’

At least one member of the committee is not a lawfully
elected member of the House of Representatives of the
United States. This member holds his seat in the House

30

 

unlawfully, and by fraud, and by circumstances of illegality
beyond the power and scope of judgment of the qualiﬁca-
tion of its own members which the House of Representa-
tives holds by Article I, Section 5, of the Constitution.

I challenge the legality of this committee and its right

» to function with the authority of the House of Representa-

tives because of the provision in the second section of the
14th Amendment of the United States Constitution, which
declares:

“But when the right to vote at any election for the
choice of electors for President and Vice—President of the
United States, Representatives in Congress, the executive
and judicial oﬁicers of a state, or the members of the Legis-
lature thereof, is denied to any of the male inhabitants of
such a state, being 2] years of age, and citizens of.the
United States, or in any way abridged, except for partici-
pation in rebellion, or other crime, the basis of representa-
tion therein shall be reduced in the proportion which the
number of such male citizens shall bear to the whole num-
ber of such male citizens 21 years of age in such state” (the
word “male” is eliminated by the Women Suffrage Amend-
ment). .

Fourteen—ﬁfteenths of the citizens of Mississippi 21 years
of age or over have been denied the right to vote in the last
election in the notorious Bilbo senatorial campaign. Only
46,493 votes were cast. No less than 550,000 Negro and
150,000 white citizens of Mississippi 21 years of age were
kept from the polls, being-denied the right to vote. The
Constitution requires that the House of Representatives
should not seat seven representatives from Mississippi, but
only one, and there is no legal ground for assumption that
John E. Rankin holds a right to such seat.

Obviously this committee cannot serve as judge of its
own constitutionality.

Let no one say that the purpose in raising this issue is to
reduce_ the representation of the state of Mississippi in

'31

 

 

Congress. Anyone so interpreting it, could do so only on
the claim that the Negro peopleare not human beings and
not citizens protected in their equal rights by the Consti-
tution. My purpose is not to enforce penalties upon the
people ofa great state, but to demand that the Constitu-
tion be sustained, by which fourteen—ﬁfteenths of the
people of Mississippi could secure representation which
they are now denied.

There is an object lesson in this hearing today. The
sponsors of ant_i—labor and anti—Communist bills are attack-
ing the foundations of the Constitution. Labor, the Com-
munists and other progressives are defending it. ‘

Let the whole country witness this fact. This defense
of the Constitutional. rights of the people is not a momen-
tary impulse. It is a Vital part of the program of the Com-
munist Party and has been incorporated in the preamble
of the Constitution of our Party for many years, in the
following words: C

“The Communist Party upholds the achievements of
American democracy and defends the United States Con-
stitution and its Bill of Rights against its reactionary
enemies who would destroy democracy and popular liber-
ties.” ‘

I AM EUGENE DENNIS, the General Secretary of the
American Communist Party. I appear in opposition to the
Rankin Bill, H.R. 1884, and the Sheppard Bill, H.R. 2122.

I am here to defend the inalienable right of Americans
to be Communists. I am here to defend the constitutional
right of the Communist Party to function as a legal politi-
cal party which openly presents its views, its program and
its candidates to the Americanpeople.

In so doing, I in fact defend "the Constitution and the

A Bill of Rights—which H.R. 2122 and_H.R. 1884 propose to 2

nullify. I defend the right of the American people to pro-
mote the welfare and advance the social progress of. the
nation by democratic means and in the spirit of America’s
progressive traditions. H.R. 2122 and H.R. 1884 place this
basic right in jeopardy. They propose to usurp for a party
in power the right to pass upon the political programs of
other parties—although the Constitution reserves this right
to the people and to the people alone.

In addition, I am jealous for my country’s good name
abroad and defend here the national security of the United
States and the cause of world peace. I do not believe that
other nations can fail to see an ominous connection be-
tween these legislative ‘proposals to by-pass the Bill ’ of
Rights and recent moves by the U.S. government which
are generally interpreted as by—passing the United Nations.

A DEFINITION’OF DEMOCRACY

The deﬁnition of democracy, offered to the Council of
Foreign Ministers by Secretary of State Marshall in behalf
of the American delegation, has a direct bearing on H.R.
2122 and H.R. 1884. I ask leave to introduce into the
record both Secretary Marshall’s statement of March 14
and my cable to Mr. Marshall on March 16. (Exhibit A)

I submit that the United States will forfeit the respect
of all democratic peoples if it leads a double life. Others
cannot but judge the sincerity of American sermons on
democracy abroad by American practice of democracy at
home. A

I shall in due course deal with the deliberately false
charges against my Party, which H.R. 1884 and H.R. 2122
lodge as a pretext for their unconstitutional proposals. But
I wish first to deal with these proposals, and in some detail.

The Rankin Bill, H.R. 1884, would prohibit Com-
munists from running for public oﬂice, whether on the
Communist ticket or that of any other party. This pro-
posal is on its face unconstitutional. Even Secretary of
Labor Schwellenbach, who endorses the objectives of H.R.
1884, does not attempt to defend its constitu.tionality or
that of any similar legislation.

H.R. 1884 is in conﬂict with Secretary Marshall's dec-
laration that “Freely constituted political parties should
be insured the right to participate in a free and competitive
election system in which each is accorded equal oppor-
tunity to present its views, win adherents and obtain just
representation.”

On one premise, and on only one premise, can H.R.

 

1884 be reconciled with the Secretary of State’s enuncia— ‘-

tion of American policy. That is on the premise the Ger-
man people are to be trusted to make a wise use of demo-
cratic liberties—while the American people are not. Does

~

 

 

this Committee care to go to the American people with
that thesis? 

The Rankin Bill does not stop at curtailing the rights of
Communists. It states frankly that its objective is to pre-
vent the undeﬁned and undeﬁnable Communist “sympa-
thizer” from running for public oﬂice on any ticket. If this
measure were adopted, any candidate in sympathy with
any part of the immediate program of the Communist
Party or-with any of its long-range aspirations—would be
subject to challenge and could be removed from the ballot
and jailed by his political opponents. R

Next year we have a crucial presidential and‘ national
election. If this bill is passed, voters in the Democratic, the
Republican and third parties could not nominateémuch
less elect—any candidate who sympathizes with the Com-
munist View that our nation’s peace and economic welfare
require that the people curb the power of big monopolies,
the fascist—minded economic royalists and the war-mongers-

That is the core of the Communist program in the
present ‘period and the main plank for its 1948 platform.

That is one reason the N.A.M. and the Chamber of Com?‘

merce urge the passage of this bill. —
Passage of H.R. 1884 would also require all parties to
reject any candidate in sympathy with the American trade
union movement and the Communist program of defend-
ing the Wagner Act and labor’s rights. Candidates opposed
to the open shop and the anti-labor injunction, or advo-
cating the strengthening of the W'age-Hour Act, could not
be candidates. That is another reason the N.A.M. and the
Chamber of Commerceurge the passage of this bill.

RANKIN "BILL MAKES IT ILLEGAL

Passage of the Rankin Bill would make it illegal for any
party to place on the ballot a candidate who was sympa-
thetic to the Communist view that the Negro people are
entitled to equal rights and full citizenship. Moreover,

' ' 5 _

 

Negroes themselves, as well as their friends and democratic
allies, thus could be barred from running for ofﬁce. It
would be illegal for any candidate to concur in the Com-
munist view that Secretary Marshall’s March 14 declara-
tion places upon the Congress the obligation to repeal the
poll-tax and abolish the white primary.

At this point, I wish to introduce into the record my re-
port to the November, 1946 meeting of the National
Committee of the Communist Party, which includes the
1947 legislative program of my Party. (Exhibit B*) An
analysis of this program must establish that only those who
are out of sympathy with every need and desire of the
American people could clear themselves of the charge of
being sympathetic to the Communists on some vital issue
or other. ‘

Can any one question what would happen to aﬂcandidate
who had once been associated with some aspect of the New
Deal’s domestic program——and now also advocated that
this nation return to the Roosevelt policy of lasting peace
based on Big Three unity and American-Soviet friend-
ship? He would be ruled out from the start—as H.R. 18871
intends he should be.

We have only to see what has been happening in regard
to a few executive appointments to understand what a
wide variety of persons would be‘ barred from elective
ofﬁce if this legislation were adopted. The classic case is, of
course, that of Mr. David Lilienthal. But even Francis
Biddle is no longer above suspicion, although as Attorney-
General he tried without success to get the Supreme Court
to rule that the Communist Party is an advocate of force
and violence. Mr. Biddle is now running like a hare‘, pur-
sued by the hounds he helped unleash.

Secretary of Labor Schwellenbach was among the ﬁrst
to be caught in the back-ﬁre of his own call to outlaw the

Communist Party. Today the Republicans are after one
of his underlings, who has turned up on this Committee’s
voluminous blacklist. Tomorrow it may be Mr. Schwellen—

bach himself. He was once a New Dealer. The neo-Inquisi-.

tion in America does not intend that those who recant
shall be saved.

The Rankin Bill proposes to outlaw the Communist
Party “whether or not any change is hereafter made” in its
name. Thus, once the Communist Party were outlawed,
any democratic political coalition and party accepting the

support of an organization of independent voters, or any '

steps toward the organization of a new progressive, people’s
party——would in turn be outlawed on the pretext that here
was the Communist Party resurrected under a new name.

Furthermore, some Republicans, some members of this
Committee and the Hearst—McCormick press have more
than once in the past charged that the Democratic Party
was itself under Communist inﬂuence. If the Democratic
Party were to return to the progressive policies of Franklin
Roosevelt, this charge,‘ revived and vigorously pressed,
could conceivably lead to the eventual outlawing of the
Democratic Party.

In any case, the Rankin Bill is a perfect set—up for facili-
tating a Republican victory in the 1948 elections. How
then does it happen that such a measure is introduced by
one who bears the designation, Democrat? I carefully re-
frain from charging collusion or conspiracy. But I suggest
that the G.O.P.—Southern Bourbon bi-partisanship can be
carried to the extreme of totalitarianism.

BILL PROPOSES THOUGHT CONTROL

The Rankin Bill expands from the field of politics to
take in the realm of thought. It would abridge and destroy
all freedom of the press, and authorize a police surveillance
of the private correspondence of every American citizen;
