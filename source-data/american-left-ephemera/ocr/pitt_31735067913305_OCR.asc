" $4.5 Million Kohler Company Settlement

Kohler Company and the United Auto Workers have agreed to
a settlement of $4.5 million for 1,400 former Kohler strikers. Back
pay had been ordered by the National Labor Relations Board for
former Kohler employees who participated in the bitter six and a
half year strike which ended September 1, 1960. Kohler had refused
to make payment‘ and a contempt case is pending against the com-
pany. It is reported that the union has suggested the case be
dropped, in View of the settlement.

The $4.5 million is to cover $3 million for back pay and $1.5
million owed to pension funds on behalf of the 1,400 workers.

Debs Award to John L. Lewis

John L. Lewis has been honored with the first Eugene V. Debs
award for service to labor._ The award was established by the
Debs Foundation which maintains the Terre Haute, Indiana home
of Debs. President of the foundation is Patrick E. Gorman, secre-
tary-treasurer oﬁ the Amalgamated Meat Cutters.

Chemica-l Industry Bargaining

Bargaining in the chemical industry in the next two years will
be getting special attention from the Oil, Chemical and Atomic

Workers, with over 100,000 members in chemical plants, as well‘

as from the International Chemical. Workers who have a total
membership of 80,000.

’ ICWU held a special collective bargaining conference in which

' it emphasized the union’s drive for pattern-bargaining. President

Walter L. Mitchell said after-tax profit per production worker in

V the industry amounts to about $9,700 per year.

OCAW’s Chemical Policy Committee in early December drew
up ‘a. uniform bargaining program calling for increased pensions
and optional early retirement with no reduction in benefits; im-
proved vacations ranging from one week after one year to 6 weeks
after 25 years; one additional :paid- holiday; a substantial wage

~-increasle, and elimination of inequities among workers doing-: the

same work in the same sub-divisions-.of the industry-. .

Because of varying contract expiration: dates, the union. will
attempt to apply the program contract by contract over the next
twoyears. ‘

0CA‘W President A. F. Grospiron told‘ the-press that three of
the policy comm1ttee’s proposals called for reduction in working
hours to spread employment among the declining number of jobs
causedby automation.

The commission headed by former CIA director John McCone,
appointed by California governor Pat Brown, has turned in its
report on the Watts riot of August. Reaction from labor and CORE
spokesmen was that the report was 101 pages of the obvious. It
described ‘the riot as a protest against intolerable social and eco-

“Penny Buckner was a man
who fought injustice whenever
he believed it existed.
“Because of Penny Buckner,

a little better off and more
secure. ’ '
-“Penny Buckner was a man
so dedicated to the welfare of
his fellow man that he never
spared himself in their behalf.

“Penny. Buckner was a man

-_ who, together with his good

wife, raised, provided for, and
educated a wonderful "family."
And afterall, isn’t the devotion
of a man to his family and his

of any man’s greatness? I be-
lieve it is far and above pres-
tige, prominence, high office, or
material affluence.

“When each of us leaves this
mortal world, let us pray that
we can leave behind us a record
of dedication to our fellow man
that comes somewhere near

"matching this achievement of

Penny Buckner. Glen L, Buck-
ner, in my opinion, was trulya
great man.”

Skinner was expressing the feel-
ing that the international exec-
utive board and the entire union
had for Penny Buckner. Mine-
Mill will miss him.

   

 ];u¢];ne1- Mine Safety Hearings Early-s 
lies on Dec. 8

_ Glen Lloyd‘-(Penny) Buckner, a Mine-Mill international repre-
,el1till§i’\l‘e”f0r the past five years, died in St, Marks Hospital in
$’a"i],-t;—",’};;g1-:'e City on Dec 8 following a‘ short illness. Born in Driggs,
‘lid--on ‘May 19, 1902, he was 63 years old.

 

In Senate Session Expected
»WASHINGTON, D. C.——Senate hearings on proposed federal. mine-safety legisla- -

tion to cover the non-ferrous metals industry are expected to be held late in January - .\
or in early February. They could, however, be delayed should the Senators get h_ung  ..f'-A

up in a lengthy filibuster early in the session on the House-passed bill to repeal Sec-.
tion 14(b) of the Taft-Hartley Act.

Congress reconvenes on Jan. 10, and labor is hoping that Senate Majority Leader 
Mike Mansfield will initiate the fight on 14 (b) early, since filibusters are usually more 

difficult to choke off towards the
end of a session, as many of the
Senators become eager for ad-
journment.

Holding the mine safety hear-
ings will be the Subcommittee
on Labor of the Senate Commit-
tee on Labor and Public Wel-
fare. Although the subcommit-
tee is normally chaired by Sen.

.Pat McNamara (D-Mich.),. he‘

is expected to be extremely
busy with other matters, such
as the fight for repeal of 14(b)
and the battle against the Dirk-

sen amendment on reapportion-.

ment, and may turn the job dur-
ing the mine safety hearings
over to another member of the
group. Other Democrats on the

subcommittee are -Wayne Morse «

of - Oregon, Gaylord Nelson of
Wisconsin, Jennings Randolph of
West Virginia, Claiborne Poll of
Rhode Island, and Robert Ken
nedy of New York. »

The minority members are
Jacob Javits of New York, Win-
ston Prouty of Vermont, and
Paul Fannin of Arizona.

Three Bills

In addition to the mine safety
bill passed by the House on
Sept. 2, it is expected that the
original version of the Johnson
administration bill on the sub-
ject as well as the Metcalf-
Montoya mine safety bill will
come under consideration. Both
are stronger proposals.

Metcalf-Montoya, for example,

would cover integrated smelters

and refineries and provide for.

more s tr i n g e n t enforcement
powers. The original administra-
tion bill, which was amended in
the House of Representatives,
called for federal inspection and
enforcement rather than. allow-
ing states to submit safety pro-
grams of their own, which, if

V approved‘ by "the Department of

the Interior, would be adminis-
tered on the state level.

Mine-Mill and the several oth-
er labor unions which lastyear
spoke with a unified voice in
support of a strong mine safety
bill are again expected to urge
at the Senate hearings that the.
broadest possible bill receive
the subcommittee’s b a cking.
Specifically, the labor organiza-
tions would like to see the state
option‘ feature of the House-
passed measure removed and
the coverage broadened to in-
clude integrated smelters and
refineries.

Testimony Convincing

Labor’s testimony in 1965,
backed up in large part. by the
Department of the Interior re-.
port on safety conditions. in the
nation’s metal and mineral
mines and mills, apparently
helped sway many Congress-
men. “In the course of the hear-
ings," said Rep. Albert H. Quie
of Minnesota, the ranking Re-
Dublican on the Subcommittee
on Labor, “I came to. the con-

clusion that we needed a bill of’
‘the nature of the pending meas-

ure.”

An amended version of the ad '

ministration’s proposal, the bill
was passed by voice vote in the
House on Sept. 2. Only one Con-
gressman, Laurence J , Burton
(R-Utah), spoke against the
measure during the floor debate.

Should the Senate subcommit-
tee ‘recommend and the Senate
pass a. stronger mine safety bill,
the House would be asked to go

. along with the changes. If the
House wouldn’t do so, any dif-. .

ferences would be ironed outin‘
a conference committee.

Metcalf-Montoya was intro-

duced in the Senate early in the -
1965 session by Sens. Lee‘ Met- ‘
“calf (D-Mont. ), Joseph. Montoya I 

(D-N.M..), and Frank Moss (D-
Utah). Sen. McNamara of Mich-

igan is-expected to introduce“

Some Election Deadlines,

Now Near in Key 1966] ~

Key Congressional elections will take place this November,

with liberals -striving to -hold on to or strengthen the majorities

they now enjoy in both houses. In addition to the races for the

the lower house that will occur in every state, 33 states have 1.

Senatorial contests in store.

On the state government level, legislative seatslwill be filled ‘

in almost every state and gubernatorial races are on tap in 35.

eviews Its First Decade;
 for Future

SAN FRANCISCO, Calif.—Eight new vice-presidents were elected at the-AFL-CIO convention here last month,
at which 928 delegates reviewed the first 10 years of the merged labor organization and drafted a program for

1966 and years to come.

High on the list of priorities is continued effective political action to ensure the re-election this year of many
freshmen Congressmen who have been crucial to the passage of much Great Society legislation. Labor, the con-
vention noted, helped produce a net gain of two liberal Senators and 51 members of the House in the 1964 elections.
A convention resolution, at the same time, pointed out the danger that many of these Congressmen could be
extremely vulnerable to massive attacks launched against them by such conservative groups as the Chamber of

Commerce, the American Med-
ical’ Association’s Political Ac-
tion Committee, and the Na-
tional Association of Manufac-
turers.

_ The majo-rity party normally
loses seats in the non-presiden-
tial election years, so labor
must be very active politically
in 1966, the resolution warns.

Legislative Goals

Delegates, too, reiterated in
many of the over 200 resolutions
the major legislative goals of
the AFL-CIO and urged Con-
gress to complete this unfinished
business this session. Heading
the list is repeal of Section 14(b)
of the Taft-Hartley Act. The
delegates, some of whom felt
that the Johnson administration
did not fight hard enough on this
issue in 1965, were assured in
a telephoned address to the con-
vention by the President that
Congress would again be urged
to pass a repealer bill. The ad-
ministration, declared Vice-
President Hubert Humphrey, “is
determined to ﬁght and win-
I repeat, to fight and win——the
repeal of Section 14(b),of the
Taft-Hartley Law.”

Other Congressional objectives
of the AFL-CIO include a raise
in, the minimum wage to $2 an
hour, extension of coverage to
“all workers engaged in or af-

fedang interstate commerce,” .

double-time pay for all overtime
work. Another resolution called
for federal legislation to provide
“a rapid reduction of the stand-
ard work-week to 35 hours.”
Noting that “much more re-
mains to be done” in the area of
civil, rights despite the passage
of the 1964 Civil Rights Act and
the 1965 Voting Rights Act, the
convention adopted a resolution
calling for the -creation" of a civil
rights committee by every affili-
ate to facilitate “increased labor

. participation’? .t o w a r d racial .

tion, housing, equal employment ,

opportunity, voting rights, and
equality in the administration of
justice.

Organizing Drive

Although John W. Livingston,
organizing director for the AFL-
CIO, told- the delegates that un-
ion organizing is definitely “on
the up-swing,” a convention res-
olution noted that there are 30
million unorganized but organiz-
able workers in the country. Say-
ing that a large portion of these

‘are young workers, w 0 m e 11

workers, and white-collar em-
ployees, the resolution main-
tained that organizing appeals
must be “responsive to specific
needs” of the group being or-
ganized rather than based on
“general exhortation.” The AFL-
CIO’s Industrial Union Depart-
ment is expected to be key in
attempts to organize “the work-
ing poor” of America——those per-
sons who have jobs, but whose
wage scales keep them at sub-
sistence levels that are classified
as poverty.

The convention pledged “un-
stinting support” for all mea-
sures the Johnson administra-

, tion might find necessary to halt

Cjmmunist aggression in Viet-
nam. Although the re-solution
stressed the military aspects of

the situation there, W a 1 t e r -

Reuther of the United Auto
Workers did succeed in a fight
within the resolutions commit-
tee in adding a short section
mentioning the necessity of fur-
ther attempts at negotiations.

In ﬂoor debate on the resolu- A

tion, Emil Mazey, secretary-
treasurer of the Auto Workers,
said he is
cerned Americans worried about
where we are going in Viet-
nam,” noting that the govern-
ment of that country is a “cor-
rupt —. military dictatorship” not
a representative government. A.

“one of those con—-

Philip Randolph of the Sleeping
Car Porters noted the danger to
many domestic programs, in
terms of available financing, of
a prolongation of the war in
Vietnam. A. Toffoli, secretary-
treasurer of the Colorado Labor
Council, took the floor to state
that he shared Mazey’s concern.

Criticism of Election

A n o t h e r Colorado delegate,
Herrick Roth, president of the
Colorado Labor Council and a
member of the American Feder-
ation of Teachers, somewhat
shook the convention when he
took the floor to criticize the
“pre-se1ection” of candidates for
the AFL-CIO executive council
a11d called for a “real democ-
racy” at the next AFL-CIO con-
vention in 1967.

Roth, nominated from the
floor for a seat on the 27-mem-
ber council, declined to rim, say-
ing he could not win, but took
the opportunity to criticize the
fact that no one except inter-
national presidents serve on the
council. Maintaining that “we
have to be a people’s movement
again,” he said that state and
local labor groups are doing
more to stay in touch with the
rank-and-file.

This was the first time that
council members have been

nomi,_r_ia_ted\ from the -ﬂoor, but —

a system adopted before the
nominations required names to
be listed on the ballot in order
of nomination. George Meany

and Reuther, the two top inter-

national officers, reach a prior
agreement on who will serve and
Meany designated the nomina-
tors on the floor.

“This procedure,” said Roth,
“does not reflect the real life or
spirit of the labor movement,
either its past or present.” Sup-
porting the right to dissent and
claiming that the labor move-

ment has become great “be-

cause we are dissenters,” Roth

s aid his candidacy “indicates.

what the local labor leader real-
ly believes.”

German Defeated

Pat Gorman, secretary-treas-
urer of the Amalgamated Meat
Cutters, ran as an independent
for a spot on the council, without
Meany’s endorsement, and
picked up 2,369,845 votes in his
losing effort of the 12,787,824 rep-
resented and cast at the conven-
tion.

Meany, who has served as
president of the AFL-CIO since
the merger’ 10 years ago, was
re-elected to his sixth term with-
out opposition, as was Secretary-
Treasurer William F. Schnitzler.
Of the 27 vice-presidents elected
to the executive council, eight
are newcomers.

Ralph Helstein, president of
the Packinghouse Workers, who
always in the past had been op-
posed by Meany, this time was
a member of the slate. Other
new vice-presidents are P. L.
Siemiller of the Machinists, Da-
vid Sullivan of the Building Ser-
vice Employees, I. W. Abel of
the Steelworkers, Hunter P.
Wharton of the Operating Engi-
neers, Paul Jennings of the In-
ternational Electric, Radio, and
Machine Workers, George Bur-
don of the Rubber Workers, and
Anthony J. DeAndrade of the
Printing Pressmen.

, Eight vice-presidents did not
seek re-election, including David
J. McDonald of Steel and James
B. Carey of IUE, who were de-
feated in recent elections Within
their own unions.

The changes reduces the aver-
age age of executive council
members from 67 to 62.

Brown Statement

Elmer Brown, president of the
International Typographical Un-
ion, in a sharply-worded state-
ment sometime prior to the con-

Herrick Roth’
Asks Election Reform

vention had called for,“an in?
fusion of new, vigorous blood in
the leadership of the AFL-CIO.”,
In an editorial in the November
issue of his union’s magazine,

Brown discussed the failure of C

Congress to repeal Section 14(1)) '
of Taft - Hartley in 1965- and‘
warned labor not to “tie its kite
to political groups and politi-
cians who make pro-labor talks
before election.” “The Demo-.
cratic party,” he continued, “has
a first mortgage on the top AFL-

CIO leadership, paid for by let- _

ting them get into the limelight
occasionally as advisers to the

State Department or to share ' A

membership on some govern-
ment advisory board.” ' ’ ,

Stating that his criticism was
intended to be constructive,

Brown also urged that the AFL- ’

CIO “submerge petty grud'ges”~
and return to its ranks ‘,‘the

teamsters, the longshoremen and -

warehousemen, the mine work-
ers, and other unions which rep-
resent militant rank-and-file un-
ionism in this country.”

A resolution to that effect,,
which Brown submitted at the

convention, was referred to the —

executive council.

 TV—Things Are Looking Brighter
{For the Consumer

 If you are wondering whether the time has come to join view-
..ers -who are plunking down several hundred dollars each to see in
 color an increasing choice of television programs on all networks,
’.'jConsumers Union has some encouraging news. The January issue
I: of CONSUMER REPORTS carries ratings of 15 color TV set
 models. Brighter and better quality pictures were found to be the
- rule in most sets due primarily to the new red phosphor used In
tube manufacture.

  Rosy as the picture is, it has a darker side, too. The demand
f_or,s_e.ts has made discounts hard to come by and a price survey in

"market pressure might be expected to ease after the Christmas
rush, delivery on some models that have been in short supply may
2 continue to be uncertain. CONSUMER REPORTS makes the point
-.. _  that", unlike black and white sets, every color set requires a
 ,;.,.ser.viceman to make the initial picture adjustment—and the ser-
‘ 2  vicemen are being kept very busy.

3 .  ' ' ‘The picture quality of black and white pictures on the check-
” - . 7'-rated color‘ sets matched those of previously check-rated black-
 ‘ _-,;.-and-white sets. Even those color sets not check-rated showed
‘O ; '—-better bla.ck-and-white pictures than any color set tested before
 1965. ‘As ‘a result, CU’s previous complaint that black and white

.-— ' » ‘pictures’ were less than satisfactory in color can be dropped. Color
~' jfidelity‘ was good in all tested sets. To prevent disappointment,
 . Consumers Union cautions that the quality of transmission is not
 :-»always good and that, therefore, too many color programs still
 - ‘leave. much to be desired.

1 ‘The 21-inch sets with round picture tubes and list prices of

 
 
 
 
 
  
   
 
 
  

 

‘ «inches ‘from the wall. You can get somewhat slimmer color TV
" fisets, about 22 or 23 inches in depth, by going to the considerably
 more expensive 23-inch and 25-inch models. These are all con-
: Jsoles ‘ranging in price from $500 to $600 and up.

_ The 23-inch and 25-inch models, because their picture screens
 f are rectangular, show more of the rectangular picture transmitted
, 1 by the station, though the images are about the same size as on the
g ,‘ rounded 21-inch sets. However, the 23-inch screen adds only about
‘ ,9 square inches and the 25-inchscreen only about 30 square inches

—-  '.to.the'265 square inch total picture area of the 21-inch models.

_ ‘Small screen color sets are also coming. At least one 16-inch
..:and one 11-inch set are already on the market, and 19-inch screens
j,_a.re‘-being advertised as available soon. ‘

. Consumers Union points out several factors you may want to
consider before you dash down to the nearest TV store. Adjusting
::the color controls takes practice and patience. You will probably
..have to adjust controls for good color each time you switch from a

7, color program on one channel to a color program on another. For
_’'best results you might have to adjust the tint when there is a
{shift from program to program, from live transmission to tape, or
"_.-_.--from outdoor to indoor scenes. While VHF channels are easy to
tune, in,‘ UHF are less so. Most sets have a UHF dial which is
tuned like a radio. Only one model had a five push-button, car-
 radio type, device—a laudable innovation. While some sets had
«lighted VHF‘ channel numbers and UHF dial, others had neither.
Jglf you don’t have a roof antenna in good condition, you are almost
_ certain, to need to refurbish it or replace it for satisfactory color

 reception. . . '

 1 -' Finally, a color TV set would not only cost more to buy than
1 :a, comparable black and white set, but somewhat more to operate.
. At 3c per ‘kilowatt hour, with five hours of use daily, the difference

’\

vwouldvbe about'70c a month.~The installed cost of a 21-inch replace- '

/m'ent- color tube would run about $150, compared to about $50,'for.
‘:':',itlie-[same size black and white tube. In the earlier days of color
"TV,=’f'a service contract was a virtual necessity. Today, according
j,C_onsumers Union, things seem to have improved, and the owning
___of'?a...current color TV set is not in itself a reason’ for buying a
.$3:1fvice’contract. - However, you may still want to invest in a service
;'c‘o',nt'ra_ctt if you have‘ reason to doubt that you can get good ser-
vicegwithout one.
And what about color in “fringe” areas? If you live in an
_reaf that produces only strongly “snowy” pictures in blackand
g'._vghite, even with a good antenna on the roof, CU advises you not
’j,:jto§b.uy,‘a"color set. If you are in a “near-fringe” area, with mod-
/=;eratel-y-‘weak signals, the snow in the color picture is likely to take
 onéthe‘ color of the objects across which it passes, and the picture
‘ Iygvbe. more satisfactory. CU-’s tests show that sets vary in their
,,o,rman.ce. If you live in such an area, it is important that you
est; _a set that ranks relatively high in fringe reception.

 Isk,,Brokes—Do You Need Them?

[L‘ast'yéar few U. S. cars offered a choice between conventional

drum {brakes and a combination of rear wheel drums and front

, g wheel/disk brakes, For 1966 all the leading manufacturers are
 - offering-disk brakes either as standard equipment on one or more
' models or as optional equipment on others. Consumers Union has
;e,stted-one disk equipped car of each manufacturer offering them
asgan option, ‘to determine how worthwhile they are. The test re-

"ults are published in the January 1966 issue of CONSUMER RE-
PORTS. Results on the full-size cars were quite disappointing in
important respect. They all had power-assisted braking sys-

‘gins which were found to lack the excellent braking control of the
joiipower-assisted disk brakes tested on a smaller car last year.

GU :-recognizes that disk brakes on cars as heavy as the full-size
édans-require a power assist, but they feel the manufacturers

-aw a?v.e~-‘gone too far and have robbed the driver of badly needed

 

rake’- “feel.” ‘

so little effort is required to apply the power disk brakes that
is-6.-easy. to throw a car into a skid. While a driver could be ex-
_ted to -accustom himself to a light brake‘ pedal for a normal
.t_.o'p, it would be difficult for most drivers to avoid skidding in a
mac‘ stop. «

 

An“',‘unwelcome corollary to power-boosted brakes (disk or '

B ’   Q i '0 on Spending
WASHINGTON, D. C.—Despite the impressive domestic accomplishments of the
89th Congress last year, the legislators who will reconvene here at noon Monday, Jan.

10 face a sizable number of unfinished tasks. _Among these are the major legislative
proposals of the American labor movement, virtually none of which came up for final

action in 1965.

Labor’s top priority is repeal of Section 14(b) . of the Taft-Hartley Act, which
now allows states to pass laws banning the union shop. But other important goals
are an increase in the federal minimum wage and an extension of its coverage, en-
actment of a federal unemployment compensation law, and passage of a common

situs picketing bill to protect construction trades workers from multi-contractor action-

aimed at breaking their union
security. Labor, too, would like
to see legislation calling for
double-time pay for overtime
work, rather than the now pre-
vailing time-and-a-half, as a
spur to the creation of additional
jobs.

Tough battles are expected on
all of these measures. The fight
for repeal of 14(b),'for example,
undoubtedly will run into‘ an-
other filibuster in the Senate,
led by Minority Leader Everett
Dirksen of Illinois.

Fortunately, on the other
hand, these proposals generally
are not ones which would in-
volve large sums of federal
money, for it is in the area of
federal spending that the pros-
pects for 1966 are clouded.

“One of Washington's franker
beau‘ties,”’ reported Tom Wicker
in the New York Times last
week, “complained the other
day that no matter how low she
wears her neckline these days,
she can no longer catch the at-
tention of men at cocktail par-
ties.” Her explanation: “They’re
always off in the corner talking
about Vietnam.”

It is this issue—-the war in
southeast Asia and the tremen-
dous increase in U. S. military
involvement in recent months-
that is vastly changing the Con-
gressional outlook now from
what it was a year ago. The
Great Society without doubt is
likely to feel the bite of war in
terms of the finances available

for domestic programs.
Congress in the past session

committed $1.7 billion for Viet-

nam, but estimates on the addi-

tional funds needed range from
$3 to $12 billion.

Cuts Very Possible

To meet such costs, Congress
and the administration may well
begin to cut into welfare spend-
ing or, at the very least, try to
hold the line against increases.
This comes at a time when
many of the new programs are
just getting off the ground. War
on Poverty officials, for ex-
ample, had hoped for a doubling
of this year's budget—-a hope
that, with a continuation and
escalation of the war, has little
chance of being realized.

Senator Robert Kennedy (D-
N.Y.), who has declared that
any reductions in domestic pro-
grams would “split our society
irretrievably,” has suggested
that President Johnson should
seek Congressional approval pri-
or to taking any further large
new military steps in Vietnam.
Its effect upon domestic pro-
grams undoubtedly is one of the
reasons that more Congressmen
and Senators are expressing
concern about the Vietnam war
and that a full-fledged Congres-
sional debate on the issue is
more likely this session.

Although Democrats, hoping
to avoid the non—presidential
election year losses normally
suffered by the majority party
by having sufficient time to
campaign, would like to see an
early adjournment, there are
many other holdover items that
require attention.

Other items

Among them are the«“truth-
in-packaging” and “truth-in-

problem inherent in the power-assisted disk brakes in the three
cars tested makes this option of doubtful value in such cars.‘ It

remains to be seen" whether the opposite conclusion may yet be

models or models with engines that are too powerful for the size

of the car.

tremely important to the ‘na-
tion's consumers. The home rule
bill, designed to restore self-
government to the District of
Columbia, last year passed the
Senate but was killed in the
House and will come up again.

A joint Senate-House commit-
tee has been studying many pro-

posals to modernize and.re'form‘-

Congressional procedures. A few
of these may be acted upon in
1966. .

The 14(b) repealer, passedby
the ‘House last -year, awaits only
Senate action. Cleared for action
in the House are minimum -wage
law changes which would:gradu-
ally up the minimum‘ to $1.15

erage to various groups includ-
ing farm workers. The House
Ways and Means Committee has
completed hearings on unem-
ployment compensation im-
provements and should have a

bill prepared and introduced .

early in the session.

Another extremely important
battle will take place in the Sen-
ate on the issue of reapporti_on-
ment. Senator Dirksen will
again push his proposal to per-
mit states to apportion one
house of their legislatures on a
basis other than population—a
proposal that Senate liberals de-
feated by a relatively narrow
margin in 1965.

 Copper Supply Remains Tight

  In Spte of  to-ckpie 

In spite of releases of copper from the national stockpile, trade observers see no
loosening of the the supply market of the metal, and there is now speculation that
the 36-cent price may not hold through 1966. J. W. Hitchman, Chilean correspondent
for the big Wall Street house of Bache and Company, says, “The idea of 40 cents
,—(for Chilean copper) in the beginning of 1966 is by no means impossible.” '

I World-wide, the copper pic-
ture looks like this:

0 United States: The U. S.
continued a net importer of
copper.'- Imports between Jan-
uary and October exceeded ex-

- ports by about 54,000 tons. How-
ever, because of the tight world
supply picture, U.S, net im-

.- ports for the first 10 months

of 1965 were only about one-
third of the total net imports
«for 19.64.

Meantime, negotiations be-

during the strike, are set to
resume. The current contract
expires on Jan. 2. The union
presented its demands for

increase in wages and fringes.
Braden rejected the demands

' and further negotiations are ex-

pected to get under way shortly.
0 Zambia: Rh0desia’s seces-

. sionist government has created

further tension by announcing
it will blow up the Kariba Dam
power installations if there is
any threat of an invasion of
Rhodesia. The Kariba Dam
stretches almost half a mile
across the Zambezi River, the
border between Zambia and

‘Rhodesia, and supplies 60 per-

cent of the power required by

‘Zambian copper mines.

Several Methods Studied

Several possibilities are be-
ing studied to prevent a break-

‘ down in transport of copper out

of Zambia if the service on the
jointly-owned Rhodesian - Zam-
bian railroad is interrupted.

One is development of air-’

freight shipment of the ore, de-
scribed in the last issue of the
and now in

basis. Cost of air transport-
not including shipment from the
mine to the airport and from
the airport to the docks at Dar
es Salaam—would run about 3
cents per pound. The U.S. is re-
ported ready to supply planes
ifthe airlift becomes necessary
to maintain Zambia’s economy.

Another is th e reported

pledge from Portugal to guar-_
, antee rail shipment of Zambian

copper through Lobito, Atlantic
port city of its East African
colony, Angola. This possibility
is being watched with interest,
in view of Portugal’s reputation
as anti-African, and in view of

the . right-wing views held by

several members of the group

‘controlling the Angolan rail

line. (Benguela Railways is con-
trolled by Tanganyika Conces-
sions, a British concern with
large investments in Africa.
Some of the directors of Tan-
ganyika Concessions are re-
ported to be supporting the Rho-
desian breakaway government

of Ian Smith.)

Long Range Possibility

Studies are also being made
of the feasibility of building an-
other Zambian railway, but
these would be-long range pos-
sibilities with little bearing on

b the present situation.

With the declaration by Presi-
dent Kenneth Kaunda of a state
of emergency, Zambian mining
unions have temporarily called
off proposed action against cop-
perbelt producers until next
year.

At about the same time, in
Rhodesia, the branch chairman
of the white Bulawayo Railway

Workers Union was suspended .

for proposing refusal to handle
shipments of fuel and explosives
for Zambian copperbelt opera-
tions. Any interruption to Zam-
bian copper production by Rho-
desia will be the result of a de-
liberate . government decision,
and it is apparently not ready
to make such a decision.

THE MINE-MILL UNION

M-M Statement to Governor’s Forum
In Denver Covers Labor Law, Pollution

DENVER, Colo.—~Mine-Mill President Al Skinner, in submissions to Governor
John Love on Dec. 8, called for significant improvement in the state’s minimum
wage, unemployment compensation, and. workmen’s compensation laws and asked for
immediate state legislative action on the twin problems of air and water pollution.

The occasion was the final session of 17 grassroots Governor’s Forums held
throughout the state last year. The only one held in Denver, the Dec. 8 meeting took
place in the Century Room of the Cosmopolitan Hotel here, with representatives of
labor, civic, and educational organizations, as well as many individual citizens, pre-
senting their viewpoints and suggestions on a wide range of topics dealing with state

government.

Several Denver legislators were also on hand to listen to the many presentations,
in addition to Love, a Republican, and his aides. With a break for supper the session

lasted from 1:30 p.m. until after
midnight.

Other Labor Speakers

Other speakers. representing
labor groups included Herrick
Roth, president of the Colorado
Labor Council (AFL-CIO), who
touched on a variety of sub-

_ jects, and John S. Shoffstall and

Robert Rothstein, presidents of
the Colorado and Denver Feder-
ation of Teachers respectively,
both of whom urged the gover-
nor’s support for state legisla-
tion which would allow teachers
and other public employees to
bargain collectively. The Den-
ver School Board later in the
month again turned down the
repeated DFT request that a
secret vote be taken among the
city's teachers to select a bar-
gaining agent.

Saying that the plight of
Colorado’s low income workers
lowers the entire economic level
of the state, Skinner termed
“incredible” the p_revailing_ 60
cents to $1 an hour minimum
wage rates in the state. He

‘noted that they apply in the

service industries, which em-
ploy large numbers of Negroes
and Mexican-Americans, and
maintained that they “fly in the
face of the effort to increase

the earning capacity of the dis-

advantaged.”

Pointing out that minimum
wage levels for several classi-
fications of affected workers
were last revised in 1956 and
that for another group the last
revision took place in 1951,
Skinner declared that “if the
war on poverty is to have any
meaning, if the disadvantaged
of Colorado are to be helped, if
real job discrimination is to be
eliminated, drastic improve-
ment in minimum wage levels
must be achieved.”

Turning to unemployment and
workmen’s compensation, he
said, “Here, too, it is the low-
est paid wage earners, with
the least reserves, who are ex-
pected to get along on these
minute sums.” The Mine-Mill
president maintained that un-

employment compensation ben-

efits, now limited to_ a maxi-

mum duration of 26 weeks,
should be payable for the dura-
tion of the period of unemploy-
ment and that the minimum
benefit amount, now $14, should
be raised.

‘Recognition of Reality

“The action of the U. S. Con-
gress in making provision sev-
eral years ago for temporary
extended unemployment com-
pensation was merely a recog-
nition of reality,” said Skinner,
“that lon-g term unemployment
has a vicious spiraling effect
and must be dealt with, in
part, by long term unemploy-
ment compensation.”

He said that a major over-
haul is needed on the Work-
men’s Compensation Act, par-
ticularly with respect to a
broadening of the list of occu-
pational diseases. Already, he
stated, more than half of the
50 states have revised their
laws to _cover all diseases in-
curred as a result of the work-
er’s employment.

Pointing to the current five-
year limitation within which a
worker with silicosis, asbes-
tosis, anthracosis, or radioac-
tive exposure must file a claim,
Skinner urged its elimination,
calling it “unjust, discrimina-
tory, and, in the light of U. S.
Public Health Service studies,
unfounded.”

In his presentation on air and
water pollution, Skinner noted
that Mine-Mill members, be-
cause of the nature of their
work, well know “the terrible
effects on -health of dusty,
fume-laden, gaseous air” and
frequently see “the ruination of
streams that are contaminated
with mine and mill waste.”

Government Action Needed

Maintaining that spontaneous
action by industry, individuals,
and community organizations
can’t be expected to solve the
problems, he urged Love to in-
clude pollution on the Gover-
nor’s Call to the next session of
the legislature. (In Colorado, in
even numbered years, only
items in the Governor’s Call

SKKNNFMVS

MP rm  

 

 

 

plus appropriation measures
can be considered by the legis-
lature.) The legislature, stated
Skinner, should -consider the
availability of funds and other
forms of assistance from the
federal government.

Specific Mine-Mill recom-

mendations urged action to:

O Suppress automobile ex-
haust fumes through com-
pulsory use of effective
devices;

0 Establish a standard of
smoke density and author-
ize communities to’ enforce
such a standard.

Figures of the U. S. Public

Health Service Division of Air
Pollution indicate that 23,000,-

legislative

000 tons of sulfur dioxide are
produced by the activities of
man annually, 80 percent of
which result from the combus-
tion of coal and oil. As the
need for electric power in-
creases, says Vernon G. Mac-
Kenzie, division chief, the sul-
furous air pollution problem
will grow unless control meas-
ures are perfected and em-
ployed.

The time for state action is
now, maintained Skinner, who
also pointed to a federal dead-
line on the submission of state
water pollution control pro-
grams. If Colorado does not
file such a program by June 30,
1967, the U. S. Department of
Health, Education and Welfare
will assume jurisdiction.

Roth's Statement

Roth's presentation at the
Governor’s Forum covered ele-
mentary, secondary, and higher
education in Colorado, the need
for a shifting of the tax load
from regressive sales and prop-
erty taxes to a progressive
weighted income tax structure,
the necessity of imaginative
action to permit
workable systems of metropoli-

vfiilm On Joe Hill Slated;
5-i‘Public to Choose lts Star

  
  
  

 

K.

HOLLYWOOD, Calif.--Producer Laurance Howard
of Adventure Productions has bought the scree11 rights
to “The Black Dawn,” the life story by Zapata Modesto

of labor organizer, poet, and song writer Joe Hill, for
spring production in the story’s actual locales——Utah,
California, Mexico, Canada, and Sweden.

Modesto, who spent 10 years researching the life
of Hill and his death by firing squad 50 years ago, will

-_ write the screenplay.
 U;'I_‘he budget for the film is set at $2 million, but

' may go much higher.

“I am producing,” said Howard in a formal an-
nouncement of the film project in mid-November, “the

'_t:ilm will cover the adventures
‘of Hill in four countries, aside
from the turbulent labor story
to be told.” "'

‘Indicating that several thou-

,.sand members of longshore-
men’s and miners’ unions would
be used in the filming of crowd

,scenes, Adventure Productions
said that premieres of the Hill

flmovie will be held in major
.' cities with parades and demon-

strations by organized labor.

Support Requested

“Due to the controversial na-
‘ ‘ture of the production,” said Ad-

,' venture, “we would like to re-

ceive tens of thousands of let-
*ters in suppo-rt of the project
from all those sympathetic with
our purpose.” The company also
is inviting the public to select
from a list of 11 actors the one

_ ‘it feels best suited “to re-create

the stormy life of labor n.artyr
Joe Hill.” The men listed are
Marlon Brando, Richard Burton,
Kirk Douglas, Charlton Heston,

 Burt Lancaster, Peter O’Toole,

Elvis Presley, Steve McQueen,
'Anthony Quinn, Frank Sinatra,

‘ and Max Von Sydow. Letters of
 support and selection should be
’ addressed to Public Relations
. Department, Adventure Produc-

tions, 932 La Brea, Suite C, Hol-
'*lywood, California, 90038.
, -Hill,«a Swedish immigrant to
the United States, was jailed for

7 strike activities during a long-

shoremen’s strike in San Pedro,
Calif, was pistol-whipped by
vigilantes during the San Diego
free speech fight, and was shot

 in-the leg at the Battle of Mexi-

call“ during the Magonista revolt

‘ " of 21911 in southern California.

-An IWW organizer, he soon be-

V came recognizedas labor’s most

important song writer.

, Dubious Evidence
It was in Bingham Canyon,
Utah, where Hill had come to
organize, that he was arrested

 on Jan. 13, 1914 on a charge of

_ murder. Convicted on the basis

 ‘first major feature film on an American labor organ-
 izer and the first major feature film on an American
' t_:‘j)allad writer. Mainly the color

of dubious circumstantial evi-
dence, Hill was executed on
Nov. 19, 1915, despite calls for
clemency from President Wood-
row Wilson, the Swedish govern-
ment, the national AFL-CIO, and
thousands of workers the world
over.

“All they have against Joe,”
said his lawyer, Orrin N. Hilton
of Denver, a former judge who
was attorney for the United
Mine Workers and counsel for
the Western Federation of Min-
ers, “is that he is IWW.”

The proposed film project, ac-
cording . to Adventure Produc-
tions, already has been given
excellent write-ups in New York
and Los Angeles newspapers.

‘ at THE,,MINE'-MILL. PHELPS DODGE COUNCIL. composed of representatives from Local 551 in Bisbee, Ariz.,

For New Year

Delegates to the Mine-Mill
Phelps Dodge Council, meeting
on Nov. 27, outlined a program
for 1966 and agreed to work for
local unity with "other unions in

the PD chain around such areas . -

as political action, local prob-
lems with the company, and the
integration of the new medicare

program into the existing health

and welfare plans.

Particular emphasis in the
political field will be devoted to
the campaigns for a federal
mine safety law and the repeal
Of Section 14(b) of the Taft-
Hartley Act, which now allows
the existence of state “right-to
work” laws.

Better coverage for retirees
in company hospitals, the_ group
agreed, must be a primary ob-
jective in the integration of
medicare. ’

Report From Pinsky

At another council meeting on
Dec.‘ 17, delegates heard a de-
tailed analysis of the medicare
program by Paul Pinsky, the
union’s insurance consultant.
Following the meeting, other
unions representing PD proper-
ties on the local and regional
levels were contacted to discuss
thejpossibility of joint action in
such integration.

The council at its Nov. 27
meeting voted a $100 contribu-
tion to the Mine-Mill “conspir-
acy” case defense fund.

Attending that meeting were
J. B. Chavez and Ricardo
Estrada of Local 501 in El
Paso, Texas; William Friend
and Buren Elkins of Local 551
in Bisbee, Ariz.; David Velas-
quez, council chairman, Edward

Marquez, and Frank Morales, 

all of Local 616 in Morenci,
Ariz.; Board Member M. R.
Barraza, the council coordina-
tor; and‘ Sylvain Schnaittacher
and Charles Wilson, interna--
tional representatives.

The El Paso delegates were
unable to be present at the
later meeting, which was at-'
tended by the others listed
above plus Pinsky, International
President A. C. Skinner, Carl A.

the U.S. Metals Refinery in 1906, and was taken over as a Wholly owned subsidiary
.. by American Metal in 1920. Carteret is a custom operation handling a variety of non—ierrous metals, including preci-

7ou'ss metals. However, the bulk of its operations are in copper. In 1902, the plant had a capacity of 1,500 tons of

blister copper a month. Latest available figures are for 1964 which showed a production of 208,000 tons of copper,

' plus. other metals.

concentrates per year, and about 8,000 tons of zinc when it is in
production late in 1967. The lead concentrates will be sold to the
American Smelting and Refining Company which will construct a
smelter in Missouri with a capacity of about 100,000 tons of re-
fined lead per year.‘ The smelter also will process concentrates
from_ a lead mine which AS&R plans "to develop in Missouri.

The Kennecott mine will be highly automated and will employ
only about 225 persons on a two-shift operating schedule.

In a joint venture, American Metal Climax and Homestake will
spend $35 million to develop a lead ‘mine, mill and smelter near
Buick, also in southeast Missouri. The smelter will produce 50,000
tons of refinedlead per year from the Amax-Homestake concen-
trates and 50,000 from a mine beingdeveloped jointly by subsid-
iaries of Consolidated Mining and Smelting Company of Canada,
Ltd. and Magnet Cove Barium Co. I -

The Amax-Homestake mine will also produce 10,000 to 15,000
tons of zinc concentrates ‘per year. Like the Kennecott project,

_Amax-Homestake will be highly automated and employment at the
mine, mill, and smelter will total only between 300 and 400 when r

they are in operation in late 1967. L _
The two new smelters in Missouri will be the first lead smelters
to be built in this country in over 40 years. '

,The Bureau of Mines has developed a method of reclaiming
silver from used"film-fixersolution. Large" volume users‘ have
been able to ‘save the metal from discarded solution, but it has
been uneconomical so far for small photo labs and hobbyists. The

" ‘Comin’co's $130 Million Expansion
Consolidated. Mining and Smelting Company and its subsidi-

tion inthe Northwest Territories, has been shipping high grade

ore to the CM&S smelter at Trail, B. C. since last November, and
since—last March has also shipped about 1,000 tons a week to
Bunker Hill at Kellogg, Idaho. The mill at Pine Point will be in
operation before theend of this year.

Capacity of the Trail smelter has been increased, but it will
not handle all of the Pine Point" production. ‘CM&S, in cooperation
with Mitsubishi Metal Mining Co., is developing plans for a 30,000-
ton per year lead smelter in Japan_. This plant will be supplied

with concentrates from Pine Point. CM&S_ is also‘ constructingal

Aospheric Lead

‘A three-day conference on lead poisoning held in Washington, D.C. last month under U.S. Pub-
lic Health Service auspices questioned the long-standing yardstick for determination of lead poisoning
hazards. Traditionally, lead content in the body has been measured in blood and urine samples. Be-
low/a/<:ertain level, the ‘individual was considered “safe.”

*~  This doctrine was challenged by a group of scientists, led by the doctor in charge of occupa-

tional medicine at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Evidence was cited to indicate that or-

dinary individuals could be_ affected by lead compounds suspended in the atmosphere.
claimed that minute quantities of lead co

liver damage. Biggest source of
atmospheric lead is auto ex-
hausts. ' _
Industry spokesmen vigorous-
ly challenged this point of view
and held that the present stan-
dards are valid. A spokesman
for Universal Oil ‘Products
Corp., which ‘makes petroleum
refinery equipment, said that
dropping lead as an additive to
gasoline would require conver

- sion of nearly all existing refin-’

eries at a cost of $1 to $3 billion
and raise the cost of gasolineby
one to three cents per gallon.

The U.S. Public Health Ser-
vice will evaluate the informa-
tion presented at the confer-
ence, seek further data, and
then formulate recommenda-
-tions.

Action in the field of lead
poisoning may be spurred by
scheduled for the
forthcoming session of Con-
gress. The Special Senate Sub-
committee on Air and Water
Pollution, chaired by Senator
Edmund S. Muskie (D-Maine),
will hold hearings on lead con-
taminationin the atmosphere.

New Look at Disabled

Worker Urged

The Industrial Hygiene Foun-
dation, which describes its
members as “citizens, as pro-
fessionals in the health field,
and as advisers to business
management,” is proposing that
industry take a new look at the
disabled worker. Says the foun-
dation, “We should use our
combined best efforts to redi-
rect the thrust of Workmen’s
Compensation administration in
the direction of a thoughtful
concern for the restoration of

_ the injured worker to maximum

productivity, with the least
amount of lost time from his
job and the greatest degree of
physical recovery attainable. If
this -could be our primary goal,
rather than the amount and
character of monetary benefits,
with endless dispute over liabil-
ity and disability issues in the
hearing room or in the courts,

Proiecr Rehab
In New York City.

Two years ago the New York
City Central Labor Council es-
tablished, with the aid of a
grant from the U.S. Vocational
Rehabilitation Administration,
its Labor Rehabilitation Liaison
Project. Purpose of the project
is to help members of Council-
affiliated unions, and their fam-
ilies, who need care and re-
habilitation because of mental,
.physical or emotional disabil-
ities.

The project has handled over
1,300 cases since June 1, 1963.
It works by bringing together
the disabled person and the full
resources, public and private,
that are available for such
care. Theproject has provided
500 uniori‘, members who have
been.trained to -act as assistants
to caseworkersf and to voca-
tional guidance experts.

Project Rehab’s first job was
to make known to its mem-
bers that such care is available,
and to stress the importance bf
getting rehabilitation care be-
fore it’s too late. Its services

. _ include: ’

OVocational guidance where
a disabled worker’s job is
threatened; training for work-
ers who need to develop special
skills.

0 Assistance where there are
debts or insufficient income to
meet living_ expenses _or rehabil-
itation needs.

O Family counseling, home-
maker service, legal aid, hous-
ing aid, help in finding day care
for children, etc.

members to agencies which can
