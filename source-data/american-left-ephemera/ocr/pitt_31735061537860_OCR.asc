a particularly warm devotion to the movement for Jewish people’s
unity in all its forms. And in passing let us also take note of the
unusually important fact that the separation between the Ameri-
can-born Jews and the immigrant ]ews is also beginning to disap—
pear in the surging movement of Jewish people’s unity.

We must especially emphasize the strength of the Jewish unity
 movement, however, among the Jewish workers of America and
 in those trade unions where there are large numbers of Jewish
E  workers. The Jewish workers of America, as a part of the general
  labor movement of our country, are making a great contribution
 to the war, and to the victory of America. They have already
1 if begun to recognize that they have a special responsibility for the
building of Jewish people’s unity in America. It is necessary that
the greatest numbers of the Jewish workers in America should be
permeated to the fullest extent with the consciousness that they,
the Jewish workers, are the backbone of our people, of its unity
in the struggle against Hitlerism, in the struggle for our future
and our continued existence. And it is this spirit which is begin-
ning to grip ever broader sections of Jewish workers and of Jewish
labor organizations. This can be seen in almost every trade union
with a large Jewish membership. It can be seen in the work of the
Jewish Section of the International Workers Order; it is to be seen
wherever Jewish workers labor and ﬁght.

The splendid campaign for Tanks and Bombers for the Red
Army, which was conducted by a number of Jewish labor and
fraternal organizations in the last few months (the Jewish Section
of the International Workers Order, trade unions, landsman-
schaften, Icor, Ikuf, the Jewish Musical Farband) dramatically
proved how ready the Jewish masses are for Jewish unity. The
campaign also showed, through the organization of the Committee
of Jewish Trade Unionists for Tanks and Bombers, that the Jew-
ish workers in this country, native—born as well as immigrant,
take'their place in the front ranks of the movement for Jewish
 people’s unity. ‘

 When, for example, in Chicago, the American Jewish Congress
1 and the Jewish Council for Rusisan VVar Relief decided to under-
take a joint campaign, in which the broadest sections of the Jewish
population are involved, it was proof that Jewish people’s unity is
growing, even though it is still far from achievement. And when
the Jewish Trade Union Committee for Tanks and Bombers,
aﬂiliated with the campaign for field hospital ifnits for the Red
Army led by the United Jewish War Effort of the American
10

Jewish Congress, it proved again that the unity movementvgrows
even though it is confronted daily with obstaclesand hindrances.
A It is necessary to say a few words here about the obstacles.

WHO ARE THE OPPONENTS OF JEWISH
PEOPLE'S UNITY?

IIIHERE are opponents and opponents. There are opponents
who are essentially enemies of Jewish people’s unity, people
who do not stop at anything, if only unity can be prevented. And
there are also passive opponents, people who love to talk about
the diﬂiculties of unity and who love to boast that they doubt
the possibility of any unity which includes Communists. It is
necessary, then, to discuss these various kinds of opponents in vari-
ous ways.

There is, for example, the group which directs the Iewish
Daily Forward. These are opponents of Jewish people’s unity to
the bitter end, so to speak. And it is not always possible to talk
about them as mere ideological opponents of unity. Most of the
time they act as outright enemies of unity.

As is well known, the Jewish Daily Forward group operates
primarily with one technique-the danger of Communism, the
danger of the “reds.” The line of the Jewish Daily Forward is-
“No unity with the Communists.” And since almost every advo-
cate of Jewish people’s unity is either a Communist or a fellow-
traveler in the eyes of the Iewish Daily Forward group, it becomes
clear that the Forward must always ﬁght every attempt at Jewish
people’s unity with every weapon at its command. It is clear,
therefore, that we are justiﬁed in saying of this type of opponent
of Jewish people’s unity, that they are enemies of Jewish people’s
unity, and that their red—baiting has grave consequences for the
Jews of America and for American national unity as a whole.
This must be understood as simply as it is said because we are
dealing here with a Jewish manifestation which is comparable
——if not in its origin, then in its consequences——to the political
trends which are grouped around the Dies Committee and similar
forces.

It is, of course, a source of deep pain and shame that this
should exist among Jews at a time when the very physical exist-
ence of our people is at stake. But it is a fact, from which we
must draw deﬁnite conclusions.

I1

 

 

There are also opponents of another type, who cannot be put
in the same category with the leaders of the Jewish Daily For-
ward. We refer here to those people who think they have deep-
seated grievances against the Communists of which they cannot
free themselves. By their reason these people would want unity,
but their heart doesn’t let them.

There are still others who see, by virtue of their own under-
standing, that Jewish people’s unity is a vital necessity and that

_ Communists are extremely helpful in this unity. They therefore

favor unity. But—what? They do not believe—so they say——
that the Communists, particularly the American Jewish Com-
munists, will long retain their present unity policy. In other
words this means that unity with the Communists would be very
good, but—one cannot be sure of the Communists!

To these opponents as you can see, we have to talk, and if need
be at great length; and not because they express the sentiments
of broad sections of the people. The broad masses of our people,
no matter what they think about the correctness or falsity of the
Communist philosophy, desire full people’s unity, including the
Communists. Irrespective of this it is a fact that many Jewish com-
munity leaders and writers belong to this category of opponents
of people’s unity, who think that they cannot be too sure of the
American Jewish Communists. This matter must therefore re-
ceive great attention. It is our ﬁrm conviction that when they
will read Browder’s book and be honest with themselves, they will
begin to think somewhat differently of this entire matter.

As for ourselves, there is one point we should like to make in
this Introduction. The American Jewish Communists, and those
social forces which ordinarily collaborate with the Communists
have already shown not only by their words, but by their deeds,
that Jewish people’s unity is their most serious concern. They
have shown that the interests of the Jewish people and of the
various Jewish communities in all parts of the world are just as
near to their hearts as to those of all other Jews, to say the least.
They have also shown in the course of many years, that when it
comes to ﬁghting against fascism, they are not in the rear ranks
and also not among the spectators on the sidelines, but are ac-
tually locked in physical combat with the worst enemy of our
people.

Now it is possible and necessary, however, to say more than
this. On the basis of Earl Browder’s fundamental conclusions
on the stability of American national unity and of the unity of

12

the United Nations, we say: The idea of Jewish people’s unity
is not a temporary or passing thought in the minds of the jewish
Communists, but a long and lasting matter. The Jewish Com-
munists. believe that our country’s present war against the Axis
and victory over the Axis make solid and enduring bonds of col-
laboration between all the forces among the Jewish people in our
country—both possible and necessary. This collaboration is neces-
sary to achieve victory and for the building of a free life for our
people after the victory. This is how Earl Browder pictures this
problem from the standpoint of the entire American people and
of all the United Nations! Let the Jewish reader, therefore, pay
particular attention to those parts of the book which deal with this
problem.

A few special words are in place here on the Zionists in con-
junction with Jewish people’s unity. This is necessary, ﬁrst,
because the Zionists occupy a very important position in Jewish
social life. Secondly, also, because too manyfalse notions are cir-
culating regarding the attitude of the Jewish Communists to Zion‘-
ism on the one hand, and to Palestine on the other. Perhaps the
American Jewish Communists are themselves partly to blame for
the circulation of false notions, even among honest people. But
the time is over-ripe for people who want to know the truth to
get the truth.

The American Jewish Communists have made it clear for a
long time, that they differentiate between Zionism as a political
movement and party, and between the Jewish Yishuv (commu-
nity) in Palestine. Naturally, the Jewish Communists have differ-
ent attitudes towards these two realities. The Jewish Communists
recognize the Jewish community in Palestine as an important
part of our people——a community which is building an organized,
national life in that part of the world, in Palestine. Further, we
all have a high esteem for the contributions to the present war
against the Axis which are being made by the Jewish community
in Palestine. It is because of this that the American Jewish Com-
munists are of the opinion, which they have expressed many times,
that American Jews should in every possible way support the de-
mand of the Jewish community in Palestine to be enabled to par-
ticipate fully in the war as a free and organized national com-
munity. _

In taking such a position, which is by now widely known,
the Jewish Communists have had no need to make, and did not
make, any break with their fundamental conviction that the fu-

13

ture of the Jewish community in Palestine, which American
Jews must help build, lies in earnest and brotherly collaboration
between all the peoples of the Near and Middle East, and above
all between the Jews and the Arabs, in Palestine itself, and in all
the other countries in that part of the world. On the contrary,
this type of fraternity between the Jewish community in Palestine
and the Arabs does not contradict the welfare and progress
of the Jews and their further development as a free and organized
Jewish national community. Both these things go hand in hand.
As to the Zionist movement, it is only one tendency among
many in Jewish social life—-a tendency which has its own philoso-
phy on the nature of Jewishness and which conducts its own
policy as a party on the question of Palestine. It is understood
that Communists are not Zionists. Communists strive for a so-
ciety which is free of every type of oppression and exploitation.
Their teachers are Marx, Engels, Lenin and Stalin. Communist
ideology has absorbed the best and ﬁnest traditions of freedom
of our Jewish people, of our America, and of all peoples. It is the
proletarian ideology of a new social order, and of necessity it dif-
fers widely from Zionist ideology. If the issue today were one of
battling among the Jewish people as to which of these ideologies,
the Zionist or Communist, is more correct, then this certainly
would be the main conﬂict between Communists and Zionists.
But is it still necessary to convince anybody at this time that this
is not the main question-—that the main problem is how all Jews
of all ideologies can work together in order to save our people?
If this is so, it follows logically that Communists, Zionists, Social-
ists, and all other Jews can work together on a common people’s
platform of Jewish unity, as part of American national unity,
against the main enemy. ‘
When we talk of Jewish people’s unity, we mean a platform
which embraces and defends the interests of the Jewish people
in all countries, among all nations, regardless of the social order
or system in which they live. True, there are some Zionists who
are fearful of the fact that the Jewish community in Palestine
has ceased to be a party matter of a single political orientation
among the Jews and has become a matter for theeentire‘ Jewish
people. We really do not see why they should be afraid, unless
their motives are only of a narrow and partisan character. It is
clear, however, that Zionists who see this issue from the stand-
point of the people as a whole greet this fact and we are hopeful
that they will draw the necessary conclusions from this, namely,
14

W  ;;‘*“r::.-:=:- 7:: -:2:-:1 :-1”-.7

 “ ur-

 

:

that Zionists and non—Zionists, including the Communists, can
work together for Jewish people’s unity also on the question
of the Palestine Yishuv.

This is not the place, nor is it the task of one person or group,
to outline a program for Jewish people’s unity. But it is necessary

’ and correct, to point out the direction towards which such a pro-

gram should lead.

Therefore, we say the following. All the Jews of America,
regardless of party or class, should be able to work together for
the war, for the victory of our country, to strengthen American
national unity around our Commander-in-Chief, for the uproot-
ing of anti-Semitism, and together with it, the Fifth Column and
all its activities which stir up one section of our population against
the other. This Jewish people’s unity should work for the ever-
growing solidarity of the United Nations and for the strengthen-
ing of the alliance between England, the Soviet Union and the
United States. J

‘On the basis of such common work, in which the Jewish labor
movement in America and the American Jewish Congress can and
should play a very important role, Jewish people’s unity must
exert its inﬂuence towards the establishment of close and brotherly
relations between the Jews of America and our brothers in the
Soviet Union.

This is an absolute must for our people. Let us be very direct
about this: THOSE JEWS IN OUR MIDST WHO PREVENT
THE ESTABLISHMENT OF CLOSE AND BROTHERLY
TIES BETWEEN THE JEVVS OF AMERICA AND THE JEWS
OF THE SOVIET UNION, HARM THEREBY NOT ONLY
JEWISH PEOPLE’S UNITY —- W'HICH IN ITSELF IS
SERIOUS ENOUGH — BUT THEY ALSO HARM THE
STRENGTHENING OF THE TIES BETWEEN AMERICA

AND THE SOVIET UNION. They hinder the strengthening of
the Anglo-Soviet-American Coalition. They hamper the strength-
ening of the United Nations, they stand in the way of victory over
Hitlerism.

Jewish people’s unity in America will work for the beneﬁt
of the Jewish community in Palestine. It will have to support
the right of the Jewish Yishuv to participate in the war of the
United Nations as a free and organized national community,
in brotherly alliance with the Arab population in Palestine and

15

 

with all other Arab peoples. The victory of the United Nations
necessitates this. This is necessitated by the future of the Jewish
community in Palestine. V

Jewish people’s unity _in America will collaborate with—and
will support——the Jews of the Nazi—occupied countries in their
struggle for liberation. A united American Jewry will support the
Jews of the Nazi—occupied regions in their demands, after victory
also, that the general democratic liberties of all citizens, as well as
their special national rights, should be guaranteed to them. Such a
united American Jewry could also successfully cooperate with the
Jews of England and Latin America for the general welfare of our
people. A
We hope that the Jewish reader of Browder’s book will be
convinced of the ‘correctness of our arguments, that Jewish peo-
ple’s unity in America is necessary and possible. We hope, too,
that the pressing day to day needs of the war, and the horrible
suffering of our people in the regions, occupied by the enemy
and pillaged so murderously——we hope that these needs of the war
will hasten the consciousness and the actions of the leaders of the
American Jews. Time does not stand still. Every day which
passes without recording some progress along the road of Jewish
people’s unity is an irretrieveable loss. The responsible leaders
of the Jewish people cannot permit themselves to go slowly today.

We must unite. We must isolate and fully defeat those red-
baiting elements in American Jewish life who prevent unity.
Only in this fashion will the American Jews be able to make
their full contribution to the victory of our country and our
people. -

HE Jewish reader will derive special satisfaction from Earl

Browder’s book. First, because this is the ﬁrst book in Yiddish
which presents, and fundamentally answers, the chief problems of
the war, and of victory. Many books have appeared in English
recently dealing with this question. To date, however, no book of
this type has appeared in Yiddish. Secondly, because Browder’s
book enables us to view the special Jewish questions which have
arisen as a result of the war from a new vantage point. We hope,
therefore, that the Jewish reader will enthusiastically greet the
appearance of this book in Yiddish.

Obviously, it is not the object of an introduction to repeat the

contents of the book itself. It is proper, however, to call the
reader's attention to the main points of this work, and especially
to the proper conclusions which can be drawn for the solution of
the important questions which are related to the buildingof jew-
ish peop1e’s unity in this country.
A Earl Browder’s book opens with an evaluation of the character
of the present war. This is not because the people do not already
know why they are ﬁghting against Hitler and against the entire
Axis. The American people are quite well aware that the future
survival of our nation depends upon the outcome of the present
war. But to be aware of this alone, it has been proved, is not
enough. This awareness alone is inadequate-for the complete
mobilization of all of our forces for victory, but it is especially
inadequate for the development of the necessary policies without
which victory would be impossible. T

Therefore, Earl Browder establishes at the very outset that the
present war is a struggle of life and death against the worst enemy
that human progress has ever encountered; that this is a war for
national existence and for national liberation, and that the war
against Hitlerism is developing -as a real people's war.

Of course, there are forces in our social life which hamper the
war effort. "These are primarily and essentially the pro-fascist ele-
ments. They constitute the chief and greatest danger. There are,
however, also forces which, though not pro-fascist, and though
they go along with the people, are not heart and soul in the war.
What" they fear is that this is a People's War, and that the people
are playing and will play the decisive part in victory. As a result
of this we have more than once witnessed vacillations on the part

3

 

 

 

of inﬂuential elements in our country—vacillations which have
not done the war any good. For example, on the question of the
Second Front, and on such questions as the total mobilization of
all the economic resources of our country for the war, and the
necessity for conducting a decisive struggle against the defeatists.

The vacillations of inﬂuential elements in,our country who,
in general, are for the winning of the war, have aroused doubts in
the minds of many people as to their ability to conduct a people’s
war. It is with this question that Earl Browder is chieﬂy con-
cerned in the opening chapters of his book. And what is his
answer?

His answer is that there is no basis for such doubts. He main-
tains that the guarantee that this war will be fought to the end,
regardless of all the vacillation in certain leading circles, stems
from the fact that absolute victory in this war is necessary for our
national existence, for the continuation of our national life, and
also because the determination to win lies “in the hearts of the
masses of the people.” _

From this we proceed directly to the policies which our govern-
ment is pursuing in the present war. In other words we come to
the question: What policies are needed to guarantee a victorious
conduct of the war and ultimate victory? Speaking of this essen-
tial matter, Browder formulates four main points: First, the unity
of the nation; second, the unity of the United Nations; third, the
aquisition of new allies, especially among the peoples of Asia,
Africa, and Latin-America; and fourth, the total mobilization of
American industry for the war. Browder maintains that these
four main points of our nation's policy are interrelated, that they
are all parts of the same program, of the strategy for victory.

Generally speaking, these are the actual policies of our country
and our government. And that is very good. When it comes to
the daily prosecution of the war, however, diﬂiculties are apparent.

When it comes to working out the concrete and practical steps ~

which are necessary for the realization of the war policy of our
government, we see too often, that things are not done with the
necessary speed and determination. We notice that we do not al-
ways have that full degree of necessary national unity which would
lead to the translation into life of the measures, the necessity of
which, presumably, are recognized by all. And this brings Brow-
der to the question: Where do the hindrances and obstacles which
hold back and weaken the war effort of our country stem from?

Naturally, ﬁrst come those dangerous forces in our social life

which are customarily designated as the Fifth Column. The sec-
tions of the book which expose the full meaning of the ﬁfth
column in our country should be read with special attention. We
only wish to call attention here to the importance of the “Memo-
randum” which Browder cites and analyzes in the second chapter.
This Memorandum is essentially a War Platform of American
Fascism, which was prepared by Hitler agents in collaboration
with pro—fascist elements in this country, as far back as 1937.

The main goal of this platform was to make of America what
Hitler succeeded in making of France. This was to be accom-
plished essentially by the same methods, namely, to create in this
country a hostile attitude towards the Soviet Unioniand thus
isolate us from one of our best and most powerful friends. This is
followed by the attempt to whip up a wild anti-Communist hy-
steria in this country, on the basis that Communism is the greatest
danger. And lastly, the formula that the Jews are a great danger
to America and to the world—-in other words, an attempt to whip
up anti-Semitic incitement and to create a pogrom atmosphere in
America.

It is now clear that anti-Semitism was one of Hitler’s chief
weapons. This is still true. Fascists everywhere use anti-Semitism
as their main weapon. We see this in America, in our own coun-
try, where all fascist groups ride high on the saddle of Jew-
baiting, and demand that our people should be wiped out. That
is why the struggle against anti-Semitism has become, and must
become even more, the sacred task of all freedom—loving people,
The conditions must be created which will make it impossible for
anti-Semitism to exist. Let the “Memorandum” remind us again
that the American fascists and agents of Hitler had planned in
1937 a war to the death against the Jews.

The authors of this Memorandum didn’t succeed in their
game. But it would be a mistake to believe that the forces upon
whom Hitler based his plans have completely disappeared, or that
they have become completely powerless. This error must not be
made. Suﬂice it to mention that in the U. S. Congress we have a
Dies Committee and a considerable group of half and ful1—ﬂedged
defeatists, not to speak of the Christian Front, Father Coughlin
and the like. Browder makes a great contribution to victory with
his basic disclosure of the full meaning and the great danger of
red-baiting. -

One may think that professional Communist—hunting and red-
baiting is an innocent pursuit. Upon ﬁnishing Browder’s book,

 

__ _,_______,___.,,V ___,_._._.....__._..___...,___...__ .,

however, one is forced to think quite differently. Browder proves
that red-baiting is the chief weapon with which, in the past, Hitler
was able so successfully to weaken his victims of aggression from
within so as to make the later military task of his armies relatively
easy. -

In what way, actually, does the work of the red-baiters express
itself? Red-baiting seeks to create a non-existent danger—Commu-
nism—in order to hide the actual and urgent danger——Fascism.
That is how it worked for many years throughout the world, pay-
ing Hitler sizeable dividends. Today it doesn't work as well.
People have become wiser, but the danger still‘ exists and red-
baiters are still here. The great value of Browder’s book consists,
ﬁrst, in his exposure of the roots and the dangerous results of red-
baiting. Secondly, he shows that the national unity of the Ameri-
can nation, of all classes and parties who want to win the war,
including the Communists, is not only possible but a vital neces-
sity for victory. This means—-a primary necessity for the continued
existence and liberty of our nation.

Browder also has something very interesting to say about the
attitude of certain patriotic circles to American Communism and
to the Communist Party. There are people among us, as we know,
who are sincerely and honestly for the policy of the United
Nations and for a ﬁrm alliance between our country and the
Soviet Union. But these same people still cannot make peace with
the idea that it is both possible and necessary in our own country
to create a national unity which will embrace all the patriotic
forces in our country. And who can today doubt the patriotism of
the American Communists? As a matter of fact the assertion is
still made that American Communists must be patriotic in the
present war, because they are primarily interested in the Soviet
Union. Certainly this is a one-sided and, therefore, false assertion

The Communists have never denied their concern for the
Soviet Union. But they have always maintained that they were
interested in the Soviet Union precisely because they are con-
cerned ﬁrst with America and the American people. Today al-
most everyone, with the exception of the Fifth Column, is con-
vinced of the patriotism of the American Communists. Never-
theless, we still ﬁnd in certain patriotic circles a feeling and an
attitude that all is not well with the American Communists. This
in itself is bad. At the present moment, however, this becomes
dangerous when the Fifth Column seeks to exploit and to utilize
such moods, in order to stir up anti-Communist movements and

thereby divide our nation and weaken the war effort of our
country.

The conclusion to be drawn from Browder’s treatment of this
question is of extraordinary importance. He proves that just as
the United Nations joins together nations with differing ideolo-
gies and social systems, in the same manner, and to an even greater
extent, various classes and parties with different ideologies in each
country are coming together for the same common objective.
This simple truth must be planted and ﬁrmly ﬁxed in the minds
of all patriotic elements in our country. Without this there can be
no full national unity.

It is understandable, therefore, that the problems of national
unity occupy a prominent place in this book. As the reader will
discover for himself these are not ordinary problems, even though
their purpose is quite easy to grasp. The complexity and the difﬁ-
culty of this subject stem from the fact that we have various
classes and political parties in our country—classes and parties with
radically different ideologies and fundamental programs, which,
nevertheless, are passionately interested in seeing to it that our
country should not fall and that we should defeat our enemies. It
is therefore clear that national unity in our country can and will
be built in one way only: that all classes, groups and parties should
lay aside their differences and should unite for common work on

’ those points on which they are all in agreement. This demands of

every class, group and party a readiness to submerge petty and
narrow interests for the beneﬁt of the immediate and great inter-
ests of our nation. This also demands a readiness on the part of
every section of our population to reconcile the conﬂicts over
lesser ‘questions in a manner which will not harm the greater in-
terest, but, on the contrary, which will serve this interest—-to win
thewar. That is why the fourth section of this book, which deals
with the problem of our war economy, is so important.

It is necessary to underscore here the particular importance of
those sections of the book which deal in a very practical and con-
crete man.ner with the new relations which are being established
and must be strengthened among the existing political parties in
our country—Democrats, Republicans, Socialists, Laborites, Com-
munists; and also among the various classes in our society-—work-
ers, capitalists, farmers, professionals, and so on. From this it can
very well be seen that full national unity is not only necessary, but
also possible of achievement. V

JEWISH PEOPLE'S UNITY AS A FORCE
IN AMERICAN NATIONAL UNITY

s ALREADY indicated, the special value of Browder’s book for
A the Jewish reader lies in the clear light which it casts on the
practical problems of Jewish people’s unity in this country. It
suddenly becomes crystal clear that if American national unity is
possible and necessary, embracing all patriotic forces in the coun-
try, people’s unity among the Jews is certainly necessary and
possible.

It must be said that Jewish unity has made signiﬁcant advances
in the past few months. We can only wonder why this progress
was not faster and greater. What other people in the world faces
any greater danger than the Jewish people?

But Jewish people’s unity is moving forward. This can be seen
and felt at every step. The Jews of America have thrown them-
selves into the war effort heart and soul. Jewish organizations in
many cities are working in unity for the victory of our country.
The masses of the Jewish people demand greater and broader
unity. A year ago the American Jewish Congress, feeling the
pressure of the people, outlined a program for united war effort,
which is supported by many Jewish labor and people’s organiza-
tions, for example, the Jewish People’s Committee and the Trade
Union Committee for Tanks and Bombers. It is unfortunate,
however, that the leadership of the American Jewish Congress has
as yet not taken the necessary steps to realize its own program for
united Jewish war action. This program has to be translated into
life as quickly as possible. ’

The growth of Jewish people’s unity was particularly ex~
pressed in the response of the American Jews to the broad move-
ment which is commonly called “Russian War Relief.” Naturally,
this is no accident. Aid to the Soviet Union, no matter what form
it assumes, was considered from the very beginning by the masses
of American Jews, as well as by the American people as a whole,
as aid for America itself, for us here. It is considered as help for
the war, for victory. And even though there have been and there
still are such (as for example, Hillel Rogoff, N. Chanin, David
Wertheim, and the like) who try to tell the people that aid to the
Soviet Union is not exactly the same as aid for America, neverthe-
less, the Jewish people and the American people generally follow
their own paths.

It is true that the Jewish masses contributed to “Russian ‘War

Relief” with particular enthusiasm, zest, and devotion. But this
too is quite understandable to every American patriot. Our Presi-
dent himself, and the Vice—President, and many prominent leaders
in American life, as well as of the other United Nations, have
more than once explained why this is so. They have said that
Russia has, to date, done more for victory in this war than all the
other United Nations combined. They have pointed out that the
Red Army has fought and is ﬁghting with a bravery and devotion
which was never witnessed heretofore. And that is why we all feel
that we owe the Soviet Union a great debt, and that, no matter
how much we do to repay that debt, we still have not done
enough. Well, what is wrong with this? Actually this feeling, in
itself, is one of the greatest forces for mobilizing our own country
for victory in this war.

Besides this, the Jewish masses in America are particularly in-
terested in the fate of our Jewish sisters and brothers in the Soviet
Union. This is no crime either. And of course, it is no crime, but
on the contrary, quite natural, that the Jewish masses in America
are so enthusiastic and proud of the bravery of the Jewish ﬁghters
in the Red Army. These feelings also enhance the war effort and
Jewish unity in America, and, thereby, also the war effort and the
strength of the American nation. It is no wonder, therefore, that
the Jewish Council for Russian War Relief, which came into
being as an answer of American Jewry to the call-to-—arms of our
Soviet brothers, through the Jewish Anti-Fascist Committee in
Moscow, so quickly became one of the most beloved and most
important forces in Jewish community life in America.

This is not the place to enumerate fully all the forms and
manifestations of the movement for Jewish people’s unity in
America. Yet we must point out such important phenomena as
the aspirations for Jewish people’s unity in the ranks of American
Zionists, and in the circles which are- organized by the American
Jewish Congress. The aspirations for Jewish people’s unity have
found clearer and more deﬁnite expression in the Committee of
Jewish Writers and Artists, under the chairmanship of Dr. Chaim
Zhitlowsky. The strength of these unity tendencies is growing
from day to day among the tens of thousands of Jews who are
organized in various landsmanschaften — a force which must not
be underestimated. The section of the Jewish people in America,
ordinarily referred to as religious Jews, Orthodox and otherwise,
has played no small part in this unity movement. It must be said
that among this particular group in Jewish life, there is noticeable
