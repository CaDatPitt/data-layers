IDn March 15, 1971, at 0045 hours a fragmentation
grenade exploded in an officers barracks in Bien Hoa,
Vietnam. Two lieutenants were killed and a third was
wounded. Captain Rigby and First Sgt. Willis, who usually
slept in these barracks, were not there. when thay arrived
on the scene they decided that the fragging was meant to
kill them, and that the guilty party could only be Private
Billy Dean Smith, a black GI they consided a "troublemaker".

‘They informed the CID (Criminal Investigation Division)
officer of their verdict, and called all the men in the
battalion into formation. Without a single scrap of evi-
dence, Billy Smith was called forward to the front of the
formation. A heavy CID hand slapped his shoulder, and
Billy was told that he was under arrest for murder.

To the two murder charges were added two charges of
attempted murder--against the Captain and First Sargent,
and one count of assault on another captain and two
counts of resisting arrest, all for when he was arrested.

Once they had a theory, the Brass never asked
whether someone else might have done the fragging, or
what the reasons for it might have been. Instead, the
military worked night and day to fit the facts to the
theory--to build a tight case against Billy Dean Smith_

No Evidence

The only direct evidence consists of one item. The Army
claims that they found a grenade pin in Smith's pocket
when he was arrested. This grenade pin has nothing link-
ing it to the grenade that killed the officers. In
addition, none of the six "witnesses" against Billy were
anywhere near the fragging incident. No one even
knows why they will be testifying. ,

Almost all Gls hate the war, the Army, and their
commanding officers. Most believe in fragging, and

have access to fragmentation grenades. Billy's unit

was a combat unit. The officers in his unit were so
afraid of their own men that they locked up the grenades
every night. The fact that there is no special evidence
against Billy Smith is not important t9 the Army. In
their eyes Billy is guilty.

Who is silly?

Billy Dean Smith was born in 1948, tenth in a family
of twelve. He grew up in Watts, and was arrested during
the 1965 insurrection in the city-wide dragnet for curfew
violations. In 1969 he was drafted into the Army. He was
opposed to the war and the Army even then, and wanted to
resist induction, but respected his family's desire that
he not go to jail.

He tried to appear too dumb to be drafted, but found
that next to impossible, and spent his time in boot camp
at Fort Ord, California. He underwent AIT (Advanced
Infantry Training) in artillery at Fort Sill, Oklahoma,
and was sent to Vietnam in October of 1970, where he was
assigned to the command of Captain Rigby.

Captain Rigby and First Sgt. willis spent a lot of
time making life miserable for Private Smith. Smith had
been punished three times within a few months for minor
infractions, and was being processed for a "212" dis-
charge for unsuitability and unfitness. Captain Rigby
did not believe Billy Dean Smith would ever make a good
soldier, saying that the private was unenthusiastic
about "closing with the enemy.”

The Vietnam War has encouraged racist persecution of
blacks by whites. Many white officers are out to get
black enlisted men who refuse to act like slaves. The
oppression of black people, which is part of normal life
In the U.S., goes wild in the army. Being an officer or
a life gives a racist a chance to fulfill his fondest
dreams of giving orders to the ”niggers".

Military Injustice

Since his return to this country from Vietnam, Billy
has been in solitary in the Fort Ord Stockade without
bail. At the same time, Lt. Calley——convicted of the
murder of over a score of Vietnamese civilians--is
allowed many privileges--a private apartment, frequent
visits by his girl friend, full officer's pay, etc.

The difference? Lt. Calley is white, while Smith is
black; Calley killed "gooks", while Smith is accused
of the murder of white American officers; Calley went
right along with the war, while Smith defied it.

Military justice is a lethal weapon. It is being

.used against Billy Smith. The Army is asking and
expects to get the death penalty. It is not a coincidence

that officers--the men who have the most to fear from
fragging--will sit in judgement over Billy. They have
been picked by the same Convening Authority who brought
the charges and recommended the death penalty. They

no doubt have already decided that Smith is guilty.

They intend to murder Billy Dean Smith regardless of the
flimsy nature of the evidence against him. They intend
to murder Billy as casually as they murder the Vietna-

mese people.

Although there have been hundreds of incidents of
fragging in 1970 alone, very few individuals have been
tried until recently. The Army did not want to admit
that its own soldiers are killing their officers. But
now the Brass are scared and are setting up Billy as a
scapegoat. It is no surprise that they selected a black
man, one who had been vocally against the war, and one
who was active politically in his unit.

The black man on the baﬁtle ground is a heavy threat
to the Brass. He understands that he's got a whole lot
more in common with the Asian people he's being ordered
to kill than he does with his white officers that are
ordering him to kill.

"You see yourself fighting for your country
and having your black brothersand sisters
being snuffed back home," Earl Rose, a black
Marine reports. "Then the Army and the
whole society de-humanizes the Vietnamese
into racist groups like gooks and commies
and describes them as dirty and slimy. Then
you realize that those attributes are the
same slanderous remarks you get yourself
in the states."

In a country that sets the white man as "above" and
"superior" to the man of color, it is no accident that

THE BLACK MAN ON THE BATTLE GROUND I

A HEAVY THREAT TO THE BRASS g

in the armed services most officers and people in author-
ity are white, and that they demand a subservient
attitude from "their" troops.

Black, Puerto Rican, and.Chicano GIs are systematically
assigned more dangerous duty than are whites. 18% of the
combat dead have been black; 20% have been Chicano and
Puerto Rican.. Everyone who has been there has seen that

vmany of the highest risk battalions (e.g. airborne) are
as much as 50 to 70% men of color.

1“ his b°°k, Soul On Ice, Eldridge Cleaver tells us:

 

It is no accident that the Us government is
sending all those black troops to Vietnam.
Some people think that America's point in
sending 16 per cent black troops to Vietnam
is to kill off the cream of black youth.
But it has another important result. By
turning her black troops into butchers of
the Vietnamese people, America is spreading
hate against the black race throughout
Asia.

Discrimination in the military is not reserved for the
black and brown GIs alone. Among whites, the casualty
rate for men from poor areas, such as Appalachia, is
twice as high as for whites from any other area.

The military is a racist institution engaged in a
genocidal war against Asians, as well as killing off
its own non-white and poor white men. Setting up Bi11y
for a fragging rap is a clear example of this racist
mentality.

Combat Refusal

Billy came out of an army that is in a state of
increasing collapse. Many men are broken in spirit and
turned into drug addicts. Many more are ready to rebel.
Units in Vietnam today are refusing combat; GIS are
executing their officers in self defense. One Vietnam
veteran writes about conditions:

"Operations have become incredibly rag-tag;
vehicles don't work for lack of maintainance;
helicopters are just falling to the ground,
airfields are falling apart...many guys don't
even put their uniforms on anymore. I am
almost always wearing a pair of keds, a blue
tie-dye shirt and army pants I made into cut-offs.”

"The American garrisons on the large bases are
virtually disarmed. The lifers have taken our
weapons from us and put them under lock and
key...There have been quite a few frag
incidents in the battalion."

The first signs of active resistance in the military
appeared in the mid '60s. In 1966 three GIS from Fort

 

Hood, Texas, refused to serve in Vietnam. A year later
in 1967, Captain Howard Levy, a doctor, refused to train
Green Berets for special Vietnam duty. At the same time
over l2,000 GIS in Europe were deserting in '67 alone,
in order to avoid being transferred to Vietnam.

These acts led up to the first large-scale military
rebellions in this country in August of '68, when 60
black GIS staged a demonstration at Fort Hood Army.base.

They refused to be flown to Chicago for riot control duty.

at the Democratic Convention. There were also reports of
another 150 GIS jailed in the stockade at Fort Carson,

 

   

Colorado for refusing riot duty in Chicago. Fort Hood
military judges, handed down for the most part relatively
light sentences, apparently because of mounting public
pressure and because of the threat of a base-wide rebellion
at Fort Hood if sentences were too severe.

On the-battlefield itself, combat refusal was occurring
as early as Bebruary, 1967. In that month several American
GIS refused to jump from helicopters during an operation
in the region of Can Duoc. They had to be carried back
to their base. In April of that year a fully-armed
mutiny occurred at the base of Dau-Tieng (province of
Thu Dau Mot) among men of the 3rd Brigade of the 4th
Infantry Division. Several men refused an order to
proceed on a "search and destroy" mission in the vicinity
where another unit had just been wiped out. The enraged
comanding officer ordered another group to open fire on
the rebels, who then returned the fire. Two reports speak
of "about fifty" soldiers killed in the resulting fight.
This was in 1967..

In mid-1969 an entire company of the 196th Infantry
Brigade publicly sat down on the battlefield. Later that
year another rifle company, from the 1st Cavalry Division,
flatly refused--on CBS TV--to advance down a dangerous trail.

Today in Vietnam, refusal to fight is ammuch more com-
mon and casual thing:

"On patrol", explained one Viet vet, "we were supposed

to go a mile and engage Charlie, right? What we did was
go a hundred yards, find us some heavy foliage, smoke,

rap, and sack out."

In the past two years hundreds of thousands of Amer-
ican soldiers have used this tactic. The Brass feel that
court-martialing men for leaving their fire bases will
undermine whatever remains of morale. On the other hand
the Brass are beginning to be scared by the new forms of
resistance in the Army.

Fragging

"Fragging" is the word the GIS have invented in Viet-
nam for the elimination of particularly vicious officers
and lifers. The Pentagon has said that there were 209
fraggings in 1970, a conservative guess. This is more than
double the number of fraggings that were officially re-
ported in 1969. But it looks like the year 1971 is going
to result in much heavier losses for the Brass. In one
division alone, fraggings are estimated to be running a-
bout one a week.

Fragging has become so widespread today that, accord-
ing to one Army account, 23 soldiers are currently in the

Long Binh stockade for killing their commanding officers,
and 17 others are currently on trial in the rest of Viet-
nam. Billy Smith is the first GI up on a fragging rap to
Stand trial within the U.S. He forced the Brass to
move his trial to the U.S. because he feared they could
easily murder him in the Vietnam stockades.

According to the Armed Forces Journal, it has become
a common practice to place bounties on the heads of off-
icers that the men particularly want to rub out. These
bounties range from $50 a head on up.

Dear Congressman,

I take pen in hand to complain about my piece. After
months of assiduous care and maintenance of the weapon

Fragging is nothing new. The first historically re-
corded acts of fragging occurred in the 16th century, when
the first capitalist armies were beginning to sweep up the
wealth of the world. There is a clear relation between
capitalist armies and fragging. Capitalist armies are the
military arm of economic imperialism, fighting wars and
battles that bring wealth and glory to the ruling classes.
Most of the rank and file within the capitalist armies
are made up of poor and working-class men, and colonial
subjects (usually men of color), either paid or forced to
fight. Strong discipline was and continues to be necess-
ary to hold the army together and achieve the results the
upper-class white officers order. But because it is a-
gainst the real class interest of most enlisted men to
fight in such capitalist armies, it is no surprise that,
when pushed hard enough some men begin to fight back.

And when the rank and file fight back it is usually against
their officers, the closest representatives of the ruling
circles and the men most directly oppressing them. Class
struggle within the army, as demonstrated‘by the act of
fragging, is only an intensified reflection of the class
nature and growing class struggle in American society

today .

TURN THE GU;

FREE

The U.S. Army in Vietnam, forced to fight by and for
a small group of wealthy businessmen, is on the verge of
collapse. The liberation forces in Vietnam, despite a
total lack of air or sea power, are winning. They are win-
ning because they are dedicated, disciplined freedom
fighters, fighting for their lives and their country, and

because they have the complete and total support of their
people.

Fraggings occur when GIS are pushed up against the
wall. Most GIS who kill their officers are acting in
self-defense, avoiding combat by any means necessary.
But whatever the consciousness behind it, fragging is
an act of class warfare which concretely aids the Indo-
chinese liberation forces. These liberation forces are

teaching GIS not only who the real enemy is, but how to
fight him.

Once GIS learn this they don't forget it. Many GIs are
bringing this concept of guerrilla warfare back to the U.S.
and applying it to the scene here. Elmer "Geronimo" Eratt,
former Deputy minister of Defense of the Southern Calif-
ornia branch of the Black Panther Party, was in the Marine
Corps Special Forces (and trained Green Berets) before he
became a revolutionary. when he was discharged, he used
the skills he learned from the U.S. military and the Viet-
namese liberation fighters to fight for his rights at home.
He joined the Black Panther Party, and with his "unself-
ish spirit, love for the people, and iron will" (BPP
paper, Aug. 27, 1970) led the military defense of the Los
Angeles Panther office on December 8,1969, when 14 Pan-
thers held 300 pigs with fully automatic weapons off for
5 hours, and suffered no casualties.

s * *

Neither Billy Smith nor any GI can be held responsible
for the fragging incidents that happen in Vietnam, or for
the massive resistance that GIS are showing to fighting
there. The Brass and Big Business create the conditions
that GIS are fighting against. ' '

Billy Smith will not be freed by a "fair trial or
legal trickery, but only by the Power of the People.
Billy’s trial was moved to the U.S. because the Brass
feared an armed uprising of GI's demanding Billy's free-
dom, had pis trial been held in Vietnam. Billy s life
depends on our willingness to take the offensive our-
selves. We must follow the lead of the GIS and turn this
imperialist war into a revolutionary war}
