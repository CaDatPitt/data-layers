 Superior Exposion Killing Three Miners
 Prompts lWa|kout Threat by Ariz. Locals

it-r”tAS&R Pension Gains Sought
  As Negotiations Open in L.A.

LOS ANGELES, Calif.-—-“It is crucial that we unite the workers in the entire
industry around a pension program of the magnitude already won by workers in
- auto and some other industries,” said Irving Dichter, Mine-Mill AS&R Council coordin-
— ator, following a three-day session early this month that opened this year’s negotia-

tions.

Stating that there is “too big a gap” between Mine-Mill demands and what the
company is now prepared to offer, AS&R spokesmen continually referred to what
they termed “cheaper settlements” in some sections of the industry, suggesting a com-
pany hope that division among the Workers could be used to hold down the size of
the pension package eventually delivered.

With the AS&R pension program due to expire on June 30, the Mine-Mill'

‘ council is well aware that its achievements in this year’s negotiations are of vital

[importance to other workers in
the industry. Most major chains
will not get into pension negoti-
ations until 1967.

Predictably, the c o In p a n y
termed “too rich" the Mine-Mill
demands presented on June 1,
the opening day of the meeting
at the Chapman Park Hotel here.
The talk s were recessed on
June 3.

Union Demands

Among the union pension pro-
'posals are "an increase in the

; ‘basic benefit to $5.50 per month
periyear of service plus a cost-
of-living adjustment, supplemen-

I tal benefits for early retirees un-
til they are eligible for full So-

_ cial Security retirement, and in-

" creased disability pensions after
10 years of service with elimina-

, tion of Social Security offset.

1 Retroactivity for pension bene--

fits will be strongly opposed by
the company, the initial bargain-
ing sessions indicated.
-- 1 The Mine-Mill AS&R'Coun'cil,
” i_ ‘chaired by John Fonk of Local
72 in East Helena,’ Mont., also is
‘calling for -widows’ pensions,
— vesting after 10 years of service,
« ‘accumulation of credits on a
- company-wide basis, and union
participation in determining the
A ,‘ adequacy of pension funding.
. ‘ Health and welfare coverage for
pensioners also must be im-
proved in this year’s bargaining,
council members agree.
Dichter led into negotiations at
~ ' team of 13 Mine-Mill local union

 -leaders, representatives of some.

5,000 workers at AS&R proper-
tiesthroughout the country. _

Quick Action on Federal
Mine Safety Bill Asked

. SUPERIOR, Ariz.——The deaths of three veteran
miners in an explosion at the Magma Copper Company
underground property here on May 28, bringing to seven
the number of Arizona miners killed this year, are fur-
ther testimony to the need for federal safety legislation
for the non-ferrous metals industry, said the presidents
of nine Mine-Mill local unions in the state in a June 3
statement to the press. A statewide memorial work
stoppage is likely, they declared, should another fatality
occur prior to Congressional passage of a mine safety bill.

“If we are forced to adopt this practice,” their state-
ment said, “we would hope that all workers in the copper
industry, regardless of union affiliation, would unite in
this memorial to call ‘attention to the dangers which
threaten all of us.”

Joe Diaz, Frank Ruiz, and Marvin Thompson, who
had a combined total of’ 51 years of experience at the

Magma mine, were killed in a blast at its 3,600-foot level
just prior to the scheduled end

of their shifts on May 28. One
of the men’s watches, found
later, had stopped at 6:20 a.m.,

Mine-Mill Local 938, and Diaz
served as warden for the local
union.

Bisbee City Council Seat

BISBEE, Ariz.——Mike G. Morales, a board member of Mine-
Mill Local 551 for the past four years, newly elected to the six-
man Bisbee City Council, will take his seat July 1 for a term of
two years. He was unopposed in Ward 3 in the May 23 general elec-
tion.

A worker at the Campbell shaft, one of the operating shafts
in Phelps Dodge’s underground department here, Morales is a
member of the local union’s

negotiating committee and is AI'iZ-, he Came I0 Bisbee in
vice~president of the American
Coordinating Council of Politi-
cal Education. Born in Jerome,

1953.

Although the Copper Queen
Miners Union did not endorse
candidates’, the April 22 pri-
mary ele~ction—-the important
one in this community because
of the lopsided registration edge
held by the Democrats—indi-
cated the local’s strength in
Ward 3. Whereas two years ago,
J. J. “Junior” Stanford, also
an underground miner and a
member of Local 551, barely
nipped a non-union candidate by
an eight-vote margin, this year
Morales and Stanford gathered
all but a handful of votes in
the district. The Democratic pri-
‘ mary results there were
Morales, 58; Stanford, 28; and
Carl Wolff, 8.

Morales, who pitched for the

Texas League back in 1938, is
married and has four children,
all of whom are married. His
son David also is a PD worker
and a member of the local
union. .

Mine Safety Bill  

WASHINGTON, D. C.-—A Senate vote on federal
mine safety legislation for the non-ferrous metals indus-
try is expected in the near future, following favorable
action on the bill by the Committee on Labor and Public
Welfare on June 7. President Lyndon Johnson, meantime,
predicted for the first time passage of such legislation.

I11 his remarks calling for an intensified study of
occupational health, delivered to the International Labor
Press Association at the White House on May 23,~the
President said, “. . . we are going to extend federal health‘
standards to cover, not only coal miners, but all other

Bisbe-e Bees of the Arizona- .

 

miners as well.”

who labors under the earth to

Floor Fight Possible

Despite these hopeful signs,
however, a Senate floor fight on
the measure may take place. In
adopting the bill, along with
some amendments, the commit-
tee members agreed to delay
reporting the bill out for a pe-
riod of two weeks, in order to
allow time for certain minority
views to be prepared and at-
tached.

One of the amendments passed .

by the committee substitutes for
the state-option provision in the
bill, which labor had opposed,

language similar to that in the_
Federal Coal Mine Safety Act .

providing for federal-state, co-
operation in inspection and en-
forcement.

Committee members also ap- .
proved a judicial review amend- 
ment proposed by Sen‘. Jacob .

THE MINE-MILL UNION

‘Four Members of Local 18

Seek Public Office in Idaho

’ KELLOGG, Idaho —— Four members of the Coeur d’Alene District Miners’ and
Smeltermen’s Union, Mine-Mill Local 18, recently announced their candidacies, on the
Democratic party ticket, for public office. The filing deadline was May 7.

Seeking the position of state mine inspector is Carl Griner, who has been en-
dorsed both by Local 18 and by Local 5114 of the United Steelworkers of America. He

has no opposition in the ‘primary
election, set for August 2, and
undoubtedly will face 0. T. Han-
son in the general election in
November.

Ray Nieland, a longtime Mine-
Mill member, who has worked
in the mines practically all of
his life, is a candidate for state
representative f r o m Shoshone
County. A worker at the Page

. mine, he has been active both in

the union and in the Democratic
party.
Try for County Posts

Also from the AS&R Page
property are two candidates for
county commissioner for the
Second District—Elmer DuPuis
and June Lawley.

Griner, 37, of Cataldo, is mar-

dried and has two children. Hav-

ing worked in the mines and in
related industry for the past 17
years, he has‘ had experience
with practically every phase of

1 underground mining. He also is
, presently employed by AS&R at

the company’s -Page mine.
Pledging, if ‘elected, both to
enforce all of the state’s mine
safety code “without fear or fa-
vor” and to seek revision and
up-dating of that code, he says
that the state mine inspector

Umust “be dedicated principally

to the health and safety of the
men who hazard their lives in
the mines, mills and smelters.”

Griner believes that the code’s
ambiguous language, which can

be twisted to suit various pur-

poses, must be removed or clari-

fied. “Any law, code, or set of

rules that by vague language
leaves loopholes which may be
used to get around the original
intent of the law,” he says,

' ’ .—“makes for poor and difficult

enforcement.”
He will recommend, too, a

' . fund to be used for additional re-

search of silicosis andother dis-

 . cases related to the mining in-

dustry. _ .
‘ Legislative Goals
In announcing his candidacy
for the state legislature, Nieland
said. that he considers the pres-'

, ent workmen’s compensation law
-‘in Idaho to be “grossly inade-

quate,” and that he would work

, for its revision. , ,
He also believes the sales tax

 to beivery unfair. He‘ will submit

' other methods of taxation that
' would bring in sufficient revenue

To Spur Viel‘ Debate

NEW YORK, N.Y.—Stating that it is increasingly’ .
clear that “the simple solution to the Viet Nam War of- "f
fered again and again — ‘victory through escalation’ 
cannot succeed,” some 200 labor leaders met here on May _f"
3 to form an organization devoted to the encouragement
of greater participation by trade unionists in the debate 

on Viet Nam and other issues of war and pegce confront- 
ing the United States and.the rest of the World. 1 I

The new group is the Trade Union Division of the-“ﬁll:

National Committee for a Sane Nuclear Policy 
Attending the founding conference were delegates 

   

30 locals affiliated with 21 international unions. 
SANE is a broadly based national organization con-ix’

cerned with the possibility of
nuclear war and devoted to sup-
porting and suggesting policies
that will minimize that danger.
“Trade unionists have a spe-
cial responsibility to contribute
to this discussion (on Viet
Nam),” says a policy statement
adopted unanimously by those
at the May 3 meeting. “Our
aspirations to help build a great
society at home, in a peaceful
world, are placed in jeopardy
by the increasing tempo of
American involvement in the
war,” the statement declares.

Support Received

Telegrams in support of the
purposes of the new organiza-
tion were received at the con-
ference from U. S. Sens. Robert
F._ Kennedy (D-N.Y.), Harrison
Williams (D-N.J.), and George
"McGovern (D-S.D.), and U. S.
Rep. William Fitts Ryan (D-
N.Y.).

Noting that many of the Great
Society goals domestically “may

. languish for lack of funds and"

attention," the new Trade Union
Division of SANE said that an
end to the armed conflict in
Viet Nam could be brought
about only by negotiations
among all those involved in the
struggle. .

The group had high praise for
Sen. William Fulbright (D-Ark._)

and other members of the Sen~ -
_ ate Foreign Relations Commit-

tee for having subjected the

Activity After May 3 Primary

BAYARD, N. M.—Having played an extremely active role in the campaign
prior to the primary election, which was held in this state on May 3, Mine-Mill Local
890 now has turned its attention to preparations for the state Democratic platform con-
vention, scheduled for Albuquerque on July 16. The local will have 26% votes——one-
half of the Grant County total-——at the meeting;

The convention will draft and approve the party’s legislative goals for the com-

ing term.

The local union, which had some 100 cars prov

iding t-rwansportation to the polls

on the day of the primary, saw-10 of the 14 candidates itendorsed win the Demo-

cratic nomination for precinct,

county, "and state office. Since
Democrats hold an extremely
wide margin in the registration
figures in Grant County, win-
ners in the party primary who
are seeking county office .are
generally considered elected. ‘

Steve Ray Aguirre, a former
Kennecott employee who was a
member of Mine-Mill, defeated
George W. Clark by a 3,196 to
1,569 margin in the race for
county sheriff. Aguirre, the in-
cumbent, became the first Mex-
ican-American sheriff in the
county's history when he won
the office two years ago.‘

Ben Altamirano, who in 1964
clobbered three opponents in
the Democratic race for county
commissioner of the first dis-
trict, this year had no primary
opposition in his bid to retain
that office.

Chavez Wins

On a statewide level, Fabian
Chavez, Jr. was strongly backed
by Local 890 in his successful
race for the lieutenant governor
nomination. He carried Grant
County by over 700 votes in de-
feating Jack Jones‘:

Local 890 also had endorsed
Ernestine Evans, who was un-

opposed in seeking the nomina-

tion for secretary of state, and
Floyd Cross and Columbus
Ferguson, who were nominated
for posts on the Corporation
Commission.

John Burroughs, endorsed by
the loca1'u.nion and backed by
U. S. Sen. Joseph Montoya, was
defeated by Gene Lusk in the
race for the Democratic gube-r-
natorial nod. Gov. Jack Camp-
bell, also a Democrat, was pro-
hibited by law from seeking
another ‘term. Burroughs trailed
Lusk by a 2,159 to 2,222 count in
Grant County.

Max Sanchez, backed by the
local for the office of state audi-
tor, led Albert Romero by a
narrow margin in the county,
but was defeated in the state-
wide returns: ’

Two other candidates sup-
ported by the Amalgamated
Bayard District Union were de-
feated—Henry Moreno, a candi-
date for state representative,
and Albert Munoz, who ran for
county assesor. The local en-
dorsed, however, John Flem-

 

J-..
.

ing, who was unopposed for
probate judge, and Y. B.
Morales, John Birdwell, and
Carlos Felix, who were nom-
inated as justice of the peace
candidates from Bayard, Hur-
ley, and Santa Rita respec-
tively.
Rally and Dance

One of the highlights of the
campaign was a union-spon-
sored rally at the Penjamo Nite
Club on April 28, attended by
s-ome 400 persons. Morales, who
is an executive board member
of the local, served as master
of ceremonies at the affair,
which was addressed by many
of the candidates‘ or their
spokesmen.

Two days later, the local held
a dance for the various candi-
dates at the Casa Blanca Nite
Club. A capacity crowd at-
tended.

THE MINE-MILL UNION

ged Beneﬁt,

   

ere

"SALT LAKE CIT, Utah——Over 400 Kennecott Copper Corporation pensioners
turned out at a May 25 meeting at the Carpenters’ Hall here to petition the company
“to meet its full financial obligation to pensioners in accordance with agreements in

effect” between the company and 20 local unions throughout the state.

Sponsored by the score of locals of 10 different internationals, the meeting was
held to explain the unions’ proposals on the integration of the new medicare program

with the existing Blue Cross-Blue
Shield insurance plans provid-
ing health coverage to pension-
ers and their wives—proposals
which thus far have been re-
jected by the company.

, Pinsky Featured

Mine-Mill insurance consult-
ant Paul Pinsky was the main
speaker at the ‘meeting, while
Board Member Verne Curtis
and Steelworkers representa-
tive Wesley J. Madill each made
brief introductory remarks.

When the medicare program
goes into effect on July 1, it
will provide hospital and nurs-
ing home care to citizens over
age 65, whether or not they
continue to work. The voluntary
supplementary medicare pro-
gram, which co-sts an" individual
$3 per month, covers doctor’s
bills and other medical ex-
penses.

Since the company, which

now pays the Premium for pen-
sioners; health insurance (ex-
cept for $1 per month paid by
the individual), will realize a
substantial saving when medi-
care becomes

ings be used to provide an ex-
panded schedule of benefits.
Noting that‘ medicare was
passed to aid the aged individ-
ual, notto save money for cor-
porations, the unions’ proposals
include a call for Kennecott to
pick up the P§nsioner’s $3 per
month premium for Part B of
medicare. ,
The petitions signed by the
pensioners and their wives
called upon the comp-any to
reach agreement with the vari-
ous unions prio-r to the July 1
date. All bargaining units in the
Utah Copper Division of Kenne-
cott sponsored the May 25

effective, the.
.unions are asking thatthe sav-

jointly with the company in the
near future to resolve the medi-
care integration problem,

(Continued from Page 1)

conducted an investigation of
the explosion, which Mine-Mill
officials believe may well have
been a premature blast. The
official reports on the accident
were not available as this issue
went to press.

At the present time, the U. S.
Bureau of Mines must gain
permission from the company
in order to investigate such an
accident—a situation that would
be corrected by passage of fed-
eral safety legislation.

Restrictions Requested
' Magma Copper allowed fed-
eral‘ investigators to go in, ac-
cording to A. C. Moschetti of

Denver, but requested that the.

report be restricted to use by

.the company and the Bureau

and not made public. Moschetti
is acting district manager for
District E, Health and Safety
Activities, U. S. Bureau of
Mines. The district covers 16
Western states, including Ari-
zona.

Local 938 President Pascual
Herrera -and Serafin Herrera,
chairman of the union’s safety
committee, immediately follow-
ing the explosion asked to take
part in the investigation, but
were turned down by the com-
pany. ,

The two met on June 3, along
with International Representa-
tives Charles Wilson and Roy
Santa Cruz, Jr. and Ricardo
Campos, a safety committee-
man from the underground di-
vision, with company officials.

At that time, which followed.

public charges by the union
that Magma wanted the Bu-
reau’s report restricted, John
S. Wise, general manager for
the Superior operations, agreed
that the union might receive a
copy.

An inquest on the fatalities
will be held on June 21, ’

Officials from ‘the Apache
Powder Company in Benson,
Ariz.,
Dodge, reportedly joined in the
investigation of the blast.

Ruiz and Thompson ap-
parently were killed ' instantly,
but Diaz was still alive when
other miners reached the scene.

Fannin Blasted

Pointing again to the failure,
of state mine inspection and
voluntary company action in the '
prevention of accidents, the
group said, “. . . as long as we
are deprived of realistic fed-
eral mine inspection in the cop-':
per industry, the miners in this
state may well follow the prece- ‘

dent so well established by coal

miners elsewhere. When a mine
death occurs, all the miners in
the area cease work in a Min-
ers’ Memorial until after the
funeral of the- victim.” The
statement specifically attacked
U. S. Sen. Paul Fannin ,(R-
Ariz.) for “assisting the opposi-
iton” to federal safety legisla-
tion in this area.

International officers A. C.

Skinner, Asbury Howard, and
Irving Dichter send their deep- ,
est condolences to the famiiles
of the three men. ‘

They also sent telegrams to .
several members of the Senate
Labor and Public Welfare Com-'
mittee urging prompt action on
the mine sa'fety'bill. Magma
Copper, they pointed out, re-
fused to allow the U. S. Bureau
of Mines to investigate a fatal
accident at its San Manual mine
ayear ago, on May 20, 1965.?

“The attitude of this -and
other .companies in refusing
federal investigation of fatal;
mine accidents and/or prevent-
ing public disclosure of the re-
sults of investigations can only"
be‘ corrected by enactment of -
H.R. 8989,”
said. V

Arizona’s A two Senators_ and .
some of. the committee mem-
bers also received wires from
the entire Local 938 executive
board and from other Mine-Mill j
locals in the state. C

effort to help ensure passage of-some of thetmost meaningful labor 
bills everto rece'ive‘consideration by the state’s law-making body. ’

Immediately facing the legislature we-re two hills which would

Peak, Hi-Color, MacGills, and Verbena. ,

The basic demands of the strikers, members of the solidly unified independent
National Farm Workers Association and the Agricultural Workers Organizing Com-
mittee of the AFL-CIO, are wages of $1.40 per hour plus 25 cents per box, improve-

ments in working conditions,
and, of course, union recogni-
tion.

The strike, biggest in the

-abundant San Joaquin Valley

since the 1930’s, has been going
on since September and has
been marked by threats, in-
timidation, and beatings of the
strikers. It is seen as key to
the eventual organization of
not only the half million farm

workers in California, but those.

of other states as well.

Notional Importance

The grape strike has national
significance, partly’ because the

nationwide boy.cott may be cru-

cial to its success, but more
importantly because it IS serv-
ing as a demonstration of the

possibility of organization by

farm workers that is sure to be
duplicated -elsewhere. Workers
on the farms of Arizona, says

~Mine-Mill District 2 Board

Member Maclovio R. Barraza

of ’_I_‘ucson,_are talking of simi-
; lar work stoppages there. They

have been advised to wait by
Cesar Chavez, head of the
NFWA, who believes that the

California struggle must be won

first.

Support the grape strikers,
urges Chavez, so that expansion
of the movement elsewhere can
be built with a solid victory to

‘ which to point.

Help from the "outside has

i been vital, since the NFWA has

no treasury with which to pro-
vide strike benefits. And help
has come-—from many labor
unions. and other organizations
throughout the country.
Mine-Mill locals have made
financial contributions, as has
The
union’s executive board, which
received a letter from Chavez

. expressing his thanks for past

help and asking assistance with
the DiGiorgio boycott, voted an
additional contribution at its

meeting last month.

One of the highlights of the
recent Auto Workers’ conven-

_tion in Long Beach’, Calif., was

the’ appearance of some 50
grape strikers, who marched

into the hall carrying the ban- '
ners they bore on their .300-mile
- march from Delano to the state

capitol in Sacramento. Chavez
and Larry Itliong of the AWOC
addressed the delegates,- who
adopted a resolution of support
by rising to sing “Solidarity
Forever.” '

C -- The hall rung with shouts of

“Viva la huelga,”
President Walter

as UAW
Reuther

,vowed,"‘As long as we have a
_dollar in our strike fund, they

are going to have our support.”

.“You have given us hope,” said

  

T Premium, Dougherty, Golden

Itliong, “you have given us in-
spiration.”

Virtual Monopoly

California raises 92 percent
ofthe grapes in the U.S., with
the Delano area producing both

table grapes and wine grapes.

With a virtual monopoly on the
crop, the large growers obvi-
ously have no valid argument
in saying they can’t pay more
in wages because of competi-
tion. . -

Robert DiGiorgio, president

of the corporation and also a’ ‘
director of the Bank of Amer-'

ica, last year received $135,000."
It was he who recently ad-

mitted publicly that the Delano‘

“housing camps” were in poor
condition, ‘ explaining that the
corporation plans to sell ‘them.
People now, of course, have to
livein them. " -

-The lengthy strike is ‘a bitter -

one and has involved violence.

The company’s‘sec_1u'ity guards-= -

have threatened .» strikers and
have physically beaten them.
A woman NFWA picket was
pushed -to the ground by the

superintendent of DiGiorgio’s
Delano operation.

The unions, however, are de-
termined to succeed, both for
the Delano workers and as an
example for other farm work-
ers throughout the nation. Con-
tributions should be sent to

Farm Workers -Relief Fund,

Box 130, Dela-mo, California’. The
DiGiorgio boycott, too, is ex-
tremely important.

Reniodeled Hall  

Ups Attendance

For Tenn. local

WRIGLEY, . Tenn. ——lncreased
attendance at the membership
meetings of Mine-Mill Local 314,
the Goodwill Furnace Workers
Union, has been one result of
last year’s extensive remodeling
of the union hall.

The hall was bricked on the
outside and new paneling was
installed on the inside. Addi-
tionally, attic fans were put in,
both to cool the building during
the summer and to draw out
smoke. Adding further to the

hall's increased comfort are «
new insulation and gas heat for _

use during cold weather.

The value of the property,
originally purchased in 1955, of
course, has been greatly in-
creased by the extensive work.

A $5 jackpot drawing at each
weekly meeting also has served
to keep attendance up. If the
member whose name is "drawn
is not present, the $5 is added

to the next week’s prize money. .

S Political Action

Although primary elections in
Tennessee will not be held until
August 4, the Local 314 political
action committee already has
moved into action, and‘ has been
keeping the membership in-
formed of developments » with
periodic reports. The final fil-

«ing date for candidates’ was

June ’6.

Grieved by the recent deaths
of two members, Local 314 has

expressed its sympathy to the
families of Sammie Bell, Jr.
of the retort department, who
hadserved on both the political
action and the grievance com-
mittees, and Walter Rice of the
maintenance department.

Originally organized in 1938,
Local 314 now has some 180
members. . The union holds bar-
gaining rights at the Tennessee

THE MINE-MILL UNION

California’s High Court Rules

  Proposition 14 Unconstitutional

The California Supreme Court on May 10 held unconstitutional Proposition 14,
passed by the state’s voters by a wide margin in 1964, which allowed discrimination
by owners in the sale or rental of housing. Coming at a time when Congressional
hearings are being held on the Johnson administration’s new package of civil rights
legislation, which includes a section to ban such housing bias, the 5 to 2 decision un-
doubtedly will be felt nationally.

Justice Paul Peek wrote the majority decision, which said that Proposition 14
violated the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment by making the state “at
least a partner” in the act of discrimination. The California Real Estate Association has

4 The life of a Union Giiical

Most union members are aware that the commercial. press
takes liberties with the truth in describing the life of a union
official. But the picture in the minds of many-rank-and-filers, writes
Art Clausen, financial secretary of Mine-Mill Local 16 in Great
Falls, Mont., may not always be exactly correct either.

In sending in the following description of the woes of a busi-
ness agent, he suggests that it might well be applied to almost any
union officer. The article appeared in one of last year’s editions
of International Bookbinder, a publication of the International

‘indicated that it will seek a re-
hearing and a review by the
U.S. Supreme Court.

Proposition 14, which nullified
the state’s fair housing acts,
was an amendment to the state
constitution which allowed an
owner “absolute discretion” in
choosing to whom he would sell
or rent. The real estate associ-
ation was a chief sponsor of the
amendment, which passed by a
majority of two to one. Passage
of the proposal two years ago
caused the federal government
to cut off financing of urban re-
newal projects in California.

The housing section of the ad-
ministration’s new civil rights
bill is admitted to be the “sticki-
est” part of the package, even
by proponents such as Rep.
Emanuel Cellar (D-N.Y.), who
is carrying the bill in the House
Judiciary Committee and has
predicted its passage. Cellar
was sharply critical of Senate
Minority Leader Everett Dirk-
sen (R-111.), who has indicated
that he believes the housing bias
ban section to be unconstitution-
al. Dirksen made that assess-
ment prior to the California
court’s decision.

Weaver Testifies

At House committee hearings
on the bill, Robert C. Weaver,
secretary of the Department of
Housing and Urban Affairs and
the highest ranking Negro in
federal government, stressed
the importance of the housing
portion of the bill, saying, “In-
ferior housing and inferior edu-
cation go hand in hand, and to-
gether they foster and reinforce
inferior employment opportuni-
ties and inferior incomes.”

In addition to imposing ‘a na-
tional ban on discrimination in
the sale and rental of housing,
the bill also would reform fed-
eral and staff jury selection pro-
cedures, strengthen laws against
civil rights violence, and set up
new legal weapons against
school segregation.

The U.S. Civil Rights Com-
mission, which supports the bill,
also told the committee mem-
bers at the hearings that it does
not go far enough. The com-
mission called for additional leg-
islation that would revoke fed-
eral charters and insurance of
banks and savings and loan in-
stitutions that discriminate
against Negro home buyers or
fail to require builders to pledge
non-discrimination.

Additional Proposals
The commision, too, called for

legislation that would:

0 Designate as a federal
crime any conduct “designed to
preclude a fair trial,” including
lynchings of persons awaiting
trial.

0 Require a presumption, re-
buttable in court, that jury dis-

crimination exists in a r e a s

where there has been a recent
court finding to that effect, or
where any class of persons has
disproportionately low represen-
tation on juries.

0 Permit persons exercising
their constitutional rights to sue
individuals, public officials, and

_localities and states for dam-
ages suffered as a result of pri-

vate or official actions.

More Dangerous Toys

' ‘- _-The June issue of CONSUMER REPORTS warns parents that
‘a -toy resembling a bazooka gun might do permanent damage to
the ear. The Mattel Agent Zero M Sonic Blaster, 5530, fires com-
‘pressed air with a blast measured by the engineers at Consumers
Union at 145 dB. where a child’s righ-t ear would rest when he
 V=fired it and 157 dB. one foot in front of the muzzle.

 It is generally conceded that a short burst of sound of around
150..dB.-can do permanent damage to the hearing of an adult. But
Wtheforce of the air blast from the muzzle could also have a serious
_~_-effect" on the ear drum of anyone directly in front of the toy whose
.37 ear was within several feet of themuzzle. CU urges parents to
 -destroy such toys, if owned, and ‘£9 warn their own children against

Super 8 Movie Cameras

V. The entire field of, .,8mm motion pictures has been profoundly
affected "by a new film format, which exi_sts in two competing
"versions. Consumers Union’ publishes its_ ﬁndings, including the

the quality of the image. There is a catch though. The new film

the Federal Trade Commission has postponed its new ‘trade regu- V

lation rule until January 1, 1967.

The June ‘issue of CONSUMER REPORTS points out thateven
the new terminology will not give precisely accurate measure-

ments; the FTC will permit manufacturers to round oﬁ to the_

nearest inch. The present 21-inch monochrome tube will be called
20-inch, though the actual diagonal of its picture is only 195/3 inches.
On the other hand, the present 23-inch monochrome tube has an
actual diagonal of 22 5/16 inches, and sets using it will be desig-
nated as having only a 22-inch. picture. ,

The new rule will leave the industry free to use width, width-
b_y-heig_ht,_ or square inches of picture area, as well as the diagonal
dimension. Trade sources are predicting that most manufacturers
will stick to the diagonal (originally the diameter of a round tube)
-—a larger number sounds more impressive.

Reel or Rotary Mower—-
Which Do You Need?

_ Rotary mowers cut grass by the scythe-like action of blades

— spinning parallel-to the lawn at high speed. Reel mowers shear

grass between a stationary horizontal bedknife and a group of
curved blades that turn about like a paddlewheel.

,, Which is better for you? As a class, the rotaries usually are
the easier of the two types to maneuver. They cut closer to
obstructions and can handle ‘high, tough growth in which a reel
would stall. In addition, only the rotaries can mulch leaves. In

131011. and. it is correspondingly brighter and sharper; or it can be ~

- tests conducted by Consumers Union, the cutting height was found‘

. easier to adjust on the rotaries than on the reels (although three
reels included in the ratings in the June issue of CONSUMER
REPORTS were judged-almost as easy), and rotary blades, CU
feels, can be sharpened relatively easily by a do-it-yourselfer. And
finally, hand-pushed rotaries generally offer powered mowing at
least cost. . 6

Reel mowers offer the advantage that they are less likely to
scalp an uneven lawn and are safer than rotaries. Adjusting the
bedknife is a reasonable task for the homeowner (but blade sharp-
ening is probably best left to a lawnmower shop).

, In self-propelled mowers, the reel type tested ranged from
about $110 to $155, while the rotaries ran from $138 to $176.

From a safety standpoint, the rotaries are somewhat more

,, da_ngerous—-theyV can hurlV stones, nails and other debris with force

-- enough to kill;' it is easier to pull a rotary back over the foot
inadvertently, or to slip the foot under the mower housing.

Accidents are possible with a powered reel mower too, but the
basic design makes them less likely to injure anyone.

Of 16 gas-powered, self-prope-lled models of the reel type and
nine self-propelled rotaries, 21 CU judged Acceptable. ‘In prior
year tests of push--type rotary mowers, more than half the’ models

were rated Not Acceptable. Of the nine self-propelled rotaries I

tested this year only two were rated Not Acceptable’; only -one of
the 16 reel mowers ‘was _ rated Not Acceptabie because it. was

negotiations in Viet Nam late

last month were forw_arded to ‘

U. S. Sen. Robert F. Kennedy
(D-N. Y.). The political action

593, chaired by Edward J. Mi-

chalski, circulated the petitions
following Kennedy’s February
proposal, that the Viet Cong be
allowed to take part in negotia-
tions as “an independent en-
tity.” _

The Johnson administration
has maintained that the Cong
must be represented in any
such negotiations by the North
Vietnamese
Hanoi.

An accompanying letter to
Kennedy indicates that the re--
cent political unrest in South
Viet Nam has served to boost

the number of Americans who

support his position on negotia-
tions.

“A ceasefire in Vet Nam and
a conference of all interested

Lou R. Krandall, head of the contracting firm which built the

project- He said, “I have never been on a project where the work-

and took the big interest that they did here. . . . Everybody
seemed to take a pride in it.”

Krandall paid special tribute to the plasterers who did the

He noted that this work is “the trade of a generation ago" and

_ that the average age of the men who did it was over 65.

Charge Against Planters Being Processed

It was reported in this column sometime ago that the Inter-

Company of Clarksdale, Miss. The Equal Employment Opportunity

‘Commission at first refused to handle the complaint on the ground

that only individuals could file charges under the 1964 Civil Rights
Act. -
-The Commission since has reversed itself and ruled that a

union which bargains for a group of aggrieved workers may file a

complaint before the EEOC. The Commission has now ordered its

Wyoming. Delegates came from a seven-state area——Wyoming,
Colorado, Montana, Utah, Idaho, and North -and South Dakota.

her as the Republican candidate defeated in the 1964 election by

Right-Wing Offer Reiected

Pepperdine College is a small private school in Los Angeles
with fewer than 1,300 students and a faculty of 100. It’s in the
news because it turned down an offer of $1 million to turn itself in-
to a diploma mill. _ .

The will of D. B. Lewis, a multimillionaire dog food manufac-
turer, offered Pepperdine the $1 million if it would give an hono-

. rary degree to Dan Smoot, right-wing commentator. College offi-

cials turned it down on the ground that its degrees were not for
sale.
The secretary of a Chemical Workers local in Fresno and a

group of union leaders were impressed by Pepperdine’s refusal,

saying, “Any college or university which has the guts to turn down
$1 million for a principle deserves support." They have organized

‘themselves to raise the $1 million for the college.

   The: Lab©r Scam   Court Upholds Reinstatement

0 cl f I K'n w k  
HUMBOLDT, Ariz.—On May 9, the U. S. District Court of Appeals rejected the appeal of the 
Shattuck Denn Mining Company againsta National Labor Relations Board decision ordering it to ‘ 

give jobs to two members of Mine-Mill Local 942 who were fired in May, 1964 from the company's 

Iron King property, along with back pay since that time. _ _
The two men, Nick Olvera from the mine and Bob Hernandez from the mill, are not the only  

ones to gain from the board order and last month's court action. .  S 
Twenty other employees that the company claimed to have replaced during a walkout in. May

are d Share Alie?

of 1964 over the firing of Olvera
were rehired as new employees
at varying times between May
and October of that year. All of
them now have been granted
their original seniority. They
also are now entitled to pay for
wages lost and must have made
up to them any differences in
pay due to their job classifica-
tions, any miners’ bonuses lost,
and all vacations, paid holidays,
or medical costs affected by the
company’s actions.

Workers Affected

These workers are Albert
Castaneda, William Kent, Lupe
Jaime, Tom Phillips, Eural
Bake, Manuel Duran, E; G.
Gonzales, Charles Reyes, Rich-
ard Olvera, Juan Pozos, Lupe
Robles, Don Knight, John
Mendibles, Lupe Regalado, Tony
Medina, Antonio Olvera, Arthur
Mendibles, Ernest Leyva, Rob-
ert J. Sandoval, and Phillip
Crawford.

The same terms of settlement
will be applied, by agreement
with Shattuck Denn, to the case
of Colvin Johnson, who also
was rehired without seniority.

The court decree also re-
quires the company to post

. notices at the property disclaim-

ing any future discrimination
against or discouragement of
membership in Mine-Mill.

A meeting involving Roy H.
Garner of the NLRB, company
officials, and Local 942 Presi-
dent Don Covey and Vice-Presi-
dent Pete Soriano, assisted by

. International Representative

Sylvain Schnaittacher, was held
at the mine on May 25 to start
the process of computing
amounts due, which will carry
interest of six percent.

Since the time that the fir-
ings took place, in addition to
securing the conditional rehiring
of the 20 workers pending the
labor board ca.se, the union
negotiated an agreement at
Iron King, signed in September
of 1964 and running. until July
31, 1967. The contract, the
union’s first at the property
after the workers there voted to
leave the Steelworkers for Mine-
Mill, carried gains approximat-
ing 30 cents per hour.

It will be some time before
all the work of calculating the
back pay and other aspects -of
the court-upheld NLRB order
can be completed. Meanwhile,

Brass Mill Product lmports Up

’ Brass mill product shipments to the- U.S. from European and
Japanese mills have taken a big jump in the first three months
‘A of 1966. March imports of more than 20 million pounds were the
highest monthly total since January, 1960. Based on imports for
the first three months, 1968 imports are likely to exceed consider-
ably the record imports of 189,000,000 pounds in 1959. Trade sources
now beomin-g available indicate sizable increases are in prospect
 _, for the April, May and June quarter.
;.-=‘ — Foreign mills charge prices to reflect the higher prices of cap-
’  per abroad, but are reported to be “selling like hotcakes” at 10 to
.. 30 cents per pound higher than U. S. mill prices. This is a sure in-
dication that U.S. mills, whose unfilled order backlogs increase
every month, aren’t able to get enough copper to meet the demands

Lead Price Cut One Cent

, , , U. S. producers last month cut the price of lead from 16 cents
 ' to 15 cents per pound. The move was prompted by the falling price
93-  of "lead: on the London Metal Exchange, which stood at less than
121/zcents per pound when the U.S. cut was made effective. Since
‘- ‘then’ there has been a further decline in London to about 11% cents.
_  _, The downward movement in lead prices reflects a turnabout in
‘~~$..,the extremely short supplies of lead which have developed in the
, '. U.S. and abroad over the last two years. Supplies and utilization
 Y jof~lead* are now more evenly balanced. - ' .
 , -Trade journals report U.S. demand for lead is strong, and that
 stocks have not begun to build up asithey did nine years ago when
fir‘:  fthe U.S. stockpile purchase program was terminated.

New Smokestack at Hurley Smelter

The Kennecott Copper Corporation last month began construc-
tion of a new smokestack at its Hurley, New Mexico copper smelt-
er. The new stack, costing about $2,500,000, will be built of rein-
forced concrete and lined with fire brick. Construction will take
about two years. The new stack will supplement the existing 25-
year-old 500-foot stack at Hurley.

Recent Developments in Chile

Thirty-five hundred workers at Anaconda’s El Salvador copper
mine and Potrerillos smelter in Chile are demanding a 70 percent
wage boost plus other benefits when their current contract rims out
July 31. The company is expected to come up with a considerably
lower counter-offer. '

* ‘k, at

Chile’s Geological Research Institute last month began investi-
gation of reports by private prospectors of huge new copper de-
posits high in the Andes mountains. The deposits were claimed to
be larger than at Anaconda’s Chuquicamata mine. The area of the
newly reported deposits is said to be in a virtually inaccessible re-
gion, where development would involve considerable outlay for
access and transportation.

- Three leading Japanese copper smelters have recently reached
agreement to supply about 25 percent of the cost of developing the
Rio Blanco mine in Chile—hitherto to a joint venture of the Chilean
government and Cerro Corporation of New York. Deposits at the
Rio Blanco mine are estimated at 110 million tons.

The recent agreement stipulates that the three participating
Japanese smelters together will be supplied with 4,000 tons of con-
centrates per month over a period of more than ten years, begin-
ning in 1970.

U. S. Copper Tariff Suspension

The House of Representatives last month passed a bill to sus-
pend the present tariff of 1.7 cents per pound on copper, effective
retroactively to last February 8 and to remain suspended until June
30, 1968. This was one of the points in President Johnson’s program
to ease copper supplies last November when he persuaded major
copper companies to roll their prices back to 36 cents per pound.
The Senate is expected to approve the measure during its present
session. This will be the third time the duties have been suspended
since World War II.

World Confab  

0n Copper Set

For late 1966

An international conference on
the world copper situation will
be held late this year under the
auspices of the United Nations.
The conference is the result of
agreements entered into by the
United States government and
the governments of other cop-
per-producing nations to study
the world copper situation and
attempt to bring some stability
to international copper, now
marked by shortages and er-
ratic pricing.

Last month, Senator Mike
Mansfield (D-Mont.), urged an
international conference of cop-
per producers, but was advised
that such a meeting of copper
companies might involve viola-
tion of antitrust laws by U.S.
companies. The UN meeting
will be one between govern-
ments, not companies.

In a letter to Mansfield an-
nouncing U.S. participation in
the conference, President John-
son stated that he had ordered
a study of the copper industry
to be made under the direction
of the Council of Economic Ad-
visers. It is reported that the
results of the study will be sub-
mitted to the President and
later_ made available to State
Department officials who «will,
presumably, be U.S. representa-
tives at the UN conference.

Chile and copper-producing
countries of Africa are expected
to take part in the conference,
but no official word has yet
been released by these or other
copper countries.

What amounts to a short course on industrial health and safety is presented by Dr. Murray C.
Brown, Chief of the Division of Occupational Health of the U.S. Public Health Service, in the May issue
of The American Federationist, the monthly magazine of the AFL-CIO.

In a very informative and tightly condensed four-page article, Dr. Brown. surveys the state of
industrial health and safety in the United States—its extent, its dollars and cents cost to the Ameri-
can economy, _and its often shattering effect on the individual worker.

He ends by saying that, “It is only by maintaining the physical well being of the man on the job
that the nation can continue to hold its position of industrial and economic leadership.

“And labor unions, in their
historically unique role of keep-
ing up-to-date on the needs of
the workers they represent, can
contribute substantially to this
enormous task,” he states.

Dr. Brown discusses the prob-
lem of the sudden onset of sensi-
tivity to the material a worker

, has been handling for a long

time. He notes the long term ef-
fect of an occupational hazard-
silicosis is an example of this.
He outlines the types of haz-
ards: exposure to c h e mic a 1
agents (dusts, fumes, mists, va-

pors and gases); exposure to en-
vironmental conditions (_\'adia- »

tion, noise, extremes of temper-
ature and humidity). He also
deals with new problems arising
from new technologies, tools and
materials developed in recent
years, and notes that a whole
new area of investigation lies in
discovering the genetic effects
of industrial disease.

Dr. Brown admits that many
studies of occupational health
hazards have been made’, but
points out that national esti-
mates of the problem are only
sketchily available. He points
out, “And such data, when col-
lected, embraces production fig-
ures and dollars and cents, not
the personal factors behind the
tables and charts.”

0Ks 2 changes Cites Barcon for  

In Constitution

TORONTO, Ont. —— Mine-Mill
members throughout Canada, in
referendum balloting on April 6,
approved two constitutional
changes designed to provide
the necessary financial re-
sources for an ambitious pro-
gram of bargaining and or-
ganization and to meet ex-

penses in case of emergency.

Both changes had been recom-
mended unanimously by dele-
gates to the union’s 14th Cana-
dian Convention earlier in the
year.

Secretary - Treasurer William
Longridge released the certified
report of the election count
early in May.

Carried by a better than two-
to-one margin was the pro-
posal to increase the monthly
per capita payment to the na-
tional union from $2 to $2.50.
The second constitutional

change, approved by a majority-

slightly less than two-to-one,
gives the Canadian executive
board authority to levy, in case
of emergency, one assessment
per year not to exceed $5.
Previously, no assessment could
exceed $1.

1966 Bargaining

Undoubtedly contributing to
the overwhelming passage of
the referendum propositions
was the important round of
bargaining coming up this year
—with the huge Consolidated
Mining and Smelting Company
and other corporations.

Two years ago, a three-day
strike produced a two-year 40

cents-an-hour c 0 nt ra c t. for —

Cominco workers, who . this
year, in view of the rosy profits
picture, are including among
their demands one . for an
across-the-board 50 cents an

hour wage hike. The Concilia-_

tion Service moved into the
Cominco negotiations late in
April, following the out-of-hand
rejection by the company of the

— union’s proposals.‘ "
