‘'3;

So it was in France, before Louis XVI lost his head in the

wild fury of the Reign of Terror. His spendthrift government
‘lost _its credit, and collapsed. - . r -

I i ' In his time, those who held possession of ‘what wealth there

was steadfastly refused to part with any of it, or to share
the costs of the State, which they controlled; imposing heavier

- ‘K "and ‘yet heavier burdens upon the people who groaned in re-
 doubled misery+—until the storm burst.

And even now, while the income cf the c-:?..;mon family

has shrunk to less than half, and still i:; .,-hrinl;ing-—even now

while the swollen fortunes of those favored few increase and
magnify by incredible leaps—even now they’~wh_o control the
State demand that the whole cost of the war, the whole: burden

ofithe squandering and waste, shall be .‘.aid 9:; the common

people; that the ordinary working family, even now unable

' to ‘scrape along in barest decency, shall pay out of threadbare ‘
A pockets the whole indebtedness of war. ' - ‘

THAT WAY LIE-S DESTRUCTION. A nation of paupers

‘ confronting a caste of multimillionaires—ghastly starvation

confronting’ ghastlier excesses——that way lies the Terror.

Not that way—NOT THAT WAY! . ‘ _ ,
_ There must be-—there is-a sane, an intelligent, an Amer-
ican way. -

What is the American way’? -

The sane way, the American way, is to take the wealth

: made out of the war and use it to pay for the war. Whycan-
._ not we do that? '

Because war proﬁteers own the Government. They own

I . iall thenecessities of the people ’s life. They own the railroads
/ —and have just demanded an” extra tax of one billion dollars V
_ * a_ year in rate increases. They own the .coallmines,' and have
‘ just announced further raises in the price of coal. They own
 the steel mills, and the price of steel is going up again; '

harmony with this age. We seek to overthrow, not our gov-

ernment, but a criminal conspiracy for the establishment of. an - "

empire on the ruins of our Republic. . 
Our nation does not stand alone, but is a part of that closely
interwoven structure known as civilization. _
States is formed, ﬁrst of thirteen and now of forty-eight dif-
ferent sovereignties, so must the nations of the world llnite in
one international structure, as they are already united in the

inescapable bonds of an international community of thought, '

of action, and of «exchange.

This international structure must be based upon either one
or the other of two violently opposed principles. Either we

must be united under the dominant sway of a band of interna—“

tional plunderers, leagued together to crush out the freedom
of all people in every land; or we must be bound together in‘

a free fellowship of all the peoples, linked in a world-wide -‘

creative fellowship.

The Money Power of the World has. sought to establish an‘. '

international autocracy of crime through the League of‘ Na—'
tions and the Treaty of Versailles. The workers of the world

must instead of this establish their own Federation of ,Work- 

ers’ Republics. _ _
_ We affirm our solidarity with the revolutionary working
classes of all other nations. It is our charge to establish here
in the United States of America that great transformation
which shall uproot the cause -of the world’s miseries and its,
Wars that will bring’ prosperity and peace. And _we stretch?

. out our handsto those in every other nation who are ﬁred by

the same spirit and seek the same ends, without compromise,
without hesitation, without fear and without distrust.

Are these principles un-American? Truly, no ;: they are the , 

essence of Americanism !
WHAT‘ IS AMERIGANISM?

The ﬁrst principle of Americanism‘ is, quite plainly and
simply, that whenever any form \of government b'ecomes’- de-

structive of life, liberty and happiness, it is not only the -right. I . I

land feared it, and sent his soldiers for eight long years across ,
' three thousand miles of ocean to strangle that idea on the '

American soil which had given it birth. But it lived then;

it lived through the bloody horror of the Civil War; and it

shall not die now!  A
_To this doctrine the founders of the American Republic

pledged themselves; and to it we ‘pledge, as did these pioneers - Vi

before us, ‘ ‘ our lives, our liberties, and our most sacred honor.”
There are, then, two things to be considered. First, does

our present form of government safeguard life, liberty and"

happinessfor the people who live under it; and secondly, if

it does not, what form of government shall we substitute for it? I

The answer to both questions is easy.
WHAT IS WRONG?

One need go no further than Washington to ﬁnd the ﬁercest
critics of our present system. Honest men laboring under the
burden of public business comprehend perfectly that the pres-

‘ ent system is unworkable. They know, and have stated very ' I
‘clearly, what is wrong with it. '

For two years a special commission appointed by the Presi-.
dent at the request of Congress studied the breakdown of, our
industrial life. In their report, known as the Report of the
United States Industrial Relations Commission, they, have
shown the causes of that disaster. Every statement is backed
up with carefully tested evidence.

Its opening paragraph outlines our program. It says:

.“The' only ‘hope for the solution of the tremendous prob-
lems created by industrial relationships lies in the eﬁ'ective use

of our democratic institutions, and in the rapid extension of A

the principles of democracy to industry.”

“Eﬁective use of our democratic institutions” cannot be
made, so long as these institutions are under control of the two
old parties.

' use them like a Hindenburg line, to protect the industrial

Kaiserism which has brought us to bankruptcy. There must

,S_ocialist ;l?arty., 2

 How then shall we answer the question of the Declaration

 vast machinery necessary to utilize tlfése natural resources,»

such as the Steel Corporation’s plants, the telephone and V

But the principle is the same. Whoever owns the source of

life, owns,and controlsthe life itself. Dukes in ancient times 

owned the land and "the roads, through titles of nobility. Dukes
today own railroads, steelmills, copper

That is for the owners to say. The Plumb Plan offered to’
pay the owners of ‘railroads stocks for the actual physical value
of their property with government bonds. They refused. In‘-
stead, they passed the "shameful Esch-Cummins bill. Thereby
they loaded upon the people the obligation to pay ﬁve and one-
_ half per cent dividends on stock swollen to three times the

'- actual value of the property. ' They refused a fair offer.

What about the Land? Will we take his farm away from‘
the Farmer? Of course not. Any man who occupies and
utilizes land forraising food on it is certain of the enthusiastic
protection of anysane government. ’

, But we are face to face with the landlord problem. Rents
in the cities have gone’ sky-high". Many families must live in
tents because there are not enough houses, while great stretches
of land, most valuable land, are held out of use by speculators. A

In the country likewise, the problem of the tenant-farmer
is pressing; the farmer who cannot pay the interest on his
mortgage, who sinks deeper and deeper into debt.

Free access to the land, and protection of those who use the.
land, this is the principal care of any sane government. There-

fore we establish this principle—tl1at all the land of the na-

tion belongs to all the people of the nation. No man can hold-
, his land unless all the people consent.‘ Therefore every man’s

_/title toland must be based upon use and occupancy. -

' No unearned increment—no speculation in tenements and

overcrowding—-no holding of valuable lands out of use for fu-

ture gain. None of these things must any longer be permitted.

problems to be solved.

5‘
Not this kind of Congress! How can a Congress of lawyers
run a mine? Can ex-saloon keepers conduct a boot‘ and shoe
industry? \

. To run a mine you must have miners. To run a railroad“
' you must have railroad men. To operate a woolen mill you,
-must have wool men.

Shall we take\control over the indus-
tries away from the men who know them best, and put it" in
the hands of a gang of politicians such as ﬁll our Congress and
our Legislatures today? That Would be to commit the very
crime we are protesting against. .

Political democracy, as we know it, is based upon land rep-

resentation. It consists in giving those who live on thesame . . — '

bit of land—ward, county, or state—a vote in the government
of that bit of land. That might have been all right when every-
body lived on a farm. In the days when our Constitution was
framed, almost everybody did live on a farm. Only a very
small percentage lived in the tiny towns that they called cities.
There were almost no manufacturers. There were no railroads;
railroads had not yet been invented. There were no steam-
ships. There were no telephones or telegraphs. There were
no industrial corporations. The unit of civilization was the

 farm. People naturally grouped themselves by the land they
' occupied. * '

_ But now we livein a different age. There have been more
revolutionary changes in our method-of life between the fram-

ing of the Constitution and the present time, than there had

been since the founding of Egypt. We have seen the inven-

tion of steam, of electricity, of gas, of railroads, of telegraphs.,
telephones, of wireless, of aeroplanes. ~

NOW IT Musr BE DONE

Instead of waiting until things are in a hopeless mess, and
then -appointing a committee of experts to try and ‘save the
wreckage, Congress Would be half composed of experts in all
‘industries. They would be on the job all the time, before
things went wrong, to prevent them fromgoing wrong. .

Thus one house would represent the Producers oft the na-
tion, and all its time Would be occupied in keeping production

 going smoothly. V

What Would We do with the other house?
A ‘THE TERRITORIAL HOUSE s s I ‘~
. ; Each man -has a double capacity-—as consumer and as pro-
ducer. So the lower house, elected as ‘at present on the geo-
graphical or territorial or district basis, Would represent the
consumers, as the upper house represented the producers.‘

In his daily toil, every one of us produces, or helps to pro-
duce, some commodity. He may be interested, say, in the man-

ufacture of shoes in any one of a hundred diﬁerent Ways: he‘

may be a tanner, operator of a shoe machine, a bootblack, a

. drummer, or a, shoe retail clerk. In any event, he Would‘ vote -
_ ‘for the Shoe representative in the Industrial Senate.

But as a consumer, a shoemaker needs far more than shoes.
Herequires a ‘house, clothing, food, light, heat, Water, trans-
portation, and amusement. His interest as a consumer is to
get as much as he c-an of what other men produce for as lit-
tle as he can. That is, he seeks low prices. His interest as a
producer is to get as much as he can for _What he produces-—
that is, high Wages. His interest as consumer and his interest
as producer are not the same. ’ *

Altruism might dictate that he should produce as much as
he could make for as little as he could live upon. But as a
matter of fact, altruism can be relied upon only occasionally,
The sane thing to do is to
recognize that the average man is both a producer and a con-
sumer. His interests in one capacity are not the same’ as his
interests in another. So that as consumers We should be repre-

sented in one body, and as producers in a diﬁerent body of -

- delegates. V

men like Burleson = and Palmer continue-gin ofﬁce over the’gen-

 , eral protest of all sections of the community. Everywhere
else, the Administration ‘is{ responsible to the will of the people

as. represented in the legislature.
So must we have it here. The two houses must select the

A ‘ executive ofﬁcers who conduct public affairs. These executive

ofﬁcers, the Cabinet, must be instantly responsible to the pub-

’ the voice. That is, they must all have seats ‘in the legislatures

and in Congress, to answer any questions the members may
propose and to explain the reasons for any action the mem-
bers do not understand. If a vote of censure is passed on any

- executive official, that ofﬁcial must immediately cease to hold

ofﬁce, and someone else must be appointed in whom the people
have conﬁdence. ‘

i  This is plain common sense. ‘We have seen Within the past

four years how a stubborn and self-willed President can main-
tain in ofﬁce, in actual power over the daily lives of all Ameri-
cans, men like Burleson as Postmaster General and Gregory and.

‘Palmer as Attorney-General, in spite of widespread denuncigp .
f

tion of these men as mischievous bunglers by every element

the nation. ‘ y _
So we nail down another plank: RESPONSIBLE AD-
MINISTRATION. * . .

/

IMIVIEDIATE SEATING

A very important point is IMMEDIATE SEATING.‘ At .

present,_a Congress which is elected in November, 1920, does

months after itis elected. In that time the issues which were
uppermost’ when the new Congress was elected have aded out
of people’s minds. For six months of that year a group of
men who may have been repudiated at the polls——‘ ‘lame ducks’?
as they are called—may have been in power to work mischief
in revenge ﬁor their unseating. We propose that Congressmen
elected in November shall take their seats on January 1; that
Presidents elected in November shall also take their seats J anu-"

ary 1. In this Way they will be,in power to deal with national I
affairs while their mandate from the people is .still fresh; 9‘

This, We say, is also plain common sense.
RECALL

Another necessary means of keeping representatives in
touch ‘with their people is the RECALL. Whenever an em-

ployee does not obey the orders of his superiors, he is ﬁred. 
So should it befwith public employees. Whenever a Congress- ~

man or a Governor violates his election pledges he should be

p at once recalled, unless he can give an explanation satisfactory

to the people who elected him. This again is common sense

’ and no one is opposed to it except politicians Who trade on
. broken pledges. .

SERVICE QUALIFICATION

And one point more.‘ ' Who shall vote? '

The system we ha.ve at present is ridiculous. No person
is a citizen of the United "States. We are all citizens of a
ward precinct. Not even of a state, or a county, or a city, but
of a voting precinct. If you are out of your voting precinct
on election day you are disfranchised. Even the President of

the United States must travel from Washington to Ohio, or New '

Jersey, or California, to cast his vote. If you move Within
sixty days of the election you are disfranchised. If you are
a travelling Worker, a. drummer, an electrical or civil engineer,
a contractor, an actor, a public speaker, a musician on the
road, a migratory worker on railroads or construction Work,
you are disfranchised unless you happen to be in your Ward
precinct between 8 and 4 o’clock on election day.

.Men and Women who do no useful Work, and never have

done any,‘ can vote, while energetic and necessary Workers are

deprived of all share in the government. ' ‘ V
This is both unfair and absurd. We propose a voting quali-

ﬁcation of service. Not a property qualiﬁcation, as used to be

' the rule, so that nobody could vote who did not own a certain

amount of property. Not a Ward-precinct qualiﬁcation, where-
in nobody can vote except those who are citizens of their own

HOW are we going to keep the United States of America -' ~

To this main question Socialists contend that we have,the "

OUR CONSTITUTION , V
Let us look again at the history of the formation of our .

  

Reunion” while he was Professor of History in Princeton Uni- . T

'_versity.. In it he says, on page,12:

“The. Federal Government was ‘not by intention a demo; -

cratic government. In plan and structure it had been meant

Senate,_it was believed, would be a stronghold of conservatism,
if not of aristocracy and Wealth. The President, it was ex-
pected, Would be the choice of representative men, acting in

ship, to hold the entire structure of national politics in nice

impulse or of_ oﬂiicial overbearance. Only in the House of
Representatives were the people to be accorded an. immediate
, audience, and a direct means of making their will effective in

“The Government had, in fact, been originated and.organ- .

ized upon the initiative and primarily in the interest of the ‘ ’

mercantile and wealthy classes. Originally conceived in an
effort to accommodate commercial disputes between the states,
it had been urged to adoption by a minority, under the con-
certed and aggressive leadership of able men representing a
ruling class. The Federalists not only had on their side the
power of convincing argument, but also the pressure of a
strong and intelligent class, possessed of unity and informed‘
by a conscious solidarity of material interest. .
“Hamilton, not only the chief administrative architect of V
the government, but also the author of the graver and more 

its infancy, had consciously and avowedly sought to commend
it by its measures _ﬁrst of all and principally to the moneyed
classes——to the men of the cities to Whom it must look for

: «xv-vfﬁad. i"~'>'-'-

can be no question. But it was not democratic. There can be ‘'29

a moneyed aristocracy, but there cannot be a moneyed democ-

So, in order, to introduce democracy, the people refused to

 
 

.  m.,«a.»., ,4‘ '_-.- .,
_ .

 

 .=7ra.tify this Constitution unless and until the Ten Amendments
: i 2-‘ were adopted guaranteeing freedom of speech, of press,of as-
‘  semblage and ‘of petition; guaranteeing to every man the right

to keep his own gun; protecting all the people.ag'ainst search

i ’ and seizure of their houses without due process of law." All

these Were forced into that plan of the moneyed-aristocracy,
so that the common people might have the right to discuss, to
change, and even to resist the -acts of ‘the moneyed-aristocracy.
The Ten Amendments composing the Bill of Rights were there,-
fore the sole guarantee of peaceful change, of protection of the _
people against tyranny and oppression. It follows that who-
ever overthrows or attempts to overthrow these guarantees is
an enemy of the people.

Woodrow Wilson writes, on page 14 of the same book:

“Blinded by the ardor and self-conﬁdence of the moment,
the Federalists forced through Congress the Alien and Sedition
laws. These laws excited the liveliest hostility and fear
throughout the country. Virginia and Kentucky, at the sug—
gestior of no less persons than Jefferson and Madison, uttered
their famous Resolutions. The Federalists had added to their.
original sin of representing the moneyed and aristocratic
classes, and to their later fault of hostility to France and

2’ friendship for England, the ﬁnal offense of using the powers
of the Federal Government tosuppress freedom of speech and .

trial by jury. It was a huge and a fatal blunder, and it was,
never retrieved. With the. close of J-ohn Adams’ administra-

., tion, the power of the Federalists came to an end.”

So was written the“ doom of the Federalist party. The
Federalists had formed the Union on the basis of a moneyed

_ aristocracy. And when they sought to strike out those pro-

visions forced in by the people for their protection against the
tyranny which they had risked A their lives to escape, the-
Federalist party died. ‘ B

Even so has been written the doom of the Democratic .

Party and the, Republican Party, for they united in passing

' V - ‘undercover of the world war new Alien and Sedition Laws
.ca1l_edvEspionagc Bills. By these they have sought to suppress

all criticism, all advocacy of change, all truth telling, and all

PROTECTION FOR THE « CHANGE.

:y 'pi'oﬁ_t largely by -the existing order will not ‘welcdmea change.
Those .who enjoyswollen incomes and unlimited privileges-at

'_ of our Industrial System is going on apace.

-‘and stern repression.

 

 

Now rr MUST an norm

Great industrial upheavals have tom the country for three-

'_ years. . \

Any one can see that a change is even now occurring.
But because the United States Steel Corporation has been in

' control of political power, they were able to send the United

States Army to crush the efforts of the strikers at Gary. They
sent the Pennsylvania State Cossacks to destroy the movement
for liberty in the Steel district of Pittsburgh. If those who

‘ favored Industrial Democracy in the Steel Industry had been . A
' in control of the executive ofﬁces of the State and Nation, ,
I the army and the State troops would have been used to pre-

serve and protect the rights’ of steel workers, rather" than to
destroy them. There would'have been‘ noviolence, and justice
would have been secured. -

If an aggressive party of prohibitionists had. attempted, be-'

fore the nation gave its sanction to the Dry Law, to destroy
all the breweries and distilleries by ﬁre and force, they would
have been suppressed by the government. But because the,
Prohibitionists had obtained political control, the great change
Went through in peace. No breweries or distillers barricaded
the” streets to prevent enforcement of the law which made their
vast properties worthless. They knew it would be useless, and

the change occurred in peace,‘ because political power was in K

the hands of those who favored the change. A
So Socialists say, that during the period of transitionfrom

_ the present irrational and treacherous system to a rational and

honest system such as we propose, control must be in the hands
of the workers, who are the ones to proﬁt by the new system,

, and are therefore in favor of it, instead of being, as it is now,

in the hands of exploiters,_ who resent and resist the change.
The reason is to prevent violence.

For this reason we ask political power for the Socialist
Party, which is the party of the‘ workers. The transformation

it is accompanied with wreckage and slaughter, with upheavals
If political power is in the hands of
those who favor the development, the transformation will be

" peaceful, it will be orderly, it will be intelligent.

‘for it UNITEDLY. It’s folly to be a little Socialist_Party
all by yourself, making“ a little jab at the enemy here, giving
a little slap there, registering a diminutive kick elsewhere.

If we are ‘ever to overcome capitalism; if we are ever to

UNITED action—~the disciplined and well organizedaction of
thousands upon thousands of workers, allthinking, planning,
working toward one and the same end. , i *

As an individual you can continue to snap at the heels of

this mess? ' l  _
President Wilson has told us—at last. After the-war was " 7 

over, and had been over for a year; after the long drawn out
Conferences in Paris; after the Peace Council had narrowed
down to a Big Ten, then a‘Big Five, then a Big Four, then a

Big Three; after he hadbrought back the monstrosity known‘ ,5 
as the Peace Treaty and the League of Nations—after all these ;

It was a business war, a commercial war. Commercial rivalry " 4*

between the nations lay at the bottom of it. Commercial rivalry

was the cause of it.” He said this in a speech at St. Louis, ' 

Sept. 5, 1919.

Commercial rivalry destroyed the world peace. Commer-. I

produced the madness that sent the best and bravest of every
nation’s youth to murder one another for six horrible years.

They slaughtered one another so that merchants of one country ‘ ~.  ‘’
might get the advantage over merchants of anothergcountry,  '_~

in selling goods to a third country.
