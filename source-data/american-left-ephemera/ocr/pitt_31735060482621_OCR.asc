the labor union officialdom. The Roosevelt myth encom-
passed two things: that Roosevelt was the great white
father, and that the alliance with the Democratic party ac-
counted for the gains since 1935, and was the only sound
course on which future progress could be based.

EORGE MEANY, AF L President, in a recent inter-
view printed in U.S. News $5’ World Report, assured
his questioner that the AF L still conforms to Gompers’
political line “1,000 percent.” It is doubtful that Meany
really believes this. In any case, there is not much truth
in it. The trade union leaders continue to practice capi-
talist politics. In that sense, it can be said they are fol-
lowers of Gompers’ bad tradition. But there is a whale
of a difference between the present AF L-CIO relation to
the political parties and politics, and the endorsement in
Gompers’ time of some local candidates by a central labor
union representing a few thousand, or a few tens of
thousands at the extreme, of building-trades men, printers
and machinists.
Beginning with Lewis's setting up of Labor’s Non-Parti-

san League in 1936, there has been a steady emphasis and -

evolution of the organizational side of labor’s political
structure. In 1943, the CIO-PAC was founded under Hill-
man, and in 1948, the AF L followed suit with the forma-
tion of the LLPE. In actuality, the labor unions have the
strength and experience, so that they could pull out of
the Democratic party tomorrow morning and set up a
labor party with scarcely any additional organizational ef-
forts required. The membership, the money, the organiz-
ing personnel are there to do it. The only thing lacking
is the political understanding, the program, the leadership.

I know people don’t just want to hear about the basic
trends, but want to be told what will happen next month,
or preferably next week, or better yet, tomorrow. Here,

I regret I cannot report any rapid-fire moves for a labor ,

party. As a matter of fact, our militants inform us that
the anti-labor offensive and the advance of McCarthyism
under the Republicans have momentarily refurbished the

10

 

 

glitter of the Democratic politicians for the union ranks
and reinforced their attachment to a coalition policy. The
timorousness of the self-styled “labor statesmen” in the
face of the reactionary sweep has served to weaken la,-
bor’s position even inside the Democratic party in the
wake_of the 1952 defeat, rather than strengthening it as
the most important grouping of that machine. But it is
safe to say that this is only a transient phase. Once the
winds of economic distress begin to blow more fiercely,
the whole rickety coalition setup will be subjected to un-
bearable stresses and strains. A new political realignment
will no longer be postponed.

You might say, suppose a labor pa_rty is created, what
is so inspiring about a labor party led by Meany and
Reuther, Dubinsky and Potofsky? Where is Socialism
ahead with this crew? Well, the cause of Socialism would
surely perish were it to depend on any one or all of these
“statesmen.” Neither am I one of those who would sug-
gest that a labor party will be led at the first stage by a dif-
ferent kind of people. I am not a member of the fraternity
who mouth phrases about a revolutionary labor party.
Nevertheless, I am convinced that labor’s break with capi-
talist politics would have marked revolutionary conse-
quences, despite its initial leadership.

I RECALL IN THIS CONNECTION the importance

of the radicals in the first formative years of the (310,
not only the organized fractions of the left-wing parties,
but many unattached individual left-wingers. They played
an enormous role, out of all proportion to their numbers.
Radicalism fused for a short period with the native mili-
tancy of the workers in the shops—and the alliance worked
wonders while it was in operation.

No matter that after the first few years a more funda-
mental program was needed to keep the movement in
progress———and that such a program was lacking. No matter
that the old core of CIO militants was soon absorbed
into the new labor bureaucracy, or smothered in the Stalin-
ist embrace, or dispersed in a dozen different directions.

11

 

No matter that the radical who deserved so much credit
for building the CIO unions became persona non grata
in the later stages. The role of American Marxism, and
of the Marxist cadre was clearly foreshadowed in these
first years of turbulence and upsurge. And when the
American workers take their destiny into their hands again,
it is a foregone conclusion that the left-wingers will be,
from the first, an important factor in the new advance,
and a respected voice in the councils of the organization.

Because a labor party——if one is formed—-will arise in
the midst of the smoke and ruin of war and economic
catastrophe, at a time when the political problems of our
society cannot be evaded. In contrast to the CIO exper-
ience, the role of the Left will not be a passing one, because
the American system is heading into the historical crisis
that has gripped the rest of the world, and will no longer
be able to keep the allegiance of the people. It will be
inc-reasingly forced to maintain its rule by terror, oppres-
sion, fascism or military dictatorship——or for intervals,
through laborite intermediaries and coalitions. That is why
American radicalism from the transient enterprise that it
has been since the Civil War is due to emerge as the
authentic expression of labofs aspirations and struggles.
That is the new perspective and reality.

Will the Stalinists make a comeback in the new re-
surgence and take over the leadership of the left wing in
the labor party movement as they did in the course of
the CIO upheaval? Of course, discussions of this kind
have an element of the speculative about them, but per-
sonally, I don't think they will. I do not base my opinion
primarily on the betrayals that the Stalinists perpetrated.
I am aware that new generations of militants are not as
well acquainted with that as we are. I know further that
Stalinist betrayals did not bar their emerging as mass par-
ties in Italy and France after the war. And the present
unrestrained baiting and persecution of them—if they
survive it-——may well redound to their benefit at a later
stage of radicalization. “The blood of the martyrs is the
seed of the church.”

12

 

But every country has its own national peculiarities and
unique forms of development. There is no uniformity.
Stalinist resurgence after the war was not a universal phe-
nomenon. It was not the fulfillment of some kind of his-
torical law. It occurred in France and Italy because of
the convergence of specific circumstances. It did not take
place in England, West Germany, Belgium or Holland.

I know that in the United States numbers of advanced
workers were growing hostile to the Stalinists, and the
latter had been losing some ground, especially in the
unions, before the red scare started. It is likely that the
next -wave of radicalization will coincide with crises in
a number of Stalinist parties, and revolts against Stalinist
rule, on the order of what happened in East Germany;
in other words, when Stalinism is losing its attractive power.
I envisage the initial wave of radicalization in America
taking place through the organized unions, the workers
moving massively through their organizations. I envisage
the next stage as one of differentiation and growing oppo-
sition to the official labor bureaucracy, and can see that
as taking the form of an American variety of Bevanism,
with the second stage coming hard on the heels of the
first. I can visualize a development along this line, because
I believe there will arise along with radicalization, a pro-
gressive opposition to the Stalinists, and because no exist-
ing left-wing group, including the Stalinists, has any real
hold on the American labor ranks.

OF THE SOCIALIST UNION OF AMERICA

have in our membership some of the cream of the
generation of the past CIO battles. We have set up this
new organization as a culmination of our two-year struggle
inside the old Trotskyist organization, the Socialist Workers
Party. That old group of leaders have exhausted their
progressive mission. Their old role as popularizers of Trot-

sky’s struggle and writings is played out. These men could ~

not adapt their thinking to the new world of the Soviet
bloc and the cold war. They have succumbed to their

13

 

i

 

prolonged isolation. They are bewildered by the new prob-
lems to which they have no answers. They are solving
their disorientation by infantile bragging, and high-sound-
ing declamations and posturings. They are delivering ulti-
matums to the labor movement, which are not only uni-
versally ignored, but pass completely unnoticed. And they
are keeping themselves and their followers hopped up
with a lot of crackpot antics which they call “mass cam-
paigns.” The SWP represents the new SLP’ism of the
American radical movement. It will shrivel up and be-
come increasingly a haven for screwballs and bigots.

Cannon and others deserve a lot of credit for breaking
with Stalinism twenty-five years ago and bringing the
message of Trotsky to America. They deserve a lot of
credit for gathering a cadre of militants to struggle for
it. But their bent in recent years to ignore the actual trends
and to counterpose their tiny, unknown organization to
the actual struggle has spelled disaster. They have now
turned their backs on the world and its problems, and
have resolved to dwell in their own ivory tower, with
their own “ordained leaders,” and their own holy scrip-
ture. The SWP leaders have become museum pieces. We
will not meet them too often in the days to come. Let the
dead bury their dead.

We, as a Marxist cadre, conceive our task today as an
educator of broader ranks of workers and intellectuals, and
as a catalyst in the existing movements and struggles. We
believe that the great teachings of the Marxist masters have
to be applied in terms of the new social problems of our
lifetime and the current tasks of American labor. In the
light of the present reaction and witch-hunt, we have to
direct our message to those specific circles that are pre-
pared to listen and give us a hearing. Where, in a city
like New York, the biggest aggregation of militants is to
be found in the so-called Stalinist-front movements, we

have to penetrate these circles and work together with .

their activists. In the country as a whole, we have to elicit
the attention and sympathy of the most advanced workers
in the unions. Marxism has to become known not as a

14

 

 

dead dogma, not a set of quotations, but the keenest
analysis of the social reality and a living answer to the
problems of the day. The Marxist cadre, if it does its
work well, will have the opportunity of fusing with other
left wing currents as they arise in the course of the com-
ing conflicts. Not by boasting that we are the “chosen
few,” and that the holy petroleum has been poured over
our heads, but by aligning ourselves with the actual
struggles of our generation, will we become a factor in
the creation of the mass revolutionary party of tomorrow.

WE ARE PART OF THE STREAM OF HISTORY.

We are confident of our future because we believe
we have the correct understanding and tactic, and because
we know we have the body of militants with the grit and
tenacity to carry on. Do not anybody despair because of
our small numbers, or because the movement of the left
in general is so isolated today. We are like the American
abolitionists of a hundred years ago. We are like Garrison
and Wendell Phillips and Frederick Douglass and John
Brown, who were on the side of truth and justice and
whose aims coincided with the line of historical progress.
The abolitionists, for years, were only a handful preach-
ing to indifferent and often jeering crowds. The circula-
tion of Garrison’s paper, the Liberator, was insignificant.
John Brown was reviled as a lunatic and hanged as a
common felon. But a few years later his name was on a
nation’s lips, and Union soldiers storming the ramparts of
the South were singing the famous battle hymn: “John
Brown’s body lies a-moulderin’ in the grave; but his soul
goes marching on.”

These men—--these great men——eamed fame and immor-
tality, and their crusade triumphed because they were in-
trepid fighters and heroes of vast stature, and because~—
what is decisive——the anti-slavery cause coincided with
the line of march of the American republic. And the cause
that we espouse, the cause of Socialism, will conquer, be—
cause it too coincides with the needs of humanity and the
moving line of history.

Prospects of
American Radicalism

by Bert Cochran

MODERN AMERICAN LABOR RADICALISM was

born out of the savageries of the -buccaneer capitalism
of the post-Civil War epoch, and announced itself in full-
throated fashion in the bitterly fought rail strikes of 1877.
This radicalism—-—whether tinted or dominated by Marx-
ism, or of the American populist variety——has had many
ups and downs, and has reasserted itself in innumerable
forms and variations in the seventy-five year interval. But
after three-quarters of a century of innumerable exper-
iences, the American working class—the largest in the
world—is still without its own political party, still adheres
to the philosophy of capitalism, and dutifully supports
the capitalist parties on election day. The anti-capitalist
left wing is weak and isolated.

This is not because American workers are congenitally
wedded to capitalism at all. Labor radicalism had reached
great heights in certain periods. The Socialist Party from
1904 to the first world war was a mass movement. The
IWW flashed its blinding light across the horizon in this
same decade. At a later period, the Communist Party
was registering great successes for a few years with the
rise of the CIO.

But the rock on which radicalism in America repeatedly

2

 

AA

 

broke its head was the lack of constancy, the lack of sus-
tained interest on the part of big groups of workers in
opposition to the capitalist system. So, the graph of the
organized Socialist opposition would in a broad general
way reflect the ups and downs of the economic cycle.
And as American capitalism exhibited a remarkable vigor
throughout these decades, overcame every depression with
a period of new stonny growth, and provided the Ameri-
can worker with the highest standard of living in the
world, American radicalism, in contrast to its European
counterparts, has time and again found itself reduced to
a sect.

It was the 1929 economic crisis that smashed up this
capitalist idyll, and started the Europeanization of Ameri-
can capitalism. The special highly favored positions of
the past had disappeared. The virgin continent had been
conquered and ravaged. The laws of capitalism, discovered
by Karl Marx a century before, were remorselessly at work
in the United States as elsewhere. The economic system
came grinding almost to a dead stop. National income was
slashed in half by 1932. Banks were failing from one end
of the country to the other. Wages were cut right and
left. 20 million unemployed roaming the highways and by-
ways. Farmers driven off their land. Hoovervilles spring-
ing up on the edges of the cities. The American people,
living in the richest country in the world, reduced to
penury and degradation, with fear and despair stalking
the land.

As many economists and sociologists have since demon-
strated, the 1929 crisis was not just another cyclical de-
pression. It was a fundamental crisis of a declining world
system.

UT OF THAT AGONY came later the wave of
strikes which boiled up to a veritable civil war in a
host of industries and cities, the like of which had never

, been seen in this country. And out of that class warfare

came the modern industrial union movement, the CIO.
For the first time, the American working class was solidly

3


I
l
l

organized in the basic mass production industries. For
the first time, the organized unions represented not a
small minority of a favored aristocracy of labor, but em-
braced the heart of the working population.

‘The victory was great. Wages were improved. The
shop steward system revolutionized working relationships
inside the plants. The hitherto atomized and helpless
working masses emerged as a power, and decisively al-
tered the face of dozens of American cities.

Marxists, and as a matter of fact, radicals of all stripes,
placed great hopes in this new crusading movement, and
thought that the new experiences were driving the Amer-
ican workers to class consciousness. But this movement,
so full of militancy and high promise in its first years,
deteriorated badly with America's entrance into the war.
The masses meekly followed their capitalist masters into
the slaughter. There wasn’t even anything resembling the
anti-war protest of the pacifists and Debs Socialists of
1917. In the next few years, as the original aggressiveness
of the ranks subsided, the new unions got badly bureau-
cratized. The CIO officers vied with their older AFL
cousins as top-sergeants in charge of the labor forces for
the war effort. Today, the CIO and AF L leaderships are
indistinguishable in their political outlook.

On the other side, what Roosevelt was unable to accom-
plish with all his NRA codes, WPA’s and New Deal
legislation, American capitalism achieved through the
war—it put the people to work. America entered a period
of triumphant boom. The working labor force rose to dizzy
heights going over the 60 million mark. The gross na-
tional product mounted with each year until it was
double in 1948 what it was in 1929. Real wages rose 20
percent over 1939. What with overtime, two bread-
winners in many families and the like, American people
began buying washing machines, television sets, auto-
mobiles on a scale never equalled in the country’s history.

This prosperity goes a long way to explain the ease"
with which the new bureaucracy fastened itself on the
unions, and with which the capitalist powers-that-be

4

 

 

thrust the country into the witch-hunt. The sum total of
these factors contrived to leave the revolutionary move-
ment high and dry, in its most isolated position since the
early Twenties.

DOES NOT ALL THIS add up to a crushing refu-
tation of the Marxist thesis, and confound radicals
of all varieties and hues? Is not American capitalism, far
from declining, making right now its most spectacular
advances?

American imperialism has certainly displayed an ability
to prolong the boom beyond many people’s expectations.
But the whole vast structure of this titan rests, like the
house in the fairy tale, on chicken legs. The country re-
sembles more and more a secluded enclave of plenty in
a raging sea of misery. With about 6 percent of the
world’s population, the United States share of world in-
come rose from 26 to 4-0 percent in the two decades up
to 1948, and the United States and Canada accounted
for half the world's industrial output in that year. These
statistics have their political counterpart in the fact that
the United States remains the only solvent, half-stable
power in the disrupted system of world imperialism, and
the only one which can still command national unity at
home.

But even internally, the boom exhausted itself in reality
by 1949. All the special, artiﬁcial factors of war shortages,
war savings, huge loans and give-away programs and
armaments production notwithstanding, the country was
headed for a depression at the end of 1949. Some may
recall how Truman was speechifying in those days—just
like some of the Republican speeches we hear today-
about the “healthy” aspects of a “readjustment.” An in-
dustrial reserve army of 3 to 4- million was back with us,
and the country seemed to be moving down the toboggan
slide towards life in the Thirties.

It was the Korean war that sent war expenditures soar-
ing again from 14» to 50 billion dollars annually and gave
the jaded system another stiff shot in the arm. But once

5

you start living on a diet of dope, you need constantly
larger doses to keep you going. Employment and living
standards were maintained for only four ‘years by this
enormous outlay for war production. And now the system
is headed downward again just as at the end of 1949-
on the basis, not of a 14 billion, but a 50 billion dollar
war budget!

This demonstrates not the stability of the American
economyvand the soundness of the boom, but on the con-
trary its feverish, spasmodic and precarious character, rest-
ing as it does on direct and indirect exploitation of the
rest of the capitalist world, and the unending expansion
of the war sector.

S IT CORRECT TO SAY therefore that we are mov-

ing toward a 1929-type crash again? With all due re-
spect to the intellectual retainers of the capitalist masters,
that veritable army of economists, sociologists, psycholo-
gists, public relations experts, sloganeers and what have
you; with all due respect to this mob of hirelings and
their fancy theories about “built-in protective devices” and
“cushions”——sou—nds like an ad for automobile uphol-
stery; were the I system permitted to proceed in accord-

,4 ance with its “built-in” economic laws, that’s exactly
where it would be heading: towards a 1929-type crash,

and probably within a very few years," at that. And yet,
I don’t believe we will see a depression of that depth.
I don’t believe it because I think the American multi-
millionaires will unleash the third world war when they
see the system heading for the economic reefs. '
’ Charles E. Wilson, the man who opined what’s good
for General Motors is good for the country—-and he’s a
pretty authoritative spokesman of the Economic Roya1ty—
made a speech a couple of years ago at the University of
Michigan where he said he didn't believe the system could
survive another Hoover depression. I‘ agree with him. I
don’t think it could. The system would be finished. There
would be revolutions in Western Europe. The colonial
revolt would blaze fiercely through Asia and Africa. And

6

the United States would be in the throes of class warfare.
That is why I believe the American policy makers will
go to war when they face the economic abyss.

This being -the case, and this being the reality con-
fronting us, don’t let’s get too hypnotized by the false
flush of prosperity in the past decade. Don’t let’s lose
our heads and sense of proportion because people have
had steady jobs and brought home good pay checks. We
have had to take the paychecks with a large dose of Me-

Carthyism. And. even so, it’s not going to last. At the
. end of the road is a cataract of horrors of atomic war.

IGHT NOW A TREMOR OF UNEASINESS is
passing through the ranks, and even the leaders of
union labor, as they watch the uninterrupted progress of
McCarthyism, and as they. get worried about another de-
pression. But McCarthyism will continue its triumphal
march until it is confronted with a counter-force. The
witch-hunt will catapult to ever dizzier heights and en-
compass ever greater numbers of victims. The demands of
the Garrison State are due to become more ruthless and
oppressive. Reaction is on the march on all fronts. And
finally, war itself will bring disaster, death and destruction;
Out of this awful crucible will come the great change
in America. A great, profound change. A change in the
people’s thinking, a change in their attitude toward the
system, a change. in_ their attitude toward the govem-
ment, a change in their attitude toward the war. This
working class, which is today so conservative and slug-
gish, will grow radical, and amaze the whole world, as
it did in .1936, with its combativity and daring. Don’t let
us-forget that this class,‘ starting from a point of no organ-
ization, built, in the short space of five years, the most
powerful union organizations in the world. Don’t let us
forget that this class, helpless and defenseless when the
’29 crisis broke over its head, and believing up to that
point in rugged individualism, absorbed so ‘well some of
the elementary truths of modern life and their own po-
sition, that by 1936‘ they seized plants, they organized

7

mile-long picket lines, they humbled legislatures by their
massed might, they overwhelmed the barons of industry
by their sheer weight. Talk about militancy and mass ac-
tion. Jack London wrote at the turn of the century works
of fiction about general strikes and future struggles, and
even Socialists thought at the time that he was only a
romancer and rhapsodist. Yet nothing he conjured up fic-
tionally compared with the majestic sweep of the C10
in its formation.

AT FORMS WILL the new radicalization take,

how will it differ from the past, and who will lead it?

The new leftward swing will very likely be introduced
with a whole series of strikes against the economic conse-
quences of war preparations, or the war itself. As these
mount in intensity, the capitalists will turn on the labor
movement with’ old-time ferocity, and proceed ‘ to break
strikes and bust unions with traditional lack of inhibition

and violence. At one point or another, the movement of ’

protest will assume national proportions, and the cry be-
come universal for the creation of a shield to ward off
the menacing attack. That may be the moment when a
new political party of the laboring people is launched.
It is thus at least probable that the first organizational
form of the next wave of radicalization will be the estab-
lishment of a labor party under the aegis of an important
section of labor union officials, most likely in alliance
with liberal politicians of the Hubert Humphrey type.

Actually, the American working class has made prog-
ress even along this line in the last twenty years, even
though its political development has been very slow, cer-
tainly far slower than radicals hoped for, and at times,
even freely predicted. Let us fix the high points of this
process in our minds in order better to understand the
present position and direction:

In the Twenties, the working class, outside of the small I

minority of skilled craftsmen, was unorganized and po-
litically dispersed. The movements of the past, like Debs
Socialism, had disintegrated, and capitalist politics had a

8

\

 

monopoly of the field. Roosevelt’s election gave an impetus
to and coincided with the mass political upheaval. Great
struggles swept over the country in the so-called NRA
wave-——but there was also great inexperience, great naivete,
an absence of authentic leaders. The new political awaken-
ing took the form of a pathetic dependence on Roosevelt
and a childish faith in his disinterested championship of
the people’s cause.

Two years of sell-outs of all the major NRA strikes in
the open-shop industries put the iron in the workers’ souls.
The masses in the basic industries found themselves still
without organization and protection. The “Blue Eagle”
promises of a “New Deal” for the workingman had not
been forthcoming. The seething in the ranks split the
leadership of the AFL and led to the formation of the
CIO. Shortly thereafter came the second great upheaval,
beginning with the sit-down strikes in Akron and continu-
ing without letup until the defeat of the Little Steel strike
in the fall of 1937, which coincided with the “Roosevelt
recession.”

By now the relationship in the camp of the New Deal
had drastically altered. Millions of working men and wom-
en were organized in solid phalanxes, disposing of massive
power. The support of Roosevelt continued unabated. His
personal popularity even grew. But the millions of labor
were no longer just a shapeless mass of worshipping pil-
grims burning incense at the shrine of their patron saint.
They had advanced to the position of an organized sector
of an American backdoor variety of People’s Front co-
alition.

A special confluence of circumstances here conspired to
nurture the Roosevelt myth and keep it green over many
years. A virgin working class, with no conception of class
politics or its own potential strength, could never forget
that the New Deal established the political climate which
made possible the building of the new unions, and that
then, for over a decade, living standards rose and the
main labor bodies were registering impressive gains. These
material benefits sanctified the pro-Roosevelt policies of
