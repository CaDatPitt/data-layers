By this time, the City Council's
earlier panic was abating. Three of
the nine council-members had defi-
nitely promised to vote against the
fence,‘ though willing to "accept other
University conditions. (But the UW
was adamant on‘the fence; the council
might have compromised at that point
in spite of our efforts, but the Univer-
sity wouldn't. ) Two others, still

' withholding commitment, seemed to be

leaning ourvway and hesitating only
from concernfor maintenance funding.
When the Parks and Public Grounds
Committee's advice to lease the

A Arboretum went to the full council,

members facing election. were in no
hurry to vote contrary to the»recom-
mendation of most of the city's com -
munity councils, its central bomrriuni- _
ty council federation, _and the Demo-
cratic Party club of its most populous
districts. The council stalled, under
thelpretext of "continuing to negotiate

, with the University. "

That of course worked to our ad-

A vantage --it was what quite a_ few of the

yr

APC members‘ efforts had been di —
rected toward abringinlg about--but
meanwhile the Arboretum itself was
taking something of ab\eating, because
the UW had already withdrawn'muci/1 of
its maintenance work in order to de-
monstrate how the place‘ would deter-.
iorate without it. The forestry de-
partment head declared it was "going
to weeds"; we found in the city's aru-
chives, and reproducedfor a leaflet, a
beautiful photograph takenthere in l9l0
(before the lush natural growth was

Acl_eared)to publicize the loveliness~of

the site's native "weeds"—-in the pic -
ture, mostly swordferns and trilliums.
Actually, the Arboretum-didn't deter -
iorate as much as the UW administra-
tors apparently ho‘ped;,nature is won -
_derfully self-sustaining.
As soon as the spring weather
stabilized, we called a rally in the
Arboretum to launch a petition drive.
Through the summer, we conducted
walks through the Arboretum,‘ with
guides expounding its history and iden -
tifying plant and animal species. One
way and another, the APC kept the is-
sue before the public all through 19 73,
while.the Council and the Mayor pre-
dictably p_ostponed reaching a decision,
Adelayédfirst by the city elections and
later by APC ‘s point-after -point chal -
lenges to the findings of their‘legally-
required Environmental Irnpabt State -
ment. The first of January, 19 74, the

APC hit the streets with its initiative,

I

v

a short, simply-worded ordinance
proposalwith minimal legal verbiage ,
encompassing the Coalition's 4-point,
program. By law here, no final de-
cision can be made on an issue while
initiative legislation to decide it is
pending, so filing the initiative con-
tinued to stave off the giveaway, even
after we lost one of our supporting
council members in the election.

It was a miserably long, cold,
rainy spring--terrible initiative wea-
ther. The Coalition at first dropped
far behind the weekly signature quotas
it had set. Nobody was signing any-
thing on street-corners or in super-
market parking-lots; everyone just
hurried past to get in out of the rain.-
Members took to gathering signatures

A indoors, in stores, restaurants, and

theatre lobbies, asking the manager

tfirst. Almost any manager who'd sign

- -and mo stdid- -would co -operate with
polling the patrons. One signature-
gatherer consistently worked the then
long gas -station lines early in the
morning, A with spectacular success ;
people we re relatively warm and com-
fortable in the shelter of their cars,
and bored enough with waiting to wel-
come a diversion. Another worked the
corridors and lounges of buildings on
the UW campus, concehtlrating on jun-
ior faculty. People with'dogs like to
take them to run in the Arboretum; my
neighborhood veterinarian collected a
lot of signatures over his counter, with
ahigher-than-ave rage rate of validity.
(To be valid, initiative -petition signa -

tures must be those of registered v_o— .
ters; avoid places, like schools and I
V most bars, where many people willing

to sign areounlikely to be registered,
because totals are deceptive if the per -
centage of invalid signatures runs
higher than expected.) It's possible
to gather signatures successfully in
bad weather; it just -takes more time
and imagination--and a sheet of ace-
tate over your clipboard. A
The two APC members who had
volunteered to co-ordinate the initia-
tive -"petition campaign set a quota high
enough to allow generous margin for
inv_alid signatures, anda deadline date
far enough in advance of the legal dead-
line to allow extension of the campaign
if necessary, ‘(The unusually long
stretch of bad weather did make it ne-
ces sary. ) They divided that total quota
‘into weekly subquotas, and supplied
each person active in the campaign
with an 8-1/2 x 11'' poster illustrated

The current social-economic crisis in this
country has had many repercussions, not the
least of which is a crisis of identity. People
have shed a great deal of their former loyal-*‘
ty to capitalist. institutions even though that
anger may at present be seen as cynicism or
‘apathy . All the opinion polls usually show

. business and gov't at the bottom of the heap.

{What should catch the attention of anarchists
Sis afeeling that a real cultural vacuum seems
to exist. The state has not come up with a
new set of value s‘ or illusions (new only in the
sense of new wine in old bottles) that can at-
tract a significant majority of the people. Lets
face it, life is becoming more alienated and;
dull, and people are open tojalternatives.

The whole nostalgia genre can be seen as a
sterile attempt at filling the void until they can‘;
come up with something better. Even the TV’

programs and movies displaya singular lack .
[of direction. Their best effort seems‘ to be

;the barrage of cop and detective shows that’
_seem to imply a nation under some sinister’
-crime wave and the police are depicted as the
‘usual champions of order. But for all the sub-
terfuge they have no one to pin the blame on.

The system isfloundering, Madison Ave. has"

not found a scapegoat and a-1l‘we getis various
!forms of escapism, mora1izing,‘and a "well
alt could be worse" attitude.
I What all this amounts to is an opening wedge
'-for anarchism to have some real impact on
Zthe social-cultural life of this country. We
,are closer to the personal-cultural side of
life than any group on the left spectrum and
have important thingsjto say and do to change
this society. So how do we begin to sort things
‘out, torreach out into the lives and minds of
the majority of people ? How to’ become avia-
ble alternative that people not only will accept
as just, but will be seen as a practical’ ap-
proach that can be achieved in the here and
now. ; ~
I think it is necessary to briefly analyze the
60's cultural situation before going on, be-
cause an anarchist culture must be contrasted
with what passed as the "new culture" of the
;60's. I'm not saying all/the energy people
;used up tryingto build, alternatives went for

-.{nothing, but by limiting itself to the middle

‘class it negated the important needs and as-
jpirations of mostVworkin_g\people.‘- The anti-

  

 

ANARCHIST cuuunt

author’ita'r"ian'ism and the many attempts. to
build alternatives __were genuine ‘and left us

-many important insights. Even if so many A

searchings for cultural alternatives resulted
in dead-ends or dissipated whenthe going got

'‘ rough, it taught us many lessons. Comingput
of McCarthyism and the deadness of the \50's
lpeople almost had to begin at ground zero.5

That we .often stumble along like cripples in
our searchfor alternatives is no disgrace.
The only disgrace would be if we failed to learn.
from past mistakes.

The 60's has ‘taught us that it is not enough

‘to proclaim a_new culture’ by issuing some

manife stos and, when a few people participate
or initiate something, pretend something sub-
stantial really exists. That was much of the
facade created during the 60's. A lot of people
went through the whole experience superfi-

cially. If you smoked dope, had long hair,

grooved on rock music and proclaimed your-
self a revolutionary that was. somehow felt tor

be enough. The evidence is readily apparent‘?

that much of the militant rhetoric of the coun-

‘ -ter-culture was based on a lot of hot air, and
mat concrete alternatives that could really.

have lasting effect. Culture is much more
than an ephemeral media show. It is not un-
usual today to walk on a college campus and
find‘ that for most people the counter-culture

 means lmysticism, occultism, or some iso-
wlated getting your head together,trip. The

failure of the counter-culture_ of the 60's to
come to grips with sexism, elitism, and age-
ism certainly took its toll..

Creating new cultural forms that can be pick-
ed up by and have meaning for a majority of
people is essential. Just being different is
not enough. The new forms must be politi-
cally related and grounded firmly with the pro-
spective goal ‘of social revolution. An apoli-
tical culture of drugs for drugs sake, artfor

_;arts sake, etc, lends itself easily to co-opta-

tion and fadism. Look how the whole music
scene in the 60's was co-opted by the mechan-
isms ofthe market. In fact th "counter-cul-
ture never could move beyond the entangle-
,ments of "homo-economicus" (defined as de-
ftermining our e_xistenc_e_.Aa_s_> o3e__whe1_{e making
'rrioh'ey and continually running the treadmill
of consumerism is seen as the necessary goal
of life)‘. The commitrnent tosocialﬁchange

mustbe interwoven into the cultural fabric.
Also the "counter-culture" of the 60's re-

'mained pretty much a closed system for youth. .
A cultural alternative based on youth or any

other limited category will not have any hold-
ing power. A culture of social change must
be able to appeal to all strata of the popula-
tion to be able to expand and exhibit the tena-
city necessary to survive. '

We as anarchists know that music, art, thea-
ter, and personal life style are just as impor-

_ 'tant as any other aspect of human existence.
-We know that the. constant bickering between
the political-theoretical people on one hand.

*' ‘and the cultural-personal people on thf other

must be ended. It is not possible to liberate
one half of the characteristics that make us
human and leave the rest till later. Our cul-
ture must be based on a collective reaching

’out, or it can easily become bogged down in

Lego trips or easy outs for a tolerated few.
;The system can always absorb atiny minority
bf avant- gardes. They are no real threat.
Culture must meet the. basic needs of people
‘to be an anarchist culture. And the most basic
need to respond to is mutual aid. But the ne-
cessity fdr revolutionary culture is not always
anticipated. How many historical cases can
be found where the very people fighting for

social change (for all their militancy and step-—

ping outside of the accepted political and eco-
nomic boundaries) remained firmly entrench-

‘ed in the old cultural values and lifestyles.

by a leadership of "vanguards" or whatever,

slot yourself into the existing structure. You

but in essence the centralized capitalist state

The time seems ripe for an anarchist’alter-pl

native. People are more open to change now
thanthey have been for along time. Of course
:it is far easier to sit back and proselytize than
to actually get out and do something to make
it happen. But at bestlthe most one can- do in
theory is to point out various guidelines to fol-
low; the specifics are always of necessity left

to those who actually work out our anarchist"

alternative in practice. The thing we mint

always remember about theory is that it ‘has

constantly to be updated to meet the changing

;needs of time. Our new culturalforms cannot‘

remainthe‘ sterile forms of our present soci-
ety, but must breathe withlife. Life and vi-

tality need the collective experience. Though.
-theory and concept may come into being thru_

the work of individuals or small groups, it is
the heartbeat of a million hearts that will build

",a_. new life style. ‘They, ofnecessity, need peo-

inmy mind, describes this in The Mass Psy-

revolutionary minded; the "decent" suit of

a thousand other "banalities" have an incom-
parably greater reactionary influence when
"repeated day after day than thousands of'revo-
lutionary rallies and leaflets can ever hope to

counterbalance." I think those words reveal

to us a great deal of what needs to be done.
It has nevernbeen unusual for'people of even
the highest revolutionary calibre to put ab-
stract concepts ahead of empirical evidence.
"How often have r_e_volu_t_ionaries let the every-

day cultural values fend'—for themselves. An‘-‘ .

because our theory is based on the personal,

‘(The following article is from the March, 1975
issue of Black Flag, 83a Haverstock Hill, London
NW3. We reprint it because Black Flag is not
seenby as many persons as. is The Match! and
frompast experience, we don't expect the wor -
kers at BlackFlag to receive any airing in The
Match! to correct Fred Woodworth's one -sided
fusillade against them. We hope readers will be
able to balance the two positions with this con-
tribution. We think it is unfortunate Fred Wood-
worth cannot be more fair and‘balanced in his
paper.)

Some, reading (say) of persecutions of
Catholics in Hungary (or Communists in Chile)
may sayuncharitably "serve you right": if the
opinionisbolsteredby "As a Catholic (or what-
ever)myself..."(as-happens in the case of ce_r-
tain sycophantic Hungarian’ Catholics indeed)
one must speak of treason. People should not
use their alleged opinions or involvement to help
persecution in this way. When this stand is
built-in in advance one sniffs out more than’
treasbn. These thoughts are instigated by con-
sideration of as pretended 'anarchist' journal
"The Match" (Tucson, Arizona).

It plays no part in anarchist agitation, or.-
ganisation or activity; by plagiarising and re-

printing articles from other journals (and omitt- \

ing to mention the author's names) it has at-
tracted some contributors from outside. Other-
wise its raison d'etre is to denounce anarchist
actions at «appropriate times. Without being
paranoic over the reasons for this, we canvcon-
sider its editor and owner Fred Woodworth as a
fifth columnist who can be used by the State in
repressive court cases. It is bad enoughto have
such people who go weak or turn sour (the Garcia
Pradas variety): ‘here one sees the type pre -

fabricated waiting only for anarchist action to be

able to say "as an anarchist I denounce it..'."I
On the only occasion Woodworth faced/a court /

(on a charge of resisting a policeman) neither
he nor his lawyer once mentioned that the real
reasonfor his arrest was for having distributed

p an anarchist anti-war leaflet.

Illnnden llnrse

In its February 1975 issue Woodworth at-
tacks us in such an article that says little about
us but throws muchklight upon himself.

Proclaiming his utter devotion and reverence
for life as a’ reason for’ his attack on Marcus
Graham's article on the SLA, he says of this 83 A
year old comrade "obscene old man... erratic...
neurotic...putrid rhetoric...contempt loathing...
(a choice insight into non-violent fascism).
Graham has‘ given "Black Flag"--states Wood-
worth--"a large sum of money" from which it
has bought "an offset litho and expensive com-
posing equipment" (see our regularly printed
balance sheets) thus weaning hacks "Melt zer and
Christie "from their well-known pure pristine
pacifism so that they (nobody'else) are now
"riding high"onthe money of an elderly retired
workingman!‘ In this attack Woodworth (who
served, his apprenticeship in character assas-
sination duringva sixpyear stunt as a radio an-
nouncer) equates age with money: he does not
comprehend thatthis paper could be produced by

(workers voluntarilyin their spare time, or that

people could freely propagate their views other
than for cash; indeed mortgage their wages to
keep agitation going. Money must come from
Big Daddy; it is not worked,for; it comes from

obedience to the old. The rest of the insults .

printed against us stem from this thesis and are

' not worth printing except to amuse our enemies

and physically sicken our friends. ,
Perhaps one should, in view of the state-
ments in Match, clarify Marcus Graham's at-
titude to the British movement. He edited MAN!
from 1933 to 1940 in the USA. It is alleged his

articles were refused by Freedom, This was

never the /case (indeed the publisher's intro-

duction to Rockerts Anarchismand Anarcho-~
Syndicalism 1973, notes with appreciation his
contribution of 30 years before). When pre-
paring an anthology of MAN! (having been its

editor during the existence of that paper)he
originally proposed that Freed'Press ‘should
publishit with Marcus Graham covering all the

printing costs and the proceeds from its sale to
go to Freedo\rn. But disagreeing with the attitude
implicit in the article by N. Walter (22. 4. 73)

on’the Stoke Newington Eight trial, the withdrew

‘ the offer and paid for labour done. Afterwards

this offer was made ,to\B\lack Flag. It was pas-
sed to Cienfuegos Press, which was already in
the process of publishing Sabatev, and costs were
covered entirely by Marcus Graham and A. R.

For whatever heuristic value it may
have to others who are into community-
and/or issue -organizing, here follows

The University of Washington

V Arboretum is located just across the

ship -canalfrom the UW campus , on an
approximately 2-00-acre tract of land
owned by the City of Seattle and dedi-
cated since its acquisition about 19 00 to
perpetual public -park use. Since the
Arboretum's establishment in 1934, it
has been operated under a joint-use and
joint-maintenance agreement between

the City and the University. It has -
I- been unfenced, and open to the public
.under the same ordinances and regu-

lations that govern other city parks.
By tradition, usage, and even law, it
i_s_ a city park. Peoplejog on its trails
and picnic in its meadows, kids fish in
its ponds and play hide -and-seek in its
woods, and old folk stroll along its’
broad grass_y promenade--smooth e-

I nough for w_'ﬁ°e‘elchairs- -to view its rho -

dodendrons and flowering trees.

,' Original construction of the Ar-
boretum, in the '30's, was a broad-
bas ed endeavor in which the University
--then a rather naive institution chidly
concerned with undergraduate educa -
tion, with no perceived need for a high-
ly technical arboretum- -played some -

what less than the major role. A volun- .

tary organization of tree-lovers and
garden.enthusiasts raised the funds to
bring back to Seattle the firm of park
designers --- sons‘ of Frederick Law
Olmsted--who had planned the city's
boulevard system some years before.
The federal Works Progress Adminis -

tration provided the pick-and-shovel
labor to carry out the Olmsteds' con- ,
ception, transforming an undeveloped‘

ravine into a varied terrain of grassy
slopes, wooded hillsides, and stream-

_ linked ponds. Hundreds of volunteers

contributed plants--‘the basis of the
Arboretur_n's tnost impressive collec —
tion was a gift from a private donor--
and gave of their time and labor to help
with planting and propagating, under
the direction of University ho/rticul-
turalists. So though the signs at its
entrances read University of Washing-
‘ton Arboretum, ‘it has never belonged

A to the University. The University has ‘

simply used the Arboretumfor its own
purposes, as we have used it for ours,
and for many years this joint use oc-
casioned no conflict.

a How We Saved theArhoretum Frpm the Multiversltv

But bythe 19 70:5 ,. the University

‘of Washington's concentration had

shifted fromeducating undergraduates
to building the ‘prestige of those re -'
search departments most useful in the
lucrative game of grantsmanship. Its
Department of Forest Resources
(throughwhich the University's share

of Arbo,retum-maintenance funds is
channeled) announced that an undiffe r -
entiated park -arboretum shared by the

general public could no longer serve ‘

its now sophisticated needs. Unless a
long -te rm lease could be negotiated
with the City giving the Univeristy full
control of the land and its use, the right

to build classroom, laboratory, and A

administration structures and parking
facilities there, and to restrict access
by ‘fencing, the University would void
its 1934 agreement. The city's’ admin-
nistration, aghast at the possibility of
its underbudgeted Parks Department
Having suddenly to bear the full cost of

Arboretum operation, was immediately . 

ready to accede to the landgrab.
That was the situation we faced in the
summer of 1972. ‘

Spontaneous lette rs -to -the -editor
in response to newspaper accounts of
the University's proposal served no-
tice on the mayor and the city council

' that no hasty or semi-clande stine give-

away of public land would be tolerated,
and also served to bring into contact
witheach other a small, diverse core
of people to form a citi zens' group, the
Arboretum Park Coalition. (1 was the
“only avowedanarchist among them, but
from its inception the Arboretum Park
Coalition functioned in a non-authori-
tarian manner, being too busy getting
ajobdone to spend time elaborating an
organizational structure. ) It formu -

‘ lated by consensus-a simple 4-point

program: (1) the Arboretum must
remain a .single entity with continued '
combined usage both as a park and as
an arboretum; (2) no abdication of
public controlor restriction of public
use; (3)nofencing; and (4) no extension

of the UW campus into the Arboretum.

Seattle has a loosely federated
network of community councils, each
of which neets more or less regularly
to consider matters of concern to its
community. These councils have
varying degrees of influence at City

~ the City.

Hall; the strong ones are among the
vehicles through which aspiring politi-
cians and bureaucrats move’ up into
city government. The APC took its
program to community council meet-
ings and to environmental groups and
quickly got about 17 such‘ organizations
to affiliate with the Coalition and to
urge its position through lettersiand
presentations to the pity administra-
tion. We got a centerspread article
into Seattle's then alternative news -
paper, the Flag, and smaller articles
in various district weeklies. The Ci-
ty's'two daily newspapers were less
accessible of course,but their readers
could be reached through the letters-
to-the-editor columns. (The trick

here is to havethe letters very well-

written, hard -hitting on a single point,
and brief. Don't try to cover every
aspect of an issue in one letter; write
a different letter for each point, 
different styles, with different--but
iconfirmable; some editors check --
names and address<-:\s. Papers 
print letters contrary to their editorial
policies, if they get enough.‘ of them. )
We called in to radio talkshows. ‘ When
local TV stations editoriali zed in sup-
port of the University's demands, we

asked‘. for and got equal time. When- '

eve rya new community council affiliat -
edwith the APC, we issued apress re-
lease or held a press conference. We
staked‘ out City Hall and the Board of
Regents to, forestall any attempt to
sneak unpublicized agreements through
the city council or the mayor's office.
Our chief goals at this stage of the
campaign were to , escalate public
awareness of the threat and to force an
open prime -time hearing before the
city council.

A hearing date was set for mid-
December. Then ourernphasis shifted
to publicizing the upcoming hearing,
meeting with council members, and
preparing our presentations. The de -
cision reached as a result ofthat hear -
ing was to setup a special Mayor's Ad
Hoc Committee on the Arboretum to
meet regularly until it could formulate
recommendations for terms of a new_
agreementbetween the University and
By then, the APC~.was too
strong to have been denied‘ representa -
tion on that committee, but of course
it was badly outnumbered. So we made
it clear at the outset that since the
composition of the mayor -appointed
committee put the APC's position in a
rninority, we would not accept voting
as aprocedure for reaching decisions.

Thereafter, we really worked our
arses off;that committee was a most
maddening gang of peopleto haggle
with: the head of the city's appointed A
Board of Park Commissioners; pro-
lease, pro-fence coucilman}Bruce
Chapman; two deans from the Univer -
sity; the chairman of the bourgeois
Arboret m Foundation and.the chair-
woman of the alrnost equally bourgeois
Friends of the Arboretum (both inter-
ested in protecting the Arboretum
fromthe black community thatyhas by
now expanded to its borders); the
worried head of the city's inadequately
funded Parks Department and his sym-
pathetic but powerlessassistant (but
she was a useful source of informa-
tion); a conservation-minded indus -.
trialist; and the editor of\ the local
Hearst newspaper, the. Post-Intelli'-
gencer, which usually refers to such
people as "public-spirited citizens".
There were four members of the APC
regularlypresent, onlythree of whom
were officially members of the com-
mittee; Iwas the fourth. But the meet -
ings were covered by thepress, and
press exposure was what we needed.

The committee met weekly around

. abig table inaconference -room of the

’negotiating - ses sions

mayor's suite. His staff was available
to carry omit the committee-‘s between-
' shitwork, but
APC representatives preferred to re —
tain everybit/of their independence by
doing their own. There was a lot of. it.

One of our people on the commit-
tee succumbed to the pressure - -all the
prestigious citizens and professional
expertise were on the other side,.and
she was something of a social-climber
(I§ii_dthe APC was a diverse lot"! )--
and conceded that maybe, after all, a
fence wouldn't be so bad; we ought

to compromise; maybe we could per-

suade the University to build a pretty”
fence, maybe we could persuade the
University to design nice buildings,

3 and to let people go onusing the Arbor -

etum as long as they're carefulabout it
etc.... We'd never bothered much A \
about structure, so we had no mechan— A
ism for expelling her;we just under-

stoodthat as she no longer adheredto

the APC program she could no longer
be considered to represent the APC on
the committee. I moved into, the gap,._
and since I'd been a rather vocal pres -
ence all along and the committee was
n'ot into voting anyway, the re wasn't
much its disappftrovingi chairman (the
Park Board head) could do about that.
When the committee deadlocked in ir-
reconcilable disagreement after about
J

two months- —two months of [valuable
continuous news -media coverage - -it
broke into two small subcommittees,

' eacl/1 charged with submitting to the

mayor its proposalfor future Arbore -

tum management. The proposals were ~

submitted inmid-February,‘ 1973, and
apublic hearing before the Parks and
Public Grounds Committee of the city
council followed in March.

While the three of us on the ma-

yor's committee were fully occupied .

with thatfrustrating task, other mem-
bers of the APC were contacting state

legislators to explore channels through —

which state money could be funneled to

' the Arboretum if the University should

pull out, continuing the letter-writing
campaign, meeting with city council
members, planting articles in envi-
ronmental-group newsletters, raising
funds for _a possible lawsuit (the Ar -
boretum _i__s_ on public-park land, re-

served to park use by the deeds through
which the City acquired it at the turn
of the century), working with the com -
munitypcounc ils and the [political -party

clubs, and pushing the Arboretum,

. everybody was doing what he /she

wanted to do, and since the APC was
a very mixed bag, a lot of different
things were gettingdone. The active

' members of the Coalition were in con-

itinuous interaction, so there was little ll

need or impetus for scheduled meet-
ings. _ V -

ment, in lieu of spoken testimony.

"The University's demand for a fence

around the Arboretum had by then
come to syrnbolize the entire Univer-
