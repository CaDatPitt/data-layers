I The Facts About I amation

 

hag new school term begins with the likelihood that it will mark
the end of the organic division in the student movement.‘ We do not
need to conceal our joy at the fact that amalgamation between the N.
S. L. and the Student L. I; D. will almost certainly take place ates
joint unity convention in December. Nor need we restrain our ap-
proval of the splendid unanimity that reigned at the joint meeting
of the National Executive Committees of the N. S. L. and the Student
L. I. D. which took place on September 14 in New York City.

It was agreed at this meeting that amalgamation would have to
take the form of a new organization: new in program, in approach and
in composition. It was agreed that the most suitable name for the
new organization is the American Student Union. It was also agreed
that it should _be completely independent and unaffiliated to any
other organization. The two national executive comittees are
pledged to work for amalgamation in the intervening months. and it

.418 virtually certain that the basis for amalgamation will be ap-
proved by the membership of both organizations.

or course, these new and heartening developments are the result
of the long and persistent campaign of the N. S. L. in support or
unity, as well as of the very tangible results of our two years of
united front work. ”

Amalgamation was first proposed by the N. S. L. in December,
1956. Although defeated at the Washington convention of the L. I.
D. that Christmas, a decision in favor of a permanent united front
between the N. S. L. and the Student L. I. D. was overwhelmingly
passed. . The united front which had previously been an isolated and
spasmodic phenomenon now became a coordinated national tactic. The
N. S. L. and the Student L. I. D. issued the call for the student
strike in 1934 and witnessed a response far in excess of the com-
bined membership of both organizations. *-'

In 1935 the original united front for the student strike was ex-
tended to include several other organizations. The huge number of
strikers again proved the efficacy of united action. In the mean-
time, the experiences of N. S. L. and Student L. I. D. members work-
ing together in the united front had proven that it is possible for
both groups to work in an amalgamated organization.
the April 12 strike and the splendid united front bemeen the N. S.
L. and the Student L. I. D. convinced many leading L. I. D. members
and chapters of the need for unity.

The First Negotiations

These events had preceded and influenced the deliberation of the
June 29 meeting of the N. E. C. of the Student L. I. D. where it was
unanimously agreed that a basis for unity now existed in the student
movement. A comittee of five was appointed to draw up a schedule
of terms for the Student L. I. D. and to meet with a similar commit-
tee of the N. S. L. .

The schedule of terms drawn up by the committee unfortunately at-
tempted to achieve unification without a full understanding of what
it really‘ meant. This is revealed by considering some of the main
features of the schedule:

1. The amalgamated organization must affiliate to the Interna-

tional Socialist Student Federation. .

2. The ;new -organization must maintain its present affiliation

with the adult L. I. D. ' , '

3. The National Executive Comittee of the new organization must

and two unaffiliated students, '

4. The name of the new organization must be the Student League

for Industrial Democracy. ~

The discussion began with a consideration of the nature of the
new organization. It was here that the most marked agreement bet-
ween the two committees was apparent. Roth committees agreed that
the new organization would be an amalgamated organization in every
sense of the term - a continuation of neither of the present two. It
was recognized that we would make our appeal to the masses of Ameri-
can students, organized and unorganized, in high schools and colleg-
es. We will appeal to the students on.the basis of their imediate
problems and their daily activities. We will include all those who
are willing to fight against war and fascism and against reactionary

‘ manifestations on the campus. At-the same time we will point to ca-
pitalism as the cause of the immediate as well as of the ultimate.

problems of the student body.

The N. S. L. committee believes thatthis basic agreement on pro-
gram was the important essential in achieving amalgamation. We be-
lieved that a good program with a correct approach to the American
student body superceded in importance.most of the technical and or-
ganizational questions which the two committees would have to dis-
cuss. It was in this spirit that we discussed the seemingly prohi-
bitive schedule of terms.

' We found the Student L. I. D. committee reasonable and willing to

compromise on at least some of the organizational questions. When
we pointed out that affiliation to the International Socialist Stu-
dent Federation was tantamount to affiliation to the Second Interna-
tional, this proposal was withdrawn. The committee also agreed that
it would be necessary to have a more democratic National Executive
Committee. The S. L. I. D. was also willing to make a very import-
ant compromise in regard to affiliation to the parent L. I. D. At
present the L. I. D. has the right to pass on and to veto members of
the staff of the Student L. I. D. when the N. S. L. committee in-
sisted that the student organization would have to exercise full and
unmitigated control over its own affairs, the S. L. I. D. committee
agreed but insisted on affiliation.. Finally, the S. L. I. D. com-
mittee insisted that the name of our new organization he the Student
L. I. D. On this last point we found the committee intractable.

It was pointed out to us that the Student L. I. D. has prestige
among college professors and among liberal and conservative students
who are connected with the student Christian movement. The S. L. I.

~D. comittee felt that this influence could be maintained only by
using the old name. It was evident also that the committee feared
that a new name might lead to a split within the ranks of the Stu-
dent L. I. D. and to the consolidation of a student Christian pacif-
ist movement. ‘ Finally we were informed that the Student L. I. D.
is the recipient »of $10,000 a year from the parent L. I. D. _The
comittee .was also convinced that this steady income was essential
for the organization.

I am sure that you can think of all the arguments we gave for a

new name. I will not state all of them now. We pointed out that a-

malgamation means building a new organization, and that it was only»

common sense for a new.organization to have a new name. Moreover,
we should certainly iwant a name with_a wider appeal than the name
fstudent L. I. D. We argued that the name Student L. I. D. is a mis-
’nomer; .that it would not describe the purpose or the character of
our new organization. we also maintained that the name League for
Industrial Democracy is misleading and ambiguous. Surely, we could
not hope to achieve industrial democracy without a complete and tho-
rough change in the entire social set-up. In addition, you may be
quite sure that we proposed several excellent names. We suggested
American Student Union, Student Union of America, National Student
Union, etc. ' —
However, after extended discussion and argument it-was obvious
that the Student L. I. D. committee was adamant on the question of

 

name and- that vthe negotiations would be terminated unless some a-‘wt

greement were reached. At this point the N. S. L. comittee agreed
to accept the name Student L. Is D.
that despite the fact that we were using an old name, we were actu-
ally‘ building a new organization. The N. S. L. committee pointed
‘out that it did not consider the terms agreed upon as ideal neither
for us nor for the interests of the student body. At the same time,
we considered unity so important that we were willing to accept an
undesirable name if that name were the price of unity.‘

It was agreed that both groups would refer the agreement to lead-
ing members and to those chapters that were in session but that no
publicity. could be released until the joint meeting of the National
Executive Committees which was set for September 14.

On the whole, we can say that the response of the N. S. L. to the
proposed basis for amalgamation was overwhelmingly approved bv all
N. S. L. members and chapters during the summer. It was felt that
unity is so important that the compromise of the name was negligible
in comparison with the gains that we would realize as a result of u-

. nity. We can say that the period between the negotiations and the
;joint N. E. 0. meeting served as-a valuable educational period for
large sections of the N. S. L. so that although the basis for unity
was revised, the previous agreement served as an object lesson for
our members
-were willing to go to to achieve it.

%_ » — T The Joint N. E. C. Meeting

‘At the joint September 14 meeting, the previous terms of agree-F

»ment. were‘ gone over in detail. Problems of program were discussed
in detail and thrashed out. when we came to the name and affilia-
tion of our organization, Joseph P. Lash in separate motions pro-
posed that the name of our organization be the American Student Un-
jion and that it be unaffiliated to any other organization except by

,,a* three-quarter vote of the National Executive Committee.

“A serious V

tuttee .will consist of six N; S. L. members, seven L. I. D. members

' ]P\Iow, of. course, we do not consider unity so important»becau%ﬁ&mc'

believe in unity for unity's sakes. We believe that unity isdthe-r

key to the present situation on the American campus. We believe
that it will meet the requireumnts of the student body in terms of
the present line-up of forces in American schools today, in terms of
the tendencies and trends among high school and collewe students.
Any serious consideration of the temper of American students re-
veals the economic crisis as the gulf that divides the student body

of today from ‘that of only a few years ago. We do not need to go.

into the facts about the effects of the depression on college gradu-
ates. We do not need to prove here that the depression has affected
every student in the American schools.

The Attitude of the Student Body

I should like to consider for a moment the changing ideas and at-
titudes of the student body. We can understand the differences that
have. taken place ‘if we go to see any of the current movies about
collegiate life. These movies, purporting to be about the present,
reveal ‘a picture, although an exaggerated and fantastic picture, of
a period that is rapidly vanishing. _The average collegian is repre-
sented as a .wide-trousered, sleek-haired Harold Teen. We see the
college as a country club by day and a night club after hours. Now,
of course, such movies were never more than carricatures. But today
they have no point of contact with reality at all.

The country club_concept of our schools postulates an underlying
sense. of economic security and social smugness beneath the rather
strenuous pleasures of extra-curricular life. Now, it is pecisely
this smugness that has disappeared. The student who is in school
today does not have any feeling of certainty. He is not so certain
that he will step into his father's business after graduation. It
is, very likely that his father's business has failed. He does not
look upon a career at engineering ‘or law as a sure thing. The eco-
nomic wherewithal to support intellectual smugness has disappeared.
American students .today are in a state where they are réexamining
old values. They are questioning old beliefs. They are reading and
thinking. Marxist literature finds an eager welcome among many stu-

'dents. Radical speakers are in great demand.

If we can consider any one attitude as predominant, it would be
only. accurate togsay that this attitude is one of doubt and bewild-
erment. ~ The. social philosophies the student gets in school do not
jibe. with %his daily; experience. His classroom knowledge does not
provide him» in most cases with the information he really wants to
have. His uncertainty is aggravated by the momentary danger of war.
Students think" more than we know about what war will mean to them
and their finely spun plans for the future.

[Tens oft thousands. of students_have found expression for their
discontent and restlessness in the militant student movement, in the
campaigns against war and fascism. At the same time, their partici-

’pation in activity developed their understanding of the world around

them and offered an explanation to the problems of society and of
social change. . ,

The Influence of the Student Movement

.In the brief period of our existence we have been able to reach a
surprisingly large number of students. We have probably made hun-
dreds _of thousands of students sit up and take notice of our activ-
ities., We have been able to form a united front that includes al-
most every important student organization in the country in the Stu-
dent Vigilance Oomittee, formerly the strike committee. we have
been able to swing into action a very significant minority, a minor-
itv of some 185,000 students who went out on strike on nDPi1 1?.

4

 

«am-

 

Our influence is also marked on organizations other than our own
that have been deeply affected by the growing strength of the mili-
tant student movement. The National Student Federation has shown
our influence in its zigzaging course during the past couple of
years. It has passed resolutions condemning the R. O. T. C. At the
same time its leaders have attempted to swing student support behind
the Roosevelt government. Recently it has lent support to the mili-
tant student movement by helping to defeat the reactionary Nunan
Bill in New York. Now it has affiliated to the Student Vigilance
Committee. The N. S. F. A. is not, strictly speaking, an organiza-
tion since it consists merely of affiliated Student Councils and
comes to life as a national organization only in infrequent confer--
ences and through the statements of one or two leaders. But'its be-
lated and confused reactions prove our point.

Particularly encouraging has been the growing militancy of the
students in the various student Christian organizations. The Na-
tional Council of Methodist Youth participated in the April 12
strike. Many local church groups have been part of the united
front. It is now possible that the student Y. M. C. A. and Y. W. C.
A. will affiliate to the Student Vigilance Committee. These in-
stances do no more than illustrate the growing unrest of these reli-
gious students. They, too, are dissatisfied with things as they are
today. They, too, are looking for something to do about it.

Fascist Tendencies

At the same time, it would be a decided mistake to conceal the
fact that the indecision and bewilderment of so many American stu-
dents leaves them open to fascist influence and organization.
This, coupled with the unstable economic base of most students, and
their middle class origin, ought to convince us that the danger of
fascist movements is considerably more serious than we have yet eon-
ceded. There is at least a partial parallel that can be drawn_be-
tween the state of mind of students in the United States and that
which directly preceded the growth of Nazi ideas in the German
schools. None of this is meant to minimize the very great advantag-
es we have because of our more direct approach to the problems of
the student body, and the united front which we have been able to
present. Nevertheless, the danger of the spread of fascism in the
schools is a very real problem. .

Although no national fascist student organization exists as yet,
fascist tendencies‘ in the schools are on the increase. Up to the.
present, the fascist student groups have been held back by the fact
that the fascists in the broader political field have not yet been
able to form a national unified organization. In certain schools,
movement in the schools seems to be largely confined to the upper
class students. They have not yet been able to make any popular
appeal.

The High Schools

In the high schools, the situation is even more dangerous due to
our comparatively weak organization. The high school students have,
of course, been hit harder than the college students by.the crisis
for the simple reason that they are for the most part recruited from

 

the lower strata of the population. Certainly, their attitudes have‘

also been changing. The social and extra-curricular life of high
school students was once largely imitative of their older brothers

V and sisters in college. Today, the high school student is just as

disturbed and worried, even more so, than the college student.
However, a good deal of the resentment of the high school student
has taken independent and unorganized channels. There are frequent
spontaneous strikes in ‘protest against discrimination of various
sorts, or for better lunchroom conditions, or in behalf of a teacher
who has been fired. There is hardly, as yet, in the hiph schools a
national student movement in the same sense that there_is in the
colleges. 5

 

In those high schools where there are large and functioning N. S.

-L. chapters, they have been unable for the.most part, with a couple

of notable exceptions, to get the masses of students to follow them.
This was particularly noticeable in the strike when even in a school
such as New Utrecht High School, where we have a fine and strong
chapter, only a few hundred students went out on strike. For the
most part they leave the large body of the students untouched by
their activity. There is always a group following the N. S. L. Op-
posed to it is a rather large fascist group which exploits ignorance
and rowdyism. The student body as a whole is frequently inactive.
This is explained partly by the fact that we have been rather
slow in adapting ourselves to the special needs and conditions of
the high school students. It is explained by our comparative lack
of attention to the high school problem. Of very great importance
in explaining our weakness in the high schools is the almost com-
plete, absence of a strong united front. Students have not partici-
pated to a greater extent in our activities because they have not
felt part of the movement. They have not felt that the student
movement is »theirs and stands for their interests. It is obvious
that amalgamation will enable us to make a stronger appeal to.the
high school students. It will enable us to reach students who have
yet been inaccessible. It will help supply the united action which

"has been lacking in the high schools.

_ It is obvious, that the conditions for forming a powerful, united
student movement are favorable, but not indefinitely so. We have a
student body that has been hard hit by the crisis. Practically the
entire student body is at least anxious to see whether any immediate
answer can be given to their problems. There is also a very large
group of students that has already participated in militant action
but even this group has not yet been consolidated into organization.
There is, then, an extremely fertile basis for our proposed_American
Student Union, a basis that consists literally of hundreds of thou-
sands of students. '

“At the same t1me_these favorable conditions may be countered in an

very short time by extremely great, if not insuperable, obstacles.
The forces of reaction in the schools are part of the movement of
reaction throughout the country. Not only may we expect that stu-
dent fascist groups will grow, but we have already seen how the ad-
ministrations are turning more to the right and to more undisguised

forms of disciplinary action.‘ They are breaking through old tradi-2

tions in order to expel their students. The U. of Michigan, former-
ly known as a stronghold of liberalism, now has no scruples at all
in expeling four ‘N. S. L. members. We may expect that, unless we
ourselves take vigorous and aggressive action, our.liberties will be
considerably decreased in a very short time.

Nor will war-time prove the ideal time for strengthening the stu-
dent anti-war movement. Of course, this will have to be taken care
of before. And now that war has-already broken out in Africa with
the Italian invasion of Etniopia, we are playing against time. Ei-
ther we will consolidate the splendid anti-war movement that exists
in the schools now, or it may prove too late. -

The point is all too simple.- Unity is ideally suited to the pre-
sent set-up on the campus. But the situation is so dynamic that de-
lay might prove fatal.~ It is for this reason that the N. S. L. has

M been stressing the immediate need for amalgamation.

III Our Approach to the Student Iovement

,course, we will have to understand exactly what kind of organ-

sization we want when we talk about amalgamation.» Our original six

page statement describing the first negotiations with the S. L. I.
D. comittee mentions the fact that both committees are desirous of

_involving new non-N. S. L.-S. L.‘I. D. groups, such as church groups

‘-and local "Y" organizations. One group of N. S. L. members, discus-_

sing the entire matter at a summer camp in Massachusets, came to the
conclusion that our new organization, particularly if it were to in-

 

clude. liberal and pacifist students could certainly not take ‘the»

place of the "old N. S. L." I have no way of knowing how widespread
this fear of amalgamation.is, but certainly the question is inter-
esting and deserves being discussed. 4 ‘ -

The question brings up pretty sharply the problem of exactly what
role the "old" N. S. L. played. And I believe that there is implic-
it in the way in-which the problem is raised the notion that the N.
S. L. was rather an exclusive organization of politically enlight-
ened people which played the role of guiding and directing campus 0-
pinion from aside. Of course, if this were the case, the new organ-
ization will, fortunately, not fulfill this role. But the N. S. L.
was never intended to be and never was an organization of political
sophisticates that supplied guidance to a benighted student body.

We all know, and it is hardly necessary to repeat here, that the

..N. S. L.. was formed in the spring of 1952 because it was necessary

to have a student organization that would react to thexyarious ima-
diate issues of the student~body, and because there was no such or-
ganization in existence. We all know that the N. S._L. was forced
to be a broad, militant organization of the masses of the American
students.

The Shortcomings of the N. S. L.

I think, that we can and should admit that the N. S. L. never be-

came the broad, all-inclusive organization we wanted it to be. It.

never became the student organization on the American campus. It
never became a student union such as it certainly could have become
in a number of schools. ‘

Now, I do not think that this is so because there was anything

_wrong. with our program or with our conception of the student move--

ment. Rather, we must say that the difficulty is that there was al-
ways a discrepancy between our program and our regular campus rou-
tine. at the time that we were actually taking a leading part in
campus struggles and campaigns, we never bothered to build our or-
ganization. We never paid more than lip service to the notion that
building our organization is a crucial question. We must conclude
that our single greatest failure was our failure to really build the

powerful mass student organization we set out to build. This is.re-

flected in the size of our chapters in such schools as City and L.
A. J. C. where we should have been able to have mass N. S. L. chap-
ters. It is also reflected in our comparatively small number of
dues-paying members ’and in the sloppy conduct of the national of-
fice. _

But, of course, we must know why it is that our program was never
put into action in the sense that it did not become the progrmmt!
the organization vfor which it was intended. I think, the answer

lies in the fact that most chapters never really understood the pro- .

gram. Certainly, -we can say that the national office also was not
always guided by a clear-cut conception of our program. Our program
was distorted and “obfuscated in practice in a number of different
we s. .

yPerhaps, the chief of these is the fact that we talked about be-
coming a really broad‘organization but hardly ever made an honest to
goodness attempt‘ to become such or really figured out what it means
to become a ’mass student organization affiliated to no political
party and including students of various political beliefs and affil-

“ 7

 

 

iations. At our chapter meetings, how often did we bother to invite
speakers of various political tendencies? How often did we try to
arrange programs at our meetings that would really interest large

vsections of the student ‘body? I think, we can say pretty safely

that, for the most part, our meetings were devoted to business and
that one has to be made of pretty stern stuff to attend N. S. L.
meetings. They are certainly concerned with rather exclusive sub-
ject matter. ~ _A _

When we go on a splurge and invite outside speakers for a discus-
sion vmeeting, we usually get a comunist speaker. When non-comun-

_ 1st or non-radical students actually make an attempt to attend_our
,meetings and join the N. S._L., they are faced with a stiff proposi-

tion. _They are made to feel out of place. ‘Those of us who know
more make them feel that they have wandered into the wrong meeting.
Our attitude to new members has not.always been to ask whether they

ivbelieve in our program and will participate in our activities. Our

attitude has usually been that of judging our new members on their
point of view toward the world political scene, on their attitude,
say, toward the Soviet Union or trade union problems.

I think, it is apparent to all of us that we have been extremely
sectarian in the dai1y_practice of our organization. Our broad and
far—looking perspective has been something that was reserved for
dress occasions and speeches.

There were many chapters that were extremely afraid of our pro-

igram‘ and did their best to keep it concealed from as many students

 

as possible. There was one chapter that kept underground for months
and months despite the fact that it was rather large. When the na-
tional office sent a representative to Philadelphia, she was hushed
when she mentioned the National Student League at a party. She was
told that it was very indiscreet to mention the N. S. L. at so pub-
lic a_gathering. - '

We have chapters that have feverishly resisted publicity, -that
have done, their best to keep the N. S. L. underground. But, of
course, these cases are the exception. However, most N. S. L. chap-
ters have this fault, if to a more restrained degree. We have all
been a little afraid of the N. S. L. If we have not hushed up its
name, we have hushed up its program. For example, there are whole

sections of the program that have been dead letters, that we have

done nothing about. There are other sections that we have misinter-
preted or distorted. _ .» V

This tendency was marked during the April 12 strike when the slo-
gans on fascism were shoved far into the background even by our own
N. S. L. members on the various strike comittees. This tendency to
hide the N. S. L. or to water down its program and to obscure whole
sections of it does not broaden the organization. To have played
down the fight against fascism, as we did on April 12, weakens and
narrows our organization in the long run.

What the N. S. L. Contributed

Now, I am not saying that we have been a miserable failure. I'am
not saying that we ought to beat our breast is despair.» I am saying
that our major shortcoming is that we have not drawn the masses of
students into our organization. I am saying that our major weakness
has been organization. Our achievements are-very considerable but
they lie elsewhere. ‘

What we succeeded in doing was introducing a totally new point of
view into the student movement. We succeeded in inﬂuencing every
major student organization in the United States. We succeeded in
changing the ‘entire course of the student movement in the United
States. The birth of the N. S. L. undoubtedly'marked the beginning
of a new era in the history of student life and thought in the Unit-
ed States. . ,

Exactly, what was it that we contributed to the student movement
that was new? Let us-examine the ideas and concepts which the N. S.
L. introduced into the student movement:

8

 

1. First among these must be recognized the concept that it was
necessary to have a student organization which would be primarily
devoted to the immediate needs and interests of the student body.

Or wcourse, this concept could not be developed in a vacuum. "It

could not become the basis for a new student organization unless

large sections of the student body were in conflict with their
environment, until the needs of the students and of the school
administrations and trustees became different.

a3 the trained professional became less and less necessary,

and as the schools became less essential for the ruling class,
there begun to develop contradictions,between the student body
and the existing social set-up. This conflict is expressed in
numerous small and seemingly petty issues. The N. S. L. began on
the premise that it would organize students on precisely these
issues of the student body. _ _
2. The N. S. L. pointed out that these issues were reflections of
the basic struggles and conflicts that are going on in society.
A struggle against retrenchment actually means carrying the
fight to the city government and to the bankers who control
the city government. A fight against the R. 01 T. 0. means a
fight against the war department and war preparations. In other
words, we understood from the very beginning the implications of
student struggles. We pointed out that the fight of students a-
gainst a predatory capitalist society should, if it is to be ef-
fective, begin in the schools. .
3. Once we correctly appraised the place of the school in society
and the relation of the student body to the existing social and
economic set-up, it follows that the attitude of the N. S. L. to
the working class was not an external or superficial one. We re-
,cognized that students _must support the working class because
they have interests in comon in the fight against_war and fasc-
ism as well as in daily struggles for free speech and against re-
trenchment. ‘While the community of interests between students
and workers is particularly close for students who are themselves
part of the working class, it also holds for those students of
the middle class who have been disowned by a decaying social or-
der and who face the threat of fascia and war.

4. I think it would be a mistake to separate our fundamental tac-

tics and methods from our underlying programmatic principles. It

was but a natural conclusion from our notion of student activi-
ties that we use the tactics of mass action, of petitions, de-
monstrations, and strikes and mass meetings. For us this_ may
sound like something of a.commonp1ace. But if we think in terms

.of the campus of just a few years ago, we realize that the in-

sistence of the N. S. L. on mass action was really a very star-

tling and new contribution to the student movement. .

5. The united front was for the N. S. L. an integral part of its

tactics and its activities. It was inconceivable for us that any

type of student struggle would be successful without united ac-
tion on the part of as many campus groups as possible. The pro-
posal for unity was a natural outgrowth of our entire conception

of the student movement. .

Now, I believe that the concepts here enumerated constituted a
contribution for the entire student movement. For us they were the
foundation and the cornerstone of our organization. I have already
pointed out that we did not altogether succeed in putting our pro-
gram into practice, but these concepts, utterly alien to most stu-
dnts but a few years ago, are now accepted by larger and larger
sections of the student body;and I think we can say without any sug-
gestion of wish-fulfillment that these ideas which were originally
at the basis of our own organization are now commonly accepted ei-
ther as a whole or in part as the basis of the entire militant stu-
dent movement. Certainly, these ideas will all be incorporated in
the program of the A. S. U.

The point of view of the N. S. L. influenced other student organ-
izations and groups. Particularly, _of course, it influenced the
point of view of the S. L. I. D.

Our Former Differences with the S. L. I. D.
we should examine at this point the differences that once existed

_between the N. S. L. and the Student L. I. D. We all know that at
one time there were many programmatic and ideological differences."

It would be well to r8examine our former differences and see whether
or not they have been resolved and to what extent.
I The most serious criticism the N. S. L. made of the Student L. I.

~D. was that it did not understand the_fundamanl tie-up between the

school and society and between the student and society. we consid-

.ered that this was largely a result of the fact that the Student L.

I. D. was a continuation of a much older organization that had ori-
ginally been formed to meet different purposes, and for the Student
L. I. D. to have kept abreast with the times would hate meant con-
stant rﬂexamination of its former principles. This'reexamination
was not always forthcoming. In addition, the student membership of
the L. I. D.‘ dried up after the war, and in the boom years between
1923 - 1928 it ‘was not primarily a student organization. In 1924,
Norman Thomas reported that there were no more than four or five L.
I. D. chapters in the colleges. - ‘ /

This separation of the school from society was manifested in a
number of different ways in the Student L. I. D. program. Even as
recently as 1954 when the Student L. I. D. issued its first written
declaration of principles, this differentiation is quite marked.
There is an actual separation in the very structure of the program
which permits the campus problems to be considered in many cases
quite apart from their connection with society as a whole. and, of
course, when considered in this way they appear subordinate and un-
important.

For example, the discussion on the R. O. T. C. is considered
quite apart from the discussion on war. It is necessary to point
out that in the discussion on R. O. T. C. there is no mention of its
connection. with the war department and with war preparation. Of
course, this is an omission and may be partly due to carelessness.
But this carelessness sprang out of a fundamental misconception.

Unfortunately, this lack of understanding led to many opportunist

mistakes in tactics. For example, for a long time the Student L. I.‘

D. seemed to consider Dr. Robinson the main source of evil at City
College. There was frequently, because of the lack of understanding
of the fundamental nature of the issues with which we were confront-
ed, a maximum of faith in the efficacy of influential faculty mem-

bers in any particular situation, and a minimum in the ability of-

the student body to get results by the use of its united strength.

I think, it is evident that this lack of clarity on the connec-
tion between campus and off-campus problems would inevitably lead to
a rather distorted version of our relation to the working class. It
would be only natural to miss the basic point that\students could
only support the workers and to feel instead that students could e-
ducate and lead the workers. The L. I. D. would send young Smith
girls in as organizers into clothing shops. College students ar-
ranged chataquas for the workers in West Virginia, teaching classes
in organization and in trade union problems.

. Finally, and this is very important, the N. S. L. and the Student
L. I. D. differed on the connection of the political party to the
student movement. It was the point of view of the L. I. D. for u

‘long time that the different political parties would have to have

student groups on the campus that would carry on the political pro-
paganda of the party and also carry on student activities. For a
ong time, the L. I. D. considered itself as a socialist student or-
gsnisation that also engaged in student activities. Hence, the u-
nited front was possible on Lhese student issues but amalgamation
was impossible since the fundamental purpose and direction of the
two organizations was different. The L. I. D. was thus considered
the Socialist student organization and the N. S. L. - the Communist
student organization; amalnnmation was considered to be simply out
of the question. '

IO

 

  

The only important difference that carried over until quite re-
cently and may still remain to a certain extent will be found in our
positions on the Negro students. In the Student Outlook, George
Streator developed the theory that it is qxortunist to fight against

the dailv discriminations that are visited on Negro students. For
example, it was considered a mistake of the N. S. L. to 1ng1gt on

the right of Negro schools to have a chapter of the Pni Beta Kappa

and on the right of Negroes to participate in athletics. It was
pointed out that football and Phi Beta Kappa are bourgeois institu-
tions and that it‘ would breed illusions if they were admitted to
these activities. ' .

Our position was, of course, that education itself under capital-
lst society is a bourgeois institution. Still, we do not demand to
be excluded from education. We demand, rather, to change the edu-
cational system and to block the teaching of reactionary doctrines.
n8 we fight for the admission of Negroes to Phi Beta Kappa, so we
also right to change the character of Phi Beta Kappa. The depriva-

.tion of the simple rights of Negroes is a part of the entire discri-

mination against Negroes in other fields. only by participating in
the fight against these and other disoriminations can we convince
the Negroes of our sincerity and of the necessity for Joining the
Student Union. . - '

However, at the Joint N. E. C. meeting there seemed to be more
agreement on this point than in the past and it is to be hoped that
the 5. L. I. D. will not insist on the above theory. .

‘The Road To Unity

Now, these differences were dissipated over a period of time.
They did not disappear in a day or two. These differences were dis-
solved in action. Without going into too much detail on the process
that brought the N. S. L. and the Student L. I. D. closer together,
it may be said that participation in student activities convinced
most L. I. D. members of the need for a student organization that
would be concerned with the problems of the student body. They be--
came convinced that these issues were not subordinate to educational
activity but were a prerequisite to any radical education among stu-
dents. They began to understand that organization of students on
the basis of their immediate problems is.the only possible way to
organize the masses of American students and that unless this organ-

ization took place soon, we would be left-without our most powerful»

weapon to meet the offensive or the fascists and the jingoes.

The understanding of this-basic fact will, I think, tend to clear
up confusions previously prevalent among many L. I. D. members.
Many of these differences are in the process of’wearing down through
activity. Certainly, the mistaken and confused notions toward the
working class- have for some time been in the process of disappear-
ing. Particularly encouraging now, although certain differences may
still remain, is the fact that many L. I. D. members and leaders

’have a most wholesome and intelligent attitude toward the problem of.

building the American Student Union and that we find in the Student
L. I. D. a great deal of enthusiasm for the.American Student Union.
While on the road to unity, certain differences appeared within
the Student L. I. D. ‘itself. ~All these differences appeared most
sharply in regard to the key question, amalgamation. ' . ‘
There were those in the Student L. I. D. who were of the opinion
that it was up to the Student L. I. D. to be an out and out_politic-

a1’ organization tied up with the Socialist movement and considering

student issues as definitely subordinate. .

There was, beginning with the time that amalgamation was pro-
posed, a small group within the student L. I. D. that was definitely
in favor of amalgamation. I think it is only accurate, however, to
say that the great majority of the members of the Student L. I. D.
were of the opinion that amalgamation was desirable but impossible
in the realizable future. Although these students still wished the
L. I. D. to be a socialist organization. they were aware of the need

for a broad student organization such as the N. S. L. was picturing.
They wanted amalgamation but felt that this would be difficult until
Comunists and Socialists.had solved their differences in the polit-
ical field. This group was also decidedly distrustful of the ethics
and tactics of communists and made the question of sincerity a big
issue. It may be said parenthetically that the negotiations on a-
malgamation during the summer and the compromises that the N. S. L.
wasblwilling to make to achieve amalgamation helped clear up this
pro em.

It was with this group of students that the April-12 strike

helped clinch the argument.’ The strike drove home forcibly the ef-
fectiveuess, of united action as well as the enormous potential fol-
lowing of our American Student Union. Probably the greatest single
factor that helped us achieve unity was the success of the united
front for the entire period of time in which it was in operation.
another factor that should be mentioned is the N. E. C. of the S. L.
I. D. which not only reflected the rising sentiment of the member-
ship for amalgamation but also showed independent and decisive lead-
ership in the fight for amalgamation. This is certainly true of the
majority of the N. E. C.

Today, i think, we can say that, on the whole, there is une-
nimity on most crucial questions of program. The very act of amal-
gamation signifies a basic\agreement on the role and function of the
student movement.

Will the N. S. L. Be Replaced .

By now, I think that we should be able to discuss the original
question on whether the new organization, the American Student Un-
ion, will take the place of the National Student League or whether
the dissolution of the N. S. L. into a broader organization will not
leave an unfulfilled need in the student movement. -

I mentioned before those ideas which I considered basic in the
program of _the N. S. L. and which, in my opinion, the N. S. L. had
contributed to the student movement as a whole. If_we examine our
proposed amalgamated organization in the light of these ideas, we
will see that it not only performs the functions that the N. S. L.
has performed but will undoubtedly perform them much more effective-
ly. Let us see if this is so by asking ourselves some questions: '

1. will the\American student Union recognize the need for strug-

gling on student issues? This question appears a little ludic-

rous because it was taken for granted at the negotiation during
the summer and at the September meeting of our N. E. C's’ that
this would be the very basis of our organization.

2. will it believe in mass action and militant tactics? Here al-

so our answer can be equally categorical. Its very purpose is to

facilitate student action and to make mass action more effective.

5. will it recognize the relation between the student and socie-

ty? Here no clearer answer is possible than a quotation from the

joint press statement issued by the N. S. L. and the Student L.

I. D.:

"The American Student Union, contemplated by the two com-
mittees, would represent the collective interest of students
in high school and college. It would deal with student needs
arising out of "the inadequacy of the National Youth adminis-
tration, the question of the R. O. T. C., the restraints upon
academic freedom, insufficient educational opportunities and
discrimination against the Negro student. Through action on

these issues and others the new organization would attempt to

bring students to an awareness of the larger issues such as
war 'and fascism and .the need for a new social order which
'would not be productive of war, fascism, insecurity, and radi-

cal antagonism." ~
This program will be our guarantee that the new organization will
be militant and effective. But at this point it ought to be made
clear that militancy does not depend on claritv of program alone.

Militant action is impossible without organized student backing.
The most revolutionary program is meaningless if it is not conceived
in terms of decisive action. It becomes apparent, then, that the

A.S.U. will fulfill the same function in many respects for which the.

N. S. L. was created and do the job immeasurably better.

From this point of view, liberal, pacifist and Christian students
become not a menace to the organization, but the only guarantee that
it will carry out its program. We are thinking in terms of a broad
organization of the masses of students. -The program of such_an or-
ganization will be virtually meaningless unless it actually becomes
a broad mass organization. .

We have nothing to be afraid of in including less militant stu-
dents. Nor are we even particularly interested in seeing that the
program of the A. S. U. contain revolutionary phrases on the over-
throw of capitalism. It should be clear to us that the effective-
ness of the student movement will not be determined by the violence
of our language nor by the care with which we limit our members to
the political elite. Amalgamation, although it will retain the bas-
ic ideas and concepts on which the N. S. L. was founded, will never-
theless be a primarily new organization largely because unity will
attract- new people, because unity will enable us to break with the
exclusiveness of _our background and trun without fear to tens of
thousands of students who are looking for leadership and action.

IV The American Student Union
and Some Organizational Problems

][ believe that it is in order at this meeting to discuss a little
more concretely some of the organizational perspauives we have in

mind when'we talk about amalgamation, and also some of the concrete
steps we will have to take in the near future to guarantee unity.

I have indicated that perhaps the key problem of the militant
student movement has been its inability to organize the masses of
students who have been willing to participate in activity, but who
were unwilling to get tied up organizationally. Now, amalgamation
will not automatically solve this problem for us. It will give us a
key for the solution. It.will make it more simple, with correct
leadership and an intelligent approach to organize tens of thousands
of students who have belonged to neither organization in the past.

When we approach this problem, it is obvious that we must keep in
mind that What We are uim1nV.st is not merely the amulpamation of
N.S.L.and the Student L.I.D. What we are aimimt at is quite well de-
scribed by the name of our new organization, American Student Union.
The very act of amalgamation will attract to our organization
thousands .of students who have stood a little aloof from organized
activity. 88 R Pesult Of the Ornnnic division in the student move-

‘ ment. However, we (must tackle this mutter of "organizing the un-

organized" very consciously, and bepin to solve it now, before amul-
gamation takes place.

The Scope of the A. S. U.

It would be well if we made strenuous efforts to draw in other
groups and individuals into the national amalgamation and into the
_national leadership of the new organization. There ure a number of

“fpucifist groups, small in membership but with considerable follow-
_ing, who should be invited to amalgamate together with us. There
ﬂﬁare' also a number of prominent student leaders, now connected with

other organizations, who should also be invited to participate in
th'e'A. S. U. ' A

13

However,on the individual campus, the problem of involving groups
other than the N. S. L. and the S. L..I. D. becomes much more im-
portant. we can even go so far as-to say that it is one of the de-
cisive problems which we will have to solve in order to make the A.
S. U. a success. ' ‘ ‘ . 4.
, . Throughout the country, there are unaffiliated local groups who
would tie up with the A. S. U. if the matter were explained to them
properly. “In Minnesota, for example, there is a Farmer Labor Club

"that has‘ worked splendidly in the hnited front and has cobpgrate

with the ‘N. S. L. in every way. In Pittsburgh, there is a League
for Social Justice which is quite inﬂuential among liberal students.
Almost everywhere there are Liberal Clubs and Social_Problems Clubs
which could be brought into the A. S. U. . ,

Amalgamation is of significance even where amalgamation is
not a matter of the N. S. L. and the S. L. I. D. merging, because
of the absence of one of the two groups. Take Michigan, for
example. There is a large N. S. L. chapter, and no S. L. I. D;
chapter. But we are reliably informed that there are some two or
three hundred students at Michigan who are on the fringes of the
student movement; It is precisely these students we are interested
in. If we consider the matter carefully, we will see that in no
case is ‘the merger a little family affair between the N. S. L. and
the S. L. I. D. -Even where there may be no S. L. I. D. chapter, it
would be fatal to consider amalgamation a mere change of name for
the name. Name has never been a crucial problem for us. We were
willing, when it appeared necessary, to accept the name Student L.
I. D. And it might be mentioned in passing, that the name National
Student League is not such a bad name, at that.

Reaching Into New Territory

I should like to go even further, and say that amalgamation en-
ables us to organize entire sections of the student body with whom
we have had little-appeal in the past. '

Certainly, if we go at it right, amalgamation should open un the
South to the student Movement. In Chapel Hill, although both the N.

S. L. and the S. L. I. D. have made strenuous efforts, no stable

chapter of either organization has been established. Nevertheless,
,there is a good deal of interest in the anti-war movement. And we
know that there are many students there who are just waitinv for
something like the A. S. U. This situation is characteristic of a
number of schools.

Unity will also help us approach the Negro students who have, for
the most part, not yet lined up with the student movomnnt. We ounht
to approach Negro organizations and fraternities with our proposal
for amalgamation, suggesting that they endorse the A. S. H. and, in
many cases, join with us.

Once the A. S. U. is established, we ought to make substantial
inroads in the graduate schools. Right now, as we all know, the
.student movement is centered largely in the Liberal Arts Colleces.
We w£D.have to make a concerted drive to organize the graduate stud-
ents on the basis of their immediate special problems.

Another weakness of our present organizations that will have to
be renedied is the almost complete lack of attention to the intel-
lectual trends and currents that disturb large sections of the stu-
dent body. We have rebelled a1l_too successfully against previous
Bohemian and intellectualist_traditlons among the students. (here
will have to be a lively intellectual life in the A. S. W., with
plenty of discussion and with healthy divergence of opinion: ale
though we will, of course, expect the organization as a whole to be
as strongly anti-fascist in the field of ideas as in other fields.

I have already mentioned the fact that the A. S. U. will be able
to’ make a strong appeal to the high school students. I should only
like to emphasize now that this can be done only if we are very
careful to make a special approach to the hiuh school stnuvnlu. Re

Two Problems

If we keep these things in mind, we should have little difficul-

ty in solving some of the concrete problems that have already aris--.

en.

Some people have been wondering how we will elect all our future
N. E. C's; whether the N. S. L. and the S. L. I. D. will continue to
be more.or less evenly represented in the leading bodies of the A.S.
U. There has also been a little talk about the role of the N. S. L.
in the new organization. It is, of course, perfectly obvious that it
will have absolutely no role whatsoever. And for a very simple rea-
son. The N. S. L. will not exist after December. The 8. L. I. D.
will not exist. We will all be members of a new organization, and
the old organizational ties will be completely dissolved. The first
N. E. C. has to be apportioned more or less evenly in order to in-
sure that it will be representative. All future N. E. G's will be
elected on the basis of representing the various regions, political
beliefs and religious creeds as fairly and evenly as possible.

Another problem that has arisen is that of imediate local amal-
gamation. The desire to work for the A. S. U. has in some cases de-
veloped into a tendency to attempt to force the S. L. I. D. into im-

‘ mediate amalgamation. There are several reasons why local amalgam-

ation at present would not be helpful. The Student L. I. D. is at
present opposed to it. There is also the obvious advantage of na-
tional amalgamation as the dramatic and widely puhhcised creation of

_ a totally new organization. Finally, this tendency is in“some cases

merely a desire to get a new name for the N. S. L., and to do it

7 right away. This last tendency betrays a complete lack of under-

standing of what we are after.

Our Tasks

Let us now proceed to _a discussion of our immediate tasks in
working for amalgamation and for the American Student Union. There

are at least four tasks that I consider paramount: Building the u-.

nited front, building the N. S. L., making the campaign for amalgam-
ation one of general interest and concern, breaking down the bar-
ries between the N. S. L. and the S. L. I. D.

1. Building the United Front

The almost certain formation of the A. S. U. within the.imediate .

future increases the need for working for the united front. We
should understand ourselves, and point out to the student body that
the tremendous progress the student movement has been making recent-
ly, is due so largely to the growth and development of the united
front. The wide interest that will be aroused by amalgamation is to
be utilized to explain the value and importance of the united front.

The formation of the A. S. U. increases the scope and the possi-
bilities of the united front. If, in forming the A. S. U.,we are
aiming, and in the imediate and realizable future, at least at. the
185,000 students who went out on strike on;April 12th, the united
front should now be conceived of as encompassing the entire campus.
at Smith, every student in the school was represented on the April

12th comittee through elected delegates from the various houses.

‘where the students live. We will have to aim to make this the re-
gular procedure, to involve the entire student body in the united
front in hundreds of schools. We have at present an emergency that
demands this of us, even more than the April 12th strike. In or-
ganizing for the two-hour student mobilization against war on Ar-

 

 

mistice Day, it should be our purpose to form in every school per-
manent united front committees which should be affiliated with the
National Vigilance Colmlttee, and which should also be called Vigil-
ance Committees.

2. Building the National Students League,

In some schools, there seems to be a tendency to slide along
during the remainder of this semester, to let things go, to

gplet the N. S. L. deteriorate and run down. Nothing could be more
“ harmful for the A. S. U. than to permit our N. S. L. chapters to

function loosely, or not at all, during the next few months. Ob-
viously, it will be of no help at all if we come to the A. S. U.
with a poorly organized N. 8. L.

Our decision to make of the A. S. U. the broad~organization of
the American student body should provide us with a lead for our own

N. S. L. work. It is up to us, in the time remaining before amal-L

gumution, to make our own organization as inclusive and broad as
possible. _Qur achievements in building the united front and in
working for amalgamation should be used in this connection.

3. Destroying Obstacles

Finally, we come to the very important task of breaking down the
barriers between the "H. S. L. and the S. L. I. D. This task in-
volves good educational work, both in the N. S. L. and the S. L.I.D.

There are still a number of misconceptions among our own members
that need to be straightened out.A One N. S. L. chapter developed
the idea of sending N. S. L. members into an S. L. I. D. chapter
where there was a little opposition in order to win the members o-
ver. 1 think it would be well for us to realize that the S. L. I. D.
is not strictly similar to the R. 0. T. C., but is rather a friendly
organization with which we have worked quite well. Another idea
that goes the rounds is that our chapters are able to work with the
rank and fi1e'of the S. L. I. D., but not with the leadership. Such
an attitude is sheer nonsense. There is no developed bureaucracy in
the S. L. I. D., either in the chapters or in the national office.
This kind of notion is particularly unnecessary when we consider how
well we have been able to cooperate with the national office of the
S L. I. D. ' ' ‘

In the act of winning over the S. L. I. D. members who are not as
yet for unity, we will also have to win over our own members. ‘We
have to break ourselves of our old habits. We will have to stop
petty quibbling and bickering over whether a demonstration is to
take place on Tuesday or Wednesday, which we sometimes tend to sub-
limate into a theoretical battle of the first rank.

In~ this‘ connection, the discussion over the original terms ac-
cepted by the two committees should prove instructive. It was shown
during these negotiations that the N. S. L, was willing to make sac-
rifices to achieve unity. and I am pleased to say that, as a whole,
those N. S. L. members and chapters who were informed of the terms,
reacted splendidly. They realized that unity was more important

. than accepting the name S. L. I. D. This education must be contin-

ued and spread to our entire membership. Only in this way will we

-be able to break down the barriers that still stand between us and

amalgamation. .
It should be made clear that the road to unity will not be smooth
and without obstacles. although there will be.little outspoken op-

position from the members of the S. L. I. D., there are still 5. L.~

I. D'ers left who have not yet made their peace with the idea of u-
nity. They will probably not argue against it openly. They will not
‘say that they are opposed_to amalgamation. Their opposition will
consist of intellectual sniping. They will make nasty and biting
remarks. They will sneer. They will try to point out that it was
the N. S. L. that originally split the L. I. D., that now we see the
error of our ways, and that we have decided to change our line.

I5 I -

 

-The

.'and the Student L. I. D.

 

In meeting this opposition, we have two alternatives. We can be
equally nasty and biting. We can develop some minor squabble into a
first—rate cat and dog fight. Or, if we wish, we can be calm and
dignified. We can point out the seriousness of unity and of the u-
nited front. We can point out that unity is more important than some

’minor obstacle or argument.

4. Putting Amalgamation Across

I have already spent some time on the problem of keeping the A.
S. U. from being the vested interest of the N. S. L. and the 3. L.
I. D. For this reason, I will discuss the need for involving the

largest number of students in preparatory work only briefly. Ob-
viously, if we wish to involve all sorts of groups in amalgamation
in each school, we cannot wait until the great day rolls around in
order to discuss it with them. H

Already our travelling organizers have reported an amazing amount
of interest in the A. S. U. in "Y" groups and among student leaders.
It would be advisable to form A. S. U. committees representing as
many groups and clubs in the schools as possible in order to make
plans for the formation of the broadest and most representative A.
S. U. in each school. Of course, prominent individuals should also
be invited to participate in such committees. We should have forums
and ,discussions on the meaning and significance of the A. S. U. Let
us make-everybody in the school feel that the A. S. U. is their or-
ganization, and that they have helped shape it.

The object of a good deal of our preparatory work will be the U-
gpity Convention in December which will launch the American Student
‘Union. Although the detailed plans for the convention have still to
prepared by a joint committee, we will make every effort to have

convention much more than a closed affair between the N. S. L.

*this
we have still to work out the basis of re-

presentation, but the purpose of the N. S. L. must clearly be that
of inviting delegates from those unaffiliated groupsnand students
whom we ‘hope to involve in the A. S. U. A narrow and restricted

convention will give us a bad start. A well attended and broad con-
vention will launch the A. S. U. in the right wav.‘

In Conclusion

I believe that
clear and do not need to be emphasized further.

In conclusion, I should like to say that the work we are doing in
forming the American Student Union is of significance_not only to
students, but also to the entire radical and working class movement.
In the student field, the united front hus been definitely shown to
be the .most effective means of fighting war and fascism. We have
seen that Socialists and Communists and non-radical students have
been able to work together without friction and conflict.

We will find during the coming months that the eyes of thou-
'sands of people outside the student movement will be focused on the
progress made toward the formation of the A. S. U. They will want
to see how a united student movement is formed and how it works.

This is but an additional factor to keep in mind while carrying
on our work for the A. S. U. Our work during the coming semester
will have a good deal to do with the outcome of student unity. In
carrying out our daily tasks, w
