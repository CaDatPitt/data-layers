  MAY DAY ANTI-WAR RALLY

May-Day—America’s original Labor Day——the historic day of working-
class struggle since 1886 when American workers in Chicago demon-
strated for the 8-hour day—will see millions of working people all over
the world gathering in great meetings and demonstrations to express
their undaunted determination to achieve peace, security and freedom.

Less than a year after the final military defeat of the Nazi-Fascist-
Japanese axis, Great Britain and the United States, brandishing the
atom bomb, are trying to form a new Anglo-American axis to crush the
democratic forces in Europe and Asia, to encircle the Soviet Union and
to set the stage for a new world war.

Such a policy of preparing for war is inseparable from reaction here
at home. Despite the promises made to the American people during the
last war, the Wall Street monopolists are today trying to push down the
living standards of the American people, to smash the labor unions, to
stimulate violence against the Negroes, and break up the unity of the
people. Iniunctions are used to break up union picket lines. A concerted
attack is made against OPA. Lynch terror and mob violence is organ-
ized against the Negro people. The KKK is re-organized. The promises
made to the veterans are cynically betrayed. All this shows that imperi-
alist foreign policies and reaction at home are Siamese twins.

Demand the re-establishment of Big 3 unity to save the United
Nations!

Show your support of world trade union unity!

Demand the dissolution of the Klan and full protection of the civil
rights of the Negro people!
