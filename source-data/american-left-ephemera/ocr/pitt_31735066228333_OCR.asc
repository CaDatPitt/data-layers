The Successful Battle Against Discrimination

by Linda Jenness

Before the Cuban revolution,
Cuban women suffered the same
indignities that millions of women
throughout Latin America still un-
dergo today. As a predominantly
Catholic country, Cuban women
were not only victims of unjust so-
cial and property relations but of
the stifling moral and chauvinistic
attitudes of Catholicism as well.

I have lived in Mexico, Bolivia,
and Spain and have seen the
repressed status of women in these
societies. I have an idea of what
it must have been like in Cuba
before 1959. To visit Cuba today,
however, is like visiting a fresh,
new world. In 10 short years, and
against tremendous odds, Cuba has
integrated and advanced the devel-
opment of women in the life of Cuba
immeasurably. Before the revolu-
tion, unemployment was rampant,
wages were on a subsistence level
or lower and one-fourth of the pop-
ulation could neither read nor write.
Women played a tiny role in the
labor force and were economically
dependent on the ill-paid, insecure,
and poverty-stricken male popula-
tion. .

Freed of American domination
and with a nationalized economy,
the role of the working class today
is reversed. Instead of chronic un-

employment, there is now more
work to do than hands to do it.
Labor is put to socially construc-
tive use— and this involves the max-
imum participation of women in the
labor force. There is no longer a
need to divide the working class
through racism and chauvinism.
Everyone can work, and everyone
does.

The Cuban government is work-
ing feverishly to establish nurseries
throughout the island. Women can
take their children there from the
time they are 45 days old, and they
are clothed, fed, given medical at-
tention, and educated—all of which
is free!

In addition to the nurseries, feed-
ing facilities are being set up in the
schools and factories. These two
measures are basic necessities which
allow women to participate in the
building of the Cuban economy
while taking the burden of domes-
tic chores off their backs.

An example of the conscious ef-
fort of the government to deinsti-
tutionalize discrimination against
women is its preferential hiring pol-
icy. Any available job that can be
performed by either men or women
must be given to a woman if she
applies. The result of these policies
is that more and more women are

playing leading roles throughout
the island. In the Sierra Maestra
I visited the Hospital of Chivirico,
and the director was a middle-aged,
black woman doctor. The Antonio
Rojas School in the Sierra Maestra
is directed by a 22-year-old woman,
and the staff consists of six wom-
en and four men. The director of
the Moncada Barracks School is
a black woman in her mid-thirties,
and a veterinary hospital on the
Isle of Youth is almost completely
staffed by women. There are female
tractor brigades and women bri-
gades that run calf farms—and the
list goes on.

Perhaps one of the most signi-
ficant new roles that women play
in Cuba is in the Committees to
Defend the Revolution (CDR). These
are voluntary block committees that
perform a multitude of functions.
They are in essence the basic or-
gan of self-government on the local
level, involving the people in each
block in the problems of the com-
munity. The CDR are not armed,
but they patrol their areas and
guard against terrorist acts by coun-
terrevolutionaries.

The militia is a voluntary civilian
army, and large numbers of wom-
en participate. It is based on work
centers and universities, and the
militia units guard their own fac-
tories and universities. It was cer-
tainly a pleasant contrast to the
United States to see black women
students with guns slung over their
shoulders guarding their universi-
ties.

Women may belong to the rebel
army if they choose, but they are
not drafted into it. Military train-
ing in the schools, however, will
be made obligatory for both men
and women next year. Up until

11

now it has been obligatory only
for men. So the Cuban woman is
well integrated into the defense of
her country.

Nearly 50 percent of the students
in the universities are female. (I
can compare this to the University
of Guanajuato in Mexico where I
studied for six months a few years
ago. Out of 5,000 students, only
250 were women!) At the Univer-
sity of Oriente in Santiago women
make up 90 percent of the students
in education, 50 percent in medical
science, and 30 percent in engineer-
ing.

The Cuban woman is also taking
her place in the political life of the
country. Perhaps a graphic example
of the changes taking place is the
fact that while there is only one
woman on the central committee

‘ of the Cuban Communist Party,

over half the members of the Union
of Young Communists (UJC) are
women! Women are accepted poli-
tical spokesmen in many of the vil-
lages I visited, and their numbers
in the UJC clearly indicate that in
the next 10 years this will become
even more common.

The Cuban revolution is still in
transition and so are the processes
going on within it. Although much
progress has been made, complete
equality still does not exist. Mar-
riage and divorce laws have been
changed so that simply by mutual
consent and a very small fee peo-
ple may marry and divorce as they
choose. Abortions are generally
available to women who have had
more than five children (I was told
in one place) or more than two
(I was told in another). I also was
told this restriction is not due to
"moral" considerations, but to a
shortage of doctors; while I am

sure it is not considered a "moral"
question, I had no way of check-
ing on the doctor-shortage explana-
tion, about which I was dubious.
The intrauterine device is available
to any woman desiring it, with the
guarantee that if it doesn't work,
she can have an abortion. (Com-
pare that to the hassle that goes
on in the United States!)

Many women in rural areas are
still reluctant to take advantage of
the nurseries, hospitals and schools
that are now available to them.
Campaigns are carried out by the
Federation of Cuban Women, the
Red Cross and the UJC to educate
and explain the advantages to these
women. No one in Cuba is forced
to take advantage of these facilities!

In many factories the percentage
of women is still low, and chau-
vinistic attitudes still exist in per-
sonal relations.

-Countering this personal chau-
vinism is a very popular movie

named Lucia that I was able to
see while I was there. It is lively
and dynamic with a clear anti—ma1e-
chauvinist theme. It has created
much discussion and controversy
in Cuba. The movie ends with the
present-day Cuban woman fighting
back and holding her own and the
next generation of women looking
on and laughing. The movie is an
indication that no one claims male
chauvinism has been completely
done away with—yet.

The important thing is that real
progress has been made that can
be seen and felt everywhere in Cuba.
A conscious effort is still being made
to have women take their rightful
place in society, and any resistance
to this process is fought. Male chau-
vinism has been deinstitutionalized.
In the new Cuban society, where
the economic need for racism and
chauvinism no longer exists, they
can be effectively fought and even-
tually conquered.

 

 

"Lucia": An Attack on Mole Chauvinism

by Linda Jenness

Lucia is a very popular movie being
shown in Cuba which has aroused
much discussion and controversy.
The Cuban Revolution, in ten short
years, has surged far ahead of all
the other Latin American countries in
terms of freeing women from the sti-
fling traditions, the economic de-
pendence, and the incredible false
morality under which they suffer. The
Cuban Revolution has made a con-
scious effort to help women gain their
independence and assume their right-
ful position in Cuban society. Lucia
is an example of that effort. It is one
of the few full-length movies made in
Cuba and its direct thrust against
male chauvinism comes through in a
clear, active, and revolutionary way.

The movie consists of three separate
parts whose centralfigures are women
in different periods of the revolution-
ary struggle in Cuba. Each part cen-
ters around the role of the woman
within her society and within the rev-
olutionary struggle and expresses her
oppression, her frustrations, and her
struggle for freedom.

Lucia in 1868, during the Cuban
struggle for independence from Spain,
comes from an upper-class family and
is fairly typical ofwomen in her society
during that period. She leads an inane
life of tea parties, sewing, frilly clothes,
silly games, church-going, and gos-
sip. Completely caught up in repres-
sive moral rules and games, the false-
ness and absurdities of her life are

dramatized and emphasized to the
point of ridiculousness. Lucia is not
politically aware, although she loves
and is loyal to her brother who is
hidden in the country fighting the
Spaniards.

Lucia is courted by a refined Span-
ish gentleman who claims indifference
to the war. The courtship follows the
proper rules of always being accom-
panied by her mother, being escorted

' , in grand ﬂurry to church, being teased

and gossiped about by the other wom-
en. Lucia is euphoric until the most
dreadful of things happens —it is dis-
covered that the Spanish gentleman
has a wife in Spain! Lucia is crushed,
shamed, her life is ruined. She stays
in bed for days crying endlessly and
wishing only to die. Throughout the
rest of the sequence she wears only
black.

But Lucia rebels. In a torturously
melodramatic scene we see Lucia
struggle with her tradition, religion,
and oppression to become the Span-
iard's lover and run away with him.

As she is leaving town to meet he!‘
lover she is accosted by the village
mad-woman who represents the indig-
nation and oppression of the poorest
classes of Cuban society. The mad-
woman vents her rage with bursts of
anger toward Spanish troops and hys-
terical screams of wild predictions
and fury. The woman begs Lucia not
to leave, not to trust the Spaniard,
and predicts her doom.

14

Lucia travels on horseback with the
Spaniard to her brother's hide-out
where the Spaniard betrays her. He
has used her to lead the Spanish
troops to the hide-out and throws her
from the horse and rides away. Lucia
is alone, confused, and panicked dur-
ing the long battle between the Cubans
and the Spaniards. She finds her
brother killed and her confusion and
panic turn into a determined hatred
and anger. She walks for days back
to the town where she sees her lover,
dressed in a Spanish uniform, chatting
with other officers in the square. She
stabs him to death.

The first sequence ends with Lucia
being dragged away while the mad-
woman strokes her face and comforts
her with tears streaming down both
their faces.

Lucia in 1933, during the struggle
to topple the Machado dictatorship,
comes from a middle-class family. She
is a gentle, willowy girl who falls in
love with a young revolutionary and
leaves family and school to live with

him. Unlike the Lucia of 1868, she
directly participates in the revolution-

ary struggle along with other women.
She tries to build support for the move-
ment against Machado in the tobacco
factory where she works, she partici-
pates in demonstrations; but her role
is secondary and she spends endless
hours waiting and worrying.

The Machado dictatorship is over-
thrown in 1933 and is replaced by
Batista. Lucia andthe group ofyoung
revolutionaries are happy and con-
sider their job done. The young men
are rewarded with good jobs and one
by one become caught up in the bu-
reaucracy and decadence that con-

- tinues. Only Lucia's companion pain-

fully becomes aware that just the faces
at the top have changed. That the rot-
teness remains. His happiness turns
into frustration and despair as he
realizes that this is not whatthey have

struggled for, and that the struggle
has to continue. Lucia, motivated by
love and loyalty for her companion,
agrees to continue the revolutionary
struggle with him.

The young manjoins another group
of revolutionaries and after attacking
and killing some members of the gov-
ernment he is killed in a battle with
the cops. Lucia is leftalone, pregnant,
confused, and with no place to go.

The second sequence ends with
Lucia walking hopelessly back and
forth by a bridge, carrying her suit-

case.
Lucia in the 1960 s, duringthe hard

struggle to build a socialist Cuba
today, is a healthy, vivacious, black
woman who lives and works in the
country. The tone ofthethird sequence
is fast, funny, and contemporary.
She falls in love with a young white
farm worker who drives a truck and
they carry on a carefree, uninhibited
romance and get married. Some of
the old women in the village gossip
about the quick marriage and the fact
that they seem to hibernate in the
house since their marriage—but this
is laughed at by the audience.
Shortly after their marriage the
young man's jealousy is aroused
when Lucia dances with another man
at a wedding. A hilarious scene follows
where he actually looks Lucia into the
house. He nails up the windows, bolts
the doors, forbids her to leave under
any circumstances or to receive any
visitors. Lucia is forbidden to work
in the fields with the other women and
is left to brood and be bored athome,
completely dependent on his coming
home for her company and happiness.
A few times she begs to be allowed to
go visit her mother but her protests
go no further than that and are to no
avail. In the meantime the young man
is completely happy and cocky. He
works all day, flirts with the other

girls in the ﬁeld, and participates in
the political and social life of the
village.

The literacy campaign in the early
1960 s took thousands of young peo-
ple into the countryside to teach the
people in the country to read and
write and to help them with their work.
A team is sent to Lucia's village and
the entire village is bursting with
excitement and pride and warmly re-
ceives the youth. Lucia's husband,
however, is far from happy when a
quiet, gentle boy of about 14 shows
up on his doorstep to teach Lucia to
read and write. He protests bitterly
to the leaders of the village that the
boy simply can not live in his house,
but the villagers insist and the young
man stays.

The young boy meekly takes in the
whole situation and after constantly

being subjected to outbursts of jeal- _

ousy by Lucia's husband and seeing
Lucia continually locked and bolted
in her house his anger is aroused.
They are never left alone but whenever
possible he tries to tell Lucia that she
doesn't have to live like a slave, that
she should leave her husband and get
out while she can. Lucia is confused
and doesn't know what to do.

One night, in a fit of jealousy, the
husband hits the young man and
stomps out of the house. Lucia leaves
and goes to one of the woman leaders
in the village and explains in tears
that she loves her husband but can
not stand to live that way and she
doesn't know what to do. The woman
says that it's really very simple-
Lucia should stay with her and go to
work in the morning with the rest of

15

the women. And Lucia does just that.
Coming home drunk early thatmorn-
ing the husband ﬁnds Lucia gone and
a note in newly learned handwriting
which says "I am not a slave."

He finds Lucia in the ﬁeld and tries
to take her back home but the other
women, in the most delightful scene
of the movie, tackle him, hold him
down, and refuse to lethim take Lucia
back.

They live separately for a time but
they are both miserable. The husband
drinks and Lucia is lonely and de-
pressed. Lucia decides to return to
him and finds him on the beach. She
explains that she can not stand to
live away from him, but neither can
she live like a slave, that she wants
to return but she must be allowed to
work and be a human being. He is
overjoyed that she has returned but
furious that she refuses to obey him -
and the ﬁght starts all over again.
But this time Lucia is holding her own
and fighting back and a rollicking
chase and struggle ensue.

The Cuban Revolution is still in
process and the struggles within the
revolution are still in process, includ-
ing the struggle against male chauvin-
ism. Lucia has not won but she is
fighting, gaining strength and sup-
port, and, like the Cuban Revolution,
she will win.

A little girl is watching the scene
from a distance with bewilderment
and concern. As she slowly figures
out what is going on her concern
turns to amusement and then to laugh-
ter. The third sequence of the film
ends with Lucia fighting back andthe
next generation of Cuban women
laughing.

The New Role for Women in Cuban Society

by Fidel Castro

(From the May Day Speech)

If there’s something that really
catches one’s attention in these
May Day parades, and especially
in this one’, it is the process of in-
tegration of women into the labor
force.

In the past the possibilities of
Work for women were extremely
limited. In this sense, discrimina-
tion certainly existed. But aside

,from this, it was logical that in a

country where there were hund-

reds of thousands of men without '

work there would be little or no
work opportunities for women.

We already know what kind of
work was reserved for women in
the capitalist society. We know
how prevalent was the custom
among the bourgeoisie of hiring
working class women, pressed by
necessity, to work in amusements
in bars, as just one more kind of
commercial attraction.

We know of the considerable
numbers of women in our country
who were forced into that most
lamentable form of survival that
is prostitution. We know that our
bourgeoisie had established many
brothels in this country: brothels
in every Cuban city, brothels for
the Yankee tourists, for the Yan-
kee Marines, in Havana, in Guan-
tanamo.

We know also that the bour-
geoisie of the region of Guantana-
mo were so ingratiating that they
not only supplied the Marines with

brothels but also, on many occa-
sions, with their own daughters.
In Guantanamo many stories are
known about all this and about
the parties that went on at the
naval base.

Many of those people sent their
daughters to those parties. In any
event, it can be concluded that
this type of work is one of the
types that capitalist society — all
capitalist societies —-— reserves for
women.

It was not possible, of course,
to eradicate this evil from our
country in one day. But we can
say with pride and With satisfac-
tion that just as the Revolution
has eradicated other vices, such
as gambling, for example, just as
the Revolution has rid the coun-
try of beggars, just as there are
no longer poverty-stricken chil-
dren roaming the streets (and
there is no capitalist society in
which there are no beggars, home-
less children, brothels, gambling,
vice and corruption of all kinds),
the Revolution has also eradicated

practically all prostitution from
our country.

Today a tremendous number of
dignified and decent activities are
accessible to Cuban women.

Many thousands of Cuban wo-
men have gone into public health
Work during these years of the
Revolution. Many thousands of
young women have become nurses
and nurses’ aides, assistants in the

 

field of medicine in general. Thou-
sands of women work in the schol-
arship students’ centers.

Other thousands of women, tens
of thousands, are teaching. Today
the number of women who go into
technological institutes and tech-
nical training centers is incom-
parably greater. The fact that the
number of women studying in the
school of medicine almost equals
the number of men, will serve to
illustrate the idea.

Thousands of women are work-
ing in day nurseries and thousands
are working not only in these pub-
lic service jobs, but also in the
production of material goods.

Women are working, for ex-
ample, in the planting of seed-
lings in tree nurseries, or planting
coffee seedlings.

The whole poultry plan of four
million — now we have somewhat
over four million laying hens, and
by the end of this year we will
have 5,800,000 hens in order to
cover our needs all year round —
this entire important branch of
our nation’s food production is
manned by women workers. Hund-
reds of poultry centers are man-
aged by women.

Women have joined agricultural
production in other activities, such
as vegetable production, the rais-
ing of calves, and rabbit breeding.
In sum, new job opportunities are
constantly opening up, in which
an extraordinary number of wo-
men have found decent, remunera-
tive and satisfying employment.

Because that was the agonizing
worry of _the immense majority of
our people. How to get a job? How
to earn a living? It is really in-
credible how men suffer in capi-
talist society over this vital ques-
tion, this elemental matter of how
to assure oneself of a job in order
to earn a decent living.

Therefore, on a day like today,
this phenomenon of which I am

 

speaking can be understood direct-
ly as we see the composition of
our labor force. But there is some-
thing more: The women of our
country are not only entering pro-
duction work en masse, but are
turning out to be workers of high
efficiency, and we have heard
many commentaries in praise of
the work of our women, their
sense of responsibility and their
lack of absenteeism.

For this reason the Revolution
is making efforts to create more
day nurseries, more schools, to
establish more school cafeterias,
to make it constantly easier for
women to work. But when we
speak of making it easier for wo-
men to work in production, this
does not mean simply that society
wishes to help women, not only
that.

Society has a duty to help wom-
en, but at the same time society
helps itself considerably by help-
ing women because it means more
and more hands joining in the
production of goods and services
for all the people.

As it is known, one of the means
to make it possible for women to
work is the creation of day nurse-
ries. The women workers them-
selves pay certain amounts, in ac-
cordance with their income, for
their children’s care in the nurse
ries. But the women who have en-
tered agricultural production have
the added benefit that they do not
have to pay for the day nursery.

And it is the intention of the
revolutionary government that by
the end of this year, that is to
say by next year, no woman work-
er will have to pay for her chil-
dren's day nursery. We believe
that this will contribute in en-
couraging Cuban women to work,
and we also believe that this is
just. Society profits from the work
of every woman,

 

 

Women's Liberation:

"The Revolution Within 0 Revolution"

by FideI\Castro

(From the Santa Clara Speech)

Arriving here this evening, I
commented to a comrade that this
phenomenon of women’s participa-
tion in the Revolution was a revo-
lution within a Revolution. And
if we were asked what the most
revolutionary thing is that the
Revolution is doing, we would an-
swer that it is precisely this — the
revolution that is occurring among
the women of our country!

If we were asked what things
in the Revolution have been most
instructive for us, we would an-
swer that one of the most interest-
ing lessons for revolutionaries is
that being offered by our women.

You all know perfectly well
that, in saying this, we are not
uttering given words with intent
to please the compaﬁeras who are
here tonight, but that we say it
because it is what we firmly be-
lieve and feel.

But why is this one of the most
interesting lessons? You your-
selves may ask why. In reality,
the most honest answer that we
could give — and I assure you
that the person who offers this
answer is precisely one who has
always believed himself free from
prejudice — the answer is, I be-
lieve, that in reality all of us were
prejudiced in regard to women.

And if anyone had ever asked
me if I considered myself preju-
diced in regard to women, I would
have said absolutely not, because

I believed myself to be quite the
opposite. I believed that an enorm-
ous potential force and extraordi-
nary human resources for the
Revolution existed in our women.

But what has happened? What
has occurred, or rather, what is
occurring? We are finding that, in
reality, this potential force is su-
perior to anything that the most
optimistic of us ever dreamed of.
We say that perhaps at heart, un-
consciously, something of_ bias or
underestimation existed.

For events are demonstrating,
even now, the possibilities of wom-
en and the role that women can
play in a revolutionary process in
which society is liberating itself,
above all, from exploitation, and
from prejudices and a whole series
of circumstances in which women
were doubly exploited, doubly
humiliated.

What have we found, for ex-
ample, in regard to the work of
women? I have been talking with
several comrades and, following
my visit to the Banao Plan, I told
Comrade Milién: “I have the im-
pression that the women working
in this Plan are more responsible
and more disciplined than the
men. I have the impression that
they will dedicate themselves to
the work with more enthusiasm,
more passion, more dedication.”

And Milién — although I cer-
tainly don’t want to give this
comrade a bad name with the

 

6

women of Las Villas — argued
with me, “Well, but . . . really...
the case of the young men who are
in the Juragué Plan of the Young
Communists . . .”

I told him that finding a spirit
of discipline and enthusiasm, for
work in a program involving se-
lected Young Communists was not
as extraordinary as finding the
same spirit of discipline and en-
thusiasm in a program carried out
by women who had not been spe-
cially chosen for this program,
who had not been chosen by any
organization, but had simply vol-
unteered to do this work.

What have we found? What is
being found everywhere in this
revolutionary program, as far as
the Cuban women are concerned?
Well, we are finding a whole series
of things such as those I men-
tioned before: a great sense of
responsibility, great seriousness,
great discipline and enthusiasm.

What have we found right here
in the province of Las Villas?
Well, let us take the Banao Plan,
for example. This program was
growing and needed a cadre. Com-
rade Milién sought a cadre from
the Party; Comrade Santiago
Acosta, from the Santo Domingo
zone, I believe, and sent him to
the Banao Plan as administrator.

But one day, Comrades Santiago
Acosta and Rena Acosta — the
specialist on technical matters —
had to go abroad. They were the
men holding the positions of
greatest responsibility in the plan.
Someone had to be appointed to
take their place and we decided
to appoint Comrade Osoria, who
was representing the. Federation
of Cuban Women on the directing
board of the plan.

We firmly believe that this even
may some day have historic sig-
nificance. for it was the first time

that a woman had been assigned
to such a task, not for political
reasons or to impress anyone, but
simply because she had, objective-
ly speaking, proved herself ca-
pable of heading such a program.

And from that moment on, we
thought it would be reasonable
and an excellent thing, indeed, to
have a woman directing a plan
involving thousands of women
workers.

Moreover, when it became ne-
cessary to organize the work bri-
gades, a number of women who
had distinguished themselves for
their great spirit of work were
chosen as brigade leaders.

This gave us an idea:

We had to train a group of tech-
nicians for this type of work and,
at first, 10 comrades from the
Technological Institute had been
sent here to specialize in this
branch of agriculture. We decided
that 20 additional students who
were to be sent here to specialize
in this field should be chosen from
among the girl students at the
Technological Institute.

Thus, the workers, the brigade
leaders, and the technicians —
that is, the technical and admini-
strative staff —— is going to be
made up almost entirely of wom-
en. Yes, women!

This is one of the great lessons
we spoke about before: one of
the great lessons and perhaps one
of the greatest victories over pre-
judices that have existed, not for
decades or centuries, but for thou-
sands of years. We refer to the
belief that all a woman could do
was wash dishes, wash and iron
clothes, cook, keep house, and
bear children, age-old prejudices,
that placed women in an inferior
position in society. In effect, she
did not have a productive place in
society.

Such prejudices are thousands

 

 

of years old and have survived
through various social systems. If
we consider capitalism, women —
that is, lower-class women — were
doubly exploited or doubly humi-
liated. A poor woman, part of the
working class or of a working-
class family, was exploited simp-
ly because she was poor, because
she was a member of the working
class.

But in addition, although she
was a woman of the working class,
even her own class looked down
on and underrated her. Not only
was she underestimated, exploited
and looked down upon by the ex-
ploiting classes but, even within
her own class, she was the object
of numerous prejudices.

So all these events have been a
great lesson to all of us, to every
revolutionary. Naturally, a con-

siderable amount of prejudice still_

persists. If women were to believe
that they have totally .fulfilled
their role as revolutionaries in so-
ciety, they would be making a
mistake. It seems to us that wom-
en must still fight and exert great
efforts to attain the place that
they should really hold in society.

If women in our country were
doubly exploited, doubly humi-
liated in the past; then this simply
means that women in a social rev-
olution should be doubly revolu-
tionary.

And perhaps this is the explana- C

tion, or at least the social .basis
for the resolute, enthusiastic, firm
and loyal support given by Cuban

‘women to this Revolution.

This Revolution has really been
two revolutions for women; it has
meant a double liberation as part
of the exploited sector of the
country, and, second, as women,
who were discriminated not only
as workers but also as women, in
that society of exploitation.

The attitude of Cuban women

7

toward the Revolution corresponds
to this reality; it corresponds to
what the Revolution has meant to
them.

And the support of the popular
masses for the Revolution is di-

rectly proportionate t.o what the

.revolution has meant to them in

terms of their liberation.

There‘ are two sectors in this
country, two sectors of society
which, aside from economic rea-
sons, have had other motives for
sympathizing and feeling enthu-
siasm for the Revolution. These
two sectors are the Negro popula-
tion of Cuba and the female popu-
lation.

I suppose you recall that in Cu-
ba’s old bourgeois Constitution,
there was an article which de-
clared illegal any discrimination
for reasons of race or sex, Now
the problem of such discrimina-
tion has disappeared from our
country, because the basis for
these two types of discrimination
which is, quite simply the exploit-
ation of man by man, has disap-
peared.

Much news reaches us from the
United States, for example, about
the civil-rights struggle for Ne-
groes. Nevertheless, racial discri-
mination in the United States will
not disappear until capitalist so-
ciety has disappeared.

That is, discrimination will ne-
ver be wiped out within the frame-
work of capitalist society. Discri-
mination with respect to race and
sex can only be wiped out through
a socialist revolution, which eradi-
cates the exploitation of man by
man.

Now, does the disappearance of
the exploitation of man by man
mean that all the conditions are
immediately created whereby
woman may elevate her position
in society? No. The conditions for

the liberation of women, for the
full development of women in so-
ciety, for an authentic equality of
rights, or for authentic equality
of women with men in society,
require a material base; they re-
quire the material foundations of
economic and social development.

I described before the opinion
held by many men concerning the
functions of women, and I said
that among the functions consi-
dered to belong to women was —
almost exclusively — that of hav-
ing children, Naturally, reproduc-
tion is one of the most important
of women’s functions in human
society, in any kind of human so-
ciety.

But it is precisely this function,
relegated by nature to women,
which has enslaved them to a
series of chores within the home.

There is a sign here in front
of us, for example, which says,
“One million Women working in
production by 1970.” Unfortunate-
ly, it will not be possible to have
one million working in production
by 1970. We feel that this goal
may be reached, perhaps, within
10 years but not within four.

We could propose it as a goal
to be reached by 1975. Why can’t
this goal be reached in four years?
Because in order to have one mil-
lion women working in produc-
tion, we must" have thousands of
children’s day nurseries, thousands
of primary boarding schools, thou-
sands of school dining halls, thou-
sands of workers’ dining halls,
thousands of centers of social serv-
ices of this type must be set up,
because if not, who is going to
cook for the second- or third- grade
child when he comes home for
lunch? ’

Who is going to care for un-
weaned infants, or babies of two,
three and four years of age? Who
is going to prepare dinner for the

 

man when he comes home from
work? Who is going to wash,
clean, all of those things?

In other words, in order to reach
the social goal of liberating wom-
an from all these activities that
enslave her and impede her from
full incorporation into work out-

side the home and all these ac-,

tivities she can engage in society,
it is necessary to create the ne-
cessary material base, to attain the
necessary social development.

It is impossible to construct the
required thousands of children’s
day nurseries, school dining halls,
laundries, workers’ dining halls,
boarding schools, in four years. In
lact, merely to meet present needs,
great effort is necessary on all
fronts.

Everywhere women are working
it has been necessary to make a
special effort to establish day
nurseries, set up boarding schools
and all of the necessary institu-
tions so that these women could
be free to work . . .

At this stage, of scarcity of ce-
ment, machinery and construction
equipment, the problem can be
solved only through maximum ef-
forts on all fronts: sometimes at
a regional level, other times at a
provincial or national level, using
the resources we have at hand.

Nor can we expect that the day
nurseries be perfect, that the con-
structions be perfect, nor the serv-
ice. They must be as good as pos-
sible, but they cannot be perfect.

These problems will have to be
solved in many areas of the coun-
try, little by little. One million
women cannot be employed in one
day. A whole series of economic
steps must be taken, and agricul-
tural plans set in motion.

It would be interesting to know
how many women have already
started to work in the production
of consumer’s goods -as well as in

 

 

services since the triumph of the
Revolution, how many are work-
ing as nurses’ aides, technicians, in-
dustrial and agricultural workers.
If a statistical study were made
as to how many women have be-
gun to work since the triumph of
the Revolution, the number would
probably be close to 150,000, and
certainly no less than that!

This figure, of course, is not
based on exact statistics, and it
seems to us that a study should
be made in order to learn precise-
ly how many women have found
work in newly created jobs, in
jobs created by the Revolution.

Next year the number of women
working will be considerably
greater. Why? Because a whole
series of plans will get underway,
mainly in agriculture. Several
thousand women are to be incor-
porated into the Banao Plan and
when that plan reaches its maxi-
mum development, it will require
six or seven thousand women.

In Pinares de Mayari, some
eight thousand women will be
Working by springtime. In the cof-
fee—-plant nurseries set up for the
1967-68 coffee-growing plan, 30,000
women will be needed and many
thousands will work in the refor-
estation plans, in vegetable cultiva-
tion, and other thousands are being

9

incorporated into jobs in the cities.

This means that more than
50,000 women will be involved in
tasks related to production by
next year, and this will require
an enormous and simultaneous
effort to be made so that all of
the problems related to dining
halls, schools, and children’s day
nurseries may be worked out.

I am going to tell you some-
thing. Without the incorporation of
women, the Banao Plan could ne-
ver have gotten off the ground,
nor could the plans for micro-
climate vegetable cultivation in
Oriente Province have been car-
ried out. Without the incorporation
of women, the plans for coffee
growing could not even have been
considered.

_ Many of the plans that the Rev-
olution is today drawing up and
beginning to carry out could not
have been conceived until the
great reservoir of human resources
that our society possesses in its
women was clearly seen for what
it was.

These plans, which stand for ex-
traordinary contributions to the
economic development of our
country, to the increased well-
being of our people, could not have
been conceived without the mass
incorporation of women into work.
