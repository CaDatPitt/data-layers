N THEIR report, our fascist “scholars” gave as proof of

Italian racial purity the fact that “the overwhelming ma-
jority of the forty-four million Italians of today are descended
from families that have lived in Italy for at least a thousand
years.” According to their own theory then, the Italian Jews
are certainly pure Italians, for if these "scholars” were not as
ignorant of their history as they are of their science, they
would remember that what distinguishes Italian Jewry from
others is its remarkable antiquity. Jews first arrived in Rome
in the second century B. C., at the time of the Maccabees.
Following our scholars’ theory, two thousand years of resi-
dence in Italy should make the Jew: Italians of double purity.

During the last decades of the second century B. C., after
the war between the Hasmonean brothers and Caesar and
Pompey, the Jewish community in Rome grew very rapidly.
In the time of Cicero, in the first century B. C., the Jews iden-
tiﬁed themselves with Roman. politics and exerted no small
inﬂuence at public meetings. (Cicero, Pro- Flacco, Chap-
ter LXVI.)

The Roman Jews rendered valuable assistance to Caesar in
his war against Pompey, and Caesar showed his gratitude by
permitting Jews to hold Pliblic devotional exercises, otherwise
not allowed in the city. The number of Jews in Rome at the
time of Herod was 50,000. Synagogues existed in Rome as
early as the time of Augustus, as is evidenced by a law declar-
ing their inviolability. The Jews were further favored in con-
nection with the distribution of grain, for when the appor-

tionment occurred on the Sabbath, their share was reserved for t

them until the following day.

Many Roman Jews who had becom-e Christians received the
Apostle Paul in Puteoli and Rome with due formalities. (61
A. D.) Among the prominent Jews resident in Rome in the
times of the Emperors Vespasian and Titus, besides Josephus,

' I0

 

 

 

were the families of the De Rossi, the De Piatelli, the De
Pomi and the Degli Adolescentoli, brought captive to Rome
by Titus, all of whom were descendants of princely families
in Jerusalem.

In the‘ darkness of the Middle Ages, Italy produced great
Jewish scholars, physicians and rabbis. Pope Boniface IX
would have none‘ but Jews as his body-physicians. During the
Renaissance, the revival of learning and interest in the studies
of ancient Greece and Rome stimulated the study of Biblical
literature. Such men as Pico della Mirandola, the humanist,
and the Cardinals Aegidius da Viterbo and Domenico Gri-
mani devoted themselves to the study of Hebrew and Hebrew
literature. They were disciples of the Italian Jewish philos-
opher, Elijah Delmedigo, from whom they learned the He-
brew language and under whose guidance they studied phi-
losophy. Under the stimulus of the revival in learning during
the Renaissance, Michelangelo created the superb statues of
Moses and David and the grandiose paintings of the Hebrew
prophets in the Sistine Chapel.

Unlike others, Italian Jewish history is not written in let-
ters of blood. The Jewish victims of the Spanish Inquisition
found sanctuary in Italy. From such a refugee was descended
one of the grandparents of Irene Coen Lazatti, mother of

Mayor LaGuardia of New York City.

In the struggle for Italian unity and independence during
the period of the Risorgimento, Italian Jews were devoted
followers of Mazzini and Garibaldi, sacriﬁcing life and prop-
erty in the memorable campaigns of 1859, 1866 and 1870.

One of the first blows against foreign tyranny for Italian
freedom was struck by an Italian Jew, Daniele Manin, a
disciple of Mazzini. In Venice, in March, 1848, Manin led
successfully a revolt against Austrian rule. A Venetian Repub-
lie was proclaimed and Manin made president.

11

Two of Manin’s best aides in the revolt were both Italian
Jews: Admiral Graziani and Isaac Pesaro Maurogonato, the
J Minister of Finance. Although Manin and the Republic were
1  defeated six months later, he gave Austria the most serious
‘  ch-ecl< she had as yet received from the Italians, and by so €
e  doing helped the Risorgimento on its way. The conduct of the 
J  Venetian people during_ the siege was so glorious, and the
l 9 record of their leader so heroic, that Manin became a l-egendary

ﬁgure in Italian history. A grateful Italy gave him a final
resting place in the outer wall of San Marco, under St. Marl<’s
lion that he had served so well.

Cavour, the first prime minister of an independent Italy and
the brains behind the Risorgimento, had as secretary and faith-
ful friend an Italian Jew, Isaac Artom.

Mazzini, heart of the Risorgimento, had as friend and
counselor L’Olper, an Italian Jewish rabbi and one of the
most courageous advocates of Italian independence. When
at last, old and weary, Mazzini was allowed to return from
exile to Italy—now united and independent, not under a

; republic, but under a monarchical rule of which he disap-
i proved—he nevertheless had to live and die, almost hidden,
3 under an assumed name. His death, although in his father-
,  land, was that of a refugee. His refuge was the house of an
  Italian Jewish family, the Rosselli family, which had con-
1 ‘i tributed to the Mazzinian and Garibaldian movement for a
 united Italy. The two grandsons of this Rosselli, Carlo and
9;

i

Nello, were ambushed and murdered by agents of the Italian
fascist O.V.R.A. on June 10, 1937, at Bagnoles in France.

 The names of Jewish soldiers who died in the cause of
1 Italian freedom were placed along with those of their Chris-

tian fellow soldiers on the monuments erected in their honor.
 J ak >:< >!<
Many statesmen of Jewish origin contributed to the build-

_  ing of the Italian nation. General Giuseppe Ottolenghi was
re  .

 

 

Minister of War in 1902, and was tutor to the royal family.
Luigi Luzzatti was prime minister for the ﬁfth time in 1903.
Ernesto Nathan was one of Rome’s finest mayors. The gov-
ernmental continuity of Italy during the World War was
represented by Sidney Sonnino as Minister of Foreign Af-
fairs. A diehard Conservative and an extreme Italian national-
ist, he was in close, intimate relations with the Court.

Other famous Italians of Jewish origin are Cesare Lom-
broso, noted for his studies in criminology; Guglielmo Ferrero,
the historian, now an exile in Paris; Franchetti, the explorer;
Modigliani, the modern painter; and the writers D’Ambra
and Da Verona. Hundreds of eminent scientists, writers and
politicians now living in Italy are of Jewish origin that dates
back, in many cases, to the time of the Caesars.

* * >!<

Completely fused with the rest of the population, no one

has ever questioned the ancestry of Italian Jews. The Italian’
Jew is as Italian as any other element of the population. Italy-

has been the classical land of Jewish assimilation, intermar-
riage taking place on a large scale, more Jews marrying out-
side their community than inside. The Italian Jew speaks
Italian, never having spoken Yiddish; he looks like any other
Italian; he thinks as an Italian. I

Do not- two thousand years of residence constitute a right
to citizenship? Flying in the face of established facts, our
“scholars” answer: "Jews for thousands of years have con-
sidered themselves . . . in Italy a separate and superior race.”

Mussolini himself in a conversation with Emil Ludwig in
1932 declared:

“There are no longer any pure races, -not even Jewisb, for it is
precisely by -successful interbreeding that the great strength and
beauty of a nation are developed. . . . I shall never believe i-t pos-
sible to prove biologically that a race is more or less pure. . . . Race
is a sentiment, not a reality.”

13

 

 

In 1932, Mussolini, on examining Italian statistics on mixed
marriages, said:

“These results are a demonstration and a justification of the
non-existence of an anti-Semitic movement in Italy. The frequency
of mixed marriages ought to be greeted by all those who wish to be
sincere Italians. For herein is contained the most perfect proof of
the civil and moral equality of Italians whatever may have been
their distant origin.”

Were these the “frequent references to conceptions of race”
by Mussolini that our professors had in mind as strengthening
their theory? Commandment No. 8 of the Fascist Decalogue
is: Mussolini is always right. Is Mussolini right now, or was
he right in 1932? Our “scholars” might give this contradic-
tion their “careful study.” ” .

Before the days of the Rome-Berlin axis, the most ribalcl
ridicule of the Aryan idea to be heard in all Europe was
heard in Italy. Mussolini was chief among the scoffers. On
more than one occasion he remarked to Mrs. Anne O’Hare
McCormick, special correspondent of The New York Times,
that to a Latin the idea of a pure race was pure childishness.

The Italian people have always been brought up in the
tradition of tolerance and fairness toward the Jews. What
could be more bestial than to foment an artiﬁcial anti-Semitism
in a country where the Jews hardly number 47,000 in a nation
of forty-four million, comprising only one-tenth of one per
cent of the population, one Jew for every one thousand Chris-
tians? Seventy-ﬁve per cent of these Italian Jews are concen-
trated in Rome, Milan, Trieste, Florence and Turin. Thirty-
one provinces contain less than fifty Jews each. Five provinces
contain no Jews at all. Sicily has 216 Jews and the Island of
Sardinia exactly fourteen.

Arnaldo Cortesi, the pro-fascist correspondent of The New
York Times, on July 30, 1938, wrote:

14

 

 

 

V Mussolini’s speech at Trieste, cabled:

“The most surprised people in the world were the Italians when
a report drafted by several anonymous but allegedly eminent fascist
I university professors warned them last week that all sorts of grave
though unspeciﬁed dangers threatened them owing to the presence
in their midst of an almost impercepti-bly small Jewish minority.
“The Italians, who have never felt any animosity toward Jews
and who in the past have looked with puzzled wonder on the Jew-
baiting going on in Germany since Nazism" rose to power, have not
yet ceased asking what it is all about.” i

Despite the unleashing of" a tremendous press campaign to
arouse enthusiasm for the new racial policy,- the Italian people
refuse to respond to the poison of anti-Semitism. An example
of their attitude is the dispatch‘ of the correspondent of The
New York Times on September 19, 1938, who, reporting

“It was noticeable that what he said about the Jews was not as
well received by the crowd as the rest of his speech. When he said
world Hebrewism had always been the enemy of fascism the cheers
were very slow in getting started and petered out after an attempt
by part of the crowd to create a semblance of enthusiasm.”

*' * *

The fascists insist that racial discrimination does not mean
persecution. Mussolini, in his speech at Trieste, declared:

“Jews of Italian citizenship who have unquestioned military or
civil merit in the eyes of Italy and the regime will find justice and
comprehension. As to others, a policy‘ of separation will be fol-
lowed. .

“In the endthe world perhaps will be more astounded by our
generosity than by our rigor, at least unless Semites beyond the
frontier and in our country and, above all, their unexpected friends

15

who defend them from too many chairs of learning, compel us to
change radically our course.”

Let us see this generosity, justice and comprehension in

practice. Writes Arnaldo Cortesi in his dispatch of August 1,
1938, to The New York Times:

“Achille Starace, secretary general of the Fascist Party, had no
compunction in stating, indeed, that the fascist regime, in dealing
with the race problem, had followed the usual fascist procedure of
acting first and devising afterward doctrinal justification for its

 

actions. So saying, he virtually admitted that the first measures "

against Jews were already in force.

“It had been known for some time, in fact, that all Jews were
gradually being removed from -posts of prominence and responsi-
bility. It was being done without fuss or publicity. Jews were
neither dismissed nor asked to resign. Left undisturbed until the
expiration of their terms of office, they were then quietly replaced
by ‘Aryans.’ No question of allegiance to the Fascist regime was
involved in this gradual weeding out, since all Italian ofﬁce holders
must perforce be Fascists.

“This unobtrusive elimination of Jews from all posts of com-
mand had proceeded so far ‘by the -time the racist report was pub-
lished that very few ‘non-Aryans’ were left in positions of great
responsibility and even they were rapidly decreasing in numbers.”

This process of elimination began as far back as February

11, 1938, when Gino Olivetti “resigned” as president of the
Italian Cotton Institute and vice-president of the Textile
Guild "for personal reasons.” Signor Olivetti, an Italian Jew,
and one of Italy’s leading industrialists, certainly deserved
that promised Mussolinian generosity for civil merit, having
been a staunch supporter of the fascist regime.

On July 30, 1939, La Tribuna, a newspaper published in

Rome, stated that racism should not be confused with anti-
Semitism. “Anti-Semitism,” it added, “is a reactionary o-r con-

16

servative policy for the application of which the ordinary
administrative means at a state’s disposal are sufficient.”
Signor Olivetti certainly was eliminated by “ordinary admin-
istrative means at a state’s disposal.” Any fool must conclude,
therefore, that such elimination is anti-Semitism in practice.
La Tribuna, of course, denies this, although the very pro-
cedure it outlined as denoting a policy of anti-Semitism was
used with Signor Olivetti. This same procedure was followed
in the cases of other prominent Italiah Jews. Eduardo Mor-
purgo was dismissed as president of one of the biggest insur-
ance companies, Assicurazione Generale di Venezia, and re-
placed by the former fascist Finance Minister, Count Volpi,
one of Italy’ s big ﬁnanciers. Arnaldo Frigessi de Rattalma was
dismissed as president of Riunione Adriatica di Sicurta’, an-
other of Italy’s largest insurance companies, and replaced by
Fulvio Suvich, the Italian Ambassador to the United States.
Senator Alberto Pirelli was appointed vice-president. Pirelli,
a former president of the International Chamber of Commerce
and president of the Fascist Confederation of Industry, is the
richest man in Italy and director of twelve of the largest cor-
porations in Italy. Together with other Italian industrialists he
ﬁnanced Mussolini’s road to power. Mussolini, now their pup-
pet, repays them generously for their services by giving them
free access to Italy’ s wealth. Finding himself under dire ﬁnan-
cial stress, Mussolini is copying from his ally, Hitler, the
gentle art of waging a shameless war of robbery under the

cloak of anti-Semitism, describing ﬁrms as Jewish as an excuse

for handing them over from their former owners to the
fascist ringleaders.

"Nobody dreams of doing Jews any harm,” said the news-
paper La Tribune: on July 30, 1938. On September 10 a
decree was promulgated establishing separate schools for the
exclusive use of Jewish children. They were even promised the
same examinations as Italian children “with appropriate adap-
rations.” Il Messaggero of Rome, commenting on the decree,

17

 

stated that “the fascist state does not, in fact, intend to con-
demn anyone to ignorance,” adding that “the establishment
of schools exclusively for Jews has always been a secret aspira-
tion of the Jews: their separating from the rest of the people
i  ii because of a pretended pride in their superiority. The desire
1  for such physical and moral separation is equally shared by
T us.”

 This same newspaper deplores "those anti-fascists who
i pretend feelings of pity for the children of Jews” and brazenly
declares that this policy of segregation and ghettoism will find

(,3 real favor with all Jewish communities in Italy and abroad.

; The Italian newspaper II Tevere has published the names
A l of 174 professors affected by the decree excluding Jews from
.  the universities. Among the names one notes such eminent men
a  as Giorgio Del Vecchio, professor of law and the first fascist
4 -if rector of the University of Rome; Gino Arias, professor of
'  1 political corporative economy at the University of Rome and
until recently a regular contributing writer for Mussolini’s II
Popolo d’Italia, and the oﬂicial organ of the fascist hierarchy,
Gerarc/rid; and Professor Eugenio Morelli, specialist in res- E
piratory diseases and head of the Crusade Against Tubercu- L
losis. The rest of the list of professors contains some of the l
most important ﬁgures in Italian culture.

When signing the decree excluding Jewish professors and 1
students from Italian educational institutions, one wonders if 
the hand of the Minister of National Education, Giuseppe
Bottai, did not tremble, remembering that his mother was a
Jew. Will he be made an “Honorary Aryan” because of his
long and faithful service to fascism, or will he follow the nine-
‘  teen functionaries dismissed from the Ministry of the Interior?
V" Will he have the courage to resign his oﬂice in protest as did

Miralaldo Ascoli, Jewish commander of the naval forces in

the Aegean Sea, and Admiral Paolo Moroni, also a Jew,

commander of the 4th Division at Mallorca?

What will happen to the five Italian generals on the general
staff of the Italian army who are of Jewish descent? What
will happen to the twenty-ﬁve senators of Jewish descent?
Will the “courageous” General Rodolfo Graziani, who mur-
dered the defenseless Ethiopian people, have the courage to
protest against the persecution of his fellow Jews? Will the
only woman of any “importance” in the fascist movement,
Margherita Sarfatti, also a Jew, be affected by the racial
policy? Or will this intimate biographer of Mussolini and his
alleged mistress be mad-e an "Honorary Aryan”?

On November 7, 1938, the fascist government issued a
decree declaring all Jews ineligible for membership in the
Fascist Party. Strongest hit by this decree are the Italian Jew-
ish fascists, that pathetic, spineless and reactionary group who
capitulated to the enemy. Together with the rest of the Jews,

they will henceforth be considered outcasts, without posi-_

tions, jobs or civil rights. Ironically enough, it was this same
cowardly group which, in 1937, in an editorial in Nostra Ban-
diercz, organ of Jewish fascists, suggested that all Zionists be
dismissed from government positions and replaced by loyal
Jewish fascists.

Mussolini once wrote that “Anti-Semitism is a product of
barbarism." For once we agree with him. One of the aspects
of this fascist barbarism is the attack on culture. On July 2,
1938, the fascist government issued a decree forbidding pub-
lishers to print translations of foreign books by Jewish authors.
Another decree on October 6 banned textbooks by 114 Italian-
Jewish authors from Italian schools. The anti-Semitic news-
paper, II Tea/ere, editorially exhorted the Italian government
to suppress also those books by authors of the Aryan race
which are “imbued with Jewish mentality.” This will prevent
even safely fascist writers like Ugo Ojetti from expressing any

, admiration for Jews. Ojetti’s book, C ose Viste, describes Al-
bert Einstein, the scientist now exiled from Nazi Germany,
when Einstein lectured in Bologna in 1921:

“There was Einstein, a plump, alert and smiling Jew, who was
speaking to us more or less about paradise, at least about the place
where Dante imagined it to be: in the sky and among the stars . . .
his beautiful, pale, Semitic face. . . . But what wins the heart is
his childlike expression: he is a great, serene and well-mannered

child,’ -happy to play, as he does, with ideas, with words and with

inﬁnity. ; .

This decree will make necessary a new edition of the just

‘completed Enciclopedia I taliana, if only because of the fol- ,

lowing passage concerning the British Imperial Fascist League:

"Because of their an-ti-Semitic tendencies and, similarly, because
of their admiration for Adolph Hitler, of whom they are more

faithful imitators than they are of Benito Mussolini, they cannot, A

despite their name, consider themselves the most genuine represen-
tatives of the ideas of Fascism in Englan .”

Already there is a ban on American ﬁlms with Jewish
actors. The Italian people are no longer permitted to laugh
at the antics of Charlie Chaplin, the Marx Brothers or the
Ritz Brothers. The fascist authorities have decreed that these
comedians are not funny. Even that innocent ﬁlm, Snow White
and the Seven Dwarfs, which hasdelighted children all over
the world, has been banned as being harmful to the imperialist
education of Italian children under fascism. It was not ex-
plained whether Snow White and the seven dwarfs were
“members of the Aryan race imbued with Jewish mentality.”

>!< * >l<

If we are to learn anything from the experience of the
20

 

 

 

persecution of the Jews in Germany, we know _that what is
happening in Italy today is just: a mere beginning. Jews have
been dismissed from all positions of importance in the gov-
ernment, the armed forces, the schools, business ﬁrms and the
Fascist Party. This last will mean a real hardship because of
the impossibility of getting employment in Italy unless one is
a member of the Fascist Party.

In an article signed by Professor Pasquale Pennisi, in the
newspaper Il Regime Fascista, published at Cremona by
Roberto Farinacci, a fascist leader of the “first hour,” it was
suggested that marriage between Italian Christians and Italian
Jews be forbidden and “illicit” relations between them severely
punished. This suggestion has now been made official law.

On October 15, 1938, a decree forbade the issuance to any
Jews of licenses for opening retail businesses or public estab-
lishments. A few days later all Jewish stockbrokers were dis-
missed from the Rome Exchange and their representatives who
are Jews forbidden to attend to trading. Firm after ﬁrm is
practically seized from Italian Jews and given over to fascist
“Aryan” ringleaders. The most sweeping decree is that of
November 10 which prohibits all Jews from owning or man-
aging industries connected with national defense, and debars
them from owning land valued at more than 5,000 lire ($250)
or houses the taxable value of - which exceeds 20,000 lire
($1,000).

"The world perhaps will be more astounded by our gener-
osity than by our rigor,” said Mussolini about his treatment
of the'Italian Jews. As evidence of this generosity the fascist
government proposes that all Jews leave Italy and establish
themselves in Ethiopia where they may take with them private
capital, machinery, tools and household goods. The fascist
press considers this a real providence, not only for Italian
Jews, but also Jews from other countries, suggesting that they
will have in Ethiopia the opportunity for industrial and com-

21

 

 

  

 

 

mercial development . . . in the interests of Italian imperial-
ism, naturally.

“This is another proof,” continues the Italian press, “of the
just, humane and practical deliberation of the Fascist government.
Jews in general, particularly Zionist Jews, have much to gain by
this noble Italian initiative. It is better than Palestine with its
guerrilla warfare with the Arabs which will never end, and the
continual risk of one’s life.”

Those very Jews whose presence in Italy is supposed in
some mysterious fashion to be sapping the traditional virtues
of the Italian people are now offered this new “Zionist” haven
where the Jews may build industrial pyramids for the fascist
Pharaoh. Thus the fascists admit the failure of the Italian
‘colonization of Ethiopia where the passive and even armed
resistance of the population, determined to gain their inde-
pendence, has not ceased. The number of Italian workers in
Ethiopia declined from 115,000 in March, 1937, to 41,000
in January, 1938, and to 27,000 in May. The fascist regime
attempts in vain to conceal this failure by announcing fresh
colonization of Libya! The paradise refused by the Italian
people is now offered to the Jews a.s a “noble Italian initiative.”

This ruthless policy of anti-Semitism, we are asked to be-
lieve, is not persecution. Evidently, the fascist barbarians con-
sider anything short of the physical extermination of the Jews
as a manifestation of their mildness and their “justice, com-
prehension and generosity.” '

The worst is yet to come. The first issue of the new anti-
Semitic magazine, Difesa della Razza (Defense of Race),
has already made its appearance under the editorship of
Telesio Interlandi, chief editor of the anti-Semitic newspa-
per, Il Tea/ere. The crude and completely discredited forgery,
the so-called Protocol: of the Elder; of Zion, is being rehashed.
Difesa della Razza bids fair to become a worthy competitor of
the Nazi Julius Streicher’s Der Stuermer.

THE experience of Germany teaches us that after the Jews,
the next in line for persecution are the Protestants, and
then the Catholics, for fascism is the enemy of all religion. In
Hitler Germany the youth are taught not only to hate Jews
but also Christians. The Official Guide for the Education of
the Hitler Youth, among its ﬁfty points, contains the fol-
lowing:

1. Christianity is a religion for slaves and fools.

2. Christianity and Communism are identical. _ -
3. Christianity does not differentiate between white people an

‘Negroes.

4. The New Testament is a Jewish lie by four evangelists.

5. The church is international.

16. There is no.Christian culture.

18. Christianity has spoiled the German people, because it has
taught them ideas such as adultery and theft, which they had
never known.

20. Christianity is only a substitute and cover for Judaism, and
was invented by Jews in Rome. I

21. Jesus Christ was a Jew. '

24.‘ How did Christ die? Whining on the cross. How did Planetta

die? Shouting “Heil Hitler!” (Planetta was the murderer of,

Chancellor Dollfuss.) '
26. The Ten Commandments are a manifestation of the lowest
instincts of humanity. .
45. The new Eternal City is Nuremberg. Rome is doomed.

This spirit of race hatred and religious intolerance is now
being fostered by German Nazi agents in Italy. The Roman
Catholic Church has been quick to see that the persecution of
the Jewish people is a menace also to Catholics. The Church
has seen Catholics in Germany persecuted almost as ruth-

23

 

lessly as the Jews. The same brutal mobs which, instigated
by the Nazi government itself, razed Jewish synagogues and
shops and homes to the ground, also attacked the palace of
Cardinal Innitzer in Vienna, injuring the Cardinal severely
while h-e was praying. A priest who tried to defend him was
thrown out of a second-story window, dying as a result of
injuries. Cruciﬁxes and religious objects were burned in the
public square. The Cardinal is still held a prisoner in his
palace.

On November 11, 1938, as a result of an incendiary speech
made by the German Minister of the Interior, Adolf Wagner,
the palace of Cardinal von Faulhaber in Munich was attacked
and church property destroyed. The next day, a religious pro-
cession was attacked, holy candles and ﬂowers trampled, the
Virgin Mary mocked, and the people forced to disperse, while
the police looked on without interfering with the Nazi
disturbers.

Pope Pius XI, because of Hitler’s persecution of Jews,
Protestants and Catholics, has rightly called him the “modern
Nero.” It was logical that the Pope should see the dangers of
anti-Semitism in Italy. He declared, addressing a group of
Belgian pilgrims, that “it is impossible for Christians to share
in anti-Semitic views. We recognize everybody’s right to de-

fend his legitimate interests when they are threatened, but i
anti-Semitism is inadmissible. We are spiritually Semites.”

The oflicial, organ of the Vatican, Osservatore Romano,
warned: “The Catholic Church will defend persecuted Jews
wherever they may be.” Condemning the Italian fascist racial
policy, the Pope on July 16, 1938, referred to the:

“. . . great question at present agitating the world under the name
of nationalism, a nationalism in many ways exaggerated, an ill-
conceived nationalism which we have already had painful occasion

to denounce as erroneous and dan erous.
S
"It is a matter by now -of a true form of apostasy. It is no

24

 

 

longer a matter of this or that erroneous idea; it is the whole spirit
of the doctrine that is contrary to the faith of Christ.”

Again on July 21, Pope Pius declared that the fascist racial
theory was contrary to "Catholic credo because in the words:
“I believe in the Catholic faith,” Catholic means universal,
not racist, nor nationalistic, nor separatistic.

“The spirit of faith,” concluded the Pope, “must ﬁght against
the spirit of separatism and against the spirit of exaggerated
nationalism, which are detestable and which, just because they are
not Christian, end -by not being even human.”

Yet again on July 28, the Pope said:

“Things must be correctly interpreted and kept in their proper

' places. Among such things are the exceptions of race, of stock, of

nation, of nationality. It is forgotten that humankind, the whole

of humankind, is a single, great, universal -human race. All men are,

above all, members of the same great kind. They all belong to the

single great family of the living. Humankind is therefore a single,
universal . . . race.”

In retaliation, the Fascist Party threatened to declare mem-
bership in the Catholic Action associations incompatible with
membership in the Fascist Party. Thus Catholics were threat-
ened with the same treatment as the Jews, exclusion from
membership in the Fascist Party being tantamount to exclusion
from opportunities of ﬁnding employment. Sensing this dan-
ger to the livelihood of Catholics, the Pope counter-attacked

vigorously. “Beware,” he dramatically addressed the fascist .

authorities, “I advise you not to strike at Catholic Action asso-

ciations. I advise you and beseech you not to do so for your

own good because whoever strikes at the Catholic Action asso-

ciations strikes at the Pope and whoever strikes at the Pope
25

dies,” this last phrase being an allusion to aimedieval saying
when the Papacy was in conﬂict with the Holy Roman Empire,
“qui mange du Pape en meurt.”

The Pope concluded. “\We have to ask ourselves why Italy
should have had to go and copy Germany with such unfor-
tunate imitativeness.” '

The fascist press, as was to be expected, did not publish
the Vatican criticism; but the Pope’s words reached vast num-
bers of Italian Catholics, making a deep impression. A number
of Catholic parish papers which voiced criticism of anti-
Semitism were seized.

In his Trieste speech on September 18, Mussolini, smai-ting”

under the taunt ﬂung at him by the Pope, who had charged
him with imitation of Hitler, retaliated: “Those who try to
make it believed that we have obeyed or imitated . . . are
poor halfwits to whom we accord our contempt and our pity.”
Thus fascism, which has always boasted of its love for the

~Catholic Church in order to win prestige abroad, now lets

down its mask and calls the head of that church a “poor half-
wit to whom we accord our contempt and our pity.”

According to the Vatican City newspaper, Osservatore
Romano, Pope Pius personally addressed letters to King Vic-
'tor Emmanuel and Mussolini, protesting against the decree
forbidding marriage between Italian “Aryans” and “non-
Aryans,” begging them not to permit such a violation of the
concordat between the Vatican and Italy. The Pope’s appeals
not only failed but also received no reply.

The Pope once called Mussolini “a man of Providence.”
Today, in gratitude, the ultra-fascist newspaper, Il Regime
Fascista, accuses the Pope of being in league “with atheists,
communists, free-masons, Protestants, democrats and Jews.”

This growing conflict between the Vatican and Mussolini

is in itself a reflection of the ever-widening discontent of the
Italian people with the policies of fascism. For while the
oﬂicial fostering of anti-Semitism in Italy indicates Mussolini’s
growing dependence on, and submission to, his partner in
Berlin, it also coincides with the growing discontent of the
Italian people. Fascism’s ruinous war against the Ethiopian
people, its gigantic expenditures for the invasion of the Span-
ish Republic, the present food crisis, the international situation
resulting from its alliance with Hitler, have caused widespread
grumbling. The people are tired of the promise of cake to-
morrow while the bread of today is denied them. Mussolini
hears the roaring of the tempest around him which will engulf
him and his regime. He seeks to divert their discontent. He
has exhausted all the excuses possible for his failure to bring
prosperity and peace to the Italian people: first it was bolshe-

_v1sm, then it was Wall Street, next it was England, then it

 

was the need to conquer Ethiopia. Now, in desperation, he
grasps at the last straw—anti-Semitism.

It is an attempt to divide the forces of growing resistance
against him and his regime. It is an attempt to develop a
spirit of hatred for other peoples as a necessary preparation
for war; for fascism, in its desperation, sees war as the only
way out of its difliculties. Because Mussolini knows that the
Italian people abhor war and desire peace, he needs to whip
them into a frenzy of race hatred and race superiority in
order to push them toward the abyss of a world conﬂagration.

IV

HE Italians in America are truly anxious about the anti-
Semitic racial policy of Italian fascism. They consider such
a policy a national shame,.with disastrous consequences not
only for the Jews in Italy, but also with possible grave reper-
cussions here in America. Mussolini’s agents are already at-
tempting to inﬂuence the Italian people in democratic America

to line up with Hitler’s Nazi agents to undermine democracy.
The Italian people in America are being incited against their
fellow Jewish-Americans.

Early in the anti-Semitic campaign, obeying the orders of
the Italian government, the Italian newspapers owned by an
American citizen, Generoso Pope, Mussolini’s Tammany
stooge, began to lay the groundwork. On July 24, 1938, his
newspapers approved the fascist racial policy, published
without comment or contradiction a statement from the fas-
cist press in Italy that, “The Aryan (Italian) race is heroic
and chivalric, while the Jews are vile and mercantile.”

Another fascist sheet published in New York, II Grido
Della Stirpe (Cry of the Race), has been propagating the
vilest insults against democracy and against the Jews. Its
editor, Domenico Trombetta, has been conducting a violent
campaign over radio station WHOM, calculated to foment
race hatred between Italians and Jews in America. The Federal
Communications Commission received so many l-etters of pro-
test from Italian listeners that it refused to renew the regular
license of station WHOM, granting it a temporary license,
renewable after ninety days provided it has by that time
eliminated its anti-democratic and anti-Semitic propaganda.

The protests of the Italian listeners of station WHOM
demonstrate that the Italians in America do not approve of
the activities of the enemies of democracy. The indignation of
Italian-Americans against Mussolini’s barbarous anti-Semitic
campaign is nationwide. It comes from all sections of the
Italian people, from all who honor and glory in the democratic
traditions of the Italian people both in Italy and America.

Luigi Antonini, State Chairman of the American Labor
Party and General Secretary of the Italian Dressmakers
Union, Local 89, of the International Ladies Garment Work-
ers Union, speaking before several thousand Italian dress-
makers at the Center Hotel, appealed to all Italian-Americans

to dissociate themselves from anti-Semitic propaganda:
' 28

 

 

.,__ _,.._.s a......_.._..¢p.. ~-.—. ,

“Let those who seek to spread anti-Semitism or other forms of
racial discrimination in this country «remember that once racial dis-
cord is rampant, none will escape. Let my countrymen remember
that the venom of racial intolerance can be turned just as easily
against Italian and German as against Jew.”

Frank Seri, president of the Taxpayers and Merchants Na-
tional Alliance, urged the Italian-Americans at a Columbus

‘Day celebration in 1938 at Public School 29, Brooklyn, fol-

lowing their three-mile parade, to protest through the Italian
Ambassador in Washington against the program of persecu-
tion against Jews in Italy.

“Anti-Semitism is Hitlerism at its blackest,” he warned,
and called upon all Italians to let Mussolini know “that
millions of Americans of Italian extraction who love Italy
and its great people are shocked at the anti-Jewish pro-gram
andithat they regard it as ignoble and deeply un-Italian.”

On October 23, 1938, at,Hartford, Connecticut, a resolu-
tion addressed to Mussolini protesting his anti-Semitic policy
was drafted by a committee representing the majority of
Italian-American organizations in Connecticut. Former
Alderman Rocco Pallotti, a former president of the Con-
necticut Federation of Italian-American clubs, who presided
at this meeting, branded Mussolini’ s anti-Jewish campaign as:

“. . . a policy which has been ‘forced upon the people of Italy. It is
one that they have been forced to accept. I cannot and will not
believe that they are in sympathy with it. Hitler began with anti-
Semitism, and now -observe how he is persecuting the Catholics in
Germany and Austria. Once anti—Semitism has begun, no one can
say where it will lead.” I

Mr. Pallotti recalled the cruel persecution of Italians in the
past as a reminder that the Italian people “should well be
able to understand what such discrimination means.”

ARE ‘WE ARYANS?

a By GINO BARDI

I

N THE heart of the Mediterranean Sea, cradle of civiliza-
tion, was born Modern Italy. It is the creation of a poet,
Dante, who gave it a language; of Michelangelo and Leonardo
da Vinci, who gave it an art; of Galileo and Giordano Bruno,
who gave it ‘a science; of Mazzini and Garibaldi, who gave it
liberty. They expressed the Italian people’s love for beauty,
their hunger for knowledge, their struggle for freedom.

This child of poets and artists, scientists and revolutionary

 

heroes, "grown to manhood, lies in bondage. Oppression and .

suffering have distorted its features. The poets and heroes of
today who would save it from death are exiled or imprisoned
or murdered. The blacl<est of ‘Black Plagues has brought it
down to the lowest depths of barbarism and spiritual and
cultural depravity.

Where once the gentle Leonardo da Vinci wrote that he
hated war as a “bestilissima _pazzia”—-that most bestial mad-
ness—and that “it is an inﬁnitely atrocious thing to take away
the life of a man”—today are heard the ranting accents of a
Marinetti declaring that "war is beautiful and the sole hy-
giene of the world.” Mussolini proclaims that “Fascism neither
believes in the possibility nor the utility of perpetual peace.
. . .War alone brings up to its highest tension all human energy
and puts the stamp of nobility upon the peoples who have the

 

 

Another prominent Italian-American, Dr. Bella Visono

Dodd, teacher of Government at Hunter College, member of
the New York Bar and legislative representative of the
Teachers Union, stated: 4

"I sincerely hope that no one who is a member of our Italian-
American community will fall victim to this new theory of racial
hatred announced by the government of the country in which they
or their parents were born. . . . Any attack upon religious freedom

is an .-attack upon all religions. As a ﬁrm believer in American 1

democracy, I would like to add my voice to the growing chorus of
protests against the barbarous acts of anti-Semitism that are preva-
lent in many European countries. These countries are trying to
solve their economic troubles by using the Jew as scapegoat. This
will fail as it has failed in the past.”

The Lieutenant-Governor of New York ‘State, Charles

Poletti, at a. meeting of 1,000 delegates of the Bronx American
Labor Party in Morris High School, bitterly assailed the anti-
Semitism of the fascist government. He added:

"Coming to this group, I have to think how lucky we are to be in
America. I heard the names of the committees read here-Jews,
Italians and others. . Here we can all come together in perfect

understanding and with a feeling of mutual respect and admira- 0

tion.”

In similar vein was a statement to the press on October 10,

1938, by Phillip Bongiorno, World War veteran decorated by
the Italian government while serving as captain in the
American Air Service, and former head of the American
Order of Sons of Italy, largest Italian fraternal society in
America. His statement, in part, said:

“Italians as well as Americans of Italian extraction in America
are overwhelmingly not in sympathy with the anti-Semitic move-
ment and measures in Italy and are thoroughly ashamed of them.

"The whole detestable thing is a puzzle to them. . . . Italians
have always been rightfully proud of their freedom from racial or
religious prejudices and they have never" stooped so low as to make
a distinction ‘between Italians of the Jewish faith and those of
other faiths. J ‘

"Take, for instance, the relationship between Italians and Jews
in America. I do not believe a closer or friendlier relationship
exists anywhere between any other two groups. A good example of
what I mean is the touching friendship between Governor Lehman
and Justice Charles Poletti and the marriage of Justice Pecora and
Mrs. Pecora.”

' Noting the growing disapproval of anti-Semitism on the
part of the Italian people, the pro-fascist oﬂicials of the Sons
of Italy began to change their tune. The fascist Mr. Stefano
Miele of New York, National Supreme Venerable of the
Order of Sons of Italy, speaking before the delegates of
the twenty-sixth annual‘ Massachusetts State Convention of

the Order, said:

“We disbelieve in racial prejudice and racial priority rights. We
are guiding ourselves under the Constitution of the United States
and the Declaration of Independence which holds the truths that
we are all children of -the same God. We fervently desire to live
and work, side by side with men and women of all races in peace
and friendship and spirit of brotherhood.”

Last but not least, MussoIini’s Tammany stooge, Generoso
Pope, seeing himself embarrassed, in the position of defend-
ing a policy repugnant and detestable to the Italians in
America, decided to cover his embarrassment and past mis-
deeds in the service of fascism by joining the chorus of pro-
tests. His newspapers began to eliminate the more obnoxious
aspects of the anti-Jewish drive. Urgent protests from the
readers of his newspapers at last forced him to publish front

' 31

page editorials signed by himself. On August 29, 1938, he
wrote:

Jews and Italians in America, where the children of both races
have always lived together with‘ the best of personal relationships,
working together and building everywhere common enterprises,
which it -would be very -painful to break and send to ruin.”

How much this change in his attitude is due to his
“humanitarianism” and how much is due to fear of a boy-
cott by his Jewish business contacts will never be known. Was
it a little hint from his Jewish business associates that made
him jittery on September 11? Was the glory of fascism less
dear to him than the possible effects on his pocketbook for
espousing an unpopular cause? On that day he wrote:

"A race struggle in the United States would be a grave offense
against the Constitution and the traditions of this Republic. . . .
Let us keep our nerves, then. No im-pulsive, hysterical and dan-
gerous movements. One knows how they begin, but not how they
end up. I

“Fortunately, these ﬁghts can be avoided in America by using a
minimum of good sense an-d prudence. Let us keep ﬁrm, therefore,
to the tradition of friendly personal relations and useful collabora-
tion in ‘business affairs. Thus shall we——Italians and ]ews——be an
example to other national groups who watch us with interest in this
delicate moment.

“From the many letters I have received I can state with satis-
faction that the Italians of America sincerely share my opinion and
cordially adhere to my appeal.”

If the Italians are respected today and have a surer sense
of “belonging” to America, it is not due in any shape or
form to Mussolini, but tothe participation of Italian workers
in labor struggles, together with other Americans, to better

32

“It would be deplorable if we had divisions and strife between

 

 

their economic condition; their participation in progressive
political movements like the American Labor Party; and it is
due also to the new generation of native-born Americans of
Italian descent who carry on the democratic traditions of
Mazzini and Garibaldi as well as the traditions of their
American forefathers, Washington, Jeﬁerson and Lincoln.

What would an American fascist racial policy against
Italians mean in a city like New York? It would mean that
over $200,000,000 worth of real,estate owned by Italians
would be conﬁscated and given over to American “Ayrans”
and the Italian heads of business enterprises'replaced by 100
percent Americans.

It would mean throwing out of their jobs 1,200 doctors of
Italian descent, 1,000 lawyers, hundreds of dentists, and a
great many musicians, writers, artists and small businessmen.
It would mean the dismissal of 1,200 teachers from public
schools, high schools and colleges, the exclusion of 300,000
Italian children from the regular school system and the es-
tablishment of separate schools for them, where they may
have the same examinations “with appropriate adaptations.”

Ten thousand Italians in American universities would be
denied the right to continue with their studies and told that
what was good for their immigrant parents should be good
enough for them.

Mayor LaGuardia, Lieutenant Governor Poletti and Jus-
tices Cotillo and Pecora would be debarred from holding
public oﬂice. I

Dr. Alberto Bonaschi would be dismissed as a member of
the Board of Education. And Mr. Generoso Pope himself
would_be deprived of his newspapers and replaced as presi-
dent of the Colonial Sand and Stone Company. The 200
per cent American “Aryans” wouldilike nothing better than
to put them all on a boatand then send them “back where
you came from,” thus saving America from contamination
with “other races” and returning all the jobs back to the

33

I? .

"pure Americans” who had been robbed of them by "the
unfair competition and cheap labor of those damn foreigners.”

Fantastic, isn’t it, that under an American brand of fascism,
what is happening to the Jews in Italy today might also
happen to Italians? Not so fantastic! No longer ago than
October 31, 1938, and no farther away than Oyster Bay, L. I.,
400 Italian, Negro and Polish students of the Oyster Bay
High School went on strike to protest against the slanderous
statement of a wealthy resident at a taxpayers’ meeting that
the high school was "too good for niggers, wops and pollacks.”
The parents of the striking children joined them in front of
the school. They successfully defeated the attempts of the
police force to dislodge them from the school grounds. It is
a credit to the Italian children in this strike that they were its
most militant leaders. In the name of the strikers, the head
of the strike committee, John Napoli, demanded an apology
and presented to- the principal of the school the following
statement:

“This strike was called in protest to remarks printed in a local
paper and made by an unnamed person against the pupils of
Negro, Polish and Italian descent. We, the children of these dif-
ferent groups, feel that this school system is not too good for us
and we as a group bitterly resent these insults made by such in-
dividuals. It is further the sentiment of this committee that we
attempt in every way possible to find out who these individuals are
and require of them a public apology for such an un-American
sentiment.” (New York Times, Nov. 1, 1938.)

Mary Napoli, sister of the Italian student strike leader,
said:
"This time we won’t stop until it’s all over. Last year one of
those fancy ladies said that her dogs were better than we were

and we just swallowed the insult, but this year it’s going to

34

 

..s-..4_. - , ,_ .,_,; ,_ M... . - .. -,

be different. If you let them step on you once, it’ll happen
all the time.”

The father of these two militant Italian children declared:

“We Italians helped -build this town. We were here from the
start, way ‘back, hundreds of years. We worked as ﬁshermen and A
farmers and now they tell us we are the foreigners. Our people
have fought in the wars and lived through all the disasters and
we «belong here as much as they.”

Under an. American brand of fascism the whole Napoli
family would be shipped to the concentration camps of Alaska
as dangerous Reds. Were the Jewish children in Italy today
to protest against the fascist authorities as these Italian chil-
dren did here in America, what would be their fate?

It is obvious that in their own self-interest the Italians in
America cannot but reject fascism whether of the Italian or
American brand, and choose, instead, democracy. By ﬁghting
in its defense together with Jews, Negroes, and with all pro-
gressive and democratic forces, they will prevent democracy’s
ever becoming “a putrefied corpse.” By ﬁghting racial dis-
crimination as these school children did, the Italians in
America will strengthen one of the bulwarks of democracy.
By opposing all fascist organizations and individuals who
foment racial hatred and preach anti-democratic ideologies,
the Italians in America will be fighting discrimination against
themselves.

Such fascist organizations as the Ku Klux Klan, the
Black Legion and the Silver Shirts are a future threat to every
Italian in America, for these organizations are not only anti-
Semitic and anti-Negro, but also anti-Catholic and anti-
foreign born. ,

It is common knowledge and reported in the American
press that Roy Zachary, leader of the Silver Shirts, at a num-

35

 

 

 

 

 

’ ~~-“-;:s,~ jeiv--:zu&:‘»,«a~.i.«. , . .

ber of fascist meetings, publicly called for the assassination
of President Roosevelt. These fascists hate Roosevelt because
his New Deal social legislation helps to protect the civil
liberties of the underprivileged and to improve conditions of
that "one-third of a nation which is ill-fed, ill-clothed, ill-
housed.” Yet Italian fascist agents, working in close touch
with the Italian consulates, are in intimate contact with these
various fascist organizations.

Let us not overlook the fascist priest, Father Coughlin,
whose unctuously hypocritical voice over the radio spreads
anti-democratic and anti-Semitic hatred, calling for “bullets,
not ballots.” What more proof is needed that this Judas, ac-
cepting the thirty pieces of silver of the big American indus-
trialists, betrays the spirit of the humble Carpenter of
Nazareth? What more proof is needed of Father Coughlin’s
anti-Ca_tholicism when he defends Mussolini’ s persecution of
the Jews in his paper, Social Justice, thus placing himself in
opposition to the utterances of the Pope on racial theory?
What further proof is needed to conclude that Father
Coughlin, a Catholic priest, looks not to the Holy Father in
St. Peter’s for guidance, but to the Anti—Christ in Palazzo
Venezia?

>!< >1< *

What would happen in the shops, the oflices, the schools,

the streets and neighborhoods where Jews and Italians work i

and live together should the deadly poison of “anti-Semitism
take root among Italian-Americans? It would be dangerous
not only for Jews but for Italians as well. Once racial dis-
crimination begins to spread there is no guarantee that it will
not also effect the Italian people. The attack upon the Jews
cannot be considered as an attack merely upon a single race
or religion. It is reaction’s weapon intended to divide and
destroy the democray and peace of all the American people.
36

 

Anti-Semitism in any shape or form imperils liberty and free-
dom for the whole nation.

It is, therefore, necessary that the Italians in America, of
all shades of opinion, but united in their love for democracy,
continue to fraternize with the Jewish people whom they have
always admired and respected, and join together with them to
mobilize public opinion in the ﬁght against anti-Semitism and
all other types of racial discrimination, struggling all the
harder with the rest of progressive America against fascism,
the breeder of anti-Semitism, the enemy of democracy and the
instigator of war.

The Italians in America are proud that Italy has a Tos-
canini who is sho-wing the progressive elements of mankind
how near he is to them in spirit. The fascists remind him that
they slapped his face seven years ago in Bologna for refusing
to play the fascist hymn, Giovinezza, and that he has come
down “from his artistic heaven and makes himself an accuser
of Nazi Germany and self-appointed friend of Jews.” Italians
are proud of their Toscanini who refused to conduct an
orchestra in Germany after Hitler came to power, or in Salz-
burg when Hitler seized Austria, but chose instead to go to
Palestine at the head of an orchestra of exiled and refugee
German and Jewish musicians, as an eloquent statement of
his hatred for fascism. T

The Italians in New York City are proud of their Mayor
LaGuardia who has not hesitated to denounce anti-Semitism

' and declare publicly that Hitler was a beast who should be

kept in a cage. They are proud that he refused to receive at
City Hall the sadistic murderer who derived pleasure from
bombing innocent Ethiopian women and children, the son of
Mussolini.

They are proud of their anti-fascist Congressman Vito
Marcantonio, who ﬁghts militantly in their interests, who
fights in the courts to free an Italian youth, John Longo,
from the clutches of Frank Hague’s brand of fascism in

37

 

Jersey City, while the fascist “patriots” lift not a finger in his
defense. The Italians are proud of the Marcantonio who
ﬁghts for the unemployed and defends Italian immigrants
from the hardships of deportation, while the fascist "patriots”
who betray their pledged allegiance to America brand him
anti-Italian and their Mussolini-controlled and subsidized press
so fears his popularity with the Italian masses that they dare
not print his name.

The Italians in America are beginning to learn, just as the
Italians in Italy have long since learned through bitter ex-
perience, that fascism is their worst enemy. The Italians in
America have never really been fascists; they have only
cherished a love for Italy. They were misled to believe that
this love could only be proved by accepting fascism. Letters
from their relatives continue to show that the paradise
created by Generoso Pope’s fascist press does not and never
did exist. Hearing at last the cry of their oppressed brothers
in Italy, they are beginning to learn that truly to love Italy
means to help destroy fascism, to help free Italy of a regime
which has put it back two centuries, a regime which has
burdened the Italian people with a hatred that is not merited
by them, but merited alone by the savages who rule her
through violence and terror. I

The Italians of America are beginning to learn that the
fundamental struggle today is the struggle between fascism
and democracy. That they are choosing democracy has been
eloquently demonstrated by the election of the anti-fascist
Vito Marcantonio to Congress, and the inglorious defeat of
the fascist-saluting Lanzetta, by the Italian people of East
Harlem in New York City. I

The progressive Italians of America can be justly proud of
the democratic traditions inherited from Mazzini and Gari-
baldi, and the traditions of freedomvand equality of Jefferson
and Lincoln which they have acquired, together with their
citizenship, from their adopted land. They have faith that

38

 

 



~'."“"v-ms.

 

 
 

their brothers in Italy will have their ﬁnal clay of reckoning
with Mussolini and fascism, when the spirit of Mazzini and
Garibaldi will prevail once more, and the Italian heroes re-
leased from dungeons and prisons and returned from exile
will once more lead the Italian people among the civilized
nations of the world.

In America, the Italian people stand together with all
peace—loving and democracy-loving Americans to keep
America democratic and free. They have learned the bitter
lesson that tyranny sets men apart, but freedom unites them.

In our day’s mighty struggle against fascism and “war, they ‘
know that there are no Jews and no Christians. There are only

those who love freedom and those who wish to destroy it.

Butfascism shall not destroy it! Not so long as all people,
regardless of race, color or creed, are conscious of their duty to
civilization and humanity and unite to struggle against it with
determination and faithso that fascism shall _perish from the
face of the earth.

 

 

39,

courage to meet it.” Fascist Commandment No. 1 for every
Italian child is that “a fascist must never believe in perpetual
peace.” Thus was educated the Duce’s son, Vittorio, who de-
scribed as “a beautiful sport” his bombing of innocent Ethio-
pian women and children from the safe heights of an airplane.

Where once Mazzini said, "I love my fatherland because
I love all fatherlands,” today are taught and sung hymns of
hatred for other peoples. Where once Garibaldi offered his
sword to ﬁght for the freedom of the common people from
tyranny, wherever they might be, today starved legions are
forced to invade and enslave free peoples.

Fascism proclaims that the democracy of Mazzini and Gari-
baldi is a “putreﬁed corpse.” Fascism has made it a corpse.
Well might the poet of the Risorgimento, Leopardi, cry today:

0 fatherland,

I see the walls and arches,

The columns and statues,

And armed towers of our fathers;
But glory see I not,

Nor laurel, nor the sword

Of our forefathers.

Now disarmed,

Bare is your breast and bare your brow.
Alas.’ What wounds, what blood!
How pale I see thee, lovely lady.’

I cry to heaven and earth:

Tell me, tell me,

Who brought her to so low a pass?

The once proud child of the Renaissance and the Risorgi-
mento, having outlived the doses of fascist castor oil and
brutal clubbings, is now being injected with the most deadly
poison of race hatred and anti-Semitism. In its tie-up with

. Hitler in the Rome-Berlin axis, Italian fascism is following

slavishly in the footsteps of all the savage policies of Hitler-
ism. If ever there were any illusions about a so-called “good”.
fascism and a “bad” fascism, those illusions may now be
dispelled.

In 1915, Mussolini wrote in his newspaper, Il Popolo
d’Italia:

“Toward the Germans, the thieves, the incendiaries, the maimers
of children, the assaulters of women, who with pleasure can witness
the sinking of steamships transporting innocent passengers, and
who use asphyxiating gas: every act of mercy will ‘be a crime of
high treason against the faztherland and humanity. . . . All that
which means ignominy, treachery and deceit is genuinely German.”

 M In his book, Mein Kampf, Hitler refers to the Italian peo-
ple as that “bastardized, Negroid cauldron of impurity, the
Latin race.” 

Today this same Mussolini and this same Hitler to-gether
carry the white lily of racial purity as racial comrades!

For centuries Italy considered German militarism as its
traditional enemy. The slogan of the Risorgirnento was: Bas-
tone tedesco I talia no-n doma!—The German club will never
tame Italy! Today, not only has the Italian fascist regime
allowed the "northern barbarian” to reach the Brenner Pass
with the brutal annexation of Austria, thereby endangering
the territorial integrity and national independence of Italy,
but, in submission, it apes Hit1erism’s goose-step and its racial
policy. Thanks to Mussolini and his regime, Italy has now
become a satellite of Hitler’s Greater Germany.

On February 16, 1938, the organ of the Italian Foreign

‘Ministry, Informazione Diplomatica, with perfect duplicity

announced: .. '

, Y! AVA‘. ,...M ,..\.,.,...»,.............,.W 44 .

“The Italian government has never thought and is not now
thinking of adopting political, economic or moral measures against
the Jews as such, except, of course, in the case of elements hostile
to -the fascist regime.”

Meanwhile, a group of fascist “scholars” were already pre-
paring a report on racial policy under the direction of the
Ministry of Popular Culture. At first these “scientists” re-
mained anonymous, less out of professorial modesty, let us
hope, than a feeling of profound shame for their scientiﬁc
prostitution.

After a “careful study” of the race problem, on July 14,
1938, the anonymous "scholars” gave birth to their abortion.
Their report consisted of ten points, the most important of
which state that human races are a reality, that the conception
of race is purely biological, that it is untrue that large masses
of people settled in Italy in historical times, that a pure
Italian race now exists, that the present Italian population
is of Aryan. origin and Aryan civilization, that Jews do not
belong to this race, that the physical and psychological char-
acteristics of Italians must not be alt-ered in any way by con-
tamination with other races; and that, therefore, Italy should
adopt a racial policy elevating the Italian to an ideal of
superior consciousness, because all that fascism has done in
Italy has had a racial foundation—Benito Mussolini, in his
speeches, having made frequent references to conceptions of
race.

A famous philosopher and political economist once truly
said that “nothing is so vile but that some professor will be
found to defend it.” The German "scholars” say that the
pure Aryans are tall, blond and blue-eyed. The Italian “schol-
ars” now say that the pure Aryans are short, dark and
black-eyed. However, the Rome-Berlin axis extends to Tokyo.

A group of Japanese "scholars” is carrying on a “careful

study” of its own which will establish that the purest Aryans

are short, yellow-skinned and almond-eyed. All this would
be farcical if it did not have tragic political implications.
These theories, we are asked to believe, are not the ravings of
monsters or diseased minds, but the considered utterances of
respectable professors, of “scholars,” of “scientists.”

The Italian professors who made up or were made to sign
the fascist racial report are as follows:

LINO BUSINCO, Assistant Professor of General Pathology,
University of Rome e A

LIDIO CIPRIANI, Lecturer on Anthropology and Ethnology,
University of Florence

ARTURO DoMAGG:o, Director of the Neuro-psychiatric Clinic,
University of Bologna I

LEONE FRANZI, Assistant at the Clinic of Children’s Diseases,
University of Milan

Qumo LANDRA, Assistant Professor of Anthropology,
University of Rome

MARCELLO RICCI, Assistant Professor of Zoology,
University of Rome A .

NICOLA PENDE, Professor of Endocrinology, University of Rome

Professor Pende, one of the authors of this report, only
three years ago published a study in Nuova Antologia'bacl<-
ing the theory that the Italian people did not belong to the
Aryan race, but to the Mediterranean race.‘ No serious and
honest scientist really believes in the existence of a pure
Aryan race, either in Germany or elsewhere. A great Italian
anthropologist, Giuseppe Sergi, long ago demonstrated the
stupidity of the Aryan myth. Another Italian, Napoleone
Colajanni, the sociologist, in his book Latini e Anglosassoni,
fought against all racial theories aswithout scientiﬁc foun-
dation.

What is an Aryan? Dr. Franz Boaz, one of the great scien-

tists of our times and at present Professor of Anthropology ‘

at Columbia University, says:

 

“Aryan is nothing more than a linguistic term to denote that at
one time there was a language now called the Aryan language,
which was gradually -diffused and spread over a great part of
Europe and Asia, and was the origin of all the different Aryan
languages spoken today. . . . In this sense an Aryan is whoever
speaks an Aryan language, be he Swedish, American Negro or
Indian.” ‘

For its meeting of October 6, 1938, the Fascist Grand Coun-

cil had as the first point on the agenda a discussion on the
racial problem. In publicizing this agenda, the following
declaration was made to the press: -

"The Italian race question is put forward as a question of the
day also ‘because of the integrity of our traditions and culture, an
integrity which will be defended by individualizing and strengthen-
ing a Roman-Italic type on a biological basis differing from the
Latin or Germanic type.

“While Germanic man ﬁnds Absolute Reality only in himself
and tends to ‘realize’ God in his soul; while Latin man believes in
a Divinity which he cannot and will not comprehend and which he
passively accepts as is, in an act of faith which transcends and
overwhelms him; on the otherhand, the Roman-Italic man believes
in God, the Creator——preexistent and omnipotent—but makes an
effort to know His law and carry it into effect in the. world be-
cause he is certain of God’s goodness and the power of the human
will whenever he interprets and actuates the true nature of man.”

A more grotesque charlatanry is difﬁcult to imagine. If the
joke of a pure Aryan race is already ridiculous in Germany
where innumerable races and ethnic groups have crossed each
other throughout the centuries, this theory reaches the heights
of buffoonery when applied to the Italian people. Just a
superficial knowledge of history is suﬂicient to recall that

few countries have had as complicated a crossing of races as

the Italian peninsula and the two islands of Sicily and Sat-
dinia. In ancient times, even before Rome had risen as a power
which uniﬁed Italy under its imperial domination, Italy. was
invaded and colonized by the most diverse peoples from
Northern Africa, the Aegean, the Balkans and from Central
and Northern Europe. This inﬂux continued and was intensi-

‘ ﬁed under the Roman Empire and received an even greater

impulse with the decline and decay of the Empire.

For almost three thousand years, as far back as our his-
toric and prehistoric’ knowledge goes, what today is Italy
was the great crossways at which met and fused almost all the
knowniraces of Europe, Northern Africa and Northwestern
Asia. Phoenicians, Carthaginians, Mauretanians, Greeks,
Thracians, Macedonians, Huns, Goths, Visigoths, Lombards,
Franks, Normans, Scandinavians, Spanish, Saracens and
Semites came in swarms to Italian soil and, either as con-
querors or simple immigrants or prisoners of war, rooted them-
selves there, bringing their customs, their religions, and that
extraordinary diversity of types and dialects which today is a
characteristic of Italy.

Even today, after centuries of fusion and amalgamation, we
find an obvious difference among the people of the various
regions of Italy. Between a Sicilian and a Venetian, a Cala-
brese and a Lombard, a Sardinian and an Emilian, a Neapol-
itan and a Piedmontese, a Tuscan and an Abruzzese, etc.,
there are such differences of stature, of complexion, of lan-
guage, of habits and customs, as to make them seem almost
of different races.

In this cauldron in which ferments the residuum of a
hundred ethnic invasions, how can one speak of a pure Ital-
ian race?
