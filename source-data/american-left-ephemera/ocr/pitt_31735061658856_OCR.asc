YOUNG COMMUNIST LEAGUE
60 Duttenhofer Bldg.
Cincinnati, Ohio

July 24, 1939.

Dear Friend:
BOY, are we proud! And are we happy: Oh. pardon us, we'll let you in

on it. Our State Secretary,  T   P S 

is the new National VICE PRESIDENT OF THE YOUNG COMMUNIST LEAGUE OF
THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. The delegates to the recent 9th Nation-
al Convention cf the YOL elected him with rousing cheers.

Well, we're having a "' "‘ ‘ IN HIS HONOR
Sunday, July coin.

You can see that this picnic will not be an ordinary run of the mill
affair. We're seeing to that.

WE KNOW A SWELL PLACE IN BURNET WOODS where we can play hell. But
not only that. There is a shelter house there, too. It's supplied
with electricity. We're going to use it for a little theatre and
dance floor. We're going to have an electric phonograph with plenty
of records: DANCE MUSIC, "Pins and Needles" songs, PICKET LINE ,  
PRISCILLA, songs by the Red Army Chorus and songs by “Leadbelly" the
famous Negro folk song singer.

AND TO TOP IT ALL.A VARIEEY PROGRAM featuring a skit, "Mr. Dies Tries
The YCL" will be given. Also on the variety program will be soles of
"Socialism In Swing", “Ferdinand Chamberlain the Bull” and the new
YOL song written by two of our own Oincy YOLers.

And something none of you want to miss-~ GREETINGS FROM BOB ’
THOMPSON;

WHEN WE THINK OF BOB THOMPSON we can't help thinking of our main
slogan and theme of work, "Character Building and Education In the
Spirit of Socialamn." Bob was one of the hundreds of American YCLers
who went to Spain tc fight on the side of democracy and peace against
the fascist invaders. He was a captain there, a leader of men in a
situation that calls for a real Communist character, outlook and
vision. Beck in Ohio, he is carrying on the same type or leadership
embodied in work for the better life of Ohio's young people. And that
is what this picnic means to us, a gathering of our members and
friends who in their own way are carrying on the same struggle for

Democrdcy. Peace, Jobs and Security.

WE ARE ACCEPTING RESERVATIONS FOR LUNCHES. On receipt of a payment
of 15 cents we'wi11 prepare your lunch for the picnic. Reservations
