COMPILED BY NARMIC JUNE 1977

Documents obtained through the Freedom of Information Act have provided, for the
first time, the names of hundreds of companies across the United States that are
involved in the manufacture and export of munitions.

Under the Mutual Security Act of l954 and implementing regulations, "every person
who engages in the business of manufacturing [or] exporting....any arms, ammunition,
or implements of war..." is required to register with the State Department and pay a
registration fee ranging from $l25 for one year to $500 for five years. The
following state-by-state list of munitions manufacturers and exporters is based on
the registration forms filled out by corporations and individuals in compliance with
those regulations.

If you find that there is a company on this list in your community or area, you may
want to consider the following:

l. what issues are raised by the work of this company? what part does its
work play in the export of violence and repression from the United States to the
developed and underdeveloped parts of the world? what does the activity of this
company in my community mean for the conversion of our society to an economically
sound and peacefully oriented nation?

2. what more do I need to find out about the work of this company? (CAUTION:
Registration with the State Department indicates a potential for munitions manu-
facture or export but does not prove that a company is actually doing it right
now. The names on this list can be publicized--through local newspapers, radio,
or TV-—but more research should be done before starting a local project focusing
on a company. Local research of this type is ideal for a student group and the
effort of research can help get an action project going. You may find that
there are more military contractors in your area than what appear in this list,
as most companies are listed by headquarters and not by local subsidiaries.)

3. what should I do about it? (There are many good examples of company-
focussed local campaigns from the '60's and from the B-1 Bomber/National Peace
Conversion Campaign. New projects should be linked, if possible, to national is-
sues such as human rights and disarmament and the effort to cut military spend-
ing and transfer the funds to meet local needs.)

NARMIC (National Action/Research on the Military Industrial Complex) is a project of
the American Friends Service Committee. NARMIC can supply local organizers with
further information on companies in this list or on military contracting in their
counties (send $3.00 per company or county to cover research and copying costs).
Also recommended: “The Political Economy of Arms Sales" (50¢) and "Merchants of
Repression: U.S. Police Exports to the Third world" (25¢; both available from PED
Resources, AFSC, l50l Cherry St., Philadelphia, Pa. l9l02).

For more copies of this Directory write NARMIC, l50l Cherry St.,
Philadelphia, Pa. l9l02. Single copies, $l each plus 25¢
postage; ten or more, 60¢ each.
