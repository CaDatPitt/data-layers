tained and systematic attack on certain of our activities directly
related to the war effort, as well as on public morale generally.”
Americans must recognize that this sort of attack is not “free
speech” but direct and substantial military ‘aid to our enemies,
more destructive in Detroit than enemy bombers.

If Nazi warplanes were to‘ appear in the skies over Detroit
tomorrow and unleash a load of death and destruction, we would
rise up in just anger to destroy our enemy. We would re-enter
factories and offices with a new, fresh and unparalleled deter-
mination to work, fight and sacrifice for victory. It was that way
in London, in Chungking, in Moscow. The enemies in our midst
are attacking us now with the high explosives of defeatism and
the incendiary bombs of race hatred and disunity to destroy our
morale and disrupt our production. They are accomplices to the
murder by the Axis of our sons and our brothers on the field of
battle. Shall we regard them with less anger, and fight them with
less vigor?

By silencing Social justice we have destroyed one enemy
weapon. Yet the man who wielded that weapon is still free.
Father Coughlin has committed sedition against America, and
we have no guarantee that the man who said “I take the road to
Fascism” will not find other methods of resuming his attack
upon us.

The people of Detroit should demand that Father Coughlin
be indicted, arrested, tried, and lodged in a prison cell where he
belongs.

III Gerald L. K. Smith
Takes Over

HEN the United States Government took action against
Father Coughlin, Gerald L. K. Smith decided that lib-
erty in America was in grave peril.

The chairman of the Committee of One Million called his
followers together for a special meeting at the Maccabees Build-
ing Auditorium on April 24, summoning them with printed ad-
mission tickets upon which was printed the challenging question:
“Will we permit the Reds to Jail Father Coughlin?”

An overflow crowd of more than 1,000 persons turned up.
The admission tickets had promised them “the most fearless ad-
dress ever made in Detroit,” and they were keyed up to that ex-
pectation. When Smith thundered, “The Reds, the Communists,
and the Christ-killers have vowed they’ll never rest until Father
Coughlin and Gerald L. K. Smith are behind bars,” a thousand
faces shone with horror and hate.

When Smith painted a hair-raising spectacle of Reds over-
running America with copies of The Daily Worker and the
New Masses, plotting to get Earl Browder out of jail and to
put honest patriots like Coughlin, Smith, Lindbergh, and Nye in
prison, and to sell America to the Soviet Union and/or the
British Empire, a collective shudder swept the hall.

When Smith, raising his booming voice to a shout, swore:
“The day that they take Father Coughlin or Gerald L. K. Smith
away on a train, is the day when there won’t be a Communist
newstand or bookstore left in Detroit!” there wasn’t a man or
woman in the room who wasn’t ready to march out and do vio-
lence.

When Smith proposed that the Committee of One Million
call a giant mass meeting at Olympia, and invite Father Coughlin
to speak on “any subject closest to his heart,” the enthusiasm of
the audience knew no bounds.

‘Social Justice’ Becomes ‘Cross and Flag’

In defending Father Coughlin, Smith is defending an old-
time friend and fel.low—worker, whose technique the former
Louisiana rabble-rouser imitates. Both Coughlin and Smith cloak
their defeatist efforts behind a shield of religion; Smith’s present
battile-cry is “Christ First in America.” Many of Smith’s followers
are present or former members of Coughlinite organizations, and
were avid readers of Social ]ust1'ce. When the Government took
steps to suppress that periodical, Gerald L. K. Smith announced

[9]

 

  

   

the publication of his new monthly magazine, The Cross and the
Flag. Theweek after Social justice announced its suspension,
the downtown street corners in Detroit formerly occupied by
salesmen for the Coughlin weekly were taken over by salesmen
for The Cross and the Flag. In effect, the new magazine put out
by Gerald L. K. Smith is a continuation of Social fustice; both
peddle exactly the same line of pro-Axis propaganda.

Before examining in detail Smith’s present activities, it is
worth while to review briefly some of the little—known facts about
the demagogue’s background—facts about which Smith, for ob-
vious reasons, says very little today.

Skeletons In the Closet

Gerald L. K. Smith started his career as a pastor of a fash-
ionable church in Shreveport, Louisiana, but soon abandoned the
ministry for a more lucrative profession. He continued, however,
to use the title “Reverend” until recently. The noble work for
which he gave up his church was to help Huey Long build his
“Share the Wealth” movement—that corrupt and dictatorial ma-
chine by which Long hoped to catapult himself to the Presi-
dency. Smith’s share of the wealth of Louisiana, according to his
associates of the period, was $650 a week.

In 1933; on the day that Hitler took power in Germany, Wil-
liam Dudley Pelley had a “vision,” according to his own testi-
mony, and the “vision” led him to form the first avowedly pro-
Nazi organization in America, the Silver Shirt Legion. The holder
of membership card No. 3223 in the Silver Shirts, and, in fact, an

organizer for the movement, was the Reverend Gerald L. K.
Smith.

It was on August 5, 1933, that Smith wrote to Fuehrer
Pelley: '

“By the time you receive this letter I shall be on the road
to St. Louis and points north together with a uniformed
squad of young men comprising what I believe will be the
first Silver Shirt storm troop in America.”

Pelley stuck with his Silver Shirts, and as a result has been
jailed by the Federal Government for sedition. By 1936, however,
Pe»lley’.s lieutenant had moved on to a bigger and more respectable
crusade—to “drive that cripple out of the White House.” The
person referred to is President Roosevelt; the phrase is Smith’s
own, spoken from the platform of the anti-Roosevelt “grass roots
convention” sponsored by Governor Gene Talmadge of Georgia.
In those days Smith shocked many people by the violence of his
language against the President of the United States. “Commun-
ist” was the mildest of his epithets.

[10]

 

 

 

The anti-Roosevelt crusade brought him to Michigan for the
first time. He came seeking an alliance with the Townsend move-
ment and Coughlin’s National Union for Social Justice. Together
they planned the Union Party, with Rep. William Lemke as Pres-
idential candidate. In Illinois, Coughlin and Smith supported as
candidate for the Senate one Newton Jenkins, notorious anti-
Semite and frequent speaker at Bund meetings.

The newly-formed alliance was prematurely shattered when
the wires of the United Press brought a sensational story to De-
troit. It appeared in the Detroit News on October 20, 1936:

cis Townsend, Smith said.

“I want to save _the details for a
radio speech,” he said, "‘I will de-
liver it after ‘the political campaign,

when there will be less competition
for national attention.”

Townsend, horrified, made haste to repudiate Smith, and
from Chicago John Nuystul, national campaign manager of the
Union Party, issued a statement terming Smith’s action “so com-
pletely at variance with the principles of the Union Party that I
cannot too strongly denounce both Smith and those back of him
who are responsible. I want it distinctly understood that Smith in
no way represents the Union Party of Mr. Lemke.”

"In other words, Smith was ejected from Coughlin’s move-
ment for unpardonably allowing himself to be exposed as a Fas-
cist. I ‘

From 1937 to 1939 Smith devoted his talents to another “cru-
sade,” this time against organized labor. He hired himself out to
anti-labor employers wherever his services were '“needed.” In

April, 1938, it was Mansville, New Jersey, where his intervention
forced the National Labor Relations Board to postpone an elec-
tion at the Johns-Manvil-1e Corporation, and charge the employer
who imported him with intimidation and coercion against the
workers. (Lewis H. Brown, President of Johns-Manville, has
been a heavy financial backer of Smith’s Committee of One Mil-
lion.) In June, 1938, it was Akron, Ohio, where Smith fought the
United Rubber Workers of America. In August, 1938, it was
Cleveland, O’hio—then Toledo . . . From city to city Gerald L. K.
Smith used his technique of fantastic and violent Red-baiting
against working men and women seeking their democratic right
to organize in unions of their own choosing.

With this background Gerald L. K. Smith came to Detroit.

Union Busting Pays Profits

No other city in the United States had kept a welcome mat
out for Gerald Smith very long. Cleveland had said goodbye to
him with the comment: “He smel-ls of Fascist Ku Kluxers a mile
away.” (Cleveland News, August 5, 1938.) Akron had shown him
the door with this parting shot: “He still impresses us as having
Fascist ants in his pants.” (Akron Beacon-Journal.) He had left
Chicago in November, 1938, unable to pay a hotel bill in the
amount of thirty-five dollars and forty-one cents.

But Detroit had played host to Fritz Kuhn when the Bund
Fuehrer, working as a chemist at the Ford Motor Company, was
building his storm troop band. Detroit had given birth to the
Black Legion. Detroit had nurtured Coughlin. Smith stayed and
prospered. He made his living by waging war upon the United
Automobile Workers Union.

While President of the UAW, Homer Martin was clandes-
tinely taking money from the Ford Motor Company as payment
for a Red-baiting campaign to split and destroy the labor union
in the auto industry. Meeting with Martin secretly, speaking at
anti-CIO rallies arranged behind the scenes by Martin lieuten-
ants, was Gerald L. K. Smith. In no time at all Smith was able to
obtain finances to enable him to begin weekly radio broadcasts
over Station WMBC, and within a few months over Station WJR,
most expensive in Michigan. According to the testimony of two
Martin adherents who broke with him and joined the UAW-
CIO, much of the material for the anti-labor propaganda Smith
used on the radio was "obtained directly from Martin and his
industrial backer.

In November, 1939, when the Chrysler workers were on
strike, Smith sponsored a huge anti-CIO rally at Olympia, called
upon the workers to give up the strike, and termed the leaders of
the union a “ruthless set of gangsters.”

[12]

 

 

Despite Martin, Smith and Company, Detroit’s auto-workers
organized under the leadership of the UAW-CIO. War came and
Gerald L. K. Smith became a Crusader for Peace. Meetings of the
Committee of One Million, as Smith euphemistically named his
organization, featured as speakers some of the leading members
of the isolationist bloc in Congress. Curiously, most of those who
spoke for the Committee of One Million were the same Congress-
men who have since found themselves in hot water as a result of
their co-operation with the extensive propaganda activities of Mr.
George Sylvester Viereck, Nazi agent.

Smith’s contacts with the “peace movement” in Chicago were
of an even more suspicious nature. On a number of occasions
Smith spoke at meetings of the Citizens Keep America Out of

War Committee, whose chairman, Avery Brundage, was so openly
anti-Semitic that the America First Committee quietly dropped
him from its national committee. One of the Citizens Commit-
tee’s leaders was Captain William G. Grace, with whom Smith
occasionally appeared on the same platform. Grace was a con-
tributor to William Dudley Pelley’s anti-Semitic and pro-Hitler
magazine, Roll Call.

Today Gerald L. K. Smith operates a large, mysteriously-
financed organization from an expensive suite of offices cover-
ing the entire twentieth floor of the Industrial Bank Building;
he employs more than twenty office workers to get out his ex-
tensive mailings; he broadcasts regularly over Michigan’s most
expensive radio station, WJR’; he is planning a campaign to cap-
ture the Republican nomination for the United States Senate;
and he publishes a new monthly magazine, The Cross and the
Flag. Pearl Harbor or no Pearl Harbor, war or no war, Smith still
continues to expand his activities for appeasement and disunity.

He still baits labor and labor’s leadership. Witness the fol-
lowing quotation from the April 19, 1942, issue of The Cross and
the Flag:

“Walter Reuther is the much publicized labor leader and
will bear watching. Many of the suggestions made by Mr.
Reuther sound plausible at first. Upon careful investigation
they fit into the fine mosaic pattern for State Capitalism and
Communism. . . . It is bad enough to have certain politicians
kow-towing to the Reuthers, and we may have to swallow
that, but we are not going to turn guns over to the Reuthers
and their goon squads.”

Another article in the magazine bears the headline, “We Are
Against Hillman!”

Smith’s speeches contain tirades against union workers as
“crap-shooting, dishonest, Communist loafers,” whom he contrasts
with “old-fashioned Christian workers,” who follow the leader-
ship of Gerald L. K. Smith.

“Let’s Bring Our Soldiers Home”

But, in general, the main enemy, as Smith sees it, are the
“Reds” and the Administration. In deference to the requirements
of national unity, Smith dares no longer directly to accuse the
President of being a Communist, as he did before Pearl Harbor.
But he hints at it mightly.

In the main editorial of the first issue of The Cross and the
Flag (April), entitled “We Take Our Stand,” he has this to say
about President Roosevelt and his advisors:

“ . . . we old-fashioned Americans do not propose to be city-

[14]

 

 

   

slicked by boondoggling bureaucratic politicians, Commun-
ists, British imperia-lists, (the Union Now Gang), and a
thousand and one other porch-climbers, ‘confidence’ men and
‘snake oil’ salesmen who are working day and night on can-
spiracies designed to compel us to swallow a hundred poison
pills in the name of wartime emergencies.”

Smith advises the United States to withdraw its armed forces
from the fields of battle to our own shores, and suggests that to
aid our Allies with raw materials “or munitions of war is equiva-
lent to treason. This is a clear statement of the military policy of
the Axis.

Like Coughlin, Smith counsels his followers to “offer him-
self to civilian defense.” In the manner of all other enemies of the
war effort, Smith tries to undermine confidence in Civilian De-
fense by Red-baiting it, and adds:

“Eleanor Roosevelt apparently thought this organization
was to be just a great big fine boonidoggling scheme. We, the
people, must insist that this organization . . . be kept clean.’’

Smith makes a special effort to keep his skirts clear of the
charge of anti-Semitism. Occasionally, however, the mask slips.
One such time was the _crisis in the ranks of the appeasement
movement caused by Charles A. Lindbergh’s speech. at Des
Moines, Iowa, when he openly espoused the doctrine of “Jewish
war guilt” so popular among Fascists the world over. Numerous
America First followers, even ardent ones like William Randolph
Hearst and the late Hughtjohnson, had hastened to repudiate
Lindbergh’s anti-Semitism.

However, to eliminate any confusion in the minds of his fol-
lowers, Smith raised the subject at the next rally of the Commit-
tee of One Million, on September 16, 1941. Here is how the
Detroit Times reported it:

“Smith, a chairman of the meeting, gave the opeming ad-
dress in which he lauded the stand by Lindbergh against
British propaganda, fewish groups and the Roosevelt ad-
ministration, who, he alleges, are dragging this country into
war. ‘

“ ‘For the benefit of the press, I want a rising vote on how
you people feel on this question-,’ Smith said. ‘We think it
was just dandy and we want them to know so.’

“The entire audience arose cheering.”

One of Smith’s chief lieutenants, and a frequent chairman of
Committee of One Million meetings, is the Reverend Leland L.
Marion, of Pontiac, Michigan. He and Smith are good friends and
close co-workers. During the entire week ending December 7,
1941, the Rev. Gerald Winrod, “the jayhawk Fuehrer,” publisher

[15]

 

of the violently anti—Semitic, pro-Nazi “Defender,” in Wichita,
Kansas, was in nearby Pontiac, holding daily “lectures.” Members
of the National Workers League and other Fascist groups in
Detroit made trips out to Pontiac to meet with him.

To large audiences Winrod thundered against Jews, Com-
munists and the Administration; distributed copies of his litera-
ture; showed motion pictures reflecting the Fascist Franco’s
point of ‘view on the Spanish war; and paid high‘ tribute to
Coughlin and Gerald L. K. Smith.

Winrod’s host during the entire week was Smith’s friend
and co-worker, Rev. L. L. Marion. Winrod’s “lectures” were held
in Marion’s “Christian Temple.”

Since the disbandment of the America First Committee’s De-
troit chapter, the Committee of One Million has become the
co-ordinating center for the activities of all Detroit’s pro-Hitler
elements. Many of the attendees at Smith’s meetings are known
Coughlinites. Members of the National Workers League attend
regularly. Until it was banned, Social fustice was sold at the door,
and sometimes inside the meetings, in strict violation of the rules
of the school which the City of Detroit obligingly made available
to Smith for his meetings. Outside the door, after the meetings,
William R. Lyman, Detroit’s most active peddler of anti-Semitic
literature, would take his stand and distribute his pamphlets, leaf-

lets and stickers. Many of the attendees of the Committee of One

Million meetings were good customers, and bought plentifully of
the output of Pelley, Edmondson, and the rest of the nation’s
leading publishers of pro-Hitler literature.

In Washington on. July 23 a Federal grand jury indicted 28
men and women as principals in a nation-wide seditious con-
spiracy to “obstruct and defeat” the war effort and undermine
the morale of the armed forces. Pelley and Edmondson, together
with Lyman, who distributed their literature at Smith’s meetings,
were among those indicted. Winrod, admirer of Smith and recent
guest at Marion’s church, was another. The Cross and the Flag
was named in the indictmentas one of t.he publications through
which this conspiracy was carried out. The publisher of The Cross
and the Flag, Gerald L. K. Smith, was not named in the indict-
ment. Why he was overlooked is indeed a mystery.

Clare Hoffman Lends A Hand

Gerald L. K. Smith has some well-developed contacts in the
Congress of the United States. Senator Robert R. Reynolds, the
Fascist-minded North Carolina isolationist, who is chairman of
the House Military Affairs "Committee, is a “very good friend”
of Smith, the chairman of the Committee of One Million is fond
of boasting. Another is Senator Gerald P. Nye.

Titles of articles on cover of Smith's new magazine, "The Cross and the Flag". show
plainly his intent to drive wedge between U. S. and allies, people and government.
Notice he blames Russia for sugar shortage. hints Britain seeks to destroy American
independence. that we are ﬁghting to "master the world"; tries to link Roosevelt,
Churchill, Cripps with Communism; tries to weaken morale of soldiers by hinting
that refugees will steal their iobs. These false issues tally closely with Axis propa-
ganda barrage. parallel "Social Iustice" line.

Nye and Reynolds both sent greetings to the first issue of
The Cross and the Flag, and subsequently, in an interview with
the United Press, endorsed its con.tents.

Rep. Roy 0. Woodruff of Michigan did an even greater
service for Smith. He inserted the editorial, “We Take Our
Stand,” from which we have quoted above, in the Congressional
Record, had thousands of reprints made, and sent them to Gerald
Smith for distribution. Very nice of Mr. Woodruff to have the
United States Government print up leaflets containing Fifth
Column propaganda for Gerald L. K. Smith to distribute—at cost!

Still another Congressional friend of Smith is Michigan’s Rep.
Clare E. Hoffman, best known for his hatred of organized labor.
Hoffman boasts that “my opposition to the New Deal policies
has been as consistent, as bitter, as determined, as that of anyone.”

This statement applies equally to his record of opposition to war
measures against the Axis. As a natural consequence, Hoffman,
has Gerald L. K. Smith’s comp.lete endorsement.

Smit.h~’s admiration for Hoffman is shared by many other
leading Fifth Columnists. Tens of thousands of copies of Hoff-
ma*n’s speeches, reprinted at cost by the Government Printing
Office and made available in franked envelopes which could be
mailed postage-free, were bought and distributed by .men such
as Charles B. Hudson, Omaha fascist; Gerald Winrod; and
David J. Baxter, head of‘ the ‘subversive “Social Republic
Society”. Hudson, Winrod and Baxter are all at the present time
under indictment for seditious conspiracy.

A Detroit anti-war group called “American Mothers”, which
is closely iinked with Smith’s Committee of One Million, dis-
tributed large quantities of one of these speeches, “Don’t Haul
Down the Stars and Stripes”. This is the speech in which Hoff-
man refers to President Roosevelt as “a Judas”.

Hoffman has helped Smith directly by inserting Smith’s pro--
paganda in the Congressional Record.

President Roosevelt made some remarks to a press conference
a few months ago about a “Cliveden Set” in Washington. Presi-
dent Roosevelt named no names, but it’s a pretty good bet that he
had in mind men like those members of Congress who show no
embarrassment in lending the prestige of their office to Fascist-
minded opponents of the war effort like Gerald L. K. Smith.

Smith is now a candidate for the Republican nomination for
the United States Senate. His campaign is designed to arouse dis-
content against necessary war sacrifices, an.d by means of shame-
less demagogy to organize this discontent into a statewide anti-
democratic, anti-war movement. Exploiting the rubber shortage,
for example, Smith makes his chief campaign slogan: “Tires for
Everybody”.

As we noted previously, many of Smith’s fellow-workers are
either in prison or under indictment and on their way to jail.
Obviously, Smith hopes that wrapping himself in the mantle of
political candidacy will serve to shield him from prosecution.

The American people need not fall for this ruse. Smith is
not a political candidate. He is a traitor. He is abusing the rights
and privileges of a democracy to carry on defeatist, pro-Axis
activities.

A prison, cell, not a Senate seat, is the place for Gerald L. K.
Smith. The more quickly the people of Michigan insist that
enemies of America be treated as such, the more quickly will the
day of final victory arrive.

IV The National Workers League

Swings Into Action

N 1938 THE Civil Rights Federation first called public
0 attention to Parker Sage. In an educational bulletin en-
titled “The Fascist Threat to Labor,” the Federation re-

ported:

“It is July 24, 1938. Swastikas are flying over the park, and a
representative of the German government is calling upon the
audience to support Hitler. The place is not Germany, or Austria,
or even Czechoslovakia. It is right here, in the Detroit Creamery
Park near Mt. Clemens.

“The next speaker is introduced as a representative of the
UAW! His name is Parker Sage.

“Sage makes an attack upon Negroes an.d Jews, and calls Ger-
many ‘the most democratic country in the world.’

“Who is this Parker Sage? He is an expelled member of the
Chevrolet Gear and Axle Local 235, UAW, expelled for being a
stool pigeon . . .”

In the same year, Sage founded the National Workers
League. Members of the new organization consisted principally
of Bundists, former members of the Black Legion, Coughlinites,
and like elements. Its purpose was to carry the Goebbels message
into the ranks of the automobile workers.

At first the League tried to burrow its way into the labor‘
movement through the Society of Tool and Die Craftsmen, Inc.,
a company union outfit headed by J. J. Griffin. For a period the
League held its meetings in Griffin’s office on the fifth floor of
the Garfield Building at 4612 Woodward Ave., and used Griffin’s
mimeograph machine to run off its “newsletters.” The Labor Day
1939 issue of the Tool and Die ‘Craftsmen’s official organ, the
Craftmezfs Clarion, carried the League’s advertisement. At a re-
cent meeting of the National Workers League, Sage boasted that
in the small tool and die shop where he worked, he controlled
enough votes among the 160 men in the shop to swing a pending
NLRB election away from the “Subversive, Jew-ridden” UAW-
CIO.

‘ Today Parker Sage awaits trial in Detroit, charged with sedi-
tious conspiracy. Co-defendants with him are Garland Alderman,
secretary of the National Workers League, and Virgil Chandler,
executive vice-president of the Seven Mile-Fenelon Improve-
ment Association, the organization formed to prevent occupancy
by Negro war workers of the Sojourner Truth federal war hous-

are charged with conspiring to block execution of the laws of the
United States and to deprive the Negro families of their civil
rights.

What they did was to foster the organization of a “picket
line” on the streets leading to the housing project, which on Feb-
ruary 28 prevented by force and violence the families of war
workers from occupying homes leased to them byjthe United
States Government. Scores were injured in the bloody attack.

On Friday night, March 6, 1942, this subject was on the
agenda of the regular meeting of the League, held on the second
floor of the Humber Building, 13535 Woodward Avenue, High-
land Park.

When Fascists Meet

The first speaker at the meeting was Garland Alderman, who
until America entered the war, was secretary of the Oakland
County chapter of the America First Committee. When the AFC
disbanded, he became secretary of the League.

Alderman read a letter from George Deatherage, founder of
the American Nationalist Confederation (official emblem, the
swastika). The letter stated that Deatherage had just been fired
from a job as chief engineer for a contracting firm building a
United States Naval Base, where he had access to military secrets,
and that his discharge was unfair.

A member of the audience commented: “The dirty Rosenfelt

' b . . . . . d !”, referring to President Roosevelt.

Alderman then read aloud from a circular currently dis-
tributed by the National Workers League:

“The idea of fighting for British Imperialism, making the
world safe for Communism and for imposing the fewish
banking system on all peoples of the world in the name of
the Atlantic Chart.er, written without legal authority by"
Roosevelt and Churchill when our Nation was supposed to be
neutral, is neither patriotic or American.”

Alderman then introduced the next speaker, Mr. Parker Sage.

“Churchill is almost ﬁnished,” Sage began. “I’ll give him
six weeks; by that time the faps Will be down in Australia.
The English will be broken completely. There won’t be a kike
left in the American nation a year after that. You won’t be
bothered by lousy niggersiand hebe problem you have now.
No, sir!”

Rambling on, Sage made references to Dorothy Thompson,
Walter Winchell, and Eleanor Roosevelt, which were for the most
part too obscene to be reprinted.

A few samples of seditious literature circulated in Detroit by the
National Workers League.

But the climax ofthe meeting was yet to come. Sage an- V

nounced “Ladies and gentlemen, I want to introduce the executive
vice-president of that gallant organization of Americans who at
this moment are fighting to keep dirty niggers out of the So-
journer Truth Homes here in Detroit.

“Here he is, the big fella, Virgil Chandler!”

“The big fella” outlined “the cause of the whites against the
blacks in this here Detroit Federal Housing trouble.” He ex-
plained his rise to leadership in the Seven Mile-Fenelon Improve-
ment Association.

“You see,” Chandler said, “it was nine months ago that the
government begin to make up its mind who was going to live
there, us who had been living there a long time, or the ‘jigs.’
Well, the ‘jigs’ got the Communists on their side and so you have
a race riot.”

Chandler concluded: “I came over to the National Workers
League to get some help. Today the government decided, for
keeps, they say, that the niggers was gonna live in the Sojourner
Truth project. _

“Well, we’ll see about that. We are going to throw a picket
line so thick about that place that there will be an eclipse of the
sun. I want all you white folks who believe like us to be over
there with whatever you can carry in your hands. If these blacks
think they can bluff us, we’re! going to give them another Fourth
of fuly.”

[21]

 

 

The battle of Sojourner Truth was the fruit of three and a
half years of activity by the League of sowing of race hatred. It
had distributed anti-democratic leaflets and pamphlets by the
thousands, at the gates of automobile plants and sometimes sur-
reptitiously inside. Its members plastered the washrooms of auto
plants with anti-Semitic stickers. They sought wherever possible
to inflame hatred among white and Negro workers. They dis-
cussed at their meetings the possibility of organizing boycotts
against Jewish neighborhood merchants. .

Gutter Propaganda

The National Workers League’s chief stock-in-trade is a
mimeographed weekly “newsletter,” containing propaganda studi-
ously imitative of Goebbels. It insists that the “Jews” and the
“international bankers” started the war (not Hitler), and that
practically every member of the Churchill and Roosevelt govern-
ments is a “Jew.”

A week after Pearl Harbor the newsletter said “The Asiatic
war picture indicates the probable to-tal defeat of Great Britain
and the U. S. A. within sixty days.” Its Christmas issue, 1941,
stated: “The closing of the year 1941 brings us to another mile-
stone in the march toward freedom of mankind from the shackles

- of Jewish internationalism.”

 

Besides its newsletter, the League distributes huge quantities
of treasonable material put out by Fifth Columnists throughout
the country. William Dudley Pelley’s “The Galilean,” a weekly
pro-Hitler magazine published in a pseudo-religious guise, was
sold by the League until the Federal Government pronounced it
seditious, banned its publication and jailed the publisher.

Another choice item hand-led by the League is “X-Ray,” a
four-page tabloid newspaper published by Court Asher, in
Muncie, Indiana, now barred from the mails as treasonous.

One of the League’s favorites, circulated in vast quantities,
is a reprint of an item by Robert Edward Edmonson purporting
to prove “Roosevelt’s Jewish Ancestry.” It contains an elaborate
“genealogical chart” and comments: “Roosevelt draws inevitably
upon his Semitic ancestry. It is, therefore, natural for him to be
a radical as it is for others to be true Americans. HE IS NOT
ONE OF US!”

Circulation of this American gutter version of Der Stuermer
may not have been a crime before Pearl ‘Harbor; but it certainly
comes under the head of sedition now.

During the pre-Pearl Harbor days, the members of the Na-
tional Workers League were also active members of the America
First Committee. Alderman was secretary of the AFC’s Oakland

[23]

 

County Chapter. Robert Vietig, executive secretary of the Detroit
chapter of the America First Committee, was once a guest speaker
at a meeting of the National Workers League.

Now, Gerald L. K. Smith has inherited the America First
Committee’s mantle, and all good National Workers Leaguers
attend meetings of the Committee of One Million, faithfully.

, Sage and Alderman are under indictment; but the remainder
of the National Workers League’s active membership is still at
large. Some of them are working in plants producing war mate-
rials for America and its allies. For example, Charles Dexter, a
former captain in the Black Legion and a labor spy, who has at
times acted as chairman or secretary of National Workers League
meetings, works at the Ford Motor Company. Permitting these
avowed enemies of America to fill places on the war production
lines is scarcely conducive to best results in the Battle for Pro-
duction. Use of our laws against sedition and treason to place
these people behind bars is wholly in order.

Mr. Dies Hits and Runs

A few months ago the people of Detroit were led to believe
that some action was going to be taken about this nest of traitors.
Agents of the Dies Committee raided Parker Sage’s home on
January 9, 1942, and announced that they had found proof that the
National Workers League had distributed fifteen thousand dol-
lars’ worth of subversive literature in six months. They also
seized the membership list of the organization.

Yet, once the headlines had been made, the Dies Committee
did . . . nothing. Sage was set free, with results now well known.
The members of the league continued to meet and carry on their
activities.

Who is financing the National Workers League? Fifteen
thousand do-llars is a lot of money. It didn’t come from the 500
members of the organization, which charges a mere 75c a month
dues. It didn’t come from Sage himself; his pay checks for the
whole past year were found in his home, uncashed. Representa-
tive Martin Dies, who once made public the membership list of
the American League for Peace and Democracy and has
used it as a blacklist ever since, ought to explain to the American
people why he is so secretive with the National Workers
League’s records.

Those who subsidize and finance Nazi activities are as
guilty as those who use that money for subversive purposes.
They, too, belong behind bars, where they can do no further
harm.

[23]

 

V. The Klan Invades

Democracy’s  Arsenal

HE NATIONAL headquarters of the Knights of the Ku

Klux Klan may still be at Atlanta, Georgia; but the prin-

cipal field of the Klan’s activities has actually been

s,h.if'ted from the deep South to Detroit. Since October, 1940,

Michigan Grand Dragon Charles Spare has been able to boast to

his chief, Imperial Wizard James A. Colescott, that there are more
Kluxers in Michigan than in any other state in the nation.

It is no accident. Since the war began in Europe, the leader-
ship of the Klan has been working night and day to give the pro-
gram and tactics of their organization a thorough face-lifting,
with an eye to strengthening its appeal to workers in the indus-
trial cities of the North, particularly in those cities which were
becoming major centers of war production, like Detroit.

The reasons for this shift are extremely important. When a
secret organization with a program so similar to the program of
the German-American. Bund that Fritz Kuhn once offered to
buy the Klan, bag and baggage, institutes a war-time campaign to
form units in every department of every munitions-producing
plant, it’s time for the people of America, and the Department of
Justice, to take notice.

There is already enough evidence at hand to make it clear
that the Klan, always a specialist in. the creation of domestic dis-
unity and turmoil, has undertaken to place its unique talents in
this field at the service of the Axis.

The history of the Klan in the ’Twenties is too well known to
require extensive comment here. Preying on illiteracy, prejudice
and insecurity, the Invisible Empire bui-lt up a powerful move-
ment, captured control of the political machinery of a number of
states, and in a reign of night-riding lawlessness became a major
menace to civil liberties in many localities. In Detroit, the Klan
became so strong that it was the major issue in the Mayoralty
election of 1929, and the Klan-backed candidate won.

But the Klan’s violent excesses, and the disclosure that its
promoters were coining fortunes in graft, produced a public re-
action that destroyed the Klan’s power and temporarily drove it
into obscurity. ‘

Until the CIO began its drive to organize millions of workers,
it was scarcely heard from. Then the Klan sprang suddenly to
life. It plastered the South with placards proclaiming: “CIO IS
COMMUNISM . . . THE K.LAN RIDES AGAIN.” Workers in
the steel and textile mil-ls were greeted with cross-burnings and

[24]

parades to discourage unionism. Floggings and tar-and-feather
treatment and even murder of “labor agitators” became the order
of the day.

This night-shirt vigilante movement found its most violent
expression in Detroit, in the form of the Black Legion. Founded
under the leadership of admitted ex-Klansmen, the Legion’s pro-
gram was scarcely distinguishable from that of the Klan, except
that the Black Legion more openly espoused murder as its
weapon. Two of its first victims were John L. Bielak and George
Marchuk, organizers for the Auto Workers Union.

The Black Legion was exposed and smashed in 1936; but
many of its members drifted back into the ranks of the Ku Klux
Klan.

Anti-labor employers were not the only ones who saw poten-
tial usefulness in the Klan’s program of dividing the workers by
inciting hatred against Negroes, Jews, Catholics, and the foreign-
born. On September 29, 1937, Fritz Kuhn, Hitler’s American gau-
leiter, and Hiram W. Evans, then Imperial Wizard of the KKK,
met secretly at the Hotel Bismark in Chicago. Kuhn there offered
to purchase the Klan and merge his Bund into it, to effect a
“native American” front for Nazi Fifth Column activities.

Evans rejected the offer. Nevertheless, when two organiza-
tions are so basically similar in program, it would be strange if
they failed to pursue parallel paths. They not only traveled in the
same direction, but on at least one occasion they held a joint pub-
lic meeting of Klan and Bund units. On August 18, 1940, at the
Bund’s camp at Andover, New Jersey, Bund leader August Klap-
prott shared honors on the speakers’ platform with Arthur H.
Bell, Klan Dragon for New Jersey, and Edward James Smythe, an
intimate associate of virtually every nationally known Fifth
Column leader in America, now under indictment for sedition.

[25]

    

 

In 1939, a new Klan figure appeared on the national horizon-
genial, ruddy-faced, pudgy James A. Colescott, ex-veterinarian
from Terre Haute, Indiana. He was a man of ideas and of action,
and he promised a four-year “administration of action” in defense
of the interests of the “native-born, white, Protestant, Gentile
population.”

Meantime, the Klan in Detroit was pursuing its anti-union
aim by throwing its support behind the attempt of Homer Martin
to wreck the UAW-CIO by Red-baiting and factionalism. One
of Martin’s chief lieutenants was Harvey Hanson, of whom we
shall have more to say.

By May, 1941, Colescott’s streamlined program was ready to
move into high gear.

Early in May of 1941, Charlie Spare and several of his asso-
ciates motored down to Atlanta to attend the Imperial Kloncil-
ium, or annual convention, of the Ku Klux Klan. Important de~
cisions were made at this meeting. One was that the Klan would
immediately start to raise a million dollars for a giant nation-wide
“Americanization” program, with such innocuous and popular
slogans as “Unity” and “Americanism” as its theme. Another was
that the Klan would concentrate its activities in vital war in-
dustry and army camps. A third was the singling out of Detroit
for special efforts.

Returning home, Spare sent out an urgent call for the top
Kleagles. and Klansmen to assemble in special Klonvocation at the
Danish Brotherhood Hall at Twelfth and Forestzin Detroit. There
Spare and the guest of honor, Imperial Wizard Colescott, out-
lined the newly adopted program.

Instead of fighting the union openly, all Klansmen were to

join and work from within the UAW-CIO. A military style‘ of
organization was adopted. Klansmen in each factory department
were to make up a “squad” to be headed by a “corporal.” Corporals
were to report to a “lieutenant,” who was to be responsible for an
entire division of a plant. The lieutenants in turn were subordi-
nate to a “major.” Each industrial unit such as Ford, General
Motors, Chrysler, and Briggs, was to have a major in charge.
Heading the entire set-up would be “General” Harvey Hanson,
former aide to Mr. Homer Martin.
Another striking innovation in Klan activity was explained
at this secret meeting by Colescott in these words: I
“Klansmen must carry on an investigation of every man in
the department of the plant where he works..This has to be
carried through the entire state, yes, the entire nation. We
must know his politics, his nationality, religion, what he
thinks, or anything else connected with him.”

[25]

 

 

All the information thus gathered, Colescott explained, was
to be entered in triplicate on cards, one copy to be filed by the
Klan. Colescott failed to explain what would happen to the other
two copies.

It was also decided to start classes for its members in parlia-
mentary law, blue-print reading and other subjects—knowledge
useful for penetrating the unions.

Finally, Colescott disclosed that the Klan would take its
phoney message of “Americanization” and “Unity” directly to the
public through the radio. 7

With this elaborate machinery the Klan would be ready to
commence a tremendous recruiting drive. Five thousand new
members a month was not to be considered too high a goal.

Not mentioned at the May 18 Convention, but actually an im-
portant part of the Klan’s program, was a plan to establish work-
ing relationships with certain employers to assure Klansmen of
key jobs. Whether or not the Klan’s private Gestapo system was
to be made available to employers in return for such favors, we
will know only when a thorough investigation is made.

This program soon brought results. Its effects began to be
felt in the factories, among the nationality and racial groups in
Detroit and in the unions. In April, 1942, Packard Local No. 190,

of workers in Detroit and Michigan, and the cause of democracy

If no Fifth Column, willing to do the work of the Axis, were

present and at work in Detroit, Hitler would have to create one.

Unfortunately for us, and fortunately for Hitler, there are
men in Detroit whose contempt and hatred for democracy is such
that they are willing to give aid, comfort and assistance to the
enemy to achieve their goal of a fascist America.

These traitors have at their disposal organizations, money,
printing presses, radio time, and friends in Congress. They use
these facilities in an ever-increasing assault on the unity and
morale of our peop-le. They seek to poison our minds with Hitler’s
propaganda of defeatism. They encourage their followers to acts
of disruption and sabotage. They strive to block the full mobiliza-
tion of our people for an all-out war.

Not long ago President Roosevelt drew an analogy between
our present-day Fifth Columnists and the Quislings of another
American generation, the Copperheads of the American Civil
War, northerners who opposed and obstructed the Union’s war
against the Slave Power of the South. When Abraham Lincoln,
during the darkest days of the Civil War, adopted measures to
suppress the Copperhead Fifth Columnists, faint-hearted Ameri-
cans protested that his actions might lead to loss of civil liberties
for all. Lincoln answered them:

“Under cover of ‘liberty of speech,’ ‘liberty of the press,’ and
‘habeas corpus,’ they (the rebels) hoped to keep on foot
amongst us a most efficient corps of spies, informers, sup-
pliers and aiders and abettors of their cause in a thousand

UAW-CIO, placed Frank Buehrle, leader of the KKK at Pack-
ard, on trial. The specific charge against Buehrle was slandering
another member of the union in the course of a local election
campaign. But a lot more than that came out.

Curt Murdock, President of Packard Local, described before
the trial board the visits Buehrle and another Packard Klansman,
Simon Patton, had made to his office on a number of occasions.
On one such occasion, Murdock left the door of his ofﬁce open,
by pre—arrangement, so that the other officers of the union in an
adjoining room could verify what took place.

This is what occurred, in Murdock’s words:

“I showed Buehrle the 12-point program I was going to
present to the local meeting. Embodied in this program was
the civilian defense, the sale of defense bonds and stamps,
the conversion and seniority plan, and many other things
that the local leadership felt was essential to the (Victory)
program.

“Buehrle said, ‘Well, I would go easy with that plan.’

“I told him, ‘Nuts . . . this program is going to be pre-
sented.’

“At that time he threatened me that the Klan would be out
to get me; and this can be verified by Witnesses.”

“Q. What reason did he give for not carrying out the pro-
gram, for example, on the defense bonds?”

“A. (Murdock continuing): “He said this wasn’t a popu-
lar war, and the men in the plants would object strenuously
to the sale of bonds. He says, ‘What’s going to happen to the
money after the war is over? The government will beat us
out of it.’ ”

How “strenuously” the workers of Packard “objected” to
the sale of defense bonds by the Local was brought out by the
Financial Secretary of the local, Adam Poplawskiz

“I noticed from the re-turns that came in from the plant,
in the department in which there was Klan forces in opera-
tion the amount collected was considerably smaller than that
in departments Where there was seemingly no Klan activity.”

“Pit Race Against Race”

But it was not only through the sabotaging of the sale of
defense bonds and other phases of the union’s Victory program
that the influence of the Klan made itself felt in a serious way.

Several months ago two Negro metal-polishers were trans-
ferred in accordance with union seniority rules from civilian to
war production at the Packard plant. The transfer was greeted

[23]

 

by a small but loud group of workers with the threat of a strike
unless the Negro workers were removed. For months the union
was kept in an uproar over the issue. Work on vital aircraft and
marine engines was slowed down.

James Lindahl, Recording Secretary of Packard Local, No.
190, testified at the trial of Frank Buehrle:

“In my opinion, Brother Buehrle was the organizer of all
the anti-Negro sentiment in the plant. He was the organizer
of the threatened riot in the polishing room in defense, which
compelled the steward to send two Negro polishers back to
their original department. The Klan was responsible for
building up the anti-Negro sentiment, so that you had in
their very hall, expressions against the Negro people, ex-
pressions against permitting them their democratic rights
under the constitution and under the by—laws of this organ-
ization. The Klan was responsible, because every member of
the Klan was among the most Vocal and most vicious in
attacking the notion that Negro workers should have the
right to go on better jobs, transfer onto defense. The Klan
was the spearhead. '

“Then we openly fought the Klan, exposing the member-
ship, denounced it, and consequently all members of the
Klan ran for cover. We found that with them had gone all
the organized opposition to the Negro. As a consequence,
these two same Negro polishers were quietly transferred onto
defense last Tuesday. There was no disturbance, no undue
commotion, and today they are working in perfect harmony,
in perfect peace, side by side with white workers.”

The Ku Klux Klan systematically utilized anti-Negro preju-
dices among the rank-and-file in order to disrupt production and
to create disunity and turmoil.

This incident at Packard has been paralleled in a number
of other plants since then—and each such incident has been
more serious than the previous one.

At the beginning of June a “strike”, instigated by a handful
of men in opposition to the upgrading of Negro workers, shut
down the Dodge Truck plant, busy on ‘vital war orders. A few
weeks later an identically-staged “strike” brought war work at the
Hudson Naval Ordnance Arsenal to a standstill, and made idle
8,000 workers. .

Numerous other instances like these, not only in Detroit, but
in many other leading industrial centers of America, can be cited.

The UAW-CIO has adopted a vigilant and firm attitude to-
ward the Klan within its own ranks. Recently George Addes,

[39]

 

 

 

Secretary-Treasurer of the International Union, wrote to the
president of one of the local unions:

“The International is on record as utterly opposed to all
such organizations as the Ku Klux Klan, which we have
reason to believe is carrying on a subversive role in» the de-
fense industry. There is evidence that Nazi agents are now
working through such undercover groups as the 

“We must urge that you and your fellow oﬁicers take
every precaution against disruption from these sources. As
you probably are aware, the  is growing steadily more
active in a number of locals and deﬁnitely is a menace that
must be fought.” .

R. J. Thomas, President of the UAW-CIO, stated the official
position of his union toward the Klan when he said:

“ . . . There is no room within the ranks of the UA W-CIO
for the Ku Klux Klan or its activities. Efforts of the Klan
to inject itself into our local unions should be resisted to the
utmost by our membership and its officers. The UA W-CIO
does not need the assistance of the Imperial Wizard Cole-
scott or of any of his deluded followers. Colescott’s charge
that the CI 0 is in the hands of the Communists is merely
the stock in trade of his racket.

“The UA W-CIO is an American organization and makes
no distinction because of race, creed, or color. It will not
tolerate Colescott and his associated bigots who if they had
their way would divide our Nation and our union into war-
ring groups. My advice to Colescott is to pack his bag.
Detroit does not need him.”

The union has implemented this policy statement with ﬁrm
action in each specific situation. At Packard the union suspended
Buehrle, the Klan leader. At the Hudson Arsenal the disrupters
were promptly ejected both from the union and from the plant.
At its annual convention in Chicago in August, 1942, the UAW-
CIO demanded that “proper governmental authorities investigate
immediately the activities and connections of the un-American
Ku Klux Klan, which has played a large role in the recent
strikes against the employment of Negro workers in war plants”.

Poison For Soldiers and Sailors
The Klan carries its disunity not only into the shops but
also into the training camps of the Army and Navy. Consider,
for example, the campaign launched against the United Service
Organizations by the Klan, in the August, 1941, issue of its of-
ﬁcial organ, The Fiery Cross:
“It must be remembered that the Catholics pushed their

[30]

 

way into the army during the last war and set up their own
recreation buildings and propaganda centers. . . . Again the
Catholics have the official backing of the government at
Washington, and millions of Americans are being called upon
to give money to support the Catholic propaganda thru
the USO . . . ”

“. . . Some people and many newspapers would like to test
one’s patriotism by the amount given to support the Catholic
propaganda centers in the military camps of the country.”

In the same issue of the Fiery Cross, Colescott calls upon
Klansmen to make certain that their message of disunity reaches
the soldiers and sailors:

“It is time for the Ku Klux Klan to distribute real Ameri-
can literature into every army and navy camp in the land.
Place the Fiery Cross and other Klan literature in public
recreational halls in camps and cities near camps.”

As we have noted previously, the Klan now hides behind a
smoke screen of chatter about unity and support of the war effort.
It is interesting therefore to read the comment of Colescott in the
Fiery Cross, December 1941 issue, published just after Pearl
Harbor: “When the war is over there will be time . . . for action
in opposition to those who put us in the war. Have no fear . . .
there will be a reckoning.”

That sentence has a familiar ring. It is the cry of all who
hold, not Hitler and the Japanese, but President Roosevelt and
the American people responsible for the war. It sounds like
Hitler himself in his violent speech the day Nazi Germany de-
clared war on this nation. It sounds like the accusations of “war
guilt” made by Petain and Laval at the Riom trials to conceal
their betrayal of their country!

The Washington grand jury which on July 23 indicted 28
pro-Nazi traitors for conspiracy against the war effort and
against the morale of the men in our armed forces named the
Ku Klux Klan, along with a number of other organizations, as
a partner in the execution of the conspiracy. Yet none of the
leaders of the Klan were actually indicted.

Forward-looking citizens have been demanding for years that
the government investigate and take action against the Invisible
Empire. There was good enough reason then, when the Klan was
organizing lynch terrorism against the Negro people, distributing
reprints of anti-Semitic literature like Ford’s The International
few, whipping up hysteria against Catholics and foreign-born,
endangering the liberties of all minority groups.

In 1942, toleration of this sort of service to Hitlerism invites
military disaster.

[31]

 

VI The Fifth Column Strikes: The
" Battle For Sojourner Truth

F WE HAVE referred many times in the preceding pages

0 to the Battle of Sojourner Truth, -it is because that

clash taught the people of Detroit lessons they cannot

afford to forget. It was unquestionably the most important blow
the Fifth Column has yet struck at Detroit. '

It is almost inconceivable that in a great industrial city in
wartime, a small band of a few hundred men could defy the forces
of law and order, flout the decisions of a war government about
a war project, precipitate a bloody battle, and deliberately foment
race hatred when a whole nation recognizes the imperative need
for unity. Yet it happened, and it is no mere accident that it hap-
pened in Detroit.

In the preceding chapter we have seen a multitude of Fifth
Columnist leaders and organizations for the most‘part pursuing
their separate ways, but maintaining points of contact and consul-
tation with one another. In the Sojourner Truth situation we shall
see all of the forces of Fascism in Detroit uniting to strike a
powerful blow at our nation’s war effort. ’ I V '

Negro and white workers labor side by side in the factories,
producing for victory, and greater numbers of Negro workers will
help man the assembly lines as our need formanpower steadily
increases. All must have housing, and the otherjnecessities that
make for high morale and efficientwork. Ina cosmopolitan city
like Detroit it is essential that the spiritfof 'u“nit'y for victory
among all races and creeds be increasingly"strengthened. ’

How better to throw a huge monkey wrench into the machin-
ery of production for victory than to create in Detroit a city-wide
spirit of racial hatred and animosity, precipitate a race riot of
great proportions, and set Americans fighting one another in-
stead of Hitler? In the Sojourner Truth situation Detroit’s Fifth
Column set "out to create disunity, chaos and race war.

Background For Conspiracy

The United States Government built for. the families of
Negro war workers in the City of Detroit a hous.ing project of
two hundred homes, as part of.the same project that included
five hundred homes for white workers, long since completed and
occupied just outside of Detroit in Centerline, Michigan. The
project was named for an outstanding Negro heroine of Ameri-
can history. Sojourner Truth was an Abolitionist, and helped mo-

[33]

 

 

bilize the people of Michigan, Negro and white alike, in support
of President Lincoln during the Civil War.

Before the project was completed a group of real estate op-
erators, who had marked out the largely-undeveloped area around
Nevada and Fenelon Avenues as “their” territory, began a cam-
paign to have it switched from Negro to white occupancy. With
the help of Congressman Rudolph G. Tenerowicz of Detroit, they
enlisted the aid of the business-as-usual National Real Estate
Board, which maintains a powerful lobby in Washington, and a
group of Southern Congressmen from the Poll Tax states, who
oppose government housing for Negroes on general principles.
By threatening to block passage of a vitally needed new war
housing appropriation bill by bottling it up in a Committee which
they controlled, the P011 Taxers persuaded Federal housing offi-
cials to change the project to white occupency.

Negro organizations in Detroit and throughout the nation,
supported by virtually every important civic and religious body
in the city, protested against this clear act of discrimination
against Negro workers, who were in desperate need of decent
housing. Daily newspapers in New York, Washington, Philadel-
phia and other cities, the American Federation of Labor and the
Congress of Industrial Organizations, and other important na-
tional voices also spoke out in condemnation of the change. On the
recommendation of Mayor Jeffries, the Detroit Common Council,
the Detroit Housing Commission and these civic groups, the Fed-
eral Government again ordered that the project be occupied by
the Negro workers for whom it was originally intended.

The Axis Reaps A Harvest

The project was completed on February 1. The date for the
families to move in was set for February 28. What happened on
the morning of February 28 is now known throughout the world,
thanks to the Axis radio. A mob of rioters, calling themselves a
“picket line,” violently blocked occupancy of the project. Hun-
dreds were arrested, scores were injured, more than 15 requiring
hospitalization.

It was not until the end of April-—three months after the pro-
ject was completed—that the Government was able to enforce its
decision and allow the families to make use of the homes the
Government had leased to them.

If many Detroiters failed to recognize the significance of
this “race riot,” it cannot be said that the Axis enemy overlooked
it. On the morning of February 29, the propaganda radio of Ber-
lin and Tokio blared out the story to the entire world. They used
it to “prove” to the peoples of Latin America, India, China, and

Africa that Americans are liars when they talk about democracy
and liberation. Sojourner Truth must have been bad news to the
white, Negro and Filipino soldiers then fighting side by side
so heroically at Bataan!

Race prejudices die quickly when men of all races fight
shoulder to shoulder for the victory of common ideals in a des-
perate crisis, unless there are elements at work consciously sow-
ing the seeds of falsehood and mistrust that prevents unity.
Without a Fifth Column, Sojourner Truth would have been
quickly and easily settled. But Fifth Columnists flocked to the
scene of Sojourner Truth like bees to a honey pot.

The Sojourner Truth vi'o.len.ce followed weeks of we1l-organ-
ized incitement. The falsehood that property values would de-
cline if Negro families were to occupy the project, was widely
propagated to frighten honest but worried home owners into the
ranks of the “Seven Mile-Fenelon Improvement Association.”
Anonymous leaflets were distributed by the thousands, slander-
ously declaring: “We want our girls to walk the streets not
raped.” Sympathy throughout the city was. solicited upon the
basis of “keep-ing a 100% white neighborhood..white”—a lie which
concealed the fact that a we.ll-developed, long-established Negro
community exists in the same neighborhood. Petitions were dis-
tributed by Klansmen in the auto plants, charging {chat “Com-
munists are trying to provoke race riots.” In many places the peti-
tions were used as excuses to provoke fights. Mass meetings were
held, and in general a lynch atmosphere wasbuilt up.

Tenerowicz Helps ‘Hitler

No little contribution to the development of this conspiracy
was made by Congressman Rudolph Tenerowicz, representative
of the district in which the project is located. In the months pre-
ceding the final outbreak of violence, he worked closely with"the
leaders of the Improvement Association. He lobbied in Washing-
ton for them. He made a long speech on the floor of Congress
against Negro occupancy of Sojourner Truth, and supplied the
Improvement Association with thousands of reprints to be dis-
tributed by them.

In his speech Tenerowicz dealt with the question of “sub-
versive influences” at work in the Sojourner Truth situation. By
that he didn’t mean the National Workers League or the Ku Klux
K1an—he meant the broad array of community agencies working
for Negro occupancy of the project, whom he labelled “Reds.”

It was characteristic that the Congressman who has consist-
ently voted against measures for war against Fascism said at the
very beginning of the speech: “_I _am becoming more convinced
daily that the deadliest force threatening "America is not the fact

[34]

 

 

 

that some mad dictators are directing the world conflict that
rages across the seas, but rather it is the disintegrating force of
‘false and assumed leadership’ that is deliberately seeking to bore
from within the heart of America.” (emphasis ours.) He contin-
ued his speech by condemning the “false conception of racial
equality.” For his blast, he borrowed worn-out material from the
Dies Committee—which had never investigated the Ku Klux
Klan, and had so curiously dropped investigation and exposure
of the National Workers League.

Even after the indictment for seditious conspiracy of the
leaders of the forces with whom Tenerowicz was working, the
Congressman continued to fight the Government’s decision, and
demanded a Congressional “investigation” of the “subversive
activities” of those who fought for democracy and law and order.

Although. the Federal Grand Jury in Detroit implicated the
National Workers League in the Sojourner Truth conspiracy, it
failed to uncover the Ku Klux Klan’s role in the situation. The
Grand Jury might call in Mr. Charles Spare, Grand Dragon of
the Klan in the State of Michigan, and question him about the
three special meetings of the Klan held on Friday night, Febru-

ary 27—the night before the Sojourner Truth riot. One of these
meetings took place at 1515 East Eight-Mile Road. The second
was held at a hall at Nine-Mile Road and Van Dyke. The third
was at 12840 East Jefferson Avenue. And, while the Grand Jury
is questioning Mr. Spare, it might ask him about the fiery cross
that was burned in a field near the project the same night; and
it might ask him for the names of the Klansmen at Dodge, Chrys-
ler, Ford, Packard and other plants who were responsible for cir-
culating the anti-Negro petitions which Congressman Tenero-
wicz nows keeps under lock and key at his office in Washington.

The people of Detroit have given a ringing, united answer
to Tenerowicz, the Klan and the National Workers League. High-
ranking leaders of the Catholic, Protestant and Jewish faiths,
Social Agency leaders, nationality, civic, fraternal, youth and
Negro organizations have all stood firmly behind the decision of
our Government. The Mayor and the Governor have made it pos-
sible to enforce this decision despite the continuing threat of
Fifth Column violence.

The sentiment of Detroit’s auto workers was put to a dra-
matic test by R. J. Thomas at the recent Emergency War Con-
ference held recently by the UAW-CIO in Detroit. Here is the
account from the United Auto Worker for April 15:

“During the discussion of the (Sojourner Truth) issue at
the conference, Thomas recalled that Rep. Rudolph Tenero-
wicz, Michigan, has stated in the House that the majority of
the UA W-CIO members are opposed to Negro occupancy.

“Thomas took the occasion to test out the sentiment of the
U A W, as represented by the 1,400 delegates to the War Emer-
gency Conference. He called on all who favored Tenerowicz’s
position to rise. There was not one standee. He then called
on those who favored the position he had taken. The dele-
gation rose to a man.”

It Must Not Happen Again!

Virgil Chandler, Garland Alderman, and Parker Sage, under
indictment and awaiting trial, will undoubtedly get the punish-
ment they deserve. Yet as it now stands, the Ku Klux Klan, the
National Workers League, and the rest of the Fifth Column lead-
ers and ‘organizations that plague Detroit are free to continue
their work of disruption and sabotage.

The people of Detroit owe it to themselves and to their na-
tion to demand a thorough house-cleaning.

[35]

 

 

The Time For Action Is
N O W I

We have seen the Fifth Column in action. We know it is
dangerous. We know that some who now read these words may
die because traitors continue to hinder the mobilization of our
full strength at a critical hour.

Because our liberties and our lives are at stake, we must act
decisively. As a military necessity, our Government must move
sternly and_swiftly to put Fifth Columnists in prison where they
can do no harm.

In Washington a Federal Grand jury has done important
work in exposing those who co-operate with the enemy in the
shadow of our nation’s Capitol. Attorney-General Biddle has al-
ready ordered similar investigations in six major cities through-
out the nation. It is time that a grand jury in Detroit be ordered
to begin a full-dress probe of Father Coughlin, Gerald L. K.
Smith, the National Workers League, the Ku Klux Klan and all
their kind. Let the light of day be thrown up-on their sinister
activities; let their secret financial backers be revealed; let all
who share the guilt for their treason be punished!

At this moment of history, when world freedom or world
slavery is in the balance, it is a solemn duty of every citizen and
every organization to speak out and to assure their Government
of the full backing ‘of public opinion in all steps toward the sup-
pression of these internal enemies. Let us not hesitate until it is
too late.

Let us notify President Roosevelt and Attoney-General
Biddle by letters, by wires, and by resolutions by the thousands,
that the people of Detroit are united in the demand that the time
for an offensive against the Fifth Column is now!

 

 

I must not touch a hair of the wily agitator who induces him
to desert? I think that, in such a case, to silence the agitator
and save the boy is not only constitutional, but withal a great
mercy.”

Now, as then, timidity and hesitation may be fatal. If we al-
low fear of our ability to distinguish between legitimate exercise
of freedom of speech and Nazi-inspired sedition to paralyze us,
then we run the risk of total annihilation of our liberties at the
hands of a conquering enemy. '

The bitter anguish of the enslaved peoples of Europe has
taught us the meaning of a Nazi victory; freedom obliterated-
unions smashed and labor leaders shot or tortured in concentra-
tion camps—political parties suppressed—books burned—schools
shut down—pastors driven from their pulpits—racial, national
and religious minorities brutally persecuted. In nation after na-
tion, law and justice has been replaced by violence and terror.

To retain our Bill of Righ'ts—yes, to retain the precious free-
dom to extend democracy in fuller measure to all with.in our
midst and to all nations—we must win this war.

In this critical Summer and Autumn of 1942, the United Na-
tions make ready, not only to defend themselves from assault,
but to guarantee victory by carrying the attack to the enemy. By
weakening the vital home front, Detroit’s Fifth Column endan-
gers that offensive.

The banning of Social Justice; the indictment of Parker
Sage, Garland Alderman," Virgil Chandler and William R. Ly-
man; the death sentence to Max Stephan are Commando
raids against the enemy positions in Detroit. These actions merit
the fullest support of public opinion.

But Commando raids are not enough. It is time to seize the
initiative, and launch a full-scale attack to destroy Detroit’s Fifth
Column-now!

II A The Treason
of Father Coughlin

N THE AUTUMN of 1936, few Americans were aware

O that Father Cough1in’s oratorical support of the lofty

concepts of Americanism, Christianity, and social justice

was but a cloak for a plot to establish a fascist dictatorship in
America. '

At that time Coughlin led a great national political organiza-
tion; his radio audience numbered millions of depression-weary
Americans; he was sponsoring a “third party” candidate for the
Presidency of the United States. His power and prestige were at
their peak.

A few weeks before Election Day, 1936, when he was confi-
dently predicting that the Presidential candidate of his Union
Party, Rep. William Lemke, would poll ten million votes, Father
Coughlin was privately interviewed by Dale Kramer, a well-
known farm magazine writer. There Father Coughlin confessed
his lack of faith in democracy, and indicated his political orienta-
tion for the future. He said:

“One thin is sure, democrac is doomed. It is Fascism

_ Y
or Communism. We are at the crossroads. I take the road to
Fascism.”

The 1936 elections demonstrated that democracy had far
more virility than Coughlin had supposed; his candidate gar-
nered only a few hundred thousand votes. His National Union
for Social Justice faded out of the picture, and Coughlin retired
temporarily from the air. .

But not for long! Within a year Coughlin reappeared on‘ the
national scene with a new demagogic appeal, based upon the tech-
nique which Hitler had found successful. Anti-Semitism, the or-
ganization of “Christian Front” storm troop bands, and open sup-
port for international fascism replaced the issues of domestic
“reform” upon which he had for the most part previously cam-
paigned.

The April 3, 1939, issue of Social fustice displayed promi-
nently on its back cover an idealized portrait of Adolf Hitler.
The accompanying text said:

“ . . . it should never be forgotten that the Rome-Berlin
axis is the great political rampart against the spread of Com-
munism. As such, the Rome-Berlin axis is serving Christen-
dom in a peculiarly important manner.”

Shortly afterward, Coughlin followed this openibit of pro-

[3]

 

  

Hitler propaganda with a radio address entitled, “The Popular

Front vs. The Christian Front,” in which he informed the world
of his choice of weapons in the struggle to come:

“Rest assured we will fight you in Franco’s way, if neces-

sary. Call this inflammatory if you will. It is inflammatory.

“ . . . I understand that units of the Christian Front are

forming and have formed in New York City and elsewhere.

Does that mean anything to you Bolsheviks?”

This threat to fight “Franco’s way” was not an idle threat.
Concentrating their strength in New York City, Christian Front
bands began a campaign of open terrorism directed primarily
against the Jewish people. They stole guns from the National
Guard armories (with the help of Guard officers who were mem-
bers of the Front). They drilled in their use, they manufactured
bombs, they drew up elaborate plans for bombings and assassina-
tions. Members of Congress were among their intended victims.

The arrest in January, 1940, of 18 Christian Fronters in New
York, and their subsequent trial, threw the spotlight of national
publicity on their activities and forced them into relative obscur-
ity, from which they later emerged to conduct street meetings,
assault Jews in the streets and the subway stations, and to dis-
tribute the magazine Social justice.

Coughlin Helps A Labor ‘Quisling’

In Detroit, the activities of Father Coughlin’s followers had
taken a somewhat different turn, and this is significant when we
remember the critical importance of our present-day Battle for
Production: the Detroit equivalent of New York’s “Christian
Front” battles took place, not on the streets, but in the factories
and union halls.

Some of the most important chapters of the post-depression
struggle of the workers in America’s mass production industries
to organize unions of their own choosing were taking place in
Detroit. Father Coughlin, whose “16 Principles of Social Jus-
tice” included a “just annual living wage” and “labor’s right to
organize,” did not stand aloof from the fray.

Many leading Catholic churchmen were then supporting the
effort of the CIO to organize the automobile workers. Father
Coughlin was a conspicuous exception. Coincident with the pub-
lication of full-page advertisements by automobile companies, the
employer—inspired Citizens’ ‘Committees and Councils of Indus-
trial Peace, Coughlin assailed both the workers’ right to strike
and the CIO. He joined in the chorus of anti-labor voices crying
“Communism” at every effort of the workers to obtain a just an-
nual living wage which he professed to support. In Social fustice
Coughlin said: '

“Strikes are neither Christian or American.”
“American labor cannot afford to join or support the
Communist—dominated politically manipulated CI O.”
What sort of “unionism” Coughlin favored may be judged
by the formation in 1937 of the “Workers’ Council for Social
Justice, Incorporated,” a Ford company union.

In 1937 the President of the United Automobile Workers,
CIO, was Homer Martin, whose name later came to represent to
labor what the name “Quisling” means to anti-fascists. In August,
1937, Martin invited R. J. Thomas (now President of the UAW-
CIO) to drive with him to Father Coughlin’s Shrine of the Little
Flower in Royal Oak. At the Shrine Coughlin made an amazing
offer. He promised to arrange an interview with Henry Ford to
arrange for the organization of the workers of the Ford Motor
Company. Coughlin offered his services as intermediary on con-
dition that the UAW withdraw from the “Communist” CIO.

Thomas would have no part of the deal; but Martin continued
to meet with Coughlin. It was a year later that Homer Martin
suspended five officers and executive board members of the
UAW, as part of a Red-baiting campaign that had already di-
vided the union into warring factions and which was before long
to end in the creation of a rival Martin-led organization.

Subsequently, Martin’s followers in the various locals turned

[5]

 

  

to gangsterism and violence against the legitimate union. Raids
on meeting halls by armed thugs became common. In the fore-
front of the Martin goon squads, together with known Klansmen,
Black Legion elements, and imported gunmen, were the followers
of Father Coughlin.

When Petain and Laval betrayed France, it was because their
hatred of the French workers exceeded their love of their coun-
try. It seems clear from the histories of Father Coughlin and
other Fifth Columnists whose careers we shall presently review,
that anti-labor propaganda is as much a part of the arsenal of
Fifth Column weapons against democracy as anti-Semitism or
any other divisive tactic; and that efforts to split the unions
from within and prevent them from making their important con-
tribution to the victory effort are also on their program.

Apostle of Defeat

Up until the very day it was banned Father Coughlin’s Social
fustice continued to serve the Axis. It not on-ly reflected enemy
propaganda, but served as a weekly instruction sheet to all Fifth
Columnists, pointing out how best to hamper the war effort.

“ . . . get into every patriotic organization in America,” Social
]ustice counselled its readers on January 12, 1942. “join up with
Civilian Defense . . . overwhelm them with your numbers and
capture every office.”

Similarly, Social justice instructed its readers in the tech-
nique of utilizing the national need for sacrifice as propaganda
for disunity and defeatism. If there is a shortage of rubber, blame
it on the Administration and the “British Rubber Racket” (Social
fustice, April 13.) If, to preserve our nation’s independence, our
soldiers must risk their lives on foreign fields of battle, tell that
“Hundreds of thousands of American and English boys, possibly
will sacrifice their lives to save Malaya—and incidentally to pre-
serve the investments . . . to swell the purses of the international
bankers.”

Consider this quotation, printed in Social ]ustice or March
23, 1942, at a moment when Hitler was preparing to 'aunch a
“peace offensive” on the diplomatic front while his generxlls made
ready for stepped-up Spring warfare:

“How long will this war be pursued in America? Will
Americans graciously bow down ‘to all the totalitarian de-
crees which will restrict their sugar, their motor cars, their
oil, their apparel, their way of life and their pocketbooks
simply to satisfy the ambitions of those who translate victory
by the complete overthrow of their enemies? Or will the
American people want to listen to reason and terminate a

[5]

 

 

war which now no one can win completely, and which Ameri-

cans can lose completely?”

Tokio stresses the idea of a “race war.” Japan pretends to be
the leader of the “darker races” in a war against “white domina-
tion.” At the very moment when American and Filipino troops
were fighting together in their heroic effort to save the Philip-
pine Islands from Japanese conquest, and at the moment when
Japan launched its “race” appeal to the Filipinos to desert their
American allies, Social fustice appeared on the streets with this
headline emblazoned across its cover:

“YELLOW-WHITE WAR MAY BE NEXT”

The article said: “Today 300 million 0rientals—believe it or
not—are beginning to chant Britain-’s requiem in the words, ‘Asia
for the Asiatics.’”

It must not be assumed, however, that the Catholic church has
endorsed Coughlin’s Axis program. For years Father Coughlin
has made use of his church aﬁiliations as a shield for his anti-
American crusade. Recently, the Most Rev. Edward Mooney,
Archbishop of Detroit, made it plain that Social Justice was not
a Catholic publication, and that in fact Coughlin had falsely
assured his church superiors that he had severed his connection
with it. Archbishop Mooney’s statement, together with the de-
nunciations of Coughlin by an ever-increasing number of leading
Catholic churchmen, served to expose Father Coughlin as a
traitor, not only to his country, but to his faith as well.

Fifth Columnists like Coughlin, in a desperate effort to save
themselves, are appealing to the American people in the name of
“freedom of speech” and “freedom of criticism.” Honest and con-
structive criticism, offered in the interests of victory, must not
only be permitted, but encouraged. It will strengthen our war ef-
fort. However, there is a clear line of distinction between free-
dom of criticism and tolerance of service to our enemies.

In the case of Coughlin, Attorney-General Francis Biddle re-
vealed that “A study of the 10 major themes which have been
broadcast by our enemies since December 1, 1941, as reported by
the Foreign Broadcast Monitoring Service of the Federal Com-
munications Commission, shows a close relation of material con-
tained in Social justice to those themes during approximately the
same period.”

The Attorney-General then pointed out that “What in a
single instance might be excused as a careless overstatement may
by constant repetition become evidence of deliberate and inten-
tional distortion of the truth.”

Fath.er Coughlin stands accused of deliberate and intentional
lying, along the identical themes of Nazi propaganda, in a “sus-

[7]
