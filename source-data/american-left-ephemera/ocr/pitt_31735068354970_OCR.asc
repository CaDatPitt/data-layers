DENVER——Political action with an eye ran the last
of this year’s primaries as well as registration drives for
the November general election occupied the attention of
many Mine-Mill locals in the western states going into

September.

Most concentrated activity was underway in Ari-
zona where preparation for getting out the vote in the
state’s primary on Sept. 11 was being coordinated by
the 9-local Arizona Mine-Mill Council which had already
announced endorsement of national and state candidates.
Considerable local activity on a county basis is also being

carried out.

Chief interest of Arizona members is centered on

the races of two of their
own Mine-\/Iill brothers for
[gate office—Clyde Dalton for
nine Inspector and David
Duarte for the House seat be-
ing vacated by Dalton.‘ Both
Dalton and Duarte are leaders
of Bisbee Local 551.‘ (See sep-
arate Arizona stories this page

IN NEW MEXICO, Local 890’s
PAC group at Bayard is con-
ducting a series of meetings in
preparation for the November
general elections in Which, PAC
Chairman Joe Ramirez reports.
the local will be deeply involved
in support of various county and
state candidates.

The local’s slate -will be an-

nounced after Labor Day fol-
lowing decisions on candidates
by its PAC and membership.
While it is understood Local 890
will generally support most
Democratic candidates because
of their programs and past sup-
port of labor, there is specula-
tion that this may not be the
case in a few instances.

For example, the local has
yet to decide whom it will sup-
port for Governor and in one
or two county races. The local’s
position has been decisive in
the outcome of many elections
in the past.

WASHINGTON, D. C.—Look-
ing at the meager side of posi-
tive action by Congress anxious
to wind up a sad r-cord and get
on with the business of political
campaigning for the November
elections, fou r administration
measures got approval of the
lawmakers last month.

The House Aug. 26 completed
congressional action on a pro-
posed constitutional amendment
to outlaw the requirement of
paying poll taxes in order to
vote in federal elections. Such
poll tax regulations still exist in
five states—Alabama, Arkansas,

iyslvlississippi, Virginia and Texas.

V‘ Already passed by the Senate
last March, the measure must
now be ratified by the legisla-
tures of three-fourths (38) of the
states before it becomes effec-
tive as an amendment to the
U. S. constitution. The state
legislatures have seven years to
ratify this newest amendment.
It goes on the books as soon as
the 38th state votes it in.

PUBLIC reaction to the cause
and effect relationship of drugs
to deformed babies, eye cata-
racts and deaths possibly in-
volving a birth-control pill
forced revival of a major drug
bill proposed by Senator Kefau-
ver and the Administration but
which had appeared drowned
through a watering down of its
strongest safeguards.

The Senate Aug. 23 unani-
mously passed, 78 to 0, the bill
requiring drug manufacturers to
prove that new drugs are not
only safe, but effective. It pro-
vides stiff government controls

and 24 state candidates in the
Arizona primary election this
month were endorsed by the
Arizona Mine-Mill Council fol-
lowing its unique “screening”
session held at the Flamingo
Hotel here August 4.

Most of the candidates, some
30 out of about 45 running, re-
sponded to a special invitation
from the Council by either ap-
pearing in person or sending
their campaign spokesmen to
express their views before the
delegates from nine ,Mine-Mill
local unions and four ladies

auxiliaries representing influ-
ential voting forces in five
counties.

All the office seekers for re-
election or election in both the
Democratic and R epublic an
parties were sent notices of the
meeting advising they would be
introduced and afforded brief
remarks prior to the Mine-Mill
group’s decision on recommen-
dations for support by the mem-
bership, the largest of any single
union in the state.

TWO large conference rooms
were used at the hotel—-one for
conducting the Council’s busi-
ness, and the other as a wait-
ing room for the candidates who
were escorted singly into the
meeting for their introduction
and brief remarks to the dele-
gates.

lowed recommendations made
by a Council political action sub-

committee which met separate-
ly after all candidates present
had been heard. Serving on the
sub-committee were:
chairman David Duarte; Carl
Krass of Morenci Local 616,

Savannah Local

6 Displays Muscle

Somehow several foremen at
the Reynolds & Manley mill in
Savannah, Ga., .got it in their
heads to go -around telling the
workers under them that they
didn’t have a union any more.

Members of Mine-Mill Local
870, whichirepresents the work-
ers at the mill, decided early
last month that they would
demonstrate just how wrong the

foremen were by conducting a .

one-hour shutdown. The shut-
down drew the attention of the

top management which sug-
gested that the union hold a gen-
eral’ good and welfare meeting
with the company. .

The suggestion was immedi-
ately carried out. The foremen
now are aware there is a "union
at the mill. ‘

THE MINE-MILL UNION

September} 

President's Corner:

Labor Day Reminder
—Get Out the Vote!

ONDAY, September 3, marks the 81st time that
Labor Day will have been celebrated in America.
The man credited with starting the annual observance
was an Irish-American cabinet maker named Peter J.
McGuire, one of the leaders in the old Knights of Labor.
 It was on May 8, 1882, at a meeting of the
Central Labor Union in New York that Mc-
Guire proposed a day of celebration to honor
“those who from rude nature have delved and
carved all the grandeur we behold.” He point-
ed out that, although there were many holi-
days designating all sorts of patriotic and
military events, there was none “representa-
tive of the industrial spirit, the greatest vital
force of the nation.”

And so, the first Labor Day was celebrated
Sept. 5, 1882. A similar celebration was held
the next year, and by 1884 the first Monday
in September had been agreed on as the un-
changing date for the Labor Day holiday. The day is now observed
in every one of our states and in Canada.

Labor had come a long way to establish itself as a national
institution when Peter McGuire first proposed a standard holiday
to honor it. For it was 76 years earlier, in 1806, that eight Phila-
delphia shoemakers were convicted in court on charges of “crimi-
nal conspiracy” to join together in “a combination of workmen to
raise their wages.”

at ‘A’ ‘A’

T’s HARDLY likely that, in 1882, Peter McGuire had any real
thought of linking the observance of Labor Day with the idea
of advancing -the interests of the organized working man through
political action. _' L I , A
But today there can be no separation of labor’s struggle to
protect and advance its interests at the bargaining table from the
equal struggle to protect and advance its interests in the halls of.
Congress—and the limits of these interests range‘ from peace to
the shorter workweek. Does it need repeating that what we gain
in bargaining is constantly jeopardized by legislation or lack of it?
This is what we should be thinking about in the celebrations of
Labor Day, 1962. Because two months from now labor’s day--
should be observed at every polling. place in the general election

lators and mine“ inspectors, county sheriffs and city councilmen.

HAT should be our dedication this labor day—to seethat every
eligible voter is registered, and to be sure that every regis-
tered vote is cast. , .
On November 6, Mine-Mill members in 28 states will be di-
rectly involved in the-election of some 20 governors, 21 U. S. Sen-
ators, 75 U. S. representatives and hundreds of state legislators
as well as county and city officials. A
It’s obvious from the record of the present Congress as com-

pared with what needs to be done in the way of social and labor
legislation, that more liberals must be elected.

‘A’ ‘k ‘A’ .
LL KINDS of statistics have been published analyzing the
closeness of many vote results in the 1960 elections, including
the narrow squeak for President Kennedy himself in a contest
which was the closest since the Presidential election of 1888.

A shift of less than one percent of the vote would have changed
the outcome not only of the race between Kennedy and Nixon, but
of 25 Senate, House and Governorship races as well. Add to that
the fact that, in 89 other contests, the winners received less than
55 percent of the vote—and we see why every single vote counts.

Three Senators, one of them Lee Metcalf of Montana, won their

elections by less than one percent’ of the vote. Ten other Senators
received less than 55 percent of the Vote.

‘kit’

N U. S. Representative races, 16 Congressmen.won by less
than one percent of the vote, and 69 others received less than
55 percent of the vote.

Six Governors, including Welsh of Indiana, Mechem of New
Mexico and Rossellini of Washington, won their elections by less
than one percent of the vote. Ten others got less than 55 percent.

_A number of races for U. S. Representative were so close that
their final outcomes were decided only after recounts had been

made.
at ‘k at

WITH all these figures, however, there are two other facts
that stand out in a close look at the results of the last
election. 1

One is the fact that some 45 labor-endorsed candidates for
Congress lost their races by a two or three percent margin.

The second is that in these congressional districts it was noted
that literally hundreds of thousands of union members were not
registered to vote, certainly enough to have made the difference

***

HE RECORD of the 87th Congress has been a sad one, sad

especially for the people. Good bills have been defeated,
bottled up in committee, compromised ‘away.

Most liberal legislation has gotten nowhere, thanks to the con-

WF0] 0f Congress by the ‘VGOP-Dixiecrat coalition. That. is- bad
.en_oiig_h, but prospects next year would indeed be worse ifithe
coalition is strengthened, even more by Republican gains in the
_.Senate. and a possible GOP majority in the House. ’ ' I ‘ 1
 _ All of this points up the importance of the November elections.-t .
. It emphasizes the urgent need for every member to be registered
~. and to vote. See that your family,
_ bors register and vote. This is our most important _job up ;to

House, where the Commerce
Committee has completed hear-
ings on a similar measure.

A THIRD measure, approved
by the Senate Aug. 25, is a
modified farm. bill to extend
present voluntary feed grain
controls and limit wheat pro-
duction under a two-price sup-
port program. .

A stronger farm bill was de-
feated earlier by the House.

The modified version was
headed for a Senate-House con-
ference committee.

On Aug. 28, the House passed
a $900 million public works bill
which the Administration said
would provide jobs in depressed
areas.

ASIDE from these positive
actions, the welfare of the ordi-
nary people continued to get the
short end of the stick from Con-
gress in contrast to Capitol Hill-’s
solicitude for the interests of big
business. Perhaps most strik-
ingly demonstrating this imbal-
ance were two actions, one in
each congressional chamber, on
the same day, Aug. 27.

The House Ways and Means
Committee by one vote, 13 to 12,

rejected President Kennedy’s

request for an extension_ of un-
employment compensation for
workers whose benefits have
expired because of long idleness
and ‘inability to find a job. The
measure was strongly backed
by labor. ' I '
On the other hand, the‘ Senate
approved 52-30 that part of the
Administration’s ta x r efo r m

-. «proposal to grant business and
industry a 7 percent investment

tax credit.  -.

This would provide a windfall
of more than $1 billion tax
credit as an incentive for cor-

porations to invest in moderni-Hg

OLRB hearings have already been held on the union’s challenge of the INCO

irregularities including an
entire unidentified -ballot

ballots than voters. Further chal-

I lenge was made with documen-

tation of the fact that Steel had
flagrantly -’ violated OLRB elec-
tion rules during the three day
“silent” period prior to the vote
itself." S

Last month Mine-Mill Cana-

pro tested on the basis of glaring v-ote procedure

ing inﬂuence the outcome of the

_ INCO vote.

* >i< 3!:

MINE-MILL challenged the
Falconbridge application on the
grounds that Steelhad submit-
ted many forged membership
cards. *

In its new request that the

OLRB reopen hearings on the:

Steel application for certifica-
tion at INCO‘, Mine-Mill pointed
out that the forgeries at Fal-
conbridge involved three top
Steel organizers—Robertson, Da-

vigi and Beaudry—who had also .
been involvedin the ‘submission-

of' hundreds of cards in the
Steel application at INCO. O

Mine-Mill maintains that be-
cause Steel submitted fraudu-
lent evidence in an attempt 01:0
obtain a "vote at Falconbridge,
in a campaign that was pro-
ceeding at the same time as the
one at INCO, the Steel cards in
the INCO case must of necessi-
ty fall under a cloud of sus-
picion.

THE hearings held earlier in
the INCO case on Mine-Mill
charges of fraudulent practices
took place prior to the Falcon-
bridge forgery disclosures and
dismissal of Steel’s application
there. Thus the evidence of
forgery brought out by the un-
ion’s handwriting expert and the
cross-examination of Steel or-
ganizers Robertson and Davigi
had not been available at the

time of the earlier INCO hear-
ings. _

The union contends there is no
doubt that, if the Ontario Labor
Relations Board officials would
have had that evidence in front
of themwhen they were dealing

with the INCO case, it-would ‘

have had considerable bearing
on the_INCO decision. '
Mine-Mill is now; demanding

that the OLRB+ho1d-re-hearings -
on Steel’s application at’ INCO.

where Robertson, Davigi and
Beaudry can be examined un-
der oath on their testimony in
the Falconbridge case regard-
ing methods ‘used in their card-
signing campaign both at INCO
and Falconbridge. The union is
also requesting that a complete
examination be made ‘of all
cards; witnessed by these three
Steel organizers.

in New York. Four other states hold primaries on the same day,

September 11, in Arizona,

Colorado, Utah and Washington.

Georgia’s primary is September 12.

EL PASO, Texas—A new and
very worthwhile project is be-
ing sponsored by AS&R Local
509 here, worked out by Presi-
dent Alfredo F. Ayala and El
Paso Business Agent Lorenzo
Franceware with the coopera-
tion of a local group of volun-
teer teachers. ,

The project is a series of
English classes for members
who are beginners in the lan-
guage or for those who want to
further improve their present
knowledge of English.

Main object of the classes is
to give interested members a

workable speaking and writing.
knowledge of the English Ian- A

guage, particularly for its use
on the job.
5% fr

CLASSES are conducted
every night during the week
from 7:00 to 8:30 PM. About 40

pupils have enrolled and many I

more have indicated interest in
enrolling as soon as morning
classes’, can be arranged for
roernbers working the’ night and
evening shifts. .

Interest in the undertaking

was sparked by the Apprentice-
ship program which Local 509
is now negotiating with AS&R
management at the El Paso
smelter. ‘

:The Shorter  Work-Week V    
  Essential Need in an Automated Economy

6 , HE AFL-CIO Executive Council, meeting in Chicago

last month, as its first order of business adopted

a resolution calling on its membership to Work for a

shorter work-week, with no cut in pay, through federal

legislation and at the bargaining table. The resolution

[called for cutting the standard work-week to 35 hours.

" This action followed a resolution adopted for the first

time by the AFL-CIO annual convention last December
calling for a shorter work-week.

' A The resolution last December said when a choice

must be made between cut-
ting jobs or- cutting hours,
f"reduction of hours without loss
of pay must be an ingredient of
our attack on unemployment.
We cannot close our eyes to the
evidence of the new technology’s
‘impact, the coming- expanded
flow of youngsters into the labor
,_ market and the inability of
existing economic policies to
.achieve full employment.”

POSITION CHANGED

Last December’s resolution,
however, left it up to the indi-
vidual unions to act in seeking
the shorter work-week.

‘ What was different last month
was that the AFL-CIO itself got
squarely behind the campaign

— by setting up a special commit-
tee to carry on the fight.

AFL-CIO President George

Meany will head up the commit-‘

tee, to consist of himself and
four AFL-CIO Vice-Presidents.»
Its first assignment will be to
draft amendments to the Wage-
Hour law. The amendments will
require the payment of double
time for all hours beyond 35 in

/T‘ -a week, to discourage the sched-
uling of overtime. Meany, in
commenting on last month’s
resolution, said labor was tired
of waiting for the Kennedy _ad-
ministration to do something
about unemployment.

Inaction in Washington, and
growing rank and file pressures
from the AFL-CIO membership
to do something about unem-
ployment and ease the job loss
due to technological develop-
ments and automation were be-

‘ hind the AFL-CIO council action.

Thus the AFL-CIO has swung
all the way around to the posi-
tion which Mine-Mill has held
consistently for years in favor

of a -shorter work-week with no ~

loss in pay.
National convention after na-
tional convention has put Mine-
Mill squarely ’ behind this pro-
gram, and Mine—Mill officers
‘have taken every opportunity in
recent years to urge such legis-
lation in conferences with Sena-
tors and Congressmen and at
"xfappearances before Congres-
sional committees.

HE PROBLEM that faces

labor and the country was
put in a nutshell two weeks ago
by James Reston, nationally
syndicated writer for the New
York Times, who wrote:

“How do you absorb three mil-
lion new Americans every,
year while labor-saving auto-
matic machinery is knocking
off 1% million jobs every 12

. .-M-~ months, and whole new com- .

peting mass production in-
dustries are rising in Europe
and Japan?‘ This is the cen-
tral question before the na-
tion.”
The problem Reston so aptly
‘ summarizes hasn’t suddenly
burst upon us. Unemployment
has been moving upward irregu-
larly since the end of the Korean
war. Each of the depressions
we have had since then has had
more unemployment than the
one before, and at the top of
every “recovery” from these

.  cove_ry;.:t..j§'  _  _ 
'1npldymen‘t?

nited-—

 

.{1eP1‘¢SSions, We; have had more ,
J.0h1e_ss thangin. the. previous re-f

States in 1961 averaged 4,800,000
over the. year, according to the
U. S. Department of Labor. This
was the highest number of un-
employed in‘- any year since
1941, when the jobless averaged
5,560,000. Although 1961 was
hailed by government spokes-
men as a year of rising pros-
perity, it was marked by more
unemployment than the depres-

_ sion year of 1958.

Industrial production in 1961
was "more thani17 percent above
that in 1958, but this was not
enough to keep unemployment
from edging upward.

A This year, 1962, unemployment
is‘ even higher, although official
statistics put out by the federal
government cover up- this fact.

Here’s how the government
hides the real magnitude of" the
unemployment -problem. The
government puts. out an esti-
mate every month, based- on

surveys, of the total labor force. -

The “labor fo~rce"l’7in'cludes~ all
persons in the armed forces, all
persons working full or part
time, and all persons looking for
jobs. Those looking for jobs are
the officially unemployed.

__ UN COUNTED J OBLESS

Our population aged 14 years
and over is increasing by more
than two million per year, but
the number of persons the gov-
ernment reported as in the labor
force increased from July, 1961,
to July, 1962, by a mere 275,000.

This means that well over a
million people who want work
would either be. working or seek-
ing a job if jobs were to be had.
But they have quit looking for
non-existent jobs and therefore
aren’t. counted as unemployed. ‘

To be counted as unemployed
you have to be. answering the
help wanted ads and hanging
around the employment offices,

whether or not there’s any work
to be had. ‘

KEYSERLING REPORT

Writing in the New York
Times Magazine last month,
Leon H. Keyserling, Chairman
of the Council of Economic Ad-
visers under President Truman,
said that allowing for this sta-
tistical exclusion of jobless peo-
ple no longer looking for Work,
and allowing for the hours not
worked by those employed less
than ' full time, unemployment
currently is about 501 percent

’ greater than the figure reported

  

  
     
     

We-kins?~vnd¥rsr9unds=

THE MINE-MILL UNION

by the government, or about 8.
percent as against the 5.3 per-
cent claimed by the government
for last July.

Keyserling said: “Counting de-
pendents, the material privation
and morale-shattering experi-
ence of havingthe breadwinner
idle now hit directly 10 million
or more Americans.”

EHIND these stark figures
is the story‘ of automation,

stepped-up efficiency, more and
more labor-saving machinery,

and simple, old-fashioned speed- 0

up which has increased the
average worker's production per
hour and led to layoffs in every
segment of ‘American industry.
Something new in the last cou-
ple of years has. been the impact
of automation on white-collar
office workers, who also have
been hit by lay-offs in banks,
insurance companies and many
other businesses employing
large numbers of clerical work-
ers.

This is why our rising indus-
trial production has failed to
provide the jobs needed by our
rapidly growing population.

Headline hitting developments,
such as the installation of a fully
automatic subway train in New
York, requiring no crew, have
been matched by hundreds of
less spectacular developments
that have taken their toll in jobs.

developments as the use of

skip hoists in a growing number
of open pits, ever higher capac-
ity trucks, new type furnaces in
copper refineries, conveyor belt
ore handling and other develop-

ments have caused the loss of

hundreds of jobs-over the past

_ year.

All the non-ferrous metal in-
dustries have been hit by loss
of jobs, just. like almost every
other segment of American in-
dustry. In copper mining and
milling, for example, take a look
at What has been happening in
the short span ofsix years.

Accordingto the U. S. Depart-
ment of Labor, in May of 1956,
28,800 workers. were employed
in U. S. copper mining and mill-
ing. They averaged 44.4 hours

per week and produced 23,202.

tons of recoverable copper per
week. Six years later, in‘ May
of 1962, 23,800 workers (5,000
less than in 1956) working 43
hours per week, produced 26,411
tonsof recoverable copper per

week. Pounds of . copper pro-

duced per man-hour of work in-
creased from 36.3 pounds to 51.6
pounds. This was an increase in
output per hour, or of “produc-
tivity,”'- as it is called, of 42
percent.

And even this doesn't tell the
whole story—the average copper
content of ores mined in 1962

was about 61/2 percent less than ‘A

of ‘ores. ‘mined in 1956,, which
means, that more rock had to be
handled "per ‘ton? of r'ec,ov'erab,le.

Chilean Coppers Miners Pay .

  
 

U. S. State, and Labor Departments recently issued a -report,
“Labor in Chile,” which explains how Chilean copper miners are
paid. Over 90 percent of Chilean copper is produced by Chilean
subsidiaries of U. S. copper producers, mainly Anaconda and
Kennecott. The report cites figures compiled by the Chilean Statis-

tics and Census Bureau giving
average Chilean copper miners’
total pay received in the month
of November, 1958.

This consisted of the following

items, which -have been ’con-

verted to approximate U. S. dol-
lar equivalents below:

Monthly
- Item Total Pay
Base Pay  32
‘Sunday pay  . 7
Overtime pay ......... --.-__j, ....... ._ 5
Family allowance __._-_._.;____ 14
Premiums, bonuses _________-_ 1.7
Commissary -subsidy ._._-.__;- 23
Special allowances _-._.--.__ 15 .
Other benefits _ _______ .-_. ...... ___ 1

Total Pay & Fringes--U.S. $114

Overtime pay, time and one-
half, is paid for work in excess
of 8 hours’ per day or 48 hours
per week; Time worke_d on Sun-
days is paid for at regular rates.
Miners receive base pay for
Sundays not worked as well as
for 15 statutory holidays.

Workers must turn over a
portion of the family allowance
above to the government Social
Insurance Service to pay for
medical care, ‘disability and un-
employment benefits.

Bonuses are paid for night
shift work, for underground
work, for seniority and other

purposes. The commiss‘ary_.sub- .

sidy covers the value of food
and household goods provided
free, or the claimed “cost” to
the companies of selling through

‘ company stores at ““_subsidized”

prices. Special allowances cover
housing, transportation and utili-
ties, and other items.

All in “all, the average Chilean
copper. miner had considerably
less than the equivalent of U. S.
$90 cash pay to handle each
month. Wages -and prices in

Chile have both increased since
these figure s were compiled,
leaving the real income of the
miners approximatelythe same
as in 1958.

Rhodesia

Marathon talks stretching out
over a period of over six
months, and interrupted by
strikes last May and again in
July, finally resulted-in a new
18-month c o ntr a ct settlement
last month between the North-
ern Rhodesia African Mine

Workers Union and the Copper- 1

belt mining companies.

The copper miners gained ‘a
pay increase equivalent to USS‘.
21 cents per shift, a hike of
about 9 cents in the shift differ-
ential, and increased paid holi-
days. -

South America

U. S. owned 160,000 "ton per year
copper mine and smelter, struck
August 10. American Smelting
and Refining Company has a
majority stock interest in South-
ern Peru. Minority interests in-
clude Phelps Dodge, Cerro Cor-

poration and.Newmont. Strikers’ --

demands included higher wages
and reinstatement of two dis-
charged workers.

A wildcat strike hit the smel-
ter at Kennecott’s Chilean sub-
rsidiary, Braden Copper Co. -on
August 14, causing a loss -of 500
tons of fire refined copper per
day._ According to the American
Metal Market of -Aug. 27., “the
work stoppage ended when the

strikers accepted (Aug. V 23.) an
.-offer by the company to main-
, tain a certain number of workers

at the plant.” _ ‘

COPPER production cutbacks, announced by several Ur S. and
foreign producers last July were apparently made with foreknowl-
edge of slackened demand and prospects for a big increase in
producers’ stocks of copper on hand. Late in August Copper Insti-
tute announced that U. S. producers’ stocks of copper had increased
dur1ng,July by nearly 45 percent, from 69,838 tons at the beginning,
to 100,517 tons at the end of the month.

The buildup occurred despite substantial reduction of mine and
refinery production of copper in July, as compared with May and
June. Prospects are for a further increase in stocks in August,
as ‘brass and wire ‘mills report slack demand from customers.
This has been reflected in unusually slow orders booked by copper
producers in August. - - .

. Foreign producer stocks of copper-also increased substantially
in July. Industry sources look for a ‘real test of thenstability of the
31 cent price per pound for copper in the early fall months.
