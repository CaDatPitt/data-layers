Butte conference a   g 
r to improve contract mining systems   

BUTTE, Mont.—A campaign to
“give the unionia voice” in con-
tract mining bonus systems was
launched here last week at a two-
day ‘Mine-Mill conference. ' A

The parley, attended by dele-

gates from six key «mining locals -
in the west, northwest and south-_

west, was the first of its kind
ever held by our Union.. It had
been called by the International
officers at~'~t_he suggestion of the
Mining, Smelting and Refining
Conference in March.

Int’l president John ‘Clark was
conference chairman, while presi-
dent Joe Mason of Butte Miners’
Union was secretary. Int’l sec-
retary-treasurer Maurice E. Tra-
vis keynoted the sessions with a
review of the history of contract
mining in our industry and sug-

.gesti'ons for a nationwide ap-

proach to improving the bonus

; systems.

AFTER HEARING full reports
from each local, the conference set
up a committee which drafted
two statements, the most impor-
tant of ' which was a five-point
program" on contract bonus min-
ing. “ A

The conference thanked the of-

gested that more space be de-
voted in our paper, THE UNION,
-to reports and discussion of con-
tract problems, and that the In-
ternational Union_ prepare educa-
tional material on contract prob-
lems. I P

The conference delegates at-'

tended a regular meeting of the
Butte Miners’ Union, Local 1,
which enthusiastically approved
the new contract mining program
after hearing a lengthy report
from secretary-treasurer Travis.

HERE IS the program:

Our discussions at the contract
bonus conference have made
clear. to us that despite many
local differences there are also
many features " co_mmon -‘to all
contract bonus systems. Em-
ployers everywhere,.we find. are
seeking to use the contract sys-
rem as a device for lowering unit
labor costs andexacting more
profit from the labor of their
workers.

This common employefs' ob-
iective dictates the need for a
common International union-wide
approach to‘-"this problem.’}Unless
some greater uniformity of stand-
ards can" be achieved. gainsgand
contract systems won by one

areas. As a result of that ex-

DESLOGE, Mo.-—Members of Mine-
Mill Local 618 were back at work last

1 week after winning a victory over the
Valley Dolomite. Company, which had .

locked them.-"6ut for _four weeks.

The victory agreement calls for a
12 cent an hour general wage increase,
plus a \production bonus which may

‘_ mean up to three cents an hour.

During the lockout, the -workers
were denied unemployment compensa-
tion, but their ‘discipline held firm as

-‘they relied on the support of business
"firms and_workers in the area, as well .
’ n as from other local unions and: the In-

‘ ternational Union. ~

': The bonus agreement provides that
if the‘ company ships as much as 10,500
tons of processed.dol_omite_in any one

_ month, the workers will 1 get a pay in-

crease of a cent 5 ton per hour. Fur-

ther increases of a cent. a‘ ton will be
_ . paid for the increase of each additional
-. 500. tons shipped ‘by the company.

The workers credited the victory to
the coordination . of their negotiating,
strike and relief committees, and the
‘aid they got from, merchants, local

United Mine Workers at the "Missis-

in the bud through fast action "by Local
883. .

, The ra-id began just as Local 883
was opening negotiations for contract
improvements. Leaders of Local 883
promptly told the raiders that the
workers at the plant would not toler-

ate any union-busting, and that since V

the workers were out to" improve their
contract this year, they would not a)-

low District 50 to help the boss destroy -

wages and conditions. ' _

When the membership heard of the
raiders, they immediately shut down
the plant and insisted on a meeting
withthe company to clear up any mis-
understanding the cp‘mpany,might have

M about who 4 represented the_ workers.

At this meeting, the company agreed
that it was impossible for District 50

M to get on the ballot in an election.‘The

1953 DEMANDS

sxmsrv AND HEALTH 

-Answers to questions on,
medical and hospital plan

Should employer pay
for benefits to
workers‘ dependenfs?

In order to discuss the problem, it
is necessary to understand how the
xvorkeris dollar_ is spent for medical
care. Studies throughout the country
have repeatedly proven that in the av-
erage American’ family, approximate-
ly three-quarters of all the money
spent for medical, hospital and dental
care is spent on the dependents in the
family,
earner.

Wives "and (children, ’ pa‘rticularly
young * ones, require a considerable
amount of medical care to correct de-
fects and to keep them healthy.

For the average» worker, supplying
the amount and kind of medical care to
keep his family healthy..is a very con-
_si-:‘.'crable' burden. If a welfare ‘pro-
gram is to be of any. real value, it must
provide generous medical and hospital
benefits for the » dependents. These
benefits are costly.‘ ‘

If workers .are asked to purchase
dependent coverage voluntarily under
a group insurance program, it is -fre-.
quently the very .o'ne_s who need it

-_mos"t—-those with the_largest_ families
——who can least afford it. This usually a

results in having’a program ‘in‘ which
only a relatively small percentage of
the dependents are covered. This ‘is

not only bad because it defeats‘ the

purpose of the welfare ‘program, but
because the risks are not‘ spread over
a large enough group. The cost of the
program actually increases for each
person covered. .\ .

If the employerpays all, or'_a con-
siderable part of the cost of dependent
coverage, a -program can be estab-
lished in which every worker with a
family will have benefits for that fam-
ily~at either no costto himself, or at

. a cost which he can’ readily bear.

It must be remembered that the cost
to theemployer who is contributing to

dependent coverage is always much

less than to ‘the worker -himself.
‘The "employer is in the position to
deduct the, entire “cost as ‘an ‘expense
of .doing business, and may in addi-
tion, find certain tax advantages
which further reduce his cost.

‘ —If the worker ‘pays directly for the

cost of dependent coverage, he cannot
deduct these costs under ordinary cir-
cumstances. ,' . ‘ - . c *

The recent development of negoti-
ated welfare plans has been Yer)’
strongly in the direction of having
dependents’ coverage paid for under

the basic welfare plan. Of the major," '

union“we1fare plans in‘ the Western
United States, the majority of the
largest programs now provide bene-

fits for dependents~at little or no cost _

to the worker. -
d How about uniform
benefits for entire

company or industry? _

It is not possible to give an arbitrary. -1 ' 1' _.

answer to this question.

-Uniformity for its own sake is of _ 
no particular value. Where the vari-, 

on; geographic locations and -working

conditions are sufficiently similar in A

.a particular company, it probably

would be desirable to have a- single  _»

uniform plancovering all of the
workers. '

The advantages of«a uniform plan .v‘ 

would be greater ease of administra-

‘ tion, the ability of workers to transfer -
from one location to another, without’ "

a change} in benefits and, possibly,
savings as a result of pooling‘ a large!‘
:group of_people in a single unit. _

There _are, however, other factors to

‘consider: costs. of hospitalizatioii and; ,
medical care and the kinds of medical ‘,
care available are apt to vary in dif- ,

ferent locations. '

Thus, it would not be wise to pay‘
an insurance-company a premium for"
a $12 a day hospital benefit, in an area, '
in ‘which, the actual daily’ hospital,-' —

charge was $10.

In some localities,‘ the existence loft;

 FRANK ALLEN

‘H gomewhat.

Browns Station, near Bessemer, Ala. He now
lives less than two blocks from his birthplace, but

 during the intervening .67 years, Frank has travelled

to almost every part of the United States in the
Service of his union. 2

Henry Allen, father of Frank, worked many years
as an ore miner on Red ,Mountain. In those days
there were no white workers in the mines—just a
few white supervisors——and the foremen’s jobs went
to Negroes. Henry Allen served for several periods

- as mine foreman. *

At the age of .11, Frank Allen worked his first
shift in a mine. He was a “mule'boy” at 75 cents a
day during the summer vacation from school. His
job was to lead the mules.

' Three years later, in 1900, Frank left school and

4- began working regularly in the mines. He put in

I 12-hour day for $1.
These were the days of oil lamps. Only ventila-

- '.tion in the mines was that of “natural” drafts. The

‘accident rate was high.

_ Father killed in mine
I Henry "Allen was killed in the Woodward mine by

«falling rock ‘in 1904. Frank was working with his.
. ‘father when it happened. At the age of '18, he was
left with the responsibility of supporting a family.—

He was the oldest ofisix children.
It was tough working in the same heading where

he had seen his father killed. So, in 1905 Frank left

.Woodward and went to work in the .T.C.I._ ore mines,
where he became a section foreman. For a time ‘he
switched to coal mining in Tuscaloosa County, where
the wages were $1.75 a day.

On June 18, 1914, he returned to work in the
T.C.I. ore mines near Bessemer, and his service with

this companywas not broken until 0ct0ber‘31, 1934, -

when he became a union organizer.

- Organized in '33 s..

Frank recalls that white ~wo1jkers were brought
into the mines increasingly- asmodern machinery was
introduced and as working conditions improved

.Attempts to organize before. the 30-’s had‘ always
failed. As a' boy, he had seen the miners strike; but

with li-ttle, if any, gains.

  Frank Allen—pioneer  

Mine - Mill ﬂrganizer

ON April 1- of this year. Frank Allen was retired- on pension, by action
of the International Executive Board. Brother Allen was the oldest Interna-
tional Representativeon the Mine-Mill staff in terms of both age and length

of service.- _ ‘V ‘

On October 31. 1934, Frank became organizer for the‘ District 5 Union.
He served‘ Mine-Mill as staff member-from that day until his retirement
this year. A few highlights of that service are told in the accompanying

story. i

. Special tribute ‘was paid to Frank Allen by the April meeting of the
Alabama Mine-Mill Council. In recognition ofliis distinguished service to
the union. Brother Allen has been invited to attend the coming conven-

crease in pay, vacations, and other demands. The
solidarity which had prevailed in the 1934 strike,
however, was partially broken up by the company. '

Since. the ’34 strike, the companies had hired
white workers in increasing numbers and had made
every effort to split white from Negro workers and
create‘ division between them. These efforts paid off
to a certain extent during the‘1936 strike when the
companies attempted to reopen the mines and break
the strike. ' i

There was violence. _The National Guard was
called out. i The Mine—Mile members were killed and— '

wounded in the struggle that followed.

(

Par'l'ial.Victory
In spite of"this, the strike ended. in apartial un-

> ion victory, although the companies refused to take

back 145 Negro and white union leaders as “unde-
sirables.”" Still, ore miners had won their first con-
tract, with a wage increase to boot. The 145 “unde-
sirables” were later put back to work (all who were
still living) with back pay‘ by ’the'NLRB. ‘

Brother Allen was given special credit for pre-
paring the charges and digging up theevidence which
resulted in this historic victory-.—one of the most im-
portant of the entire Wagner Act period.

A’ In 193,7,..Brother.Allen was put on the Interna-
tional Staff. He was first assigned to work in-Ten-
nessee, where he contributed to organizationof our
phosphate locals. In 1938, he was involved in the
strike of International Minerals & Chemical Com-

, pany in Middle Tennessee. Although the strike was

lost, it led to NLRB recognition and contracts with
the ‘company. ‘ .

' First Portal-to-Portal Victory
j During 1939 and 1940, Frank was back in“ Ala-

’ bama and was one of the key figures in thedsucessful

campaign to win portal-to-portal pay_ for iron ore
miners. The Mine-Mill miners’ on Red Mountain were
the first in America’ to win this battle.

He continued to work mostly in “Alabama, with

some assistance to our locals in Tenessee, until late‘

in 1943, at which time he was sent by the Interna-
tional to Las Vegas, Nev., to participate in a har -
fought election campaign at the Basic Magnesium

campaign against the Steel raiders at’ Republic or‘

mines.

Next stop was Los Angeles;

~ A Pioneer Negro Leader

While this brief listing of Brother Allen's serviees
to Mine-Mill shows that he has playeda role in
many historic battles, his contribution has gone far
beyond the-immediate outcome of any oruall of them.

Frank Allen was the first, Negro‘ staffmember

of the International Union. He was a pioneer in the '.

struggle for ,Negro-White unity. He was responsible
for development of Negro leadership wherever he
worked, so that what he started has .bleen:carried
forward by many others. ‘i H

CM&S directors reject
pact negotiated May 

TRAIL, B. C.——Members‘ of ‘Mine—Mill Local 480 here, 651'_ at
Kimberley and 690 at Calgary are in a fighting mood ‘after getting.
Word that the Montreal directors of Consolidated“ Mining & Smelting
Co. have turned down an agreement that the joint Mine—Mill bargain?
ing committee made with¢CM&S management. A‘ 

The settlement, reached May 15,. had called for an improvement iv
in the pension plan so that older workers in their last 10 years of
service would not be penalized as the result of classification’ changes.

The agreement had been‘ reached after
recommended by a conciliation officer.

this improvement 0 was 

However, at the last minute, the absentee/directors of thevcompany;
sitting in Montreal repudiated the agreement made bytheir own map-ill,‘
agement as well as" the conciliation service. '1 

Harvey Murphy, chairman of. the union’s bargaining committee,

said: “This is a shocking action. The resp_onsibility for what develops; ’

rests squarely on the absentee CM_&S owners, multi-millionaires who 
disregard the proper processes of-collective bargaining.” 0 

. An emergency meeting of the joint bargaining committee repre-*;;

senting the three locals‘ is to be called to decide on a
of the company’s repudiation of its agreement.

fatal mine accident

URANIUM CITY, Sask. — Judge, L

a member of Mine-Mill, whose muti-
lated body was the sole protest against
the reactionary pol'cies of the Eldo.-A‘
rado Mine, a Crown company, andthe.
antiquated Saskatchewan labor code. C’ T

The jury, five of them government,-—-it

employees and the other a banker, was
selected by the Royal Canadian Mount-

ed Police, also government employees,’ ‘T’
and the coroner as well works for the
government. The RCMP conducted  of‘
entire proceedings, and thatin a very‘ 3 ~

arbitrary a"ird domineering manner.
Needless to say, such a setup result-,
ed in a complete exoneration of the
company, the chief mines
giving a_ perfect bill of health_to the

’ operation while at the same time ex-2,
posing (inadvertently) the inadequacy , 

of the provincial labor laws. . .

He testified that as far as he could , I:

see no regulations were violated, that’

it is not necessary in Saskatchewan to, "'0

wear hard hats, or lamps, or any pro-L
tective clothing, and that only where

a double shot is being fired under- 

ground is it necessary to have two

men. Guard rails, he said, are also "

“unnecessary” in this province.

“Looks as if it’s ‘unnecessary’ rforiifl

marked grimly.

message that came from a 2-day na-

Sponsored‘ by the United Electrical

REPLY TO CARL BORUP

‘To the Editor:

I don’t knowwhether you have room
in your paper for comments on the
article “Company ‘E c o n o in i c s’ vs.
Facts” by Carl Borup.

.How can you buy back what you pro-
duce or the products of your fellow
man? In the year 1850, out of each
dollar's worth produced, the worker re-
ceived 65c; the employer, 35c. By 1875,

“ slavery .went out, steam came in and
it was 40c for the_work'er; 60c for the

employer. In 1900, with. electricity,
there was more production——the work-
er got_,15c; the employer, 85c. Now,’
it amoimts to no more than 20c for
the worker to 80c, for the employer.

Se panic and depressions come and
go according to the WARS we can
have to dispose of the surplus, for the
worker cannot buy back what he or
she produces‘.

As a regular reader of THE UN-

some ‘of the questions propounded to
them by the McCarran committee.

The article in the April 8 issue of
THE UNION was most interesting.
As far as. Communism goes, when I
was in high school—-and studied the

forms of government, «I was ripe for"

communism'—-in’fact what I understood
about that form of government, I was
already a communist. It seemedvto be

And. as. to the membership having

do not believe that that is their major
‘concern. What the membership should
know is—Are these officers giving to
the Union the. ‘best service possible,
and are they getting results? Those
two questions should'be the. major rea-
sons for retaining their officers in
their positions. Minor questions as to
methods, of course‘, play 92' part but
service and results are the most im-
port'ant.and"the officers’ private be-
liefs have little or no_ bearing on the
matter.

the Northwest have joined witlrotlier
interested o'rganizations.\i'n mounting
acampaign designed to stop the Wall
Street tl1ievery.and' to proceed with
the long overdue Hell’s Canyon dam.

In the last -two weeks, two protest
meetings have been held-one in Lew-
iston, Idaho, and "the other here in
Portland‘. Both were spearheaded and
organized by the Idaho-Oregon Hell’s
Canyon ‘Association, an organization

dam supporters for several years. § . .
The-Portland meeting on May -23‘,

This was mainly because it was held - ~

later; opposition. to the McKay deci-
sion hasbeen snowballing daily. The
Portland meeting went far beyond the
ranks of the “hard core” of stalwarts
who have been championingvthe cause
of public power against private power.
The Portland meeting embraced scores
of new ‘organizations that up to now
have remained indifferent to the Hells

Canyon fight.

‘Save the river‘

The conference was called under the
slogan of “Save the River.” It was at-

tended by representatives of all -Ina-\‘

and by spokesmen for Farmers Union

in _a, long’ time that drew Itepresenta-,
tives of the AFL, CIO,'and such inde-
pendent unions as Mine-Mill and the
Marine, Cooks and _VStewai'ds.

The meeting came up with a plan
for. permanent organization that will
unite the supporters of Hell’s Canyon
dam throughout the northwest, regard-
less of_their specific interests. Mine-
Mill will become a p211‘t—i0f the new or-
ganization, in addition to maintaining
its present position of support for the
Hell’s Canyon association. '

Battle line

The purpose of the new, enlarged
group is succinctly put in the-"call to
the conference _by Albert C. ' Ullnian,'
Baker, Oregon, realtor, who is chair-’
man of the -Hell’s Canyon Association.
The call, read: ‘ . ’

“Only through a. spontaneous upris-
ing of the people and organizations of
the regi'on can this ‘ onslaught be
stopped. The. sound and widespread

benefits of the federal system can yet i

be saved. The battle line is Hell’s Can-
yon: ‘all the future issues are tied up
in this one.” ‘

THE FIRST GOAL of _the'o‘pponents
of the lVIcKay-Eisenhower. “sellout”
will be to stop construction of the Ox-
bow “dam on the Snake river by the
Idaho Power company, a utility incor-
porated in Maine and controlled ‘by

. New -York and Boston capital. It is the

West’s new “Oxbow’in‘cident.” Wheth-
er this is to be done by lawsuit or oth-
er methods/,. is still to be determined.
This much is certain; the-Eisenhower
administration will get away with its
brazen deal onlyif it decides to‘ endure
and ignore the heat of public» opinion

‘that is blazing up and down the river

canyons of the Pacific Northwest.
Mine-Mill was also amply ‘repre-
sented at the earlier Lewiston meet-
ing, highlight of which was a Demo-
cratic party luncheon for National
Chairman Stephen Mitchelliof Chi-
cago. As one Hell’s Canyon supporter
put it later: “Mitchell gave the Good
Housekeeping seal of approval to our‘
fight.” Mitchell did put the Demo-
cratic party squarely on record in sup-
port of Hell’s Canyon and in opposi-

_tion to the McKa'5*‘mutiliation plan.

Mine‘-Mill represented
Besides representation,.from the In-
ternational office, Mine-Mill was rep-

resented in Lewiston by Warren Hen-_

derson, Local 18 busines agent from

~Coeur;d’Alene mining district, and

Int’l Rep. Lou Cochran.

The key to the Hell’s Canyon fight. .. 
is the fact that the proposed federal L“ .
dam is a storage project, providing 
water\for power and other needs in the
winter when the river flow _is "low. _
The Idaho Power company dam would‘ 
not" .be a storage dam—nor would‘; 
other small dams it is proposing "for
the Snake. Without the huge storage
potential of Hell’s Canyon, the com-.,
prehensive development of the Colum-"~5-
bia and its tributaries would be 
ruined. As Mrs. Pfost told the House: __

“"he real issue boiled " down is9; ,
whether we are willing to sacrifice thisf
magmficent dam site for partial de-
velopment and one purpose alone, or “H
whether we are going to develop this'1W'
precious natural resource for as many’ I
purposes as-it can serve and for the"
benefit of all the people. It is incon.
ceivable to me that we will allow this _
great dam site to be squandered.” ’

THE HELL’S CANYON dam’sito 
lies on the Snake river between Ore-
gon and Idaho,‘ 90 miles north of 
Weiser, Idaho. Construction of .the‘'_“
dam would create a reservoir 90 miles»-',\‘
long to Weiser, storing 3,800,000 acre’; - .-
feet of water. According to Mrs. Pfost, .-
the d'am would add 1,124,000 kilowatts
of prime power to the systen; of exist'- I
mg and authorized federal generating: 
plants, partly at the dam" itself, partly‘ V ‘
by increasing the potential capacities)-

Part of the'union’s program to fight‘
