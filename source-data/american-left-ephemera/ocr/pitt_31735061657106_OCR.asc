Note: This Act, described by‘experts in constitutional law as

"the first peacetime sedition law in the history of the
United States," became effective in June, 19h0 —— at a time when
liberals were unaware of the attack of people's rights being
secreted in its provisions for later use.

The Smith Act was first used in 19b0, to effect Registra-
tion and Fingerprinting of all aliens in the United States. It
was used sparingly during the war years, but in the post—war’years,
beginning in 19h6, it was increasingly invoked for deportation
purposes in a special and calculated attack on foreign born leaders
and active members of trade unions, nationality groups, fraternal
and other organizations. From 19ho to 19h9 nearly 1hO had been
Among them were John Santo,
Transport workers Union leader then leading a strike for higher wages;'
Irving Potash of the Furriers Joint Council, in process of contract
negotiations; Charles Doyle of the Chemical Workers; Ferdinand Smith,
famous Negro leader of the National Maritime Union; Peter Harisiades,
editor of a Greek newspaper; ieorge Pirinsky, secretary of the Ameri.
can Slav Congress...and othersfrom many oth r trade unions and ne-
tionalityigroups,

The alien-baiting hysteria which accompanied this deportation
drive was designed to pave the way for attacks on citizens, on the
grounds that they were propagating "alien" ideas. The "peacetime
sedition” sections of the Smith act were invoked against the national
leadership of the Communist Party, and since then have been used to
indict leading Communists throughout the country, including the 15
California victims presently being held in jail in lieu of $50,000;
bail each.

The following summary indicates the main sections of the
Smith Act used in the current attack. The Act contains four titles
and numerous sections. V

Includes, in "military or naval forces," merchant vessels
commissioned by or in the service of the Army or Navy.

Sect. 2 Makes it unlawful for any person -

(1) to knowingly or wilfully advocate, abet, advise or teach the
duty, necessity, desirability or propriety of overthrowing or destroying
any government in the United States by force or violence, or by the assess-
ination of any officer of any such government; »

(2) with the intent to cause the overthrow or destruction of any
government in the United States, to print, publish, edit, issue, circulate,
sell, distribute, or publicly display any written or printed matter advocat-
ing, advising, or teaching the duty, necessity, desirability, or propriety of
oveithrowing or destroying any government in the United States by force or
vio ence. ‘ A .

(3) to organize or help to organize any society, group, or assembly
of persons who teach, advocate, or encourage the overthrow or destruction of
any government in the United States by force or violence; or to become a mem-
ber of, or affiliate with, any such society, group or assembly of persons,
knowing the purposes thereof.

(Other sections of Title I authorize seizure of documents under
warrant, if related to above; state penalties of imprisonment

for "not more than ten years" and fines of "not more than $10,000”
upon conviction; bars government employment for five years follow-
ing conviction.)

TITLE II (DEPORTATIONS): .

(Amends previous immigration acts, stating various grounds for
deportation, among them smuggling of aliens into the United
States; illegal possession of automatic or semi-automatic
weapons, or sawed-off shotguns; and any alien -

"who at any time within five years after entry, shall have been convicted of
violating the provisions of Title I of the Alien Registration Act, l9hO."
(see above) ' V A V '

(and further amends the Immigration Act.of 1918 to read:

"Any alien who was at the time of entering the United States, or has been

at any time thereafter, a member of any one of the classes of aliens enumer-
ated in Section 1 of this Act, shall, upon warrant of the Attorney General,
be taken into custody and deported in the manner provided in the Immigration
Act of February 5, l9l7._ The provisions of this Section shall be applicable
to the classes of aliens mentioned in this Act, irrespective of the time of
their entry into the United States.” ' '

 

    

 

TITLE III

 

(Note: Prior to passage of the McCarran Act, these sections of
Title II of the Smith Act were used as the basis for
deportation arrests. Hearings under such warrants were used to
prove "advocacy of force or violence" to overthrow the govern-
ment of the United States; and this had to be associated with
membership in an organization as defined in Section 1. In this
Act the Communist Party as such is not mentioned by name. The
Mccarran Act, however, legislates "guilt" of "advocacy of force or
violence"by membership in the Communist Party; hence many old de-
portation cases ordered to be reheard, and most new cases coming
within the purview of the committees for protection of foreign
born for defense purposes, are charged under the Mccarran Act,
usually on grounds of past or present membership in the Communist
Party, and "evidence" by professional stool-pigeons to this effect
is considered sufficient grounds for issuance of a deportation order.)

(REGISTRAEION) :

(Orders Registration and Fingerprinting of all aliens entering
the country by visa; all aliens when they reach the age of four-
teen years; all aliens residing in the United States when this
lawkaecame effective in 19h0; . v

(Sets forth penalties for refusal or failure of aliens or their
guardians or parents to meet these requirements; or for making
false statements, etc.) ‘ '

(Thus nearly five million resident aliens were fingerprinted and
registered in 19b0. Present estimates of the non—citizen popu-
lation range from three to three and a half millions, not counting
the Mexican, west Indian and other agricultural workers imported

to harvest crops, then summarily deported back where they came from.)

‘TITLE IV (States the title of the Act as a whole; states the usual "safeguard"

_dpowa 253

against Act as a whole being held "invalid" if any of its parts are
held invalid. , ‘ ‘

(This, the first police—state type of law since Jeffersonls day
passed into effect without protest excepting from the progressive
organizations who were alert to its implications. The "peacetime
sedition" provisions were "slipped in” to an Act generally viewed
at time of its passage as an attempt to control and curb Nazi and
fascist propagandists. (Its actual aim, to outlaw ideas and activi-
ties designed to achieve peace and social progress, have since been
made evident in the manufactured hysteria against "aliens" and
"alien doctrines" through which Communists,have been jailed and are
threatened with jail, in eflect, illegalizing any party advocating
social change.) A ‘ * ’
