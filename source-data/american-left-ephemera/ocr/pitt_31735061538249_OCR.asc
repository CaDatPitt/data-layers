on one single holiday, and they worked on many such
holidays during the war. I

’Now, however, the war is over and labor’s no-strike
pledge is no longer in force. This does not mean, of
course, that the workers should rush helter—ske1ter into
strikes to secure their wage demands. Strikes are very seri-
ous actions for workers and should not be undertaken
without serious consideration. Workers understand this
very well. It is true that a number of strikes have occurred
during the present wage movement, provoked by stubborn
capitalist resistance to justified wage demands, but the
number and extent of these have been grossly exaggerated
by the reactionary capitalist press in order to poison pub-
licopinion against the labor movement.

One very important thing that the workers should bear
carefully in mind in the present wage movement is the
need for the broadest and best disciplined solidarity, par-
ticularly where strikes are involved. In the face of the
highly—organized employers, the unions should generally
follow an industry-wide, national wage strategy, instead of
attempting to concentrate against this or that individual
employer. Also, groups of industries, on; the basis of uni-
ﬁed demands, should act together. Indeed, the best wage
strategy would require that the A. F. of L., C.I.O., Rail-
road Brotherhoods, Coal Miners and independent labor
unions should come together in a national conference and
prepare demands for general wage increases for the entire
working class.

VVhere strikes become unavoidable, due to an intransi-

y gent attitude on the part of the employers and the Admin-

istration, they. should be conducted in a resolute and dis-
ciplined manner. They should be well-organized, for the
trade unions face the most powerful capitalist class in the
world. Jurisdictional strikes should be ruled out as‘: sheer
poison, for nothing hurts the trade unions more, internally
\ 

. ,...-4.;,.i

and in public opinion, than these destructive inner con-
‘ ‘troversies. Wildcat strikes should also be avoided where-
ever possible. In this respect, however, it must be said
that when wildcat strikes occur they are almost always the
result of extreme employer provocations and the failure I
of conservative union leaders to move to protect the inter— 1
. ests of the workers concerned. Our labor history has many
such “unauthorized” strikes, some of them national in
character. The recent New York rank-and—ﬁle strike of
longshoremen was typical in this respect, of employer
provocation andoﬂicial union inaction. Once in a while,
however, as in the recent Hayes-Kelsey auto parts strike
in Detroit, Trotskyite and other disrupters managed to
pull out workers in conﬂict with their own interests and .
with the union’s wage policy. I y y
Theitrade unions must, in this situation, pay close at- 
tention to the question of company unionism. Despite» ‘
the Wagner Act, there are still many company unions in
the -industries, and the employers, to combat the spread
of real trade unionism, will undoubtedly organize many
more. Often the workers have illusions about such—or-
ganizations being helpful to them. In dealing with such
unions, therefore, it is not adequate merely to make‘ head-
on attacks against them. Particular attention must be paid
to winning them from the inside. Recent American labor
history is full of instances when company unions were
either won over to the labor “movement or broken up by 5
the efforts of workers within them to use .them as the in— ‘J
struments for achieving their economic demands. ;.
In‘ this period, when the country is anxious to get back a
to peacetime production, the unions necessarily have to 
give serious consideration to the question of arbitration l
as a means of adjusting their demands. But here a sharp
warning is very necessary. The workers must be alertly
‘T on guard against every attempt to force compulsory ar-
. . ‘ 11 .

bitration upon them, whether by law, by the pressure of
the Administration or by the weight of the reactionary
press. The workers must watch out that arbitration does
not become just a convenientmeans for the employers to
defeat the demands of the workers. These few words of
caution about arbitration must therefore be sounded.
First, arbitration must, when entered into, be purely upon
a voluntary basis; second, the workers involved should
look very carefully at the composition of the arbitration
board; and third, it is a good practice to secure as much
as possible of their demands beforehand by direct nego-
tiation, referring only the remaining unresolved questions
to arbitration. - i

To facilitate its movement for better wages, the labor A

movement should insist that the wartime controls over
wage increases be removed. Legal limitations on the right

, to strike, as incorporated in the notorious Smith-Connally

Act, should also be done away with. The war is over, and
there is no need for the continuance of such restrictive
limitations upon the basic rights of the workers.

Labor should insist, however, that price controls must
be maintained. This is indispensable. For if the pur-
chasing power of the masses is to be maintained, the highly
organized employers must not be allowedto boost prices
as they see ﬁt. In years past, when the national interest
imperatively demanded it, the government took away from
the railroads the right to jack up freight and passenger
rates, and it turned the control of such matters over to the
Interstate Commerce Commission. In line with this same
general principle, the national interest now demands that
prices generally shall be kept as low as‘ possible and wages
raised to as high levels as are practicable (if we are to
avoid the most devastating effects of future economic
crises). Hence, a larger government control over prices
than has ever existed before in peacetime must be devel-

12 ‘,'

" ‘J,

oped. But, of course, this price control will have to be
operated far more in the public interest than has ever
been the case with the Interstate Commerce Commission
which has always been heavily under the influence of the
great railroad kings.

Unify of ’rhe Wages and Jobs Sfruggle

One of the most important lessons that organized labor
must fully grasp in the postwar period we are now enter-
ing into, if it is to protect the workers’ interests success-
fully, is that the struggle for better wages and the ﬁght to
create more jobs for_the workers are inseparable. They
are both part of one broad general struggle to protect the
economic interestsof the workers. This is not as simple
a proposition as it appears on the surface, and labor must
consciously strive to keep the two phases of the general
struggle constantly in mind. For if either is neglected,
both will suffer. 9 ‘

During many years, in the recurring economic crises, it
was a great weakness of A. F. of L. unions to concentrate
their attention almost exclusively upon protecting the con-
ditions of the employed workers and to allow the unem-
ployed to shift pretty much for themselves. Indeed, it was
as late as 1934 before the A. F. of L. top leaders even began
seriously to demand relief and insurance for the unem-
ployed. Such a one—sided policy, of short-sightedly neglect-
ing the welfare of the unemployed of course, in turn, re-
acted also against the interest of the workers who held
jobs. , ' ‘
In the present situation there is deﬁnitely a danger of
such unwise policies being followed by some unions. Thus,
in the big attention being now paid to the burning ques-
t-ionvof wage increases, there is a distinct tendency to neg-
lect the no less vital matter of the struggle to provide jobs
and relief for the unemployed. A proof of this neglect is

13

to be found in the fact that although the reactionaries in
Congress are busily slashing to pieces President Truman’s
proposals looking toward providing safeguards against the
developing unemployment, and his plans for full employ-
ment, the unions, with few exceptions, are paying very
little attention to the matter; .

This is a great weakness. We are now entering into a
period of mass unemployment, with the danger of a major
economic crisis looming not far ahead for us; hence, at all
costs, we should secure the “full employment” legislation
now pending in Congress, in the shape of the Murray Bill
and President Truman's recommendations. Therefore, as
the workers press on for improved wages they must also
imperatively demand the enactment into law of the prin-
ciples of President Roosevelt’s Economic Bill of Rights. If
this is not done, the future will show that the present
wage increases will be largely cancelled out by the pressure
of the unemployed upon the labor market.

In this linking together of the ﬁght for better wages and
for more jobs, there must also be an organizational tie—up
between the trade unions and the unemployed. Under no
circumstances shouldithe mistake be made that the unem-
ployed be allowed, as in other times of mass joblessness, to
drift away from the trade unions. To prevent this the
unions should keep their unemployed members in good
standing; they should set up committees to look after their

- unemployed workers; they should cultivate all necessary

forms of organizations of their unemployed; they should
participate in all demonstrations and other actions in sup-
port of the “full employment” program. The trade unions,
breaking sharply with. conservative policies of the past,
must constantly be conscious of their great task to defend
the economic protection of the unemployed and to ﬁght

for the maintenance of employment at the highest possible

levels.
14

Unify of ’rhe Economic and Poliﬁcal Sfruggle

In carrying through their present ﬁght for better wages
and more jobs the workers must understand, as never be-
fore, the need to carry on their struggle upon both the
economic and political ﬁelds simultaneously. This is a les-
son of supreme importance to the workers. Their whole
future depends upon the extent to which they grasp it.

The day is gone when the workers could settletheir

economic and other demands simply by negotiating with

the employers, with the government playing only a minor,
if any part at all in these negotiations. Todw all impor-
tant economic questions concerning the workers-wages,
hours, prices, production, etc.—have become largely politi-
cal issues of the ﬁrst magnitude. This was true, not only
in the war period that we have just been through but it
will also be the case, under different conditions of course,
in the peacetime perspective ahead of us. The unions
therefore must combine political action with strike action
and collective bargaining. The old Gompers slogan “N 0
politics in the unions” is hopelessly out of date. It is not
only obsolete, but highly dangerous. Now the workers,
on pain of disaster to themselves, must become organized
and active politically.

In their political activities the workers must also con-
cern themselves not only with matters dealing directly
with their own economic conditions, but also with our
whole national and international political life in general.
Today the capitalist system of the world is in a deepening
crisis, and this crisis gives birth to a host of vital political
problems‘ which the workers, along with other democratic
forces, must actively help solve. Failure to do this would

mean to bring down disaster upon the heads of the work-‘_

ers and the whole people.

The great monopolists, the mainspring of reaction in

 

 

W, ,  .,._..‘.m».v«.—.x,»a.~».».~,a,v-v«'-v~va-*""'*”“.»,- \ ~ ""'“'

 

the UnitedC..States., are determined to still further tighten
their gripsu-pon Congress in the relectionsof ‘I946. They
also want to cripplethe trade unions by " "hostile legisla-

tion, of which the Burton-Ball-Hatch. Bill is a current ex-

ample. This situation lays the imperative task upon’ the
shoulders oﬁorganized labor to mobilize politically all its
own forces and those of its natural al1ies——farmers, profes-
sionals, small businessmen, veterans, etc.—so that the: 1946
elections may be made into a greatidemocratic victory for
the whole American people.

Organized labor must also bring its great forces politi-
cally to bear to block the present drive of American im-
perialistic forces to dominate theworld. This imperialist
‘drive,--which has behind it the great monopolies and trusts
of this country, is manifest in every phase of our foreign
policy-—in our failure to take drastic steps to root out fas-

- cism in Germany and Japan, in our attempts to dominate

the trade of the world, in our maintenance‘ of a gigantic
military, naval and air force, including the atomic bomb,
in our policy of “getting tough” with the 'U.S.S.R., etc.
Such policies are full of danger to the American people
and the world. They point the way to fascism, economic
chaos, and another world war, Organized labor, there-
fore, has the historic task of balking the imperialists’ plans
and of inﬂuencing our foreign policies in the direction

‘laid down at the famous conferences of Moscow, Teheran,

Yalta, San Francisco and Potsdam.-

.A further, especially urgent reason why labor must pay
particular attention to organized political action-,lis the
sharp tendencies of the Truman Administration to surren-
der to the forces of reaction and imperialism. Although

 

President Truman has pledged himself to carry out the '
policies laid down by former President Roosevelt, obvious-R

ly he is not doing so. More and more his policies yield

toward reaction, both on the domestic and: international

17

ﬁelds. It is a dangerous fact that today in Congress the
voice of Herbert Hoover is much more hearkened to than
is that of President Truman, both regarding domestic and
international policies. Organized labor, therefore, must

bestir itself to defeat reaction and to have the broad poli- ’
cies associated with the name of Roosevelt carried into ef-

fect. And clearly, from the strength of the drive of the
reactionaries, it will require the full strength of labor and
its friends to accomplish this purpose.

In the 1944 elections, organized labor, in such organi-

zations as the Political Action Committee of the C.I.O.,'

Legislative Committees in the A. F. of L., etc., worked out
the general forms along which the political struggle should
be prosecuted. But, reaction on the offensive, organized
labor must organize its forces far better and be much
more active than it was during the great election struggle
of 1944.

Finally, the trade unions must sharply oppose the Ran-
kin House Committee on un-American activities, the
resurrected Dies Committee. This committee is a com-
bination of Hitlerian red-baiting, Japanese “dangerous
thought” persecution, and Salem witch—hui._ Its pur-
pose is, by creating a fascist-like red-scare, to provide a
smoke-screen behind which the power-greedy monopolists

‘can carry on their programﬂof reaction in this country

and of imperialist aggression abroad. The Rankin Com-
mittee, in the Hitler tradition, starts out by attacking the
Communists, but it soon develops its real program, which
is to undermine the trade unions and to weaken every-
thing progressive in the United States. Organized labor
must not, as often in the past, stand aside andtlet this
imitation Gestapo carry on. its activities unmolested. The
unions must realize that it is a bread and butter question,
involving their whole struggle for wages and jobs, that it

is, in fact, a life and death matter for them generally, to

18

defeat and to force the dissolution of the fascist—breeding - i

Rankin Committee.

The Unify of Labor's and fhe Naﬁon's Inieresfs

One of the most basic phases of organized labor’s wage
and job strategy is the necessity of making the people at
large realize that theydemands of the workers for better
wages and adequate jobs is not merely the concern of the
workers, but is in the most fundamental interest of the
whole nation. For only if the purchasing power of the
workers is maintained by providing the workers with jobs
and good wages, can the country’s great industrial machine
be kept in operation. .

Of course, organized labor, for many years past, has al-
ways tried to win the supportof the public behind its
demands for better economic conditions for the workers.
But this was done largely upon a humanitarian basis.
Now, however, the approach must be fundamentally dif-
ferent. The people at large must be made to understand
that the demands of organized labor for jobs and better
wages arevital to their own interests, and that the alterna-
tive is chronic mass unemployment, wholesale prostration
of industry and hard times for everybody. By the same
token, organized labor must also show the people that

' ‘its democratic proposals generally are in the national in-

terest. -

V Very much of organized labor’s success in the future will
depend upon the degree to which it manages to convince
“public opinion” that its program is in the national inter-
est, and to which it succeeds in mobilizing the people gen-
erally behind its demands. Unfortunately, however, many

labor leaders, particularly those at the top of the A. F. of

L.‘ grossly underestimate the necessity of winning to their
side the greatdemocratic masses of the American people.
The necessity for winning the broad masses of farmers,

professionals, veterans, small businessmen, etc., to support
its program, entails certain heavy responsibilities upon the
trade union leadership. For one thing, these leaders will
have to think. and act more in terms of the national inter-
est, giving particular attention to the speciﬁc demands of
the other democratic strata of the population. They must
also work out practical forms of political cooperation with

all these elements in a great national democratic coalition. _

Local and national conferences with these forces are very
much in order. Organized labor must break down the
spirit of isolation which has characterized many of its con-
servative leaders up till now. - '

Above all, the trade unions must establish good work-
ing collaboration with the ex-servicemen and women’. The
trade unions must become the ardent champions ‘of the

‘ legitimate demands of these decisive forces, and work out

every practical means of collaboration with them. Es-
pecially, the workers must establish labor posts in all the
veterans’ organizations. ' Under no circumstances should

the N.A.M. and other reactionary employer forces be al-.
lowed to succeed in their nefarious scheme of driving a

wedge between the war veterans and the workers. That
would be a menace to our American democracy, whereas

a good working alliance between organized labor and the A

veterans would be the best guarantee of success in the ﬁght
to secure full employment, to strengthen this country’s
democracy, to maintain world peace and to defeat Ameri-
can reaction’s attempt to dominate the world.

The trade unions, in order to tie the workers’ interests
in tightly with those of other democratic segments of our
population, must especially become active in the ﬁght of
the masses against rising living costs. They must convince
the people at large that the employers are well able to
meet the present wage demands of the workers out of their
fabulous reserves and current proﬁts, without raising

prices. They must also convince the “public” that the
adoption of a full employment program would in itself
bring about a huge reduction in production costs, and
would enable the granting of still higher wages. In short,
the people must be convinced not only that the better
utilization of our great industrial machine will allow of
higher wages, shorter hours, and lower prices, but also that
to achieve these objectives is in the vital interest of the
whole American people, save a small minority of monopo-
lists and other exploiters who seem to believe that Amer-
ica was created simply for their private enrichment and to
satisfy their love of power.

All this means, necessarily, that the trade unions will
have to carry on far more elaborate campaigns of public
enlightenment than they have ever done before. The
employers fully ‘understand the vital importance of win-
ning public opinion; hence their elaborate campaigns on
the radio, in the press, in Congress and elsewhere in sup-
port of their reactionary programs. This should be a sig-
nal to organized labor to revamp completely its obsolete
methods of reaching the people’s mind and to adopt mod-
ern methods of publicity on a huge scale. Labor must
“sell” its case to the people at large as never before.

Tasks in Perspecﬁve

The foregoing are some of the most urgent tasks needful
to accomplish if organized labor is to win its ﬁght for bet-
ter wages and more jobs—that is, there must be more unity
in the ranks of labor itself, there must be a linking up of
the wages and job struggles, there must be a tying to-’
gether of the economic and political struggles of the work-
ers, and there must bean identiﬁcation of the demands
of labor with the interests of the nation as a whole, and
the building up of a great democratic coalition upon the
basis of these common interests. The success of organized

labor in the present and the period ahead, the extent to
which it achieves better living standards and job protec-
tion, will depend upon the measure in which it grasps
these elementary lessons of the present situation.

But! organized labor must needs go beyond the conﬁnes
of these immediate tasks. The time is now at hand when
the trade unions of this country will have to analyze far
more basically the system under which we live than they
have ever done before, and to adopt from their analysis,
far-reaching social programs of progress.

The world capitalist‘ system is sick, very sick. Proof of
this is the fact that capitalism, during the past generation,
has given birth to two devastating world wars, to a shatter-
ing world economic crisis, and to the deadly disease of
fascism. And now, although we have just ﬁnished a war

' that has laid Europe and a large part of Asia in ruins,

 

already the reactionaries are. talking glibly of a new world
war ahead ‘of us. And the peoples of the capitalist world,
famished and destitute, are now looking with terror to-
wards new economic crises and mass unemployment in
their war-ravaged countries. ‘

A The tortured and impoverished masses of Europe and
Asia, in the midst of wrecked cities, ruined industries and
collapsed political systems, are taking emergency methods
to protect themselves under the tottering capitalist sys-
tem, by nationalizing the banks and basic industries, by
breaking up the big landed estates, and by democratizing
their governments. But more and more they are getting
their eyes fastened upon the real social evil, the capitalist
system itself. Nor will they rest content until they have
ﬁnally abolished capitalism altogether, and, through the
establishment of Socialism, bring about the socialization
of the great means of production and the abolition of the
exploitation of man by man for proﬁts’ sake. For Social-
ism is the only means by‘ which peace, democracy and

 

 

prosperity can be guaranteed, both on a national and in-
ternational scale. The existence of the U.S.S.R. has dem-
onstrated this great historical fact.

The American social system, despite all its present
seeming strength, is a blood brother to the decaying capi-

talist system of Europe and Asia, and it is subject to the /

same basic laws of economic and political development
that have ﬂung the old world capitalism into its present
ruinous plight. Our country, too, is involved in the deep-
ening general crisis of capitalism. American workers,
therefore, must necessarily start to study our capitalism
through and through and, in the light of Marxist-Leninist
science, begin to orientate upon the Socialist perspective
that is becoming so obviously needed in the rest of the
world.

The United States is very rich in natural resources, in
great industries, and in trained manpower—the wealth-
producing capacity of which will be enormously increased
by the development of atomic power. But the greed of
the monopolists—with their program of low wages and re-
stricted production-'—stands in the way of realizing the po-
tential well-being of the masses that our national wealth
and industrial development make possible. By organiz-
ing their forces thoroughly, theaworkers and their allies
can, under capitalism, win for themselves a measure of
well-being, a degree of protection against the recurrent
economic crises. But only under Socialism, with the social
means of production owned by the whole people, will

America realize its great historical dream and become

truly an unsurpassed land of liberty, peace and well-being.

THE STRIKE SITUATION
And Organized Laborls Wage and Job Sfrafegy

‘ By WILLIAM z. FOSTER

In this early postwar period the workers throughout
the United Statesare demanding wage increases, gener-
ally running to about 30 per cent. This is one of the
broadest wage movements in American history, involving
many industries——stee1, auto, machine building, radio-
electric, railroad, oil, marine transport, building, lumber,
coal, textile, printing,~~motion pictures, etc.-—~and it is
being led by A. F. of L}, C.I.O\., and independent unions.

The basis of the present huge. wage movement is the .
workers’ resistance to the general slash in take-home pay ‘

that has occurred since the ending of the war——through
the elimination of overtime, the down—grading of pay

I rates, etc. During the war the workers’ wages lagged far

behind the rise in living costs. By applying the “Little

Steel” formula, which restricted basic wage rate increases I

to not more than 15 per cent above the rates in effect on
January 1,'l9_41, the War Labor Board ignored the fact
that the cost of living had actually advanced about 50 per
cent during this period, as the ﬁgures of both the A. F.
of L. and C.I.O. clearly demonstrate. And, of course, the
work/ers’ wages failed to keep pace with the gigantic war-
time proﬁts of the employers which, after paying taxes,
averaged three times higher than the pre-war year 1939.
The bosses have been indulging in a regular orgy of
proﬁt-grabbing while labor was making war.

, In order to carry through their wage demands, which ‘

are inextricably bound up Wlth the problems of furnish- ‘

ingijobs and relief to the unemployed, it is indispensable
that the workers proceed along the lines of a deﬁnite strat-
egy calculated to mobilize the maximum of support be-
hind their proposals. This pamphlet indicates some of
the major lines necessary to such a strategy.

The Unify of Organized Labor

It is becoming increasingly clear that the Truman Ad- A

ministration, in spite of its pledges to carry out the
Roosevelt policies, is yielding to the pressure of the bosses
and is sacriﬁcing the most elementary economic needs of
the workers. Therefore, the workers must look, in ﬁrst
line, to the strength of their own organizations, particu-

larly the trade unions, to put through their wage demands. L

This especially emphasizes the need, in this critical post-
war period, for the greatest possible unity within the
ranks of the workers. -

First, in this respect, it is necessary to soften, or to do
away entirely with, the warfare that the top leaders of
the A. F ., of L. and the U.M.W.A. are waging against the
C.I.O. The attempts of such men _as William Green, Mat-
thew Woll, W. L. Hutcheson, David Dubinsky,‘ John L.
Lewis, etc., to destroy the C.I.O. in the postwar period, are
a crime against the whole labor movement. Their hopes
that the C.I.O.. will fall to pieces after the war (with
them/helping to destroy it) are apparent. Were the A. F. of
L. to succeed in breaking the C.I.O. it would ruin not.
only labor’s hard-won organization in the trustiﬁed‘ indus-

‘ tries, but it would also undermine the whole position of

the A. F. of L. itself. One can hardly imagine anything
more suicidal to the workers’ interests than the ﬁght of
the A. F. of L. reactionaries against the C.I.O., a ﬁght
from which only the employers can beneﬁt and which

dovetails exactly with the union-smashing program of the v

National Association of Manufacturers.

The lower bodies of the A. F. of ‘L.—the international
unions, state federations, city labor councils and local
unions—shou1d take a hand in this situation and insist

9 upon a cooperative policy being followed by their top

leaders toward the C.I.O. During the present wage move-
ments many ﬁne examples of A. F. of L.-C.I.O. collabora-
tion have developed in various industries and localities.
These are steps in the right direction, and they should be

' followed through vigorously. Such local and industrial

cooperative movements should be forerunners of a general
get-together policy by the A. F. of L. and C.I.O. If the
rank and ﬁle of labor will take a determined stand in
this unity matter, even the hardest boiled reactionaries in
the A. F. of L. Executive Council will have to pay
attention.

A second vital consideration in the present big move-
ment to protect wages and to provide jobs is the need
to extend trade union organization still further into the
vast ranks of the unorganized. There are still many mil-
lions of workers outside the labor unions—especially
workers in the manufacturing industries», white collar
workers, agricultural workers and workers in small towns.
These workers all feel the need for higher. wages and will
readily respond to trade union organizing campaigns. The
question of organizing the unorganized, therefore, should

now be made a central issue throughout the labor move— ,

ment. Organized labor will make a big mistake if it does
not utilize the present wage movement to greatly strength-
en itself by drawing several millions of new workers into

its ranks. Such increased trade union strength is deeply,

needed for the big tasks ahead in protecting the workers’
and the nations’ interests in every sphere of our eco-
nomic and political life.

Thirdly, in order to solidify its own ranks, organized
labor must also pay special attention to defending the

interests of Negro workers, particularly in -connection

with their right to work. This is a solidarity question of

the highest order. As matters stand now, the Negro work-
ers, usually the lowest on the seniority lists, the last to be
hired and the ﬁrst to be ﬁred, are being literally swept
out of the war plants, and, with few honorable exceptions,

_ the unions are doing very little to protect the Negroes’

rights to jobs. Aside from the injustice to the Negroes in
this,’ the danger is that such alsituation might enable the
employers to drive a wedge between the white and Negro
workers, a split which would be a major setback for the
entire labor movement. This, the unions must avoid‘ at all
costs. If organized labor understands its true interests it
will pay triple attention to the burning question of de-
fending the Negroes’ right to work and see to it’ that a
due percentage of them are kept in the plants. This will
require certain local variations of the seniority system.
Fourthly, under the general headlof unifying 1abor’s

: forces, the A. F. of L. should affiliate to the newly-formed

World Federation of Trade Unions, which now has some
70,000,000 members. Such an action would greatlylhelp
the workers everywhere in all their ﬁghts for better eco-
nomic and political conditions, including those of Ameri-
can workers. The isolationist attitude of the A. F. of L.
top leadership in standing aloof and warring against the
W.F.T.U. is intolerable. Their refusal to participate in this
great international labor federation because the C.I.O.
and the Soviet trade unions are affiliated to it is a scandal
and a disgrace. The new W.F.T.U. will be a great buttress

' to the United Nations and the whole cause of world

peace; hence, the organized workers should compel their
reactionary leaders to aﬂiliate the A. F. of L. to it.

The Question of Sfrikels

Throughout the war the workers submitted to the

injustice of the “Little Steel” formula being enforced
against them, to the detriment of their living conditions.
In a high spirit of patriotism, and being determined to
win the war at all costs, the workers loyally lived up to
their no-strike pledge and kept the industries in full
operation in spite of every provocation from the employers
and profound neglect by the government. Their no-strike
record was splendid. The total loss of time by war-time
strikes was so small that it was more than offset, for ex:
ample, by the extra time put in by the workers in working
