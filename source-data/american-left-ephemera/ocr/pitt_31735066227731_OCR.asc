;A third.major task is the shifting and change in our-methods of work; to guaran-
tee that the outstanding wealth of N gro cadre in the Party and in the progressive
movement can be utilized to play ts full role within and not outside the Negro
liberation.mevement. Here in New York, if all our Negro forces were coordinated
so that our work would be felt in the major political center of Harlem, there is
no doubt that progress could be made in developing a united Negro people's front
of struggle in the Harlem community.

The key objective of this shift of our personnel must‘be to exert its full influ-
ence in the Negro cmunity to crystallize as quickly as possible a united peace
movement on a broad united front basis. ’

Central slogan linking the fight for Negro ndghts with the fight for peace can be
DROP JIM-CROW, NOT TE A-BOMB. 9

The fight against jim-crow in housing must be expanded. The battle around Stuy-
vesant Town and Levittown should take on new proportions in the cming period,

linked as it is with the broad struggle shaping up against rent increases.

A major project for our Party must be a concentrated campaign for support to the
subscription drive of the new anti-tnperialist Negro paper; Freedo.

Among our other tasks are:

1.» Immediate development of stateawide action against the police murder of John
Derrick in Harlem.

2. Active support to the building and strengthening of the New York State NAACP.
3. Major preparations for the celebration of Negro History'Week; with emphasis
on.broad united front celebrations and concrete programs of struggle for

Negro rights.

4. Strengthening the Earty organizations in the Negro cmmawiitios through re-

cruiting, copletion of registration and improving the forms of Party life
in keeping with the national traditions and culture of the Negro people.

5.. AIl—out support to the projected Civil Rights Mobilization in‘ﬂashington.

6. Organize the widest mass protest to save the lives of the Trenton Six_and
Willie McGee, now threatened with execution.

(Excerpts from James Jackson's Report on the South at the
15th National Convention)

The pulse of the Negro people's national consciousness has quickened every-

where. In spite of the formidable appearance of the evil power of the Wall

Street imperialist oppressor, the lesson of Korea and China is that "he can ?
be had," and the attainment of victory by the oppressed is possible in our

generation.

The South is the seat of the oppressed Negro nation in the United States
(with all the revolutionary pcrtent that it holds for the forces of peace and
advancement in our country), as well as the area of the most unrelieved poli-
tical reaction, chauvinism and social backwardness. It is essential that we
analyze and estimate the probable consequences upon the South of the new

NEGRO-PUERTO RICAN UNITY

One of the new features of the national liberation of the 16,000,000 Negro
people of the United States is the beginning of its merger with the worldwide
upsurge of the oppressed nations, colonial, semi-colonial and dependent countries
against United States imperialism.

Of particula significance in this developing anti-imperialist front, indissol-
ubly interwoven with the fight for peace, is the unity of the Negro and Puerto
Rican peoples, a significance which arises from their common oppression bv a
common exploiter, Wall Street. The question of the Negro people is basically
that of a oppressed nation subjected to the most barbarous Jim Crow oppression
and super-exploitation; that of the Puerto Rican people, a colonially oppressed
nation of 2,240,000 people subjected for more than 52 years by U.S. imperialism
to a shameless regime of super-exploitation, of hnger and misery.

Jim Crow Justice is meted out to the Negro people, a horrible example of which
is the frameup and legal lynching of the Martinsville Seven. Likewise, the
Puerto Rican people are subjected to the vicious U.S. imperialist system of
frameup as part of their national oppression. Deusdedit Harrero, young Puerto
Rican fighter for peace, for the freedom and national independence of his country,
has been brazenly framed by U.S. imperialism and its agents, Munoz Marin and
Company. Marrero, now held under $25,000 bail under Law 55, a local MbCarran-
Kilgore Law, is facing tria 1 without jury. He is being condemned for expres-
sing "zeal" in expessing his political ideals, for fighting against the throwing
of the atom bomb, for ‘holding ideas! about the welfare and progress of Puerto
Rico and for advocating independence for Puerto Rico.

In the United States, there are some 550,000 Puerto Ricans resident mainly in
New York city. Here they are subjected to a policy of discrimination and police
brutality. Negro Puerto Ricans, in addition, are suffering all the shameless
indignities inflicted upon the Negro people in the U.S.A.

This national oppression of the Negro and Puerto Rican people is being intensi-
fied by the Wall Street drive to war.

Recognizing the power for peace and progress inherent in the unity of the Negro
and Puerto Rican people, both of whom are displaying a rising mdlitance, U.S.
monopoly and its political agents are trying to drive a wedge between these
two natural allies.

The solidarity of the Negro and Puerto Rican people must be built up and strength-
ened as a vital part of the struggle for peace and freedom.

Negro Slave Trade and Chattel Slavery

The brutal enslavement of the Negro peoples constitutes the deepest shame in the whole
history of the Americas. . . .

It is not generally realized what a great economic factor slavery was in the develop"-
ment of early capitalism. Tannenbaum points out that thus "Hundreds of ships, thou-
sands of sailors, and hundreds, perhaps thousands, of individuals, partnerships, and
companies engaged in bringing to the New World south of the United States more Afri-
cans than Europeans for the entire colonial period." . . .

It is a sign of the political corruption of our times that there are sme writers,

including professed liberals, who try to gloss over the horrors of slavery, even as
they do the other outrages committed by the invaders who so ruthlessly seized this
hemisphere. In the United States we have had such conciliators of slavery as the
Beards and Gunnar Myrdal who develop false theories to the effect that the slave-
owners, because they had a great deal of money invested in the slaves, therefore took
good care of them. Freyre also expresses such ideas in Brazil. Such people also in-
sist that the Negroes unresistingly submitted to slavery. The facts, however, con-
tradict these outrageous conclusions. In the very nature of things, to maintain a
system of slavery it was necessary to keep the slaves in deep ignorance and to exer-
cise a harsh tyranny over them. By the same token, slavery was bound to, and always
did in the Americas, result in revolts on the part of the enslavedhuman beings. From
whatever angle slavery is lookedat, it was as barbaric as it was u:neconomical. Sla-
very was particularly ruthless on those plantations and in those areas producing for

Fierce Slave Revolts

The Negroes, despite the very limited means at their disposal under the prevalent
iron discipline and terrorism, bitterly resisted slavery. They "slowed up" while

at work, they ran away, they burned plantations, they murdered overseers and plant-
ers, they refused to bear children, they organized armed insurrections. Contrary

to the slanders of the Beards, the Myrdals, and the innumerable other "white supre-
macists" who are trying to picture them as timid, pliant, and unresistingto enslave-
ment, the Negro peoples, in their heroic fight for freedom, made a record of which
they can well be proud. . . .

The Negro People in the §ivi_I Ear

The Negro people rose to the occasion of the Civil Mar, despite slander to the con-
trary. I.incoln's Emancipation Proclamation especially turned them into a powerful
rebellious force behind the Confederate lines. . . .

A basic slander against the Negro people is that their freedan was handed them -- '
but the facts show’ that they fought, resolutely for it. . . . I

Contributions Made by the Negro People

. } .thie Negroes, despite all this disintegrating pressure upon them, managed. to
retain much of their African. cultural heritage, especially in Brazil and the west
Indies. Even in the United States, where the thralldan of slavery pressed heavier .
than anywhere else upon the Negroes, there are many subtle African influences still
existing among the Negro people, as Herskovits has so amply demonstrated in his
book, The ﬁfth of the Negro Past. In the historically short period of time since

-18-

the abolition of slavery throughout the western hemisphere the Negroes have made

spectacular cultural progress, to the growingdismay of "white supremacists." In
every field of science, art, literature, drama, sport, they are leaders and_have
made outstanding contributions. Negroes have deeply affected music throughout the
western hemisphere. In the United States the cultural achievements of the Negro
people are well expressed through many great singers, actors, scientists, athletes,
and political leaders. A striking symbol of Negro progress in the United States is
Paul Robeson. Brazil and the West Indies are also especially rich in numerous out-
standing Negro poets, .novelists, musicians, economists, historians, and scientists,
in thinkers" and workers in every line of cultural endeavor. And behind them all is

the subtle influence of the old-time African haneland." . . .

Racism and White Chauvinism

Race prejudice, white chauvinism, is an indispensable part of the ideolog of human
exploitation. It is major method of securing superprofits in colonial and semi-
colonial countries. The white planter who exploits Negro and Indian slaves and
peons, in order to justify and intensify this exploitation, inevitably builds up

a whole system of propaganda to the effect that the "colored" peoples are inferior
mentally and physically to the whites and that, therefore, by God's will, they must
forever remain the obedient servants of the white man. The capitalist imperialists
have found it highly profitable to apply this reactionary system of cultivated chau-
vinism as a fundmnental policy in building their great modern colonial empires, and
also in the super-exploitation of the darker peoples who happen to be located in in-
dustrial countries. This white chauvinism, the ultra-conceited contention that the
whites are fundamentally superior to all other human beings, is one of the greatest
of all ideological obstacles to mankind's progress. Its highest, or lowest, ex-
pression is to be found in the race theories and practices of fascism. . . .

White chauvinism in this country harks back to the period of Negro chattel slavery.
The capitalists of our times continue vigorously to cultivate white chauvinism, of
which the Negroes are the principal target. It serves to isolate the Negroes and
to force them dam to lower wage and income levels, and it has ; also tended to split
and weaken the working class ‘by driving a wedge between white a'nd"Negro workers.
With the help of reactionary trade union leaders, this sinister chauvinism pene-
trates deeply into the ranks of the white workers. Even the Communist Party has to
fight to keep its membership free of this insidious poison.

White chauvinism -- race hatred -- has been , and still. is, a question of hard cash
to the big capitalists and landowners of the United States. Victor Perlo estimates
that the exploiters in the United States, by forcing six million Negroes in the labor
force down to far lower wage levels than white workers, reap at least ‘three billion
dollars yearly in superprofits. . . .

oThe fascists characteristically seek to bolster their claims to social rule by al-

leging a racial superiority over other sections of the population. They argue that

’ the "aryans" are a pure "race," that they are superior mentally and otherwise to

 

other "races," that Indians and Negroes are sub-human (and Jews also), that MuJ.at-
toes and Mestizos are degenerate mongrels, that workers are biologically inferior
to capitalists, and the like. And they try to Justify these absurd positions by
weaving a vast tissue of fake-scientific biological arguments.

Boas, Ortiz, and others noted above, however, have torn these flimsy arguments to
shreds, in profound and canprehensive scientific studies, dealing with every men-
tal and physical, historical and social aspect of the human being. They have shown,
as Boas puts it, that the argument of "The existence of any pure race with special

(continued from P389 10) ON mm NEGRO NATION IN THE sours
stage -- the Ménay stage -- in our government's drive toward new wars for
world conquest, and the effect this can have on the fight for peace.

The disastrous effect of the reactionary war+makers' anti-people's regime
will be most brutally felt by the Southern.masses, Negro and white, in the
social and political life of the South.

Now, all the worse reactionary features of the traditionally repressive
poll-tax-Dixiecrat-bourbon-banker local ruling oligarchies in the Southern
states will be intensified in the name of national security and Jingoist
patriotism. In the South, the Bill of Rights has long since been an alien
doctrine. The barbaric chauvinist doctrines of white supremacy lie at the
heart of the whole bourbon legislative, judicial and cultural super-struc-
ture. The oppression and degradation of the Negro people is a punitively
enforced function of all government and law; now, the inflaming of war hy-

_ steria and the promulgation of state-of-war decrees will make the political

and social atmosphere unbearable for the Negro people in particular, and
the Southern masses in general.

It seems to me that our Party nationally must see that in our trade union
work and in our Negro work we cannot win the battle against opportunism,
white chauvinism and reformism so long as work in these fields is charac-
terized by a neglect and underestimation of the South.

The development of higher levels of the Negro national revolutionary strug-
gle in the Black Belt, and the broad mass movement for democratic rights

in the South as a whole, is an indispensable prerequisite for insuring the
victory of the working class and the American people over the menacing chal-
lenge of the ruling class forces of fascism and.war presently, and for work-
ing class victory over capitalism u timately. This is a basic fundamental
in the strategy for working class victory, and a special feature of the path
to the triumph of Socialism in our country.

The observance of Negro History Week this year takes on a special meanixg,
with special advantages to all active fighters for peace. Again, as it has
from its inception, this event focusses attention on the Negro people's con-
tributions to the struggle for democracy in the United States, on the great
examples of heroism and militancy set by such Negro heroes as Peter Salem,
Gabriel, Vesey, Turner, Tubman, Douglass, Banneker, Robeson. It deepens the
understanding and appreciation of Negro cultural contributions, such as the
songs, dances, and craftsmanship of the slaves, and the works of Chestnut,
DuBois, Locke, *.«’-.roodru.'t‘f, White, Lawrence, Beardon, Ledbetter, Margaret Walker,
Shirley Graham, Janet Collins, and others. But this year of 1951, Negro His-
tory Week observances will show the indivisibility of peace and freedom at
this period in our history, and how the struggle for peace cannot be further-
ed except by the struggle for the freedcxn of the Negro people, nor the strug-
gle for Negro liberation be advanced except through a simultaneous struggle
for peace.

To help toward an understanding of this special character of Negro History
Week observances this year, The Worker and the Daily Worker -- which are or-
gans of the Negro Liberation Movement as well as of the working class of the
United States -- will publish special articles and features.

The Daily Worker will carry articles throughout the week, February ll-18, in-
cluding actual documents relating to the life, conditions and struggles of_
the Negro people throughout their history. The Worker issue of February 11
will be a special edition to help launch Negro History {ieek observances.

Lift every voice and sing,

Till earth and heaven ring,

Ring with the harmonies of Liberty;

Let our rejoicing rise

High as the listening skies,

Let it resound loud as the rolling sea.
Sing a song full of the hope that the

dark past has taught us;
Sing a song full of the hope that the
present has brought us;

Facing the rising sun of our new day begun,
Let us march on till victory is won.

Bitter the chast'ning rod, '

Felt in the days when hope unborn had died;
Yet with a steady beat,

Have not our weary feet,

Come to the place for which our fathers sighed?
We have come over a way that with tears

has been watered
We have come treading our path through
the blood of the slaughtered,

Out from the gloomy past,

the fight for Jobs in industry, against discrimination, Jim-crow
and police terror, such as the Lt. Gilbert case, Stuyvesant Town,
the John Derrick murder, the passage of FEPC, anti—lynch and
anti—poll tax legislation.

PAN r ACTION

1. Organize Negro History Week celebrations in your own club,

trade union and community organizations. This means not Left

organizations alone but also in right wing and conservative orb
ganizations. Where possible, get united front celebrations.

     

Negro History Week celebrations can be organized in the ILGWU,
IWO, ACW, ALP, NAACP, Harlem Trade Union Council, UPA, local
PTA's and countless other groups.

Progressive organizations should issue appeals to all organiza»
tions in their field to celebrate Negro History Week on united
front or parallel action basis. All organizations should write
the City Council demanding the observance of Negro History Week.
Upstate organizations should take similar action.

3- support should be given and similar actions should be organized, such

a) Testimonial banquet‘ to Dr. W.E.B. DuBois, Feb. 2:5.

5)-Furriers Union exhibit and mass meetings on Negro History Week.

c) ALP county rallies on Negro History Week.

d) The trade union demonstration against Jim—crow in Stuyvesant Town.

4. Special efforts should be made to secure speakers from the South at
meetings, and concrete aid for the South worked out.

5. Special attention should be given to the colonial question, particular-
ly Africa. The leading organizations in this field, like the Council on
African Affairs, should be invited to participate.

6. Mass and Party distribution of Ben Davis‘ report to the National Con-
vention, which is available in pamphlet form, should be worked out. This
pamphlet contains the main features of the Party's position on the struggle
for Negro rights today.

7. Each Party organization and Club should have discussions on the Conven-
tion decisions on the Negro question and.a concrete program of action
worked out based on Davis‘ Report and Johnson's report to the State Conven-

tion. A guide for this discussion is found in the outline for classes pre—*

pared by the_National Iﬂucation Department.

8. Every leading functionary should participate in the Negro History Week
meeting of our Party organization on Feb. 10, which will also be a tribute
to Henry Winston, Ben Davis, Claudia Jones and Pettis Perry.

9. Major steps must be guaranteed for the mass circulation of ‘the Negro
History Week editions of the Daily and Sunday Worker as a milestone in the

_press drive.

(Excerpts from His Report to the 15th National Convention)

The merging of the Negro people's struggle for freedom with the fight for peace
brings into the peace movement a decisive anti-imperialist force that can elevate
to new heights of militancy the peace movement as a whole. This fact also opens
up new possibilities for extending the unity of the working class, and other ele-
ments in the peace movement, with-the Negro people.

We are entering a new period in the Negro.people’s liberation.movement, a period
in.which the perspective is for sharpened anti-imperialist struggles which.will
enhance the fighting unity and national consciousness of the Negro people. Three
revolutionary currents merge in the liberation struggles of the oppressed Negro
nation: 1) the struggle for national liberation; 2) the grarian revolution,
still unfulfilled in the Deep South; 3) the class struggle of the proletariat,
with the Negro workers exercising a leading role in the unification of the na-
tional liberation:movement and the struggles of the working class.

‘Wall Street and its agents are keenly aware of this new anti-imperialist upsurge
and are attacking it along three main lines. They have intensified the exploita-
tion of the Negro masses and increased their-methods ofviolence and terror to in-
timidate the rising liberation struggles of the Negro people. The growing imper-
ialist terrorization of the masses of the Negro people, not only in the South but
throughout the country, is characterized by distinct fascist features.

The second line of Wall Street attack is to try to split the Negro liberation.mowe-
ment, to hamper its growth and consolidation by a policy of bribing and corrupt-
ing individuals, small groups among the Negro bourgeoisie and petty-bourgeoisie.

An important element in this second line of attack is the brazen demagogy and

intense political maneuvering by the Truman Administration and the Republican
leaders on_problems affecting the Negro people, especially on the major issues

-5-

J 

of equal civil rights, abolition of Jim-crow, etc. This is explained, first, by
the growing importance of the Negro people in the political life of the United
States; and, secondly, by ‘.-‘fall Street's anxiety to cover up the Jim-crow hell of
the Negro, people, in order to mislead world public opinion. This Wall Street de-
magogy and maneuvering is clearly a feature of the preparations for the new world
war. It is calculated to neutralize world public opinion in general, and most
particularly, to mislead the colonial peoples whom Wall Street is attempting to
conquer.

The third line of Wall Street attack is to prevent by all means the growth of

Negro-white unity, which is already playing a significant part in the progres-
sive life of the American people, and is so decisive in achieving the unity of y
the American working class. 1-

Fight For Neggro Equality

Consequently, the most active support for the national liberation movement, for
the struggle for Negro equality, has become one of the most important and deci-
sive tasks of the entire working class and of all progressive forces. It is im-
possible to wage an effective and consistent fight for peace, democracy, equal
rights and econcmic security without at the same time. giving the most active sup-
port to the national liberation movement of the Negro people.

To fulfill this task, the labor movement and all progressive forces must wage a .
constant struggle for the rights of the Negro workers to equal Jobs and pay, for
the equal rights of the Negro people in all fields, against all forms of segrega-
tion and Jim-crow, for criminal prosecution of all police brutality against Negroes,
for the death penalty to lynchers, for the exposure and destruction of the whole
system of anti-Negro frame-ups, for active support of the demands of the national
liberation struggles of the Negro people in the South. It is of decisive import-
ance to expose and systematically ccmbat all forms of white chauvinism, to advo-
cate working-class solidarity and the principles of working-class internationalism.

During the last two-and-a-half years our Party has made great strides forward in
its understanding of the Negro question and the struggle against white chauvinism.
But there are plenty of indications that as soon as we let up on this struggle, the
influence of this enemy ideology begins to seep in. We must now raise the struggle
against white chauvinism to a new level. We must now learn how to fight the influ-
ence of white chauvinism not only when it makes its appearance in open flagrant
forms, but when it is hidden and subtle. ‘

We must now raise the struggle for equal rights to a new level. We cannot be sati-
sfied with general talk about freedom. We must concretely organize the struggle
against discrimination where it is practiced. In the first place, in the struggle
for Jobs and for upgrading, for an end to the Negro ghetto, and against the hun-
dreds of ways in which this Jim-crow policy is applied by the American ruling class.

N In the last period the Social-Democrats and reformist leaders have been insisting

that the fight for equality is "practically won." let me give you a set of fi-
gures on the question of Jobs that blows this idea sky high. In Michigan, the
State Canpensation Commission reports that in the eight largest cities in 1915,
55 per cent of the employers specified "whites only" when hiring. In April 19’-I-7,
this Jumped to 1+1-L.5 per cent of the employers. In 19’-L9 it jumped to 19.8 per
cent, and in 1950, 80 per cent of the employers specified "whites only." And
this is supposed to be illegal according to the state laws of Michigan. That,
in the most graphic fashion, illustrates the new problems that are developing

 

under the war economy. The developing war econcnw is going to intensify all
forms of discrimination and segregation against the Negro people. This is a
challenge not only to the Negro people, but to the working class, to our Party
and to this Convention‘.

We cannot speak of the new features of the Negro people ‘s movanent w-ithout recog-
nizing that this very fact places tremendous responsibility on our Party in terms
of theoretical and practical work. It is necessary for us to sharpen our theore-
tical understanding of the national question in a number of respects. There must
be geater clarity on the fact that the heart of the liberation struggle of the
Negro people is in the South, with the decisive centers of the proletariat with-
in and outside of the oppressed nation playing a major role in aiding the work-
ing class to assume greater hegemony of the liberation movement. The sharpening
class and anti-imperialist struggle has reached the point where sections of the
Negro ‘bourgeoisie have moved into the imperialist camp, and this poses new ques-
tions for the Negro liberation struggle.

The Negro people's struggle outside of the oppressed nation, and the liberation
movement within it, merge in a common struggle against the oppression of the
Negro people. It‘ is the bounden duty of the whole working class to aid and give
leadership to this rising anti-imperialist national movement.

The struggle of our Party against white chauvinism Ins materially aided the
struggle for the unity of the working class -- of Negro and white workers. A
struggle against the poison of white chauvinism is a necessary canponent ofa
class-conscious proletariat. Howemer, it must be understood tmt this struggle
will continue as long as imperialism exists and hourly seeks to corrode and
split the working class and separate it from its allies.

The New Features of the Negro ,LII:eroH'oIi

Movement ,

    

(Excerpts from Ben Davis‘ report to the '
15th National Conventi on)

Can it be said, as was forcefully argued by certain comrades in the gre-convention
discussion bulletin, that the chief new feature of the Negro liberation movement is the
shift of large and influential sections of the Negro bourgeoisie to the war camp of U.S.
imperialism? Yes, comrades, it can be said. But it is not true. Such a view will
seriously disorient the struggle for Negro liberation and for peace.

The shift of influential sections of the Negro bourgeoisieto the role of outright agents
of Wall-Street imperialism, and even as open anti-Communist, anti-Soviet trumpets of
war,~is one of the features of the new period. But it is not the most important ele-
ment. However, it is an element that should not be under-estimated, any more than over-
estimated.

This is a narrow view, and objectively tends to deny the national character of the
Negro liberation movement, a character that is growing constantly sharper. Any policy
which objectively_tends in this direction, obviously aids reactionary Negro bourgeois
reformists, like Lester Granger, who deny the national character of the Negro movement
and constantly chatter that the struggle against segregation is over, and all one has
to do is to pick up the pieces. Granger thinks that th poverty, police violence and
segregation, suffered by the Negro masses, no longer exist because the war-mad capita-
lists, like the late James Forrestal, gave him.a crumb or two from their Jimpcrow table.

The most important new features of the Negro liberation movement are: First, the in-

. ternational significance of this.question, originally noted by Comrade Foster at the

March plenum this year, and reflected in the present crisis in U.S. foreign policy.
Second, the intensification of the pro-fascist oppression of the Negro people nationally,
and in the Black Belt in particular, in consequence of U.S, monopoly's drive toward
world domination, war and fascism. Third, the increased militancy of the Negro people
and their white supporters, particularly in the deep South among the workers and share-
croppers, where they are defending their lives, frequently with arms in hand-as is their
constitutional right, and where the Negro workers symbolized especially in the Negro rail-
road workers, are assuming a more leading role in the struggle for national liberation.
Since the new turn of events in Korea, the militancy and consciousness of the Negro wor-
kers have become even sharper than they were at the time of the Chicago Negro Trade Union
Conference.

The principal questions flowing out of the developments in the Negro people's movement
over the past period fall into three main categories.

First, perspective. The unique contribution of Communists in this movement is to imbue
it wdth a revolutionary perspective, as against a reformist perspective. A new emphasis
on this feature should dominate our work in the existing Negro people's organizations,
unions and communities. One of the cardinal reasons for the sporadic and uneven practi-
cal work in the struggle for Negro rights on a national scale is the lack of a unified
perspective and an organized mass base among the Negro people fighting for a revolution-
ary Negro peoplersnmvement, with the working class as its leader. A

Wall Street's Negro reformist agents have converted the N.A.A.C.P., the National Council
of Negro Women and, even th Brooklyn Dodgers, into a base for their warmongering sub-
servience to imperialism and their undermining of the Negro people's vnity and militancy.

Such a revolutionary perspective is not a rejection of reforms or of working with
refonmists per se, but on the contrary, the surest guarantee that partial and big
reforms will be achieved to relieve the groingzmisery and.war-inspired persecution
of‘the Negro people.

Second, at all times, the Left and progressive forces among the Negro people should
champion the unity of the Negro people -- including their all—class unity -- around
a minimum program on partial issues. This is the essence of the united front from
below. It is the treacherous Negro bourgeois reformists and Social-Democrats who
split the Negro people, but the Negro people can never be united in support of Wall
Street's aggressive program to subjugate the Negro or any other oppressed people.
It is especially vital and urgent to fight for the * ity of the Negro people, and
for their alliance with white labor, progressive and peace forces.

Third, to assure Negro working-class leadership of the Negro liberationzmovement.

By far the most important new factor essential to achieve the central objectives of
the Negro liberation.mevement -- to transform this movement into a national upsurge -
is to establish the leadership of the Negro Workers. In the Black Belt this must be
buttressed by the alliance between the Negro workers and the sharecroppers, the peons
and poor farmers.

The central weakness of our work in the historic N.A.A.C.P.‘ Washington Mobilization
was the failure to introduce into this fight a revolutionary content, namely, the
O0nSCi0uSn9SS that this Vast people's movement is part of the fight for peace and
against American imperialism. The main example of this weakness in revolutionary con-
tent is the failure to realize that the heart of the Negro liberation movement is the

question of freeing the Negro nation in the Black Belt, the base of the whole national
system of oppression.

(Excerpts fron Report of Howard Johnson to N.Y. State Convention)

What are some of the major political and organization tasks of our Party in the
coming period? First, to intensify the struggle against white chauvinism poli-
tically, organizationally and theoretically, particularly in the trade unions and
among the basic industrial workers. We must raise the level of this struggle in
a manner unprecedented in the history of the Party. This is necessary because the
unprecedented character of the chauvinist propaganda flowing out of the war poli-
cies of American imperialism has elevated the responsibility of the Party to new
levels. .

Secondly, this fight must be acccmpanied by the organization on a state-wide scale
and in every Party organization of a concrete program of struggle for Negro rights,
around the central issues of jobs in industry, and also around the major issues

of Jim-crow in housing, police brutality, anti-lynch legislation, hospitals, schools,
racism in the movies, radio, theater.

On the Job struggle, while our Party has developed struggles for jobs in many light
industries, we have yet to tackle the basic industries of our state, such as steel,
auto, electrical, railroad.

Our State Committee proposes to this State Convention, as a part of unleasing such
a str-ufggle in basic industry, a major campaign against the vicious ,jim-crow prac-
tices in the railroad industry, fighting to win unity between white and Negro work-
ers for Negro firemen, engineers, and all of the other operating crafts in the rail-
road industry.

Will not such a campaign, coupled with the fight for the economic demands of the
white railroad woikers, tremendously advance the policy of industrial concentra-
tiln and the fight for Negro rights? Would not such a campaign win the widest
support among the mass of Negro railroad workers who are confined to the dirti-
est, lowest-paid jobs in that industry?

Similarly, such struggles must be unfolded in other basic industries of our state.

Another major sector oi‘ the fight for jobs must be the organization of the domes-
tic worlzers, coupled with a struggle for the admission of Negro wcxnen into indus-
try. Nego women, more than two-thirds of those working, are domestic workers in
the first place, because of the vicious discriminatory practices against Negro
women in industry. The campaign to organize the domestic workers will not arouse
enthusiasm among Negro women unless it is coupled with efforts to open up oppor-
tunities for Negro women to get out of domestic work.

Job Trainim

Another aspect of the fight" for jobs is the fight for training Over 50,000 are
being trained by our State Government with the C00P91“a’Gi0n of the American Fed.-
eration of labor in apprentice training programs, but only a handful are Negro,
and less are Puerto Rican. A struggle must be opened up on the widest united
front basis for apprentice trainingfor the Negro‘ or Puerto Rican youth in this
program. ‘
