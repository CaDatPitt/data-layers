Bombs, bearing the mark of Wihnington, Delaware—home of
the du Pont munitions works-are falling upon Chinese cities.
It is these bombs -that killed the American boys, on the U .S .5 .

_ Parlay.

Steel, shipped from the mills of United States Steel, is being

' forged into Japanese battleships which threaten the peace of

the entire Paciﬁc. .
Hitler and Mussolini, the invaders of democratic Spain, are
supplied with American-made bombs which pour a frightful rain

. of death and terror upon the Spanish people and upon our own

American boys of the Lincoln Battalion, ﬁghting our fight for
democracy.

Meanwhile, the invasion of little Austria gets the backing of A

our economic royalists. William Randolph Hearst, for example,
applauds the rape of Austria as having a “proper purpose,”
while he gives Hitler some friendly advice to be a little more
“tolerant” so that the antagonism in this country to the Nazi
policies "would. be abated.”

When our economic royalists supply the fascist war-makers
with arms, it isnot for proﬁt alone. For while they ship supplies
to Hitler and Mussolini to be forwarded to General Franco, they

' give full support to keeping up the disgraceful embargo which] i

prevents the United States from assisting its sister republic———
Loyalist Spain. They are willing to sacriﬁce the proﬁt that would
come from helping arm the forces of democracy against the
bloody forces of world fascism; _
The economic royalists give the fascists more than direct

"material aid. They are the organizers of the campaign against

the one policy that would stop the fascists in their tracks and
preserve world peace: the policy of collective peace action-joint

‘ economic measures——by the United States along with other

democracies including the" Soviet .Union against the war-
makers. This is the policy laid down by President Roosevelt in
i 10 i

I;

0‘ his, speech at Chicago when he urged a “quarantine” by the

democracies against the fascist aggressors.

The economic royalists have mobilized their press, their radio‘

networks, their reactionary stooges in Congress, to block this

a policy of collective security. They have whipped up a new high-
powered Red-scare and an anti-Soviet campaign of lies. They a

label the policy of collective security a “Communist plot” and
try ,_to hide from the people the fact that this policy has the
public endorsement of the President of the United States.

Two Great Nations Say It

One week after the invasion of Austria, with the world closer.
to war than ever before, Secretary of State Cordell Hull and
Maxim Litvinov, People’s Commissar of Foreign Aﬁairs of the
Soviet Union, speaking on the very same day more than 6,000

miles apart, expressed similar ideas about the need for ‘joint

action "to check the fascists at once.
To knife the peace policy advocated by President Roosevelt,

Secretary of State Hull and the Soviet Union, the economic?

royalists turn the columns of their press over to every foe-of
collective security. Isolationists, paciﬁsts, advocates of so-called
"neutrality,” whether crafty foes of peace or misguided friends
of peace-—they can all make the front page byattacking collective

"security and by urging America "to tend to her own business”-—

 

while the fascists would drag the whole world. including us,
into war.

If they unite, the peace forces of the world are invincible. V

The 180,000,000 people of the land of socialism are pledged
to the cause of world peace. The workers and all democratic

forces of other lands must also stand ready to prevent the fas- ‘

cists from launching an attack on the Soviet Union and upset-
ting the peace of the world.
The economic royalists try to conceal from the people the

11

O
\

great servicethat the Soviet Union performed for all humanity
when it uncovered the ring’ of Trotskyites, agents of interna-
tional fascism, who were working hand in hand with Hitler
and the Japanese generals. The economic royalists try to hide
the true meaning of the Moscow trials in order to slander the
Soviet Union and to givera free hand to the Trotskyites in this
country as they attack Roosevelt’s peace policy.

When the Department of Justice uncovered Nazi spies in
this country recently, the capitalist press tried to laugh it off
as just a “spy scare.” For the economic royalists of America
are themselves friends and partners of fascism abroad. That is

“why they are so eager to rescue the agents of fascism when they

are discovered—whether in the Soviet Union or in the U.S.A.

When we march on May Day, we will march for an embargo
upon Hitler and Mussolini, thefascist invaders of Spain. We
will march for the .O’Connell amendments to the Neutrality‘
Act so that the United States can sell arms to Spain, a friendly
republic in dire distress. We will march in support of the peace
policy of the Soviet Union. We will marchfor world coopera-
tion to establish peace. We will march to save humanity.

Unity Is the Answer ’

This May Day sees Americ-an labor more powerful than ever,
‘before in its entire history, with eight millions organized into

the unions. Of these, three millions have joined the unions in
the last year alone——either through the organizing drives

of the C.I.O., or through the example set by the C.I.O. and '

which ‘brought new workers into the A. F. of L.

When in all American labor history hadxthe steel workers
won a signed contract with the most powerful of its trustiﬁed
enemies———U. S. Steel? The C.I.O. has done just that.

When before did we ever seesuch a surge of organization
spreading like wildfire through the basic industries of the coun-

12 A

try, among auto, rubber, marine and transport workers, into
the oﬂiceswhere the white-collar workers slave, among the agri-
cultural workers? When before did we see such fraternalism
between industrial workers and small farmers? When did we
see a labor movement so politically alert—forging its own inde-
pendent political weapons like Labor’s Non-Partisan League?
When ‘before did we see powerful international unions battling
against the ravages of unemployment during a time of crisis?

We have seen all this with the coming of the C.I.O., and with
its sweeping successes under the leadership of John L. Lewis.

The American workers are united in the demands which they
make of the open-shop economic royalists- But their ranks are
split. And this division is a tremendous obstacle in the path‘ of
their common goal.

It is the diehard Executive Council of the A. F.‘ of L. which

plunged the knife into la'bor’s ranks. In the past the Executive»

Council, with its craft union policies, had been unable and un-
willing to organize the mass production industries where the
bulk of American labor toils. With no membership at all in
these industries, they refused to sit by while a new progressive
group inside of the A. F._ of L. started to do the job. They
greeted the formation of the C.I.O. with expulsions. When they
were ﬁnally brought to the conference table through the initiative
of the C_.I.O. and through the desires of the A. F. of L. mem-
bers for unity, the Executive Council broke off negotiations by
rejecting the simple unity proposal o-f the C.I.O.: to take the
entire C.I.O. membership—4,000,000 strong——back into the
A. F. of L. at once and to iron out all jurisdictional questions
afterwards. A

T/.2eiSplz't Hurts Us All K

The split has been of the greatest harm to all workers, whether
of the C.I.O., the A. F. of. L. or those still unorganized. It has
13

helped the Wall Street oligarchy block the -great goal of labor——
100’ per cent unionization in every industry ‘and every town a
union town. The split has helped the trusts check the ﬁght for
further improvement in wages and working conditions. It has

resulted in the failure of Congress to pass the wages-hours bill-——‘
with the Executive Council actually throwing its weight against-

the measure when it reached the ﬂoor.
Where the split has been carried over into the political ﬁeld,

it has helped the reactionaries defeat the labor and progressive
forces at the polls. In New York City, despite the division in I
labor’s ranks, labor stood united at the last election around a e

single slate of progressive and labor candidates. Result: defeat
for the Tammany reacti-onaries and a splendid triumph for the
forces of democracy. On the other hand, in the recent elections

in Detroit and Seattle, for example, we saw the full fruits of the a

split. In each of these cities, the strength of labor was divided
between different candidates. Result: defeat for the forces of
progress and victory for the open-shop reactionaries. '
"They are working day and night in every community of the
country to defeat the progressives in the coming primaries and
in the November elections and send _a majority of their stooges
into the next Congress. If they can be victorious this year over
the divided body of labor, the pro-fascists of the countryﬁgure

that they will be able to install a regime of their own in the 

White House in 1940.

United ranks of labor and the cooperation of all democratic
forces——workers, farmers, small business imen—are an absolute
necessity if we would prevent the country from falling into the
bloody claws of the open-shoppers and monopolists in the coming
elections. -

In our united parades on May Day, labor will march side by

side. Our united demonstrations will serve to weld the ranks

of labor again and speed America on the road to progress.

It Is YOUR Party

May Day, 1938, will see the Communist Party of the United v
States with 7‘5,000 members—-str-onger than ever. TheiCommu-C’
nist Party has always been in the forefront of the struggle for y
“ democracy, jobs, security and peace. For years, the Communist

Party worked tirelessly for a policy of industrial unionism in
the mass production industries. It was the Communist Party
that .ﬁrst raised the demand for unemployment insurance. It was

' the Communists who first fought for equal rights for the Negro

peo-ple.

Today the Communist Party is a real factor in the life of the,‘

country, devoting all its energy to the task of unifying the labor
movement, building -a sound peace movement and forging a
People’s Front of all those who have the preservation of democ-

 racy “at heart. ‘Meanwhile the Communist Party seeks to "educate

  
 

the majority of the people to the need for socialism in this
country, when the factories and other means of production and
distribution will betin the hands of the people for the beneﬁt

of the people, instead of in the hands of a few for the sole’

beneﬁt of the few as they are_today.

' On this May Day let us build a more powerful Communist
Party as the best guarantee of cementing the democratic front
here and now and of ultimately leading America to socialism.

=3: '=:< *
Men and women of America! The foe is strong, but "if all

who love democracy are united in its defense, our victory is cer-V
tain. Let us stand shoulder to shoulder on this May Day and

raise a mighty voice: For democracy! For jobs.’ For security!’

For peace!

PRINTH) IN THE U.S.A.

mu nAv—I93s  

MAY DAY this year will be an answer to the economic

royalists who want to ride on the backs of the American‘

people, and to their fascist allies abroad who seek to set
the world aﬂame.

All that we, the American people-—and our fathers before us—-— ‘

have fought for and won over the course of years is now threat-
ened by a small handful of hard-faced reactionaries of fabulous

' wealth. All that we want most is endangered because these

economic royalists are using their vast power to thwart the will

~ of 120,000,000 people. .

-The desires of the common people of America are simple ones.
All of us-—workers, farmers, white-collar and professional peo-
ple, small business men and others of the middle class~—~we all
want the same things. I ‘

We want democracy. We want jobs. We want security. We
want peace.

This is not asking much. Yet this May Day of 1938 ﬁnds. 0

American democracy facing the greatest threat it has ever known
as the monopolists work day and night to Hitlerize the country.
This May Day ﬁnds 15,000,000 of us without jobs, while relief
standards are being cut. This May_Day ﬁnds our hope for
security for our families endangered by the new economic crisis.
And this May Day ﬁnds the tories of this country giving aid
and comfort to the fascist war-makers abroad, Hitler, Mussolini
and the Mikado, as they seek to engulf the entire world——'and

America with it—in the bloody whirlpool of a new war. _

America Started It

Fifty-two years ago, America made a great contribution to the
international working class movement and to the struggle ‘of all
common people for a better and happier life. May Day was
born ﬁfty-two years ago in this country, created by the American
workers as a weapon in their ‘fight for the eight-hour day. A
May Day of demonstrations. A day to rally the united will of
the people. A .day to show our combined strength and to make
known our common wants.

The eight-hour day has been won. But today we have new
goals and face fresh battles. We gladly accept the heritage of
May Day that has been handed down to us through the years.
Our May Day parades of this year will be demonstrations for

the needs of 1938. We will march for democracy, jobs, secur- I .

ity and peace. _

With the breath-taking growth of the C.I.O., with a stronger
labor movement than ever before, and with better cooperation
among all sections of the common people, we are in -a position
today where we can squarely meet the challenge of the economic
royalists and turn back the forces of reaction.

As we march, our brothers and sisters in other lands will be
marching too, celebrating the day that was given them by the
workers of America. In the Soviet Union, an entire nation——
180,000,000 strong (and strong is the word) —-will march as
they hail the successful building of a socialist society, and extend
their hand to the people of the rest of the world in a pledge
of cooperation in the great struggle for peace and democracy.

In Mexico, the people will -be parading. And up north in Can-
ada. And in France, Britain and Czechoslovakia. In Spain and
in China, our brothers and‘ sisters will be observing May Day in

' the trenches. Many of them will be giving their lives on this day

as they man the guns to protect democracy against the fascist

invaders. .
4 0

As we march, we will hold out a hand in warm, fraternal V

greeting to our brothers and sisters who bear untold torments as
they carry on the struggle for freedom in Germany,”Italy and
the other fascist countries. ‘

The common people of the whole world have the same needs
and the same dreams. They have the same enemies. That is why
all of them, white and Negro, Protestant, Catholic and Jew,
will march on May Day. And throughout the world they will
say: this day was given us by the workers of _America and now
it belongs to us all in our struggle for a better world, for world
peace.

Who Won the Elections?

An amazing thing has been happening in this country. In I

November, 1936, the people went to the polls and voted over-
whelmingly for a New Deal program of ' social legislation. In
46 out of the 48 states, they piled up huge majorities against the
open-shoppers, against the fascist-minded plutocrats and their
little man Landon. The vote spelled: up with progress—thumbs

down on reaction!

At every opportunity they have had since then, the people
have made their mandate clear. In the municipal elections last
fall in New York, the largest city in the country, the people
made it evident that, if anything, they were even more deter-
mined to win social legislation than they had been the year

before. This vote too meant: up with progress—thurnbs down on

reaction! .

A few months later, the people of the deep South let the coun-
try know that they too stood for progress. In a special election
for the United States Senate, Lister Hill, running as a New
Dealer, walked off with the election while the people dumped
Tom Heﬂin, the Ku-Kluxer and anti-New Dealer, into the ash-
can. Up with progress—thumbs down on reaction.

j\

I And yet—-— '

In the first regular sessiori of Congress ‘following the national

elections of November, 1936, month after month passed, and’

the session ﬁnally ended with nothing—absolutely nothing—
done for thepeople. i _ ‘ '
Then President Roosevelt called a special session—so that

Congress could enact the important social legislation that the

regular session had ignored-. And ‘again Congress did—nothing.
Now we are in the ﬁnal session before the next’ elections. When
we march on May Day, we will be saying to the group of rleac-.
tionaries who have been blocking the wheels in Congress: you
cannot adjourn this time without listening to the people.
What has happened to the court reform program which the
people wanted? Killed and buried by the economiceroyalists.
What happened to the wages-hours bill? ‘The measure would
mean shorter. hours and higher wages for the worker. More
money in the pockets of the worker would mean more business
for the merchant and a better market for the farmer. The bill

was one of the campaign pledges of the Democratic Party in ’36.‘ -
Yet what happened?‘ Shelved by monopoly capital through an 1

unholy alliance of Republican stand-patters and Democratic con-
servatives who went back on their campaign pledge.

What happened to the anti-lynching bill, supported, according
to the Gallup Poll of Public Opinion, by a majority of the
people in every section of the country, including 57 per cent in
the South? The bill would not only save Negroesifrom the rope
and the faggot. But a blow against the lynch-system of the
South would also be a blow in aid of the democratic and pro-
gressive forces in the South and therefore for progress through-

. out the nation. What happened to_ the bill? Filibustered off the

floor of the Senate by the same clique who fought court reform
and the wages-hours bill. ' i .

What happened to the housing bill? Watered down until it

6

/

was barely a shadow of the original measure. What happened
to adequate aid for the farmers? Adequate relief measures for
the uhemployed? And what happened to-the peace program laid
down by President Roosevelt in his Chicago speech in which he
urged an economic "quarantine” of the war-making nations as
the only way to save world peace? Blocked by the reactionaries.

Who won the elections of ’36-—the people of America or the
monopolist oligarchy?

Verdict: Guilty

The monopolists stand convicted today of dragging» this

~ co-untry into the throes of another crisis.

They have sabotaged the legislative program which would
have meant greater purchasing power all around and therefore
more buying and more production.

They have artiﬁcially held up monopoly prices——-such as on
bread and milk and the materials for building construction like
steel, cement and’ lumber. They have forced down the prices
paid to the farmer for his goods, while charging him exorbitant

prices for farm machinery. They have driven wages down in _

those industries where the unions have not been strong enough

to resist. They have deliberately withheld investments and closed: ’

down factories in order to weaken the unions through mass lay~

offs and create a panic throughout the country. They have’

frozen bank credits, thereby strangling the activities of mer-
chants and small business men.

Why have the monopolists aggravated the new crisis? Because
they think that an economic crisis will discredit the New Deal
Administration and make it possible to replace it with one more
to their taste. They ﬁgure that a crisis will enable them to get
Congress to lift the mild taxes now applied to their corporations.
They hope that mass unemployment will undermine the unions.

7

—-especially the huge C.I.O. organizations in the mass produc-
tion industriesﬂnd will enable them to drive down wages.
This May Day will find 15,000,000 unemployed. For this we
can thank the monopolists--and their deliberate “sit-down
strike.” Our May Day parades this year will rally the people to
prevent the crisis from becoming still more aggravated and to
keep the monopolists from loading the burden of the  upon
the backs of the masses as in the crisis of 1929-33. May Day
will unite the people to resist wage-cuts, to fight forilower prices,
and to force Congress to take emergency crisis measures against
the industrial sabotage and price-ﬁxing of the monopolists.

The Right to Work

Fifteen million unemployed! As many as, if not morethan, in the
darkest days of the last crisis.

During the steel strike of last spring, Tom Girdler and his

pals were howling about the “right to work.” Today there isn’t
a peep from them—at least on that subject.
S For with the economic royalists, the “right to work” was a
slogan for breaking strikes. It meant the "right” of the strike-
breaker to “wor ” while the majority of the workers in the
plant were trying to compel the employer to obey the Wagner
Labor Relations Act—-the law of the land.

Today there are less workers in the steel mills than during the
steel strike. The tipple of many a coal mine is deserted. The
auto factories are working at a fraction of capacity. But now the
slogan of the "right to work” has come to life again—this

. time with a meaning which makes the Girdlers feel sick all over.

Said John L. Lewis a few months ago:

“We hear much in some of the metropolitan newspapers and
from the lecturers on the public platform representing special inter-
ests in the country, of the ‘right to work.’ All right, give our people
the right to work. Let them work when they want to work, not

8 ,

merely when Walter Chrysler or Henry Ford want to use their

services.”

- ‘Not only are there 15,000,000 unemployed in the United
States today, but relief standards everywhere are being slashed
as the economic royalists crack the whip of “economy.”

This May Day, however, will see the American people better
able than ever before to wage the light for security, jobs and
adequate relief. For today, unlike the last crisis, we have the
C.I.O., which is_ going to bat against the misery and suffering
of unemployment. Many A. F. of L. unions are in the thick of
the fight, too. Labor’s Non-Partisan League has placed the
battle for security and jobs high on its legislative program.
Meanwhile, we have a powerful, respected Workeprs Alliance,
working closely with the unions, as it carries onthe struggle of

p the unemployed.

In our May Day parades this year, we will raise the cry: “A
job or adequate relief for every worker. Improve the Social
Security Law for the unemployed, the aged, and mothers, in
order to maintain an American standard of living. Improve the
National Youth Act to provide education and jobs for all
young people.”

May Day will be a day for security and jobs.

Partners of Hitler

The economic royalists of America are engaged not only in

‘economic warfare against the common people. Behind the scenes,

they are actively participating in open, military warfare in vari-

ous parts of the world. They are providing the arms and muni-

tions to the enemies of the American people, the enemies of
world democracy. -

Trucks and cars, made by Henry Ford and supplied on credit I

by Ford to the Japanese militarists, are today being used to
murder the people of China.
