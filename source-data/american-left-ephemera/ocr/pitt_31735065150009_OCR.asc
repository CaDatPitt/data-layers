The June 1 election marked
the third, and finally victori-

the company and the free-
spending efforts of the Mold-

Reports show that the Mold-

THE MINE-MILL UNION

- Vice-President e I

Freedom Ridersdand

The “Race Problem”

UCH is being said today about the “race problem”

in“the South (or in America), It is not that at all.

It’s a downright unequal system of justice. The conflict

that’s going“-on today is not white against Negro, but
justice against injustice.

Every person is entitled to equality under
the law. That is the meaning and intent of
our U. S. Constitution and its Bill of Rights.

The freedom riders‘ are simply carrying
forward in another form that struggle for
complete freedom, justice and dignity. World
attention is being -dramatically focussed on
America's system of justice to see if it
works, instead of its “race problem.”

In the days of the abolition and anti-
slavery ’\movement, the struggle_ likewise
took many forms. One of those forms was
- the underground railroad. In those days tens
"°w°'d of thousands of Negroes escaped from
chattel slavery in the South Via the underground railroad.

 

*‘k*

, ODAY, a hundred years later, despite-all kinds of obstacles,

A slanders, beatings, burning’ busses, jailing, etc., undaunted
and unafraid of suffering, or even death if need be, the freedom

riders—Negro and white, young and old alike, representing , 

churches, schools, unions _and varied other organizations——are
returning to the deep South, not by the underground railroad,
but by bus, rail and plane. From underground railway to over-
head airway, My Lord what a morning!

This is not just the Negroes’ fight’ to rid America of this
system of unequal justice. Every American must fight for equal
treatment to all in order to save America in the» eyes of the
nations of the world.

A young white freedom rider, Peter Ackerberg, 22 year‘

old student from New York, said’: “Why am I here? Well, I am
single and can afford to risk it. I feel that segregation hurts
the White person as well as the 1§Ieg_I:o,’,’ _ _ 2

 EW YORK’S Governor Rockefeller said: “I don’t see how
 We can blame these young people. In fact, I think we must
admire them.”

Sen. Philip A. Hart (D., Mich.) said: “If in 1961 an Ameri-
can citizen cannot get on a bus and travel in this country in
safety, we had better know about it and then take means neces-
sary to correct it.” -- ‘ I 1' ~ ~ -

Local 570 Settles
Humboldt Contract

A new one-year contract ex-
piring June 1, 1962, has been
signed between Local 570 and
Humboldt Brick &‘Tile Com-
pany at Humboldt, Kansas.
Local leaders said negotiations

‘were concluded " “with” ‘g o 0 (1
success, what with this brick‘

. and clay industry. being very
‘ slow and slack.’’_ ’

as an American city, not as some off-beat -place. We do business a

with the whole nation. What happens in Atlanta has national
repercussions. We cannot afford to run Atlanta other than as a
great American city. When the ‘freedom riders’ came through
Atlanta we hardly knew they were here. They probably tested
the facilities and found no discrimination. Nothing happened."

*‘A'.*

HEN this "nation recognizes the fatherhood of God and
the brotherhood of man, as Rev. Abernathy said at Mine-
Mill’s Convention in Tucson:

“They will stand up in the West, they’ll stand up in the
North, they’ll stand up in the South, they’ll stand brown, they’ll
stand yellow, they’ll stand black, they’ll stand white and look
toward the Flag, and say, not out of tradition butout of love,
not because they learned it somewhere in school, but because
they mean it: ‘I _,pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United
States of America and to this Nation for which it stands, under
God, a nation indivisible with liberty and with justice; not for

white and ndt for black, not for yellow, not for brown—but_

with liberty and justice for all.’ ”—ASBURY HOWARD

Chief Nature of the settle-
ment was the company’s tak-
ing over full payment of the
entire cost of sick and accident
Blue Cross insurance for all
employees, which means about
a 10-cent per hour wage in-
crease. The company previous-
ly paid nothing. An additional
gain was made in the negotia-
tion of two new job classifica-
tions, one of which included
a 10-cent an hour pay raise ad-
justment for four men.

Contract Strengthened at Grandview

  

METALINE FALLS, Wash.
—-Unanimous ratification of a
new 2-year agreement with
American Zinc, Lead & Smelt-
ing Company here was voted
June 16 by the membership of
Local 515, thus settling a con-
troversy in negotiations exist-
ing since April of 1959. Settle.
ment came close after the local
voted to refuse the company’s
last offer and request strike
sanction from the Interna-
tional Union.

The ‘contract will run until

June 30, 1963, with a wage re-
opener next year.

The agreement marks a vic-
tory» over -the company’s long
insistent challenge of practic-
ally every word in the contract

A protecting workers’ rights. ~ - “

 

 

As now agreed to, the con-

tract strengthens union secur-.

ity under a virtual union shop,
eliminates the problem of non-
members performing _ w o r k
under the union’s jurisdiction,
clearly outlines a grievance
procedure to prevent the past

practice of company stalling

on arbitrations, and continues
protection of the scheduled

the-board wage increase retro;
active to last January 1. ’

The company also agreed to

assume retroactively, increased
payments due on the Health
and Welfare plan which have
accumulated against the plan
since Nov., 1959, representing

‘a cost of 3.61 cents per hour.

work week an d work day‘

which th e company tried to

eliminate and thus avoid pay-

ment of overtime.
Several new classifications

were created, including raise
and drift miner, truck driver

and, for the first time, welder,
which will advance a substan-
tial number of men several la-

{bor grades. On top of these is

Also agreed to is a provision
guaranteeing maintenance of
the present plan without in-
creased cost to employees until
expiration of the agreement.

Added to these gains are
pension p la n improvements

(S

BAYARD, N. M.——A fatal accident taking the life of a long-time member of
Mine-Mill Local 890 last month triggered off a 24-hour protest walkout over unsafe
working conditions at the Kennecott smelt er and mill, in Hurley. The walkout ended
only after management agreed to dorrect the hazardous conditions which caused this
and threatened other accidents, Regional Director M. R. Barraza reported.

Saturnino Godoy, an em-
ployee with 22 years of
service at -Kennecott Chino
Mines Division here, was killed
on the morning of June 6
when £1 conveyer belt en-
tangled him as he was greas-
ing -the feeder conveyer trip-
per in the smelter} sGodoy, pre-
sumably killed instantly, was
caught between» the moving
conveyer belt and a pulley
which crushed his head.

it >l< k'<

THAT same night thorough
investigation of the fatal acci-
dent-causing machinery was
conducted by Local 890 offi-
cers Aand grievance committee-
men who found the most ﬂag-
rant violations of machinery
safety , maintenance.

They learned, for instance,
that the conveyer tripper
which killed Godoy was being
greased and oiled While it was
in operation. This was being
done despite the fact that the
union committee ‘on numer-
ous occasions had requested
the company's discontinuance’
of this unsafe practice of hav-
ing moving belts greased while

In Hurley

BAYARD, N. M.—Manage-
ment’s misapplication of a re-
duction in force contract clause
negotiated by Local 890 with
Kennecott Chino .Mines divi-
sion in 1959 resulted last

V month in $3,654.51 back pay

for 17 Mine-Mill members here.

The issue arose some time
ago when Kennecott, at its
Hurley reduction plant, put a
layoff into effect and, in so
doing, violated the reduction
of force provision in the union
agreement. '

The clause reads: “If a cur-
tailment entails lay-off, such
lay-off shall be made in the
reverse order of plant senior-
ity, except that employees in
class 6 or above may be ex-
empt from such reduction pro-
vided there are no other qual-
ified-employees who have more
plant seniority."

ID! is ii
~'KENNECOTT management
took the position that these
17 men they were laying off
were not qualified for the jobs

held by junior men who were

retained.

A grievance taken up imme-
diately by the committee re-
ceived no satisfactory -answer
in any of the steps including
the general ma.nager’s level, so
Local 890 appealed to arbitra-
tion. It was at. this point that
the. company decided not to -go

to arbitration, and paid the '17 '

men all their lost time for
being laid off out of_ seniority.

At the last negotiating ses-
sion held in New Mexico with
‘Kennecott on local issues, the

company told the -Local 890

bargaining ‘committee that
they wanted to change the
language in the reduction of
force clause because, they said,
when the clause was negoti-
ated in 1959 it was to be on .a
trial basis.

Job Security Poses 1
Key Labor Question

NE of the major problems facing all American work-
ing people today is the question of job security. This

A is particularly true of the people in our own industry.

The introduction of new equipment and new mining,

smelting and refining techniques has already eliminated

thousands of jobs and represent a continu-
ing threat to existing jobs. ‘

The employers in our industry are go-
ing to have to face up to the fact that job
security is going to become an increasingly
more important demand in all future collec-
tive bargaining. In our own industry these
demands will range from a livable supple-
mentary unemployment b e n e f i t to the
shorter work week.

We have a responsibility in collective
bargaining not only to our presently work-
  ing membership, but also to the thousands

mchter of our people who have already lost their
jobs as a result of the introduction of new machinery and the
use of new techniques, and who find themselves jobless with-
out prospect of work. V '

    

***

RECENT study completed by a joint committee of union,

management and public representatives in the meat pack-
ing industry paints a rather gloomy picture -of whathappened
to workers left jobless as a result of older and less efficient
plants. According to the Rocky Mountain News the committee
reported:

“In some cities as high as 56% had not found jobs a full

year after the plants were closed. Those who were working re-

ceived sharply lower pay. Plant closings were especially tough
on older workers, women, Negroes and those with little formal
training.

“Crash programs of retraining benefit only a small per cent
of the jobless. In Oklahoma City, only 60 out of 431 invited
workers completed retraining programs and many of these are
still out of work.” ’

at * * A

LANT closings, mine shutdowns and permanent layoffs in
our industry have the same devastating effect upon our
people. Within a comparatively short period of time A.S.&R.
closed its Leadville smelter, National Lead shut down its Freder-
icktown mine and mill, and the American Brass Company an-
nounced a gradual shutdown of its Torrington plant. Only a few
days ago the papers carried a story of the possible shutdown in

the near future of the huge Tacoma smelter.

Our demands for supplementary unemployment benefits
and severance pay are calculated to ease the shock of sudden
joblessness. Our demand for early retirement is not only justi-
fied by the hazardous and difficult work in our industry, but it
is also calculated to provide more jobs for the younger people
in our industry. But these are measures in themselves provid-
ing limited ‘relief for the basic problem of job security.

The only realistic solution to the problems of a growing
permanent group of unemployed is the shorter work week.

*‘A'*

N SPI'l.‘E of the optimistic reports from Washington, unem-
ployment in May declined somewhat from the peak of
5.7 million reached last February,

The unemployment figures for June have not yet been
released, but the experts predict it will be higher than ’ the
February figures and will set a new “record” for the year since
the depression in 1939. Among these millions will be thousands
of our members.

The very same union, the United Packinghouse Workers,
which joined with the Amalgamated Meat Cutters -in the study
previously quoted on the effects of plant shutdowns and auto-
mation on its membership, places the demand for a shorter
Work week first among its 1961 collective bargaining objectives.

**~k

HEY state: “It has been 23 years since the 40 hour work
week was 'made the national standard when Congress
passed the Fair Labor Standards Act (Wage-Hour Law). In-
creased productivity per man hour has now made it essential
that the work week be reduced.” .

This is the critical problem facing the entire labor move-
ment, and now is the time to tackle the job.

We, too, realize, as do the Packinghouse Workers, that this
problem “will not be solved in the negotiations of a single in-
dustry or in a single year, but a beginning must be made some-
time and somewhere. The economic facts of life indicate that

in this year, 1961, the beginning steps are not only necessary
but overdue.”——IRVING DICHTER.

  ‘4 Major Bills Gef Action

WASHINGTON, D. C.—Remaining major legislative proposals in the Kennedy 0.

(Special to Mine-Mill Union)

Administration program were at various stages of progress at the end of June as the
Mine-Mill Union went to press. Among the top priority measures already acted on
during the month or in the home stretch for action were highway construction, hous-
ing, social security and school aid.

Hearings on medical care

for the aged under social
security was promised by Ad-
ministration leaders. As yet
there appeared to be little
prospect of immediate action

on President Kennedy’s latest-

proposal to Congress for a
general overhaul of the unem-

tern.

Administration Lead,
Zinc Plan Outlined A

could be put into effect with-
out new legislative authority,
but that some ‘‘ congressmen
doubted it.

WASHINGTON, D. C.-—The
Kennedy Administration called
a surprise White House meet-
ing of Congressmen from lead-
zinc ‘mining states June 23 to
outline a possible compromise
program to aid lead and zinc
that would be acceptable to
congressional supporters of
lead-zinc subsidies.

The meeting followed by one
week the failure of administra-
tion witnesses to show up as
scheduled to testify before a
House subcommittee on the
Edmondson bill (see item on
Edmondson bill in Industry
Notes column, Page 7).

The White House plan calls
for sale of farm surpluses
abroad for dollars that would
be used to purchase and stock-
pile this year $60 million worth
of lead and zinc mined and
smelted in the U.S.

Another feature of the plan
would be to permit a rise in
the price of silver. This could
be accomplished either by halt-
ing U.S. Treasury sales of sil-
ver, or by increasing the Treas-
ury price. This would help
many lead-zinc mines which
produce silver as a by-prod-
uct.

an an an _

A THIRD proposal was to
speed up recently authorized
federal depressed area aid to

— depressed mining areas. Final-

ly, the White House said there
should be continuing research
on the problems of the lead-
zinc industry. _

An administration official
emphasized that the plan was
“highly tentative.” Congress-

SENATOR Frank Church
(D., Ida.) said the administra-
tion objective was to raise the
U.S. price of lead and zinc
by 2 cents, and the price of
silver by 10 per cent.

Others attending the White
House meeting included Con-
gressmen Baring (D., Nev.),
Joseph Montoya (D., N.M.),

FINAL congressional pas-
sage seemed assured on the
most ambitious omnibus hous-
ing bill in years which should
provide a much-needed stimu-
lation ‘for home construction
and urban improvement. ‘

House-Senate conferees June
27 approved a compromise $5,-
646,000,000 housing bill closer
to President Kennedy’s propo-

sals than either of the bills,

passed by the House and Sen-
ate. Including funds for every

program proposed by the.

President, it expands federal

assistance for new housing to ,

benefit moderate and loW-in-
come families and aid to com-
bat city slums.

Under the compromise bill, _
in the "$11,000 price.

homes
range could be bought under
FHA mortgage insurance with

a total down payment includ-,,,
ing closing costs of 3 percent-

of the purchase price.

The maximum of 30 years
on mortgages would be ‘ex-
tended to 35 years for all new
housing under the FHA pro-
gram, and FHA would be per-
mitted to extend maturities to
40 years on new homes cost-
ing up to $15,000 for buyers
Whose income is not large
enough to enable them to meet
the monthly payments of a
35 year mortgage.

(Congress approved the bill
on June 28.)

* $11 91*

ONLY details remained to
be ironed out by other House-
Senate conferees on a com-
promise " social security bill
which would mean increased
checks for 4.4 million benefi-
ciaries and add 160,000 per-
sons to the benefit rolls.

Passage of the bill was voted
uanimously in the Senate af-
ter Democratic leaders prom-
ised to bring up a medical care

program for the aged later 

this summer.
The measure would give

men the option already held by ' '

women of retiring at 62, in-

stead of 65, on a reduced an- if

nuity. It also provides for an
increase in the minimum
monthly benefit from $33 to
$40, larger benefits for widows

and other survivors of an an- 

nuitant, and a slight liberaliza-
tion in the length of time a
person I must work to obtain
insured status. ’

months, instituted a new get-
tough policy in which they at-

l-oad of all employees. A meet-
ing of Local 679’s grievance
committee with management
failed to budge the company's
will‘ to recoup its claimed
losses with a severe speedup
program. '

On the first day of the new
program the company held off

first two shifts, but sought to
impose it on the third shift.
Result was the walkout at

At a grievance meeting
called by the company the fol-
lowing day a satisfactory writ-

which management agreed to
desist from its efforts to uni-
laterally set up any new work

ditional man was added to the
production line to ease the
work load and the -jobs of
three men were saved from
being eliminated entirely.

Int’l Rep. Edward H. Cole-

top grievance, reported that
the complete solidarity of the

act together was the deciding
factor in this significant fight

0 THE MINE-MILL UNION

July.‘ 1951 I   

Two More Labor Publications  
Back Mine-Mill's Defense Fight ,

DENVER—Two—more major labor publications have recently joined the growing list of those speaking out
in support of Mine-Mill’s defense against Taft-Hartley “conspiracy” charges. They are the LITHOGRAPHERS
JOURNAL, official organ of the Amalgamated Lithograp hers of America, and the CATERING INDUSTRY EM-
PLOYEE, official publication of the AFL-CIO Hotel and Restaurant Emp1oyees.& Bartenders International'Un1on.

The JOURNAL devoted more than a page of its June issue to an ar

‘Conspiracy’, Case.”
The ALA, the article says

in part, “has joined a number
of unions in support of the do-
and
present officers of the Inter-
national Union of Mine, Mill

. and Smelter Workers for an

alleged ‘conspiracy’ to defraud
the government by violating
the anti-labor Taft-Hartley Act.

“In forwarding to the Mine-
Mill Union a. $500 defense con-
tribution voted by the Inter-
national Council, ALA Pres.
Kenneth J. Brown noted that
the ‘importance of the case to
all labor unions lies in the use
by the government of conspir-
acy as the crime charged.’

“This charge has an ‘un-
savory connection’ in labor his-
tory, Brown said, adding . . .
We believe that a victory for
the defense in this case is very
important to the labor move-
ment and to the preservation
of civil rights.’ ”

The JOURNAL.als0 pointed

‘  out that “In addition to the

many unions aiding this ‘con-
spiracy’ defense, a number of
prominent union leaders have
vigorously spoken out against
the government indictment.”

It quoted Sec.-Treas. Gor-
man of the Meat Cutters, Sec.-
Treas. Rosenblum of the Cloth-
ing Workers, Pres. Burke of
the Pulp & Paper Workers,
Pres. Hoffa of the Teamsters,
Pres Quill of the Transport
Workers, Pres. Knight of the
Oil Workers, Pres. Randolph
of the Sleeping Car Porters,
and Sec.-Treas. Hathaway of
the Packinghouse Workers.

The editorial pointed out:

“In the first case, the 23

law still on the books at the
time of trial. It was such an

airtight case they didn’t try
to appeal, and some of the
companies have publicly ac-
knowledged their guilt.

“In the second case, " al-
though the indictments were
three years old, the law the
men were convicted under had
been repealed before the trial»
began. Furthermore, the de-
fendants have an impressive
array of -evidence to warrant
their pending appeal.

“Both cases were prosecuted
by the Department of Justice.

tice’s scales need attention

THE MINE-MILL UNION

MEXICAN MINING LAWS were changed about two “and a
half months ago and are having important effects on U.S.-ow_hed
properties. The law now provides that.companies having less"
than 51 percent Mexican ownership will not be granted new
mining concessions and their present‘, mining rights will_t_ermi-
nate _in 25 years without compensation unlessa a controlling
interest is sold to Mexican nationals. The law also gives; sub-
stantial tax advantages to Mexican-controlled mining com-
panies. ' “’ '0
Within days after the new law took effect, Americanvlvletal
Climax transferred majority control in its Mexican lead-silver
mines, lead smelter and refinery to a group of Mexican inves-
tors, The group intends to expand into zinc smelting and the
manufacture of sulfuric acid. American’ Metal Climax will .:,c_on-

maintenance men and foundry
workers.

The strike, arose over com-
plaints of inadequate safety

measures and work rule‘

changes, including a new shift
system that wouldhave elimi-
nated some premium pay. The
strike of the production work-
ers was settled by an agree-

that work patterns would re-

studied by the company.

Over 1,000 clerical and rail-

strike, however, demanding
pay for the first six days of
the strike. This held produc-
tion down to about two-thirds

of normal. The clerical and‘
railway workers later modified,
