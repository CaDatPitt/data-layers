‘SUDBURY, Ont.--In a ges-

ture of . solidarity with the Ford

strikers, the members of Local
598 voted to donate $1,000 to
help their brothers of the UAW
on the picket line. The action ..
was. taken after an appeal made
by Herman Swanson, Vice Pres-\
ident of Local 200 of UAW and .-
by picket captain Frank Harris
of Windsor, at Mine-Mill meet-

ings in Sudbury. The two UAW .' ~‘
representatives spoke at m"em-"‘

bership meetings here. They

described the Ford -strike as a

challenge to the ‘whole’ labor
movement in,Canada. f 

' Brother Swanson exp lained ‘
‘that they had to wait for..months_

and months before they finally

got" the . Conciliation TBoard’s
award which recommended» next l
Tito nothing. At the same. time,_
A the conipany presented’ propo-

sals that threatened the senior-
ity system.cThe strike was the
only possible answer.

Brother Harris said that the« L

morale of the striliers was
strong and he expressed his

confidence in the final victory

through labor unity such as ex-.
emp/lified by the members-- of
Local 598‘. "
