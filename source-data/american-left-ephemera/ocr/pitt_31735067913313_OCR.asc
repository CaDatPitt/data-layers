Major Factor in Decision,

TUCSON, Ariz.—The International Union of. Mine,

Mill and Smelter Workers is now affiliated with the
United Steelworkers of America. The union’s new status
took effect on Feb. 1, following the unanimous endorse-
ment on Jan. 17 by close to 200 delegates to Mine-Mill’s
special convention at the Pioneer International Hotel
here of the merger of the two unions.

Although bargaining coordination in preparation for
the upcoming nonferrous metals negotiations begins at
once, the actual merger of the two unions will not take
effect until July 1. On that date, Mine-Mill localunions .

in the United States will be re-
chartered as locals of the United
Steelworkers and the separate
existence of’ Mine-Mill in this
country will come toan end.
Merger between the two. un-
ions was enthusiastically ap-
proved by delegates to the Steel-

workers’ convention in Atlantic, ,
City, NJ, 1ast‘_September. The I

merger proposal does not now

cover the Canadian section of

Mine-Mill.

?CoITIbln‘es 80 Percent-
 Last month's convention ‘ac-
tion, by a standing vote at 4:45

pm. on Tuesday, climaxed a "

day-long session which saw a
parade of 40 rank-and-file dele-
gates "take ‘the floor to ‘endorse
the consolidation, many of them
stressing the increased labor

bargaining power in the indus-

The merger will bring together
into one organization some 80

Price Hike Will Pad
Already Rising Profits

The long-rumored copper price increase became effective
early in January with the announcement by the major U.S.
producers——1ed by Phelps Dodge on Jan. 6-that the pro-
ducers’ price would go up two cents per pound to 38 cents.
‘The news was hardly a bombshell since rumors had been
widespread for months that the increase was in the ‘making.

The only question was whether the hike would go as high
as four cents, to 40 cents a pound. Trade sources already are
predicting that such a figure would be reached before the

Government reaction to the two-cent boost was mild. Al-
though Gardner'-Ackley, chairman of the President’s Council-
of Economic Advisers";‘noted’-%that,_‘_‘the excellent ‘financial re-
sults these companies have achievéd*u‘nder,_t_he previous (36c)
domestic price would have permitted its confi
hardship,” he said the administration recognizes thahcopper
-supplies “continue to be tight” and “commends thesé“com-
paniesfor their restraint during the past. year.”

That was a far cry from the November, 1965 situation,
when the administration lowered the boom on a similar two-
cent increase and forced a price rollback.

For five major U. S. Copper producers with whom Mine-
Mill has collective bargaining agreements, the two-cent in-
crease will ‘mean an additional sales income in 1967, on their
domestic copper production only, of some $42,000,000.

,Maior Issues
Primary issues in the strike,
which began on Oct. 22, are the
company's insistenceon a four-
year “agreement and a ..wide
wage differential, amounting to

from 25 to 60 cents an hour less,
'than other mine workers in the.

area. The union maintains that
it will not. undercut the.bargain-
ing position of any section of

which ultimately was passed by
Congress later in 1966.

Major portions of the-speech
were devoted to outlining the
structure and operations of the
USWA and to tracing the paral-
lels in the histories of both Mine-
Mill and the Steelworkers, in-
cluding the opposition of the
companies that often erupted in
violence. Declaring that future
struggles still lie ahead, Abel

-said, “Let us always remember

that human progress has never
been served to mankind on a
silver platter . . . that men of
faith and courage have had to

fight to bring to fulfillment their .

dreams and their hopes and
their aspirations.” '

“This is why our unions have

' come together,”.he maintained.

“Our struggles are inseparably
bound together.”

From. Heart Aﬂ-ack

DENVER, Colo.’ ’— Mine-Mill
Research Director Arthur Stuart,
who suffered a heart attack on
Jan. 6, returned to work at the
union's international headquar-
ters here on Jan. 30, Now work-
ing on a part-time basis, he ex-

.pects to receive‘ his doctor’s

okay to resume , his 11 o r m al
schedule in the near future.

The attack, _less serious than
initially feared, prevented Stuart
from attending the Mine-Mill
convention in Tucson.

He ‘was hospitalized for about
10 days at St. Joseph’s Hospital.
During a two-week. period of re-
cuperation at home,,he regu-
larly reported hisf boredom to
the union office, saying he was
anxious to get to workion prep-
arations for this _year’s promis-
ing round of negotiations,

Other than observing strict
regulations on smoking and
drinking, Suart now is feeling
very well, .

I That some 20 steelworkers
were killed in the great
steel. strike of 1919, only two
years after IWW organizer
Frank Little waslynched in

~ Butte and the" disgraceful
Bisbee deportation of some
1200 Mine-Mill m e mbers
from Arizona occurred. *

“About a year ago,_” said Abel,
“when gold miners in South Da-
kota’s famous .Black Hills once
again chose a union—this time.
the United Steelworkers '— the
pages of labor history again
turned back to the previous un-
ion at Homestake—Min_ers Local
No. 2 of the Western Federation
of Miners, which was broken by
hired gunmen at the turn of the
century.” ‘ ' _ '

The merger—“a big turn in the
wheel of trade union.history”—

the experience and traditions of
our two unions will now be
tossed aside. Far from it. The
best of the knowledge" and the
spirit of the-past will be fused

CHARLESTON, S.C.—Son‘ie 225 workers at the Mobil Chemical

A - an-hour increase is effective on Aug, 26, 1968.

Although agreement on the terms 'of the newpact were reached

New Challenges Lie Ahead,
Skinner Tells Convention

TUCSON, Ariz.—The proposal to merge with the United Steelworkers of America
presents “a new challenge and a new opportunity to contribute our vitality, our expe-
rience, and our militancy to a new phase of history,” Mine-Mill President A. C. Skinner
declared on Jan. 16 in an address to close to 200 delegates to the union’s special con-
vention at the Pioneer International Hotel. -

Stressing the greatly strengthened labor position in upcoming nonferrous metals
industry negotiations that would result from consolidation of the two unions, Skinner
presented a statement on behalf of the Mine-Mill executive board recommending

favorable action on the merger
proposal '— action approved by
the delegates enthusiastically
and unanimously the next day
at the end of a lengthy session.

“For the first time in history,”
Skinner said, “the long estab-
lished bargaining strategy of the

mining companies of playing '

one union against another will
have rough sledding in 1967.”
“For the first time in history,”
he stated, “the combined forces
of Mine-Mill and Steel will be
the vanguard of a united labor
effort at the bargaining table by
all unions in this industry.”

Noting that the recent price
hike in copper will further pad
the already very excellent profit
positions enjoyed by the nonfer-
rous metals producers, Skinner
said that labor, far from spoil-
ing for a fight in 1967, seeks
only genuine collective bargain-
ing that will result in “substan-
tial and overdue improvements
in wages, conditions, and securi-
ty for the men who workin this
industry.” '

Nonferrous Conference

While specific 1967 bargaining
demands will be formulated by
a joint USWA —— Mine;Mi1l non-
ferrous metals conference, in
which membersof both unions’
locals will participate, the Mine-
Mill president pointed out that
pension plans throughout the. in-
dustry were.“long ago outdat-
ed.” In addition to substantial
wage boosts and various fringe
benefits, he listed further safety
and health protection for the
workers a In on g the probable
bargaining objectives.

The decision_ on the merger
question, said the ‘executive
board statement on the subject,

is of “profound importance to‘

our union and of great historic
significance to the entire labor
movement.” Measuring the rap-
id expansion of corporate power
in the industry against, the com-
petitive divisions among the un-
ions, the board said, it had to
be concluded that increased la-
bor strength should begin “with
organic merger between the two

dominant unions in-. the indus-
try " ‘

Lespite the growing power of
the mining companies, said
Skinner, who quoted industry
publications as evidence, they
view the prospect of the union
merger with grave concern.

Pointing out that “our fore-
fathers in the metal mining in-
dustry” were members of scores
of independent unions and dis-
trict unions, and at various
times members of the Knights
of Labor, the Industrial Workers
of the World, the Western Fed-
eration of Miners, "and Mine-
Mill, Skinner said that “if his-
tory teaches us anything, it is
a simple lesson that the only
thing constant is change.” He
noted that Mine-Mill itself had
been affiliated several times
with the AFL and had been in
and out of the CIO, declaring,
“It is obvious that few leaders
or members of this union ever
worshipped the status quo for
very long.”

tinned, has a justifiable sense of
pride in the very substantial
achievements it has produced
for the working people of the
United States and Canada, yet
today it must face a serious
problem—that union representa-
tion in the industry is divided
among 19 international unions.
“It .is all well and good,” he
said, “to state that we did not
contribute to or create this sorry
example of trade union rivalry,
but shouting this from the moun-
tain top will in no way alter the
fact that this condition exists.”

In calling for the approval of
the board’s recommendation for
merger, Skinner said, “In all of
its long history, Mine-Mill has
never deviated from consistent

pursuit of trade union unity.” .-

“We were called every name in
the book,” he said, “but our un-
ion has never pussyfooted on
this key principle of one union
for one industry.” I .

Skinner had high praise for
his fellow members of the un-
ion’s executive board, declaring
that only the unity of purpose
existing on the board made it
possible to develop the princi-
pled proposal for merger now
before the convention,

THE Mme-MILL umon

« January-Fehruillriy,  

Convention Delegates Aid
Tucson Newspaper Strikers

TUCSON, Ariz.——Led by the international officers of both Mine-Mill and the United
Steelworkers, the 250 delegates and guests to Mine-Mill’s special convention at the Pio-
neer Hotel here, immediately upon adjournment on Jan. 18, paraded two blocks north
to join the picket line of the Tucson Typographical Union, now engaged in a bitter
strike against the Arizona Daily Star and the Tucson Daily Citizen.

The display of union solidarity was widely covered by radio and television stations
in the city as well as by the Tucson Free Press, which has been published weekly over
the past two months by the typographical local “in the interest of non-monopolistic

newspapers” and distributed
free or charge throughout the
community.

. "Board Statement

Mine-Mill locals in the state
previously had urged their mem-
bers to support thestrike, which
began on"-Nov. 28, and the un-
ion’s /international e x e c u t i v e
board, .3 meeting prior to last
month's ..thre.e - day convention,
pledged _‘Mine -.Mi1l’s assistance
and ; cgoperation, V “Condemning
and opposing the action of this
n n f _a' i t‘ newspaper publisher,"
the board’ urged the union's
members not to buy, read, sub-
scribe to, or’ advertise in either
of the papers and to, “make
clear ourﬁthoughts and position
on this labor dispute to those
merchants who continue to aﬁ-
vertise , in these newspapers.”

Charging that William A.
Small, J_r., owner and publisher
of the two Tucson dailies, al-
lowed‘ and insisted on the unjust
discharge of Jack Gridley, pres-
ident of'the Tucson Typograph-
ical Union, and another union
official, ‘ the Mine-Mill board
noted that “this ruthless em-
ployer has imported professional
strikebreakers from out of state
to take the jobs of local citizens
and taxpayers of many years’
standing in an attempt to break
this strike.”

Should he be successful, the
resolution continued, not only
would a threat be posed to all
segments of organized labor in
the state, but also the economy
of theventire area would be low-
ered.

In joining the ITU picket line,
Mine-Mill convention delegates
carried, signs provided by the
typographical local, most of
which pointed out the use of im-
ported strikebreakers by the
publisher. ‘Close to 150 union
members are on strike.

-Issues in Strike

In addition’ to the illegal dis-
charge (if the _two union officials
prior to ‘the start of negotiations,
issues inthe dispute include the
refusal of_-thepublisher to nego-
tiate ‘ an a’c"ceptable grievance
procedure and his continuation
of the subcontracting of print-

ing. work. Although union print- H

ers have been working without‘
a raise in wages for over four
years, ‘the employer has at-
tempted to attach unreasonable
conditions in bargaining on a
wage increase.

The Arizona Star was pur-

chased by the Tucson Citizen in

January, 1965, after the latter
refused to allow the purchase of

 

the supposedly independent
newspaper by another prospec-
tive buyer. The sale has been
under attack by the federal gov-
ernment since 1965 as a viola-
tion of anti-trust law.

Since that time, too, the hours

and days off of union members .

have been changed almost. week-
ly. In addition to work being
sent out to other shops,-, adver-
tisers were‘ required ,.to furnish
copy in a pasted-up form ready
for photography. E n g r a v i n g s
were then made from the photos
at a shop owned and ‘operated
as a separate business by the

newspapers’ productionimanag-'

er. . .
H The Mine-Mill executive board,
in its resolution on the strike,
charged that all efforts to ne-
gotiate and conciliate. the dis-
pute have failed “due to the ar-
rogant and arbitrary attitude of
this employer.” V
Thanks to ITU

In a separate statement, the
board expressed its thanks to
the International Typographical
Union for action taken at its
107th convention in Washington,
D. C. authorizing ITU officers

to pin with the American Civil-

Liberties Union and several oth-
er trade unions in filing abrief
with the .U. S. Supreme Court
urging that it review the Mine-
Mill “conspiracy” case. On re-
view, the high court last June
overturned the convictions of the
last six remaining defendants in
the case.

The resolution pr a i s e d the
ITU as a union always in the

forefront when the causes of.

justice require defending, and
the leadership of Elmer Brown,
the union's president. ,

Some 6,000 employees of Union Carbide, the nation’s 10th largest corporation,
today remain on strike at nine of the company’s plants, vowing to see the struggle
through to the achievement of decent contracts at all locations. Over the strenuous
objections of the United Steelworkers of America, a Taft-Hartley injunction sent an-
other 2,150 strikers back to their jobs at the Hayes-Stellite plant of the company in
Kokomo, Ind. late in December.

Strikers are members of the Steelworkers, the International Chemical Workers,
and the Oil, Chemical & Atomic Workers Union. The AFL-CIO executive council has

voted full support for the strike
action and has asked for a
boycott of Union Carbide prod-
ucts. - :
These include Prestone; anti-

freeze, Eveready batteries and
‘related equipment, Bakelite Glad ‘

Bags, and Englander mattresses
and sofa beds.

80-Day Order
Federal Judge Leonard ,P,.

Walsh issued the 80-day back-L

to-work order to Kokomo strik-
ers on the ground that the work

' stoppage substantially affected

the production of military jet
aircraft engines. A three-judge

panel of the U.S. Circuit Court 6

of Appeals upheld the injunction.

The USWA appealed the ruling
to the U.S. Supreme Court, but
the high court refused review,
leaving unresolved the question
of the government’s authority to
halt a strike at a single indus-
trial plant under the “national
emergency” provisions of Taft-
Hartley.

“We bitterly resent,?’ said
James P. Griffin, USWA Dis-
trict 26 director and coordinator
of the Steelworkers locals in-
volved in the Union Carbide
negotiations, “the imposition of
an injunction breaking‘ a legal
strike while the company con-
tinues to be rewarded with the
benefits of a government con-
tract.”

Charging that the company
consistently has refused to bar-
gain in good faith, Griffin

G. C.Johnson
Dies after ,
Long Illness,

Glenn C. Johnson, 63, a trus-
tee for the past five years of
Mine-Mill Local 16 in Great
Falls, Mont., died recently in a
local hospital. He had been in
failing health for the past year.

Born in Leonard, Minn., he
‘came to Montana in 1951 and
for the past 15 years was em-
ployed as an operator in zinc
casting at the Anaconda Com-

" pany smelter.

In addition to his union activi-
ties, Johnson was a member of
the Sons of Norway and a mem-

ber of the Cascade County Wild-

life Association.’

The Rev. Glenn Essenberg of-
ficiated at funeral services at
Emmanuel Baptist Church. Bur-
ial was in Highland Cemetery.

Johnson, who made his home

in Black Eagle, is survived by

his wife Helen; two sons, David
and Stanley, both of Great
Falls; four daughters, Mrs. Har-

old Clausen, Mrs. Gerald Lar-‘

son, and Mrs. Violet Bakken,
all of Great Falls, and Mrs’.

’ Duane Otness of Bagley, Minn.;

three brothers, Hatty, _ Law-
rence, and Elton Johnson," all
_ ‘three sisters,
Mrs. Fred Meyers of Boring,
0re., and Mrs. Windsor Benson
and Mrs. -Hazel Lundell, both of

A -383.19,)’; Minn.; L13 grandchil-
 ; dren; and several nieces an
nephews. , _ :~

argued that “There are other
procedures the government
should have invoked instead of
a procedure that forcestworkers

back "to work under conditions’

they do not desire, while no

similar, penalty is invoked".-

against the company.” — —

A union brief asking that th
injunction be set aside" said that
the Taft-Hartley emergency pro-
visions apply only to those
strikes affecting an entire in-
dustry or a substantial part of
an industry, and that the Koko-
mo strike alone does not fit
those requirements. It also
noted that the president may
seize a plant that fails to pro-
duce goods needed for national
defense purposes or may compel
other plants or companies to
give immediagsge attention to de-
fense requirements.

July Lockout

The Union Carbide strife be-
gan when the company locked
out 1,200 OCAW members at
Alloy, W. Va. last July 1, an
action subsequently ruled illegal
by NLRB Examiner George J .
Bott, who states that the com-

. pany is guilty of discrimination,

coercion, and refusal to bargain.
Carbide, he said, tried to force
the workers to accept unwanted
amendments to the pension-
insurance plan, which was not
open for bargaining until 1967,
in exchange for economic gains
they were seeking.

The lockout triggered the
three-union strike. In some of
the plants, basic contracts are
up for negotiation; in others,

‘only the issues of pay scales

under reopener clauses.

Lambasted by U.S. Sen.-

Wayne_ Morse (D-0re.), whose
state is the site of one of the

struck properties, as having a '

“sorry record of 19th century
anti-unionism,” Carbide has re-
fused to engage in coordinated
bargaining with the unions in-

_, volved. To help prevent the
_company’s playing one union
against another, an AFL-CIO,
- - Industrial Union Department
steering committee was set up, '

comprised of representatives
from each of the striking locals.

“This is the only way we, as
trade unionists, will be able to
negotiate changes in the national
policy of Union Carbide,” a
union spokesman said.

Helicopters in Ohio

At the Ashtabula, Ohio plant,
where 850 USWA members
walked" out on Aug. 28, company
officials resorted to helicopter
service to ﬂy in strikebreakers,
food, and equipment. A Decem-

ber court order secured by the’

union finally grounded them.

Attempts to organize the
Kokomo plant over a period of
25 years were unsuccessful pri-
marily because of the barrage
of propaganda put out by the
company and its other union-
busting tactics. Bargaining
rights at Kokomo, where the
strike began last Sept. 29, were
won by the USWA a little over
a year ago.

In voicing its support for the
strike, the AFL-CIO council de-
clared that Union Carbide,
which in 1965 enjoyed sales of
over $2 billion, for years has
insisted on making unilateral de-
cisions on pensions, insurance,
wage rates, vacations and holi-
days.

Other plants on strike are at
Sisterville, W. Va. (ICWU);
Marietta, Ohio (OCAW); Speed-
way, Ind. (OCAW); three plants
in Whiting, Ind. (OCAW); and
Portland, Ore. (USWA).

Arbitration Win Nullifies
‘No Precedent’ Practice

MIAMI, Ariz.—A total of~10 shifts in back pay was divided 

among four members of Mine-Mill Local 586 here as the result of
an arbitration victory late last year in which Dr. George H. Hilde-
brand of Ithaca, N. Y. overruled an Inspiration Concslidated Copper
Company practice of writing “no precedent” on certain wage set-

tlements for special jobs.

Masons Jesus Macias and Ernest B. Rascon each were award-V
ed four shifts’ pay, representing double-time for their work in re-.

lining the inside brick walls of
the acid tower in the leaching
department from Nov. 8 to 11,
1965. Julianlorona and Rita Cas-
tillo, who served as helpers on
the job, won time-and-a-half
rather than straight time pay-
giving each an extra shift in
back pay.
‘Total Characteristics‘

In making his decision, Hilde-
brand noted, “Any job is a job
as such not by reason of its skill
requirements alone, but because
of its total basic characteristics:
special tasks to be performed,
location of the work site, and
particular environmental condi-
tions such as hazard, discom-
fort, unusual difficulties, and so
on.” He agreed with the union’s
contention that the tower work
constituted a new job, pointing
out that the physical location of

the work site was different, fall-

ing within the leaching rather  .

than the smelting department. ,; " ‘
The company, too, he stated, 

acknowledged that a new job" A

had been created—both by pay-
ing premium rates when such

work previously had been per‘-. , .
formed in 1963 and byoffering 
premium rates of lower amount 

on the second occasion.’

The settlement of a grievance V— *
in 1963, which had provided 
double-time pay for the mas'o"nsjt[ “
on the job and time-and-a-half 
for the helpers, included a state-  7
ment that “no precedent is ,es-  '
tablished for future work"in S" V‘
these absorption towers orany .
other similar work.” But Hilde.- ; 
brand said the “no precedent-”.*

clause did not govern,

Mine-Mill Brings.

, Santa to Hayden

HAYDEN, Ariz.—Members :‘0f.
two local unions here, Mine-Mill
Locals 886 and 939, rolled up
their sleeves, dug into their
pockets _for some expense
money, and put on a gala
Christmas party for the chil-
dren in this area. Santa Claus
was present. ‘

-The communities of Hayden
and Winkelman are small iso-
lated mining- towns. In the past,
the children had to be driven‘
the 70-odd miles to the shop-
ping areasof Tucson at Christ-
mas time if they were to chat
with the whiskered gentleman.

Last December, the union
members decided that some-

thing had to be done about this -'

situation, so they went to work
on the project. The children’s
response at the party was so
heartwarming that this activity
is expected to be a regular
yearly event in the future.

States in 1926'. He first_worked

bargaining structure, adopted at
the union’s September conven-
tion to give the rank-and-file a
more powerful voice in. negoti-
ations. "Also spelled out in the
agreement, however, are other
areas in which “unity will in-
evitably bring gains”——in achiev-
ing progressive state and feder-
al legislation, in political action,
in civil rights, and in organizing

the unorganized. - --

Civil Rights Stressed

Both unions, the merger docu-
ment declares, ,“are conscious
of the fact that much‘ still re-
mains to be done in the struggle
- to provide full social, economic,
and political equality in Ameri-
can life.”,Stating that both or-
ganizations are fully committed
to this struggle, .it adds, “The
unity, which ~ this agreement
seeks to ,achie_ve will _bring re-
newed strength, devotion, and
determination to this task.” i
t The con_vention’s_ large and
broadly representative, resolu-
tions-* committee, chaired by
Board Members Maclovio R.
Barraza and Barney Rask, spent
the afternoon of Jan, 16 discus-
_sing the merger proposal before
unanimously supporting a favor-
able recommendation on the is-
sue. The 17 resolutions submit-
ted to the committee by local

chartered 70 years ago in the
Western Federation of Miners,

‘stated with pride that the un-

agreement reached on Dec. 4,
successfully concluding a strike
by members of Local 1543 of the

Anaconda Wire and Cable Co.,
includes wage increases of up
to 20 cents an hour.

Mﬁdk‘-are Loyalty
Oath Abandoned

The Justice Department last
month conceded that the non-
Communist disclaimer in the
medicare law is unconstitu-
tional, thus making some 3.4

million persons not covered by ~ -

Social Security elegible for its
benefits without having to swear
a loyalty oath. Z

' Solicitor General Thurgood
Marshall said that the govern-
ment would not appeal a-rul-
ing, by a special three-judge
federal court in Los Angeles,
that barred enforcement of the
provision. The case was one of
several challenges of the law
brought by the American Civil
Liberties Union.

Marshall noted that "the Su-
preme Court’s 1966 decision
striking down an Arizona loyalty
oath appeared to settle the
medicare issue also. Mrs. Bar-
bara Elfbrandt, who taught
school in Tucson, Ariz. without
pay for five years because she
refused‘ to sign the state’s oath,

awarded $31,574.87.

Warren Dissents Strongly
On Court’s Hoffa Decision

WASHINGTON, D. C. —— Chief Justice Earl Warren issued a stinging dissent when,
on Dec. 12, the U. S. Supreme Court upheld the conviction of James R. Hoffa, presi-
dent of the Teamsters Union, on charges of jury tampering — a decision putting the
stamp of approval on the government’s use of stoolpigeons in pressing prosecutions.

“The use of secret informers is not per se unconstitutional,” said Justice Potter
Stewart, in delivering the court’s verdict. I ‘

With Hoffa facing a sentence of eight years in prison and a fine of $10,000, the de-

fense has asked the court for a
rehearing. R e w a r d s totaling
$200,000 have been offered for
information leading to proof that
wire taps and eavesdropping de-
vices were used by federal au-
thorities or their agents in the
Hoffa prosecution—$100,000 each
by the “Friends of James R.
Hoffa Committee” and William
Loeb, Manchester-,,N.H. publish-
er. s
Only Key Witness

The case against Hoffa" rested
primarily on the testimony of
Edward Grady Partin, a Louisi-
ana -Teamsters local official,
himself in trouble with the law
on several charges, who was
asked by the government to
serve as aninformer during a
1962 trial of Hoffa on conspiracy
charges, which resulted in a
deadlocked jury.

‘Partin’s search for evidence
against Hoffa in the Teamsters
leader's private hotel quarters
was a forced entry without Hof-
fa's consent, asserted the Amer-
ican Civil Liberties Union, in a
friend-of-the-court brief asking
reversal of the jury tampering

, conviction, because of Partin’s

“concealment of his role as a

government spy and his passing

himself off as a loyal friend.”
Justice Warren, while stating
his belief that not every use of
undercover agents is improper,
declared that “the nature of the
official practices evidenced here
(in the Hoffa case) is offensive
to the fair administration of jus-
thee in federal courts.” “Here,”
he said “Edward Partin, a jail-
bird languishing in a Louisiana
jail under indictments for such
state and federal crimes as em-
bezzlement, kidnapping and
manslaughter (and soon to be
charged with perjury and as-
sault), contacted federal author-
ities andtold them he was will-
ing to become, and would be
usefulas, an informer against
Hoffa who was then about to be
tried. in the Test Fleet case.”
“Given the incentives and
background of Partin,” contin-
ued Justice Warren, “no convic-
tion .should be allowed to stand

when based heavily on his testi-
mony.”

“The government of a strong
and free nation does not need
convictions based upon such tes-
timony,” he said, “It cannot af-
ford to abide with them.”

Purl-in Well Paid

The Chief Justice noted that
Partin was well paid by the gov-
ernment, “both through devious
and secret alimony payments to
his divorced wife and, it may
be inferred, by executed prom-
ises not to pursue the indict-
ments under which he was
charged at the time he became
an informer.”

The Warren dis s e n t also
quotes Sydney Simpson, Partin’s
cellmate-in the Louisiana jail,
who testified by affidavit as fol-
lows: “On one occasion I asked
Partin if he knew enough about
Hoffa to be of any help to (Bill)
Daniels (an officer in Louisiana)
and the FBI, and Partin said, ‘It
doesn’t make any difference. If
I don’t know, I can fix it up.’ ”

Justices Wiliam 0. Douglas
and Tom 0. Clark, after hearing

_ the case, said, they wouldn’t have

granted review in the first place,
but Justice Douglas, in two al-
lied cases, dissented strongly
against the government’s use of
informers. A

olution passed at the union’s 1965
convention, in support of efforts

not only because of our faith in _

the Teamsters,” the resolution
declared, “but because of the
necessity to re-establish justice
in an asmosphere conducive to
fair play.”

SAVANNAH, Ga. -— Across-
the-board wage increases total-
ing 29 cents per hour highlight
a three-year contract agreement
reached in December between

‘Mine-Mill Local 870 and the‘

Southern Fertilizer and Chemi-
cal Company. The pact covers
about 60 workers.

Although the company h a (I
wanted to revamp the entire
grievance procedure and senior-
ity clause and had pushed for
a “no strike” provision allowing
the union to be sued in the event
of a wildcat, it backed off in the
face of the determination shown
by the membership.

In addition to the wage gains,
the settlement provides im-
proved weekly sickness and ac-
cident benefits, increased medi-
cal benefits, a hike from $8 to
$12 per day for hospital room
and board, and an increase in

Arbitrator Orders Reinstatement and
Back Pay for Baltimore llS&ll Worker

BALTIMORE, Md.—A recent arbitration victory by Mine-Mill
Local 625, union leaders contend, should restrain the company from
attempting to discourage workers from filling workmen’s compen-
sation claims by taking disciplinary action against them. Arbitra-
tor Peter Di Leone issued a decision in December ordering the
American Smelting and Refining Company here to reinstate, with
three weeks’ back pay, Henry Ford, a maintenance department
employee who was fired after a claim that he filed was denied
by the Maryland State Workmen’s Compensation Commission.

The award verifies that a worker cannot be discharged for fil-—

ing such a claim, even if it is
found to be unmeritorious.

Ford's claim, filed after he
suffered an on—the-job back in-
jury on April 17, 1963, was
denied by the commission on
March 28, 1966. He was fired
by AS&R two days later.

Attempt '|'o Set Example

Although the company main-
tained that Ford had filed a
false claim and had given mis-
leading and evasive testimony
regarding previous back injuries
at a hearing before the compen-
the union
charged that his dismissal was
simply an attempt to discourage
others who might become in-
jured from filing such claims.

Local 625 pointed out that the
grievant lost no time from work
after the injury and that his
work record was good at all
times—both before and after the
injury.

In deciding for the union, Di
Leone found that the company-
did not present any “clear and
convincing evidence” to support
its dismissal of Ford, stating,

C400 Unionists af     .
Parley Hit Viet Nam Policy   e 

CHICAGO, Ill. — Some 400. union members 2 and .off_icials from 32 _international
unions, meeting at the McCormick_ Place hereon Dec. 17, strongly supported the pro-
posal by Senate Majority Leader Mike Mansfield. (D-Mont.) for an extension of the
holiday truce in Viet Nam. Among those in attendance were Mine-Mill District 4 Board
Member Raymond Dennis and representatives from Mine-Mill Local.758 in Chicago.

Sponsored by the Chicago Union Division of SANE (Committee for a Sane
Nuclear Policy), the parley attracted trade unionists from Cleveland, Detroit, Pitts-
burgh, Milwaukee, Chicago, and_ other areas in the Midwest who joined in protesting

the policy of the Johnson admin-
istration in Southeast. Asia and
the support of th at policy by
the national AFL-CIO leader-
ship.

Labor, maintained M u r r a y
H. Finley, conference chairman
and manager of the Chicago
b o a r d of the Amalgamated
Clothing Workers Union, “like
the rest of the general public,
is disturbed by the Viet’ Nam
war.” .‘

U.S. Rep. John Conyers, Jr.
(D-Mich), a member of and
former international representa-
tive for the United Auto Work-
ers, declaring that American so-
ciety cannot at one and the
same time afford both guns and
butter, said that the war must
be ended before poverty a n d
slums can be wiped out in the
United States. One of the few
Congressmen who have ex-
pressed their opposition to the

' war in Viet Nam by voting

against appropriations fo r it,
Conyers also stressed the im-
portance of labor’s understand-
ing of and support for the civil
rights movement in this coun-
try.

.-..*,_ Re-elected himself by a whop-
ping 84 percent of the vote,
Conyers said that the positive
aspects of the November elec-
tions were the gains made by
Negroes on the state and local
levels and the failure of the so-
called white backlash to ma-
terialize to the extent feared.

Bombing Halt Urged

" " In addition to endorsing an
.-.,extension of -the holiday ‘truce

.- .in Viet "Nam, the resolution

. adopted by the Chicago meeting

:  called for the cessation of the

.1 six)’

/

bombing of North Viet Nam and
negotiations which would include
all those involved in the present
conﬂict. “It is increasingly
clear,” the resolution said, “that
the simple solution to the Viet
Nam war offered again a n d
again —'— ‘victory through escala-
tion’ — cannot succeed.”

Ralph Holstein, president of
the Packinghouse Workers,
closed th e meeting by calling
upon organized labor to lend its
resources and talents to the job
of organizing the“‘have nots”
in America. To the extent that
it is made known to politicians
that there are votes in support
of the: wars against ignorance
and poverty, he said, will they
support the Great Society pro-
gram and pay less attention to

the wishes and dictates of the_

military-industrial complex now
dominating the affairs of the
count1?§.

Among the many international
and local union officials listed
as sponsors of the conference

Progress in Job Security-

DENVER, Colo. — New con-
tracts just concluded for 60,000
oil industry workers are keyed
to the theme that proposed.
reductionsin force will be “a
matter for serious and construc-
tive collective bargaining”’ in
the future, President A. F. Gros-

In a statement marking th e
successful close of the union’s

21966-67 bargaining with major

oil firms, Grospiron expressed
his gratification that “broad seg-

.ments of the American oil in-

dustry have reached agreement
. . _. without a moment of work
stoppage, on impressive eco-
nomic gains — an estimated 44

cents an hour over two years —

and on the very important prin-
ciple of job security.”

CopperCompany Seizure in Congo
The Congolese government on Jan. 1 took over the facilities
of Union Miniere de Haut Katanga, Belgian-based copper producer
operating in the African, ‘republic. The , seizure was a further
attempt to force the company to‘ moveits corporate headquarters

' from Brussels to Kinshasa, the Congo capital, and to become more"

fully integrated into the whole Congolese economy. The company
has called for a boycott of copper produced from the seized
facilities and threatensglegal action. ' ' " '

Union Miniere’s 1965 production was about 330,000 tons; of '
copper, 200,000 tons‘ of zinc, and a variety of other minerals. It-

employed more than 22,000 workers and was thesource of a major
portion of the Congo’s tax revenue and hard currency.

Trade observers are unable to determine whether the govern-
ment takeover has caused any reduction in minerals output from
the Union Miniere operations.

Lead-Zinc Producers Uneasy,

 Despite Increased Consumption _
Zinc con_s,umpt/ion in 1966 increased.4 percent over 1965, and the

American Zinc Institute is optimistic about a continued high level-

for 1967.

a Lead consumption, too, is upwfor 1966, at a new U.S.§ record of '

'1.3h’million tons. a 6 _ ,
 However, lead-zinc producers are uneasy. Here are some of
their reasons: ’
. - , '_O Possible automobile production cutbacks .r_educing con-
'. sumption of zinc die-castings and sheets, andlead for batteries. ‘T
_ C New mine production-in‘ -the offing from Missouri and
- elsewhere.  , 7 , .~  v   h  - _

Utah labor law
Review Board
Completes Work

SALT LAKE CITY, Utah -
Gov. Calvin L. Rampton re-
cently announced plans to sub-
mit a labor recodification ,bill
to this session of the state
legislature. The measure re-
sults from an 18-month effort by
the Utah Labor Law Review
Committee, appointed by Ramp-
ton to draft revisions in the
state’s labor laws in order to
eliminate the confusion and dis-
crepancies which have crept into
the statutes over the years.

The committee was charged
only with the ' clarification of
present laws, not the drafting
of new ones. . A
, Rampton said that the legisla-

ture should either accept or V

reject the bill, since amending
it inany major way would en-
danger its constitutionality. The
state"s ( constitution provides that
only appropriation and codifica-
tion measures may deal with

for the working places served
by 5213 raise in “B” north level.
0 The oil-storage house was
cleaned.
O A walkway was constructed
at the 5219 sublevel in 5201 “B”

_ north adit.

‘O Combustible material should"
not be permitted less than 100

feet from the mine ‘portal.

0 Explosives should not be
stored in a building that does not
meet the speciﬁcations of an ex-
plosives-storage magazine. '

, O Explosives should be moved-
from the permanent surf a c e‘

magazine without delay and at‘ = z
a time when the least number of '

employees will be exposed.
E 6 Electric ‘detonators should

' --be stored in a- substantially con-

structed building of noncombus-
tible material or covered with
fire-resistant material.

.0 Underground explosives dis-
tribution magazines should be 10
feet from the tracks or haulage-
ways, w ell constructed, and
fitted with doors._

0 A semiconductive loading
hose should be installed on ejec-
tors used to charge blastholes
with sensitized ammonium -ni-
trate blasting agents.

Q The ejector and components ,

should be grounded effectively.

0 /Unused explosives and deto-
nators should be returned
promptly to ' t h e i r respective
magazines after loading opera-
tions are completed.

O The electric blasting cable ‘

should be mounted on insulators

. and away from power cables,
pipelines, and other possible

sources‘ of stray currents.

O The ladderway and landings
in 5217 raise “B” north should
be cleaned, :

O The missing ladder section

in 5217 raise “B” north should’

be replaced. '

0 Men should not stand on
mine cars to pull chutes.

O Taillights, should be mount-
ed on the rear of the trailing

O A handle or equivalent de-
vice should be used to move the
coupling pins on the mine cars.

I The timber sets 150 south of
