   

judged by the statements of its leadership, the union is
glowing with prosperity. And yet we must ask: how ﬁrm is
the union position? Is it as strong as the leadership would
have us believe?

These questions are pertinent in view of the fact that
we have entered a new period for the country and for the
union as well. We have just gone through a war marked
by the greatest industrial activity and employment. It was
also a time of relative peace in industry, with few labor dis-
putes and struggles. Since the end of the war, however, a
new offensive has been launched by Big Business against
the trade unions. ' ,  ,

How prepared is the I.L.G.W.U. for this new situation?

It will be recalled that the I.L.G.W.U. after the ﬁrst
World War had over 100,000 members and was among the
strongest unions in the labor movement. But one year after
the war its membership and organization began to fall, de-
clining sharply even iﬁ the prosperous Years of 1923 to
1929, just at the time when there should have been a
further increase, and ﬁnally hit rock bottom with the dues-
paying membership standing at about 20,000 in 1932-
almost total collapse.

Collapse lifter World War I

This catastrophic decline was the ‘result of the false
policies of the union, then headed by Morris Sigman.

The leadership, which included David Dubinsky, at that '

time managerof Cutters Local 10 and a Vice—President of
the International, was unwilling to carry on a ﬁght against
the postwar drive of the manufacturers to worsen condi-
tions and weaken the unions. Instead, it followed the
leadership of the A. F. of L; and put forward a program of
cooperation with the manufacturers which, in practice,
meant Capitulation and surrender to wage cutting and
‘ 8

 

 

but from the strength and ﬁghting spirit of theworking
class itself. a _ /
These men and women are, nonetheless, progressive
and militant trade unionists; most of them have awakened
to unionism only recently and have not yet lost their faith
in capitalism, but they are ﬁghting the trusts and are be-

coming class conscious. They promote independent poli-

tical action by labor. They are demanding government
checks on the trusts, and they are bound to develop fur-
ther. They are moving from backward to advanced posi-
tions in relation to the big social and political questions
of the day. They will in time take up the viewpoint of
socialism. ‘l’ A

The Dubinsky group, however, has moved the other
way; it has receded steadily from a more advanced to a
backward position. “As you know I was a Socialist for many
years. When I resigned from the Socialist Party in 1936
it was for purely political reasons. We believed in the New
Deal and wanted Roosevelt elected. But since that time I
have come to the conclusion that Socialism, certainly the
orthodox variety, will not work,” said Dubinsky, in ex-
pounding his views to Benjamin Stolberg, as recorded in
Tailofs Progress. “Trade unionism needs capitalism like
a ﬁsh needs water,” he continued.,“Democracy is pos-
sible only in a society of free enterprise and trade unionism
can live only in a democracy.”“

Lock, Stock and‘ Barrel

-These are the same views held for 50 years by Samuel
Gompers, the leader of the American Federation of Labor,
and which were bitterly criticized and fought -by socialists
in the past, not only because such views rejected the strug-

' gle_for a new system of society, but because they tied labor

to the capitalist class. Such views, stunted its growth and

made it a pawn in the hands of the capitalists—accounting
for the fact that the labor movement during the Gompers
regime was the smallest and most backward in the world.
Today the Dubinskyites have taken over these outworn
views lock, stock and barrel.

When Gompers held these views they were, of course,
wrong; but they were formed in the youth of the labor
movement, when capitalism was still competitive and de-
veloping and seemed to be imbued with the spirit of

eternal life. Then socialism had not yet appeared or seemed-

a remote thing, and capitalism in the main countries still
practiced democracy, though always of a restricted kind.
Most of these features, however, changed even before
Gompers died in 1924. But Dubinsky and his group have
renounced socialism and have taken to the system of
capitalism when it has evolved into large scale national
and international monopolies and cartels which smother
small business and wipe out free enterprise. They extol
capitalism when the country is being throttled and choked
by the trusts; when capitalism on a world scale has proven

' that it is an outmoded and dying system which dooms

millions to starvation, unemployment, recurring crises
and wars. They lend their support to the present system
when socialism has not only been established in one-sixth
of the world, in the U.S.S'.R., but works and has proven ‘to
be a far superior system, and when capitalism wipes out de-
mocracy, curbs and destroys trade unionism and when
the whole system is shot through and through’ with reac-
tion, violence and fascism. ‘

i A Dying Sytem

It is true that capitalism is still strong in the United
States, but it is affected by the same mortal ailment as '
capitalism elsewhere and is unable to solve the problem
, ofﬁnding-markets for its huge output, or avoid shatter-

.99‘

 

a ing crises. Only shallow opportunists who live from day to

day and cannot see further than their noses would argue
that American capitalism can free itself of the effects of
general decay. It is now trying to do so by aiming to sub-
ject the whole world to_ its rule and the Dubinskyites are
helping, but this will not improve the situation of capital-
ism. It can only worsen it.

The Dubinskys, Wolls, Hutchesons and Lewises, still
talk of themselves as hard-headed ‘people concerned with
practical affairs who have no use for the “visionary ideas
of radicals.” But they are nothing of the kind. Experience
proves that they are the most shortsighted people who
sacriﬁce both the immediate as well as future interests
of the working people, injure trade unionism, undermine
democracy and the economic well—being of the nation
the same as their kind of opportunists did in Europe in
the past 25' years. They are really organizers of defeat of
the working class.

They also make it appear that they are broad'social-
minded people whosehorizon includes national matters,
the well—being of the whole country, whereas those oppos-
ing them are narrowly selﬁsh and interested only in a class.
But they are nothing of the kind. They‘ represent the nar-
rowest craft interests of a very small section of well-paid
workers (and nowadays even betray them) while they serve
the most selﬁsh interests of the top layer of capitalists, and
sacriﬁce the well-being of the millions of toilers and of the
nation as well. Only a working class leadership that vigor-
ously acts in behalf of the whole of labor and the people
can strengthen and promote the nation.

To the Rescue

The degeneracy of the Dubinsky group did not begin
in 1936. It began much earlier and was already evident in
1917 when. the Russian Revolution occurred. The revolu-

tion brought the workers to power and established social-
ism. It was a test for all who avowed a belief in socialism,
and in that test the Social—Democratic Dubinsky group
failed. They disavowed the Russian Socialist Republic and
joined with the capitalist world to ﬁght it. Their View was
summed up by Morris Hillquit, attorney for the Interna-
tional Ladies Garment Workers Union and leader of the
Socialist Party. “The Soviet Government has been the
greatest calamity that has ever occurred to the Socialist
movement. Let us disassociate ourselves from the Soviet
Government.” They not only disassociated themselves
from the Soviet Union, but became its avowed enemy and
worked unceasingly against it.

They not only adopted a reactionary attitude to the
Russian Revolution, but became ardent defenders of the

capitalist system and worked to restore it to normal again

after the shattering effects of the First World War and
the revolutionary upheavels of the working class which
their Social-Democratic friends in Europe helped to
crush. In practice, in the period after the ﬁrst World
War this became support for the plans of American
capital to turn labor into a collection of docile workers.
They supported the notorious speed—up schemes which
the corporations camouﬂaged as systems of proﬁt-sharing
and labor—capital partnership, and spread the big business

propaganda that a “new capitalism” was arising which.

would develop into “industrial democracy.” They signed
secret supplementary agreements with the employers to
boost production which nulliﬁed the written agreements.
They insisted then, as they are doing again today, that
labor must fulﬁll a new-role which excluded the policy
of class struggle. That role was to collaborate with capital-
ism in its production schemes and at the same time estab-
lish labor banks and insurance companies by which means
they claimed the workers would be able to secure a domin-

1 0

ant position in our society. In reality, this course trapped
101

 

 

, the labor movement and enfeebled it. The membership V

 

of the trade unions dropped to its lowest point- And in

the end the “new capitalism” went down in the Big Crash
of 1929. °

Surrender

Of course, the surrender to the employers did not im-
prove but worsened conditions of the garment workers. A
large section elected a left-wing leadership in New'York

and in 1926 went on strike. At first the Sigman and Dubin'- '

sky group, apostles of class peace, who controlled the na-
tional leadership of the" union, opposed a strike. However,
when the workers demonstrated an overwhelming will to
strike because of the fearful conditions, they agreed and
sanctioned it, but they sabotaged it, worked against its
success, and ﬁnally settled it to the detriment of the union,
going over the heads of the New‘York joint Board and
theleaders of the strike. They then ran the whole gamut

T’ of crimes against the union by expelling the New York

locals under left wing leadership which had a majority
of the members of the union behind them, and cooperated
openly with the employers» and the police to perpetuate

- ‘themselves in office.

Their subsequent history was described in the opening
chapter of this pamphlet. The union, under their leader-

ship, suffered a catastrophic decline. It recovered in the

Roosevelt period as a result of the general upsurge of the
labor movement and the militant activities of the mem-
bership. The Dubinsky group was swept along with the
progressive tide but detached itself at the ﬁrst opportunity
and began a retreat which it is continuing with renewed
speed. ﬂy

Having assimilated themselves with capitalism, they go.

on with the system from one crisis to another and their past

lives with them. Today, as the whole social structure of

I02

 

capitalism is ﬁlled with new tension and as American
imperialism seeks to solve its problems by becoming master
of the world, they are at their se1f—appointed task of helping
capitalism.

Without Principles

‘ In their activities within the union, they reflected this
degeneration, becoming people more and more without
principles, without faith in the working class, admirers of
the big corporations and their billions, which they regard
as omnipotent. They bow in awe before the top crust of
society while they grow contemptuous of those below in
the rank-and-ﬁle of society. They become lackeys of Big
Business, capitalist-minded bureaucrats, more concerned
with winning the applause of the employers and the insti-
tutions theycontrol than in servicing the workers, and they
have reduced unionism from a great class movement of the
oppressed workers aspiring to freedom to a business enter-
prise in which the main function of the-union oﬂicial is
that of keeping the workers in line and holding them back
from “radical” outbursts. Such subservience is bound to
inﬂuence officials personally and it does. William Z. Foster,
in his Misleaders of Labor, noted as early as 1927 that

there is hardly another industry in which there has been
so steady a stream of business agents graduating from«

unionism into business.
Most of the Dubinsky group belongs to or work with the

. Social-Democratic Federation, the Liberal Party, the So-

cialist Party and other Social—Democratic organizations.
Despite some differences, these are bound by a common

policy and cooperate in one way or another. Through.

these and subsidiary organizations, through the press which
they control, such as the Jewish Daily Forward, the New
Leader and, in part, the New York Post, through their

writers in various capitalist publications, through labor

103

 

leaders and professionals whom theypinﬂuence, the Social-
Democrats operate a chain of connections which they move
into common action against progressive causes.

Who Are the Social-Democrats?

To achieve leadership of thelabor movement, the Social-
Democrats today ceﬁter their attention upon the top
circles of both the A. F. of L. and the C. I. 0., form all

Q kinds of unprincipled blocs and build various committees

and organizations, such as the American Labor Confer-
ence for International Affairs, Jewish Labor Committee
and Italian Labor Council.

In this effort to expand their organizations and inﬂu-
ence, they receive the aid of the capitalists. In the past,
despite their energetic activities, Social-Democracy for
many reasons never won a dominant position in the United
States. Capitalism was able to rely on its direct and open
labor supporters. Things have changed and capitalism
needs their aid. New ways are essential to keep the workers
down——open violence on the one hand, and social dema-
gogy on the other. And in respect to the latter, the Social-
Democrats are past masters._

For if these erstwhile socialists have renounced their

'principles, that does not mean that they retain nothing

from the past. They have given up the substance of the
ﬁght for socialism but they still hold on to the form and
the phrase. They have been trained in talking to masses,

and radical masses at that, becoming experts in social

demagogy; and here they are of utmost service to reaction.

‘That is what makes the group so dangerous. A William
' Green is clumsy at attempting to conceal his loyalty and

subservience to capitalism. He is too hard—set and inﬂex-
ible. David Dubinsky and his group of Social-Democrats,
people who bounce around like rubber balls, can give u

' 104 ‘

 

 

or take up the phrase of socialism whenever it is advisable
to steer the movement of the workers into safe channels
and to help capitalism. They are adept at performing the
reactionary deed under the guise of the progressive phrase,
and like skilled actors adopt many radical disguises to fool
workingmen, especially those who have entered factories
only in recent years, or wh-ose political experience with
leaders and movements do not yet enable them fully to
detect the false from the true, and to judge people by their
actions and not alone by their words.

' Ardent Red-Baiters

It is this training and experience as Social—Democrats,
this desertion of working class principles and unrestrained
hostility to every solid democratic cause, that has made
them such ardent Red—baiters. Red—baiting is the favored
device of reaction to curb and wipe out democratic move-
ments and in this the Dubinsky group have become special-
ists. They are tlie most frenzied opponents of the Commu-
nist Party because that Party is the militant and consistent
advocates the end of capitalism. They not only oppose the
viewpoint of the Communist Party, which is natural where
political "groups differ, but in ﬂagrant violation of the
‘rights of minority political parties and of the principles
champion of working class struggle a.nd unﬂinchingly
of working class organization, they have sought to bring
pressure in government circles to outlaw the Communist
Party and its organ, the Daily Worker. We will cite only
one shameful incident: In 1940 in the midst of the reac-
tionary, anti-Soviet hysteria in which it shared, the Dubin-
sky group introduced a resolution at the 1940 convention
of the union, calling for an investigation of the Communist
Party by the infamous un—American and anti—labor Dies
Committee!

105

 

Hearst and Dubinsky

These leaders have made a practice of taking over ‘rene-
gades who are cast out of the Communist movement and
ofgiving jobs to weaklings who quit the Communist move-
ment when the going gets tough——at a price,.,0f course.
They seek to -bribe militant workers to give up their
principles, while persecuting those who remain faithful,

 

and in this sordid manner they have built up a machine‘

that is a watchdog for reaction. It is a venal machine which
proﬁts from keeping the factional ﬁres burning within
the union while outside it kindles division, keeping track
of every development ofprogressive united action of the
people and taking measures to break it up. They set few
boundaries in selecting the elements with whom they work,
joining with disruptive Trotskyites and ﬁnding words of
apology and understanding for such downright fascists as
Czarist Denikin.

Thus we see the true face of Social-Democracy today.
The record of the Dubinsky group shows;& it was the ﬁrst
in the postwar period to discourage strikes and, in effect,
advocate a no—strike policy. It was the ﬁrst to raise the Big

Business banner of “efficiency” which is nothing but speed-

up of the workers.

It was the ﬁrst to introduce mass expulsions in the
unions, is today one of the chief Red—baiting centers and
seeks to convert the unions into agencies of repression.

It was the ﬁrst to call for an Anglo—American bloc, as is
working unceasingl-y to break up Big Three unity and to
bring about a war against the Soviet Union, andifor that
reason acts as an imperialist tool, to destroy world labor
and democratic unity.

t It is the main foe of work stoppages, strikes and other
new weapons of American labor to combat the violent
assaults on its economic security and democratic rights.

It works against real independent political action, striv-

ing to build, not a broad anti—trust and anti-fascist third
party, but a narrow anti—Communist party that will be an
additional instrument of reaction.

Wherever these servants of reaction tread they leave
disruption in their wake. Is it any. wonder then that
William Randolph Hearst ran a biographical story of
David Dubinsky in his chain of papers as a model labor
leader?

Eugene V. Debs, the great socialist leader, one of the
founders of the American trade union movement, once
said that if ever he were praised by the capitalists, he would
search his conscience to discover what’ wrong he had com-
mitted against the working class. But Dubinsky welcomes

such praise as a sign of achievement, even if it comes from i

the most indecent ﬁgure in American public life——the
holder of an Iron Cross from Hitler. ‘

 

 

speed-up. The members of the union fought against this
policy but they could not alter it since they encountered
the most violent attacks from the leadership.

The Sigman-Dubinsky group at the time believed the
propaganda of Big Business which promised that expand-
ing production would bring about higher wages and
achieve eternal prosperity in the United States. But this
policy only helped to produce the worst economic crisis in
our history. Thus the policy of the leadership after the
ﬁrst World War completely bankrupted a growing and ex-
panding union. '

After 1933 the union recovered its position and grew in
strength. The American workers ousted the reactionary
Hoover and put in Roosevelt. Tvheysecured important re-
forms such as the right to organize. Thanks to the ﬁghting
spirit of the needle workers, kept alive by left-wing groups

in the shops right through the worst periods of the depres- V

sion, the workers did not allow the reforms to remain on
paper, but forced the garment manufacturers to carry them
out. Large numbers joined the union again.

Progressive Tide Sweeps Country

The union prospered further from the gigantic wave
of strikes and the ground-swell of organization in the mass
production industries—in auto, steel, electrical, packing-
house and others connected with the establishment of _the
C.I.O. The I.L.G.W.U. and all labor also proﬁted from
the. period of the peoples’ war and from the aggressive
ﬁghting front which was set up in our country to defeat
fascism. As a result union membership rose from 2,000,000
in 1932 to 14,000,000 today—an historic turn in the posi-
tion of, the labor movement.

In this period the I.L.G.W.U. leadership, under pressure
of the left-wing of the membership, of the progressive

XI. COMMUNISTS IN THE I.L.G.W.U.

We have, in passing, referred to the Communists
in the I.L.G.W.U. and labor movement generally. This
subject deserves fuller treatment if only to answer the irre-
sponsible lies about the Communists.”“

A quick glance over the past quarter of a century since
the founding of the Communist Party shows that the Com!
munists in the trade unions have been tireless workers

' to build and strengthen the unions and develop them as

honest, democratic, ﬁghting organizations. They tried to
unite the unions against the onslaughts of reaction after
the ﬁrst World War. They made efforts to get the A. F. of
L. oflicialdom to organize the unorganized, and when these
leaders refused to do so, they stimulated workers to form
independent unions. In the period of 1926-1933 the Com-
munists led big battles in textile, auto, coal and marine
and laid the basis for the great organizational and strik
movements of the past decade. ‘
Communists were the most powerful factor in the un-
employment movement and in the winning of unemploy-
ment insurance, in promoting the policy of independent
political action, and in raising the banner and aggressively
ﬁghting for the rights of the Negro people. They played a

*Many works have been published on the I.L.G.W.U., mostly from
the viewpoint of the Social-Democrats. They are in the: main devoted to
a gloriﬁcation of the Dubinsky group and a falsifyingof the position of
the Communists. The worst of these is the recent semi-official “history”
of the union, Taz'lor’s Progress, by Benjamin Stolberg. a work so slander-
ous and false as to draw the ire of several oﬂicials of the union. Joseph
Breslau, for example, in a special pamphlet, characterized it as “:1 cruel
andheartless caricature” in the style of a Pegler. A thorougligoing review
which refuted the falsehoods about the Communists was made by Rose
Wortis in the January 19.45 issue of Political Affairs.

108

 

 

memorable part in the ﬁght against fascism, ﬁrst signaliz-
ing its danger, called upon labor to establish a common
from against it, and pursued every possible avenue to
establish a broad coalition to defeat this vicious enemy.
Though President Roosevelt was essentially an up—holder
of capitalism who worked to reform it, the Communists
did not hesitate to support him in every step directed
against the trusts and reaction.

In the I.L.G.W.U., the Communists have carried for-
ward the best traditions of this union, whose founders were
inspired by the hope that the union would serve as a power-
ful lever to advance the labor and Socialist movement in
our country. Communists were among the first to initiate a
broad educational and cultural program in this union.
Today the union leadership refer to this feature as a sign
of progressivism of the I.L.C.\V.U. But they have robbed it
of its dynamic working class character and turned it into
an instrument for class collaboration. Communists have
vigorously and repeatedly defended the democratic rights
against the bureaucratic violations of the oﬂicialdom. They
fought for the right of the members democratically to elect
their leaders, for the freedom of all political opinions
within the organization, for proportional representation
on joint boards and for the elimination of the rotten
borough system of elections to the conventions.

The Communists have always been the most reliable —

ﬁghters for union standards against the sweat-shop tenden-
cies of the employers. They fought to eliminate subcon-
tracting, to establish security on the job, to maintain union
rates against the constant violation by jobbers and con-
tractors, against the recurring introduction of speed—up,
for the organization of the out-of-town shops, and for estab-
lishment of uniform rates, and for the organization of the
new and growing branches of the industry. In the struggles
for these demands the Communists, along with large num-
’ 109

 

 

 

bers of the rank-and—ﬁle‘ workers, were repeatedly arrested,

ﬁned and imprisoned for militant strike activity. The
names of many militant workers can be mentioned in con-

‘ nection with these stormy battles for the preservation of

union standards. But their spirit and determination was
best symbolized by the Communist, ]oseph»Boruchowitz.

During the years of internal struggle precipitated by
the high-handed action of the leadership in expelling a
number of locals in New York which had a majority be-
hind them, Communists never for a moment gave up the

C struggle to re-unite the union. This was one of the main

planks in the program of the Needle Trades Industrial
Union which was organized by the expelled locals. The
Needle Trades Industrial Union fought for union stan-
dards and kept unionism alive even in the worst_days of the
depression, and thus helped the garment workers to take
advantage of the up-swing which came after 1933. When
the workers once again entered the I.L.G.VV.U., the Corn-
munists and left-wingers rejoined and took an active part

in rebuilding and expanding the union winning impor_tant _

posts of leadership in many locals. It must be said, how-
ever, that this was done too slowly. Communists were not
quick enough to note that a change had taken place in

the country and that the workers were enrolling in the t

A. F. of L. again; that it was consequently necessary for the
left-wing to re—enter the I.L.G.W.U. without delay despite
the obstacles put in the way by Dubinsky so as to be in a
position to help establish real democracy instead of the
machine control which prevails at the present time.

For Unity in the I.L.G.W.U.

Today, Communists speak out straightforwardly to the
union membership and warn them against the growing

dangers of reaction and fascism that spring from the efforts

of American imperialism to establish world rule. They
110

 

 

 

warn that unless a militant stand is taken against the mo- T

nopolists and trusts and their drive to a new war, the labor
movement will be weakened and undermined. They com-
bat the false optimism of the union leadership that all
things are well in the union, and point out that recent
-gains will be lost by competition from the unorganized low
paid areas unless aggressive action is taken to organize the
unorganized as part of the unfolding union drive of the
labor movement. The Communists stress above all the
imperative need for unity.
Unity is the critical need of the I.L.G.W.U. as it is of
the labor movement. The ranks of this union have too
long been divided by artiﬁcial means. Above all, unity is

needed between Communists and Socialist workers in the

union for a forward-looking program of action. Through-
out Europe today, Communist and Socialist workers have
learned to work together against reaction and fascism.
They are determined not to repeat the division and dis-
unity which brought about a triumph of fascism. Their
joint efforts produced the united World Federation of
Trade Unions. In the United Sattes, too, such unity of
Communists and Socialist workers is absolutely vital.

In the I.L.G.W.U., agreement of all progressive workers
and leaders is possible and necessary around the urgent
economic and political issues of the day—but above all,
against a new imperialist war, the anti-labor offensive,
anti—Semitism and Negro discriminati,on—-inshort, unity in
the ﬁght to preserve democracy and prevent fascism.

It is said by some that Communists follow a contradic~
tory policy when they call for unity in the union, and at
the same time criticize the Dubinsky leadership. Commu-
nists do not criticize for the sake of criticism, nor do they
hesitate to support progressive policies even though they
come from sources with which they may differ politically.
But they criticize reactionary policies because these do not

1 11

 

'-membership for the ﬁrst time.

unite but divide the union. Criticism of such policies
alerts, informs and stimulates the membership and

‘strengthens the union. Surely a progressive Congressman

does not divide or weaken the nation when he attacks the
poisonous work of a reactionary like Rankin. Nor is the
union- hurt when the policies of Dubinsky are opposed.
In the years 1937 and 1938, whenthe leadership of the
union was withdrawing from the C.I.O. and preparing for
its return to the A. F. of L., the Communists out of a mis-
taken notion of unity at all cost failed vigorously to oppose
these back—tracking policies and to arouse the workers
against them. Such an error neither helped the union nor
unity. It only made it easier for Dubinsky to switch back
to the disastrous course that he follows today.

The Union Needs More Communists

The I.L.G.W.U. not only needs greater unity of Com-
munist, Social-Democratic and all advanced workers, it
needs more Communists as well. In many locals the pres-
ence of Communists would give voice to the desires of the
More Communists would
strengthen the union immensely in the people’s ﬁght
against the men of the trusts and banks. -More Commu-
nists in the union would advance to new heights the his-
toric struggle of labor for economic security, democracy
and peace. They would imbue the union with greater
vision and courage, and create once again the living spirit
of the pioneers of the union—those indomitable dress-
makers and cloakrnakers who built the union not alone
to defend wages and working conditions, but to help

. achieve a new social order. They were proud to inscribe

on their banners the glorious watchword, “Abolition of
the wage system.” ’ T L _

Yes, a greater number of Communists would serve as
a powerful factor to place the I.L.G.W.U. once more in
the front ranks of the labor movement.

tide that swept the country and the evident bankruptcy
of its previous policies, was compelled to adopt new tactics.

It yielded to the ardent desire of the masses for unity.

It readmitted—with restrictions——the militant members
whom it had driven out of the union. The leadership also
took part in the formation of the C.I.O."and in organizing
the American Labor Party, and gave support to the Roose-
velt ﬁght against the reactionary Liberty League that tried
to seize power in 1936-38. These acts obviously stimulated
the growth of the union. .
, But such progressive policies are not in force today.
On the contrary, the leadership has for some time deserted
these policies and returned to its old reactionary ways.
It is not at all strange that this should happen. The Du-
binsky group originally went along with the progressive
labor swing much againstits will. Within the leadership
there was bitter opposition to the new tactics. For example,
the vote in the General Executive Board on joining the
C.I.O.'when it was ﬁrst formed was 12 to 10. It can be said
that it was swept along by the advancing labor movement
and was obliged to follow or be isolated. The leading group
of the union never discarded its reactionary views and
policies. Even while going forward, it looked eagerly for
ways of turning back.

The Dubinsky group was basically fearful and hostile to
the new democratic labor movement that arose with the
C.I.O. and, at the ﬁrst opportunity, began to betray it.
This was shown by its withdrawal from the C.I.O. when
the latter changed from the Committee into the Congress

, of Industrial Organizations. It became more evident in

1938 when Dubinsky supported the Munich sell-out to
Hitler. In 1939 and 1940, he discarded his progressive
-cloak and joined with Hearst, Patterson and Big Business
reactionaries in a wild outcry for war on the Soviet Union.
The retreat was completed by re-affiliation to the A.F.L. In

this period of acute struggle other labor leaders, too, like
John L. Lewis, showed their true colorsand returned to
the reactionary fold. But David Dubinsky led the way.

During the recent war against fascism and since then,
Dubinsky has become an active agent for anti-Soviet in-
trigue and disruption, persistently working to undermine
the coalition of democratic states. Moreover, he has allied
himself with the ultra—reactionary elements. in the labor
movement and has joined forces with the political circles
of -Big ‘Business.

Inside the union Dubinsky has established a virtual dic-
tatorship. i

It has been evident for some time that the Dubinsky V

leadership is drifting ever farther to. the right and is re-
peating and multiplying the mistaken policies which its
reactionary predecessors adopted after the ﬁrst World War.
Yet this development has remained hidden in part, be-
cause of the improved economic conditions due to the
war and because of Dubinsky’s sly tactics and demagogy.
During the period of the war, also, the harmful policies
of Dubinsky have been more evident in the ﬁeld of politics
and world affairs. But such policies are bound to affect
the economic conditions as well—to undermine jobs, wages,
and working conditions. ‘As we shall see, they are already
threatening the hard-won gains of recent years.

II. THE NEW DRIVE AGAINST THE
LABOR MOVEMENT

I The I.L.G.W.U. today is confronted with several serious
problems. In common with all workers, its members
seek increased wages to meet the rising cost of living, the
assurance of steady employment, and postwar security.
In the pre-war years, seasons were short and yearly earn-
ings were scarcely enough to make ends meet. The_ average
annual earnings of dressmakers in 1939, according to_union
statistics, for all lines of dresses, was $1,034, or $19.88 per
week. Wages in the miscellaneous tradeswere at starvation
levels. Cotton garment workers averaged 39 cents an hour;
workers on corsets and allied products and outer knitwear
workers averaged 46 cents an hour; knit underwear work-
ers received only 41 cents an. hour. .
During the war, total earnings of garment workers ad-
vanced materially, especially for the higher-skilled workers.
Although basic rates rose little, workers beneﬁted from
the current shortage of labor and simpler styles. They
received most of their increased earnings, from overtime,
speed-up and steadier year-round employment.‘ This was
offset in large measure, however, by soaring living costs.
Moreover, the terriﬁc speed-up, the longer and harder
work, brought an enormous toll of illness, disability and
death which increased tremendously in the war years.
Proﬁts of manufacturers, jobbers and contractors, on
the other hand, were the highest in the history of the
industry. In the years 1939-42, the reported net proﬁts rose
about 900 per cent in coats and suits, 800 per cent in
dresses, 300 per cent in corsets and girdles, and 300 per cent
in silk and rayon underwear.
These proﬁts came not only from war prosperity and
'12

 

Increased output, but also from above-ceiling prices.

Manufacturers saved on labor costs, materials, substitu-

tion of inferior grades of fabrics, and other business fac-
tors. But prices were not correspondingly reduced. Em-
ployers were able to evade ceiling prices because of the
weak control by O.P.A. of this small-shop industry and
the indifference of a union leadership which was aware
of violations but did nothing about them._The union lead-
ership, on the contrary, worked in various ways with the
employers to increase prices. It is an open secret that the
effective resistance of the manufacturers to the production
of low-priced garments, insisted upon by the O.P.A., had
the support of the union oﬂicialdom. This attitude of
the union leadership sprang from the rotten theory held
by many union officials that higher prices redound to the
workers’ beneﬁt. -

This policy is, of course, not only shortsighted but false.
I-t amounts to collaborating with the manufacturers to
ﬂeece the consuming public. It shrinks their pay ‘envelopes,
reduces the market and ultimately increases unemploy-
ment in the trade. It intensiﬁes the very evils which re-
quire remedy in the garment industry and throughout
the country bringing little or nothing to the workers while
boosting the manufacturers’ proﬁts.

What are the conditions of the garment workers today?

What Labor Needs

Work remains relatively steady but unemployment is
beginning to increase. While a measure of prosperity will
be enjoyed for a short time by the industry because of ac-

cumulated consumer demand, unemployment will grow

because of over-expansion of the industry during the war

and other factors. At the same time the take-home pay

envelope is bound to grow thin. The garment workers, like

labor generally, need substantial wage increases. -They like-
- 13

  

wise need job security, guarantees of longer and fuller em-
ployment than in pre—war years-—at adequate wages——and
the continued strengthening of their union.

But such a program which labor looked forward to with
the war’s end is being blocked by Big Business. Big Business
has other aims. It seeks to undermine the living standards
and to weaken the power of organized labor, to reduce the
unions’ effectiveness by all kinds of crippling security and
penalty clauses in contracts and to shackle them with anti-
labor laws. This is all part of a program of American capi-
talist domination. Our industrialists, bloated with war
proﬁts, want to try their hand at world imperialist rule.
To that end they seek to curb democratic developments
in Europe and Asia and undermine the Soviet Union.
Fascism and reaction, defeated in the war, have not given
up hope of a restoration of power. On the contrary, they

are being encouraged by our billionaires. And the Bilbos ‘

and Rankins are feverishly spreading their poison and
working to bring the reactionaries to full power in the
state and national governments.

Fight or Surrender

The labor movement is thus given the choice, either of
ﬁghtingfor its economic and political life or of going
under in a new union-busting drive. It has chosen to ﬁght.

The ﬁrst round of the battle is just closing. In the
greatest strike movement‘ in the country’s history labor
defeated the union busters. It is raising wage levels 15
to 20 percent, increasing them well above the amounts
offered by the corporations.

What role has the garment union been playing in this .

gigantic battle? The leadership of the I.L.G.W.U. has
worked against the strike movement. It has supported the
sabotaging activities of the A. F. of L. leaders and, in addi-
tion, carried on undermining work of its own. Dubinsky

14

 

(U V‘ V‘

backed up the pro-business stand of Lewis and Green at the
Labor-Management Conference in November against
Philip Murray, who demanded that wa-ge increases be made
the central question of discussion. Wages are paramount!
But john L. Lewis and the A. F. of L. chieftains rejected
this and put forward the view that what the country needs
is the abolition of all government restrictions on “free en-
terprise” and the elimination of all price control——just what
the National Association of Manufacturers has been clam-
oring for. .
When the auto, steel and electrical strikes were under

. way, the Executive Council declared publicly that the

wage demands of the C.I.O. were “excessive.” It falsely
boasted of big gains by A. F. of L. workers without strikes.
It sought to discredit the strikes as “Communist-inspired,"
which was a stab in the back of the striking workers and a
clear invitation to the industrialists to use police violence
against the C.I.O. picket lines. Dubinsky, as a member of

the Council, took part in that act of treachery. Moreover, .
‘the I.L.G.W.U. leadership failed to contribute a penny

to the millions of steel and electrical strikers. The assist-
ance rendered to the General Motors workers ca_me under
strange conditions which we will discuss later.

Truman Strikebreaks

The strikes were met in Congress by a shrill hysteria
of the anti-union bloc. President Truman yielded to this
outcry and called upon Congress to pass fact-ﬁnding, cool-
ing-off legislation. He was denounced by the C.I.O. as
strike breaking. Even the A. F. of L. opposed this act. But
David Dubinsky, always one to meet reaction at least half-
way, went on record approving fact-ﬁnding boardswhile
opposing the cooling-off period: “Fact-ﬁnding bodies . . .
have been used with more or less success in other industries
outside the railways,” said the resolution of the I.L.G.W.U.

‘ 15 .

 
 

General Executive Board at the time. (justice, Jan. 1, 1946.)
y The same resolution a roved the “good intentions” of
 the President and foungpthat his only mistake was in not
consulting labor. “Had he done so,” said an editorial on
the subject in Iustice, December l5, 1945, “he would have
found that a proposal for setting up fact-ﬁnding bodies
unaccompanied by the 30-day waiting period would not
have earned such utter opposition from labor as is now
\ 1 being directed against hisdouble-headed plan.”

tion, thei) Dubinsky group counselled a hush-hush policy .
and, as usual, directed its attacks against the progressives. .-
It announced publicly that it would have nothing to do
with such tactics which it regarded as mere “Communist
hell-raising.” Max Danish, Dubinsky’s editor of Justice,

W wrote, in the usual Red-baiting vein, in the New Leader of (
3 ll February 8, 1946, that the proposed work stoppage was a I ,
i ll! “Quill-Curran maneuver to get the Communists into the
 larger limelight . . .” and that “these political strikes or S
—, i; stoppages . . . belong strictly to the category of‘tumult-rais- ,
l s ing and hell-raising.” Ofcourse, it is nothing of the kind. 1‘
 It is a form of pressure which labor is being forced to use ﬂ
. 4,‘ in order to stop the blitzkreig attacks of reaction. Failure 1'
in to use its economic power against the violent destruction U
H! of its rights will result in catastrophe. The activities of ii
l‘ the Dubinsky group, however, was not without success n

because the movement against the Case Bill was soon dis-
rupted and this vicious measure was rushed through the
House. ‘

But worst of all was the St. Louis agreement, negotiated
A by Vice-President Meyer Perlstein at the height of the
e ‘ strike movement. This agreement gave the garment work-
ers a small increase in wages, but at the same time granted

the employers the right to negotiate for wage reductions
when business conditions change. We must ask the gar-
ment workers—where, in any union contract, have they
seen such concessions to the employers? Labor’ has al-
ways insisted on the right, in contracts, to re-open wage
questions in order to keep step with the rising cost of
living. Employers have always resisted this, because they
wish to pay as little for labor as possible and to make each
advance of the workers costly and painful. - But here
the I.L.G.W.U. leadership has proclaimed a new principle
—the right of the employer to degrade workers’ conditions.
The I.L.G.W.U. has often been proud of setting new stand-
ards for labor. In this case every member -must blush for

shame that his union has broken ground for impoverishing
and weakening labor.

A Stab in the Back

But more important, the leadership agreed in the same
contract ‘that the employer can impose a line upon a
worker who takes part in a wildcat strike.

Now, it is a well-known fact that there are few wildcat
strikes in garment shops. But the union leadership read-
ily inserted the very clause which Ford, du Pont, and other
magnates were demanding in the auto industry against the
ﬁerce resistance of the workers. The'leadership. of the
I.L.G.W.U. thus has the dubious honor of being the ﬁrst
to include in contracts what Big Business has been demand-
ing as part of its union wrecking offensive. This too was
nothing less than a stab in the back of millions of workers.

Of course, this disruptive policy also adversely affected
the garment workers who were negotiating a 20 per cent
wage increase. One would think that the leadership
would take full advantage of the strike wave vigorously to
press their own demands. This did not necessitate a strike
call. By energetically supporting the strikes, by manifest-

I7 4

ing through mass meetings and in other ways, that they
were determined to win their full demands, they would
have helped themselves as well as the general movement.
The Dubinsky leadership did not follow such -a militant
policy. It limited its ﬁght merely to the hearings before the
arbitrators, without calling for any supporting action by
the workers. In consequence the cloakmakers received
increases of only $2 to $5 per week, amounting to 71/2 per
cent, plus a health and vacation fund. The 80,000 dress-
makers of New York received wage increases ranging
from $3 to $6 per week which, according to oﬂicial union
statements, amount to an increase averaging 8.9 per cent.
Actually the bulk of them received only a 7 per cent raise
in wages. This is well under the 20 per cent demanded by
the union and is in sharp contrast to the 15-20 per cent
won by the striking C.I.O. unions. Despite the tactics
of the oﬂicials, it was a gain-—the result of themilitant wage
movement in the country. But it was by no means a sulﬁ-
cient increase, especially for the lower-paid workers.
Moreover, despite the prolonged negotiations lasting
more than four months, the award gave the cloakmakers

< only 6 weeks retroactive pay while the dressmakers got

nothing——although retroactive pay is generally granted,
especially in cases of prolonged negotiations. In fact, it is
an accepted procedure in collective bargaining negotia-
tions as a condition for avoiding strikes. ..

Vice-President Julius Hochman is quoted, in an editorial
in Justice of March 15, as saying that “the members of
our union may not be entirely satisﬁed with the outcome
of the arbitration but they are proud that a wage dispute
of this magnitude has been disposed of through the orderly
processes ‘of collective bargaining.” (Emphasis mine-
W.W.)

A Poor Compromise

VV e will not go into this big talk about the pride of the
18

 

ute
trly

the

membership in the system of arbitration. The simple ques-
tions remains: Why are the members “not entirely satis-
ﬁed” with the award? Is it because they realize that in
arbitration, as in life, you can't get everything you want,
as the editorial states? No, the membership is “not en-
tirely satisﬁed” with the award because it considers that it
was possible and necessary to secure better terms even by
“orderly collective bargaining” procedure and that the
leadership failed to do so.

It was surely necessary! The above editorial states
that the cost of living has gone up 35 per cent since 1941..
This is false. It has risen 50-60 per cent and continues-
to mount daily.

It was also possible to have won better terms. Con-
sidering the strength of the union, the huge proﬁts of the
manufacturers, the militancy of the workers, the strike
movement in the country and the important fact that the
needle trades industry (unlike the automobile or electrical
industries) is working at top levels, it was possible even
without a strike to have gained greater wage increases,
retroactive for all workers to the date of opening negotia-
trons.

Why was it not achieved?

No Strike at Any Cost

It was not achieved because the leadership did not carry
out a ﬁghting policy. It wanted to avoid a struggle at all
costs and to demonstrate that “Dubinsky’s union," unlike
the C.I.O., is “reasonable" and “conciliatory” and does not
have to engage in strike struggles to win its demands. At
the hearing on the demands of the dressmakers, Julius

Hochman boasted “Our industry is not going to be tied

up; our workers are not going to go out on strike” Uustice,
March 1, 1946), sneering at the strikes in the mass pro-
duction industries. ‘ A
The employers and the arbitrators knew this and that,

too, affected the nature of _the award. Moreover, this ser-
vile attitude of the oﬂicials is bound to encourage the em-
ployers to juggle piece rates and thereby negate the pay
increases—a process already under way in many shops.

This attitude is in marked contrast with Dubinsky’s
stand during the war. At that time the Dubinsky group
defended Lewis in his strike ‘threats and, when accused
of supporting strikes in wartime, justice indignantly ap-
pealed to the sanctity of the strike weapon and the effec-
tiveness of a mere threat’ in achieving demands. That was
during the people’s war when strikes and strike threats
were inappropriate and hurt labor. Now, when strike
tactics are appropriate and necessary, it forgets these brave
words and the traditional methods of struggle, and extols
the line of appeasement. Anything to serve the masters!

The fact is that appeasement, in politics or economics.
does not pay, especially today. Strikes are not called
lightly. Every practical organizer carefully weighs the
situation before proposing strike action. To belittle and
oppose strikes, as the Dubinsky group is now doing, and to
frighten the workers with talk of their terrible conse-
quences when the big corporations are out to smash the
unions is to play their game. ’

The Dubinsky oﬂicialdom denies such aims on the part
of big capital. During the recent strikes it tried hard to
create the impression that the corporations have at last
reconciled themselves to the existence of labor unions. At
the outset of that strike, Justice foolishly wrote that the
General Motors Corporation is merely trying to “humble"
the U.A.W. (]ustice, December 1, 1945.)

How kind a word for the intentions of the fascist-minded —

du Pont Corporation which bled the union in a 113-day
strike. -

as to the nature of the Big Business attack. It wrote
“whether or not we accept the theory that big business
has formed a conspiracy to crush the unions . . . there is

' no doubt that organized industry is making a concerted

effort at this hour to halt organized labor.” (Emphasis
mine—W.W.) Was this anti-union drive merely_a disputed
theory and not a self-evident fact? And merely to halt,
not to crush labor? Why, then, their concerted action;
were the poor industrialists perhaps the victims of a labor
conspiracy? Who then refused collective bargaining, re-
stored police violence and injunctions and railroaded the
Case Bill through the House? The unions? How little
the Dubinsky group understood (or rather preferred to
understand) the situation is revealed by their forecast that
“at this moment, picket line violence on a large scale is not
foreseeable." (Justice, February 1, 1946.) A remarkable
prophecy, as anyone can see, particularly the strikers of

Philadelphia, Bloomﬁeld and Stamford!

The workers knew better. That is why they rejected the
counsel of the $15,000. and $25,000 a year labor chiefs who
told them to be “reasonable” and not strike for a matter
of a few dollars. ' They fully grasped the fact that they must
ﬁght the union-busting stand of the corporations or_ be
thrown back to the pre-war years of low living standards,
job insecurity, inevitable crises and unemployment;. that
the manufacturers, bent on retaining their high war prof-
its, wanted to make the workers carry the burdens of
reconversion. The auto and steel workers know from past
experience that proﬁt-greedy capitalism wants, at all times,
to keep wages low and, if unchecked, pitilessly drives con-
ditions down to unbearable sweat-shop levels, to killing
speed-up and hunger wages. Don't the needle trades
workers _know that as well!

That is why the workers of the big production industries
have made such great sacriﬁces, holding out stubbornly
for weeks against the efforts to lessen union safeguards

21

to surrender.

 

and to win substantial wage increases.
And they proved right!

Hard Battle Ahead

Despite the sabotaging work of the A. F. of L. leaders,
the steel union was not weakened, but strengthened by its
strike. The same for the electrical and other striking
C.I.O. and A. F. of L. unions. Wage levels are new higher
than they would otherwise have been if the offer of the cor-
porations had been accepted without struggle. The labor
movement, including the garment workers, benefited
by the militant battles. American labor has so far avoided
the setback which it suffered after the ﬁrst World War.
The ﬁghting policy of progressive A. F. of L. and C.I.O.
leaders was fully justiﬁed.

In contrast, how pitiable is the policy of the I.L.G.W.U.
leadership in meeting the new postwar problems.

But the struggle is by no means over. The trusts have
succeeded, with the help of the Truman Administration,
in raising prices which will cancel part of the gains and
necessitate further battles. Anti-labor laws are being
pressed, again with the help of the Truman Administra-
tion, which opened wide the gates to a ﬂood of reactionary
legislation. There is no doubt that if the workers are to
maintain their hard-won economic and political gains
and advance further, they will have to put forth the most
militant efforts, ﬁghting spirit and unity on both the

political and economic fronts. To win they will have to

defeat the Dubinsky policy in the labor movement.

It is Munichism on the labor front; the old Dubinsky
attitude coming to light again. Where militancy is re-
quired, he holds back; where an advance is needed, he re—
treats; where the monopolists attack, he appeases; in times
of struggle he is the apostle of class peace and leads the way

111. ORGANIZE THE UNORGANIZED on
LOSE our

The garment workers are faced with special problems
peculiar to the industry. These are the growth of new
plants in low paid areas, the existence of a large number
of unorganized shops in the East, West and South, the in-
tensiﬁcation of the chain store and mail order evil, and
the extension of section work with its lower rates of pay.

The General Executive Board ofthe union wrote with ,

some alarm about these developments in its 1944 report
to the Boston Convention. .It pointed out that “many
new plants are located in the deep South where unionism
is weak and labor standards are traditionally low. Coupled
with the normal over-capacity of the women's garment in-
dustry, these new plants threaten a reversion to the disas-
trous forms of competition which characterized our indus-
try before our union was able to make itself felt as a
stabilizing force.”

Discussing the chain-store problem, the report said:
“The role of the chain store and mail order house as the
virtual employer in important sections of the women's gar-
ment industry has, since the last convention of the Inter-
national in 1940‘, been strengthened?’

Again the ’Out-of-Town Problem

At its ﬁrst postwar meeting in Miami, the General ’

Executive Board of the union placed the number of unor-
ganized workers at between 75,00 and 100,000. “Some of
them,” according to the report of the meeting in Iustice
(January 1, 1946), are “in growing markets which may
eventually develop destructive competition in the organ-

ized production centers. In Los Angeles alone it is believed
not less than 15,000 non-union workers are engaged in un-
organized dress and sportswear shops.” ~

Other reports, such as that of D. Gingold, head of the
Cotton Garment Department (Justice, October 15, 1945).
tell of “the mushroom growth, of garment plants in Penn-
sylvania which has become one of the nation's outstand-

ing garment producing areas.” Pennsylvania was de-
scribed as “a depressed area tearing down labor stand-
ards.” '

Summing up these reports, it is clear that the union is
confronted with a serious and growing “out-of-town” prob-
lem of national proportions which has become aggravated
during the war years.

What has the union leadership done about these prob-
lems, particularly in the recent years of the war, so favor-
able for organization? With regard to the ‘chain store
problem, the General Executive Board, in 1944, stated

that the New York Cloakmakers Board is again considering L

a campaign to deal with the evil.

But nothing has yet been done.

Practical steps had been taken to organize the chain
stores in 1937 when a committee, headed by Joseph Breslau
and known as the Management Committee, temporarily
directed the New York joint Board. At that time a plan
to organize the chain stores, proposed by J. Borochowitz
and pushed by suchcloakmaker leaders as Joseph Breslau
and Isidore Sorkin, achieved some success in bringing
the Lerner Shops under union agreement. But soon there-
after, when Israel Feinberg assumed the leadership of the
Joint Board, the campaign was stopped. Eight years have
now passed and no action has been taken.

The Grand Hochman Plan

tive Board, came forward with a grand scheme to deal with
the growing “out-of-town” problem. This is called “In-
dustry planning Through Collective Bargaining,” which,
to the delight of the General Executive Board, was hailed
by the New York Herald Tribune as a “new concept of
unionism.” '

What is this “industry planning” which has won the
praise of_ the capitalist press? It consists, according to
Julius Hochman-, its author, of a plan to (a) establish New

— York as the world’s fashion center, (b) to organize the New

York Dress Institute to popularize a New York fashion
label for which the union contributes $100,000 (half of
which, strangely enough, has already been taken from the

_ "Labor Solidarity Fund”), and (c) to promote eﬂiciency in

the industry, for which the union has established a union-
management engineering department to advise employers
how to improve production. It also conducts propaganda

' for eﬂiciency among the workers. “Dress Experts Elﬁ-

cieney Lectures” reads a Justice headline April 1, 1946.
"Dress manufacturers and union oﬁicers . . . and old—timers
coming straight from their machines sitside "by side at
the weekly lecture series . . . on eﬁiciency factory man-
agement.”

But how will this grand “industry planning” scheme
check the trend away from the big cities to smaller commu-
nities and solve the “out-of-town” issue? .Making New
York instead of Paris the fashion center——if it is accom-
plished—may cause some increase of work in the ﬁeld of

' higher-priced garments. So much to the good. But will

this check the well marked tendency of the industry to
move away from New York to areas of lower labor costs?
When the trend in recent years (offset only during the
war years) has been to lower priced garments due to the in-
troduction of cotton and rayon fabrics, simpler styles and
lower purchasing power of the consumers, will boosting
efficiency in New York actually maintain the monopoly

25

 

 

 

 

trial production.

of the New York market? VV ill not other centers do like-
wise in the restless competition of business, especially
where they have the advantage of section work at low
wages‘, integrated units and other high speed methods?

Efficiency was the answer given to the out—0f-town prob-
lem in the industry in the period from 1920 to 1926 by the
garment union, but all the union accomplished was to
speed up the workers, degrade conditions to sweatshop
levels while increasing unemployment. And that is what it
will come to now.

Already “eﬂiciency” is accounting for increased indus-
Impartial Chairman Uviller remarks
(justice, March 15, 1946) that “the increase [in produc-
tion] was due to greater employment and greater pro-
ductivity per worker.” He estimates the increase in work-
er productivity at 50 per cent.

Hochman himself says (Justice, March 1, 1946): “The

really remarkable thing . . . is that the unprecedented de-
mand for dresses was met . . . with fewer workers than we
had in 1940 . . . in 1940, industry employed 85,439; in

1945, 72,965, a reduction of 15 per cent.” Here, too, we
see in part the effects of intense labor and speed-up.

N o wonder the Reader’s Digest honors this contribution
of the I.L.G.VV.U.’s “efﬁciency” schemes. It recently (April,
1946) featured a four—page article by Eugene Lyons re-
printed from the socialist New Leader, highlighting this
plan and describing the union as one whose goal is the
creation of “an effective working‘ partnership between or-
ganized labor and organized management.”

Partners in‘ Speed-Up

Partnership for what? For increased “efficiency!”

A union can, of course, set up departments to insure
that piece rates are adequate, and, in this and other ways,
safeguard the workers against speed-up. ~ But where it

some manufacturers in competition with others,‘ a union
will unavoidably be reduced to an appendage of the em-
ployer's production schemes, and invariably at the ex-
pense of wages. Big Business is trying to do this today.
This is the meaning of their cry for increased production.
And up front marches Hochman and Dubinsky with the
banner of “efficiency.” A

Hochman, in his 1944 convention report, patted himself
on the back, saying that this is “the ﬁrst time that a union
ever really concerned itself with . . . production matters
as part of collective bargaining.” He either has a short

memory or is kidding the membership. This policy of

“-engineering and eﬂiciency” by labor was the main tactic
of the whole A. F. of L. and I.1sG.W.U. leadership after
the ﬁrst World War. It was known in the labor move-
ment at the time as “New Wage Plan” and the “Higher
Strategy of Labor”—for example, the A. F. of L. 1925 con-
vention resolution which called for increased production
as a means of obtaining higher wages, urged upon manage-
ment “the elimination of wastes in production in order
that selling prices may be lower and wages higher.”
The I.L.G.W.U leadership in that same period became
notorious for agreements to boost, production and eﬂi-
ciency. Among the worst of such agreements was the one
signed June, 1921, by Israel Feinberg with the New York

Cloakmaker Manufacturers to “bring up the productivity

of the workers to a point fair and proper to both sides.”
_ Small wonder that such an agreement was held secret
and entitled “Supplemental Agreement.”

Build Real Unions Out-of-Town

Hochman’s scheme is in reality a substitute for practical
measures to solve the very real problem of the growing
shift of the industry away from New York; the shift occurs
chieﬂy because the employers are able to pay less and

speed up the workers more in other areas. It is then a
question of raising the pay and improving the conditions

"of the out-of-town areas by means of organization, educa-

tion and struggle. But during the war years the leader-
ship engaged in little organizational work. » It passed up
splendid years for organizing the unorganized. . Its mem-
bership increase came chieﬂy from the inﬂux of new work-
ers into organized shops.

What is obviously needed, in the first place, is a full
scale campaign of organization and union building in all
branches of women’s apparel, embracing not only the new
centers of the‘West, Middle West and South, but also the
Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, New Jersey and Connecticut
areas which have been growing at a great pace at‘ the ex-
pense of New York. What is ‘also essential is a cam-
paign to bring the chainstores and mail order houses, es-
pecially Sears Roebuck, Montgomery Ward and J. C.
Penny, under union agreements. '

No more favorable time than the present can be de-
sired for this task, with all labor in motion. With the re-
cent victories in the big strike movement, and with mil-
lions stirring, it should be possible to organize the unorgan-
ized, particularly if the union will use this splendid oppor-
tunity to bring to the workers in the South and West
the consciousness that it ﬁghts for improved wages and con-
ditions. ' The General Executive Board has announced
that a campaign is to be started to organize the unorgan-
ized and that 25 organizers are being added for this pur-
pose. But it will be impossible to organize the company
towns of the South and Southwest if the union fails to link
up its organizational campaign with the C.I.O. as well as
the A. F. _of L., if it refrains from militancy, if its organ-
izers are not imbued with the spirit of struggle.

Nor can the campaign achieve enduring success if it is
not accompanied simultaneously by real union building
in these out-of-town areas. During the war many thou-

sands of members were added to the union rolls. But were
these members brought into locals, educated in unionism,
allowed to develop initiative, responsibility and authority
to deal with the boss in the settling of prices? A resolution
introduced to the 1944 conventionby nine locals of out-of-
town cloakmakers, comprising the states" of ‘New Jersey,
Connecticut and upstate New - York describe the out-of-
town locals “as existing in name only” and called for local
autonomy. (25th I.L.G.W.U. Convention Resolution, No.
81.) According to this resolution the locals “were super-
vised and managed by the Out-of-Town Department.”

In many cases the union representative collected the
dues like a real estate agent collecting rent. Such locals
are bound to collapse at the ﬁrst sign of pressure from the
boss. Without real solid locals it is impossible to avoid
chiseling and violations of agreements which in effect
nullify the results of organization.

Enforce Uniform Standards

But the solution of the out-of-town problem also re
quires recognition of the fact that wide differences in wages
and other conditions exist today among the various pro-
duction centers——in many cases even among the contractors
working for the same jobbers on like work. The
I.L.G.W.U. leadership has been making much of over-
lapping and jurisdictional issues with the Amalgamated
Clothing Workers of America with regard to the produc-
tion of women's garments and there are signs that this may
develop into a harmful struggle which should by all
means be avoided.

But would not the union do well to overcome compe-
tition in its own ranks arising from the lack of uniform
national standards? It is a fact, which has been stressed
within the union, that unequal wage scales, hours and
conditions exist in the various centers producing like work

29 »

and competing for‘ the same "national market. Obviously
this tends to create a struggle for work and jobs at the ex-
pense of wages and conditions. The working out and en-
forcement of uniform national standards seems to be the
answer here. Since this inequality of rates often applies
to shops working for the same jobber, it also appears neces-
sary that measures be taken to see that the same scales
be set and realized for like work if the struggle for the
“bundle" is to be avoided, and if the out—of-town "prob-
lem is to be effectively "reduced.

IV. DUBINSKY AND DISUNITY

Central to the tasks of labor in the present period is the
ending of the warfare within the trade union movement
and the establishment of the utmost unity. Disunity is
disruptive and crippling at any time. It is suicidal if it
continues in the postwar period. The workers themselves
know this instinctively; they demonstrated the power of
unity in the recent strike battles with stirring examples
of solidarity.

But the top leadership of the A. F. of L. blocks and dis-
rupts unity. They still refuse to recognize the C.I.O. as a
new virile and powerful labor movement, and regard it
as a “split off” from the one and only “House of Labor”
to which it is invited to return (and be chopped up, of
course, in the grinder of craft unionism). They still think
in terms of the year 1934 and want to break up the C.I.O.,
utilizing the postwar diﬂiculties to achieve their end. Dur-
ing the recent strikes they speculated and hoped that the
C.I.O. would be crippled or curbed by the industrialists
whom they helped by their strikebreaking activities. They
failed, but they continue their disruption, trying especially
to tear the C.I.O. apart from within.

It is in this malevolent game of internal disruption that
john L. Lewis and David Dubinsky, both newly elected
members of the Executive Council of the A. F. of L., are
playing leading roles. In fact, the danger of continued
disunity and of further disruption comes not only from the
old clique of Wall, Hutcheson and Green, but mainly from
these two “prodigals,” who are now back in the fold of
the A. F. of L. and are working in closest cooperation
with the “old gang.” Making use of their factional con-
i 31

 

nections inside the C.I.O.,.Lewis and Dubinsky are the

spearheads of the conspiracy to undermine and weaken
the C.I.O. We will discuss the menace of Lewis later.
Let us now consider the role being played by Dubinsky.

Relief '2: la Hoover

The most recent example of this disruptive work has
come to light in connection with the factional ﬁght inside
the United Automobile Workers Union—the biggest affili-
ate of the C.I.O. It was charged at the recent convention
of that union that an I.L.G.W.U. fund raised for the Gen-
eral Motors strike was being used by Dubinsky for po-
litical purposes—as a kind of “Hoover relief.” The sub-
stance of the charges made by R. J. Thomas, former presi-
dent of the union, was that under the guise of solidarity,
Dubinsky was working to inﬂuence the outcome of the
elections within that union and was encouraging and aid-
ing anti-Murray and anti-C.I.O. sentiment around Walter
P. Reuther, a Social-Democrat, who works and thinks along-

’ the same ‘lines as Dubinsky.

The accusation is a serious one, but it is supported by
a number of undeniable facts and circumstances.

It is a fact that the I.L.G.W.U. did not contribute a
penny to the relief of the million or more striking steel
and electrical workers in the recent strike wave. It callous-
ly ignored the 70,000 Westinghouse workers who fought
for 116 days against the savage police violence and injunc-
tions. It shunned the 8,000 Western Union strikers, ﬁght-
ing a ﬁerce battle against a giant corporation, almost at
the door of Dubinsky’s oﬂice in the heart of the needle in-
dustry. But it did raise-a fund for the General Motors
strike. ‘

Contrary to the needs of the strikers and the spirit of .

solidarity, however, the I.L.G_.W.U. leadership did not
come at once to the aid of the General Motors workers,
32 ~

 

1C

eel

or in its critical stage, but delayed its contribution until the

last days of the battle. This will be seen from the follow- .

ing facts: _ 0

The General Executive Board of the I.L.G.W.U. closed
its year-end meeting in Miami without contributing a cent
or making an appeal for the G.M. strike, then in its sixth
week. It issued an appeal only in the tenth week of the
strike after the rank-and-ﬁle, out of a true sense of soli-
darity, were passing around collection cans in the shops.
Although its appeal for the G.M. strike in Justice of Feb-
ruary 1, urged that “Quick Help Counts Double in Crises,”
the leadership of the union did not dip into its multi-
million-dollar treasury to give quick aid but called on the
members to put in several hours relief work, and delayed
its donation until February 25, the 96th day of the strike,
and on the eve of the U.A.W.U. convention.

Strangely enough, it turned over only $90,000 of a much
larger fund and withheld the balance. According to Leon-
ard Lyons in the New York Post of March 30, 1946, “the
I.L.G.W.U. had raised $230,000 to help the General Mo-
tors strikers: $90,000—was contributed and the balance was
about to be contributed. When Thomas delivered his at-
tack,” continues Lyons, “the $140,000 donation was can-
celled.” Most likely, that is the sum collected, since Jus-
tice of February 1 stated that the union’s aim was a fund
of $250,000 and it is_known that the members contributed
generously. In fact, Israel Feinberg, stung by the exposure,
admittedat a meeting of the cloakmakers’ shop chairmen
and joint Executive Board members on May 8 that the en-
tirefund had not been distributed. He pleaded in defense
that no union had made application for relief and that it
was not the policy of the I.L.G.W.U. to go shopping for
needy workers. Apart from the bureaucratic mind which
this statement reveals (he had only to look in the papers
to know which workers were in need of relief) it evaded the
issue. The issue is: why was not the full sum, speciﬁcally

33

 

collected for General Motors workers, turned over while
the strike was in progress? Why the maneuvering with
strike funds when quick help truly counts double in so
great a battle?

Dubinsky to Reuther

It is also a fact that Dubinsky helped to build up the
myth that Reuther was a great labor leader, going out of
his way to praise him for his “ﬁne leadership and deter-
mination” in the strike (justice, March 15, 1946). It is
known, however, that the strike was badly led. It was
started too early and settled too late and not on the best
terms because ‘of Reuther’s irresponsible, factional .and
tactically false policies. -Soon after the contribution by the
I.L.G.W.U., the Reuther faction which had been sniping
at Murray became bolder and more open in its attacks,
trying to blame the C.I.O. leadership for the strike
results.

These are the grounds which amply support the charge
that Dubinsky was using relief funds for the purpose of
splitting the big auto union. Of course, he has denied
the accusation, claiming that his aid was motivated solely
by considerations of solidarity. ’ But it will be recalled that
he denied a similar accusation once before. It is, however,
well known today that he secretly meddled in the internal
affairs of the U.A.W. in 1938. , At that time Dubinsky
made a loan of $25,000 to Homer Martin, then U.A.W.
president, who together with Dubinsky’s ﬁfth column in
the U.A.W.——the Lovestone group—was trying to break it

away from the C.I.O. This attempt failed when Martin ’

was kicked out of that union and was soon afterward ex-
posed as a Ford agent who was also working with Coughlin.

The misuse by the I.L.G.W.U. officials of the so-called
“solidarity fund” of the union is so crass and brazen and
practiced on so large a scale that we will devote a special
chapter laterto this scandal. ‘

“.We_ are frankly and utterly happy at the election of
Walter P. Reuther,” writes Justice editorially on April 1.

They have good cause to be for they now have in Walter
P. Reuther and the presidency of the U.A.W. a strong
base from which to operate more effectively to poison and
disintegrate the C.I.O. from within and put over their
reactionary policies. The U.A.W. Convention is a sharp
warning that the reactionary Social-Democratic labor lead-
ers are a growing menace to the unity and progress of the
entire labor movement.

This exposure of Dubinsky’s maneuvers in regard to the
C.I.O. does not reveal something entirely new. It only
highlights a development which has been apparent since he
began his retreat back to the A. F. of L. Dubinsky has
tried to hide his duplicity and has posed at times as a critic
of the A. F. of L. oflicialdom and even as a friend of
unity and peace with the C.I.O. Except for a brief period,
the record proves otherwise. Let us look at that record:

In 1935 Dubinsky joined the initial group that formed
the Committee for Industrial Organizations. He went in
hesitatingly, and did not stay long. When the A. F. of L.
chiefs expelled the Committee, Dubinsky did not go along
to organize the C.I.O. After standing apart for a while,
the I.L.G.W.U.. re-affiliated with the A. F. of L. in 1940.

But Dubinsky can hardly do anything straightforwardly
and honestly, in spite of the pose he assumes. He must
cover up the retreat—-or rather surrender—and even make
it seem a fresh advance. He announced that he was re-
turning to reform the A. F. of L. How did Dubinsky
reform it?

How Dubinsky Reformed the A. F. of L.

At the A. F. of L. Convention in 1944, the A. F. of L.
chiefs made a full scale attack on President Roosevelt.

They denounced the administration for allegedly inter-
35

 

fering with the unions, spoke out for the unrestricted op-
eration of “free enterprise" in the style of the National
Association of Manufacturers, sneered at the President's
program of 60 million jobs, inferred that he was partial
to the C.I.O. and responsible for labor’s split. They not
only refused to endorse his candidacy for the Presidency
but even failed to~acknow1edge' Roosevelt's telegram of

greeting tothe convention. And to all this Dubinsky,
who paraded as a staunch Roosevelt adherent, not only
kept silent but lent an applauding hand.

When Matthew Woll deleted that part of a resolution
declaring anti-Semitism a crime, the Dubinskyites again
maintained a cowardly silence. The extent to which the
Dubinskyites have gone in abandoning even a pretense
of progressivism was shown in the debate on the Negro
question. In the 19.43 A. F. of L. Convention, A. Philip
Randolph, head of the Pullman Porters’ Union, de-
nounced the Jim Crow policy which is widespread in the
‘A. F. of L. ‘He pointed out that some unions barred
Negroes in their constitutions and others placed them in
“auxiliary unions.” He named names and presented facts.
Of course, many of the union leaders whotwere mentioned
rose to defend their stand. Some denied the charges.
others dodged and some answered with sneering and con-
temptible Negro-baiting. But the I .L.G.W.U .'delegat.ion,
which represented many thousands of Negroes and has re—
peatedly gone on record against Jim Crow, took no part
in the debate and said nothing.

Stooge for Negro-Baiters

At the following convention in 1944, Randolph re-
peated. the charge. This time the I.L.G.W.U. delegates
did not abstain from the debate.’ They took a positive
stand. Joseph Tuvim of the I.L.G.W.U. spoke-,—not in

support of Randolph, but on the side of the Jim Crow
leaders. He pleaded for “understanding” and “education”
and “patience”—the old plea of every apologistof Negro
discrimination when faced with a speciﬁc proposal for ac-
tion. Of course, such treachery, coming from a delegate
of the Dubinsky group withwhom Randolph works close-
ly, gladdened the hearts of the N egro-baiters. It would
seem that this would be a striking lesson as to the unrelia-
bility of the _Dubinsky clique but -unfortunately Randolph

has failed to learn for he remains a political associate and -

still follows Dubinsky’s general policies.

At the time of his entrance into the A. F. of L., Dubin-
sky V introduced an anti-racketeering resolution in the A.
F. of L. It looked like the beginning of a crusade. But
it did not last long. It was only a cover-up for his back-
sliding. One bar-room fracas with Joe Fay, racketeering
head of the Operating Engineers, and the campaign ended.
When the rank-and-ﬁle longshoremen recently revolted
against Czar Ryan, goon-squad head of the dockers union,
they were denounced by judge jonah Goldstein, Dubin-
sky’s candidate for Mayor, as “communists" while the
I.L.G.W.U. delegates to the New York Central Trades and
Labor Council of the A. F. of L. rushed to the defense of
the Ryan gang against the rank-and-ﬁle workers. '

Inside the A. F. “of L., Dubinsky joined with the ex-
treme tip of the reactionary wing of the A. F." of L. The
I.L.G.W.U. always regarded these labor lieutenants of capi-
tal with utter contempt, but now its leadership is in a
working alliance with them, sharing leadership of the A.
F. of L.-controlled organizations and helping one another
out in their specialties of ‘disruption. And when Matthew
Woll, for a quarter of a century, the lackey of the manu-
facturem on the A. F. of L. Executive Council, came" to
the 1944 Boston Convention, the Dubinskyites bowed
to the ground in indecent adulation.

ABOUT  AUTHOR

William Weinstone, the author of this booklet, grew
up in the_ concentrated needle trades community of

Brownsville, in Brooklyn, New _York, where a profound‘

socialist consciousness and militant tradition of working
class struggle had- already developed among the cloak-
makers and dressmakers who were his friends and neigh-
bors in the years preceding the outbreak of the ﬁrst World
War. It was there that his own socialist inspiration and
education began. In the years following World War I
he actively helped their struggles and spoke at their strike
meetings, particularly in the 1920's

- It was with this background that the author ﬁrst joined
the Socialist Party in 1916 and later became one of the
founders and charter members of the Communist Party in
the United States. His activities as a Communist organ-
izer in New York, New Jersey and Michigan, brought him
in close contact with trade union workers in many other
industries—furriers, textile workers, auto workers. He
aided in the drive to organize the unorganized auto work-
ers and participated in the militant strike struggles in
Detroit in the years between 1934 and 1937, which led to
the founding of the United Auto Workers Union, C.I.O.,
now one million strong. His account of these struggles
and their lessons is incorporated in a pamphlet, The Great
Sit-Down Strike.

In recent years, William Weinstone has been engaged
mainly in educational activities. Formerly Director of the
Workers School, in New York, he is at present New York
State Educational Director of the Communist Party.

progressive force in the American labor movement.” (25th
Convention Proceedings, May 31, 1944, pp. 65, 73.)

At the same time Dubinsky’s attitude on the C.I.O. be-
In a letter to John L.
Lewis on June 24, 1942, after the latter left the C.I.O.,
Dubinsky sank to the level of Rankin and Bilbo in char-
acterizing the leaders of the C.I.O. as “prisoners of the
communists.” ”" i

This is the way Dubinsky carried out his self-proclaimed
mission to reform the A. F. of L. ,

Matters did not stop there. I)ubinsky became the go-
between to bring John L. Lewis back to the A. F. of L.

Since his desertion of the C.I.O., Lewis has become the
most dangerous leader in the American labor movement.
Absolute autocrat of the United Mine Workers, ruling by
denying twothirds of the mine districts the right to elect
their own officials, he has crushed all opposition by strong-
arm methods and ruthless force. Despite all the publicity
making him seem “militant” Lewis has kept the mine
wages at a low level while winning praise from the mine
owners for increased speed-up.

Working for Lewis

Lewis was opposed to the war against Hitler and four
times during the war closed down the mines. He is a brazen
exponent of Big Business ideas in the labor movement,
and openly aligned himself with the Hoover and Dewey
crowd in the last elections. Having left the C.I.O., he
works to smash the progressive labor movement. And to

fget Lewis back into the A. F. of L. and form a bloc with

him there, Dubinsky went to work with crusading zeal.
When the affiliation of Lewis ﬁrst came up there was op-

position in the Executive Council from Daniel Tobin and.

others who feared his anti-war and anti-Roosevelt stand.
But justice, organ of the I.L.G.W.U., appealed to the
Executive Council not to consider such political matters
and to consider the Lewis application “from a purely trade
union point of view.”

The anti-Semitic propaganda of the Lewis Mine Work-
ers Journal antagonized all progressives in the A. F. of L.

, It was so scandalous that even the Iewish Daily Forward,

supporter of everything rotten in the labor movement, was
compelled by the pressure of its readers to protest. “Why
are the Jewish labor leaders of unions afliliated with the
A. F. of L. and who have inﬂuence and prominence there,
not coming out with protests against this anti-Semitic in-
citement?” asked an article in the Forward.

Dubinsky spoke out. Did he by chance denounce this
Hitlerism of Lewis which won him the salute of the fascist
sheets in America and the praise of Goebbels? No, Du-
binsky engaged in a clever little game. He had his edi-
tor, Max Danish, write a general article on the subject of
racial equality and the evils of anti-Semitism for the Mine
Workers journal. This had a foreword byits editor, K. C.
Adams, endorsing the contents, and in this way the little
matter of anti-Semitism was cleared up. You see, we all
agree! L

39

 

 

 

Whitewashing Anti-Semitism

Shrewd, wasn’t it? But it did not stop the Mine Work-

9

ers Journal from continuing its poisonous propaganda ;
after the A. F. of L. shut its door to Lewis. The June, 
1944, issue of the Journal published a summary of anti-_ 4.
Semitic propaganda carried by the magazine for two years, 5

as if to make up for the time it withheld its poison during
the negotiations. It was the Nazi kind of anti-Semitism

which denounces “invisible government” of “international ,

bankers” with deliberate and arbitrary listings of Jewish
names, such as Lehman Brothers and others, those who

were “in the control room for the New Deal in the in— -

!!

visible government. . . .
Nonetheless, Dubinsky wrote in the Boston Convention
report that “we regret that the application of the United
Mine Workers for readmission into the A. F. of L. has
been delayed and that no proper formula has as yet been
found to effectuate this re—afIiliation.”
y One of the main arguments hypocritically advanced by
Dubinsky was that Lewis’ admission would help unity.

This argument was blasted by the Hat and Millinery V

Worker, organ of the Hat, Cap and Millinery Workers
Union, headed by Max Zaritsky, in its issue of June 1,
1943. In a two-page editorial display under the title
“Keep Lewis Out of the A. F. of L.," the Hat and Millinery
Worker issued a terriﬁc blast against this “unity” argu-
ment. Branding Lewis and Hutcheson as part of the Tory

peace,”—a prediction fully borne out by Lewis’ conduct
since his re-aﬂiliation and particularly in the recent strike
movement. - -

Labor Must Unite

How can Dubinsky’s support of Lewis be explained?
First of all, by the fact that though there are differences
in the way they operate—fundamentally their economic
and labor policies coincide today. Both are working to put
American imperialism on top of the wor1d—and secondly,
by “great aims.” Dubinsky thinks that once back in the
A. F. of L. Lewis will come quickly to leadership and un-
der his iron dictatorship, the combination of Lewis, W011
and Hutcheson ,(with Dubinsky’s help) will succeed in
dominating the labor movement. “Great aims” indeed—-
to tie labor to the kite of the imperialists and make such
reactionary America Firsters dominant in the labor move-
ment.

Dubinsky’s alliance with Lewis and W011 against the
C.I.O. and progressive trade unionism within the A. F.
of L. is nothing short of treason to the I.L.G.W.U. and
the cause of labor. What is needed today is not vain and
futile plots or maneuvers to smash progressive leaders
and policies of the C.I.O., nor a unity of scheming leaders.
What is imperative for the well-being of labor and the
nation is genuine labor unity of all the unions, A. F. of L...
C.I.0., Railroad Brotherhoods and Miners, and common
action against the advancing forces of Big Business, reac-
tion and fascism.

V. INDEPENDENT POLITICAL ACTION
-——I-‘on WHOM?

The garment workers cannot insure their future without
correct politics, and correct politics today means the de-

velopment of a strong ﬁghting front of labor and progres-

sives against the trusts and their political henchmen of
both parties. It means the development of independent
political action by labor.

It is clear that the two old parties are dominated by the
economic royalists, as Roosevelt aptly named them. This
is well known as far as the Republican Party of Hoover
is concerned and it is becoming clearer every day with

. regard to the nature of the Democratic Party of Truman,

Byrnes and Rankin. ’
The time has come to move more boldly along the -path

of independent labor politics, to put forward the perspec-_.

tive of a broad anti—trust and anti-fascist third party and to
lay the groundwork for its formation in time to affect the
elections of 1948. This is imperative if the present danger-
ous situation is not to continue, and especially if labor is
not to have the shoddy choice in the next presidential elec-
tion of two candidates, both serving Big Business reac-
tion, imperialism and the war rnongers.

The Road to a Third Party

Of course, the development of a third party is not easy
because of the many diﬁiculties which exist and those
which will be added. But they can be surmounted be-
cause the time is ripe and the need is great. The millions
of common people, if organized and combined, can wipe

parties just as they swept aside the barbed wire entangle-
ments that blocked the independent combination of work-
ers into trade unions.

The road will have many twists and turns but its main
direction is quite clear: to organize the local unions and
their members to take an active part in politics; build
up the existing political organizations of labor and pro-
gressive middle class forces (such as C.I.O.-P.A.C., Nation-
al Citizens P.A.C.,. the A.L.P., the Independent Citizens
Committee and the like) and form similar bodies on a
local and state scale; work together for the needs of the
people, and at the right time, to form the third party.

In the elections of 1946 the tactics of labor must be to
come out against all open reactionaries and sham pro-
gressives who serve the trusts, and put up pro-labor peo-
ple wherever possible; take part in the old-party primaries
and win the nominations for true progressives; or, where
this is impossible, run independent tickets; and in certain
cases, in order to defeat the outright pro-fascist candidates,
it will be necessary to endorse candidates who are pro-labor
though they may waver on some issues.

Such is the independent, though many-sided policy and
tactics that will defeat reaction and conserve democracy.
Such is also the line that will advance labor to a new and
higher stage when it will be free at last from dependence
and bondage to the two old gangs of capitalist politicians.

This policy will encounter many obstacles within the
ranks of labor, from those who have illusions with regard

to certain politicians as well as those who hesitate to break‘ _

with the old ways in the face of ﬁerce and growing oppo-
sition from the side of business. But the main opposition
will come from the old clique of the A. F. of L. and from
Dubinsky and his kind who work with them but who ap-
pear to favor independent politican action.
43

  

If Dubinsky is a disrupter on the ﬁeld of economic ac-C 1 T
tion, he is doubly so in the matter of politics.

Splitting the Political Front

This will be evident from his support to the reaction-
ary Truman Administration which we will discuss a little
later along, and from his activities in New York and na-
tional politics. T

In the New York City elections of 1945 the Liberal
Party, under the direction of Dubinsky, joined with Dewey .
and set up a Republican—Libera1 Party slate which gained
the support of anti-labor Democrats, establishing a reac-
tionary coalition in the big city. Many alibis were offered
for this unprecedented action, but the true motive was
stated by Dubinsky at the city-wide conference of the Lib-
eral Party on June 14: to isolate and defeat the American
Labor Party. He said: “The part that the Liberal Party
is bound. to play in this election will serve to isolate the
Communists from the true liberals and will stamp the,
A.L.P. now dominated by the Communists as a negligible
factor in the city and New York State. It will convince
some of the Democratic and Republican politicians that
dealing with the Communists, no matter under what dis-
guise, is the kiss of death." (justice, July l, 1945.)

Dubinsky, as usual, miscalculated. He has proven a bad
prophet more than once. In this case -his tactics missed
ﬁre entirely and lost the Liberal Party half its vote. But
it meant that Dubinsky was drawing closer "to the parties
of the monopolists and bankers. . A

It was an inexcusable act at the time since it meant
helping Dewey and Hoover in combination with like
Democratic reactionaries to win the Empire State in 1946..
Is that not a crime against labor? To assist the Dewey
forces is to aid the enemies of full employment, job secu-
rity and the worst opponents of increased wages, greater
unemployment insurance, guaranteed annual wages and

- the demands of the garment workers. It means to make a

mockery of the resolutions adopted by the union.

This shift to Dewey was not accidental. It was the de-
liberate policy of the Dubinsky group. Let us recall its
conduct during the presidential election. At that time it
endorsed President Roosevelt but its actual support was
only a formal matter. Its main efforts were spent in ﬁghting
Sidney Hillman, the Political Action Committee, the
A.L.P. and the Communists. It rendered the greatest
service to the Dewey camp by its Red-baiting campaign.

Star Witness for Dewey

Dewey's campaign reached the lowest level in American
politics. It was shot through and through with demagogy,
anti—Semitism, intolerance, prejudice against foreign-born,
and Red-baiting.. Toward the end of the campaign Dewey
made a grand effort to stampede the country into be-
lieving that there was a secret underground conspiracy of
the Communists and Hillman to take over the White
House and establish a Godless regime. He carefully set
the stage for a big ‘exposure and on November 1, speaking
before a huge meeting in Boston, he trotted out this con-
spiracy charge with all the trappings of a prosecuting at-
torney. And who was his star witness to “prove” the
authenticity of the accusation? It was David Dubinskyl
Here is what Dewey said:

You don't need to take my word for what the Ameri-
can Labor Party is today. Listen to the words of another
set of my opponent’s violent supporters. David Dubin-
sky, president of the International Ladies Garment
Workers Union, was ‘one of the founders of the Ameri-
can Labor Party. Here is what he said last spring about

— that party as of today. He said: -“I regard the former
American Labor Party as a Communist labor party. . . .
Mr. H-illman can act as a front for Communists. I never
did and never will." '-

45

So said David Dubinsky. . . .

Sidney Hillman has become the biggest political boss
in the United States, and in the words of David Dubin-
sky, Sidney Hilman is a “front for Communists.” (Gov.
Thomas E. Dewey, New York Times, November 2,

1944.)

This speech was not made in New York City where
Dubinsky’s Red-baiting is well known and where his words
carry little weight with labor. It was made before. an
audience ﬁlled with Christian Fronters; it was carried over
the radio and through the press to the entire country. And
it was echoed by the Republican machine in the highways
and byways of big and small towns. “See,” cried the re-
actionaries to the middle classes and to the politically less
experienced and unsophisticated workers in small towns,
“here's the proof of the Red Conspiracy to take over the
White House. Dubinsky said it. He ought to know-—
no one can accuse him of being partisan—why, he’s a labor
man and even a Roosevelt supporter. He says the Reds
through Roosevelt want to take over the country!” And in
fact, Tom Girdler, the notorious open—shopper, scared
the business world during the campaign in these very
"terms. This is what Girdler said:

I suppose no one would think that David Dubinsky,
head of the I.L.G.W.U., was a labor-baiter. Yet it is a
matter of public record that Dubinsky was one of the
crowd of leaders who split off from the A.L.P. in New

York on the ground that it was Communist-controlled.’

The leader of the A.L.P. and the Chairman of the
C.I.O. Political Action Committee is one and the same
man. His name is Sidney Hillman.

Wasn’t this rolling ammunition for the guns of reaction?
It may be said that this was not an intentional aid to
Dewey but just an unfortunate by-product of the inner
ﬁght in the American Labor Party. But how was it that
the words of one side and not the other in that struggle

were so helpful to reaction? How was it that Dubinsky's
words ﬁtted in so neatly with the whole pattern of the
Dewey campaign? How was it that both Dewey and Du-
binsky were singing the same Hitlerite _tune—Dewey
against Roosevelt and Dubinsky against Hillman and
Quill in the .American Labor Party ﬁght? The crime is
not that Dubinsky necessarily held a meeting with Dewey
(though that is not excluded) and agreed on the same
strategy. The crime consists in the fact that even without
a meeting, Dubinsky served Dewey’s aims—one fought the
progressive cause from outside, while the other did it from
within the ranks of the progressive and labor movement,
and both aided reaction in the country. What a price the
labor movement would have paid had Dewey won!

Splitting the A.L.P.’ -

The splitting of the American Labor Party by Dubin-
sky was nothing short of a scandal. The American Labor
Party is the independent party of the working class and
the fruit of many generations of effort. It is the sign that
labor no longer trails behind the capitalists, but seeks to
determine politics itself. No matter what combination
might be essential as immediate tactics to defeat the danger
of reaction, labor will have to build up its own indepen-
dent political strength in the future and emerge more and
more as the leading force in the ﬁght against monopoly
capital, encouraging and rallying around itself all pro-
gressive forces. The A.L.P. polled 500,000 votes in the
last national election despite the split. With all pro
gressive labor forces in the State united, the A.L.P. could
become the second or ﬁrst party in New York State. This
is what Dubinsky is trying to prevent.

Why did Dubinsky split? Was -it a matter of who
should control the organization? Was it because some out-
side force, the Communist ‘Party, was trying to take it
over? That is what Dubinsky charged. But it has been

"proven repeatedly that Red-baiting is only a smoke screenl F,/EC
to conceal reactionary aims. The fact is that Dubinsky  a ‘
wanted no unity. 4  Ofpl
Unity Plan Rejected  thég

Sidney Hillman offered a plan to unite the party by: Cal .
placing it in the control of the unions. He proposed that; it n‘
all trade unions of the State alﬁliate with the Labor Party; selﬁi
and that all matters of party policy be determined by the: mus
vote of the representatives of the participating trade unions to t}
based upon per capita tax payments to the Party. Surely! is it
a labor party, if it is to be representative of the organized; will
labor movement, should be controlled by the delegates: (Wh:
of the unions. This was rejected by Dubinsky on thee’ but.
ground that it would give too much representation to Com-i sives
munists. But this was answered by Hillman with a new Sm“
proposaI—the selection of a leadership excluding those who mm]
were considered as Communists—a grossly unfair proposi-7 BL
tion, as Hillman himself declared, since it discriminates Wind
against political opinions and denies to trade unions the D1
democratic right to select representatives of their own Cram
choosing. But for the sake of unity this was mistakenly. as W}
agreed to by those considered as Communists. This, too,‘ free ;
was rejected by Dubinsky. . tiona
The cry of Communist control was thus exposed as only avoid
a dodge. The Labor Party was split because Dubinsky kind
.,i could not use such a representative body for u1tra—reac- form‘
 tionary purposes. This was made clear by Dubinsky’s own:
i  statements. Asked by Benjamin Stolberg, the author of
L  Tailor's Progress, what. his conception is of a political, Th
‘I party of labor, Dubinsky answered: “Well, its ﬁrst con- of the
M % sideration should be no class government ofany kind." Cratic
 i f ‘ “Labor . . . should be a social pressure group pushing its back .
y y y ‘ views on great social questions, lobbying for progressive imell‘
 1  1 T legislation, keeping society in balance. Labor must be in so bod
  cial politics, not in party politics." (Emphasis mine— Y

“believing that it [the Labor Party] is not fundamentally
a political party.” What a bureaucratic philistine view
of labor politics. “No class government of any kind”-
that must be “the ﬁrst consideration.” .
Of course, the question naturally arises why was a politi-
cal party started if it is not to serve class interests? Was
it not organized because the capitalist parties serve the
selﬁsh class interests‘ of big capital and therefore labor
must have a party to advance its interests which correspond
to those of the majority of the people? And once formed,
is it not clear that such a party, if based on the unions,
will not only push its views and lobby for legislation
(which labor did in the past without a party of its own)
but will put forward its own candidates, support progres-
sives, ﬁght for its own program against the other parties,
strive to win the people to its side and achieve government
control——in short, engage in party politics?
Buteven his words about “social politics” were mere
window—dressing. .
Dubinsky found himself- pressed by events and a demo-
cratic-minded labor membership to ﬁght reaction, where-
as what he wanted was a party in which he would havea
free hand to maneuver, make backstairs deals with'reac—

‘ tionary Republicans and Democrats, and which would

avoid militant political action. He wanted a different

kind of party. That is why he split from the A.L.P. and
formed the Liberal Party.

What Is the Liberal Party?

The Liberal Party is not a labor party—an organization

of the trade union movement. It is the same Social-Dcmo~ A

cratic Federation which Dubinsky established many years

back with the addition of some middle class lawyers and.

intellectuals. It is not a democratic organization, but a

body controlled by the union oﬂicialdom, chiefly of the
49

I.L.G.W.U. The membership of the I.L.G.W.U. has no
say in its decisions, just as it had no part in its formation.

>The Liberal Party talks of itself as a third party, which
will be a competitor to the Democratic and Republican
Parties. But it will be nothing of the sort. It is already
a rival of the American Labor Party and the Political Ac-
tion Committee.

Forgotten Words

At the Boston Convention the leadership of the Liberal
Party gave reassuring pledges that it did not intend to
compete with the P.A.C. Addressing this convention,
John Childs, chairman of the Liberal Party, said, “Out-
side of New York State, we shall give our full and hearty
cooperation to the C.I.O. Political Action Committee (ap-
plause). It is not our purpose at this critical time to divide
the liberal and labor forces, but to unite them” (25th Con-

’ vention Proceedings, p. 76). But these words were forgot-

ten soon after they were uttered. The Liberal Party not
only fought the P.A.C. in the Presidential elections, but set
about exploring the possibilities of national organization
at the earliest opportunity. In December, 1944, Israel
Feinberg urged the chairman of the Liberal Party to ex-
tend the organization nationally in a letter published in
Justice. He wrote: “We must lay the basis for a permanent
Liberal Party——not conﬁned to New York, but extending
throughout the country. VVe should make some explora-
tory moves to ascertain the possibilities of calling a na-
tional conference of liberals and progressives to lay th-e
groundwork for a national Liberal Party.” Such a semi-
secret conference was held on April 6-7, 1946, in Chicago,
attended by a number of Social-Democratic co-workers of
Dubinsky from both the A. F. of L. and C.I.O. unions. It
was, of course, a move to undermine the P.A.C. in the
1946 Congressional and State elections. Not a single
leader of that movement was invited.

It is a startling but highly revealing fact that the’ New
York World Telegram called for support to judge Jonah
Goldstein in the New York City elections on the Liberal
Party line. This is the organ of the reactionary Scripps-
Howard chain, notorious foe of the Roosevelt and labor
program. Here is what the World Telegram wrote edi-

y torially on November 1:

The Liberal Party was formed three years ago by
the former right-wing leaders of the American Labor
Party who fought long and hard to save that party from
falling into the complete control of Communist fellow-
travelers like Sidney Hillman and Mike Quill.

The very nature of its birth, therefore, gives the Lib-
eral Party the best possible claim to become the rally-
ing ground, not only for anti-Communist labor, but
also for all independent voters who see current Commu-
nist raids on labor unions and Communist meddling in
elections as a grave and growing menace to American
democracy. (Emphasis mine—W.W.)

What is Dubinsky’s attitude to the new Administra-
tion in Washington?

It will be remembered that the Dubinsky group was

larly in the years of the war, because of its policy of friend-
In fact after the Yalta

V velt Administration “as unconsciously potentially fascist,"
which is a special way of saying that Roosevelt at that time
was moving toward fascism—a preposterous conception and
an attempt at forcing him to break the alliance with the
Soviet Union. That was its attitude toward the late Presi-
dent Roosevelt just before his death.

Truman’.s Betrayal

But the Dubinsky group adopted an extremely friendly R

attitude to the Truman Administration from the very be
ginning, considering the President as a true progressive
and people’s man and as the “continuer” of Roosevelt’s
policies.

Truman’s program is the very opposite of Roosevelt’s.
It is a program that helps the trusts, not the people. If
here and there he makes concessions to hold labor votes,
these are wrung from him only through. hard struggle as
the recent strikes showed. Today the reactionary quality
of this administration is more evident in the sphere of for-
eign politics. It becomes increasingly evident in domestic
affairs, too, for it is impossible for a foreign policy to be
reactionary and a home policy to be progressive. \

There are many progressives who are disturbed by
Truman's policies, but either out of fear of the Hoover
gang or because they mistakenly take Truman at his word,
that he is for enacting the Roosevelt domestic program,
these progressives have not yet completely broken with
him but give him the beneﬁt of the doubt, and await
developments. Yet a number of them do not hesitate to

criticize him openly and, in the case of Senator Pepper, A

bitterly denounce his imperialist and sword—rattling poli-
cies.

The Dubinsky group expresses no such doubts. It cheers
the anti-Soviet policy of the administration which is being
carried out in collaboration with Hoover, Vandenberg and
the G.O.P.—the very opposite to the course indicated by

Roosevelt. It refrains from criticizing the price increases
granted to the trusts and is even for them as a matter of
policy. Iustice of March 1 quotes approvingly the Presi-
dent’s statement which regarded the empty shell of the em-
ployment bill passed by Congress as a “substantial begin-
ning,” while keeping silent about his inexcusable failure
to take up a real ﬁght for the 60 million jobs program to
which the Democratic Party is committed. The Dubin-

- skyites have nothing to say about the continuous replace-

ment of liberalsin leading government posts by Big Busi-
ness politicians. They even found “good intentions’? in
the President’s proposed anti-strike legislation which
opened up the barrage against labor. They deceive the
workers, saying that Truman helped to achieve the recent
wage increases, whereas his fact-ﬁnding boards invariably
proposed wage increases farbelow those demanded and
needed by labor. By sowing sucli illusions, the Dubinsky
group obstructs and immobilizes labor from developing
independent political action to the fullest degree against
growing reaction. °

That is notall. By accepting Truman as a friend of
labor ‘or as a" “lesser evil” it actually and deliberately is
aiding Truman in his strike-breaking role as the spear-
head of reaction. For it is a bitter, yet irrefutable, fact that
under cover of being a Roosevelt man, he is destroying
the gains of the New Deal and is making open war on la-
bor. As we write, this is being starkly revealed in the rail-
road strike, where Truman openly appeared in the role
of strike-breaker to the wild acclaim of the Big Business
union—busters and their‘ Congressional spokesmen.

 

 

VI. MACHINE RULE

Rank-and—ﬁle participation in the work of a union and
in the making of its policies is the very heartblood of a
democratic organization. But the Dubinsky group has

been engaged unceasingly in the thirteen years of its ad—/

ministration in undermining and destroying the virile
democracy which made the International at one time one
of the foremost unions inthe country. '

The Dubinsky group set itself the task of establishing if

machine rule in the organization, centralizing power in the
national oﬂice, reducing the independence and strength
of the local organizations, and wiping out democratic rank-
and-ﬁle expression. And it must be said that so far it has
succeeded to an alarming degree.

Consider the position of Dubinsky himself. He occu-
‘pies the offices of both President and Secretary—Treasurer,
an unusual concentration of power. This not only gives

him authority to appoint organizers, of which in 1945 there 
were 134 responsible to him alone, but in addition he ex- i

ercises virtual control of the expenditure of the union
ﬁnances. Executive Secretary Frederick F. Umhey is in

fact an administrative oﬂicer subject to direction and con- 

trol by the President-Secretary-Treasurer. Dubinsky con-
trols the Eastern Out-of-Town Department with its 45

organizers and the Cotton Garment Department with 25 '

organizers; he has a «staff of 64 others spread throughout
the country, practically running the south and southwest
areas, and overrunning other districts. They constitute

a sort of hierarchy that owes no responsibility to the mem- i

bership in their localities.

G.E.B.-—Rubber Stamp

With such despotic control’ over appointments and
ﬁnances, it is not surprising that the General Executive
Board has been reduced to a rubber stamp which exercises
the right of meeting every four or ﬁve months to okay
the policies already initiated or to make general decisions
whose fate are completely dependent upon the highly or-
ganized machinery of David Dubinsky himself. More-
over, a number of members of the Executive Board are
on the organizing staff of the national oﬂice and subject
to removal by the President, and thus are mere puppets.
Others rarely dare to voice dissenting views in the face of
such power.

Under such_cir_cumstances it is not surprising that the
General Executive Board is a_closed corporation. Rarely
does a new person get elected to the Board. Though 75

per cent of the union are women, there is but one woman

among its 23 members. With 15,000 Negroes in the union,
there is not a single Negro on the Board. A large and
growing number of members in the East and West are
Spanish—speaking, but these workers are not represented
either. In fact, though the Board is intended to be

a broadly representative of different areas, few local people

who are native to their districts get a chance to come into
the Executive.

The conventions reﬂect this machine rule. The conven-
tion committees which handle most of the business and
prepare its decisions are all appointed by the President
and are tightly controlled.bodies. At the last convention
every committee but one was headed by a Vice-President
as chairman and by a local business agent or Joint Board
head as secretary. The single exception was the Commit-
tee on Oﬂicers’ Report and this was chaired by an ap-
pointed organizer. The rank-and-ﬁle delegates, most of

55 ’

 

 

whom are well versed in union affairs, receive no such
appointments.

As a result the International conventions, which once
were robustly alive with floor discussion by the delegates,
resemble the boss—controlled conventions of the Republi-
can and Democratic Parties, serving chieﬂy as a forum for
outside speakers and with practical business discussion of
union affairs reduced to a minimum.

Rotten Borough System

— The system of representation to the convention still
remains extremely undemocratic. The small locals which
are easily under the inﬂuence and control of the National
Office are still in a position to outvote the large locals
having a majority of the members. For example, 16 small
locals with a membership of only 2,500 have the same num-
ber of delegates as a local having ten times greater mem-
bership. 81 small locals with members of several hundred
each and totaling a membership of 18,000 have the same
number of delegates as 14 locals with a membership of
125,000. The “rotten borough system” continues despite
the bitter fight and changes brought about by the left wing
20 years ago.

The out-of-town membership of 30,000 in the Metro-
politan District have no democratic rights at all; they are
denied the right to select their business agents and are
ruled by the Out—of-Town Department, which is subordi-
nate to the President. Repeated requests to grant them
autonomy have been ignored. The other big centers
outside of New York are only formally independent. In
most of the districts, and especially in the South and West,
affairs are determined by the organizers on the payroll
of the International. It would seem that, with the indus-
try spreading continuously to these centers, strong and
self-sustaining boards would be set up with sufficient funds

to select and direct their own organizers, but this is not the
policy of Dubinsky who ensures a large part of the delega-
tion to the National Convention by such means. This is
one of the reasons for the large organizing payroll, which
could be substantially cut without materially affecting the
union welfare. ‘ '

By-Passin g the Members

This autocratic machine deprives the membership of the
right to pass and decide on important matters of policy,
and saps the vitality of the local organizations. Such
major matters as the union’s attitude to international
trade union unity, severance from the A.L.P. and forma-
tion of the Liberal Party, withdrawal of the union from
the C.I.O. and re—entrance to the A. F. of L., were all de-
cided by the G.E.B. or by conventions without ﬁrst sub-
mitting the matter for discussion and approval by the mem-
bership. Dubinsky uses the device, perfected by John
L. Lewis, of bringing important questions of policy to
the machine—controlled convention, getting its Okay, and

p then wielding its authority to put them into practice, thus
' either by-passing a membership discussion or holding one

as a postscript to the decision. Even the endorsement of
the candidate for mayor of New York, Jonah Goldstein,
was decided by the General Executive Board, despite the
avowed position of Dubinsky that this election was exclu-
sively a local matter. The New York membership was
given no chance’ to pronounce its judgment.

"Not on the Agenda”

In the locals, too, the membership, which’ should be the
deciding body in the union, is generally on the receiving
end of things, being “told” of what has taken place in
long reports by the union heads. Efforts to discuss mat-

ters when they‘ are still in the deciding stage are ruled,

“out of order” as not being on the agenda, or members
are told to wait for a ‘-‘report” which comes generally
whenvthe question is already decided by events, or when
the report is meaningless and decision useless.
Since’l937, the existence of groups has been prohibited,
except for a period of three months before elections. This
was carried with the agreement of left wing groups who
Voted for it out of a mistaken conception of unity. Groups
areunnecessary and rarely exist where there is unity of
policy and where democracy and free expression is prac-
ticed. This is not the case in the I.L.G.W.U. In practice
this decision has worked only to stiﬂe membership criti-
cism and.opinion ‘and solidify machine rule. Groups
favorable to the administration function in various locals
protected by the oﬂicials and actively prepare for elections
long before the three-month period, whereas the rank—and-

’ ﬁle groups must await the stated time.

Reactionaries With Trimmings

The local administration generally reflect the national
bureaucratic setup.
York, and some of the miscellaneous locals, it is straight
boss-control with the members reduced simply to dues-
payers. In locals where a rank—and-ﬁle militant tradition
prevails, as in Dressmakers Local 22, the leadership main-
tains a show of democracy which consists of the right of
members to speak for ﬁve or ten minutes at membership
meetings, which are held only three or four times a year.
Here the will of the members is frustrated by the device
either of excluding urgent controversial issues from the
order of business, or of ruling them out should they be
raised from the ﬂoor, on the ground that they must be
proposed and put on the agenda three weeks before the
meeting takes place. This in effect disposes of them with-
out action, since the next meeting is generally three or

58

In some locals, as in Local 89, New .

four months off. When opposition opinions are vigorously
pressed at meetings, it is not at all an unusual sight to
have administration ring-leaders set up a brawl to cut off
the speaker.

This local of 25,000 members, covering a jurisdiction of
more than a thousand shops, has no system of shop repre-
sentation in the control of unionaffairs. In progressive
unions of both the A. F. of L. and C.I.O. nowadays, even
locals with a thousand members have a shop steward or
shop chairman system of control in which representatives
of the shop meet regularly at least once a month to discuss
and decide policies. These meetings, composed of elected
shop representatives, not only serve as the democratic clear-

ing house for the common problems of the trade and the

direct voice of the membership, but are the means—and in

fact the only means—whereby such large numbers scat-
tered in so many shops can truly exercise control over the

affairs of the union. But in Local 22, administration and

control is centered in the manager and business agents,

with a small executive doing its bidding. At one time this

local, which prided itself on its membership, held meet-

ings of “active” people, but this has long ago been dis-

carded. Meetings of shop chairmen which are held.at

times, upon the will of the oﬂicials, generally have only

consultative powers and have no deciding say over union

business. The local regime today is thoroughly bureau-

cratized, with appointments to paid oﬂice and even unpaid
committee posts made almost exclusively from among

those who pledge to follow the factional clique of Charles

Zimmerman, whose reactonary policies and activities,
trimmed at times with progressive phrases, in all impor-

tant respects correspond to those of David'Dubinsky. _ .

Blitzkrieg Tactics

Since the managers and ofﬁcers of the union have com-
plete control in the locals, let us inquire into the manner
59

 
 

 

 
 

 

 

 

in which elections take place and to what extent they are
democratic. This is pertinent since the Dubinsky group
likes to speak much these days about the suppression of
democracy in Europe, especially about how minorities and
opposition “are being ruthlessly crushed” in Rumania,
Bulgaria, Poland and Yugoslavia by the Red Army. How
much democracy do they themselves practice in their own
organization?

The last elections in 1944 showed that in the matter of
elections, as in all things, the Dubinsky group practices
much hypocrisy but little democracy. In these elections,
it outdid itself in violations of democratic procedures in its
eagerness to register a complete knockout of the left wing.
The election from beginning to end was organized as a
blitzkrieg against the opposition groups. (What were the
methods used? '

V How to Crush Minorities

First, a new system of voting by slates was introduced.
The intent of this system of voting is to enable the machine
to avoid selection on the basis of merit and to perpetuate
division on group lines. This system was recommended
by Dubinsky and Luigi Antonini on the grounds that it
simpliﬁed the elections and followed the two party sys-
tem of voting. “Under the slate system,” said Antonini,
“the member knows for whom he votes . . . each and every
member knows for what policy a group stands. In that
way they vote as in the political elections. In the politi-
cal elections the Republicans have their eagle, the Demo-
crats have their star . . . and the voters know more or less
what their platforms or principles stand for.” (25th Con-
vention Proceedings, p. 312.)

This sounds reasonable. But if voting is to be done
on the basis of groups, why was not the right of groups to;

_ exist re-established at the same time? If group voting is

60

\

correct and resembles “political elections” why is not the
existence of groups also correct and, in fact, essential for
such type of voting? Imagine a government in Washing—.
ton making a law that you must vote by party ballot but at
the same time declaring that parties have no right to exist
except on the eve of the election. Would that not be a
farce? In substance that is what is in force in the
I.L.G.W.U. today. .
_ The effect of the new system of voting has been to reduce
to _zero the possibility of minority representation.
This method of voting inevitably introduces the spoils

system characteristic of the boss—controlled two—party set— .

up: “Either get on a slate or be defeated,” is the situation
presented to candidates by this method of voting. “Either
support the admiiiistration slate where it is strong or suffer
the consequences and be left off as possible candidates in
the future”—this is the atmosphere created by this system.
It was rightly opposed by a delegate from Los Angeles as
a system “which does not extend democracy but on the
contrary stiﬂes the desire of the membership to run for
oﬂice.” (25th Convention Proceedings, p. 312.)

Second, the Dubinsky group undertook a wild and
unprecedented Red-baiting campaign supported by the re-
actionary press to frighten off progressive members and
to divide and confuse the ranks of the opposition.

Third, where these extreme methods did not ensure vic-
tory they resorted to outright intimidation, strong arm
methods and plain election steals. p

The Dubinskyites were victorious in the election, but
they failed to rout the opposition and deliver a knockout
blow. Despite the full scale blitz attack, 25,000 votes were
cast against them.

Expulsions in Local 10

Two examples will illustrate the methods used in this \

election:

61

 

 

 

 

 

In dutters Local 10, a strong opposition developed and
a complete slate for all offices was put forward. It was
sponsored by a large list of members and from the very
outset showed considerable support. But no sooner was
the ticket launched than Isidor Nagler disbarred four of
the candidates, including his opponent for manager of the

V local, Arnold. Ames. The latter was eliminated on the

trumped-up charge that he had entered a shop, misrep-
resented himself as a business agent and negotiated a griev-
ance affecting a member belonging to the rank—and-ﬁle
group. It was obviously a crude frame-up manufactured
out of thin air and proven as such at the hearing where
witnesses called against Ames testiﬁed in his behalf and
cleared him‘ of any charges. But Nagler managed to
wangle a “reprimand” through his Executive Board and
on the ground that Ames had been disciplined used the
constitution to disqualify him from running.

Not content with beheading the ticket by this crude

frame—up and still fearing defeat, theNagler slate then
went on a rampage to ensure its victory.

In violation of the constitution, which forbids use of
the union machinery for election purposes, business agents
used the authority of their offices to canvass the shops for
“contributions” to the election campaign. Meetings were
called ostensibly as regular union meetings, but were con-
verted entirely into campaign meetings, with only repre-
sentatives of the Nagler group as speakers. Business agents
ordered shops to come down to Vote and demanded that
they report to them before entering the polls. Worst of
all‘, Assistant Manager Stulberg of the Nagler group, in a
most ﬂagrant attempt at intimidation, called members into
his office and threatened them with a denial of privileges
if they refused to work for the slate. The whole campaign
was conducted in an atmosphere of antagonism, provoca-
tion and terror. When Ames spoke at a large meeting

of Cutters against the frame-up and illegal disbarment, he

62

 

-  muuw;nun-..«.~.msww-wwmmwzwyuusmewv

was met by organized interruption by Nagler himself who
seized the microphone from him (in completedisregard
of the chairman) and prevented him from speaking. Pro-
tests to Nagler against the obvious election steal went un-
heeded and a proposal to ensure a fair count by inviting
the Honest Ballot Association tolsupervise the election,
was ignored.

This is the way in which the Nagler group carried
through the election and ensured its perpetuation in ofﬁce.
Not content with this election steal, the Nagler group fol-
lowed with the suspension of seven members of the oppo-
sition on the ground that they issued leaflets during the
election slandering the officials.

The indictment against the seven suspended members
reads: “Between January 1 and April 30, 1944, the de-
fendents . . . committed acts and engaged in conduct detri-
mental to the best interests of the International and local
by libeling the oﬂicers of the International and the oﬂicers
of Local 10 in at least seven circulars, leaﬂets and other
written and printed matter. . .  The indictment follows
with quotations from the leaﬂets in which disagreement
with the policies and practices of the administration lead-
ers was expressed and which appealed to the membership
to defeat the administration slate and elect the rank-and-
ﬁle candidates. .The leaﬂets discussed such issues as the
opposition of Dubinsky to world labor unity, the anti-
Soviet attitude of Nagler and other oﬂicials of the local,
the disruptive policies of Dubinsky in the American La-
bor Party and similar legitimate issues of controversy with-
in a labor union, particularly at the time of elections.
Yet, on these grounds, the seven members were disciplined.

What a mockery of an election and what a monstrous

, ‘suppression of opinion! For issuing literature criticizing
the machine during the election period and ﬁghting for
their rights to invalidate the undemocratic election mem-
bers were suspended for periods of three to ﬁve years.

63

 

 

Where Antonini Rules ~

In Local 89, of which Luigi Antonini, ﬁrst Vice—Presi—

dent of the International, is boss, a slate of candidates,

headed by Frances Ribaudo was put forward. But this
opposition was crushed by similar means. The meeting
at which candidates were nominated was carefully policed
by Antonini stooges who walked ‘up and down the aisles,

_ an ominous warning to those who might challenge the

leadership. The elections lacked‘ even a pretext of
democracy. Committeemen appointed by Antonini con
ducted the election, entered the booths, “advised” voters
and counted the vote in good old Tammany style. In
making up the ballot the machine resorted to the petty
trick of printing Antonini’s name in large, bold type while
putting his opponents at the end of the ballot in incon-
spicuous type.

Appointed Oﬁicials

Some words are in order about the general conduct of
this local. Democracy is a phrase which Antonini loves to
roll, especially in his weekly broadcasts and in appeals for
Italy, but Lady Democracy is a complete stranger in the
affairs of this huge local of 30,000 members. VVhereas
the business agents are elected in all other locals except
those denied autonomy, they are appointed in Local‘89
by the Executive Board which is itself virtually a hand-
picked alfair. To qualify for the Executive or as an offi-
cer of the local, a candidate must be passed by an Examina-
tions Committee which is given broad powers “to examine
the legal and moral ability of the candidates and decide
accordingly. . .  And this Examinations Committee,

which approves or disapproves candidates, is itself not
elected, but an appointed body! It is set up in a highly se-
lective way “with one member of the General Executive

64

Board duly appointed by the President of the I.L.G.W.U.,
the general manager of the joint Board and three others
who are well recognized in the labor movement selected
by the Executive Board of the local” (Article 23, Chapter
VIII of the Local By-Laws). Is it surprising that Antonini
has repeatedly weeded out opposition and built a sub-
servient machine with this Examinations Committee?

Meetings are rare events and take place at the discre-
tion of Antonini about once in six months. How then
do the members learn of the union business? This is done
by weekly broadcasts over Station WEVD, “Meetings of the
Air” as the members call them, where Antonini does all
the talking. '

To cover up this autocratic control, Antonini has set up
a general shop council which meets on call. But it has
not the slightest resemblance to a democratic shop organi-
zation. It is a council elected at a general meeting from
a list of candidates nominated by individual members and

not on the basis of the shop, which means most of the/'

candidates cannot be known to the members and do not.
and cannot represent the shops. Ironically enough, this:
caricature of a shop council was put over by the Soviet-

baiting Antonini in the name of “democracy of the Soviet.

type!” Is it any wonder that the name of Antonini is a.
by-word to the members of this local? :

Machine rule in the I.L.G.W.U. is not a new develop-
ment in this union but is rooted in the past. Bureaucracy
long ago established itself and worked out its high-handed
methods of dealing with membership opposition. Never
at any time did the ruling hierarchy permit democracy
to the point where it might jeopardize its position. When-
ever confronted with such a threat, the leadership resorted
to the policy of expulsion, even to the point of ousting the
majority of members as in the infamous case of the expul-
sion of the leadership of Locals 2, 9, and 22, in 1926. The
entire history of the union in the twenties is ﬁlled with

VII. WAR AGAINST FASCISM——
ON WHICH SIDE WAS DUBINSKY?

J ~ We have so far discussed the national policies of the

Dubinsky leadership. We must now go over to its inter-
national policies and activities. This is necessary not only
because this group has been extremely busy in world
politics, regarding it as one of their specialties, but
also because world affairs have become an inseparable

: part of daily life. _There is not a single family or_ a

single person whose life and fortune has not been directly
affected by international policies, by the struggle between
democracy and fascism, and especially by the great war
which has just ended.

This colossal struggle cost the lives of 50 million persons

and destroyed wealth running into hundreds of billions.

It was brought about by German and Japanese fascism
which sought to conquer and dominate the world. Fas-

. cism turned entire nations into rubble, converted millions

into slaves and exterminated whole regions and peoples,
annihilating one-half the Jewish people of the world. Not
a wall remains of the Ghetto which made up one-third

‘of Warsaw. Fascism which overran Europe and Asia

threatened the independence of the entire world. Had
Hitlerism and Japanese imperialism been victorious, civili-

_zation would have been blotted out and darkness would
have descended on the world for 30 to 40 years. This ter-
'rible menace was defeated by the alliance of democratic

states and peoples, and in the ﬁrst place by the Soviet

‘Union whose great armies tore the guts out of the Nazi
A Wehrmacht.

67

 

PREFACE

Everyone familiar with the labor movement knows that
David Dubinsky and the Social-Democratic group of labor
oﬂicials which he leads, have a long record of promoting
disunity.» Not every one, however, realizes the full extent

of the harm they do. Dubinsky is not only head of a big A

and important union, disposing of a large treasury; he has
built and controls.a web of other inﬂuential Social-Demo-
cratic organizations. In addition, he is now a member of
the Executive Council of the A. F. of L. Through these
positions, he and his group pursue a concerted and sys-
tematic policy, the menace of which is heightened today
because of the role of American imperialism in world af-

' fairs. ’

It is a noteworthy fact that Wall Street imperialism ﬁnds
it useful and necessary to build up such types of Social-
Democratic labor leaders and to extend their inﬂuence
for its own reactionary purposes. They ﬁnd such leaders
especially useful because as Social-Democrats, the Dubin-
sky groups pose as progressives——as opponents of capitalism
and as belonging to the radical section of labor. Actually
they are opposed to all progressive currents and act as ,a
brake and stumbling block to labor’s development. They
are, in fact, masked reactionaries who perform their dis-
ruptive role in their own distinctive way.

The purpose of this pamphlet is to enable labor to see
behind the mask and detect the real face of this Social-
Democratic group and the harm they do. In‘ particular
it is hoped that it will enable the members of Dubinsky’s
own union to see how far he has led them away from the
progressive past-—a past which he now dishonors. If it

5

VVhat was the policy of tlie Dubinsky forces toward
this tremendous conﬂict with fascism, particularly toward
the war with Nazi Germany? For years they regarded the
Soviet Union as the chief menace of the world; they talked
of the Soviet state as a “totalitarian” state and as “masked
fascism,” more open to condemnation than open fascism.
The associate editor of the Jewish issue of jnstice, replying

to a strong criticism by the president of Pressers Local 362'

of Baltimore to an anti—Soviet campaign of the paper in
1943, justiﬁed his position on the ground that the Soviet
system was “Russian fascism [which] masks itself as the dic-
tato_rship of the proletariat . .  and “a masked fascism,”
he wrote, is even more condemnable because it is more
dangerous than open fascism.” (Jewish Justiee, April,
1943. Emphasis mine—W.W.)

Before the attack of Germany upon the Soviet Union,
the Dubinsky group tried to stir "up America for war
against the Soviet Union in behalf of “little Finland’’——
the Finland which was in the grip of the Czarist Manner-
heim who tried to take Leningrad and open the road to
Moscow for the Nazis.

Against Collective Security

VVhen the Soviet—German pact was signed the group
carried on a campaign of unprecedented violence, trying
to turn the wrath of the people away from the Chamber-
lain gang that was responsible for the appeasement policy
and which refused a pact with the Soviet Union that could

have prevented the war. They blamed the outbreak of

the war in 1939 on the Soviet Union and deliberately mis-
represented the pact~between Germany and the Soviet
Union as designed by Stalin to aid Hitlerism. Yet it

is well known today that the pact served to defeat the cun- ’

ning attempts of reactionaries to create a front of Britain,
France and Germany against the Soviet Union. It also

gave the Soviet Union two additional years to prepare for
the eventual war with Hitler and at the same time enabled

-it to save large numbers in Eastern Europe, including one

million Jews.
The fact is that the Dubinsky group opposed the pol-

‘icy of collective security which Communists and progres-

sives advocated in order to stop Hitler and insure the

, peace. It supported the policy of appeasement which‘ cost

so much blood and torment to the peoples of the world.
The coalition of democratic states was ﬁnally formed, how-
ever, after the invasion of the Soviet Union by Hitler.
England and America, which had refused such an
alliance with the Soviet Union before, were now compelled
to join forces with the Soviet Union out of sheer neces-
sity, Yet. even then there were imperialist forces in Britain
and America that continued to work for the destruction

of the Soviet Union. Churchill and the Chamberlain gang
in Britain, and Hoover, Byrnes, Vandenberg and Farley in

America, had as their paramount aim to bleed the Soviet
Union to death. Having nourished the Nazis, and built
up a Frankenstein monster that turned on them, they
fought not to destroy fascism but to weaken Nazi Germany
as an imperialist competitor and to use it as a tool against
the Soviet Union. They never intended, nor do they in-
tend now, to wipe out fascism, whose revival they are again
fostering. Their purpose was two—fold—subjugation_of an
imperialist rival—destruction of the Soviet Union. To-
wards this end, they blocked the opening of a second front
for several years and deliberately dragged out the war.
The Dubinsky group worked along the same lines. Their
paramount aim, too, was the destruction of the Soviet
Union. They, too, favored the dragging out of the war so
that the Soviet Union would ﬁnally collapse. Moreover,

‘they worked for a regrouping of forces with the United

States ﬁnally aligned against the Soviet Union.

69

 

“The Last Shot”

This shameful purpose was ﬁrst stated by I. Chanin, I
secretary of the Workmen’s Circle, a long and intimate ‘
associate of Dubinsky in the Jewish labor movement. A
VVriting in the Workmen’s Circle publication Friend, in_

1942, soon after the outbreak of the war between Germany

and- the Soviet Union, he declared: “The last shot [in this‘

war will] be ﬁred by the United States and from that shot
the Stalin regime too will be shot to pieces.” (Publication
of Workmen’s Circle, Friend, Vol.’ XXXIII, No. 1, Janu-
ary, 1942.)

This call for the overthrow of Stalin and the Soviet
Union aroused tremendous indignation among the Jewish
people. But it was nonetheless brazenly endorsed and re-
peated by David Dubinsky. Speaking before the Work-

men’s Circle Convention in the following year in April,
1943, he said:

When Chanin wrote that the Stalin dictatorship
would be shot to pieces, the accusation also fell on me
and Abe Cahan [editor of the jewish Daily Forward].

I want to declare here openly that I am in agreement i V.
with Chanin’s words. (Jewish Daily Forward, May 3,‘

1943.)

Clear enough. War on the Soviet Union—that must be
the ﬁnal aim of this war. i That there may be no mistaken
idea that these were just chance remarks, or mere spilling
of spleen, we will burden the readers with just one more
document.

A conference of American and European‘ Social—Demo-
crats took place in the New York Rand School on July 1,
1941, just nine days after the invasion of the Soviet Union.
These Social7Democrats, with whom the Dubinskyites

maintain the closest ties, and some of whom they ﬁnance j 

in the name of helping “anti—Nazi exiles,” drew up a
i 70

“~'-—NU‘

declaration of war aims and peace terms which was signed
among others by William E. Bohn, editor of the New
Leader, and Algernon Lee, director of the Rand School.
The declaration reads:

If the Bolshevist regime should survive the war, the
democratic nations must recognize it as a source of dan-
ger. The League of Nations should prepare armed
force against the Soviet Union and use all means of
moral and economic pressure to hasten the liquidation
of .Bolshevism. (War Aims and Peace Terms—Rand

- School Press, p. 10.)

That was in 1941.

Chanin spoke out in 1942.

Dubinsky aflirmed this despicable aim in 1943.

And it was the guiding strategy of the group in every
phase of the war. I

This explains why the New Leader, political organ of
the Dubinsky group, insisted that lend—lease be given

T j to the Soviet Union only on condition that “the Stalin re-

gime be overthrown ﬁrst.”

This explains why Dubinsky made such a terriﬁc cam-
paign against the Soviet Union when it executed Alter
and Ehrlich—two spies of the London Polish Govern-
ment trying to carry out the. program of the “last shot.”

This explains why only 8 per cent of the large funds
collected by the International for war relief went to the
Soviet Union which carried the overwhelming burden of
the war and whose peoples suffered the greatest depriva-
tron. ~

With the Polish Fascists

This explains why the last International Convention at
Boston did not have a single speaker who talked of cement-
ing the alliance with the Soviet Union. Speaker after
speaker sniped, denounced and warned the gathering of

71

 

 

 

the danger of the Soviets communizing Europe,» in a lan-
guage indistinguishable from Hitler’s fulminations against
Bolshevism. Of all the statesmen in Washington to address
the convention, Dubinsky chose Attorney General Biddle
and Adolphe Berle, ]r., two well-known Soviet-baiters.
And ﬁnally, it makes clear the ardent support and de-
fense by the Dubinskyites of the ex—Polish government of
London. David Dubinsky, speaking before an A. F. of

' L. postwar forum at the Hotel Commodore on April 12-13,

1944, made an appeal on behalf of this government “as rep-
resenting a cross—section of Poland itself” and “composed
of a majority of sincere democrats, many of them well-
known leaders of the labor movement.” (Complete Report
of Proceedings, p. 16.) Of course, everyone knows that this
was a government composed mainly of Pans and Colonels.
It was the group that persecuted the Jews in the Polish
London Army and whose agents in Poland circulated
propaganda that “it is a good thing the Germans are kill-
ing the Jews; we will have less work to do after the war.”
It was the government whose underground army in P0-
land, headed by the Fascist General Okulicki, carried on
terroristic acts against the Red Army, had dealings with
the Nazis and prepared for a war jointly with Germany
against the Soviet Union.

General Okulicki admitted that the underground army
was maintained after the Soviets entered Poland precisely
for that purpose. He stated the calculations of the Polish
reactionaries as follows: “In the event of the victory of the
U.S.S.R. over Germany this will not only threaten Brit-
ain’s interest in Europe but the whole of Europe will be
frightened. . . . Considering their own interests in Europe,
the British will have to proceed to the mobilization of
the forces of Europe against ‘the U.S.S.R. It is clear that
we shall take a place in the front ranks of this European
anti-Soviet bloc; it is also impossible to visualize this bloc
without the participation of Germany which will be con-

trolled by -the British.”“ And this band of ant.i-Semitevs
and fascists, determined to continue as mercenary troops
of reaction and imperialism, was embraced, defended and
regarded as democrats by the Dubinskyites.

Thus, in the most epoch-making war, when progressive
humanity was united and ﬁghting in all parts of the far-
ﬂung globe against barbarous reaction which historically
seeks to halt the advance of civilization, the Dubinsky
ofﬁcialdom of the I.L.G.W.U. was on ‘the side of reaction,
seeking to split the unity of the democratic powers and
viley intriguing for a reactionary war against the main
bulwark of victory—the Soviet Union. There can be no
greater condemnation of any group.

I'ntrigue Goes On

The policy of Dubinsky and the pro-fascist reactionaries
in our country met defeat. The alliance of the United
Nations withstood the cunning maneuvers of Hitlerism
and its aides. The Dubinskyites had miscalculated the
strength of the land of socialism. Lacking faith in a work-
ing class regime and blinded by hatred, they believed their
own fairy-tales about the weakness of the Soviet Union,
or else they were taken in by their Polish cronies.
Steeped to their eyes in prejudice, they were unable to
rightly assess the profoundly democratic nature of the
Soviet state, whose rights (including the right to work)
are the widest in the world, and whose people are free
of any form of economic, national or political oppression
because there are no classes which live by exploiting others
in that Socialist country. And that is why the Soviet Union
fought so heroically and emerged more powerful. ,But
this fact did not stop the game of intrigue. On the

“ The Case of the Sixteen Poles, published by the National Council
of American-Soviet Friendship, pp. 24-25.

 

 

if contrary, Dubinsky and his group, frightened at the
growth of the Soviets and the resurgence of democracy
in Europe, have become even more desperate.

Strategy Today

The strategy for the postwar period which is now being_

followed by the Dubinsky group was laid down by Raphael
Abramovitch, dean of political advisers to Dubinsky on
world affairs, a bitter and cynical old plotter against the
Soviet Union. Writing in the Jewish Daily Forward on
March 1, 1945, after the Yalta Conference, Abramovitch
said:

The Yalta Declaration on liberated Europe is an
empty shell if it is to be interpreted as an earnest guar-
antee of European democracy. It is not an earnest guar-

S antee and cannot be as long as the allies cannot and
do not want to quarrel with Russia. (Emphasis mine—-
W.W.)

Thus we are told that the key to everything is a will-
ingness to quarrel with Russia. ~

But, adds this crafty schemer, “Let us not give up hope.
The ﬁrst time in the history of both America and Europe,
Europe’s order and democracy becomes the business of the
United States.”

As yet it is only in principle.
real thing can develop.” .

The real thing!—to develop a quarrel between the
United States and the Soviet Union, the two greatest pow-
ers upon whom the peace of the world in highest measure
rests. To create quarrels and to tear the alliance asunder,
the Dubinsky gang, together with other Social-Democratic

“But from principle the

plotters, have been seizing upon every difficulty arising

from the multitude of world problems.
They are unrestrained in their attacks on the new
74

lb

 

 

democratic governments of Rumania, Bulgaria, Poland
and Yugoslavia. Their stand on these countries is bitterly
shameful because it is directed against a people, enslaved
for centuries, who are finally carrying out a great demo-
cratic revolution against the feudal oppressors who sold
their countries to. Hitler.

With Luce and Hoover

They violently attack the unity of the Big Powers and
particularly strive to abolish the veto power which ista
mainstay of unity and peace and a guarantee that the new
security organization will not degenerate into another
League of Nations. They energetically support and en-
courage the Big Stick and atom bomb diplomacy of Ameri-
can reactionaries, and defend the British Labor Party's
foreign policies which are indistinguishable from those
of the former Tory Government.

They have warm words of praise for MacArthur’s

appeasement line in Japan while keeping up a drumﬁres

against the Soviet Union, whose determined efforts to
protect democracy in Europe and Asia they decry as Soviet
imperialism.

They do not content themselves with merely echoing the
pro—fascist Hearst and Patterson press, but are in the van
of the campaign, fabricating slogans and arguments to
keep it at fever pitch, joining hands with the crudest im-
perialists. This can be seen from two unprecedented acts:

In July, 1945, Antonini signed a joint memorial with -

Hoover and Landon to President Truman, then at the
Potsdam Big Three Conference, urging him to demand
the immediate withdrawal of Russian troops from Poland
or to occupy that friendly country with British and Ameri-
can soldiers. This was done at a time when the Polish
Government was still in the throes of establishing order
in that fascist—ridden land.

75

 

 

 

On May 5,, 1945, the Dubinsky-Woll led American
Labor Conference for International Affairs, under the
signature of its Executive Director, Varian Fry, mailed
to all its labor affiliates, the manifesto of the multimillion-
aire publisher, Henry Luce. This manifesto called for

“an Anglo-American agreement . . . continuing the com-
bined military staffs and pooling‘British and American
bases in every part of the world for 20 years. . . . ” Thus,

almost a year before Churchill, the Dubinsky group raised
the imperialist banner of an Anglo-American bloc after
the war.

Anti-Soviet politics, it may be said, makes strange bed-
fellows. The Luces, Hoovers and Landons are by no means
strangers to the Dubinskys and Antoninis. They are be-A
coming quite good friends.

Their campaign has not been without success. Today
we stand in danger of a new world slaughter——a war
against the Soviet Union. Of course, if it comes, such a War
will be a reactionary war against the interests of the
people of the world. It will be an imperialist war against
the new democracies, theycolonial nations as well as the
Soviet Union. It will be a war for the domination of the
American dollar over the world, with Britain acting as
junior partner. It will revive the fascist forces of Europe
arid destroy the newly—found liberties of the people. This
is the kind of war which VVinston Churchill called for in
his infamous address at Fulton, Mo., which was given the
blessing of President Harry S. Truman.

Through a Picket Line

Yet, Dubinsky, Antonini and Zimmerman walked
through a ‘C.I.O. picket line to attend the Churchill din-
ner at the Waldorf-Astoria on March 15, 1946, to sit with
the Park Avenue upper crust and to lend the prestige and
name of the International Ladies Garment Workers Union

 76 .

 

 

to this terrible conspiracy. VVe must ask the members of
the I.L.G.W.U., who surely have not the slightest sym-
pathy with such purposes: is it not a disgrace to your
organization and to labor to have your President and two
Vice-Presidents walk through a picket line to cheer the
spokesman of the rotten British Empire which suppresses
the Greek people, terrorizes and enslaves the Indian people
and helps to keep the Butcher Franco in power? Was it
not a slap in the face of all who are ﬁghting the deceitful
imperialist policy in Palestine and which prevents the
people of Italy from achieving their full freedom and
sovereignty? Is it not time to speak out in clear and force-
ful tones that this desperate intrigue of the I.L.G.W.U.
oﬂicials must cease, that labor and I.L.G.W.U. want friend-
ship with the Soviet Union, want to advance‘ the demo-
cratic cause and do not want to be a pawn of the du Ponts.
and McCormicks and Hearsts to choke the cause of
the people’s progress?

An Incident at the Convention

The dangerous road which the leadership of the union
is traveling is glaringly revealed by an incident‘ at the
Boston Convention in 1944, which must be related.

The Baltimore Joint Board and the Maryland-Virginia
District presented a resolution (No. 60) to the Committee
on Foreign policy. The resolution simply and forcefully
demanded that the aims of the war be set forth clearly
as the end of the Nazi system. It is a brief resolution-
Here is its main section:

W'heras, in the opinion of organized labor, the present
war is a war to the death for the destruction of fascism
and nazism and the resurgence of democracy, and

VVhereas, there exists among inﬂuential officials of
our State Department the view that the war will be
won when Hitler, Mussolini and Tojo all have been de-
posed, and

helps the I.L.G.W.U. members to combat and curb his
dangerous activities the pamphlet will have served a use-
ful end.

As this pamphlet goes to press, President Truman has
emerged in his true light as No.~l strikebreaker. This only
conﬁrms what has been written in the body of the pam-
phlet. The name of Truman is becoming a symbol of in-

‘ famy to labor. This is not only a warning of the dangerous

road ahead, it points up the primary lesson of this pam-
ph1et—that labor cannot afford to allow the Dubinskys,
Lewises and Wolls to split its ranks without paying a

_terrible price.

Whereas, in the opini-on of organized labor the above

viewpoint is a narrow one and unless a broader view
‘ is substituted may lead to a recurrence of the evil con-
ditions which caused the present war,

Therefore, be it resolved that the idea of uncon-
ditional surrender be interpreted to mean the total de-
struction of fascist and Nazi machines and the elimina-
tion of all fascist and Nazi oﬁicials and supporters.
(Emphasis mine-W.W.)

This is a direct and forceful warning against appeasers
and the danger of fascism (which is surely valid today),
a call to overthrow the whole Nazi system, and a direct
challenge to the ideas of a negotiated peace which were
current in the country at that time.

You would think that among anti-fascist trade unionists
there should be no trouble whatsoever in passing this reso-
lution. »

Let us see what happened to it.

It was referred to the Committee on National and In-
ternational Affairs, of which Israel Feinberg was chair-
man. In reporting, Feinberg mentioned this resolution
and stated that the committee had given it serious consid-
eration and wished to submit a statement of principles
in relation to foreign policy.

What was this statement of principles? VVhat is the adop-
tion and elaboration of this anti—fascist resolution?

No. The statement piously declared in vague and gen-
eral terms that the war should bring a bettersocial system,
serve democracy, peace and cooperation of peoples, etc.,
with which all could agree, but——it did not contain a single
demand of Resolution 60. It did not mention by a single

direct word the view that the Nazi regime must be over-

thrown and that the fascist machine must be destroyed.
What happened? By a sleight-of-hand trick under the

cloak of a few general words against “military dictatorship”

and "aggressive nationalism” which can mean anything and

everything, Feinberg substituted the anti-Soviet resolution,
No. 155 of the New York Cloakmakers Joint Board, which
he heads, for the anti-Hitler Resolution No. 60.

Anti—Nazi Resolution No. 60 was out. Anti-Soviet Reso-
lution No. 155 was adopted. A

Such is the inevitable result of the game of intrigue,
trickery and appeasement that the Dubinskyites got into.”“

It is not hard to see that if you want a war against the
Soviet Union, you will not adopt a resolution which calls
for a “war to the death” against Nazism.

If you want the end of the Soviet Union, you inevitably
lean to the idea of preserving the remnants of fascism, of
German generals, of the German armed forces, of economic
power which might be useful for a bloc against the Soviet
Union to deliver ﬁnally the shot that will destroy it-
especially if the Soviet Union itself can ﬁre not one but
many shots against the fascists, as has been proven to the
gratitude of mankind.

UVIII. WORLD LABOR UNITY

.The new1y—created World Federation of Trade Unions
is one of the chief forces insuring a democratic postwar
world. After 25 years of disunity, as a result of which
fascism came to power in Europe, the labor movements of
the United States, Britain, the Soviet Union, France,
China and other United Nations met at London and Paris,
and set up an international organization. This unity was
in response to a deeply felt desire of the trade unionists
of the world, and naturally its birth has aroused tremen~
dous enthusiasm among all progressive people. The new
organization unites 75,000,000 working men and women.

Bulvvark of Peace

The World Congress has issued a manifesto backing up

_the need for a permanent security organization of the-

United Nations, for rooting out fascism and for the ad-
vancement of democracy. It is acting to defend the unions
of Greece, Spain and other oppressed countries and it is
aiding the rebirth of unionism in Germany as the
solid foundation of democracy in that land. It calls for
economic cooperation instead of rivalry among nations,
proposing extensive world trade to avoid an economic
crisis and to provide full employment, and it urges higher
wages to raise the living standards and to elevate the social
and economic conditions of the people of all countries.

The international labor body will work to raise the
wages and abolish the terrible sweatshop conditions of
workers in coloniallcountries.

Above all, it will be a bulwark’ of the people against

A

U) H-.r\ y-um l\ __._...

 

the warmakers, for in the last analysis, peace rests in the
vigorous and united stand of the working people—-of the-
labor movement.

But theone labor organization absent from the London:
Conference, and standing aside from the united world.
labor movement, is the American Federation of Labor.

That is a queer situation for the garment union which:
l1as always been international-minded. World solidarity‘
of labor has always been a cherished tradition and. close’
to the hearts of its members. In fact, when the A. F. of L-
in former years stood aside from world labor, I.L.G.W.U..
delegates to A. F. of L. conventions fought for afﬁliation-

And today the union stands in the shabby position of trail--~
ing behind the backward-looking oﬂicials of the A. F. of’ L..

and holds itself aloof from the working men of London,

Paris, Moscow and‘Milan. No, it would be more cor—--
rect to say that Dubinsky and hisgroujy are among the.-

prime movers in this trade union isolationism.

Nagler in England

Consider the actions of Isadore Nagler at the British:
Trade Union Congress at Southampton in September,
194.3‘. Appearing before the British trade unions at a criti--
cal period in the world, when the fascists were maneuver-w
ing inyevery way to pull the big democratic powers apart,
Nagler, speaking as delegate of the A. F. of L., not only‘
declared his opposition to an alliance between the Soviet.
and American unions “because the Soviet trade unions are
instruments of the State,” but he went farther and made a.
deliberate effort to disrupt the alliance already formed and.
functioning for some time between the British and Rus--
sian unions. Here are his words:

The Soviet trade unions are not free labor ‘organi--
zations in the democratic sense of the term but are:
the instruments of a state.

81

 

  

 

 

We would oppose any liaison with such trade unions
in any country. Moreover, any liaison with the Soviet
trade unions would not help the war effort. On the ‘con-
trary, it would only accentuate already existing ideologi-
cal differences and conﬂicts and would carry division
into the ranks of labor in this country, thus injuring the
primary concern of the United Nations, that of speeding
up production and prosecuting the war to a successful
conclusion. (Emphasis mine——VV

(From the General Executive Board Report to the 25th
Convention.)

What a dishonorable role Nagler assumed to attack the
Soviet unions before British labor and to seek to disrupt
the well-functioning Anglo-Soviet Unity Committee. This
scurrilous attack on the Soviet Union so infuriated the
needle workers that 3,000 cabled their opposition to Nag-
ler’s stand to the British Trade Union Congress.. And yet
this disgraceful speech was endorsed by the G.E.B. in its
Boston Convention report “as a notable address.” It re-
printed the above words as a summary of its own position.

Of course, the British unions disregarded the remarks

of Nagler. Their experience proved the very opposite to.

what Nagler predicted. Far from accentuating differences,
they were lessened. Far from hurting the war effort, the
alliance helped to raise morale and boosted production.
Far from injuring the unity of labor within the country,
it strengthened it. The election victory over the Tories
showed that. The VVor1d Trade Union Conference is the
fruit of Anglo-Soviet cooperation.

Nonetheless, Dubinsky and the A. F. of L. continued
their opposition on the alleged ground that they would
not sit with unfree unions, with the Soviets in particular.
Is it really a matter of principle with them? Is it directed
at the Russian unions alone? What do they mean by “free
unions”? -

Isolationism

In a recent statement, the A. F. of L. chiefs explain
their conception of freedom. They declared “unions can
be free only if they are based on the system of individual
initiative and private ownership.” And what of Europe,
where much of the industries are nationalized and more

 

will become government-operat-ed to overcome the ray?

ages of war? What of the European unions that advocate
nationalization? What of the French or the British unions
that havechampioned this demand for many years and are
beginning to put it into practice? Evidently, then, the
unions in continental Europe are not free unions. Sir
Walter Citrine, secretary of the British unions, was assailed
by George Meany, secretary of the A. F. of L., at a meeting
of the New York Central Labor Trades on the ground
that, according to Meany, he packed the London Trade
Union Conference, at the behest of the “Foreign Ofﬁce.’.'
Meany added that the unions of the colonies could come
to London only through air passage provided by the Brit-
ish government. They, too,_th.en, are “government-con-
trolled” unions. It turns out.tl1at the only free unions
are thoseof the A. F. of L.

But can you have an international labor movement if
you exclude the Russians “because they are not free,” ex-
clude the C.I.O. “because they are dual unions,” exclude
the European trade unions “because they are not based on

individual initiative and private ownership,” brush aside 4

the British unions as _“Foreign Ofﬁce dictated,” eliminate

_ the Latin American unions because “they are totalitarian

dominated,” and all of them because they are a “front for
the Communists.” Obviously, you cannot. The picture
is clear. Beginning with the Russian unions, theattack
is now directed against nine-tenths of the world labor
movement. Fine world unity, indeed!

The fact is that the A. F .- of L. leaders, including Dubin-

- ’ 83

 

 

 

sky, do not want a virile international organization. Just as

a they oppose unity with the C.I.O. because they are pro—gres— A

sive, but on the pretext that they are “dual unions,” so
they are afraid of the fresh winds blowing throughout
the world, of the new vigorous anti—fascist trade unions
that have arisen in Europe and elsewhere. Their position
is much like that of Hoover, Byrnes‘, and Rankin, who are
opposed to real world coo'peration, but do so under the
mask of liberal talk about “justice,” “protection of small
nations,” “democracy,” etc.—a1l empty declarations on
their lips. if

A Bad Guess

Yet to carry through such a policy is not easy. The work-
ers want and need unity. Dubinsky and W011 had the
answer——“Re-establish the old International Federation of
Trade Unions”—that’s a safe organization because it never
included the C.I.O.land the Russian unions. Never mind
that it died a dishonorable death a long time ago and was
never heard of during the_many critical years of the war.
Reurrect the dead and use the corpse to block the new
international. That was the slogan of these crafty ofﬁcials.
And indeed, it was the hope of Dubinsky that with this
slogan he would prevent an agreement at the recent Lon
don and Paris meetings. In fact he declared at a meeting
of Local 117,, in March, 1945, that the chances were 75
per cent that the London Conference would not even be
held. He guessed badly. And what is more, his friends of
the old international left him in the lurch. What re—‘
mained of that organization joined up with the new, and
became a part of it! However, this did not stop their oppo-
sition. V They not only continue their verbal attacks but
cling to the International Labor Office, an offshoot of the
deceased League of Nations, and use it to prevent the full
representation of the World Federation of Trade Unions

84 '

 

 

in the councils of the United Nations organization.
Itwould be a mistake to think that this represents the
sentiments of the membership of the A. F. of L., or of the
I.L.G.\V.U. The membership does not want isolationism
either in relations between nations or unions. That day
is gone. Practically all districts of the machinists have
gone on record-—700,000 are for the World Conference;

\ in the Painters Union, 200,000 members favor it; District

Councils in Cleveland, Minneapolis and New Haven are
against the A. F. of L. stand; three hundred local unions
of the A. F. of L. sent wires to the Paris meeting of the
World Labor Federation endorsing the organization. And
garment union members would stand for the World Fede-
ration of Trade Unionsgif free debate were allowed. Will
Dubinsky invite representatives of the ”World Federation
to present the issue to the locals of the I.L.G.W.U.?

Such is the position of Dubinsky and Nagler on interna-
tional unity—they are working against it. And in whose
company do they standP——in the company of such “free
unions” as the International Longshoremen’s Union, with
its president, John P. Ryan, “elected for life”; with the
Hod—Carriers Union whose indicted president held off a

convention for 30 years;’ with the Carpenters Union,
headed by Czar Hutcheson.

Soviet Trade Unions

Since so much has been said about the Soviet trade
unions that is false and intended to poison our relations
with our Soviet ally, let us see what the Soviet unions are
really like. Are they independent, and free “in the demo-
cratic sense of the term?” In order to avoid any argument
about the truth, we will quote from the celebrated authori-
ties on the British trade unions and for 30 years leaders in
the British Labor Party, the noted Sydney and Beatrice
Webb.

85

 

 

In their study of the Soviet Union, Soviet Commu-
nism, the Webbs state that trade union membership
in the.Soviet Union is voluntary, not compulsory. One

 

pays an initiation fee on entrance and regular monthly‘
dues. The unions carry on negotiations for wages and

working conditions and sign agreements with manage-
ment. , They have clubs, theatres, sports groups, daily
newspapers, and other educational institutions and in maf-
ters of culture do on a large scale what any good union
in the United States can at best do only in a very limited
way. The unions work, however, _in a socialist country
where the workers control industry. They, therefore,
have rights and functions which we do not have. They
have the control of the whole social insurance fund of
the country, and take part in matters affecting production,
since an increase in output beneﬁts them directly in
wages, and indirectly through improvement of the na-
tional wealth.

Describing the democratic spirit and interests of the
members of the Soviet trade. unions, the Webbs write:
“The ‘workers’ meetings are free and well attended to the
extent of 50 per cent and sometimes over 75 per cent of
the whole body, and by women as well as men. They are
the occasions for much unrestrained discussion of persons
as well as of industrial policy and lo-cal conditions of life.”*

The Soviet trade unions are independent of the Soviet

government and the Communist Party. At the same time

they work in closest collaboration with these and other
organizations to advance the welfare of the workers and
toilers. The allegation that the trade unions are not free
because they are dominated by the Communist Party is
without any foundation, as can be seen from the fact cited
in a report in 1939 by N. Schvernick, then head of the
Soviet unions, that “among the ’members of the trade

*S0viet Communism, p. 180.

86

union committee offactories and other establishments 80
per cent are non party. . . 

' Discussing the work and inﬂuence of the Communist
Party, the Webbs ridicule the idea thatit pushes the trade
union members around, stating that “if the Party inﬂu-
ences or directs the policy of individuals or public authori-
ties, it does so openly by persuasion. If it exercises power,
it does so by ‘keeping the conscience’ of its own members
and getting them elected by the popular vote.’’**

.As to the absence of strikes i.n the Soviet Union,
Michael P. Tarasov,. Soviet trade union leader, writes:

“Naturally American workers who have taken the no-strike ‘

pledge understand why we have no strikes during the war.
But even in peace time we have no strikes because the
workers have always ‘had other and effective means for
adjusting their grievances. There is not and never has
been any anti—strike legislation in our country because the

question of strikes simply does not arise.” He continues:

“Although the unions at all times fully criticize manage-
ment for any ineﬂiciency or failure to protect their in-\
terests, there is no basis for hostility between labor and
management. Our workers are fully acquainted with the
ﬁnancial situation in the country as a whole and in their
own enterprises. They know that under our economic
system, no individual receives any proﬁt but that everyone
including the plant management is a wage earner . . for
all these reasons there can be no question of strikes which
curtail ‘production. We can only speak of the constant.

effort to raise productivity still higher, which in turn

results in still better working conditions and greater cul-
tural facilities.”*** _

I. RETURN TO REACTION

The International Ladies Garment Workers Union ‘has
always occupied an important place in the labor move-
ment. It was formed under the inﬂuence of the ideas of
socialism, in a series of militant struggles against bitter
exploitation and sweatshop conditions. Its membership
has always had a high degree of culture, class‘ consciousness
and labor solidarity.

From the start the union has taken a keen interest in
world affairs. It carried on political as well as trade union
work, initiated and promoted social legislation, and as a
result attracted wide and favorable attention and wielded
considerable influence in the labor movement. This was
particularly true in the earlier years of the organization.

The fact that the union has been concentrated in New
York City, where half of itsmembership is locatedtoday,
has given it weight in the affairsof the great metropolis.

The union today stands at the peak of its membership,
with over 300,000 workers in itsranks. It has spread its
organization to new territories and new branches of the
women's apparel industry. Its_ membership has expanded
beyond the pioneering groups of Jewish and Italian work-

' ers, and embraces large numbers of Spanish-speaking,

Negro and native American workers, especially in the
smaller communities. With 100,000 members now outside

New York, the union has grown to be an international 1

organization in fact as well as in name. Its ﬁnancial posi-
tion, according to the leadership, is in the best shape “with
millions in the bank.”

It would seem, then, that things are booming, and, if

delegation of C.I.O. union leaders to the Soviet Union
which fully substantiates the fact that the unions of the

Soviet Union are strong, virile, democratic organizations.
What slander, then, to talk of the ‘Soviet unionists as

\ “slave labor.” What is the test of the freedom of unions

and unionists? It is heroism, productivity, culture 'and in-

‘, dependent bearing of their members.‘ And on this -basis

do they not stand amongthe ﬁrst in the world? Slave labor
is not heroic. It is notoriously wretched and unproductive,
whereas the Soviet unionists have performed marvels of
production. What are the-Red‘ Army men whom the world
applauds for their heroism? Are they not trade unionists

V .,in uniform? You would think that labor leaders, especially

those who once claimed that they were “believers in so-

cia1ism,”- would take pride in the ‘accomplishments of g

union men in any part of the world. Not so with the olﬁ—
cials of the garment International. '

IX. MONEY-BAGS FOR DISRAUPTIONJ

The Dubinsky group does not limit its disruption to
the sphere of tactical maneuvers. It uses hard cash as well.
It is a fact that the International raises large sums of money
for other than direct union matters. A yearly dollar tax for
“labor organizations and institutions,” imposed in 1941,
brought in over $900,000, according to the 1944 ﬁnancial
report. VVhere do these funds go and for what purpose? A
number of useful public welfare institutions received
money from this fund; But to which labor bodies did the
money go? ’ I '

Two of the main recipients of the International’s money
are the Jewish Labor Committee and the Italian-American
Labor Council. The Jewish Labor Committee, which is
headed by Adolph Held as president and Dubinsky as
treasurer, received from the International in the period
1940-44 sums from both the “Labor Solidarity Fund," as
well as directly from the War Relief Assessment, a total
of $91,500, not including $15,000 assigned to the Jewish

- Labor Committee to forward to. Russian War Relief. (“Fin-

ancial and Statistical Report,” 25th Convention Proceed-
ings.) J ’
This committee receives funds from other unions and

from the general public. Let us see how it disposed of

them. It must be §aid that its reports of expenditures are
very ‘vague and the purposes very general. It is not easy
to tell speciﬁcally where the funds go. In its report for the
year ending Dec. 31, 1944 the Jewish Labor Committee
gives the ﬁgure of $332,295.13 for European work, which
it describes with the all-inclusive title: “Underground and
- 89

 

Labor Institutions, Rescue and Activities’ Against Anti-
Semitism and Intolerance.” Not very deﬁnite.iBut. let us
look further for a light on its doings. The report quite
early published a letter of thanks, apparently from the

‘ French labor movement and supposedly as a token for

work in the restoration of the French unions. The name
of the General Confederation of Labor is mentioned in
the letter, but it is signed by one Albert Giulio, who calls
himself “Representative of the French Union Movement.”

The report, strangely enough, fails to say whether money
was sent by the Committee to the French Confederation of
Labor which continued to function during the occupation.
If it did, why was no letter received from that organiza-
tion or from its representatives, but instead from an
individual with such an unofficial, non-existing office?
Evidently, it. is from some group within the Confederation.
Why did groups receive funds and not the Confederation
itself? And why say in the report that it is a"‘tribute from
the French labor movement?”

The same report (page 4) also says we “started building
the council for the underground a year and a half ago . . .
a council in which are represented the labor movements
of Czechoslovakia, Austria, Hungary, Germany, Norway,
France, Poland, Luxembourg, Belgian, Holland, Den-
mark, the International Transport Federation and the
Jewish Trade Union Movement in Poland.” What is this
council? Is it the revival of the bankrupt Socialist Inter-
national? -

The report continues, “the American labor movement
was primarily interested in the trade uﬁion movement in
Europe, we had to place our primary interest in the demo-
cratic European socialist movement.” But the trade union
movement in Europe is wider than the socialist movement.
It includes Workers of all political beliefs and in most

 

countries is united into single trade union bodies. Why ‘

90 .

 

was money, collected for aid to the labor movement, used
exclusively for the Socialist parties? Why has it not turned
over such funds tothe united trade union organizations?
The report records no such donations.

Which Underground?

The “Underground of Poland" is mentioned as receiv-
ing funds. It says “our help went constantly to Poland, to
the Jews in the Ghettos, to those engaged in the under-
ground movement.” VVhich underground is this? The
underground in Poland was controlled by the ex-Polish
Government forces and, as facts show, this was an anti-
Semitic group engaged in preparing for war on the Soviet
Union, having relations with the Nazis and still, today,
carrying on anti—Semitic fascist attacks on Jews in Poland.
VV ill the Jewish Labor Committee state to whom the funds
went? In its report the year before, in 1943, it says that
funds were sent through the Polish Government in Lon-
don for refugees who came fromAPoland to the Soviet
Union. To what extent have they been working through
this anti—Semitic Polish government?

Other funds are listed as distributed for relief to refu-
gees from nazism in Europe. But this, too, hardly tells to
whom the funds went. The reason for anonymity is not
strange. These funds were used to bring to the United
States the Social Democratic general staff from European
countries, men like Abramovitch, Seghers and Stampfer
of the German Social—Democratic Party who were respon-
sible for paving the way for the victory of fascism in those
countries and whose main occupation in the United States
is to plot against allied unity, and who seek to return to
power in Germany as agents of the imperialists. ~

The fact of the matter is that the Jewish Labor Com-
mittee is the main arm of the Social—Democratic leaders
in the United States -to prevent Jewish unity and the

91 T

 

 

‘development of a strong labor movement abroad. With
agents in the main cities of our land and with other con-
nections in Europe, it intrigues and works to prevent a
real democratic labor movement arising in liberated
Europe. It serves as a divisive force in the Jewish world
at a time when the Jewish people are sufferingthe worst
torments in history. That is why the Jewish leader of the
British Workmen’s Circle, Dr. W. Baron, condemned the
splitting work of the Helds, Dubinskys, Chanins and others
in this committee, saying that their Red—baiting was harm-
ful to the American people.

Antonini and Pope

The Italian Labor Council is headed by Liugi Antonini
and received from the International in the years 1940-44.
directly the sum of $50,000. Another sum of $25,000 was
assigned from the 1943 War Relief Fund for “Italian
Underground,” and a like sum for the “Free Trade Unions
in Italy.” (“Financial and Statistical Report,” 25th Con-
vention Proceedings.) The Italian Labor Council was or-
ganized to assist the rise of a democratic Italy. The nature
of the work of Antonini is revealed by his alliance with
Generoso Pope, publisher of the Progresso I talia America,
after the fall of Mussolini. This scandalous alliance out-
raged the Italian labor movement. It caused the resigna-
tion from the Council of its secretary, Joseph Cattalonati,
and two members of the Board, Angelica Bellanca of the
Amalgamated Clo-thing Workers, and George Baldanzi,
executive vice-president of the Textile Workers Union of
America, who denounced such collaboration with Pope as
appeasement of fascists “who extolled the beauties of fas-
cism and all the crimes commited in its name.”

Now Pope's paper publishes weekly the addresses of
Antonini delivered over Station VVEVD, the price he pays
for such useful collaboration. ‘

92

 

Funds are raised by Antonini for a free Italian labor

movement and the International gives funds for this pur- I

pose. In 1944 Antonini announced a trip to Italy and at
the same time the press reported that he was taking with
him $250,000 for the union movement. Antonini went and
returned, but failed to leave this fund for the Italian
unions. On his return he reported that the Confede-
ration is united, including all former divisions of the labor
movement, Socialist, Communist and Catholic. Very well,
why not give the $250,000, or the amounts raised for this
fund, to this representative, free and united labor move-
ment? The answer is found in the fact that this unity was
not to‘the liking of Antonini, that he wanted a movement
with the Communists out. He wanted a divided labor
movement controlled by people of his type and was using
the fund as bribery and blackmail to achieve it. The new
labor movement in Italy is poor and needs funds. And the
rich uncle coming from America with a fund announced
as $250,000 thought he could club the Italian unions into
accepting his dictation.

The Rich Uncle from America

But this is outside interference of the rankest sort and

the free Italian labor movement, including the Socialist

leaders, branded it in that way. Here is what the Socialist
Ignazio Silone wrote in A1/anti (February 24, 1945) of
Antonini’s work in the United States, his broadcasts over
VVEVD and his trip to Italy:

B workin for a s lit between the Socialists and the
Y _ 8 P _ _
Communists and b settin the roletarian and demo-
. . ‘/ . 3 P
cratic parties one against the other, they hope to be
able to isolate the most active anti—fascist groups and
to defeat one at a time the forces of the Left, as it hap-
pened 25 years ago in Italy and some 15 years later in
German and'in other countries. Wherever this ha -
‘/ . . . . P
peneel, the reactionary forces prevailed. First it was the

 

 

   

turn of the Socialists and Communists, then the Demo-
crats were singled out for destruction, and then the
Catholics, the Liberals and the very conservative ele-
ments.

We know these schemes of the reactionary forces,
becausewe were their ﬁrst victims. . . . We..would be
criminallystupid if we should allow ourselves to fall
once again into this vulgar trap. This is why we cannot
but condemn the scandalous campaign waged by Liugi
Antonini against the Communist Party of Italy, through
those broadcasts which are largely advertised, from time
.to time, in our country, by the INS agency of the Hearst

group.

That is the sordid use to which the funds of the Inter-
national union are being put. _
A third channel to which the “Solidarity” funds go are

-‘Social-Democratic organizations of all kinds.‘ Aside from

the large sums expended for the ﬁght in the American
Labor Party to keep the Dubinskygroup on top, a sum of
between 45 and 50 thousand dollars went to 40 or 50 such
organizations in the years 1940-44, some old and many new,
and not a few of them just plain “back—door” organizations
(see “Financial and Statistical Report,” 25th Convention

 

Proceedings, pp. 26-27-28). Among them are the Socialistike .

Vestnick, the notorious anti-Soviet Russian paper edited
by R. Abramovitch, which received $700; the Paris Navy
M ir, another such sheet which received $200; the American
Labor Conference for International Affairs, which got
$6,500, and the New Leader, $5,000. This latter weekly is
a Social—Democratic fifth—column sheet, which has among
its contributors William Henry Chamberlin, who also
writes regularly for Hearst, and Eugene Lyons, whose
writings, according to the Army paper Stars and Stripes

of May 19,1945, were found among tons of propaganda

used by Goebbels to demoralize American troops.
_We must ask, by what right are funds which are raised
94

 

by direct tax from people of all political opinions and for
“labor solidarity” used for such purposes? If people wish
voluntarily to give to any speciﬁc political party, Social~
Democratic or" otherwise, that is a matter of their own
-consciences and they are obviously free to do so. But to
tax workers for labor solidarity and use it for partisan,
political purposes and of disruptive nature to boot, is that
not a violation of elementary democratic rights? It is of
course proper and necessary to donate money to aid the
labor movement here, in Europe and in Asia. But surely
the workers who donatethe money, and indeed all of labor,
have the right to demand and to know that it be done
fairly, squarely and through representative agencies.
This cannot be said about the use of these funds.

Two Internationals in One

The International under Dubinsky has become one of
the chief money-bags for anti-Soviet plotting .and for sow-,
ing division in the world labor movement by direct agents
and through connections which it helps to ﬁnance. Usually
such work is carried on by a political party, and in “ the
past was the work of the parties joined together in the
Socialist International. Since that oraganization disap-
peared, such work is now carried on by Dubinsky, the
Jewish Daily Forward and others. Rich America has be-
come the center of world reactionary propaganda and
Dubinsky’s oﬂice has become one of its main centers. How
neatly that ﬁts in with the role of American imperialism
on the new postwar scene! In fact what we have centralized
in Dubinsky’s ofﬁce are two internationals—the trade union
body which is known, and the secret, political organization
and its ramiﬁcations which are not so known. '

To carry on such work requires funds and time, and for
this a special apparatus is necessary. Such an apparatus
exists in the International under the direction of jay Love-

95 ..

 

 

stone, who sits in’ the International oﬂice and receives his

‘ salary from the International payroll as the expert wire-

puller; added recently is the head of the Jewish Labor
Committee, A. Held. They are assisted on the outside by
such experts as Vvilliam Chamberlin, Eugene Lyons of
the New Leader, Raphael Abramovitch, and other in-
triguers. ~ 7

Who is this jay Lovestone? He was expelled from the

_g Communist Party in 1929 as the head of a group of fac—'

tional schemers who tried to tie the Communist Party to

 

the policy of the trusts and monopolists. He attached him—» A

self later to Homer Martin of the Automobile Workers
Union, .which became torn by a bitter factional ﬁght.
eMartin was expelledyby the auto workers and joined “the
payroll of Henry Ford. jay Lovestone later turned up in

g the International oﬂice of Dubinsky.

Is it .not about time for the garment workers to put an
end to such intrigue and ﬁnancial misuse which only ‘does
the work of American imperialists in the labor ﬁeld?

 

X. THE TRUE FACE OF SOCIAL-
DEMOCRACY .

VV e can now sum up the position of the Dubinsky group.
()ur discussion shows that we are dealing with a group that
is not merely mistaken in its views, i.e., “men of good
wil1—but wrong.” We are dealing with a group whose
policies and acts cofrespond to the needs of the most reac-
tionary classes in our country.

VVhat is at the bottom of its reactionary policies? Why
does it perform such a degrading role? The answer is found
in the fact that over a long period of time the social outlook
of this group has degenerated. It has ceased to think and
act from the standpoint of the working class; it has adop-
ted a capitalist viewpoint and has cast its lot with the
dying capitalist order. .

At one time Dubinsky and his immediate followers
believed in socialism, but they have discarded these “ideals
of their youth,” and have become defenders of the system
of monopoly capital and trusts, called by the deceptive
name of free enterprise.

Now we all know that there are many leaders of labor
and millions of rank-and—ﬁle members who do not yet
realize the need for socialism. That is a weakness, because
labor can move forward with sureness and vigor only
when it ﬁnally sees the need for a fundamental change in
the present system of society. Labor leaders can act de-
terminedly and consistently in behalf of the workers only
if they stand on the viewpoint of the class struggle and
realize clearly that labor’s progress and its ultimate free-
dom will come not from the good will of the capitalists
