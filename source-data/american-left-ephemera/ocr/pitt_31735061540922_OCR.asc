Wheeler’s admission by saying “the staff member in question
had not himself used the word ‘distortions’ and that he had
stated only that there were three insigniﬁcant time sequence
errors in splicing together thousands of feet of ﬁlm that make
up the picture” (letter to Washington Post, 12/23/60). In
View of Chairman Walter’s previous statement (Report on the
Communist-Led Riots against the House Un-American Activi-
ties Committee in San Francisco, May 12-14, 1960) that “only
the ﬁlm can portray fully the actual occurence,” these “time
sequence errors” become quite signiﬁcant. The students cite
as an example of one of the distortions, achieved through the
splicing of ﬁlm, the assertion of the narrator that police warn-
ings met with “jeers and boos.” A scene showing a Police
Inspector speaking to the demonstrators is immediately fol-
lowed by a shot of the students singing and chanting. These
vocal demonstrations did not immediately follow the police
communication.

The students point to portions of “Operation Abolition”
wherein allegations are made by the narrator but no ﬁlm is
shown to support the commentary. They cite in this respect
the assertion that the police gave warning that the hoses would
be used if the crowd did not disperse. This is followed by the
claim that a student jumped the barricade and the mob surged
forward to storm the doors. However, no ﬁlm shots of these
events are shown: while these assertions are being made by
the narrator, the ﬁlm shows the hosing and the subsequent
melee. All pictures taken at the start of the hosing, show the
demonstrators seated, separated from the police by barricades
which have not been disturbed.

One inaccurate statement made by the narrator is:
“Among the Communist leaders who had an active part inthe
San Francisco demonstrations was Harry Bridges, who you see
here being escorted out of City Hall by police oﬂicials mo-
ments before the rioting broke out.” Chairman Walter has ad-
mitted (in the above letter) “ . . . that the commentary is
in error in stating that Bridges was escorted from City Hall
before the rioting broke out. This unfortunate, but honest and
decidedly minor, error has the effect in a sense of ‘clearing’
Bridges to a certain extent—because it removes him from the
scene before the violence broke out.” It is difficult to dismiss
this as a “minor error” when presented as evidence of Bridges’
“active role” in the demonstrations. Other misrepresentations
are made: The ﬁlm asserts that one of the songs the demon-

8

 

 

strators sang was “lifted from the old Communist Peoples Song
Book.” The song, “We Shall Not Be Moved” is an old union
song, traditionally used in situations such as this, and was origi-
nally a religious spiritual. The commentary, in stating that
the Communist and pro—Communist press charged police bru-
tality, ignores the fact that these were not the only papers
carrying accounts of severe treatment by the police. Reporter
George Draper in the S. F. Chronicle (5/14/60) tells of a
student shoved down two ﬂights of stairs, a man “dragged like
a sack of grain” and states “Police were now clubbing the
demonstrators at will”; New York Post correspondent Mel
Wax observed (5 / 14 / 60) “Never in 20 years as a reporter have
I seen such brutality.” The narrator speaks of “well-trained,
hard-core Communist agents” employing “the shocking tech-
nique which they use to incite others to violence,” and shots
are shown of the men thus accused. But no evidence is pre-
sented to support the position that because they were there,
they were therefore in control. By such statements as “several
professional Communist agitators and student leaders direct
the activity of those Waiting in the hallways,” the narration
completely blurs the actual role of the student leaders. They
had carefully planned a peaceful demonstration outside the
building and were able to maintain order among the students
engaged in the picketing for the entire three days; it was they
who tried to negotiate with city and county officials to get
more students admitted and thereby appease the students in-
side the hall. Police Chief Thomas Cahill, testifying before
the Committee the ﬁnal day of the hearings, said “There
seemed to be no leadership whatever to the group who gathered
outside the hearing room here, in contrast to the student group
which was under the control of some leaders who were able to
reason with those young people.”

Despite these inaccuracies, despite statements such as
that of Templeton Peck, editor of the editorial page of the
S. F. Chronicle: “I have seen the ﬁlm and consider that the
commentary and editing give a distorted version of the events,”
prints have been bought by a number of large corporations and
the ﬁlm is being shown widely all over the country by clubs and
PTA groups. The prestige of the documentary is enhanced
when the ﬁlm is purchased by official agencies, such as the San
Francisco and Oakland Police Departments, the State Depart-
ment of Education, and the Federal Government for showing
in military camps.

 

It appears that the real reason behind the ﬁlm is to give
the impression that all demonstrations against the Committee
are Communist directed. The same twisted image is sustained
by two reports published by the Committee: “Communist Tar-
get—Youth,” a report by J. Edgar Hoover; and “The Com-
munist-Led Riots against the House Committee on Un—Ameri-
can activities in San Francisco,” an account from Chairman
Walter, which includes the narration of the ﬁlm. The Hoover
Report tells of Communist aspirations for attracting youth,
ties the San Francisco demonstrations with “Communist-ori-
ented” demonstrations in other parts of the world, and de-
scribes the actions of some of the subpoenaed witnesses as
purposefully inciting the crowd.

Unquestionably, many elements were present in the crowd,
not only Communists but other voluble segments ranging from
Anarchists to some people who were distributing anti—Semetic
1iterature—it would be naive not to expect these people to join
a legitimate protest. But their presence does not taint the mo-
tives of all the demonstrators. In documenting how the Com-
munist Party planned a demonstration, no recognition is given
to the fact that the students, who felt they had not only local
but national support, were giving vent to their own convictions
and frustrations and needed no impetus from the Communists.
On November 28, 1960, a Chief Inspector for the FBI admitted
to a group of approximately 100 students at meeting that
the FBI did not talk to any of the students in preparing
their report——all material was based on information supplied
by informants working within the Communist Party.

By using a blanket charge of “Communist” or “Commu-
nist dupe” any legitimate criticism of the Committee is oblit-
erated. Indeed, HUAC seemed to be setting the stage early
for the charges that were to follow, and their forthcoming
movie, when succeeding the testimony of the Customs Col-
lector regarding Communist propaganda, Staff Director Rich-
ard Arens said, “I’ve just been advised by one of our staff
there’s a demonstration going on around this building against
this committee by people who have been enlisted by the Com-
munists in response to the propaganda which they have received
respecting this committee.” The Committee has succeeded in
shifting the focus of public attention away from the hearings
and what they failed to produce in the way of new evidence of
Communist conspiracy and on to the student “riots” as proof

10

 

 

of the Communist menace. The demonstrations are utilized as
substantiation of the need for the continued existence of
HUAC. To the students falsely accused of being Communists
or Communist dupes, and to all others who know about them,
this raises further doubt of the legitimacy of the Committee’s
charges against anyone.

Opposition to the Committee is further fortiﬁed when ad-
ditional abuses come to light in the wake of its visit: two for-
eign students who were arrested in the melee at City Hall
were denied extension of their student entry permits; another
foreign student who had participated in the picketing was
ﬁnally granted an extension of his visa after much publicity
had been afforded his case; still another student who had been
accepted by a private organization, the Coro Foundation, for
an internship in Public Affairs, found that her scholarship was
revoked because, according to the foundation oﬂicials, she had
participated in a “controversy.” Sympathy is aroused over the
teachers who are still feeling the effects of the 1959 subpoenas
as well as the few actually called to appear in 1960: Teachers
who have had their credentials revoked or their applications
for renewal of credentials denied are barred from teaching any-
where in the state; one teacher who was cleared at credential
hearing has been unable to ﬁnd a teaching position; another
had been rehired but had to resign when he could not obtain
his general secondary credential.

What has been the sum effect of this connected sequence
of events?

Has there resulted any signiﬁcantly heightened public or
legislative awareness of Communist operations in the school
system or elsewhere? The testimony of most of the witnesses
did not advance past the preliminary questions. The friendly
witnesses, with the exception of one, who indeed “named a
few names,” had already appeared before the Committee in
other cities. Dialogue between these witnesses and the staff
director often gave the impression of a well-rehearsed produc-
tion. The one friendly witness who had not appeared before,
had been a member of the Communist Party in the service of
the FBI. Subsequent to the San Francisco hearings, he testiﬁed
before the Committee in Washington, covering the same ground
in more detailed fashion.

A most harmful effect has been the stamping of individual

11

 

 

 

teachers as subversive without the necessity of substantiation.
This question of “security by pressagentry” as balanced against
the unwarranted destruction of a number of individual repu-
tations is a familiar issue attendant on the activities of the Un-
American Activities Committee. ‘

Also distressing is the complete misjudgment of the intent
of the student demonstrators and the wide dissemination of
the Committee’s allegations as “facts.” To ascribe all protest
against the Committee as coming from “Communists” or
“Communist dupes” may be a tempting method of discounting
any opposition, but it is a dangerous avenue of evasion for a
committee of the United States Congress to employ.

It is true, as the ﬁlm and reports assert, that local Com-
munists were elated at the year’s turn of events. This has not
been hidden by the Communist press. Certainly their elation
was not based on the fact that intensiﬁed opposition to the
Committee meant a possible end to its activity. HUAC is for
the rather desperate Communists an “issue” and they are
loath to see good issues disappear. Communist sympathizers
began to ﬁnd forum after forum open to them in the Bay Area
for the ﬁrst time in many years.

The Committee cannot be blamed for the fact that some
of the students inside City Hall and the police——howeVer pro-
voked—failed to act in a mature fashion. It can be blamed,
nevertheless, for pretending to be something it is not—it can
be blamed for the occasions when it sacriﬁced innocent lives
with the return of no advantage to the national welfare. This
year’s activity in California has clearly not endangered the
Communist apparatus, whatever its dimensions, nor “exposed”
it in any way. Most ironically, the Committee must be blamed
for so ignoring or miscalculating the ideological struggle in
which it would participate, that it strengthens the very forces
it seeks to weaken.

The Committee and the Communist cause had never so
clearly demonstrated their need .for each other. HUAC bids
for publicity and continued existence by endlessly repeating
the same charges and taking the same witnesses to different
cities. The Communist remnants, when attacked by the Com-
mittee gain support and sympathy which would otherwise
be denied them. It is no longer frivolous to ask whether the
Committee or the Communist cause gained most from the
sequence of events in California. Perhaps they deserve each
other, but the American public deserves better.

POSTSCRIPT

The oﬁicial version of how the riot started,
after being widely disseminated by ﬁlms and
government reports, was ﬁnally repudiated al-
most one year to the day from the now famous
May thirteenth. The student charged with as-
saulting a policeman with his own club has
been acquitted by a jury whose foreman ex-
plained that there was too much conﬂict in the
prosecution’s evidence to warrant any other
conclusion. Although the case was concerned
solely with the alleged assault, on one point
there was agreement in testimony by the de-
fense and the prosecution: it was conceded at
long last that no one jumped the barricade and
that the encounter between the police officer
and the student, far from starting the riot,

/

occurred after the hoses had been turned off. "

In the light of this admission, ADA urges
the FBI and the House Committee on Un-
American Activities to reevaluate their pub-
lished accounts of the San Francisco riot, and
either correct them in regard to the errors
which have been revealed or withdraw them
completely.

While we recognize the vital need
for legislative investigations in a
free democracy, we condemn the
perversion of that function to ob-

tain political or public relations.

advantage. We urge that Congres- ‘
sional investigations be limited to V-
obtaining information leading to-fl

ward legislative action. We urge’
that the Un-American Activities
Committee of the House of Rep-
resentatives be discontinued.

3 ew recent political phenomena have stimulated such a violent

release of rhetoric as the House Committee on Un-American
Activities, with the result that it has become increasingly dif-
ﬁcult to present a dispassionate picture of what the Committee
is really doing.

It is in this connection that a recent California slice in
the public life of the Committee may be particularly revealing.
It began with a press release in June, 1959, and ended—but
not quite—with a student “riot” in May 1960. The bare inter-
vening facts are these:

110 California public school teachers were subpoenaed by
the House Committee on Un-American Activities in June,
1959. Some of the subpoenas were served on the teachers at
school, thereby giving notice to the school administrators, fel-
low teachers, and the children in their own classes that the
teachers were in some manner “suspect.” The following day,
a number of the newspapers in California published the names,
addresses, and teaching posts of the subpoenaed teachers. The
date set for the hearings was June 17, 1959. On June 11, the
hearings were postponed until September 1, because, according
to the chairman——

“The ramiﬁcations of the Communist operation in
California are so extensive and malignant that addi-
tional investigative work must be done before the
actual hearings can be held.”

On August 13, the Committee again postponed the hear-
ings, until October 14. Meanwhile, sentiment was building in
the community in oppositon to the proposed hearings. Re-
sponsible members of the teaching profession, faculty members
at the University of California and San Francisco State Col-
lege, student groups at these schools, the Episcopal Diocese

‘ of California, the California State Labor Federation, the San
Francisco Labor Council, the California State Federation of
Teachers, the Friends Committee on Legislation, San Fran-
cisco Chronicle, San Francisco News-Call Bulletin, Assembly-
men Phillip Burton and John O’Connell — all raised their
voices in protest. SAFE (San Franciscans for Academic Free-
dom and Education) was formed by a group of respected citi-
zens who offered support to those who “refuse to be used as
agencies of punishment for the committee.” Many groups in
protesting pointed to the fact that California already has ef-

1

 

fective legislation on this matter. Under the Levering Act,
California teachers must take an oath indicating they “do not
advocate” nor are they “a member of any party or organization,
political or otherwise, that now advocates the overthrow of
the Government of the United States or of the State of Cali-
fornia by force or violence or other unlawful means.” Further,
any teacher who was a Communist since 1945 must ﬁle a state-
ment of cancelled membership. School boards have ample
legal authority to question a teacher as to Communist affilia-
tion, the Dilworth Act providing that any employee who refuses
to answer such questions shall be dismissed.

On August 21, faced with unprecedented opposition, the
Committee announced the hearings were being cancelled com-
pletely, and the ﬁles of the subpoenaed teachers were being
turned over to California’s boards of education. To forestall
this move, injunction suits were commenced in the Federal
District Courts in San Francisco and in Southern Calfornia,
contending that the threatened delivery of the ﬁles to local
school oﬂicials had no visible relation to the only lawful purpose
of a Congressional committee, namely, the gathering of in-
formation to assist the Congress in legislating intelligently.
The Committee’s reaction was to turn the ﬁles of more than
90 teachers over to the State Superintendent of Public In-
struction. The S. F. Chronicle quoted William A. Wheeler,
the committee’s West Coast Investigator, as stating that the
ﬁles were delivered to the Superintendent in order to “beat”
the injunction. Roy E. Simpson, State Superintendent of Pub-
lic Instruction, requested a ruling from Attorney General
Stanley Mosk as to what shouldbe done with the ﬁles. While
Dr. Simpson was awaiting the ruling from the Attorney Gen-
eral, the committee delivered copies of the dossiers directly
to District Attorneys of the counties in which the teachers
were employed.

Since being a Communist is grounds for discharge under
the Dilworth Act, it may be argued, it was the right, if not
the duty of the Committee to furnish the school boards with
information showing that they have Communists in their
employ, and it is the corresponding duty of the boards to act
upon this information. However, what was the information
in these ﬁles? On October 26, 1959, Attorney General Mosk
submitted an opinion to Dr. Simpson, which said in part:

“These reports, standing alone, could not be used as evi-

2

 

 

,._..._____1_.._ .__.,-___._.:.,.____#,, 4, _

dence . . . In all but a few of the reports it is stated that the
Congressional Committee has received information from
a ‘reliable source’ that the person involved was a member
of the Communist Party. This, standing alone would not
support the ﬁling of any accusation. Unless one secures
the names of the persons submitting such information,
and produces such persons as witnesses, the statements,
even though they are allegedly from ‘reliable sources,’ are
of absolutely no value and may be completely discounted.
You have advised us representatives of the Committee
informed you they are unwilling or unable to provide any
additional information.”

The Superintendent of one school district commented,
“From what we saw, it was a tempest in a teapot. In the case
of our teacher, it was merely one allegation by an unidentiﬁed
person.” Another superintendent announced that “what we
saw was of no consequence,” and a school board oﬂicial was
quoted as saying, “They don’t give you the name of the accuser
—it isn’t fair.”

On a national scale, criticism was being leveled at the
Committee from many directions. In January of 1959, Con-
gressman James Roosevelt had delivered two speeches before
the House of Representatives criticising the Committee and
asking that its function be transferred to the Judiciary Com-
mittee. A group of prominent clergymen, writers, and scholars,
such people as Eleanor Roosevelt, Reinold Niebuhr, Clarence
Pickett, had signed a petition requesting abolition of the Com-
mittee. The movement seemed to be growing, as editorials

- appeared in several newspapers throughout the country.

On April 5, 1960, the Committee decided again to schedule
hearings in San Francisco. Evidently, very few of the teachers
subpoenaed in 1959 were considered conspiritorial enough to
need subpoenas this time. However, the announcement of the
May hearings of HUAC coincided with contract renewal time,
and some of these teachers found that their contracts were
not to be renewed. Since practically all were on a probationary
status, lacking tenure, reason need not be given and redress
is not available. To these teachers, the reason for their dis-
missal was all too clear. ‘

Indignation over the treatment of the teachers prompted
a much larger citizen protest attending the coming hearing
than had occurred at any previous time in California. Addi-

3

 

 

tional organizations joined the list of those who had protested
in 1959, and faculty members of the Bay Area colleges voiced
their dissent by purchasing advertisement space in the news-
papers. Approximately ﬁfty students attended a meeting at the
University of California to discuss a possible student protest.
Leadership for the meeting came from the then inactive campus
chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union, and SLATE,
a campus political party formed to foster political awareness
on campus and active in student government. Leaders of these
groups had met in 1959 to plan a demonstration, and now
formed an ad hoc committee called Students for Civil Liberties,
whose initial action was the circulation of a petition calling
for the cancellation of the hearings and abolition "of HUAC.
The petition received 2000 signatures. Plans were laidfor a
non-violent picket line and monitors selected to enforce the
rules. The San Francisco police were contacted and picketing
operations discussed with police officials. A rally was scheduled
for noon the opening day of the hearings in Union Square in
San Francisco, to be sponsored by the SCL but attended also
by students of the other Bay Area colleges, as well as many
other citizens—an estimated 1000 persons, who listened to
addresses by Canon Richard Byﬁeld of Grace Cathedral, As-
semblyman John O’Connell, and Assemblyman Phillip Burton.

The students who had formed at City Hall the opening
day of the hearings and who returned after the meeting in
Union Square consisted of two elements: (1) Those who were
part of the organized picket line, and had been given instruc-
tion sheets as to the non-violent procedures they were to fol-
low; and (2) other individuals who had begun assembling
inside City Hall as early as 7 :30, expecting to be admitted to
hearings they had understood were open to the public. The
latter element became incensed when they were confronted
with an exclusionary policy on the part of the Committee.
Although there were approximately 200 people outside the
chamber anxious_to attend these public meetings, only a small
number of students were allowed to enter because 150 people
were admitted on pre-issued passes. Asked to explain these
passes, Committee Investigator Wheeler later said, “I issued
them to individuals—to keep the Commies from stacking the
meeting. We wanted some decent people in here.” As time
passed the students outside the chamber began singing and
chanting their protests, although several hundred students
were peacably picketing outside the building.

A steadily increasing explosive situation was developing
among the students who were crowded into the secondﬂoor
lobby outside the hearing room. After the noon recess a group
of subpoenaed witnesses petitioned the Committee to change
the system of admission. Their shouts of “Open up the doors”
were joined by the students, prompting more singing both
inside and outside the hearing room. The temper of the crowd
deteriorated greatly when several witnesses and spectators who
had been antagonistic toward the Committee were ejected.
Attempts were made by some to alleviate the situation: Two
students spoke to the group and were able to obtain their
attention; Sheriff Matthew Carberry told them they would
have to conduct themselves in a quieter manner and that he
would arrange to have the next day’s hearings broadcast by
loudspeakers to the plaza across the street; a leader in the
Quaker group, Berkeley Friends Meeting, known and respected
by the students, announced that he had arranged with Sheriff
Carberry to have an alternating system of admission, whereby
some of the spectators inside the hearing room would leave
during the next recess, in order that others could be admitted.
The crowd quieted and the hearings were resumed. When no
recess seemed imminent and the singing and chanting com-
menced again, this gentleman and Sheriff Carberry enlisted
approximately ﬁfty spectators to leave the hearing room, and
as ﬁfty students were allowed to enter, the crowd was subdued.
At this point, the Police Inspector in charge accused the gentle-
man of disrupting the hearings and, shaking his ﬁst, announced
this procedure of admittance would not be allowed. Inside the
chamber, the proceedings were interrupted by clapping, groans
or laughter from the audience—not only from those who were
in sympathy with the unfriendly witnesses, but at appropriate
moments from the white card holders as well. .

The same pattern of restricted admission and student
protest prevailed on Friday morning and just before the noon
break Sheriff Carberry promised the group that he would
attempt to obtain admission for all on a ﬁrst-come, ﬁrst-served
basis. When the doors were opened for the afternoon session,
however, white ticket holders were again given priority, and
the students were told only ﬁfteen of the general public would
be admitted. Their request that all admission be held up
awaiting Sheriff Carberry’s return met with an angry response
from the police inspector in charge. Eight students were ad-
mitted and the door was closed. Police report that members

5

 

of the crowd surged toward the barricaded doors, knocking
down a policeman, and that a student seized the policeman’s
club and struck him with it.

The students, on the other hand, claim that nobody
jumped the barricade; that there was a surge from the rear
of the crowd and a barricade was moved two feet, but moved
right back again. The crowd resumed singing and chanting.
They report that without warning, with no order to clear the
building, the police began to unroll hoses and the Police Inspec-
tor ordered the hoses turned on. Students say they offered only
passive resistance by sitting and folding their arms. The police
dealt with this by dragging or shoving them down the slippery
marble stairs. Police insist they used clubs only to subdue
those who resisted, but there are students who claim they were
clubbed indiscriminately and repeatedly by some of the police-
men who became unnecessarily brutal in the heat of the mo-
ment. Ironically, Sheriff Carberry was rushing back to City
Hall having obtained permission from the Committee for a
more equitable system of admittance. Had he arrived several
minutes earlier, the “riot” would have been avoided.

A total of 64 persons were arrested, all charged with riot,
disturbing the peace and resisting arrest. All cases were dis-
missed in court, with the exception of the student, whose case
has not yet come up, who was charged with striking a police-
man with a billy—a charge he has denied. Several groups de-
manded an investigation of the police handling, among them
84 members of the Stanford University faculty and 65 mem-
bers of the faculty at the Universityof California, who felt
the police had acted with “unwarranted brutality.”

There is no doubt that some of the students inside City
Hall behaved irresponsibly by becoming so noisy as to inter-
rupt court proceedings in the other chambers. Police reported
subsequently that at least two judges asked that they take
some action to enable court business to continue. This posed
a legitimate police responsibility. However, it seems clear that
they did not handle their admitted responsibilities as compe-
tently as they should have, as evidenced by the fact that the
Police Inspector placed in charge and the squad under his
command had no training in_ crowd control. The police ap-
parently did not suﬂiciently anticipate the problems that might
arise in such a provocative situation, allowed it to build up,
and then without adequate warning or direction, took the

6

drastic action which splashed the incident across the newspaper
pages of the world. Signiﬁcantly, the police instigated a course
shortly after in “mass disorders” and the handling of large
groups.

Feeling against the House Un-American Activities Com-
mittee has reached new heights in the aftermath of the occur-
rences at City Hall. The students who had been arrested
joined together to raise funds for their defense. When the
charges against them were dismissed, this group continued to
raise funds for the defense of the one remaining student facing
trial, and soon found they had an additional reason for their
continuance as an organized group: the circulation of a ﬁlm
entitled “Operation Abolition,” which was in effect created by
the Committee. A distorted account of the student demonstra-
tion, the ﬁlm has been the impetus for the evolution of this
group into a now expanded Bay Area Student Committee to
Abolish the House Committee on Un-American Activities. The
temper of the students and of the community has been sus-
tained by the necessity to defend the part they played in the
demonstrations against the allegations made by the ﬁlm.

After the hearings, the Committee subpoenaed news tapes
and ﬁlms from local radio and television stations, and turned
them over to the commercial ﬁlm company, Washington Video
Productions, to be made into a movie. The ﬁlm was then made
an official House document, and is being widely distributed at
$100 a print. According to Washington Video, 700 copies have
already been sold and the proﬁt continues to grow, despite
the fact that San Francisco television stations were never re-
imbursed for the ﬁlm. Although there are no credits introdug:
ing the ﬁlm, it decidedly gives the appearance of a government
documentary as statements from Chairman Walter and Com-
mittee members, Congressmen August E. J ohansen and Gor-
don H. Scherer, are interspersed with the narrative. The viewer
is left with the impression that there was no opposition to
HUAC in San Francisco that was not Communist-inspired and
Communist-led. To those involved in the fracas, and to many
who earlier had joined in public protests against the Commit-
tee’s visit, this is a deliberate distortion.

Committee Investigator Wheeler appeared on a television
show in Los Angeles, and, responding to the charge that ‘/‘the
ﬁlm has inaccuracies and distortions,” said “I’ve admitted
that.” Chairman Walter has since attempted to justify Mr.
