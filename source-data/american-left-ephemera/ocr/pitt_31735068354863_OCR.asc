Today, in this year of war,
1945, we have learned lessons—-
at a fearful cost—and we shall
profit by them. ‘

We have learned that we can-

. not live alone, at peace; that otlr

‘ well-being is dependent on the
well-being of other Nations, far
away. We have learned that we‘
must live as men» and not as
ostriches, nor ‘as dogs in the
manger. _ , " .

We have learned to be citizens
of the world, members of the hu-
man community. We have
learned the simple truth, as Ern-
erson‘ said, that, “The _only way
to have a friend is to be one.”

We can gain no lasting peace
if we approach it with suspicion
and mistrust-—or with fear.

(Special to THE =UNlONl

“Once you back down, your enemies
‘ -will walk all over you,” Thurgood Mar-
shall, counsel to the NAACP, told the’
', eighth convention of the CIO Packing-
house Workers in Denver last week.
Marshall called upon the packillg
delegates to carry an aggressive fight
V againstthe “Dixiecrats, whether they
are in the North or in the South.” Seg-
. regatipnfhe charged, is being promoted
all over the country because reactionary
forces “want to keep the‘N9g1‘0 in 311
inferior status and because they want
to keep Negro and white from getting
together.” _ ' ’
Acknowledging that some unions do

_not recognize equal rights for their ~

members he asserted: “Anti-Negro is
anti-labor and vice versa—you can't
tell the difference.”
Marshall slapped at the presidential
aspirants, saying: “No Negro is ever
going to vote for a general. They cer-
tainly won't vote for a man who is
quiet on civil rights. The record of
Robert Taft is clear, and you can be
sure we are not going to vote for him
either.”, i , A
IN A FULL day’s discussion on civil
rights, the convention, one-third Negro,
voted to strengthen the union’_s anti-
discrimination clause carried in all its.
‘contracts with the packing companies.
They adopted a resolution condemn-
‘ ing the Smith-Walter Act, the McCar-
ran Act, with a particular, attack on
the building of concentration camps.
Federal legislation for fair employ-
, ment practices, abolition of poll-taxes,
and anti-lynch measures were de-
manded by the convention. They also
protestedthe racist activities of the
Malan government in South Africa and
called upon the United Nations and
‘ President Truman to publicly conde
these. “atrocities.” A I
With an eye toward contract negoti-
ations this August the delegates ‘voted
for a wage program to include a guar-
anteed annual income, .30 cents an hour
wage boost, union shop and a pension
and welfare fund to be entered jointly

When negotiations with the giant oil
companies broke down, the oil unions
took strike votes, which resulted in
overwhelming margins in favor,‘ and
set a strike date in January. ,

As_ the date for strike drew near,
President Truman‘ certified the “dis-
pute” to the Wage Stabilization Board,

and the unions called off the strike, and‘

agreed to present their case before the
Board. In the weeks that followed, the
unions spent thousands of dollars in

DOUGLAS, Arizona-—The Mine—Mill
local here, Southern Arizona Smelter-
men’s Union, Local 4'70, is preparing
to do an all-out mobilization job in this
year’s bargaining drive. The members
know they can do it, because they did
a bang-up job last year.

Not only that, but Local 470 fol-
lowed up with a banquet to show its
appreciation to some of those who
had helped pressure for favorable ac-
tion on our cases py the Wage Stabli-
zation Board.

Thc banquet was held a few days
before Christmas. It was the talk of
thetown for some time~—until some-
thing else happened, which the work-
ers interpreted as the Phelps Dodge
Company’s counter-move.

THIS STARTED with a front page
editorial in the Douglas Dispatch'urg-
ing that people read a reprint of . the
CIO. “trial” charges against our union.
This was accompanied by wild charges
against Mine-Mill leadership.

Two days later, Local 470 placed a
paid advertisement in the Dispatch,
challenging the editor to debate “on

the issues raised by your paper” in and

open meeting.‘ The editor refused to
debate thetissues, but replied byyagain

‘urging that people read the CIO smear. ,

This was followed by motions on the
floor of the Elks and the American Le-
gion here—both motions by the same

‘,_rnan—praising the paper for its at-

tacks against the union. _
THE OFFICERS of Local 470 went
into action. Vice-President C. A- San-

chez wrote statements to both Elks‘

and Legion. That for the Elks was
presented at a meeting of that lodge
,,by.'Loca1 President G. B. Chaney. It
pointed out the unfairness of‘ attack-
ing ' another organization without
bothering to know what they were talk-
ing about. “You have violated one_of
thelmost sacred principles of our de-
mocracy,” the statement said.

. Sanchez himself presented his state-

were to be here to, assist the local union
committee. Int’1 rep. Arthur Flores,
who is stationed here, will take part.

In earlier negotiations, the union
committee won ‘agreement on, a very
gogodpcontract, butlwias unable to reach
a settlement on wages. The? company

‘ offered an increase equal to what Mine-
lMill locals won last year, before the
-workers‘ here were part of our‘ union.
This was rejected by the union because_

it would perp_etuate the lower scale

‘which has been in effect here for years.

The lower scale resulted from AFL
policies of not fighting for benefits and

of conniving at discrimination against_ '
"Mexican-American ‘workers. I

In the next isue of THE UNION we
will carry a feature article on this. new

and important local union.

rate of $9% billion, more than double
the amount paid in 1944.

 

ment to the Legion. He pointed out
that the smelter workers are Douglas
people, known for years to the Legion
members. Why, he demanded, did you
see fit to jump on the bandwagon, call-
ing names against your friends without
stopping to think; why do you follow
a “me too’ policy?

SANCHEZ REFUTED the dishonest
charge that Int’l President Clark had
called a strike without a vote of the
membership. “For whose benefit are
these motions of censure being adopt-
ed?”' Sanchez asked. “Why this sud-
den. interest in our welfare? Why is
this interest expressed only in attacks
to divide us from our leaders?”

The net result has been an increased
respect for the smeltermen’s union
among the people of this community.
Local 470 moves into this year’s bar-
gaining program knowing‘ that when
community support is called for it will
be there—ready to be heard.

Bruce Barton says .

NEW YORK--Bruce Barton, one of ‘

in America, believes we should “make

long time, and that we ‘must be smart .

Barton, who for a number of years
was Republicanl‘Congressman from a
“blue-stocking” districtin New York,
wrote an article recently for the Sun-

both President Truman and the Pent-

“monopolize their thinking, planning
and spending.”

  Tooele local builcliligi 

a big new union hall

TOOELE, Utah—-The fine new Mine-
Mill Union hall here isn’t quite com-
pleted‘ yet, because the members of
Local 55 believe in working on a“‘pay-
as-you-go” basis.

But the $18,000 hall is far anough
along so that the local was able to hold
its first big affair there recently—a
“house-warrningi’ party attended by
some 200 members.  ‘

The main hall in the building, which
is located at 57 E. Vine str¢et -in Tooele,
has a seating capacity of. 350, and
will be use both as a meeting place
and for dances and other local union
and community affairs. .

The__ basement, not yet completed,
will be used as a recreation lounge.

Leaders of the local are confident ‘
they’ll,be able to ‘complete all the work _

on the hall before fall/. "

LOCAL 55 credits its hard-working 
conscientious local officers‘, including‘

financial secretary ._Jim, Sullivan -P.-’:1,11d
president “‘Hy” Jordan,"with furnish-

ing“ mostly of the “push” to build their"

union hall. Six years ago, the local was
$2,200 in debt. Today, its debts are all
paid and it has"a sizable bank balance
aswell as its new hall, all work on

- .which has been paid for to date. »

Hy Jordan tells how several years
ago Angelo Verdu, then leading the

Progressive Metalworkers’ C o u n c i l_
' raids and now a raider for the C10
1 Steelworkers, tried to start a seces-

sion movement in Tooele. . ;
“When I got wind of that,” Hy says,

“I put on my hat and went over to
Yerdu’s office in Salt Lake City. I.-told
him to let me"talk first—and then I'd
listen to him. I talked about an hour.
and a half_ and when I got through
didn’t have much to say. ’
, “I TOLD HIM: “You’ve put a lot of
people out on a limb, and we in Local

55 don’t intend to be put on a limb. If 

you cut us off from our brothers in‘ the
ACM locals in Montana, that's jus
where we’d be—on a limb.’ e V

he, I

“ ‘We’ve got a_chain-wide bargaining ' ‘
council in Anaconda. and it’sidone a_ lot — -
for us—more than we could get any!'__

other way. And we’re going to keep
that council—-in Mine-Mill’.”

“Well,” Hy concludes, “after I made 

‘that trip to Salt Lake, Verdu. never’~

came back. ‘so that was the end of tho;,_.,~V: _
secession movement that never got off 

the groundin Tooele.”  _

‘ fairs, contributing heavily to the Boy

TOOELE, Utah—Harry Smith was
one of the first‘ workers to take ad-
vantage of Mine~Mill’s new pension
plan with-Anaconda Copper Mining Co.

The plan has only been in effect a

Harry is 78 years old. He worked for

During most of those years he was an

 ,,lI.ois Anceles cops  
indicted for boeatingos

LOS ANGELES, Calif._——The Ipeople
of thi city are aroused over a series
of shocking exposures of police brutal-
ity, climaxed by revelations made in a
2,300-page report of “a grand _jury
which has been probing the police de-
partment. , .

The grand jury indicted eight cops,
including a ‘lieutenant, for “assault
with force likely to do great. bodily
harm”—a felony. The indictments grew
out of a bloody “Christmas party” at
the central police station—-where seven
youths were beaten until the floor of
the station locker room became slip-
pery with their blood.

The seven youths had been arrested

A for “disturbing the peace” in a tavern

. brawl. More than 100 cops were in the

- brought in. V
V He said the frightened youths were
, passed from one policeman to another,

station, enjoying a Christmas drinking
party. A news photographer who told
the; grand jury he was "telephoning
from a booth at the station, described
what happened when the youths were

each officer beating them in turn. One
cop shouted: “I got to get,me one!”

. Another said: “This one is mine!”

The grand jury also recommended

I departmental discipline for every ser-
. geant and lieutenant present at the

. police department in”.gener,a,l. LWhi1e the

voters may continue to express their right to Vote!
" ' On. the one hand is the Montana Industrial Health Committee,
ch Mine-Mill played an important part in helping to start. The

Committee is ‘circulating a petition‘ aimed at putting on the ballot

-’ Backing the Industrial Health Committee is the broadest ‘‘'coali-» ”

Eowerful Mine-Mill locals in Montana,

ut the AFL State Federation of Labor, '

variety of local groups.
’ Strenuously opposing the Industrial

GREAT FALLS, Mont. -— Mine-Mill
was well representedpat a hearing held
by the Missouri Valley Basic Commis-
sion here last Week. II. S. Senator James
Murray acted as chairman of the Com-
mission, which was appointed by Presi-
dent Truman to determine a plan for

ending the disastrous yearly floods in-

the Missouri Valley.

The hearing room in the Cascade
County courthouse was packed with
spokesmen from trade union, farm and
other organizations around the state.
Support generally was for a TVA-type
set-up, under which a single. agency
located [in the Missouri‘ Valley would be
given: sole authority for planning and

developing‘ flood control, power genera- V

tion and distribution, and navigation.

hearing were Stanley Babcock, secre-

tims of silicosis, arsenic poisoning and

other dread ‘diseases common to metal

mining, milling and smelting. 0
AS MATTERS now stand, provision

for a silicotic worker is .made in a sepa— .
rate law, under which he can get only .

$50 from the state’s Public’ Welfare
funds. This means not only that the
taxpayer is forced to pay for relief of
silicosis victims, but that the benefits
are totally inadequate. Thus, most sili-

cotic workers are forced to apply for “V

relief, which puts an additionafburden

on the taxpayer. V 1
‘‘That’s unfair—both to, the taxpayer

and to the silicotic worker,” the Mon-

‘ tana Industrial“ Health Committee con-
tends. Their solution would be to place
silicosis and other industrial diseases’

under Workmens’ Compensation and ‘to

raise'7 the benefits to the same $38-a-'

week top provided for other disabilities
resulting from industrial hazards. That

way, they say, the ‘employer would bear-

»the burden of insurance against sili-

cosis hazards, as he should. ,
They also point out that occupational

diseases come under Workmens’ com-

I pensation laws:-. in 42 of the 48 states.

WASHlNG'1‘UN.—-A new “Smith Act"——a bill that would empower-
the government to seize labor unions when they strike-—-has been in-
d in Congress. It is in the form of amendments to the Univer-

' '. Military Training and Service Act. For this reason it went for

I earings to the House Armed Services Committee, where hearings -

were started May 7, only a week after it was filed.
" This unusual speed was only one indication of. strong support for

gbfrom ‘business and Army spokesmen. Defense Secretary Robert A.~

vett was the star witness» for the measure. .

This is the worst labor bill ever presented to Congress. It would

' ’ iuspend the N orris-LaGuardia act's anti-injunction provisions, speed up

present procedures of the Taft-
__I-Iartley law, broaden aPP11Cat1_°n
’ f ‘T-H injunctions, ‘and p_I'o,V1de
‘er indefinite “receivership of
anions whose diSpl1teS_haYe not

teen settled after expiration of
 80-day T-H injunction. V

; “Receivership” is a polite W01‘d
' or. government seizure. The “re-
’ eiver” would have complete con-
” A “receiver”
would also be appbinted for the
struck company, but would be
forbidden to change wages, hours
or other conditions or to do any-

  
 

thing that would affect profits. 
f The company would be com-_

pletely protected from union

. pressure, while the union would

be forbidden to take any action.
lI‘he union members would be un-
der virtual military 0 rd ers to
stay on the job under the same
‘ages and conditions as before

u

at

the strike.  
 In a feeble pretense of fairness,
the bill forbids a company under

A , receivership to lockout its work-

ers. The company, of course,

srivould have no reason for a ‘lock-

,"ut. It would have exactly what
' wanted —— profits guaranteed,
workers’ collective bargaining
power suppressed by the govern-

ment.
AFL, CIO and other labor or-
have m a d e the

_trongest p r o t e s t s in years

Qd out that it is patterned after
the Mussolini-Hitler type “labor-

Same SmifA »

Rep. Howard W. Smith, Democrat of

Virginia, author of the Smith bill for"

government seizure of striking unions,
is the same Smith who introduced the
thought control act" bearing his name.
It is underthe Smith act of 1940 that
witch-hunting "trials are being con-
ducted—-that regional director Jack
Hall-of the Longshore Union was ar-
rested while leading negotiations for
30,000 Hawaiian sugar workers.

The_anti-labor character of the Smith ‘

act of 1940 is pointed up by introduc-
tion of the Smith bill of 1952. The

same man was co-sponsor of the in-
famous Smith-Connolly act. All major ,

labor .. organizations are on record

against "all of Smith's fascist—type bills."

STATEMENT OF WILLIAM GREEN, AFL PRESIDENT:

“In-all my years as President of the American Federation of
Labor I have seldom seen a more shocking proposal than that

contained in the SmithLBil1. . 

“. . . totalitarianism at its worst could do no more to
usurp individual rights . . . than does this proposal. . . ; If, in

the-' name of defense, the very situation which I thought we
were defending against is permitted, indeed prescribed, what,
may I ask, is the sense in_ continuing to expend vast sums and
great energies for defense against an outward foe when the,
inward foe has already accomplished all that we had hoped to

guard against?”

STATEMENT OFAJOSEPH CURRAN, CIO VICE PRESI-
DENT, FOR THE CIO: “This bill simply resolves all of the
issues in favor of the employer and against the union. _. . .

“I think" that there is even more ‘at stake here than the "
continued existence of free trade unions in America: I think
this bill threatens the existence of our American democratic
‘system. . . .,I do not go too far when Isay that this is a bill
to destroy the trade union movenient.”
