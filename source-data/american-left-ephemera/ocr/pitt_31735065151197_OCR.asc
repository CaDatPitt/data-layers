DENVER. Colo.--A momentous series of events for Mine-Mill” has taken
place during the past two ‘weeks. Here they are in the order they occurred:

ON Februaryl. the National Labor Relations Board issued
an order revoking the compliance status of the International
Union under section 9 lhl of the Taft-Hartley act. Thiswas

in response to a complaint by Precision Scientific Company

of Chicago. claiming, that Travis‘ nylon-Communist affidavits
were false and the entire membership of the Union knew they

_were false. B " A T

‘K.

At the same time. Travis asserted: a  ‘-

_‘ "I do not acknowledge that there is the slightest founda-

bership." ‘ -

The Mine-Mill Board. in accepting Travis’ resignation "with

“At long last the shin-

here that “It should be clear to

“They might ‘now be doing

contradicted the testimony of
Matusow and,othe1's like him.”

Ayala was re‘ferring to a hear-
ing in October, 1952, of the In-

the Senate Judiciary Committee.
A score of Mine-Mill leaders
were put on the stand during

of resignation
The resignation of Brother M. E. Travis as Secre-

tary-Treas_urcr was submitted to P7'e.s-idcnt Clark in the,
letter reprinted below.

Travis was first elected to office in Mine-Mill in ‘
1.9.46, and began a termeasi Vice President in 19.47. He.
succeeded to the Presidency that year, upon resignation
of Reid Robinson. At the 1.947 convention, Travis was
a candidate for Secretary-Treasurer, to which post he.
was elected. He has been re-elected at each succeeding
International referendum.

February 14, 1955» ,
To President Clark:

This is my resignation from the office of Secretary-
Treasurer of the International Union ofiMine, Mill and
Smelter Workers. This
action is necessitated
by an order of the
Taft-Hartley Labor
Board which denies our
Union the right to par-
ticipate in ‘election and
use other facilities of
the N. L. R. B.

I have always taken
the position that I will
not stand in the way of
our Union’s right to
protect itself against
its enemies. I have
taken this grave step
only after the most
careful thought and
widest discussion with
the rank and file and
leaders of the Union.
By resigning, I do not ~ — _
acknowledge that there is the slightest foundation, either
for the charges made against me and the Mine—M ill mem-
bership byhthe employer—dominate’d Labor Board, or for
the indictment which still is pending in Denver. ,

I intend to continue making the maximum contribu-

tion I am able to the life and work of our Union. My \

resignation must_notbecome a signal of retreat from the
traditional, militant, democratic trade unionism. which
has marked the course of our history -as a union. i

I express my deepest admiration and gratitude» to
my fellow Officers and Board Members for their courage
and willingness to place the interests of the Union above
personal interests. I urge my dear friends and associ-
ates among the rankand file of the Union to unite around
the leadership of the International Executive Board and
the new Secretary-Treasurer.

I especially express my deep regard for you, Brother
Clark, with Whom I have worked so closely over the
years, for having stood solidly beside me in the face of
every‘ kind of harrassment and attack. “'

‘Reluctant decision

This reluctant decision has

been forced upon us by the illegal
action‘ of the employer-dominated
N. L. R. B. in removing our union
from compliance. The N. L. R. B.

I, move was calculated to weaken
I our union on the eve of 1955 ne-
,‘ gotiations. K '

Year after year, our union has
wrung major concessions from
the copper and other metal cor-
porations in this country and
Canada on behalf of _ our mem-
bership.

 Rather than permit the issue

of compliance to be a weapon in ’

the hand of the employers and
to expose this union toievery

we have accepted Brother Travis’
resignation. .

We are the same union today

which look to a World» at peace

The members of our union
will now understand the kind of
forces behind the attacks and in-

, dictment of Brother Travis more

clearly than ever before.

The fact he has resigned the
office of Secretary-Treasurer has
no bearing on Sieps this union is

‘I taking to expose and defeat the
vicious N. L. R. ‘B. order which ,

charges him and the union's en-
tire membership with a conspir-

has been engaging in an obvi-

ously illegal attempt at thought- '

mined-that the N. L. R. B. shall be

DENVER—The Mine-Mill Executive Board has
adopted the recommendation of general counsel,
Nathan Witt, that A. T. Hannett of Albuquerque,
N. M., and Harry L. Bigbee .of Santa Fe be re-

tained as special counsel for Clint Jencks. They '— - I ' I

will present Jencks’ motion‘ for a new trial in the

federal district court in El _Paso, Texas, based on

an affidavit by Harvey Matusow that he testified
falsely against Jencks in January, 1954. I

Mr. Hannett and Mr. Bigbee are among New
Mexico’s best-‘known lawyers. Mr. Hannettt was
Governor of the state in th_e.20’s and has been active
professionally and politically since that time. Mr.
Bigbee is a former attorney general of the state
and a judge ofrthe state district court by appoint-
rnent. of ex-Governor John Dempsey. '

Although Governor Hannett and Judge Bigbee
have been on the same side in many legal matters,
this is the first time they will be associated together
since they were on opposite sides in the 1952 Sena-
torial contest. In the post-election challenge by Pat
Hurley against Senator Chavez’ election, Governor

Hannett represented Senator Chavez, and Judge

Bigbee represented Mr. Hurley.

In the Jencks case, Governor Hannett and Judge

Bigbee will be associated with Nathan Witt and — . —

with E. B. Elfers of the El Paso bar. Jencks’ mo-

adopted at a special meeting last Week. _ _ ‘

The entire leadership of the South Georgia Fertlhzer

full discussion of the NLRB ruling that Mine-Mill was

out ofcompliance. It said the
Board has “tried to dictate to
our union whom we shall, or
shall not, elect  of:t'icers.”

A In addition to condemning the
NLRB action, the meeting reaf-
firmed “the pledges we took
when becoming members of this

$1.25 minimum waigebillc

VVASHINGTON ._ President Eisenhower tried in

‘ his State of the Union and economic messages to chisel

down labor’s demand for a $1.25 an hour minimum wage
to 90 cents an hour. But he is getting emphatic answers
both from liberal members of Congress and from organ-

ized labor.

At least four bills have been introduced to make the

boost to $1.25.

Senator James Murray, Montana Democrat, intro-
duced a measure not only to raise the wage floor to $1.25,
but also to increase coverage of workers by the wage law

Ike
economics

If the minimum wage
law went above 90 cents
an hour, it would be bad
for the American economy,
President Eisenhower told
Congress last week.

90 cents an hour for 40'
hours means $36 a week
——-before deductions.

If the $1.25 a week mini-
mum urged by nnions were
enacted, it would mean $50
a week, before deductions.

Say that a gain, Mr.
President. Who would be
hurt if some employers
had to pay a worker more
than $36 a week?

Milne-hlil] played ilnporlant part in F
l“atIs0w’s exposure of ‘witness’ racket

DENVER—-—The Mine-Mill Executive Board, while it was in session here last
weelieiid, adopted a resolution calling attention to the fact that our Union played an
“important role” inconnection with the Matusow confessions. I

The Board pointed out that as far back as last September, the International offi-
cers “authorized Nathan Witt, our general counsel, to take legal and other legitimate
steps to assist in the publication of Matusow’s confessions so that justicefor Brother
Clinton Jencks could be obtained and so that the members of the International Un-
ion and the American people would know the truth about the malicious slanders
against this Union in recent years.”

Direct result

The motion for a new trial in the Jencks case which was filed in El Paso last
month “is a direct result of this action of our officers in September,” the Board said.
Declaring that “the most searching public investigation into this issue” of pro-
fessional witnesses is called for, the Board said that “such an investigation cannot
properly be conducted by the Department of Justice before Grand Juries or by other

secret investigations.”

to join Mine-Mill in request-
ing the Senate Judiciary
Committee “to undertake
this task without delay.”
This committee has the
power of subpoena and can

Justice for Jencks

The Board resolution in
effect claimed some credit
to Mine—l\/[ill for the facts
that “not only is it now
possible to secure justice
for Brother Jencks, but the
self-exposure by Matusow
is leading to a re-examina-
tion of the role of so-called
professional witnesses in
fingering innocent people
and organizations.”

“The administration of
justice in our courts and

. the procedures of Congres-
sional oommittees should
be vastly improved as a re-
sult,” the Board com-
mented. 

to between 9 and 12 million more
workers. Murray’s bill would
also set the maximum’ work
week without overtime at 3'7’/6'
hours in 1957 and to 35 hours
by 1959. —
Representative Lee Metcalf
(D, Mont.) introduced a compan-
ion measure to .Vlu_rray’s in the
House. Other_ $1.25 minimum
wage bills have been introduced

. by Senator Herbert Lehman and

Representatives Abraham Mul-
ter, Daniel Flood and Frank
Tho'mpson.

Meantime, labor sources point-
ed to government .l’igu.res to
answer _l’res.ident Eisenhower’s
argument that a raise to more

than 90 cents an hour might ,

cause unemployment. A recent
Labor Department survey shows
that when the wage floor was
jumped from 40 cents to 75
cents in 1950, the change had
“only minor effects on 'employ-
ment.”

Many Republicans from New
England states are lining up be-
hind a move to make the jump

< to $1 an hour. One is Sen. Wil-

Iiam Purtell, Connecticut Repub-
lican.

All of this makes it look as’
though some kind of compromise
between the President’s 90 cents
and the $1.25 demanded by labor
will be passed at this session of
Congress.

Methodist Church
Board hits UMT

CINCINNATI, Ohio —~ The
MQthodist Church's Board of
World Peace has called on the
9 million Methodists in the U. S.
to oppose “any system, by what‘-
ever name it may be called, that
would fasten upon the American

'people a continuing and uni-

versal system of military train-
ing.» /

The Board specifically hit the
new UMT proposals made by
Defense Secretary Wilson, which
it said‘ “should be seen clearly
for what they are; an entering
wedge for a universal military
training program.”

“In reality,” it said, “there
are no ‘volunteers’ under these
proposals. Every man who ‘vol-
unteers’ does so oiily in pref-
erence to being drafted for two
full years of military service.
Nearly all young men would

'come under military control for’

a period of eight to teniyears.”

African strikers

DENVER ;— Forty thousand
copper. miners in Northern Rho-

desia, on stri-ke since January‘

3, have been sent fraternal greet-
ings by President John Clark on
behalf of our Union.

“We are shocked," wrote
President Clark in a letter to
.Matthew Nkoloma. general
secretary of the Northern Rho-
desia African Mineworkers’ Un-
ion, “to learn of the starvation
wages being paid the workers in
the face of the tremendous
profits being realized by the
mining corporations.”

Clark was referring to the re-
port that 86 per cent of the Afri-
can miners earn only seven
pounds five shillings a month
($20.30 in American money).

“On behalf of our union,” he
said, “will you convey our fra-
ternal greetings to the strikers
and express to them our hope
that their just demands will be
speedily achieved.” ‘

O

The main point about Matusow is that he is not an individual phenom-
enon. Peoplelike him were called for by the nature of the witch-hunt, and
they appeared. When thekjob at hand is to tell a big lie, liars are needed
to do the work. ‘ « ‘

Paul Crouch has been exposed as an’ habitual liar. Dave Brownconfessed
being a stoolpigeon and said, “I’m a rat- I’m going to kill myself-” Whit-
tatkler Chambers said, “The professional witness is. not a man. He has no will
of is own.” ' ‘ ' ‘

Clark wrote the Congressmen. “It provesthe statement

_ ‘the informer is a publicaccuser, yet we have strong ~

reason to believe that some informers who have traduced

Matusow not only’ confessed to his own lying--he told how “testimony”
was tregularly made to order, for congressional committees, grand juries and
cour ‘s. . . . . _ ..
Had the Justice Department been interested in justice rather than<con-
victions, its reaction to the Matusow confession would have been quite differ-
ent. The department has shown only a fear that some of those convicted
with Matusow’s help might now get out of their clutches. ~

Interviewed by United Press, Matusow made a com- __

Lattimore, whose books he once claimed were used as  =’
the “official Communist'Party line on Asia.” “Actually,” 

he told UP last week, “I had no knowledge of that.”

The Justice D epartment, which has repeatedly
brought Matusow to the witness standto point the finger,
tried to pooh-pooh the importance of his new confessions.
They said his testimony had only been used to “corrobo-
rate” the testimony of others. .-

~ ' But Rep. Francis Walter, Peiinsylvaiiia Democrat and
chairman of the House un-American Activities Commit-
tee, admitted Matusow’s testimony “may have tipped the
scales” against innocent persons. It was recalled that
when attorneys for Jencks_ filed a photostatic co y of 
letter from U. S. Attorney Charles Herring to l.\ atusow
declaring that Matusow’s testimony was “absolutely es-
sential” for conviction of Jencks.

'Subpoened in El Pose‘

Matusow was subpoenaed to appear before the grand
jury in New York City, and Federal Judge R. E. Tliornason
told reporters in El Paso that the ex-witness would “like-
ly” be brought to face a rand jury there. Judge Thoma-
son, who presided over t e Jencks trial, has before him
the defense motion for a new trial, based i_n part on the
Matusow affidavit that he lied under oath against Jencks.
He has set March 7 as the date on which he will hear
arguments on the motion.

Matusow was subpoenaed by the Senate Internal
Security sub—committee, now headed by Senator Eastland ~
of Mississippi. He was to appear Tuesday, February 15. o"l‘I -~ ‘
While he was still a professional witness, l\'latusow testi- - "3

What is clear is that he ('l.\'latusow) should 
never have been regarded  a pillar of so-
ciety by the Justice Department, the FBI,
the assorted Congressional super-Sleuths who
listened so credulously to him and the news-' '
papers which gave him page-one productions...

Possibly it is time that government agen-
ciesslnd-Congressional committees began _
scre . ing their major witnesses with some of
the zeal heretofore applied to government
clerks. _

too many racketeers have i.nfiltr_ated the
democratic defense against Communism, and
top many Americans have succumbed to the
View that anything goes under the banner of
anti-communism.

The star chamber hear-

abolished in 1641. Yet to-

individuals who are called

bunals which deny the ac-

the right of cross-examina-

Pressure rises against

 U. S. Chamber of Commerce,
the newly-organized “National Right
To Work Committee,” and other c_or-
ration-backed lobbies are pouring
arge sums of money into campaigns
for “right to,scab or starve” bills 111
many states around ‘thexcountry.

But the going is_ rough, mainly be-
cause all of organized labor is doing
a. big job of fighting back to stop
passage of such laws. ~

Labor is helped in its fight-back
campaign by the fact that eight of
the Governors who were elected last
fall are pledged to oppose this kind Of
legislation. _

Only one new governor——Repub1_1ca_n
Robert Smylie of Idal1o—lras indi-
cated that he is in favor of Flghli 130

New governors who. had antl-1'1ght'
to-scab planks in their elect1o_n plat-
forms include: Knight of Callfolmlag

arve’ laws

Johnson of Colorado, Ribicoff of Con-
necticut, Hall of Kansas, Hoegh of
Iowa, Freeman of Minnesota‘, Gary of
Oklahoma, and Patterson of Oregon.
There are growing signs that labor’s
educational work exposing these laws
is beginning to pay off. The Denver

Post and Rocky Mountain N ews—-both.

otherwise extremely conservative
papers—-came out strongly against
“right to starve” legislation when bills
were introduced in the Colorado as-
sembly last month. '
“There is no apparent need for any
‘right to work’ legislation—— in‘ fact
for any state legisl.ation seeking to
govern management—labor relations,”
said the News, a
paper. ~
But while Mine-Mill and other un-
ions were combatting such bills, the
labor movement was also busy in the
even bigger campaign to win repeal
of “rightto wreck” laws in the 17
states where they have been passed.

To ‘the Editor:

Faith in democracy

 
   
  

The Geneva Conference, the
Korean Truce and several unani-
mous agreements in the United
Nations have disapproved the
theory that “force is the only
thing the communists can un-
derstand.” Unfortunately the
current pro-war statements of
Admiral Radford, Senator

Knowland, and their supporters.’

still give the impression that
force is the only thing we know
h.ow to use.

The press could help disprove
the theory by putting less em-
phasis on United Nations dis-
agreements and on impatient
speeches of those who reject the
idea of peageful co-existence,
with more emphasis on United
Nations agreements and
achievements and on speeches
of those who, like President
Eisenhower, have accepted the
idea of peaceful co-existence,

late President F. D. Roosevelt, has introduced a bill to
repeal section 14b of the Taft—Hartley law. That’s the
section which allows thestates to pass the mis—called
“right to work” laws, which ban union security agree-

ments. A

Young Roosevelt was elected last fall in California.
He went to work here with vigor in the midst of a- na-
tionwide campaign by organized labor to get the open‘

shop laws repealed in the 17
states where they have been

passed and to prevent enactment-

in 14 other states where they are
pending. it ‘

He pointed out that states
have used 14b of Taft-Hartley
“to prevent the exercise of such
rights as the union shop and
maintainance of membership.
The purpose of states in the
enactment of so called right to
work statutes is to produce low
wage laws.”

MEANTIME, a new organiza-
tion devoted to promoting the
“right to scab” laws was
launched under leadership of
Fred Hartley, who co—authored_

and plead for patience, under-
standing, and enough faith in
democracy to expect it to hold
its own in peaceful competition
with other systems.

part to carry the fight against
a “right—to—starve” bill in the
Missouri legislature.

The local has voted to send
two members to the state capi-
tol at Jefferson City as soon as

‘the “right—to—scab-or starve” bill

comes up for debate in the state
assembly.

the Taft—Hartley law. The form-
er anti-labor congressman from
New Jersey set up offices in
Washington, backed by anti-la-

bor big businessmen with a scat- ‘

tering of defeated, anti-labor
politicians.

Wingate Lucas, former Demo-
cratic congressman from Texas
who introduced many viciously
anti-union bills, is a. member of
the temporary board of direc-
tors. He is also now a member
of the law firm of Lucas, Poole,
Shroyer and Denbo. The Poole
of the firm is “Ruthless Rufus,”
who represents the big potash

WASHINGTON -——- Se ha hecho una dernanda a todo rniembro de la Casa y Senado
par auna investigacion Congresional spbre la profesién del informador Matusow por
el Presidente de Mine-Mill, John Clark. . _,

La carta del Presidente Clarke fue acompaﬁada con cuatro paginas de articulos
sacados de la ultirna edicion del MINE—MILL UNION dando detalles de la confesion

de Harvey Matusow que él mintio bajo juramento

en El Paso.
“Nosotros estamos se-
guros de que esta sera una

historia sensaci6na'l,”' es-l

criloio el Presidente Clark a
los miembros del Congreso.
“Esto no solo es prueba de
que los 17 clerigos Protes-
tantes y Judaicos tenian ra-
zon en decir que el informa-
dor e r a un denunciador
publico pero tambien tene-

‘mos razon en decir que al-

gunos de los informadores
que han testificado con-
tra varios cludadanos han
mentido tambien.
“Urgen1o—s 1'espetosamen-
te que tal investigacion por
los Comites del Congreso
observen cuidadosamente y

criticalmente toda pala.bra— .

de testimonio dada por los

testigos professionales en,
los ultimos aﬁos respectivos

igual que los métodos usa-)
dos por las agencias del go-

bierno para obtener y usar

sus servicios-”

La carta del Presidente
tomo su lugar con las ex-
iposiciones _.editoriales .-de
varios periodicos.

Matusow ademas de su
declaracion jurada en el

‘case do J encks hizo otra de-

claracion testificando que
haloia tamloien mentido loajo
juramento en una causa del
‘i‘S1‘nith Act” en Nueva
York en 19:32. Dijo él que
Roy COl‘11’1, ayuolante y con-

‘ sejero del Senador Joe Mc-
‘ Carthy, le habia instriiido

que dijiera en esa causa.

EN UNA ENTREVISTA
con United Press, Matusow
hizo un cambio comp1eta-
Inente (liferente al que ha-
bia hecho a n t e s tocante

‘Owen La ttim ore, quienes

libros dijo él fueron usados
Como una guia Comunista '
tocante la Osia.” “Actual-
Inente,” dijoél a UP, “yo no
sabia nada de eso.”

El Departamento de Jus-
ticia, quienes repetidas Ve-
ces han puesto a Matusow
para testificar en contra de
persbnas ahora quieren
hacer a un lado las nuevas
confesiones (le Matusow co-
mo algo de ninguna impor-
‘tancia. Ellos dicen que el
‘testimonio de Matusow solo

‘fue usado para corroborar

el testimonio de otros.

Pero el representante
Deinocrata y presidente del
Comite de actividades N o
americanas de Pennsylva-
nia, Francis Walter, admitio
que el testimonio de Ma-
tusow podia haber sido fal-
so. Fue recordado que cu-
ando los abogados para la
defensa de Jencks present-
aron la declaracion jurada

orders return   to work

TOR()N'l‘(), Ont.-~’I‘he Cana-
dian officer-s of the_United Steel
Workers of America stopped
strike assistance on January
12th for 700 striking‘ members
of their Union at the Standard
Sanitary and Dominion Radi-
ator plant here, who had been
on strike since October 21, 1954.
The Union heads, Bill Mahoney,
assistant to the Canadian di-
rector and Larry Sefton, district

director, took this drastic action

when the I-ocal’s bargaining
committee in an attempt to
force a strike settlement of the
long drawn oigtidispute, called
out plant engineers also mem-
bers of the Union.

Mahoney and Sefton inter-
vened on behalf of the manage-
ment, ordered the engineers bziglg
‘to work, stopped the strike re-
lief and brought charges against
the bargaining committee.

The Steel Union heads claimed
that the old agreement which
had expired on October 21, 1954
had made provision for main-
tenance of engineers during‘ a
strike.

The settlement providing for

In the minds of the public that
the Ford workers, members of
the United Automobile Workers

pre-strike statement of Rhys

action of the UnitediSteel work-
ers officers.

A leaflet by the local negoti-
ating committee announced their
resignation in view of the inter-
national interference, and spelled
out that the International had
failed to live up to its promise
to pay for workers group insur-
ance and stopped the local union
from appealing to local unions
outside Toronto for support.

RANK AND FILE delegates
to the Toronto Steel Union
Council, aroused by Mahoney
and Sc'l'tou’s arbitrary action,
blasted the- International action
of cutting off strike aid and de-
manded an investigation of the
International officers’ conduct
of the strike.

Faced by a rising storm of
protest, the steel union leaders
restored the strike assistance
although cI1arges- against the
local leadership are still being
processed.

compensation for silicoiic”

CALGARY, Alberta-—
Because .his union fought
for his rights, Steve Kon-
esky has been awarded a
partial disability pension of
$93.49 monthly for life,-’plus
a $1155.23 check for back
compensation due him.

Brother Konesky, a mem-
ber of Calgary Metal Work-
ers Union, Local 800, was
fired from his ‘job as a
grinder one day more than
a year ago because he faint-
ed on_ the job. The union
protested, pointing out that

Konesky was sick.

After a figlit. the case
was referred to the Work-
men’s Compensation Board,
which found that Brother
Kone-sky was suffering
from silicosis contracted on
the job. He has five chil-
dren and nine grandchil-
dren.

The case was pushed
through by Local 800, as-
sisted by International
Representative Charles
Weir. The decision award-
ing both the back pay check
and the pension for life was
finally handed downlate in
January.

 

All B. C. daily papers
suppress Mafusow story

VANCOUVER, B.C., —- Mine-
Mill members in this province
are wondering what constitutes
news to the daily press.

All papers gave full coverage
to the charges against Clint
Jencks, and to all actions by the
U. S. McCarthyitcs against the

‘International and Travis. But,

when Matusow blew the T31
works in his recantation, not a
paper had a line on it, although
all received the material sent
out from Denver.

I-Iowever, less than a week
after they made up for their

lack of Mine-Mill news. Stories
on the IRS. Lalnvr Relations
Board denial of rights to this
union were given almost em-
embarassing promi’ cnce.

On the ancient principle that
“man bites dog” is always news,
maybe the editors around here
should go back to writing obitu-
aries. Certainly, they are more
apt to favour the FBI dog biting
the union man as newsworthy
rather than any upset of the
established formula.

Incorrigibly conservative, our
RC. editors!

CCL strikes
B. C. shipyard

VANCOUVER, B. C.—~A strike
of ninety electricians has closed
the Buirrard Shipyards here for
the last two weeks, with pickets
keeping nearly 800 other men of
other trades from their jobs.

The electricians are members
of the Electrical Trades Union,
Local No. 1, affiliated with the
Canadian Congress of Labor,
and the dispute arises from re-
fusal to accept the settlement
signed by the Marine Workers
and Boilermakers Industrial Un-
ion (CCL), and the other craft
AFL unions in the yards, the
largest in the province.

The general agreement, under
joint bargaining, was for 214;
cents immediately, and another
2% cents in one year, effective
October 14, 1954. The eiectri-
cians refused to accept this by
a vote of 59 to 31, and held out
for fifteen cents, and finally
struck on the issue January 14.

THE STRIKE has posed vex-
ing problems for all the other
unions involved, since the yards
have been cutting down their
working s t r e n g th for some

months, and employment there”

two weeks ago was at a low un-
precedented since before the
war.

Some AFL unions are having
difficulty preventing their meni-
bers from walking through the
picket line, impatience with the
recalcitrance of the electricians’
leaders having reached a high
pitch. .

THE COMPANY seems as
obstinate as the union in stick-
ing to the same formula agreed
on with the other unions. and
all attempts at settlement, by
g o v e r n m e n t eonciliators and
otherwise, have so far failed.
