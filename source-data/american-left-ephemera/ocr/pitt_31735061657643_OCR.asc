America, in a highly developed industrial country, than it was in
other countries which started out on the ruins of war. They had
almost nothing but their bare hands and the bare land.

The Communist Party, U.S.A., has been advocating socialism
for the past forty years. Others have talked about it before we did.
The socialist ideal of a cooperative commonwealth of labor is not a
new thought in our country. Americans, as well as other peoples,
discussed and advocated socialism long before it came into existence
anywhere. It is not the monopoly of any country or any people.

In the last century, Edward Bellamy wrote a book, Looking
Backward, describing a socialist America in the year 2,000; it sold
in big numbers of copies in the ’80’s. The German Communist,
William VVeydemeyer, friend of Karl Marx, fought in our Civil War
and was made a colonel by Lincoln. There was a host of early
utopian colonies, set up on a socialist plan. They tried to practice
the brotherhood of man, sharing the labor and its fruits. William
Dean Howells, for many years editor of the Atlantic Monthly, ]ack
London and Theodore Dreiser were socialists. Eugene V. Debs,
leader of railroad strikes in the ’90’s, ran for President on the So-
cialist ticket regularly. In 1920 he got nearly a million votes.

There were innumerable eloquent agitators like Debs, Daniel
De Leon, Kate Richards O’Hare, Mother Jones, Ella Reeve Bloor,
Bill Haywood, Charles Ruthenberg, who toured the length and
breadth of the land. They talked socialism on soap boxes, from cart
tails, in halls to farmers and workers. There were thousands of

Eugene V. Debs was

er of the Socialist
Party. He was a can-
didate for the U.S.

times. and in I920
polled nearly a mil-
lion votes.

"Mother" Bloor. toured the country speaking for the
rights of the working people and for socialism.

such meetings, exposing the capitalist system, answering questions,
selling pamphlets. Socialist congressmen, mayors and city council-
men were elected on these principles.

Over a hundred years ago, there was a New York Communist
Club, organized by German workers in 1857, at 148 Fulton Street.
There was the Socialist Labor Party, organized in 1876; the Socialist
Party, organized in 1901; the I.W.W. (Industrial Workers of the
World), organized in 1905. There were many differences among
them. But the idea of socialism——abolition of the capitalist system
and organizing a new socialist society—was common to all. The
Communist Party was organized by the left-wing forces of the
Socialist Party, in 1919. It is the logical heir of the socialist tradi-
tions of our country. It has striven to carry them forward.

The dream of a world free from greed and tyranny is reflected
in all the historic struggles for freedom in our country. The Civil
VVar began the liberation of the Negro people. It will not be com-
pleted until they enjoy full citizenship and equality in all spheres
of life. The struggle to build labor unions began with a series of
conspiracy trials against them over a century ago. The hard-fought
efforts to win shorter hours, higher pay, better working conditions
and the closed shop, are not over. To safeguard and extend work-
ers’ rights and gains, the struggle continues. The fight for free
public schools was a people’s Victory. They are threatened today
by white supremacist fanatics, who would destroy them rather than
accept democracy for children.

VVoman suffrage extended democracy in 1920. The guarantee of
the voting rights of all Negro citizens—North and South—will ex-

tend it further. The secret ballot helped protect elections from cor-
ruption. But the right of voters to support independent parties is
still denied by repressive state legislation. So is their right to ex-
press preferences, through proportional representation.

Nothing was ever handed to the people o-n a. silver platter. Every
gain, every inch of progress, every step forward is a result of the
efforts of the people themselves. We mu.st hold on to these, defend
them against all attack, and move forward to new gains, new prog-
ress. If not, we will slide backward. There is no standing still.

The forces of Big Business are ever on the march. Why not? They“

have a comfortable existence—they never had it better. They are
determined to keep it——at our expense. Indications surround us-
increased prices, heavier taxation, higher rents, insecurity of jobs,
speed-up, short work weeks, permanent unemployment for many,'a
growing number of chronically depressed areas, thousands living on
relief and unemployment beneﬁts, “skid rows” in all our large
cities. “The poor ye have always” under capitalism, while the rich
grow ever richer.

Children die from rat bites in New York City. The New ]ersey
meadows breed bigger and ﬁercer mosquitoes. Smoke and dust
called “smog” congest our lungs. Slums are growing in all our
large cities and in some rural areas. How many Americans lack
bathtubs in their homes? How many“ still use outdoor toilets? You
can’t even count them‘ on a cross-country trip. We need more
houses, schools, colleges, hospitals, clinics, libraries, parks, recrea-
tion centers, swimming pools. We need better travel facilities-
subways, buses, trains. The “American way of life” must be for
all. The beauty of the skyline cannot obscure ﬁre traps where peo-
ple live, work and burn to death. Park Avenue’ s fabulous build-
ings cannot hide ﬁlth in backyards and empty lots. ' Yes, we need
socialism. We need it now.

The Communist Party was founded in l9|9. The convention met on September I.
A second convention held at the same time formed the Communist Labor Party.
Out of their merger grew the present Communist Party of the U.S.A.

STRUGGLE IS THE WATCHWORD

THE Communist Party was born in stormy weather. The class

struggle raged after World War I. Some 58,000 members of the
Socialist Party left it to form the Communist Party. They were
largely workers in heavy industry.

The war had been fought “to make the world? safe for democ-
racy,” they were told. At home a post-war terror was let loose against
labor unions. The American Federation of Labor fell from four
million to two-and-a-half million. An open shop drive created two
hundred and fifty company unions. Injunctions were used. against
strikers. The capitalist class was frightened by the Russian Revo-
lution. Some of the labor leaders, then as now, chimed in. An
A. F. of L. resolution of 1921 called on labor to -“combat unem-
ployment, reaction and Bolshe-vism.”

The American workers have ever been militant. They fought
back then against speedup and wage cuts. In four years, ten million
workers were on strike. Some were “outlaw” efforts like that of
200,000 railroad shopmen. The coal miners, 600,000 strong, were
hamstrung by injunctions. The textile workers of New England
fought militantly. The steel workers took up» the challenge of Judge
Cary, head of the U.S. Steel Company, that “labor unions are no
longer necessary.” Nearly 400,000 steel workers struck—led by
William Z. Foster, now Chairman Emeritus of the Communist Party.
Twenty-two workers were killed, including Mrs. Fannie Sellins,
an organizer loaned by the miners. Arrests for treason, murder
and conspiracy were made, picket lines and mass meetings broken
up, and the strike finally smashed. But in the blood—soaked steel
towns the seed of unionism was planted. It found rebirth in later

organizations of steel workers.

William Z. Foster. leader of the
tamed |9l9 steel strike. joined the
Communist Party soon after. He
was for many years its national
chairman. and now holds the
honored post of chairman emer-
itus.

Workers who were Communists were active in all these battles
of labor. The Party helped collect funds, clothing and food. It
joined too with the Socialists, paciﬁsts and I.W.W.’s to secure the re-
lease from prison of several hundred anti-war political prisoners.
An amnesty movement of such breadth and inﬂuence was created
—from Quakers to Communists—that all were freed within a few
years. The infamous Palmer raids of 1920, organized by  Mitchell
Palmer, then the Attorney General, and managed by  Edgar
Hoover (of today’s F .B.I.), rounded up hundreds of workers from
coast to coast. Under a wartime act, hundreds of foreign—born
were torn from their families and deported. Communist leaders,
like Charles Huthenberg, founder of the Communist Party, James
Larkin and others, were prosecuted under state criminal syndicalist
laws. They were given long prison sentences. Labor defense of

free speech and free assemblage became a major issue for Com-
munists and others. The right of unions and workers’ political
parties to exist was at stake.

Among those convicted under criminal syndiicalist laws was
Anita Whitney. A native daughter of California, she become a
charter member of the Communist Party and was for many years a
member of its national committee. Her family were pioneers in early
California history‘, as she was a pioneer in all progressive causes. p
She was many times a candidate for public office on the Commun- 2%
ist ticket. After her conviction, when the U.S. Supreme Court reject-

Vanzetti case into the ranks ot the Communist Party. 7

ed her appeal, she was pardoned by the Governor of California in
response to requests from hosts of people in all walks of life, partic-
ularly women.

Labor leaders and Socialists, Tom Mooney and Warren K.
Billings, had been in prison since 1916 in an infamous anti-labor
frame-up. The deportation drive was climaxed in 1920 in the frame-
up of two Italian workers in New England—Nicola Sacco and
Bartolomeo Vanzetti. They were unknown and declared them-
selves anarchists. But the international working class, regardless
of affiliation, rallied to their defense. Communists everywhere were
a devoted part of this mighty movement. But even heroic world-
wide efforts did not save these innocent men from execution in 1927.
Profoundly affected by this injustice was William L. Patterson,
a distinguished Negro lawyer, who cast his lot at that time with the
workers and the Communist Party. In all the years since, he has
been dedicated to the Negro liberation movement and civil rights
for all.

The Communist Party, in spite of all the difficulties that beset
it, participated directly in a series of important textile strikes. These
were organized by the Trade Union Educational League, set up in
1921 by William Z. Foster and others. The first in 1926, involved
16,000 in Passaic, N. ]., who were resisting‘ a 10 per cent wage cut.
Wholesale arrests and tear gas against the picket lines signalized
this strike. In 1928, in New Bedford, Mass... 26,000 struck. This
resulted in forming an independent industrial union. The most
fiercely fought strike was in Castonia, North Carolina, in 1929,
against low wages, speedup and anti-union companies. Over 100

Gastonia, North Carolina was the seat of one of the most ﬁercely ‘Fought textile
strikes in the twenties. Communists participated actively in these strikes.

 

  

were arrested, seven leaders were given long sentences (as again
happened only recently in Henderson, North Carolina). Ella May
VViggins, a mother and a strike leader, who wrote the songs which
cheered and inspired the strikers, was killed in Gastonia by com-
pany gunmen. Another outstanding woman strike leader was Ann
Burlak, a. Communist.

The Communist Party union members, especially in the needle
trades, worked hard in this period. They built up a militant ﬁght-
ing left-wing movement to cope with employers’ attacks and fight
for wages and hours. Similar rank-and-ﬁle movements were born
among the coal miners under the slogan, “Save the Union.” All
these efforts forged a bridge between the militant past of the
American working class and the coming historic ’30’s. It is to the
everlasting credit of the Communists in the ’20’s that they tried to
keep the ﬁghting spirit alive among the workers. Jailed, expelled
from unions, viliﬁed, they never lost faith in the American workers.

The ’20’s were a dizzy whirl that ended in a horrible crash.
In the middle years, during the Coolidge administration, there came
a peroid of industrial expansion and capitalist prosperity, that was
fabulous. Mass production, with its speedup of workers, developed
in this period. Schemes like the B and 0 plan, to tie wages to-
production, were introduced. Union-management cooperation was
advocated by labor leaders. All sorts of prosperity illusions were

thirties.

fostered among workers, even by the unions. Unions ceased to
ﬁght for the workers’ interests. They entered into get-rich schemes
—labor banks, insurance companies, speculation in real estate.

Ideas were prevalent that anyone could get a job and that
workers merely needed to be self-reliant and show initiative and
they’d all be rich. Workers were induced to buy stocks in all kinds
of enterprises. Schemes for workers eventually to buy out the capi-
talists were peddled. When the crash came in October 1929,
workers lost millions. Five thousand banks failed, the stock market
crashed, and factories began to shut down. The depression shook
the capitalist system to its foundations. The workers’ faith in capi-
talism suflered a rude shock. In dazed bewilderment they asked:
“Where do we go from here?” Only the Communists tried to give
them answers to meet this terrible crisis.

"BUDDY, CAN YOU SPARE A DIME?"

(“APITALISM has never worked smoothly. It has never been
‘ able to guarantee full employment, except in wartime. Periodi-
cally it goes boom and bust. In the past people called it a panic or
bad times. But I929 laid all its weaknesses bare. You worked
when a capitalist could make a proﬁt on your labor. You were
thrown out to starve when proﬁts ceased. The bottom fell out of
everything—even the pot that Herbert Hoover guaranteed would
hold a chicken for everyone. “Buddy, can you spare a dime?” be-
came a byword. By 1933, seventeen million Americans were un-

employed.

The Communist Party led the tight for the unemployed. On March 6. I930. over
|.250.00'0 demonstrated at its call in a dozen cities. Here is part of the huge crowd
on New York's Union Square.

 

 

 

 

The Communist Party organized many Hunger -.
Marches like this one in I930. The main slogan was  .
"Don't Starve—Fight." ' .'

Right: Israel Amter, a leader in the Communist I
Party. was an outstanding figure in the unemployed
struggles of the thirties.

It is hard to portray the misery, desperation, suffering of those
terrible years. Hunger stalked the cities and towns of America.
Strong men, able, willing and anxious to work, sold apples on street
corners. Freight trains were loaded with unemployed boys and
men, seeking work elsewhere. Barriers were erected at state lines
to keep penniless families out. Children fainted in school from hun-
ger. Teachers took up collections to feed them. Capitalist produc-
tion came to a halt. For the workers it was a dead end—breadlines,
soup kitchens, “Hoovervilles” on city dumps.

N 0 one can deny the heroic role the Communists played in this
period. They took up where Coxey’s Army left off in 1894, when
the unemployed marched to Washington. In 1930 they organized
Hunger Marches from coast to coast. The slogan was, “Don’t
Starve—Fight,” the demand, “Work or Wages.” On March 6th over
1,250,000 demonstrated in New York, Chicago, Detroit, Philadel-
phia, Pittsburgh, Cleveland, Milwaukee, Boston, Denver, Seattle,
San Francisco and Los Angeles. William Z. Foster, Robert Minor
and Israel Amter, Communist Party leaders, were arrested on the
steps of the New York City Hall and given jail sentences. Others,
well known as Communists today, led in various cities, among them
]ack Stachel, Helen and Carl Winter, ]ohn VVil1iamson, and Eugene
Dennis (who was arrested in Los Angeles on March 6th).

After this show of strength, Unemployed Councils were set up.
In ]uly 1930, the National Unemployed Council was formed, when
1,320 delegates met in Chicago. The demands were immediate cash
or work relief; food for school children; protection against evic-
tions; public works at union wages, without discrimination. A new
and startling demand was for unemployment insurance. This be-
came the principal issue, with the fight carried by a rank and file
A. F. of L. committee, headed by Louis Weinstock of the Painters
Union, a well known Communist. It won enthusiactic trade union

support, though strongly opposed by the top A. F. of L. leadership.
Hunger marches to Washington in 1931 and 1932 supported this
demand.

It is well to remember these pioneer efforts of the Communists.
The social beneﬁts which today help millions, and which are taken
for granted as the law of the land, are due to the early struggles
they led. Older city workers remember how they put the furni-
ture back when families were evicted. Farmers remember the
“penny sales” organized by them to buy back foreclosed farms at
auction. Mother Bloor and her so-n Hal Ware, Communists, were in
the heart of these. Do you wonder that recently in a depressed
area in the mid-West, older workers began asking, “Where are
the Communists?”

Many Communists of the ’30’s were veterans of World War 1.
Among these were Peter V. Cacchione, later the ﬁrst Communist
Councilman, elected in the City of New York. James W. Ford, a
Negro steel worker from Alabama, who was a candidate for Vice
President three times on the Communist Party ticket, joined with
Cacchione a11d Emanuel Levin to organize an Ex—Servicemen’s
League. In ]uly 1932 it staged the famous Bonus March to Wash-
ington. A total of 25,000 veterans gathered at Anacosita Flats.
They carried signs: “Heroes in l917—Bums in 1932.” They demand-
ed adjusted: pay .for army service. The U.S. Army under MacArthur
drove them out of their camp with tear gas. Two veterans were
killed. The camp was burned to the ground. The veterans won
their bonus later. And MacArthur won the undying hatred of the
veterans.

Unions suffered severe wage cuts during the depression. Re-
sistance was feeble. Sporadic strikes occurred, many led by Com-

munists. These included agricultural workers in Imperial Valley,
California, beet workers in Colorado and coal miners in Kentucky.
Communists were arrested and imprisoned in many places for
these efforts. One, Harry Simms, was killed in Kentucky. Five
Detroit workers were killed by the armed guards at the Ford plant
in 1932, including ]os York and Ioseph Bussell, Communists. The
honor roll of Communists who gave their lives to the cause of the
working class is a long one.

It was no accident that in May, 1930, Congress launched its
first so-called Subversive Investigation Committee, approp-riately
called the Fish Committee. It was a forerunner of the Un-American
Activities Committee on “subversive activities.” Directed first
at the Communists, such ‘committees have broadened out today.
Their targets are workers, union officials, professionals, scientists,
teachers, ministers of varying political views. “Subversive” has
come to mean anything devoted to the real interests of the American

people.
"WITH LIBERTY AND JUSTICE FOR ALL"

HARDEST hit by the depression of the ’30’s were the Negro peo-
ple. In the South, deprived of all legal rights, they were but
one degree removed from slavery. Terror stalked them day and
night. In forty-five years—from 1885 to 1930-—there had been 3,256
lynchings of Negro men and women. Negroes defended them-
selves against the violence of the Ku Klux Klan. During and after
World VVar 1, many Hed to the North. But they were last to be
hired, ﬁrst to be ﬁred, given only the hardest, most dangerous
and menial jobs, underpaid and overworked. Hundreds died in
“race riots,” fomented by employers, in Chicago, Detroit, East St.
Louis.
Many unions excluded Negroes. Everywhere, North and South,
they met Jim Crow discrimination and segregation—on jobs, trains,

buses; in houses, restaurants, theaters, parks; in sports, on the stage,
in schools and colleges; in the professions, in business, even in
churches. They were denied justice in the courts and driven from
the ballot box by poll taxes, fake literacy tests, and force and
violence.

Earlier, Socialists had talked about equality under socialism.
But they had not fought for the rights of the Negro people—here
and now. The Communist Party changed all this. From its birth,
it declared uncornpromisingly for full political, economic, social and
cultural rights for all Negro Americans. The Party urged the or-
ganization of Negro workers into the trade unions. To root out all
notions of “white supremacy” from the minds of white Americans,
to help forge unity between white and Negro workers, was its dedi-
cated task. The Party has always practiced as well as preached
social equality, North and South. ,

Two names that became identiﬁed with “Communist Party”
among the Negro people in the ’80’s, were Scottsboro boys and
Angelo Herndon. In the deep South the struggle around these
was comparable with the Sacco—Vanzetti case in New England, a
decade before. Then foreign—born, now Negro workers, were the
victims of the frame-up system. On March 25, 1931, a fight occurred
on a freight train traveling through Alabama, between Negro and
white youths. Nine of the Negroes were taken to jail, charged with
rape of two white girls on the train. The Negroes were all in their
teens. Because they were tried there, they came to be known as the
“Scottsboro boys.” All were hurriedly convicted in a lynch at-
mosphere. All but one, a thirteen-year-old, were sentenced to be

electrocuted. Several years later one of the girls testified that the
charge was false.

They would have been hastened to their deaths, except for a
heroic Communist lawyer from New York, joseph R. Brodsky.
He telegraphed the judge on April 9, demanding a stay of execu-
tion, opportunity to prepare an appeal, and safety for the defen-
dants against lynching. His intervention saved their lives! The
legal proceedings he started continued until 1950, when the last one
was freed. The death sentences were changed at first to 75 and
99 years. The brutal treatment of the prisoners was called to the
attention of one of their lawyers, Samuel Leibowitz (now a Brook-
lyn judge) by a young Negro lawyer in Atlanta, Benjamin  Davis,
]r., now Chairman of the Communist Party f New York. As time
passed, many diverse groups came to their defense. But the Negro
people can never forget that the Communists saved the Scottsboro
boys from death. ‘

Angelo Herndon, a young Negro 19 years old, was active in the
Unemployed Councils in Birmingham and Atlanta. He campaigned
for Foster and Ford, the Communist candidates for president and
vice president. He agitated for the freedom of the Scottsboro boys.
He became a target of reaction. He was arrested and beaten in-
numerable times. Finally, in 1932, he was charged with attempt-
ing to incite insurrection. This was under a Georgia law of 1861,
aimed at slave uprisings. It caried a death penalty. The evidence
was literature, taken from his post office box—the Daily Worker,
the Southern VV0rker, and a leaflet to the unemployed.

He was defended by Benjamin  Davis, ]r., who had attended
Harvard University during’ the Sacco-Vanzetti trial in Boston. Davis
was the son of a prosperous newspaper publisher, who was also a

21

member of the Republican National Committee. Undoubtedly the
younger Davis was on the road to successful practice of law in the
Negro community of Atlanta. The Herndon case was the turning
point in his life. It led him to becoming the second Communist
Councilman in New York City, years later. It led him to a prison
cell in 1951, under the infamous thought—control Smith Act.

He made a powerful defense of Herndon, attacking the law as
unconstitutional and the trial as a travesty of justice, because Ne-
groes were excluded from the jury. Herndon was found guilty
and sentenced to 18 to 20 years. His case was twice appealed to
the Supreme Court, which ﬁrst upheld the verdict, then freed him
in 1937. One of his appeal lawyers was Whitney North Seymour,
now head of the American Bar Association. But again it was ]o-
seph Brodsky who came with an escort of railroad guards to protect
Herndon against lynchers, when he was freed on bail of $18,000,
pending appeal.

These are proud pages in the forty-year history of the Commu-
nist Party, which yields to n-one in the liberation struggles of
the Negro people. Yet there are those who falsely prate about how
the Communists “exploit” the Negro people!

OR‘(-I-ANIZE THE UNORGANIZED

IN 1932, Herbert Hoover was dumped by a disgusted American

people. The New Deal came with Franklin D. Roosevelt. It at-
tempted to restore sick capitalism to normalcy. The National In-
dustrial Recovery Act was one of the ﬁrst steps of the Roosevelt
administration. Under Section 7, the workers had‘ the right to or-
ganize and to bargain collectively, through their chosen repre-
sentatives. ‘Workers fed up with company unions, open shops,

wage cuts and speedup, took to this enthusiastically with far-reach-
ing results. The traditional militancy of the American working class
flared up again where the I.W.W. had left oil in the ’20’s, crippled
by wartime persecution and imprisonments. Strikes again took
place in textile, coal, steel, and maritime. Mass picket lines reap-
pcared.

A desperate employing class met this upsurge with violence.
This was ever their answer to workers’ demands. Eighty-eight
strikers were killed in two years by police and company thugs.
Two workers were killed on the San Francisco waterfront, on ]uly
8, 1934. One of the (lead was Nick Bordois, a Communist. -This
tragedy resulted in a general strike of 127,000 in the Bay area.

In November 1935 eight unions, representing the coal miners,
textile and clothing workers, metal miners, oil workers, printers, and
cap and millinery workers, set up a committee to organize the un-
organized without otlicial sanction of the A. F. of L., which had con-
sistently opposed industrial unionism. It was called the Commit-
tee for Industrial O'rganization—the C.I.O. Craft unionism was
not enough for the American working class. Millions of unor-
ganized workers in basic mass production industries needed indus-
trial unions. The C.I.O. set out to organize steel, auto, rubber,
lumber, oil, aluminum, transport, metal mining, meat packing, tex-
tile. It included new industries such as radio and electrical. For
the ﬁrst time, the “white collar” workers were included, an ever-
growing force today.

The unorganized far outnumbered the organized. They had
been dismissed as “unorganizable” by the A. F. of L. craft unio-n
leaders. They included foreign born, Negroes, women and youth.
The organization of the trustiﬁed industries was imperative for the
life of the labor movement. William Z. Foster had shown in the

of the C.I.O. now bore fruit immediately. Labor was on the march.
But the A. F. of L. top officials did not approve of this initia-

the C.I.O. for “dual unionism and insurrection.” Over a million
workers, 40 per cent of the A. F. of L. were thereby expelled.

It is now twenty-four years since the C.I.O. was formed. Many
of our younger generation take unions for granted. They little
realize the blood, sweat, sacriﬁce and efforts that went into build-
ing them. Nor do they realize the role of the Communists in
helping to build the C.I.O. By 1935 the Communist Party had 15
years’ experience in organizing unions. The Party had organized
the .unemployed. They had contact with the foreign-born and
Negro workers. They put all their knowledge and resources at the
command of the C.I.O. Sixty members of the Communist Party
were full-time organizers in the steel campaign alone. A Pitts-
burgh Party organizer called together a conference -of 447 dele-
gates," representing 459,000 foreign-born workers to help in the
drive. In New York, the late Rose Wortis, a garment worker and
long-time Labor Secretary of the Communist Party, was a tower
of strength in C.I.O. organizing activities. Michael Quill of the
Transport Workers Union acknowledged her help to them.

In the dead of night, at the risk of his life, Ben Carreathers,
Negro Communist, wen-t to Negro steel workers in Ambridge, Penn-
sylvania, some of whom were brought up from the South and
lived in barracks. Carreathers brought back the first 150 union ap-
plications from that barbed wire-encircled company town. He
presented them to Philip Murray, who forthwith appointed him an
oflicial organizer. Pat Cush, Communist, and veteran of the Home-
stead strike of 1892, was among the steel organizers.

Gus Hall, Communist, is a son of a Finnish iron ore miner from
the Mesabi Range in Minnesota. He was on a delegation sent by
the workers of the Mahoning Valley in Ohio to urge John L. Lewis
to start an organizational drive in steel. When the C.I.O. came,
Gus Hall became an organizer in the Warren-Niles area. The
membership reached 10,000 by the time the “Little Steel” strike
broke. His wife, Elizabeth, a native of the valley, was a great help
in signing up union members. Philip Murray said: “We have our
best organization in Warren.”

It was a bitter struggle before the steel employers accepted
the union. In Chicago, police ﬁred into a demonstration of steel
strikers. Seven workers were killed, 160 wounded and hundreds
gassed and jailed. An attempt was made to frame Gus Hall on a
dynamiting charge. Bail was fixed at $50,000 to take him out of the
strike. But the plot failed. Finally, he was fined $500 for “destroying
a fence post”—company property. —

In Detroit the Communist Party, led by William W. Weinstone,
gave all its efforts to build the auto workers union. For eleven
years, William McKie,“ Brother Bill” to all auto workers, tried to
organize Ford’s. He had (listril)uted papers and leaflets—rain or
shine. He was blacklisted by that hated open-shop corporation.
He saw young men shot down by a machine gun set up inside the
Ford gates. He joined the Communist Party at the age of 60,
because it alone had tried to organize the auto workers before the
C.I.O. came. In 1941 Ford was ﬁnally compelled to sign up, and 400
Ford workers, discharged for uni.on activity, were returned to work.
Among them was Bill McKie. Such was the record of the Com-

Jim Crow. It was led by Communists—Edward Strong, James

campaigned for the National Youth Act, to aid students and work-
ers. Gilbert Green, chairman of the Young- Communist League
was on its Board. Today Henry Winston and Gilbert Green are
in federal prisons, under the fascist-like- Smith Act. Their public
activities began in the ’30’s fighting for jobs, relief and equality.

FASCISM — THE DEADLY ENEMY

J ADOLPH HITLER had come to power in Germany, shortly be-

fore Roosevelt became President of the United States. Ger-
many had never recovered from the defeat of World War I and
was economically in ruins. Mussolini had already set up a fascist
dictatorship in Italy, over ten years before. They followed a com-
mon p'attern—destroying democratic government, wiping out the
trade unions, women’s organizations, the Communist and Socialist
parties, and all popular movements of the people, with extreme vio-
lence. Hitler plunged into a rearmament program on a huge scale,

advocated theories of the master race and planned to conquer the *

world.

Then came Spain. American youth heeded the cry of Madrid.
A tyranical monarchy fell in 1931. A bloody butcher, General Fran-
cisco Franco, unsuccessfully tried to establish a fascist regime. In-
stead a united Spanish people set up a Popular Front government.
Again in July 1936 Franco led a fascist revolt in Morocco. He in-
vaded Spain. Hitler and Mussolini sent him tanks, guns, planes
and troops. F reedom-loving peoples from 31 countries came to the
aid of Spain, in the volunteer International Brigades, numbering
30,000. Three thousand young men went from the U.S.A., their
passports marked, “Not Good for Spain.” Over hal.f did not return
and are buried in the Spanish earth. Communists Robert Thomp-
son, Steve Nelson, Joe Brandt and scores of others were in the Lin-
coln Brigade. Among the dead were Communists Dave Doran,
Joseph Dallet and Milton Herndon, brother of Angelo.

After three years of desperate struggle, Madrid fell. The demo-_
cratic countries—England, France and the United States—stood by

“neutral” while she bled to death. Her defeat doomed us all to 1

World War II. The recognition of Franco and the aid that goes
to him today disgraces our country. Millions of Spanish people have
been killed by him. Hundreds are today tortured in his prisons.
He shamelessly aided Hitler and Mussolini against the allies in
World War II. Spain was a haven for Nazi top criminals after
their defeat.

ment. The fascist iron boots marched into Czechoslovakia, Aus-
tria and Poland, into China and Ethiopia. Much as the people of
the world dreaded war and longed for peace, war became inevit-
able. With the big capitalists, markets, foreign investments, re-
sources, power, were at stake. With the people, it was to defend
themselves against fascist slavery. Fifty million people died. Whole
countries were laid waste before fascism met its military defeat.
But the menace of fascism still rears its ugly head, as we shall see.

The fascist war lords made two fatal erors in 1941. Hitler in-
vaded the Soviet Union in ]une. ]apan attacked the United States
at Pearl Harbor, in December. This brought the peoples of these
two great countries into the war. It brought ﬁnal victory in 1945.
On the day of Pearl Harbor the Communist Party gave up its anti-
war stand, as did all Americans. It pledged: “Its loyalty, its de-
voted labor, and the last drop of its blood in support of our coun-
try. Everything for victory over world-wide fascist slavery.”_ These
were not idle words, as the record of the Communists in the war
proves.

We do not boast of our deeds, but many Americans htve for-
gotten what the Communists did. I must tell part of the story
here, in all modesty, to refute lies and slander. Fifteen thousand
Communists, men and women, were in the armed forces. Many

became officers. Many laid down their lives. They were distin-
guished for courage. Many were honored for their personal brav-
ery. Two Communists, Captains Alexander Suer and Herman
Boettcher (called: a “one man army”) were killed in action and
received the Distinguished Service Cross. Hank Forbes, Party or-
ganizer in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, was killed at Anzio beach-
head. Robert Thompson, a hero of the Pacific theatre, was severely
wounded, and received the Distinguished Service Cross. Today he
sits in a cell in Atlanta Federal Penitentiary, under the Smith Act.

Communist men and women worked devotedly on the home
front, in war industries, in civilian defense.

They fought against war proﬁteering and for rent and price
controls. They campaigned for the Second Front. The election of
Peter V. Cacchione to the New York City Council in 1941 was a
great political victory for the Communist Part_v. A bold ﬁghter
for the rights of all people, he was re-elected in 1943, by the
largest first-cho-ice Vote in the city. He was joined by Benjamin
J. Davis, ]r.—the first Negro Communist elected to public office
in this country. After Cacchione’s death in 1947, Davis continued
until 1950. Then proportional representation was abolished in or-
der to defeat him. They could not do it otherwise.

World War II ended amidst great rejoicing. Anti—fascists of the

underground resistance movements set up new People’s Democ-
racies in half a dozen countries of Eastern Europe. France, Italy
and others in the West set up coalition governments. The Euro-
pean Communist parties were the strongest, East and West. Over
a million European people passed out of the orbit of capitalism
into various stages of socialism. The Peoples Republic of China
was set up in 1949. Eight hundred millions of people, one—third of
humanity, are no longer controlled by capitalism. Many more
millions in Africa and Asia have freed themselves from colonial
oppression. American capitalism desperately seeks to hold mastery
of the rest of the capitalist world. Its frenzied hatred of Commu-
nism and Communists stems from these conﬂicts.

HISTORY REPEATS ITSELF

A PEACE came that was no peace. Countries lay in ruins—ours
was untouched. The big trusts had fattened on the war. They
were ready to make new wars, to control the markets and resources
of the world. But the American workers were in a ﬁghting mood.
They had produced planes, guns, ships, tanks. Wages had been
frozen to 15 per cent over 1941, while the cost of living had climbed
35 per cent. Shop girevances had accumulated during the “no
strike” pledge period. When overtime ended, take-home pay drop-
ped. Layoffs mounted, with women and Negro workers going first.
Reconversion of industries to peacetime production lagged. Four
and a half million workers were on strike by 1946. Another post-

war offensive by the employers was let loose. History began to re-
peat itself. The class war was on the rise again.

Repressive laws were next on the program. Against whom?
You guessed it. As usual, against labor, the Negro people, the
foreign~born, and the Communists. june 1947 brought the Taft-
Hartley Act, to cripple the unions. It abolished the closed shop,
forbade mass picketing, permitted injunctions to be used against
unions, throwing the Norris-LaCuardia anti-injunction law into the
waste basket. It established an 80-day “cooling off” period before
strikes. Unions were not allowed to use funds for political pur-
poses. Union officials were forced to sign affidavits that they were
not Communists. The National Labor Relations Board, set up
in 1935 under the Wagner Act to protect the rights of labor, now
served the interests of the employers. Company unions re-ap-
peared.

A number of progressive labor leaders were framed with perjury
charges under the non-Communist affidavit section. Two are now
in prison—-Al Fisher of the Woodworlgers Union of Seattle, and
Hugh Bryson of the Marine Cooks. Seven persons convicted of con-
spiracy to violate this section, are on bail, pending appeal, in Cleve-
land. One witness, a discredited stool—pigeon, testified against
them. It could happen to anyone.

An Alien Registration Act, passed in 1940 as a so—called “secur-
ity” measure, forced over three—and-a-half million foreign—born to
register and be fingerprinted. The majority were workers and their
families. After 1945 their contributions to winning the war were for-

otten. Deportations began again, as in the ’20’s. Naturalization was
refused‘ to long-time residents suspected of leftist views. Attempts to
revoke citizenship were made against Harry Bridges and Louis
Weinstock, union leaders, and William Schneiderman, Communist

Party ofﬁcial. Foreign-born were actually kidnapped, torn from their
families and rushed out of the country—a repeat of the ’20’s.

Jim-Crow in the U.S.A. survived the war against fascism. Sore
and embittered, Negro veterans returned from a Jim-Crow army.
They found slums, poll taxes, lynchings, segregation——as usual. But
they also found that thousands of their people had left the South,
to go into Northern industries and unions. They found the Negro
people at home in a ﬁghting mood and the Negro liberation move-
ment on the march.

Among the best known leaders of the Southern Negro Youth Con-
gress were the leading Communists James E. Jackson (left) and
Edward E. Strong (right). .



  

The cold war ushered in under President Truman was based on
aggressive foreign policies and huge military expenditures. “Pre-
ventive war” against the Soviet Union was in the making. Threats
to use the atom bomb were recklessly made. Hundreds of Ameri-
can air bases now encircled the globe. The aggressive North At-
lantic Pact, including the capitalist countries of Europe and domi-
natcd by the United States, came into being. The cold war almost
precipitated World War II in 1950, when the Korean War broke
out. Labelled a U.N. “police action,” it ' cost the lives of three
million soldiers and civilians and’ settled nothing.

During the cold war, red—baiting in the U.S.A. become increas-
ingly a national pastime of demagogues, who found false patriotism
a lucrative business. McCarthyism was its worst manifestation. It
was fascism in the making. In the years that the late Senator Mc-
Carthy ran his frenzied course, a blanket of fear and intimidation
fell upon this country. No one was immune from his vicious and
irresponsible slander and abuse, not even his fellow members of
Congress and high army officers. As head of the Senate Investiga-
tion Committee he and his spies and stool-pigeons had a field day.

The grim atomosphere of the ’20’s reappeared also in the activi-
ties of the House Committee on Un-American Activities. In the
past twelve years a large number of men and women have served
jail sentences for contempt, because they refused to testify as to
their political views and associates. Hundreds more have been
hounded and harassed, lost their jobs, been blacklisted. Eugene
Dennis, then General Secretary of the Communist Party, served a
year in prison for challenging the legality of this Witch-hunting
inquisition.

When the Alien Registration Act was passed in 1940, a sneak
rider was added to it, without publicity or committee hearings. It

provided heavy penalties for “teaching and advocating the over-
throw of the government by force and violence.” This is the so-
called Smith Act. Used once against a group in Minneapolis, who
oposed the war, it was resurrected in 1948 to start a drive against
the Communist Party.

The cold war hysteria reached its tragic and horrible climax in
the execution of Ethel and Julius Rosenberg on ]une 19th, 1953, at
Sing Sing Prison, after three year’s imprisonment. The legal frame-up
against them was “conspiracy to commit espionage.” This meant the
fantastic charge that they gave the atom bomb secret to the Soviet
Union. The principal Witness was Ethel’s moronic brother, David
Greenglass, who swore away their lives to save his own. He was sen-
tenced to 15 years in prison. As a result of this stool pigeon’s lies,
Morton Sobell was also convicted and sentenced to 30 years im-
prisonment. F our times the Vinson Supreme Court refused; to review
the Rosenberg case. As ]ustice Black said on ]une 19: “This court
has never reviewed this record and has never affirmed the fairness
of the trial below.” In spite of this and the last minute efforts of
justice Douglas to secure a stay, the Court on June 18th overruled
his stay of execution.

This indecent haste was in the face of world—wide protests from
scientists who ridiculed the charge as impossible, from the Pope,
from the Rabbinates of France and Italy and from workers every-
where—protests kept secret by the Department of Justice at that
time. Like the Sacco—Vanzetti case 26 years before, it led to a rising
tide of horror against an American miscarriage of justice that will
long remain in the memories of plain people. To free Morton Sobell
is the only restitution. still possible.

Eugene Dennis, general secretary of
the Communist Party. was hailed be-
fore the Un-American Activities Com-
mittee in I949 and sentenced to a
year in prison for challenging the
Committee's legality.

In all of the renewed struggles of the unions, the foreign-born,
and the Negro people, the Communist Party played a ﬁghting role.
But even more intolerable to the ruling class were the peace activi-
ties of the Communist Party. The Big Lie, that Communists are
“foreign agents,” was used to persecute them. (Today the unions
are the target of another Big Lie—that they are corrupt and gang-
ster-ridden and must be government cleansed and controlled.)

The Communist Party opposed all provocative actions that could
lead to war—intevention in Greece, re-arming of Germany and
Japan, setting up bases in other countries, against the will of the
people there, and ﬁnally the costly and futile Korean War. It op-
posed the get-tough polices of the cold war that more than once
led to the brink of World War III. It oposed the huge military
expenditures at the expense of housing, education, health, ﬂood con-
trol, reforestation, road-building, and other much-needed social wel-
fare outlays. Peace has become a menace to those who proﬁt by
military spending. The stock market shivers and trembles and suf-
fers “peace jitters” with every d.evelopement that brings lasting
peace a step nearer.

“Conspiracy to overthrow the government by force and violence,
when and if circumstances permit,” was the fantastic lie of the
Smith Act indictments. Nothing in the words and deeds of the
Communist Party justiﬁed it. Twelve top Communist leaders were

arrested in 1948. Later, sixteen groups of Communists, including
some non-Communists, were indicted from coast to coast, including
Hawaii and Puerto Rico. They numbered 138 and included 23
women, nine of whom had young children. From the first three
groups tried, twenty-three men and ﬁve women were sent to
prison, including the writer, Claudia Jones and Betty Cannett.
Finally in 1957, a Supreme Court ruling caused the dismissal of
twelve pending cases, leaving only one, the Denver case.

But these ﬂat ﬁgures cannot convey the suffering of families,
the ordeals of long and expensive trials, the useless days spent
in prison. Five of the Smith Act victims died, their death un-
doubtedly hastened by their experiences. William Z. Foster, a
very sick man, has been under indictment for eleven years. The
Government admits it cannot try him, yet refuses to dismiss the
charge—an act of cruel vindictiveness.

For the past decade the Communist Party has been compelled
to ﬁght for its own existence. In so doing it has spearheaded the
ﬁght for the rights of others. In not a single Smith Act trial did the
Government ever attempt to make the charge of “foreign agent.”
That was for the newspaper ballyhoo. The so-called evidence
testiﬁed to by a traveling crew of paid stool-pigeon witnesses in all
the trials, was excerpts from Marxist pamphlets and books and
a century ago. The Supreme Court decision practically rejected
their perverted interpretations. Some of these were published over
all this as insufﬁcient. It said that it did not establish that the de-

EDITORS -NOTE

On September 1, 1959, the Co-mmunist Party of the U.S.A. was
forty years old. This pamphlet was written on the occasion of this
anniversary, and on the occasion of the Party’s 17th National Con-
vention, held in December, 1959. It tells the story of the Commu—
nist Party—what it is, what it stands for, and what part it played in
our country’s history during these past forty‘ years.

The spokesmen of big-business reaction have done all they could
to malign and misrepresent the Communist Party to» the American
working people. But we Communists are proud of our party and its
contributions to progress in our country, and we believe that many
American workers, once they know the truth, will share in our pride.

The pamphlet’s author, Elizabeth Curley Flynn, is exceptionally
well equipped to tell the story. She is herself a veteran o.f many of
the campaigns and battles of which she writes. Born in New Eng-
land; in 1890, a descendant of Irish “immigrants and revolutionists,”
she became an active ﬁlghter for the working people and for so-
cialism at an early age. She took part in many strikes and free-
speech ﬁghts in the earlier years of this century. During the twenties,
she campaigned for the freedom of Tom Mooney and Warren K.
Billings, and of the martyred Sacco and Vanzetti. In the co-urse of
these struggles, she became known to working men and women
all over the country as “the Rebel Girl.”

In the thirties, she joined the Communist Party, subsequently
becoming one of its leading ﬁgures and a member of its national
committee. As a Communist, she has continued. the ﬁght, touring
the country innumerable times as a spokesman for peace, democ-
racy and socialism. During the McCarthyite hysteria which de-
veloped in the years of the cold war, she was among the Commu-
nist leaders imprisoned under the thought—control. Smith Act.

She is the author of many articles and pamphlets, and of the
book I Speak My Own Peace: Autobiography of “T he Rebel Girl.”

fendants or the Communist Party had incited violent overthrow
of the government, as required by the Smith Act. Juries were
prejudiced, completely confused or intimidated, in the red-baiting
atmosphere surrounding the trials. “A calmer time” ﬁnally ar-
rived, as prophesied by ]ustice Hugo Black. ‘

This was a great victory. But the Communist Party is not
yet free from harassment even under the Smith Act. There are
still seventeen cases under another section of this infamous law,
which penalizes membership in the Communist Party. Ten of
these go back to 1948.

Nor is the Smith Act the only we-apon used against the Com-
munist Party. In 1950 the McCarran Act was passed by Congress.
This has a built-in verdict. It decreed that Communism is an inter-
national conspiracy. No proof is required , no trials are
necessary—the law says it is so. Therefore all Communists are
“foreign agents,” guilty of sedition, espionage, sabotage and
what not. It sets up a Subversive Activities Control Board, with
power to hold hearings and to order the Communist Party to reg-
ister its oflicers and members. The McCarran Act designated the
Communist Party as a “Communist Action” organization. It
designated other organizations, which stood for any immediate
demands or reforms which are also advocated by the Commu-
nist Party as “Communist Front” organizations, which the Board
could investigate and order to register. Thus it wrote guilt by

association into the law. It provided that in the event of war,
the authorities may round up all persons they deem to be “sub-
versive” and place them without trial, in concentratio-n camps.
These camps are already available.

For nine years the Communist Party has fought to have this
law nulliﬁed. In so doing it has so far saved other progressive
organizations from the threat of registration. Several times the
issue has been returned to the Board by the courts, because wit-
nesses were proven to be tainted with perjury. It is now on ap-
peal to the U.S. Supreme Court. To register would be equal
to a plea of criminal guilt. It is unthinkable, to us. We believe
every fair-minded American, once he knows the facts, will heartily
applaud our stand.

WHAT THE C. P. STANDS FOR TODAY

IN SPITE of all the difﬁculties of the past decade—trials, depor-

tations, imprisonments—the Communist Party has survived and
functioned. VVe claim no monopoly in any of the ﬁelds where
we have pioneered. We rejoice that strong people’s organiza-
tions have grown up in many of these ﬁelds in the past years. It
proves our early efforts bore fruit. But all the tasks we put our
hands to are far from completed. Until they are, we will con-
tinue to do our part. We have made our share of mistakes. We
are well aware of them. We strive to correct them, realizing
that only those who do nothing never make mistakes.

VVe Communists have never bel.ieved, as many of our fore-
runners did, that it is necessary to wait for socialism before all
wrongs could be righted and all grievances settled. We have
fought injustice, cruelty, violence, oppression, wherever it ex-
isted and against those responsible. We believe that ties will
be forged between labor, the Negro people, the farmers and others,
to better defend and extend their democratic rights and unite

them against monopoly control of the political and economic life

We believe that the struggle for the full social, political and
economic equality of the Negro people is the major issue of de-
mocracy within our country today. It is the test by which peoples
all over the world judge America’s pronouncements on democ-
racy. The Communist Party stands foursquare today, as it always
has, for complete Negro liberation. We oppose the vicious at-

the South and elsewhere. We advocate a federal anti—lynching law.
Exercise of the Negro’s right to vote is a burning issue in the
South today, where violence, fake literacy tests and the poll tax
are used to disenfranchise millions of Negro voters.

The Communist Party gives every support to the lib-eration
movement of the Negro people, in all its aspects, as essential
to the rights and welfare of all American working people. Jobs,
housing, health facilities, education are the main demands of the
Negro people in Northern communities. All too often they meet
Violent opposition. The Communist Party in Chicago, Detroit
and New York and elsewhere has supported these struggles
of the Negro people. It has supported F .E.P.C. campaigns, the
Youth March to Washington, has joined in the protests against
the Till, Parker and other frightful lynchings in the South. We
rejoice at the parole of Rosa Lee Ingram and her two sons, at long
last, since we were among the ﬁrst to- ﬁght to save her life twelve
years ago. One of our principal campaigns at present is to se-
cure the freedom of our own three comrades serving sentences
under the Smith Act—Robert Thompson, Gilbert Green and a
powerful young leader of the Negro people, Henry Winston.

On the labor front, while I write, 600,000 steel workers are
entering on their eighth week of strike. Their negotiations are
at a stalemate. It is actually a lookout. The big employers are out
once again to smash the unions. On the legislative front new
anti-labor laws are adopted in Congress, which take a leaf out
of the decrees of Hitler and Mussolini. They go far toward fas-
tening complete government control on the unions, their ﬁnances,
membership, meetings, records, elections, strikes, etc. They
put new teeth and claws into the Taft-Hartley Act by renewing
injunctions to break strikes. The Communists exposed the Taft-
Hartley Act as shackling labor. The pretext now of “cleannig up
the unions” is in reality a move to crush the unions. VVe will do
our best to expose it, as such, to our fellow workers in all or-
ganizations. The A.F.L.-C.I.O. and the independent unions are
eighteen and a half million strong today. They possess po-

litical as well as economic power, which should be used to de-
fend their interests. Independent political action will soon be a
must for the working class of this country to protect their rights
and organizations.

The Communist Party endorses and ﬁghts as members of the
working class for all major economic demands of the unions today
—more wages, a shorter work week, relief from speed-up, safer
and more sanitary conditions of work, adequate unemployment
and pension beneﬁts, protection against blacklist through so-
called “security” checks. It advocates unity of all existing labor
organizations for the protection of their common interests, to
eliminate jurisdictional disputes and to better organize the un-
organized, especially in the South. A federal minimum wage
raise to at least $1.25 an hour and the extension of the Fair Labor
Standards Act to include workers in retail trades, service indus-
tries and agriculture, would affect ten million people. All of
these demands are essential to protect workers from increasing
sub-standard conditions.

For the consumer, which means all of us, the Communist Party
advocates price and rent control, reduction of taxes. For the
youth—b-etter job opportunities, a minimum wage scale, protec-
tion from hazardous occupations and better educational facili-
ties. We advocate the passage of a National Youth Act assuring
youth of these things. For the farmers, a larger share of the na-
tional income, aid to meet debts, relief from the cost price squeeze,
and from what is called “vertical integration.” The farmer,
in exchange for credit and a market with the big companies
that buy his produce, is reduced to a contract laborer on a piece-
work basis, but with no protection as to wages, hours or other
labor conditions. The farmer needs socialism as much as the
workers do.

Last, but not least, the Communist Party ﬁghts consistently
for a peace policy on the part of our country. We believe the
desire for peace animates all Americans (except the few who proﬁt
by war). We want to be done with bombs, intercontinental mis-
siles and the like. Mass suicide is a ghastly prospect for the
future. Most people don’t want even to think of it. Yet as I
write a Congressional Committee reports that 50 million Americans
will be killed and 20 million injured in an atomic attack. To
ban the use of all such death-dealing instruments is imperative.
There must be coexistence between the socialist and capitalist
worlds, or there will be no existence. In advocating world peace,
we stand for the survival of the human race.

In all these struggles a most important part has been played by
the Marxist newspaper, the Daily Worker. First issued in Chicago
on january 20, 1924, it has brought the message of socialism to
American workers for the last 25 years. It has highlighted news of
of the struggles of the American people from the viewpoint of their
interests. Stories of the Negro people’s movement, strikes, peace ma-
nifestations, which are ignored or censored in other papers, appear
in the Worker. History in the making is reflected in its pages. It is
supported by the nickels, dimes and dollars of workers. Temporarily
reduced to a weekly publication it continues in spite of great dif-
ficulties and will eventually resume its daily appearance.

A SOCIALIST AMERICA

T«HE Communists are pioneers today for a socialist America-
as we were in 1919, when the Communist Party was born.

 

In Chicago and New York, in Los Angeles and Birmingham—-in cifies across Hue
coun+ry—’rhe ﬁghf againsf Dixiecraf Lynch "iusfice" goes on. "Save Willie McGee!"
"Free fhe Trenron Six!" "Free Mrs. Rosa Lee |ngran’r!" In fhese and dozens of ofher
baffles, Communis’rs have played an honorable parf along wifh many ofher Amer-
Icans.

Many workers must still baffle for union organization. The bitterly-fought New York
hospital workers' strike in I959 won the support of all of organized labor.

Then it was a dream. Now it is on the horizon. Once capital-
ism possessed the earth and the fullness thereof. Now its fron-
tiers are ever narrowing. It is declining, approaching its twi-
light hour. The capitalism that once seemed so all—powerful, so
invincible, is bursting at the seams, top—heavy, chaotic. America
needs socialism. It has outgrown capitalism. All the patching and
stretching will not make capitalism fit the America of today and
tomorrow.

There is a growing conviction among many people that some-
thing is wrong with a system in which we cannot guarantee our
own children work, education and peace. There is increasing in-
terest among the American people in how the other half of the
world’s peace are living in socialist countries, especially in the So-
viet Union.

There is an ever increasing knowledge of socialist accomplish-
ments on the part of many Americans. The truth is ﬁnally seeping
through. Exchange visits of all sorts of delegations—scientiﬁc, cul-
tural, educational, industrial, farming, students—acquaint ever
widening groups of Americans with the socialist people and their
progress. VV hat they hear is interesting and praiseworthy; who but
the exploiters can quarrel with the aims of plenty and peace? All
this is climaxed by the historic exchange of visits between President
Eisenhower and Soviet Premier Khrushchev—a tremendous step
toward American—Soviet peace and friendship.

We Communists are Americans. We love our country and its
varied people. We know them well. We are of their ﬂesh and
blood. Nothing and nobody can take our country away from us.
We know its vastness--3,000 miles from sea to sea of rich and beauti-
ful mountains, rivers, plains, cities. Its defacements are by the

hands of greed. We know our country’s history. Our forebears
were pilgrims, pioneers, revolutionists, abolitionists, anti-imperial-
ists, agitators—all who fought for freedom. We know the courage
of our people and, in their overwhelming majority, their goodness
and kindness. We know our people’s technical skills, their poten-
tials for the abundant life. VVe have great faith in our country and
its people. Socialism will be established by the free and democratic
choice of the American people. The Communist Party believes that
it can come peacefully, through the united political action of work-
ers, farmers, Negro people, and all who labor by hand and brain.

What will a socialist America be like, an America in which the
people and not a handful of capitalists own the means of produc-
tion? ‘

First of all it will remove insecurity—there will be no unemploy-
ment. It will be the right and duty of all who are able, to do their
share of the socially necessary work. There will be care for all
from infancy to old age—care for mothers, children, the sick, in-
capacitated and elderly people—at the expense of society, not the
individual or family. There will be leisure for rest, recreation,
sports, culture, free from worry. Waste will be eliminated, pro-
duction and distribution organized, so that a maximum of food,

46

 

clothing and shelter can be produced for all, with a minimum of
labor. Automation, a curse to workers under capitalism, will then
be a blessing freeing men from heavy and monotonous drudgery.
Many technical improvements, discarded by capitalism as non-
proﬁtable will help lighten the burden of labor. Man will no longer
be the servant of the machine. It will serve him.

When plenty can be produced for all and prices are no longer
controlled by big monopolies, nor taxes ever increased to support a
war economy, living costs wil be reduced. Rent will not be a
source of private profit and will be kept to moderation. Plenty
of comfortable houses can be built for all, out of the public funds
formerly drained off by the capitalist class. Schools and education
will take the precedence they deserve, in a socialist society. Teach-
ers will not be chronically underpaid, as they are now. All children
will be entitled to a free education based on their talents and abili-
ties. A new group of intellectuals will arise—not a chosen for-
tunate few—but the children of workers, farmers, of all groups of the
people. They will become the scientists, teachers, musicians, ar-
tists, statesmen, creators of the future.

Vast possibilities for research, exploration, discoveries, will be
opened up to this new youth. Their efforts will not be for the
proﬁts of a few but for the further development of humanity. Think
of what it can mean to a young generation, men and women espe-
cially, to have a complete education free, to be able to enter any

HORIZONS ‘ OF THE FUTURE
For A Socialisf America

THE ATOMIC AGE

THE TWENTIETH CENTURY is the Atomic Age. Its possibili-

ties for good or evil are unlimited. The ancient curses—d-isease,
poverty and war—can be wiped from the globe. Science can reach
the most remote corners of the earth, bringing security and happi-
ness to all. Man has conquered nature. Her bounty is at his dis-
posal. Mankind can live in peace, health and plenty. Never in all
the ages has there been such promise forthe abundant life. Never
have there been such horizons for the future.

Science, art, culture can flourish in leisure, made possible by
liberating men from drudgery. Every child can be born with the
heritage of the accumulated knowledge’ of centuries, to blaze new
trails in his ge-neration. Old age can rest on its labo-rs, indepen-
dent and respected. Equality for all, regardless of race, co-lor,
creed or sex, can be the accepted way of life. We are on the
threshold of a new world—a socialist world.

Will we move forward? Will we pass through that shining
doorway into the singing tomorrows? Or will we permit the
proﬁt sytem to destroy the human race in a nuclear war? The
Atomic Age can go one way or the other. The decision rests with
our generation—to guarantee life to our children, our grandchildren
and theirs.

Six decades of the Twentieth Century are nearly over. Think
of the changes in our daily lives that have taken place during that
span! From the heat and power of woo-d, to coal, gas, electricity
and now atomic energy. From wagons and trains to automobiles

profession or occupation, never to have to worry about a position
when their formal education is completed. To be able to do their
chosen work, to marry, to raise a .family free from economic worry.
Think of what it would mean to these young families to have no
medical bills to pay for childbirth or illnesses; to be provided with
nurseries and child care centers; not to be worried about the older
people of the family.

Socialism will apply science to all ﬁelds of human endeavor.
Socialism opens up new Vistas of a superior human race—free from
ignorance, greed or selfishness.

The road ahead to socialism in our country is shorter than we
think. The means .for producing plenty for all now exist. The
road behind is the long and tortuous one. The future will be the
reward for all of us. On our 40th anniversary we of the Commu-
nist Party, U.S.A. say proudly, in the last words of Gabriel Peri,
editor of L"Humam'te, the French Communist newspaper, who was
executed by the Nazis:

“If it had to be done all over, I would take this road again.”

The future belongs to the young. Children like these will one day grow up in an
America tree of prejudice. want and war—a socialist America.

For’ more than thirty years, The Worker has
reported the activities and struggles of organ-
ized labor, the Negro people, the farmers and
other sections of the_American working peo-
ple. It has been a constant source of vital news
which the commercial newspapers have sup-
pressed.

In its editorial policies, The Worker has con-
sistently stood for peace and peaceful coex-
istence with the socialist lands, and for the
advancement of the democratic rights and the
economic welfare of the American people. And
as a Marxist newspaper, it has at all times up-
held the goal of a socialist America.

The Worker has no rich nangels or big ad-
vertising contracts. It is supported by the pen-
nies and dollars of working people, and thanks
to their unﬂagging support, it has weathered
every crisis and every effort to destroy it. i

and airplanes. From kitchen canning to packaged frozen foods.
From pick and shovel to coal cutting and loading machines.

From skilled workers to assembly lines, to automation. From
hand plows, horse drawn, to power-operated farm machinery.
From hands to machines, picking cotton. From longshoremen to
automatic loaders on ships. From nickelodeons to spoken movies,
to radio, to television. Telephones today reach land, sea and air.
Automatic machines lift, sort, classify, compute, correct errors,
work in production and offices. All these are steps to the dream
come true—freedom from drudgery.

Atomic energy is not the exclusive possession of agencies of
destructive warfare. It is capable of constructive and beneﬁcial
peacetime uses, sufficient to revolutionize all our ways of life._It
can replace electricity and coal, a blessing to countries which today
lack fuels. There are American atomic submarines and Soviet
atomic ice-breakers. Atomic rockets are conquering space. Atomic
energy may yet control our weather, send us to the moon, and cure
all our diseases.

Why, then, are we faced with a nightmare of fears—of War, of
unemployment, or constant struggle to live? The answer is simple:
we live under capitalism.

CAPITALISM AND SOCIALISM

HAT IS CAPITALISM? It is a system under which the natural
resources, industries, transportation and communications sys-
tems, etc., are privately owned by a small capitalist class which o-p-
erates them for its own private proﬁt. All that is essential to the
life and well—being of the people, is the monopoly of a few. Four
hundred men control the American national economy today. There
are giant ﬁnancial groups—the Morgans, R~o»ckefellers, Duponts,
Mellons and others——controlling dozens of corporations in the billion-
aire class. A hundred years ago oil was discovered in Pennsyl-
vania. Old John D. Rockefeller got in on the ground floor. 4 Today
his grandchildren own oil wells and reﬁneries throughout the capi-
talist world. ‘
The top brackets pay themselves handsome salaries as officers
of corporations. They own banks and insurance companies. They
divide up and reinvest their accumulated proﬁts. This incredible
constant stream of wealth flows to this class through the proﬁt sys-
tem.

But what of the great mass of Americans? They may own a
frigidaire, a television set, a car, even a house—all of which they pay
for on the installment plan. And when the jobs go, the credit gives
out. The “property” goes back to the warehouse. Millions of Ameri-
cans—the overwhelming maj=ority——do not own a share of stock, or a
dividend-collecting bond. They earn a living solely by their labor
—by working for wages. In many families both husbond and wife
work or the man has two jobs, to have a decent living for the
family.

The failure of the capitalist system to provide security for the
vast majority -of Americans is its greatest evil. Only in abnormal
wartime can it provide work for all. Under capitalism, technologi-
cal advancement, particularly automation, brings mass unemploy-
ment in its wake. Labor-saving devices displace workers and throw
them out of their jobs. Production is increased while the labor force
diminishes. You can see- it all around you.

Seventy-ﬁve thousand families are reported to have left Detroit,
Michigan, where 240,000 workers remain permanently jobless, as
a result of this process. There is more steel produced, with fewer
steel workers. More automobiles come off the assembly lines, with
fewer auto workers. Machines dig and load coal in the mines, while
miners are on relief. There are longer, faster railroad trains today-
with fewer railroad workers. A recent writer remarked: “Industry
of producing ourselves right into the poorhouse.” This is one of the
crazy contradictions of capitalism.

system.‘ Labor of hand and brain, operating power machinery, pro»-
duces all the wealth of the nation. Yet the portion returned to
the Worker, in the form of wages, is small indeed compared to the
surplus extracted as proﬁts by the owning class, which itself pro-
duces nothing. The capitalist system periodically over-produces
and must slow down. Capitalism is plagued with these periodical
crises. This is a fatal weakness. ‘ .

Capitalism spends billions on armaments, while thirty—one mil-
lion Americans live far below standard. It ﬁxes high prices and
high taxes. It ﬁghts all demands of labor for higher wages as
“inﬂation.” Ironically, it attacks unions as “monopolies.” Capi-
talism fails to provide adequate housing, education, health facili-
ties, recreation, culture, and leisure without worry.

It fails to control droughts, ﬂoods or erosion. It encourages
racial discrimination, to pit worker against worker. It dins into
the ears of its victims through the press, radio, television and movies
that we cannot live except under its system. It creates an atmo-
sphere of tension and strain. Crimes, juvenile delinquency, drug
addiction, alcoholism, nervous disorders and chronic diseases, are on
the increase.

Capitalism is not the pinnacle of social progress. Nor is it eter-

nal. It was preceded by slavery, barbarism, feudalism. It will be
succeeded by socialism. It is challenged today by the way of life
of nearly half the world’s population, who are building socialism.
1 Americans are breaking through the fog of lies which attempts to
obscure the amazing accomplishments achieved by the socialist
countries in a few decades. Americans too will see the need and
? beneﬁts of a socialist system.
‘ What is socialism? It is a system wh.ere the national resources,
industries, etc., are owned and controlled in common by the people.
All that is essential to the life and well-being of the people, belongs
to the people. Rent, interest and proﬁt for private gain, are abol-
ished. The exploitation of men by men is ended. The vast stream
of the nation’s wealth is used for the beneﬁt of all. That which now
goes to enrich the few, becomes public funds—for education, health,
child and old age care, recreation, culture and the like.
Under such a system, the standard of living can rise immeasur-
4 ably. Private property in consumer goods, the comforts of life,
3 can steadily increase. Socialism in our countiy will guarantee full
training and employment, according to ability. Automation will
shorten the hours of labor. Production will be organized to meet
the needs of the people, not for proﬁt. All the richness and beauty
of our country will be enjoyed by all.
