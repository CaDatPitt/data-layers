i Area conferences plan actions
  against unemployment, depression

MORE THAN 150 leaders from 26 'Mine—Mill' local unions in eight

states met in four area leadership conferences on December 12, 13,

andi14 to blue print what several delegates called “a crusade against
unemployment and depression.” 9

rThe conferences were the first to be held following the Inter-

national Executive Board’s adoption on Noyember 24 of a union—wide

_ ’ program to meet the jobs crisis; The first step in the board’s program

I of action was the calling of area conferences. Similar conferences will 2
be held in the near future in Montana, Colorado, the Southwest, the
Deep South, the Eastern Seaboard, and Canada. » ‘
The four pre—holiday conferences were: , __

Metal crisis spreading

What gave the delegates‘ considerable

food for political and economic thought

was the International Executive Bo-ard’s _

analysis that the crisis, formerly con-

‘fined to lead and zinc mining, was

spreadingrto other metals and to smelt-
ers and refinery ‘operations. For ex-
ample, copper; which had been‘relat1ve-

       column as    

ly, unaffected by the market crisis,_ is __

now beginning to‘ feel theeffects of
certain developments that had plagued
lead and zinc for more than a year.

The supply of copper, it was pointed_-

out, has increased lately, atthe same _
* time that markets in the country are

contracting because of a general eco-
nomic decline that is already affecting
-the steel industry, auto production, new
housing, and other branches of the
economy. _ '
Considerable discussion took place in
the conferences around siich‘ topics as a
lobbying campaign in Congress, in-

creased unemployment compensation,\

the Murraybill, the shorter work week
without loss iofytakehome pay, world
trade, public _\'v’orks, special sessions of
state legislatures, and the need to edu-
cate the public on the responsibility of
the metalsmouopoly for the situation.

Special attention was given in the

meetingslto community delegations, to
congressmen, senators", governors, state
officials, and mayors.
Officers keynote conferences
President John Clark gave the key-
note address ‘and, presided at the Spo-

kane conference.’ He -was assisted in the

meeting by Int’l. Rep. Fred Gardner,

and Special Rep. Graham Dolan of the

International _office. - .
Vice-President Orville Larson, Secre-

tary-Treasurer M. ‘E. Travis, and Re-

make “communism” the issue in,the
1954 elections and the efforts of em-

‘ make “communism” the issue in the

of the organization needs to be cen-
tered on the unemplpyment crisis.

NEWS, THAT “Chile gave the go- «

ahead this weekend to American-cwned
copper mines there__to start selling cur-
rent copper‘ production‘ at world'compe-
titive prices” was reported in the Wall
Street J ournal on Dece-mber'7.
Stating that “the American mines’

' affected are Anaconda Copper Mining

Co.’s Chuquicamata a_nd_ Potrerillos
mines, and Kennecott Copper Corp.’s
Braden mine” and that “these mines
account for. 90% of Chile’s‘ capacity,”
the Wall-Street Journal also said “t ere
is general agreement; in the trade t at
the result of the fextra" supply from
Chile eventually will be "a lower price
for copper.” '

.W,hile Chilean production, was kept
off the market, U. S. needs were. more
than being met by‘"current domestic’
production plus increasing imports.
Now, as ‘a result of this ‘recent develop-
ment, an additional 30,000 tons per
month will be coming on the market to
depress the price‘ of copper. and furthen
spreadthe growing metals crisis to that

— section of the industry. _

DANVILLE, Ill.—The Hegeler_Zinc

in its 6th month, shows new strength
among the membership after the re-
cent defeat of an attemptby the com-

- ‘pany and its agents

Hegeler , workers have been out since '

July 28, forced to strike when the

company .refnsed"‘ their demands for

wages,'vacations, holidays and job pro-

tection. Since the strike, the company»
- has made deliberate efforts to smash
Local 209 and starve the workers into ‘

submission. The company hit with the
dreaded “blacklist” to prevent other
companies from hiring the strikers,
many of /whom were firedfrom jobs
they had gotten in other industlfies.
Mqstof the workers, however,‘ final-
ly were ab_le to get some work and also
relief from other h‘Iin_e-Mill workers in
thearea as well as from‘ workers in
other plants. Then the red-baiting be-
gan," with the company hoping the
members would run for cover and give
up their strike to “prove that they were
good Americans.” The ‘membership
remained solid.‘ The company attempt-
ed_ to deliver zinc produced before the
strike, but the picket linetightened and
prevented shipments. -

junction, and the injunction- hearing

STRIKEBREAKING

  Texas ‘anti-red’ probe
  collapses in confusion

EL PASO, Tex-as—Organized labor in this state is aroused and
angry over a hit-aiid—run state “investigation” of three unions, which
' ‘ . ‘ , ts , 7!
lasted three days, proved nothing, but tiied haid to tag the ied
label on a.ny worker who _]Ol11S a union. - -_ '

Chief purpose of the probe by a hastily-appoiiited state industrial
commission was to break a nionth—old strike of the CIO Distributive,
Processing & Office Workers against 22 hotel, restaurant and depart-
ment store properties in the Port Arthur area. The strike is still in

progress.

Texas newspapers gave big headlines to the initial blast by state
Attorney General Ben Shepperd, who claimed “commuiiist—doiiiiiiated”
unions were “invading” Texas in a “hloscow plot” backed b_v unlimited
“Moscow gold” to get a “strangle hold on Texas mineral, port and

‘petroleum centers.”

Although Mine-Mill and the Fur & Leather Workers were not
involved in the Port Arthur strike, and neither union has any con-

nection with the CIO-DPOWA, Shep-
perd charged that they were part of the
“conspiracy” with the (‘IO organiza-
lion.

An “in\'estigation” was then ordered

by Governor Allen Shivers, who set up
a 5—inan commission, dominated 4—to—1
by employer representatives. The single
labor spokesman was William J. Harris,
president of the state AF of L.
‘ Though he sat through three days of
hearings in the statehouse at Austin,
Harris said repeatedly that the com-
mission was “exceeding its authority,”
and was “not the appropriate body for
such an investigation.”

WHEN IT WAS OVER, Harris said
he was “pleased that, after three days
of testimony, not one member ot'_.or-
ganized labor in Texas has been ac-
cused of being a Communist.”
- The long-range anti—labor purpose of
the probe was revealed when Coininis—
sion chairman‘ Fulgham, Lubbock
rancher, announced that a legal advis-
ory committee was being set up to
draft new labor legislation “with teeth.”
- Fred C. Pieper Sr.,(a national CIO
official in charge of the strike in/Port
‘Arthur, labelled the Attorney General’s
charge of a Communist conspiracy in
Texas a “figment of sonieone’s imagin-
ation.” He called the investigation an
attempt to create “hysteria” in Texas
over the strike which “involves wages,
hours and working conditions —- not
.Coinniunism.”

TWELVE or THE struck employers,

A nneantiine, coordinated with the Dixie-

fcrat. government and attorney general
by filing identical injunction suits
iaiined at forbidding the CIO members
"from picketing. By that time, the CIO
,had dissolved the DPO local’ in Port
-‘Arthur, and replaced it with a C10
(Local Industrial Union.

Pieper was the only labor-spokesman S

to appear before the commission. Other

witnesses included four professional
vstool-pigeons— Harvey Matusow, Matt

Cvetic. John Lautner and Maurice Mal-

kin, and Asa Bowen, former .\Iine-l\'Iill_

leader, now police chief of Dumas,
Texas, a smelter town. Their vague

testimony covered almost everything,

except the Texas labor movement, about
which they proved uninﬁormed. -

O. A. Knight, President of the CIO

.Oil Workers International, demanded

in a statement that Shepperd “quit
fogging the air with false accusations
and wild rumors.” He said Shepperd’s
gharges were “not only ridiculous, but
an insult to our union” and to the
.‘‘30,000 members of our union who are
employed in the Gulf Coast oil centers.”

Knight said the probe “obviously is
going to be phony for the commission

, is an unbalanced and unrepresentative

body . . . loaded four to one against
organized labor and in favor of the
employers.”

“The high-powered publicity cam-
oaign sparked by Shepperd and abetted
by Shivers is an old story to organized
labor,” the CIO oil union president said.
“It is simply an attempt to poison the
minds of the people against unionism.”

CIO President Walter Reuthei" said

“The charge that DPO activity in Port
Arthur has ‘communist sabotage of the

oil industry’ as its motive is as mali-

,"cio_us' as it is fallacious.”

‘— Mine-Mill, too, spoke out sharply

against the phoney probe. A statement '

from the union’s El Paso office said:

“it is obvious that this so-called in-

maneuver, designed to break _a strike
in Texas with which Mine-;\Iill hadn’t

“The type of smear campaign em-,

of the public has fallen flat on its face.

“It is unfortunate that the tax-
payers’ moncy must be wasted on this
kind of side-show, instead of’ being
spent to help the workers of Texas.”

Another attack on the Shivers—Shep—
perd foray was madeby Ralph Yar-
borough, prominent Austin attorney
expected to run against Shivers for
the Democratic gubernatorial noinina—

whole business “politically inspired,”

and added;

“The politicians in control in Texas,
scared half out of their wits by their

people of Texas to listen now, but to

not one of“ the least of these was a copy,
of your paper, especially in view of tho

Union members here hailed the ‘election. of

.,«:‘Bacicot and Gravel as a great victory in face‘ of the
‘ alignment of forces opposed tothe labor -_cand1date's', .
‘ particularly the Chamber of Commerce and the big

‘mining companies, and also because of the relatively

j new experience of the membership ‘in participating

in organized political action ‘behind their own can-

g.d_idates.'

  ‘ "With two union men now in the Sudbury _City
‘ Council, it is the first time labor as such has scored
‘a victory in the political field here since 1945. It
[Chas given great impetus to the union’s' membership

T CONISTON, Ont.--The entire labor slate for
Mayor and six councillors was swept into office
here in the Coniston civic elections on December 14.
The six councillors elected are all members of Mine-

-Mill Local 598, while Mayor Walter Klimnik, re-

elected for a second term by acclamation, is a former
member of Local 598.‘ l _ .
--The six councillors are T. Paradis, W. Evershed,
D. Lepage. A. McKerral, L. Rouselle and G. ‘Sart‘or.:
The International~Nickel Company smelter town
of Coniston has been llnder company domination for
years, with company officials holding municipal
office.‘ Last year, Walter Klimnik, running as the
labor-‘sponsored candidate for‘Mayor, defeated the
incumbent, the superintendent of the INCO smelter
in Coniston. Coniston is the hometown of Local 598
president Mike Solski. ’ .
‘ Following his election as Mayor last year, and
with the help of some union men "on the council,"

_Klimni.k succeeded in initiating’ several improve-

ments in civil services. This "year, appreciating these
improvements, the smelter workers of. Coniston
elected a complete labor slate in face of opposition
candidates for council.
