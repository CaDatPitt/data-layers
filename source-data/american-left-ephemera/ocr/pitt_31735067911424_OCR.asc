  Union’
blasts the Butler ill

The September issue of The Rubber Worker, official organ of

I the CIO Rubber Workers Union, carried a strong condemnation of the

movements.”

' Butler bill as a plot by Senators Butler and McCarthy to silence criti-
-”’ei‘sm-and contribute to the “destruction of America’s trade union

Under the headline “Senate Bill 1606 Would Kill Unions,” the Rubber

Workers paper said:
S “Last April, Senate Bill 1606 was
I‘ntrod-uced before that body, with a

‘ distinct absence of publicity. It’s an-

nounced goal was to prevent Commu-

nists from -influencing labor unions,

but its provisions extend a great deal

further into the conduct of labor 07“.

ganizat-ions than the avowed objective.

“One of the very important aspects
of this situation is the fact that the
bill was sponsored by Senator Butler
of Maryland, who gained notoriety
during his senatorial campaign agai-nst

2 ex-Senator ,Tydings. Butler was ac-

cused, at the time of borrowing a
public relations expert from Joe M¢_:_-
Carthy’s campaign; and it was this

same publicity man who was denounced
for having faked a composite picture
of Tydings and former chief Commu-
nist Earl Browder.

“Even though the frameup was re-
p rted obvious, a sufficient number of
Maryland voters were persuaded that
it _was on the level, in consequence ,Of
which they voted against Tydings.

“Therefore, it naturally occurs that
both Senators Butler and McCarthy‘
may be veryymuch interested in con-
tributing‘to the possible destruction of
Ameriea’s trade union movement. That
would be one effective method of dis-
posing of their powerful though con-
structive critics.”

‘ Who is Butle1°’?

’Senator John M. Butler first came
to -public notice when he defeated Mil-
"lard Tydings, who had been a Demo-
cratic Senator from Maryland for 24
-years. ' _

B-utler’s campaign against Tydings
was characterized by some of the foul-
est red-baiting, gutter-type character

assassination ever ‘witnessed in a sen-

atorial campaign.

One of the tricks pulled by Butler's /4

campaign committee was to fake a
photograph of _'_I‘ydings, a conservative
Democrat, shaking hands with Earl

.. Browder, then head of the Communist

party. Although, an obvious fake, the

photograph was circulated throughout”

Maryland ,during the campaign. .
« It is well known at the time that

'i3'utler’s smear campaign to defeat

Tydings was mainly engineered by‘
Senator.McCarthy of Wisconsin. The
Senate .Elections Subcommittee said

‘ that Butler campaign workers, in four
‘instances violated federal and state
‘lawswith their type of electioneering.

THE RECENT appointment by Presi-
dent Eisenhower of ‘Robert Lee, a close

-. friend" of Senator, McCarthy, to _the
by Federal Communications ﬁommission,

-brought forth some more information
connecting both Lee and McCarthy

1 with Senator Butler.

Thei_Colorado Labor Advocate Octo’:

V  15, reporting Lee’s~appointment’to
' the FCC, said: “Both Lee and his wife

were active in the smelly Maryland

‘Senatorial ‘campaign with McCarthy,

when John Marshall’ Butler unseated

-Millard Tydingsyas senator.”

Labor, organ‘of 15 railroad unions,
reported in the same connection that

’f"McCarthy, Lee and his wife took part
' together in the 1950 ‘smear’ campaign
 w ' which defeated former Senator Millard

' ' E. Tydings of Maryland and elected

 
 

Senator John-M. Butler, one of the
most reactionary~ Republicans. Re-
cently, Mrs. Lee was matron of honor
at McCarthy’s wedding.” ’

"A WEEK LATER, on October 17, the
same labor paperccame up with an-

_ “other angle on the Butler storys, as fol-

lows: -

“The Baltimore Sun tells how,.when
McCarthy helped defeat former Sena-
tor Tydings of, Maryland and elect
Senator Butler by a.‘smear’ campaign
in 1950, ‘some of the funds used‘ in
Butler’s behalf were placed ‘in an ac-
count under the name of Lee’_s wife.’ A

“Then these funds ‘went through the
hands of_Jon Jonkel,’ who did not re-
port them as-required by the Maryland
Corrupt Practices Act. For that, Jon-
kel was fined $5,000.” ’ I -

“Can anyone doubt,” the railroad la-
bor newspaper asks in ‘an editorial
on the -—Butler-McCarthy tie-up, “that
Lee knew his wife was holding a ‘slush
fund’ which helped pay for the smear,
cambaiign? 3'13 "appointment of Lee to

'a powerful government post. part of
the ‘moral crusade’ which Eisenhower
‘promised to carry on in Washington?”

March of Labor hits
Butler bill in new issue
Sounding the alarm against the But-

ler bill as a ‘fbill to end free union-‘*3.

’-ism,”’March of Labor, in its October-

‘- November issue off ',the press this

week, describes the measure’s dangers
in "an article by Russ Nixon. _ '
The opening of a “new round against
Taft-Hart1ey” is seen by John Steuben,
as a result of the resignation of, Martin
Durkin, fears of depression, the indict-'
ment 'of Ben Gold, and increased anti-
administratiqn tnends in labor. ,
The magazine draws national atten-
tion to the case of Wesley Ro,bert»Wells,i
Negro prisoner facing a death sen-
tence for throwing a cuspidor at a jail

guard. Preston Hill, a longshoreman, '
tells why labor shouldsupport Wells, H

and the - prisoner himself / describes

I some harrowing details of his treat-

ment.

Jim Crow discriminations are’ also
assailed in an article by Herb March

tion against anti-Negro acts in its

would suspend the union’s right to be
the bargaining agent for the workers.

3. Any raiding union could then ask
the NLRB for an election to choose
another bargaining agent. To get such
an election, the raiding union would

,not be permitted to appear on the bal-
‘ lot, leaving the door open for any
union the company wanted to bring in.

‘ IN OTHER WORDS; the Butler
bill would put a union out of business
by taking ‘away its bargaining rights

on the basis of a charge until,_at some ,_

future date, the union could prove it-
self innocent inlthe eyes -of the em-
ployer-stacked Subversive Activities

This provision of the bill.',' which
_ would take away a union’s bargaining
rights before a hearing is even held,
exposes the real motives of the,anti-
labor forces behind Butler. They're not
after Communists, Socialists, subver-
sives. or what have you. They're after
unions. The American Mining Congress,
General Motors, General Electric, U. S.
Steel and other corporations are be-
hind this bill—and for a reason. '

' A hint of’ what Senator Butler
.means by “subversive” was shown in

his statement  the Senate last May "

thievery, for stamps, typewriters, and ‘
other equipment were untouched. Noth-*

ing else is-missing as far as can be
determined, but the prowlers were ap-

parently interested in the affairs of-

the Union.‘ After smashing the lock on
the door, they broke open desks and
filing cabinetsand went through the
contents. ‘ "

The ‘job bears all the appearance of
having been done by “investi_gators’.'.
for one or another witch-hunting com-

" mittee or agency seeking to fabricate

their usual type of frameup.

Board Member Albert ,Pezzati’point-
ed to the possibility that the thieves

may have taken blank stationery with- I

to fake letters or other forgeries which ‘

could /be used to try to harm the Union.

 * URANIUM CITY, Sask.-—-Efforts by a

, uranium mining company to refuse recogni-

tion and block certification of Mine-Mill as
bargaining‘ agent by charging it was “Commu-
nist-dominated?’ have been summarily re-
ected by the Saskatchewan Labor Relations
oard. . T
In a Judgment handed down July 24 and
just received by THE UNION, the govern-
ment Board brushed aside the company’s
attempt to deny the workers their Union

\ I _ choice and ordered bargaining rights certifi-

cation for Beaverlodge District Mine, Mill and
smelter" Workers Local»913 at the mine.

' The company involved is'Rix-Athabasca
‘Uranium Mines Ltd., at whose uranium
mining property here the Union had applied
for certification by the Saskatchewan Labor
Board last May after an intensive organiza-
tional campaign amongst the workers.

, _‘ .AT SUBSEQUENT hearings by the
Board on the Union’s application, M. A. Mac-

-Pherson, company lawyer and former—Attor-.

,ney General for Saskatchewan in the Conserv-
ative government, had argued that the appli-
_catlon should be denied “for reasons of
security” and because, he charged,.the Union
fvas “Communist-domi-nated:”T

Vote of Keno Hill

V KENO HILL, Y. T.—A conciliation
officer left Vancouver October 26 to
take a certification ballot at United

.,Yukon Territory, on November 3 and 4.

The ballot follows application to the
Canada Labor Board for certification
by Local 924, Mayo District Mine, Mill

Meanwhile, while awaiting the ballot-,
camp committees have -been busily
drafting contract proposals.

 geyiocrders compcmy to bargain with Mine-Mill

Representing Mine-Mill at the hearings
was Int’l rep. W. Longridge of Calgary,
assisted by K.- A. Smith of Vancouver, presi-
dent of the Canadian Mine-Mill Council.

As explained in the Judgment, the com-
pany had argued that the Board should not
grant certification but that the matter should
be referred to the government of Canada “for
such action—._as might be thought expedient”

since, the company lawyer said, “the produc-

tion of uranium has a particular significance
in the defense of the nation . . .”

aIn rgﬁng out the company’s arguments
and ordering bargaining certification for
Mine-Mill Local 913, the Judgment of the
Board declared “there is no proof that the
applicant trade union is in fact communist-
d0minated.” ‘In addition the Board pointed‘
out: “It should be noted also that locals of the
International Union of,Mine, Milli-& Smelter
Workers. have acted as collective bargaining
agents for the employees of some of the
largest and most important mines in Canada.”

FURTHERMORE, the Judgment stated:

“When considering the possibility of calling ,

the ‘ attention of the Government of Canada

AN ELECTION supervised by the Board
resulte in a 2-to-1 vote for Local 913,
which, the Judgmentdeclared, ‘was “emphatic
endorsement of the (Union’s)application,” and
ordered certification as bargaining agent. _

VANCOUVER, B.C.-—Over 200 delegates ltothe
‘-B.c. Trade ‘Union Congress, (TLC-AFL), directed
their conventionin a manner remarkably different
to that adopted by the concurrent, International‘
Woodworkers‘ of America convention also held in

this city.

In place of verbosespeeches from ‘trade union‘
leaders’ such as characteri_zed the IWA meet, the
display of scantily-dressed girls ‘publicizing. the
_. union label on .one company’s product,--and the pri-
'/»; vate bar for theuse of delegates, the TUC conven-' -

tion heard only one main spea‘k’er«,,Percyi Bengough,
TLC _pres-ident, and then 4 got down to ibusiness
- wrestling with the day-to-day problems of the rank

and file."

‘THE CONVENTION directly opposed the raid-~
ing of the United Fishermen and Allied Workers
* Union, suspended from the «TLC, by the SIU which,
. with no success althoughfsupportédﬂ by Bengough

and 8.90 in Bayard, N. M.

J. B. Chavez of Local 501 and A. J.
Price of Local 4415, who acted respect-
igely as temporary chairman and sec-
retary, "were replaced by permanent
officers. Elected by acclamation for

~ one-year terms were Gabriel Cedillo of

Local 903, chairman; S. A. Farmer of

Local 415, vice chairman; and Frank-

Alderette of Local‘ 890, recording sec-
retary. Int’l rep. M. H. Ross of Carls-

OMAHA MEMBERS WANT umrv I

To the Editor:
As you are editor of the Union

. paper, we of Local 461 want you to

know that we,are very dissatisfied with
the paper during this election period.
We feel that our paper should be a
means of unifying our members, not
causing a lot of friction between locals
from different sections of the country.
The last issue of the paperhas caused
a lot of wondering on officers and mem-
bers seeking office. A lot of opinion
here is that,some of the officers and
men seeking offices are not the type
they want‘ to represent them. ’
y We the undersigned will do every-
thing in our power to see that the offi-
cial organ of the International Union
shall be used for union business only.
The undersigned would like this
printed in the next issue of the paper.
' Fraternally yours,
GEORGE EASTMAN, President
Local 461, Omaha, Nebr.

The most important bit of news is
that Local 117 was represented at the
_ Mine Mill Aix.\'iliai'ies*,.Convention in
‘ St. Louis, Missouri. For the first time
inithree years, our delegate was able
to be at -the Convention to give reports
of the wide—spread activities of Local
117. Auxiliary 117 was very ably rep-
resented by Sister Bea Stevenson, who,
on her return gave a thorough and in-
teresting report of this important
gatheriiig. , —’
Next in importance was our Annual
‘Bazaar, which was a record breaker as
success goes. The girls had draws.
bake sales, teas and raffles before the‘
actual bazaar took ‘place, in order to
_raise money for materials, etc. On
_'Sept.' 29 a})vely tea and bazaar were
held in the afternoon, and later a social
evening of food, fun and dancing, when
the major draws took place.‘ “Finan-
cially and otherwise, the whole affair
was tops.
ASIDE FROM the Conventionand
bazaar, 117 has been busy with many
other phases of work. Action has been

-Worker Killed, seven injured,
in East St. Louis smelter

EAST ST. LOUIS, Ill.—One man
was killed and seven injured last week
in. the American Zinc smelter here.
While no information about the tragedy
was available from company sources
at press time for THE UNION, work-
ers in the plant believed it was caused
by poisonous gas. \

Jose Granda, a furnace_man of 29
years’ service, lost his life. Three other
men who were working in the same dc,-
partment were hospitalized. Four who
went in to carry them out were under
a doctor’s care. '

Very‘ shortly afterward, a fire oc-
curred in the same department, ‘a se-
vere blaze which was put out" by city
firemen.

-‘After 29 years as a furnaceman,

Granda was transferred oniNovember
2 to the germanium department as the
result of a large-scale-‘layoff,’ the sec-
ond within a month.

On‘ November 3,/Granda was dead
within 10 minutes after starting work.
There were indications that the com-
pany would attempt to,use the charge
of carelessness to blame ,him for his
own death. _

Leaders of Mine-Mill Local 82 were
planning to investigate and take appro-
priate action on behalf of-Grandals
family, the injured worke1°s'and for
the safety of all in the plant.

The entire day shift left the plant
on November 3 as soon as news of
Granda’s death was known.

with,l0°/o bonus hike

GILMAN, Co1o.—By unanimous vote
of the membership of Local 581, the
nine—Week Empire Zinc strike here was
brought to an end last week. Settle-
-ment terms included a 10‘perceri-t in--
crease in the contract bonus rate for
miners. A two-year agreement was
signed, with a wage reopener‘ any time
after six months.

The union ended the strike stronger
than when it walked out on August 31.
lnt’l rep. Leo Ortiz reported that many
former non-member-s——alli who ‘were
here when the strike ended——slgned up
in the union, and there is greater unity
than ever before.

The officers and members are plan-
ning to build their union stronger and
be ready to gain a substantial wage
advance under the wage reopener.

Officers of Local 581 expressed their
thanks for contributions they have re-
ceived from other local unions of the
United States and Canada. '

Eltriunfo aparente del Co. J. B.
Chavez para miembro de la mesa di-
ectiva internacional para el Distrito"

(léase en otro articulo en esta pa-
gina) marca otra etapa en la lucha d“el
pueblo mexico-americano hacia la rep-
resentacién y la igualdad no solo en
‘Mine-Mill pero también en el sentido

. general. -~

Debeliacerse hincapié al hecho de
que aunque Mine-Mill es uno de los
uindicatos mas progresivos en el pais,
mi sindicato segundo a ningun otro'
en extender la democracia a todos sus '
miembros y, en particular a sus miem-
bros de grupos minoratorios, sin em-
bargo ni en Mine-Mill habia repre-
sentacién en el liderato lnternacional
para nus miembros mexico-americanos.

Esta eleccién cambia este incorrecto
estado de cosas. Ahora por la primera
vez, en la historia de Mine-Mill, sus
miembros -mexico-americanos, los
cuales estén concentrados en el Dis-
trito 2 de la uni6n (este distrito abarca
- _. ‘~ los estados de Texas, Nuevo Mexico,
Utah y Nevada) tienen un represen-
tante en el concilio supremo de Mine-
Mill, la mesa directiva internacional.

ESTA tremenda Victoria culmina diez
aﬁos de efectiva labor hacia este“fin
 E r ‘or parte de los mexico-americanos de
' V a7uni6n con el respaldo de sus com-

paﬁeros anglos. El significado de est_a
eleccién es que representa una Victoria
vno _solo para los miembros mexico-
".-.-_ americanos sino también para los
"miembros "angle; Representa un
fuerte avance hacia la unidad angle-
, Vmexicanafen la union. Esto es indi-
‘cado por el hecho de" que Chavez fué
electo a pesar. de ‘que sus dos con-
: *-if’ -: trincantes son dos de los mas e_fectivos
r 1“ ‘y populares lideres anglos de la uni6n—-
B A es decir, C. D. Smotherman, el miem-
, bro actual de la mesa directiva na-
 /cional; para el Distrito 2, y Albert

 ‘Este gran triunfo debe’ estimular-

Carin del Pres. Clurkiiempo
sobre el cuso Jenqks

DENVER———La semana pasada John A
~C_lark, el presidente de Mine-Mill y

quien también estuviera al frente del
Comité de Defensa Jencks, envié una
carta importantisima a los locales de
Mine-Mill sobre el Caso Jencks.

Entre otras cosas dice: “Como Uds.
saben nV'os queda menos de un mes
antesfde que empieze el juicio de
Jencksjen El Paso. Durante las sema-
nas restantes es importanteque con-

centremos en la campaﬁa de defensa

pro-Jencks.” V

Indica que los folletos sobre el Caso
Jencks ya deben estar en manos de
todo el personal. Es imperative que

se haga la mas amplia distribucién del‘
folleto entre los miembros de nuestra“

union. Al mismo, es importante con-
tactar a lideres de otras uniones ‘y a
organizaciones de la comunidad por

expresiones de apoyo y por contribu-

ciones de dinero.
Ademas dice que la defensa , do
Jencks esta costando mucho dinero, y

, es muy importante que se acele1‘e./la‘

campaﬁade coleccién de fondos para el
fondo de defensa. Todavia hay muchas

locales que no han contribuido. Otras“

solo han hecho una sola contribucion

pequeﬁa, Donde sea posible,‘ pide que.
los locales hagan contribuciones men-.

su‘ales mientras dure la defensa.

Aparte del urgente problema 0 del

fondos, hay dos otros puntos sobre los
cuales se debe concentrar atenciénx
1) expresiones‘ de apoyo a] C0. Jencks,

‘y 2) cartas y tarjetas de individuos!

de locales protestando al Fiscal Gen-
eral Brownell en Washington, D. C.
