private owners of property as a weap-
on for extorting a heavy and unnec-
essary tribute in rent, proﬁt ‘and in-

If elected, we pledge ourselves to do
all we can to carry out the following
program: -

1. The abolition of the occupation
tax.

2. A garbage disposal plant to dis-
T‘-0S6 of our garbage by modern scien-
tiﬁc methods.

3. Eight hours or less to constitute
\. day’s work for borough employees.

4. The borough itself to do street
raving and other work usually done
by contract. Thus to employ a great-
er number of citizens with the money
'vhich the contractor now takes as

roﬁts.

5. In case of strike or lockout, to
urotect and prevent disorders in the
‘own by prohibiting the importation
f special police, detvéctives, thugs or
‘ny member of the criminal class.

6. Revenue producing enterprises

such as Borough scales, etc.
7. Public comfort stations to be
established at once.

What Socialism Is.

“The «ethics of socialism are iden-
tical with the ethics of christianity.”
—Encyclop'edia Britanica.

“It is simply applied Christianity:

the Golden Rule applied to every" day
life.”—Prof. R. P. Ely.

“Let no man fear the name of
“Socialism”. The movement of the
working class for justice by any other
name would be just as terrible.”-—
Father William Barry.

“A science -of reconstructing society
on an entirely new basis, by substi-
tuting the principle of association for
that of competition in every branch of
human industry.”—-—Worcester Diet.

When the worker goes to the ballot
box and votes for the full value of the
rroduct of his labor, he will not vote
the same ticket his master does, he
will vote the Socialist Ticket.

“They that can give up essential
liberty to obtain .a little temporary
safety. deserve neither liberty nor
safety.”——Benj. Franklin.

Men have ceased to be free men
when they must gain the consent of
others in order that they may earn a
living for themselves and those (le-

pendendent upon them. Is this true
or not?

If the working class cast their bal-
lots for the capitalist class for legis-
lative and executive positions why
should they “weep and howl” when
the law is m.ade and administered in
the interest of the capitalist class?

Under the present capitalist system’

of production the lives, the hopes,
and happiness of men, women and
children are ground up to produce

spreading discontent, but they have

never been able to compete with the

So long as some men have the power

to govern other men’s lives, either
through political control of the state
or economy control of industry, there
can be no genuine democracy.

The Socialist Party.

Its Aims and Purposes

The Socialist Party of the United
States is the political expression of
the interests of the Workers in this
country, and is part of the inter-
national working-class movement.

The economic basis of pnesent day
society is the private ownership and
control of the socially necessary means
of production, and the exploitation of
the Workers who operate these means
of production for the proﬁt of those
who own them.

The interests of these two classes
are diametrically opposed. It is the
interest of the capitalist class to
maintain the present system and to
Jbtain for themselves the largest pos-
sible share of the product of labor.
It is the interest of the working class
to improve their conditions of life
and get the largest possible share of
their own products so long as the
present system prevails, and to end
this system as quickly as they can.

Insofar as the members of the op-
posing classes become conscious of
these facts, each strives to advance
its own interests as against the other.
it is this active conflict of interests
which we describe as the class struggle.

The capitalist class, by controlling
the old political parties, controls the
powers of the state and uses them
to secure and entrench its position.
Without such control of th-e state its
cosition of -economic power would be
untenable. The workers must wrest
the control of the government from
the hands of the masters and use its
powers in the upbuilding of the new
social order, the Clo-operative Com-
anonwealth.

The Socialist Party seeks to or-
rranize the wiorking class for independ-
ent action on the political ﬁeld, not
:n»enely for the betterment of their
conditions, but also and above all with

the revolutionary aim of putting an
end to exploitation and class rule. Such
political action i-s absolutely neces-
sary to the emancipation of the work-
ing class, and the establishment of
genuine liberty for all.

To accomplish this aim, it is neces-
sary that the working class be power-
fully and solidly organized also on the
economic field, to struggle for the
same revolutionary goal; and the So-

task of promoting such industrial or-
ganization and waging such industrial
struggle for emancipation.

The fundamental aim of the So-
cialist Party is to bring about the
social ownership and democratic con-
trol of all the necessary means of
_groductivon——to eliminate proﬁt, rent
and intenest, and make it impossible
for any to share the product Without
of labor—to
;hange our class society into a society
:f equals, in which the interest of one
will be the interest of all.

As subordinate and accessory to this
fundamental aim, i-t supports every
measure which betters the conditions
of the working class and which in-
creases the ﬁghting power of that
class within the present system.
