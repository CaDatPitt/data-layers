STRIKEVOTE THIS WEEK -

MINE-hIILL' members across the United
States will march to the polls Thursday and
Friday, July 16' and 17, in a gigantic demon-
stration of solidarity behind ther 1953 bar-V
gaining demands. On those days will take
place the nationwide strike vote called by the
National Wage Policy Committee as the result
of brazen stalling and lack of good faith on
the part of employers in the basic sections

of the non-ferrous metals industry.

The strike vote will be taken among work- _
, ers in" those basic sections. All major chains
. and areas of Mine-Mill’s non-ferrous jurisdic-

_tion will be involved.

_ The uniform language on strike ballots
all over the country was included in the call
for a strike vote sent _to participating local
unions on June 29~b_v the International Execu-
tive Board and National Wage Policy Commit-

tee. The ballots will read as follows:

“Do ‘you authorize the International Execu-
tive Board, in consultation with the National
Wage Policy Committee and your local negotiat-
ing committee to take strike action, it and when
necessary,| in order to support our wage and
contract demands? Yes ................ ._, No ................. .."

"ACCORDING TO the strike vote call, the

Vol. XII. No. 8

National Wage Policy Committee determined
that a strike vote is necessary because nego-
tiations with every major company were dead-
locked. I ‘ .

Observing that contract deadlines expired
on June 30 in Kennecott, Anaconda, and Amer-
ican Smelting and Refining; the Executive
Board declared: .

“The employers are engaged in their usual
stalling tactics. Our membership sees no rea-
son why they should wait patiently all sum-
mer before the operators get around to a set-
tlement. So we have set the strike vote date
at tl1e' earliest moment possible, taking into
account the present status of negotiations in
various. sections of the country.”

NEGOTIATIONS in the main have been
deadlocked because of the larger employers’
ridiculous complaints that they “are unable’
to pay” wage increases. Some companies have
even attempted to cuttwages.

The union’s reply to such nonsense has
been the same in all chains and areas. Typical
of t.he‘union?s attack is the leaflet distributed
in all AS&R.locals. The leaflet answers the
company’s “poverty” claims with statistics
showing that AS&R last year made $1,665 in

 wage increazse id in

 SUBSTANTIAL wage increase can
’be won this year by Mine-Mill. '

That fact was proved in the last
two weeks in two wa__vs—— ‘ ‘
—Offers of wage increases were
made to Mine-Mill negotiating com-
mittees in widely separated points by
two of the largest corporations in
the industry. The offers were made
almost’ immediately after our Union
announced it had set July 16-17 for
a_ nationwide strike vote. ’

cents to more than 13 cents were
made in secondary sections of the
industry. .

The wage offers made’ to our Union,

in other basic industries, detn.>n.st.rat-
ed that there is a wage increase in the
picture.

I’. S'.‘;l\’lE'l‘ALS Company in Car-
teret, New Jersey, has proposed a
wage increase of 8 cents across the

' board, plus an added one-half cent to
adjust wage inequities, in negotiations

_ _ with Local 837. U. S. Metals, which

i operates a huge copper refinery in
Carteret, is a subsidiary of American
Metals Ltd., largest copper-selling
corporation in the world.

‘At the same time, Kennecott Cop-
per Company made what- it called an
‘.‘offer” of three cents an hour to Lol-H .

7 cals 392 and_485 in Magna and Bing-
.ham, Utah. The offer, however, was
’ tied to a job evaluation program which
,_U'tah locals had rejected some time
ago. . ,  _ 1 , ,
 ».Tho developments in Kennecott and‘
,U.3' S.‘ Metals were in contrast -to.

 those in Anaconda. Thelvlontana man-

 agetnent of that major »corporation'

 

proposed an 8 cent wage cut. This,
however, was regarded as a company
maneuver to get away with a “cheap”
settlement of only a few cents an hour.

THE ANACONDA wage cut threat
was answered when well-attended
meetings of’ Butte Local 1 and Great
Falls Local 16 unanimously__ approved
the‘ industry-wide strike vote. Prep-
arations for a big turnout in the strike
ballotllfg July 16-17 were made
throughout Montana.

A 15-cents-an-hour wage increase, the union
observes, would come to about $300 a year,
stillleaving $1,365 in clear profit-per-worker.

W hile. crying “poverty” AS&R has approp-

riated nearly four million dollars in additional .

compensation to a handful of wealthy execu-
tives in the last two years.

THE CHIEF technique of the employers is
to attempt to take advantage of present lead
and zinc prices, even though their financial
reports discount every “unable—to-pay” argu-
ment they advance. This is particularly true
in the copper industry, presently enjoying a
boom. , -

Reports of membership solidarity and
unity come into Denver daily from all over
the country. While the employers are acting

I “tough”, field reports indicate that the work-

ers are just as determined. Predictions of
“I00 per cent,’-’ and “90 per cent” votes to
authorize a strike prevail in almost every area. \

All strike balloting will be conducted un-
der the provisions of the International Con-
stitution, with emphasis being placed on the
fact that all Mine-Mill strike ballots are by
secret referendum vote. .

cent for improvement of the workers’
health and welfare program.
Local 449 in Danville ratified an
agreement with General Refractories
calling for an 81/; cent increase under

Facts about

Here are some facts every Mine-Mill
member should know about how and
why Clinton Jencks became the victim
of a Taft-Hartley “case.”

On April 20 Jencks was arrested in

.Baya.rd, N.’ M. by two FBI agents

from El Paso on the charge of “swear-
ihg falsely in writing to the NLRB” on
the two Taft-Hartley affidavit counts,
membership or affiliation with‘ the
Communist Party or any other so-
called “subversive” organization.

‘THE STORY goes back to April 1,
1947, when Jencks left his job in the

1 Clint Jencles ' °

AS&R smelter at Denver to work as a.

business agent for the Mine-Mill mem-
bership in sout-hwestern New Mexico.

With his leadership; the five separate -

local unions combined their strength in
Amalgamated Local 890, ‘began hard
work on training new leadership, mem-

-‘b‘ership_ activity, and shop steward or-

/

ganization on the job.

Amalgaination and stepped up activ-
ity of the union in the area resulted
in one victory after another in AS&R,
Kennecott, Empire Zinc and Illinois
Zinc. ,Maior battles were fought around
enforcement of the Mine-Mill contracts’
requirementsg_,_ a g a in st discrimination
regardless of race, creed, color or na-
tional origin. . ’ ‘

Employers began putting their heads

 together in an effort to draw the line

against further advances'by the union.

s

Political .office holders in Grant’ County_
also became worried over t.he’growing .

militancy and unity of» the working
people, most of whom are Mexican-

-American. They saw a'threat to their

traditional policy of “keeping the Mexi-
can-Americans in their places.”
AGAINST this background, ‘AS&R
led off with ,a wage-cutting drive in
1950. ‘Local 890 replied with a strike.
It lasted 39 days, ended with a wage
increase, instead of the cu: which the
company had tried to enforce.

The next major move was by Empire,

Zinc, a division of New Jersey Zinc,
which boasts one of ‘the worst anti-
labor records in the country. Empire
refused premium pay ‘for overtime,
paid vacations, collar-to-collar, and
other standard union benefits.

This led to the historic 15-month
Empire Zinc strike, which made head-
lines all oyer thiscountry and in many

I

other countries. The union won——the
workers went back into the E-Z mine
"more militant than ever.

EARLY this year, the Grant County
employers " opened a new offensive.
'.With hundreds unemployed because of
shutdowns in several lead-zinc proper-
ties, they tried to cut wages.” ‘As part
of this drive, they engineered a raid

by the AFL at Empire Zinc and at the

same time brought about the frameup
of J encks. >
Many of the Empire Zinc workers
were laid off because of slack opera-
tions. But they saw through the com-
'- pany maneuvers and voted for Mine-_
Mill. The election victory was a vote
of confidence for Brother Jencks as
well as for our union. i
AS.-‘PART of the background of the
case, it is important to know the facts
about Jencks. ’

5
Clinton Jencks was a smelter worker"

at AS&R’s Globe Smelter until he
went to work as .business agent in
Bayard in 1947. After the five locals
were amalgamated into the single Bay-
ard‘ Amalgamated Local 890, he was
elected president of 890 in 1948, a post
he held until 1951, whenhe became an
International Representative.

Jencks has -« become identified with
the fight of our union's Mexican-
American membership for first-class
citizenship on and off the job, and for
unity among all workers of whatever
origin. He is 35 years old. He was
highly honored for his combat service

during World War II, and holds several‘

Air‘Medals -and the Distinguished Fly-
ing Cross. ‘During the period ‘immedi-

ately after the war, he served as. 3/
regional vice president of the AmeriEan'

Veterans Committee.

FRONTIER ‘Magazine’ said in its
May issue:

' V A“(Jencks) has been a highly success-

ful local .890 leader in Grant County
for seven years without. interruption.
Wages have risen steadily, and Mexi-
can-Amerricans who made $3 '51 day
before the war are now making, $12 to

.318 a. day. The Mine-Mill Union has

broken down, some job discrimination
among the companies and mowaalcilled

work is_ .becoming available to the

,‘Mex'£can—Americans every year.”

The election climaxed a- long drawn-

local, which
started a year ago after a seven weeks’
successful strike. After t_he strike, the
company closed down more than half
of the operations and laid off more

ship, which included most of the Offi-
cers and Stewards. .
Then in late October ]'ust«as the
Local entered neg'otia‘tions, the AFL

We win again
  at Uranium

URANIUM ‘C I T Y, Saskatchewan-
Mine-Mill has won another major "vic-
tory in its‘ campaign to organize uran-
ium mines in this area. Some 70.'per

cent of. the workers at Rix Athabasca
Uranium Mines voted for Mine-Mill in
an election conducted by the Saskatche-

The heavy majority was scored in

spite of _the. fact that the company"

plugged the vote -list with its ‘staff

members and with “confidential”" em-

ployees. ‘ V '
Int’l."’rep. William Longridge, in

charge of'_tl1e campaign in this district, '
V commented: “This victory at the polls

expresses the desires‘ of the workers‘ in
this area to be represented by the Mine,
Mill & Smelter WorkersolUnion, and re-
futes the lurid press stories emanating
from here. - ‘

“Mine-Mill now has established the
right the right to bargain at ‘three.
properties in this field. We have one
more application pending before the

Labour Board, and are submitting ap-
plications for two more recently-orgam
ized mines.

“‘Negotiations‘are now proceeding at
Nesbitt-Labine operations with consid-.
erable progress having been made to-
ward reaching a collective bargaining.
agreement,” Longridge added. '

The aim of the. union in the uranium
industry, said Longridge, is simply “to
achieve equal wages and conditions her.e
as are now being enjoyed by some 25,-
000 of ourjmembers employed by Inter.
national ‘Nickel Co. and. Consolidating
Mining & Smelting Co., at Sudbury,
Port Colborne, Trail, Kimberley ‘and

Calgary.”- A ‘
Longridge has protested to the La-
bour ‘Relations Board at Ottawa

against delay in ruling on our applica-

tion for an election at Eldorado Mining V

& ‘Refining Co.

Mine-Mill has-90% of-the Vk’01'l{e1_‘S‘:‘[

signed up, Longridge said, and the

-company is not contesting, the union’s '

application.

  CMSpenSioni wring   
partial union victory - 

TRAIL, B. C.—Chairman E. W. Low-

ery and Union Representative Harvey '

Murphy of the Board of Conciliation
sitting on the pensions plan’ dispute
between Locals 480, Trail, and §5l
Kimberley, and the. Consolidated Min-
ing and Smelting Company, have ruled
that pensions come under “conditions

of-work” within the meaning of the

Industrial Conciliation and Arbitration

Act, and are therefore under the juris-do
diction of the board. ‘ . J

In view, however, of the company
refusal to negotiate on any Vofthe ‘pro-
—visions of thepension plan, no recom-
mendation wasimade on this point as
“it isevident that finding’ with regard

_.to pensions would not conciliate the

matter to the satisfaction of both par-‘
ties.”

Socred victory ends

Tory influence in B.C.

VANCOUVER, B. C.~—Nineteen So-
cial Creditors have already been elect-
ed on the count of second-choice votes,
to‘ 12 Cooperative Commonwealth Fed-
eration members, and with Socreds
leading in ten seats and the CCF in
only 2, it is- certain that the Socreds
have been re-elected with a greatly in-

creased majority. _ . -
Until the counting of the second-.

choice votes, it might have been ‘any-
body/’s government, ‘and many. observ-
e‘rs thought that the CCF would. get the
bulk. of the Liberal second.-choices, thus
giving them a chance for power. But
‘the Liberals gave a considerable edge

4 to the Socreds in most ridings, inspite
of aétacit deal between them and the "

CCF which was made apparent during
the election, and the probable result
will be 29 Socred seats, 14 CCF, three
‘Liberals, one Conservative, and one
Labor. V 
Latter is Tom Uphill of Fernie, who
has represented that constituency so

‘long that he has become an institution "

1 in B. C.’sl Legislature.

The result seems to have eliminated
the tory‘ Conservative Party as a pro-
vincial influence,-but as most of them
are now in Social ‘Credit, thenéw gov.-

‘ ernment cannot be regarded as any-

Ste. Genevieve warkers
handle raiding ,g unmen

STE. GENEVIEVE, Mo.—This is the
story of how the members of Mine-Mill
Local 883 defended their union against
company—backed raiders from District
50 of the UMW, even when the raiders
began to wave guns at them.

The raiders came on the sceneﬁthis
spring just as Local 883 began bar-
gaining with the MissVi.ssippiV_Lir'ne Com-

pa-ny-. The company quickly called off»

negotiations and. said that since Dis-
trict.50 claimed to represent a, majority

of the workers, Local 883 ought to con--«

sent to an election. 7, . -x
The Mississippi Lime workers, acted
quickly to prove .they considered l\jIine-
Mill their union. They walked out.in a
body. The plant was shut down tight.
The company then consented to bargaain
with Local 883, aglilli a letter saying
they recognized 3V 
ing agent. , _§‘,§, ~ .-

mendations of its bargaining commit-

tee, and render a decision at anearly ‘

date, and in any event before the new‘
agreement expires,” and that they
should also study. a federal government
report on pensions plans, which states-

’ a worker should receive -a pension at

the age of 50.

, Along with the company representa-
tive, D. D. Morris," the board recom-
mended that the 1952 agreement should -
be continued for another year; and
that, three weeks vacation with pay be

. given after fifteen ‘years service. V

Other recommendations were that
Cominco should “immediately review
those affected by the recent crew’ re-
duction ‘in Kimberley, and state which
of‘ these men will be acceptable for the
new fertilizer plant at Marysvillef’,

Also, “if after present crews are re-
ducednto the point where the company
considers they are normal, a mass lay-
off is necessary, the company will
notify the local_concel'ned prior to such
lay-off in orderfthat the local may
p;';2s’ent their views regarding the lay-
o .’. '0 - .

fingers on the triggers as they backed
out of the schoolhouse and across the
lawn. . ‘ ‘

THE MINE-MILL members, aroused
by the gunplay, quite naturally ‘fol-
lowed. When one of the gunmen broke
into a run, he was ‘overtaken by a
group of citizens who took away his
gun and beat-him. The three remaining
gun-men ran into a nearby home,

frightening ‘ an elderly woman;’ they.

held the workers off with threats t
shoot and-kill. . - -

«The incident finally ended when ‘the.

five ‘gunmen were arrested. Two other
.District 50'men got away. _Charge's, on
which hearings will be held” this month,

were filed againstiall seven of the;

raiders by Ste. Genevieve citizens.

But by then thé’people of ‘the town
were aroused, and ’many of them sur-

rounded the City “Hall where thefigun-' W

men were being heldf. The Mayor called
in Local 883 presidefnt Kimmel and said
that he was asking the Governor to

send‘ in militia to “protect the people.’’.

REALIZING that martial law would)

VV_further disrupt bargaining. the union

leaders quickly urged the people ‘around

This they did. The-‘next day the five

raiders Were released on $25,000 bondﬂ‘

drew as a candidate for Director of theiU.S. Bureau of Mines. A .

‘an important part in forcinghis ‘withdrawal. A '

' The facts were exposed in‘ a study of his “testimony before the

he called “police action”—I_n'eaning en-
forcement of safety laws. ‘

Jackson asked if Lyon’s views on
mine safety were “shared by the De-
partment of Interior.” Lyon replied:
“I haven’t discussed it with the De-
partment of Interior.”

WHEN SENATOR JACKSON said

it vs7as.“rather amazing” that nobody

in the Interior Department had asked "

his views on mine safety, in view of the
fact that the Bureau of Mines was

founded “for the purpose of promot- '

ing the health and safety of miners,”
all Lyon had to say was: “That is all.
right. I believe in the promotion of
health and safety.” ’
Senator Clements then asked if
Lyon thought it was “a mistake that.

QUESTION": Why do we need to get‘
both average earnings figures and also
the history of the prices when we are
forcing the company to give us data?‘ '
ANSWER: Suppose your mine is one
where the mining condition; are'g‘e_t-_
tingmore difficult all the ,time—moro'l
badground, further to haul‘ muck, or , A 
some such factors. Then, even if the  
prices were originally fair, and had ‘i "
kept pace, percentagéyvise, with tho_A
raisesin day’s pay, th<?’contract earn-
ings would have dropped, or failed’ to
keep pace with day’s pay raises. The
figures would show it, and you could.
demand adjustments in the prices to  
make uprfor the adverse mining con-  :_,-1
ditions. ' ' i T‘ ’ ' "

When/the miners gradually get more “
experienced, or safety is being ne-
glected, or there is excessive speed-up,
then sometimes even though mining _
conditions haven’t become markedly’ f "S
easier, the‘ earnings can be up without’ '
contract prices having been properly _ .

   

    
       
         
       
     
       
        
       
 

This then/ means that the miners 
aren’t getting as much for the extra
production as they did before. The —;
prices should be raised in spite of the" . _
slightly increased. earnings and at-‘ ' ”
tcntion paid to safety and coriditions.

DENVER, Colo.—El trabajador de cobre‘ hoy produce
