It is expected that conservative and isolationist groups through-
out the country will bitterly assail Mr. Willkie for‘ representing
the Communist leader before the Supreme Court, but it is known
that Mr. Willkie is of the opinion that What he believes is the
fundamental principle involved in the case far transcends any of
these possible attacks.’

He is known to feel that despite the fact that Mr. Schneiderman
is an admitted member of the Communist Party, the individual
liberties of an American citizen, and not the Communist Party,
will be on trial during the appeal. If the Supreme Court upholds
the decision of the lower courts, Mr. Willkie believes that a danger-
ous and decidedlyun-American precedent will have been set that
would permit court reviews of the citizenship of all naturalized
Americans- Such a step, Mr. Willkie is said to believe, would be
contrary to all the principles of the American way of life and would
cast a doubt on every naturalized citizen.——New York Times, No-
vember 29, 1941. A

Two days ago Wendell Willkie, defeated Presidential candidate
of the so-called conservative party, stood before our highest court
to plead the case of a Communist. It was not an instance of a law-
yer obligated by legal ethics to defend a client. Mr. Willkie ac-

 

cepted the case without fee because he believed that an injustice-

was being. done which violated our democratic concept of govern-
ment. The merits of the case remain to be decided; but Mr.
Willkie, for his action, deserves the thanks of all Americans.—Edi-

William Schneiderman, Petitioner, On Writ of Certiorari to the
United States Circuit Court

The United States of America. Circuit.

as.

[June 21, 1943]
Mr. Justice MURPHY delivered the opinion of the Court.

We brought this case here on certiorari, 314 U. S. 597, because
of its importance and its possible relation to freedom of thought.
The question is whether the naturalization of petitioner, an ad-
mitted member of the Communist Party o-f the United States,
was properly set aside by the courts below some twelve years
after it was granted. We agree with our brethren of the minority
that our relations with Russia, as well as our views regarding
its government and the merits of Communism are immaterial to
a decision of this case. Our concern is with what Congress meant
by certain statutes and whether the Government has proved its
case under them. ’

While it is our high duty to carry out the will of Congress, in
the performance of this duty we should have a jealous regard for
the rights of petitioner. We should let our judgment be guided
so far as the law permits by the spirit of freedom and tolerance
in.which our nation was founded, and by a desire to secure the

blessings of liberty in thought and action to all those upon whom '

the right of American citizenship has been conferred by statute,
as well as to the native born. And we certainly should presume
that Congress was motivated by these lofty principles.

We are directly concerned only with the rights of this peti-
tioner and the circumstances surrounding his naturalization, but
we should not overlook the fact that we are a heterogeneous people.
In some of our larger cities a majority of the school children are
the offspring of parents only one generation, if that far, removed
from the steerage of the immigrant ship, children of those who
sought refuge in the new world from the cruelty and oppression of
the old, where men have been burned at the stake, imprisoned, and

9

driven into exile in countless numbers for their political and re-
ligious beliefs. Here they have hoped to achieve a political status
as citizens in a free world in which men are privileged to think and

‘act and speak according to their convictions, without fear of

punishment or further exile so long as they keep the peace and
obey the law.

This proceeding was begun on June 30, 1939, under the pro-
visions of § 15 of the Act of June 29, 1906, 34 Stat. 596, to cancel
petitioner's certiﬁcate of citizenship granted in 1927. This section
gives the United States the right and the duty to set aside and
cancel certiﬁcates of citizenship on the ground of “fraud” or on the
ground that they were “illegally procured.”1 The complaint charged
that the certiﬁcate had been illegally procured in that petitioner was

' not, at the time of his naturalization, and during the ﬁve years

preceding his naturalization “had not behaved as, a person attached
to the principles of the Constitution of the United States and well
disposed to the good order and happiness of the United States? but
in truth and in fact during all of said times, respondent [petitioner]
was a member of and affiliated with and believed in and supported
the principles of certain organizations then known -as the Workers
(Communist) Party of America and the Young Workers (Com-
munist) League of America, whose principles were opposed to the
principles of the Constitution of the United States and advised, ad-
vocated and taught the overthrow of the Government, Constitution
and laws of the United States by force and violence.” The complaint
also charged fraudulent Procurement in that petitioner concealed
his Communist affiliation from the naturalization court. The Govern-
ment proceeds here not upon the charge of fraud but upon the charge
of illegal procurement. -_

This is not a naturalization proceeding in which the Government
is being asked to confer the privilege of citizenship upon an appli-
cant. Instead the Government seeks to turn the clock back twelve
years after full citizenship was conferred upon petitioner by a
judicial decree, and to deprive him of the priceless beneﬁts that de-
rive from that status. In its consequences it is more serious than a
taking of one’s property, or the imposition of a ﬁne or other penalty.
For it is safe to assert that nowhere in the world today is the right
of citizenship of greater worth to an individual than it is in this
country. It would be diﬂicult to exaggerate its value and importance.
By many it is regarded as the highest hope of civilized men. This
does not mean that once granted to an alien, citizenship cannot be
revoked or cancelled on legal grounds. But such a right once con-

10

 

 

ferred should not be taken ‘away without the clearest sort of justiﬁ-
cation and proof. So, whatever may be the rule in a naturalization
proceeding (see United States V. Momzi, 276 U. S. 463, 467), in an
action instituted under § 15 for the purpose of depriving one of the
precious right of citizenship previously conferred we believe the
facts and the law should be construed as far as is reasonably pos-
sible in favor of the citizen. Especially is this so when the attack is
made long after the time When the certiﬁcate of citizenship was
granted‘ and the citizen has meanwhile met his obligations and has
committed no act of lawlessness. It is not denied that the burden of
proof is on the.Government in this case. For reasons presently to be
stated this burden must be met with evidence of a clear and con-
vincing character that when citizenship was conferred upon peti-
tioner in 1927 it was not done in accordance with strict legal re-
quirements.

We are dealing here with a court decree entered after an op-
portunity to be heard. At the time petitioner secured his certiﬁcate

‘ of citizenship from the federal district court for the Southern Dis-

trict of California notice of the ﬁling of the naturalization petition
was required to be given ninety days before the petition was acted
on (§ 5 of the Act of 1906), the hearing on the petition was to take
place in open court (§ 9), and the United States had the right to
appear, to cross-examine petitioner and his witnesses, to introduce
evidence, and to oppose the petition (§ 11). In acting upon the peti-
tion the district court exercised the judicial power conferred by
Article III of the Constitution, and the Government had the right
to appeal from the decision grantingjlaturalization. Tutzm V. United
States, 270 U. S. 568. The record before us does not reveal the
circumstances under which petitioner was naturalized except that
it took place in open court. We do not know Whether or not the
Government exercised its right to appear and to appeal. Whether
it did or not, the hard fact remains that we are here re-examining
a judgment, and the rights solemnly conferred under it.

This is the ﬁrst case to come before us in which the Government
has sought to set aside a decree of naturalization years after it was
granted on a charge that the ﬁnding of attachment was erroneous.
Accordingly for the ﬁrst time We have had to consider the nature
and scope of the Government’s right in a denaturalization proceeding
to re-examine a ﬁnding and judgment of attachment upon a charge
of illegal procurement. Because of the View We take of this case
we do not reach, and therefore do not consider, two questions which
have been raised concerning the scope of that right,

11

The ﬁrst question is whether, aside from grounds such as lack of
jurisdiction or the kind of fraud which traditionally vitiates judg-
ments, cf. United States V. Throckmorton, 98_U. S. 61; Kibbe V.
Benson, 17 Wall. 624, Congress can constitutionally attach to the
exercise of the judicial power under Article‘ III of the Constitution,
authority to re-examine a judgment granting a certiﬁcate of citizen-
ship after that judgment has become ﬁnal by exhaustion of the
appellate process or_by a failure to invoke it.3

The second question is whether under the Act of 1906 as it was
in 1927 the Government, in the absence of a claim of fraud and
relying wholly upon a charge of illegal procurement, can secure a
de nova re-examination of a naturalization court’s ﬁnding and judg-
ment that an applicant for citizenship was attached to the principles
of the Constitution. 4

We do not consider these questions. For though we assume, with-
out deciding, that in the absence of fraud a certiﬁcate of naturaliza-
tion can be set aside under § 15 as “illegally procured” because the
ﬁnding as to attachment would later seem to be erroneous, we are
of the opinion that this judgment should be reversed. If a ﬁnding
of attachment can be so reconsidered in a denaturalization suit, our
decisions make it plain that the Government needs more than a bare
preponderance of the evidence to prevail. The remedy afforded the
Government by the denaturalization statute has been said to be a
narrower one than that of direct appeal from the granting of a
petition. Tutun V. United States, 270 U. S. 568, 579; cf. United
States V. Ness, 245 U. S. 319, 325. Johannessen V. United States
states that a certiﬁcate of citizenship is “an instrument granting
political privileges, and open like other public grants to be revoked
if and when it shall be found to have been unlawfully or fraudulently
procured. It is in this respect closely analogous to a public grant of
land, . . .” 225 U. S. 227, 238. See also Tutun V. United States, supra.
To set aside such a grant the evidence must be “clear, unequivocal,
and convincing”—“it cannot be done upon a bare preponderance of
evidence which leaves the issue in doubt”. Maxwell Land-Grant Case,
121 U. S. 325, 381; United States V. San Jacinto Tin Co., 125 U. S.
273, 300; cf. United States V. Rovin, 12 F. 2d 942, 944. See Wig-
more, Evidence, (3d Ed.) § 2498. This is so because rights once
conferred should not be lightly revoked. And more especially is this
true when the rights are precious and when they are conferred by
solemn adjudication, as is the situation when citizenship is granted.
The Government’s evidence in this case does not measure up to this
exacting standard.

Certain facts are undisputed. Petitioner came to this country
from Russia in 1907 or 1908 when he was approximately three. In
1922, at the age of‘ sixteen, he became a charter member of the
Young Workers (now Communist) League in Los Angeles and re-
mained a member until 1929 or 1930. In 1924, at the age of eighteen,
he ﬁled his declaration of intention to become a citizen. Later in the
same year or early in 1925 he became a member of the- Workers
Party, the predecessor of the Communist Party of the United States.
That membership has continued to the present. His petition for
naturalization was ﬁled on January 18, 1927, and his certiﬁcate of
citizenship was issued on June 10, 1927, by the United States Dis-
trict Court for the Southern District of California. He had not been
arrested or subjected to censure prior to 1927,4 and there is nothing
in the record indicating that he was ever connected with any overt

. illegal or violent action or with any disturbance of any sort.

For its case the United States called petitioner, one Humphreys,
a former member of the Communist Party, and one Hynes, a Los
Angeles police officer formerly in charge of the radical squad, as
witnesses, and introduced in evidence a number of documents. Peti-
tioner testiﬁed on his own behalf, introduced some documentary evi-
dence, and read into the record transcripts of the testimony of two
university professors given in another proceeding.

Petitioner testiﬁed to the following: As a boy he lived in Los
Angeles in poverty stricken circumstances and joined the Young
Workers League to study what the principles of Communism had
to say about the conditions of society. He considered his member-
ship and activities in the League and the Party_ during the ﬁve-year
period between the ages of sixteen and twenty-one before he was
naturalized, as an attempt to investigate and study the causes and
reasons behind social and economic conditions. Meanwhile he was
working his way through night high school and college. From 1922

.to about 1925 he was “educational director” of the League. The

duties of this non-salaried position were to organize classes, open
to the public, for the study of Marxist theory, to register students
and to send out notices for meetings; petitioner did no teaching.
During 1925 and 1926 he was corresponding secretary of the Party
in Los Angeles; this was a clerical, not an executive position. In
1928 he became an organizer or oﬂicial spokesman for the League.
His ﬁrst executive position with the Party came in 1930 when he
was made an organizational secretary ﬁrst in California, then in
Connecticut and later in Minnesota where he was the Communist
Party candidate for governor in 1932. Since 1934.he has been a
13

 


H

 

member of the Party’s National Committee. At present he is sec-
retary of the Party in California.

Petitioner testiﬁed further that during all the time he has be-
longed to the League and the Party he has subscribed to the prin-
ciples of those organizations. He stated that he “believed in the
essential correctness of the Marx theory as applied by the Com-
munist Party of the United States”, that he subscribed “to the
philosophy and principles of Socialism as manifested in the writ-
ings of Lenin”, and that his understanding and interpretation of
the program, principles and practice of the Party since he joined
“were and are essentially the same as those enunciated” in the
Party’s 1938 Constitution. He denied the charges of the complaint
and speciﬁcally denied that he or the Party advocated the overthrow
of the Government of the United States by force and violence, and
that he was not attached to the principles of the Constitution. He
considered membership in the Party compatible with the obligations
of American citizenship. He stated that he believed in retention of
personal property for personal use but advocated social ownership
of the means of production and exchange, with compensation to the
owners. He believed and hoped that socialization could be achieved
here by democratic processes but history showed [that the ruling
minority has always used force against the majority before sur-
rendering power. By dictatorship of the proletariat petitioner meant

» that the “majority of the people shall really direct their own des-

tinies and use the instrument of the state for these truly democratic
ends.” He stated that he would bear arms against his native Rus-
sia if necessary.

Humphreys testiﬁed that he had been a member of the Communist
Party and understood_he was expelled because he refused to take
orders from petitioner. He had been taught that present forms of
government would have to be abolished “through the dictatorship
of the proletariat” which would be established by “a revolutionary
process”. He asserted that the program of the Party was the so-
cialization of all property without compensation. With regard to
advocacy of force and violence he said: “the Communist Party took
the defensive, and put the ﬁrst users of force upon the capitalistic
government; they claimed that the capitalistic government would
resist the establishment of the Soviet system, through force and vio-
lence, -and that the working class would be justiﬁed in using force
and violence to establish the Soviet system of society.”

Hynes testiﬁed that he had been a member of the Party for eight
months in 1922. He stated that the Communist method of bringing

14

 

about a change in the form of government .is one of force and vio-
lence; he based this statement upon: “knowledge I have gained as
a member in 1922 and from what further knowledge I have gained
from reading various oﬁicial publications, published -and circulated
by the Communist Party and from observation and actual contact
with the activities of the Communist Party . . .”"‘ On cross examina-
tion Hynes admitted that he never attempted a philosophic analysis
of the literature he read, but only read it to secure evidence, reading
and underscoring those portions which, in his opinion, “had to do
with force or violence or overthrowing of this system of government
other than by lawful means provided in the Constitution.” He testi-
ﬁed that he never saw any behavior on petitioner’s part that brought
him into conflict with any law.

The testimony of the two professors discussed Marxian theory
as evidenced by the writings of Marx, Engels and Lenin, and con-
cluded that it did not advocate the use of force and violence as a
method of attaining its objective.

In its written opinion the district court held that petitioner’s
certiﬁcate of naturalization was illegally procured because the or-
ganizations to which petitioner belonged were opposed to the prin-
ciples of the Constitution and advised, taught and advocated the
overthrow of the Government by force and violence, and therefore
petitioner, “by reason of his membership in such organizations and
participation in their activities, was not ‘attached to the principles
of the Constitution of the United States and well disposed to the
good order and happiness of the same’.” 33 F. Supp. 510, 513.

The district court also made purported ﬁndings of facts to the
effect that petitioner was not attached to the principles of the Con-
stitution and well disposed to the good order and happiness of the
same, and was a disbeliever in organized government, that he
fraudulently concealed his membership in the League and the Party
from the naturalization court, and that his oath of allegiance was
false. The conclusion of law was that the certiﬁcate was illegally
and fraudulently procured. The pertinent ﬁndings of fact on these
points, set forth in the margin,“ are butthe most general conclusions
of ultimate fact. It is impossible to tell from them upon what un-
derlying facts the court relied, and whether proper statutory stand-
ards were observed. If it were not rendered unnecessary by the
broad view we take of this case, we would be inclined to reverse and
remand to the district court for the purpose of making adequate
ﬁndings.

The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed on the ground that the

15 '

 

 

certiﬁcate was illegally procured, holding that the ﬁnding that
petitioner’s oath was false was not “clearly erroneous”. 119 F. 2d
500.7 We granted certiorari_, and after having heard argument and
reargument, ‘now reverse the judgments below.

I

The Constitution authorizes Congress “to establish an uniform
rule of naturalization” (Art I, § 8, cl. 4), and we may assume that
naturalization is a privilege, to be given or withheld on such condi-
tions as Congress sees ﬁt. Cf. United States V. Macintosh, 283 U. S.
605, 615, and the dissenting opinion of Chief Justice Hughes, yibid.
at p. 627. See also Tutun V. United States, 270 U. S. 568, 578; Turner
V. Williams, 194 U. S. 279. But because of our ﬁrmly rooted tradi-
tion of freedom of belief, we certainly will not presume in constru-
ing the naturalization and denaturalization acts that Congress meant

‘to circumscribe liberty of political thought by general phrases in

those statutes. As Chief Justice Hughes said in dissent in the
Macintosh case, such general phrases “should be construed. not in
opposition to, but in accord with, the theory and practice of our
Government in relation to freedom of conscience.” 283 U. S. at 635.

See also Holmes, J ., dissenting in United States V. Schwimmer, 279.

U. S. 644, 653-55. ,
When petitioner was naturalized in 1927, the applicable statute
did not proscribe communist beliefs or afﬁliation as such.3 They
did forbid the naturalization of disbelievers in organized govern-
ment or members of organizations teaching such disbelief. Polyg-
amists and advocates of political assassination were also barred.9
Applicants for citizenship were required to take an oath to support
the Constitution, to bear true faith and -allegiance to the same and
the laws of the United States, and to renounce all allegiance to any
foreign prince, potentate, state or sovereignty.” And, it was to “be
made to appear to the satisfaction of the court” of naturalization
that immediately preceding the application, the applicant “has re-
sided continuously within the United States ﬁve years at least, . . .
and that during that time he has behaved as a man of good moral
character, attached to the principles of the Constitution of the
United States, and well disposed to the good order and happiness of
the same.”11 Whether petitioner satisﬁed this last requirement is

the crucial issue in this case.

To apply the statutory requirement of attachment correctly to the
proof adduced, it is necessary to ascertain its meaning. On its face
the statutory criterion is not attachment to the Constitution, but

» 16

 

 

behavior for a period of ﬁve years as a man attached to its principles

and well disposed to the good order and happiness of the United-

States. Since the normal connotation of behavior is conduct, there
is something to be said for the proposition that the 1906 Act created
a purely objective qualiﬁcation, limiting inquiry to an applicant’s
previous conduct.” If this objective standard is the requirement,
petitionersatisﬁed the statute. His conduct has been law abiding in
all respects. According to -the record he has never been arrested, or
connected with any disorder, and not a single written or spoken
statement of his, during the relevant period from 1922 to 1927 or
thereafter, advocating violent overthrow of the Government, or
indeed even a statement, apart from his testimony in this proceed-
ing, that he desired any change in the Constitution has been pro-
duced. The sole possible criticism is petitioner's membership and
activity in the League and the Party, but those memberships qua
memberships, were immaterial under the 1906 Act.

In United States V. Schwimmer, 279 U. S. 644, and United States
V. Macintosh, 283 U. S. 605, however, it was held that the statute
created a test of beIief—that an applicant under the 1906 "Act must
not only behave as a man attached to the principles of the Con-
stitution, but must be so attached in fact at the time of naturaliza-
tion. We do not stop to reexamine this construction for even if it
is accepted the result is not changed. As mentioned before, we agree
with the statement of Chief Justice Hughes in dissent in Macintosh’s
case that the behavior requirement is “a general phrase which
should be construed, not in opposition to, but in accord with, the
theory and practice of our Government in relation to freedom of
conscience.” 283 U. S. at 635. See also the dissenting opinion of
Justice Holmes in the Schwimmer case, supra, 653-55. As pointed
out before, this is a denaturalization proceeding, and it is a judg-
ment, not merely a claim or a grant, which is being attacked. As-
suming as we have that the United States is entitled to attack a
ﬁnding of attachment upon a charge of illegality, it must sustain
the heavy burden which then rests upon it to prove lack of attach-
ment by “clear, unequivocal, and convincing” evidence which does

not leave the issue in doubt. When the attachment requirement is’

construed ‘as indicated above, we do not think the Government has
carried its burden of proof.

The claim that petitioner was not in fact attached to the Con-
stitution and well disposed to the good order and happiness of the
United States at the time of his naturalization and _-for the previous
ﬁve year period is twofold: First, that he believed in such sweeping

17

 

 

changes in the Constitution that he simply could not be attached to
it; Second, that he believed in and advocated the overthrow by force
and violence of the Government, Constitution and laws of the United
States.

In support of its position that petitioner was not in fact attached
to the principles of _the Constitution because of his membership in
the League and the Party, the Government has directed our atten-
tion ﬁrst to petitioner's testimony that he subscribed to the prin-
ciples of those organizations, and then to certain alleged Party prin-
ciples and’ statements by Party Leaders which are said to be funda-
mentally at variance with the principles of the Constitution. At this
point it is appropriate to mention what willbe more fully developed
later—that under our traditions beliefs are personal and not a mat-
ter of mere association, and that men in adhering to a political party
or other organization notoriously do not subscribe unqualiﬁedly to
all of its platforms or asserted principles. Said to be among those
Communist principles in 1927 -are: the abolition of private property
without compensation; the erection of a new proletarian state upon
the ruins of the old bourgeois state; the creation of a dictatorship
of the proletariat; denial of political rights to others than mem-
bers of the Party or of the proletariat; and the creation of a world
union of soviet republics. Statements that American democracy “is
a fraud”13 and that the purposes of the Party are “utterly an-
tagonistic to the purposes for which the American democracy, so
called, was formed,” 14 are stressed.

Those principles an.d views are not generally accepted—in fact
they are distasteful to most of us—and they call for considerable
change in our present form of government and society. But we
do not think the government has carried its burden of proving by
evidence which does not leave the issue in doubt that petitioner was
not in fact -attached to the principles of the Constitution and well
disposed to the good order and happiness of the United States when
he was naturalized in 1927. .

The constitutional fathers, fresh from a revolution, did not forge
a political strait-jacket for the generations to come.15 Instead they
wrote Article V and the First Amendment, guaranteeing freedom
of thought, soon followed. Article V contains procedural provisions
for constitutionalchange by amendment without any present limita-
tion whatsoever except that no State may be deprived of equal rep-
resentation in the Senate without its consent. Cf. National Pro-
hibition Cases, 253 U. S. 350. This provision and the many import-
ant and far-reaching changes made in the Constitution since 1787

18

 

refute the idea that attachment to any particular provision or pro-
visions is essential, or that one who advocates radical changes is

_ necessarily not attached to the Constitution. United States V. Room,

12 F. 2d 942, 944-45.16 As Justice Holmes said, “Surely it cannot
show lack of attachment to the principles of the Constitution that
[one] thinks it can be improved.” United States V. Schwimmer,
supra (dissent). Criticism of, -and the sincerity of desires to im-
prove the Constitution should not be judged by conformity to pre-
vailing thought because, “if there is any principle of the Constitu-
tion that more imperatively calls for attachment than any other it is
the principle of free thought—not free thought for those who agree
with us, but freedom for the thought that we hate.” Id. See also
Chief Justice Hughes dissenting in United States V. Macintosh,

supra, p. 635. Whatever attitude we may individually hold toward -

persons and organizations that believe in or advocate extensive
changes in our existing order, it should be our desire and concern
at all times to uphold the right of free discussion and free thinking
to which we as a people claim primary attachment. To neglect this
duty in a proceeding in which we are called upon to judge whether

. a particular individual has failed to manifest attachment to the

Constitution would be ironical indeed.

Our concern is with what Congress meant to be the extent of the
area of allowable thought under the statute. By the very generality
of the terms employed it is evident that Congress intended an
elastic test, one which should not be circumscribed by attempts at
precise deﬁnition. In View of our tradition of freedom of thought,
it isnot to be presumed that,Congress in the Act of 1906, or its
predecessors of 1795 and 1802,17 intended to offer naturalization only
to those whose political views coincide with those considered best
by the founders in 1787 or by the majority in this country today.
Especially is this so since the language used, posing the general test
of “attachment” is not necessarily susceptible of so repressive a
construction.” The Government agrees that ansalien “may think that
the laws and the Constitution should be amended in some or many
respects” and still be attached to the principles of the Constitution
within the meaning of the statute. Without discussing the nature
and extent of those permissible changes, the Government insists that
an alien must believe in and sincerely adhere to the “general political
philosophy” of the Constitution.” Petitioner is said to be opposed
to that “political philosophy”, the minimum requirements of which
are set forth in the4margin.‘~’° It was argued at the bar that since
Article V contains no limitations, a person can be attached to the

19

 

Constitution no matter how extensive the changes are that he de-

sires, so long as he seeks to achieve his ends within the framework
of Article V. But we need not consider the validity of this extreme

position for if the Government’s construction is accepted, it has ,

not carried its burden of proof even under its own test.

The district court did not state in its ﬁndings what principles held
by petitioner or by the Communist Party were opposed to the Con-
stitution and indicated -lack of attachment. See Note 6, ante. In
its opinion that court merely relied upon In re Saralieﬁf, 59 F. 2nd
436, and United States V. Tapolesanyi, 40 F. 2d 255, without fresh
examination of the question in thelight of the present record. 33 F.
Supp.’510. The Circuit Court of Appeals deduced as Party principles
roughly the same ones which the Government here presses and
stated “these views are not those of our Constitution.” 119 F. 2d
at 503-04.

With regard to the Constitutional changes he desired petitioner
testiﬁed that he believed in the nationalization of the means of pro-
duction and exchange with compensation, and the preservation and

utilization of our “democratic structure . . . as far as possible for

the advantage of the working classes.” He stated that the “dictator-
ship of the proletariat” to him meant “not a government, but a
state of things” in which “the majority of the people shall really
direct their own destinies and use the instrument of the state for
these truly democratic ends.” None of this is necessarily incom-
patible with the “general political philosophy” of the Constitution
as outlined above by the Government. It is true that the Fifth
Amendment protects private property, even against taking for pub-
Iic use without compensation. But throughout our history many
sincere people whose attachment to the general constitutional scheme
cannot be doubted have, for various and even divergent reasons,
urged differing degrees of governmental ownership and control of
natural resources, basic means of production, and banks and the
media of exchange, either with or without compensation. And some-
thing once regarded as a species of private property was abolished
without compensating the owners when the institution of slavery
was forbidden.” Can it be said that the author of thehEmancipa-
tion Proclamation and thesupporters of the Thirteenth Amendment
were not attached to the Constitution? We conclude that lack of
attachment to the Constitution is not shown on the basis of the
changes which petitioner testiﬁed he desired in the Constitution.

Turning now to a seriatim consid ration of what the Government

\ asserts are principles of the Coml. unist Party, which petitioner

20

 

 

believed and which are opposed to our Constitution, our conclusion
remains the ‘same—the Government has not.proved by “clear, un-
equivocal and convincing” evidence that the naturalization court
could not have been satisﬁed that petitioner was attached to the
principles of the Constitution when he was naturalized.

We have already disposed of the principle of nationalization of
the agents of production and exchange with or without compensa-
tion. The erection of a new proletariat state upon the ruins of the
old bourgeois state, and the creation of a dictatorship of the pro-
letariat may be considered together. The concept of the dictatorship
of the proletariat is one loosely used, upon which more words than
light have been shed. Much argument has been directed as to how
it is to be achieved, but we have been offered no precise deﬁnition
here. In’ the general sense the term may be taken to describe a state
in which the workers or the masses, rather than the bourgeoisie or
capitalists are the dominant class. Theoretically it is control by a
class, not a dictatorship in the sense of absolute and total rule by
one individual. So far as the record before us indicates, the con-
cept is a ﬂuid one, capable of adjustment to different conditions in
different countries. There are only meager indications of the form
the “dictatorship” would take in this country. It does not appear
that it would necessarily mean the end of representative govern-
ment or the federal system. The Program and Constitution of the
Workers Party (1921-24) criticized the constitutional system of
checks and balances, the Senate’s power to pass on legislation, and
the involved procedure for amending the Constitution, characteriz-
ing them as devices designed to frustrate the will of the majority.”
The 1928 platform of the Communist Party of the United States,
adopted after petitioner's naturalization and hence not strictly
relevant, advocated the abolition of the Senate, of the Supreme
Court, and of the veto power of the President, and replacement of
congressional districts with “councils of workers” in which legis-
lative and executive power would be united. These would indeed be
signiﬁcant changes in our present governmental structure—-changes
which it is safe to say are not desired by the majority of the people
in this country——but whatever our personal views, as judges we
cannot say that a person who advocates their adoption through
peaceful and constitutional means is not in fact -attached to the
Constitution—those institutions are not enumerated as necessary
in the Government's test of “general political philosophy”, and it
is conceivable that “ordered liberty” could be maintained without
them. The Senate has not‘ gone free of criticism and one object of

21 '

 

the Seventeenth Amendment was 1 to make it more responsive to
the public will.23 The unicameral legislature is not unknown in the
country. 24 It is true that this Court has played a large part in the
unfolding of the constitutional plan (sometimes too much so in the
opinion of some observers), but we would be arrogant indeed if we
presumed that a government of laws, with protection for minority
groups, would be impossible without it. Like other agencies of
government, this Court at various times in its existence has not
escaped the shafts of critics whose sincerity and attachment to the
Constitution is beyond. question—critics who have accused it of as-
suming functions of judicial review not intended to be conferred
upon it, or of abusing those functions to thwart the popular will,
and who have advocated various remedies taking a wide range?“
; And it is hardly‘ conceivable that the consequence of freeing the
C legislative branch from the restraint of the executive veto would
be the end of constitutional government.24'° By this discussion we
certainly do not mean to indicate that we would favor such changes.
Uur preference and aversions have no bearing here. Our concern
,5, is with the extent of the allowable area of thought under the statute.
 . We decide only that it is possible to advocate such changes and still
i I be attached to the Constitution within the meaning of the Govern-
ment’s minimum test.
r If any provisions of the Constitution can be singled out as re-
ii quiring unqualiﬁed attachment, they are the guaranties of the Bill
 of Rights and especially that of freedom of thought contained in
ll the First Amendment. Cf. Justice Holmes’ dissent in United States
,l V. Schwimmer, supra. We do not reach, however the question -3,
whether petitioner was attached to the principles of the Constitu-
tion if he believed in denying political and civil rights to persons
not members of the Party or of the so-called proletariat, for on the
basis of the record before us it has not been clearly shown that such
% denial was a principle of the organizations to which petitioner be-
,1. longed. Since it is doubtful -that this was a principle of those
 organizations, it is certainly much more speculative whether this
was part of petitioner’s philosophy. Some of the documents in the
record indicate that “class enemies” of the proletariat should be de-
prived of their political rights.25 Lenin, however, wrote that this
was not necessary to realize ame dictatorship of the proletariat.” ‘C
The party’s 1928 platform demanded the unrestricted right to
organize, to strike and to picket and the unrestricted right of free
speech, free press and free assemblage for the working class. The
1928 Program of the Communist International states that the pro-
’ 22

 

 

letarian State will grant religious freedom, while at the same time
it will carry on anti-religious propaganda.

We should not hold that petitioner is not attached to the Con-
stitution by reason of his possible belief in the creation of some
form of world union of soviet republics unless we are willing so to
hold with regard to those who believe in Pan-Americanism, the
League of Nations, Union Now, or some other form of international
collaboration or collective security Which may grow out of the
present holocaust. A distinction here would be an invidious one
based on the fact that we might agree with or tolerate the latter
but dislike or disagree with the former.

If room is allowed, as we think Congress intended, for the free

play of ideas, none of the foregoing principles, which might be‘

held to stand forth with suﬂicient clarity to be imputed to peti-
tioner on the basis of his membership and activity in the League
and the Party and his testimony that he subscribed to the principles
of those organizations, is enough, whatever our opinion as to their
merits, to prove that he was necessarily not attached to the Con-
stitution when he was naturalized. The cumulative effect is no

greater. .
Apart from the question whether the alleged principles of the

Partywhich petitioner assertedly believed were so fundamentally »

opposed to the Constitution that he was not attached to its prin-
ciples in 1927, the Government contends that petitioner was not
attached because he believed in the use of force and violence in-
stead of peaceful democratic methods to achieve his. desires. In
support of this phase of its argument the Government asserts that
the organizations with which petitioner was actively affiliated ad-
vised, advocated and taught the overthrow of the Government, Con-
stitution and laws of the United States by force and violence, and

' that petitioner therefore believed in that method of governmental

change.

Apart from his membership in the League and the Party, the
record is barren of any conduct or statement on petitioner’s part
which indicates in the slightest that he believed in and advocated
the employment of force and violence, instead of peaceful persua-
sion, as a means of attaining political ends. To ﬁnd that he so be-
lieved and advocated it is necessary, therefore, to ﬁnd that such
was a principle of the organizations to which he belonged and then

impute that principle to him on the basis of his activity in those .

organizations and his statement that he subscribed to their prin-
ciples. The Government frankly concedes that “it is normally true
23

 

 

. . . that it is unsound to impute to an organization the views ex-
pressed in the writings of all its members, or to impute such writings
to each member . . .”37 But the Government contends, however, that

it is proper to impute to petitioner certain excerpts from the docu-

ments in evidence upon which it particularly relies to show that
advocacy of force and violence was a principle of the Communist
Party of the United States in 1927, because those documents were
ofﬁcial publications carefully supervised by the Party, because of
the Party’s notorious discipline over its members, and because peti-
tioner was not a mere “rank and ﬁle or accidental member of the
Party”, but “an intelligent and educated individual” who “became
a leader of these organizations as an intellectual revolutionary.”23
Since the immediate problem is the determination with certainty of

, petitioner’s beliefs from 1922 to 1927, events and writings since

that time have little relevance, and both parties have attempted to
conﬁne themselves within the limits of that critical period.

For some time the question whether advocacy of governmental
overthrow by force and violence is a principle of the Communist
Party of the United States has perplexed courts, administrators,
legislatures, and students. On varying records in deportation pro-

L ceedings some courts have held that administrative ﬁndings that the

Party did so advocate were not so wanting in evidential support as
to amount to a denial of due process.,29 others have held to the
contrary on different records,” and some seem to have taken the
position that they will judicially notice that force and violence is a
Party principles“ This Court has never passed upon the question
whether the Party does so advocate, and it is unnecessary for us to
do so now.

With commendable candor the Government -admits the presence
of sharply conﬂicting views on the issue of force and violence as a
Party principle,” and it also concedes that “some communist litera-
ture in respect of force and violence is susceptible of an interpreta-
tion more rhetorical than literal”.33 It insists, however, that excerpts
from the documents on which it particularly relies, are enough to
show that the trial court’s ﬁnding that the Communist Party “ad-
vocated violent overthrow of the Government was not “clearly
erroneous”, and hence can not be set aside.“ As previously pointed
out, the trial court’s ﬁndings do not indicate the bases for its con-
clusions, but the documents published prior to 1927 stressed by the
Government, with the pertinent excerpts noted in the margin, are:
The Communist Manifesto of Marx and Engels;35 The State and
Revolution by Lenin;3“ The Statutes, Theses and Conditions of Ad-

24

 

mission to the Communist International;37 and The Theory and
Practice of Leninism, written by Stalin.“ The Government also sets
forth excerpts from other documents which are entitled to little
weight because they were published after the critical period.”

The bombastic excerpts set forth in Notes 35 and 38 inclusive,
upon which the Government particularly relies, lend considerable
support to the charge. We do not say that a reasonable man could
not possibly have found, as the district court did, that the Com-
munist Party in 1927 actively urged the overthrow of the Govern-
ment by force and violence.4° But that is not the issue here. We
are not concerned with the question whether a reasonable man might
so conclude, nor with the narrow issue whether administrative ﬁnd-
ings to that effect are so lacking in evidentiary support as to amount
to a denial of due process. As pointed out before, this is a de-
naturalization proceeding. in which, if the Government is entitled
to attack a ﬁnding of attachment as we have assumed, the burden
rests upon. it to prove the alleged lack of attachment by “clear,
unequivocal and convincing” evidence. That burden has not been
carried. The Government has not proved that petitioner’s beliefs
on the subject of force and violence were such that he was not
attached to the Constitution in 1927.

In the ﬁrst place this phase of the Government’s case is subject
to the admitted inﬁrmities of proof by imputation.“ The diﬂiculties
of this method of proof are here increased by the fact that there is,
unfortunately, no absolutely accurate test of What a political party's
principles are.” Political writings are often over-exaggerated po-
lemics bearing the imprint of the period and the place in which
written.43 Philosophies cannot generally be studied in vacuo. Mean-
ing -may be wholly distorted by lifting sentences out of context, in-
stead of construing them as part of an organic whole. Every utter-
ance of party leaders is not taken as party gospel. And we would
deny our experience as men if we did not recognize that official party
programs are unfortunately often opportunistic devices as much
honored in the breach as in the observance.“ On the basis of the
present record we cannot say that the Communist Party is so dif-
ferent in this respect that its principles stand forth with perfect
clarity, and especially is this so with relation to the crucial issue
of advocacy of force and violence, upon which the Government ad-
mits the evidence is sharply conﬂicting. The presence of this con-
ﬁict is the second weakness in the Government’s chain of proof. It
is not eliminated by assiduously adding further excerpts from the
documents in evidence to those called out by the Government.

25

   

The reality of the conﬂict in the record before us can be pointed
out quickly. Of the relevant prior to 1927 documents relied upon
by the Government three are writings of outstanding Marxist phi-
losophers, and leaders, the fourth is a world program.“ The Man-
ifesto of 1848 was proclaimed in an autocratic Europe engaged in
suppressing the abortive liberal revolutions of that year. With this
background, its tone is not surprising.“ Its authors later stated,
however, that there were certain countries, “such as the United
States and England in which the workers may hope to secure their
ends by peaceful mea.ns.”47 Lenin doubted this in his militant work,
The State and Revolution, but this was written on the eve of the
Bolshevist revolution in Russia and may be interpreted as intended
in part to justify the Bolshevist course and refute the anarchists
and social democrats.“ Stalin declared that Marx’s exemption for
the United States and England w-as no longer valid.49 He wrote,
however, that “the proposition that the prestige of the Party can
be built upon violence . . . is absurd and absolutely incompatible with
Leninism.”5° And Lenin wrote “In order to obtain the power of
the state the class conscious workers must win the majority to their
side. As long as no violence is used against the masses, there is no
other road to power. We are not Blanquists, we are not in favor of
the seizure of power by a minority.” 51 The .1938 Constitution of the
Communist Party of the United States, which petitioner claimed to
be the ﬁrst and only written constitution ever oﬂicially adopted by
the Party and which he asserted enunciated the principles of the
Party as he understood them from the beginning of his membership,
ostensibly eschews resort to force and violence as an element of
Party tactics.” -

A tenable conclusion from the foregoing is that the Party in
1927 desired to achieve its purpose by peaceful and democratic
means, and as a theoretical matter justiﬁed the use of force and
violence only as a method of preventing an attempted forcible
counter-overthrow once the Party had obtained control in a peace-
ful manner, or as a method of last resort to enforce the majority
will if at some indeﬁnite future time because of peculiar circum-
stances constitutional or peaceful channels were no longer open.

There is a material difference between agitation and exhortation
calling for present violent action which create-s a clear and present
danger of public disorder or other substantive evil, and mere doc-
trinal justiﬁcation -or prediction of the use of force under hypo-
thetical conditions at some indeﬁnite future time——prediction that
is not calculated or intended to be presently acted upon, thus leav-

ing opportunity for general discussion and the calm processes of
thought and reason. Cf. Bridges V. California, 314 U. S. 252, and
Justice Brandeis’ concurring opinion in Whitney V. California, 274
U. S. 357, 372-80. See also Taylor V. Mississippi, — U. S. —, Nos.
826-828 this term. Because of this difference we may assume that
Congress intended, by the general test of “attachment” in the 1906
Act, to deny naturalization to persons falling into the_ ﬁrst category
but not to those in the second. Such a construction of the statute is
to be favored because it preserves for novitiates as well as citizens
the full beneﬁt of that freedom of thought which is a fundamental
feature of our political institutions. Under the conﬂicting evidence
in this case we cannot say that the Government has proved by such
a preponderance of the evidence that the issue is not in doubt, that
the attitude of the Communist Party of the United States in 1927
towards force and violence was not susceptible of classiﬁcation

in the second-category. Petitioner testiﬁed that he subscribed to

this interpretation of Party principles when he was naturalized,
and nothing in his conduct is inconsistent with that testimony.
We conclude that the Government has not carried its burden of
proving by “clear, unequivocal, and convincing” evidence which
does not leave “the issue in doubt,” that petitioner obtained his
citizenship illegally. In so holding we do not decide what interpreta-
tion of the Party’s attitudetoward force and violence is the most
probable on the basis of the present record,’ or that petitioner’s
testimony is acceptable -at face value. We hold only that where two
interpretations, of an organization’s’program are possible, the one
reprehensible and a bar to naturalization and the other permissible,
a court in a denaturaliz-ation proceeding, assuming that it can re-
examine a ﬁnding of attachment upon a charge of illegal procure-
ment, is not justiﬁed in canceling a certiﬁcate of citizenship by
imputing the reprehensible interpretation to a member of the or-

ganization in the absence of overt acts indicating that such was his _

interpretation. So uncertain a chain of proof does not add up to the
requisite “clear, unequivocal, and convincing” evidence for setting
aside a naturalization decree. Were the law otherwise, valuable
rights would rest upon a slender reed, and the security of the status
of our naturalized citizens might depend in considerable degree upon
the political temper of majority thought and the stresses of the
times. Those are consequences foreign to the best traditions of this
nation, and the characteristics of our institutions.

COURT OPINION

CAROL KING ’

Arnerican Committee for Protection of Foreign Born

II

This disposes of the issues framed by the Government's com-
plaint which are here pressed. As additional reasons for its conclu-
sion ‘that petitioner's naturalization was fraudulently and illegally
procured the district court found, however, that petitioner was a
disbeliever in, and a member of an organization teaching disbelief
in organized government,” and “that his oath of allegiance, re-
quired by 8 U. S. C. §381, was false. These issues are outside the
scope of the complaint,“ as is another ground urged in support
of the judgment below as to which the district court made no ﬁnd-
ings.“ Because they are outside the scope of the complaint, we do
not consider them. As we said in De Jonge V. Oregon, “Conviction
upon a charge not made would be sheer denial of due process.” 299
U. S. 353, 362. A denaturalization suit is not a criminal proceeding.
But neither is it an ordinary civil action since it involves an im-
portant adjudication of status. Consequently we think the Govern-
ment should be limited, as in a criminal proceeding, to the matters
charged in its complaint.

One other ground advanced in support of the judgment below _

was not considered by the lower courts and does not merit detailed
treatment. It is that petitioner was not entitled to naturalization
because he was deportable in 1927 under the Immigration Act of
1918 (40 Stat. 1012, as amended by 41 Stat. 1008; 8 U. S. C. § 137)
as an alien member of an organization advocating overthrow of the
Government of the United States by force and violence. This issue
is answered by our prior discussion of the evidence in this record
relating to force and violence. Assuming that deportability at the
time of naturalization satisﬁes the requirement of illegality under
§15 which governs this proceeding,‘ the sameifailure to establish
adequately the attitude toward force and violence of the organiza-
tions to which petitioner belonged forbids his denaturalization on
the ground of membership.

The judgement is reversed and the cause remanded to the Circuit
Court of Appeals for further proceedings in conformity with this
opinion.

It is so ordered.

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

No. 2——OCTOBER TERM, 1942.

William Schneiderman, Petitioner, On Writ of Certiorari to the
United States Circuit Court
of Appeals for the Ninth

The United States of America. Circuit. '

'08.

[June 21, 1943.]
I . .l I

Mr. Justice DOUGLAS, concurring.

I join in the Court's opinion and agree that petitioner’s want
of attachment in 1927 to the principles of the Constitution has not
been shown by “clear, unequivocal and convincing” evidence. The
United States, when it seeks to deprive a. person of his American
citizenship, carries a heavy burden of showing that he procured it
unlawfully. That burden has not been sustained on the present
record, as the opinion of the Court makes plain, unless the most
extreme views within petitioner’s party -are to be imputed or
attributed to him and unless all doubts which may exist concerning
his beliefs in 1927 are to be resolved against him rather than in his
favor. But there is another view of the problem raised by this type
of case which is so basic as to merit separate statement.

Sec. 15 of the Naturalization Act gives the United States the
power and duty to institute actions to set aside and cancel certiﬁ-
cates of citizenship on the ground of “fraud” or on the ground that
they were “illegally procured”. Sec. 15 “makes nothing fraudulent
or unlawful that was honest and lawful whenit was done. It imposes
no new penalty upon the wrongdoer. But if, after fair hearing, it is
judicially determined that by wrongful conduct he has obtained a
title to citizenship, the act provides that he shall be deprived of a
privilege that was never rightfully his.” Johannessen V. United
States," 225 U. S. 227, 242-243. And see Luria V. United States,
231 U. S. 9, 24. “Wrongful conduct”—like the statutory words
“fraud’_’ or “illegally procure "—are strong words. Fraud connotes
perjury, concealment, falsiﬁcation, misrepresentation or the like.
But a certiﬁcate is illegally, as distinguished from fraudulently,
procured when it is obtained without compliance with a “condition

29

 

precedent to the authority of the Court to grant a petition for
naturalization.” Maney v. United States, 278  S. 17, 22.

Under the Act in question, as under earlier and later Acts}
Congress prescribed numerous conditions precedent to the issuance
of a certiﬁcate. They included the requirement that the applicant
not be an anarchist or polygamist (§ 7),‘ the presentation of a
certiﬁcate of arrival (United States V. Ness, 245 U. S. 319), the
requirement that the ﬁnal hearing be had in open court (United
States V. Ginsberg, 243 U. S. 472), the residence requirement
(R. -S. §2170), the general requirement that the applicant be able
to speak the English language (§ 8), etc. The foregoing are illustra-
tive of one type of condition which Congress speciﬁed. Another
type is illustrated by the required ﬁnding of attachment. "Sec. 4,
as it then read, stated that it “shall be made to appear to the
satisfaction of the court” that the applicant “has behaved as a man
of good moral character, attached to the principles of the Constitu-
tion of the United States, and well d_isposed to the good order and
happiness of the same.”2 It is my view that Congress by that
provision made the ﬁnding the condition precedent, not the weight
of the evidence underlying the ﬁnding. Such a ﬁnding can of course
be set aside under § 15 on grounds of fraud. But so far as certiﬁ-
cates “illegally procured” are concerned, this Court has heretofore
permitted §15 to be used merely to enforce the express conditions
speciﬁed in the Act. It is of course true that an applicant for citi-
zenship was required to come forward and make the showing neces-
sary for the -required ﬁndings. §4. But under this earlier Act, it
was not that showing but the ﬁnding‘ of the court which Congress
expressed in the form of a condition. If §15 should be broadened
by judicial construction to permit the ﬁndings of attachment to be
set aside for reasons other than fraud, then the issue of illegality
would be made to turn not on the judge being satisﬁed as to appli-
cant’s attachment but on the evidence underlying that ﬁnding.
Such a condition should not‘ be readily implied.

If an anarchist is naturalized, the United States may bring an
action under §15 to set aside the certiﬁcate on the grounds of
illegality. Since Congress by §7 of the Act forbids the naturaliza-
tion of anarchists, the alien anarchist who obtains the certiﬁcate
has procured it illegally whatever the naturalization court might
ﬁnd. The same would be true of communists if Congress declared
they should be ineligible for citizenship. Then proof that one was
not a communist and did not adhere to that party or its belief would
become like the other express conditions in the Act a so-called

30

 

 

 

“jurisdictional” fact “upon which the grant is predicated.”
Johannessen V. United States, supra, p. 240. But under this Act
Congress did not treat communists like anarchists. Neither the
statute nor the official forms used by applicants called for an expres-
sion by petitioner of his attitude on, or his relationship to, com-

. munism, or any other foreign political creed except anarchy and

the like.
The ﬁndings of attachment are entrusted to the naturalization
court with only the most general standard to guide it. That court

‘has before it, however, not only the applicant but at least two wit-

nesses. It makes its appraisal of the applicant and it weighs the
evidence. Its conclusion must often rest on imponderable factors.
In the present case we do not know how far the naturalization
court probed into petitioner's political beliefs and affiliations. We do
not know what inquiry it made. All we do know is that it was
satisﬁed that petitioner was “attached to the principles of the
Constitution of the United States.” But we must assume that that
ﬁnding which underlies the judgment granting citizenship (Cf.
Tutun V. United States, 270 U. S. 568) was supported by evidence.
We must assume that the evidence embraced all relevant facts since
no charge of concealment or misrepresentation is now made by
respondent. And we must assume that the applicant and the judge
both acted in utmost good faith.

If the applicant answers all questions required of him, if there
is no concealment or misrepresentation, the ﬁndings of attachment
cannot be set aside’ on the grounds of illegality in proceedings

— under §15. It does not comport with any accepted notion of

illegality to say that in spite of the utmost good faith on the part of

applicant and judge and in spite of full compliance with the express ..

statutory conditions a certiﬁcate was illegally procured because
another judge would appraise the evidence differently. That would
mean that the United States at any time could obtain a trial de novo
on the political faith of the applicant.

It is hardly conceivable that Congress intended that result under
this earlier Act except for the narrow group of political creeds such
as anarchy for which it specially provided. Chief Justice Hughes
stated in his dissent in United States V. Macintosh-, 283 U. S. 605,
635, that the phrase “attachment to the principles of the Constitu-
tion” is a general one “which should be construed, not in opposition
to, but in accord with, the theory and practice of our Government
in relation to freedom of conscience.” We should be mindful of that
criterion in our construction of § 15. If ﬁndings of attachment which

31

 

w
2
k
I
i

underlie certiﬁcates may be set aside years later on the evidence,
then the citizenship of those whose political faiths become unpopular
with the passage of time becomes vulnerable. It is one thing to
agree that Congress could take that step if it chose. See Turner v.
Williams, 194 U. S. 279. But where it has not done so in plain words,
we should be loathe to imply that Congress sanctioned a procedure

which in absence of fraud permitted a man's citizenship to be '

attacked years after the grant because of his political beliefs,
social philosophy, or economic theories. We should not tread so
close to" the domain of freedom of conscience without an explicit

-mandate from those who specify the conditions on which citizenship"

is granted to or withheld from aliens. At least when two interpre-
tations of the Naturalization Act are possible we should choose the
one which is the more hospitable to that ideal for which American
citizenship itself stands.

Citizenship can be granted only on the basis of the statutory
right which Congress has created. Tutun V. United ‘States, supra.
But where it is granted and where all the express statutory condi-
tions precedent are satisﬁed we should adhere to the view that
the judgment of naturalization is ﬁnal and conclusive except for
fraud. Since the United States does not now contend that fraud
vitiates this certiﬁcate the judgment below must be reversed.

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

No. 2-—OCTOBER. TERM, 1942.

William Schneiderman, Petitioner, On Writ of Certiorari to the

United States Circuit Court-

' of Appeals for the Ninth
The United States of America. Circuit.

‘D8.

[June 21, 1943.]
Mr. Justice RUTLEDGE, concurring.

I join in the Court's opinion. I add what follows only to em-
phasize what I think is at the bottom of this case.

Immediately we are concerned with only one man, William
Schneiderman. Actually, though indirectly, the decision affects mil-
lions. If, seventeen years after a federal court adjudged him
entitled to, be a citizen, that judgment can be nulliﬁed and he can
be stripped of this most precious right, by nothing more than
reexamination upon the merits of the very facts the judgment
established, no naturalized person’s citizenship is or can be secure.
If this can be done after that lengthof time, it can be done after
thirty or ﬁfty years. If -it can be done for Schneiderman, it can
be done for thousands or tens of thousands of others.

For all that would be needed would be to produce some evidence
from which any one of the federal district judges could draw a
conclusion, concerning one of the ultimate facts in issue, opposite
from that drawn by the judge decreeing admission. The statute does
not in terms prescribe “jurisdictional” facts} But all of the import-
ant ones are “jurisdictional,” or have that effect, if by merely draw-
ing contrary conclusion from the same, though conﬂicting, evidence
at any later time a court can overturn the judgment. An applicant
might be admitted today upon evidence satisfying the court he had
complied with all requirements. That judgment might be affirmed
on-appeal and again on certiorari here. Yet the day after, or ten
years later, any district judge could overthrow it,von the same evi-
dence, if it was conﬂicting or gave room for contrary inferences,
or on different evidence all of which might have been presented to
the ﬁrst court.”

If this is the law and the right the naturalized citizen acquires,
his admission creates nothing more than citizenship inattenuated,
if not suspended, animation. He acquires but prima facie status,
if that. Until the Government moves to‘ cancel his certiﬁcate and
he knows the outcome, he cannot know whether he is in or out.
And when that is done, nothing forbids repeating the harrowing
process again and again, unless the weariness of the courts should
lead them ﬁnally to speak res‘judz'ca.ta.. .

No citizen with such a threat hanging over his head could be
free. If he belonged to “off-color” organizations or held too radical
or, perhaps, too reactionary views, for some segment of the judicial
palate, when his admission took place, he could not open his mouth
without fear his words would be held against him. For whatever
he might say or whatever any such organization might advocate
could be hauled forth at any time to show “continuity” of belief
from the day of his admission, or “concealment” at that time. Such
a citizen would not be admitted to liberty. His best course would
be silence or hypocrisy. This is not citizenship. Nor is it adjudica-
tion.

It may be doubted that the framers of the Constitution intended
to create two classes of citizens, one free and independent, one
haltered with a lifetime string tied to its status. However that may
be, and conceding that the power to revoke exists and rightly should
exist to some extent, the question remains whether the power to
admit can be delegated to the courts in such a way that their de-
termination, once made, determines and concludes nothing with
ﬁnality. —

If every fact in issue, going to the right to be a citizen, can be
reexamined, upon the same or different proof, years or decades
later; and if this can be done de novo, as if no judgment had been
entered, whether with respect to the burden of proof required to
reach a different decision or otherwise, what does the judgment
determine? What does it settle with ﬁnality? If review is had and
the admission is afﬁrmed, what fact is adjudicated, if next day any
or all involved can be redecided to the contrary? Can Congress, when
it has empowered a court to determine and others to review and
conﬁrm, at the same time or later authorize any trial court to over-
turn their decrees, for causes other than such as have been held sulﬁ-
cient to overturn other decrees ?3 i

I do not undertake now to decide these questions. Nor does the
Court. But they have a bearing on the one which is decided. It
is a judgment which is being attacked. Tutun V. United States, 270

U. S. 568. Accordingly, it will not do to say the issue is identical
 with What is presented in a naturalization proceeding, is merely
‘ : one of fact, upon which therefore the ﬁnding of the trial court con-
cludes, and consequently we have no business to speak or our
 speaking is appellate intermeddling. That ignores the vital fact
*~‘ that it is a judgment, rendered in the exercise of the judicial power
created by Article III which it is sought to overthrow,4 not merely a
grant like a patent to land or for invention.5 Congress has plenary
power over naturalization. That no one disputes. Nor that this
power, for its application, can be delegated to the courts. But this
is not to say, when Congress has so placed it, that body can decree
in the same breath that the judgment rendered shall have no con-
clusive effect. Limits it may place. But that is another matter from
making an adjudication under Article III merely an advisory opinion
orprima facie evidence of the fact or all the facts determined.
Congress has, with limited exceptions, plenary power over the juris-
diction of the federal courts.“ But to confer the jurisdiction and
at the same time nullify entirely the effects of its exercise are not
matters heretofore thought, when squarely faced, within its au-
thority.7 To say therefore that the trial court’s function in this case
is the same as was that of the admitting court is to ignore the vast
difference between overturning a judgment, with its adjudicated
facts, and deciding initially upon facts which have not been ad-
judged. The argument made from the deportation statutes likewise
ignores this difference.

It is no answer to say that Congress provided for the redetermi-
nation as a part of the statute conferring the right to admission
and therefore as a condition of it. For that too ignores the question
whether Congress can so condition the judgment and is but another
way of saying that a determination, made by an exercise of judicial‘
power under Article III, can be conditioned by legislative mandate
so as not to determine ﬁnally any ultimate fact in issue.

The effect of cancellation is to nullify the judgment of admission.
If it is a judgment, and no one disputes that it is, that quality in
itself requires the burden of proof the court has held that Congress
intended in order to overturn it. That it is a judgment, and one
of at least a coordinate court, which the cancellation proceeding
attacks and seeks to overthrow, requires this much at least, that
solemn decrees may not be lightly overturned and that citizens may
not be deprived of their status merely because one judge views their
political and other beliefs with a more critical eye or a different
slant, however honestly and sincerely, than another. Beyond this we

NOTES

Mr. Justice MURPHY.

1 At the time this proceeding was started this section read in part as
follows: .

“It_shall_be the duty of the United States district attorneys for the re-
spective districts, or the Commissioner or Deputy -Commissioner of
Naturalization, upon aﬂidavit showing good cause therefor, to institute
proceedings in any court having jurisdiction to naturalize aliens. in the
judicial district in which the naturalized citizen may reside at the time
of bringing suit, for the purpose of setting aside and canceling the
certiﬁcate of citizenship on the ground of fraud or on the ground that
such certiﬁcate of citizenship was illegally procured . . . . ” 8 U. S. C.

This provision is continued in substance by § 338 of the Nationality
Act of 1940, 54 Stat. 1137, 1158, 8 U. S. IC. § 738.
2 Section 4 of the Act of 1906 provided:

_“Fourth. It shall be made to appear to the satisfaction of the court ad-
mitting any alien to citizenship that immediately preceding the date of
his application he has resided continuously within the United States ﬁve
years at least, and within the State or Territory where such court is at
the time held one year at least, and that during that time he has behaved
as a man of good moral character, attached to the principles of the Con-
stitution of the United States, and well disposed to the good order and
happiness of the same. .In addition to the oath of the applicant, the

‘ testimony of at least two witnesses, citizens of the United States, as to

the facts of residence, moral character, and attachment to the principles
of the Constitution shall be required, and the name, place of residence.
and occupation of each witness shall be set forth in the record.” 34
Stat. 598; 8 U. S. C. § 382.

3 Since 1790 Congress has conferred the function of admitting aliens to
citizenship exclusively upon the courts. In exercising their authority
under this mandate the federal courts are exercising the judicial power
of the United States, conferred upon them by Article III of the Con-
stitution. Tutun 1). United States, 270 U. -S. 568. For this reason it has
been suggested that a decree of naturalization, even though the United
States does not appear, cannot be compared (as was done in J ohannessen
v. United States, 225 U. S. 227, 2.38) to an administrative grant of land
or of letters patent for invention, and that the permissible area of re-
examination is different in the two situations.

4 The record contains nothing to indicate that the same is not true for
the period after 1927.

5 For a discussion of the adequacy of somewhat similar testimony by
Hynes see Ex parte Fierstein, 41 F‘. 2d 53.

6 IV. “The Court ﬁnds that it is true that said decree and certiﬁcate of
naturalization were illegally -procured and obtained in this: That re-
spondent [petitioner] was not, at the time of his naturalization by said

. Court, and during the period of ﬁve years immediately preceding, the

filing of his petition for naturalization had not behaved as, a person
attached to the principles of the Constitution of the United States and
well disposed to the good order and happiness of the same.

“The Court ﬁnds that it is not true that at the time of the ﬁling of his
petition for naturalization respondent was not a disbeliever in or op-
posed to organized government or a member of or aﬂiliated with any
organization or body of persons teaching disbelief in or opposed to
organized government. 37

“The Court ﬁnds that in truth and in fact during all of said times re-
spondent had not behaved as a man attached to the principles of the Con-
stitution of the United States and well disposed to the good order and
happiness of the same, but was a member of and aiﬁliated with and
believed in and supported the principles of certain organizations known
as the Workers Party of America, the Workers (Communist) Party of
America, the Communist Party of the United States of America, the
Young Workers League of America, the Young Workers (Communist)
League of America and the Young Communist League of America, which
organizations were, and each of them was, at all times herein mentioned,
a section of the Third International, the principles of all of which said
organizations were opposed to the principles of the Constitution of the
United States, and advised, advocated, and taught the overthrow of the
Government, Constitution and laws of the United States by force and
violence and taught disbelief in and opposition to organized government.

V. “The Court further ﬁnds that during all of said times the re-
spondent has been and now is -a member of said organizations and has
continued to believe in, advocate and support the said principles of said
organizations.”

VI. (The substance of this ﬁnding. is that petitioner fraudulently con-
cealed his Communist aﬂiliation from the naturalization court. It is not
set forth because it is not an issue here.) (See Note 7, infra).

VII. “The court further ﬁnds that it is true that said‘ decree and
certiﬁcate of naturalization were illegally and fraudulently procured
and obtained in this: That before respondent [petitioner] was admitted
to citizenship as aforesaid, he declared on oath in open court that he
would support the Constitution of the United States, and that he ab-
solutely and entirely renounced and abjured all allegiance and ﬁdelity
to any foreign prince, potentate, state, or sovereignty, and that he would
support and defend the Constitution and laws of the United States
against all enemies, foreign and domestic, and bear true faith and al-
legiance to the same, whereas in truth and in fact, at the time of making
such declarations on oath in open court, respondent [petitioner] did not
intend to support the Constitution of the United States, and did not in-
tend absolutely and entirely to renounce and abjure all allegiance and
ﬁdelity to any foreign prince, potentate, state, or sovereignty, and did
not intend to support and defend the Constitution and laws of the United
States against all enemies, foreign and domestic, and/or to bear true
faith and allegiance to the same, but respondent at said time intended
to and did maintain allegiance and ﬁdelity to the Union of Soviet So-
cialist Republics and to the said Third International, and intended to ad-
here to and support and defend and advocate the principles and teach-
ings of said Third International, which principles and teachings were
opposed to the principles of the Constitution of the United States and
advised, advocated and taught the overthrow of the Government, Con-
stitution and laws of the United States by force and violence.”

. 7 ‘That court said it was unnecessary to consider the charge of fraudu-
lent procurement by concealment of petitioner’s Communist aﬂiliation.

‘The Government has not pressed this charge here, and we do not con-

sider it.

8 The Nationality) Act of 1940, while enlarging the category of beliefs
disqualifying persons themaafter applying for citizenship, does not in
terms make communist beliefs or aﬂiliation grounds for refusal of
naturalization. § 305, 54 Stat. 1137, 1141; 8 U. S. C. § 705.

Bills to write a deﬁnition of “communist” into the Immigration and
Deportation Act of 1918 as amended (40 Stat. 1012, 41 Stat. 1008) and
to provide for the deportation of “communists” failed to pass Congress
in 1932 and again in 1935. See H. R. 12044, H. Rep. No. 1353, S. Rep.
No. 808, 75 Cong. Rec. 12097-108, 72d Conga, 1st Sess. See also H. R.

12 The legislative history of the phrase gives some support to this view.
The behavior requirement ﬁrst appeared in the Naturalization Act of
1795, 1 Stat. 414, which was designed to tighten the Act of 1790, 1 Stat.
103. The discursive ‘debates on the 1795 Act cast little light upon the
meaning of “behaved”, but indicate that the purpose of the requirement
was to provide a probationary period during which aliens could learn
of our Constitutional plan. Some members were disturbed by the politi-
cal ferment of the age and spoke accordingly, while others regarded the
United States as an asylum for the oppressed and mistrusted efforts to
probe minds for beliefs. It is perhaps signiﬁcant that the oath, which
was adopted over the protest of Madison, the sponsor of the bill, did not
require the applicant to swear that he was attached to the Constitution,
but only that he would support it. See 4 Annals of -Congress, pp. 1004-
09, 1021-23, 1026-27, 1030-5-8, 1062, 1064-66. See also Franklin, Legisla-
tive History of Naturalization in the United States (1906), Chapter IV.

The behavior requirement was reenacted in 11802 (2 Stat. 153) at the
recommendation of Jefferson for the repeal of the stringent Act of 1798,
1 Stat. 566. See Franklin, op. cz't., Chapter V.I. It continued unchanged
until the Act of 1906 which for the ﬁrst time imported the test of present
belief into the naturalization laws when it provided in § 7 that disbe-
lievers in organized government and polygamists could not become
citizens. The continuation of the behavior test for attachment is some
indication that a less searching examination was intended in this ﬁeld-
that conduct and not belief (other than anarchist or polygamist) was the
criterion. The Nationality Act of 1940 changed the behavior requirement
to a provision that no person could be naturalized unless he “has been
and still is a person of good moral character, attached to the principles
of the Constitution of the United States and well disposed to the good
order and happiness of the United States”, 54 ‘Stat. 1142, 8 U. S. C.
§ 707. The Report of the President’s Committee to Revise the Nationality
Laws (1939) indicates this change in language was not regarded as a
change in substance, p. 23. The Congressional committee reports are
silent on the question. The sponsors of the Act in the House, however,
declared generally an intent to tighten and restrict the naturalization
laws. See 86 Cong. Rec. 11939, 11942, 11947, 11949. The chairman of
the sub-committee who had charge of the bill stated that “substantive
changes are necessary in connection with certain rights, with a view
to preventing persons who have no real attachment to the United States
from enjoying the high privilege of American nationality.” 86 Cong.
Rec. 1194‘8. This remark suggests that the change from “behaved as a
man attached” to “has been and still is a person attached”, was a change
in meaning.

15 Writing in 1816 Jefferson said: “Some men look at constitutions
with sanctimonious reverence and deem them like the ark of the covenant,
too sacred to be touched. They ascribe to the men of the preceding age
a wisdom more than human, and suppose what they did to be beyond
amendment. I knew that age Well; I belonged to it, and labored with it.
It deserved well of its country. It was very like the present, but without
the experience of the present; and forty years of experience in govern-
ment is worth a century of bookreading; and this they would say them-
selves, were they to rise from the dead. I am certainly not an advocate
for frequent and untried changes in laws and constitutions. I think
moderate imperfections had better be borne with; because, when once
known, we accommodate ourselves to them, and ﬁnd practical means of
correcting their ill effects. But I know also, that laws and institutions
must go hand and hand with the progress of the human mind. If that

becomes more developed, more enlightened, if any discoveries are made,
any truths disclosed, and manners and opinions change with the change
of circumstances, institutions must advance also, and keep pace with the
times. We might as well require a man to wear still the coat which
ﬁtted him when a boy, as, civilized society to remain as under the regimen
of their barbarous.ancestors.” Ford, Jeﬁ‘erson’s Writings, vol. X, p. 42.

Compare his First Inaugural Address: “And let us reﬂect that, having
banished from our land that religious intolerance under which mankind
so long bled and suffered, we have yet gained little if we countenance a
political intolerance as despotic, as wicked, and capable of as bitter and
bloody persecutions. During the throes and convulsions of the ancient
world, during the ‘agonizing spasms of infuriated man, seeking through
blood and slaughter his long-‘lost liberty, it was not wonderful that the
agitation of the billows should reach even this distant and peaceful shore;
that this should be more felt and feared by some and less by others, and
should divide opinions as to measures of safety. But every difference of
opinion is not a difference of principle. We have called by different
names brethren of the same principle. We are all Republicans, we are
all Federalists. If there be any among us who would wish to dissolve
this Union or to change its republican form, let them stand undisturbed
as monuments of the safety with which error of opinion may be tolerated
where reason is left free to combat it. I know, indeed, that some honest
men fear that a republican government cannot be strong, that this Gov-
ernment is not strong enough; but would the honest patriot, in the full
tide of successful experiment, abandon a government which has so far
kept us free and ﬁrm on the theoretic and visionary fear that this Gov-
ernment, the World’s best hope, may by possibility want energy to pre-
serve itself? I trust not.” Richardson, Messages -and Papers of the
Presidents, vol. I, p. 310 (emphasis added).

As a matter of fact one very material change in the Constitution as it
stood in 1927 when petitioner was naturalized has since been effected by
the repeal of the Eighteenth Amendment.

13 In 1938 Congress failed to pass a bill denying naturalization to any
person “Who believes in any form of government for the United States
contrary to that now existing in the United States, or who is a member
of or affiliated .with any organization which advocates any form of
government for the United States contrary to that now existing in the

however, to guarantee in advance that the impending proletarian revolu-
tions in Europe will all, or for the most part, be necessarily accompanied
by the restriction of the franchise for the bourgeoisie. Perhaps they will.
After our experience of the war and of the Russian revolution we can
say that it will probably be so; but it is not absolutely necessary for the
purpose of realizing the dictatorship," it is not an essential symptom of
the logical concept ‘dictatorship’, it does not enter as an essential condi-

35 The Manifesto was proclaimed in 1848. The edition in evidence was
published by the International Publishers in 1932. Petitioner testiﬁed
that he believed it to be an authorized publication, that he was familiar
with the work, that it was used in classes, and that he '.':1o ght its prin-

41

 

ciples were correct “particularly as they applied to the period in which
they were written and the country about which they were written.”

The excerpts stressed are: “The Communists disdain to conceal their
views and aims. They openly declare that their ends can be attained only
by the forcible overthrow of all existing social conditions.”

“Though not in substance, yet in form, the struggle of the proletariat
with the bourgeoisie is at ﬁrst a national struggle. The proletariat of
each country must, of course, ﬁrst of all settle matters with its own
bourgeoisie. —

“In depicting the most general phases of the development of the prole-
tariat, we traced the more or less veiled civil war, raging within existing
society, up to the point where that war breaks out into open revolution,
and where the violent overthrow of the bourgeoisie lays the foundation
for the sway of the proletariat.”

33 This work was written in 1917 between the February and October
Revolutions in Russia. The copy in evidence was published in 1924 by the
Dail Worker Publishing Company. Petitioner testiﬁed that it was circu-
late by the Party and that it was probably used in the classes of which
he was “educational director”.

The excerpts are:

“Fifth, in the same work of Engels, . . . there is also a disquisition
on the nature of a violent revolution; and the historical appreciation of
its role becomes, with Engels, a veritable panegyric of a revolution by
force. This, of course, no one remembers. To talk or even to think of the
importance of this idea, is not considered respectable by our modern
Socialist parties, and in the daily propaganda and agitation among the
masses it plays no part whatever. Yet it is indissolubly bound up with
the ‘withering away’ of the state in one harmonious whole. Here is
Engels’ argument:

“ ‘That force also plays another part in history (other than that of a
perpetuation of evil), namely a revolutionary part; that as Marx says,
it is the midwife of every old society when it is pregnant with a new. one;
that force is the instrument and the means by which social movements
hack their way through and break up the dead and fossilized political
forms—of all this not a word by Herr Duehring. Duly, with sighs and
groans, does he admit the possibility that for the overthrow of the system
of exploitation force may, perhaps, be necessary, but most unfortunate
if you please, because all use of force, forsooth, demoralizes its user!
And this is said in face of the great moral and intellectual advance which
has been the result of every victorious revolution! . . . And this turbid,
ﬂabby, impotent, parsons’ mode of thinking dares offer itself for accept-
ance to the most revolutionary party history has ever known’.”

“The necessity of systematically fostering among the masses this and
only this point of view about violent revolution lies at the root of the
whole of Marx's and Engels’ teaching, and it is just the neglect of such
propaganda and agitation both by the present‘ predominant Social-
Chauvinists and the Kautskian schools that brings their betrayal of it
into prominent relief.”

(Quoting Engels) “ ‘Revolution is an act in which part of the popula-
tion forces its will on the other parts by means of riﬂes, bayonets, cannon,
i. e., by most authoritative means. And the conquering party is inevitably
forced to maintain its supremacy by means of that fear which its arms
inspire in the reactionaries.’ ”

37 Petitioner contends that this document was never introduced in evi-
dence, and the record shows only that it was marked for identiﬁcation.

The view we take of the case makes it immaterial whether this document
is in evidence or not. The copy furnished us was printed in 1923 under
the auspices of the Workers Party. Hynes testiﬁed that it was an oﬂicial
publication, but not widely circulated. Petitioner had no recollection of

the particular pamphlet and testified that the American party was not

bound by it.
The excerpts are:

“That which before the victory of the proletariat seems but a theo-
retical difference of opinion on the question of ‘democracy’, becomes
inevitably on the morrow of the victory, a question which can only be
decided by force of arms.” -

“The working class cannot achieve the victory over the bourgeoisie by
means of the general strike alone, and by the policy of folded arms. The
proletariat must resort to an armed uprising.”

“The elementary means of the struggle of the proletariat against the
rule of the bourgeoisie is, ﬁrst of all, the method of mass demonstrations.
Such mass demonstrations are prepared and carried out by the organized
masses of the proletariat, under_ the direction of a united, disciplined,
centralized C}ommunistmParty. Ciwil 1iva,1f'ﬁis war. In tlliis vlvar the prolei

“The mass struggle means a whole system of developing demonstra-

ing against the capitalist order of the government. In this warfare of the

The excerpts are: '

“Marx’s limitation with regard to the ‘continent’ has furnished the _op-
portunists and inefisheviks of every country with a pretext for asserting
that Marx admitted the possibility of a peaceful transformation of
bourgeois democracy into proletarian democracy, at least in some coun-
tries (England and America). M_arx did in fact recognize the possibility
of this in the England and America of 1860, where monopolist capitalism
and Impertiallitsari (cilid Illot (tiexiit tand whrere _;nilitt_aris_m talnd bureiiucracy
were as ye i e eve ope . u now e si ua ion in ese coun ries is
radically different; Imperialism has reached its apogee there, and there
militarism and bureaucracy are sovereign. In consequence, Marx’s restric-
tion no longer applies.”

“With the Reformist, reform is everything, whilst in revolutionary
work it only appears as a form. This is why with the reformist tactic
under a bourgeois government, all reform tends inevitably to consolidate
the powers that be, and to weaken the revolution.

“With the revolutionary, on the contrary, the main thing is the revo-
lutionary work and not the reform. For him, reform is only an accessory
of revolution.”

39 (a) Program of the Communist International, adopted in 1928 and
published by the Workers Library Publishers, Inc., in 1929:

“Hence revolution is not only necessary because there is no other way
of overthrowing the ruling class, but also because, only in the process of
revolution is the overthrowing class able to purge itself of the dross of
the old society and become capable of creating a new society.”

Petitioner “agreed with the general theoretical conclusions stated in”
tﬁis Pri>g1;am, but he regarded “the application of that theory” as “some—
t ing e se .

(b) Programme of the Young Communist International, published in ~
929:

“An oppressed class which does not endeavor to possess and learn to
handle arms would deserve to be treated as slaves. We would become

» bourgeois paciﬁsts or opportunists if we forget that we are living in a

class society, and that the only way out is through class struggle and the
overthrow of the power of the ruling class. Our slogan must be: ‘Arming
of the proletariat, to conquer, expropriate and disarm the bourgeoisie.’
Only after the proletariat has disarmed the bourgeoisie will it be able,
without betraying its historic task, to throw all arms on the scrap heap.
This the proletariat will undoubtedly do. But only then, and on no
account sooner.”

_ (c) Why Communism, written by Olgin, and published ﬁrst in 1933,
by the Workers Library Publishers:

“We Communists say that there is one way to abolish the capitalist
State, and that is to smash it by force. To make Communism possible the
workers must take hold of the State machinery of capitalism and de-
stroy it.”

Petitioner testiﬁed that he had not read this book, but that it had been
widely circulated by the Party.

40 Since the district court did not specify upon what evidence its con-
clusory ﬁndings rested, it is well to mention the remaining documents
published before 1927 which were introduced into evidence and excerpts
from which were read into the record, but upon which the Government
does not speciﬁcally, rely with respect to the issue of force and violence.
Those documents are: Lenin, Left Wing Communism, ﬁrst published in
English about 1920; Bucharin and Preobraschensky, ABC of Communism,
written in 1919 and published around 1921 in this country (petitioner
testiﬁed that this was never an accepted work and that its authors were
later expelled from the International); International of Youth, a peri-
odical published in 1925; The 4th National Convention of the Workers
Party of America, published in 1925; ‘The Second Year of the Workers
Party in America (1924); and, The Program and Constitution of the
Workers Party of America, circulated around 1924. With the exception
of these last two documents, the excerpts read into the record from these
publications contain, nothing exceptional on the issue of force and vio-
lence. The excerpts from the last two documents stress the necessity for
Party participation in elections, but declare that the Party fostersno
illusions that the workers can vote their way to power, the expulsion
of the Socialist members of the New York Assembly (see Chafee, F-ree
Speech in the United States (1941), pp. 269-82) being cited as an
example in point. These statements are open to~an interpretation of
prediction, not advocacy of force and violence. Cf. Note 48, infra.

41 As Chief Justice (then Mr.) Hughes said in opposing the expulsion
of the Socialist members of the New York Assembly: “ . . . it is of the
essence of the institutions of liberty that it be recognized that guilt is
personal and cannot be attributed to the holding of opinion or to mere
intent in the absence of overt acts; . . .” Memorial of the Special Com-
mittee Appointed by the Association of the Bar of the City of New York,

51 Lenin, Selected Works, vol. VI. Put in evidence by petitioner. In the
same work is the following:

“Marxism is an extremely profound and many sided doctrine. It is,
therefore, not surprising that scraps of quotations from Marx—especially
when the quotations are not to the point—can always be found among
the ‘arguments’ of those who are breaking with Marxism. A military
conspiracy is Blanquism if it is not organized by the party of a deﬁnite
class; if its organizers have not reckoned with the political situation in
general and the international situation in particular; if the party in
question does not enjoy the sympathy of the majority of the people, as
proved by deﬁnite facts; if the development of events in the revolution
has not led to the virtual dissipation of the illusions of compromise enter-
tained by the petty bourgeoisie; if the majority of the organs of the
revolutionary struggle which are recognized to be ‘authoritative’ or have
otherwise established themselves, such as the Soviets, have not been won
over; if in the army (in time of war) sentiments hostile to a government
which drags out an unjust war against the will of the people have not
become fully matured; if the slogans of the insurrection (such as ‘All
power to the Soviets,’ ‘Land to the peasants,’ ‘Immediate proposal of a
democratic peace to all the belligerent peoples, coupled with the immedi-
ate abrogation of all secret treaties and secret diplomacy,’ etc.) have
not acquired the widest renown and popularity; if the advanced workers
are not convinced of the desperate situation of the masses and of the
support of the countryside, as demonstrated by an energetic peasant
movement, or by a revolt against the landlords and against the govern-
ment that defends the landlords; if the economic situation in the country
offers any real hope of a favorable solution of the crisis by peaceful and
parliamentary means.”

52 Article X, Section 5. “Party members found to be strike-‘breakers,
degenerates, habitual drunkards, betrayers of Party conﬁdence, provoca-
teurs, advocates of terrorism and violence as a method of Party pro-
cedure, or members whose actions are detrimental to the Party and the
working class, shall be summarily dismissed from positions of responsi-
bility, expelled from the Party and exposed before the general public.”

53 In 1927 naturalization was forbidden to such persons by §7 of the
Act of 1906, 34 Stat. 598, 8 U. S. C. § 364. Compare § 305 of the Nation-
ality Act of 1940, 54 Stat. 1141, 8 U. S. C. §705.

54 The complaint did incorporate by reference an afﬁdavit of cause, re-
quired by 8 U. S. C. §405, in which the afﬂant averred that petitioner’s
naturalization was illegally and fraudulently obtained in that he did not
behave as a man, and was not a man attached to the Constitution but was
a member of the Communist Party which was opposed to the Government
and advocated its overthrow by force and violence, and in that: “At the
time he took oath of allegiance, he did not in fact intend to support and
defend the Constitution and laws of the United States against all~ene-
mies,”foreign and domestic, and bear true faith and allegiance to the
same .

While this affidavit is part of tlr:1e5 complaint, we think it was not in-

tended to be an additional charge, but was included only to show compli-
ance with the statute. The attachment averment of the aﬂidavit is
elaborated and set forth as a speciﬁc charge in the complaint: The
failure to do likewise with the averment of a false oath is persuasive that
the issue was not intended to be raised. When petitioner moved for a
non-suit at the close of the Government’s case, the United States attorney
did not contend, in stating what he conceived the issues were, that the
question of a false oath was an issue. .

55 This contention is that petitioner was not ‘well disposed to the good
order and happiness .of the United States because he believed in and
advocated general resort to illegal action, other than force and violence,
as a means of achieving political ends.

Mr. Justice DOUGLAS.

1 For the Act in its present form see 8 U. S. C. § 501 et seq.

2 This provision was recast by the Act of March 2, 1929, 45 Stat. 1513-
1514, 8 U. S. C. § 707( a) (3), into substantially its present form. For the
legislative history see 69 Cong. Rec. 841; S. Rep. No. 1504, 70th Cong.,

provided in this chapter, shall be naturalized unless such petitioner . . .
(3) during all the periods referred to in this subsection has been and
still is a person of good moral character, attached to the principles of
the Constitution of the United States, and well disposed to the good order
and happiness of the United States.”

The American Committee for Protection of Foreign Born is an inde-

 pendent, non-partisan organization devoted to the complete mobilization

of foreign-born Americans for the victory program by:

1. Encouraging fair employment practices to enable the foreign born,
whether citizens or non-citizens, to contribute to the full measure of
their skill to our war production program.

2. Aiding the foreign born in eliminating Axis agents and ﬁfth-column
elements from their ranks.

3. Encouraging and helping non-citizens become naturalized in order
to enable them to assume greater responsibilities as citizens.

4. Maintaining national unity by preventing the enactment of “anti-
alien” legislation by Congress.

The American Committee for Protection of Foreign Born maintains a
Naturalization Aid Service to assist non-citizens who wish to become
naturalized citizens. Advice and assistance on naturalization and citi-
zenship problems can be obtained free of charge by applying at the Com-
mittee’s office either in person or by mail.

The work of the American Committee is made possible solely by pub-
lic voluntary contributions by individuals and organizations.

INTRODUCTION

HE decision of the United States Supreme Court in the case of
William Schneiderman is a landmark in the development of
American constitutional history. The issues at stake in this case
transcend the status of any one political party or the rights of any
one individual. The issues involve the political liberty of all parties
and of all Americans——our freedom to think as we see ﬁt. The Court
ruled in favor of the people. _
In this introduction I can do no more than highlight a few of

H the issues decided. A thorough reading and study of the Court’s
opinion as well as the concurring opinions is essential to any com- ‘

plete understanding of their signiﬁcance.

This is not only an important Court decision. It is a‘ great political
document. It reﬂects a continuing adherence to the principles of
democratic thought from earlier political documents on which our
country was founded. It represents a growth and development of
those principles. .

The law reviews will undoubtedly publish long theoretical discus-
sions of the signiﬁcance of Justice Murphy’s opinion (concurred in
by Justices Black, Reed, Douglas and Rutledge). But to the man in
the street——and to the future of our democracy—its signiﬁcance is
quite clear. It is crystallized in one sentence of the Court’s opinion:

“The constitutional fathers, fresh from a revolution, did not forge
a political strait-jacket for the generations to come.” ~

The views expressed in Justice Murphy’s opinion-—which are now
the ofﬁcial views of our highest court—constitute a powerful weapon
to prevent any straitjacket from being imposed upon the political
activity or minds of the American people.

Most citizens of the United States are not Communists. They are
Republicans or Democrats. The rights upheld by this decision are
not the rights of Communists alone, but of all Americans of what-

ever political faith. The decision has secured, to quote the words

of Justice Murphy, “the blessings of liberty in thought and action
to all those upon whom the right of American citizenship has been
conferred by the statute, as well as to the native born.” Justice
‘Murphy went on to say:

“. . . we should not cverlook the fact that we are a heterogeneous _

people. In some of our larger cities a majority of the school children
5

are the offspring of parents only one generation, if that far, removed
from the steerage of the immigrant ship, children. of those who
sought refuge in the new world from the cruelty and oppression of
the old, where men have beenburned at the stake, imprisoned, and
driven into exile in countless numbers for their political and religious
beliefs. Here they have hoped to achieve a political status as citizens
in a free world in which men are privileged to think and act and

speak according to their convictions, without fear of punishment or ’

further exile so long as they keep the peace and obey the law.”

The opinion of the Supreme Court in the Schneidermah case helps
to assure all Americans, naturalized no less than native born, “a
political status as citizens in a free world.”

Justice Rutledge, in his concurring opinion, made an extremely
important contribution. He wrote, in support of Justice Murphy:

“It may be doubted that the framers of the Constitution intended
to create two classes of citizens, one free and independent, one
haltered with a lifetime string tied to its status.”

The attempt to revoke the citizenship of William Schneiderman
made naturalized citizens uneasy. The security of their naturaliza-

tion and their rights as citizens was at stake. Foreign-born Ameri-’

cans were threatened with being relegated to the status of second-
class citizens. The rights of native-born citizens were equally in
danger, since freedom of thought and political affiliation were in
jeopardy.

It has been deemed. not necessary to include in this pamphlet the
dissenting opinion of Chief Justice Stone (concurred in _by Justices
Roberts, and Frankfurter). Chief Justice Stone held that there was
sufﬁcient evidence to sustain the ruling of the lower courts, which
was consequently binding on the Supreme Court “even though, sit-
ting as trial judges, we might have made some other ﬁnding.”

Great credit is due Wendell L. Willkie for his fearless and bril-

liant defense in the Supreme Court not only of the citizenship and .

political rights of William Schneiderman, but of the citizenship and
political rights of all the American people. The American Com-
mittee for Protection of Foreign Born may also be proud, and should
be congratulated, for its part in securing this Victory.

The American Committee was the only organization that ﬁled a
brief amicus asking the Supreme Court to review the decision of

the lower courts ordering Schneiderman’s citizenship canceled. It

was the only organization that ﬁled a brief amicus on the ﬁnal argu-

ment before the Supreme Court. It is ﬁtting that the American

Committee should publish the opinion which it helped to secure.

The decision of the Supreme Court was made at a time when the
whole world is at war. The Court’s opinion is guided by the principles
of freedom which are at stake in this war. Letters I'have received
from soldiers tell me that it has served to encourage them and
bolster their morale. It represents onecvictoriousbattle in the total

war which must be waged until ﬁnal victory is won against fascis

and oppression both at home and abroad. T

PRESS COMMENTS ON MR. WILLKIE’S POSITION

The decision of Mr. Willkie to argue the appeal for Mr. Schneid-
erman became known yesterday when it was learned‘ that Carol
King, chief counsel for the Communist secretary, had requested
Mr. Willkie to represent her client before the “Supreme Court.
Questioned late yesterday afternoon, Mrs. King conﬁrmed this re-

' quest and said that the 1940 Republican Presidential candidate had

accepted her invitation. ,

Later in the day Mr. Willkie, reached by telephone at his law
oﬂices, said that he had agreed to argue the Schneiderman appeal
before the Supreme Court. He declared that he considered the
case "‘a vital test case” and one that mightpossibly affect every

_naturalized. American citizen. He said he would represent Mr.

Schneiderman without fee. V

' While Mr. Willkie declined to discuss the case pending its hear-
ing in Washington some time in January, it is known that he agreed
to take it because he ﬁrmly believed that the decisions of the two
lower Federal courts seriously threatened constitutional rights
guaranteed to all citizens, regardless of their political. beliefs.
