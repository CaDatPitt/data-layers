6 WORK DAY

  

 

  

sylvania, where there are 110,000 unemployed, even with
production at 90% capacity. The blight is at its worst in
the coal towns of Kentucky and West Virginia, where min-
ers have long since exhausted their unemployment«insur-
ance checks and are literally on the border of starvation.

In Bloomﬁeld,'N. ]., recently, 15 members of the Inter-
national Union of Electrical Radio 8c Machine Workers
chained themselves to a pillar in the General Electric plant
because the company was moving away and leaving them
an-d several hundred other workers jobless. “If this is their
way of getting it out of their -systems,.well ﬁne,” said a
GE employee relations director.

But the GE workers weren’t just blowing off steam. Like
workers in all parts of the country, they were exposing
the mockery of the “right to work" laws by insisting on
the right to a job.

Millions of Jobs Can Be Crea+ed

The right to a job for every American worker can
begin to become a reality only with the establishment of
the shorter workweek. The AFL—CIO has officially gone on
record for the 35-hour McNamara-Roosevelt bill and has
called its Aprilconference in the nation's capitol to open
a determined ﬁght against unemployment.

It is estimated that a 30-hour week would create 16,-

10

 

  

000,000 jobs, of which over four million would be in man-
ufacturing. A 35-hour week would create 8,000,000 poten-
tial new jobs. '

Considering the millions of unemployed in the U.S.,
an-d that three million new jobs must be created each year
just to offset the increase in productivity, you ‘can see why
the slogan “30 for 40"—a 30-hour week at 40 hours pay——
is being voiced by more and more workingpeople.

Employers can well afford to grant the 30-hour week
with no cut in take-home pay——without raising prices a
cent. In 1957, the average proﬁt per worker in manufac-
turing before taxes was at the rate of $2,230 a year. At a
35-hour week, the cost would be $600 out of $2,300. For a
30-hour week, it would be $1,200 out of $2,230.

Since 1886, our labor movement has gathered tremen-
dous experience and has learned many valuable lessons
from long, hard. struggles. Through both set backs and
great victories we have come a long way in achieving better
understanding of our problems at home and the issues that
confront labor around the world. Today, in the ranks of
labor, there is a wide and growing awareness that the cold
war -policy and enormous armaments’ expenditures not
only take one-thir-d of our earnings for taxes, but deepen
the overshadowing threat of war and death. Hence, the
demand for peaceful co-existence and for greater under-
standing among peoples and for better economic condi-

ll

tions through world trade is steadily rising.

Since 1886, great changes have taken place in the United
States and around the globe. Such changes are still taking
place. Along with other nations, the people of our country,
especially those of us in theiranks of labor, hail the Cuban
revolution. We welcome, too, each new colonial struggle
for freedom an-d national independence. With increasing
alarm, indignation and opposition, We Americans View the
support and aid which our government gives to dictators,
investors, particularly landlords and the giant corporate
investors, particularly those who are exploiting and op-
pressing the peoples in Latin America.

Many millions in our trade unions understand, and in-
creasingly millions more are coming to understand how
the color-line—discrimination and segregation—divides our
worker ranks, strengthens the hands of the bosses and
creates ill-will towards the United States world over.

I

The existing weakness in our trade unions in the task

_ of organizing workers in the south, in ﬁghting against

wage—cutting and the run-away. shops in the south, not only
sustains discrimination and segregation and keeps Negroes
and whites divided, but makes it easier for the employers
to impose anti-union “right-to-work” laws and to attack
labor union organizers. Asbsury Howard, international
representative of the Mine, Mill and Smelter Workers, is
on a chain-gang in Alabama, and his son is indicted be-

12 .

cause he ﬁghts to win the right to vote for the Negro
people in Alabama. Organizers of the United Textile
Workers Union and the International Ladies Garment
Works Union have been severely beaten by anti-union
thugs in the South.

Until the whole trade union movement in our land

launches a united, aggressive ﬁght in support of equal .

rights for the Negro people, including the right to vote,
employers in the South will take advantage of present con-

S ditions and weaknesses to press more anti-labor laws

through the legislatures. Government officials, too, local,
state and Federal, in the South will continue their efforts
on behalf of the “white supremacy” landowners and bosses.

No less important an issue this May Day is the exploi-
tation of Puerto Rican and Negroworkers in our northern
cities, particularly in New York. Our Puerto Rican and
Negro brothers and sisters endure the lowest pay, the
highest rate of unemployment and the least opportunities
for employment or job advancement. Considering the
strength of our unions in the North, we must recognize
that such conditions are inexcusable. Moreover, to permit
su-ch conditions tends to break down the wage gains we
made through years of struggle by all of us and threaten
to undermine the militancy and unity we have established
in the trade unions. In the May Day spirit let us under-
take our responsibilities and tasks to eliminate these weak-
nesses and deplorable conditions. Our gains since 1886

.13

  

point the new, greater gains we can and will make on the
path of struggle now and in the days ahead.

 

As we recall Haymarket days, May Day 1959 witnesses’

again the persecution of those days—the arrests, prosecu-
tions and convictions of_..radicals, progressives, Commu-
nists. But today millions in our trade union ranks, along
with many in the professions, and our youths in the
schools, realize that such persecution under the Smith Act,

‘ the Taft—Hartley law, or by the Un-American Committee,

 

aims to stem the united struggle‘ against Big Business
domination of our country and the monopoly dictation of
government policies. The right of Labor to ﬁght against,
to propose curbs upon, and to seek to abolish monopoly
control is part of our May Day heritage. Thomas Jefferson,
Andrew Jackson, and Abraham Lincoln, voiced this same

democratic heritage in their historic efforts to curb cor-‘

porate monopoly and plutocracy. Since the turn of the

tide against McCarthyism, our -country has witnessed the "

spread of opposition to persecution for political beliefs,
and it is to the interest of all workers to bring political
persecution to an end. '

Ofher Demands

Trade unionists who participate in 1959 May Day
demonstrations will be speaking up on their issues that
concern the country’s welfare. Among the AFL-CIO legis-
lative proposals are demands that:——

14-

  

. Congress close the tax loopholes which favor the giant
corporations and wealthy individuals. This could ease the
load on workers, who are already paying about one-third of
their gross income in all kinds of taxes and are being hit
by new taxes—local, state and federal.

. The minimum wage be raised from $1 to $1.25 an
hour and coverage be extended to an additional eight mil-
lion workers.

. Unemployment insurance be continued for as long as
an individual is jobless, and at 65% of his former pay.

. Federal funds be supplied to pay. higher- teacher
salaries, help to relieve the shortage of 140,000 classrooms;
and to provide work for the building trades. '

. It is also demanding repeal of sections of the Taft-
Hartley law and ‘right to work” laws whose only purpose
is to weaken or smash unions. (We believe that the Taft-
Hartley law should be repealed and replaced by the Wag-
ner Labor Act.)

Civil Righfs

This May marks the ﬁfth anniversary of the historic
Supreme Court decision outlawing segregation in the
schools. The May Day meetings will demand that Federal
authoritybeuse-d to enforce this decision and to guarantee

full civil rights for Negroes. The militancy of the Negro "

people in ﬁghting for ﬁrst-class citizenship has been the
brightest and most inspiring feature of recent American
life.

May I. I959

On May First—all over the world—millions of workers
will be marching in huge and colorful parades to the
cheers of many millionfold more spectators. Other workers
will be holding large meetings and, in some instances, big
demonstrations or festivals. V

Countless workers will assemble in cities of the United
States, from New York to San Francisco, and from the Great
Lakes‘ to the gulfs and rivers in the South; in the major
capitals of Europe: in London, Paris and Rome; in Moscow,
Warsaw and Prague.

The vibrant words of the workers will be heard in many
different languages in Chicago, Rio de Janeiro, Peking,
Copenhagen, Soﬁa, Tel Aviv and A_ccra\——but their speeches
and slogans will express the same, vital theme: the desire
for a better life, free from economic hardship and worry,
in a peaceful world.

It was .our American labor movement which ﬁrst estab-
lished May Day as a workers’ holiday. That was on May 1,
1886, when America’-s young unions flexed their muscles and
made history with their nationwide strike for the eight-hour
day.

So impressed were the European unions and Socialist
movements with the militancy and courage of American
labor that, in 1890, they made May Day an international

4

 

  

-1o....

holiday; Every year, since then, it has been a day when the
workers of all lands celebrate their achievements, take stock
of their basic grievances and project their goals for the
future. This is the signiﬁcance of May Day 1959!

The Firs’r May Day

Let’s spend a few paragraphs recalling that militant and
trail-blazing chapter in our labor history. ’

At that time, men, women and children were working.
, from 10 to 16 hours a day and people were still feeling the

effects of the economic depression of the ’7os.

The {May 1, 1886 issue of the New York Herald carried
this report from its Chicago correspondent:

“There never was a time when the workmen in all depart-
ments of industry in this city were so united or so thoroughly
organized as now. . . . The following trades have received
the promise of a reduction of hours from their employers
on and after tomorrow:—Brewers, 16 hours to 10; bakers, 14
hours to 10; furniture workers, English clothing ~cutters,
tuck pointers, cigar makers, beer barrel makers, 12 hours to

)7

When nearly 35o,ooo,workers in the major industrial
cities poured out onto the streets on May 1 to demonstrate
for the eight—hour day, the industrialists became alarmed

and decided on strong counter-measures.

5

 

At a McCormick Harvester plant in Chicago, police at-

tacked the strikers, killing six and‘ wounding many others. .

The following day, during a protest meeting in Haymarket
Square, a bomb exploded, causing the death of seven police-
men and four workers.

With the newspapers whipping up hysteria, eight labor
and Socialist leaders were arrested, tried and convicted of
murder. On Nov. 11, 1887, four of them were hanged.
August Spies, one of the victims, cried from the gallows:

“There will be a time when our silence will be more power-
ful than the voices you strangle today.”

Spies’ prophecy proved correct. By 1890, the newly-
formed American Federation of Labor sponsored huge
May Day demonstrations for the eight-hour day; and, in
the same year, May Day was adopted as an international
labor holiday.

Illinois Governor John Altgeld, with the support of the
labor movement, free-d the remaining Haymarket victims in
1893, convinced that the whole affair had been a frame-up.

Unions Carry on Tradiﬁon

Over the years, May Day has highlighted and drama-
tized other issues in which the unions were actively inter-
ested. In the early 1goo’s,i May Day meetings and parades

6 .

    

  

stressed the need for child labor laws, for factory regula-
~tion codes, for workmen’s compensation.

In the ’3os, May Days inspire-d rousing demonstrations
for unemployment insurance; for home relief; for WPA
jobs for the unemployed; for civil rights; for Social Secur-
ity and minimum wage laws, and against war and fascism.

V The militancy of these demonstrations was not over-
looked by the lawmakers in the State capitols or in Wash-
ington.

The feeling of strength and solidarity that workers from
different industries would get at these May Day celebra-
tions often carrie-d over into support for each other’s
economic struggles.

The crowds that gathered to watch these May Day‘

turnouts, particularly the young people, could not fail to
be impressed with labor’s strength and progress.

Whaf Abouf Today?

With seven million workers unemployed and millions
more on part-time, there’s a deep need for the militant
spirit of-by—gone May Days.

Industrial production is almost back to pre—recession
levels, but there seems little chance that millions of these
jobless workers will be rehired. Our industrialists are quite
content with the present situation and are cheerfully pre-

7

  

dieting that proﬁts this year will be the best on record.

Most employers are planning to cut their labor force
even more—through new machinery or automatic devices
or just ol-d-fashioned speedup.

Here is what President H. Thomas Hallowell, ]r., of the
Standard Pressed Steel *Co., told Business Week magazine
(January 31, 1959) : “The recession didn’t last long enough
for us to do all the things,,we wanted to. . . . We could
have used more time to work out some more operating im-
provements.”

 

Vice—President Leonard M. Keating, of the A. C. Smith S

Corp., commented in the same issue: “The recession gave

_us the occasion to trim some fat that would have been

 

hard to get rid of in more prosperous times.” The “fat”
referred to human beings.

The industrial relations director of a big appliance
manufacturer was even more blunt about the pleasing busi-
ness aspects of the recession. “We’re getting more work

from fewer men,” he told the Wall Street Journal. “And —

we're going to get even more work from even fewer men.”

A Challenge 1'0 Labor

That’s what the industrialists are doing—and ~they’re
counting on getting away with it. They ﬁgure that the
labor movement has been so harrassed and hog-tie-d by the
Taft-Hartley law, by State “right to work” laws and so

8

 

  

 

smeared by the McClellan Committee that unions won’t
be able to protect the jobs and working conditions of their
members. i

But today we American workers have to stand‘ up and
ﬁght back. Although the Eisenhower administration has
consistently tried to talk away the recession, the fact is,
as revealed recently by an Elmo Roper national poll, that
over 60 million Americans—one—third of the nation—have
been personally hit by the economic crisis.

More than 47% of production workers either lost their
jobs or suffered reduced income. Negro workers have felt
the j0b—cutting policies of the corporations most keenly.
Although Negroes make up only 10% of the labor force,
t-hey account for one out of every ﬁve unemployed (20%) !

On May 1, 1g5g—just as on the May 1 of 73 years ago
—-the mood of America’s working ‘men and women is for
positive action. Then, the clamor was for the eight-hour
day; today, the demand for the six-hour day is moving into
the spotlight.

You can see the new mood of militancy born of despera-
tion in the auto centers like Detroit, where more than 12%
of the labor force is jobless and where a spokesman for the
Michigan Employment Security Council recently warned:
“Detroit has developed a hard core of about 200,000 who
just aren't going back to work in the plants.”

It’s the. same story in the steel towns of Ohio and Penn-
