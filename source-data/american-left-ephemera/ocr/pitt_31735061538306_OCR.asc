 

On December 14, 1946, the 54 nations of the United Na-
tions unanimously adopted a resolution “for the general reg
ulation and reduction of armaments.” At this writing the
debate on disarmament and atomic control is on, at the Se-
curity Council of the U.N. The resolution clearly called for
world-wide reductions of arms and troops, elimination of
atomic bombs, and all other weapons of mass destruction. ll
provides that arms reductions and atomic disarmament be

, controlled by the Security Council. The U.S. representatives

insist on a priority on atomic bombs and that atomic controls
be removed from the United Nations’ jurisdiction. Do the
women of America want this December '14 resolution to be
empty words or dowe want it carried out for the safety of
humanity? Let us speak out!

a Our “Atomic Diplomacy”

Our statesmen act like excited schoolboys ‘playing “hide-
and seek” with a ‘deadly toy. “Spy! He peeked!” they shout.
at another country. We women are not interested in “me
first” in ‘a game of world suicide. The scientists and engineers
who developed the bomb, are worried. They know how dan
gerous it is. Dr. L. W. Chubb, Director of the Westinghouse
Research Laboratory, worked with the atomic bomb project
from its beginning. In The World Within the Atom he
says: “Man has entered the age of atomic en_ergy——we are_ faced
with the greatest challenge of all times. _Will we use this
power to blast civilization from the earth, or will we learn to
apply it usefully in a world where each of us is the next door
neighbor to everyone else?” Mr. E. V. Murphee, vice-presi»
dent of the central research organization of the Standard Oil
Company, also connected with the atomic. bomb project, dis-
cussing “how will nuclear energy be geared into our industrial
and social system” (The Lamp, June, 1946), warns against
“misuse of atomic energy by trouble makers" anywhere.” He
concludes: “When man’s philosophy and statesmanship catch
up with his science, the atom can go to work for him safely."
Scientists generally want the bomb outlawed.

It is stupid for our statesmen to assume that we can long
have a monopoly on atomic bombs. Scientists for_years haw

worked on the atom and how to release its energy for indus»
trial and scientiﬁc uses. ,The atomic bomb was a by-product.
It can be abandoned without stopping peaceful uses of atom-
ic energy. Can we expect other countries will wait for us to
show them the atomic bomb in another war?

Our “Get Tough” Policy

The ‘-‘Get Tough” policy with friendly nations, especially
our brave ﬁghting ally, the Soviet Union, is atomic diplomacy,
a “we have it, so we can be tough” attitude without reason or
justice. In our common struggle against the Nazis the Soviet
Union’s casualties were twenty—one million dead and wound»
ed. They lost 81,000 cities and towns, six million homes.

V 84,000 schools, 40,000 hospitals, 32,006 factories,_and 71 mil

lion farm animals. Let us salute the magniﬁcent women of
the Soviet Union, in the spirit of International Women’s Day.
and‘ pledge to them friendship and peace, to help rebuild their
war-ravaged regions. Let us demand, in the spirit of Inter-
national Women’s Day, that our delegates to the United Na-
tions join in outlawing atomic bombs. Let us demand, in the
spirit of International Women’s Day, that our scientists de-

velop only peaceful uses of natural forces. One more world

war with atomic bombs on all sides, as there surely will be.
and our “great, wide, beautiful, wonderful world” will be a
dead planet—a grave rolling in space. Is this to be the end of
-all our dreams for our children, our hopes for a better life-
that in seering ﬂames, deadly. gas, and instantaneous dest.ruc~
rion, all perish?

Power of Women for Peace

, American women have the power to help stop it. Women
are 50.6 per cent of our population. Let the voice of Ameri
can- women be heard. Let every organization of women speal.

partment, to our delegates to the United Nations, to Congress.

tional Women’s Day, our determination to achieve “an en-

tremendous political power. We must use it intelligently, to
place our country in the Vanguard for peace.

The Atomic Bombers at Home

The struggle for peace and against fascism, is the world-
wide keynote of International Women’s Day, which we share
with millions of determined women around the world. In ad-
dition, American women must rally to the struggle for the
rights of labor and for an adequate standard of living, which

is the keynote on. the national scene today. They are two _
parts of one struggle against proﬁt-greedy atom bombers. H

Those who-hug the atomic bomb to their bosoms to use it
against the people’s land of Socialism,“ the Soviet.Union, will
smash labor unions, abolish rent control, lower wages and
raise prices for the American people—if they can get away
with it here. The present 80th Congress is an unholy alliance
between the poll-tax Democrats of the South and the Repub-
licans of the North. They are the majority. The government
print shop is overﬂowing with’ their anti-labor bills, which will
deprive ﬁfty million people, trade unionists and -their fami-
lies, of their strongest weapon as wage earners. Can we per-
mit this" to happen? Women have the power to help stop it,
if we understand how important unions are. . «

’ Unions Are Part of Democracy

Unions have raised wages, shortened hours, fought‘ for
decent living and working conditions, helped to abolish com-
pany towns, sweatshopsiand company control of the ballot
box. Unions fought in the _Civil War to save the nation, and
to abolish Negro slavery. They fought against property lim-
its on voting, for the free public school system, against i1n-
prisonment for debt, for women’s suffrage, for the secret ba1~
lot, against child labor. Unions are a part of democracy.
They have defended democracy, at home and abroad. To
smash labor unions was a maj_or part of the fascist pattern
which swept’ Europe under the Nazis. " ' ‘ 1

.: The Tiights of Labor

Here in the U.S.A. after years of struggle the rights of la-
bor became law in the Wagner Labor Relations Act. The
Norris-LaGu-ardia Act prohibited the use of injunctions

‘against labor. Labor has won the right to organize, make

demands, strike if necessary, picket, to have collective bar-
gaining by unions of their own choosing, a closed shop and
a contract with the employer, covering wages, hours, seniority,
conditions of work. During the war the unions served their
country well, increasing production “to keep ’em ﬂying, sail-
ing and ﬁghting.” Labor voluntarily made and kept the “no
strike” pledge for the duration. The Taft-Ball-Smith Bill
(S 55) is an all-inclusive bill -to destroy long fought and hard
won rights of labor. The Ball Bill (S 133) will bar the closed
shop, the union shop, and" maintenance of membership agree-
ments. The Ball Bill (S 133) would prohibit industry or
company-wide negotiations and would force unions to deal
with employers (even though they are nation-wide) on a, local
scale. The O’Daniel Bill (S 124) would repeal the Wagner
Labor Relations Act. . ' ’

80th Congress Would Make Workers ‘Slaves

Many of you who read this are working women. This anti-
labor program will destroy" your rights. Many of you who
read this are wives of working men. This program of the reac-
-tionary 80th pongress will make slaves of workers and their
families. It is the most serious and critical struggle in many
years. It is “get tough-”'~ ‘with labor, atomic diplomacy at home.
Union leaders will be jailed if they violate any part of these
laws. Hitler did allthis and later hung, shot and guillotined
brave labor leaders in-Germany, Hungary, France and else-
where, who deﬁed him. Maybe later the Tafts, Balls, and
O’Daniels have -”this, too, in store for America’s workers! Let
us, as American women, create the greatest possible pressure on
Congress to defeat these Senate anti-labor bills. If every Sen-
ator and Congressman knows now he will not go back to
Washington ever again if he votes for slavery for the Ameri-
can workers—we talk a language they understand‘. Wire your

Senators, get all organizations you can contact to do likewise.
also the individual members. Every International Women’s
Day meeting must speak out ﬁrmly and vigorously, in the
name of the millions of women who believe in democracy.
Let us pledge to organized labor our full support in their just
cause to preserve the very life of their organizations. ‘

Our Standard of Living

From the baby in the crib to grandpa, everyone is a con-
sumer. But women usually have the unhappy job of making
ends meet. There has been a 68 per cent rise in prices since
1938. Has there been an equal rise in wages? To hear the em-
ployers, and their mouthpieces in the press, on the radio, and
in Congress—its all the fault of the unions. Government ﬁg
ures of the Department of Commerce show that workers‘
wages and salaries rose only 6 per cent in 1946 while “business
incomes”—salaries paid to corporation officers, etc. went up
10 per cent and dividends and interest payments to owners and
stockholders of companies went up 24 per ‘cent. Corporation

‘proﬁts are now between ﬁfteen. and sixteen billion dollars (I

    

year, which is divided among a comparatively few people.
This is an all time high in the U.S.

Higher Wages Do Not Increase Prices

The Congress of Industrial Organizations (C.I.O.) has
shown ‘(in the Nathan Report) that the excess corporate profits
are so great that .a general wage increase of 25 per cent could be
granted without raising prices or without reducing proﬁts be
low the 1936-39 peacetime level. The average weekly earnings
of workers in manufacturing industry has declined from $47.50
in January, 1945 to $39.24 in October, 1946. Wartime overtime
and bonuses stepped them up temporarily. In every industry
where there was a wage increase the actual price increase was
Far more than would offset it. In food, where 1.3 per cent
would equal wage increases, the price rise was 26.2 per cent in
1946, according to O.-P.A. In textiles, where 4.5 per cent
would equal wage increases, the price rise was 26.2 per cent.
In hides and leather the wage increase could be offset by 3
:2

per cent, the- price rise was 20.1 per cent. These ﬁgures speak
eloquently to women. Big Business, not the unions, are re-
sponsible for price increases on food, clothing, and shoes.

Now They’re After More Rent

The luxury-loving capitalist roars, “What a big wage-
outrageousl” But the wife and mother sees the pay envelope
as “take it out to the butcher and grocer; pay the rent, gas,
electric bills; buy Johnny new shoes.” It doesn't go far!

The ﬁxed ‘income groups, teachers, people who draw old
age beneﬁts, workers on_ pensions or unemployed insurance,
all get the increased prices without any rise in their incomes.
Now the real estate interests want “more rent” and are ﬁght-
ing to end rent controls. It is a bitter struggle against power-
ful interests, who deliberately failed to provide adequate
housing for veterans and their families, hoping to raise rents

. sky high on all tenants. If the landlord’s lobby wins in Wash-

ington, D. C., there will be wholesale evictions and great suffer
ing among families in over-crowded cities. “Hold the line on
rent control,” is a “must” to express emphatically to Congress,’
in the militant tradition of. International Women’s Day and
thereafter. Unless Congress acts favorably all “rent control”
will end June goth.

Communists Want Socialism

Sometimes I am sure you ask yourself, “When will it all
end, when will we be’ able to live peacefully, happily, with
work and plenty for all?” It is an important question to ask
ourselves. It is a hope of women around the world.

I am writing this pamphlet as a daughter of a Socialist

and sulfragist, as an American woman who has been active
in the labor movement for forty—one years, and as a Com-

munist. (Don’t go away. Remember ‘Red-baiting, union‘

smashing, anti-Semitism, and racial “superiority” theories are
the pattern of the Nazis.) We Communists believe it is pos-
sible to have a system of society with peace, work, and abun-
dance for a1l—Socz'alism. We believein ﬁghting, hard to hold
every gain made by the unions and the people generally in

American people, we believe we need Socialism. It will abol-

they,use to make" tremendous proﬁts‘ on the labor of others

We know the majority of the American people are not‘
yet convinced, as we Communists are,‘ that’ this is all true.
’Meanwhile we Communists do not place ,ourselves apart

from the masses of peop-1e"nor‘wa'it for them to agree with us,

and progressive people may have on Socialism, they do not
constitute a bar to unity for all our immediate and important
daily struggles. We have no interests separate from the wel-
fare of the people of our country, of which we are a part.
Communists are workers, farmers, housewives, veterans, Ne-
groes, professionals—a cross section of our population. We
engage actively, with other like—minded people, in struggles

’ against that which oppresses these groups. -Communists are

producers, consumers, parents, voters, and as such join to-
gether with others who have the same interests—for higher
wages, housing, education, against the high cost of living and
to unite all progressive forces for the critical election of 1947
and 1948. These elections will be a show—down, we hope a
defeat for those who represent Big Business (monopoly cap-
ital), who would enslave the American people and hurl us
into an atomic war. To suppo_rt_ those who ﬁght these dan-
gerous reactionary forces, progressive men and women can-
didates who stand for democracy at home and friendly rela-
tions with other countries, is our common obligation for the
elections ahead.    A   ‘ *

Women’s Day in 1947, and expresses its conﬁdence in their
understanding and devotion to the cause of peace, for the
American standard of living, for the rights of labor and the
people generally. We believe that the great mass of American
women can and will do their duty in the grave political strug-
gles ahead, that our country and its people will be saved from
the disaster of fascism. Let us all pledge, in keeping with the

WﬂMAN’5 PLACE-
In the Fight for a Better World

By ELIZABETH GURLEY FLYNN

It’s American Born

March 8 is International Women’s Day in every lan-
guage, celebrated around the world. It was born in the U.S.A.
in. 1908, on the_ lower East Side of New York, stopping off
place of so many immigrant families, who "could go no fur-
ther. They came eagerly, seeking freedom in “the new world,”
as it was then called. They were determined to take their
children away from the tyranny and poverty of “the old world.”

They were handicapped by their inability to speak the lan-

guage. Wherever they found employment they were over-
worked, underpaid, cheated and abused as “greenhorns.” They
were crowded together in the slum tenements, ﬁretraps with-
out heat or light, infested with vermin. "Some of these, the
property of big, rich, rent-greedy corporations, are /still in-use.

At the close of the last century, in the needle trades, be-
ginnings of unionism were evident among the bolder workers.
Long and bitter struggles began, lockouts by the employers,
strikes by the workers. The bosses, then as now, were out to
smash the unions. The workers were determined to build
unions. They learned through struggles that “the Union makes
us strong.” Like the immigrant textile workers of New Eng-
land, the miners and steel workers of Pennsylvania, these East
Side men and women were never crushed.- They fought con-
stantly for every right they had conﬁdently expected. Some had
been driven from their birthplace by political persecution.
Others had voluntarily come to a far-off land, for a better life.
All of them had come to stay. VV e are their children or the chil-

3 .

 

  

dren of people like the111—“immigrants and revolutionists," as
President Roosevelt described the founders of our country. »

Votes for Men Only?

These immigrant workers became American citizens, as
soon as possible. In thoseidays a woman became a citizen
when her husband did. The theory was that they were “one."
But when it came to Election Day therepwas only one vote,
and he got it. She was not allowed to vote, nor were the na-
tive born women. American women were zero politically, ex-
cept in a few western states. They_were arrested if they tried
to vote. “Indirect influence” was supposed to satisfy women.
But if they sent a petition to a Congressman, governor, or a
mayor, he threw it in the waste basket. “A bunch of women!
They don’t count,” he said scornfully.

“Votes for Women!” was in the air. Parades and meetings
were held by middle class, wealthy and college women, de-»
manding suffrage—for equality, justice, as taxpayers, as prop
erty owners. The Socialist Women's Committee organized
the East Side women to demonstrate for a more compelling
reason—their need for political action to improve working
and living conditions, to protect their children.

“Working Women Demand Votes”

They wanted laws against the sweat shops, to clean up the
tenements, for a minimum wage, against child labor, for short-
er hours. They began to hold women’s conferences in 1904.
In 1908, March 8 was adopted as a day taagitate and dem-
onstrate for the right to vote. The tired overworked women
from the factories, the harassed mothers from the slum kitch-
ens, poured out enthusiastically for the mass gatherings in. the
squares of the East Side. These obscure anxious women of
the poor, with shawls and’ ’kerchiefs over _their heads, with
worn clothes and shabby shoes did not know that they were
making history far beyond the silken garbed ladies who met
at fashionable hotels. Their day became known around the
world.

 

  

It Became International

An International Socialist Congress was held at Copen~ '

hagen, in 1910. Clara Zetkin, Socialist leader from Germany
introduced a resolution to make the American day, an Inter«
national Women’s Day. It was unanimously accepted. Among

the delegates who voted for it were Lenin, the leader of the ,.
Russian Revolution in 1917, and Rose: Luxemburg, famous

Polish born, martyred woman leader of Germany, who was
murdered with Karl Liebknecht in 1919, by the forerunners of
the Nazis. Big Bill Haywood, ﬁghting leader of the Western»
miners, was an American delegate. During the past thirty-
seven years this day has made history. It coincided in Czarist

9 Russia, in 1917, with the beginnings of the revolution, when

90,000 workers downed tools. Women and men demonstrated
together for “Peace, Bread, Land.” In Women in‘ the Soviet
Far East, Dr. Fannina W. Halle writes of how the women of
the Central Asian cities—Samarkand, Bokara and others-
gathered around Lenin’s statues in 1938, and deﬁed a thous-
and year old convention by burning the symbol of their sla-
very—the veils that had covered their faces. Within ten years
many of these Far Eastern women were elected Mayors of ci-
ties, and members of Soviets (governing bodies).

Agnes Smedley tells in__ her Battle Hymn of China, how
March 8, 1938 was celebrated by the Women’s National Sal»
vation Association, attached to the Chinese Red Army hos---
pital behind the Japanese lines “in guerrilla land.”

Remember the Women of Spain

On March 8, 1936, 80,000 Spanish women demonstrated in
Madrid for “progress and liberty,” led by Dolores Ibarruri
(Pasionaria), now Secretary of the Spanish Communist Par-
ty, in exile, in Toulouse, France. . The prisons of Franco's
fascist Spain are overcrowded today with men and women
anti-fascists. It is the responsibility of women everywhere to»
demand that the tyrant Franco, tool of Hitler and Mussolini,
be removed and the Spanish Republic be reinstated. From
these examples, we learn that International Women’s Day is
a day to be proud of. It is identiﬁed with the struggles of the

5

  

poor and oppressed. It is identiﬁed with democracy and
freedom. _ _ . ~

Meetings_wi1l be held this year—in all the countries of the
United Nations, and in Germany, Italy and Japan, where it
has long been treason for women or men to speak of these
purposes, . Every meeting held in 1947 will be a link of soli-
darity binding together the women of one world for a peace-
ful, safe and free life.

End Fascism Everywhere

Women, soldiers on the home front, who worked in war
industries, served in civilian defense, rationed, saved, and sac-
riﬁced while their men fought, will be in meetings in the
United States, England, and the Soviet'Union. Women who
fought with guns in their hands, as partisans and guerrillas;
who served in the vast underground movements of countries
occupied by the enemy; whowere in prisons, concentration
camps or at forced labor—will-be in meetings throughout Eu-
rope and Asia. They arestill suifering—grief over lost ones,
hunger, cold, want. But they are working devotedly to help
rebuild their countries. Millions of women, under the banner
of the Women’s International Democratic Federation, (or-
ganized in Paris, France, in November, 1945) are pledged to
root out fascism‘. Only then the horrors, bloodshed, suffering
and sorrows of the war of liberation will not be in vain. We

American women who were spared so much our sisters else-
' where endured must pledge to them, on this day: “The end

of fascism everywhere!”

.March '8, l94«7—For Peace

Celebrating International :Women’s Day dramatizes past
accomplishments and highlights the struggles ahead. Great
progress has been made by women. We have the vote in our
country since 1920. Soviet women have voted since 1917,
British women since 1928.""'In the liberated countries one of
the ﬁrst political acts was to guarantee "suffrage -to women citi-
'zens. Today there are forty-siximillion American women eli-
gible to ’"'tfote,’a larger number than in any ‘country except

the Soviet Union. But let us not forget that ﬁve million

-Southern women, Negro and white, are deprived of their

votes by the poll tax as are an equal number of men. Violence
and impossible tests keep Negro citizens from voting through-
out the South. Those of us who can vote have a responsibility
to demand of our representatives the abolition of the poll tax
and adequate protection for all voters to go freely to the polls.
Without this there is no equal democratic suffrage in the
U.S.A. ' '

We Are Many

There are sixteen million American women. who are self-
supporting wage earners. Over one-ﬁfthof these are heads of
families. Three and a half million are union members. There
are thirty-seven million housewives, in cities and on farms.
Women are in auxiliaries; professional, community, educa-
tional, and language associations; parent, consumer, voter and
shopper groups, and in all political parties—from the G.O.P.
to the Communist Party. It has been said: “You have to be
very poor, very remote, or very stubborn not to belong to
something, if you are an American woman.” ' 
= Are there common hopes that can unite these -millions?
Are there common fears and anxieties? Except for a handful
of extremely rich women, whose capitalist ﬁnancial interests
would dictate otherwise—the universal reply to “What do you

: desire most in the world today?” would be -as one voice:

“Women want lasting peace!” Mothers and young wives of

-veterans, mothers of growing children, youth facing the fu-

ture, want a world free from the fear of war, and everything
that breeds war. ' - . - -

_ For the Safety of Humanity

Wars have been horrible enough in the past. The devel-
opment of the atomic bomb by American scientists have un-

{leashed a force that can destroy all life on our planet. To

save humanity from such a fate, the mothers of therace must
demand that the manufacture of this monstrous weapon be

‘outlawed forever. All existing stock-piles in our country must

be destroyed. ,
