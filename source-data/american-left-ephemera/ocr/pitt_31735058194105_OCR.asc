demanded that Gehrig ascertain why the policeman “shot to i

kill” and “then walked around and shot again.” She told
the District Attorney she did not think the matter was
“routine” when two lives were involved.

The Rev. William Jones, of the Second Baptist Church,
Freeport, arose and said the Fergusons, members of his con-
gregation, ,had always been “a quiet set of boys.” _

Rev. William F. Huston presented a resolution signed by
45 of his parishioners, stating:

“The shooting was all out of proportion with the handling
of disorderly conduct.” ’

Rev. Huston proposed the policeman be immediately sus--
pended.

Gehrig, obviously annoyed, answered he had no power- to
suspend the cop. ’ '

Members of the delegation clashed with Gehrig stating the
Freeport police chief said he exonerated the cop after the dis-
trict attorney’s office said the policeman was justified in his
action. »

It was strongly emphasized by the group that as chief law‘

‘enforcement ofﬁcer of the county, Gehrig could have ordered;

the arrest of the policeman if he saw ﬁt.

The district attorney, while stating he would not attempt
to prejudge the case, indulged in a bit of pre-judging, before
hearing all witnesses, when he told the delegation:

“It is a ‘fact that this boy (Charles Ferguson) said he had a
.45 caliber gunin his pocket and reached to his pocket.

He rebuked the delegation for “trying to inject color into
the administration of justice” and added:

“I'd be against that.”

But this drew a quick retort from another member of the
delegation.

"There are some features of this case that remind us of the
deep South," declared JJohn Lavin. executive secretary of the
Nassau Communist Party and member of the delegation.

''I don't see how a policeman would have shot three white
boys like that. particularly in uniform." Levin added.

The courtroom was electriﬁed when Edward Ferguson, a
ﬁfth brother who came from Washington, D. C., arose’ and,
his eyes overﬂowing with tears, asked why the policeman had
to shoot two more men after he felled Charles.

''I came all fhe way from Washingfon see my brofher who is
in jail." he sfafed. "They won'f lei me see him. I demand fo
see him.'' C

At this point Mrs. Selma Rose, a neighbor of the Fergusons,

. leaped to her feet and pointed to the short leather jacket

worn by Edward.
“That’s the kind of a jacket that Charles wore that night,”

i . she shouted. She showed the district attorney by making

Edward stand up and turn around that if anyone carried a
gun under such a jacket it would be quite obvious to a
policeman. ‘ -

Kangaroo Court
The transcript of the trial of Richard Ferguson in Freeport
Police Court, Feb. 5, 1946, nine hours after the shooting,
throws light on the reckless lawlessness of the policeman’s act.
With two men dead and one wounded in a Navy hospital,

‘ far from prying eyes, Freeport ofﬁcialdom moved with in-

decent speed to get the one remaining brother, a damaging
witness against the cop, out of the way.
Richard was haled before Police Judge Hilbert R. Johnson,

‘ before the bodies of, two brothers were cold. The 13-page

witness.

transcript of the trial shows the judge failed even to protect
the basic rights of the defendant.

Richard was not advised by the court, according to the
record, that he had a right to be represented by counsel. Nor
was he warned the law did not require him tovtestify as a

On}the stand, the cop, questioned by the judge, testiﬁed
he seized the four Fergusons after Scholakis, the restaurant
owner, said the Negroes “molested" him. Romeika said
Scholakis alleged the men broke a window of Sinclair Coal

11

Co. office 2oo__feet from the restaurant. There was no direct “

evidence the Negroes broke the window.

The cop said the Fergusons approached him. Charles I
Ferguson, he claimed, used “profane language.” The judge

asked what Richard did. , _
What clid he actually say or do?
A. Well, I arrested the four for disorderly conduct and
disturbing the peace and as I had them against signal box
14, I notiﬁed Lt. Dixon that I wanted the station wagon down

as I had an arrest.  . I had the four defendants march back .

to the Sinclair Coal Go. (Here he lined them up against the

wall execution style.) .
Romeika testiﬁed the four shouted in chorus: “We will

kill you. You aren't going to take us in.”

But Richard, testifying on the same witness stand, declared: Q

“I don’t recall anyone saying that.” ~

He was asked if he remembered the language used. g

Q. That they don’t like cops?

A. No. »

Q. You don’t recall any profane language at all?

A. I don’t recall what was said.

Q. Was any profane language used?

A. When coming up from the Park.

Q. None with the oﬂicer?

A. No. “ -

Q. You were very polite to him?’

A. No, but we weren’t cursing at him. I‘ didn’t say a
word to him. *

Richard also denied he had cursed the restaurant man,
Scholakis.

The judge, however, kept darting questions at Richard,
apparently trying to get him to justify the cop’s action. But
Richard, in a hostile atmosphere and without friends in the
court, insisted no disorderly language was used.

Q. You didn’t hear any profane language used in the
presence of the oﬂicer?

A. No.

Q. You want me to believe that if you were within eight

12

feet of your brothers all the time that the police oﬂicer is «not

if telling the truth?

A. No, I didn’t say that.

Q. You aren’t hard of hearing?

A. No.

Judge Johnson called Richard to stand before him. In a
manner reminiscent of Mississippi swampland Jimcrowp juris-
prudence, he lectured the young Negro. He said:

“I just want to say this, that as far as I am concerned, I am
not going to stand for any rowdyism in this village and I don’t
intend to put up with it. Four fellows going out looking
for trouble—they are going to get just what they are looking

" for. And I want to commend the police oﬁcer who can keep

trouble away from this village. When you go out looking
for trouble you usually ﬁnd it.” (

He sentenced Richard, the surviving brother, to 100 days
in jail. ‘

Dixie justice had come to New York.

VII

The Conscience of America

But Dixie justice must not prevail.
The conscience of -America must be aroused.
It must not permit a legal whitewash of policeman Joseph

b Romeika, who, in the foul atmosphere of race hatred, shot

the Ferguson brothers to death.

The ‘brothers were celebrating a family reunion. But
Romeika cut it tragically short. He kicked one brother in
the groin, shot him dead, walked around the group and
deliberately ﬁred again. '

Gazing with psychopathic fear at his handiwork—at the
three brothers sprawled on the groundin a bloody heap-the
cop sought into his shallow, murky, conscience for an alibi. He
sought to save his own skin from righteous public wrath and
the law. _ ’

He said Pfc. Charles R. Ferguson, first victim, threatened
to shoot him. But neither Charles nor Alfonzo, the two dead

13

.»-

brothers, were armed. Nor did Joseph, the wounded sailor,
nor Richard, the fourth brother who escaped the‘-..__bullets,
have a gun. . A

The only gun was in his own blood-stained, guilty hand. V T

New witnesses appear daily to testify that the policeman
killed in cold blood. But District Attorney James N. Gehrig
ﬂatly refuses to conduct a special investigation. He insists
the brothers were not killed because of their color. This is
not so. No white soldiers or sailors would be shot down this
way. He said the case will be handled in a “routine" manner.

The people of America must never, never let this human
slaughter be callously covered"up, forgotten or brushed aside
by any cold-hearted, bureaucratic, reactional legal “routine.”

This is plain, wanton killing! The policeman must be
arrested, indicted and tried by a jury for his deed.

Bias against Negroes in Freeport must be ended. The
"ghetto” system in the village with its Cleveland Ave. Jimcrow
school, must be abolished.

Governor Dewey must be forced to act. Demand he investi-
gate the outrage. ’

Demand Freeport Mayor Cyril Ryan and his Police Chief
Peter Elar suspend and jail the cop.

Demand indemnity’ for the Ferguson family—for Charles
Ferguson's widow, Minnie, and three small children, Charles,
]r., ﬁve, Richard, three, and Wilfred, two.

This is no time for complacency. This is no time to con-
ﬁne action to whispers in parlor discussions about “how bad
things are getting.” .

Things are bad. Very bad. The lynch spirit has moved

’ across the Mason-Dixon line into the heart of New York

State. J -
If the slayer of the Fergusons is permitted to go unpunished
we shall have failed in the struggle for common justice.

We dare not fail. The conscience of America must not
permit it.

_ ~ Introduction

This pamphlet tells the story of one of the most un-Ameril
can fascist crimes ever committed in our country.

It happened not in Mississippi or Georgia. It happened
in New York State, within 24 miles of New York City, the
most liberal city in America.

Two Negro citizens, Pfc. Charles Ferguson, and his brother
Alfonzo, a veteran of World War II, were wantonly shot to
death by quick-triggered Policeman Joseph Romeika, in
Freeport,,Long Island.

The grief and suffering of the family, children and loved
ones of these two murdered heroes are beyond description.
But the disgrace and the shame fall upon America.

Our veterans are returning home asking for jobs with union
pay, for decent houses for themselves and their families, for
democratic liberties which they have fought for. Are they
to be given home-grown fascism instead?

Dixie lynch law must be driven out of New York. Labor
and progressive people, the democratic citizens of this state,
won't stand for it. The fascist-killing of the Ferguson
brothers must be avenged by punishing the slayer to the full
extent of the law. We must serve warning that IT MUST
NOT HAPPEN HERE!

The facts are ably and faithfully told in this pamphlet.
The Daily Worker publishes it, in accordance with its uncom-
promising ﬁght for veterans’ rights and for the full, uncon-
ditional equality, which is the right of Negro Americans. We
pledge a ﬁght to the ﬁnish for justice.‘ We ask you to enlist
in the ﬁght and to get your fellow-workers and friends to
enlist. We believe the broadest" circulation of this pamphlet
will help accomplish this supreme people's job.

DIXIE COMES TO NEW YORK

The GI Slayings in Freeporf
By HARRY RAYMOND

I
Funerals in Long Island

The last three plaintive bugle notes of “taps” faded across
the broad stretch of sun-bathed Long Island National Ceme-
tery. A casket bearing the body of Pfc. Charles R. Ferguson,
U. S. Army Air Corps, was lowered into the ground.

Ferguson, a 27-year-old Negro, had served honorably in the
war against fascism. But he did not die as he would have
preferred to die, on the ﬁeld of battle. His young life was
snuffed out Tuesday, Feb. 5, 1946, by a bullet from a service
revolver of a Negro-hating policeman.

Yet, as though he had fallen in a military campaign, he was
buried with full military honors. A neat ﬂag of his country,
supplied by the U. S. Army Quartermaster, was carefully
draped over his casket. There was an Army riﬂe squad.
Three volleys were ﬁred. A clergyman said a prayer. Every-
thing was strictly regulation and GI. ,

Standing before the open grave, Mrs. Minnie Ferguson, the
widow, wept bitterly. A small group of relatives and neigh-
bors stood with bowed heads. More neighbors would have
come. But there was little room in the small caravan of
borrowed cars that drove the 17 miles to.the cemetery. And
some had to stay» behind in the Ferguson home to be with
little two-year-old Wilfred, three-year-old Richard and Charles,
ﬁve, children of the dead soldier. They did not know their
father was dead. .. _

As the sad little caravan drove back to Freeport, another
funeral procession bearing the body of Alfonzo Ferguson,
war veteran and brother of Charles, who was likewise shot to
death by the trigger-hap-py cop on that tragic Tuesday, was
on its way to another open grave.

3

Alfonzo’s funeral was simple. There were no military trap-I‘
pings. Navy Seaman 3/c Joseph Ferguson, the third brother,

who received a bullet wound from the same police gun, stood a

at the graveside when Alfonzo’s body. was lowered. J

Richard Ferguson, fourth brother at the scene of the kill-
ings, did not attend the funerals. He was in Nassau County
jail where, protesting innocence, he was railroaded for 100
days on a disorderly conduct charge. Richard charged from
his cell that Policeman Joseph Romeika, slayer of his brothers,
deliberately killed the two without provocation. He is free
now, his case pending appeal. . .

Romeika was whitewashed by local authorities when he said
the brothers were “disorderly” and claimed Charles threatened
him with a non-existent gun.-

Perhaps Mayor Cyril Ryan of Freeport, Police Chief Peter
Elar and Nassau County District Attorney James N. Gehrig
think the'case against Policeman Romeika is closed now that
the two brothers have been properly buried. But a growing
citizens’ movement is demanding justice.

Investigation Demanded

A thorough investigation of the case was at once demanded
by outraged Freeport citizens.
‘ Aroused by what they called “a wanton shooting,” a delega-
tion of 24 leading local citizens visited Police Chief Peter Elar.

The delegation, headed by Elihu Burman, local attorney,
asked the Police Chief to launch an immediate probe of the
killing"and to suspend the policeman until ﬁnal disposition
of the case. Elar told the group he had investigated and
would take no further action. He said the matter was closed
so far as his department was concerned, and the only action
on the matter would be a grand jury hearing.

District Attorney James N. Gehrig, announcing the pend-
ing of the grand jury action, said the matter would be
“routine.”

C 4

Immediately afterthe shooting, Freeport police, acting on
instruction of Chief Elar, threw a_ heavy cordon around the
bus terminal and stationed men with tommyguns and tear
gas at the strategic points. A lynch atmosphere hovered over
the area as Elar stated ‘he had taken this action to offset a
“possible uprising of local Negroes.” '

The delegation, composed of both white and Negro citizens,
left the Municipal Building voicing dissatisfaction with Elar’s
position. Members of the group said they planned further
action to get to the bottom of the case.

‘During the hearing at police headquarters, members of the ,
delegation pointed to Jimcrow conditions in the city, cited .
A the existence of a Jimcrow school and insisted that the atmos-’

phere surrounding the case, and the conditions under which
Negroes live in Freeport, were contributing factors to wha
happened. on that fatal Tuesday. —

They pointed out that the dead soldier, who was on fur-A

lough from Greensboro, N. C., had a good military record
and had just recently reenlisted in the Army, after serving
overseas.

The trigger-happy cop, a rookie in the force with eight
months’ service, said he turned his blazing gun on the Negroes
after he was called by Gus Scholakis, owner of the Freeport
Bus Terminal Tea Room. ,

Scholakis had refused to serve the Negroes coffee. He
served white customers earlier. He claimed the Fergusons
were “disorderly” and had “insulted him.”

Alexander Coleman, Freeport aviation mechanic, said he
was not surprised the trouble developed in the Bus Station.

Tea Room. He recited an earlier incident of entering the .

tea room with a Negro who was likewise refused service...
Joining the Freeport protest movement were representa-
tives of the local Community Council, pastors of various
churches, leaders of Local 450 of the United Electrical, Radio
and Machine Workers, CIO, the Interfaith Community Coun-

cil, the National Association for Advancement of Colored,

People and the Calvin F. Adams Post of the American Legion.
Also the Veterans Against Discrimination, -the newspaper

5

Peoples Voice, the Nassau County Communist Party, the

Nassau County American Labor Party, the Women’s War

Guild, and the American Youth for Democracy.
Prominent individuals demanded immediate arrest, in-
dictment and trial of Policeman Romeika. V
Among these were Harlem Congressman A. Clayton Powell,
New York «City Councilman Benjamin J. Davis, City Council-

man Peter V. Cacchione, the Rev. Theodore Bobilin, superin-

tendent of 77 Long Island Methodist Churches; the Rev. Ben
Richardson of Harlem, Sta-te Assemblyman Hulan Jack, Mrs.
Bradley Smith, Freeport Community Council; Rabbi Rosen-
blatt, Roosevelt Temple; the Rev. Frederick M. Meyer, Rock-
ville Center Congregational Church; Joseph Kehoe, American
Communications Association, CIO; Morris U. Schappes,
teacher, and Stanley Faulkner, attorney for the Fergusons and
leader in the National Lawyers Guild.

’ ]ohn Lavin, executive secretary of the Nassau County Com-
munist Party, at the outset, characterized the slaying of the
brothers as “a shocking murder in cold blood” having “the

.....odor of the deep south.”

Communists ‘Act

Quick to act and to demand that justice prevail in Freeport,
the New York State Board of the Communist Party called on

all people of the state to “declare abhorrence of this bloody ~

deed.” _ .

A statement signed by Robert Thompson, Israel Amter,
Bill Norman, Benjamin J. Davis and Charles Loman, New
York State Communist leaders, said: 

"The spirit of Hitler is alive in Freeport. The fascist tilibuster
tactics of the Bilbos and Eastlands in the U. 5. Senate. and the
propaganda of fascist groups are encouraging lynchers and anti-
Semites all over America.

"The killing springs from the race hatred created by the
agents at big business opposition against the Fair Employment

Practice Act. If is encouraged by the big trust magnafes who i

feel‘ that now is the ﬁme to kindle race conflicts in order to

divide the people. weaken the labor movement, and tighten their

economic stranglehold upon the masses of the people.
"We protest and denounce this lynch attack upon innocent

Negro ciﬁzens. The Communist Party calls upon the people oi _
New York State to declare their abhorrence of this bloody deed."

The Communist Party called on the people to: V

Demand the removal of Patrolman Romeika, and his trial
for manslaughter.

Demand the release of Richard Ferguson from the Nassau
County Jail (he is now free on appeal) and indemnity for
the slain brothers.

Call on Governor Dewey to investigate this outrage.

Send protests to the Mayor of Freeport.

Governor Dewey, besieged with protests, telegraphed Con-

gressman Powell he would “look into the matter.”

IV

Eyewitnesses Refute Cop *

Meanwhile, Mrs. Madeline Moher and Miss Joan Bollmer,
‘white citizens of Long Island, made an affidavit stating they
were in the Bus Terminal Tea Room at the time the brothers
were charged with being “threatening and disorderly.”

When they read of the case in the newspapers they came to
Attorney Faulkner and this writer. They said they “couldn’t
sleep” when they heard of the ofﬁcial whitewash of the case.

“If the Negroes had been noisy and disorderly, or insulting,
as charged by the police, we would have noticed it,” Mrs.
Moher declared.

They said the tea room owner, while serving coffee to them '

and two other white persons, bus drivers, told the Negroes
he had none. Both women said they saw three inches of coffee
in the glass gauge of the urn.

Mrs. Moher and Miss Bollmer rode in a bus from Hemp-

7

stead with the four Ferguson brothers into the Freeport Bus

Terminal prior to the shooting. , _

“The brothers seemed to be having a. good time,” one of the
women told me. “They were standing in the crowded bus.
They were polite and not drunk and disorderly.” ,

The witnesses further stated they did not hear or see the
Negroes break any windows of a coal company office, more
than 150 feet from the Terminal, as charged by police.

They identiﬁed bus drivers and others in the tea room.

They were not present, however, during the shooting, having

left on another busprior to that time. p

Richard Ferguson said he never heard or saw any of his
brothers pretend to reach for a gun. He charged the cop
seized his brother Charles, kicked him in the groin and then

.shot him down. He" further charged the ’policeman then

walked deliberately around the group and ﬁred again felling
the Navy man.

The official version is that two shots were ﬁred, one killing
both Charles and Alfonzo; the other striking Joseph, the
sailor, in the shoulder and wounding him.

. V .
"Not Color Case." Says D. A;

Nassau County District Attorney, chief law enforcement
officer of the county, announced publicly the Ferguson slay-
ing would be handled as a matter of “routine.”

But a delegation of 75 prominent Long Island citizens faced
him in a high vaulted Mineola Supreme Court chamber
and declared: -

“Routine, Hell! This is a deliberate killing!”

“I think a lot of agitation has taken place because of the
assumption that the boys were shot because they, were colored
boys,” Gehrig barked back.

Mrs. Anna J. Martin, leader of the delegation, retorted steps

‘would be taken to assure justice.
