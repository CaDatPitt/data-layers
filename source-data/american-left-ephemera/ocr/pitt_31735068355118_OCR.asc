INJUNCTION ISSUE/D m BANNER

STRIKE

TUCSON, June 26-Superior Court Judge Herbert
‘F. Krucker today issued a restraining order injunction
against Local 929, which has been on strike against the
Banner Mining Company since May 27.

Judge Krucker ordered the Local to “cease and W

desist” from mass picketing—a limit of two pickets was
set—and from violence, name calling and intimidation.

The local denies all the charges alleged in the pleading I

for the injunction.

’ International Rep. Charles Wilson reports that pick- :I‘

ets are still being maintained around the clock and that

the weekly distribution of food parcels to members doing
' picket duty is going smoothly. . ‘

Difficulties have been experi-
enced, however, in connection
with utilities. Members are un-
able to pay their telephone and

. electricity bills and cannot get

credit from the utilities_ as they
might in a small mining‘ camp.

’ Sister locals have pitched in
with sizable contributions. ,Su-

perior has contributed $1,000,
San Manuel has contributed ~

$500, and the International has
already sent $500, with more
available when needed, accord-
ing to Secretary-Treasurer Irv-
ing Dichter.

Miami, Bisbee, Ray, and Hay-

den have contributed. amounts,

ranging from’$100 to $200.

The Banner contract expired
February 1 of this year. The
company, despite the fact that
its wage scale is $1.90 a day
behind area standards, offered
a three-year contract with in-
creases of only 3, 4, and 5
cents a year. Local 929, after
months of bargaining, trimmed

its demands to a one-yearpact 1 A

with a wage increase of 9.6c
perhour and improvements in
the health and welfare provi-
sions.

 In negotiations, Local 929 has
the assistance of Board Mem-

ber Macclovio Barraza, Wilson, 9

and International Rep. Sylvain
Schnaittacher.

 

The international canvassing com-
mittee elected at the 70th Anniversary
Convention has certified the election of
Albert C. Skinner as President of the
International Union. Skinner defeated
Regional Director J. P. Mooney 10,197
to 9,161. ‘

met at the International union head-
quarters in Denver June 17-21, also

85 years of Local No. I

BUTTE, MONT.—~June 13 was a great day for the miners——and for everyone else

' in Butte—as Butte Miners Union No 1 celebrated its 85th birthday. ‘

Some 6,000 people participated in the day’s events which included free rides and ice

cream in the amusement park
for the kids, a free dance in the
Miners Union Hall and the 45th
annual first aid contest spon-
sored by the Anaconda com-
pany.

Butte stores were closed for
‘the occasion, as were the city’s
parking meters—much to the de-
light of the local citizenry. City
employees got a four day holi-
day.

More than 2,500 people attend-
ed the first aid contest held on
the pavillion of Columbia Gar-
dens. W. L. Smith, chief safety
engineer for Anaconda’s Butte
operations, presided as chair-
man and introduced contest of-
ficials. J. Howard Bird, district
director of the U.S. Bureau of
Mines, was th e announcer.
James Westfield, assistant di-
rector of the Bureau of Mines in

4‘ ‘Washington, D.C., and Nathan

May, state mining inspector,

- were guests of honor.

A crack first aid team from
the Steward Mine, captained by
Walter Forsty and coached by
Battie B. Favero, won first place
and a $300 prize.

Second place was shared by
the Mountain ConiMine “B”
team and the Kelley Mine team,
each team receiving the $180
second prize.

Nineteen teams, or 114 con-
testants, took part in the com-
petition. ‘ Each contestant re-
ceived $76.35 for contest and
practice time plus contest cloth-
ing.

Fun For All

While thousands of children
took union-sponsored rides on
the roller coaster, merry-go-
round and other amusements,
their parents thronged the board-
walk fronting the concession

‘ stands.

The picnic grove drew hun-
dreds of parties. Feasting on
Scotch, Irish, Welsh, Mexican,
Finnish, Italian and Swedish
national delicacies, and, of
course, the ubiquitous hot dogs
and hamburgers, the Butte min-
ers and their families thoroughly
enjoyed their union’s 85th birth-
day party.

President-elect:

‘0N WITH THE J 0B’

By AL SKINNER
President-Elect

HE official report of the union’s Canvassing Committee has

certified the election of our new Executive Board, including
my own election as International President. Brother John Clark
has served our union in this position ably and well since 1947. I
am therefore deeply aware of the responsibility and the challenge
which confront the new president of our union.

This was a very hotly contested election. Sixteen candidates
ran for the 8 positions on the Executive A "
Board. The race for presidentwas an espe-
cially vigorous contest between Brother
Mooney and me.

To all members who supported and vot-
ed for me may I thank you for your confi-
dence and support. To those who voted for
Brother Mooney let me ask for your support
and cooperation in meeting the demands of
this important job.

To every member of the union, let me
assure you that; I intend to be a very active
and responsible president. In our union the
position of president is not, as it is in some
unions, solely a position of prestige, honor or

glory while other people do the work.
. :14 :3 =34

pressed by their delegates in the Convention.

gram including bargaining, organization, ‘political action, the
civil rights struggle, developments in the industry and in the

.THE MINE-MILL UNION

District 5 Board Member Al-
fred Petit-Clair has initiated an
all-out campaign among eastern
seaboard locals to support Pres-
ident Kennedy’s civil rights leg-
islation.

In a June 18 letter to local
presidents, vice presidents, re-
-cording and financial secretar-
ies, Petit-Clair warned that
there are “considerable obsta-
cles in the path of this needed
legislation. There is no question
that the greatest kind of mobil-
ization and public support will
have to be developed before the
final vote in Congress.”

, >!= >l< >i=
' “I would like to suggest to all
local unions that we do every-
thing possible in conjunction with

. local organizations in this civil

rights fight for the attainment of
this program.
‘ “In addition, in the event mass

rallies are held or a lobby trip is
necessary to Washington, we
stand, prepared to cooperate
fully.

“Local unions will be notified
immediately what they can do
to participate. Mine-Mill has
had a proud record in the fight
for civil rights; let us continue
and increase our efforts.”

What some locals are doing to
participate in this historic move-
ment is indicated by the accom-
panying stories on this page.

Job Bias Costly

Washington, D. C.-—America’s
gross national product might
rise by 2.5 percent “if the edu-
cational achievements of non-
whites were fully utilized by re-
moval of discrimination in em-
ployment,” the Council of Eco-
nomic Advisers said on Sept.
25 in a report to Congress.

Unions round the world
Support M-M defense

. Labor unions around the World are rallying to the defense of Mine—Mill’s leaders as
they approach another round in the “conspiracy case.” S

Resolutions, letters and telegrams to Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy and to
‘US. ambassadors abroad are the order of the day with local and national unions and
labor federations responding to President Clark’s appeal in early May.

Japan
H. Ota, president of the Gen-

’ eral Council of Trade Unions of

Japan, has written President
Clark “on behalf of 4.3 million
workers of Japan (who) send
our greetings to encourageyour
Union’s struggle.”

France

’ The Union des Syndicats
Ouvriers (federation of trade
unions) of Le Havre writes that
“Workers’ solidarity is not an
abstract noun. We "shall see to it
that our local press publishes
the resolution which we have
sent, by way of your ambassa-
dor, to Attorney General Ken-

nedy.” "
The resolution states that the
federation’s 2 6 , 0 0 0 members
bring “all their sympathy and
solidarity to. the non-ferrous
metal - workers of the United
States and to the Union which
represents them . . . and which
“now battles for the rights of
labor, for better working condi-
tions, and for the defense of its
leaders, against whom the em-
ployers conspire with the aid of
the anti-labor Taft-Hartley law.”

Finland .

The Trade Unions Interna-
tional of Workers of the
Building, Wood, and Building
Materials Industries, represent-
ing more than 8 million workers
throughout Europe, has written
the attorney general protesting

' ' , the-attack on Mine-Mill’s present

and past leaders.
“Working p e 0 pl e in many

branches of industry throughout

‘have been deeply concerned
with the proposed retrial of the
International Union of Mine,
Mill and Smelter Workers’
leaders charged with ‘conspir-
acy’ to violate the notorious
Taft-Hartly law.

“It is widely known that one
of the oldest unions in America
. . . has been forced to lead a
persistent ‘heroic struggle
against exploitation and attacks
by . . . the_metal mining in-
dustry who have been trying
for years to weaken or destroy

this union.”

Italy

The Federazione Impiegati
Operai Metallurgici of Italy have
written to U.S. Ambassador
Frederick Reinhardt: “The See-
retariat of the FIOM has just
learned of the unheard-of judi-
cial persecution . . . of them-
ternational Union of Mine, Mill
and Smelter Workers . . .

“The Secretariat, in the name
of the metal workers who are
members of our union‘, raises
its voice to protest against all
such persecutions which brutally

<f\.

 

violate union freedom and the
most elementary principles of
the rights of man, and expresses
to the International Union of
Mine, Mill and Smelter Workers
the complete solidarity of the
Italian metal workers.”

Rumania

The presidium of the central
committee of the Mine and Elec-
trical Workers Union of Ru-
mania have written to Mine-
Mill’s officers: “On behalf of
the working people organized in
trade unions of mine and elec-
trical powerpindustry of the
Rumanian People’s Republic,
we express our solidarity with
the struggle waged by-the
American mine," mill and
smelter workers for defending
their rights to organize in trade
unions and wish (you) success
in your just struggle.”

Labor gives

llo-bias pledge

WASHINGTON — President
Kennedy won a no-discrimina-
tion pledge from AFL-CIO lead-
ers June 13 and then sought
their approval for a five-point
program designed to provide
more jobs for Negroes.

Meeting at the White House
for about two hours with 300
labor leaders, the President
heard them promise to wipe out
job discrimination—and to see
that the pledge was honored
down through their local unions.

James Carey, AFL-CIO vice
president and president of the
International Brotherhood of
Electrical Workers, said the

pledge applied to the building V

trades unions as well as to all

others. The buildingtrades espe- -
cially have been accused of dis- .
’ crimination against Negroes.

The five-point program in-
cluded creation of a top-level
labor anti-discrimination com-
mittee, union backing for bi-
racial municipal councils, sup-
port for a massive voter regis-
tration drive, the placing of
more Negroes in responsible
union positions, and union sup-
port for the administration’s
entire social welfare program
in Congress.

Kennedy claimed his legisla- .

tive program had been endan-
gered. by his stand on civil
rights. - . .

Goldwater, Williams clash   ,  

In ‘right—to—work’ debate

WASHINGTON-—A University of Vermont professor’s investigation of ' the operation of state

_ ‘Sen. Harrison Williams (D-N.J,).

Williams, in introducing a bill

‘_ torepeal the section of__the Taft-g
Hartley Act which e'i1a’blesTstat"es ‘
v to enact the “rig_ht_-.to_-work”
5- laws, cited Professor" Milton J.
' Nadworny’s research which ap-

Deared in the Publication of the -p sevéfal of the. State ﬁght_t0_,

work laws are getting second _

New York University Institute
of Economic Affairs.

Nadworny pointed out that in

' states which had adopted laws

banning the closed shop “both
hourly manufacturing wages and

‘ per capita income have been

falling farther_ and farther be-

= _ hind the national averages.”

Goldwater said he would not

. challenge Nadworny’s integrity,

but he accused the professor of
manipulating statistics. Worker
income in “right-to-work” states
has risen 32 per cent, says
Goldwater, as against only 20
per cent on the national aver-
age.

But, said Goldwater, such sta-
tistics are not the most impor-

- tant ‘measure of the value of

“right-to-work” laws. “The most
important yardstick,” he said,
“is the measurement of indi-
vidual freedom.”

When Williams argued that
non-union members were bene-
fitting from collective bargain-
ing agreements without paying
their share of the cost of bar-

f gaining, the Arizona Republican

countered that the “free rider”

’ argument is a “straw man.”

“Any man who considers that
he benefits from the union’s ac-
tivities,” said Goldwater, “cer-
tainly ought to pay. Those who
do not think so should not be
forced to pay. They are not free
riders. They are captive pas-
sengers.”

Williams, however, charged
that Goldwater had used “false
and misleading arguments.” In-
dividual freedom, he said in a

speech the following day to the '

New Jersey AFL-CIO, was not

‘the issue, as Goldwater had
_ maintained. The ‘real issue is

freedom to bargain collectively.

“It is my conviction,” stated '

Williams, “that the_ _righto-to

, work laws constitute one of the
. greatest possible dangers now ’

facing such freedom.

' “right,-to-work” laws has .caused a row  the" Senate . between Sen.

Barry Goldwater (R-Arizg.) . and

however, sap the strength of

-. Meanwhile, stung. by .Profe‘s-xv

sor . Nadworny’s conclusions,

looks frorn their sponsors_. A
In Georgia, Jim Montgomery,

- business and financial editorof

the Atlanta Constitution, the
state’s leading newspaper, cited

‘Nadworny’s figures which indi- ‘
- cate that in 1950 Georgia’s aver- .

age hourly manufacturing wage
was 39 centsbelow the national

average.’ Last year, he said, it V
A was '62‘ cents below the national

average. In 1950, per capita in-
come in the state was $474 be-
low U. S. average. The 1962 per
capita income trailed the na-
tional average by $643.

Said Montgomery, “That’s
progress? Or is it simply a

revelation of the severe impact

on Georgia of- a so-called ‘right-
to-work’ law designed to limit
wage (and therefore income)
increases?

“And just imagine how much
worse Georgia would show up
in comparison with U. S. aver-
ages excluding the ‘right-to-
work’ states.”

One of the claims usually
made by proponents of such

laws is that they would lure

into the state new industry seek-
ing escape from the “monopoly
power” of unions in the North-
east and West.

Says the Hutchinson (Kansas)
News, “It hasn’t worked out
that way . . . everyone is cry-_
ing that Kansas is missing the
boat so far as the nation’s in-
dustrial expansion is con-
cerned.”

Columnist F. L. Alder of the
Newton Kansan comments,
“The giant concerns employing
thousands of laborers have
never been tempted by the right-
to-work bait. They have wel-
comed the cooperation of union
labor in the establishment of

working rules and the fixing of ~

pay schedules. They make bar-

a tougher time of it entirely on
their own.‘ -Most of them shun

a right-to-work, state as they
would a pest_ilence.”..

Packaged With Double Talk

Just how far these competitive pressures can push toward ir-
rationality in packaging is illustrated by another communication
from a manufacturer, this one from Colgate-Palmolive Ltd. A
consumer had complained of the great difficulty he had in trying
to figure out which of several sizes and deals on Colgate tooth-

-paste was the best buy. His complaint was forwarded to the com-

pany, and here is what a vice-president of Colgate had to say
about it: I ,
Your correspondent’s difficulty may be stated briefly as
follows:
1 Large tube 1-1/16 oz. plus 1 Family tube 5-11/16 oz.=
6% oz. for 98c. '
- versus

2 Giant tubes 2-"/s oz. each x 2:53/i oz. for 99c.

The Family size tube with its'5-11/16 oz. is much more eco-‘

nomical per ounce to the consumer than the Large or Giant size
because of the saving in cost of handling, filling and packaging.

It will be noted that 1 Family size (5-11/16 oz.) has almost double -

the volume of 2 Giant size (2-7/sx2=5-12/16 oz.). In other words,
1 Family size is only 1/16 oz. less than 2 Giant size. "

In the particular case under review by your correspondent we ’

are enabled to give the customer 6% oz. for 98c (because by far
the largest item in the combination is the moreeconomical Fam-
ily size of 5-1/16 oz.) whereas the 2 Giant size of 5-12/16 oz. costs
him 99c. V
Stating it another way: - -
2 Giant 5-12/16 oz. sell regularly for 65c each=1.30-.-—
22.61c per oz. ,
1 Family 5-11/16 oz. s ell s regularly for 98c=.98--17.23c
per oz. '
This saving we pass on to the customer who buys a Family
size ‘rather than a Giant size. .
Your correspondent states that “Large is the name given by
Colgate to its smallest size package.” A few years ago the Large
was our third largest size——we had small and we still have medium.

Therefor this consumer is incorrect in making the statement .

r quoted.'Neither the “small” or “medium” were in the combina-

tion to which he refers. We would like to add that the writer of
the letter should not be too severe on his pharmacist simply be-

‘ cause the latter flunked on his arithmetic and was-too busy to
-pursue thematter further. ’ . ‘~  . ‘ -. 7 r —- ‘

Pharmacists (like Albert Einstein the scientist who, it is re-
ported, failed ‘on the ‘simplest fractions) ‘have probably forgotten
more than the average citizen ever knew; furthermore, theirs’ is a

-most exacting profession. Your T correspondent would not appre-
- ciate it if his pharmacist,_distracted_by_ vulgar fractions, inadver-

tently filled your correspondent’s prescription with a poisonous
ingredient when the doctor specified a common item (for example
NaC1, table salt) which may have a similar chemical formula.

The conference grew out of a symposium

AGVA Votes Boycott

The American Guild of Variety Artists in its
convention in New York June 10 voted for an
immediate national boycottof entertainment cen-
ters that segregate either customers or employees.

AGVA’s president,
said the unanimous vote given the resolution

made it mandatory on the union’s national board ‘

to approve the boycott.
AGVA’s jurisdiction is in night clubs, hotel
supper clubs, and other places using vaudeville-

type live entertainment, exclusive of legitimate"

theaters and television. ;

The boycott resolution stated the union’s inten-

eliminate and ban the policy of segregation in

WASHINGTON——The civil rights crisis has produced no real changes in the power

By Russell R. Lasley

International Vice President
United Packinghouse Workers of America

ISTRICT DIRECTOR Charles Hayes, President Herman
Walker of Local 117, Indianapolis, and I were invited to ad-
dress a class of students at Tougaloo Christian College (nine miles
from Jackson, Miss.) and to visit areas such as Greenwood, Miss.
where voter registration drives are under way.

When we arrived at the Jackson airport, we were met by
James Foreman, Executive Director of the Student Nonviolent
Coordinating Committee, and two field secretaries. We at once
became the victims of Mississippi injustice.

The bus which was to transport us to Tougaloo College had
been impounded by the police and the driver thrown in jail. His
alleged crime was “transporting students to a training school for
demonstrations.” .

We were therefore obliged to rent cars for transportation.

As we arrived at Tougaloo, we were warmly received by the
faculty which is well integrated. As we reached the area of the

‘Science Building where the workshop was in session, we could

hear the inspirational singing of the student body.
In our talks we gave the background of labor’s strugglefor

- the right to organize, and its relation to the present struggles in
' the deep South. We also explained that segregation and discrimina-

tion had its roots deeply imbedded in the economics of this nation,
and that the power structures which oppose civil rights also oppose

H ‘ the rights of workers to a fair living wage. '"

‘k**

FTER leaving the school we were taken to an area in Jackson
completely surrounded by police. A group of high school

- students was in the Farrish St. Baptist Church planning a demon-

stration. Farrish Street is the main business street in the Negro

- Community. No cars were allowed by the police within a two

block" area on allsides of the church.
As we approached, a group of about 50 young people ranging

- from 7- to 18 years old came out of the church marching, singing,

and waving American flags. Two blocks away we saw what ap-

"peared to be a blue helmeted “army” with bright yellow night
«sticks. They formed a barricade from sidewalkto sidewalk and
" about 20 rows deep. Behind them were deputized men (white, of

- were trucks of all description, some foul with the stench of ,-

course) with. clubs, guns and no uniforms. Bringing up the rear

- garbage they usually hauled.

Groups of students began streaming from the church waving‘,

. ﬂags, and singing Freedom Songs in the refrain of gospel songs
'. and-spirituals. . - - -

.As they reached the police barricade they._.were loaded: into
the trucks and hauled off to jail.~This process continued until 450

- to 500 children had been so arrested.

. in the American Legion Hall that night. Later we departed for"-

We remained for a rally which was sponsored‘ by the NAACP

. Greenwood, Mississippi, the area in which. Emmett .Ti‘ll was

murdered and Jimmy Travis was recentlyashot.
E were privileged, _that night, to see Medgar Evers,._NAACP
Mississippi Field Secretary, now murdered for his leader-

. ship in the’ civil rights movement.

In Greenwood we met Rev. Tucker, a Methodist minister who

has so gallantly led the voter registration drive with SNCC in

LeF1ore County.’ . .

In Greenwood we met the Mississippi staff of SNCC and found
that they and the NAACP have done a fine job of educating farm
families, as well as city folk, on how to register and vote. Rev.
Tucker told how he had been severely beaten as he took a group
of people to the registrar’s office.

Our experience taught us the value of the work being performed
and the imminent danger to those who do it. We saw men, women
and children ready to give their lives for the right to vote and a
fair share in the fruit of freedom . . . and Medgar Evers has made
that final sacrifice. .

Although our contribution was meager, we felt, at least, that
we as labor leaders had been identified with this historic move-
ment. -‘—From The Packinghouse Worker

Unions vs. Banks 

WASHINGTON (COPE)—-The next time someone tries to tell

you ‘unions are loaded with corruption, straighten him out with
the following information: , A
Financial institutions (banks, insurance companies, etc.) and

unions both are required to bond their officers for a percentage -

of the total amount of money they handle annually.
_In 1960,_f1nanc1al institutions paid premiums of $21.5 million.
Due to widespread embezzlement and fraud, bonding companies

. lost $17.1 million of this amount, or 71.4 per cent. - '

In the same year, unions paid $1.4 million in premiums, on
which bonding companies had to pay out only $104,000.

The above covers institutions. What about individuals? The
results again show that unions have a remarkably low incidence
of dishonesty among their leaders. Not so ‘with banks. The chart
below covers, for banks, the period January 1958 to June 1960; for
unions, the period covered is September 1959 to September 1962.

Number Indiv. Cases of Per Cent
Insured Fraud-Embezzlement
BANKS —————————— —: .............. ..14,000 1771 12.7%
UNIONS ........................ _-60,000 74 0.1%

The figures thus show that fraud or embezzlement occur on
the average in about one out of every eight banks annually.

But the union incidence is so low that the Surety Association
of America, representing the companies, cut surcharge premiums
in half for 122 national and international unions after two years of
experience under Landrum-Griffin.

John L. Holcome, who has administered the anti-corruption

V section of the Landrum-Griffin Act for nearly four years, said in

a recent San Francisco speech, “There simply is not the_ corrup-
tion one would expect after reading the reports of the McClellan
Committee hearings.” '

His Bureau of Labor Management Reports have found many

structure of this doddering congress.

Dixiecrats and their right wing Republican

allies remain committed to “tokenism”——to another 100 years of evolutionary changes.

But there is, however, a gathering atmosphere of expectancy and uncertainty on ,

Capitol Hill. The feeling grows
that a major North-South show-

down impends, especially since ‘

the President gives every indi-
cation that he will back his civil
rights program to the hilt. Dixie-
crats are prepared to fight, and
they not only know how to fight
but also have the tools. This
session could run on and on,
until Thanksgiving or later.

The Hard Challenge
ls Ahead

President Kennedy appears to

be moving decisively against
discrimination and segregation.
His nationwide TV address was
a frank, forthright appeal for ac-_
tion. His legislative proposals,
already sent to Congress, are
meaningful. His careful efforts
to forge a bipartisan coalition
within Congressional ranks are
the key to a successful legisla-
tive campaign. All these steps
make for a good start, .but the
hard test of the President’s
commitment will come when the

Congressional battle gets under- , .' "7"
wayfor real. The problem will ‘

. be to overcome the House Rules _
Committee, a massive Senate - ’ '

filibuster, and other obstacles.

Effectiveleadership to mobilize -
the people and the civil rights 4
forces on The Hill will be de-.

manded. That is_ the challenge
JFK must meet."

They'll Take
One ‘ Year. New

-Congressional supporters of
the bracero program haven’t

’ given up by a long shot. They
' still hope to get out from under

the surprising defeat they suf-
fered when the House voted
down any further extension of
the law authorizing the recruit-
ment of Mexican farm workers.
The pitch now is for the one
year extension originally pro-
posed by the Administration but
arrogantly rejected by grower
stooges in favor of a two-year
extension. Unless reconsidera-
tion can be maneuvered, the
bracero program (PL 28-78) ex-

"pires at the end of this year.
Among those leading the fight
to kill the law—and keep it dead

—are Reps. Jeffrey Kohelan of
California and Spark Matsunaga
of Hawaii.

An Explosive Problem

Two Congressional Commit-
tees have launched extensive
studies of the problem of em-
ployment and unemployment.
One is a Senate labor subcom-
mitee chaired by Sen. Joe
Clark and the other a House
labor subcommittee chaired by
Rep. Elmer Holland. About the
most that can be ‘hoped for out
of these hearings are more facts
and possibly some support be-
hind the drive for a shorter

V workweek. Meanwhile, 18 out of

every 100 teenagers who wanted

' to work last month couldn’t find
,jobs.; The problem will be far
‘worse this month when three

million more youths come out
of school and start hunting for

;temporary employment. Teen-
age idleness, Labor Secretary

Wirtz has warned, may become

‘one of the most explosive prob-
’ lems in America’s history.

Prospects for revamping the
infamous McCarran‘-Walter Im-

Act are’ on the upgrade. The re-
cent death of Rep. Walter re-
moved one of« the worst road-

blocks. And now President Ken-

things, this means the door may

Morse bills (S. 1500 and 1501)

. on denaturalization and deporta-

tion. Both measures are urgent-
ly needed to protect aliens and
naturalized citizens. Companion
bills (HR 6831, 6832, 6833, and
6834) have been introduced in
the House by Reps. Matsunaga
and Gill.

Equal Wage Law Signed

Legislation providing equal
pay for women has been signed
into law by the President. The
law took 16 years to clear Con-
gress. It goes into effect within
a year; however, it may take
two years where collectiveibar-
gaining agreements are in-
Volved. The Act covers the 27
million workers protected_. by
minimum wage law provisions.
Labor Department officials esti-
mate that some 8 million women
will be affected.

They Showed Their Hands

The House Ways and Means
Committee came within a hair
of approving a medicare bill—a
phoney Republican substitute. It
was to be tied to the tax bill on
which the Committee is present-
ly laboring. Last minute pres-
sure by Chairman Wilbur Mills
blocked this maneuver. In pull-
ing this stunt, Republicans ex-
posed a fact of considerable
importance: they aren’t nearly

so complacent about the politi- -

cal impact of medical care as
they pretend publicly. So it
might be timely to get off letters
to all Representatives, asking
that they sign the discharge
petition to bring’ the King-An-
derson -bill on the House floor
for a vote.

 

THE MINE-MILIL. -umon  

2 July“. 51952; ,

   protests appointment
-Of Steel representative Storey

The following letter hasibeen sent by Canadian Mine-Mill President Ken Smith to

Ontario Labdur Minister H. Leslie Rowntree:

Honourable Sir:

We were shocked by a press report in the Toronto Telegram
of June 5th to the effect that you have appointed Dwight Storey,
Legislative Director of the United Steelworkers of America, as a
member of the Ontario Labour Relations Board.

This appointment of Mr. Storey will also shock large sections
of the Ontario trade union movement, who had been expecting
you to take steps to remove the shadows of mistrust now shrouding
the O. L. R. B. The appointment of Mr. Storey smacks of a politi-
cal deal engineered betwen the top Steel leadership and the gov-
ernment for back door election support. -

The people of Ontario willremember that Mr. Storey represent-
ed the United Steelworkers of America in the O. L. R. B. hearing
as an affront to the many unions in this province who have been
raided by the United Steelworkers of America.

What also is important is that in many 0. L. R. B. hearings,
involving Steel’s raiding practices, one of the representatives of
the United Steelworkers has been this same Dwight Storey.

The peopl of Ontario will remember that Mr. Storey represent-
ed the United Steelworkers of Amrica in the O. L. R. B. hearing
involving forgeries in the cards submitted by Steel in the Falcon-
bridge application. He was also involved, representing Steel, in
the hearings and the proceedings regarding the disputed case for
bargaining rights at the International Nickel Company of Canada.

Mr. Storey’s history casts doubt on his ability to function im-
partially on the O. L. R. B. Mr. Storey, while an officer and re-
ceiving his salary from the members of the United Electrical,
Radio & Machine Workers of America, in St. Catherines (English

' Electric), conspired with the United Steelworkers of America in a

raid against his local union, and repudiated by his action his sworn
oath of office.

The appointment of Mr. Storey not only places in disrepute
the decisions of any panel of the O. L. R. B. he happens to be
sitting on, but also places in disrepute all decisions of the O. L. R.
B. as a whole. Decency demands that you reconsider this appoint-
ment and we respectfully call upon you to act without delay.

In any event, Mr. Minister, our Union will take all necessary
steps to prevent Mr. Storey from sitting on any 0. L. R. B. hear-
ings involving our Union. We expect that other unions who have
been and are being raided by Steel will take similar steps to pro-

_ some

 

tect their rights before the O. L. R. B.

Respectfully yours,
K. A. Smith (signed)
President.

whole. —

Most of the firms not men-

tioned have agreed to sign any -

agreement the union and the
struck companies, of which
Boyles and Connors are the
largest, should sign. A Concilia-

tion Board report proposed a -
“no increase”

settlement.

Only two votes among all
were against strike. Union de-
mands are for a 30-cent wage
increase for runners, and 25
cents for helpers.

The strike was started at
noon May 8, when picket lines
were established, atall affect-
ed plants and is province-wide.

Remac Strikers Solid

REMAC, B. C.—Ninety-two members of Nelson & I

District Mine and Mill Workers Union Local 901 are

approaching their third month on strike against Reeves  _
MacDonald Mines with their spirits high and their gar-'

 

 

dens tended. I

The latest strike bulletin re-
ceived in the International of-
fice reports that rumors had
circulated to the effect that the
company houses——in which all of
the strikers live—-had been sold
and that many families were

‘moving out.

“Not so!” says the bulletin,
“no one has moved anywhere.”

“Right now more is being
done than when we were work-
ing. Now that the work-sleep-
eat routine has been given a
Mickey Finn, everyone is glad
to be able to plant grass, repair
fences, and, a m o n g other
things, hoe the garden properly
for a change.”

The L0 cal has obtained a
wholesale license and is selling
groceries at cost. Some of the
miners ‘have found temporary
employment and -are contribut-
ing generously to the strike
fund, as are neighboring Mine-
Mill locals in Trail, Riondel,
Kimberley, and ‘elsewhere.

The picket‘ line has b e e n
maintained with o u t incident.
“The only clash so far,” reports
the Bulletin, “has been the
clang of horseshoes.” '

As reported in the last issue
of The Union, issues in the
strike revolve ‘around the re-
fusal of the company to imple-
ment the findings of the major-
ity of a conciliation board. The
proposed settlement was for a
one year agreement with 71/2c
per hour wage increase plus a
21/2c payment by the company
into a severance pay plan and
three weeks vacation after five
years service. '

Also involved in the strike, al-

though not as a direct matter of . - if

dispute, is the fact that the
same company mining proper-
ty that straddles the Canadian-

U.S. border pays its men on the I

U.S. side of the line as much as

40c per hour more for identical A 

work. .

Sudbury M-M members have

By Buddy De Vito
Local 598. Sudbury

This year the members of
Local 598 in Sudbury are spend-
ing their weekends and days off
at their fine holiday camp a
short six miles from Sudbury.

As in years past, the chil-
dren of local members and

sters will bespending a week or
two in the fine children’s camp
which is a part of the camp
setup.

The first decision to embark
on the ambitious camp project
for the local was made in 1950.
In 1951, $20,000 was spent ac-
quiring property on beautiful

. Lake Richard. The members of

Local 598 had been interested in
such a project for years in the
hope of providing the general
membership and their families
with a place to rest and relax
in the sun away from the dirt,
smoke and noiseof their work-
ing places in the mines and
smelters.

The site purchased by the 10-
cal consists of 60 acres of level
ground and about 100 acres of
natural wooded area.

In 1951 the first steps were
taken to lay out the site and ex-
perts from the government de-
partment of education assisted
in the planning of the camp and
recreation areas. That year saw
the camp first used by children
on a day basis with buses pick-

' ing the children up in the morn-

ing and returning them home at
night after a day of fun and

I  activity.

In the years since close to
$200,000 has been put into the
camp with the final result being

- a development that would do

-credit to any city in North
-America. Indeed, the city of

Sudbury, with a population of -

80,000 , has little to compare

_ with the facilities at the Mine-

Mill’ ca-mp.
’ The camp now consists of a

-;

underprivileged young-

modern dining lodge complete
with facilities to feed 150 per-
sons at a time, cottages which
can accommodate 100 young-
sters and an activity room for
handicrafts and hobby work.

The union has been sponsor-
ing camping for the children
for a number of years now, with
as many as 1,500 using the fa-
cilities in a single year. A com-
petent camp director has been
hired by the local and a number
of counsellors and assistants
give supervision and direction
to the youngsters.

The activities include canoe-
ing, swimming lessons, hiking,
life saving and water safety,
handicraft, archery, tenting and
bushwork.

Aside from the facilities for
camping the Mine-Mill camp
offers unlimited recreational op-
portunities to the membership.
Thousands of yards of fine sand
spread on the lake front provide
safe, clean swimming and hun-
dreds of picnic tables in the
grassed fringes of the lake are
busy and full all summer.

In one year alone the mem-
bership planted 15,000 trees in
the area and sowed hundreds of
pounds of grass to give an or-
derly, developed beauty to the
camp which blends well with
the natural grandeur of the
Northern Ontario countryside.

As the summer days get
warmer the camp is constantly
in use. The children’s camp
starts July 1. On Saturdays and
Sundays and on their days off
thousands of members flock to
the lake for picnics and swim-
ming and to find their “place in
the sun.”

Numerous community organi-
zations are using the camp fa-

cilities for picnics—a recent '

weekend saw three church
groups, three school organiza-
tions, and the local institute for
the blind holding picnics in the

camp area. The city ball league

is using the fields at the camp
for -games and practices and
members of the localfind the
camp grounds ideal for football
games and grass bowling.

This fine example of worker
cooperation, along with the five
union halls in and around Sud-
bury stands as a perpetual mon-
ument to the hopes and dreams
of the old members of Local
598. The terrible steel raid in
Sudbury has only temporarily
diverted the plans of the mem-
bership. '

There is no. doubt, however,
of the pride the Mine—Mill mem-
bers have in their camp and
the other accomplishments ‘in
Sudbury. This is why they have
beaten off the attack of the
Steel brass and it is this pride
and spirit which will in the long
run cause the total defeat of
Steel raiding.

ANACONDA plans to spend $80-$l00 million on this mine at Chuquicamata and another at El Salvador, both in Chile,
if it can get a favorable tax deal from the Chilean government. See "lndustry Notes," below.

SILVER PRICE has risen steadily since U. S. Treasury halted
sales of free silver stocks at about 911/2 cents per ounce in Novem-
ber 1961. Price recently has been above $1.25 per ounce. This has
meant big increase in profits of silver mines. Galena Mine in
Northern Idaho, for example, had operating profit of $1,172,096 in
1961, $1,667,556 in 1961, and $2,329,040 in 1962. Profit this year Will
be much larger than in 1962. These profits are split between Calla-
han Mining Company, the owner, and American Smelting and
Refining Company which leases the Galena.

Sunshine Mining Co., largest U. S. silver producer, also in’

Northern. Idaho, had net profits three times as large in second
quarter this year as in same period in 1962.

Long dormant western silver mining districts are beginning
to show signs of life with pickup in silver price. In the old Wood-
river district near Bellvue, Idaho, Federal Resources Corp., here-
tofore a uranium producer, is reopening the Silver Star, Queens
and Minnie Moore silver mines and investing an estimated $750,000
in a 250—ton per day mill.

OFF AGAIN-—ON AGAIN investment plans of big U. _S. copper
companies in Chile have finally shaken down to less than half the
$318 million investment program under consideration by Anaconda
Company and Kennecott Copper Corp, last year. Plans to invest
the larger sum in expansion of copper production in Chile were
dropped after the Chilean Congress balked at a proposal to freeze
then existing taxes on copper operations for -a 20-year period.
Instead, surtaxes of 5 percent and 8 percent were slapped on top
of basic income taxes of copper companies. Shortly thereafter both

companies announced plans for substantial expansion of copper-

production in the U. 5. But now Anaconda and Kennecott plan to
go -ahead on a much smaller scale if the Chilean Congress approves
Chilean government proposals to guarantee stable taxes on copper
companies in the future. Depending on this action, Anaconda is

reported ready to invest $80 to $100 million at its two large Chilean '

mines. over a period. of years. Kennecott is reported to be thinking
of new investment in expanded Chilean production amounting to
_some_$50 million. 1 ' ‘ ’ «

indefinitely. Originally an underground copper mine, the property
was converted to pyrite mining when copper reserves were ex-
hausted a few years ago. Shutdown of pyrite mining has been in
the cards for several months because 7 drops in the price of natural
sulphur have made mining and roasting of pyrite for sulphur un-

would save more than 300 pounds. The nature of the material for

UNDERSEA METAL MINING is being studied at University
of California and at Scripps Institute of Oceanography. Chunks
ranking from potato size to three feet in diameter, called nodules,
lie in great quantities on the ocean floor one mile deep in the
Central Pacific. Mineral content typically is 20 per cent man-
ganese, 15 per "cent iron, and lesser amounts of nickel, cobalt and
One mining method under consideration is by huge
pumps, which would “vacuum clean” the ocean floor. Sediment on
the ocean floor also contains huge quantities of phosphorus, copper,
aluminum and other minerals. Costs of deep sea mining are
thought to be too high at presentk to bek economically justifiable.

ZINC PRODUCERS raised price of higher grades of zinc_ by
Mi cent last month and announced that price ‘discounting, wide-
spread for many months, would be discontinued. American Metal
Climax raised price of Prime Western zinc to 12 cents, later
backed down to 111/2 cents when other producers did not follow
suit.

The report on a reinspection

earlier this year of the Inspira-
tion Christmas Mine at Christ-
mas,’ Arizona, notes the follow-
ing mine locations inadequately
ventilated because tubing was
too far from the work area to be
effective: 14-26 drift,’ 14-33 drift,
14.-8 drift, 14-2 pillar area, 16-3

or periods he was disabled

from working by reason of his

dermatitis condition.”

The case started last Septem-A’,
ber, when Melanson broke out

in a rash after using an Ammex ~_
mixture while working at Keno _ .

Hill. He was taken to -May

Y. T. General Hospital Septem-'-1' A
ber 12-15, returned to camp, .

still under treatment, and was-
finally sent out to Edmonton
University Hospital. The doctor

at theimine did not believe the I

rash was caused by the Ammex,
so some confusion resulted
that time. ‘

A compensation c 1 a i m was
filed in Edmonton and Melanson
returned to work on December
10, 1962. On December 17, he
again _used Ammex and again
broke out in a severe rash, and
was again hospitalized at Mayo
on December 20 and was re-
leased from the hospital.on De-
cember 31, not quite cleared up.

At 11 a.m. on December 31,
the mine doctor applied a
“patch” test using undiluted
Ammex. Melanson again broke

out in a rash and was again hos- A

pitalized on January 1, 1963.
The Mine doctor contended to
the Union Committee that, as
the skin immediately in. contact
with the Ammex had not broken
out, he did not think the Ammex
was the cause; however,*he was
giving the patient the benefit of _
the doubt and was recommend-

ing that Melanson be sent out too -

consult a dermatologist. The use ,

of about 31/2 lbs. of a steroid '

at one point during the treat-
ment resulted in a mental upset
and Melanson was transferred
to the Essondale Mental'Hospi-
tal. 3

With proper treatment this up-
set very quickly subsided and
the District Officers and‘ Local
Union Officers who were in Van-
couver for the District Conven-
tion discussed the case and it

" was decided to ask Melanson if

he would agree to remtainiat Eds-J
sondale ‘untila further test could
be made. Melanson agreed to
this and intsorderatotbe sure of
the material, a sample of Am-
mex was secured from the B. C.
Workmen’s Compensation Board
and delivered to Dr. Hennelly,

by Les Walker, Coim-p‘en"‘satior1- .

Officer. Dr. Satanove," skin spe-~
cialist of New Westminster and
consultant at the hospital at Es.-
sondale, was called in (and after
waiting" until all indications of
rash‘ ‘had subsided, a’g'a‘in ap-.'
plied the “patch” 'test.‘After a
ten, day ‘period in-which all le-

sions had_ disappeared and all ,‘
medication had been suspe‘ndedJ:f.;,

the rash again made its appear
ance "and Dr. Satanove, in his

- report stated “In View of the 
' present episode as well as the

past history it is my opinion

that this man has developedan-L .
acute sensitization reaction to .

this preparation Ammex.”

The Insurer, on receiving this
report, contended that it had not
been "a “controlled” test_ and

i asked that the workman be sent
to Edmonton fora further “coi1- ,_

trolled” test. To Dr. Satanove’s
credit, hejvigorously’ resisted

i this proposition, stating in no

uncertain “terms that the man
had already voluntarily submit-
ted to two. “p_atch’7 tests and to
request a further“ test was posi-
tively inhuman. The request was .
withdrawn. 3 -
The Union insisted that the

. m a t t e r. be submitted to the

Referee without further delay
and this'wa's done. _ '
The decision of the Referee
was, as quoted previously, that
Melanson was disabled by a
condition which arose out of and

, during his employment.
