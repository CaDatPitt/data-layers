T TAKE HOWARD OUT OF THE NATIONAL
STUDENT FEDERATION

At the same time the National Student League was meeting at Howard
University, in Washington, another student group, the National Student Fed-
eration of America, was holding its sessions at the aristocratic Mayﬂower-
Hotel. The difference between the National «Student League and the National
Student Federation was so marked that even the conserva.ti‘ve press was called
upon to comment.

The National Student Federation has stamped itself as a jim-crow organi-
zation. On what basis will it now appeal to Negro students‘? On what
grounds can Howard now justify its continued membership in an organization
which discriminates against its Negro student members‘? The students of How-
ard University deserve an answer to these questions. The National Student
League demands an answer.

Two Howard University delegates to the conference of the National Stu-
dent Federation were asked from the ﬂoor at an informal dance given by the
Federation. They were refused tickets to a luncheon given by the F'eder.ation.
Discrimination seemed the only program of the NlSIFA. Certainly we have
heard of no program or anything faintly resembling a program upon which the
NSFA justiﬁes its existence. It will be pointed out that the Federation did
admit the Negro delegates to their formal ball. This is true, but under what
circumstances? Only after the leadership of the National Student Federation
had received word that a united front demonstration, initiated by the National
Student League, was about to take place outside of the hotel where they were
to hold_ their dance. Yes, they admitted them, but only after the leadership
of the Federation had learned that the Howard delegates were militant and
intended to force the situation to an issue. Yes, only after the question had
been raised from the ﬂoor and a strong bloc of members of the National Stu-
dent Federation, who are members of the National Student League or sympa-

' thetic to its purposes, showed that they were prepared to force the convention

to take a deﬁnite stand on the issue.

It is signiﬁcant that the question was not permitted discussion by the
membership. It was settled by the leadership after a hurried whispered con-
ference on the platform. Why didn’t they allow the membership to discuss it
from the ﬂoor? The answer, we think, is simple. They knew and everyone
else knows that had the question been settled from the ﬂoor the result would
have been different. The Negro delegates would not have been permitted to
attend the ball. The majority sentiment was against. the attendance of the
Negroes. ~Artful demagogues that they are, Lang and M.arcus——the two mag-
niﬁcoes of the F'ederation, only the Southern delegation showed its- true feel-
inlalgs. When the Howard delegates entered the ballroom they withdrew from
t e ﬂoor.

We learn that this is not the first time the National Student Federation
has acceded to jim-drow policies. Last year they made it impossible for any
Negro delegates to attend their conference, which was held in Louisiana. Below
is a transcript of correspondence received by Edward A, Rodriguez, a More-
house College student, who was elected to represent Mbrehouse at the confer-
ence:

 

 

  
  

‘Dear Sir: I received your letter this morning stating your in-
 L _ tions of attending the eighth annual convention of the National
‘tudent Federation of America. I am extremely sorry that all the
hotels in New Orleans will make no provisions to house Negro dele-
gate. I have investigated the matter thoroughly and made every at-
tempt to iron out the diiﬁculty. Not only is this the case, but the

‘g Roosevelt Hotel, where all the meetings are to be held, will not allo

Negroes to attend meetings or have meetings at the hotel. -

“I realize that this is directly opposed to all policies of the
NSFA and I have made attempts to surmount the difficulty, but have
been unsuccessful. ‘

“Since it will be impossible for you to attend this congress, I will
forward you all minutes of the meetings.

“I hope you will understand that this is entirely a result of the
location of the congress and in no way connected with the NS'F'A.

“Yours truly,
' . “C. B. ODOM,

“Chairman, Ehigh-th Anrnual Congress, NSFA.”

“Dear Sir: Since receiving your recent letter, I have been to see
Mr. Seymour Weiss, manager of the Roosevelt Hotel, to ascertain
again what the position of the hotel would be toward a colored dele-
gate. He stated that you would be allowed to attend all the meetings
here, but that it would be impossible for you to have your meals at
the hotel, attend any soci.a.l functions, use any elevator other than the
servants’, and that you would not be granted the privilege of the
lobby. I ,
, “When Tulane was selected for the congress ’s location it was
neglected to take this sort of situation into consideration, which has
turned out to be very unfortunate.

“I am extremely sorry that all parties concerned have been con-A
siderably embarrassed, and only ask that you use your discretion with
the entire situation and assure you that if you see ﬁt to attend that I
will do all I can to make everything as agreeable as possible under the

V existing circumstances.
“ Sincerely yours,
“FRANCIS NEMECK.”

A_ telegram was later sent telling Rodriguez not to come.

This was the NSFA in 1932. .1933 saw no change in attitude. The neces-
sity of calling off their convention or changing their meeting place in view of
the fact that a part of their delegates were going to be discriminated against
never seemed to have entered their mind.

(What they did was to bow to this: discriminatory policy and advise their
Negro delegates to accept it. Never was there the slightest suggestion of put-
ting up a ﬁght to compel the hotel to admit Nlegro students on a basis of
equality. ‘ —

[Does Howard belong with these spineless, jim—crow jellyﬁsh who lack even
the sincerity to say to Negro students: “We do not want you. Anything we
might do is simply an empty gesture,” No, Howard University belongs under
the banner of the National Student League, which raises as its slogan and
carries through into action: “Equal rights for Negro students and mass vio1a~
tion of jim-crow laws and practices.”

  
  

 

 

-Delegates to the National Student League Convention met thy
attitude of Washington in a militant and ﬁghting spirit and none R
that it had its effect. A delegation was refused lodging in a Washingt‘ . 
because the-re were Negro students among them. As a. protest the students
slept in the waiting room of the railway station, By organizing a large dele-
gation of students they forced two restaurants on Connecticut Avenue to allow
Negro students to eat there. Only if segregation and discrimination are met
with the militant resistance of the masses will they be abolished. No one is
so asinine as to advocate acquiescence, as in the case of the N"SlFA, as a means
of abolishing jim-crowism.

  
    
    
 
 

The NISFA barred the Negro delegates from their social functions. The
National Student League went to additional trouble and expense in order to
have a dance at which white and N’e-gro students could attend. This was done
in spite of the opposition of the Faculty -Committee on ‘Student Activities at
Howard University. This would seem to indicate where Howard belongs, cal-
culated slanders of the Af¢o-AmeW"cam- and other enemies of student unity not-
withstanding.

 
 
  
 
  
 
 
   
   
   
  
    
  
   

We quote this from an editorial in the H1’-lltop, student paper at Howard
"University, December 19: “All he (the Negro student) asks if he joins an
organization is merely to be-come a part of the organization and rise as high
as his ability and intellect will allow him.”

Certainly in view of this attitude, the H'i.l'ltop.and its editor, Kenneth
Clark, will share our view that -Howard has no place in the NSFLA. It does
not fulﬁll the conditions they themselves outline.

The Af'ro~A.merioa~n and a large number of students have interpreted the
action of the National Student Federation of America in voting to hold their
conference next year at Boston and to avoid jim-crow cities in the future as
being favorable, of constituting for them a viutory over prejudice. What the ’
careful person will see is that the NSFA has simply proved its inherent coward- 
ice. They have removed their convention to Boston and intend to hold their "
conventions only in those cities where jim-crow practices. do not exist. This is
plainly an avoidance of the issue. It is more than that; it is a determination
to keep from meeting the issue squarely, We propose to the NSFA'this: That
if they really are sincere, they take their convention to a jim-crow city and
there send up a militant protest; that they wage a ﬁght to secure equal rights
for their Negro delegates. They had two opportunities. They failed both
times.

Their constitution calls for the equal treatment of Negroes. Contrary to
the views expressed by some, we do not believe that these words on paper can
be relied on. We know that they have not been carried out in the past. The
past is a. fair instrument of measure for the future.

We call upon the Hilltop, the Student Council, and“the student body of
Howard University_~t0 take Howard out of the National Student Federation.
We urge that they consider the program of concrete activity of the National
-Student League. We ask that they investigate our past work, especially our
long history of struggle against discrimination of Negro students. We ask
that 011 the basis of their ﬁndings they join us in a. united student movement
for the solving of student problemst Come with us! Together we a.re a force.
Divided—the future for American students is bleak indeed. Again we say:
TAKE HOWARD OUT OF THE‘ NATIONAL STUDEN T FEDERATION.
