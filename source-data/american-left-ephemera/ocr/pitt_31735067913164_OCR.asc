Local 904-Stauffer Agreement  
Has Good Wage 8; ther Gains

MELROSE, M0nt.—-Members of Mine-Mill Local 904 ratified at a special meeting
on Sept. 8 a new three-year contract :a_gree:r-nent with the Stauffer Chemical Company
which provides, in addition to substant-ial wage gains, vastly improved health and wel-
fare coverage and great gains in the area of pensions. '

The settlement, reached on Sept. 2, covers 111 workers.

Across-the-board wage hikes of five cents, five cents, and 71/; cents were won for
the three vears of the contract. In addition, contract miners received, effective Sept.

All slushermen and motor-‘men
won an additional 68 cents per
day. hike, raising their daily
guaranteed wages from $20.11 to
$20.79.

Seventy pe-rcent of the work-
ers fall in these categories.

Great Victory for

“October. ms

 Action Taken on Voice
Vote on Thurs., Sept. 2

WASHINGTON, D.C.—On Sept. 2, the U. S. House of
Representatives passed on _a voice vote an amended ver-
sion of the Johnson adm1n1strat1on’s federal mine safety

J

bill, H. R. 8989, and sent the measure to the Senate. Only
e Congressman, Laurence J. Burton (R-Utah), spoke
Q -ainst the bill during the floor debate.

V House passage of the bill——the first such proposal
covering workers in metal and mineral mines and mills
to receive approval by either Congressional chamber—
marks a giant step in the 15-year effort by Mine-Mill to
achieve meaningful federal safety standards in the non-
ferrous metals industry. Floor discussion on the measure
indicated that members of the House now agree with the
.union’s long-standing position that federal action in this
field can substantiallly lower the needless high toll of in-

juries and deaths.

The fact that no roll-call vote was necessary shows

' the extentof that agreement.

. Key to the support developed for the billfrom mem-
bers of both parties in the House was._ the weeklong
series of hearings held in May before a mne-man Select

Subcommittee on Labor. The

 Udall Report on- safety condi-
‘ _tions in the. nation's -metal and_

mineral mines and mills, which
was the result of the Mine-Mill-
sponsored; study bill passed by
Congress in 1961, also was ex-
tensively «quoted from during
the debate on H.R. 8989. ’

Hearings Convincing

Pointing out that he was in-
clined to oppose the federal

 -government's stepping into new

areas, Rep. Albert H. Quie of

1 Minnesota, ranking Republican

on the Subcommittee on Labor,
told the House that at the begin-

‘hing of the hearings ~,“my nat-

ural reaction . . . was to oppose
this legislation.” .“However,"
he continued, “going over the

testimony, I felt that the study

that was made under the au-
thority of the Department of the
Interior showed that it had been
adequately proved that some
uniform standards were needed,
and in some states an improve-
ment in inspection was needed.”

“In the course of the hear-

(Rep.-Minn.)

ings," said Quie, declaring his

support for the ‘bill, “I came to

the conclusion that we needed

a bill of the nature of the pend-» -»

ing measure.”

Senate Schedule

by Sen. Pat McNamara (D-
Mich.), ‘of the Committee on
Labor and Public Welfare, the
measure could run into stiffer
opposition in the upper chamber.

Some of the chief proponents
of mine. safety, therefore, are
urging that additional. hearings
on the subject be held on the
Senate side in order to more'ef-
fectively counter any - objections
to the bill that might arise. Such
hearings are expected to be
scheduled for soon after Con-
gress reconvenes in January.

among those who intro-

I know that the Mine, Mill

counted on to press for this
objective.

I am personally grateful

miners unions in my con-
gressional district — at the
mining centers of Christ-

Hayden, and Humboldt——_
- for strengthening my own

understanding of the prob-
lem of mine safety.

It was paticularly pleas-

Mr. Leo Terrell, interna-

Mine-Mill. Mr. Terrell hap-

pens to be a personal friend ¢

of many years standing. In
fact, he comes from my
hometown of Miami, Ariz.
He is completely dedicated
to the welfare and produc-

and is thoroughly knowl-

No Harmful Amendments

The House Education and La-
bor Committee and the House
itself agreed to several amend-
ments to H.R. 8989 proposed by

.Rep. Wayne Aspinall (D-Colo.),

chairman of the powerful Inte-
rior. and Insular Affairs Com-
mittee. The- changes would al-
loW'the states more time to sub-
mit their own safety plans to
the Secretary of the Interior and
would provide for judicial re-
view of the Secretary's action

 

in disapproving any state plan,
but do not attack any of the
bill’s major provisions concerri-
ing coverage and enforcement.-

An earlier House vote on the.

bill, scheduled for July 19, was
postponed when Aspinall an-
nounced his 11th- hour intentions
to amend the measure, and it
was feared at that time that he
was out to severely weaken the
proposal ‘.
Althoughhe was critical 0

the Udall Report, the Colorado
Democrat wound up supporting
the bill on the floor. None of his
amendments hurt the bill and
one—a provision that “to the
maximum extent feasible” per.-
sons selected as federal mining
inspectors should have at least
five years practical mining ex;
perience—should serve ’ to in-
crease the effectiveness of safe}
ty inspections and enforcement.

Provisions of Bill

Covered by the bill are_ all

and _mineral mines and mills’,
and, in addition, quarries, sand
and gravel pits.‘ ' 5'

The federal health and safety ,

Reiniery Safely; Patten Pledges Support

The Mine-Mill Smelting and Refining Conference of District 5,
following House passage of the federal mine safety bill on Sept. 2,
began work for the introduction of a ‘bill calling for a federal
investigation of health and safety conditions in smelters and

refineries.

Representing locals in New Jersey, New York, and Maryland,
the conference initiated the circulation of petitions by stewards at
the various properties which will be submitted to the Congressional
delegations from those states. The result of such a federal study,
the petitions state, “should be laws establishing safety standards

to ensure the maximum protec-
tion to the life and health of
workers in our industry.”

Signatures are being obtained
from workers at the AS&R
plants in Perth Amboy, 1\I. J.,
and Baltimore, Md.; U.‘ S.
Metals and Refining at Carteret,

Staten Island; Barth Smelting

that such coverage was not pro-'

Petition Attacks Vague
octrinc of “Conspiracy”

On Sept. 20, the American Civil Liberties Union,
joined by eight national labor organizations, filed a peti-
tion with the U. S. Supreme Court in support of the six
remaining defendants- in the l\/line-’Vlill “conspiracy” case.
- U-rging the high court to review the case, in addition
to the ACLU, the country’s best-known» civil liberties or-
.ga.niza:tion, are the Amalgamated Clothing Workers. of
America, the Amalgamated Meat Cutters and Butcher
“lorluneu, the American Federation of "Teachers, the
International Ty pogra-phica.l Union, the National’ Farmers
Union, the Transport Workers. Union, the United Auto-
mobile Workers, and the United Packinghouse Workers.

The action, indicative of the broad support for the
defendants throughout the American labor movement
and around the country generally, was hailed by Mine-
Mill leaders. Attorneys for the six past and present union

officials had earlier, on Aug.
ZS, filed‘ a brief with the Supreme
Court asking that it review the
case.

challenges the constitutionality
of the non-Communist. affidavit

concept. of “conspiracy” on

Supreme Court review.

A. Philip Randolph, president
of the Brotherhood of Sleeping
Car Porters, said that “the use
of the doctrine of conspiracy’,
rather‘ than a speciﬁc charge,
. raises doubts that the
Government felt there was ade-
quate proof to sustain the sub-
stantive charges.” Brieﬂy re-
viewing, the history of the
lengthy case in his letter to the
Attorney G. en. er a 1 , Randolph.

pointed out that history “basil,

ernment. is exerting its great?‘
power not only to harass, but;

Two Editorials

With the case, _ho;wev.cr,, near-
ing‘ a climax, the country’s press
is showing‘ renewed interest. In.
an editorial’ on Sept. 2*? (re-
printed on this page), The Den-
ver Post, an influential‘ after-

tain area, calls upon the high
court. to hear the case—both in

fense.

“The case should be re-

~ “but, better still, it should be

Remaining defendants in the
case are Al Skinner, interna-

secretary - treasurer; Raymond
Dennis, District 4 board mem-
ber; Charles Wilson, interna-
tional representative; Harold
Sanderson, administrative as-
sistant; and-’ Maurice Travis,

Originally indicted in 1956.,
nine of lldefendents who stood

Que-s.’rions Plersisf in Mine-Mill Case

The Minge-Mill‘ case is still not settled, how"
ever, even though the conspiracy it deals w’
was "alleged to have begun Id‘ years ago. The
legal and constitutional issues» raised by the 
case led the American Civil Liberties Union,
eight, national labor unions. and the Nationa
Farmers Union to support the major argu-
ments of the defendants this week in an
amici curiae (friends of the court) brief to 1
United States Supreme Court. -

Because of the importance of these. issues,
we hope the Supreme Court will agree to take
the case. After so much. time. and ‘litigation,
it would be unfortxmate if the case were to
fade. away without a deﬁnitive ruling from the
nation's highest tribunal;

TWO developments in the nine years since
_' the indictments were handed’ down have
complicated‘ the task 'of sustaining the cori-
vict-ions on the chargesinvolved:

First, the key provision on which ll1E'.i[ldiCt'.-
mcnts were based (Section '9h of the 'l‘aftd~lart-
ley Act involving non-Communist afﬁdavits)
was repealed by Congress six years ago. in
1959-, the same year in which the defendants
were first convicted and before the trial began.

Second, the provision which  enact-
ed to replace Section 911 in our national labor-
management statute (Section 504’ of the Land-
rum Griffin Act), was declared unconstitutional
by the United States Supreme. Court in June
of this year. That substitute provision made it
unlawful for Communists to be union officers. __

In the decision. last June. (in  V. Brown}. .
several justices suggested that the Court was.
in effect. overruling an.‘ earlier decision in
which the o1d’Section 9b was held to be con-
stitutional. The implication was streng that
Section 9h might henceforth have to; be con-
sidered uncanstitutional;  “_

To send men: to jail on the basis of a statue -
tory provision which has been off the statute
books for six years, which now appears to
have been unconstitutional when it was on the
statute books and which was replaced by 1:.
kindred statutory provision which has. been
held to be unconstitutional’ seems‘ to us to. here
questionable business-.

‘. munist deception and Communist‘-dominate

EARLY nine years have passed since-
M officers and employes of the Inter-
national Union of Mine, Mill and Smel-

er Workers were indicted by a federal grand

ury for conspiring to defraud the federal gov-
rnment by filing false non-Communist affi-
avits under the Taft‘-Hartley Act.

Nine of the 14 were convicted in 1959', but

the convictions were reversed by the. Court of

ppeals in 1962, and‘ seven of the nine were
led again. the following year. In the second:

Voluntary contributions to the

crease. Most local unions are

MINEQMILL ORGANIZERS MEET ON SEPT. 4———the day after Steel’s terminationldate for submitting cards petvihontné II.
for an election .- at Falconbridge Nickel in Sudbury, Ontario. Preliminary figures released by the Labor Board lair;-3?.
in'th‘e month, showed that petition ‘to be well shy of the necessary 45 percent; These workers and many -o,ihe,r$Af;

knowing that their failure to do
so cripples their chances of
staving off defeat at the much
larger Inco properties in Sud-
bury when an election is held
there this year.

7,214 Cards

Final board hearings on Mine-
Mill’s application for an election
at ‘the huge International Nickel
Company operations were com-
pleted on Sept. 9 in Toronto.
Union officials are confident
that a vote at Inco will be or-
dered in the very near future,
since figures fro-m the Labor
Board show Mine-Mill as hav-
ing 7,214 application cards in a
bargaining unit of 14,569. This
is just a whisker under 50 per-
cent—-658 more names than the
45 percent required.

Steel, through its attorney,
has attempted in every way pos-
sible to prolong the Inco hear-
ings. Workers at the huge min-
ingand smelting complex, how-
ever, are anxious that the vote
be taken soon, realizing that
1965 is an ‘excellent year "for
bargaining and that Mine-Mill,
if elected, can bargain with the
company immediately. The
present Steel contract, on the
other hand, has another year to
run.

    

THESE AND MANY OTHER WORKERS FROM FALCON-
BRIDGE mines, plants, and services divisions were largely
instrumental in defeating the attempt by some 75 outside
organizers of the Steelworkers to secure enough cards for
a certification election.

Steel Fails at F-alconbrrid-ge,:; 
Inco Election Expected Soon

SUDBURY, Ont.-—All indications point, as this issue. of the Mine-Mill Union goes

to press, to failure by the United Steelworkers of America in their bid to achieve
. a certification vote at Falconbridge Nickel here. According to preliminary figures
released by the Ontario Labor Relations Board, Steel was 119 cards or five per-
cent short of the necessary 45 percent requirement for -the ordering of an electin.
At the conclusion of the final hearing on Steel’s application on Sept. 13, Local

598 President Nels Thibault congratulated the Falconbridge Workers and their farm-
ilies for “the tremendous job they performed in defense of their Mine-Mill Union.”
Steel, which brought some 75 outside organizers here for the attempted raid

at Falconbridge, desperately sought to make their application for a vote stand up,

‘-'4 .¢

At one point during the bear-
ings, a sharp exchange between
Steel lawyer John Osler and
Board Chairman G. W. [Reed
developed when the attorney
suggested that the Board had
not indicated any urgency in
moving the proceedings along
as rapidly as possible. “I think,
Mr. Osler,” replied Reed, “you
have exceeded the bounds be-
yond which Counsel should not
go in making such a sugges-
tion.” ’

Filed on May 11, the earliest
day possible under Canadian
labor statutes, the Mine-Mill pe-
tition has been _subjected to
months of painstaking investi-
gation, and nothing of any sub-
stance has been discovered to
invalidate the count which
shows that the workers deserve
a vote.

The failure by Steel to show
strength at Falconbridge is ex-
pected to severely hurt them at
Inco. “It would seem now,” said
Thibault, commenting on Steel’s
apparently invalid petition, “that
all obstacles which have divided
nickel workers at Falconbridge
and Inco will soon be removed.”

At the final hearing on Steel’s
application, Jacob Finkelman,

chairman of the Labor Board,

reported that the union’s total
had been further reduced by 89
names which could not -be found
on the company list and by eight
duplications.

Mcﬂabb -Ousted

In another development here,
Don McNabb, president of the
Steel local in Sudbury, was oust-
ed from that office on Sept. 13
by a vote of the members at
meetings on Sunday night and
Monday morning. He faced
seven -charges, including the
mishandling of union funds, and
is prohibited by the action from
seeking office again for eight
years. Only 439 votes were cast
at the two meetings, with 329
voting against McNabb’s re-
maining in office.

Prior to 1963, when Steel won
a disputed election at Sudbury
by a scant 15 votes, Inco work-
ers had enjoyed a 10 -cents an

hour wage differential over -"the"

employees at Cominco. That «dif-
ferential is now some 22 to 329
cents -per hour in the other di-
rection.

THE MINE-MILL UNION

-gtﬁzngrfv »

Al Skinner
‘ Candidate for
“ ‘ President

The accomplishments of the
Union in the past few years
have been remarkable. The re-
ports to the convention proved
that fact to all delegates. There
is today a deep and solid confi-
dence throughout the Union in
our future.

Only if you have had the op-
portunity, as I have had, to

cover most sections of the.

Union, including Canada, dur-
ing the past year, can you really
appreciate this revival of confi-
dence and determination. After
the many years of profound dif-
ficulties and struggle for sur-
this development is a

I say allof us, I mean just that.
No individual or group within
the Union can claim credit for
this [remarkable-record of the
past few years.

This has been a collective ef-
fort throughout the Union. It

starts with a united Interna-'
-tional -Executive Board that

learned through debate," discus-
sion, and experience that the
program and progress of the
Union comes first. It continues
with international ' staff mem-

ubers, hundreds of local leaders,

and thousands of stewards and
active members, who, on their
owninitiative, worked to apply
this a g gre s s iv e international
program at the local union
level.

All of this new spirit in the
Union was reflected in a con-
fident and united international
convention. This past conven-

‘tio did not reflect any superfi-

cial unity. It was not a “back-
slapping, political machine
unity.” The convention unity
was based on a sober review of

the record and a hard-boiled,

realistic program for the future.
This unity is based on substan-
tial accomplishment and prog-
ress in the fields of organiza-
tion, bargaining, political action,
civil rights, union defense, press
and education, and financial
progress. This two-year record
convinced the convention dele-
gates to endorse an expanded,
long-range program covering all
these endeavors. This is now the
union’s program for the future.

To achieve the benefits of this
convention program, we shall
continue the kind of critical ex-
amination and objective deci-
sion we have had on the Inter-
national Executive Board for

the past two years. I, therefore,‘

recommend and support the re-
election of every one of. the

Asbury Howard

Candidate for
Vice-President

I am grateful to the dele-
gates to our recent international
convention and to the lo-cals
they represented for honoring
me with the nomination for in-
ternational vice-president. I am
especially pleased by the nom-
ination because it came at the
culmination of one of the most
united and constructive conven-
tions our Union has ever held.

The spirit of the convention
was one which showed that the
Union was on the move. We
are In 0 v i n g organizationally,
bringing workers into om‘ ranks
from mines and plants at a re-
newed pace. We are moving
ahead in the wages and condi-
tions that are being won for
our membership. The negotia-
tions of 1964 with the major
chains in our industry marked
a giant step forward in our
program for a decent livelihood
and security for our members.

We are moving ahead on civil ‘

rights. Through the understand-
ing of our members and ‘with
theassistance of re-cent legisla-
tion, we are removing barriers
to full equality for all Ameri-
cans, on the job and where we
live‘. We are moving ahead with
new services in education for
our members, with a more in-
teresting and informative Mine-
Mill Union, with stimulating re-
search and stewards’ bulletins.

We are on the go in political
and legislative activity. Our
Union made a significant con-
tribution in the 1964 political
campaign. Recent passage of
the Mine Safety Bill in the
House was in a great measure
due to the initiative of our or-
ganization.

We are making great strides
toward a stable financial struc-
ture. For the first time in many
years, our general fund is grow-
ing to meet the needs of the
Union.

Every phase of the program
adopted by the convention was
in keeping with this forward out-
look of the Union. On October
19, our membership will have
an opportunity to keep this ball
rolling. I would recommend that
all members vote “Yes” on the
convention-endo-rsed per capita
proposals so that we may con-
tinue to keep all-aspects of our
program moving ahead.

I am proud to be a member
of our international executive
board, which has worked so

-harmoniously in carrying out the

program of the Union. I urge
the re-election of all executive
board members based on the
substantial record. of- achieve-
ment. A

to all local leaders and conven-
tion delegates -for my nomina-
tion to a second term as presi-
dent of Mine-Mill. It is a re-
sponsibility and a challenge that
I have enjoyed tremendously
during the one term I have

served. I wouldn’ttrade it for «
any other job in this country. I.

am a very proud man to be
president of this exceptionaland
wonderful union. Ihope my ef-
forts in this ‘position will justify

your continued support in the
"years ahead.-My humble thanks

Irving Dicirier
Candidate for
Secretary-Treasurer
I want to thank the members

-of our Union and the delegates

to our convention for their vote
of confidence in the officers of

-our International Union.

As secretary-treasurer, my
major responsibility is and
must continue to be the finan-
cial well-being of our Interna-
Within the past
two years, our International
Union, with a united leadership,
has chalked up some major
achievements in bargaining,
legislation, organization, and
services to the membership.
Going hand in hand with these

"achievements has been the

steady growth of the financial
reserves of the Union._ ,
We have been able to build
reserves by budgeting
every dollar we receive and
practicing the most stringent
economies. But in spite of our
economies, in spite of our bud-
geting, costs keep going up.— I
am not speaking merely of
the cost of "such" items as office
supplies, services and equip-

f ment.

After we negotiated a secur-
ity-severance plan for the work-
ers in our industry, we had to

.set money aside for similar

coverage for our staff and em-
ployees.

Health and welfare costs
have gone up without any im-
provements in benefits.

It ill behooves a union like
ours to fight for improved pen-
sions and not provide the same
type of coverage for our people.
We recently had to set up a
disability pension plan which
was not provided for in our
basic coverage.

The convention voted a wage
increase to officers and staff
which will be extended to all
who work for the Union. This
will cost money.

But these are only part of our
increased costs. You cannot
organize without money. Based
on our experiences in the past
two years, it costs us approxi-
mately $11 per worker to bring
any group into our Union. Our
increased organizational work
means increased costs. ""-'

Legislative activities on a
state or federal level mean in-
creased costs. To maintain a
legislative representative in
Washington this year cost us
$1,500 a month.

To. meet our industry on a

basis of equalit-y across the

baraining table becomes in-
creasingly more costly. A
security-severance break-
through, a 24-cent cash wage
package, improvements in
vacations, holidays, night shift
differentials—all of this meant
the tightest coordination and
consultation with ‘ officers, staff,
and rank-and-file leaders. This,
too, meant. increased. costs.

In addition, we need to build
a sizeable strike fund, and the
per capita increase will help us
do so. Today when we think of
a strike fund, we have to think
big.""Strikes have become in-
creasingly more costly.’ Last
year, we had one major strike
at Kennecott which lasted‘ from
seven to nine weeks and cost

-$202,450-—$83,000 from the inter- ,-
toevery member‘ of Mine-Mill." " national r_st_rike, fund and $119,- ‘-

iBarnev Rask

Candidate for
— Board Member, District I

I deeply appreciate the honor
of having been nominated to
the office of board member
from District 1.

'I- will endeavor to do my best
for the membership in the dis-
trict and the entire Union. In
order to do this I will need and
seek the cooperation and assist-
ance of all the membership, lo-
cal union leaders, and the inter-
national leadership, as I have
done in the past.

Our International Union has
gone a long way in the past two
years. We have a united Union
-from top to bottom—dedicated
to the welfare of our member-
ship and their families.

In our district, this unity en-
abled us to defeat all raids-
both in the Coeur d’Alenes and
in Great Falls—successfully con-
clude our major negotiations,
bring new workers into our
Union, and actively participate
in political, legislative, and com-
munity activities.

We take pride in the progress
made in the passage of a Fed-
eral Mine Safety Bill. The late
Senator Murray of Montana
sponsored the first Federal Mine
Safety. Bill in Congress. Final
passage of the bill will not only

-be a tribute‘ to him, but to all
the members of our district who
over the long years fought for
this legislation.

Duriiig the past two years, we
have challenged the splitters in
our district in their two major

— concentrations —— at An a c ond a

and Bunker Hill. Though we did-
not win, substantial groups of
workers in both properties voted
for Mine-Mill. We intend to keep
after them. We are committed
to our international’s program
of once again uniting the work-
ers in our industry into one
Union—Mine-Mill.

450 from the local union strike
funds. We presently are on
strike at Ground Hog (AS&R)
and at Humboldt Brick, and
although a comparatively small
number of our members are
involved, we are paying out
$3,683 a month in strike bene-
‘fits. ' '

These increased costs can be
met by a very nominal increase
in per capita. Twenty-five cents
increase in per capita is ap-
proximately one-seventh of a
cent an hour. Over a four-year
.period, it adds up to a total‘ of
a little over bne-half of a cent
an hour.

The secretary-treasurer’s job
at times involves more than the
responsibility of our finances.
Within the past two years, I
have.been involved in bargain-
ing, not only as an officer of
the Union but as AS&R Council
Coordinator. I have acted as
Political Action and Legislative
Director upon assignment from
the International Executive
Board. I look forward towards
a continuation of this work.

-But at present, the most im-
portant single, assignment I
have is to convince our mem-
bership that for the continued
well-being of our Union we

must pass the per capita refer-V

endum. -Iltherefore ‘urge every
member to voteyYES on Octo-
b.e.r_1.€?th-   '

William E. Lee
Candidafe for
Board Member, District I

I believe that some of the pre-

requisites of being a candidate T‘

for executive board member are
the qualifications and abilityfto
organize and promote the type
of programs that will work to
the advantage and benefit of

every Brother in thedistrict and 

the entire International Union,

in the fields of negotiations, ,

grievances and arbitrations, leg..

islative programs, both state ’

and national, political activity,
and organizing the unorganized.
I firmly believe I have the quali-

' fications and ability to success-.
fully carry out the duties, re--

sponsibilities, and obligations of

the exec'utive’board -member of ’.

District 1.

I have been a member. of

Mine-Mill for 19 years. I have

been an officer and steward of‘ V

Local 25 for 16 years. Ivhave’
been the full-time business agent
for eight years, a member of

-the AS&R Council for 10 years,
and a "member of the AS&R na- -
-tional negotiating committeefor
‘eight years. During this time,tI

have processed literally ‘hun-

dreds of grievances and many I

arbitrations with, I can modestly
say, great success. .-

We have negotiated four ma-

jor national agreements with the/( 3
American Smelting and Refining’

Company-the last of which con-
tained the precedent-setting Se-

curity-Severance Pay‘ Plan. I 

have represented the Mine-Mill
Union as a lobbyist during- the
past four sessions of the Wash-
ington State Legislature. I have
served on the executive commit-
tee of the United Labor Lobby,
being appointed by the president

of the Washington State Labor»

Council, AFL-CIO. I have repre-

sented my Local Union in Wash-..”

ington, D. C., before commit-
tees, Senators and Congressmen,
on the unfair competition of the
Japanese copper industry. '

I believe this Union has done

an excellent job in the past two _

years on political action and
legislation, and bargaining in
most areas. However, this Union

has to take a much firmer posi- '

tion in negotiations with the
Anaconda Company, to br'
the substandard wage and b
fit structure of. the Montana
workers up to those of the other
workers in the industry. The Se-
curity-Severance Pay has to be‘
extended to the Anaconda work‘-
ers.

     

I believe in a budgetary sys-L .
tem of finances, but not to the A ,
extent of building a large inter- : ~
national treasury at the expense I

of curtailed service to locals and
the organization of workers ‘into

this Union. This Union must -'
spend all of its money, time, and.
efforts in doing a job for the ,
membership. The key to ulti- "

mate success of this Union, fi-

nancial and otherwise, is the?
organizing of thousands of un- , _
into our’ ‘

organized workers ,
ranks, and not the continuous

increasesin dues and "per capita. .. -5

I pledge that, if elected, I will
devote all of my efforts and en-.

ergies in the directioniof ..attain- , 

ingthese goals. . _ 4 A g

The program for the future

is a. good, far-reaching program,

' and I pledge» to work for its

In: the past year and a-. half,

cation elections out of 11 such
campaigns. While this is a. good

_ record, more needs to be done

in? the area: of organization‘ of
the unorganized. The great. mili-
tant tradition of this Union de-
mands- it. Yet, this is an ex-
pensive proposition‘.

'I«‘his- is one of’ the many rea-
sons why it is important for our
membership to- support the ref-
erendum: proposal’ to-' increase
per capita payments to. the In-
terna-t-ional Union by a. total: of
$1-- over the course. of the next
four years. Such an. increase
will. allow the Union. to strength-

and thus substantially improve
our bargaining position,. will
provide the money for expan-
sion of activity‘ in the areas of
political action and‘ civil rights,
and’ will allow the oﬂicersi and
staff? of the Union‘ to share‘ in
the wage and’ other gains" that
we have been making through-
out our industry.

'I’.h‘e“~ deiegates tow tlie conven-

At such time" as our members
reach retirement age, it is ab-
solutely a must that each one
is able to. retire with a decent
severance‘-security payment for
his years of service‘ that will
provide a transition from active
work to retirement with pension
benefits that will guarantee
each of our members _a com-
fortable life‘ with" dignity; Our

plish‘ these‘ goals.

The financial program adopt-
ed- by the convention. is proof
that the delegates realize its
importance, and can: only be
interpreted as. an expression of
complete‘ confidence‘ in the“ fu-

House Action on Safety Bill

THE MINE-MILL UNION

“Historic Step" in M-M Drive

(Continued from Page 3)

cause death or serious physical
harm” shall be mandatory—vio-
lation of which could result in
the closing of the property by
the Secretary of the Interior.

If such a mandatory standard
is‘ violated but ‘death or serious
harm is not imminent, the Sec-
retary will set a time limit dur-
ing which the violation must be

. corrected. If still not corrected,

the Secretary will order the

. closing of the property.

A mine operator may request

it a hearing and may appeal such

an order to the federal courts,
but the finding of the Secretary
as to facts, if supported by sub-
stantial evidence on the record
as a whole, shall be conclusive.

Major administrative respon-
sibility, under terms of the bill,
rests with the U. S. Bureau Of
Mines, which is authorized to
make any inspections and in-
vestigations it feels necessary.

Underground mines must be in-

spected at least annually by the
Bureau, except where an -ap-

proved state plan is in effect .

and such annual inspections are
being carried out by state au-
thorities. . -
The bill, too, necessitates th

filing of reports by operators
with the Secretary of the Inte-
rior on accidents, injuries, and

‘ occupational diseases. This also
must be done at least annually.

Approval of State Plans
Providing’ greatly increased

federal power in setting safety

standards, requiring the submis-
sion of accident reports, and
allowing inspections at any time,
the bill also would allow any
state which submits to the Sec-
retary of the Interior a satis-
factory safety plan to carry out
itsown administration and en-
forcement. In order to receive
approval, such state plans must
provide for annual inspections,
except of quarries and sand and
gravel pits; enforcement of
standards substantially as effec-
tive as the’ federal mandatory

standards; sufficient funds and

enough qualified personnel for
adequate enforcement; and ade-
quate measures to protect
against loss"of life or damage
arising from closed and aban-
doned mines.

The Bureau of Mines would be
the administrative agency in
states not submitting adequate
programs, and the Secretary of
the Interior must make a con-
tinuing evaluation of all ap-
proved _ state plans. Should he
find that the plan is not being
carried out satisfactorily, he

,__must cancel his approval and
 enforcement will revert to the

Bureau of Mines. The bill pro-
vides for court review of the
Secretary’s decisions in disap-
proving a state program or in
withdrawing approval after it is
in operation.’ '

A statewill be ‘allowed to'sub-

.‘ mit asafety program tothe Sec- .
‘ retary at any time for approval,

and the federal program, on en-

forcement of safety standards .
V will not take effect in any state
' until 90 days after a regular ses-
' sion of its legislature, which is
‘ thus given the‘ opportunity, if-
desired, of establishing a state -

program. .

Fines of $100 to $3,000 and im-
prisonment for up to 60 days
are provided in the bill for an
failure to
with an order closing a mine.
Where an approved state pro-
gram is in effect, penalties will

--be set in the state plan.

H.R. 8989, too, directs the Sec-

- retary of the Interior to develop

expanded health and safety edu-
cation programs for mine oper-
ators and workers at properties
covered_ by the ,bill_. Finally, it
provides such funds as are nec-

ess_ary to carry out the, provi— '1

sions of the measure.-

ordinator Irving Dichter hailed
the House passage of the bill as

“an historic step in securing. the
first federal protection for "metal?
While,
pointing out that the next?-: ob- .

miners and millmen.”

jective must be to win passage

in the Senate, he said that: the —'

House action “culminates more
than 15 years of work by ‘our
union,” calling the House,,pafs-
sage of the bill “a tribute to the

effectiveness of Mine-Mill inthe.
political and legislative fieldf’. 

While attempts by Mine-Mill
and other labor unions to in-
clude coverage for smelters and
refineries in the administration
bill failed, the labor subcommit-
tee has asked the Secretary of

‘the -Interior to gather and pre-

sent to the committee informa-
tion with‘ regard to health and
safety conditions at such prop-
erties. -“If this information,
when developed,” states the
committee’s report on H.R. 8989,
“indicates a need for further
legislation, the committee will
then be in a better position to
consider same.”

Smelters and Refineries
Safety Campaign
"A resolution at the recent in-

ternational convention calls for
the union to have introduced a

Smelter and Refinery Safety V

Study bill, preliminary to a
campaign for a Smelter and Re-
finery Safety Act-—a project to
which the international officers
are directing their attention.

Substantial Republican sup-
port for the mine safety bill was
picked up through the amend-
ment to the original bill which
gives the states an opportunity

to administer their own plans, —‘

if approved by the Secretary.
The compromise approach was
worked out primarily by Rep.‘
James G. O’Hara (D-Mich.),
who introduced the bill and
chaired the subcommittee hear-
ings, and Rep. Quie.

A similar provision in the
Federal Coal Mine Safety Act
authorizes state administration
of -the program under standards
set by the Secretary of the In-
terior, but no important coal-
producing states have chosen to
assume this administrative re-
sponsibility.

Management Opposition

The American Mining Con-
gress, major voice for mine
management, is said not to like
the compromise version much
better than the original.

Speaking in support of the
bill, Rep. James G. Fulton
A(._R_-Pa.) stated, “With respect to

‘ the" operators and the American
Mining Congress, many of whom
I know personally, I am at a
loss to understand why they are
not in here today endorsing H.R.
8989-_ instead of being so unalter-
ably. opposed to this legislation.”
“This ‘continued opposition,”
which .f Fulton ‘said he deplored,
“does not make any sense, ex-
=Ce.pt" that a- pessimistic philoso-

’ phy is depended on, -‘accidents

will_always happen,’ ” he main-
tained.

Support on Floor

Also supporting the bill dur-
ing the fl_oor discussion were
Reps. O’Hara and Quie, Adam
C. Powell (D-N. Y.), chairman
_ of the full Education and Labor
Committee; -David S. King (D-
Utah); Arnold, Olsen ' (D-Mont. );
~ George F. Senner,‘ Jr. (D-Ariz.);
Raymond F. Clevenger (D-
Mich.), also a sponsor of the
measure, Elmer J. Holland (D-
Pa.), chairman of the Labor
Subcommittee; John H. Dent
(D-Pa.); William D. Ford (D-
Mich.); Compton I. White, Jr.
(D-Idaho); Frank M. Clark (D-
Pa.); Sam M. Gibbons (D-Fla.);
Robert P. Griffin (R-Mich.);
William D. Hathaway (D-
Maine); Edward R. R0-ybal (D-
Calif.); Robert C. McEwen (R-
N. Y.), and Rep. Aspinall.

\ "Several Congressmen quoted
"_\a figure that, under present con-
figditions, seven of 100 men em-
;'ployed for a lifetime in metal
5, and mineral mining can expect

 to be killed in accidents on-the-‘

/ job.

“To excuse the taking of every
reasonable precaution to pre-
vent accidents, on the ground
that accidents are inevitable, is,
in my opinion, the cruelest kind

of sophistry,” said Rep. King, ,

who was highly praised by Rep.
O’Hara as having “indeed made
a valuable contribution to the
enactment of this legislation.”
“I do not believe any member
of the House,” said O’Hara,
“has been in touch with me
more frequently regarding this
bill and has shown more inter-
est in it than the gentleman
from Utah.”

,“The 89th Congress has com-
piled a tremendous record,”
maintained Rep. Clark, pointing
out, “The passage of H.R. 8989
will add in no small way to that
record.”

‘ Rep. King on Mine-Mill  

(The following statement by Rep. David S. King (D-Utah) on.
Sept. 20 was inserted in the Congressional Record.)

Mr. Speaker, I wish to pay a brief tribute to the hard and 

persevering work, year after year, of the International.
Union of -Mine, Mill & Smelter Workers on behalf of
Federal safety legislation for" metallic and nonmetallic
mines. The contribution of this union to the passage by

the House on September 2 of H. R. 8989, the Federal ‘
Metalic and Nonmetallic Mine Safety Act, was very ‘

substantial.

Its contribution to the out-
standing report of Secretary
of the Interior Stewart Udall on
health and safety in metal and
nonmetal mines is deserving of

recognition. Its membership in -

the mines of my state and

throughout the West cooperated .
in an outstanding way in the
conduct of the study on which

this report is based.

Mine-Mill local union safety
committees met repeatedly with
Federal mine inspectors to dis-
cuss safety hazards, and sub-

mitted to the Department of the

 

U.S. Rep. David S. King
Lands Mine-Mill

Interior literally hundreds of de- 8

tailed reports on mine acci-
dents, many of which werenot
otherwise reported. ,
.This union has presented most
valuable testimony, springing

try’s metallic and nonmetallici

-mines, at hearings on mine _

safety held by subcommittees of
the House Committee on Educa-
tion and Labor in 1956, -1957,
1961, and 1965. It has contrib-

uted to the drafting of mine 5
—safety legislation which has .
beenintroduced in both Houses ’

in the 88th and 89th Congresses;
and which I was happy to in-
troduce in the present session
as H.R.‘ 2993 on «January ‘ 18,
1965. ' -~

The Interior Department bill,

H. R. 8989, as amended, draws '

heavily on the thinking that is
expressed in H.R. 2993 and in
the hard-hitting and specific
testimony of its witnesses at
subcommittee h e a ;i n g s last
May.-

I commend the record of this
great and historic union of hard-
rock miners, whoseforigins in
the West, including 'my state,
date back to the 19th century,
more than 70 years.

Tooele   Two -Year Pact  
Has 20 Cents in Wages

TOOELE, Utah -— Across-the-
board wage increases of -20 cents
per hour are provided in a new
two-year contract between Mine-
Mill Local 55, the TooeleMill
and Smeltermen’s Union, and
the International Smelting and
Refining Company, a subsidiary
of Anaconda.

Ratified early last month, the
contract" includes gains in shift
differentials and vacations, as
well as improvements in lan-
guage on seniority and several
other non-economic matters.

The first year’s wage gain, 12
cents an hour, is retroactive to
July 1 of this year. On July 1,
1966, an across-the-board hike
of eight cents an hour takes ef-

the issue on Oct. 19. Passage of the progrctm would strengthen the union's bargaining
power and provide for the necessary expansion of activities, the Council said. The
political arm of the union inihe state, the Council also backed or state bond issue,

some 200 delegates to the union’s 59th convention

own financial standing.

Two races for international executive board posi-

Security-Severance
Pay From AS&R

ing the first year of the pro-
gram negotiated by the
union last summer, total
$234,352.96 -— CLOSE TO A
QUARTER OF A MILLION
DOLLARS.

That is the amount paid-
out in benefits from July 1,
1964 through June 30, 1965.

‘It was the Mine-Mill AS&R ‘
Council that made the break-
-through in the security-sev-

in'g,_ establishing a pattern
that was spread throughout
most of the major chains in

than the one used elsewhere,
is‘ one percent of a worker’s

From July 1, 1964, when

through August, 1965-a pe-

This is an average of $28.68

or about $25 per year.

But, of course, the $48,750
was divided only among
workers who retired or were
laid off (in the case of death,
the payment goes to the ben-
eficiary). All other workers
were storing up credits under

0 Expansion of the union’s re-
search and educational activi-

Great stress was laid upon fu-
ture negotiations and the need

for an adequate international,

strike fund, which would sub-
stantially strengthen the union’s
position at the bargaining table.

Strike Fund

The strike fund, which stood
at $79,511 as of June 30, 1965,
after having disbursed $95,210 in
strike relief last year, would be
up to approximately $260,000 by
July 1, 1967, if the per capita

"increase is approved and pro-

viding there are no substantial
drains on the fund in the mean-
while. The international is cur-
rently issuing strike relief total-
ing $850 per week to workers
striking the Ground Hog opera-
tions in Bayard, N. M., and the
Humboldt (Kansas) Brick and
Tile Company.

.Strengthening the union’s bar-
gaining power, a substantial
strike fund can serve to dis-
courage the companies from
forcing such walkouts.

Delegates, too, heard a report
from Secretary-Treasurer Irving

, Dichter pointing out that-organ-

izational campaigns cost ap-
proximately $11 per employee.
In other words, to organize 5,000
workers takes a budget of some
$55,000.

Mine-Mill, over the past year

and a half, won nine of 11 NLRB
elections at new properties-a
percentage -far above the na-
tional average. An expansion of

this organizational activity, how- .

ever, will be highly expensive.

Cost to Members

In the two decades since 1946,
Mine-Mill per capita increases
have cost the average member
approximately one cent per
hour, while the value of the
gains in wages and fringe bene-
fits during that period comes
close to $2.90 an hour.

If the referendum proposal on
per capita is approved on Oct.
19, a Mine-Mill member would
be paying, by 1969, when the
full $1 increase has taken, ef-

fect, about an additional one-“= —

half-cent per hour. Delegates to
the 59th convention believed that
the increased benefits to be de-
rived from such a program are
well worth that cost.

4} Stress Politics, Unity, Barney Rask
“ i Tells F armer-Labor Delegates

GREAT FALLS, Mont.—Mine-Mill Board Member Barney Rask, one of the featuredspeakers at

(the second annual Montana Labor Seminar, held at the College of Great Falls theater for three days

early last month, called for greater political unity among union members and predicted that “unless

-we get together in the coming general election, Lee Metcalf will not be sent back to the U. S. Senate.”

A member of a panel on “Labor and the Montana Scene,” Rask maintained that greater‘ empha-
sis must be placed on union organization and attendance at meetings. Blaming labor apathy for the

- fact that Republican Governor Tim Babcock narrowly won re-election in 1964, he said that negative

criticism of unions and their leaders and lack of legislative planning were partially responsible for

. jlabor’s not being as unified as

is possible.

Rask, a member of the Demo-
cratic executive committee in
Butte, maintained that unions
must become more involved in
politics. This idea was the key-

,-‘.1- ,._rioting theme of the seminar.

Striking Local 570 Files 
Unfair Labor ,Charges     

HUMBOLDT, Kansas—Mine-Mill_L'ocal 570,1. bn:str'ikle- .a:g.-sinsti -
the Humboldt Brick and Tile Company-sinceluvly 15, has filed:«un- 

fair labor practice charges against the company with the National
Labor Relations Board, maintaining that mangement has attempted

  while the‘-. men.

to set prior conditions to the resumption of negotiations.

The company, union officials say, wants a union statement that
the plant supervisor would not be asubject for discussion at such
meetings. The some 35 members of Local 570,. however, who voted
unanimously to stage the walkout, want the‘ present supervisor

removed from that position as
part of any agreement under
which they would return to their
jobs.

Two picket lines are being
maintained in the strike:-one at
the brick plant itself and an-
other at the company’s- office
in town. Wives. and children of
the workers have been helping
out in this picket duty.

Humboldt Brick and Tile, ob-
viously out this year to destroy
the union, has now seen two and
a h-alf months go. by with no
slackening of the solid support
that the-‘strike has received.

Since the local was organized
in 1940, the workers have been
on strike once before. Last year,

I October. 1965

THE MINE-MILL UNION I

its.-7

El Paso Pact Contains 30:

In Wages and Pension Gains

EL PASO, Texas-—On Sept. 17, members of l\/line-Mill Local 903 unanimously and
enthusiastically ratified a new three-year agreement with the Southwestern Portland
Cement Company which features 30 cents an hour in wage gains, improvements in the
pension plan which bring the basic monthly benefit to $3.75 per year of service, vaca-
tion and job security improvements, and many other benefits.

' An across-the-board wage increase of 15 cents per hour took effect on Sept. 16,
with a similar hike slated to become effective on Sept. 16, 1967.

With Mine-Mill set to make pension improvements a major bargaining goal when

it again negotiates with the large nationwide chains in 1967 (next year in the case of

AS&R), Local 903 extended its
pension program to May 1, 1967,
when the contract will again be
open in this regard. At the same
time, it won an increase from

in $2.75 to $3.75 in the monthly ben-

efit per year of service.

Security Improvements

Gains in the supplemental un-
employment benefit plan pro-
vide that the company add to
workmen’s compensation pay-
ments to make them total $75
per week for 52 weeks. Addi-
tionally,‘ workers retiring or be-
ing terminated would receive
one week’s pay per year of ser-
vice. '

Vacations were improved to
provide the following schedule,
effective Jan. 1, 1966: two

' weeks’ vacation after one year
of service, three weeks after

three years, four weeks after 10,
and five weeks’ vacation after
20 years of service.

Shift differentials will be in-
creased to 12 cents per hour for
the middle shift and 18 cents for
the night shift, as of Sept. 16,

X‘ -1966. One additional holiday

the employee’s birthday-will

-beco-me effective that same

date, making a total of nine
paid holidays. Also effective
Sept. 16, 1965, will be several
improvements in the health and
welfare program.

. Accidental death and dismem-
berment insurance will be hiked
from $5,000 to $6,000. A $350
surgical fee schedule will take
effect, and 120 days of semi-pri-

' vate room care in the hospital

will be provided.

Several Grievances
Resolved by Local I6

GREAT FALLS, Mont—Sever-
al lengthy grievances against
the Anaconda Company have
been won by Mine-Mill Local 16,
the Great Falls Mill and Smel-
termen’s Union.

In one case, the extra repair
leadman in the four zinc plant‘
departments will receive an ex-
tra $1.02 per shift difference in
pay that the union has been de-
manding. This difference in back
pay to July 1, 1964 was won as
well.

Effective Sept. 1, 1965, the
extra repair leadman at the roll-
ing mills (wire mill) will be
paid leadman’s rate when the
regular leadman is off——a $2.04
per shift increase for the extra

A leadman in such cases.
Anaconda has agreed, too, that"

when a man‘ doubles over on a
job that pays less than his regu-
lar one, he will be paid at the
higher rate for the doubled-over
shift as well. '

The local is in the process of
attempting to resolve several

additional grievances existing at
the Great Ea-lls plant.

 

The Weekly disability benefit
of $50 per week is extended to 52
weeks from the present 26, be-
coming effective on the first day
of an accident and the fourth-
day of an illness. For future
retirees, life insurance is hiked
from $1,000 to $2,500 and the
health and welfare plan will pro-
vide the full cost of hospital-
surgical coverage for the future
retiree and his wife.

Other Gains

Other benefits included in the
three-year contract are double
time pay for overtime work on
Sunday and triple pay for .holi-
day overtime. The funeral leave
clause was broadened to include
the death of a father-in-law,
mother -in - law, step - son, step -
daughter, half-sister, or half-
brother. The clause on jury duty
pay will cover the shift Workers,

who may skip work, beginning
on the second night, since their
scheduled shifts do not corre-
spond with the jury duty,

Among the more
contract language changes are
those providing that up to four
grievances can be heard before
the same arbitrator at one se-
ries of hearings; that a worker
will retain his present wage
rate for 90 days if displaced to
a lower-rated job; that no fore-
men or others outside the union
jurisdiction will perform work
done by members of the unit.

Serving on the union’s bar-
gaining committee were Gabriel
Cedilo, business agent for Local
903; George Jasso, president of
the local; Isidro Sanchez; Feli-
mon Tafoya; Ramon Armen-
dariz; and Alfredo C. Montoya,
international representative.

Close to 150 workers are cov-
ered by the new contract.

Killed in Accidents in Butte. Montana

important ,

Three in liners liiled;   

Anaeondaiﬁars federal Probe

Three underground miners, members of the Butte’

Miners Union, Mine-Mill Local 1, were killed in a period
of less than two weeks last month. Emilio Romero, 33,
died of a broken neck on Sept. 16, when caught by a slab
breaking away from the back of a stope at the 4800-level
of the Anaconda Company’s Mountain Con mine. Gerald
R. Noeller, 29, and Joseph E. Huber, 33, both originally
from South Dakota and both Korean war veterans, were
killed Sept. 28 in an explosion in a stope at the 4200-level

in the Steward mine.

Anaconda did not notify health and safety officials
of the Bureau of Mines of these accidents. _

When a report from Local Union President Reginald
Beavis on the deaths of Noeller and Huber was relayed" to

the Bureau, however, it requested permission of the 
conda‘Company to investigate the accident at the scene?

After a delay of several hours, the Bureau was advised
by a high company official that it would not be permitted

to investigate the accident.

Since the expiration of the
Mine Safety Study Act of 1961,
the Bureau has lacked authority
to inspect metal mines and in-
vestigate accidents without per-
mission of the companies con-
cerned.

Beavis represented Mine-Mill
on the investigating parties in-
quiring into both accidents. Oth-
ers participating included com-
pany officials; Andy Aleksich,
county coroner; and Nathan
May, State mine inspector. Bea-
vis reported on both accidents
to membership meetings of L0-
cal 1.

Discussion on Fuse

Discussion at the meetings
brought out the fact that fuse
supplied to Butte miners recent-
ly had been causing missed
holes and, in some cases, had
been running fast. There has
been speculation that there was
some connection between possi-
bly defective fuse and the Ana-
conda Company’s reluctance to
have the fatal explosion investi-
gated by explosives experts on
the staff of the U. S. Bureau of
Mines.

Romero leaves his wife, three

daughters, and two sons. Huber
is survived by his wife and
three 1 children. Noeller leaves
his wife and five children.

Local 593 Congratulates
UAWon Toronto Contract

TORONTO, 0nt.——A 20-week strike by some 1,200 members of,

United Auto Workers Local 399 against Anaconda American Brass
ended last month with ratification on Sept. 3 of a three-year con-
tract providing 23 cents per hour in wages and other benefits.

The first year’s hike of 11 cents an hour is retroactive to April
21 of this year, while six-cent increases take effect on Jan. 1, 1966
and 1967. Skilled trades will receive an additional five cents an
hour in the first and third years of the pact.

Each worker received $30 in settlement pay; shift premiums
were upped to 9 and 12 cents per hour; weekly sickness and acci-
dent payments of $55 for a period of 39 weeks were established. The

following vacation schedule was
gained: three weeks’ vacation
after 15 years in 1965 and three
weeks after 12 in 1966; four
weeks after 25; additional pay
on a graduated scale between
12 and 25 years of service.

Improvements were also made
in the pension plan.

On the day following the set-
tlement, Mine-Mill International
Representative J o s eph Scioli
sent, on behalf of Local 593 in
Buffalo, N. Y., also an Anaconda
American Brass local, congratu-
lations to the UAW members for

their achievements in the long

strike, which began in April.

Copyright 1965 by Consumers Union of U. S.. Iuc., Mount Vernon.  Y.

Optional Auto Equipment:

Some Items Are Good Buys

When you buy a new car, the dealer will try to sell you certain
kinds of optional equipment. He may urge such items as white-
wall tires and extra chrome trim. These may add to the car’s
appearance, but they also add to its cost without improving its
safety, performance, convenience, or life expectancy. .

Other, more worthwhile, items of optional equipment are d1S-
cussed in the October issue of CONSUMER REPORTS.

Many of these items are relatively low-priced if installed at the
factory; thus a special order is required. The dealer is more likely
to push cars in stock with such extras as they have, or with extras
that he can install. But he usually has a list of the available options
and will order them for you if you convince him that you want the
car that way or not at all.

For less than half the $25-$30 you might spend for whitewalls,
you can order your car with all-black tires one size larger than
standard—7.75 instead of 7.35, for example. These larger tires wear
longer than the standard size and they’re likely to be safer, too,
because they can take a heavier load. «

Larger wheels are another inexpensive option. In fact, you can

buy both larger wheels and larger tires for no more than you would _

have paid for standard-sized whitewalls alone. The larger wheels
give you slightly better road clearance, plus improved stability if
they have wider rims as most do, and possibly better brake cooling.
Make sure, though, before ordering larger-wheels or tires, that the
spare will fit the spare-tire well on the car, if it has one.
A third inexpensive item, about $10, is a safety flasher, which
winks all four directional signals at once to indicate distress.
I A limited-slip differential ($40-$50) is useful in winter travel, or
on unsurfaced roads. It prevents all the power from being expended

- in spinning one drive wheel on a slippery surface while the other

drive wheel more or less stands still; thus it may keep your car
from getting stuck.

Some improvedlbrakes are worthwhile. Chrysler cars have
so-called “police brakes” for about $20 extra, and Ford‘ offers “fade-
resistan ” or “wear-resistant” brakes at about $10. On the basis of
experience thus far, disk brakes ($50-$150) are also considered a
desirable option.

 In some cars, the better brakes are sold only as part of a
trailer-towing or heavy-duty pack-age ($40-$80), comprising brakes,
springs, shock absorbers, and sometimes the cooling system. This
makes sense if you expect to load your car heavily and use it hard,
whether you tow a trailer or not.

Heavy-duty suspension ($5-20) is a good safety option. The car
carries" its lead better, rides more stably and handles better. These
suspensions are stiffer, though, and give you a harder ride than

the standard. It would be wise to try driving a sample of your -

chosen car equipped with the heavier suspension before ordering,
it this is at all possible.

, A more powerful battery (around $8) is useful where winters
are cold, especially on a low-priced model where the manufacturer
may have cutcorners on this item. And for driving in hot or
mountainous areas, a heavy-duty radiator ($10-12) is worthwhile.

For those buying a standard or “stick shift” instead‘ of an
automatic transmission, nearly all manufacturers offer a heavy-
duty clutch, usually at under $12. You’re likely to get more than
your money’s worth in the form of longer clutch life.

, The following safety items will be standard equipment on many
1966 cars of major manufacturers:- If any of them is" not standard
for your model, it is worth ordering: back-up lights, padded visors
and dash, an outside mirror on the left side, seat belts in the rear,
two-speed or variable-speed windshield wipers, windshield washers.

Stainless Steel Razor Blades Not Changed

There have been rumors that_,the quality of stainless steel razor
blades had been deliberately reduced in order to boost sales. Some
shavers have felt they were getting fewer shaves per blade than
they used to.

’ CONSUMER REPORTS for October gives test results on four
brands. They were tested in the same way as two years ago, by
a panel of 16- users. As far as possible, the same men took part
in- t-hisround of tests. The brand name was marked out, and each
panelist was asked to shave in his usual way. He used each blade

. only as long as he’ judged it was giving a satisfactory sh-ave.

As happened‘ two years ago, the number of satisfactory‘ shaves
varied widely from one man to another. Where some panelists
reported only ﬁve (or even zero) satisfactory shaves from a brand,
others reported 25 or 30 satisfactory shaves.

, When all the reports were in, some brands averaged a few
more shaves than others. But, there seemed to be no support for
the idea that the general quality level of any of the brands tested-

had changed significantly since 1964.

Cigarette Labeling:
A Defeat for Consumers

Starting next January, all cigarette packs and cartons must

- carry this reminder on their labels: “Caution: Cigarette smoking
, may be hazardous to your health.”

, This is the only positive statement that can be made. about the
Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act of 1965, according
to CONSUMER REPORTS for October. In all other important
respects the law is’a victory for the tobacco industry.

The required label itself’ is milder than the one proposed by
the Federal Trade Commission, which would have required men-

-* tion of “cancer and other diseases.”

And this mild notice may help tobacco companies defend them-
selves in future against suits by cigarette smokers——since the com-
panies will be able to argue that the smokers were duly warned.

Worst of all, the law blocksfor four years any requirement for

-— a health warning in cigarette advertising.

_"This was the heart of the matter,” says CONSUMER RE-
PORT, “for warning repeated countless times each day on TV and
radio, and in newspapers and magazines, might significantly curb
clgarette sales-—as well as lung cancer, heart attacks, emphysema,

 ~ g: chronic bronchitis, and other sequelae associated with cigarette

 

smoking.” ‘
The amendment prohibiting any requirement fora health state-

"  ment in cigarette advertisingwas added to the bill during an

executive’ session ‘of. the-.Senate Commerce. Committee..., It passed-

Unique Meeting

MIAMI, Ariz.—Some 200 per-
sons came to Miami for a unique
two-day conference last month,
designed to Ptovide information
on the role of the federal gov-
ernment in community and
county development. Speakers
from Washington, D. C., from
San Francisco, and from other
sections of Arizona’s Third Con-
gressional District attended the
sessions, sponsored by Congress-

men George F, (Duke) Senner,
Jr. —

‘Discussions and workshops
were held covering such sub-
jects as business expansion,
community use of federal forest
land, soil conservation, water
resources development,_ Indian
problems-, public health, hous-
ing, labor, development of out-
door recreation, and others.

At one of the workshops,
Mine-Mill leaders from Locals
586 and 616 in Miami and1Mor-
enci respectively met with an

Arizona representative of the"
State Apprenticeship Council. _

Participating were Robert Bar-
con, Jose ‘Hernandez, Frank
Morales, Thomas B. Aguilar,
Edward Marquez, Ladislao Gar-
cia, and Sylvain. Schnaittacher,
international representative.

Towns and cities, said Senner,
at the close of the Third District
development conference, must
assess their needs and then
chart their course “toward a-
better tomorrow.” Then, he said,
the federal government can help
with funds and cooperative plan-
ning guidelines.

Internortionol Representative

DENVER, Colo. — Delegates
from nearly a score of unions at
Stauffer C h e" mice a 1 Company
plants across the country and
international representatives‘ of

. a half dozen international unions

met at the Park Lane Hotel here
on Sept. 13 and 14. The occa-
sion was the second meeting of
the Stauffer Chemical Confer-
ence, formed‘ last year’ to work
towards as program of coordi-
nated bargaining with the chem-
ical giant.

The ultimate objective, dele-
gates agreed, would be a single
nationwide contract between the
company and all local unions
holding bargaining rights. Stanf-
for has nearly 70 plants and
mines in the United States
alone, from Florida to Tacoma,
Washington.

Facing the primary problem
that some 15 international unions
have bargaining rights at Stanf-
fer plants, with widely varying
contract expiration dates, the
conference admitted that the
goal of a nationwide contract
will take several years to
achieve. The delegates agreed,
however, on a program of
minimum demands that will be
recommended‘ to all locals hav-
ing contracts expiring in 1965
and 1966.

Recommended Demands

These demands will include
non-contributory insurance and
pensions, vested sick .leave,
dental‘ coverage, improved va-
cations of three weeks after 10
years of service, four weeks
after 20- and five weeks after
25 years, nine paid holidays,
and shift differential. pay of 20
cents for afternoon and grave-
yard shifts.

Mine-Mill delegates attending

been achieved by the tobacco industry alone. Pressure from the

    

- 

newspapers, magazines, and radio-TV industries turned the tide.
The tobacco companies announced that if a health warning were
required. in cigarette advertising, they might stop advertising. The
associations of advertisers, publishers, and broadcasters, who de-

rive» a significant part of their income from cigarette advertising, ~
then warned Congress of the dire results that would follow any such V

requirement. A
The new law, if allowed‘ to stand, means that for four years

 not only the Federal Trade Commission, but (the states and cities-_
_ as well, are forbidden to require a health warning in ,1 cigarette

M-M Leaders Issue Call
For Farmer-Labor Unity

GREAT FALLS, Mont.—Term-
ing the farmers and the work-
ing people in the United States
“the great backbone of Ameri-
can life,”_ Mine-Mill Interna-
tional President A. C. Skinner,
speaking at a 68th anniversary
banquet of the Great Falls Mill
and Smeltermen’s Union, Local
16, here on Sept.'16, called for
a united farmer-labor front to
protect and advance the secu-
rity and economic status of both
groups.

The dinner at Eddie's Delux
Lounge also honored the many

_~,:ng_fficers, stewards, and safety

   
 
  

committeemen of the local union
who had finished a seven-montlr
long, training course, conducted
by International Representative
J. P. Mooney, that ended in Au-
gust. They, along with their
wives, made up the great bulk
of the ,83 persons who attended
the affair.

Bofh Face Automation

Skinner, who had high praise
for the’ Farmers Union, said

that “both family farmers and
the families of miners, smelter-

men, and manufacturing work-

ers are faced with the same
great problem—automation.”
District 1 Board Member Bar-
ney Rask, another featured
speaker at the banquet, urged
that the state's labor unions

wake up and unite with the

farmers for effective bargaining

and political action in the period
ahead. Pointing out that Mine-

Mill had worked with the Na-
tional Farmers Union and other
labor groups to help secure pas-
sage of the farm bill, which re-

_.cently cleared both houses of
‘ "Congress, he said, “We need a

"great deal more of this kind of
unity between unions and farm-
ers—and a lot more unity within
organized 1abor——if our great
social objectives are to be
realized.”

Skinner charged that corpora-
tion farming and highly auto-
mated farm machinery are
eliminating family-type farming
all over the country. “It’s like
the corner grocery store trying
to ‘compete with the nationwide
financial operations of multi-
million dollar chain food opera-
tions,” he said, “It simply can't
be" done for very. long. The
farmer, like the working man,
must be given an equal oppor-
tunity to survive and prosper in
the automated, corporate, indus-
trial and farming economy al-
ready confronting us.”

Saying that mining and man-
ufacturing jobs are disappear-

ing at 3 rate of two million a
year and that family-operated
farms are rapidly diminishing,
he maintained that “unless this
problem is seriously tackled by
the federal government, the

farmers and organized labor-

genuine free enterprise — will -

also disappear. and there will
be no ‘Great Society’ in Amer-
ica.”

Recent Convent-ion

Stating that the recent Mine-
Mill international convention
ha_d laid out a long-range bar-
gaining program, including ear-
lier retirement, substantially in-
creased pensions, wage in-
creases, and severance pay, to
protect the jobs of its members

’ in the industry, Rask said that

the efforts of the American la-
bor movement to increase job
security and take-home pay are
“a great contribution to Amer-
ican prosperity.”

Arthur Clausen, president of
the Great Falls local, served as
master of ceremonies at the din-
ner. Carl Clavadetscher of the
Federal Mediation and Concilia-
tion Service here, who was also
scheduled to speak, was unable
to attend because of illness.

The Mine-Mill float depicted
the apparition on Mount Tepe-

century of the Holy Virgin of
Guadalupe to an humble peasant
named Juan Diego. The Virgin
of Guadalupe later became the
patroness‘ of Catholic Mexico,
and, in time, emerged as the

symbol of the faith of the Mexi-.

cans, becoming identified with
the. freedom movement of that
people.

Representing the Holy Virgin
on the parade float was Rose

Zambia‘-Tanzania Rail Link -Proposed
Copper-rich Zambia proposes a 1,000-mile rail link with newly

independent Tanzania to permit shipment of copper to Europe
and the U. S- from the port of Dar Es Salaam (see map). Zambia

wishes to avoid using existing rail line through white-supremacist,
Southern Rhodesia and the P-ortugese colony of Mozambique to the

Port -of Beria.

. Zambia fears white-supremacist neighbors to the south may‘

raise freight rates on copper shipments as tensions with Southern
Rhodesia and Mozambique increase. The proposed alternate route
would pass through all‘-African states. ’

Problems -of ﬁnancing are formidable, with the cost of the
proposed, line estimated at $200 to $300 million. But, declares

_ Zambi'an'Presid‘ent Kenneth Kuanda, “This railroad must and will-

be built, no matter who provides the financing.” Zambia and
Tanzania have set up a- joint committee togstudy the economic and
engineering aspects of the project “in the shortest possible time.”

se Discussion on Mine Safety

 
  

 

Debate in the House of Representatives on Sept. 2 prior to passage of the Metal and Nonmetallic
-_ -Mine Safety bill (HR 8989) was lopsided in favor of the measure. Only Congressman Lawrence J.
Burton (R-Utah) spoke in opposition. Excerpts from some of the speeches on the floor are given

below:

Elmer Holland

Elmer Holland (D-Pa_.), Select Subcommittee Chairman: 
to the hard work, year after year, that has been put "in by representatives of workers in the mining
industry, to keep the plight of these workerscontinuously before the Congress untileffective Fed-
eral legislation could be enacted. . . . We are hearing from those who tell us that the individual
worker has no need of organized representation and that the union member receives little or nothing
in return for his dues. But, as we consider this bill today, I know that the workers in our mines rec-

case for health and safety legis-
lation to the Congress.

“The American miner learned
long ago that he could not af-
ford to stand alone, unorgan-
ized, waiting humbly for what-
ever modest improvements in
his condition he might perhaps
be granted, sometime in the
hazy future, by powerful eco-
nomic interests which had

Elmer J. Holland
(Dem.-Pa.)

everything to gain by maintain-
ing the status quo. And I will
say, in all candor, that if the
miners had not learned this les-
son of organization, but instead
»had remained in the fragmented
and unrepresented state which

. we still find among the workers

of so many American indus-
a great
doubt in my mind that even to-
day the Congress would have
reached a position of being able
to enact the constructive, hu-
manitarian, long-needed bill we
have before, us.”

James G. O'Hara
James G. O’Hara (D-Mich.),
who chaired. the hearings: “Un-
doubtedly, every one in this
Chamber today is aware that

~ mining is an unusually danger-

/

ous occupation. I do not believe,

-g,;;;.,;,i;,,§._1owever, that everyone fully

realizesgjust how dangerous this
occupation is. The tragic fact,
Mr, Chairman, is that seven out
of every hundred underground

metal-miners are killed, in work .

accidents, during the course of
their. working lifetime.
“Let me re-emphasize this

‘shocking statistic. Of each. one

hundred, young men who enter

(into aplifetime career as an

 underground metal miner, no

. less than seven of them can..ex-
.p;e’ct' "to die _in on-the-job, ~-acci-3'
‘ they:.reachj normal

I wish to pay a brief tribute

, ognize how much it has meant to them to be represented by unions who have untiringly argued their

ment, seated in the executive
offices of an operating mine,

and concerned, as they under--

standably are, with reducing
costs» to meet competition, to
reluctantly consider the neces-
sity of installing expensive safe-
ty equipment. It is quite another
thing to be a mine laborer,
working hundreds of feet under-
ground, facing the possibility

V of sudden and hideous death.

“Put yourself in the position
of having 10 million tons of dirt
cave in on you, or of having a
hundred-foot ladder collapse un-
der your feet, or of seeing your
companion blown to bits in a
gas explosion, or of being need-
lessly exposed to cancer-pro
ducing radon gas in a uranium
mine.

"Considerations of humanity
and decency require that we
take" all reasonable steps to
avoid these tragedies. In‘ my
opinion, HR 8989 is such a rea-
sonable step.” '

James G. Fulton

James G. Fulton (R-Pa.):
“The operators h.ave maintained
that the States are doing a good
job and should be left alone.
The hearings held by the Select
Subcommittee on Labor in the
87th Congress, under the chair-
manship of Representative Her-
bert Zelenko, and the recent

‘hearings held under the guid-

ance of Representative James
O’Hara, shows the weight of
the evidence produced is in the
other direction, for it proves
that more than a few States
have not faced up to the prob-
lems confronting
safety of the miner must be
placed first by our U. S. Con-
gress just as the families,

ers place it first. ; . . ~
“Thefailure of the American
Mining Congress to endorse HR
8989 is to be deplored, inas-
much as they depend on the
States in face of all the evidence
that the States have not been
equal to the task. This continued
opposition does not make any
sense, except that a pessimistic
philosophy is depended on, ‘ac-

them. The -

.widows, and orphans of the min-

-petitive with mines

This need not be true under
modern, efficient conditions. ‘

“. . . While I am disturbed
by the opposition of this indus-
try to HR 8989, preferring in-
stead to see labor and manage-
ment united where safety is con-
cerned, the facts in this case
are clearly on the side of safe-
ty, regardless of any one group’s
opposition.”

Arnold Olsen

Arnold’ Olsen (D-Mont.): “I
was born and raised in the min-
ing community of Butte, Mont.
I have worked in the mines, and
I have strong convictions about
what must be done to guard the
health and safety of the miners.

“. . . Mr. Chairman, the State
Safety programs are" just not
adequate. Little provision is

made for safety education. Some

‘Arnold Olsen ‘
(Dem.-Mont.) 

employers have outstanding pro-
grams, others virtually none.
“The arguments against more
strict State safety regulations
were always, have always, and
still are always thatlocal mines
would then no longer be com-
in other
States, or mills in other States.
“Now, that is‘, I think, one of
the real basic, . justifications for

cidents will always happen.’ Federal mine safety regulations,

so that employers of mines and
mills throughout the States will
have uniform regulations to live
up to, and so they will have uni-
form costs. With this program,
there will not be discrimination
among the States and among
the employers in this field.

“Mr. Chairman, the facts and
figures of the Udall report can-
not be ignored. America cannot
tolerate the present system of
mine safety legislation, and our
miners must be assured of a
reasonable protection in their
work.”

Claude Pepper

Claude'Peppe-r (D-Fla. ): “After
years of futile effort to have the
states improve their mine safe-

_'ty codes and bring some degree

of safety to the miners through
thorough inspections and train-
ing, the attempt failed. This ex-
perience can be summed up as
follows:

“1. The several “States have
failed to enact systems of in-
spection and mine safety codes
that adequately assure protec-
tion to the miners who work in
the metallic and nonmetallic
mines.

“2. Where there are mine .

safety laws in the respective
States, they invariably suffer
from lack of enforcement, at

‘ least in some of the States.

“3. The mine safety codes or
regulations in the several states
vary greatly as to requirements

such as (a) qualificationsfor in- _.
spector, enforcement power-’» to

close the mine, and (b) fcorn-~~
pulsory inspection. . . '.  
' . “4. Appropriations by State

legislatures toenforce the codes
and provide for inspections are
by and large totally inadequate.

‘.‘5. Trained, competent State
civil service personnel are al-
most nonexistent. Positions such
as inspector are given out to the
members of the party which
controls the Governor’s office
or they run for the job on" ‘a bal-
lot. x

“6. The State mine inspection
procedures are too weak on ex-
ecution to insure a standard of"
safety.”

Edward R. R’oy‘bal

Edward R. Roybal (D-Calif.):
“Safety inspectors in some
States are political appointees
who do not have to meet educa-
tional or technical safety train-
ing standards, or mining experi-
ence requirements. F u r t h e r-
more, there is no" law to permit
Federal mine safety inspectors
to enter and inspect these mines
or require corrections in dan-
gerous conditions.

“The glaring gaps in the pres-

 
  
  
  
 
 
  
 
 
  
  
    
      
        
    

ent hodgepodge of good and bad
State safe-ty provisions reveal
the great need for a single over-
all uniform standard of educa-
tion, inspections, and enforce-
ment of regulations for health
and safety in these mines.
"‘Mr. Chairman, this legisla-
tion would provide the basis for
such a fair and impartial Fed-.
eral law to. be applied and en-

forced in a uniform manner in

all the States. .

“For that reason, I want to
take this opportunity again to
express my support for HR 8989'

as a most worthwhile effort to"

provide, for the first time in
the Nation's history,
framework within which to pro-

mote the cause of health and ‘

safety for the workers in Ameri-

ca’s metal and nonmetallic

mineral industries.”

George F. Senner _
George F. Senner (D-Ariz.)':
“Mr. Chairman, I intend to vote-
for HR 8989 because the-re is a
need for this legislation. Com-

ing as I do from the State of
Arizona, I am no stranger to
the ,accid__ent and fatality rates
in mining especially where cop-
per, uranium, gold, silver and
other minerals are concerned.

“I availed myself of the privi-
lege of filing a statement with
the select subcommittee on la-
bor of the House Committee on
Education and Labor when the
subcommittee was holding hear-
ings _on HR 6961 and similar
bills. _

“ . . . As far as I am con-

cerned, this report shows the .

need once and for all for the-
present legislation that we have

under consideration today. HR:
8989, in my opinion, will blaze "
a new trail in the field of ‘mine -.

safety. . . .”

' Compton I. White
Compton I. White (D-Idaho)-:

V “I believe that probably more

than any other Member of this
Congress, I can speak on the

subject of mine safety, having-
worked myself in underground-
