statisticians. The leading industries are entirely unable to lead
toward amelioration of the crisis, but instead lead toward a deep-
ening and widening of the crisis. The cumulative eﬁects of all
these ups and downs is a persistent though uneven decline of
economy as a whole. The unevenness of development of various
branches of industry is sharpened, the stability of their relations
one to another still more upset, and the crisis as a whole is in-
tensiﬁed.
Unemployment Grows

7. The development of unemployment is not to be measured
only by the development of the economic crisis. Capitalism al-
ways has its industrial reserve army, an army of‘ unemployed.
Already before the economic crisis this army was tremendously
enlarged as a result of speed-up and rationalization. To this
army have now been added the millions thrown upon the streets
by the economic crisis and curtailment of production. On the
other hand, permanent unemployment is, in turn, now being in-
tensiﬁed to an unheard of degree by a new wave of speed-up and
rationalization, which is spurred on by the economic crisis. Thus
even local and temporary increases in production of certain in-
dustries (steel, auto) are not reﬂected in corresponding increases
in employment, but are the occasion for further cutting down of
labor forces by the speed-up, by an increase in permanent unem-
ployment. Thus the struggle against unemployment is organically
linked up with the struggle against capitalist rationalization; the
problems of the unemployed are intertwined with those of the
employed; and the workers are faced with the issues of class
struggle-—-class against class——in all their nakedness.

Breakdown of Reformist Illusions

8. The results of» the economic crisis not only destroy ‘the
reformist illusions with which the bourgeoisie attempted to deceive
and pacify the workers (American prosperity and “high wages”)
(theory of “exceptionaIism,” “organized capitalism,” etc.) but
continually accelerates the narrowing of the very social basis of
reformism. The offensive of the bourgeoisie, already begun
prior to the development of the economic crisis, is now accentu-

ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL SITUATION 9

ated by increasing wage cuts and speed-up in the factories,
aﬁecting not only the unskilled and semi-skilled workers, but also
sections of the skilled. All of these developments are rapidly
giving rise to sharper and sharper class struggles. With the rapid
development by the bourgeoisie of fascist repressive measures,
the struggle is rapidly -assuming more and more of\ a political
character. By accelerating the process of the concentration of
capital and the impoverishment of sections of the middle and
petty-bourgeoisie, by increasing the proletarianization of the

‘ masses of peasantry, the economic crisis thus intensiﬁes all the

social contradictions of American capitalism. The sheer economic
weight of the crisis tends to effect a political awakening of the
proletarian masses. A revolutionary upsurge grips the working
masses, opening the road to the Communist Party for organizing
and leading these masses into struggles. The revolutionary up-
surge of the working masses of the United States is evidenced
by the growing unemployment demonstrations (the national re-
sponse of almost a million and a quarter workers on March 6) ;
by the growing political character of the actions of the workers
in strikes and demonstrations (March 6, Haiti and Mexico dem-
onstrations, etc.) ; by increasing militancy of the workers in re-
sisting the violent suppression of strikes and demonstrations (the
historical struggle in the South, centering around the Gastonia
case) ; by the tremendous outpouring of ﬁfty thousand workers
to the funeral of Steve Katovis, killed by the police on the picket
line; by the mass interest in revolutionary trade unionism, and
growing movements for organization, especially in the South and
in basic industries; by the rapid growth of the Communist Party
in membership and inﬂuence. Under these conditions, the detailed
and fundamental work of -mobilizing the masses for resistance
against rationalization and wage cuts and for unemployment relief
campaigns, the organization of revolutionary trade unions, the
strengthening and building of our Party, become the all over-
shadowing tasks.
Crisis in Agriculture

9. Agriculture, already in a chronic crisis since I920, has been
especially deeply affected in the last months. The vast unem-

ployment and general wage cutting for those employed has
sharply curtailed the mass consumption of agricultural products.
Producers of crops for the world market (cotton, wheat) are
faced with the most catastrophic decline in prices. Wheat dropped
one-third in price since last August. Cotton dropped 25 per cent
during the past year, and I2 per cent during the last two months.
At the beginning of the year already the U. S. Department of
Agriculture is publicly advising the farmers to curtail their pro—
duction this year by I 5 per cent, which gives an indication of the
extent of already visible curtailment of the market. In January
it was estimated, on the basis of the then-prevailing prices, that
prospective farm income for 1930 had shrunk by more than a

,billion dollars. The effect of this is, of course, not conﬁned to

agriculture; for industry it is equivalent in eﬁect to the loss of
the same amount in foreign markets. Agriculture is thus hard
hit by the crisis and then in turn contributes heavily to the deep-
ening of the crisis, preparing a fertile ﬁeld for the extension of
our Party inﬂuence and organization among the poor farmers, and
the mobilization for common struggle with the revolutionary
working class. p

IO. The past failure of the Party to do any work among the
agrarian masses is the outgrowth of an indefensible under-
estimation of that work. , The Party has failed to respond on the
rapid industrialization of farming, especially fruit growing and
truck farming, which has led to the transformation of the farmer
migratory worker into a semi-industrial agricultural worker. The
California district of our Party especially is obligated to work
among these workers and to drive the roots of our Party into that
category by organizing Party nuclei among them. The possibil-
ities of such work were clearly demonstrated in the Imperial Val-
ley strike. Similar work must be done in the sugar ‘beet industry
of Colorado and Michigan, and also in the dairy farms surrounding
big cities, largely run by wage labor. ,

Another important agrarian base‘ for Party work are those sec-
tions like in the metal mining regions of Northern Minnesota and
Michigan, the coal mining regions of Illinois, Kansas and In-
diana, and sections of the newly industrialized South, where the

connection between the industrial proletariat and the agrarian
masses is very close. Especially in strikes in these‘ territories,
the organization of relief work for the strikers among the farm-
ers of these territories can be carried on with a view of estab-
lishing a close organizational bond between the industrial workers
and poor farmers. ’

'- Development of Fascism

II. In the political ﬁeld, American capitalism is rapidly devel-
oping outspoken fascist methods of government. This manifests
itself in three main groupings of forces: First, the direct mobil-
ization of' the heads of ﬁnance capital and their immediate class

T representatives in (a) super-governmental organs, imposing their

will and direction from above upon the “democratic” apparatus
(Hoover’s National Business Council); (b) direct nomination
into key governmental positions of representatives of ﬁnance cap-
ital (Hoover, Mellon, Young, Morrow, Grundy, etc.); (c) con-
centration of -power in the hands of the executive and judiciarv_
and the systematic undermining of‘ the powers and prestige of
Congress. Second, the mobilization of the reformist organiza-
tions and elements, some of which (A. F .of L.) are outright fas-
cist, while others (Socialist Party, Muste group) cover their fas-
cist activities with pseudo—radical phrases. Third, the systematic
use of" declassed and criminal elements, of the organized under-
world, as sluggers and murderers of the working class organizers
and leaders. - '

Rationalization and mechanization of the process of production
are robbing the skilled workers of the value of their skill. The
reactionary leader of this section of the workers is trying to

-‘maintain the favorable position of this aristocracy of labor by

attempting to turn them into the shock troops of capitalism; That
is why they turn the labor unions from insruments of ,struggle
on behalf of the workers into instruments of rationalization
against the working masses and into fascist troops of capitalism.
The Socialist Party, as the representative of the petty shop keep-
ers, is trying to counteract the transformation of the petty shop
keeper intoa clerk of the chain store by organizing their forces
into social fascist troops of capitalism against the labor movement.

12 THl£SES AND RESOLUTIONS

Its labor union wing, the Muste group, facilitates the fascist ser-
vices of the A. F. of L. to capitalism by coveringthem with left
phrases. From Howat over Fishwick and Farrington to the
Peabody Coal Co., or from Schlesinger over the Tammany Hall
Governor to the dress manufacturers of New York is not a
greater distance than from Green and W011 and Lewis to the
Civic Federation and to the American State and War and Navy
Departments.

American Imperialism Prepares for War

12. As a result of the deepening and sharpening crisis, Amer-
ican imperialism is playing an increasingly aggressive role not
only in Latin America, the Philippines and China, but throughout
the entire colonial world. Under the pressure of the economic
crisis, which sharpens tremendously all imperialist contradictions
and rivalries, American imperialism not only intensiﬁes its eco-
nomic expansion, but the imperialist aggression of the United
States takes on more outspoken political and military forms.
American imperialism, thru its prominent spokesman, Owen D.
Young, openly announces its program not only towards the col-
onies, but for “economic integration of the world,” that is, strug-
gle for world economic domination. Under these conditions our
Party has especially the responsibility of assisting the revolution-
ary masses of the semi-colonial countries where U. S. imperialism
is most aggressive and which are in the very center of U. S.
imperialist policy (Latin America, the Caribbean area, etc.), and
particularly those in U. S. colonial possessions (Philippines, Vir-
gin Islands, etc.). This must include the utmost possible support

and the joint working out with the Communist Parties of these.

countries of their political and tactical problems and a clear un-
derstanding of changing class relationships.

I 3. American imperialism to an interesting extent leads and
directs the war preparations against the Soviet Union. American
imperialism was the promoter in the seizure of the Chinese-
Eastern Railroad by the Chinese militarists. Stimson’s note of
December 2nd was an open attempt to create a united front of
the capitalist world for a military attack on the Soviet Union.

ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL SITUATION i I3

The very seizure of the Chinese Eastern Railway was itself a stra-
tegic military maneuver against the Soviet Union. American
imperialism is feverishly working to build a msilitarist wall around
the boundaries of the Soviet Unon. In trying to ﬁt Germany
more intimately into the anti-Soviet bloc, it is attempting to

smoothen out the contradictions of the interests between Poland I

and Germany. French imperialism conducts a ﬁerce and pro-
vocative campaign against the Soviet Union and mobilizes her

pvassal border’ states for war against the U.S.S.R. The “Labor”

Government of MacDonad in Great Britain, servile lackeys of the
imperialist bourgeoisie, prepares a new diplomatic break with the
Soviet Union. The internationally organized campaign against
the so-called persecution of religion in the Soviet Union is un-
precedented in its counter-revolutionary fury, class hatred, world-
wide extent and offensive forms, and is a direct ideological prepa-
ration for an armed attack against the Soviet Union by the capi-
talist class. The Pope, the British Arch-Bishops, Protestant
churches, Jewish ralbbis, the Salvation Army, all religious sects,
all peddlers of religious opium, were mobilized for the defense
of the Russian Kulaks, thus giving a clear example of the inter-
national imperialist united front of cross and cannon against the
Soviet Union. The class content of this campaign was the de-
fense of the kulaks and nepmen—the last trench of capitalism
in the Soviet Union being destroyed by the advance of Socialism.
At the same time these campaigns had the immediate strategic
aim to ideologically stir up the peasantry of Poland, Rumania,
Czecho-Slovakia, etc., who are the bulk of the armies to be used
in the war against the Soviet Union. One of the revolting details
of this campaign was that aping exactly in method and content
the campaign of the bourgeoisie, the Trotskyites came forward
with the same campaign about the “horrors” and “murders” of
the C.P.S.U_., playing the miserable role of the camrp-follower
running after the war chariot of imperialism.

In view of this growing danger of war, the Communist Party
must carry thru an intensive and continuous campaign for the
popularization of Lenin’s teachings on the struggle against war,
propagating the slogan of the transformation of imperialist war

I4 ‘ THESES AND RESOLUTIONS

into civil war, the defeat of “our own” capitalist government,
for the overthrow of “our own” bou eoisie. '
Q .

Political Struggles of the Workers

14. The growing diﬁﬁculties of capitalism cause the American
capitalist class to recognize in every workers’ struggle a direct
attack upon the capitalist system. Therefore, even the smallest
strike of workers for decent working conditions is met with the
whole State force of capitalism. Sheriffs and State troops against
the Illinois miners; police, courts and State governments against
the needle, the food, the shoe workers in New York; police and
deputized mill thugs against the textile workers in Carolina; in
short, every economic struggle is turned into a political event
against which the capitalist class mobilizes its full State power.
It is the foremost political task of the Party to help the workers
to draw correct conclusions from this fact. The Party must in
every strike formulate the political problems of the struggle into
deﬁnite political slogans and demands. It must organize demon-
strations, petitions, referendums, etc., for these demands. On the
basis of these demands it must lead the workers into municipal,
State and national elections’, making the Communist Party the
leader and organizer of a broad united front from below for
mass political struggles. T-he economic demands of the workers
must -be related and linked up with the political campaigns of the
Party in such a manner that the workers recognize in these polit-
ical campaigns a struggle for the same aims for which they battle
in their strikes. Especially important at this moment of ration-
alization and unemployment are demands for unemployment relief
and for social insurance measures in general. Mass campaigns
for such measures must be organized in every District. These
campaigns must employ all forms of political struggle. While
efforts must be made to prevent deterioration into mere parlia-
mentary campaigns, nevertheless all of‘these political campaigns
must lead up to mass mobilization for the coming Congressional
elections. In these elections the Party must make efforts to enter
candidates in every Congressional District. Every municipal elec-
tion campaign must be made by the Districts into political rally-

ing centers of the workers for the struggle against police brutal-
ities in strikes, against fascism, against capitalist corruption, etc.
Propaganda for\ political mass -strikes must be made systematic-
ally. Great political demonstrations such as May Ist, or August
1st, must !be organized in the form of political mass strikes.

Question of Labor Party

I 5. The organization of revolutionary political action of the
working masses is the most ‘important immediate objective of the
political activities of our Party. In the past our campaign to this
end was centered around the slogan “For a Labor Party.” This
slogan no longer supplies a basis for this campaign. Any Labor
Party crystallization at this moment could have only the AF L
unions, the Socialist Party and other social-reformist organiza-
tions as a-basis, or would be composed only of those already in
sympathy with the Communist Party. A Labor Party made up
of social-fascist organizations would not mean political separation
of the workers from the capitalists but would mean the delivery
of the workers to capitalist politics under the guise of a Labor
‘Party. The radi-calization of the working masses which leads
deﬁnitely to an ideological separation of the workers from the
capitalists turns the Labor Party slogan into a possible instrument
with which capitalism can attempt to delay this separation.

Organizing United Front From Below

16. Our Party is suﬁering from a decided disproportion be-
tween its organized strength and the mass activities which it
initiates and leads. The readiness of great masses of workers
to follow our Party has led to a most serious underestimation
of the value of organization. The reliance on spontaneous re-
sponse in many instances replaces systematic hrganizational pre-
parations. As a result, the Party fails in a large measure to
crystallize into permanent organized strength the broad mass
movements led by it.

A decisive change "of these practices must be initiated at once.
Reliance on the spontaneity of the masses must be replaced by

 

I6 THESES AND RESOLUTIONS

most systematic united front organization from below. (a) In
the preparations for May 1st, for August 1st, for election cam-

paigns, etc., detailed plans must be workediout by all districts for p

an organized mass mobilization of the workers primarily on the

V basis of shops. The committees thus established in the shops

must be made to report their activities to the workers in the
shops and to central leading bodies. The Committees of Action
and special committees for May Day preparations, etc., must
gradually broaden out and take on a permanent form: the basis
of a trade union organization in the shops. (b) The systematic
‘mobilization of the workers for mass movements must permit
the greatest initiative and broadest participation in leadership of
the -best non-Party elements among the masses, thereby bringing
to the forefront the most energetic, the ablest, and most militant
elements among the non-Party workers who must be won for
membership in the Party.

Reliance on spontaneous response is also prevalent in the non-
Party mass organizations such as International Labor Defense,
Workers International Relief, etc. As a result they lack organ-
ized substance. Their strength is more sentiment than material.
The Party will never .be able to do its duty in the new situation
confronting it if the Communists will not effect an immediate
and radical change in the methods of work and organization in
these bodies.

Building a Mass Party

I7. The recent recruiting campaign has improved considerably
the social composition of the Party. With the large number of
new workers taken in it is unquestionably possible to organize
a number of new shop nuclei. But in spite of that the great
majority of the basic units of the Party still remain, as street
nuclei. As long as our Party is not anchored in the industrial
establishments of the country, we cannot claim to be a Bolshevik
Party. Every district is therefore obligated to transform the
Party base systematically into one of shop nuclei. VVithin the
year following the convention, over 40 per cent of the Party mem-
bers must be organized into shop nuclei. To achieve this aim
every District Committee must work out plans for systematic

, ___.;,,.._._-...,.,.,,.  A, ., 

ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL SITUATION 17 .

work in a number of selected shops and industries and must con-
centrate the Party forces on this work. The Organization De-
partment of the C. C. must supervise and direct carefully this
campaign. The Party press must be used to urge, criticize, and
lead this work and to stimulate revolutionary competition between
the districts. “Into the Shops” must be the guiding slogan in the
Party-building campaign. _

18. The recruiting campaign was the ﬁrst serious test of the
Party after the Communist International Address. The Party
stood the test. It proved, ﬁrst, that it had succeeded in thor-
oughly liquidating factionalism and organized opportunisrn; and
second, that this made membership in the Party more desirable
for the revolutionary workers. The CI Address was thus fully
justiﬁed in its statement that the liquidation of factionalism will
be a boom to the building of the Party. It has improved the
social composition of the Party because 90 per cent of the new
recruits are industrial workers. It has also considerably raised
the percentage of Negro members in the Party since nearly 20
per cent of the new recruits are Negroes.-

The recruiting campaign, however, also suffered from basic
weaknesses. It was not based primarily on organized recruiting
activities of the nuclei. The members were recruited in mass
meetings, etc., and then assigned to the nuclei. There are shop
nuclei in New York, Chicago and elsewhere that have not re-
cruited one single new member. This weakness of the drive, if
not repaired, will prevent the Party from assimilating and keeping
the new members. It is therefore imperative that the political
activization of the nuclei be made the ﬁrst aim of all work in the
districts. Inactive nuclei cannot utilize the revolutionary spirit
of the new recruits but rather tend to paralyze them._ Without
the political activization of the nuclei, the Party cannot be trans-
formed into one of revolutionary action.

Building a Mass Party

19. The transformation of our section of the Communist In-
ternational into a mass Party of revolutionary’ action demands
the activization of every member of the Party.’ Party members

I8 THESES AND RESOLUTIONS

who remain passive in the face of the rapidly increasing duties
of the Communists in the present period are not revolutionaries
and have no room in the Party. -At this period of struggle, Right
elements will seek to remain in the Party by concealing their
Right tendencies. These elements must be uncovered not mechan-
ically but by self—criticism. The very adaptation of the Party
to its revolutionary tasks will weed out the unﬁt and unworthy.
To this end every leading Party committee shall immediately
organize a careful overhauling of the Party subdivision under its
direction. The overhauling shall achieve an adjustment of the
functioning of the Party in accord with the needs of‘ revolution-
ary action. The following steps shall be taken:

(a) Every single member of the Party must be assigned spe-
ciﬁc work in the Party and in proletarian mass organizations. The
nucleus executives shall direct and check up the work of every
Party member.

(b) The functioning of every committee, committee member
and Party members must be checked up continually.

(c) Ruthless political criticism of all errors and deviations
must provide the base for serious and continuous self—correction.

(d) Committees and functionaries who persist in errors and
deviations must be removed from the leading cadres as unﬁt for
leadership in this period. '

(e) The practice of’ burdening active comrades with a mul-
tiplicity of functions must be discontinued.

(f) The shortage of forces thus created must be repaired by
a systematic drawing of new proletarian elements into the lead-
ing cadres of the Party.

(g) All leading Party committees are obligated to be most
concrete in their plans and instructions for work to the lower
units. Unclearness, ambiguity and generalization lead to mis-
understanding and to delays in the carrying out of instructions.
The need of the hour is clarity of instructions and promptness
of execution. '

ECONOMIC'AND POLITICAL SITUATION I9

The Daily Worker.

20. To succeed in the full mobilization of the Party for its
tasks the Central Committee must pay special attention to the
press and primarily to the Daily Worker. In order to make the
Daily Worker the political leading organ of the Party and at the
same time an effective mass agitator and organizer, it is necessary
to take steps immediately for the political improvement of the
Daily ‘as well as for the building of a mass circulation. The
Political Committee must take immediate steps to terminate the
apparent political separation of the Daily from the leadership of
the Party and must turn the Daily into its daily organ and mouth-
piece. At the same time care must be taken to transform the
Daily into a national paper. This can be done only if the District
Committees and District Organizers consider in every campaign
the role which the Daily has to play in it. Every campaignplan
must include a speciﬁc press campaign to be carried ‘through bv
the District in the Daily Worker. The District Committees are
obligated to stimulate and organize systematically workers cor-
respondents from the industrial establishments in their territories.
By these methods the Daly will become truly a leader and an in-
strument in the national campaigns of the Party. This political
preparation will also prepare the way for the organization of a
mass circulation. Every District must set itself the aim of estab-
lishing a paid circulation or daily paid distribution of the Daily
Worker in an amount exceeding ﬁve times the number of Party
members in the district. To achieve this aim the Central Com-
mittee shall make available for the Districts the mutual experi-
ences and methods of distribution of the different Districts. The
present circulation drive is the ﬁrst step in carrying out this task.

. Build Revolutionary Trade Unions

21. The working masses, who areibecoming increasingly rev-
olutionary in the economic crisis, cannot be embraced organiza-
tionally by the Party alone. La-bor organizations of a wider char-
acter must be set into motion by the ‘Party. The primary organ-

izations for this task are the revolutionary unions with their -

 

x
20 THESES AND RESOLUTIONS’
shop committees, unemployed councils and committees of action,
organized in the TUUL. The Party can win the working masses
for its political leadership only -by leading them in their economic th‘
struggles; and only on the basis of the Trade Union Unity League la
will the Party be able to assume the leadership of these economic m‘
struggles. The Party must therefore make a sharp turn in its to'
trade union activities. A full mobilization of all Communist forces th
must be carried through for the organization of the unorganized or
masses, for the building of the Trade Union Unity‘ League. The of
T.U.U.L. must be made into an organization uniting the broad
masses of workers, organizing them for the struggle of their daily
interests, and leading that struggle along political lines. Through th
these struggle for their daily interests and through the organi- 6“
zation of the workers for that struggle, the T.U.U.L. will bring r 5h
the broad masses to an understanding and acceptance of Com-
munist line, strategy and tactics. Being a school of revolutionary «' st,
struggle for the broad working masses, the T.U.U.L. becomes a Sh
lever and the main reserve for the Party. All Communists must . St,
belong to the T.U.U.L. There they must carry out the most . W,
fundamental task of the Party, that of creating and ever strength-
ening a wide mass base for the Party in the factories, thus de- 3’ th
veloping it into a mass "Party. V th
The leadership of the Party in the T. U. U. L. must be assumed , U,
and maintained by the Communists through their activities as the ‘ W]
most energetic members, the best ﬁghters and the leaders in the ; th
economic struggles of the workers.  , tic
REVOLUTIONARY STRIKE STRATEGY 
22. The recent economic battles have shown that the revolu- L
tionary unions and the T. U. U. L. are as yet totally unprepared T be
organizationally and politically to fulﬁll their tasks. This was . Tl
especially demonstrated in the Illinois miners’ strike where the m.
weaknesses of the union, of the T. U. U. L. and of the Party {1-
showed the imperative necessity of a decisive turn in our work in V to
this ﬁeld. This turn can be accomplished only if there is clarity ' P;
in the Party in regards to the tasks of the T. U. U. L. and its P;
function in leading and organizing the economic struggles. T sy

ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL SITUATION 21

The Illinois strike revealed:

(a) Failure to prepare in time for the strike on the part of
the union, a failure to carry on preliminary agitation and organi-
zation, ‘a failure to set up committees of action, and of electing
mass strike committees from below; therefore the union failed
to draw the masses _into direct participation and leadership of
the struggle. Even in some cases, where pit committees had been
organized spontaneously by the workers themselves, the officials
of the union dissolved them-.

(b) The union not only lagged behind the militant masses in

I the strike, -but actually obstructed the spreading of it and clamp-

ened the spirit of the masses by the pessimism of its own leader-
ship.

(c) The union failed to formulate clearly a set of concrete
strike demands and to popularize them among the miners, thus
showing a complete failure on the part of the union to under-
stand its task as the leader in the economic struggles of the
workers. ,

The T. U. U. L. on its part failed to appear as the leader of
the union. It was, therefore, unable to repair the weaknesses of
the union in battle. It acted primarily as a propaganda organ
unable and unwilling to take the responsibility and . leadership
where the union failed. This was manifested outstandingly in
the failure of the T. U. U. L. to supervise the union’s prepara-
tion for the strike, its failure to lead the activities of the Belle-
ville and Ziegler conferences and its failure to organize mass sup-
port for the strike among the working class.

The Party failed in this strike to mobilize all of its forces, to
become the real leader and to direct its members in the struggle.
The Party fractions worker haphazardly. The individual Party
members were not subordinated to the direction of the Party
fractions. The Party was not on the spot with sufﬁcient forces
to overcome the pessimism and obstructive activities of individual
Party members (Corbishley). Although the general line of the
Party was correct neither the Center nor the District gave the
systematic daily attention which this struggle required.

A While the Illinois struggle showed the weaknesses of the T. U.
U. L., of the revol-utionary unions and of the Party in the most
accentuated form, the same diﬂiculties presented themselves also
in a smaller degree in the other struggles, especially in that of
the Needle Trades, the shoe workers and the food workers.

-9 STRENGTHEN THE T. U. U. L.

23. All of the above shortcomings reveal as the outstanding
weaknesses:

(a) That our unions have not yet outlived their past of left
wings, and have not yet adopted themselves to the role of organ-
izers and leaders of the workers for the struggle for their immedi-
ate economic demands.

(b) Where they do appear as such, they hang on to the in-
heritance of the old trade union methods and tactics which are
specially characteristic in the elimination of the working masses
from active participation in battle:

(c) The absence of revolutionary cadres which are able to
carry through the aggressive and militant struggles required at
this ‘hour. In spite of formal acceptance of the line of the Fourth
Congress of the Red International ‘of Labor Unions and of the
tasks assigned by the Sixth Congress and the Tenth Plenum of
the Cornintern, no serious attempt has, as yet, been made to
carry this turn into action.

(d) Failure to carry on a sufficiently energetic struggle against
opportunism in the trade unions, and to take organizational meas-
ures in good time.

24. It is the duty of the Party to take all steps necessary to
bring about a change in the work and activities of the revolu-
tionary unions and of the T. U. U. L. This is its major political
task at this moment. To accomplish this task is the duty of the
whole Party. A thorough survey must be made of the conditions
of work of the T. U. U. L. in all sections of the Party and a de-
tailed and concrete plan of action must be worked out, to be
followed.

ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL SITUATION 23

(a) The defunct Party fractions in the T. U. U. L. and in
the revolutionary unions must be reorganized and must be con-
tinuously directed by the Party. Through these fractions the Com-
munists must insist upon a fundamental change in the work and
methods of the revolutionary unions and of the T. U. U. L.
Mass self—criticism and mass control in the carrying out of the
new methods must be applied.

(b) The Party press and especially the Daily Worker must

i ‘ be mobilized for the building and revolutionizing of the unions

and of’ the T. U. U. L. Especially the sections of “Party life”
and of “Workers Correspondence” in our Party press must be
mobilized for this purpose. Special attention must be paid by the
Party press to work of the Party in this ﬁeld through concrete
criticism and constructive suggestions. The whole Party and the
Party press must ruthlessly criticize all Party sections that lag
:behind in their work in this ﬁeld.

(c) The Party must pay major attention to the strengthening
of the Party cadres in the T. U. U. L. The Party must effect a
systematic redistribution of its forces in the Center and in the
Districts. This redistribution must be carried through on a scale
large enough to give a minimum guarantee of a serious change in
the work of the T. U. U. L. r

(d) In the campaign to strengthen and build the revolutionary
unions and the T. U. U. 7L. the Party members must be the most
energetic force. Through their fractions they must mobilize the
complete membership of the unions for the organization campaign
and must bear the brunt of the agitational and ‘organizational
tasks. The Party press and the Party apparatus must lend its
full support to this campaign and must mobilize all of its depart-
ments for this purpose. A

(e) The Party and its fractions must organize and train
worker correspondents for “Labor Unity” to help make this paper
a militant mass organ accepted by the masses of workers as its
spokesman and its leader. The Party fraction is obliged to work
for an immediate improvement of the leading staff of the paper.

25. The Party and its leading committees must immediately
initiate a most energetic campaign for the carrying out of the

 

24 . TH ESES AND RESOLUTIONS

resolutions of the Fourth Congress of the R. I. L. U. This re-
quires a deﬁnite campaign for a greater centralization and more
ﬁrm organization of the revolutionary unions. The loose locals

\ and the poor dues—collection system are ‘incompatible with strong
ﬁghting organizations. The loose organizational methods now
prevailing must be drastically remedied. There must be a more
intimate consolidation of the revolutionary unions with the Na-
tional Committee of’ the T. U. U. L. and the decisive strengthen-
ing of the latter’s national departments. A deﬁnite turn in all
plans of work in the revolutionary unions and in the T. U. U. L.
must be urged and carried through by the Communists. Special
efforts must be made to draw Negro workers into the leadership
of the revolutionary unions. Decided efforts must be made to
increase manifold the activities of the Communist fractions in the
reactionary trade unions. It is necessary that the Party pass very
deﬁnitely over from the period of talk to the stage of action in
the accomplishment of its tasks in the organization of the unor-
ganized masses. The progress of the Party on the road to a mass
Party of revolutionary action must be measured by the growth
of the organization and inﬂuence of the T. U. U. L.

WORK AMONG THE NEGRO MASSES

26. The building and the work of the Party cannot be eﬁec-
tive without a serious change in its attitude and practices in re-
gard to the work among the Negro masses and the transforma-
tion of passivity and underestimation into active defense and
leadership of the struggles of the Negro masses. The Party must
be made to express, in energetic action its consciousness that a

revolutionary struggle of the American workers for power is_

impossible without revolutionary unity of the Negro and white
proletariat. To achieve this unity and to win for Communist
leadership also the masses of Negro workers, the Party must root
out all traces of a formal approach to Negro work. The Party
program for Negro work must become a living guide for the

A widest activity among the Negro and white masses and partici-

pation in the struggles of the Negro masses.
The inﬂuence of white chauvinism is still felt in the Party and

 

< V‘| \u |U

ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL SITUATION 25

has recently manifested itself in‘ St. Louis (opposition in the frac-
tion to a correct Bolshevik line on Negro work) ; Detroit (oppor-
tunist reluctance in fraction to struggle against white chauvin-
ism); Chicago, (Lithuanian fraction). In many instances there
has been opportunist failure to expose such manifestations. Also
wrong, however, is the tendency, displayed by some Negro com--
rades (which they have since corrected more or less completely)
to surrender to the propaganda of the Negro bourgeoisie and petty
bourgeois intellectuals of race-hatred directed against all whites
without distinction of class.

Protest against the special oppression to which Negroes are
subjected must take the form of intensive political campaigns and
mass organization to ﬁght against lynching. Negro workers and
farmers persecuted on the basis of race discrimination must be
accepted and treated as class—struggle victims. The Party must
carry on an uncompromising -political struggle against all dis--
criminatory laws, such as laws legalizing disfranchisement, segre-
gation, laws against inter-marriage, etc.

SLOGAN OF SELF-DETERMINATION

27. The Party must organize a most intensive struggle around
the demand of social and poitical equality for Negroes, which is
still the main demand of‘ our Party in its work among Negroes.
At the same time the Party mvust openly and unreservedly ﬁght
for the right of Negroes for national self-determination in the
South, where Negroes comprise a majority of the population.
Self-determination for the Negro masses is the logical continua~
tion and highest expression of the struggle for equal rights (social
equality). As the Negro liberation movement develops it will,
in the territories and states with a majority of Negro population,
take more and more the form of a struggle against the rule of the
white bourgeoisie, for self-determination- Therefore, in its every

day struggles for the concrete issues of social equality, against

lynching, against all race discriminatory laws, the Party must
systematically advance the demand for the right of the Negroes
for self-determination. This demand must be popularized among

 

26 TTHESES AND RESOLUTIONS

the working masses of the whole country to win these workers for
the support of the struggle of the Negroes. A

28. Special propaganda must be carried on among the Negro
masses on the question of imperialist war, making full use of the
victimization of the Negro masses both in the colonies and in the
United States by the imperialist war makers who only plunge
the Negro masses deeper into slavery.

Unless our Negro program is concretized and energetically
pushed, the work of our Party in winning the majority of the
working class will be fruitless in the north as well as in the south.

WORK IN THE SOUTH

29. The industrialization of the «South, the proletarianization
of new masses under conditions of the most intense exploitation,
turns the South into an ever more important battleﬁeld of the class
struggle in America. This ﬁeld becomes doubly important be-
cause Negro oppression here reaches its most violent and extreme
forms, with _its widest ramiﬁcations embracing both industry and
agriculture. Southern white ruling class terrorism, directed against
both white and Negro workers, assumes particularly vicious forms
against the Negroes. The Party has, for years, completely neg-
lected the South and even after the important struggles in the
Southern textile ﬁelds has paid insufficient attention to this section.
Particularly has this been true in regard to the agricultural masses.
This is a most serious shortcoming which, if not at once cor-
rected, will be fatal to the realization of the Party objectives in
this period. The Communist International has correctly pointed
out that the Negro masses in the rural districts of the South are
not “reserves of capitalist reaction” as conceived of by Lovestone
and Pepper, but ‘potential allies of the revolutionary proletariat.

Our Party cannot function in the increasingly frequent mass

’ battles of the workers in the South without being rooted in the

working class there. The problem of Communist leadership of
mass struggles of Southern workers, therefore, is the problem of
building our Party in the South, of building it in those struggles
and of putting into living practice a truly Bolshevik line in regard
to the Negro question.

DEVELOPMENT or NEW FORCES

30. The inﬂux of thousands of new workers into our Party
and the rapidly extending activities of the Party raises a pressing
need for capable functionaries. The sharpening class struggle,
the unemployment crisis, the big struggles in every‘ ﬁeld of ac-
tivity make" it urgent to build up new cadres. A syste_m of bold
promotion must be instituted in the Party. Party units andcom-
mittees must systematically recommend the most promising com-
rades to the high bodies for promotion. A wide distribution of
all functions among the Party membership must assure develop-
ment and discovery of comrades with abilities. Full time func-
tionaries’ courses must be organized for the fall in New York,
Chicago and at least one othercenter. Wider application of col-
onization must make possible the discovery and development of
capable organizers. The problem of cadres is a major problem

' of the Party and demands systematic attention.

AGAINST OPPORTUNISM

:51. The development of new cadres, the full activization of

the Party, its Bolshevization, requires a relentless struggle against

the right danger. All right opportunist tendencies in the Party
become in the period of revolutionary upsurge of the working
class a most dangerous active force for capitalism. “The defense

of such right views which have been condemned by the Comin-
tern as an anti-Party tendency profoundly hostile to the interests
of the proletarian revolutionary movement, is incompatible with
membership in the Communist Party” (Tenth Plenum resolu-
tion). . Conciliatory tendencies toward right-wing opportunism
are merely trying to cover up the counter-revolutionary character
of the right deviations. Of these conciliators it must be demand-
ed, “That they openly and emphaticaly dissociate themselves from
the right deviations; that they conduct an active ﬁght not merely
in, words, but in deeds against the right deviations; that they
submit implicitly to all decisions of the Comintern and of its sec-
tions and actively carry them out. Failure to carry out any one
of these conditions will place the culprits outside of the ranks of
the Communist International.” (Tenth Plenum resolution.)

The roots of opportunism were very deep in our Party, as they
are deep in the American working class, and only the most con-
scious and stubborn struggles against every manifestation of op-
portunism, which is especially dangerous in the present period,
can preserve the revolutionary policy of our Party and guaran-
tee its continued healthy growth -as the leader of the class struggle
of the workers.

32. The Address of the Communist International to our Party
in May, 1929, awakened it to a full realization of the dangerous
opportunist factional situation within its ranks. The inner-Party
campaign based upon this address uprooted factionalism, consoli-
dated the Party and replaced factional clique rule by a collective
leadership. It began a process of “training of the Party in the
spirit of politics based upon principle, the training of cadres in
the spirit of honest proletarian, uncorrupt revolutionism, free
from false diplomacy and un-principled combinations” (Stalin).
The Trotsky—Cannon group and the Jilek-Brandler-Lovestone
group continue their struggle against the Soviet Union, against
the Communist International and the working class. But the po-
litical and economic developments in the Soviet Union and in
America, as well as in the rest of the world, have so obviously
proven the opportunist unprincipledness of their platforms that
they can no longer successfully appeal to revolutionary workers.

ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL SITUATION 29

Both of these groups are now integral parts of the capitalist anti-
Soviet front. The Party has decisively defeated them. There
is a danger, however, that our Party sees in them the sole em-
bodiment of the right danger. This tendency is wrong. Right
opportunism still manifests itself in our Party in its various ﬁelds
of action, especially in a general lagging behind the developing
mass movement of the working class. It raised its head in a
clearly social-democratic form in Superior, where Halonen de-
fends the thesis of class neutrality of the co-operatives with a
vicious struggle against the Party. In the language press, in the
language groups, remnants of feder-ationism still supplied power-
ful protection to serious opportunist tendencies (Rovnost Ludu).
The under-estimation of‘ radicalization still paralyzes Party work
and especially Communist activities in the trade unions. Oppor-
tunism in practice is apparent everywhere. This manifests itself
in:

I. Under-estimation and neglect of trade union work.

2. Inability and unwillingness of Communists in the trade
unions to get out of the rut of old trade union habits to revolu-
tionize the forms and the tactics of the economic organizations
of the workers. -

3. Formal acceptance of decisions, but laxity in execution.

4. Resistance of the language fractions to centralization and
to effective carrying out of Party campaigns in language mass
organizations; resistance of the language press to the campaigns
of the Party. I

These opportunist attitudes and practices result in halbitual pes-
simism which c’onstantly looks for reasons why things cannot be
done instead of looking for ways of how to do them.

33. Right wing under-estimations, because extensive in the
Party, manifest themselves also disastrously among the comrades
directly leading the work of -building the revolutionary unions.
In some instances these tendencies lead to passive resistance (auto
workers, N. Y. needle trades workers, Paterson silk campaign‘),
and in other active opposition (Illinois mine strikes, New York
shoe strike, New York dress strike, New Bedford strike) to the

 

30 THESES AND RESOLUTIONS

line of the Party. There are also marked tendencies not to put for-
ward political slogans in the economic struggle (Illnois miners’
strike, New York dress strike, etc.). Gross under-estimation of
the radicalization of the workers was expressed by the leadership
of the needle workers of Chicago. The theory that unemploy-
ment makes the organization of the revolutionary auto workers’
union exceedingly diﬂicult, if not impossible, is a deﬁnite under-
estimation of the role of the Red unions in the economic crisis.
The Party must liqudate the various manifestations of the right
danger in the trade union work.

Effective struggle against the right danger requires a simul-
taneous battle against the ultra—left sectarian tendencies, which
attempt to cover this opportunist unwillingness to set the masses
into motion and to lead them into battles with left phrases. These
tendencies are a drawback to the activities of the Party and are
especially hindering the struggle against the right danger and the
development of mass inﬂuence and leadership of our Party. These
tendencies are particularly strong in the Young Oommunist
League. . _

ORGANIZING THE YOUTH

34. Youth and children play an increasingly important. role in
production. Their organization and leadership in the proletarian
struggles of the present crisis are, therefore, a major problem. of
the Party. The capitalist class is using every form of ideological
political and economic pressure upon the youth to keep them out
of the stream of radicalization of the working class. But the
young workers feel with special sharpness the increased burdens
of rationalization. They are the immediate victims of the militar-
ization campaign (Coughlin Bill, militarization of bourgeois youth
organizations. etc.)

In the face-of’ this, revolutionary work among the youth, espe-
cially among the young workers in the shops is an indispensible
part of the Party’s activities to win the majority of the working
class. Anti—militarist work, a step-child in the- past, must be
organized and carried on methodically. Neglect of this work by
the districts must be considered a reformist avoidance of anti-
war work.

ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL SITUATION 31

The leading committees of the Party m.ust help the Young Com-

munist League in the concrete organization of the class struggle

campaigns among the young workers. This help must take the
form of political guidance as well as organizational support in
the building of the league and in the mobilization of the young
workers. Speciﬁc efforts must &be made to strengthen the Party
core in the League.

' To THE MASSES

35. The economic crisis in the United States has created a tre-
mendous problem for our Party. The capacity of the working
masses for mobilization, for organization and for struggle present
the Party with the problem of extending and developing its own
capacity accordingly. This requires, ﬁrst of all, an activization of
every single member of the Party. It requires a rapid Bolshev-
ization through continuo-us and constructive self-criticism and self-

correction; it necessitates systematic organization work to build ‘

the Party and to drive its roots into the basic industries. It de-
mands the broadest application of the united front tactic based up-
on the workers in the shops and formed for deﬁnite mass struggle
aims; it requires a rapid building up of revolutionary mass unions

and activiz-ation of these unions as ﬁghters for the daily interests’

of the workers. It demands closest attention to concrete detail
work which must turn our revolutionary theory and aim into a
revolutionary force against capitalism. » Build the Party! Build
the revolutionary unions! Mobilize the working class against
rationalization, against imperialist war, against imperialism!

 

Resolution on Building the Trade Union
Unity League

PART I.—-—G§ENERAL ANALYSIS

I. THE ROLE or THE PARTY

THE most fundamental task of our Party in mass work is the
~ building of the revolutionary unions of the Trade Union
Unity League into broad mass organs of struggle. The recent
communications of the Comintern and Proﬁntern have again laid
stress upon this elementary necessity. It is in this work that
there lies the key to the development of our Party into a mass
Communist Party.

The Party must develop a keen sense of responsibility for the
building of the revolutionary unions. It must play the leading
role in the Trade Unon Unity League, not by substituting itself
for the T.U.U.L. and actually taking over trade union functions,
but by ‘stimulating its entire membership through the fraction
system tobuild the revolutionary unions, to support them in their
activities and to give them correct political guidance. The only
way the revolutionary unions can grow into.powerf'ul mass organs
is by the most complete support of the Party. In successfully
building the revolutionary unions the Party lays the best basis
for its own recruitment and mass leadership.

2. THE FAVORABLE OBJECTIVE SITUATION

The deepening economic crisis presents an increasingly favor-

able objective situation for the development of the revolutionary.
unions and struggle. The employers intensify their oﬁensive
against the living and working standards of the working class.
Steadily the army of unemployed grows, despite all capitalist
propaganda to the contrary. The employers are systematically
carrying through wage cuts, particularly in the basic industries,

among the great masses of unskilled and semi-skilled workers.
They also develop a fresh wave of rationalization, which speeds
the workers ever faster and faster and throws fresh masses into
the army of unemployed. Working conditions in every respect
become worsened. Industrial accidents multiply. Occupational
sickness is on the increase. The age limit for workers in industry
steadily tends downwards. More and more the employers resort
to the use of State and extra—lega1 fascist methods of terrorism
wherever the workers attempt movements in defense of their
standards or for the establishment of irrnproved conditions.

The employers in their drive against the working class, have
developed the A. F. of L. le-adership into full—ﬂedged fascists.
With a narrowing down of their social base, by the whittling
away of the priviliged position of the labor aristocracy through
mechanization, speed-up, unemployment, etc., the A, F. of L.
leaders have developed into the most open champions of capital-
ism and the leaders in all of its violent attacks against the working
class. This is exempliﬁed afresh =-by innumerable developments
in recent months—the Hoover-A. F. of ‘L. “No Wage Advance”
agreement, the treacherous unionamzanagement-coovperation plans
in the South, the instigation of the clubbing of the unemployed
workers on March 6, the open fascist propaganda of Woll—Broach,
etc., and the widespread propaganda for war against‘ the Soviet
Union. It has been a mistake on our part that We did not sooner
clearly_ ‘analyze and characterize the open fascism of the
A. F. of 

The line of the S. P. Muste Wing of the trade unions is iden-
tical with that of the A. F. of L. leadership except that they-—the
social-fascists—cover up their fascism with bourgeois-radicalism
and left phraseology. Their especially dangerous role in the
present period is to hoodwink the awakening masses and to
hold them within control of the A. F. of L. leadership. The
Socialist Party Musteites are linked up politically and organiza-‘
tionally with the most corrupt elements in the A. F. of L. This is
exempliﬁed again by the united front of these elements together
with the bosses, police, etc., in the needle trades of New York and

' in the Illinois mining districts.

 

34 THESES AND RESOLUTIONS

Progress in the building of the Trade Union Unity League can
be accomplished only by the most relentless struggle" against the
A. F. of L.‘ leadership and particularly against the insidious
Musteites. This struggle must ‘be carried on not only in the

reformist trade unions, «but particularly amongst the great masses '

of unorganized workers.
In this situation of deepening economic crisis and sharpening
offensive against the workers by the employers, the State, and

their fascist and social-fascist allies, which constitutes an effort of .

the capitalist class to throw the burden of the economic crisis
upon the working class, the tempo of radicalization of the workers
is greatly accentuated. Evidences of this growing radicalizaton are
to be found in all directions—in the upheaval in the South, the
strikes, among the Illinois miners, needle workers, textile workers,
shoe workers, etc. But the most signiﬁcant manifestation of the
spreading wave of radicalization was the tremendous unemploy-
ment demonstrations of March 6. The size and militancy of this
great movement surprised even the most optimistic in our ranks.
There is still a tendency in the Party to underestimate the rad-
icalization of the masses, the penetration of the masses by our
slogans and the organizing capacity of the Party. The same tend-
ency also tries to limit radicalization only to the unemployed, thus
forgetting that radicalization of the whole working class is caused
not only by unemployment but by all contradictions of the present
period, sharpened by economic crisis, unemployment, wage cuts,
new speed—up, etc. The employed workers, lacking unions and
organized leadership, do not ﬁnd ready expression to their seeth-
ing discontent. The March 6th Demonstration must be under-
stood as a signal of the growing radicalization of not only the
unemployed but of the working class generally. It was also a
striking sign of the developing counter—oﬁ’ensive of the American
working class.

The. perspective confronting us is one of sharpening class
struggle. Not only the unemployed but also the employed will
ﬁght against the capitalist class in increasing masses, with more
militancy and with clearer political aims. The American indus-
tries will in the near future be the scene of many large and bitter

struggles. It is our historic task to give leadership in these great
impending struggles. That the workers will follow our revolu-
tionary lead when the Party, politically and organizationally, meets
the obligations of the situation, was brilliantly demonstrated on
March 6. But we can only secure this leadership- and give
maximum development to these struggles by the building. of the
revolutionary unions. Failure to ‘build and to lead them effec-
tively will sacriﬁce these masses to the treachery of the Musteite
misleaders and will prevent the development not only of the
T.U.U.L. but also of our Party. This is exempliﬁed among the
Illinois and anthracite miners, Marion, S. -C. ; Danville, Va., and
in the Boston shoe strikes, where the Musteites captured m-ass
leadership because of our mistakes and inactivity.

3. THE CRISIS OF Ci‘rRowTH IN THE T.U.U.L. V

‘(a) -The T.U.U.L. is altogether insufficiently prepared to fulﬁll
the great tasks now confronting it on all sides, of organizing and
leading the discontented masses of workers. The growth of the
organization has lagged far behind the development of radicaliza-
tion amongst the workers. The T.U.U.L. has not yet been able to
come forward as the real trade union organizer and leader of the
broad masses in such manner as, for example, our Party secured
the mass leadership on March 6. Although the T.U.U.L. enjoys
great and growing prestige because of the long ﬁght of the old
Trade Union Educational League, the excellent Cleveland
Convention, "the March 6 demonstrations, etc., it has been
unable suﬂiciently to crystallize this ideological influence, into deﬁ-
nite organization. Its various sections are weak numerically, are
loosely organized, and have very undeveloped leading forces.
The Trade Union Unity League must be deﬁnitely under~
stood to be in a crisis which is not a crisis of' organizational and
political regression, -‘but a crisis of ‘growth, disproportion between
insufﬁcient political and especially organizational growth on the
one hand, and the extremely favorable objective situation and

‘urgent necessities of the working masses on the other‘ hand.

The variouspnational unions of the T.U.U.L.’ are not growing
to correspond with the developing struggle situations in their re-

 

36 THESES AND RESOLUTIONS

spective industries. They do not properly or rapidly enough
develop as organs o.f struggle of the great masses. In the vari-
ous localities there exist few local councils of the T.U.U.L., and
for the main part these are as yet unable to do more than carry
on agitation and do not actually lead local struggles of the work-
ing class. Organization of shop committees in the industries is
not carried on in a systematic form. In a number of instances
almost total lack of understandng of the revolutionary role of
shop committees and how to organize them, is to be discerned. In
all its stages, the T.U.U.L. has as yet an entirely insufﬁcient organ-
izational character.

The T.U.U.L. is as yet only at the beginning of its transition
from an agitational minority in the old unions to the position of
an authoritative directing and organizing trade union center. It
is our great task to expand our present weak trade union center
of organization into a powerful mass revolutionary movement
capable of defending the economic interests of the workers. This
is a major task for which our whole Party must be mobilized.

THE CAUSES OF THE T.U.U.L. WEAKNESS

The basic cause for the failure of the T.U.U.L. to grow more
rapidly in the extremely favorable situation are: (a) Inadequate
mobilization of the Party and its sympathizers for the building
of the revolutionary unions; (1)) failure to [bring forward and
train new cadres of sufficient number and ability to supply Com-
munist leadership for our unions and meet the urgent demands
made by the radicalized masses upon the T.U.U.L. for leadership;
(c) serious Right opportunist errors by leading comrades in the
trade union work.

(a) The Party membership, which must be the heart, brain
and backbone of the T.U.U.L., has not yet been fully organized to
build the revolutionary -unions. This is exempliﬁed among other
manifestations by the fragmentary character of the recent Dis-
trict Conventions of the T.U.U.L., the failure to follow up the

sufficient building of local shop committees, failure to utilize the

great unemployment movement to strengthen the revolutionary
unions, etc. i

The explanation of the inactivity of the Party membership and
the close sympathizers of the Party_ in the building of the T.U.U.L.

is to be found in a lingering underestimation of the degree of .

radicalization and ‘(willingness to struggle of the workers, and a
minimizing of the effectiveness of strike action, and the pos-
sibility of organizing the unorganized into class struggle unions
during periods of economic crisis.

(b) The lack of sufficient leading forces who follow the cor-
rect revolutionary line is one of‘ the elementary reasons for the
weakness of the T.U.U.L. The problem of new cadres is a vital
problem: for the T.U.U.L., its revolutionary unions and for all sec-
tions of the Red International of Labor Unions. Our leadership
must be able to meet before the masses the trained cadres of the
fascist A. F. of L. unions and the social—f'ascist who ﬁght us with
the backing of the bourgeois State and defeat them. Agitational
ability is not enough. Our cadres must have Bolshevik clarity and
Bolshevik ability to organize workers. The working class is mak-
ing demands that we cannot supply. But there is no systematic
bringing forward of new militant elements and in some cases
bringing forward this major task. This is evidence of a survival
of bureaucracy and the most dangerous opportunism. This must
be eliminated by the most careful and energetic training of the
cadres. .

(c) Other serious right errors and tendencies have hindered
the work. Among these were: (1) Failure to bring the unions
and local leagues forward as revolutionary economic organiza-
tions ﬁghting for the every-day demands of the workers—the
tendency to conﬁne the organizations simply to revolutionary
propaganda groups; (2) failure to put forward political slogans
in the economic struggle (Illinois miners’ strike, New York dress
strike, etc.), and thus not to broaden politically the battles of the
workers; (3) systematic resistance to the development of new
cadres of leaders (needle trades, etc.) ; (4) persistence in trade
union legalism and craft practices’ (food, needle, shoe) ; (5) al-
most total lack of self-criticism, dilettantism in strikes and organ-

Introduction

The storm of the economic crisis in the United States blew
'down the house of cards of American exceptionalisrn and the
whole system of opportunist theories and illusions that had been
built upon American capitalist “prosperity.” Unemployment and
consequent misery of great masses of workers dissolved the
mirage of the ever—full dinner pail. Speed-up, and mechanization
of production tends to turn the factitious robot into a realistic
personiﬁcation of labor today.

These factors confront our Party with an entirely new situa-
tion and with completely new tasks. It was the purpose of the
Central Committee, in the following documents, to formulate these
tasks concretely, and to weld them into a program of action, for
our Party for the coming months. These documents represent
the unanimous proposals of the leadership of our Party to the
Seventh Convention.

These proposals are in complete harmony with the line of our
World Party—the Communist International.

They set up for the Party the goal of a minimum of achieve-
ments toward the establishment of the leadership of our Party
over a majority of the American working class. They signify a
complete liquidation of -the organized opportunist group of Love-
stone, Gitlow, Wolfe and Company, which had endeavored to
misuse the Sixth Convention of our Party for the support of an
internationally crystallizing opportunist group. They are a tes-
timonial to the healthful and invigorating inﬂuence of the Ad-
dress of the Communist International to our Party. A

The present Party discussion shall acquaint the Party with
this program; the forthcoming Seventh Convention shall mobil-

' ize the Party for this program; and in the months following,

the Party shall carry out this program as a most decisive step
toward the development of our Party into a Communist mass
Party of revolutionary action.

ization campaigns, gross underestimation of the -radicalization
of the workers (Feingold, Chicago). Theory that unemployment
makes the organization of the revolutionary unions exceedingly
difficult (Auto Workers’ Union). ‘

The strike strategy of the various T.U.U.L. unions has been sat-
urated with Right errors. It has been marked by a quite gen-

 

eral failure to apply the principles of independent leadership as

laid down by the RILU. There -has been almost no setting up

of shop committees, and action committees to draw masses into‘

the struggle. In some instances this failure was caused by passive
resistance (Auto workers, N. Y. ‘food workers, Paterson silk
campaign) and in others, active opposition (Illinos mine strike,
shoe strike, New York dress strike).

Besides all these right tendencies which constitute the main
danger in the trade union work, there were various rn-anifestations
of “left” sectarianisrn, abandonment of work in t=he reformist
unions, the putting forth of demands. for 40-hour week and aboli-

tion of piece-work in the New York shoe strike without a mass.

movement to support these demands, etc.

In the New York shoe strike, the demand for the 40-hour week
and abolition of piece-work, based upon the development of a
mass movement to organize the unorganized, was correct. But
it was incorrect that the District insisted upon these demands as
strike issues after the union leadership had failed to lay the
necessary basis, capitulated before the difficulties, and narrowed

‘_down the movement to a few shops.

The general result of this failure to fully mobilize our forces
and of these gross opportunist mistakes in carrying out the Party
line for building the revolutionary unions is the present critical
position of the T'.U.U.L. With a real mobilization of our forces
andta more correct general line in the work, unquestionably the
T.U.U.L., in spite of the ﬁerce opposition it has to meet, would be
very much more of a mass organization.

PART II——=OUR CONCRETE TASK‘S

I. MOBILIZATION OF THE PARTY

The Party must take up immediately with all its force thetask
of building the Trade Union Unity League; This requires the
most complete xpossilble mobilization of the Party membership and
Party sympathizers‘. There must be a strong ideological campaign
developed to liquidate opportunistic moods regarding the trade
union work and to ideologically strengthen the whole Party for
the vital tasks Of building the revolutionary unions. This ideologi-
cal campaign must be basically a struggle against the Right devia-
tion in the Party. It must lead not only to the education of the
general membership to thenecessity for trade union work, but
be directed particularly against those active in the trade union
work who display opportunistic tendencies. Where these leaders
fail to correct their systematic errors, they shall be removed and
replaced by new elements who can and will follow the Party
line. A

The question of greatly intensifying the Party trade union work
and the building of the revolutionary unions shall be put on the
ﬁrst order of business in every unit and stage of the Party.
Membership in the revolutionary unions shall be made compulsory
for all Party members. The Party fraction shall be systematically
built in the revolutionary unions and in the reformist organizations.
Competent comrades shall be everywhere delegated to carry out
the trade union work. Sapecial eﬁorts must be put forth to draw
the new members into active trade union work. The building
Of‘ the T.U.U.L. must be made an organic partof -all the mass
campaigns of the Party. There shall be prepared detailed di-
rectives for the building of the trade union fraction system and
the most thoro-ughgoing mobilization of the Party for building
the revolutionary unions.

2. DEVELOPMENT OF REVOLUTIONARY TRADE UNION CADRES

Fundamental in the strengthening Of the Party trade union
work and the building Of the T.U.U.L. is: the development of Our
revolutionary trade union cadres. There is a crying need in all

   
 

40 THESES AND RESOLUTIONS
the T.U.U.L. organizations for workers capable of organizing and
leading, the struggle. Not only is there a shortage of workers
for leading positions, but many who are now occupying such posi-
tions display Right-wing tendencies and other lack of qualiﬁca-
tions. The question of improving the trade union cadres must be
resolutely attacked as a major problem. The recent session of
the General Council of the Red International of Labor Unions
laid the greatest stress upon this vital point. The mass struggles
we are now carrying on are producing many new working class
ﬁghters. These, together with the developing elements already
in our organizations, must !be as quickly as possible drawn into
the leadership. Bureaucratic tendencies to -prevent the develop-
ment of new worker-leaders, must be ruthlessly liquidated. Sys-
tematic courses of education in trade union tactics and organiza-
ti-on must be established by the Party and the T.U.U.L. to develop
promising proletarian elements into effective working class leaders.

The most thorough application of trade union democracy (dem-
ocratic centralization and proletarian discipline), the systematic
use of self~criticism in all our work, alertness to discover rank
and ﬁle comrades with abilty and encourage them, train them
and promote them to more responsible work—building of new
leaders from below—these are the best methods of strengthening

our leading forces.
3. T.U.U.L. 50,000 MEMBERSHIP DRIVE

The Party membership must give the most active support to all
the mass activities of the T.U.U.L.; in the ﬁrst place the great
drive for 50,000 new members by June 30, now being initiated by
the T.U.U.L. This big recruitment campaign is pronounced by the
Comintern and Proﬁntern to be the “decisive mass task of the
Party and the T.U.U.L.” The realization of this goal of 50,000
new members by the end of‘ June is entirely possible in the present
favorable objective situation. While the T.U.U.L., with the full
support of the Party, is organizing these new members the Party
can and must absorb the ideologically most advanced dements
among them into its own ranks.

The 50.000 d,1‘iVe. Which is the present sharpest concretization

 

 

 

IvVuA(nu;.—n(9

RESOLUTION ON BUILDING T.U.U.L. 41

of the slogan “Organize the Unorganized,” must be utilized for
the strengthening of every phase of the T.U.U.L. The building
o-f shop committees, local councils, minority groups in the reform-
ist unions, the strengthening of the national unions, etc., must
be systematically carried out in this campaign. The recruitment
drive must be hooked up with and made a component part of the
May First Demonstrations, the unemployment movement, the
mass conventions of the miners, metal workers, shoe workers,
auto workers, and marine workers’ unions. The great organiza-
tion drive must be concentrated upon the basic and heavy indus-
tries, especially those of a war character. This campaign offers

the best means for extending the T.U.U.:L. work in the South.’

The building of Labor Unity must be a central feature of‘ the
membership drive.

The T.U.U.L. Negro, Youth and Women’s departments must be
systematically developed in the course of the membership drive.
These departments shall focus their attention upon this drive as
their main activity.

The T.U.U.L. shall work out quotas for the respective unions
and cities, together with concrete tasks for all units and commit-

» tees of the organization for carrying through the membership

drive. In stimulating the organization work the principle of
revolutionary competition shall be systematically applied, the
various organizations competing wth each other in the fulﬁllment
of their tasks. The Party shall be mobilized for the maximum
support of the T.U.U.L. to put the whole organization program
into effect.

The membership ‘drive must be understood as part of the gen-
eral struggle of the T.U.U.L. for leadership of the masses. This
in the ﬁrst -place requires a basic improvement in its strike
strategy. The principal conclusions to be drawn regarding our
strike strategy in the present period are that we must prepare our
strikes better, give them more of a mass class character, carry
them out in accordance with the principles of independent leader-
ship, and develop them in the direction of the mass political strike.
The failure of our leadership in strike struggles to develop them
into wider mass struggles, to. mobilize greater mass support for

  
 

42 _ J THESES AND RESOLUTIONS

our political demands, to broaden our organizational base during
these struggles, can be ascribed to the lack of understanding of, or
resistance to in some cases, the basic line of the Red International
of Labor Unions, which insists on the election of broad rank and
ﬁle committees of action, rank and ﬁle strike committees-—the con-

crete application of the united front from below. This is a dan- .

gerous error which has hampered all our work. The line of the
RILU must be applied in practice, all unclarity eliminated and
resistance to it sharply combatted. There must be more atten-
tion given to the question of strike strategy. There shall be pre-
pared a special resolution on strike strategy, based upon the prin-
ciples laid down at the Strassburg Conference.

4. THE UNEMPLOYMENT MOVEMENT

The proper development of the unem-plo-yed movement is of
the greatest importance to the Party and the T.U.U.L. The prin-
cipal weakness of the movement up to the present time is the
lack of concrete organization. There is also a deﬁnite failure to
sufﬁ-ciently link up the struggle of the employed with the unem-
ployed.‘ Furthermore, the movement has not been utilized for
the recruitment of members into revolutionary unions. All these
weaknesses must be drastically corrected. 4

The National Unemployed Conference in New York on March
29-30 gave the general line for the further development of the
movement. The National Unemployed Council is the national
crystallization of the unemployed movement as a whole, being
aﬂiliated nationally and locally to the T.U.U.L. The "National
Unemployed Council will carry on an aggressive campaign for
organizing the unemployed in the various industrial centers into
unemployed councils and for their recruitment into the revolution-

ary unions. The next great steps in the mobilizaton of the un-

employed are the May Day Demonstrations and the great National
mass conventions and demonstrations in Chicago, July 4-5. It
is of the most vital importance that the full forces of the Party
and the T.U.U.L. be mobilized not only to make these demonstra-
tions successful, but especially to, build actual organization
amongst the unemployed and to strengthen the prestige and organ-

 

 

 

RESOLUTION ON BUILDING T.U.U.L. ‘ 43

ization of the Party and the T.U.U.L. among the masses. The
unemployment question shall be made the central issue in our
election campaign, with the unemployed councils‘ supporting the
Party candidates. At all coming conventions of T.U.U.L. unions
there shall be delegations of the unemployed and the question
of unemployment shall be placed prominently on the agenda.
Right wing opportunism manifests itself in the‘ unemployment
movement primarily by minimizing our major demands for social
insurance and the 7-hour day, 5-day week, apin-g and voicing the
treacherous “social welfare” demands of the social fascists (open-
ing up of jails for lodging houses, etc.). by minimizing the neces-

.sity for organization of the unemployed, by attempting to con-

ﬁne the movement within the bounds of capitalist legalism, etc.
These opporunistic tendencies which tend to liquidate the move-
ment must be militantly fought. *

The unemployment movement offers a splendid lever for car-
rying on the struggle against the bureaucrats in the «A. F. of L.
With large numbers of the reformist trade union members unem-
ployed, it is possible and it must be our aim to draw them into
our unemployed councils and to direct their attacks against their
reactionary oﬂicials. The unemployment movement also offers
a fruitful ﬁeld for intensiﬁed work among Negroes, Women
and Youth. The defense of the prisoners arrested in connection
with March 6th and other demonstrations of the unemployed, must
be made a central issue in the unemployed councils.

jg. THE RILU FIFTH CONGRESS DELEGATION

A major aspect of our trade union work duringfthe next three
months must be the election of the T.U.U.L. delegation to the

. Fifth Congress of the Red International of Labor Unions. The

coming RILU Congress is of tremendous importance. A great
wave of radicalization develops among the workers in all of the
industrial countries and the colonies. The Fifth RILU Congress
will be the revolutionary organizing center for this great forward
movement of world’s workers. The -Congress will greatly strength-
en the RILU in its role of independent leadership of the workers
and in solidifying its organization generally. Detailed directives

for the election of this delegation have been sent out by the
T.U.U.L. and these must be rigorously supported in the various
organizations.

6. INTERNATIONAL REVOLUTIONARY COMPETITION

At the Sixth Session of the General Council of the RILU rev-
olutionary competitions were developed between the National
Minority Movement of Great Britain and the T.U.U.L. and be-
tween the CGTU of France and the T.U.U.L. The terms of
these competitions will be published in Labor Unity. Both of these
competitions are valuable, that with the National Minority Move-
ment for intensifying the building of the T.U.U.L. generally and
also that with the CGTU for strengthening the T.U.U.L. in a
phase of its activities in which it is particularly weak, the colonial
work. These competitions should be militantly carried out so
that at the Fifth Congress of the RILU the T.U.U.L. delegation
will be able to report its tasks completely -fulﬁlled.

7. DEFENSE OF THE SOVIET UNIoN—-FIGHT AGAINST
IMPERIALIST VVAR

In all the mass activities of the T.U.U.L. the question of the
ﬁght against the impending imperialist war and the struggle in
defense of the Soviet Union must be kept in the very foreground.
The T.U.U.L. must spare no effort to popularize the achievements
of the Russian workers in building socialism. The masses of
unemployed and radicalized workers are inspired by the progress

of the Soviet Union andare highly receptive to our propaganda

against imperialist war.

Resolution on District Eight (Chicago)

I.  Plenum of the Central Committee fully endorses the

line of the Party leadership in District Eight. The Novem-
ber Plenum of the District Committee, in full agreement with the
line of the October Central Committee Plenum, correctly orien-
tated the Party in the District on the outbreak of the economic
crisis, which further accentuates the general world crisis of cap-
italism, on the consequences of the crisis for the workers,“ and
on the further sharpening of the class struggle in the District.
The resolution emphasized that the radicalization of the workers,
already shown by various strikes and by the District—wide August
1st demonstrations, would be further deepened and broadened,
and the possibility of building the Party increased, as a result of
the economic crisis, the "mass layoffs, wage cuts, intensiﬁed ra-

tionalization and growing fascist offensive of the bourgeoisie and A

their social reformist agents as well as by the growing imperialist
war preparations, especially for war against the USSR. A per-
spective for sharp mass struggles, in which the Partywould play
a leading role, was clearly laid down.

2. This perspective has not only been sustained, but as the
economic crisis steadily, though unevenly, deepens the capitalist
offensive against the Workers and the rising workers’ counter
offensive becomes more marked.

In the coal ﬁelds, where the coal operators, the state and the
United Mine Workers of America are openly united in an econ-
omic and political offensive against the workers, the radicaliza-
tion of the workers is very deep seated. This is shown not only
by the ‘bitterly fought December-January strike of 10,000 miners
under the leadership of the revolutionary National Miners Union,
"but also -by the whole series of local strikes which are breaking
out daily and which invariably take the form of‘ a struggle against
the strike-breaking UMWA, as well as against the coal operators
and the state.

[45]

46 THESES AND RESOLUTIONS

A negative factor showing the deep-seated character of the
radicalization among the Southern Illinois coal miners is the open
split between Lewis and Fishwick and the setting up of a new
miners’ union allied with the Musteites, with a social fascist pro-
gram and leadership, which has as its purpose the paciﬁcation
and betrayal of the miners under cover of pseudo-radical phrases
and a sham battle against Lewis. The extreme poverty and misery-
of the miners, now accentuated by the abnormal seasonal decline
caused by the economic crisis, plusthe open betrayals of. both the
Lewis and Fishvvick unions and the growing fascist terror of the
operators, the United Mine Workers of America and the State
will further deepen the discontent of the miners and their deter-

mination to struggle against these intolerable conditions. By re-~

doubling the activities of our Party in the coal ﬁelds and by ener-
getically supporting the building up of the National Miners Union
the prospective is for gigantic class «battles there during the next
few months, leading _up to a national strike of coal miners on the
expiration of theanthracite agreement in September.

The wage cuts and intense speed-up in the metal, machinery
and steel industry is deepening the radicalizatio-n of these workers.
The department strike of steel workers in Indiana Harbor against
rationalization, the similar walkout of the Simmons Bed Company
workers in- Kenosha against wage cuts and rationalization are
always indicators of developing struggles in the steel and metal
industries which must receive the immediate and energetic atten-
tion of the Party.

The more than no-rmal seasonal decline, accentuated by the
economic crisis, now beginning in meat packing and agricultural
machinery plants will be accompanied by a still sharper offensive
against the workers in these industries, maturing the present deep
discontent into sharp struggles.

The response of over 100,000 workers in Chicago, Milwaukee,
St. Louis, Springﬁeld, Rockford and smaller cities throughout
the District t-0 the call of the Party and the Trade Union Unity
League on March 6 shows most clearly the widespread character
and depth of the radi-calization of the workers in the District.
The March 6 demonstrations as well as the preparatory demon-
strations which preceded them in Chicago and Milwaukee were

V of the utmost political signiﬁcance and -become further factors in

increasing the will of the masses to struggle. These demonstra-
tions, however, were still primarily demonstrations of' the unem-

. ployed, only a relatively few workers leaving the factories; indi-

cating that much more work, especially organization, must be
(lone by the Party in the District among the factory workers.

3. The fascist development which is taking place throughout
the entire country as a result of the economic crisis, the sharpen-
ing class struggles and the preparations of the American bour-
geoisie for war, is especially marked in the Chicago District prin-
cipally due ,_to the large concentration of basic and war industries
there on which the Party has concentrated which makes the bour-
geoisie particularly vicious in their efforts to crush the revolu-

tionary workers’ organizations, and to the complete interlocking-

of ﬁnance capital (Strong Committee, Insull Dawes, etc.)' the
State and city government, the racketeers, the underworld gang-
sters and the leadership of the American Federation o-f Labor
unions. The use of police, sheriffs, the militia, the deputized
United Mine Workers of America gangsters to break the miners
strike; the raids on the headquarters of the Party and of other
revolutionary organizations, with the smashing of desks, typewrit-
ers, etc., the hundreds of arrests during the past few months (since
August Ist) ; the arrest of hundreds of comrades and unemployed
workers during the preparatory unemployed demonstrations, fol-
lowed by the brutal beatings in the jails; the raids on the Milwau-
kee headquarters by the “socialist” police, the arrest and sentencing
of the leading comrades to three and to six months jail terms; the
open participation in support of this terror campaign by the AF L
(Durkin, Oscar Nelson,) etc., are all indications of the sharp
character of the bosses’ fascist offensive in the Ch-icago‘District.

4. In these situations, deﬁnite progress has been made by the
Party. The general p-oliti.cal level of the Party has been raised.

' The section leadership of the Party has been strengthened. The

Party has been established as the leader of large mass struggles
in Milwaukee and Southern Illinois, whereas previously the Party
in these places was almost non-existant. The success of the
Party in Milwaukee is of particular importance because of the

 

‘Thesis on the Economic and Political Situation
and Tasks of the Party

I. HE present economic crisis in the United States requires

a sharp turn in the methods and tactics of our Party. This
crisis has thrown millions of workers into unemployment; It is
rapidly accelerating the rationalization process in industry. Its ef-
fects are broadening and deepening the counter-offensive of the
exploited working masses. The capitalist class is meeting these
effects -by replacing its democratic pretensions with fascist prac-
tices. The economic problems of the crisis are intensifying the
imperialist aggressiveness of Americancapital and are intensify-
ing the war danger. In this situation the Communist Party, being
the only force of proletarian leadership, confronts the task and the
-possibility of winning influence and leadership over a majority
of the working class. This requires a decisive turn toward mass
activities, a speeding-up of the Bolshevization process, a general
activization of the whole Party, a rapid transformation of the
street nuclei into a shop nuclei basis of- the Party, the develop-
ment and broadening of leading cadres, the building and leading
of militant mass industrial unions.

Growth of the World Crisis

2. The Sixth World Congress of the Comintern pointed out
that “the present period of the capitalist world is giving rise to
a fresh series of imperialist wars ; wars among imperialist States
themselves; wars of the imperialist States against the U. S. S. R.,
wars of national liberation against imperialism, imperialist inter-
vention and to gigantic class battles.” The Tenth Plenum of the

E. C. C. I. pointed out that the accentuated external and internal ‘

contradictions of capitalism are at present accelerating the shat-
tering of capitalist stabilization and are deepening and widening
the revolutionary tide of the international labor movement.

This world crisis of capitalism, following the path of the uneven
development of capitalism, spreads throughout the capitalist sys-

strong position of the Socialist Party there which our Party is
now challenging for the ﬁrst time. The large number of factory
A gate meetings, the wide distribution of leaﬂets and bulletins at
the shops in connection with all of the recent campaigns (August
1st, TUUL convention, Party anniversary, TUUL and Party un-
employment conferences, March 6, etc.) has greatly extended the
inﬂuence of the Party.

The carrying through of the struggle in the coal ﬁelds against
Lewis and F ishwick, the struggle against the Musteite policies
of Watt, and the energetic carrying through of the December
strike were very substantial achievements for the Party and were
of national signiﬁcance in the ﬁght against the UMW A for the

. building of the National Miners Union and in the preparations for
the September 1st nation-wide strike, for which the District must
now also further prepare. S

In Negro work, which had previously been neglected by the
Party to the point where there were no active Negro members,
the Party has made a substantial beginning; about 85 Negro
members having been recruited and the Negro question now
occupying the attention of the Party.

The recruiting drive in the district during which over 600
new recruits, mostly from the basic industries, a considerable
number of which were Negroes, were brought into the Party, is
a deﬁnite sign of progress. These new members, if they are de-
veloped and fully drawn into Party work, can greatly strengthen
the Party’s future work.

The mobilization of 50,000 workers on March 6 in Chicago,
despite the police terror which partly resulted from’ the energetic
preparatory work of the Party and which necessitated the semi
legal functioning of the Party for two weeks prior to March 6
as well as the mobilization of over 50,000 more in Milwaukee and
other outlying industrial towns~ (St. Louis, Springﬁeld, Rockford,
etc.) was a major achievement for District Eight. March 6
greatly deepened the inﬂuence of the Party among the masses and
extended greatly the Party. These achievements are indications
of the correct political ‘line of the Party leadership on one hand
and of the energetic carrying through of this line in practice on
the other.

RESOLUTION ON DISTRICT EIGHT 49

5. The Plenum especially notes and fully endorses the struggle

' which has been consistently waged with the help of the Central

Committee against all manifestations of the Right danger in prac-
tical work and against the Right and conciliatory elements in the
Party.

The right danger in the mass work of our Party is not only
great because of the sharp ttirn which the Party has had to make
to lead the sharpened class struggles of the third period, but this
turn becomes increasingly diﬁicult because of many bad heritages
in our Party-—social-democratic and syndicalist conceptions and
organizational forms, opportunist conceptions carried over from
the Lovestone-Pepper regime, factionalism, trade union ideology,
lack of theoretical training, language separatism, lack of a clear
understanding of the new line, etc. The weakness of the En-
lightenment Campaign which tended to take on a purely formal
character in the Chicago District, is a contributing factor, to-
gether with the past bad heritages and the sharpened class strug-
gles, for the recent sharp Right, conciliatory and certain clique
tendencies. All these factors make necessary that the entire Party
be on guard against opportunism especially in the daily mass work
of the Party. I

The sharp struggle against the Right opportunist line followed
by some comarades (Corbishley, Voizey in the coal ﬁelds and
F eingold in the needle trades) was a pre-requisite for the success-
ful carrying through of mass struggles. The removal of these
comrades from their posts when they resisted the efforts of the
District Polbureau to correct their line was politically correct. The
theories of‘ F eingold of “no radicalization in the needle trades,”
of a “genuine lockout” in the rnillinery strike, and his defeatist
line on the possibilities of building the Needle Trades Workers
Industrial Union, as well as the defeatist, pessimistic outlook and
the stubborn retention of‘ old trade union conceptions and methods
by Corbishly, Voizey, Taylor, etc., are incompatible with the hold-
ing of leading positions in the Party or the revolutionary unions.

position was equally correct and necessary. The open protection
given to the Right elements by Cline, under the slogan o-f “no
killings,” etc., and the simultaneous carrying on of a struggle
- against the District leadership ‘by the demogogical use of’ the cor-
rect slogan of “self criticism,” could not be tolerated. The open
effort of Held to mobilize the functionaries against the leadership
with Cline’s collaboration in the preparation of his speech, the
failure of Cline to inform the Secretariat or Political Committee
of the line Held was developing and the later boisterous, deceitful
denunciation of Held while continuing the same line and carrying
on the same struggle against the District leadership, shows clearly
unprincipledness, the continuation of factional methods and the
development of an open Right wing line and therefore the im-
possibility of these comzrades holding leading positions in the
V Party. ,
While the District leadership in the early stages of the ﬁght ‘
against clique tendencies and unprinciapledness on the part of cer-
tain comrades (Sklar, Milgrom-., Reed), made certain mistakes of
wrong approach to comrades, which were recognized and cor-
rected, the ﬁght against the Right and conciliatory elements
(Cline, -‘Held, F eingold, Conbishly, etc.) was correctly and ener-
getically carried through and in the course of which Cline and
Held were isolated, and a deﬁnite political consolidation was
achieved in the District Polcom and throughout the Party.

6. Together with the success of the Distri-ct in mass work and
the correct ﬁght against Right and conciliatory elements, it is
necessary to emphasize and to call the attention of the District to
many weaknesses which still manifest themselves in its work,
mostly of’ an organizational character. In the mining strike the
special resolution of the Polcom already pointed out certain weak-
nesses (insufﬁcient bringing forward of local demands, insuffi-
cient attention to the political preparation of the Belleville con-
vention, lack of preparation for the strike, etc.). In the Recruit-

ing drive there was at slowness in preparing the drive and an in-
sufficient linking up of the recruiting with the mass work of the
Party, insufﬁcient mobilization of the entire Party, insuﬂicient
follow-up to see that the drive was pushed forward on all fronts,
the organization of only one shop and six mine nuclei during the
drive and absolutely impermissible practice of issuing cards to
new members without initiation .stamps, the insufﬁcient training
and drawing the new members into the work, etc. The trade
union fraction work of‘ the Party and the building of the TUUL

. lags woefully behind the possibilities of this work in the present

period. Theunemployed work and the preparation for the March
6 demonstrations, while showing an improvement over previous
demonstrations and campaigns, Haiti, Mexico, etc., suffered great-
ly from organizational weaknesses, especially among the employed
workers. Much factory work has been done from the outside
of an agitational and organizational character, but the work of
the shop nuclei and the building of shop committees is still very
weak. There was insufficient attention given to the Young Com-
munist League and a certain wrong relationship was permitted
to exist which must be speedily overcome.

7. The task of overcoming these weaknesses and thoroughly
preparing the Party for leadership in the developing mass strug-
gles must be taken up energetically by the District. Complete

unity must be established in the leading committees and through-

out the Party on the basis of the line laid down in the Central
Committee Plenum. The widest possible discussions must be de-
veloped among the functionaries and in the units to consolidate
the Party on the Central Committee line. All Right and concilia-
tory elements must be sharply fought and if they persist in their
line, removed from their positions.

The Partys’ shop work must be strengthened, not only to
strengthen the regular units of the Party but especially to have
the roots of the Party deep _in the factories to meet the efforts
of the ‘bourgeoisie to drive the Party into illegality in this period
of sharpened class struggles and preparation for imperialist war.
Special concentration must be made on the mining, steel, ma-
chinery, meat packing industries. While still further strengthen-

ing the agitational and propaganda work, special attention must
be given to the organizational phases of this work. Shop nuclei
must be built and made to function in the shops. The illegal ap-
paratus of the Party must be immediately completed. The mobili-
zation of the Party for the Trade Union Unity League recruiting
drive must be complete. This campaign involves not only the re-
cruiting of' new TUUL members, but the setting up and activiz-
ing of the Party fractions and through them the establishment of
TUUL shop committees with central bodies and a functioning
TUUL organization on both a city and industrial basis. In this
connection much greater attention must be given to the new revo-
lutionary unions, the National Miners Union and the National
Textile Workers Industrial Union.

The unemployed councils must be strengthened and the struggle

for social insurance and relief for the unemployed must be linked L
up with our broader political demands and energetically pushed _

forward. The setting up of committees of action uniting the
unemployed and employed must be carried through. The conven-
tion to be held in Chicago on July 4 and 5 of the unemployed
especially requires an intensiﬁcation of the Work of the Party
among the unemployed.

The preparations for the mass political strike on May 1st must
be placed as the most immediate and decisive task. The weak-
nesses in the March 6th preparations (failure to set up committees
of action, failure to secure the organized participation of the
revolutionary unions, the TUUL or other workers’ mass organi-
zations, sympathy for strike in shops, but no organization with
which to pull the strikes, etc.) and the organizational weaknesses
in the demonstration itself must be studied and overcome before
and on May Ist. ‘

In all the work of the Party the struggle against the fascists
of the A. F. of L. and the -social fascists of the Socialist Party

and the Musteites must be strengthened. The broader political V

aspects of the work must be developed and kept in the foreground
and all the work of the Party must have as its objective the prep-
aration and carrying through of the election campaign. Candi-
dates must be put up throughout the district in the Congressional

and local elections and the broadest possible election campaign de-
veloped on a united front from below basis.

The neglect of the Daily ‘Worker and literature sales in the
past must be overcome by immediately selecting a capable comrade
as Daily Worker agent and the /setting up of a Daily Worker ap-
paratus throughout the Party. In the present Daily Worker
drive, the Party in the District must be fully mobilized and the
quota for new subs, factory distribution and ﬁnancial assistance
must -be energetically carried through.

The carrying out of these tasks, the overcoming of the many
weaknesses and wrong tendencies can only be accomplished on
the basis of the widest development and encouragement of self-
criticism in the District. The critical examination which the P01-
com has made of past campaigns and the discussion be-fore the
units and functionaries meetings must be greatly extended. Self
criticism must become a weapon for purging the Party of all
wrong tendencies and the leadership of all looseness in work and
bureaucratic tendencies.

The drawing in and training of new cadres for the work of
the party and the auxiliaries must be placed in the foreground.

The Party has shown its ability in the past to moblize masses
of workers for mass meetings and demonstrations. It is now nec-
essary to utilize the favorable sentiment which the Party has cre-
ated to strengthen the Party and the revolutionary unions in the
District organizationally. The -gap between the Party’s broad inﬂu-
ence on the one hand and its organizational weaknesses on the
other must be closed by systematically developing all phases of

Party work (especially shop nuclei, trade union fractions, shop,

committees and TUUL). This is the principal task. before the
District. The carrying through of this task can be realized by
overcoming the organizational looseness in the district, -by com-
pletely unifying the leadership, by persistent self-criticism of all
errors and weaknesses and the energetic mobilization of the whole
Party for participation in mass work. ‘

Tasks of Our Party in the South

ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL SITUATION

I.  situation in the South today conﬁrms the previous esti-
mates and perspectiveslaid down in the October thesis and
makes clear the correctness of the thesis of the Sixth Congress of

the Communist International and the Tenth Plenum in placing

the greatest emphasis on the importance of basing our Party
solidly in the masses of Southern workers——-Negro and white.

.In particular does the present situation and the work of our
Party over the period of a year confirm in the clearest manner.
the correctness of the Comintern in instructing our Party to con-
centrate its efforts among the Negro masses of the South and
bring forward in the sharpest manner the central demand of full
social, economic and political equality for Negroes.

In this ﬁeld of struggle our Party in the South has made its
most pronounced advance.

2. The economic situation in the Southshows all the charac-
teristics of the national economic crisis with certain special ‘fea-
tures which must -be emphasized: (a) The industrialization of
the South has been accomplished by the superimposing on a semi-
feuidal agricultural economy the most mo-dern type of rationalized
industry and the herding into the huge industries of an army of
workers recruited directly from the countryside. (b) The stan-
dard of living (-and the general social status) of the Southern

masses is below that of the American working class in general, a ~

big percentage of the workers and their families in textile (rayon)
chemical, tobacco, furniture manufacture, etc., actually living be-
low the subsistence level. (d) The crisis in the South is felt with
greater force in the new, highly rationalized industries and, since

these are the basis of the Southern “boom,” and the workers ,
therein having had little or no experience in organization or tradi- S

tion of struggle, it has been possible for the capitalists to place
more of the burden of the crisis on the masses than has been the
case in the North. (e) Unemployment has decidedly more of a

mass character in the South than in the North (i. e., a greater
proportion of the workers are unemployed or partially employed).
(_f) With so great a proportion of the masses living below the
subsistence level, with no accumulated savings of any kind, the
Southern workers are experiencing actual starvation and pauper-
ism to a far greater extent than the workers of the North.

A 3. The actual ‘curtailment of production in almost all industries
is accompanied ‘by improved rationalization processes which con-
tinue to maintain or even increase output with few workers. The

Loray Mill (Gastonia) is closed completely while at the same '

time the number of spindles per worker in operating mills shows
a considerable increase.
workers because a machinewhich enables one worker to produce

‘the output of fourteen workers has been installed. In another

The Reynolds Tobacco -Company only last week discharged 900
workers because a machine which enables -one worker to produce
the output of fourteen workers has been installed. In another
factory a wage cut of 40% has been announced.

4. The industrial crisis is accompanied by a severe agricultural
crisis which deepens and sharpens it. Prices of tobacco and cot-
ton (the two Southern staples). have dropped sharply. As in the
North, curtailment of‘ agricultural production by at least 15%
is a-dvocated by the federal department of agriculture. With the
curtailment of production of the textile industry (there is an inter-
national crisis of a chronic character) and the reduction of the
buying power of the masses through unemployment part-time
and wage cuts, the prospect is for a still greaterreduction of the
living standards of the agrarian masses by the fact of small crops
of cotton and tobacco accompanied by falling prices."

The acute’ unemployment is increased at a rapid rate by the
inﬂux of farmers, share croppers and tenant farmers into the
_industrial centers.

6. The Southern capitalist class and its government are con-
ducting the most vicious offensive against the working class and
our Party. Negro workers and our Negro organizers feel most

severely the effects of this drive. It is directed principally against ‘

the growing unity of the Negro and white workers on the basis

  

56 THESES AND RESOLUTIONS

 
  
     
  
   
  
   
   
  

of full equality for Negroes—-which is the ‘basis of all our work
in the South. The intensity of the drive affords a valuable means
of measuring the mass discontent and the will of the workers for
struggle since it is directed mainly against our Party and the
struggles which it leads, and has as its objective the complete
isolation of our Party from the masses through legal and fascist
methods to drive it into illegality or exterminate it. All of‘ our
organizers face many months or years in the -penitentiary, jail or
the chain gang.

Street meetings have been prohibited entirely by special decrees
in a number of important cities, in others they are prohibited
when the workers are out of the factories (Winston-Salem,
morning, noon and in the early evening.)

Open fascist terrorism is planned to supplement the dozens of
archaic suppressive laws which are in themselves evidence of the
low social status of the Southern masses. Every legal pretext is
ultilized to arrest and jail our organizers and militant workers.
The fascist program of the ruling class is to be seen in the per-
mission given to the American Legion and other fascist organiza-
tions to parade and demonstrate on May Day in a number of
important Southern cities.

7. The role of the American Federation of Labor and its social

fascist Muste wing is that of defenders of the attacks on our
Party and the masses. Its leaders appear openly as informers
and provocateurs. (In Atlanta an ofﬁcial of the State Federa-
tion of Labor appeared as a state witness against our comrades.)
In Birmingham the “Labor Advocate,” official AF L organ, calls
openly for fascist action against our organizers. (First page edi—
torial headed “This VVay Out,” March I 5th, 1930. The house
of one of our comrades was bombed on March 31st in Birming-
ham.) .
The AFL and the Muste Wing received the public support of
the press, pulpit and capitalists. President Green is welcomed by
chambers of commerce. The fascists and social fascists appeal
openly to the capitalists on the basis of hatred for Negroes.

In no other section of the country has the AFL and its Muste
wing appeared more openly as the defender of capitalism. The

PARTY TASKS IN THE SOUTH 57

Socialist Party is weak in the South, but its oﬂicial organ supports
the Musteites and gives aid and comfort to the drive of the cap-
italists and their government against the working class and our
Party.

8. The unbearable burdens placed upon the masses by ration-
alization, mass unemployment and the suppressive measures of
the capitalists has created the objective conditions for big strug-

gles and there is concrete evidence of the will of the masses for

struggle for the program of our Party and under its leadership.
The March 6th demonstrations which, while having many serious

shortcomings, were of a mass character and very mi1itant—1Char- ‘

1otte——workers coming out for demonstrations without leadership
—Richmond and other cities—.—-increase in Party membership, al-
most spontaneous formation of Party units by workers, inﬂux of
members into TUUL, many successful meetings of‘ Negro and
white workers, extremely favorable reception of our literature,
speakers, etc.

Unemployed councils must be established in all the important

centers and a huge delegation (2,000) sent to the Chicago Unem-

ployed Convention.

9. In the present situation the importance of the role of our
Party in organizing and leading mass struggles is of far greater
importance than ever before. The -fact that our Party has per-
mitted a certain slowing down of our activity at various times,
and that we have not yet been able to expose completely and de-
feat the AF;L and the Musteites—the most effective instruments
of the capitalists-—must be ascribed to the tendency to approach
the question of our work in the South in a formal way, to under-
estimate in practice the basic importance of work in the South-—
approximately one-third of the United States in territorial area,
with a population of 40,000,000 whose working class produces one
sixth of the total industrial output of America, working in con-
centrated and highly rationalized industries, containing two-thirds
of the Negro population and where the struggle for social, eco-

nomic and political equality takes on its sharpest form.

Evidence of this underestimation in practice is shown by the
fact that this huge area with‘ its bitterly exploited and oppressed

4 THESES AND RESOLUTIONS

tem at a varying tempo and with diﬂferent formsland character.
If, in the United States, the crisis is already showing all the typical
characteristics of a cyclical economic crisis, in other countries
“it is seen in the spreading of the crisisiover a wider territory
(Eastern Europe, colonies, China and India, the South American
countries, Japan); in a third type of country it is seen in the
maturing of a general economic crisis (Germany); in a fourth
it is seen in the accentuation of the chronic depression prevailing
in a number of important industries (Great Britain) ; in a ﬁfth
it is manifested in the appearance of the ﬁrst symptoms of a
crisis, slowing down of production, discharge of workers, falling
of stocks (F rance)” (E. «C. C. I. Presidium Thesis). T

The policy of the world bourgeoisie is to transfer the burden
of the crisis onto the shoulders of the working class. A new
wave of rationalization is the outstanding manifestation of this.
Politically the bourgeoisie attempts to solve its difficulties through
fascism. The problem of markets it attempts to solve by forcing
a re-distribution of’ the world; for this, it carries on a most in-
tense war preparation.

Socialist Construction in the U.S.S.R.

3. One of the most important factors in the further intensiﬁca-
tion of the contradictions of the present period of world cap-
italism is the growth of Socialism in the Soviet Union. The
gigantic program of the Five Year Plan of Socialist construction
involving bot-h industrialization and the collectivization of agricul-
ture,- which has already been surpassed during the ﬁrst year and
which will be entirely accomplished in four years, is the clearest
evidence for the toiling masses throughout the world of the supe-
riority of the Socialist system of production over the capitalist
anarchic exploitative system of -production. Tremendous impor-
ance especially has the Socialist transformation of agriculture,
the mass collectivization of the million of individual economies
of the poor and middle peasants on the ‘basis of the growth of
the Socialist industry and technique, the four-day Working week,
on the basis of the leading role of the proletariat in its alliance
with the decisive masses of the peasantry.

58 THESES AND RESOLUTIONS

industrial and agrarian workers is still one District with only one
Party organizer in the ﬁeld, in the fact that our Southern Party
papers is not yet published and that the response to the appeal for

‘ funds to found it (directed principally to the language fractions)

has been shamefully inadequate; in the weakness of our forces
in the South generally; in the failure to keep the Gastonia case
in the center of our defense work; in constant shifting and with-
drawal of forces, in our inabilityto secure capable organizers for

V the American Negro Labor ‘Congress, the weakness‘ in systemat-

ically developing new forces, delay in establishing the TUUL on
a District scale, insufﬁcient effort to set up functioning fractions
in the National Textile Workers Union, lack of sufficient coordi-
nation of the work of our various departments.

The center of gravity of Party work in the South is the work -

among Negroes who are decisive strata among toiling masses in

the South, as well as the weight of the burden 0-f rationalization

and unemployment in the various industries. This criterion of
revolutionary strategy, and not mechanically applied considera-
tion of relative importance of heavy and light industries, must
determine the main ﬁeld of Party mass activity in the South.
From this point of view great importance is acquired by the Party

v work in the coal and marine transport industries, as well as the

railroad, steel, the rayon section of the textile industry (Virginia),

chemical industries as well as agriculture, in all of which Negro

workers occupy a large and strategic ‘position. Directing atten-
tion to ‘these industries must on no account signify any slackening
of work in textiles, which is the largest single industry in the
South and also the present storm-center of class struggle, as well
as inducing a growing body of Negro workers (Georgia), tobacco
industry, etc., which must continue in the forefront of our work,
for which there must be a decided strengtheninglof our forces.

I0. O,‘uI' work still suffers from the fact that our entry into
the struggle in the South was/made‘ in an unplanned manner, that
serious mistakes were made in Negro work, in trade union work
and in our general activity in the early period. Because of this
we were forced for a time to ﬁght on battleground chosen by our

V class enemies and were unable to reach out of the textile industry

 

 

    

PARTY TASKS IN THE SOUTH 59
and broaden our base among the masses of Workers in other in-
dustries.

For the same reason our earliest work was largely of an agita-
tional and propaganda character——necessary and indispensable
but insufﬁciently accompanied ‘by organization. ‘

Following the end of the Gastonia trial there was a wide gap
in our activity and the continuity of our campaigns were seriously
interrupted. At the same time, while emphasis was correctly
placed on organizationtwork, the elementary tasks of Wide mass
agitation which plays such an important role among the Southern
masses, have not been carried out on a sufficiently broad basis.

Neither have we popularized sufﬁciently issues such as the de-

mand for social insurance, abolition of the chain gang system,‘

abolition of vagrancy laws, abolition of peonage, etc., full fran-
chise for Negroes, etc., against company stores, company towns,
having a direct connection with the life of the masses.

Tendencies to minimize the achievements of our Party in the
initial struggle around Gastonia (expressed in the idea that Gas-
tonia was a defeat) must be sharply combatted.

Our struggle against the AFL fascist and its social fascist
Muste wing has suffered from the same defects. It is necessary
to carry on the broadest mass agitation against and exposure of
these class enemies and our whole campaign has been too narrow,
especially in recent months due to lack of and weakness of forces.
This ;has resulted in certain advances being made by those im-
peralisb agents. ‘

II. VVe,must now prepare and launch an offensive of a mass
character. The social ‘basis of the AFL in the South, because of

T the high degree of rationalization, and the generally low social

status of the masses, is narrower than in the North. It is being
narrowed still further by the wage cuts and increased intensity of
rationalization made possible by mass unemployment.‘

Our perspective must be for the defeat of the AEL and its
Muste wing in the mass industries oﬁ the South.

12. The perspective of the TUUL and its aﬂiliated unions

V must be that of having within six months a total membership

 

far greater than that of the AFL.

  

 

6o THESES AND RESOLUTIONS

Increase of forces -and mobilization of the Party for this task
must be secured at once and every opportunity seized upon to
develop mass struggles.

I 3. Our Party in the South must be strengthened at once in
preparation for the May Day strikes and demonstrations. They
must be of a far broader and of a more deﬁnite political character
than the March 6th demonstrations. They must be built around
elementary popular issues combined with our main political slo-
gans and be an integral part of our preparation for the coming
elections.

Unconditional release of political prisoners, disarming of fascist
bands, the right of the workers to self-defense against armed at-
tack of their enemies, mass struggle against legal persecution of
workers and their leaders centering around the main slogan of
a ‘political strike for such demands, must be popularized in the
May Day actions and in the coming election campaign.

14. Our election campaign must cover the entire South. The
whole forces of ‘the Party must be drawn into the work. lWe
must look upon the election campaign as one of the most im-
portant ways of ﬁghting against the attempts to drive us into
illegality. Native Southern workers must be put up as candi-
dates for important ofﬁce.

All auxiliaries must be instructed to mobilize their forces for
our election campaign.

The big percentage of Women and youth, more than 50% in
all Southern industry (except steel, lumber and transport) re-
quires leadership and more intensive work.

I 5. The necessity for ‘continual struggle against the right
danger as it appears in practice must be carried on more ener-
getically. Especially is the right danger a serious menace as it
appears in the conduct of trade union work. There is a tendency,
because experience has shown that the Negro masses respond to
our program and organizational ‘work, to be satisﬁed with the
organization of only Negro workers into the unions. If the
white workers do not respond, or if their response is not so im-
mediate as that of the Negro workers, there is no suﬂicient effort‘

 

PARTY TASKS IN THE SOUTH 61

made to continue to appeal to the white workers on the basis of
full equality for the Negro workers.

This amounts to abandonment of the whole struggle against
race prejudice and if carried only slightly further can result in
the complete perversion of our Party program by the formation
of Jim Crow unions while formally maintaining the slogan of
full equality. Such tendencies must be eliminated.

They are especially dangerous since our whole experience in
the South shows that difﬁculties of combatting white chauvinism
among the masses of workers has been greatly exaggerated, that
industrialization, intensive rationalization and mass unemploy-
ment, coupled with the most vicious forms of oppression, legal
and extra-legal, is breaking down race prejudice to an extent some
comrades fail to see. ‘

Far more emphasis must be given to our agitation and propa- l

ganda and in our practical work to the duty of the white workers
to take the initiative in the struggle for full equality for Negroes
and not to place the main burden of the struggle on the Negro
masses.

16. The slogan of self determination must be brought for-
ward in all our work as an agitational and propaganda slogan.
Especially must this slogan be utilized in the struggle against
the Garveyites and in the work of the American Negro Labor
Congress. While our Party fully recognizes the right of the Ne-
gro masses to self-determination to the point of separation, this
slogan must not supercede the struggle and slogan of full social,
political and economic equality and must not be permitted to de-
generate into segregation—the vulgar interpretation placed on it by
the bourgeois and petty-bourgeois elements and others under their
inﬂuence.‘

'17. The ANLC must send more capable forces to the South
and begin at once especially the penetration of the agrarian dis-
tricts.

18. Our Party must adopt and put into effect a program of
action in the rural districts. The agrarian crisis and the histor-
ically bad economic and social conditions of the Southern agrar-
ian masses have laid the basis for our Party.

 

62 A THESES AND RESOLUTIONS

Especially must we intensify our work among the Negro
masses of the countryside. Axspecial section of our election pro-
gram must be worked out for activity in this ﬁeld. In our work
in the Southern agrarian regions wemust raise such concrete de-
mands as abolition of taxes for tenant farmers, share croppers,
moratorium for chattel mortgages, etc. A programof action and
demands must "be worked out for the organization of the agricul-
tural workers. The TUUL must see that our work for organi-
zation of the agricultural workers is not separated from the work
of its Agricultural League inthe North. All our union fractions
must guard against any tendency to separate their work in the
South fro-m that of the North.

19. The election of' the Red International of Labor Unions
delegates must be used to popularize the RILU among the Negro
and white workers and direct attention to the international char-
acter of their struggles. At least 25% of the 50,000 new members

to be recruited by the TUUL'by June 30th %hould come from’

the Southern industries. Rank and ﬁle organizing committees
must 'be elected at once. Revolutionary competition must be de-
veloped between sections. We must make special eﬁ‘orts to‘have
big Southern delegations to all co-m-ing trade union conventions.

20. Our struggle for the defense of the Soviet Union and
against the imperialist War danger must take on more of a popular
character since the Southern bourgeoisie and the petty-bourgeoisie
are the most vicious and ardent supporters of patriotism, militar-
ism and imperialism. Socialist construction in the Soviet Union
must be contrasted with the terrible conditions of the Southern
masses. In the South are located extensive war industries-
chemical, rayon, etc. We must concentrate our campaign among
the masses in those industries.

21. Our Party and the Southern working class are meeting
furious attacks having deﬁnite fascist characteristics. Workers

_Defense Corps must ‘be popularized on the basis of the numerous

concrete experiences of the Southern workers. Their organiza-

 

tions must be undertaken seriously and carried on. under strict I

control of our Party.

 

PARTY TASKS IN THE SOUTH ' 63

22. Organizational Proposals: The building of our Party must
proceed more rapidly. More fbrces must be sent to the South
and the most intensive efforts made for the development of new
forces from the ranks of the Southern workers. Our Southern
paper must be established at once. Mass recruiting must be a
daily part of all our work. We are extremely weak in shop nuclei

and special efforts shall be begun at once to increase the num-ber of

 

these. A minimum of six shop bulletins within the next sixiweeks
must be one of our ‘objectives. They must be issued regularly
in decisive centers.

A district organizer must be selected for Birmingham, a con-
ference held, provisional directing committee elected and prepara-
tions begun for building a second District with Birmingham as its
headquarters. A director for work among Negro masses shall be
sent South at once. A full—time six—week Party training school
shall be established in some Southern centers. A number of col-
onizers must ‘be secured for the decisive industries. ‘Additional
forces for the TUUL must be secured. We must make an en-
deavor to put in the ﬁeld a full-time manager for our Southern
election campaign.

Resolution on the Organization of Factory Nuclei

I. ESS than 10% of the Party membership is organized into

factory nuclei. Of the present membership of‘ approximate-
1y I 5,000 only 1,189 members are in factory nuclei, the total num-
ber of which is at present 140. It goes’ without saying that the
number of street nuclei outnumber the factory nuclei many times.
The importance of the factory nuclei with regard to their par-
ticipation in the campaigns of the Party is even less than the
number of' the factory nuclei in proportion to the total number
of nuclei or the membership organized within them to the total
membership. The Factory Nuclei, in the main, have been passive
and have not fulﬁlled even the most elementary work except in
isolated cases. This condition is not the same in all Districts. In
such industrial Districts as Pittsburgh, Cleveland, Detroit, the
number of the factory nuclei is almost equal to the street nuclei
and a considerable section of the membership of these Districts is
organized within them, while in such Districts as New York, Cali-
fornia, the membership organized into the factory nuclei is less
than 2%. But even in the Districts where a considerable number
of the membership are in the factory nuclei these nuclei do not
play a role in proportion to their membership while if they were
really functioning nuclei their inﬂuence in these Districts would
be decisive.

During the recent recruiting campaign only 76 factory nuclei
were established and the majority of these factory nuclei were
formed in but a few Districts (Boston, 14 ; Pittsburgh, 12; De-
troit, Io; Cleveland, 8; Minnesota, 8), while such Districts as
New York and Chicago succeeded in forming but a very few fac-
tory nuclei.

With regard to the activity of the factory nuclei the situa-
tion does not present a better picture. Even such an elementary
task as the publication of shop papers is not carried out by the
majority of the factory nuclei. Of the 90 factory papers reported

[641

 

 

RESOLUTION ON FACTORY NUCLEI 65

a large number are published in factories where there exist as yet
no factory nuclei (in New York District there are reported 21 fac-
tory -vpapers only three of which are published by the factory
nuclei while the remaining I0 factory nuclei do not publish papers
and there are 18 papers published where no factory nuclei have
been formed). O.f the papers published most of them are not
published by the factory nuclei directly, but by the District Com-
mittees with but very little participation of the factory nuclei.
There are even cases where the papers published by the District
and distributed by comrades outside of the factory nucleus are
unknown to the members of the nucleus until they receive a copy
just like the rest of the workers.

Activity is not conducted by the factory nuclei in a systematic
manner inside the factories and literature distributed is very hap-
hazard. There is lack of understanding of regular and systematic
agitation, of bringing into the factories the Party campaigns, of
building TUUL shop committees, as well as very little recruiting.

We must note that very few members were recruited by the
factory nuclei in the recent recruiting campaigns and that there
are factory nuclei in all cities existing for many years without
a single new member having been recruited directly by the nucleus
from the factory. Often the work of the factory nuclei is car-
ried on ‘by the neighboring street nuclei and by comrades assigned
by the local committees from time to time. Its work in the main is
limited to occasional literature distribution, sales of the Daily
Worker and the distribution of the factory paper.

At the same time we can observe that in those instances where
the factory nuclei undertake systematic work on the inside to
bring the campaigns and slogans of the Party to the workers in
the shops, the Party has succeeded in bringing the workers to
demonstrations, enroll them into the TUUL, build factory com-
mittees, sell the Party literature, secure subscriptions to the Daily
Worker and raise considerably the prestige of the Party among
the workers, thus clearly illustrating the fact that only through
the penetration of the factories and the establishment of factory
nuclei within them will the Party be able to gain the leadership
over the masses of the workers. »

66 THESES AND RESOLUTIONS

3. We must note that in the recent recruiting campaign con-

 

siderable headway was made in orientating the activity of the '
' Party upon the factories. The ‘main line of the Party in the

recruitment campaign was upon the factories. ‘There can be no
doubt that the orientation upon the factories, seriously begun and
systematically followed up during the recent recruiting campaign
has already -begun to make itself felt and’ if followed up during
the coming period will be reﬂected in the complete reorganization

T of the Party on the basis of factory nuclei. The recent recruit-

ment campaign through the recruiting of semi-skilled and un-
skilled workers from the basic industries, who constitute the
majority of those recruited, laid the basis for the complete trans-
fommation of the Party on the basis of factory nuclei. Also it
must be borne in mind that the present 140 factory nuclei are in
factories employing close to three—quarters of a million workers
and are almost all in the basic industries (steel, auto, mining,
metal, packing, etc.).

Only‘ through the establishment of the Party rooted in the fac-
tories and on the basis of factory nuclei will the Party be able
to overcome the present disproportion between the Party inﬂuence
and weakness in organization, establish shop committees, build
the TUUL, educate the masses to Communism and lead the work-
ers in the struggle for the Dictatorship of the Proletariat. The
transformation of the Party on the basis of factory nuclei, the
activization of the factory nuclei and the complete orientation of
the Party on Work inside the factories is not a separate organiza-
tional question divorced from the main line of* the Party. This
is a political task of the greatest importance indissolubly bound
up with the carrying out of the major task of the Party—the
winning of the masses.

4. ‘While there is no open opposition to work inside the factories
and the building of factory nu-clei, there exists a considerable un-
clarity and no less passivity in the ranks of the Party. The
opposition to the building of factory nuclei usually takes the form
of raising all sorts of imaginary difﬁculties as excuses for not
proceeding more rapidly with the ‘building of‘ factory nuclei. This
is true not only of certain sections of the membership within the

s

 

 

 

RESOLUTION ON FACTORY NUCLEI ‘ 67

existing factory nuclei and the comrades inside the factories, but
in the leading committees, sections and districts. The Party must
carry on a campaign of enlightenment as to the necessity to
orientate the whole work of the party on the factories and the
building of factory nuclei. We must popularize the factory
nucleus form of organization among the masses of the workers.
This can best be done through the activization of the factory
nuclei and the publication of literature, the printing of‘ material
in the factory papers explaining the work of the factory nucleus
to the workers. At the same time we must expose all passivity
on the part of the leading committees in orientatingitheir activity
on the factories and the failure to build factory nuclei. In all
districts there must be a careful examination of this activity and
detailed plans formulated and carried out leading to the trans—
formation of’ the Party to a factory nucleus basis.

5. The following tasks must be carried out in order to change
the present situation and to transform the Party from one of
street nuclei with a sprinkling of weak factory nuclei into a Party
organically connected with the masses in the factories and leading
them through organized factory nuclei in which the bulk of the
membership is organized.

(1) Complete orientation of the Party activity uponlthe fac-
tories. Every campaign—May Day, struggle for the demands of
the -unemployed, for the ANLC Convention in St. Louis, against
imperialist war, and for the defense of the Soviet Union, building
the Trade Union Unity League, the drive for the Daily Wor.ker——-
all these campaigns must be centered in the factories. If this is
done and the Party membership and the factory nuclei really
bring these campaigns to the workers inside the shops, the Party
will not only increase its inﬂuence but will recruit thousands of
new Workers directly from the shops, leading to the formation
of new factory nuclei.

(2) The -present membership must wherever possible be formed
into factory nuclei. During the recent drive there have been re-
cruited many new members working in the same factory who as
yet are still scattered in the _various street nuclei unknown to each
other and to the leading committees. On the basis of a com-

ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL SITUATION 5

The turn in policy of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union
from the policy of limitation and squeezing out of the capitalist
elements to the policy of the complete liquidation of the kulaks
as a class, is thus destroying the last remnants of capitalist exploi-
tation in the country, is removing the last inner class basis for
the imperialist intervention and abolishing the last inner basis
of restoring capitalism in the Soviet Union.

A Sharpening War Danger

4. The development of the eocnomic crisis extremely sharpens
the general contradictions of the capitalist system and brings still
closer the danger of a new war. The dominating imperialist
rivalry is that between American and British imperialism. All

mother inter-imperialist contradictions tend to align themselves

with this main imperialist rivalry. In the United States, prepara-
tions for war are going forward rapidly, accompanied by open
imperialist propaganda of a new advance of American capitalism
toward the economic domination of the world.

The London naval conference showed clearly that the prepara-
tions for armed conﬂict between these two great ‘imperialist forces
is the dominating question of inter-imperialist policy. At the
same time it demonstrated the utter hypocrisy of “disarmament"
phrase mongering.

The open preparation for a new world blood-bath came out
at this conference with cynical and frank brutality. A new im-
perialist war presents itself to the capitalists as an attempt to ﬁnd
an outlet from the economic crisis and is for them a continuation
of the general policy of the bourgeoisie against the proletariat, that
is, the attempt of the capialist class by means of new bloodshed
to break the workers’ growing counter-offensive.

In this situation the danger of an imperialist attack against the
Soviet Union becomes particularly acute. A war against the
Soviet Union, the fortress and outpost of the revolutionary work-
ing class of the world, is a war of the capitalist world against the
realizing Socialist aim of the toiling masses, is at the same time
for the capitalists an immediate outlet from the present economic
crisis, giving to capitalism a new tremendous market of destruc-

plete registration of the membership we will be able to build a T

large number of factory nuclei out of the new recruits to the
Party and many of' the old members who also, though working
in the same factories, are scattered in the street nuclei unknown
to each other.

(3) The unemployed members of the Party must be organ-
ized into the factory nuclei in the place of their last employment.
Only in this way will we be able to form committees of action
of the employed and unemployed around the factories. At the
same time we must guard against the factory nuclei becoming
organizations of unemployed. This can be overcome by syste-
matic recruiting in the shop and utilization of the unemployed
who maintain their contacts with the workers in the shops, for
activity inside the shops and for recruiting workers from the shop.

(4) One or two comrades not belonging to shop nuclei may be
attached to a shop nucleus near their factory. (Of course such
attached comrades must always be only a small fraction of the
factory nucleus membership.) The factory nucleus to which
such comrades -are attached must assist these comrades in the
activity inside their factory with a view of forming a nucleus
there as soon as three comrades work in that factory. The Sec-
tion Committees must give special attention to the forming of
the factory nuclei in such shops where one or two comrades are
employed. W'hen three comrades have been secured in that shop,
but who are unable by themselves to carry on effectively the work
in that shop, the Section should assign a more experienced com-
rade to the newly formed nucleus.

(5) The Districts and Section Committees must approach the

 

question of the building of the factory nuclei in an organized and,

systematic manner. A list of the most important factories in the
basic indusries must be prepared and the work of the organization
centered on these factories, concentrating on a few factories at a
time. Comrades must be sent into these factories where possible
and the work carried on by the neighboring factory and the street
nucleus, with a view of establishing factory nuclei in these shops.
Special attention must .'be devoted to factory towns.

The fact that the existing factory nuclei show very little life
and activity, places the problem: before us not merely of the

s

 

RESOLUTION ON FACTORY NUCLEI 69

mechanical reorganization of the Party and the ‘building of new
factory nuclei but the activization of the existing factory nuclei
and the detail attention to the work of the factory nuclei at all
times. All Party Committees and their Organization Departments
must pay more attention to the activity of the factory nuclei. The
“Party Organizer” must become a forum for the exchange of
experiences and the solution of problems arising on the work of
the factory nuclei. We must not pass over lightly the many prob-
lems that arise in the work in the factories and the work of the
factory nuclei. These problems must be seriously discussed
and solved.

The following are some of the problems that must be given
attention:

(a) Organization of work of shop nuclei despite persecution.
There can be no denial of the fact that work inside the factories
entails certain "dangers to the individual Communists. Among
these are loss of job, iblacklisting, government persecution, threat
of deportation of non-citizens, terror of the fascist thugs, etc.
This, however, can not be used as an excuse for inactivity. That
must ‘be overcome to the extent possible, minimized to the small-
est degree possible, but cannot become an excuse for inactivity.
It is necessary, on the other hand, to use the utmost caution pos-
sible. The Communists in the factory should not expose themselves
to the bosses and their tools. The individual members must be
known only to the sympathetic workers in the shop. The nucleus,
however, must be known to the workers in the shop through its
activity, which is carried on by the publication of the factory
paper, the distribution of party literature, individual agitation,
the work of building and leading the shop committees, etc. Nat-
urally this means that the Communist nucleus is to carry on its
work inside the factory as an illegal organization. At the same
time, in the event that a member of the nucleus is ﬁred for being
a Communist, the nucleus without exposing its members must
carry on a struggle in mobilizing the workers, for the right of
every worker in the shop to belong to the Party.

(b) Linking up the factory problems with the political cam-
paigns of the party. One of the problems that must receive major

70 THESES AND RESOLUTIONS

attention is to link up the political campaign of the Party with
the struggle for the every-day demands of the workers inside
the shops. Here we must guard against two wrong tendencies:

I. The failure to take up demands and grievances of the work-

 

ers in the factory, to build the shop committees, the TUUL, etc. ‘

2. The failure to bring the Party slogans and campaigns on all
questions into the factory and skillfully combining them with the
struggle around the grievances arising inside the factory. Neither
with abstract political slogans unrelated to the problems of the
factory, nor by limiting the work of the nuclei to just shop ques-
tions will the nucleus be able to develop the masses and lead them
in the struggle to Communism. By failing to give attention to
the concrete problems in the shop the nucleus will isolate itself
from the workers. By failing to develop the political activity
the nucleus will ﬁnd that while the workers will follow the Party
in economic struggles, the fascists and social fascists will con-
tinue to maintain political inﬂuence.

The life of the nucleus must receive a great deal of attention.
There must be systematic and .planful work. The meetings must
be interesting, always taking up questions that vitally concern the
workers in the factory, and at the same time there must be dis-
cussion of political questions. Routine work must be reduced to
a minimum through the nucleus executive taking up many of
these questions and at the same time working out in advance the
agenda for the nucleus meeting. There must be a real division
of work, so that every "member will have something to do. Spe-
eial attention must be given to development of functionaries.
Conferences of the nuclei ofﬁcials should be called regularly.
Every official of the nucleus must have an understudy, so that
when the comrade is ﬁred or transferred to another department,
the remaining comrades will be able to carry on the work unham-
pered. The nucleus meeting must start on time and not last too
long, otherwise the members who as a rule have to travel home
will not attend regularly.

Technical questions, such as the regular collection of dues, reg-
ular meetings, the time and place of the meeting, are important
questions upon which a great deal depends as to the normal func-

-no s

 

RESOLUTION ON FACTORY NUCLEI 71

tioning of the nucleus and its ability to draw in and keep the

new members. The nucleus must give special attention to the
recruiting and work among women, Negro workers, the creation
of nuclei of ' the Young «Communist League, etc.

Shop committees must be given the greatest attention in the
work of the factory nuclei. The nucleus is the fraction in the
shop committee. As a rule the S-hop Committees will be built
on a departmental basis, andwherever necessary the nuclei should
also be divided upon this basis. In the case where the nucleus
has only one member in a given department shop committee, the
nucleus executive must supervise the work of‘ the comrade in that
shop committee. -

Factory papers must be published regularly by every nucleus.
They must really be the organs of the nucleus in the factory and
produced by the nucleus with the assistance of the workers in
the shop. While the Section and District Committees must give
every possible assistance to the publication of the factory papers,
and also supervise the political line of the paper, the paper must
not be produced in the District Office. If this is done the nucleus
will not develop the independent activity which is indispensable.

With regard to the distribution of' the factory paper, while it
is permissible and often necessary to supplement the distribution
from the outside, the paper "must also be distributed from the
inside by the members of the nucleus and sympathetic workers.

The nucleus must not be content with the sale of the factory
paper but must solicit subscriptions to the Daily Worker, Labor
Unity, the Working Woman, the Liberator, the Young Worker,
etc. The building up of worker correspondents is one of‘ the best
means to create a broad basis for the work of the nucleus and
the development of the workers, drawing them close to the Party.

 

Resolution on Party Fractions

TO carry through the basic tasks of the Party, namely, the es-
tablishment of Party inﬂuence and leadership over the majority
of the working class, which is carried through in life by giving
correct political and organizational leadership to the Workers in
all their struggles throughout everyday work in shops and through
our campaigns, we must clearly establish the Party as the van-
guard of the working class, and its relations with all other organi-
zations of the working class, as the “highest form of class organi-
zation of the workers.”

While the ‘basis of our activity must be in the factories, we
must also understand the great importance of organizing and
building {broad mass working class organizations, particularly
trade unions, and also all forms of broad non-Party working
class organizations, such as ILD, Cooperatives, Friends of the So-
viet Union, WIR, Labor Sports Union, ANLC, Women’s Organi-
zations, etc., and where these already exist, the necessity of work-
ing actively inside these organizations to win the majority of these
workers under the inﬂuence and leadership of the ‘Communist
Party. We must combat tendencies which express themselves,
that in this period it is not necessary to build broad mass work-
ing class organizations to envelope the great mass of the radical-
ized workers and that the Communist Party is the only organiza-
tion necessary. The necessity of really undertaking a serious
campaign to build the unions of the T.U.U.L. and all non-Party
mass organizations as genuine mass non-Party organizations, does
not in any way underestimate the leading role of the Communist
Party nor lessen the imperative necessity of consolidating organi-
zationally the political inﬂuence of the Party by continuous re-
cruiting as a constant feature of our work, but on the contrary,
makes this task more burning.

While this correct programmatical task is generally accepted
by the Party, it is not- fully realized or carried out in life’. This

[72‘]

 

RESOLUTION ON PARTY FRACTIONS 

is seen by the failure to [build real non-Party organizations and
particularly by the neglect and failure of the Party District Com-
mittees to organize functioning Party fractions in the Trade
Unions, ILD, F5 U, ‘WIR, Cooperatives, LS U, etc.

This reﬂects two basic wrong tendencies:

I. Underestimation of the necessity of ‘building the broad non-
Party mass organizations and of working inside of those as an
important method of winning inﬂuence over the majority of the
working class.

2. A tendency to shrink away from the basic day to day work
amongst the masses. To correct this situation and proceed im-
mediately to a drastic rectiﬁcation through organizing and activ-
izing all Party fractions in all non-Party mass organizations, is
an immediate important organizational task of the Party.

I. Establish functioning Party fractions. In all non-Party

workers’ and farmers’ organizations (trade unions, cooperatives, l

ILD, F SU, AN-LC, LSU, cultural fraternal organizations, un-
employment councils, at conferences and conventions in local ad-
ministrative bodies, where there are at least two communists, a
communist fraction must be organized.

2. Role of Party Fractions. The Communist fractions in non-
party mass organizations have as their aim the winning of the
members under their inﬂuence and leadership of the Communist

Party. The more devotedly, practically and energetically they '

know how to pay attention to the interests o-f the members, the
better they understand how to link up the ﬁght for the immediate
aims with the struggle for the revolutionary goal of the work-
ing‘ class, the more easily will they succeed in gaining this in-
ﬂuence. ,

The Party fraction through its -activity must win the member-
ship and the organization itself for a revolutionary class line and
for the class struggle (strikes, demonstrations, campaigns, meet-
ings, support press, etc.). At all times the fraction must be con-
scious that it is representing the «Communist Party in the mass
organization and all of the local interests of that particular organi-
zation must be subordinated to the interest of the revolutionary
class struggle following a policy based on the program and ac-
tivity of the Communist Party. '

74 THESES AND RESOLUTIONS

3. Relation of Party to Fractions. The Party fraction is not
a basic unit of the Party. Only shop or street nuclei are basic
units of the Party. The fraction does not determine the main line
or policy of the Party. The policy to be pursued is determined
by the Party Committee (Section, District or Central Committee)
or one of its department. The fraction is the instrument of the
Party in carrying out this policy. The fractions can only make
decisions insofar as they refer to applying the policy in the given
organization. Within the limits of the general Party directives
the fraction shall deal with the question of their inner life and
current work.

When general tasks and activities of the Party in a given mass
organization is discussed by the departments of the Party leading
committee, representatives of‘ the fraction shall be invited. In
case of serious divergence ‘between the fraction and the depart-
ments of the Party, the Party committee shall deﬁnitely decide
the matter with representative of the Party fraction present. The
decision of the Party Committee must be un-conditionally carried
out by the fraction.

Every member of the Party fraction in the mass organization
should remember that he represents before the masses the Party
as a whole and thus the mistakes and errors will effect the inﬂu-
ence and prestige of the Party before the non-Party masses.
From this same point o-f view the Party leading committee shall
pay more attention to the political line and work of the fraction
in the m-ass organization bearing in mind and remembering that
the Party District Cornm'ittee is responsible for the whole work
of the Party. ‘

Candidates for all conventions, committees, etc., shall be nomi-
nated by the fraction executive and approved by the proper Party
committee which has the right to eliminate or propose other can-
didates. L ,

The organization department is responsible to the’ leading
Party committee for the organization and supervision of the fun-
tioning of the fraction, the policy to be pursued is determined by
the Party executive or such department as it might designate.

4. H ow to Organize Fractions and Structure. The Party shall

 

 

REsoz‘.U'r1oN ON PARTY FRACTIONS 75

compile through various registration means—the list of all Party
members in each organization. The Party members in each or-
ganization shall be called to a meeting and establish as the Party
fraction. A complete role of all Party members eligible, shall be
established. Every fraction must have a secretary. The Party
fraction must meet regularly before every meeting of the organi-
zation. Where the fraction is a large one, an executive bureau
shall be established for preparing the work of’ the fraction,Aetc.

Attendance and activity is a Party duty and failure\ to carry
out fraction activity will result in Party pressure, even to dis-
ciplinary measures being taken against the comrade involved.

Fractions shall be organized in all the various divisions of all
organizations, including their executive as well as all conventions.
This fraction structure from top to bottom of each mass organi-
zation must not function as a separate apparatus. The fraction
of each sub-division (City, Section, District or National) is subor-
dinate to the respective Party Committee. Fractions are not sub-
ordinate to higher fractions but only to Party committee.

5. Duties and Functions of Fractions. Every Party fraction
must carry through the Party line worked out for the speciﬁc
organization. All of its work must be conducted from the view-
point of extending the inﬂuence of the Party over wide masses of
workers. All the Party campaigns must -be brought by the frac-
tion to the masses of each organization. The fraction must win
the entire membership and strive to win the entire organization to
participate in all mass meetings, campaigns, demonstrations, elec-
tions, support of Daily VVorker, etc.

In reformist organizations the fraction must put forward a
class program on which it conducts a struggle to win the member-
ship and its support. As regards the mass organizations already
under the inﬂuence of the Party it is not sufficient to be only :1
ﬂuent speaker. In such organizations the Party members must
show other workers that they are not only good propagandists of
a correct platform or policy, but that they are able and capable
on the basis of revolutionary class platform to ﬁght for the
everyday interests of the workers and defending their concrete
immediate demands. The Party members organized in these

 

76 A THESES AND RESOLUTIONS

organizations must show an example of leadership in building
the organization, spreading its inﬂuence, improving its function-
ing. While the tactics of carrying through Party policy may differ
in various organizations with different conditions, it is absolutely
impermissible to follow a policy of trailing behind the masses.
If we have a task to pursue it is the duty of’ the fraction to carry
through this task overcoming the prejudices which backward
workers in the speciﬁc organizations might have. It is our duty
to win the workers to our line and if they are not convinced the
ﬁrst time, that is no reason for not conducting a vigorous cam-
paign and struggle for the particular task or policy.

SPECIFIC PHAsEs or ‘WORK or FRACTIONS IN TRADE UNIONS

I. The most important and all embracing fractions are those in
trade unions, in view of the tremendous importance of the trade
unions as the economic mass organ of the working class defending
the interestsof the working class. Every member of the Com-

munist Party who is eligible must ‘belong to- a trade union. There ,
"can -be absolutely no exception to this decision of' the Party, and

failure to comply with this decision means failure to carry through
Party instructions and" policy.

2. Party fractions must be organized of the Party members in
every union whether TUUL, AFL or independent.

3. The political line of the Party in the trade unions is estab-
lished by the leading committee through the trade union depart-
ment. The building, proper functioning and carrying through
of this political line effectively is under the supervision of the
Organization Department.

4. The organization of the Party District Trade Union Com-
mittee shall be composed of comrades in the fraction of the TUUL
plus additional comrades not in the fraction who may be added
to help strengthen the committee.

5. Every Party fraction, through its executive or‘ secretary
must submit regular reports to local executives, can look for
guidance as far -as the Party fraction of same union on a local
scale, but there is to be no direct line of communication between

5

 

RESOLUTION ON PARTY FRACTIONS 77

the Party fraction of the National Board of each union and the
fraction of each local union or shop committee. Such directives
will be given through Party channels and direct from National
T.U.U.L. ~

6. While Party fractions must meet before every union meet-
ing we must beware of a tendency to be in perpetual meeting.
We must ﬁght against a prevailing tendency in some districts that
our trade union work is limited to discussion in fractions.

7. Party fractions must not take up at their meetingsthe dis-
cussion of political and economic events but should bring the
Party attitude on all such question to the general meetings of the
local union or shop committee thus explaining the Party line to
those who are non-Party workers: ‘

8. Opportunist tendencies—that it is not necessary to build
Party fractions in the TUUL unions——must be sharply combatted.
Only through‘ the proper functioning of the fractions can the
TUUL and its affiliated unions be built into ﬁghting revolutionary
mass unions and a revolutionary trade union center. On the
district andlocal TUUL executive the Party fraction (‘with addi-
tions, if Party Committee sees ﬁt) must function as the Party
Trade Union Committee.

Fractions must take up these questions affecting speciﬁcally
their trade union or its being linked into a general movement of
the revolutionary working class. /

9. Concentrating on building the TUUL does not mean de-
serting of fraction work in AFL unions. Party fractions _must be
established and must be engaged in active work in all AFL
unions. All tendencies to neglect work in the AFL must be
sharply condemned and corrected. In the AFL locals the Party
fractions must win the inﬂuence of the membership away from
the traditional fakers and also the “left” Muste type of misleaders.
This must be done on the basis of the Party fraction putting for-
ward ﬁghting militant policies, to meet the bosses’ offensive on
the living standards of the workers, pointing out that this offensive
is in agreement with the AFL leaders. The Party fraction in all
the AFL unions must build up the TUUL minority grou-psof all
the workers who respond to the TUUL program. '

Union and breaking the Socialism in construction in the Soviet
Union, the tremendous economic advantages of which already
begin to shake the capitalist world. -

Economic Crisis in U. S. A.

5. Into this general crisis of world capitalism comes as a.
tremendously accentuating factor the present economic crisis in
America. The present economic crisis in the United States is the
inevitable outgrowth of a basic contradicti-on of capitalism, “ a
growing contradiction between the tendency toward unlimited ex-
pansion of producion and the restricted consumption of the masses
of the proletariat (general over-production) and this resulted in
periodical. devastating crises and mass unemployment among the
proletariat.” (Program of the Communist International.) This
crisis, which broke in its sharpest form upon the heels of the
crash of the stock market in November, continues to deepen.
While t-he ﬁrst period of the crisis (end of 1929) showed ﬁrst of
all the sharp decline in heavy industry (steel, machinery, con-
struction), in the ﬁrst three months of I930 the decline has pen-
etrated into the industries producing for mass consumption,
spreading throughout the economic life of the country. The “An-
nalist” index of business activity registers a general decline of
about one-eight-h (more than I2 per cent). Car loadings have
fallen from their 1929 record (highest in history), and for 1930
are running more than 6 per cent below the ﬁve—year average
of I92 5-29. The Federal Reserve index of industrial production
shows a decline below the highest point of last year of about 20
per cent. Commodity prices have declined approximately 10 per
cent, with the trend steadily downward. Building contracts run
more than 20 per cent below last year, with the gap constantly
widening. Gross railroad earnings declined in the ﬁrst ten weeks
of 1930 by from 10 to 18 per cent below the same weeks of 1929.
Bituminous coal production for e‘bruary was about 20 per cent
below last year. Automobile production has declined approxi-
mately one-third, with a perspective of further immediate reduc-

tion. Bank clearings are about 16 per cent below last year.

78 i . THESES AND RESOLUTIONS

I0. All opportunist tendencies connected with the work of the
Party fractions in the mass organizations must be com‘batted and
defeated, such as,

(a) Tendency to subordinate the everyday local interest of
the particular organization to the interest of the indiv-
idual. Such tendencies lead directly to the separation of
the particular organization from the proletarian class
struggle and leads into a petty bourgeois degeneration of
the organization (Halonen in Finnish Cooperatives).

(b) Attitude that it‘ is not necessary to build Party fractions
in organizations under the inﬂuence of the Party. This
is a sectarian tendency and leads to the replacement of
the mass organization by only the;Party organization and
is a serious obstacle for mass activity of the Party.

(c) /Tendekncy to neglect work in the reformist trade unions

is also‘ a sectarian attitude and means capitulation and

surrender before difﬁculties.

SPECIFIC PHASES OF" FRACTION WORK IN AUXILIARIES

I. The general Party policy in the auxiliary organizations is
worked out by the Party Committee and the Party fraction in
the National Ofﬁce of the auxiliary is charged with the carrying
out of this policy.

2. The Organization Department of the Central Committee is
responsible to the Central Committee and the Polburo to see
that the Party fractions nationally carried through this policy and
that the auxiliary is functioning and organizing its work correctly.

3. On a district scale the District Buro is politically responsible
for the activity and growth of the various auxiliaries.

4. On the question of personnel (such as District Secretaries»

of each auxiliary) the Party National fraction shall propose can-
didates to be ratiﬁed by the District Buro where it is proposed to
take the comrade from or send to.

5. The National Party fraction ‘shall not communicate direc-
tives to local Party fractions. Directives shall be sent to each

District Committee either by the Party Central Committee through

the Organization Department or by the National Party fraction
providing it has been approved ‘by the Organization Department
of the Central Committee.

6. The District is held responsible for the organizing and func-
tioning of Party fractions in every auxiliary organization.

Resolution on Lan_guage Work

WORK in the language mass organizations has considerable
importance as part of the mass activity of the Party in View
of the necessity to bring the immigrant proletariat closer to the
revolutionary struggles of the working class of the United States
and to win this important stratum of the working class under the
leadership of the ‘Communist Party.
A During the last period the Party has made some achievements-—
more centralized directives through the establishment of a
Language Department; carrying through of a number of cam-
paigns for the language fractions; more active participation of

the language fractions in the general campaigns of the Party. O

Notwithstanding, the work on the language ﬁeld still remains one
of the weakest factors of the Party’s mass activity. Our frac-
tions in most of the language organizations still manifest stub-
born opportunist tendencies. There are still considerable rem-
nants of separatism and federation and “left” secretarian tenden-
cies in the organizational structure and activity of the Party frac-

tions in the mass organizations and in their work which is sep- l

arated from the general activity of the Party and. sometimes dis-
plays a tendency to displace the Party.

One of the most outstanding shortcomings and mistakes of
language fractionsﬁ work is the lagging of the Party language
fractions behind the masses and their readiness to ﬁght.

Another widespread shortcoming is the inability of the Party
fractions in the language ﬁeld to rid themselves of nationalist

ideology and of conducting a ‘sufficiently vigorous and aggressive

 

80 THESES , AND RESOLUTIONS

campaign against the nationalism advocated by their respective
bourgeoisie. An outstandingexample is, ﬁrst, the impermissible
opportunist attitude taken by the Jewish Buro in connection
with the uprising in Palestine; secondly, the prevalence of na-
tionalist ideology in many workers’ language schools for children
where the tendency of “developing national culture” still prevails.
This is connected with another tendency still existing in the
language work, namely, insnﬁicient interest in the political and
economic struggles of the working class in the United States.

The Language Buros of the Central Committee did not carry
through the Party campaigns amongst the workers in the mass
organizations suﬂi-ciently. In the Party Recruiting Drive only a
few ‘b-uros manifested systematic activity. The other buros were
far from doing all possible for this campaign. I

Federationism still exists among the language fractions. In
certain instances the language buros manifested stubborn
resistance to the line of the Party. Such w-as the case
with the ICzecho—Slovak Buro which failed to proletarianize the
editorial staff of the paper, to exercise self-criticism and to rid
the paper of petty bourgeois inﬂuences. Such was also the case
with the Lithuanian Buro where the papers, Laisve and Vilnis,
manifested a petty bourgeois ideology and where the deviation
was not promptly corrected. In many instances the Buros and
the language press failed to take prompt action in ﬁghting against
right wing deviations. (Finnish Cooperative chauvinistic tenden-
cies manifested in Chicago, Lithuanian fraction, etc.) A com-
plete lack of action is to be noticed in the building of the Anti-
Fascist organization (Italian fraction) and a failure to draw the
workers coming from the colonial and semi-colonial countries
under the inﬂuence of the Party. Even as yet, a distinct lack of
understanding in regard to the princi-ple of democratic centralism
and communist discipline is to be noticed in several language bu-
ros, a tendency to consider themselves with authority to act
without consulting the Party on major political questions, a lack
of understanding, that they are only instruments for carrying out
the political line of the Central Committee, and not basic units,
with a right of independent and separate functioning Party

\

 

RESOLUTION ON LANGUAGE WORK 8I

self-criticism was not sufﬁciently applied by the language buros.
Generally speaking, the Party language papers do not carry

L through the Party campaigns. Some of our papers instead of

being teachers of Marxism and Leninism spread petty bourgeois
ideology amongst the workers. Some ﬂagrant examples of this
shortcoming are: _

a. Lit=huanian dailies “Laisve” and “Vilnis” while pwblishing
material of the Party do not inﬁlterate the line of the Party
throughout the rest of the composition of the paper.

b. Trylbuna Robotniczya printed advertisements of a religious
fascist literature organization as well as ads of professionals who
were ‘bourgeois candidates for ofﬁce.

c. Vilnis advertised a jubilee excursion to Lithuania on occasion
of the Lithuanian fascist heir (W. L. K. Wittoff).

d. Printing of Christmas greetings in many papers.

e. Publication in Rovnost Ludo of a letter from -a member of
the Socialist Labor Party criticising the Soviet Union without
one word of comment from the editorial staﬁ of the paper.

f. Failure of the Rovnost Ludo to connect up the question of
organization of the unemployed with the problem of the general
situation and the economic crisis.

g. Publication in the Toverita -of an article by a Party member,

explaining how she denied being a Communist and said to the
police that she voted the straight Republican ticket, when arrested
on March 6t-h with no editorial comment from the staff.

These few examples clearly show that some of our papers do
not follow the Party line; that they (believe that with merely
printing material sent out by the Party they have accomplished
their Communist duty. This is not a Communist line. These
opportunist. methods must be stopped, they do not satisfy the
Party or the readers who are workers, who participated in the
struggles, workers who are part of the American proletariat which
is developing a counter—offensive against the capitalist offensive.
They misunderstood the role of the paper as a mass ‘organizer
of the Party. They have not learned to give all news, and every
event in the line of -Communist policy. They have as yet to open
their columns to criticism from the workers in the shops.

 

82 THESES AND RESOLUTIONS

While the main trend of the language masses is to become more
and more part of the American working class, as it is expressed
by the numerous struggles in the mining shoe,, textile and needle
trades ﬁeld, in which the foreign born workers are a considerable
portion. Some sections of the foreign born workers live mostly in
separate communities and where is developing a peouliar local and
nationalist spirit formented by the petty bourgeois press, lawyers
and business men, who still have inﬂuence in many‘ mass organi-
zations of foreign born workers. These petty bourgeois elements
who are still encouraging a nationalist feeling among the masses
are, at the same time,part and parcel of the American bourgeoisie,
and, therefore, spread the inﬂuence of‘ the American bourgeoisie
among the masses.

These difficulties and a remnant of nationalism still express-
ing itself among some sections of the foreign born workers are,
however, offset by the growing radicalization of the entire work-
ing class, continually forcing the foreign born workers‘ into the
general struggle of the American working class and the growing
activity of the Communist Party which serves to unite the work-
ers of all languages. -

In outlining the work of the Party among the language masses,
we must be guided by the general aim of the Party, of winning
the majority of the‘ workers for the revolutionary class struggle.
For this purpose the language department and the Language
Buros must carry out the following tasks:

1. Fight against the right tendencies, against the conciliators
and against any other reformist inﬂuence; the right tendencies in
the language mass organizations express themselves in speciﬁc
forms of nationalism, chauvinism, and particularly in connection
with Negro work, strong white chauvinistic tendencies prevail.

2. Fight against the sectarian tendencies in connection with
mass activity as in regards to organizational federationism.

3 Bring -to the language masses the ideology of the Party and
lead those masses along the line of the revolutionary class struggle,
i. e., the line of the Party and the Communist "Internationale.

4. Carry on amongst the language masses a system of propa-

 

RESOLUTION ON LANGUAGE WORK 

ganda work of the Party in connection with all phases of Party
activity as well as in the cultural activity to bring the working
masses directly into the struggle of the American working class.

5. Usethe workers’ mass organizations and the various schools D

to recruit young workers into the Pioneer and Communist Youth
organizations. Organize wherever necessary English-speaking
children’s clubs and youth clubs in conjunction with language
mass organizations as a bridge between those organizations and
the Pioneer and Youth organizations.

6. Conduct a systematic campaign under the leadership of the
Party against exceptional laws for foreign-born workers, such
as registration, deportations, etc., as part of the capitalistattack
on the; working class of the United States.

7. Increase the anti-imperialist and anti-fascist campaigns and
struggles among the language masses as part of international
action against imperialism and fascism.

8. Use the various language organizations not as a means of
separating the working masses from one another and from the
American working class, ‘but as a means of drawing them together
by developing their revolutionary class consciousness.

The organizational side of the language work also calls for dras-
tic improvements. The Language Department of the Central
Committee did not function regularly, which circumstance re-
ﬂected upon the whole language work. More unity must be intro-
duced in the language work. More frequent meetings of language
paper editors and language buro secretaries must be held. More
strict control over the language press (11 dailies and I9 weeklies
and monthlies) must be exercised. The District Language De-
partments must be organized and become an integral part of the
District -Committees, actually directing the work. No regular
fraction meetings are held in many mass organizations; in many
instances language fractions being entirely absent.

THE LANGUAGE FRACTIONS AND THEIR TASKS

The main task of our Communist fractions in non—Party lang-

iuage mass organizations is to conduct a systematic Communist

 

84 THESES"AND RESOLUTIONS
if
agitation, propaganda, and education to bring the foreign lang-
uage speaking masses closer to the American revolutionary labor
movement so that they will take active part in the class struggle
in America under the leadership of the Communist Party of the
United States of America. .
The statutes of theiC. P. U. S. A. points out that “fractions
are organs of the Party within non-Party organizations. They
are not independent, fully authorized organs, but are subordinate

‘ to the particular local or Party District Committee.” All Party

members, belonging to a speciﬁc language local branch of a
non-Party language mass organization, constitute, as a group,
the Party fraction. All leading committees, or conventions, or
conferences of such organizations must organize such Party
fractions.

Party fractions should be organized in all such language work-
ing class mass organizations. Members of‘ the Party should carry
out not only systematic agitational work in such organization,
but particularly all forms of everyday work in these organizations
to Win the members for the revolutionary class struggle. The
Communist fraction must also conduct systematic work to secure
the afﬁliation of the language mass organization to such working
class organizations as ILD, WIR, FSU, etc.

In those organizations where we have already won the inﬂuence
of the majority of the membership they must not be mechanically
transformed to mere duplicates of the Communist Party, but
should retain their mass non-Party character. The complete pro-
gram of the Communist Party with all its major political slogans
must not be insisted upon being put into the program of these mass
organizations, thus causing the acceptance or non—acceptance of
all major political demands and slogans of the Communist Party—
nor are they to be forwarded as mechanical conditions for the
membership in such mass organizations. The Party should conduct
systematic recruiting, using such language mass organizations to
bring the best workers into the Party, but the organization as such
must maintain its non-Party mass organization and the Party
through its fraction must direct the activity of- such organizations
and see that they are not narrowed down to a few Party mem-
bers but that they are built into mass organizations on the basis

Q

 

RESOLUTION ON LANGUAGE WORK 85

of their speciﬁc "scope of activity. The Party, through its fraction
must show itself absolutely active and capable of building these
non-Party mass organizations.

In their activity the fractions have to mobilize the workers’
clubs for all immediate demands that the Party is ﬁghting for.
There have been tendencies to unite such Workers’ clubs into
National Leagues or Federations. This we must try to avoid in

the future. The clubs can, upon the basis of their activity grow

into mass organizations, and the leading organs for their activity
will be our language press for that respective group, and the
PARTY through our fractions. If organized into Leagues or
Federations, there will soon appear a tendency to develop this or-
ganization into a sort of' new political pseudo Party.

How Do THE FRACTIONS WORK

Every language _fraction works under the immediate leadership
of the nearest Party Committee. A Communist fraction in: a
language organization of a local scope, working in an area of a
certain section of the Party, will work under the leadership of the
Party section committee for that locality. If a language organi-
zation or a committee _of such an organization is of State or Dis-
trict scope, its fraction will work under the leadership of the
Central Committee. If a national committee of a certain language
organization is located in another place than the Central «Commit-
tee, it may assign the nearest District Committee to lead the
‘Communist fraction in that National Committee.

Every ‘Communist fraction carries on activity only in that
local organization or in that committee to which it belongs.

Every fraction should meet regularly before the meetings of
the organization, committee, conference, etc., in which it is active.
Not only should the questions upon the agenda of that organiza-
tion be taken up in the fraction, but the fraction should consider
the possibility of bringing new questions for the body, especially
such items that bring campaigns of the Party or other Communist
propaganda before the organization. When a fraction has made
a decision, that decision is binding for all members of the fraction.
A member who had spoken in the fraction or voted against the

line adopted by the fraction must clearly and unequivocally de-
fend the decision of the fraction and while carrying out and de-
fending the line adopted by the fraction and such members have
the right to appeal to the proper Party- committee.

INNER RELATIONS _0F FRACTIONS

 

In every organization, there are leading committees, e. g., all

certain language organization has a leading city committee. If
Communists are members of that -City Committee, they constitute
a fraction in that City Committee.

The local Party -Committee has always authority above the
fraction in respective city committees of any language non-Party
organization and directives and coordination of work rests with
Party Committees.

If in a language non-Party Organization Communists are elected
to its national leading committee, then these Communists form a
fraction of that National Committee and lead all fractions in all
City Committees of' that organization. ,

This means the Communist fractions are Organized in accord-
ance with the structure of the organization in which they work,
and all problems of our work in just that organization are attended
to in due order by fractions of locals, lower committees and higher
committees, always in direct contact and under leadership of re-
spective Party committees, direct or through its language Buro for
that special language.

LANGUAGE BURos

In order to subordinate the work of the Party fraction it is

A necessary for the Party -Committee to create a special apparatus,

such as a language buro. Such a buro, when necessary, will work
as a part of the structure of the District and Central Committee.
Language Buros must only be elected by the District and Central
Committee. Language 'buros of either the District or the Central
Committee have the task of coordinating the work of the respective
language fractions under the guidance of‘ the Party Committee.

If there are ﬁve or more language buros in the District, the Dis-
trict Committee should appoint a District Language Department
of no more than ‘three comrades to coordinate and lead language

RESOLUTION ON LANGUAGE WORK 

work of the District. The District Language Department should
‘be directed by the District Committee and is under its supervision.
At the sametime, however, it has the right to communicate directly
with the Language Department of the Central -Committee inform-
ing the District Cornmittee about each such communication.

Every District Language Buro‘ must report regularly and be
under the supervision of the District Committee through the
Language Department of the Central Committee.

In every language paper we must particularly develop workers"

‘ correspondence, and carry out the practice of considering all such

correspondence. All these workers’ correspondence must be con-
nected with the Daily Worker and necessary material to be sent
in regularly to the Central Party organ, the Daily Worker.

TASKS AND LINE oI«‘-WORK TO BE FOLLOWED BY THE LANGUAGE
PRESS

The Party Language Press should not only be an organ of in-
formation from: the point of view of the Party, but should pay
more attention to the interests and needs of the workers in the
factories, creating special section for workers’ correspon-
dence in all papers.

Further the Party language press reﬂect the activities of the
revolutionary unions, the TUU‘-L and for this purpose should
create a special section of the paper devoted to trade union activ-
ities. They must also publish the most important inner Party

documents and give regularly the most important information on

the inner Party life.

In order to improve the editorial work there should be organ-
ized a proper distribution of work amongst the members of the
editorial staff if conditions penmit, wherever possible a special
comrade should be as-signed to take charge of organizing the work-
ers’ correspondence, improve this correspondence, deﬁnitely an-
swer and acknowledge receipt of all su-ch correspondence, organize
meetings of workers correspondents with the editorial staff.

ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL SITUATION 7

Financial factors and signs of deepening crisis are seen in reduc-
tion of the discount rate. r

The present ﬂood of stock market trading with its creation
of paper value is an outgrowth‘ of “cheap money.” The accumula-
tions of the immediate past ﬁnd no market of industrial invest-
ment and ﬂow, as"‘cheap money,” into the ﬁeld of speculation.
For a while this stimulates the stock prices. But because of the
crisis in industry, these prices are purely ﬁctitious. Thus the
very stock market ﬁgures, which capitalist propaganda cites as

signs of an abating of the crisis, are in reality creating conditions *

for a new stock crash with a new downward trend of production.

Those branches of production which produce means of pro- V

cluction, ﬁrst and hardest hit by the crisis, remain at a level even
lower than the general decline. Employment and wages, dimin-
ishing more rapidly by far than production itself (due to in-
tensiﬁed rationalization) serve to deepen the crisis by further lim-
iting the purchasing capacity of the masses. -
The spreading of the economic crisis thruout the world is also
seriously diminishing exports. The export ﬁgures of the month
of March alone showed a decline of 26 per cent. The recent
stock market crash in Japan indicates that this factor will be
accentuated in the near future. ‘

Uneven Development of Crisis a

6. The growth of the crisis is not a uniform’ downward trend
of economy as a whole, nor of its separate parts. The general
decline proceeds at a varying tempo, while within the general
decline occur ﬂuctuations of speciﬁc industries and localities, with
more or less sharp movements. upward and downward. Particu-
larly is this unevenness of development marked in the leading in-
dustries (steel, machinery) which, after deep plunges downward
to 24 and 40 per cent capacity, make quick turns upward which,
however, still leave them lower than the general level of economy.
Seasonal increases are almost uniformly smaller than the average
of past years (especially in leading industries), so that the widely
trumpeted “improvement” noted from time to time in the capital-
ist press are in reality further declines, masked by the tricks of

Resolution on Keeping New Members

I. THE recent recruiting drive, during which over six thou-

sand new members, 85 per cent of whom are industrial
workers and 15 per cent Negroes, almost exclusively from indus-
try, was a real achievement for our Party.

Nevertheless these results are still in considerable dispropor-
tion with the -politi-cal inﬂuence of the Party amongst the masses,
though opening for the Party tremendous possiblities for the con-
tinued recruiting of still larger numbers of new members.

This further recruiting of revolutionary proletarian elements
into the ranks -of our Party must go hand in hand with the exten-
sion and development of the daily work and mass campaigns of
the Party. To meet the demands being made on our Party by
the daily sharpening of the class struggle, makes the further
strengthening of the Party a major task and with continuous
recruiting must go continuous and systematic work to keep and
develop the new members. '

2. These new members who have been and will be drawn into
our Party, considered as a whole, while conscious of capitalist
exploitation and with a determination to ﬁght against capitalism,
are nevertheless but little acquainted with the theory and practice
of the revolutionary workers’ movement. While they accept our
Party as the leading force in the workers’ struggles, they have
little knowledge of t=he role of a Communist Party in its broader
political aspects. Our task is to take this revolutionary material
and from it develop conscious bolshevik ﬁghters, welding them
thoroughly into our Party, giving them a clear Party approach
to all problems confronting the workers.

3. In this task -our Party is itself hampered by social dem-
ocratic remnants, inherited from the socialist party and permitted
to remain and even grow under the factional, opportunist leader-
ship of Lovestone, and which have not yet been fully overcom.e.
Our Party is only beginning to really orientate itself‘ on the fac-

RESOLUTION ON KEEPING NEW MEMBERS 

(cries and basic industries and the greater majority of the mem-
bership are not yet organized into s-hop nuclei. There is in-

I » sufﬁcient political discussion and inner Party political. life through-

out the Party. Contacts between leading committees a.nd nuclei
and membership still retain too bureaucratic a form. Circular
leadershi.p and instructions must ‘be eliminated as far as possible
and substituted by closer personal contact and leadership.
Already the effects of these and other Party weaknesses in con-
nection with the new members is clearly evident. In nearly every

District there is a great disproportion between the reported new

members and the number of initiation stamps purchased from the
Central Office of the Party during the Drive. Similarly the dues
sales have not increased to the same ratio with the recruiting of
new members. New members generally speaking are not sufﬁ-
ciently followed up by the sections and units. Only to a very
limited extent were they drawn into Party work. Classes for
new members, except Detroit, were very late in starting in all
Districts, and even yet there are Districts (Pittsburgh, Anthracite,
Boston, Kansas City) where absolutely no classes have been
started. In the Districts where classes have been started the
attendance is ‘by no means satisfactory.

4. This confronts us with a serious problem in connection
with the keeping of the new members recruited for the Party.
It confronts -us with the twofold task of overcoming the weak-
nesses of the Party and of giving a Ibolshevik training to the
new members. The most determined and energetic measures must
therefo-re be taken in the ﬁrst place to change the inner life of
the Party and its method of functioning. ‘

(0.) The political activization of the nuclei and their orienta-
tion on the basic industries must be made the ﬁrst aim of all
Districts. Regular and systematic discussion of Party problems

, and campaigns must be systematically conducted at all nuclei

meetings, all leading comrades from the District and Section Com-
mittee should be attached to shop nuclei to give them .-political and
organizational assistance. Reports and discussions must beso pre-
pared as to closely link up the political aims of the Party with
the daily struggles of the workers in the factories. Not long,

 

90 THESES AND RESOLUTIONS

abstract, tiring discussions, but concrete discussions on how to
bring the campaigns and activities of the ‘Party closer to the strug-
gles of the workers, must be developed and stimulated, especially
by the new members.

_(b) Every nucleus, guided by the Section and District Com-
mittee, must outline for itself concrete daily activity to carry
through in the factories and in working class neighborhoods, the
political and organizational tasks of the Party. 5At the following
meeting a check-up should be made on the extent to which the
work has been carried‘ through and of the results obtained, and
a further plan of work prepared. This method of planned, sys-
tematic, continuous work must henceforth receive the persistent
attention of all leading committees.

'(c) Improvement in the functioning of nuclei must be secured.
Meetings must be held regularly and on time. The nucleus
executive must always meet before the nucleus meetings, handle
all technical matters, select reporters on principal questions and
organize and plan the nucleus meeting. The practice of‘ reading
long communications and killing the nuclei meetings with technical
routine must be stamped out. The nuclei must be turned into
sources of preparation and direction of the_ Party members for
their work among the masses. V _ ,

(d) Sharp political criticism of all opportunist errors and
deviations as well as neglect of work, of all Party members and
of leading committees and functionaries must provide the basis
for serious and continuous self-criticism. Self-criticism. of our
mlistakes and weaknesses will convince the new m'emlbe'rs of the
seriousness and earnestness of the Party more than anything else
and must be fully and freely developed in a thorough, systematic
way.

(e) All bureaucrati-c tendencies in our Party must be ruth-
lessly fought and overcome. The methods of mass work must be
systematically developed.

5. Simultaneously with the campaign to improve the inner
life and to activize the Party, the most thorough, systematic and
continous effort must be made to train and develop the new
members, to overcome their lack of understanding of Communist

RESOLUTION ON KEEPING NEW MEMBERS 91

theory and practice as well as the many petty bourgeois preju-
dices instilled artiﬁcially by the bourgeoisie. The absorption and
activization of the new members recruited by the Party is one
of the most important phases of Party every—day work.

To accomplish our task it is necessary that:

(a) Every single member of the Party and especially the new
members must be assigned speciﬁc work in the nuclei of the
Party as well as in the trade unions and other proletarian mass
organizations. The new members should be especially drawn
into active work for the campaign of the Party, such as struggle
against unemployment, building the Trade Union Unity ‘League,
Daily Worker Drive, etc., and into active work in the nuclei,
giving them a direct function to fulﬁll according to their ability
and experience. The nuclei are to guide the new members in

their work, giving to them the most comradely help, guidance, 1

cooperation in carryng through the tasks assigned to them. The
fear or hesitancy manifestedin any Districts to assign the new
members to active work must be combatted. The practice of
burdening a few active comrades with a multiplicity of functions
instead of distributing the work amongst all members must be
discontinued.

(b) The most developed and promising forces among the new
members should be drawn into direct and in some cases leading
work in the auxiliary organizations, such as I‘-LVD, WIR, FSU,
Labor Sports Union, etc. In this way the Party can both develop
and train the new members and diminish the lack of cadres which
now exists.

(6) Systematic class work and political discussions must im-
medately be developed among the new members. Drawing them
into work should not become a substitute for systematic theoretical
training, and classes should not become a substitute for practical
participation in Party work. Both must go hand in hand.

Discussion meetings and classes at which all new members must
participate must be organized in every city. This must not be
done in a haphazard, disconnected manner, but thoroughly and
systematcally building their political education step by step until
they succeed in absorbing and assirnilating the theoretical founda-
tion and strategy of pur movement. V ‘

92 THESES AND RESOLUTIONS

This training of the new members must take several forms:

I I. _In connection with the campaigns of the Party, into which
the new members must be fully drawn, meetings of Party mem-
bers must be called at which a reporter explains in detail the
political problems and objectives of the campaign and the tac-
tical aims of the Party, etc. This form of developing the new
members should be widely developed.

2. In all Districts it is necessary to systematically develop and
fully carry through educational work among the members, par-
ticularly among the new members. This educational work must
not have as its objective merely the “education” of= the members,
but rather the securing of more successful results from all Party
members in mass work, t-he drawing in and developing of the
new members and the training of new leading cadres for the
Party. In addition to discussion meetings, reading circles, lec-
tures, etc., the district agitprop committee must set up the follow-
ing study classes in every District. (The new members especially
must be brought into the ﬁrst two classes.)

(a) Short classes, four or ﬁve weeks, primarily for new
recruits, on the “Fundamentals of Party Organization,” which
will simply but clearly explain the role of the Party, the duties
of Party members, the relationship of the ‘Communist Party to
other organizations (TUUL, A. F. of L., S. P., existing Negro
organizations, etc.) ; Party structure, discipline, forms of activity
in the shop and mass organizations, etc.

(_ b) Elementary classes in “Marxism and Leninism,” based

RESOLUTION ON KEEPING NEW MEMBERS 

Speciﬁc Reference to the Russian Revolution and History of the
American Working Class Movement, bringing out clearly the con-
ditions which made possible, and the principles, strategy and‘tac-
tics of the International Workingmens’ Association of Marx and
Engels, the struggle against the Anarchists and the reasons for
its death and the reasons for further growth of the Socialist parties
in the various countries, the establishment of the Second Socialist
International, the corresponding growth of opportunism and its
social base, the revolutionary Marxist wing, the collapse of the
Second International in 1914 on the war issue, and the establish-
ment of the Third International under the leadership of Lenin,
after the victorious Russian Revolution, etc., also showing the
development of the American working class movement, showing
the origin, program and policies of difference between various
workers’ organizatons (A. F. of L., S. P., IWW., CP., etc.),
the extent to which their form, program a.nd policies were inﬂu-
enced by purely American conditions as well as by European in-
ﬂuences, etc., etc.

(e) Class on Trade Unions comlbatting “Economist” theories
and showing clearly the variousforms of Trade Unions (non-
political, social—dem:ocratic, syndicalist and revolutionary
unionism).

The organization and carrying through of these classes must
be an immediate and one of‘ the principal tasks of the District
Agitprop Committee. Reports must immediately be made to the
center on the steps taken to carry out this work. ‘

3. One of the most effective means of conducting this per-
manent training work is under the direction of the Party Agitprop
Department. Study groups are a guarantee of the com-rades get-
ting in at regular intervals and through joint eiforts certain knowl-
edge on the theory of Marxism and Leninism and through active
Party work training themselves to become competent fighters in
the class struggles and more able to fill the task as Party members.
The task of training the new members and thoroughly assim-
ilating them into the life and work of the Party is a task that
will stand before us, not for a few weeks -but for months. To
make this period as short as possible a thorough and continuous

94 THESES AND RESOLUTIONS

traning must be carried on amongst the membership, concentrating
on the new members until they clearly understand the basic polit-
ical and tactical lines of the Party.

When organizing study groups the following points, among
others, must be taken into consideration:

I. The study groups can be organized in each nucleus. They
can also be organized in non-Party proletarian organizations of
mass character. The study group should have at its disposal——
if possible-—a room (private or in a Party headquarters or in
some building belonging to a sympathetic organization).

2. Do not permit the group to consist of too many members,
never more than eight or ten, not less than four or ﬁve.

3. The best way for a more advanced study group is to work
in close cooperation with the nearest District or Section Party
school. All study groups must -function under the direction of
the Agitprop Department of the District or Section Committee.

4. New Party‘ members should always be propagandized until
they join one of the study groups working in the nucleus.

5. All members of a study group should be brought in closest
contact with the practical work of the Party,‘ not least in better-
ing and improving the programs and agenda of the nuclei meet-
ings. The meeting of ' a study group should never be permitted
to interfere with nuclei meetings.

There are various kinds of study groups, varying a great deal
according to methods under which it is carried on, to problems
that confront the students, etc. Comradeship, leadership, punc-
tuality, disciplne, should never be missing in a study group, if its
work is to be successful. Every comlrade who is registered in
a study group must attend its every meeting and carry out the
tasks assigned him by the group, these tasks being study in con-
junction with practical Party work.

Some of the various types of study groups are as follows:

(a) Reading Circle Groups. This is a simple type of study
group and is based on each member of the group reading a sec-
tion of an assignment and there will then be a general discussion.
The book or text to be selected from 3. list prepared by the Sec-
retary of the Agitprop Department.

 

 

RESOLUTION ON KEEPING NEW MEMBERS 

(b) Discussion Study Group. This is an extension of the
reading circle type and takes up some speciﬁc daily problem of
the class struggle or of the Party speciﬁcally. One member of the
group is assigned to read and discuss a particular subject. This
comrade should be changed from meeting to meeting.

(c) Reporting Study Group. This is a type of class of a more
thorough and sytematic method than either one of the foregoing
and must have an outline of study already prepared which forms
the basis of the work of the group over a period of weeks. For
each point on the outline a member of the group be assigned to
prepare the material and report to the course, discussion, question,
etc., follow. All members of the course have read the material
and have suggestions.

(d) Lecture‘Study Group. This is a type of group where one
comrade prepares a series of lectures, covering four or ﬁve meet-
ings. For each meeting the member of the group should be
assigned some speciﬁc material on the same subject. After the
lecture, questions and discussion follows. It is most advisable
to have the series of lectures all deal with speciﬁc phases of one
subject.

(e) The Course Group. Considered a higher development of
the report group. The tasks are more deﬁnite and the self activity
of the members must be more intense. Special attention should
be given to the selection of a competent study leader who in this
sort of course serves as a teacher. This comrade must have a
broader knowledge of the subject to be studied than the other
members ‘of the group. Greater demand for home study and
preparation work should be made upon the members of this type
of group.

The Districts should vary this program and add speciﬁc ques-
tions according to the local situation.

4. Together with the work of training the new members must
go a systematic campaign to raise the theoretical level of the
entire Party membership by means of study classes, lectures,
functionaries’ conferences, etc., and by increasing the circulation
of the Communist, Communist International magazine, Inprecor,
Daily Worker, Party Organizer, as well as other Party organs
and theoretical journals. l j
