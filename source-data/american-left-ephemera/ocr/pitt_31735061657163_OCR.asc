DR. HUTCHINS SPOTLIGHTS
LOS ANGELES BOARD OF EDUCATION

L___

It is important to get the issues in these cases clear.

These teachers were not charged with being communists, or fellow
travelers, or radicals.

They were not charged with anything.

Since they were not charged with anything, they had no chance to
confront their accusers.

They had all taken the oath of allegiance to the Constitution of
the United States and the Constitution of the State of California.

They had all sworn they did not believe in the violent overthrow
of the Government, and that they did not belong, and had not be-
longed to any organization that advocates the violent overthrow of
the Government.

These teachers were discharged for refusing to answer questions.
The issue is, then, whether the Board of Education should have asked
the questions.

It seems likely that the Dilworth Law will be found unconstitutional.
It adds unnecessary and dangerous powers to those which govern-
mental agencies already possess. If there is reason to believe that any
teacher has violated his oath, adequate procedures for dealing with him
exist. To cite a teacher to answer questions about his loyalty, thus dam-
aging him in advance of a hearing, to refuse to let him know the
charges against him or confront his accusers, and to discharge him for
declining to answer questions that on their face are impertinent, is an
nn-American invasion of his rights, and another step in the process of
mahin g the teachers of Los An geles second class citizens.

The state of public education in Los Angeles suggests that the
School Board would be better occupied in trying to improve the morale
of the teachers than in tearing it down by harassing members of the
staff whom the Board does not happen to like.

To The Parents Of Our los Angeles School Children

Que Wave the /ifaecaez.’

REMEMBER how barely two years ago
members of your Board of Education were
up on charges of grafting and fraud? Yes,
members of the Board of Education to
whose care you entrust the education of
your children.

Remember how they were caught with
their fingers in rich bus-contracts, and their
faces all smeared with juicy real estate
deals? Remember how four members were
indicted by the Grand Jury? And remember
how three members were dropped from the
Board because the only penalty under the
law for misusing the funds allotted for
your child's education, is removal from of-
fice?

Do you know that before being dropped
these guilty members had the right to ap-
point their successors? And that among the
members they appointed is one who took
a leading part in blocking slum clearance
projects intended to give adequate housing
to 54,000 school children now still living
in disgraceful shacks? Will you explain how
this woman who does not want good hous-
ing for Los Angeles children is sup osed
to care whether your child gets a goo edu-
cation?

And it is to this Board that our State
Legislature has granted in the Dilworth
Act, the right to inquire into the private
opinions and beliefs of teachers! 0 inions
and beliefs are especially protecte from
such inquiries by at least three provisions
of the United States Constitution, and other
provisions in the Constitution of the State
of California. Moreover these teachers have
already been subjected to the Levering Oath
which every public official of California
must take before coming on the public
payroll.

The excuse, of course, is the hoax of
communism. The same excuse that has en-
abled various governmental agencies to call
into question the patriotism of a former
president of the United States, a former

Chief of Staff of the United States Army,
a former Chief Justice of our Supreme
Court.

What makes this Los Angeles Board of
Education suddenly so "patriotic"? Is it
possible that it has something to do with
that old definition of patriotism that Sam-
uel Johnson gave: "the last refuge of the
scoundrel”? That people who are about to
be caught, grab for the flag?

Let’s have a closer look at this.

Here’s Miss Elizabeth Hughes, a teacher
at the 259th Street School: called up by
the Board, she testifies: "I have tahen the
oath of allegiance to the Constitutions of the
United States and the State of California.
And I have sworn under oath that I do not
helieve in the violent overthrow of the
government, nor helong, nor ever have he-
onged to any organization that advocate:
the violent overthrow of the government.”

The Dilworth Act authorizes your Board
of Education to dismiss any teacher who
does not answer to the Board's satisfaction.
Miss Elizabeth Hughes’ answer was not con-
sidered satisfactory, and she was fired.

Now let’s see whether this helps your
child's education. The frightening fact in
the educational news of this town is the re-
sults of the so-called "X” tests. These tests
show that Los Angeles school children were
better in spelling and arithmetic two years
ago than they are today. In short, our educa-
tional system is not moving ahead, it is
not even keeping up: it is falling behind.

This fact caused violent altercations at
the regular meetings of the Board of Educa-
tion in which members accused the super-
intendent of schools Dr. Stoddard, who
answered heatedly, flinging the blame right
back at the Board: "Yon’re not helping the
children of this community one hit. Let’s
call a spade a spade . . . You wouldn't

give us the extra clerical help or the 500

remedial teachers we asked for two years
ago, and now you try to hlame as . . . I

._3_

  

think the uicker you let my staff get to
work on toe problem the better it's going
to be for the parents and children.”

It seemed for a while that this quarrel
between the superintendent of schools and
the Board over the im ortant question of
your child's educationa needs and stand-
ards, would be brought to a head. Instead
the whole subject was buried by transform-
ing your Board from a Board of Education
into another one of those witch-hunting
groups that undermine the ideals of Amer-
ica.

Now here’s Charles I. Sassoon of John
Muir Junior High. Summoned before the
Board, he stated under oath: "I have at-
tested to my loyalty many times, and I
pledge allegiance to the flag every morning
along with all my pupils in my home class-
room. The Board knows very well that I
have committeed no crime or engaged in
any unlawful conspiracy. If the Board has
any evidence of crime committed by me, I
invite you to go to the District Attorney
and file formal charges.”

How the dismissal of Charles Sassoon is
going to solve the crisis in Los Angeles
Education, no one can imagine. The city
will obviously still be the fastest growing
community in the United States. It will
still be needing a new 500-pupil-school
every week—and won't be getting it. It will
still have 25,000 children on half-day ses-
sions, being cheated out of a good slice of
their educational needs.

Los Angeles will still have a shortage
of psychiatrists and child guidance person-
nel. No one knows how many of these
children move along blindly from year to
year with no clear idea of what job to
prepare for. Far too many children, reach-
ing their seventeenth year go. out into life
with no idea of where they fit. The school
system washes its hands of them; and in
time the police departments, the hos itals,
the organizations for financial relie , the
mental institutions step in and try to right
what should not have been neglected in the

"Every intellectual who is called before
one of the committees ought to refuse
to testify. It is shameful for a blameless
citizen to submit to such an inquisition.”

——DR. ALBERT EINSTEIN

schools. Now is the time to expand guid-
ance for disciplinary cases. Now is the time
to expand courses in family life, courses on
consumer education.

Can this be what the Board has in mind
when it calls u Mrs. June Sirell, teacher
for the last eig t years at the Northridge
Elementary school?

Mrs. June Sirell testified as to her dis-
tinguished record as a demonstration teach-
er, which has brought her letters of praise
from her superiors and offers from several
universities. She added: "Although all teach-
ers—-including myself — have signed state-
ments that we have not knowingly belonged
to organizations advocating the violent ov-
erthrow of our government, this Board seeks
to extract other and further oaths, guaran-
tees, promises and confessions. The entire
framework of this proceeding is that of an
inquisition, calling on me to defend myself
against charges of which I am kept in ig-
norance, charges made by people unknown
to me.”

Concerning this multiplication of oaths,
Chief Justice of the California Supreme
Court Gibson, said in a unanimous decision:
“. . . The Le islature has enacted a general
and detaile scheme requiring all state
employees to execute a prescribed oath
relating to loyalty and faithful perform-
ance of duty, and it could not have in-
tended that they must at the same time
remain subject to any such additional loy-
alty oaths or declarations as the particular
agency employing them might see fit to
impose. Multiplicity and duplication of
oaths and declarations would not only re-
flect seriously upon the dignity of state
employment, but would make a travesty
of the effort to secure loyal and suitable
persons for government service.”

Why does our Board go against the
decision of the highest court of our State?
Is it perhaps because not so long ago the
Board worried about what the teachers
thought of them and sent around a ques-
tionnaire. The result of this poll showed that
81 per cent, yes 81 per cent, of our teachers

, had no confidence in the Los Angeles Board

of Education. Just imagine a business in
which the employees would vote four out of
five that they had no respect for their
management. How long would the stock-
holders permit such a state of affairs? And
don’t think that teaching your child isn’t

_4__

 

 

a big business in Los Angeles. It is in fact
the biggest business in California.

Since any teacher may be called upon to
answer before the Board, since the charges
are kept secret, and the person who made
the charges is not brought into the pro-
ceedings where he might be questioned,
teachers will be careful in the future as to

’ how they answer a poll about their confi-

dence in their Board.

But whether it will help your child to
spell and calculate better, is doubtful.

Perhaps the dismissal of still another
teacher will help. Mrs. Claire S. Kaye of
the 79th Street School, is called up. She is
a Phi Beta Kappa for excellent scholarship.
Her rating as a teacher is “outstanding.” She
states: "It is shocking to me that during

the very week the Bill of Rights of our.

American Constitution is being commem-
orated, I should be called before this body
and required by you to relinquish those very
rights or face dismissal action. You, the
members of this Board of Education have
presented me and every teacher with an ir-
reconcilable contradiction. On the one hand
I have pledged to uphold our Constitution
and to abide by its principles. On the other
hand I am required to surrender to you
the rights accorded to me and to every
American by that document, or else be de-
prived of making my living the best way I
know how.”

Mrs. Kaye made her choice: she decided
to abide by the American Constitution. She
didn’t know that in Los Angeles there is
a higher authority than the American Con-
stitution, namely the Board of Education.
Mrs. Kaye was dismissed.

Of course the Board of Education con-
siders that the big issue of the moment is
not that your child isn’t learning to spell
or to add and multiply satisfactorily, nor that
the spirit of the American Constitution is
being trampled on, but that the hoax of
communism has invaded our classroom.

Proof? Well, proof is hard to come by.
The Dilworth Act itself explains the pre-
dicament of the Board, and incidentally ex-
cuses them from taking the matter to -the
regular courts. It says under Sec. 12600-e:
“This type of propaganda is sufficiently
subtle as to escape detection in the class-
room.” How propaganda so subtle as to
escape detection can be at the same time "a
clear and present danger” to your child

and to your country, baffles the imagina-
tion.

But such are these times! Recently, for
example, a principal of one of your Los
Ange es schools called in the head of the
school library and informed her that he
had information that there was a subversive
book on the shelves.

"That’s impossible,” the librarian declar-
ed. "I’ve been over the library with a fine-
tooth comb.” ’

"But I have information that such a
book is on your shelves,” the principal in-
sists. "And it must be removed at once.”

"Very well,” says the librarian. "I will
have it removed. What is the book?”

"I don’t know,” says the principal. "My
informant doesn’t say.”

"Well, ask him,” the librarian says, "and I
will be glad to take the offending book off

the shelves.”

"I can’t ask him,” the principal explains.
"He doesn’t sign his name to his letter.”

Such is the atmosphere in which your
child is being educated. The principal is
afraid that he may suddenly be hauled up
before a Board and asked to explain about
"communism” in his library. The librarian is
at her wits’ end. They go over the whole
library again and remove everything that
might’ possibly be considered subversive, even
a volume on Housing for which only a few
years ago $2,000 of public money was ap-
propriated so that every school library
might havea copy. Who knows: that may
be the book. At any rate it’s safer with
that book in the cellar than in the library.
In fact, the more books in the cellar and the
less in the library the safer it is.

You can’t tell what may happen with this
Board of Education. Isn't this the Board
that is threatened by a constantly growing
teacher shortage, and aware of the fact
that the youth of our country is turning
away from teaching as a profession, thus
compounding an already critical situation,
nevertheless refused an offer of $335,000

"The power of investigation is limited.
In uiry into personal and private af-
fairs is precluded.”

by the Ford Foundation for a teacher-train-
ing program designed to provide trained
teachers for your children?

What did the Los Angeles Board of
Education do about this offer? Why it
threw up its lilywhite hands in horror. Take
money from busses and real estate deals,
yes, yes, but from the Ford Foundation?
Never! Why the Ford Foundation is red!
School bussses come in all sorts of colors.

Dr. Robert M. Hutchins said: "It may
be there are people so near the fringe of
lunacy as to call Paul G. Hoffman (former
president of the Studebaker Automobile Co.
and later director of the Ford Foundation)
a pink, But I hnow of no other community
in which such people are allowed to run
the school board.”

But in Los Angeles, Mrs. Minna Cooper
is discharged from the 10th Street School
after she testifies before the Board: "As a
loyal American citizen, I have devoted the
major part of my life to the care and educa-
tion and welfare of children. I have tried to
teach the children moral and spiritual values,
good citizenship, and to cherish the princi-
ples of democracy for which this country
has stood for many generations. I challenge
this Board or anyone to produce any evi-
dence of any teaching by me contrary to the
above principles.”

Mrs. Minna Cooper’s dismissal helps.
Yes, that helps when all over the city
teachers are required to handle from four
to eight children more than anyone can
competently manage and still keep up class-
room standards in learning and discipline.
Yes, that helps when whole areas, for ex-
ample in the Harbor and the Valley can’t
get audio-visual aids for instruction because
there is only one supply center to serve a
school district that is ten times the size of
the average American school district.

Well of course, where to get the money
for all the needs of the Los Angeles district
is a big roblem. Yet, when the citizens
voted to give the Board an extra hundred
and two million dollars, what did the Board
do? Why they felt that better than devote
this money to your children's education it
would be smarter to reduce the school taxes

so that the taxpayers would get a hundred"

and two million dollars of tax relief, and
your child would get none of it in addi-
tional schooling. It’s true that the citizens
voted that money to the school system and

 

not to be handed back to taxpayers, but the
Board has other fish to fry.

But back to Dave Arkin, art teacher at
John Adams Junior High. Dave Arkin stat-
ed: "This is the Holiday Season, a time
when the spirit of ‘peace on earth, good will
to all men,’ should prevail. The entire stu-
dent body of my school is actively engaged
in the preparation of a Christmas pro ram.
I am in c arge of an essential art o that
program. That the Board 0 Education
should have chosen this time to bring me
before them seems to be in the poorest taste.
It has taken me from my duties without at
first considering whether there would be any
serious disruption in the school program.”

How will the dismissal of Dave Arkin
cover up the 10 per cent slash in physical
education equipment, in art materials, in
paper and pencils? How will this com en-
sate for the shortage of school texts w ich
makes it necessary for many classes to open
without textbooks, or with substandard and
obsolete texts? How will it overcome the
fifty per cent cut in the purchase of new
books for school libraries? It isn't very clear.

But your school Board isn't solving these
problems merely by dismissing people. One
member has a brilliant plan to overcome the
school crisis. He has proposed the cutting
out of the whole kindergarten program. And
he goes further: he proposes that the city
cut out its whole first grade program. And
its second grade program. Your child in-
stead of starting school in his sixth year
would not start until his ninth year. The sav-
ing would obviously be terrific. Indeed that
saving could be increased still more by still
further cuts. Indeed this member of the
Board of Education has really opened up
a dizzying vista that could lead to a com-
plete cutting out of all grades, leaving noth-
ing but a Los Angeles Board of No-Educa-
tion.

The Board also summoned Leon Goldin
of the Kester Avenue School. He said:
"When I became a teacher I tooh a sacred
oath to uphold and defend the Constitution
of the United States and of the State of
California. When I was hired by the Board
of Education I also tooh a loyalty oath. I
tooh these oaths with full realization of their
meanings.—-Having tahen my degree in the
social sciences I ac uired a great respect for
the rich history 0 my country and for its
institutions and traditions. I have always

_5....

 

tried to teach my children the same respect
for their country.”

But Leon Goldin saw no reason why the
School Board should have the power to de-
prive him of his Constitutional rights of free
thought and opinion. He knew that our
own Los Angeles associate superintendent of
schools, Mr. Findlay, had written a textbook
called YOUR RUGGED CONSTITUTION,
in which it said: "Congress cannot stop you
from saying, writing or printing almost any-
thing you like. Congress cannot keep you
from meeting peaceably with other people to
talk about anything you like. Congress can-
not keep you from asking your government to
correct something that you think is wrong.”

Leon Goldin made the mistake of think-
ing that the Los Angeles Board of Education
is limited by the same Constitution which re-

strains the Congress of the United States. He ’

was wrong. And the Board dismissed him.

Don’t forget that it is this Board that
threw out the United Nations program from
our city schools. It is true that the Gallup
Poll recently showed that three out of every
four Americans hold with the United Na-
tions. It is true that the United Nations was
founded in our own San Francisco. It is true
that its ‘world headquarters is in our own
New York. It is even true that the local
UNESCO educational program was prepared
under the sponsorship of our own local su-

perintendent of schools, Dr. Stoddard. It is
true that President Eisenhower, along with
many res ected members of our community
had wor s of praise for this program.

But not your Board of Education. Oh no,
they weren’t fooled one bit. Some members
of the Board might fool others about real es-
tate deals and bus contracts, but you can't slip
anything past them in the way of subversive
foreign policy. In this era of world history
with the hydrogen bomb already with us and
with the cobalt bombs and other horrors
right ahead, and nothing but world under-
standing between us and annihilation, your
Board of Education tossed UNESCO right
out the window. UN clubs were dissolved
throughout the schools. Students were pro-
hibited from competing in the traditional
UN essay contest. World Friendship clubs
were abandoned.

Indeed the Board went even further: it
directed teachers to discourage the study of
controversial issues. Inter-cultural courses
were abandoned. Even the teaching of Pan-
American history in the ninth grade was
done away with since that might involve
touching on discussion of issues of the day.
Courses on Ancient History were submitted
as being safer.

It is a fact that in this manner your Los
Angeles Board of Education has become the
laughing stock of the educational world. But

your Board is not in the least put out by
that. It has determined that your child shall
not have a teacher who thinks, or encour-
ages your child to think. If your child hap-
pens to be curious about the world he lives
in, that's just too bad. He'll soon learn to
say nothing and leave hismind alone.

For by the time the Board has called up
the hundred and seventy-one school employ-
ees it promises to summon, the average
teacher will begin to get the idea that he
must either tell the Board what the Board
wants to hear, or else forfeit his job. And
having limited teaching in Los Angeles to
those who are willing to give up their Con-
stitutional rights rather than their means of
livelihood, the Board will have no difficulty
taking, those same American rights away from
your child.

It may surprise some that the Board of Ed-
ucation was only interested in the hoax of
communism and had no questions about mis-
conduct or competence. There are parents
who may be worried about the alleged
growth of addiction to narcotics among teen-
agers, but not your Board, no. They are wor-
ried only about an attachment to the princi-

les of the Bill of Rights among the mem-

Eers of the teaching staff.
Obviously unless the citizens of Los An-

PROTECT OUR SCHOOLS !

geles begin to show a greater interest in how
their schools are run, begin to care more
deeply about the teacher shortage, begin to
worry about the increasing half-day sessions,
begin to realize fully the danger of over-
crowded classrooms, begin to interest them-
selves actively in the question of whether
their children are learning about the real
world they must live in, just so long will
their Board of Education turn to graft or
to Dilworth Acts and neglect the real crisis
and the real issues.

In addition, as long as the "X” tests con-
tinue to show a further decline in children's
ability to spell and to calculate, the big prob-
lems of juvenile delinquency, minority rela-
tions, career counseling, and personality de-
velopment will all remain umolved.

Yes, as the parents of Los Angeles watch
the pyrotechnical display of “patriotism” by
the Board of Education, they had better re-
member old Samuel Johnson’s definition:
“Patriotism is the last refuge of the scoun-
drel.” The real atriot doesn't have to make
a big display o his sincere and dee ly felt
emotions. The job of the Board of E ucation
is to promote education and not to become
another witch-hunting committee concerned
with “propaganda sufficiently subtle to es-
cape detection in the classroom.”
