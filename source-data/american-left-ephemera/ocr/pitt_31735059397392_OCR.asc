Naturally gay life isn't all wine and roses,
but it's the only way you can live without
hating yourself through and through. Being with
men means you hate yourseIf...how can you like
yourself when you're always holding back -
denying every thought,every feelin you have?
Slavery was abolished a long time ago but the
males want all women to be their slaves...to keep
,their houses and clothes clean...then when they
decide they're horny - well, you're supposed—T
to spread your legs and lay back and enjoy pure
heaven. Fuck that shit! There isn't a man alive
who really knows what it is to love...to'
really care for someone else...all they love
in the end is their pricks...and the prick power
it brings them. ,

Everyine thinks J'm a lesbian because of bad
experiences with men ( are there really any “good”
ones?). Well, I was a lesbian before I ever knew
what a man was. I think it's time we should fight
for our freedom. We can love women...we do love
women and we can't be stopped. I even think men
know that - in their hatred for us is fear -
cauz their afraid of losing “their” women...

The great superior man isn't worth shit. They
think they have it so rough “working all day to
make ends meet.” Well, they should try gettin a
job or findin a place to live when you're a les-
oian. .

The impression they have of a lesbian is that
she is out to rape all women ( just because they
want all women , they have to put that shit down
on us) that she dresses like a man, looks like
a man and is always being mistaken for a man.
Well I'm over that shit. Yes I'll dress the way
I want to - but don't classify me in the same
category as a man. I'M NOT. I'M A WOMAN. They just
keep all the good things for themselves...men's
clothes are cheaper and better made...men's shoes
are better for your feet and BETTER_MADE for the
money...thermal underwear keeps you warm in the.
cold cold winter...long hair can be so easily
pulled if you are tryin to protect yourself...
I'm just trying to be myself - to be strong
and healthy- but no one will let me. If I want
to walk down the street holding the woman I love
I will? and from now on I'm not gonna be embarrassed
or anything. I'M TIRED OF HAVING TO HIDE MY FEELINGS!
IF society gets “upset” by that - tough - hetero-
sexuality makes mg_sick...I think it's perverted

- it destroys so many women. '
LET ALL THOSE OTHER PEOPLE TAKE A LOOK AT THEIR
LIVES...LET THEM BE ASHAMED. I'M NOT HIDING MY
FEELINGS ANY DRE AND I'M DEFINITELY NOT ASHAMED
OF BEIN A LESBIAN. MY PARENTS ARE ‘ASHAMED ' BE-

'CAUSE I'M NOT THE IDEAL ‘STRAIGHT’ DAUGHTER THEY

HAD IN MIND...INSTEAD I'M THE CREEP OF THE WHOLE
FAMILY...THE PERVERTED ONE...THE SICK ONE. WELL,
I THINK A MALE AND FEMALE RELATIONSHIP IS PRETTY
SICKENING ...BUT THAT DOESN”T CARRY MUCH WEIGHT
AROUND HERE. MY MOTHER SAYS,” OH ME,...wHERE DID
I GO WRONG? I WOULD RATHER SEE YOU DEAD.(I think
all that shit means that she is ashamed to death
cauz her “friends” might find out about her
“queer” dauqhter.)|'D RATHER SEE YOU UNMARRIED
AND KNOCKED UP.". . . . 

WELL MOTHER - I'M UNMARRIED AND INSTEAD OF BEIN
KNOCKED UP , I'M GETTIN KNOCKED AROUND...BUT I'M
FIGHTIN AND GETTIN STRONGER...TO YOU IT'S THE
PERVERTED LESBIAN ( ATTACKER OF WOMEN AND YOUNG
PEOPLE) WHO SHOULD BE LOCKED UP - AND YOU WANTED _
TO LOCK ME UP - BUT THE NORMAL MALE RAPIST...WELL
THEY CAN RUN FREE TO ATTACK YOUNG PEOPLE AND TO
KNOCK GIRLS UP AND THEN TELL THEM THAT THEIR FIN-

= one is shit because we disagree with them.

I ISHED - THAT THEY HAD THEIR BALLING GOOD TIME

AND THAT THE WOMEN CAN HAVE THE CHILD AND STRUGGLE

: ON THEIR OWN...ALL THAT'S OK WITH YOU...

YOU'd RATHER SEE ME LIKE THAT...WELL THINGS A
ARE GONNA CHANGE...
SO FUCK OFF MEN! I DON'T NEED YOU OR WANT YOU.

great ~ UP,itDQlUJ£’-§_

There are a bunch of things that bother us about
Spectre. We spend hours and hours every week fightin
about things that we want to change or do. And in
those fights comes out alot of attitudes that are
bad - old-world garbage. We've changed alot in the
last year together...I used to write stuff suppor-
ting gay men...now I'm writin about male homosex-
uality and supremecy. A few nights ago I dreamt
that I bashed this gay males head in the cement for
all the stuff I 'kept in’ when i was 'friends' with
him. A A

My friend used to think that women who got ‘picked

up‘ were somehow worse than her...cause she

"would have long"relationships'; a while ago she

started to write about all the phoniness of feelin
that way... I I

I used to think I wasn't a racist 'I'd rejected
it' and thought it was bad to be a racist so how
could I be a racist? Now I'm just beginnin to dis-
cover that my racism is in me real deep - as my
northern liberal guilt shit trainin. \ '

I used to have long hair and wear tight shirts,
and I had real investments in it all too. I used
to think I was a lesbian then, but I realize that’
I was a male-world woman...I lived by male-world
rules...

And still alot of stuff is in us. Real hard
things. Now we're fightin about investments in‘
ageism.’ About different kinds of class privilege.
Like how I waste time and energy (and for bad rea-

I sons) lookin for "theory" answers to my questions

instead of bein practical...and just learnin what's
useful. 7

.But what's really important, and what I been
tryin to say but I don't think I been sayin too
good...is that we're workin all the time...and it
will never stop. And we don't think that some- I
To us
what is most important is a committment to work
thru bad attitudes. To change the way we do things.

But what we think we been doin in Spectre that's
bad is that we fight and fight and then finally
all the rage is let out...and we say it in Spectre...
but we don't go thru all the_feelins we had before
we came to feelin the way we do now.

I got caught in my own shit a while ago. I used
to say "smash monogamy"...sex is like shaking hands,
why does everyone make such a big deal about it.
Slowly, and not too long ago, things began to come
clearer in me...just how much monogamy is a male-
world thing - it is possessiveness - it's owner
and object...how women's liberation has said "smash
monogamy" so they didn't have to belong to just
one MAN...I thought about how since I've lived with
Lois that instead of bein less open to other les-
bians (because I live with one lesbian) that I've
become more able to get closer to other lesbians...-
because together we've broken thru alot of shit,
that made me stay distant in the past. Because
together we've helped each other become stronger
and able to get near stuff that is really important
to us...things that hurt, that pain, that fear,
that threaten, that FEEL...so that our love can

_ I realized how dishonest I've been in the past.
How I wouldn't say what I really felt cause I was
scared that nobody would like me. But why was it
so important for people to like me...if I had such
_tremendously different feelins than them? And
Why could THEY say how they felt - even tho
what they said bothered me but I couldn't say‘what
I felt.

‘W I began to get angrier and angrier at male- _
fworld women who accused lesbians of bein "monoga-

Jmous" when those women were still relatin to MEN.'V
VI began to see thier accusations as part of male-
tworld and capitalist trainin..?there's only so
émuch strength to go around so GIVE ME'. That if
'someone does well - it's seen as takin away from
Fsomeone else. And that's how it is in the straight
Lworld. \ , i p ’"
g But we've got to change that. As part of a col-
?lective, we get strength from other lesbians gettin
strength...the male-world cries to lesbians to get.
in bed with those women (to prove they weren't mo-
nogamous) is a male-world ploy to get what they
want... ‘

    
   
  
 
   
   
 
   
 
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
 
  
 
 
 
  
   
   

Yeah, I used to be in a 'threesome' once.

ge'd all sleep together. But we didn't work or
fight together and we didn't help each other thru
roblems...”Sleepin”with someone doesn't say much
about committments... ‘ ' ‘”

But there I go again. I started to say how I
Qsed to say _things that I disagree with now. Yeah,
' believe in 'smash'monogamy' because I belive in
indin heterosexual relations..-but I know that we're
a collective - and that we make committments to

fach other and to other lesbians. That doesn't

°ean that I don't get shakey and scared...but that
_oes mean alot more to me now than "s

Someonetin the. pa.§.t,'used to.‘ mean» I  

“jBu  What I meant by how I got caught in my own
shit was that I told Lois that I was so furious

.t these women who were screamin "smash monogamy”,
Qnd how empty and male-world it was all based on.
,nd then Lois said to me - but just a few weeks

?go you used to feel the same way. And then I
:ealized that that's what happens when I write in
ppectre sometimes. I get really angry about some-
thing and then I say it - but I never talk about
ihe months that went before that when I_acted and
ielt what I was so angry about in Spectre. f
’ And that process of changin is important. It's"
fhe most important to us. There are some lesbians
tho are in a sense closer to us in terms of how
'hey feel and all...but who we don't feel as close
to at all as some lesbians who we have big dis-/ '
.greements with - but who are committed to DOING

'igurin out what to do.
that's most important. '

     

:_ .I've been havin a real hard time about writin
Piand doin SPECTRE lately. Last issue we were real
iuptight about the paper...we were numb when we
;finished putting it together and worried about
;calling what we thought was a lot of shit that
'was being pulled by movement “stars”. I felt

‘real low the whole time we did SPECTRE 5 ...

r at least a lot of the time. The biggest up for
e was typing over some of the letters we got and
ere using.

_This time - more than ever before- I just don't
eel like doin the paper...and have been sort of
rumpy. So far all that I have done is copy some
etters we got...figuring that maybe I can get ‘\ '

leepin" with» «l

why is it easier to get in touch with someone
else's feelings than it is your own? I
I guess I am just real tired...and that's
the simple truth...the fightin is gettin thru to
me...things are gettin tougher..what were
_”fears” or “things that could and probably”
would happen are beginning to hit...my job
is really shakey now...infact its being cut
back a lot and won't be there for too much longer.
It seems that fightin and callin the shit '
shit and not some real big fancy name has
annoyed some very important people where I work
and the word is out that I have to go...
this last year has been full of such heavy
changes for me and I've always been such a‘
chickenshit - so good at “protecting” my
‘job and stuff...a year and a half ago I was
pretty much into making it ( oh in a small ‘com-
fortable' academic way...) and now I feel real,
a hell of a lot better but I get scared...all
the order and security which I squeezed into my

life ( cauz it really made me feel much less anxious)

is goin and gofh fast...

I've learned to get pretty mad anymore...I even
got so pissed about something that I broke all
the pottery I could get my hands on- even '
picked up a chair and threw it across the room.
"It felt damn good - because all my life when I
would get mad I would just start torspin inside
my head and feel like a wild woman - and I never
acted any of it out..,I—was always terrified,of«
the consequences:..well this one day instead of
just standing_thére feeling awful with that spin‘
nin,searchin feeling in my head,..welI I reachedw "
out and just grabbed an ashtray and smashed it. p
But even tho‘ I}m.much=more~in touch with some '“
of my anger - well I know that my anger is still
easier to get close to ( as difficult as that/is)
than my feelins of pain. ’ ‘ .

~And~lately I have been sort of feelin these
little flashes of pain...like being able to talk
more about how awful I felt growing up...how I
hurt a lot of the time...and then there was a
visit we made to some friends - and well one of
them was hurtin a lot...and we just felt her
pain...and thru that I was able to feel my own
pain more and the pain of the women we know
and keep in touch with. I'm crying as I write this
because I ache for all of us and there has beenr
a lot of pain for all of us...gut anguish - what~
ever the fancy words are - a real awful feelin...
and the pain is caught in my throat_- that achin,
chokin, feelin.-.it's almost impossible for me
to let myself cry for my pain ( it's easier to
do for the pain of other people) because I h3Ve
always thought of it as ”self*pity” and as ”selff
indulgent”...so these days I hurt a lot - fo me,
for Jeanne - for the whole scattered community

of women who have managed to get in touch with
each other,share with each other, and become so
important to each other through SPECTRf.

I think about all of us who tried to klll our-
selves - for one reason or another - and the

pain behind all of that. Oh yeah, a lot of us
have that story down pat and tell It without

a flinch...and in fact get a little ruffled if
someone says-something about the pain we must
have felt. We can't face that paIn...at least

not yet for a lot of us...it's so enormous...

and it wasn't because of what the prick male world
likes to think either ( that we are so unhappy
cauz we are ”queer”)...it's the unhappiness,- the
pa1h‘that‘came‘tfbﬁfnélh"tfE%i§ﬁAo?ﬁ$5TlyY..r5?r

‘one thing or another... ‘

Somehow things connect up ...like we can feel
sorry for our oppressors ( our parents, or anyone

,rippin us off...”after all”, the line goes,”they

are feelin human beings too...”) we “understand”
why they did what they did and we feel for their!
empty destructive lives...and we can't get near
the pain and damage they do to us...so what have
most of us done in our agony...gone out and
smashed the person causing it?...oh no we all

‘turned against ourselves...

Over and over we turn things in against ourselves-
it is scarey how much we do it’- and how we don't
even notice it...and sometimes we don't even seem
to have anything to do with it. Like for me - just
before T-giving I was down...I had been fightini
hard and long where I work ...some of the women

' got together in the battles - but there was a lot

of shit that came down on me .
and for all sorts of reasons around here - pretty

much everybody I “worked” with was really pissed
at me... a lot of hostility because I was challeng-
ing some sacred teaching cows... well I was feelin
lousy - whipped... beaten...and so what happens?
T-giving day we were out for a drive and when we
finally got home - well I just doubled up on the
floor in this horrible pain ...and off we went‘

to the Emergency room...after too long they fin-
ally figured out that I had a kidney stone and
then they pumped me ( shot me) full of dope...

Two days later I passed the stone...but you know
what?...Then I felt physically EXACTLY HOW I HAD
FELT EMOTIONALLY.1.and it now was excusable...

I could talk about my pain and how bad it was...

I could get attention and sympathy...I could‘

feel sorry for myself - cauzyyou sure feel

like you've been worked over with swinging sand
bags after a kindey stone...If Jeanne blew on my
kidney area , I screamed...but I could only allow
myself to scream and cry with the physical pain...
and now I guess I believe that somehow my body
made that stone happen so that I could finally
deal with all the pain I had been feelin before
that...That may be a sort of extreme - but I think.
it happens a lot to bunches of us...

I just want to cry again...what I'm writing
seems sort of rambIy...but I guess that's what
happens when any of us start talking about how
we hurt...we ramble a lot...cauz it's hard - hard
to admit - hard to talk about...

But even if I am a long way from workin thru
a lot of things...specific things that I will

‘have to sweat thru...well what is clearer to me!

now is that we have been trained so completely
that we end up worryin about and feelin sorry for
the people who do the rippin off - ignoring or
not even noticing the pain we feel when they rip
us off...and that is just how the oppressors want
E6 keep it...BUT THINGS ARE GONNA CHANGE...IT's
GONNA TAKE HARD WORK ( cauz they sure have put

it deep inside of us) BUT I'M GONNA TRY TO LET
THAT PAIN OUT AND TRY TO HAVE MY ANGER CONNECT

UP TO THAT... I'M NOT GONNA TAKE THINGS OUT ON

ME AND THE PEOPLE I LOVE ANYMORE... I KNOW I'LL
SLIP AND WON'T ALWAYS DO IT THAT WAY...CAUZ IT
REALLY IS EASIER FOR ME TO JUST ACCEPT THAT HURT
AND FEEL FOR OTHER PEOPLE - TO ALWAYS MAKE MY OWN
PAIN AND SUFFERING UNIMPORTANT...BUT I HAVE DONE
THAT - WE HAVE DONE THAT TOO LONG...

Hfkf at-Nadclg the alhrs...-I  

We spent a lot of time these past two months
thinkin about SPECTRE and how some things came
across...we felt we should make the process we

_go thru much clearer...all the defensiveness, the

OF IT!!!

I

uncertainty; the confusion, the not-knowing...
the bein real upset...
Then it came time for SPECTRE6...and

x

I was hav-.W

ing an impossible time...couldn't write anything- *

didn't want to...stuff like that....welI I copied
things and then I sat down and started to write
about how I was feelin and as I sat there and
typed whatever came into my head - well I just
started to cry...and I even wrote about that...
Then it came time to put the paper together...
we had both written things about how.we were
feelin about Spectre...and how we felt pain...
and that is when we started to balk...Marlene
said she thought those articles were shitty...

ythat when she read what I had written about

feelin pain she had several different reactions-
like it was real melodramatic - and she took a
pose with her arm across her farhead and her head
turned to the side...the kind of pose you see in
old silent movies...and maybe when your m ther
was acting hurt ( or at least that is how she
looked to you) and she laughed . . and then
she said another reaction was to want to put ;
a GREAT BIG “BUT” after what I wrote and then A
talk about how strong we were and how we are
happy and how we laugh... L‘ I .
Well, we spent a long time goin thru what those
reactions might mean and where they come from...‘-
It's one thing to let out anger... it's another

thing to talk about hurtin...because that ;

makes you vulnerable...when a whole society hates
what you are and wants to destroy you - well
it's scarey to let it be known that you have
feelings... I t

We also realized that a lot of our negative
reactions to talkin about pain is that in the

‘past people have”used ” hurt to manipulate us..g

and we have used “pain” to manipulate them...
it was a dramatic gesture... I . . I

But I think that the manipulation happens -
ause we can never get the pain out when it happens
so what many of us have done is create a”tragic
heroine ” and wrap ourselves in our pain like long
suffering servants...and we know that's phoney...
we know that that's manipulative... ‘

But this place survives on makin you ashamed
of things...like crying...like aching inside
because it's hard to walk around a place all
day when everyone hates vour guts...

But DAMN IT...I KNOW THAT WE HURT...SELF-
HATE HURTS AND AT DIFFERENT TIMES IN OUR LIVES
WE HAVE HATED OURSELVES...THERE WERE TIMES WHEN
WE WERE ALMOST BROKEN...WHEN WE ALMOST GAVE IN
AND BECAME THE PLASTIC FEELINGLESS ROBOTS THIS
JOINT NEEDS US TO BE...BUT I DON'T IMTEND TO

WALLOW IN THAT PAIN...AND I'M NOT ASHAMED OF IT
I JUST KNOW THAT WE HAVE TO START GETTIN IN TOUCH

WITH OUR PAIN ( Marlene keeps asking me to be more

Vspecific about what pain...she's says Imm bein

distant...but that's just it...I know I ache but
it is real hard to get at just what...that's

how deeply buried it all is...) JUST LIKE WE HAVE
TO BE ANGRY...THOSE TWO THINGS GO TOGETHER...

AND I KNOW THAT I'LL BE STRONGER AND NOT WEAKER
FOR ALLOWING‘ NSELF TO ADMIT THAT THINGS HAVE AND
DO HURT ME AND HURT ME BAD...AND I'M SORRY -
THERE JUST ISN”T ANY “EXPLANATION” THAT '

IS GONNA MAKE ME FORGIVE WHAT HAS BEEN

DONE TO ME AND TO THE OTHER LESBIANS WHO

ARE STRUGGLING...THERE'S NO EXCUSES...

JUST PRICK POWER THAT HAS TO BE DESTROYED...

SO LIKE I SAID...WE”RE NOT GONNA WALLOW

IN OUR PAIN...WE'RE NOT GONNA HIDE IT OR

BE ASHAMED OF IT...WE'RE GONNA EXPLODE OUT

After we printed GUT FEMIEISW, which was a let-
ter from a 'star'/in t q es ian movement and

our reactions...we got some letters from lesbians‘
who were-real pissed at this 'stars' letter. Cause
what she damned wasn't just the ten or so lesbians A
who've physically written Spectre - but all the
llesbians who live what is written in Spectre...all
the lesbians whose actions have created Spectre.

Somethin that really pissed some lesbians was
‘the age chauvinism that this 'star' showed when
she was damning Spectre and said..”the bulk of
your audience are ...possibly runaways from the
youth cultureV. '

Some reactions...from other revolutionary lesbians

'T've reread Spectre 5 and I think that letter
‘from the "star" really gets me pissed off! She
said you "will be a tool for all kinds of bull-
shitters (what about her?), plus agents, to keep
people from doing political work. ~Well shit on
her! Spectre isyjust the opposite!

You tell the truth in plain words that all .

xlesbians can really understand, like callin sexist
lmen what they are - pricks! Instead of these com-
plicated words, jargon etc, that keeps people from:
iﬁnderstandin anything unless they have dictionaries
1@ith them.

;\ Then she made a thing about ”runaways,from the
nouth culture"...correction: MALE-WORLD youth cul-
iure is one thing...but I am a young revolutionary
jesbian...and I been a runaway...so now the "law"
falls me a "wayward minor".. yeah, well, youth
u1ture' as you call it is important to me cause
at you people with age privilege do to us young
ople isn't anything I want in on. A
LDoesn't this "star" understand that it's experi-
fnces that bring out political direction?

i;rAnd what does-she mean.§you can't reach many
 -rkigg_¢1ass women"?? YOU CAN BECAUSE WORKING  
‘(A“‘Ni3‘ I‘“1<Now LOTS‘ OF THEM) LES BIANS AND woMEN

KA note from Spectre...) We wanted to print this
§tars name...but then we decided that what's most
important is to deal with attitudes and actions
that are destructive[..so that we can see them,

and work against them - in ourselves and with each
other. This way we never have to worry about if
socand-so really did this...but we'll know how we

In the NYC women's center, many women read Spectre

Fucker, fucker, fucker - I want you to know that.
from my experiences with Spectre and you all in

we get asked alot why we're so angry.

About a month ago at nursin school we saw a film
on "rehabilitation". It was about a young woman
(very good-lookin.to the male-world of course) who
was in a car accident and broke her back.

When she came to the hospital she couldn't even
sit up (after regular medical treatment). Every-
where she went she had to be moved on a stretcher.
They started her with Physical Therapy. Which
means doin exercises and stuff to strengthen mus-
cles...slowly she was able to sit up again.

You see her goin thru things like usin her arms
to swing herself into a chair. And spendin hours
tryin to dress herself. You see her alone. Frus-
trated. Crying. Wantin to die. You see her worry
about going back into the straight world cause she
feels useless..."unattractive"...and everyone stares,
and doors are impossible to open cause no one cares
or thinks about handicapped people even tho there A

x are hundreds of thousands of 'handicapped' people.

But then, they're only 'handicapped' because
that's what this place makes them...because this
place grinds into everyones head that they are
CRIPPLED -,USElESS%..and then these people are =
kept‘behind closed doors - and how many of us.-

ylearned french or spanish or geography in high“ .“"”
school and WHAT USE WAS IT?? BUT HOW MANY'QF US

HAVE IEARNED SIGN LANGUAGE OR BRAILLE?

And i sat there in the middle of 250 nursin
students watchin this film. And I looked around
and there they were - short skirts - to show
their meat off to men - so they can be bought for
more. There they were with expensive boots and
coats, and bracelets, and hair pins, and_bags,
and there they were in nursin school to "help"
other people - like this woman. Shit.

This woman alone in a room. It's small.

It takes her about seven minutes to get herself
from her wheelchair to her bed and under the
covers and she falls back exhausted.

Now she has leg braces and arm crutches and

,she's learnin to take her first few steps again.

But more than anythin she want to be like she
was before. She 's learned alot about car-
pentry - how to operate machines and looms...
she's learned some real good skills. But that
pain keeps drivin thru you like a big needle
bein struck down your throat and into your gut.
Somethin's all wrong. Pain and then anger.

And then it's happens. Her final achievement.
She's gonna try to climb a flight of stairs.
.There are four of them. She stands at the bottom
in braces and with her crutches and you look up
at the top of those four steps. It looks hard.
But possible. She starts and when she finally
gets to the top I was cryin hard and so was she.
But then that anger again flashes out. Anger
that I'm cryin - CAUSE IT"S ALL WRONG.

And she said when she got to the top -

"I always wanted to climb a mountain”.

And I asked myself why it was 'climbin a moun-
tain'...cause all the pain and worry involved,
wasn't for climbin the stairs - that was work
just like any other work - it's hard, you try.

_ ple -

Sometimes you have to start over. And you're
tired when you finish.

But the pain...the crying, the anguish.
That was somethin else. That was bein con-
sidered USELESS and UGLY and for a woman -
who is only worth her body - all this woman's
value had been taken away in her eyes - and
in the eyes of the rest of the world.‘ No matter

~ .she could do carpentry - that she could feel,

it was her BODY. And not because she couldn't

run down the block. But because she was'ugly'..
and who would care about her.

And then we had to go to our 'discussion'
groups after the film and the other women talked
about how they'd 'help' these"poor crippled people".
And their faces were expression1ess...held still
by their make-up and they all looked like some- -
thing out of a fancy woman's magazine from NY.

And I didn't say anything - I couldn't say any-
-thing, cause I was still chokin on the pain that
was in my throat and my stomach and the anger I
felt. Anger that those women were gonna give their
condescendin "help"...no they don't work with peo-
that's a part of privilege...you "give"
things down to people that were never yours in the
first place and then they're dependent on you and
grateful to you. "Help", shit it makes me sick.
"help" in this joint is somethin that makes the
people who you're 'helpin' somethin less than

you - you the almighty giver - you tell them they're
worthless, make themmfeel ugly and ashamed - and
then you got the upper hand - and then you give
them a little 'help' on top for a little more
praise to your big ego. -

/And I felt so fuckin angry at men for makin
women nothin but a piece of meat - and MAKING
‘handicapped’ people useless. And I was angry
at those women who were sittin there feelin very
highly about themselves because theywere goin to
'help' this "poor woman" and I wanted to scream“
at them that what had crippled and hurt that wo-»
man so much,was exactly the things they were doin,
and that they valued so much.

I guess we can all feel that pain so much,
cause there aren't many of us who didn't want to
look pretty and attractive and have nice legs-
and the pain we felt if we didn't look that way -
‘cause there was nothin else for a woman.

And that's what we got to change. And then I
get angry when I see all these pictures of these
'beutiful" sisters in all the lesbian and women's’
papers. ‘D '

Yeah we get angry. Angry for the years we spent
bein a trash can for men to masturbate into. Angry
for the worthlessness we felt and that so many peo-
ple feel.

THE QUESTION ISN'T, "WHY ARE WE so ANGRY?", BUT
WHY THE HELL.ARE YOU NOT ANGRY?"

So for all our angry friends who are gettin shit
from lesbians and women who like to smile alot and
be "friendly, friendly" while all the shit keeps
comin down behind smiles and denial or accusations -
like "you just alienate with your anger"...we figure
it's about time we stop 'explainin' why we're so

angry and that these other wmen start tellin why(1l+ )

they aren't. _

As we've grown together...we've found alot better
things to base our trust and committments on. We've
started to love each other and ourselves in a way
that we never thought was possible. Lesbians don't
want praise for learnin a skill well and bein able
to do it - what MATTERS IS GETTIN THE SKILLS AND
SHARIN THEM WITH OTHER LESBIANS. SHARIN... SHARIN
PROBLEMS, SKILLS,NEEDS,SUPPORT, WORK, CRITICISM

.LE$61AnI on pigs . :.c':'S6M

-THAT'S THE REAL BASIS FOR SELF-TRUST AND MUTUAL
TRUST.

AND WHEN WE SEE HOW ALL OF THIS IS DESTROYED

'IN THIS JOINT - WHEN WE SEE HOW WOMEN ARE RAPED

AND MURDERED _-_ HOW PATIENTS ARE TREATED IN ,
HOSPITALS - HOW WE ARE ALL MANGLED EVERYDAY...

— WELL THEN WE DO FEEL PAIN...AND THAT RAIN LEADS

TO ANGER - BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE WAYS
OF CARING AND STRUGGLING THAT MAN LIFE FOR US -
NOT DEATH...AND BECAUSE WE LOVE OURSELVES AND EACH
OTHER WE CAN ONLY HATE EVERYTHING AND EVERYBODY
THAT DESTROY OR TRY TO DESTROY THAT STRUGGLE.

SO IF YOU'RE NOT ANGRY AT wHAT GOES ON..-
wHY THE HELL AREN”T YOU???MAYBE YOU'RE AN
ACCOMPLICE IN ALL OF IT???MAYBE THAT'T WHY

YOU'RE NOT ANGRY...MAYBE THAT'S WHY YOU'RE
NOT FIGHTIN....

I

-i..\\,
Flcuféﬁ -

We've spent alot of time in Spectre talkin about
how to fight and all...and not so much about where.
We know that bein in a college town like Ann Arbor
is impossible. Too many people with too much to
protect...shit even the old SDS'ers write stuff»,
that only someone who's spent 25 years in school
could read. So we will leave. First we wanna fi-
nish gettin some skills so we can survive and help
keep a collective and more lesbians alive and able
to fight. ’ '

And that's real important to us. fHavin skills
that are useful - skills that will help us be able
to survive by gettin pay - and skills that we can
use at the same time - to sﬁrvive without men...
and to use as we begin to try to tear this joint

  ;1‘_STO'FF  

 c p  .. .. . »/‘.»r-‘ -::.,._,.,,,_.,,. ,,“~,;;

There are lots of skills that we need.i We can
get them at training schools, at night schools,
correspndence schools, community colleges...things
like medical skills are important, computer stuff
(the "government" relies alot on computers), gettin
presses so we can keep printin even when the Man
cracks down even more and says we're "illegal"...
We need skills in electronics and electricity and
in radio transmitting. With the use of liberated
radio stations the people of one country managed
to coordinate the blockin of enemy trains - the
switchin of street signs so the enemy got lost...
in fact ended up OUTSIDE of the country they in-
vaded. We need lesbians skilled in locksmithin
and auto mechanics. Plumbin and carpentry will
he needed for us to have shelter. Lesbians will
really be needed who know how to operate certain
machines - big trucks and who know how to fly -
and not just small planes, but even commercial
jets. .

After this weﬂre gonna list some addresses of
places to write about different skills...and some
books that are real good and clear and basic.

Unfortunately some lesbians are havin a hard
enough time survivin doin hard work just to eat.
Some lesbians we know spend long night hours wai-
tressin and another lesbian we know is-workin in
a factory with Cyanide and acid on her hands an
in her nose and mouth and lungs and she's too
scared to complain about it because "there's
plenty of other girls just waitin to get your
job girl”. And overtime isn't somethin you do,
to make extra money when you need it...it's some-_
thin you do every week so you don't get fired...
and any job is better than nothin and 20% of
the workin people in the kountry are unemployed.

But we also know that there are lesbians with
alot more money or access to money than they need.
And that if we share this._ If we'work as collec-
tives we can all survive...help each other get
skills - some people work jobs while others go
to school. Or work full-time and go to school
part-time, or the other way around.

But we have to get these skills if we're goin
to survive. Gettin skills is probably alot harder
for people in real small towns where there aren't
any night schools or comunity colleges. But ther
are correspndence programs - even for medical skills
Things like medical assistant and medical technician
(real good - you learn to identify comon blood and
urine problems that indicate certain deseases, under

.the microscope).

We really think it's important for all of us
to look at what we're doin carefully and see if
what we're doin is really useful - even if gettin
a skill seems impossible right away - if there are
no other lesbians to help support and all — jobs
like nurses aid gives access to people who can help
us learn, and it gives access to medical supplies.
We also have to learn self-defense. We don't

'need expensive karate lessons - or formal shit.

we need to be strong...able to run long distances
and fast without runnin out of breath. We need

to learn how to kick hard and a few punches...

if you know a woman who has taken a self-defense
course - get her to teach you some holds and
stuff...but you can also learn a hell of a lot

by just free fightin with friends...yeah, you

get some banged up fingers and sore muscles - but

'it's great practice...you make up things as you

i‘go and you gain a lot of confidence.‘

And just

.taking a half hour a day to do some exercises

is real important...things like push-ups,sit-ups,

gchin-ups...well when we started we couldn't do
;QneNpush_up...now we are up to 30. Even watchin

A-some

some fights on TV (Avengers...) can give you
ideas. _ ‘
_We need to learn to defend ourselves with weapons

.y- the weapons that men and their agents- male-world

'women- use against us.

If we don't do this then

: we are choosing to be murdered rather than/fight

to live...and that's bein an accomplice to our

..own murder. And why is it ok to help murder our-
. selves but no ok to even defend ourselves from

. :r:r;>._;*:;=;;1;_;1§g;’_m:« ' x fI~’,<i”",/":V3.9'ff‘=“-""'  :9" _~

other people. That's what this joint relies on...
our masochism..our willingness to hate and de-
stroy ourselves. But in revolutionary collectives
every lesbian is important - and NO LESBIAN HAS
THE RIGHT TO BE UNKIND, OVERLY CRITICAL OR
DESTRUCTIVE OF HERSELF...

Sure, we've been brought up to be scared

;shitless of violence and of guns...cauz we're
: usually the victims of that violence...and

E most of us didn't learn to hunt -

.‘to maintain law and order”.

if that
was even part of “family life”...and then
again many of us have been raised in middle

,,and upper class families where” violence is

'crude'...and guns are things seen on TV
or in the movies”...because upperclass
violence is smoother...more impersonal...
less direct ...but upperclass violence
kills millions...they just never call it
violence...it's “war” or “necessary strictness
Well - its a good

Q6)

lfeeling not to have a nervous breakdown when

you get near a gun...to get used to handling them-
If you live in a university town...well there

"usually is a rifle club that uses the ROTC range...
;and it's cheap...they'll even teach you to shoot

REP called FIREARMS AND SELF-DEFENSE (50¢ -REP
PO Box 56l-A, Detroit,Mi.48232) Another thing

you can do ( after reading the REP book) is go
to a gun shop to look at guns...and just ask a
few questions...what happens is amazing...males
have such big-prick egos that they just love to
show off how much they know - so ( because you're
a dumb woman) they'll tell you a whole lot about
guns and ammo , and what to do in this situation,
and all sorts of things...oh yeah...remember...
OWNING GUNS IS A CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT!hA.H‘,

We really do think that gettin skills is about
the most important thing that we can be doin right
now...all sorts of skills...and we're gonna try
to put more in SPECTRE about what we're_learnin

hand what other women are learnin...and maybe

we can help you get in touch with collectives
which are settin up clinics and presses and stuff..

A woman's paper reprinted this short paragraph
on ageism, called MURDER, that we printed in
Spectre 4...after it comes comments they made...
after that...a whole lot more.-..

****************************
MURDER

THE IEADIN CAUSE OF CHILD DEATHS FROM BIRTH
TO PUBERTY IS "ACCIDENTS". SHIT, THEY AREN'T
”ACCIDENTS"...THEY'RE MURDERS. IN NURSIN SCHOOL
WE WERE TOLD THAT AROUND 50% OF THESE "ACCIDENTAL"
DEATHS ARE BATTERED CHILDREN...THE POLITE WAY OF
SAYIN THAT THE LEADIN CAUSE OF DEATH IN YOUNG
PEOPLE IS MURDER BY THEIR PARENTS. _

"ACCIDENTS"? GODDAMIT, YOUNG PEOPLE'S BONES
ARE FIEXIBLE...THEY DON'T BREAK EASY - THEY'RE
ALMOST LIKE A WAD OF CUSHION....

********a*********************
Quote from the woman's paper that reprinted this..
"The charge of parents with the

murder of children made me quite an-

gry...Living with children...is very

hard...Being a parent, especially a

mother, is as oppressive to the adults

as to the children".
fame Mac!-tans ~ ~ - -.

« Well, we'd goddamed like to ask you that if the

‘charge of murder makes you "quite angry", what the

fuck do you think it does to the young people who
are murdered...the young people who are battered
and tortured...the young people who are held cap-
tive in "homes", and who are put away for leavin H
these scenes of torture... 5

_Yeah, it's shit bein married to a prick - V
caterin to him..."ownin" children...but how the
hell Can You say it's just as hard to be the
one with the age privilege as it is to be the
objects of that crap..SHIT SHIT SHIT...so the

»”mother" gets frustrated...doesn't like what'her

kids‘ do - so, she beats them...tells them to

go to their room, has the threat of them knowin
that they CAN'T survive if they try to leave...
but what about when the young people get angry,
frustrated, sick of the humiliation and shit put
down by their "parents"...what can they do? Run-
away to be caught by pigs and thrown in concen-
tration camps...tell thier "parents" that they
don't like the way THEY act...and they better
start changin? Hah!

Thousands and thousands of young people are
murdered every year by their "parents”...and
thousands more are beaten...how many young people
kill "parents”?? That's the most obvious bru-
tality...the power is all one way.

This woman talked about "how hard it is for
mothers”... WELL GODDAMIT THAT PISSES THE SHIT
OUT OF US...AS WOMEN AND YOUNG PEOPLE WE BEEN
TRAINED TO DO NOTHIN BUT PAY ATTENTION TO "HOW
HARD IT IS" ON EVERYONE ELSE BESIDES OURSELVES".
YEAH SO BEIN A MALE IS PRETTY EMPTY AND SICKENIN,
BUT I SURE DON'T FEEL SORRY FOR A MAN WHEN HE
RAPES A WOMAN, AND BEIN A WOMAN AND "MOTHER" IS
PRETTY EMPTY AND SICKENIN IN THIS JOINT, BUT
WE'LL BE GODDAMED IF WE'RE GONNA FEEL SORRY
WHEN SHE MURDERS AND DESTROYS YOUNG PEOPLE BE-
CAUSE SHE GOT AGE PRIVILEGE, BUT THEN THAT'S

BROUGHT UP WITH. WE'RE NOT ALLOWED TO FEEL THE
SHIT THEY DO TO US - ONLY HOW "HARD IT IS" FOR
THEM AND HOW WE HURT THEM.

Ageism is a sickenin tool used to torture

‘ and threaten young people so we can be well-

trained into all the shit ass ideas this joint
brings us up with...what better tool to train a
person than to have EVERY power over them if they
don't ‘obey? That's why the U.S doesn't need the
"ORDERS OF NIXON" to be memorized in school...
they've got the "family" to do it for him...and
all the rest like him.. ,

This woman's collective that did the reprint,
also said,

"It's very easy for people

who don't spend a great deal of

time with young people to talk

about what to do and what not to

do with them”.

What to do with them? ‘Not how to change our
Yeah, well we got a different
question...how easy it is for all of us to let i
all those "good fee1ins"..all that "understandin"
in, when we don't have to live every minute un-
der the torture of thier "guidance" anymore...
just how easy is that? How much did we hate them
then for their power over us...because they could

' do what ever they damed well pleased to us...but

we could never even say moreless DO anythin about
things we didn't like about them...what were those
experiences, and why have so many of us 'forgotten'
them...because what those experiences tell us

makes us feel that pain again...and we don't wanna

- feel that - cause it might make us angry - and

we might do somethin about it — and we don't wanna
change...cause that's too threatenin.....????

Lets all go back...to our experiences as young
people..or see them as they are for us now...and
FEEL those experiences..maybe some of us will be
able to stop thinkin about " how hard it iS" for
our 'parents' and know what is bein done to young
people...and how we continue ageism with our
ways......... ‘

14 years old lesbian...runawa ...

When I ran away, I headed to California to hide
there til I was 18. I ended up with a small pack
on my back, no food, a sleeping bag and $3, that
went fast with one meal. I was looking for a place
to sleep, a false id, and a friend who I could
trust (who wouldn't turn me in) and go to Calif-
ornia with, and a ride going there so I won't have
to hitch. Well, I went in the village in NYC, af-
raid that my ‘parents’ have already called the pigs
on me, so there I was, a runaway, Lesbian, 14 (I'm
15 now) no money, no friend I can trust, etc,

Well I went to a place called CONTACT and asked
if I can get a false id that would fool the pigs,
and a ride, but they didn't know shit, and then

***********************

A§OTHER FUGITIVE
About a week ago, the "mother'of a lesbian friend

’of ours pulled a gun on her. It was loaded. The

A'family'had told her they weren't gonna keep no
‘queers in THEIR house.

This friend of ours, Chris,
said she figured her "parents" just didn't like
havin this "problem" - so they figured they'd just

But that's always it. They can get rid of, or
punish anythin THEY don't like...but Chris sure
couldn't slam her "parents" cause she didn't like
havin a prick and a prick—lover shovin her around
all the time. A

Anyway, the "father" came in and took the gun
away.:.he could afford to, didn't want to be too
obvious you know. Neighbors and all. "mothers"?

h Well they don't have quite as much power as ”fathers'

Yeah, they can kill...but Daddy can take away money,‘

’ he can let you starve...he can get you to do anythin
/ he wants...so he does.

And all the while, bein

the big hero. Fathers don't NEED to kill outright

as much...cause they got other.way to get what they Want.

It's sg had what they do tojus. My friend and
me are tryin to work thru all those feelins of ‘re-
sponsibility" and obligation to 'parents'.' Why’
we always worry about how THEY feel...but it's never
so important how WE feel. And we began to realize
together - all of us - Chris, my friend and me, and
another lesbian...that worryin about how 'parents'
feel...and not ourselves...does a bunch of things.

First it lets us forget our own pain. That we
don't wanna face how we been hurt...cause then we
would get angry and them - and have to break from
the shit.- One of us said how we feel 'grateful'
to them for shit...and how that makes it hard to

_break away...and then we wondered what it is that

we're grateful to them in the first place. Who
gave them the right to "own" everythin so whenever
we got somethin it was them'givin' to us...didn't
they do that tolmake us dependent on them and
'grateful'...? Why don't young people, why doesn't
everyone have just as much right to shelter and
:food...cause some people get rich and big egos from
”ownin" everythin - includin other people._

And then this all came out even more. Chris
started to talk about what it was when her ”mother'
.pulled the gun on her...she said how she 'felt bad"
that her 'mother' couldn't deal with her bein a
lesbian...and then we all realized just how deep
that trainin is in all of us...that instead of
talkin about how it felt like to be lookin down
the barrel of a loaded gun, she started talkin
about how her 'mother' felt!!

But it's not just us who don't wanna face
the shit put on us by 'parents'. They don't
want us to either...cause if we do...they're
gonna be the targets of all the anger, humili-
ation, rage and degradation we lived thru with
them. .

And then gettin angry at ‘parents’ is danger-
ous too...like it was for Chris and the lesbian
who ranaway...if you start talkin or doin somethin

5B3ﬁt“ﬁ3w*tﬁ€y*E€ff6fi2e"ﬁs°-*bﬁeu*be8y"paisbnns....

and usetheir age privilege against us. ¢q¢ 4
w - ******************** EL———-—~

THINGS WE no THAT KEEP ALL .
THIS HAPPEN;u,,.

We get alot of letters, read alot of papers...
always sayin that "this prick was just so childish"
or, when a lesbian felt unsure of herself in a
certain way, she said she was\"imature" in that
way....Everythin gets put down on young people.

...Imature, childish, "Dont be a baby”...”when
are you goin to grow up?" "it's just a stage"...
"don't worry, she can't really think that way...
it's just so-and-so's influence on her". "You'll
get over it in a few years, I used to be that way,
but you'll be different - just you wait and see”..

Everytime someone says -"it was childish”, ask
what's so 'childish' about it...what is 'childish'?
Open? Honest? Direct? Emotional? What's 'childish'
about bein unsure? Is that somethin natural to
young people or is that somethin we've all been
hurt and tortured into...into bein unsure and weak,
and scared cause that's whats been done to us in,
this joint... .

And was that prick 'childish' or was he actin
like MN act, lots of male ego and power plays.
It's about time we stop puttin down everythin we
don't like as bein 'childish' or imature...

There's another thing we been thinkin about.

How people with age privilege have 'class'
privilege that young people don't have. Older
people can get jobs...have access to 'welfare'
...older people can get shelter...

older people learn to be devious.

people with class privilege are devious.
I used to say I hated screamin brats cause all
they'd do is cry "GIM GIMME GIME".

, GIVE ME. 7 ~

But,then I began to realize, that young people,
'not havin the ”class' of older people...only say
openly what their 'parents' do with such smoothness.
Cause thier 'parents' want a new car, a bigger‘; \
house, a more bossy job, longer'educations'....
and they don't have to say ”Gimme"...they just
buy it... I ~' .

It's like what we were talkin about in Spectre
2 and 3...how certain men have been called 'rapists'
by the women's liberation mevement...men who do
the direct - more open rapes....but that these we-
men still don't call their boyfriends rapists...
cause those men got class...they don't need to
physically force thier chick to fuck him...cause

'she's alt ready - well trained,by men's rape

trainin.... »
I don't know if I'm sayin this clear at all.

What I'm tryin to get at is that alot of shit

gets put down on young people - to break us - to
keep us tied down so we can be trained -

that some of the ageism that comes down serves

so as not to have to deal with the real issues...
like sayin that prick was actin “childish” so that
you don't have to face that he was bein a prick.
And that alot of the hatred comes too easy at young
people - causeethey don't got class...and cause.
they're easy to put down or hit..or murder...but
older people — well, recognizin the shit they do

(but don't have to be so 'obvious' about)..well,

that would mean recognizin some of the shit WE do,
cause most of us are real cool about hidin our
selfishness and stuff...and also cause gettin angry
at older people is more scarey...THEY HAVE POWER,

AND THEY CAN USE IT. gggﬁ, gn ?, 5‘. . . . ,-

For so long I never understood the age thing...
I always considered the ‘age’ comments Stasia's
problem because she got upset by it...cauz she
was younger.l would begin to get uncomfortable
when people would spend most of the time giving
me attention - but that was because I knew Stasia
would be gettin upset- I would even do shitty
things like not deal with ageist comments when
they were made - but rather warn the person that
Stasia would yell at them if she heard them say
that. .

I just didn't understand very much. It took
me a long time to see age chauvanism as MY
problem...And it was less blatant what came down
on me... more of an ego trip...I always assumed
people paid attention to me for GOOD reasons...
but after a long while it became clear that.
what was happening was disgusting...people,
listening BECAUSE I was OLDER ( and therefore
wiser or more experienced or some such garbage),
BECAUSE I had unfortunately gathered up some
of the credentials that are valued so highly in
this joint, BECAUSE I represented an authority
figure....when people are listening to things
you are saying it is difficult to see thru
to what may be the reasons for them listening
to you in the first place... And I had in-
bestments in things going along as usual -
cauz being an “older” person well -.I directly
benefited from the whole put-down of young
people. '

What garbage there is in all of us...when my

_mother read SPECTRE-l she got real upset and

started accusing me of being a fanatic...and
idealist...and she finally said that I was acting
like a I6 year old...and do you know what my ,

I'm 31 years old.;.and I'm not a child anymore.
I have done more and had more responsibility than
you ever had...and in fact I consider myself older.

than you.” \ /
It didn't even dawn on me to_call that shit V
about acting like a I6 year old...I-was so busy

wanting her off my back and wanting her to treat
me to the treatment I had finally ”earned”(so I
thought) by being an “Adult” - that all I could
do was shove in her face my age privilege...and
just say that I wasn't a child anymore and she
couldn't treat me as one. I never even dealt with
her treatment of me as a young person...that was
unquestioned.

More than indicating how ingrained these destruc-
tive age attitudes are in us - I think this experi-
ence brings out how anxious we are not to be
considered young people anymore...cauz what we
say-when we claim “adulthood” is that our parents
now, finally, HAVE to change their way of relating
to us - they have to treat us differently...

,But if everything were fine...if being a young

person in this joint weren't such a disaster -

well why would we do that? we do that because

as young people we have no rights...we are slaves..
owned and returned ( when we run away)...we are

not taken seriously, we are dismissed,manipulated,
and worst of all - we are taught to worry about
what we do to our parents...

So much is getting stirred up as we talk about
what happens to young people - the power that
parents have over “their” ”children”...because
we have all had to face our own lives and our own
family relationships.

Four of us were sitting around last night trying
to figure some stuff out and two of the women had
just split from their parents so there was a

'me From what she does'to me..fher‘torméntin§,

.am when I

frightening bunch of experiences that we had

to go through. We all had different sorts of re-
lationships with our parents...some of us hated
our fathers...some loved their fathers and hated
their mothers.... well what we finally realized
was - that as hard as it was to finally even admit
that you hated your parents...there was much more
“acceptability” to hatin your father. I mean
that's real...that power that males have is real...
and we all knew that if our fathers had been
different - things would have been different...
but we felt awful about hating our mothers...
That's so real to me. I still remember reading
Robin Morgan's dedication in SISTERHOOD IS POWER-
FUL - something like - to my mother - with love,
finally. I remember thinking I had a long way to
go to build “consciousness” - caus I have never
been able to §ay_the word “love” to my mother...
.write it at the end of letters - well it caused

a moment's pause...but that I could do. But I have
never felt love for my mother since I can
remember. So what do I feel? Guilty...because

\gI am not the daughter she wanted...guilty because»

I can't love her...guilty because I don't want
to go and visit her...guilty because she is “old
and not well and,is alone with an empty life”...
I feel GUILTY GUILTY GUILTY...(that's when I'm
not around her). '

But when I talk about what happened to me when
I lived with my ”parents”...well then my lipr
starts to curl and there is a certain look - a
certain tone in my voice and my hands just end
up being clenched...and so much of that hatred
focuses on my mother...and when I am with her

it is a constant battle for my survival...I_ W_%Wg
feel ¢he«5teek come down and lock me'in§‘fpyQf§¢M W

 

dominating,devouring,possessive total destruction*“
and hatred of all I value.“ Everything I value

in myself is hateful to her...and when I

am with her - well that comes back... yeah

I go to her place and in seconds I am 8 or 9

- the age doesn't matter - what matters is that

I am not a human being...I am “daughter”...

HER daughter... and I hate it - I hate what I

am around her...

But the women's movement has made us all super-
sensitive to the “oppression of women”...of, V
course things like the privileges of upperclass
women are never discussed...afterall they are wo-
men and oppressed... and when we talk about the
family - we talk about the poor mother...how hard
and self-denying her life is...it just hasn't been
faced that women oppress...women kill...women do
shity things...they may not do it as totally as
men do...but a lot of women wrap themselves up
in their power...and they use every ounce that
they have been “assigned” by their men...
women do shit to the young people they seem to
think they own... yeah it is the male privilege
to be indirect...to seem “nicer” than cr anky
pain in the ass”mother” - which is why a lot of
women like their fathers better... and I shouldn't
have liked my father better...what was wrong with
my reactions was that I didn't hate them both
equally... and I manage to feel quilty about that
one too...

This isn't an easy thing for me - cause I'm not
all-together on this at alI...I am still hung-up
on my mother...I send her money every month.;.why?
because once I said I would...because I have ex -
tra money - because she is my ”mother”...because

I feel so guilty...and that's a real fuck-up be-
cause there are better uses for that money...I

   

.mean my mother is a real pig...she is a real

~ but when my friend asks me about the money I send

I can barely talk about it... I worry about

_TwQMORE BRIEF THOUGHEi ABOUT DESTROYING
YOUNG PEOPLE

- We mentioned above somewhere that young people
are just usually more blatant than their parents...
.more straight-forward or upfront about stuff...
well, one day when we-were walking down the street
we saw some very young people wTth”theLT”P?rehf§"
and as we watched them for a while we realized

\

(42)

that one of the things it means to be young is
that you are honest in your reactions...and then
‘it hit.us why being young has to be treated as
something to “grow out of”...because this place
runs on Iies...on never telling the truth...

on being phoney...what would happen if everyone
started showing how they really felt...shit the
whole place would get messed up...women would
stop smiling graciously at everyone.. most
relationships would collaspe...just think how
many basic and “sacred” institutions in this joint
would just go to pieces ...that's why this joint

has to destroy young people and their reactions -
.We also were talkin about how lovin yourself

is a real crime around here. And why. One of
us read this sickenin article in a woman's paper
that was a interview with this big shit woman
(should say "lady") writer. A‘

She was asked how she felt about her 'love'
for this other woman she wrote abuut...well her
answer was that it was "immature" and narcissistic
(which means you love yourself and it's a put-
down). ‘ I I I

Well, I haven't stopped fumin about that one.
lMMATURE?? Of course, girls aren't worth anythin
and you'll learn when you grow up that MEN are
the best people, so if you love a woman now -
what she is(you still love yourself) you'll get
over it — it's just a immature stage, and grown-
ups - well MEN and WOMEN they both love MEN,
they both know MEN are the best people. And you'll
learn to hate yourself and other women and tear
each other apart just to get to a MAN.

Immaturé'and lovin yourself — shit they sure
do have to break that — lovin yourself is very

dangerous to men and male-world women...lovin " ' “

yourself is‘dangerousg;ofall‘privileged people,’
cause people who love themselves - hate it when °
other people try to hurt them...and they fight _ “
back.- " ' , . \_U
But if you can break everyone of bein at

ease, of likin themselves, then we begin to be
really unsure of ourselves - we don't like what

we are...we begin to hate ourselves - and then,

IT'S DONE...now that you've broken them -and

young people are put down from the day their L
born to know that whatever they say is rediculous,
immature (whatever that means) and no body will
listen anyway - so once young people and oppressed

. people learn to hate themselves ;you train them

very easily - to believe in everythin you feed them.
And you don't have to worry about resistance -
because what person who hates themself — who
doubts their value, would possibly fight for
themselves? ’ '1

Self-love is a weapon against enemies. And it
scares them. So they put it down. And they try
to break it. ’

Things have gotten alot harder here. Since the
beginnin we've been sendin Spectre out for a lot
less than we pay out to have it printed.
this was right since we had more money than alot
of 1esbians...we still think this is right. But
we've gone thru alot of shit too. My friend was
told that they won't hire her full-time anymore
and that she'll get 3/4 time next year and that
they might 'possibly' hire her for one year af-
ter that. We've put over $700 out of our pockets
into Spectre and we send money to some lesbian
collectives that we feel close to as well. We've
sold almost everythin that we could possibly sell
from our apartment (includin the record-player -
we're tryin to fix-up and old one) and we've had
alot of expenses...tools for auto mechanics school,
loans to pay off...and on and on.

We're still in really good shape right now.

We have heatin in the apartment. There are no
rats. We eat well. We're not in trouble. But
we been talkin about how Spectre won't be able
to live very much longer at all...once my friend
is fired for good, things will be harder.

But there are projects that are sittin still
right now cause us, zor our friends don't have
enough money. We need a microscope to learn about
common medical problems (one of us is in nursin
school) and our friends need money to get a press
(two of them are in printin school) so there will
be a lesbian press as more and more male-world
joints refuse to print things like Spectre...

And then Spectre is runnin up more bills...

We know that some of you who read Spectre have
.alot of money...and some of you have enough to
be able to share some...send some in - it's

"needed. v

- class stuff really tears at me. It does make

a difference about class background - it shapes
you a whole lot - in a lot of fucked up ways -
but the marks, traits,etc., are still there. It
hurts me because I've experienced a lot of two
classes and feel so schizoid about it and myself-
sometimes I want to forget the differences - make
believe they don't matter - and I can do that un-
til the rage builds and builds and builds and the
insecurities grab me so that I land up hating my-
self and both classes - I know it's really fucked
up - but it hurts so much that I know its real.
Lately everytime I've talked about class, I've
landed up crying and not know where I am.

Sometimes it means I hate all middle class

women - not only the ones who dig it - also

the ones who've turned away from it - I feel

that strongest because I feel on some level
they've had the security to choose to turn from
the fuck-ups of money - my hang-up is that I'm
not free - my insecurities about food and shelter
are really severe and way out of proportion to

my present life but I still FEEL them - every
fucking day -

What I also hate is the glamorizing of
the working class - forgetting that there are
real fuck-overs in the working class that produce
fucked-up people too ( the me I feel) - wanting.
security - wanting PHYSICAL security - sometimes
gettin obsessed by it. But glamorizing the work-
ing class is worse because it's dehumanizing peo-
ple to fit our own security needs. <*1j'

‘ one was hung u

We figured

-I remembered two of my dreams - in both of them
someone was being killed by a group of people -
S;dedown.| know what's hitting
me - I'm scare SHITLESS! I'm afraid of being
killed - I've known that fear for years and
thought I'd worked it through - but now I know
I haven't and that's what's paralyzing me -
vecause now I don't know who the enemy is - it's
not just men - SPECTRE 5 pointed to it too - our
“friends” or “sisters” or Vlesbians" - male agents
hiding everywhere - in me too?

One thing I know is that I'm not going
to fight for “working class“, “third world radi-
cals” or anyone who is oppressing me - I don't
give a fuck about them...it's me that was hung
upside down in that dream - and it's real because
if I walk outside holding hands with Dolores
I'm open to all the shit men can give and I know
they're out to kill me and what I am and they're
working class and third world and radicals -
they're supported by their “WOMEN” - fuck them
all. My body will be used to fight anyone-
inclusing right-on “radicals who insinuate in
any way whatsoever that I'm not valid and should
die for someone else - they can die - I WANT TO
LIVE - BASIC SURVIVAL IT'S CALLED AND S0 IS MY
HEALTHY PARANOIA ABOUT SO MANY PEOPLE. I'LL LEAVE
THEM ALONE , BUT IF THEY DON'T LEAVE ME BE, I'LL
FIGHT AND KILL THEM - IF THEY INTRUDE ON ONE INCH
OF THE SPACE I'VE MADE TO BE A LESBIAN AND TO BE
ME. They'll have to face one angry lesbian - and
that's what I am - FUCKING ANGRY! DYKE POWER IS
REAL AND EVERYDAY I FEEL IT MORE.

‘ - One thing I've noticed - I learned to write ;

I was in college and it was”al-
ways abstarct f ”sociologY, PhIl0$0POYa 3??-I '
and that still happens - I get Int0 It ---It 5
never really out of me...a middle-class fuck-up
but when I talk I a really concrete...so much so

pretty much when

,that I turn people off all the time...

- When that star started saying that ﬁnd we didn't
have enough Analysis in the paper - I kept think-
ing - are you blind lady? It's there...it's all
there...can't you see it and touch it and

feel it - or have you numbed out?...anyone who

has experienced things has conclusions...they're
there...it's just a matter of acting on them...
can't you see them? or do you want them spelled
out so they can be put in a book and taught to S
the “masses” - who “wouldn't understand otherwise-
BULLSHIT - what a fucking class trip that is...

go into the bars and teach old gay dykes where
it's at...BULLSHIT,BULLSHIT!!! ORGANIZE...Organize
who?...the ignorant? Isn't that implied? Where
does the power trip end in that one? Right-on
lesbians with ”political”analyses ...and they
don't lay down power trips?BULLSHIT!!!I Believe

in support - tyring to fighure out different
tactics women can choose from to fight back...w e
can get strength and share knowledge from each
other - and fight together from lots of

different angles - but I don't want any fucked-
up shit head telling me what I feel or should

do when they don't even know me, laugh with me,
or share themselves with me - NO WAY!

- since I last wrote I've been thinking how class
background has really made a difference in my life
and have talked a whole lot about it with some
friends. It's wierd - because the heaviest things
were what I blocked for the longest time - like
death - people, friends - dying all the time -
usually in gang wars and with drugs - always afraid
of‘ b'ei°ng iéi'i'I'ed' b'e*c‘a‘us‘e‘ o ‘ -'c‘r‘a‘zy'-' r"ea‘s"6If5‘ i'i'il’é’

'you just end up a lesbian - cauz “THEY DO THINGS

belonging to a certain gang or being so and so's

ifriend. It was really insane!...but it's just

another version of what everyone is still doin...

only now it's a little more indirect... some-

how - I could deal with different people threat-

ening me with death ( I mean people have threaten-

’ed to shoot me several times and I have had a gun

pointed right between my eyes) - I got through

all that - but this psychological shit that we

do to each other is a lot harder for me to deal
with because I can't see what it is or where it's
coming from - it's so damn well hidden and ‘sophis-

I-ticated'...when I was young I came in contact

with death - a lot of physical death - and was
afraid of it - but now I'm really afraid of
psychological death - it's slower and much

harder to fight. But death and physical

beatings still just absolutely flip me out.

I can't even sit and watch a movie that's bloody.
People say to me - “don't worry, it's only make-
believe” and I say Bullshit!...it's real - I

KNOW it is - and I feel every second of it. wierd
isn't it?

- Another class difference was that I got in-
volved sexually with men really young (I2 years
old) and was pregnant at IA. I say it was a class
thing because it wasn't the exception - it was

the usual. But it helped a lot because it was e
easier in a way to say no to men later on because
sex wasn't this great exciting trip - this big
romantic mystery...with men it was shit and I
learned that really early - and so I stayed away V.
from men most of my life after that - until I

' got into the “LEFT” and got really fucked over.

For a while I forgot what I learned on the streets.
THAT'S WHAT COLLEGE DID FOR ME - IT MADE ME FORGET
CAUZ THEY WANT TO MAKE YOU THINK THAT “COLLEGE”
MEN ARE DIFFERENT...BUT THEY AREN'T...IT JUST
SEEMS DIFFERENT DECAUSE IT IS SO PHONEY...
so COVERED WITH “CLASS” SMOOTHNESS...INDIRECTNESS.
IT REALLY IS A MIND-RAPE!

Belng 93Y also had it's own special twist in
the neighborhood. Women who went to the Youth
House would be “raped” and come out lesbians -

, so the stories would fly...those stories were

filled with dyke stereotypes and horror tales -

so a lot of those fears had to be dealt with be-
fore I could come out - fears that I learned at I2.
But that's just it - they do it all the time -
the same thing...only with a different front...
they make it out like women “rape” women...

but bullshit - they don't call what happens on
the street “rape” - that's “the way it goes”...
”doin what comes natural...” Even look what

I wrote...”I got sexually involved with men
re3llY YOung”...shit I got raped really young..
we save that word - “rape” for very special
situations...but it's the usual...

And we all get uptight about certain things...
me - well I had to work thru those stories... .
if you get sent to the youth house ' well then 
TO YOU”...another friend didn't want to tell 8
People she was “raped” - because then they would
say - "oh well, now I can at least 'understand'
why you became a lesbian...but go to a shrink -
they can fix you up”. why is it so hard for us
_to just say that mgﬂ_disgust us??? why don't all
those other women worry about being heterosexual?

I just feel so clean - so strong - so damn
'“?a;;i;gyt°6aina d°l3sBTan.T5Fﬁéfé'§“ﬁbtniﬁ“tnaL
can make me forget what I know about that...

nothin!

’Indians...

‘IT-I57’ i;é_tL6..P»téF Y00 FOIZC>6T.llI

Do you know that the plugs in our homes that

‘we use to plug in a lamp or a toaster is called

a "female" socket (cause it got holes you stick
somethin into) and that the plug at the end of

the lamp cord that you put into the "female"
socket is called a "male" socket (cause it sticks
its prongs into the hole). Like everythin in this
society - we're always bein reminded of what our
place and value is - what we're worth to men...
and what men treasure so much - their bloody
pricks. . _

Also, in electronics they use colors to tell
different values...you guessed it already. Of
course Black is no Value at all - 0 - nothing.;.
and white - of course, the highest value - 9.
Brown gets 1, red 2 and yellow 3. They just can't
afford to let anyone forget where they stand if
they are Chicanas, or Asians, or Blacks, or

And what about sayin you were that Black sheep
of the family - or bein ‘blacklisted’ or ‘black-
balled' and devil's food cake is brown of course
and angel's food is white. And whoever wants to

be an angel better get out of the way anyway.

Dear Spectre,

I just picked up Spectre 5 last nite as something
to take my mind off my troubles,well I didn't put
it down until I had read it completely front to
back. . m
‘ Two nites ago the black man I was living with,
beat me and held me prisoner in my own room from‘-
6 to llpm. I couldn't see straight and I could
barely walk. I finally got away by whimpering like
a child and begging to go to the bathroom -
being totally submissive to his all powerful
male prick image. This was my punishment for tell-
ing him I wasn't going to live with him anymore -
that I wasn't gonna take his temper tantrums when
he'd throw and break everything within his reach-
that I wasn't gonna devote all of my time and
energy to Hi§_life. It's absurd and - like you say
- funny , when I think of how it all started yester-
day. I went to the hospital with him for a sprained
ankle. The nurse said it would take one and a half
hours- so I went to visit a close woman friend who
had been in the hospital for a real long time and
who I had been wanting to see. well, when I got back
to the Emergency Room, Freddie had left, and when
I got back home, he was just huffing around, not
talking to me. He threw a tantrum breaking the
brrom handle over the kitchen table because he
couldn't find his coat. I told him how I had
finally gotten in to see my friend (Ia hospital
mistake as it turned out) and how we were so glad
to see each other - how important to me it was.

He said that even if his father were dying next
door, he wouldn't leave ME_in the hospital alone.
WITH A SPRAINED ANKLE, ?ALONE ? And this from a
black revoltuionary who writes poetry about the
importance of the women's movement???

I went up to the room, he followed. We both sat’
silent. He asked me if I had anything to say. I
shook my head no. He said,”Well, I guess I'll
sleep downstairs tonite.” I said, ” Why don't
just take all your stuff with you.” That's when

h SEBFFBO DeaLIHq ms’ "3 ' _
hzurs he'd slap me down to the floor, llft me ”9’

. S ' t
then beg forgiveness. I'd say ” Get Out, We '3 ”°

living together anymore.” - then he'd slap me
down again. This would repeat over and over .
like the most basic, simplest and most honest
example of the male/female heterosexual type rela-
tionship - the woman “loves” through complete sub-
mission to the power of the male- the penis.

I know now that everytime we “made love” it was
really only rape; everytime it hurt I would try
and think that ” Wow! He's really giving me so
much energy” when it was just rape - kill from his
part and sado-masochistic self-destructive submis-
sion on my part. '

I've got a swollen face and I still can't sleep

It's

,- my Head aches and I lie awake in terror, think-

ing, knowing that he wants to get me good - put

me in the hospital. I'm staying someplace else -
looking for a place to live - yeah, it turns out
that I'm the one who ‘got out‘. When I went back
to pick up some things, a woman friend who knows
what has been happening said that she didn't think
it was fair - he was the one who should have moved
out. “Yeah”, I said,” I know I've been fucked over
from the start- BUT IT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN AGAIN .
I'll learn karate, struggle to make myself strong
and be able to stand up against any'prick who shows

’ his penis-male-ego with his fists. She was gonna

walk with me, help me find a place to live, but
the man she is living with wanted her to stay
at home- mind her own business, stay with HIM,

and SHE didn't want to piss HIM off. Yeah...
Yeah, well I KNOW I'VE BEEN A MALE-WORLD‘

I've abandoned the white male

black struggle by submitting myself to a black

male “revolutionary”. NOW IT'S MY OWN STRUGGLE I

It‘ my struggle to make myself strong, to become

a proud dyke who never sucks the cock of the male-

world again. ~ ' r
Goddamn right I'M BITTER - all of you Freudian

psychologists, GODDAMN RIGHT! This letter hasn't

even begun to touch the depth of my bitterness.

I haven't even bothered to go into the details of

this absurd drama. Yeah, it's almost funny when

you try to get it down on paper - I've been a fool
for letting myself take this kind of shit for 20
years. /

I REALLY HOPE MY BITTERNESS AND HATRED LAST THE
REST OF MY LIFE. I HOPE I NEVER FORGET THIS - CAUZ
I NEVER wANT TO BE TEMPTED BY THE PRIVILEGES THAT
THE MALE-WORLD DANGLES IN FRONT OF THE MALE-wORLD-
w0MEN-SLAVES. .

STRUGGLING To BE FREE, I HOPE SOME DAY WE UNITE
IN OUR STRENGTH TO RIP OUT THE BOWELS OF THE PIGS

THAT HAVE ENSLAVED US FOR SO LONG. WITH LOVE IN
STRENGTH, AND WITH MORE COURAGE,BECAUSE ALL YOU

LESBIANS WHO HAVE WRITTEN ABOUT YOUR STRUGGLES
HAVE GIVEN ME THE STRENGTH TO BEGIN TO MAKE SOME
CHANGES IN MY OWN LIFE. ‘

Lately more and more women's papers have begun
to talk about rape - like Woman's World (Box 694
Stuyvescent Station NY,NY 10009) who did some
stories about females gettin raped...there are _
some stories about females bein together enough.(:
.to kick the shit out of the rapist...but then C[)
the rapist goes free! is even seen as the vic-
%aU1t.
~ or manslaughter.

' wives) and

bthe street rapes moreless the 'home' rapes.

Ilenge men's power at all.
‘all the easier.

We've all had experiences with blatant rape
attacks - so it's never surprisin - what kills us
tho is that a female who defends herself against
a rapistaﬂan attacker is thrown in jail.

Still tho rape is thought of as some strange
man jumpin you on the street at night - woman's
liberation still doesn't see husbands or lovers
as rapists. Like this one woman. Her husband V
would beat her alot. Once she went away with the
child (one of the most common runaways are runaway
her husband went after her in the car.
He drove up onto the sidewalk and tried to mow her

down. Then he.got out and started pullin her hair
and beatin her again. The police came. The hus-
band was drunk. The police did nothin. Not even’

a damn ticket for drunk drivin moreless assault
and attempted murder. They let him take her home.
See the husband did this alot. So why bother.

'If they put him in jail he'd probably come out and

really murder his wife. So there she was. She
couldn't leave - she couldn't get rid of him.
The men conspire together - they are all rapists.

‘And her husband rapes her whenever he 'gets the urge".

And then it began to hit us - why abortion is
the big issue of the great women's liberation move-
ment in this kountry...and not rape...not even
Shit
abortion even gets male support.’ It doesn't chal- I
In fact it makes things
Yeah we believe abortion is impor-
tant - but why the hell hasn't woman's liberation

nade such a big deal about rape - cause that does
. threaten men? '7‘

What about castration (includin cuttin the nerves

.that erect their pricks) for all men who commit ‘sex’

crimes. W _ ._
Shit, as I wrote that I realized what a joke -
it's women who end up in jail for DEFENDIN them-

selves...and like this 15 year old lesbian told us,

when reel young females are raped - the FEMALES
are put away in detention homes for "invitin it"...
And oh do I believe that cause after this

_guy raped me at'gun-point and the police took me

in,bloody and terrified - they kept suggestin
maybe I really wanted it and how good a fuck was
he?

Anotﬁer IIIIIEI‘ -”‘

Is it possible to be condemned for life?...to
be miserable and unhappy? If so, what can I do
to get out of this painful and mental pain I'm
in? All I want is just for someone to care for
me with their love and affection and I'll
give them mine in return. Is this really asking
for too much? Society condemns me for being a
perverted,sick attacker of women. well, I never
attacked a woman in my life. Of course, I guess
if‘I was a man and went out and attacked women
I would be considered normal. But I'm not a male
THANK GOD!But yet I do love women - but only
gay women. I've lost all respect, interest in
men completely. All they are good for is to fuck
you - mentally and physically, Well- fucking
I don't need. I need the tender loving care of
a woman. All this inhuman garbage about lesbians

, isn't true...I've NEVER SEEN A LESBIAN ATTACK

ANYONE ON THE STREETS OR IN THE ALLEYS OR ANY
OTHER DAMN PLACEIIF PEOPLE ARE REALLY UPSET WHY
‘THE HELL DON'T THEY HATE THE PEOPLE WHO REALLY
DO ALL THAT STUFF ' WHY DON'T THEY GO AFTER MEN?
JUST THINK OF ALL THE RAPES OF VERY YOUNG

PEOPLE AND ALSO ALL IHE LKUEL WHY) WE“ Ink"'

WOMEN.
