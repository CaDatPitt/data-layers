INDIANAPOLIS, Ind.—The National Lead Company’s secondary smelter here,'closed down for

  
 
 

 a week last spring on orders from the Indiana State Health Department, is s,h;.1t down again for the

tests on the blood of 44 workers on March 15 showed that 28, or almost 65 percent, had blood lead

ities.

Q J. F. Keppler, director of the Division of Industrial Hygiene of the Indiana Board of Health, in

Unions to Testify May 5;
Seek Rapid House Action

WASHINGTON, D.C.—Hearings on proposed federal
mine safety legislation are scheduled for the week of
May 3 before the House Select Labor Subcommittee, fol-
lowing. rapid developments in this area on Capitol hill
during the past month. Three bills on the subject that
have been introduced in the House will be under con-
sideration, with the subcommittee expected ‘to combine
various features into a single legislative proposal.

On March 31, the long-awaited administration bill on
mine safety was introduced by Reps. James G. O’Hara
(D-Mich.), who will serve as chairman during the hear-
ings, and Raymond F. Clevenger (D-Mich.). The pro-
posal, drafted by the Department of the Interior, finally
cleared the Bureau of the Budget and other administra-
tive government agencies. It has not yet, however, been
thrown into the Senate hopper. ”

Major differences between the administration bill
and the Mine-Mill-backed Metcalf-Montoya proposal are
that the former would not cover smelters and refineries

Hearings on I 4(b) Repeal
Set to Open on May IO

 

WASHINGTON, D.C.——Congressman Frank Thomp- -

son, Jr. (D-N.J.), sponsor of HR 77 which would repeal
Section 14(b) of the Taft-Hartley Act, will serve as
chairman of a House Select -Subcommittee on Labor
which will open hearings on the bill May 10.

Repeal of 14(b), which°a1lows states to enact so-_

called “right-to-work” laws, is the number onegoal of
the labor movement in this session of Congress.
Planning to testify on behalf of Mine-Mill in support
of repeal is International President A. C. Skinner, who
will point out that, unlike many industrial unions whose
membership is concentrated in
heavily industrial states, Mine-
Mill has close to 40 percent of

ly in the Southwest. The union,
therefore, is intimately ac-
quainted with the I depressed
economic situations of states

done by restricting the exercise
of free collective bargaining.

A similar bill, S: 256, has been

Repealed in Indiana

“Right-to-work” already this
year has been having some
tough sledding. Indiana repealed
its law in January by a 38 to 12
vote of the Senate and 74 to 21
vote in the House. An attempt
to get the legislature in New
Mexico to put the “right-to-
wor ” question on the ballot was
defeated. The Wyoming Supreme
Court recently ruled unconstitu-
tional a section of the state's so-
called “RTW” law prohibiting
non-discriminatory exclusive job
referral systems, which are fre-
quently part of agreements be-
tween building trades unions and
contractors.

But 19 states continue to have -
laws which r e g u 1 a t e against '

passage of Thompson’s and Mc-

RICHARD CAMPOS, a safety committeeman for Local 938
in Superior, Ariz., has turned his hobby of rock collecting
into Qt business. He is now selling gems and rocks from
all parts of the US, as well as celestite, sulfur, and arago—
mite from Mexico. His collection of barite has achieved
so much fame that the American Museum of Natural Arts
has offered to buy it. Calcite crystals, hemitite, and iron
pyrite crystals are among the 79 different minerals that
Campos has gathered in Superior alone.

TIME OUT FOR HOCKEY . The Local 598 Onaping
Falcons prepare to journey to Oakville where they trounced
a squad from United Auto Workers Local 707, 12’ to 3. The
Ford plant workers developed plenty of engine trouble
midway through the game. The two teams were slated for
a return engagement in Sudbury, Ontario. This year's big
contest in Sudbury, however, will be between, Mine-Mill
Local 598 and the United Steelworkers—an NLRB election
to determine bargaining rights at the lnco properties there.

Having recovered from a
lengthy illness, Bounds was re-
fused work by AABC, whose
doctor said he could no longer
hold down a fulltime job. At
the same time, his claim for
unemployment benefits was op-
posed by the company, and the
local unemployment office dis-
qualified him on two grounds:
“Incapability for employment”
and “voluntary leaving of em-
ployment without good cause.”

The local union challenged
Bounds’ disqualifications, pre-
senting testimony at a hearing
that indicated that Bounds was
able to work, in the opinion of
other physicians. Local 593 Pres.
ident Pat Pacile and Robert
Brown, chairman of the union’s
bargaining committee, testified
in the case, which was handled *
for the union by International
Representative Joseph Scioli.

Referee Maurin overruled the
disqualifications against Bounds,
and he was accepted back on
his job with all the rights that
go with his 20 years. of seniority. '

r and would provide only limited

enforcement powers to correct

specific types of safety code

violations.

Mine-Mill and the several
other labor unions with a stake
in mine safety legislation will
push for broad enforcement
powers and broad coverage
when they testify on May 5.

Unions Concerned

Unions planning either to send
representatives to testify or to
submit written statements on
behalf of such legislation in-
clude, besides Mine-Mill, the
United Mine Workers of Ameri-
ca, the United Steelworkers of
America, the Oil, Chemical, and
Atomic Workers Union, the In-
ternational Chemical Workers
Union, the Operating Engineers-,
the International Brotherhood of
Electrical Workers, UMWA Dis-
trict 50, and the International
Brotherhood of Teamsters. A
representative of the national

AFL-CIO also is expected to ap-

pear before the subcommittee.

Labor is in agreement that the _

administration bill needs beefing
up to be acceptable, particularly
by extending its coverage to
smelters and refineries and by

- greatly broadening the enforce-

ment powers to ensure compli-
ance. The unions are also ex-

pected to ask that the final bill .

include a provision requiring a
minimum of annual inspec-
tions rather than leaving their
frequency to the discretion of
the administrative agency.

A third bill, one patterned
after the old Murray bill, was
introduced earlier in the session
by O’Hara——but apparently only
to help speed up proceedings on
mine safety. Making no pro-
vision whatsoever for enforce-
ment powers, the bill will not be
seriously considered by the sub-
committee.

The position of Mine-Mill and
the other labor unions involved
is that, under whatever number
the bill is reported out, it should
contain the strongest possible
provisions for dealing with
safety problems.

Schedule for Hearings

On Monday, May 3, the sub-
committee will hear testimony

~ from the Department of the In-

terior, with the Department of
Labor and the Department of
Health, Education, and Welfare
slated to testify on behalf of

federal mine safety legislation
the following day.

Following labor’s presentation
on Wednesday, the mining com-
pany representatives will ap-
pear on May 6. State mine in-
spectors will testify on the last
day of the hearings —- Friday,
May 7.

Congressmen also will have
an opportunity to appear before
the subcommittee on May 4,
and several strong supporters of
mine safety legislation are ex-
pected to do so.

If the Select Labor Subcom-
mittee approves a bill, it will go
to the full House Education and
Labor Committee, chaired by
Rep. Adam Clayton Powell (D-
N.Y.). Any measure approved
by a standing committee of the
House then goes to the Rules
Committee before it can come
out for a vote on the floor. As
the result of a rules change at
the beginning of this session, the
Speaker of the House now has
the power to bring a bill out
after 21 days in Rules -- pre-
viously the graveyard of many
legislative proposals. L a b o r ,
however, seeking rapid action
on mine safety, hopes to con-
vince ‘Rules Chairman Howard
Smith to quickly pilot any such

legislature through his com‘-

mittee.
The possibility of further
field hearings on mine safety is

being strenuously opposed by

Mine-Mill and other labor or-
ganizations, which feel that the
urgent need for such legislation
has already been well docu-
mented. Congressional action
this year is the unanimous goal
of the labor groups involved.
The timetable in the Senate is
indefinite. Although Senators
Metcalf, Montoya, and Moss in-
troduced their bill fairly early
in the session, hearings un-
doubtedly will not be scheduled
until the administration pro-
posal is introduced. It could
well be, however, particularly

if speedy House action on mine-

safety looks probable, that any
Senate consideration of the sub-
ject might be postponed until
the lower chamber has acted.

Terrill Assigned

In any event, Mine-Mill has
assigned International Repre-
sentative Leo Terrill to Wash-
ington for the duration of the
mine safety campaign. Having
arrived in this capital city in
the middle of April, he will con-

Stuart.

Stuart, at the direction of the
international officers, spent a
week in Washington during the
middle of April, meeting with
representatives of other unions
to help work out a unified labor
approach to the proposed legis-
lation. Without exception, the
labor organizations concerned
will push for the strongest,
broadest possible bill. The union
research director also met with
Interior Department officials,
Rep. O’Hara, and Dr. Robert
Knight, a University of Mary-
land economics professor, who
will serve as the staff director
for the Select Labor Committee.

Boyaiian to Appear

Handling the presentation , of
the Interior Department at the
hearings willtbe Paul Boyajian
of Phoenix, Ariz., who supervised
the department’s two-year study
of safety conditions in metal
and mineral mines and mills.
Interior Secretary Stewart Udall
also will testify on behalf of
federal legislationin this area.

Authorized by Congressional
passage of the Mine Safety
Study Act of 1961, after years of
lobbying by Mine-Mill, the

study produced a report labeling.

as “clearly inadequate” state
mine safety laws and enforce-
ment. “It would be difficult to
ignore the need for positive ac-
tion,” concluded the Interior
Department report, putting the
government for the first time
on record in favor of federal
metal mine safety legislation. It
was submitted to Congress in
November, 1963.

‘In the course of the federal
survey of 800 mines from Dec.

4, 1961 to Sept. 26, 1963, it was-

found that only 544 of them were
subject to any specific provision
of a state safety law or code.
But in those mines, 4,080 vio-
lations of state laws were ob-
served.

During the period of study,
343 men were killed while at
work in metal and non-metallic
mines and mills, quarries, sand
and gravel pits. For 1962 alone,
10,189 work injuries resulted in
212 deaths and more than 7,000
man-years of time lost from
work.

Federal inspectors found a
total of 12,155 hazards to life
and limb during their original
checks of the 800 mines. At 714
mines which were later rein-
spected, only 4,503 of these
hazards had been eliminated al-
though the inspectors had urged
in writing the correction of
10,858.hazards at these mines.

In addition to the wealth of
material indicating the need for
federal legislation that is con-
tained in the Interior Depart-
ment report, testimony from
Mine-Mill, other labor groups,

and Congressional supporters of ,

a strong federal law will further

document that case by providing.

up-to-date information on ac-
cidents and safety violations
during the past year and a half.

THE MINE-MILL UNION

 M-M Council and Kennecott
Meet on Safety Improvement

SALT LAKE CITY, Utah—Twenty specific suggestions on improving safety procedures. were
presented by the Mine-Mill Kennecott Council at a top level meeting with management on April
12 and 13. The company agreed that implementation of the proposals would be worked out in
‘meetings between local union safety committees and Kennecott committees in each division.

Final drafting of the safety proposals was the major business of a Kennecott Council meeting
on April 11—a -meeting at which Utah Governor Calvin Rampton appeared to thank the union for
its support during his successful campaign last fall.

David Bennett, president of Local 392 in Magna, reported to the council on the progress of
the job- re-evaluation program now underway at the Kennecott properties and the delegates dis-
cussed’ experiences under the security-severance and sick leave plans negotiated’ in 1964. Final

details on the no-layoffs-due-to-
automation clause are still being
worked out between company
and union, and delegates heard
areport on pro-gress in that re-
gard.

Present at the safety meeting
with the company, in addition to
the council and local union dele-
gates, were A.— C. Skinner, inter-
national president; Board Mem-
-ber» Verne Curtis; G. L. (Penny)

-Buckner, international r e p r e- . .

Bureau of Mines
- Investigations

While it was agreed that most
of the union‘ suggestions would
be worked out at the local level,
Kennecott. said it would handle
on a companywide basis Mine-
Mil1’s request that the Health
and Safety Branch of the U.S.
Bureau of Mines be asked to in-
vestigate all fatal or near fatal_
accidents, to investigate special
problems such’ as dust control in
open pits, mills, and smelters,
open pit bank control, and other
special problems, and to make
general health and safety sur-
veys once each year at all
mines, mills, and smelters rep-
resented by the union.

Rampton, who appeared un-
expectedly at the Kennecott
Council meeting, described what
he‘ felt to be legislative gains
during the past session and
pointed to some of the problems

in the legislature, where the -
Democrats have slim control in

both houses. He said that he
would be appointing in the near
future a state mine inspector
and an interim committee to
study and recommend changes
in the Utah Industrial Compen-
sation Act and the state’s Labor
Code. The recommendations of
the committee, to be set up after
July 1, will be presented to the
Governor for his direction to

the special session of the legis-

lature that Rampton has ‘called
for early in 1966.

cil and safety meetings were

  Congressional Pace Quickens;
Action on Medicare, Education

WASHINGTON, D. C.—Senate and House Judiciary Committees wrapped up their hearings on
voting rights legislation early in April, as two other bills on the subject were introduced—both by
Republicans. Rep. John V. Lindsay of New York tossed in a proposal which would eliminate-poll taxes
for any election, and Rep. William M. McCulloch of Ohio introduced a bill supported by House
Minority Leader Gerald Ford of Michigan.

Originally aimed primarily at six Southern states, the Johnson administration bill was consider-
ably strengthened in the House committee. Designed to eliminate literacy tests or other means of
discrimination in states where less than 50 percent of the persons of voting age are registered or
voting, the bill was amended so that it could also attack other pockets of discrimination through-

out the country. ‘

The administration, however, seems to favor first pushing ‘the bill in the Senate, where Minor-
ity Leader Everett Dirksen of Illinois exercises close to veto

of the existence of the filibuster
rule. And Dirksen is a strong
supporter of an “escape clause,”
through which many states and
communities could avoid federal

intervention in the conduction of .

elections.
Although at the beginning of

April, only two major pieces of

legislation had been passed by
both houses of the 89th Congress

 Workers Elect M-M

CHARLESTON, SQC. — Mine-Mill Local, 863, the
Charleston Fertilizer and Chemical Workers, for years
the bargaining agent for six different properties in this
area, boosted its negotiating strength by picking up a
seventh property in an NLRB election on April 9.

The vote by Etiwan Fertilizer Company workers was
80 for Mine-Mill, 21 for no union.’ Two‘ ballots were
spoiled and one was challenged. ,

Representation of this property by the local union
is particularly important since the company controls the
ship terminal in Charleston, handling all chemicals com-

, ‘ing into the port. Local 863 also represents the employees

4 at American Agricultural Chemi-
cal, Planters Fertilizer and

ginia-Carolina Chemical, and
Davison Chemical.

,',At a- March 18 hearing, the

miss the _Mine-Mill petition for
-an election, but was overruled by
the Labor Board. R. N. Wagner
from the local union and Jesse
G. Doster, international repre-
sentative, appeared at the hear-
ing for Mine-Mill. '

House Medicare Vote

Of major importance was the
313 to 115 passage in the House
of Representatives of a version
of the administration’s medicare
bill on April 8. Rep. John Din-
gell, a son of one of the pio-
neers in the fight for national
health insurance, presided over
much of the debate on the
measure.

The bill includes a basic com-
pulsory program to cover hos-
pital and related costs for those
persons. over 65, to be financed
by an increase in Social Security
payments, and a supplementary
voluntary program to cover doc-
tor bills, diagnostic tests, some
drugs, to be financed by a
monthly payment of $3 by par-
ticipants and "matched by the
government.

Medicare also would expand
the medical assistance provided
under the Kerr-Mills Act and no
longer bar an indigent older per-
son from participation in the
program because of the income
of. his relatives.

The bill also provides a 7 per-
cent increase in Social Security
retirement benefits, retroactive
to Jan. 1 of this year.

The Senate, which passed the

  
  
  
   
  
  
  
   
  
 
   
  
  
  
   
 
   
    
 
  
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
      
 
 
 
 

medicare bill less than a year
ago, probably will not vote on
the measure for a few weeks.
The American Medical Associa-
tion may get in a’ few more last-
minute blasts at the bill at Sen-
ate Finance Committee hear-
ings. Chances are good, how-
ever, that the AMA will con-
centrate on making certain that
the legislation will not include
any provisions dealing with qual-
ity control of medical care or
standards to control the upward
spiraling of doctors’ fees. The
expensive campaign of the AMA
for its “eldercare” bill is cred-
ited to a large degree in per-
suading the House to add the
optional medical care feature to
the original King-Anderson bill.

Aid To Education

Approved by the House on
March 25, with Senate concur-
rence following on April 9, was
President J ohnson’s bill for fed-
eral aid to elementary and sec-
ondary schools. Its first year
cost estimated at $1.3vbillibn,
the measure is designed partic-
ularly to provide assistance to
school districts with large num-

bers of children from low-in-‘

come. families. Efforts inthe
past several years to help the
lower levels of the country’s
educational system foundered on
the sticky question of church-
state separation.- This year’s
bill provides indirect benefits to
parochial school students.

More than 90 percent of the
school districts throughout the
country will receive the federal
grants. ‘

Also included in the measure
are funds for books and library
materials, a program to estab_-
lish community-wide supplemen-
tary education centers and ser-
vices, and an authorization for
improving educational research.

On April 26 the President
signed legislation extending for
four years and liberalizing the
manpower retraining program,

’ begunin 1962. The program pro-

vides training allowances so that
unemployed persons and those
without skills can attend voca-
tional schools or get on-the-job
training.

Dies in Bank Fall

INSPIRATION, Ariz. —- Frank
Ramirez, 52, a member of Mine-
Mill Local 586 in Miami, was
killed on April 9 when the 45-
ton haulage truck he was driv-

ing plunged over a 20-foot bank_

in the Inspiration Consolidated
Copper Company’s Live Oak pit.

There were no witnesses to
the accident, which occurred
about 5 p.m. Ramirez was
thrown through the windshield
when the truck apparently hit
on its front bumper halfway
down the bank, and then rolled
end over end.

Investigation of the fatal acci-
dent by Julian Kennedy, mining

health and safety engineer for

the U. S. Bureau of Mines,
could not establish a cause.
Kennedy’s report, however, of-
fered two tentative recommen-
dations:
0 Drivers of heavy equipment
should be given yearly
physical examinations. The

report raises the possibility '

of Ramirez having suffered
a heart attack or stroke.
Because his chest was
crushed in the fall, it is
doubtful that such a possi-
bility could be proved by
autopsy.

O Consideration should be
given to the use of seat
belts.

When inspected in the shop
three days later, the steering
and braking mechanisms on the
truck seemed to be functioning
properly. ,

Ramirez is survived by his
wife and one child.

MORENCI, Ariz.—One man was killed and four others injured on April 12 in an ‘explosion at the
Phelps Dodge precipitate plant here—-a new addition to the company’s reduction plant, just going

into operation that ‘morning.

Ramon Castillo, 43, a member of Mine-Mill Local 616, died at the Morenci Hospital of massive
pulmonary hemorrhaging at 11:30 a.m., about 75 minutes after the accident occurred. Married and’
the father of three children, he was a helper at the precipitate plant. He had worked at the smelter" 
since 1947, and was due to receive an 18-year award for having no lost-time accidents this July.

The blast, according to a U.S. Bureau of Mines report by L. G. Anderson, mining health and
safety engineer, was caused by inserting a lighted torch into a furnace compartment filled with any":

explosive mixture of natural gas
and air.

Noting that the atmosphere in
the compartment was not first
properly purged or tested, the
report states that an indirect

cause of the explosion “could

be the lack of proper instruc-
tion” to the men charged with
re-lighting the furnace. Gas test-
ing equipment was not used, it
says.

Facial Burns

Injured in the accident were
Pat Esquivel, 50, also a mem-
ber of Local 616; C. B. Murdock,
42, a-plant foreman; Paul Ma-
jor, 56, a boilermaker; and.Ray
Stephens, 37, a technical em-
ployee. Stephens and Major re-
ceived only minor injuries, but
Esquivel and Murdock were hos-
pitalized for five days with
burns on the face and arms and
multiple body bruises.

Esquivel, a‘ precipitate, plant
operator, has worked for the
company for 18 years.

The men apparently were us-
ing an auxiliary burner to dry
out the brick in the furnace.
Having lit the burner about 9
a.m., they went about other
work, returning at 10 to find that
the ﬂame was out. They turned

off the natural gas, leaving the A

air pipe open. But, on attempt-
ing to re-light the burner at

- about 10:15, the explosion oc-

curred.

Recommendations

The Bureau of Mines’ report
contained several recommenda-
tions. It said that the atmos-

phere should be properly purged

before an igniting device is
used; that tests should be made

by qualified persons, using ap-

proved gas detectors; and that
men charged with lighting burn-

-ers should be properly instruct-

ed.

The Arizona State Industrial

. Commission also investigated

the explosion. While its report
has not yet been received, Local
616, Financial Secretary Frank
Morales said thatlthe commis-
sion is expected _to recommend
the use of safety devices ,.which
would automatically shut off the
flow of gaswhenever the flame
of a burner goes out.

The local union advised both
the commission and the Bureau _ .
of Mines of the explosion, anda
discussed the accident with thee 
investigators. .- A

‘ Speakers atlLWU Convention
 Sen..Grueni ng,  kinner

VANCOUVER, B.C. —— Some 350 delegates to the 16th biennial convention of
the International Longshoremen’s and Warehousemen’s Union at the Bayshore Inn
approved resolutions last month calling for a boycott on the handling of merchandise
from Alabama, free trade with all nations of the world, an extension of the nuclear
test ban to underground testing, nuclear disarmament around the globe, support for
the free speech movement at the University of California at Berkeley and on other

 May. 1965 .

 

 

 
 

  

‘LABO‘R'UNITY WAS THE THEME of an address to some

350 delegates to the 'l6th biennial ILWU convention by
A. C-. Skinner, Mine-Mill international president. Urging a
return to the spirit of such slogans as "Solidarity Forever,"
he was warmly received by the crowd. ‘

MONTGOMERY, Ala.—The civil rights movement is “on the
move, and no wave of racism can stop us,” the Rev. Dr. Martin
Luther King, Jr., told a crowd of 30,000 gathered at the Alabama
Capitol and the world on March 25. Their bodies weary, their
spirits high, the huge multitude had participated in the last lap of
the historic five-day march from Selma to the seat of the Old

Confederacy. -

Its purpose to gain the right to vote for Negroes in Alabama,
the 50-mile march brought a petition of grievances ‘to the governor

of that state, George Wallace.

“In focusing the attention of the

nation and the world today on the ﬂagrant denials of the right to
vote,” saidj-Dr. King, “we are exposing the very origin, the root
cause of racial segregation in the Southland—.” .

The crusade served to dramatize" the injustices and police terror

 
    
 

 

college campuses,’ and continued opposition to the House Un—American Activities

Committee.

Featured speakers at the April 5 to 9 convention——the first such ILWU gathering
outside the United States—included U.S. Senator Ernest Gruening (D-Alaska), who
called for the U.S. to take the Viet Nam situation “to the conference table and stop
the killing;” Mine-Mill International President A. C. Skinner; Harold Gibbons, vice-
president of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters; T. C. (Tommy) Douglas,
a member of the House of Commons of the Canadian Parliament; and Alvin

Hamilton, a Parliament member
from Saskatchewan and one-
time minister of agriculture in
the cabinet of former Prime
Minister Diefenbaker.

Unity Si-ill Required

Urging a return to the spirit
of such slogans as “Solidarity
Forever” and “An Injury to One
Is an Lnjury to All,” Skinner
in his address dealt mainly with
the need for labor union unity,
maintaining that “99 percent of
the workers . . . want a united
labor movement.”

He pointed to the years of co-
operation between Mine-Mill and
the ILWU. and stated that the
two unions have much in com-
mon “because each of our con-
stitutions guarantees the basic
democratic rights and participa-
tion of all our members and full
.equality of members regardless

of race, creed, color, nationality,-
_ or political conviction.”

Attacking “tuxedo unionism”
as exemplified by David Mc-
Donald of the United Steelwork-
ers of America, Skinner never-

theless said, “I think there are »
decent winds blowing ' in -the- -

Millions , Unorgunizecl

He said that labor should be
organizing the millions of work-
ers who are still unorganized,
that there are still too many
people unemployed and too
many‘ uncovered by minimum
wage laws.

“After hearing this speech,”
said ILWU President Harry
Bridges, “I guess we can all
understand why this union
(Teamsters) and its leadership

are in trouble.”

Sen. Gruening, who maintained
that the American people are in
total disagreement with U. S.
policy in Viet Nam, said, “The
facts are very different” from
the official assertion that the
U. S. is in Viet Nam to repel
aggression.

The 78-year-old solon said that
the United States violated the
spirit and the letter of the
Geneva agreement of 1954 by
preventing -an election to unify
the divided country. He attacked

has “utter nonsense” the domino -
theory of the late Secretary of

llnity Action by Steelworkers Loeal

Praised by Vancouver Labor Council

VANCOUVER, B.C.--The Van-
couver Labor Council on April 6
unanimously endorsed a motion
congratulating “those Steelwork-
ers who are now really doing
something to end raids.” Made
by an Oil, Chemical, and Atomic
Workers Union delegate to the
meeting, who pointed out that
“for a number of years this
council and the B. C. Federa-
tion of Labor have deplored and
condemned union raiding,” the
motion referred to those officers
of Steelworkers Local 3302 who
recently journeyed to Trail to
meet with the Cominco Mine.-
Mill Council.

President George Lewis, Vice-
President Nick Smith, and Re-
cording Secretary Glen Snook
of Local 3302 made the trip be-
cause the company they work
for, Western Canada Steel, was
recently bought out by Cominco,
laying the basis for an extension
of the companywide bargaining
so successfully developed by
Mine-Mill in the Cominco chain.

Noting the “real basis for co-

 ‘-age‘

‘OFFICERS OF STEELWORKERS LOCAL 3302 meet with representatives of
Cominco Council in the office of Trail, B.C.'s Mayor Palyga. The extension of company- '

operation between the two unions
because we now work for the
same employer and there is the

advent of steel making at Kim-‘

berley,” Lewis pointed to the
long record of opposition to in-
ter-union raiding by the Steel
local. i

The presence of local 3302 at
the Cominco Council meeting
was greeted with enthusiasm by
Mine-Mill Local 480 President
Robert Keiver. “We would like
to see much more of this,” he
said.

‘ “We have mutual interests
and we can and will combine to
effect them,” said National
Vice-President Harvey Murphy,
who headed the Mine-Mill Co-
minco bargaining committee
which negotiated a 40 cents an
hour two-year contract settle-
ment with the company last
summer after a one-day strike
by some 4,200 workers. He stated
that the Cominco workers had

achieved much and_would be of '

assistance to the ‘men at the
newly—acquired Cominco steel
plant.

Mine-Mill's

wide bargaining, so successfully developed by Mine-Mill in the ~CoI_ninco chain, was
discussed at the meeting, which was ..sought by the Steelworkers because their property,

I The Labor Scene

Bankers Meet on Automation

- A conference on automation sponsored by the American Bank-

ers Association in March noted that automation in American;

industry is increasing rapidly, but was unable to come to any
conclusion as to how significantly this has affected employment.

Although many experts figure jobs destroyed by automation
total in the millions, another group argues that those industries
which have automated most have expanded employment the most.
However, Thomas J. Watson, chairman of the board of the Inter-
national Business Machines Corporation, major manufacturer of
computers essential to automation, reminded the conference that
for, seven straight years the unemployment rate, in the midst-of
an overall economic gain, has not declined.

Republican Congressman Bell, reports the Wall Street Journal,

polled his well-heeled Southern California district and found that:
66 percent of 10,000 constituents who replied to his questionnaire .‘

thought that growing automation threatens full employment.

* J: ‘k
Labor Dept. Studies Moonlight-ing

Also concerning the employment situation is a report by the
Department of Labor which finds thatthere are almost as many
moonlighters as there are unemployed workers. (The department's
figure is 4 million unemployed—generally regarded by labor as
understated.) The department’s report claims that few of the un-
employed could or would take the second jobs held by moonlight-
ers. It cites as reasons: lack of job qualifications, geographic dif-
ferences between the location of the jobs and the location of the
job hunters, matching of jobs held by women and by men.

It also states that there would be no big increase in moon-
lighting if the standard work week were reduced from 40 to 35
hours, since the rate of moonlighting has to do in large part with
working schedules of the main job held by moonlighters. The re-
port points to the high number of second jobs held by postal work-
ers, firemen and policemen on night shifts. Of workers holding two
jobs, it finds, over 70 percent work only part time at the second
one; only 6 percent hold two full time jobs; and about 23 percent
work part time at both jobs.

Fund for Family of Mrs. Liuzzo

President James Hoffa of the Teamsters announced at the

union’s last board meeting that a foundation was being set up by F

the union to receive contributions for the support and education of
the five children of Mrs. Viola Liuzzo, wife of Teamster business
agent Anthony J. Liuzzo of Detroit. Mrs. Liuzzo was murdered by

a sniper in Alabama following the civil rights march from Selma

to Montgomery. Mine‘-Mill has contributed and has sent similar
checks to the families of Jimmie Lee Jackson and the Rev. James
J . Reeb, two other victims of the voter registration struggle in-

that state. * * * -

Vote Fraud Bounces Care_y_
IUE President James Carey resigned his office following re-

lease of a report _by the Labor Department that. Paul Jennings, v
Carey's opponent 111 the recent union election, had won by more ~

than 23,000 votes. The union’s “official” count had shown Carey

to have been elected by some 2,000 votes, but the Labor Depart-

ment says this was the result of a “miscount” of the ballots and
“false reporting” of the results. i

Although some observers claimed Carey had no knowledge of l

the vote steal, President George Meany of the AFL-CIO said,
“Everybody else in Washington knew what was "going on. The only
shock was the extent of the pilferage. Perhaps he didn’t know what

was going on. I happen to think that he should have.” Carey has -

refused Meany’s request for his resignation from the AFLCIO
Executive Council. ,

Both the AFL-CIO and newly-installed IUE President Jennings
have announced they will make thorough investigations of the elec-

tion. Whether or not prosecutions will be instituted under terms of

the Landrum-Griffin Act is not yet known.
Labor observers note that Steelworkers Union election offi-
cials are redoubling their efforts to investigate all complaints about

the recent USW election in which I. W. Abel is unofficially re'- ‘A

ported a close winner over incumbent president David McDonald.

They hope to avoid any possible criticism over conduct of the elec-*1

tion and its results.

The IUE scandal has given a boost to anti-labor groups pushing

for more restrictive union controls.

N. -Y. Times on Bracero Program

The New York Times has editorially commended Labor Sec-
retary W. Willard Wirtz for refusing to give in to what it labels “a

callous, rear-guard action” to readmit low-wage imported farm..
laborers and “condemn American farm workers to continued ex-  1 ,_
ploitation.” The Times noted that, following hearings, the Labor},  ‘
Department established $1.40 an hour as the wage Califorma”_
growers must offer domestic farm workers before a labor shortage ,
is certified and importation of farm workers can be approved._Thet
“If this wage proves insufficiently attractive, _
there is no reason why the law of supply and demand in the labor‘_

editorial added:

field should not bring a higher one.
“Once growers are compelled to recognize the necessity for

- paying a living wage, America’s highly profitable corporate farms.
will cease to be ‘sweatsho'ps in the sun’ and no shadow of excuse I

will exist for the mass import of cheap foreign labor.”

THE MINE-MILL UNION

 

2-Legislative Coalition Rapped
6 By Arizona Council Officers

A PRESCOTT, Ariz.—“A conspiracy to defeat the Governor’s program and an insult to the intel-

P ligence of the people of Arizona who supported Sam Goddard for governor” was the description

given to the House coalition of Republicans and “pinto” Democrats by Rodolfo P. Garcia at a
meeting of the Arizona Mine-Mill Council on April 3.

Garcia, secretary of the council, called the 27th Legislature a “do-nothing” body, pointing out

in particular that it had completely ignored proposed legislation on industrial safety and inspections

' of mills and smelters—areas involving the very lives of large numbers of workers. Council-Chain

man David Duarte, who also reported on the recent legislative session, called the new state civil

’ rights law “a watered-down, piecemeal” measure, and placed the primary responsibility “for such
inadequate legislation” on Rep. John Haugh, a Republican of Pima County.

Although the Democrats took over the governorship in November with the election of Goddard,

the HOUSE Of R€PI‘€S€I1tatiV€S W35 again Organized by a coalition of Democrats and Republicans.

“N, Rep. A. J. (Jack) Gilbert (D-
" Cochise) won the speakership
_ with the aid of the 35 GOP votes
in the House.
From the start of the session,
Goddard saw the lower chamber
, as a, possible major stumbling
 ..bl_ock_to his program.
_ ‘Sen. David Palmer (D-Yava-
pai) was a guest speaker at the
’ council meeting, discussing re-
:-‘ ; ,:dis_tri_cting, reapportionment, and
P ‘ Goddard?s proposed “fair share”
 _ ~'taX.. program: ‘ " ' .
 -. «I'-._irs'I']Presco'i'l' Session
éT_his was the first meeting of
the council in Prescott, where
the Iro_n§King workers last year
bounced‘ the United Steelwork-
ers of America and chose Mine-
Mill as their bargaining agent.
Local 942 President Ralph Gal-
legos welcomed the. delegates of
the council, which rotates the
site of its-quarterly meetings.
Board .Member Maclovio R.

 f_B\a__rraza outlined the legislative A.

program of the international un-
ion, calling ,upon all local un-
ions and ladies auxiliaries to re-
double their efforts to get the

 

 ‘Arizona Congressional‘ ‘delega-

_ tion to vote for.the repealof
 « Section 14(b.) of the Taft-Hartley
- - 7 Act and to support the Metcalf-
" Montoya mine safety bill, the

‘medicare program (approved by
the House of Representatives on
April 8), and. the Johnson ad-
.;.ministration’sV aid to education

 Ibi_.ll. (clearedby both houses and-:

I :._ ..-signed into law by the President

in the middle of the ‘ month).i

Barraza also "urged the council
to work against any attempted
revival of the bracero program,
which has particular impact on
the Southwest in terms of de-
pressing the labor market.

The day prior to the meeting,
the council officers had sent tele-

THE MINE-MILL UNION

- May. ms ,

$39.882 IN SEVERANCE BENEFITS has been paid by the Baltimore, Md. A_S&R refinery
to nine recently retired members of Mine-Mill Local 625 who attended a pensioners party
at the union hall on March 9. That's an average of $4,431.33 per man. The retirees
receive regular monthly pension benefits in addition to the lump sum severance pay-

ments, negotiated during last summer's bargaining sessions.

A total of_ 12 workers

have retired from the Baltimore plant since the plan went into effect last Iuly 1. Local
President Iamuel Tarrant points to the figure, with International Representative Angelo

DeStefano looking on.

Seated clockwise around the table, from the left, are James

Quarrels, William Allen, William Saunders, Theodore Hopkins, Elmer Beans, and Leon-
ard Cooper, the latter of whom retired several years ago. At the left is Iames Bryant,
another recent retiree. Three other pensioners attending the dinner party were (below,

L. to R.) Herbert Wragg, Iohn Giese, and Iames Branford.

 

uffalo Loca Met

With J cwits, N. Y. Reps.

U. S. Senator Jacob K. Javits told representatives of Mine-Mill
Locals 593 and 537 on April 20 that he would support federal mine
safety legislation, the voting rights bill now before Congress, and
repeal of Section 14(b) of the Taft-Hartley Act during this session.
The Mine-Mill delegation was the first labor group to meet with
Sen. Javits atiliis new Western New York office in Buffalo, which

was officially opened that day.

‘Members of the Local 593 political action committee had ear-
lier, on April 10, visited Congressman Henry P. Smith (R-40th

District) at his North Tonawanda office. Several issues of impor-

tance to Mine-Mill members were discussed at a cordial two-hour
meeting, with Rep. Smith pledging his support for a strong, and

effective voting rights law.

While Sen. Javits said that he does not favor cutting the length
of the standard work week legislatively at this time, feeling that

this should be accomplished
through collective bargaining,
he indicated that he would sup-
port now a minimum wage law
calling for $1.50 an hour and
agreed that coverage should be
extended to millions of workers
now excluded.

Medicare Booster '

A supporter of the medicare
bill, the Republican Senator
said some 16 million persons
would immediately benefit from
passage of the measure.

Sen. Javits told the delegation
that he does not favor paying
education costs for service
veterans who are two-year
draftees (the Peace Time Vet-
erans’ Education bill introduced
by Sen. Yarborough of Texas),
but would support provisions to
help subsidize the college edu-
cations of enlistees who had
served three or more years.

Indicating that he supports
President Johnson’s policy in
Viet Nam as outlined by the
President in his Johns Hopkins
University speech, Sen. Javits

‘ said that he feels Johnson should

consult with Congress if he has
any intention of further esca-
lating the war there. Although
not opposed to Sen. Fulbright’s
proposal for a temporary ces-
—satidn of U.S. bombing in North

—Viet Nam, he stated his feeling

that this decision should ‘be left
up to, ..the-v President.

bill and agreed with his posi-
tion that labor unions must re-
main democratic——a position ex-
pressed during the discussion of
the Taft-Hartley Act and its
Section 14(b), which allows
states to enact so-called “right-
to-work’_’ laws.

Predicting that the Senate
can avoid a fillibuster on the
voting rights bill, Sen. Javits
said he would oppose a weaken-
ing amendment proposed by
Minority Leader Everett Dirk-
sen of Illinois.

Many of the same subjects

also were discussed at the

earlier conference with Rep.
Smith, who expressed apprecia-
tion for the information and
material left with him. The po-
litical action committees of the
Buffalo locals later met with
Rep. Richard D. McCarthy (D-
39th District), taking up roughly
the same agenda of issues.

Attending the meeting with
Sen. Javits were Pat Pacile,
president of Local 593; Ed

Paying Dues Pays for
“Thrilled” llnion Maid

BIRMINGHAM, England -— A
19-year-old Beatles fan who at-
tended a union meeting just to
pay her dues is Britain’s young-
est union leader. ‘

“I didn’t even know they were
having an election,” said dark-
haired Valerie Cresswell, the
new president of the 2500-mem-
ber Birmingham branch of the
Electric Trades. Union, who has
also been appointed to the Bir-
mingham Trades Union Council.

“Valerie is a good union mem-
ber,” said Harry Mason, region-
al secretary for the union, “and
she’s not afraid ‘to stand up to
the management. We're expect-
ing great things.”

Miss Cresswell, who as-
sembles lighting fixtures, call-
ing herself “the most surprised
girl in Birmingham,” says she’s
“absolutely thrilled.”

“I think I’m fully aware of
my presidential responsibili-
ties,” she said, “and I hope to
carry them out to the best of
my ability.” '

She was the only person nomi-
nated for the office and her
election was unanimous.

In addition to urging support
for broad mine safety and
voting rights bills, medicare,
and repeal of Section 14(b) of
Taft-Hartley, the union com-
mittees discussed the need for
a 35-hour work week, double
time pay for all overtime,"a $2
per hour minimum wage with
broad coverage, and peace
through negotiations.

At the State Capitol in Albany,

Cantrece Nylons: As Advertised

The advertising claims for stockings of Cantrece fiber, at new
type of stretch nylon yarn, have concentrated on comfort and gfit,
rather than durability. These claims are justified, says CONSUMER I
REPORTS in its May issue. ‘ 7_

Consumers Union use-tested a brand of Cantrece stockings sell- , V
ing for $1.65. On the leg, these stockings looked very muchlike
regular 15-denier nylons, but with a slightly duller sheen.

The stockings were tried by a test panel of 25 women——12 house-
wives and 13 office workers. Each received a pair of Cantrece and
a pair of comparable stockings of regular nylon. She wore them I
on alternate days until she decided they were unfit for further
wear. Then she repeated the test, with fresh samples.

The Cantrece stockings wore about as well as regular stockings,
and in some other respects performed about the same. But almost
all the women found that Cantrece fitted and conformed to thellegl 
better than regular nylons, and had a more pleasing feel. Ofthe 
25 panelists, 16 preferred Cantrece, 6 preferred regular nylons, ‘
and 3 had no preference.

Price was something else again; though some panelists were
prepared to pay a slight premium for Cantrece, the majority were
unwilling to pay the high price—-$1.65—of the model tested. How-
ever, stockings of Cantrece yarn are now ‘obtainable in another

  

brand at a lower price, but Consumers Union has not tested them.

Why Auto Dealers Don't Like Cash Buyers

The buyer "with cash in hand used to enjoy a preferred posi- "
tion; a dealer would shade his price for cash, or even offer a.sub-
stantial discount. - o

For years now, this has not been true in the automotive market; T
in its May -issue, CONSUMER REPORTS tells why. Some of the evi--
dence is gathered from a hearing on an application by Sears, Roe-
buck & Co. for a license to make loans for automobile purchases
in California; the loans would enable buyers to pay cash at the
dealer’s and therefore to shop around for the lowest price. i A ,

Established lenders and auto dealers lobbied against the appli- ’
cation. At the hearing, a dealer admitted that he would try to
charge more for a car bought for cash than for one bought on"
credit, and the president of the Northern California ’Motor Car
Dealers Association admitted that he did not want to sell cars for
cash. Asked why, he explained: B 7

“. . . I want to sell cars for the most profit that I can per car.
Finance reserve (dealer’s share of the carrying charges) and insur-
ance commissions are part of the profit derived from selling a car
on time. . .” , ‘
- Also, says Consumers Union, finance and insurance arrange-
ments leave plenty of room for manipulation. A cash buyer is in-
terested in price, and able to keep his eye on the ball. But there
are many waysto confuse the credit buyer. ‘

Some tricks of the trade came out in the report of a California‘-

, » Assembly Interim Committee on Finance and Insurance.

Selling at big-volume auto outlets, it appears, is done by a team.
of “liner,” “T-O man,” finance man, and closer.

The liner meets the prospect at the door, finds out whetherishe
is a cash or credit buyer, what he has to trade in, how much a; .
month he plans on paying. He turns over to the T-O (take-over)  A ”
man who builds upgthe deal with extras, insurance, and longer
terms. . i
The finance man figures the take on one deal as opposed to
another; adjusts the terms to make up for the trade-in allowance;
and arranges for a down-payment loan, if needed, from a small; ‘
loan company. The closer winds up the deal. ‘

Pressure is used at-every point. One technique is to keep the --
customer waiting for hours, in order to make him tired of waiting, i ;
tired of negotiating, and eager to close the deal. Sometimes -this 
is accomplished by “bushing,” i.e. hiding the car the customer 3
came in. ' '

Waiting time may be spent in small customer booths known _ .
as hot boxes. They may be wired for sound so that the sales. -crew
can listen in on the family’s private conversation and find out how’
to slant the deal. 3,. ,

During the negotiations, various members of the saleslteami-_ ._ P
pop in and out of the hot box. Deal after deal is discussed, jetted
down, and discarded. The customer may be asked to sign several
sets of documents, often in blank. A good many car buyers ‘don’t ,
get copies of their contracts and don’t know what they have signed. I 

Even with a copy of the contract, a buyer might have trouble _t ‘
spotting such traps as unnecessary and expensive insurance, or
limited insurance when he has asked for full coverage; a large 
final payment he has not been told about; the fact that he has  
signed a second mortagage on his home, or that he has contracte  ' 3
for a small loan at high interest rates in addition to the car loangj 
and so on and on. , - ‘ A

Not all dealers are guilty; some are neither equipped nor in-. . V , ﬂ
clined for the fast shuffle. A small minority was involved in the’,
most serious offenses, the California committee noted,-—-but“ this a
minority was made up of large-volume dealers, who exert a great I
influence over smaller dealers. The implication was that such prac- -
tices would grow. . - . 1 A.

Do the manufacturers know about these practices? Yes, said‘
Richard Williams recently in Automotive News. He was identifiedr , I
as a sales consultant, calling on dealers across the nation. 3 ‘

“The factory ‘men must know,” he said. “The only answer
seems to be that the factories tolerate crooks if crooks move cars.” '-
Not all customers are equally vulnerable, Consumers Union
points out. The sophisticated buyer with cash in hand can keep 
himself clear of the auto dealers’ complex dealsf ‘ "
With increasing opportunities for low-cost direct cash loans
for car purchases, it is quite likely that a growing number of. car ,
buyers will become cash buyers. They will be interested in price,j -I

 

count dealers. Up" to now, auto manufacturers have, through-their
franchise system,‘ prohibited selling through discount outlets. But

THE MINHE-MILL UNION

THE EL PASO, TEXAS LEAD SMELTER and slag fuming plant of the American Smelting and Refining Company is

under contract with Mine-Mill Local 509. The sme1ter's rated capacity is»360,000 tons of concentrates per year. Lead

bullion from El Paso is shipped for refining to the AS&R plant in‘ Omaha, Nebraska, represented by Mine-Mill Local
1 461. The El Paso plant also has a rated smelting capacity of 420,000 tons of copper per year, according to the

American Bureau of Metal Statistics. The plant was constructed in 1887 and acquired by AS&R in 1899.

Brass Volume Continues to Be High
Brass mills are pleased with volume so far this year and look
forward to continued high sales. They are less satisfied with the
price picture, but are cautious about discussing it. The American
Metal Market comments, “Their reserve is understandable if one

' takes into consideration the government’s action of not too long

, ago when a number of well respected mill executiveswere taken
into court regarding pricing matters.”

' Major problem they face is the premium price the independents
have to pay for metal. Integrated mills have a supply problem
too, but it’s not so severe.

Missouri Lead Smelfer Slated

M [American Metal Climax and Homes-take Mining Company are
putting an additional $13 million into their joint operations in Mis-
souri. The new outlay is for construction of a smelter and refinery
with ‘an annual capacity of 100,000 tons of lead. The ‘plant will
handle 70,000 tons of concentrates from their Missouri mines, plus
70,000 tons, on a toll basis, from Montana Phosphate and Magnet
"Cove Barium properties in Missouri. The new smelter will be the
first new primary lead producing plant built in the United States
since World War II. It is being designed to allow for future ex-
pansion and is expected to be in operation in late 1967 or 1968 when
the mines begin production.

«Anaconda Tops in Copper Production

Anaconda Company, for the second year running, was the
_world’s biggest co-pper producer. 1964 production was 583,996 tons,
up 18,111 tons from 1963. (Kennecott, which has been running sec-
‘ond, turned out 553,000 tons in 1964, compared with 536,000 in 1963.)
*Anaconda’s chief executive officer, Charles M. Brinkerhoff, re-
- ported that the company’s production capacity goal in Montana is
g .-25 million pounds of copper per month, and that output there has
. ; almost reached that figure.

 In spite of record production, however, the company has told
its ‘U. S. customers it will reduce copper shipments, beginning with
- May deliveries, by 20 to 30 percent.<Reasons given include furnace
" trouble at the Raritan refinery, a railroad strike holding up ship-
. -ments out of Chuquicamata in Chile, and the backlog in processing

Newmont Mining will get unde-rway shortly with a major open
pit gold mine near Carlin, Nevada. Full operation is expected by
this summer at the rate of 2,000 tons per day. Newmont has in-
vested $10 million in the project and expects to recover its invest-
ment in three years. The anticipated quick return is attributed to
the low operating cost, high productivity, and high profit margin
of the mine. It is estimated that ore reserves will last 10 years.

Santa Rita Homes fo Be Moved

The town of Santa Rita, N. M. is moving again. Kennecott is
expanding its Chino pit onto the townsite and within three or four
years 350 homes will have to be vacated.

The community of Santa Rita goes back to 1803, when it was
established by Spanish copper miners, the ancestors of some of
the present Mine-Mill members at_ Kennecott. The present town-
site dates from 1915 and since then there have been two moves.
In 1953, 35 homes, a general store, and a hospital were moved,

Raiding Again
Qoiidemned by
median MP.

TORONTO, Ont.—“The New
Democratic Party isn’t for sale
. . .” said H. W. Herridge, a
veteran member of Parliament
from Kootenay West, replying to
the lead editorial in the April
issue of the Miner’s Voice, a
publication of the United Steel-
workers of America.

Herridge and Reeve Leonard
Mahoney of Mountjoy Township,
it seems, aren’t too popular with
the Steelworkers these days.
They’ve both been cooperative
with Mine-Mill and have ex-
pressed firm stands against
union raiding. “Mine-Mill apolo-
gists” is the way the editorial,
“What’s with the N.D.P.?,” puts
it.

“The United Steelworkers does
not stint its money or manpower
in backing NDP . . . one takes
for granted that the party’s poli-
ticians reciprocate this solid
support,” states the USW arti-
cle, threateningly calling upon
the party for some explanation
of Herridge’s and Mahoney’s
behavior-

“I’m horrified at the sugges-
tion in the editorial that be-
cause somebody gives some
money to support the NDP they
o-wn it,” replies Herridge, “I
can tell the writer, whoever he
may be . . that kind of cor-

High involving Overhead Cralies 

 

 

  «Em-Y “'41 —-—-j 1:

The non-ferrous metals industry is one of six industrial groups with a strikingly highrate of
accidents involving overhead cranes, reports a recent study by the National Safety Council. The over-
all rate of disabling injuries in non-ferrous metals, the report notes, is 6.4 per million man-hours.

The rate for disabling injuries
13.35 per million man-hours.

involving cranes in non-ferrous metals is more than twice that -

The report states that “cab-operated cranes have a higher frequency rate of property damage
accidents than pendant operated cranes controlled from the floor.

“A higher disabling injury" and injury severity rate exists for pendant operated cranes.”

More details may be available from the text of the full report which has not yet been re-

ceived. At the right is a table

Toilings Dom Break
Under lnvesI'iga'I'ion

The Chilean government has
launched an official investiga-
tion into possible negligence in
the death of almost the entire
population of El"Cobre, a copper
rnining town 80 miles north of
Santiago, in a March 28 earth-
quake. More than 300 men,
women and children, thei-r
homes and farms, were engulfed
when the tailings dam of the
French-controlled La Disputada
de Las Condes Mining Company
gave way, burying them under
a torrent of mud’ and water—-
a slimy mass of ‘sulphuric min-
eral waste-—-four miles long and
one mile wide. It was reported
that only one seven-year-old girl
survived in the entire village.
It was stated that union of-
ficials three years ago had de-
manded -that either the area
behind the mud dam, which held
back a 35-year accumulation of
tailings, be drained, or that the
town itself be moved to a safer
site. -
Chile’s President Frei himself
expressed doubts about the wis-
dom of the mining camp loca-
tion when he visited the site
of the disaster. Chile’s official
newspaper, La Nacion, demand-
ed an investigation and Frei has
designated Eduardo Simian,
Minister of Mines, to name a
board of inquiry to report on the
disaster.
A company official expressed
doubt that any regulations had
been violated, but members of
the Chilean Congress and the
press have been sharply critical
-of the failure to drain the pond,
particularly in View of the fre-
quency of earthquakes-in the
South American country.
Anaconda and Kennecott, ma-
-jor U. S. copper producers in
Chile, reported little or no dam-
age to their operations.

NLRB Rules Back, Pay: 

 

Due 21 Arizona Workers‘.

- HUMBOLDT, Ariz_—The National Labor Relations 28th :Re-* 
gional Board on. March 31 upheld the recommendations -of its-‘trial’ l U

examiner, Louis S. Penfield, by ordering fullreinstatement  A I
back pay plus interest for 21 workers at Shattuck Denn’s Iron-King‘
Mine here——a* decision which is being appealed by the company. ~ 

Found to be engaged inunfair labor practices, Shattuck Denn?‘

 
  

“wants to have the decision reviewed by an appellate court,'." 
according to Curtis R. Sundeen, general manager of the mine. ’ 

The case stems from a strike last May 5, when members. of 
Mine-Mill Local 942 walked off their jobs in protest over the firing‘ xi"

 

of Nick Olvera, the vice-president of the local. Although most
returned to work on May 14, after unfair labor practices charges ‘-

were filed against the company,
Shattuck Denn refused to allow
19 employees to return, saying
that they had been permanently
replaced. Another worker, Lupe
Jaime, was fired for alleged

“unlawful conduct” during the.
strike——also a discharge that-

Penfield and the NLRB found to
be unjustified

Having g a in e di bargaining l

rights at Iron King only last
March, taking over from the
United Steelworkers of America,
Mine-Mill argued that ,Olver,a’s
firing was a result of the active
part he played with the new
local. “It is clear,” Penfield
said in -his report, “that the
newly certified union undertook
to pursue its recently acquired
bargaining rights with vigor.”
“ . . . the discharge of one of
the more forcible union adher-

ents would serve as a warning.

to the union to take it easy,”
he said.

The NLRB agreed that the
firing was “discriminatory.” I -
To Regain Seniority

held, will mean back pay for

Savfe-Crew Low Upheld

Leaders of the Brotherhood of
Locomotive Firemen and __En-
ginem_en hailed last month’s
decision by the New York State
Supreme Court upholding the
constitutionality of the state’s
Safe-Crew Law. Ten railroads
had brought suit to have the law

. tossed out on grounds that it
was unnecessary and unreason-
able. J . _

In his decision, Judge Gerald
Nolan upheld the union’s con-
tention that firemen and brake-
men “contribute to the safety

of the operations in which they
are engaged.”

The New York case is one of
several involving the union’s
opposition to a compulsory arbi-
tration order eliminating fire-
men. BLF&E has insisted that
since the order took effect rail-
road accidents have increased.

Benefits for Silicoﬁcs

miners were reported to have
attacked police headquarters in
the Asturian mining center of
Mieres last month, capping a

point for miners from all over

Madrid officials said the dem-

test over benefits for silicotic
