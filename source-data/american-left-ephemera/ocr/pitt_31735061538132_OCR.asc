lives of your grandchildren. I want to do what little I
can to rouse the American people to the realization of
the seriousness of the issues involved.

There are, of course, many issues. But they merge
into a single issue—progress vs. reaction. And, let me
tell you, the "reactionary forces here are busy day and
night. They think they have a chance of winning

and gaining the control of the next two or more

generations. _

The world is engulfed in a crisis so great that it is
almost beyond brief statement, beyond definition. I am
a writer, and in my last book I dealt with Yugoslavia,
or largely‘ with Yugoslavia, but the crisis which is tear-
ing that country is working all over the world—also
here in America, in Michigan, in Detroit.

Let me speak to you personally as one citizen to
others. Allow me to repeat some of the things I have
been saying of late elsewhere. I believe that the fate
after this war of the democratic and progressive forces
in the United States is all tied up with the fate of
those forces in the rest of the world. The democratic,
progressive purposes can win only if they win in
Michigan and Poland, in Ohio and Yugoslavia, in
Illinois and. Czechoslovakia, in Indiana and France, in
Kentucky and Spain.

This is one of my chief ideas these days. I was born
in Yugoslavia, and as such I have moments when I
feel especially strongly about Yugoslavia. In Yugo-
slavia, there is the so—called Tito—Mikhailovich situa-
tion, of which you have read. Things are happening
there at a furious rate; the future in Yugoslavia insists
upon taking shape. But the forces so evidently at large
in Yugoslavia are grappling among themselves else—
where—all over Europe; also here in America.

Heretofore power in the Balkans, in Poland, and in
some of the other European countries has not been in
the hands of peoples’ representatives, but in the hands
of corrupt exploiters of the people and servants of
soulless imperialist, reactionary and fascistic forces in
central and western Europe. This has to be changed.
Democracy must get a break over there, or the re-
actionary forces in the Balkans, in Poland, in Italy, if
they get re-established there, will adversely affect
democracy in America. .

I am not theorizing when I say this. I am speaking
actualities. In the past two years we have had ample
foreshadowing of this in the doings of reactionary,
fascistic forces within the Yugoslav government-in-
exile which have created a vast propaganda machine

I10:

 

 

in the United States, commanding the services of such
curious people as Ruth Mitchell and Congressman
George Dondero of Michigan, and employing undemo-
cratic, subversive methods to achieve divisive, undemo-
cratic ends in this country, and in postwar Yugoslavia.

For nearly two years now Ruth Mitchell, rolling
along on the prestige of her late brother, has been go-
ing about this country waging an utterly fantastic
verbal war on the Croatians as a people, on the Yugo-
slavv Partisans and their cause, on Yugoslavia as a
state. With what result? She has confused a great
many decent Americans so that they don’t know what
to think of Yugoslavia and the postwar European prob-
lem. And she has been a godsend to Axis propaganda
in the Balkans. It so happens that Ruth Mitchell’s
fantastic views as expressed to American lecture audi-
ences and in American newspaper interviews often are
promptly repeated over quisling radios in Croatia or
Serbia. Why are they repeated by quisling-Axis radios
in the Balkans? Because they help the Axis to divide
the Balkan nations into insanely nationalistic groups.

And how does Axis propaganda machine get hold
of Ruth Mitchell’s statements made in Detroit or
San Francisco? Well, here is one explanation. The
Yugoslav embassy in Washington cables them in code
to the Yugoslav legation in Argentina, which is not at
war with Germany, and from there they are flashed to
Germany. That’s how it works——and, for my part, it
works against the interests of the United Nations.

And who or what is the Yugoslav embassy in Wash-
ington? The ambassador is a man named Constantin
Fotich. He was appointed to his present post back in
1936 by the first pro-Axis premier of Yugoslavia, Stoya—
dinovich. He is a cousin of General Nedich, who for
two years now has been Hitler’s quisling in Serbia.
And for two years now this man Fotich, accredited to
the United States by the Yugoslav government—in-exile,
has been developing a policy antagonistic to Yugo-
slavia, to the united Partisan movement.

For two years now Fotich’s agents have been busy
perpetrating disunity among Slavic Americans, espe-
cially Yugoslav Americans, to the detriment of America
and Yugoslavia. For two years now Fotich’s agents,
which include various intellectual perverts who are
naturalized or native citizens of the United States,
have been waging smear campaigns against people who
do not side with Fotich’s and Ruth Mitchell’s views
and purposes. The smear campaign against me seems
now to be coming to a head. Congressman Dondero of

Royal Oak, Michigan, who once praised Mussolini,
I  I

appears to be the latest recruit of Fotich’s Chetniks in
Washington, commanded by Ruth Mitchell. Last week
this Dondero rose in Congress to attack the American
Slav Congress and me. Personally, I am ﬂattered; it
is almost as good as if Goebbels would suddenly de-
nounce me. I can imagine no greater compliment. And
I am sure the American Slav Congress leaders feel the
same way. .

These attacks are doing us no harm. They are, in
fact, helpful. They clarify the issue of the day, which,
as I have said, is the issue of progress vs. reaction, the
people vs. various oligarchies, democracy 17$. fascism.

This is the issue which will be decided in 1944-
here and in Europe—and, to repeat, I mean to do what
little I can so that the issue will be decided in favor

of democracy and progress, in favor of the trend toward V

general welfare, provided for in the American consti-
tution so far as this country is concerned.

I am an American. Most of my books deal with
America. I love this country, as I am sure all of you
love it. In many ways it is the best place in the world;
perhaps that’s why most of us are here. We like, we
love it. Just now about a million of our fellow Slavic
Americans are serving in the army and navy, ﬁghting
in Italy and the South Pacific. There are something
like 12 or 15 millions of us all over the United States.
Some estimates run to the effect that over 50 percent
of the manpower in heavy war industries is of Slavic
origin or descent. .

We are working first of all for America, of which we
are an integral part; our strongest passion is for this
country both now in wartime and in peace.

But many of us cannot help thinking also of the
old country. Personally, I am very much interested in
the future of Yugoslavia—both for Yugoslavia’s own
sake and, as already suggested, for the sake of America,
In fact, my interest spreads to the whole of the Bal-
kans and to thecountries north of the Balkans.

I know that this audience includes Americans of all
the different Slavic backgrou_nds—Polish, Czech, Slo-
vak, Serbian, Bulgar, Croatian, Slovenian, Macedo-
nian, Montenegrin, Russian, Ukrainian and Carpatho-
Russian—and I hope you will forgive me if, as a Yugo-
slav American, I have more to say about Yugoslavia
than about any other of the “old countries.”

‘I am stressing Yugoslavia not only because I happen
to know" more about it than, say, about Poland, but
also because Yugoslavia just now is one of the most
important places in the world. There the future is be-

I12-

 

 

ing enacted on the stage of the present. It is important,
it is urgent for all American citizens to learn all they
can about the Yugoslav situation—for, let me make this
as clear as I can, whatever will happen in Yugoslavia
politically during the next few months will aftect
American lives, lives right_here in Michigan, quite as
much as anything that will happen in the Mid-West.

For two years we have been hearing and reading
amazing stories about Yugoslavia’s resistance against
the Axis. But it is only in recent months that we have
begun to learn the truth about it. ,

Only lately have we discovered that the Yugoslavs
who have been fighting the Axis occupation tooth and
nail are not the so-called Chetniks led by Drazha
Mikhailovitch and the -Yugoslav government-in-exile.

These Davids armed almost literally with slingshots
against the modern Goliath of tanks and bombers are
the revolutionary Partisans of the Yugoslav Liberation
Front, commanded by Marshal ]osip Brozovich, popu-
larly known as Tito.

The world has been the victim of a hoax, of a great
falsehood, perpetrated by the propaganda machine of
the government-in-exile which has wanted and tried
to convince the peoples of Britain and America that it

’ ought to be returned to power in Yugoslavia.

The incredible feats of the heroic Yugoslav resist-
ance are_true; the growth of strength and unity among
these men and women bearing arms in Yugoslavia is
true.‘But it is not Mikhailovitch’s Chetniks who fight
the invaders——it is Tito’s Partisans.’ ~

Under other circumstances it wouldn’t make much
difierence which man heads the ﬁerce, all-out guerilla
ﬁghting which, without waiting for an Anglo—Amer-
ican invasion, or Anglo—American tools of war, has kept
20 to 30 Axis divisionspinned down in Yugoslavia and
away from Russia, Africa and Italy. But in this case
it makes all the diﬂierence in the world. ‘

The thing goes far beyond Mikhailovitch and Tito.
It goes down to the roots of the present world war,
which are also the roots of any future peace.‘

After the war, the world—and Europe and Yugo-
slavia—will have to be rebuilt-—and the reasons why
Mikhailovitch has not fought the invaders the way the
Partisans have—and why he has instead repeatedly
opened battle against Tito’s forces—are reasons ‘con-
nected with Yugoslavia’s part in the war and with the
way she is to be rebuilt after it is over.

Let’s try to put it in a nutshell.

Prewar Yugoslavia was a dictatorship. Deep—down
the country was torn by chauvinist cross—purposes. It

I13:

 

 

  

was exploited by foreign ﬁnancial interests. Its govern-
ment was inept and corrupt. The majority of people
were poverty stricken in the midst of great undeveloped
natural resources.

Soon after Yugoslavia collapsed early in ’4l under
the impact of the Axis invasion, the Yugoslav people-
hundreds of thousands of them-determined first to
resist the Axis and second to develop a people’s power
able to fashion their country’s future.

It was resistance. It was also revolution, a people’s
rising against their ,diverse enemies, foreign and do-
rnestic.

Mikhailovitch was the government’s man. When he
came up against the revolution, he began to fight it.

Partisans are the revolution, the future;‘Mikhailo-
vitch and the Chetniks are counter—revolution, the past.

To get the arms with which to ﬁght the Partisans,
the Chetnik commanders have collaborated with the
German and Fascist-Italian commanders, while the
government—in—exile in London was stealing Partisan
victories to attribute them to Mikhailovitch in world
publicity.

This went on for two years—until just the other
day. Some of us in the United States had a hand in
exposing the hoax. Then the Moscow Conference took
cognizance of the situation. Then General Maitland
Wilson, the British commander in Egypt, denounced
the Chetniks for collaborating with the Germans.

It looks like the big United Nations are going to
drop Mikhailovitchand recognize Tito and his Partisan
resistance and revolution. If I am right, and I think
I am, this will be a step in the right direction—toward
a better Yugoslavia, a better Europe, and world peace.

But what about the rest of Eastern Europe? Particu-
larly, what about Czechoslovakia and Poland?

You have probably read in this morning’s papers
that President Benes of Czechoslovakia is in Moscow
to sign a pact with the Soviet Union. It is going to be
a pact of very close friendship, of the closest coopera-
tion between Russia and Czechoslovakia.

I believe that Dr. Benes’ friendly policy toward the
Soviet Union is sheer wisdom from the point of view
of the Czech and Slovak peoples. Frankly, I did not
always see eye toueye with Dr. Benes, but I feel that
in the last year and a half he has been extremely sound
and wise. He has become a great leader, not only of
European but of world importance. He is the only
political ﬁgure of the prewar period in the Old World
who has learned a lesson from the horrible European

I14:

  

failure between the two world wars. Czechoslovakia
will greatly beneﬁt from his leadership. And I believe
that Czech and Slovak Americans should be very
proud of him. I can tell you that he has many ardent
admirers among the Yugoslav Americans.

‘I believe that the whole of eastern and central Eu-
rope has a chance of beneﬁting from Dr. Benes’ politi-
cal initiative. I hope with all my heart that Poland will
beneﬁt from it. This morning’s papers report that Dr.
Benes is trying to help in working out an approach
toward the future friendship between Russia and
Poland. I hope very much that he succeeds.

I am a great admirer of Poland. I have many friends
among Polish Americans in various parts of the United
States. I correspond with hundreds of them. With
some of them I have lately discussed the question of
Poland and the attitude of Polish Americans toward
that question.

As I see the problem of Poland, she will have to get
rid of her old government leadership—her feudal aris-
tocracy, which is sick and dangerous—her reactionaries
and semi-fascists. She will have to get rid of the clique
that in this country revolves around Matuszewski and
around the so—called Knapp organization.

As I see it, Poland will have to get rid of this de-
crepit clique and develop a leadership able to work
constructively with Russia in the east and with Czecho-
slovakia in the west, and be friendly with the demo-
cratic Yugoslav federation.

Perhaps this will not be easy, for it will have to be’

done quickly—within the next few months. But I be-
lieve that Polish Americans in Detroit, Chicago, Buf-

I falo, Cleveland, and New York can greatly help by

extending their natural American democratic attitudes
and impulses to the problem of Poland, in which the
United States as a whole is also deeply interested.

Why should a Polish American be a democrat in
reference to America and a reactionary in reference
to Poland? I think he shouldn’t. I think he should fol-
low the Rev. Stanislaus Orlemanski, the American-
born priest of Polish parentage, pastor of the Holy
Virgin church in Springﬁeld, Mass., who spoke here in
Detroit recently, and whom the alien Polish agents in
America are now trying to smear as a “Communist.”
I think it is highly improper for congressmen in Wash-
ington who are of Polish descent, whether they are
from Detroit or Chicago, to deliver speeches in Con-
gress which serve the purposes of Polish reaction.

Personally, I cannot understand how any Polish
American, who is really an American, can support the

I15:

Matuszewski’ clique  the _ Kn-

understand such Polish: Americ , My _

can understand the few Yugoslav A

support the sickening regime of King peter‘; at
doings of Ambassador ‘Fotich ?and Ruth Mitchell,

Time and events are rushing on. Our responsibility
as Americans, as Slavic Americans is Very great. I

Let me repeat: Whatever is going to happen’ in
Yugoslavia or in Poland in the next few months is
going to affect American lives and American democracy
in Michigan and New York and Illinois and Oregon.
The world now is all of one piece. Whatever of any
importance happens in any part of it affects many other
parts of the world. Y . I

It is within our power that the right developments
come to pass in Poland and Yugoslavia and in other
countries. I feel that to exercise that power is our
American duty.

It is our American duty to support the union of pur-A

poses achieved by President Roosevelt, Prime Minister
Churchill,‘ Marshal Stalin and Generalissimo Chiang
Kai—Shek at Cairo and Teheran. In that union of pur-
poses, in that union of approaches to the problems of
the world, is the future of manl<ind—and don’t let any-
body tell you otherwise! In that union of purposes is

the will of history. a

For Dynamic Unity in the Immigrant
Groups

Delivered on October 30, 194.5», at the Tenth Anniversary
National Conference of the American Committee for Protection
of Foreign Born, in New York City:

DURING AND AFTER the First World War this country
got pretty excited about the so-called hyphenated citi-
zen—“the foreigner.” This ﬁnally led to the unfortu-
nate and shameful persecution of the foreign—born by
Attorney General Palmer and the Ku Klux Klan.

So far in this war—aside from professional alien-
baiters and from the relocation of the Japanese group
on the Pacific Coast, which was prompted by exclu-
sionist hysteria as well as military need—the country is
not much stirred up about “the foreigner.” This fact
may be of immense value to our American future, and
to the world’s.

But all is not sunshine and roses.

A while ago someone said, and with much truth,
that thﬁ: sitllllation inﬂmany oif tlllxe “foreign” grglilps, as
1t touc es t e war e ort an t e post-war pro em, is
dynamite. You can’t neutralize dynamite with hysteria;
you can explode it intelligently.

At the moment the odds appear to be slightly in
favor of our avoiding hysteria in this war. It will de-
pend, however, on how intelligent we become about
the unique human resources and the considerable
dan ers which exist side b side in the new-immi rant

8 _ Y _ 8
groups. The dangers w1ll be effectively removed only
if we find a way of making some positive, special use
of the resources; only if we turn the dynamite outward
to explode at what is unsound here and abroad.

The absence so far of any great hysteria about “the
foreigner” gives our leadership a chance to direct the
explosion to achieve the latter. And when one speaks
of leadership these days one means primarily the Gov-
ernment; in this case, the White House, the State and
War and Justice Departments, and the Offices of War
Information and Strategic Services. But it is our job,
too; the job of each and every one of us.

We must all realize—as soon and as widely and
wisely as possible—that most of the new—immigrant
groups have special, positive assets to enlist in winning
the war and the peace. Over one-third of the men and
women in the Army and Navy have such names as

I3-

 

  

Kadlubowski, Levy, Suchy, Terbovec, Vlavianos, Mir-
kovich, Schlesinger, Romello. Names like these are
appearing in casualty lists and honor rolls. They are
in the majority on the employee rosters of our war
industries. .

And there is still another, a unique service which
new—immigrant groups can render.

In most of the “foreign” groups, many people are
passionately interested in the American war effort be-
cause they know personally or through family or
friends what it is like to live under the Nazi-fascist
“order.” They realize, not only that it must not hap-.
pen here, but that the future of their homelands de-

' pends on defeating the Axis and its quislings.

They are-—inevitably—worried about the old coun-
tries, where Hitler is systematically exterminating the
peoples of Poland, Yugoslavia and Greece, and tighten-
ing his murderous grip on the other countries. And so
the Polish American, for instance, or the Slovenian
American is specially conscious of his heritage just
now. It is immeasurably painful to him to hear that
his native village is one of the 150-odd Slovenian
villages which have been wiped out by the Nazis and
fascists during the last two years, or that his uncle was
hanged to a tree as a hostage in Poland. He is a special
kind of American—a Polish or Slovenian American;
and, even if he does not yet realize it clearly," he is
waiting for the leadership in Washington to begin to
use him, his linguistic talents and emotional and in-
tellectual ties with the Old World.

There are hundreds of thousands of them—extraor~
dinarily able and thoroughly Americanized immigrants
and their sons and daughters. A few of them write to

me every day, asking me where they might fit in, to .

whom to write in Washington, what steps to take to
achieve some function that will mean something in
bringing on a better world. I am convinced that their
work in the war effort and in plans for the post-war
world, if properly organized, would be a new, positive,-
dynamic and truly American force.

The Government must seek out the potential new
leaders in our immigrant groups who believe in democ-
racy and practice‘ it. It must convince them that our
postwar purposes are democratic, favoring a better
future for the peoples of their old countries. It must
tell them that it needs their services as Americans
because of their special qualiﬁcations—now to convey
America’s intention to enemy and occupied countries;
later to help in the reconstruction.

There is much thinking and talking along this line

l4l

 

 

 

 

"in and out of Washington. Why hesitate? Why not

explode the dynamite in the right direction by using
the special talents of our new Americans? The whole
idea, of course, is unprecedented. But so is the world
problem which confronts us.

The Government should encourage—certainly not
discourage—dynamic movements within the immigrant
groups.

A few days after Pearl Harbor—on December 10,
l94l—the State Department in Washington issued a
statement _in which the new—immigrant groups were
asked to refrain from developing political movements
in the United States whose aims and purposes referred
to the immigrants’ old countries. In effect, the request
of the‘ State Department was that the immigrants sup-
press or curb their perturbance about the future of
their native lands and let Washington attend to it.

I suppose there were more reasons than one for this
statement——this request by the State Department which
a great many immigrants took as equivalent to official
instructions to them on how to behave. The chief mo-
tive of the statement undoubtedly was national unity.

At that time—a time of extreme peril, when our
military prospects were very dark—there was good
reason for stressing unity; and it can be argued that all
sorts of movements concerned with the future of
Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, Poland, Italy, etc., would
have resulted then in divergencies which might have
worked against the unity of effort in the war.

However, the period of extreme peril is over, has
been’ over for at least a year; now victory, While not yet
imminent, is assured. Of course there is still need of
unity, but I think primarily of a dynamic unity of
those who are interested not only in getting the war
over with but also in a better world afterward.

The dynamic favoring a better world—a democratic
world so organized that it will offer a chance of general
welfare-—is especially strong in the immigrant groups
for reasons which I have suggested. Why not encour-
age that dynamic? Why not organize it under whatever
title it may prefer to be organized?

I happen to have been born in Yugoslavia; I am a
Yugoslav American. There are about a million of us
Yugoslav Americans, scattered all over the country.
Most of the people in the group to which I belong are
neck—deep in the war effort, and they worry about the
old country. What will happen there? Will the Mik-
hailovich hoax triumph? Will the Liberation or Par-

tisan movement be given a chance by the Great

I5!

  

Powers? Most of us Yugoslav Americans are worried
about that. We have been worried for over a year,
when we began to discover that Mikhailovich was a
hoax, a tool of the amoral interests.

Recently, however, we took the bull by the horns
and we organized into the United Committee of South-
Slavic Americans, which includes not only Yugoslav
but also Bulgarian and Macedonian Americans. Our
purposes are: '

1. To promote the dynamic unity of Americans of South-
Slavic origin and background behind the United States’ and
the United Nations’ war against the Axis, and behind the
post—war plans and operations—the latter particularly as they
pertain to the South-Slavic peoples.

2. To speak in the interest of South-Slavic peoples who,
under the Axis which they are ﬁghting, cannot fully speak for
themselves to the American people and the rest of the world.

Our Committee’s paramount concern is for the
triumph—in connection with and after the war—of
democratic forces in America and the rest of the world.
These forces in the various countries are interde-
pendent. Theycan only win together.

This being one of its basic ideas, our Committee is
mindful of the need of strengthening the democratic
processes in the United States, currently under attack
from many sides. At the same time, it insists that after
the present conflict the democratic elements in the
South-Slavic lands get an opportunity to realize their
centuries—old aspirations for freedom and democracy.
Our Committee feels those aspirations can be realized

 

only on the basis of the peoples’ right of self-determi- -

nation within a system in which power will be located
in the hands of true representatives of the peopletwho
are not only properly elected but whose mental and
emotional makeup is such that it insures their close
and continuous identification with the people.

Our Committee fears that democracy is apt to en-
counter great difficulties in the post—war Balkans unless
it has intelligent and insistent support from the demo-
cratic elements of the American population. On the
other hand, our Committee knows that, if reaction
re-establishes itself in the South-Slavic and other Bal-
kan lands, the inevitable backwash from it into the
United States will—through a certain type of American
citizen of Balkan origin—adversely affect democracy in
America. We have had ample foreshadowing of this in
the past two years, during which reactionary’ forces
within the Yugoslav government-in—exile have created
in the United States a propaganda machine employing
undemocratic, subversive methods to achieve divisive,
undemocratic ends here and in postwar Yugoslavia.

l6I

 

 

On the basis of its stated purposes and also in view
of the fact that it consists of people of South—Slavic
origin, our Committee’s special stress is on the South
Slavic and the wider Balkan problems. It believes that
no. lasting peace is attainable by the world unless the
Balkan question is intelligently solved after the war.

Our Committee will demand and continue to de-
mand that the Great Powers make it possible for the
Balkan peoples to become masters of their own coun-
tries and theireconomic and cultural life. The Balkans
must cease to be a football in international power
politics. The nations there must be allowed and should
be helped to withdraw their lands and resources from
the grasp of imperialist forces. And our Committee
wishes to emphasize that this can be done only through
democratic processes in both international relationships
and national affairs. I

We are out for dynamic unity. What do we mean by
that? Why do I emphasize the word “dynamic”?

I have said that the unity which was urged upon the
people after Pearl Harbor was necessary then. When it
ceased. to be necessary, it became a negative thing.
NegatiVism—“don’t do that, don’t do this”——still moti-
vates too many attitudes of too many of our high
oﬂicials in Washington and in some of the larger cities
who seem to want to quick-freeze the hot issues tearing
at the hearts and minds of the people.

Recently the mayor of a big city, whose population
is about 70 per cent new—immigrant, expressed himself

'-unfavorably about such organizations as the United

Committee of South—Slavic Americans, of which I
happen to be president. He went out of his way to let
me know that his city already was the scene of “serious
differences within the immigrant groups as to the ad-
justments necessary in Europe after the war,” and he
went on to say that our Committee might make that
situation even more acute—-that is, more uncomfortable
to ‘him, who has been so busy with his own political
and administrative problems that he’s had no time to

become really informed and think about the situation.‘

It has not occurred to this mayor, or to many other
busy officials, that behind the differences about post-
war Europe now stirring in the various elements of our
American population which make him so unhappy
there is at work a Very sound instinct. People are be-
ginni_ng to sense that hereafter the problems of Yugo-
slavia, Poland and France are going to affect us in
America quite as much as the developments in Ohio,
Illinois and Michigan.

Americans of various backgrounds see that this is

now One World and no one can stop it from spinning
around in its usual dynamic way; that currently, in
fact, it is especially insistent upon progress and the
enhancement of the position of the common man.

Americans generally are on the verge of realizing
that the war and the postwar period are of one piece.
The time to formulate the peace is now during the
conflict, and in a democracy it is the duty of the
people, of the indiVidual—your duty, my duty—to par-
ticipate in the resolution of issues. If we are obliged to
fight the war, we have the right and the obligation to
help work out the postwar problem.

Some of us who are interested in democratic progress
in America and abroad are suddenly realizing that we
have been too patient. By steering clear of controversial
issues in compliance with official appeals for unity we
have let undemocratic, reactionary forces here and in
the world generally get a subversive jump on us.

For eighteen months progressive, democratic, pa-
triotic Americans of South—Slavic background cooper-
ated with our official American leadership and thus
contributed to the unity which was necessary right
after Pearl Harbor. While we avoided controversial
issues, however, small reactionary or fascist oufits and

individuals in the South—Slavic element in this country‘

were busy at their secret doings. In this, let me empha-
size, they had the leadership and the ﬁnancial support
of agents of the reactionary clique dominating the
Yugoslav government—in—exile. ‘

For two years their purpose has been to break up
Yugoslavia and, with the help of Drazha Mikhailovitch
and quisling Nedich of Serbia, to create a Greater
Serbia at the expense of the Croatian, Serbian and
Slovenian peoples, and to the advantage of general
political reaction. And their divisive aims in reference
to Yugoslavia have had a, divisive effect among South-
Slavic Americans. For a while some of us tried to get
the State .Department to put a stop to this divisive
work, which was directed by Yugoslav diplomats of-
ficially accredited to and recognized by the United
States, but we got nowhere. So we, as private citizens,

- decided to form the United Committee of South—Slavic

Americans, and to repair the effects of this divisive
work is one of the things on our program, now in the
process of execution.

You might ask me: how much of the South—Slavic
element in America does our Committee represent?

It represents the progressive, democratic groups and
indiViduals—between 80 and 90 per cent of more than
a million people. The rest is reaction of one kind or

another, and for my part I don’t want to be united with
people who are for N edich and Mikhailovitch, who
think that Franco is a great and good man.

‘I feel that the real, active, working unity of 80 or 90
per cent of a group of people who want to strive for
progress here and abroad, and who are opposed to re-
action and fascism in America and abroad, is preferable
to the unreal 100 per cent “unity” which is the hoped-
for result of the suppression of issues by fear—ridden,
incompetent or ill—informed ofﬁcials. ‘

That _is what we mean by dynamic unity. We Amer-
icans of South—Slavic background recommend it to
other immigrant groups.

1 944—Crucial Year

Eaccerpts from a speech delivered at the American Slav Con-
gress Rally in Detroit, December 12, 1943:

The American Slav Congress is a unity movement-
uniting Americans of the several Slavic strains who
believe with most other Americans in the democratic

‘process here and abroad, and who want to help democ-

racy along and to ﬁght reaction and fascism in their
various forms, whether in America or in the Old
World. . i

The American Slav Congress is an American or-
ganization, an American movement, strictly and pas-
sionately in line with widely—accepted American ideals
of democracy, liberty and equality which (I cannot say
this too often) will have to be realized and practiced
elsewhere in the world—including the Balkans, includ-
ing Poland, including other European countries—in
order to insure democracy in the United States.

‘Reactionaries, including a certain Michigan con-
gressman, know this; and they are beginning to
attack the American Slav Congress, employing smear
methods developed by Goebbels.

I am grateful for the chance to speak here—particu-
larly at this time as we move into 1944, which is going
to be a crucial, a decisive year.

Let me emphasize: 1944 is going to be a decisive
year. What will happen in America and in Yugoslavia
and Poland, in eastern and western and central Europe
during ’44 is going to affect not only your lives, but the
