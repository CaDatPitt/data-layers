‘War is rich man's
game’— UMW paper

WASHINGTON (FP) -—- "War has
always been a rich man’s game by
which .the‘rich get richer and the
poor get poorer,” the Journal of the
United Mine Workers declares in its

’ current issue.

«In an editorial commenting on the
refusal of General Motors voluntarily
to cut back prices on its 1951 models
the Journal says it “blasted all the
political bla-bla of successful volun-
tary price conrtols fed the public by
President Truman and his new ap-
pointees to administer regimentation
policies and hold profiteering to a
minimum.”

There is nothing new in that st.ate-
ment, the editorial says, but it best

, epitomizes what is going to happen‘

to the common people because of
war.

“So, despite all the Washington
official communiques and press-
agented razzle-dazzle on economics
and politics, highly seasoned with
European aid and excuses for Asiatic
blunders, the fundamental’ fact re-
mains that the employed common
folks_in mine, mill and factory, hired
hands on the farms, white-collar
clerks and fixed income pensioners
are going to suffer the full degrading
consequences of inflation and in the
years to come pay the toll of arma-
ment and war.”

"'~-.1/against Mine-Mill at Trail. The Coun-

cil ordered its officers to carry its
message of protest to John Gates, pro-
vincial labor minister.

President J-ack Stevenson nnd sec-
retary R. K. Gervin were told to meet
Gates and inform him that the Trades
& Labor Council believes no union

wgshould be certified as bargaining agent
‘uhféss it; first collects money for dues

or initiation.

Gervin told delegates that the Steel
raiders had based their Trail applica-
tion on signed cards, but had collected
nodues or initiation. The Steelwork-
ers’ bid was turned down by the
Labor Relations Board, but Gervin
warned that if such methods are ever

, recognized, it would mean any group

could “move in” on a legitimate union

 .. simply by having workers sign cards. .

‘A LOOK SENDS A CHILL UP THE SPINE’

I GE's Wilson gets ‘dictator’

By John B. Stone
Federated Press

When Charles Edward Wilson, president of General Electric made a
recent appearance before a National Press Club luncheon he was in-
troduced as a man who came up the hard way, who had to learn the tech-

nique of brass kunckles and_ knives.

The Washington representative of a large electrical union sitting next
this correspondent remarked, “And he's never forgotten how to use them.”

Wilson is a master of public rela-
tions as well as mass production.
That’s how he has succeeded in creat-
ing a myth of Wilson progressive
liberalism while the General Electric

Co. blandly went about its shabby .

business at home and abroad.

Because -of this myth there probably
wasn’t In u ch public consternation
when President Truman named Wilson
to the dictatorship of the Office of
Defense Mobilization.

The word “dictatorship” is used
advisedly. The executive order estab-
lishing ODM gives Wilson power to
control all mobilization activities of
the government including, but not
limited to, production procurement,
manpower, stabilization and transport
activities.

When asked to take the j’ b, Wilson
refused unless: (I) he were made sole
director with no deputies or top assist-
ants, (2) no one should stand between
him and the President. Truman met
his terms.

So Wilson will be sole arbiter of
the hours men work, the wages they
are paid, the profits war-producers
make, the livin-g conditions of almost
the entire nation so long as the na-
tional emergency lasts.

A LOOK BEHIND THE MYTH of
Wilson’s progressive liberalism sends
a chill up the spine of anyone inter-
ested in fair play for labor, a break
for the consumer, decent relations
between the few who make billions
out of war production and the many
whose living-standards are reduced by
War production.

Wilson became president of General
Electric January 1, 1940, upon the
retirement of Gerard Swope. But for
years he had been the real power in
the company.

And.what is General Electric? Un-
der, President _Roosevelt, Justice De-
partment investigators found that Gen-

- eral Electric was one of the biggest
of the industrial absolutists creating.

the ever more dangerous concentration
of productive capacity into the hands
ofa few New York bankers. ..

General Electric was indicted for
conspiracy in restraint of ‘trade by
grabbing a stranglehold on the, pro-

duction of electric lamps, dictating to ‘

other producers that lamps should be
made so poorly that they would burn

 

N

Picks General Clay

WASHINGTON —— First action
by GE’s Charles Wilson after he
arrived here to take over as
Defense Mobilization director
was to appoint Gen. Lucius Clay
as his special assistant.

“7

As commander of U.S. forces
in Germany, Clay won world
prominence for his action par-
doning Ilse Koch, the “beast of
Buchenwald,” and halting the
denazification program. Clay
was responsible for returning
hundreds of prominent Nazis to
key positions in German corpo-
rations and blocking the drive to ,
break up German cartels.

Since his return from Ger-
, many, Clay has been chairman
of the board of the big Conti-
nental Can Co.

out fast, running competitors out of

A . business.

It is one of the mysteries -of U. S.
Government, that the head of the com-
pany so indicted should be made a
boss of the government. Just before
he accepted his new post, the case
against Wilson’s company was dropped
in Federal court “because of the war
emergency.”

But there was an uglier case against
General Electric which was no t
quashed. It was convicted of conspir-
ing with Germany’s Krupp industries
to restrict the use of hard metals. No
one can say how many American
lives that cost in World War II.

And there is the little matter of
labor relations. GE’s record is long.
It is symbolized in the vicious 50-day
battle of 1946 when the United Elec-
trical Radio & Machine Workers final-
ly won an 181/zc raise out of Wilson’s
company.

Mounted police in Philadelphia rode
down women and children during that
battle.'Said Wilson, “ They used force
against union rioters to protect them-
selves.”

, The fumbling of the Truman ad-
ministration . o v e r “anti-inflation"
measures, and the presence of “labor”
members 0 n t h e Wage Stabilization
Board do not conceal the fact that the

p whole program is of, by and for big‘
‘business. 5

When “labor” representatives call
for increased taxes, decrease in gov-

ernmen-t spending for non-military
purposes, increased savings, and wage
‘ control —— when they sign their names

-to a statement that “The stabilization
of wages, salaries and other compen-
sations will not by itself attack" infla-
tion at its source but will merely con-.
ceal ‘and defer its effects while per-
mitting a ‘pressure of hidden spending

‘power to build up” —- they are not

representing labor; they are selling
out the intereasts of the people they
supposedly represent. ' _

The fact that there are frictions
among sections of big business, as in-
dicated by the temporary revolt of

‘General Motors, does not change the

fact that .the program is designed to

freeze the outrageous profits and the

shrunken living_ standards of the pres-
ent moment. .

The Wage Stabilisation Board, with
President Emil Rieve of the Textile
“representing” the 010,

the Board said, “more output-per hour,

-working more hours _a week.” The

Board’: recommendation of less
spending “for non-military purposes”
is a service to the reactionaries who
have beenfighting, ever since the first
term of President Franklin Roosevelt,
to cut down all federal spending for
social services, such as the minor "sums
now used for acid ‘to education,

housing, hospitals and old age assist-

NEW YORK*(FP)-—In a letter to -

.CIO Pres. Philip Murray Dec, z1_

that all differences’ in labor’: ranks
be subordinated to a united effort to

to bring about ‘world peace.” This
conference, he suggested, could then
“hitiatc "a similar meeting of the

" The shocking fact that CIO‘s mem-
O-bership has declined to only 3,300,000
during the past year is revealed in a
partial financial statement published
I in the December 18 issue of CIO News.

_ .;'l‘he'figure is only a bit more than
i half as -high as the 6,000,000 members
claimed by CIO president Philip Mur-
,-; ray in a press conference during the
;_Chicago CIO convention.

‘ It compares with 3,700,000 members
i in C10 for the year ending September
f 30, 1949, just before the “expulsion
fever” gripped top CIO leaders and
» caused the ouster of 11 international
I 1' unions, including Mine-Mill.
 _ -‘The per capita figures in the _CIO
 H -%;financial statement also give the lie to
”  Mun-ay’s boastful claim that “most”
of the members of expelled unions
have been “absorbed” back into C10.

The report also shows a decline in
C10 reserves, because $425,000 more
iwas -spent than was collected. A figure
_ ' of $1,382,000 is“ given for “salaries,
0 ‘jtravel expense, and subsidies for na-
tional unions -and organizing commit-
tees,” most of .which was spent on
, raiding activities during 1950, observ-

~)}\‘-has.‘\_§ZQI‘k€d out a new plan, a plan

‘_ F. W. ImMasche, deputy director of
,  . the Agricult-ure Department’s live-
if ’ — sto-ck branch,. claims that meat is be-

buying habits have changed, and there
 V is a greater demand for smaller cuts.
 -That, at least, was the explanation he

ImMasche said that the re—grading
means that small cuts of commercial
beef .are now to be labeled “g00d,”
and “good’-’ grades are to be called
“choice,” while “choice” grades will
be ‘labeled “prime.”

It’s a brand—new way of cheating

Brasshdts in CIO are always hap-
piest when they are boasting about
their “patriotism.” Yet a sto in
a recent edition of the CIO e-ws
showed that some of them consider
Huey Long's birthday a more im-
portant “holiday" than the Fourth
of July! _ ,

The story told how Local 948,
CIO Textile Workers, won a long
strike against the Federal Fiber
Mills in New Orleans with only one
strike demand lost. And the CIO
adds with straight face:

“Only unsuccessful angle: while
the contract provides seven paid
holidays, the union was iyisuccess-.
ful in its fight to get the employer
to substitute Huey Long’s birthday
for Independence Day.”

Expose FBI

Three days before Christmas, Con-
gress passed and sent to the President
a bill empowering FBI" agents to make
arrests without warrants in cases in-
volving “espionage, ‘sabotage or other
major crimes.”

‘Passage of the bill, which meant
that one of the key civil rights of all
Americans was being shelved, was

- hardly noticed by the daily papers.

In approving the bill, Congress ig-V
nored evidence offered in a new book
to prove that attacking labor has been
and is becoming even more the main
business" of the FBI.

Author of the book, “The Federal
Bureau of Investigation,” knows what
he is talking about. He is Max Lowen-
thal, who acted as chairman of the Na-
tional Commission on Law Observance
and Enforcement under President Her-
bert Hoover, who ha-s been counsel for
a number of Senate Committees, and
who is known as a personal friend of-
President Truman.

PUBLICATION of the book caused
an uproar in Washington. It is no
secret that the FBI has become so
powerful that even top government
officialsare afraid of it.‘ '

Lowenthal believes that for the first
time in U.S. history, we have a secret
police setup — the FBI -— which is a
real threat to our entire democracy.
It is a federal agency which has grown
enormously in size and power in the
last 15 years.

Last fall, the Justice Department
asked ‘Congress for‘ funds to permit
arrest of more than 12,0-00 citizens and
'to double the national prison facilities
to hold them. J ustice-departrrient offi-
cials said only “Communists” would be
victims. But Lowenthal points out that

Hoover, when 10,000 were locked up
immediately after World War I. The
courts ruled later that these arrests
were “lawlessness .. . . by our sup-
posedly law-enforcing officials.” U.S.
Senator Walsh described the activities
of the FBI in those raids as “the law-
less acts of a mob.”

Now Lowenthal believes we are
due for a repeat performance by the
FBI — with even greater “lawless-
ness.” A federal judge recently had
the courage to overrule a guilty ver-
dict because he found that the FBI
had violated a law by tapping a de-
fendant’s wires. The FBI had destroy-

If President Truman signs the
bill emp-owering FBI agents to
make arrests without warrants,
he will be destroying a rule of
law, among others, which Mine-
Mill helped to bring about.

This resulted from a Supreme
Court decision in 1943, growing
out of our “Ducktown case” —— ’
a frameup of Mine-Mill strikers
accused of ‘destroying federal
property. In reversing convic-
tion of our members, the high
l court ruled that “confessions”
obtained by FBI agents were in-
valid because civil rights of_ the
accused had been violated. The
men had been held ,in jail for
days without being booked, and
had been denied the right to
obtain counsel. ’ '

ACCORDING TO LOWENTI-IAL‘, a

Open McCarran act repealdrive

CHICAGO (FP)~--Formation of a
national committee to repeal the
“shameful” lVlcCarran law was an-
nounced here by 32 prominent Ameri-
cans, including two Nobel Prize win-
ners, six bishops and outstanding
vlabor leaders, educators and scient-
ists.

, Among the initiators of the com-.
mittee, which has already been joined

by over 1,000 persons from every
state in the nation, are Nobel Prize
winners Emily Greene Balch and
Thomas Mann; Secretary-Treasurer
rank Rosenblum of» the Amalga-

1‘ *-lﬁllmated Clothing Workers (CIO); F nk

Aydelotte. Institute of A Advanced
University;
Methodist Bishop James C. Baker and
Bishop W. J. Walls of the A.M.E. Zion

Church; and Pierre van Paassen, Uni-

tarian clergyman and author.

Committee spokesmen John B.

Vw. Thompson, dean of Rockefeller Me-

morial Chapel, University of Chicago,

,',___.. —~ and Robert Morss Lovett, former act-

_. ’or of "the Virgin Islands,
said the"-committege grew out of the
appeal of more than 1,900 leading
Americans to President Truman and
Congress for defeat of the McCarran
bill last fall and out of countless let-
ters since its passage urging them to

, lead a movement for repeal.

“The hysteria and intimidation the
law has evoked in the two -months

'« ‘since its passage,” Thompson and

Lovett said, “ha.ve strengthened the
opposition of those who were against
its passage and have opened the eyes
of many who were not fully aware of
the dangers of such repressive legis-
‘lotion.

“The present situation holds three

 hopeful prospects,” they added.

“First is the repeal measure intro-
duced by Rep. Adolph Sabath (D,
1ll.). We shall launch a campaign on
Congress for full support of this meas-
ure. Second, we hail the recent ac-
tions of important national organiza-
tions in favor of repeal, the national
convention of the CIO; the American
-Federationist, official organ of the
AFL; the League of United Synago-
gues; the American Civil Liberties
Union, and many others.”

These actions, plus the response to
the committee, “encourage us to be-
lieve that this shameful law can be
erased from the books by demand of
the American people,” they said.

“Finally, our faith in the uncon-
stitutionality of the act is confirmed
by the recent Supreme Court deci-

’ sion in the case of Blau vs. the U. S.,
which‘ proves that the registration
provisions of the M Carran law can-
hot be enforced. e are convinced
that the American people realize that
the preservation of the Bill of Rights
is their responsibility and that they
will therefore join with us in de-
manding the repeal of this infamous

  ‘ act.”

Zl/IcCarran_ law czar

is lobbyist for Chile

WASHINGTON——Set'h Richardson, chairman of the McCar-
ran Act Subversive Activities Control Board, knows that 100 Nazi
and Fascist groups have sprung up in the U. S. since World War
II»—but apparently he’s not interested.

Appearing before a House subcommittee to plead for $250,-
000 for the board, Richardson said the list of 130 so-called sub-
versive organizations given him by the attorney general would
be the basis of the board’s operations.

“Now,” Richardson said, “they are still existing in the U. S.”

“The whole 130?” asked Rep. Albert Thomas (D, Tex.).

“Yes,” Richardson replied. “The whole 130 are still existing
and there are about 100 more that have grown up after, the last
war—-that is Nazi and Fascists and special groups-'—but that is not
the group I am talking about.”

Meantime, reporters checking Congressional records found
that Richardson is a registered lobbyist for the labor—hating gov-

Through his law firm, Richardson is also registered as a for-’

Expose ‘red smear’
used by Steel union

MAGNA, Utah——-The use of the 

“red smear” by the CIO Steelworkers
Union in its frenzied attempt to win
over the Kennecott refinery workers
here has been effectively exposed by
a carefully documented four- page
folder issued by Mine—Mill.

The main basis for the Steel Union’s  

re-d smear is “Report 1311,” originally

issued by the House Committee on un- . V

American Activities. But the Steel
propaganda contained only a small
part of the House Committce’s report.

The Mine-Mill document discloses

that “Report 1311” contains a "red
smear” against dozens of top CIO

' officials closely associated with Philip
Murray in the top leadership of CIO . .

-—including more than 40 officials and

representatives of the Steelworkers 

Union!

But—-the Mine-Mill pamphlet points '

out-——the point in listing names from
the Smear records not to carry on

the vicious slanders startedlby the un- ‘
American Committee, nor to carry on 

the anti-labor smear campaign That
has become CIO-Steel’s trademark. ’

“ Report 1311” only proves that you
can find “evidence” to smear anyone
you want to smear, if that’s what you
are interested in doing, it adds. And
it proves that every leader or organ-
izer who helped build CIO during the

‘past 15 years can be found on the

anti—l-abor “red list” of the un—Ameri-‘

can Committee, along with every pro- ' ,
gressive, pro—la-bor organization the ' 0'

employers wanted to smear.
The Mine-Mill folder reminds Ken-

necott workers that “the 1948 CIO :

convention was right when it said:

A ‘The infamous Thomas-Rankin House
un- American Activities Committee '_ C. . .-
continues to slander minority groups, ’ ' "  
and engage i-n witch-hunts in order to V 
stir up hysteria,  use its authority 

for anti-labor purposes, and to func-_

tion as a kangaroo court’.”

Billion dollar loophole

peiclause for industry from the excess profits tax law it is expected to

.. The giant loophole was revealed December 18 by the Wall Street
ournal,‘ which reported: “Uncle Sam is passing out a special brand of

zfaxs-relief, that can soften the shock of any new excess profits tax on

1 . _ .
many companies.” ,

’._l'he~Jgim.mick was approved by Con-
ressl in the last revenue act in a sec-
on‘ on special amortization. The sec-
irauthorized a company to deduct
¢--cost of new plants and machinery

 its taxable income over a 5-year

Under this setup a company can re-
 its taxableincome each year by
020% of _the cost of its new property,
.111 contrast to regular peacetime PTO-
"cedure when a large company deducts
Qnly_4% or 5% of investment cost
"ea"c,h year. -

Industry can take advantage of this
“tax relief” to the tune of well over
}a billion dollars a year, the Wall

«Street Journal reported. This is about .

one-third of the three billion dollar
‘expected to be raised by the excess
“profits tax already passed by the

 CIO proposals. The AFL called

 To- qualify for the big amortization
Tdeduction all a company needs is a

V7-"‘certificate -of necessity” from the
 government stating that the facilities .
 are needed for defense. The Wall

kts would not have much trouble ‘in

It pointed out that the Natl. Sec-

now has been the responsible agency,
has already issued certificates for

Rail strike seiilemem‘

WASHINGTON (FP) — Settlement
of the 22-month dispute between op-

erating brotherhoods and the nation’s -

railroads was announced at the White
House after an overnight conference

‘- which lasted 15 hours.

The agreement included two points
new in railroad labor relations, a

> three-year contract. and an escalator

clause calling for one cent an hour
wage increases every time the Bureau
of Labor Statistics cost of living in-
dex- goes up one point.

Workers are granted wage increases
ran ing from 10c an hour to 27c, in
ad‘. ition to 'the—cost of living arrange-
ment. The 40-hour week “in princi-
ple” is agreed to for yard employees
but in return for the wage increases

the International Brotherhood of Rail- -

road Trainmen-agreed to postpone en-
forcement of the principle until after
the present national state of emer-
gency. It will be discussed at a con-
ference after Jan. 1, 1952.

About 300,000 operating employées
are affected by the settlement. More
than 120,000 yardmen, members of_the

trainmen’s brotherhood, get at 25c an 0

hour wage increase retroactive to Oct.
1, the date of the proposed contract._

WASHINGTON (FP) —— The Coast
Guard Dec. 27 clamped absolute con-
trols on port facilities, all ships, and
- - docks, and personnel which work in
or on them. ‘ ~

The Coast Guard held hearings in
Washington Nov. 27 and 28. During
 those sessions Hoyt Haddock, Wash-
‘ ington representative of the C10 Mari-
_ time Committee who had been among
 the leaders who agred wholly with
 it the former voluntary program, walked
' out of the session in anger at high
handed Coast Guard methods.

-5,  “The CIO Maritime Committee can-

 .8“ not go along with any program which

{ . gives the Coast Guard final say on

 /ﬁll.-}3ersoiinel,” he said. M

' IT WAS REPORTED here that the
Coast Guard acted to prevent a
threatened strike of West Coast long-
shoremen and cooks and stewards
but the Coast Guard denied this.

Representatives of the ILMU said,

federal fiats in barring all members

zations,” but it goes much farther.

Los Angeles tenants

. L- ..-e-sally rent strike

LOS ANGELES (FP)——-Leaders of

' this city’s militantly organized ten-

ants have called on rent payers to

strike rather than pay newly demand-

ed increases amounting in many cases
to several hundred percent.

. The call was issued by Maxwell
Miller, head of the Los Angeles Ten-
ants Council, whose attorneys’ have
successfully managed for five months
to keep a City C o u n e il decontrol
resolution of July 28 from going into
‘ " effect.

.V_"',‘

I .- . .
' '*".".%'.-"t~v"""' "?'“.V7'-‘-"av --v
_n  A

The attorneys, headed by promi-
nent labor lawyer» Alexander Schull-
man, contended in Washington, D.C.,
courts that decontrol here was illegal
because it was legislated by resolution
rather than the ordinance they said
the federal rent law requires. They
were upheld by the U.S. court of ap-
peals. Counsel for the city, which has
sided with the landlords, appealed the
ruling to the U.S. Supreme Court,
which will decide January 2 whether
it will review the case.

Meanwhile President Truman sign-
ed an extension of federal rent control
to March 31, including a rider tacked
‘on by Sen. Harry Cain (R, Wash.).
The rider legalized prior community
decontrol votes, whether by resolution

_ « or ordinance.

., ,  T§”?According to Miller, that is a retro-

 active law and therefore unconstitu-

tional. He further argued that the

s law is illegal as far as Los Angeles is

concerned because the circuit court
ruling to that effect still stands.

Coast Guard port controls
peril maritimeunion rights

authorize the belief that the presence
of the person aboard vessels of the
U.S. would be inimical to the secur-
ity of the U.S.”

Union spokesmen pointed out that
a seaman who is barred from work-
ing on a ship on the grounds that
“his presence would be inimical to
the security of the U.S.” may buy a
ticket and sail on the same ship as a
passenger. This proves that the
“screening” is really intended to
screen out militant unionists, they
contend.

A THREE ASPECTS of the order in
addition to the broad power given the
Coast Guard were causing concern
among Washington labor leaders.

1. An appeals board is set up but
it is drawn from a panel prepared by
Labor Sec. Tobin and its findings
are only recommendations. The Coast
Guard remains the final authority.

2. Longshoremen and others must
be sponsored by their local labor
chiefs. This, is feared, will encourage
the practice of shaking down mem-
bers for being selected like the meth-
ods used in the old shape up.

3. The Coast Gurad has said it will
clear only enough men to do the work
necessary at given ports. This would

wreck the union hiring hall setup ,

and rotary assignment of jobs.

ALTHOUGH THE MEMBERS of

‘Haywood‘.s union and working people

in general won a great victory in the
acquittal. the employers behind the
frameup had gained part of what they
intended. .

-‘During the forced" absence of the
three men who had been chosen by
the membership to guide their union,
the leadership fell into less courageous
hands. Intimidatedby the Idaho frame-
up, the interim leaders were more in-
terested in being “respectable” than
in making the hard day-.to—day fight
for betterment of wages and condi-
tions. t .

When Haywood returned from pri-
son and an extended speaking tour,
more than a year and a half had

elapsed. Finding himself unable -to’

win support for his policy of continued

militant struggle, - Haywood resigned.-
Whether or not this was a mistake,-

the fact re_mains“that union policy and

direction had been affected by the.

e_mployer-inspired fraineup, by. re-
moval of the union’s elected leaders.
