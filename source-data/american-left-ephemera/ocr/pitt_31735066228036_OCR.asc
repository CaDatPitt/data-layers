\ , Fellow-Americans :

Your constitutional rights, your security and Wel-
fare, have been placed in mortal danger by decisions
of a one-vote majority in the Supreme Court in two
so—called anti-Communist cases on June 5, 1961.

By a 5 to 4 vote (including Justice Tom Clark,
who should have disqualiﬁed himself as the Attorney
General who ﬁrst indicted Communist leaders in

1948 under the Smith Act) the Court has now im-

I perilled the rights of all. Americans.

For the ﬁrst time in America’s history, voluntary
associations are made subject to licensing by the
Federal government, and activity on behalf of a legal
political party is to be treated as a crime. This is the
meaning of the registration requirements of the
McCarran Act of“ 1950 and the membership clause of
the Smith Act of 1940, both of which were upheld
by the Supreme Court majority.

As a result: .

0 The Communist Party of the U.S.A. is ordered

“to register as an “action organization” described in

the law as an agent of a foreign power promoting a

lﬁconspiracy based on espionage,_ sabotage, terrorism
and other heinous crimes. As such it is required to
list publicly its officers and members.

0 Persons described as “active” Communists can
be jailed on testimony it was their “intent” to bring
about the forcible overthrow of the government.

Under the McCarran Act a body of appointed
government ofﬁcials, the Subversive Activities Con-

may not voluntarily associate themselves in any or-
ganization. The Board may decide this, moreover, *
purely on the basis of the legislative “ﬁndings” of
guilt in the Act itself. The accused is denied the right/
to trial. ’ , . 5

to attach the false designation of “action organiza-

AN ELASTIC LABEL

In Hitler Germany a special group, the Jews, wer
singled out and compelled to Wear a yellow arr
band with the Star of David. In the U.S. today-——uI
less the McCarran and Smith Acts are nulliﬁed;
organizations which refuse to conform to the vie‘!
of the powers-that—be are likewise to be compell
to bear a government-designed brand. - , 

Under the labelling provision of the McCarra1
Act even the Declaration of Independence or the
Bible——if distributedby a group branded by the ,
S.A.C.B. as a “Communist action” organization——'"
would be required to bear on their covers a label.

Any group can under the McCarran Act be de-
signated as a “Communist front” organization and
be forced to register and suffer similar sanctions if.
it merely took a position which the SACB regarded.’
as paralleling a position of the Communist Party.

Nor is organized labor immune. More than “once,_!
unions have been branded by courts as conspiracies
seeking illegal ends. Today they are shackled by the
Taft-Hartley and Landrum-Grifﬁn Acts which sub-
ject them to close government control. From here
it is not a long step to their inclusion in a “Commu-
nist front” dragnet. ,-

THE BIG LIES

 The Court majority’s disregard of traditional
zonstitutional rights rests basically on two stale
[*raud_ulent_ arguments: that the Communists are for-
.-eign agents and that they advocate the forceful over-
 throw of our government.

‘The “foreign agent” canard has been used by
i,r.eaction throughout our history to divide popular
,-movements and discredit dissenters. Thomas J effer-
gwson and his followers were labelled “Jacobins,”

agents of the French Revolution. Sen. Robert LaFol-
‘itte and other loyal Americans were assailed as
pro-German” because they opposed our entrance
nto World War I. And have not our Catholic fellow-
rnericans, in and out of public life, been slanderous-

Vhounded as loyal to 'a foreign power, the Vatican?

A Yet the truth is tha.t in the entire 42-year history
of the Communist Party not a single member has
been convicted or even indicted as a foreign agent
ﬁr for engaging in sabotage or treason. Nor has a
ingle member ever been convicted of an act of force
lirected against our government.
‘ C To disregard cherished democratic American
fights in the name of “fighting communism” can only
lisgrace our nation. It places us in the company of
fascist nations like Spain and Portugal and military
dictatorships like the Dominican Republic and South
.Korea, and of the neo-Nazi dominated West Ger-
)' many. Only such undemocratic countries resort to
' extraordinary laws banning the Communist Parties.
L Signiﬁcantly, in those countries where McCarthyite

1 type reaction does not rule—England, France, Hol-'

land, Sweden, Belgium, Italy, etc.——Communists
. have normal legal rights as part of the political
‘sgcomamunity. Indeed, Communist Parties today exist
as entirely legal oorganizations in scores of coun-
l_tries throughout the world.

TRUMAN’S VETO
The McCarran Act was jammed through Con-

’ gress on September 30, 1950 in the Korean War hys-
~. teria over the veto of President Truman. In his veto

. message President Truman warned:

“. . .vthese (registration) provisions are
not merely ineffective anl unworkable. They
represent a clear and present danger to our
institutions.”

LA RE AT 3 TAKE...

_ These words were not heeded, and the Act, with
its fantastic registration provisions which wouIr.‘._
require the Party’s oﬁicers to be informers for a
police dragnet, was passed. But this cannot and will
not happen. There will be no betrayal of the con-
ﬁdence of a single member or supporter of the party
or any organization or trade union.

The Communist Party will defend its right to a
legal existence .under the Constitution and the Bill
of Rights as a legitimate current in American polit-
ical life, a movement that can trace its existence back
a full century into our history, from the Communists
who supported Lincoln and the Union through the
old Socialist Party. The Communist Party has taken
legal steps to request a re—hearing by the Supreme
Court and will exhaust every resource to halt the
oppression of these iniquitous laws and their dire
consequences for the liberties of all Americans.

At the same time the Communist Party will place
its case before the highest court of all, the bar of
public opinion. For we have profound conﬁdence in
the great democratic traditions of our land and are
fully convinced that the Court’s 5-4 decisions of June
5 will yet be reversed by a popular majority.

We recall that a Supreme Court majority once

u

','=._'_;_,,7:‘  “‘_:__:“" Vi 3-L;-’;' '.

held in the Dred Scott case that a Negro had no
rights that a white man was bound to 'respect—and
that this decision was swept -away and that the 13th,
14th and 15th Amendments were added to our Con-
stitution. We recall that another court in the in-
famous Plessy v.'Ferguson decision decreed the per-
nicious “separate but equal” doctrine of segregation
—and that this, too, was later swept away. And we
recall that in President Roosevelt’s time a reaction-
ary majority decreed against New Deal laws-only
to be swept aside by the popular will.

ALL MUST ACT

We have a profound conﬁdence in the ‘American
people. We are proud of those in the American tra-
dition—Abolitionists, trade unionists, liberals, Ne-

. gro leaders-—who contributed so much to the demo-

cratic struggle and never ﬂinched before threats of
prosecution, "jail or terror. Today’s Freedom Riders
are in that great tradition.

Sharing that heritage, we Communists face the
future calmly. Neither the Palmer Raids of the
World War I period nor the persecutions of the
McCarthy era succeeded in destroying the Commu-
nist movement. Nowhere in the world has fascism,
terror or repression accomplished thatpaim. The
Communist Party of the U.S.A. will survive and the
struggle for peace, security, democracy and a so-

cialist order ending the exploitation of man by man
will survive-—and grow. .

It is not for ourselves alone that we speak. For
we know full well that reactionary laws like the
McCarran -and Smith Acts have an evil purpose and
a relentless logic and that in nation after nation
the destruction of the democratic rights of all began

with the attack “only” on the Communists. Inevitablyrl

the assault spread and sought to destroy all who
stood for peace, economic security and democratic
ri'ghts——the trade unions, the Socialists, the Jews,’
the liberals.

That is why we say to all our fellow-Americans,
irrespective of political faith: The bell tolls not for
the Communists alone but for the hard-won rights
of all Americans. All must act together tosave‘
American constitutional liberties. I

Speak up! Speak up today as an individual or 

through your organization.
Let the President, the Attorney General and the

Congress know that America wants an end to these I

fascist-lgike laws. America does not want to go down
the road to concentration camps and a garrison state.
Americans want to maintain their constitutional
rights to proceed in their own way towards their own
new frontiers through the political parties and vol-

untary organizations of their own free choice. -.,
