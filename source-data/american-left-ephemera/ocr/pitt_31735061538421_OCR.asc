in the North. But the women textile workers in the South
receive lower wages than the Southern men workers in that
industry. The Negro women workers in the textile industry
in the South receive even lower wages than do their South-
ern white sisters. This is in accord with the provisions of
the Code administration.

With another war on our heels, with competition among
the capitalists increasing, employers ﬁght more doggedly to
hold on to this source of cheap labor power. Lower pay for
women is a way of keeping wages low for all workers. To
keep working women in this double servitude, the false ideas
about women’s inferiority must be maintained. The inequal-
ity of women is legalized. This weaker economic position
of women is used to deprive them of equal rights and often
to humiliate them.

Motherhood of working-class women remains unprotected
under a capitalist society. Frequently the working mother
must hide her pregnancy (ofttimes to the point of deform-
ing herself). In the U.S.A. there is no maternity insurance
as provided for in the Workers’ Unemployment and Social
Insurance Bill, HR. 2827. Therefore the working mother is
forced to Work until the last day, knowing that child-birth
most likely means loss of her job, her earnings. In the
U.S.A., under the vicious anti-birth-control laws, working
women are not permitted the liberty to determine the size
of their families. Particularly the unemployed women, who
cannot pay the bootleg-racketeer prices for birth-control in-
formation, are forced to bear many children who upon their
very birth are doomed to inequality.

Millions of women are harnessed to the drudgery of the
narrow life in the household. In many cases they are not
released from this monotonous toil at home even when they

are driven into the factories, mills, oﬂices.

uni". .

Thus we see that there is a close connection between the
social and human position of women and the system of
private property, whose very existence pre-supposes squeez~
ing proﬁts out of those who work; a condition where women
are kept in a humiliating position, without full rights, with-
out equality.

To win complete equality with men in practice, in the
family, in the State, in society, Women must become active
together with the entire working class in the struggle to
change the present social system, the capitalist system of
society, based on exploitation of one human being by an-
other, to a socialist system of society, where all exploita-
tion and oppression is eliminated and production is carried
on for the beneﬁt of the producers. This change can be
secured only under a workers’ and farmers’ government, a
Soviet form of government.

The “aim of Socialism”, wrote Lenin, “in the whole world,

is to ﬁght exploitation of one human being by another”.

In reply to the accusations that there is no democracy in
the Soviet Union, Lenin replied: '

“We see equality declared in all the democratic republics,
but in the civil laws and the laws dealing with women and
her position in the family, in the question of divorce, in every
step we observe inequality and degradation for women. And
we declare that this is violation of democracy, particularly with
regard to the oppressed. The Soviet Power more than any other
of the most advanced countries, has realized democracy by the
very fact that not a single trace of inequality for women was left
in its laws.

“For the complete emancipation of women and for their real
equality with men, it is necessary to establish social economy
and the participation of women in general productive labor.
Only then will the women occupy the same place as the man.

“It is understood that when we talk of equality for women in
productive labor, in extent of labor, its duration, conditions, etc.,

11

we mean that the woman should not be oppressed in her economic
position in comparison with the man. You all know that even
in conditions of complete equality, there still remains the real
oppression of woman, because she carries the whole burden of
the household.

“ . . . such work, petty in itself, cannot help the development
of women.”

Complete Equality in the Soviet Union

In the 14 years since Lenin made these true statements,
the position of women in the Soviet Union has advanced by
leaps and bounds. (The pamphlet Women in the Soviet
Union by F. Nurina tells the story of women’s freedom in
the Soviet Union.)

Communist Parties in all countries, including the Com-
munist Party in the U.S.A., are working to mobilize the
masses of women for the program of the Communist Inter-
national which. includes:

Complete equality between men and women before the
law and in social life; a radical reform of marital and
family laws; recognition of maternity as a social function;
protection of mothers and infants. Initiation of social care
and upbringing of infants and children. Creches, kinder-
gartens, children’s homes, etc.).

The establishment of institutions that will gradually re-
lieve the burden of house drudgery (public kitchens and
laundries); and systematic cultural struggle against the
ideology and traditions of female bondage.

This program of the Communist International is based
on Lenin’s teachings, especially when he said:

‘‘We hate, yes, hate, everything, and will abolish everything
which tortures and oppresses the woman worker, the housewife,
the peasant woman, the wife of the petty trader, yes, and in many
cases the women of the possessing classes.”

What Can We Do

The Communist Party warns the masses of women in the
U.S.A. that the road to women’s freedom suggested by the
Socialist Party is a false one. The slanderous propaganda
conducted against the Soviet Union, the fairy tales about
the militarization of children in the Soviet Union, are an
attempt to turn the hate of the masses of the women for
imperialist war and fascism into a hate against the Soviet
Union; it means an attempt to turn the masses of women
away from the path of struggle for complete equality, for
freedom. The Socialist Party, over a period of years,
preached the “peaceful” way to achieve freedom to the
workers in Germany—and see how the shackles of degrada-
tion have been tightened around the millions of women in
fascist Germany.

Even suffrage rights for women in the U.S.A. were won
only by the most determined struggle and only when work-
ing women had fought through a number of great strikes
for better economic conditions.

The development of special forms and methods to fit in
with the special position of women, which will facilitate the
struggle for immediate improvement of the conditions of
the masses of women, is needed in the ﬁght for complete
equality and freedom.

Women’s committees in the trade unions and special
women’s meetings called by the trade unions are essential
to give proper attention to special women’s problems; the
special women’s meetings will develop the initiative and
activity of Women inside the trade union; they will become
better organizers and pioneers for the organizing of the
masses of working women into the trade unions. Women’s
trade union auxiliaries—comprising the women relatives

and friends of the men workers—are a powerful aid to the
workers in their struggles for better conditions and a means
of mobilizing women in the ﬁght against the high cost of
living, sales taxes, and against war and fascism.

These special forms and methods should be only as an

auxiliary means to the general forms already adopted by
the entire working class to improve its daily life. The de-
mand of equal pay for equal work for women as part of
workers’ demands in their strike struggles is necessary, not
only to improve the conditions of women workers, but to
ward oﬁ’ attacks upon the wages of all workers. This should
be a demand primarily in strike struggles, but activities
should be organized, especially of women, to enforce. legis-
lation for equal pay.

Abolition of the anti-birth~control laws; establishment
of free day nurseries for Working mothers; establishment
of free birth-control clinics; enactment of legislation for
maternity insurance (the support of H.R. 2827 which is the
only Bill providing maternity insurance) ; other such legis-
lative enactment that would make up a Mothers’ Bill of
Rights, can only be obtained by women if they band to-
gether and organize various activities for the realization of
same.

The Workers’ Unemployment and Social Insurance Bill
(H. R. 2827), the only Bill which provides for immediate
payment of unemployment insurance, can become law only
if workers, including women, increase mass pressure for its
enactment.

The abolition of laws discriminating against Women, the
extension of existing rights for women, can be obtained only
by following the example set by those really very courageous
women who so valiantly fought for the right of suffrage

for women in the U.S.A. Various bills for laws that would
improve the status of women generally “die in committee”.
Organized action in the form of demonstrations, strikes,
visits of delegations to the various government bodies, etc.,
by the masses of women directly affected by these discrim-
inatcry laws, is the only way to force favorable results.

Victories become fruitless, unless women beneﬁt by them.
That is why it is necessary for white women to ﬁght for the
same equal rights for Negro women as white women, to
support the activities of Negro women for liberation.

Various forms of action against war and fascism by
women are essential to ﬁght against threatening slaughter
of mankind.

To make known to broad masses of women the position of
the women in the Soviet Union, their complete equality
with men, the almost complete eradication of the old ideas
about the inferiority of women, that this is all taking place
under the Soviet form of government, is also part of the
ﬁght for freedom on the part of the women in the USA.

All the activities as mentioned above, by masses of women,
are links in the chain of struggle that will eventually break
the shackles that bind woman and lead her forth into that
world of freedom and happiness that only a Socialist
society can give.

WOMEN AND EQUALITY A
By MARGARET COWL

' Q IT IS an undisputed fact that all Women are in an unequal
position with men in all countries with the exception of
the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.

We have often been led to believe that this unequal posi-
tion of women has always existed and therefore is a natural
one. Frederick Engels, a noted philosopher and scientist,
in his Origin of the Family, attacks this idea. He says:

 

“It is one of the most absurd notions derived from eighteenth
century enlightenment, that in the beginning of society woman
was the slave of man. Among all savages and barbarians of the

lower and middle stages, sometimes even of the higher stage, .
)1 women not only have freedom, but are held in high esteem.”

missionary among the Seneca Iroquois, who writes about
the latter as follows:

“The female part generally ruled the house; the provisions were
held in common; but woe to the luckless husband or lover who
.4 _ was too indolent or too clumsy to contribute his share to the
common stock. No matter how many children or how much
private property he had in the house, he was liable at any mo-
ment to receive a hint to gather up his belongings and get
out. . . . The women were the dominating power in the clans
(gentes) and everywhere else. Occasionally they did not hesi-
" tate to dethrone a chief and degrade him to a common warrior.’’

' ~,, The freedom of women, as described by Arthur Wright,
coincided with the non-existence of private property. Wealth

consisted chieﬂy of tools for obtaining and preparing food;
houses, clothing and ornaments.

“Human labor power”, says Engels, “at this stage does
not yet produce a considerable amount over and above its
cost of subsistence.” Human beings produced chieﬂy for
the purposes of existence, not as today, when production is
chieﬂy for making proﬁts.

The introduction of cattle-raising, of the metal industry,
of weaving, and ﬁnally of agriculture wrought a change.
Captured enemies were no longer put to death or absorbed
into the clan as members. They were put to work and the
proceeds of their labor, over and above that needed for
their own subsistence, belonged not to themselves but to cer-
tain families whose riches increased.

According to the division of labor at that time, the task
of obtaining food and the tools necessary for this purpose
belonged to the man; he owned the latter and kept them
in case of separation, as the woman did the household goods.
According to this social custom, the man became also the
owner of the new source of existence, the cattle, and later
on of the new labor power, the slaves. He accumulated the
riches produced by the labor of others. He became the
owner of private property, the exploiter of human labor
power.

But his children could not inherit his property. Accord-.

ing to maternal law, which existed at that time, his chil-
dren belonged not to his clan, but to the clan from whence
the mother came. Upon his death, his closest relatives in-
herited his property. His children were disinherited.

“In the measure of the increasing wealth man’s position in the
family became superior to that of woman, and the desire arose
to use this fortiﬁed position for the purpose of overthrowing

4

 

 

, t.,,r__.

the traditional law of inheritance in favor of his children.”
(Engels, Origin of the Family.)

Maternal law was abolished.

“The downfall of maternal law was the historic defeat of the
female sex. The men seized the reins also in the house, the
women were stripped of their dignity, enslaved, tools of men's
lust and mere machines for the generation of children.” (Engels,
Origin of the Family.)

Inequality Based on Exploitation

The present inequality of women as compared to men, the
unequal position of the Negro toiling population in the
U.S.A. as compared to that of the white workers, the un-
equal position of the laboring masses as a whole as com-
pared to that of those who do not work but who own the
wealth of the country, have a common basic reason, namely:
The existence of the exploitation of one human being by
another under the system of the ' private ownership of the
things most essential to produce the necessities of life. (The
ownership of the railroads, the factories, factory machinery,
sources of raw materials, the banks, etc.) ,

The exploiting class, or, as it is commonly called, the
capitalist class, does not work, but accumulates riches from
the labor of others. They are the masters. The working
class, who build the subways, the sky-scrapers, dig the coal,
till the soil, grow the food, make the machinery for the fac-
tories, run the railroads, ship and distribute the things that
are essential to maintain life, do the bookkeeping, the typing,
the teaching, etc., etc., who produce all the riches of the
land, receive only a small part of the proceeds of their labor
in the form of money wages. The rest is pocketed by the
employing class. They, the workers, are the hired slaves of
the masters, the capitalist class.

The capitalist class is only a small minority of the popula-

tion. The working class, together with the working farmers,
the small business people and the professional groups, make
up the great majority of the population. The latter three
groups are also squeezed more and more by the capitalist
class. -
Thus there exists the exploitation of one human being by
another under the capitalist system of society, sanctioned by
the government which is controlled by the capitalist class,
a system based on the division of the population into classes
——those who work, the great majority of whom have nothing
and a small number who have a little, but are daily losing
it, and those who do not work but who have everything.

Not only men but women too are to be found in the capi-
talist class. There are women employing large numbers of
workers, women who have many servants, etc. Therefore
the division in society is not women against men, but work-
ers against exploiters, against capitalists.

However, the women in the capitalist class have not the
same rights with men of that class. This is a remnant of
the historic change as described earlier._ The proﬁts these
women accumulate through the exploitation of workers ‘(of
both men and Women workers), according to law in the
U.S.A., are not always their own property to do with as
they please.

These old unjust laws appear in the form of inequality in
marriage, no free choice in the selection of nationality by
the mother for her children (generally the nationality of the
father is the one recognized), inequality in the choice of a
career, etc.

Because of their position, it is therefore natural that these

women of the capitalist class who are not on a par with the
6

men of their class and who themselves either exploit labor
or live on the proceeds of such exploitation, see a division
in society along sex lines and not along class lines as
described above.

It is no wonder, then, that they are the prominent leaders
of the feminist movement in the U.S.A., and the most active
foes of labor legislation for working-class women.

By the time large scale industry developed, with factories
replacing household and small-shop production and machin-
ery taking the place of the hand tool, many traditions
stamping women’s position in society as inferior to man’s
had already taken root.

Discriminaﬁon—Weapon Against All Workers

The employer of labor utilized these reactionary ideas
about women to make more proﬁts for himself. Especially
when machinery was simpliﬁed women were employed in
larger numbers at wages lower than the wages received by
men for the same kind of work. (Negro women were and
are paid even lower wages than white women.) New ma-
chines did not require as much muscular strength. Supple
limbs ﬁtted in with the increased speed-up in the factories.
Wages of men workers were reduced and became insulﬁcient
to feed and clothe the entire family. Rather than see their
loved ones starve, women entered the factories in greater
numbers to earn their daily bread. (For statistics see
Women Who W ork* by Grace Hutchins). Theentrance of
women into industry is in itself a progressive factor." But
the’ oppressive conditions forced upon them are degrading.

It is a fact that in the U.S.A. many women in skilled

* International Publishers, 1934-. $1.
7

 

trades, where it took years of learning to achieve that skill,
receive less wages than unskilled men workers.

In her book, Women Who W ork, Grace Hutchins writes
that married women or women who had been married make
up’ 46.1 per cent of all working women in the U.S.A. “In
certain centers”, she writes, “especially in the South where
many Negro women are employed and in towns where there
are many foreign-born women in industry, the proportion of
married, widowed, and divorced women wage-earners is
sometimes as high as 70 per cent. In face of the growing
propaganda to oust married women from industry (in the
U.S.A. with a law calling for dismissal of married
women in government employ as a precedent to discharge
married women from industry, and with the Westinghouse
Company in New York already taking the hint), illusions
are created among married women in industry that if they
increase their speed they will not be dismissed. Thus they
become a prey for increased speed-up without increase in
wages. They become diﬂicult to organize into trade unions
for fear of losing their jobs. This intensiﬁed work on the
part of married women arouses a competition between men
and women workers and creates a sex antagonism which acts
in favor of the employer because it helps to keep the men
and women workers divided so that they cannot unitedly
struggle for improved conditions.

Lower Wages for Women Means Lower Wages for All

A reserve army of cheap labor power is created. The
presence in the factories of such cheap labor; mothers,
wives of unemployed workers clinging to the factory gates
in search of work, with thoughts of the empty milk bottle
at home, offers a ﬁne basis for an offensive against the wages
of all workers.

The splendid qualities of women, their tender feelings for
their loved ones, were and are used by the employers in the
attempt to reduce to a minimum the resistance offered by
men workers against increasing exploitation, against the low-
ering of the standard of living of the working class. That
part of Lord Ashley’s speech, quoted by Karl Marx in a
footnote in Capital, Volume I, delivered in London in 1844
on the Ten-Hour Bill, wherein he said “thus are the virtues,
the peculiar virtues of the female character to be perverted
to her injury—thus all that is most dutiful and tender in
her nature is made a means of her bondage and suffering”,
applies to the present position of women who work.

The precedent of lower wages for women is now being
used to reduce wages for all workers, particularly in fascist
Germany. Women workers are dismissed and men em-
ployed at wages even lower than the wages paid to women,
on the ground that the employment of male labor would in-
crease wage costs. Men are replacing women at “women’s
wages” but on condition that they increase their speed.
Adult women who know how to struggle for improved con-
ditions, are being dismissed and young girls are taking their
place at lower wages and with greater speed-up. While
Hitler was broadcasting the demand for the return of women
to the kitchen, children and church, the number of women
in German industry increased in the ﬁrst nine months of
1933 by 9.1 per cent, especially in the industries manufac-
turing articles for war purposes.

In the U.S.A. this principle of lower wages for women
workers has been sanctioned by the Roosevelt N.R.A. codes.
Lower minimum wages for women were written into over
120 codes. In the South the white men workers in the textile
industry receive less wages than do the men textile workers
