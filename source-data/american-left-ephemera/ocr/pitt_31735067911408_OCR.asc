list of unemployed lead-zinc min-

’ ers, thousands of lead and zinc

smeltermen, and even more re-

-cently, thousands‘ of unemployed

and partially-employed brass ‘

workers. Were it not for the fact
that Chile’s copper production,
which normally comes into this
country, has been withheld from
the-market over a period of
months, we would today be facing

‘a similar critical situation in cop-

per. In any event, once Chile’s

serious situation will very rapidly
develop in copper.”

 PROGRAM
The union recommended the follow-
ing program to alleviate the non-fer-
rous metals crisis:

I)

III Relief for the _workers in the in-
’dustry through a law to provide direct
federal assistance over and above pres-
ent unemployment compensation pay-
ments, through immediate and sub-
.sta'nti_al wage increases to workers
who are still employed,_ and through
increased tax exemptions for: all those
earning $5,000 per year and under.

. Henslee is a former

town of Miami po- ,
liceman. ‘ Refugio Falquez -
Suspension‘ of Henslee under the di-
rect threat of a strike by the local was
heavily influenced by the fact that ev-
ery A. F. of L. union in the area had
one on record in support of Local
v 86's,fight and had notified the com-
anythat they would respect the Mine-
Kiill/picket line-should the strike for

' Henslee’s removal take place.‘

LOCAL MOBILIZED BEHIND I=ALou£'1

Brother Falquez had reported for
work on the graveyard shift October
24. and was told by one of the com-

Eahy’ guards that he could not work

ecause he had been drinking. Fal- -

quei felt that he could and should
giako the shift even though he had

een to a dance and had admittedly

gaken a few drinks, but when his shift

oreman told him he couldn't work-he

agreed to return home. ,
He called his parents on the phone

 ‘and asked them to come after him. In

./..

,"

1 the ' ‘meantime, ' Henslee ' appeared and

; agreed 'to give Falquez a ride home,

 As-soon) as they left tlioimmediate
, lant area, Hensleelprocéeded to beat
 alquez into unconsciousness and then

-' ,-took him to the" Miami Town Jail,

gwheref he was charged with drunkeness

‘land disturbing the peace.

'— Local 586 immediately filed a griev-
jance‘.-on7s~.the' case,‘ demanding that
;_’-Henslee‘ be remoyed from .duty and

thatjilalquez be reinstated on the.job'

with-pay .-for time lost. "At the same
time, a - regular membership meeting

"tequently \set Nov. 4 as the deadline for

‘ agement and the company still refused
‘to make any concessions. »

ne that the compan_yea‘greed to sus-

-Local leaders here say that the an;_

and that ' the solidarity “and unity

had attacked Henslee and that Henslee:
had to beat Falquez unconscious in

order to subdue him was shattered by_

witness after witness put ‘on the stand
by the Union, each of whom testified
that they had been beaten ’up without
cause or provocation by— Henslee -when
he was ‘on the Miami Police Force.
The hearing also brought to light
the fact that, contrary to the conten-
tion of Henslee and the" company,

Henslee was not and is ‘hot a deputy ,

sheriff and had no right to arr'est Fal-"
quez.‘ Being discussed now is the possi-
bility of Falquez.filing a damage suit
against "the company as well as a
charge of false arrest and impersonat-

ing an officer «against Henslee.

_ ,_ HURLEY, N. M.+A Kennecott‘com-

pany foreman at the Hurley smelter
here has found out. that, slugging a
Mine-Mill steward.is not the wayto

‘ settle a grievance. 5 ~

.Forem'an Mahoney is out of a iiob.
The company notified Mine-Mill Local
890 that Mahoney had “resigned,”
twodays after his attackon steward

 Felix Martinez had brought a threat

of sliutdown at thellrlurley smelter and
protests from ‘every Mine-Mill local
in the Kennecott chain. '

The whole thing _-started on Novem-
ber‘ 15 when Martinez took up a griev-
ance brought to him by Brother’Miran-
da, a Local 890 member, regarding a
denial of overtime. Brother Nanez, an-

,AH_a_ck  seniority defeated

SELBY, ,Calif.—An ~ attempt by the

A; S.‘& R. management to violate the_

‘principle of seniority was defeated '

here when Mine-Mill Local 51 fought
the case all the way up through the

~ grievance procedure and came out vic-
torious withxan important arbitration _

decision in their favor.
In an award dated November, ‘1953,

Arbitrator Robert K. Atkinson upheld

the Union's contention that Marcus H.
Dunbar was entitled to the job of
crane operator for which he had ap-

plied on the basis of his seniority. The- M

arbitrator’s~deéision ordered that Dun-
bar be promoted to the jobhe bid for
in “the new zinc plant with full back
' pay to the date of the opening of the
new department around‘April 8.
Dunbar, an ‘employe at the plant

since 1945, applied for the job of "con- "

trol or crane operator in the new de-
partment on April 8, but was,by-

passed by the company. Of the eight,’
men given the jobs for which he had.

applied, only two had more seniority‘ 
than Dunbar. The, Union took up the‘
grievance ‘immediately, but the» com- 1'

-pa'nysat"two meetings on April 14 and
April 24 claimed that Dunbar didn't
have the “dependability” nor “respons-

. .’

Mine-Mill Local«700’ at Magnus Metals
here have put a bridle on the general

foreman whose idea of discouraging

grievances was to intimidate workers
through force and violence. '

7 Lawrence Morgan, chief steward at
the Magnus Metals unit of Local 700,
writes_: '  .

“After the stewardshad won several’
. grievances against the company, the"

general foreman began to. resort to

force and violence, but he was stopped .
‘ at once through the alertness of our

‘ present Foundry steward, : Cornelius
'Wright, who has been constantly edu-
cating the-workers in his shop by ex-
.plaining their. rights to them.

“On November, 23, Louis Garcia, an

‘ employeein the -Foundry, was coerced,

, lntimidafionen

’ ' LOS ANGE:LES,'"Calif.-Stewards of-

ibility” for the ‘job, and the case was
submitted to arbitration on June 30.
UNION CHARGES SUSTAINED

T—he Union’sf_main ‘argument in the
case was that ‘the 'company’s refusal
to promote Dunbar to. the job he ap-
plied for/was a violation of the seni-
ority provisions of the Local 51 con-

tract.‘ The company tried to build a

case out of “derelictions of duty”
charged against Dunbar on other jobs
he ‘had held .previously in the plant
and tried to make this the basis of de-
nial of Dunbar’s seniority rights. The
Union blasted the company’s attempt “
to ring in such terms as “dependa-
bility” and “responsibility" as new
qualifications for ,a job. .
Upholding the Union's argument,
the arbitrator ruled that “the Com-
pany in refusing to promote“ Marcus

t

-11. Dunbar to the. iob'of Crane Opera-
‘ tor in the’Zinc P'lant failed to perform

its obligation under the contract and-
that therefore Marcus H. Dunbar be

_ transferred td» that position“ and be

compensated fully as though he had

-been, transferred at the date of the_

opening ‘of the Zinc Plant.’’" J

‘Foundry, . who, saw everything that

“We went to work~imm;ediately, and

- CLEVELAND, O. -- A“ resolution
strongly condemning the current red-

“This whole affair—the " Brownell
speech, the Velde-McCarthy-Jenner
circus tactics, " and the lack of affirma- V
tive White House leadership—-consti-
tute a disgraceful chapter in Ameri-

for‘ the future. _We voice our condem-
nation and our concern. We_ express
the hope that the public outcry against
these unAme1-ican tactics will be so
strong and firm that there will be no
repetition of it, for the protection of
ourselves and future.generations.” ‘

- I REFUSE to answer on the
ground thatlit would tend to incrim-
inate me.” That statement is being
heard frequently these days——in con-
gressional hearings, in grand jury
rooms, in investigations by “loyalty
boards” set up by various cities,
schools and other agencies.

The immediate rgeaction of some
people to such a refusal isa shocked,
“Ah, hah. The witness must be guil-
ty of something,-for otherwise an
honest answer could not possibly in-
criminate him.” , j

It is only a short step to the next
conclusion—'-that the right of refusal
to testify on grounds of self-incrim-
ination is dangerous because it is
being used to shield Communists, se-
curity violators, Red sympathizers
and spies. _ - .

That thought has brought about
various demands for limitations on

‘ the right of refusal to testify and
an effort is being made to convince
the public that it is disreputable to
refuse to testify against oneself in
Communist investigations if not in
other types of criminal cases. A

Some members of congress want
to clothe congressional committees
with authority to force witnesses to‘
talk. ‘by granting immunity. from
grosecution. If a witness could not.

e prosecuted, he could not incrim-
inate himself in the eyes of the law

by anything he might say,‘ so‘’he '

would haveto talk or go to jail for_
contempt.

Attorney General Brownell favors

lar case. "S I ‘ ' '

Mr. Brownell alsowants a law to
permit the use of wiretap evidence
in espionage cases. In that way a
man’s own words.could be used as
testimony to incriminate him, as-
suming, of course, that the proposed
law would prove to be constitutional.

CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION-1953

When he is throughfrefusing. to
answer those additional questions
on the ground of possible “self-
incrimination” his character has
been pretty well blackened by in-

ference and the headlines proclaim’

f‘Blank Refuses to Say it He Was
Spy.”.What protection. has the fifth
amendment been to him? '

If courts suddenly C" displayed the

same lack of feeling for the spirit
of the fifth amendment that some

congressional comrnitit-ees have.

shown, the entire ‘country would be
shocked. ‘ 4- . .
Crimes proved every day

Those.who find fault with the
fifth amendment ‘keep asking, /“If a
man is not ..a Communist how could
he possibly incriminate himself by
saying he is not?” There "are many
possibilities, if we want to get into
thefield of conjecture; ,

He might, for example, know that
someone ‘had accused him of being
a Communist and he may fear that
if he answers the .qi1"estion he may
find himself facing aperjury trial
with his word pitted against that of
his accuser. In _-such a circumstance

~ the prudent course might be to re-
fuse to talk. ' ‘ i

No one could be so naive as to

suppose that only innocent persons

seek refuge in the fifth amendment]

We do not doubt .,,that ‘many Com-
munists have taken advantage of it.

 But those who take the position
that only the guilty need the pro-
tection of the fifth‘ amendment
must, to be consistent, take the
additional position that innocent

persons are never falsely aocuse
and suspected. ’ j

‘ We can understand the frustra-
, tioncongressional investigators feel
when a witness refuses to say
whether he was a Communist. But

should we pwhittle away the rights ‘
of all persons-—innocent* or guilty—i
have under the fifth amendment in-

the ‘hope of catching more Commu-
nists? 3 - »

Crimes such asmurderand kid-
naping are proved "every day’ with-
out forcing people to be witnesses
against themselves. Are’ not our
law enforcement ' agencies” capable
of dealing with espionage on the
samebasis? ' .

Nexf sfep—police sfofe

We hope congress and the country -

’ will consider carefullybefore trying
to put any limitations on the fifth

amendment. We doubt if a law. to-

give immunity to witnesses in the

‘ hope of forcing themto talk could
guarantee enough immunity to be
constitutional. i

If the government sees‘ fit to deny‘ a

government" employment to persons

‘ who refuse to talk by involking the

fifth amendment, ‘we can find no

fault with that action. ’A govern-

ment. job is not a right, but a privi-

cor ‘sideshow’ hit by IAM
WASHINGTON, D. C.—The

the, Harry Dexter White case as 1
“political sideshow” used by the Re-
publicans_ to take the people’s- minds
off the failures of the Eisenhower ad-
ministration. An editorial in The Ma-
chinist pointed out:

“The manner in which Mr. Brownell 
a_ political ‘
speech from a political platform-—with ’

launched his attack—in

the follow-iupcarefully planned in ad-
vance with other members of his par-
ty has given substance to the charge
that Mr. Brownellhas turned the high
office of Attorney General into that
of a barker for a political sideshow-
a "sideshow with the purpose of taking
the minds of us yokels off an unpopu-
lar main event going on inside the big
tent of this administration. Far from
unifying the American people, Mr.
Brownell is dividing us further, seek-
ing to make us more suspicious than
ever of one another.”

AFL lqbels spy scare ‘false’

WASHINGTON, D. C.—The AFL
Nov. 20 attacked as an “obvious fake”
the use of" the Communist issue by

, Atty. Gen. Brownell and other Re-
~ publicans

against former
Truman and the New Deal. _

An editorial in’ the AFL News—Re-
porter .said:T “Have the Republican
strategists pdiscoverred the/truth . . .
that they have no recorrd of accomplish-
ment? Have they admitted bcmlcrruptcy
by trying to dig up ‘Com'm,1m'£st em]

s'c_a.res to divert public attentio-n’ from .

the -real: issue?”

e'Sucl(er bait‘. says loborpoper

DENVER—In an editorial entitled
Sucker Bait, the Colorado Labor Advo-
cate, referring ‘to what it called “the
Truman-Brownell‘ imbroglio,” pointed
out that “it is inconceivable that Harry
Truman knowingly injured his country
by accepting a Communist spy, in an

important’ Dosition, and it is equally A

inconceivable that Republican leaders

don’t realize this.” - I
“What are they making a fuss about,

then,” the- paper" asks, and goes on:

“The-answer should have been obvious _

from the beginning: They're trying to
pull the Wool over the people’s eyes . . .

V to blind them to the criminal subversion

of the people’s interests that has been
going on ever since the Cadillac Cru-

sade took over Washington. Don’t fall ‘ ‘

forsuch a sucker deal.”

‘Ominous lesson‘ in attack on

Truman. warns clothing union

NEW YORK—-Sounding the alarm
that the liberties of all Americans are
in mo1:t‘al‘danger, The Advance, news-
paper of the CIO Amalgamated Cloth-
ing Workers, warned: “When our chief
law officer, the attorney general of
the U. S., out-McCarthys McCarthy,
then we better watch out.”

Under the heading, “Stab in the

Back,” a lengthy editorial in the news- _

paper’s ‘Dec. 1 issue described Atty,

Gen. Brownell’s attack on former" Pres.‘

Truman’ as “a new all-time low in the
political morality of this country.”
Stating that “we do not sit in judgment
over the guilt or innocence of the late
Mr. White,” the CIO paper's editorial
pointed out, however, that in their testi-
mony before the Jenner committee,
Brownell and FBI Director J. Edgar
Hoover “laid down a novel doctrine of
guilt and "innocence which, if perpet-1

uated, means the destruction of our.

entire Bill of Rights.” .

The “ominous lesson” to be learned
from the treatment of Truman, the
new_spap_er said, is this: “If this can

.be done against a former President,
, who himself was -the architect of our

anti-Communist policy . . . then the
lowly citizen must sit in fear and
trembling as to what may await him.

.. . .' Such a political climate may very '

well destroy every one of our liberties
and they may never be restored- When
fear,“ hysteria and hate-combine with
fascist or any other totalitarian drives
successfully, then we will have to say

, goodbye to all we have held dear in'__ I '

our way of life till now.’_’

MIAMI, Ariz.——El Local 586 de Mine-I

Mill de esta ciudad acaba de lograr
otro triunfo relativo a la defensa de sus
rniembros que confirma, una vez mas,
que solo la solidaridad y unldad de ac-
cion de los trabajadores es capaz do
proteger y extender los derechos de los
trabajadores.

El caso erfipezo el dia 24 de octubre
cuando el Co. Refugio Falquez, un em-
leado de la empresa Coarse Crushing
lant, reporto ala planta para empezar
el pueble de medianoche. Un guardia
de la empresa le dijo que no podia tra-

bajar porque andaba tomado. Falquez ‘

sentia que’podia y debia trabajar el
pueble aunque habia asistido a un balle
y se habia tomado una pocas copas,
,pero cuando su patron le dijo que no
podia. trabajar acordo regresar a. -su
pdomicilio. ’, ’ —
Llamo a sus padres por teléfono y les
, pido que-y’yinieran por él. Mientras-
tanto, aparecio el asistente jefe do
guardias Boyce Henslee y ofrecio llevar
u Falquez a su casa. Falquez acepto.
Al salir de la region inmediata de la
giants, Henslee procedio a golpear a
alquez ,hasta dejarlo lnconsciente y
después lo llevo a la carcel de Miami,

~ donde -lo acusaron de borrachera y do

,estorbar la paz. .- A .

El Local 586 inniediatamente sometio
un agravio en el caso, demandando que
Henslee fueradespedido de su trabajo

V‘ ycque Falquez fuese reinstituido a su

trabajo con ‘el pago del tiempo perdido.

» ‘ A1" mismo tie’mpo, una junta reglamen-

taria del local voto corripleto apoyo en el

caso, aunﬁhasta el extento de cerrar la ‘
_ uplanta. si, la. compaﬁia no concedia.
‘ ,,rSubse'cuentemente, la. membrecia fijo

Hurley

HURLEY, N. M.—Un patron de' la
Compaﬁia Kennecott en la fundicion
en Hurley se desengaﬁo en el sentido
de que un agravio no se arregla por
medio .de rbofetar a un steward do
Mine-Mill.

El mencionado patron cuyo nombre

es Mahoney ya no tiene su trabajo. ‘La -

compaﬁia notifico al Local 890 de Mine-‘

Mill que Mahoney habia “renunciado,".

dos dias despues de su ataque contra el
steward Felix Martinez. La “renuncia”
vino dos dias despues de que la union

~ amenazo cerrar Ia planta en Hurley ,1

después de haberse recibido protestal
de todos los locales de Mine-Mill en la
cadena Kennecott.

El lncidente empezo el dia 15 do
noviembre cuando Martinez proceso
un agravio traido a su atention por el
Co. Miranda, un miembro del Local
,890, a quien se le habia negado tuba-
jar sobretiempo. '
steward, acompaﬁo a Martinez y 3

_ . .5 EDMONTON, Alta.-—Mine-Mill «and
-"other unions are planning action
-’:against a proposal for further anti—la-
L bor legislation by~-stile government of
Alberta. . .
A draft bill has been sent by the gov-

 l_.?'ernlnent to employers and unions for

study before the next meeting of the
legislature in February. \
C The bill adds further penalties and
restrictions against unions for “illegal"

‘ strikes; also provides that strikes which
B have becnsettled can be termed illegal
, "afterwards, and the penalties applied.
ilt would provide for decertification of a
union if it or its members took part in

I" __,. an “illegal” strike. ‘A strike is only

-‘legal when all the provisions of the
act, including lengthy cooling off pro-
cedures, have been followed.

_ DECERTIFICATION
_ The proposed bill.a_lso provides for
decertification of unions, opening the
way for ‘employer intervention during
bargaining, .. and allows extension of
time allowed by the Board to act on

, applications for certification.

/

One feature of‘ the proposals is the
complete opening of the door to the
breaking up of industrial units into
small groups, even to the extent of

‘Z; ' individual job classifications. This, it is

hoped, will win support of the AFL

Union heads "for the anti-strike pro-
visions. , '

" Opposition has been voiced by the
CCL Unions in Alberta, although it is
expected that the main opposition will

. be spearheaded by the Mine-Mill unions
. with support from locals ofthe United

- Mine Workers. o

 Union leaders in the province have
expressed surprise at the Government's
proposals, as repeated boasts by the
Social Credit administration draw at-

tention to the almost strike-free record‘ _

of the provincein the last few years.

SUDBURY, Ont.'—-Insistent demands from Sudbury’s wage earn-
ers, small home owners, rent payers and small business people that
they be truly represented in City’ Council came to’a head last month
with the selection of -four candidates for the Sudbury municipal elec-

tions of December 7.

.- All four candidates are members of Mine-Mill ‘Local 598, at Inter-

national", Nickel Company.

An open meeting held in the Mine-Mill Union I-Izill last month
resulted in unanimous agreement that candidates representing the

overwhellning bulk of the people of
Sudbury sl'l“all - contest the civic elec-’

'tion. Nominations from the'floor saw

more than 30 men and women recom-
mended» as possible candidates for

Board of Control ‘and Council. The
meeting-directed those nominated to

meet and determine among themselves

who would stand in the election.
"Discussing the issues revolving
around the elections, speakers pointed
out that the "working people"would be
fully justified in contesting every seat
on Council, but thatthe more practical
approach would be to run a minimum

onumber. The meeting , agreed in its
direction. to those nominated to "select
-‘among themselves one candidate for

candidate for each — of the three ‘ city
wards. . i * _ V
