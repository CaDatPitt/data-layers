  <abstract type="Summary">Individual programs in the collection are mostly organized by the theatre or venue where the production took place. These venues are arranged alphabetically by name, then chronologically.  In some instances, a performing arts group did not have a home theatre or consistent venue where they performed, such as the Civic Light Opera and the Quantum Theatre. In these instances, the programs and other materials are filed under the title of the performing arts group.  

With each series, the total number of document boxes is listed.  The boxes are not numbered consecutively as found in other archival collections because these numbers regularly change with new donations.  Typically, the collection's policy is to only keep two copies of a program, although exceptions to this include commemorative programs and programs that are autographed or contain marginalia.

Where individual programs are listed for online access, the date listed is usually the start date for the production's engagement.  Typically, productions would start on a Monday and the same program would be issued throughout the run of performances.

Please note that this collection does not represent all of the Pittsburgh theatre programs in the Curtis Collection.  Many of the Pittsburgh programs prior to 1930 are in our scrapbook collection.  Please consult the Special Collections staff with inquiries for theatres that you cannot locate in this collection guide.</abstract>
  <abstract type="Summary">The Ford E. and Harriet R. Curtis Theatre Collection contain tens of thousands of Pittsburgh theatre programs from the 1840s to the present. They include productions from current performing arts groups in Pittsburgh.  Sometimes newspaper clippings, marketing materials, photographs, and memorabilia related to the theatres and performing arts companies are stored with the programs.</abstract>

  <note type="biographical/historical">One of the main components of the Ford E. and Harriet R. Curtis Theatre Collection is its Pittsburgh theatre programs.  Dr. Ford E. Curtis began teaching drama in the English department at the University of Pittsburgh in 1924.  He and his wife, Harriet, were avid theatre goers, attending performances every week.  After his retirement in 1961, he began to add to their personal collection of playbills and programs in the hopes of building a collection to donate to Pitt.

In the early 1960s, Dr. Curtis even went so far as to put advertisements in Carnegie Magazine, the Western Pennsylvania Historical Magazine, and programs for the Pittsburgh Playhouse.  The advertisements put out a call for any and all Pittsburgh programs to be donated to him; he even listed his home address and telephone number, with the goal to build a Pittsburgh theatre history collection for the University of Pittsburgh.  Large numbers of programs were also donated by the New York Public Library and the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh.

The materials that Dr. Curtis amassed -- his own collection, materials donated to him, and the Curtis Collection staff's current efforts to acquire additional programs -- help to document the history of theatre and the performing arts in Pittsburgh.</note>
  <note>Donations are added to the collection every few months.  These donations come from the producing groups themselves and the general public. If you are interested in donating theatre programs to the collection, please contact the Special Collections Department staff.</note>
