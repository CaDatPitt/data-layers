  <abstract type="Scope and content">The survey report, which was a pilot project designed to provide necessary information for both trouping personnel (stage managers, electricians, booking agents, and route planners) and for architects and consultants concerned with theatre building, is split into two parts. The summary information, which is in the first folder of the first box, describes the methods and procedures involved in creating the survey. There are also recommendations on the future use and expansion of the survey. The second part of the report contains detailed information on each of the thirty-two venues that were surveyed. Each venue's survey is over twenty pages long and contains capacity numbers, stage dimensions, information on lighting and sound equipment, etc. These surveys make up the bulk of the materials in the collection.</abstract>

  <note type="biographical/historical">The pilot survey of performing arts in facilities in Pennsylvania was conducted by the Theatre Association of Pennsylvania with the assistance of the Pennsylvania Council on the Arts and the National Endowment for the Arts. The survey was a pilot project designed to provide necessary information for both trouping personnel (stage managers, electricians, booking agents, and route planners) and for architects and consultants concerned with theatre building. It covers thirty-two theatres in six geographical areas of Pennsylvania. Some of the theatres surveyed have since been renovated or demolished. The six geographic areas include Wilkes-Barre, Philadelphia, Bethlehem-Allentown, Central Pennsylvania (Harrisburg, Altoona, Lancaster), Pittsburgh, and Erie. The survey combines information about facilities to aid in the set-up and performance of events. The future goal of the project was to survey all performing arts facilities in the state of Pennsylvania.</note>
