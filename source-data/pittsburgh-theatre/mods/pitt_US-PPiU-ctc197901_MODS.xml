  <note type="biographical/historical">Playwright and former actor, Peter Gregg, born Joseph Peter Crocco, is a native of western Pennsylvania. He began his theatrical career at the Carnegie Institute of Technology, where he was enrolled in the Drama Department from 1934 to 1937. Mr. Gregg moved to New York in 1937 and won his first professional part a year later in Cry for Passion, an off-Broadway production. He continued to work off-Broadway for the next few years, both as an actor and stage manager. In 1941, he earned a part in the successful Broadway play The Doughgirls, produced by Max Gordon and George S. Kaufman, and he later served as a stage manager, director, and actor in The Doughgirls touring company. After World War II, Mr. Gregg returned to the New York stage, and for the next nine years, he worked in theater, radio, and films. He gave up his pursuit of an acting career in 1954 when he returned to Pittsburgh. Mr. Gregg wrote his first play, Sweet Delirium, in 1946. It was seriously considered for production by Forest Haring but was eventually dropped. Some years later, Mr. Gregg sold another play to Broadway producers, but it was also not produced. He continued to write plays until his death.</note>
