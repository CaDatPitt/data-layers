  <note type="biographical/historical">The Pittsburgh Playhouse, a community theatre company, was born to fill the void for a resident theatre left behind by the collapse of commercial venues. Motion pictures were pushing out live theater, forcing stock companies and other theatre companies to lose their grip on the Depression era's rare entertainment dollar. Pittsburgh's stock companies, like the George Sharp Players (Shubert and Alvin Theatres, 1927-31) or the Nixon Players (Nixon Theatre) featured a diverse fare of light comedies, farce, melodramas, and mystery but still could not meet the tastes, prices, or choices available in films. The only options remaining were the large-scale touring companies (also a dwindling possibility with the conversion of the Alvin to a motion picture format in 1932), burlesque or small local ventures. Despite attempts by the Pittsburgh Civic Playhouse, Pittsburgh Summer Theatre, etc. (scrapbooks from these ventures are included in this collection,) little opportunity existed for Pittsburgh's residents to create and produce theatre outside the university setting. In 1934, a group of civic leaders joined forces to form a resident community theatre -- The Pittsburgh Playhouse Association. The stability, financial and artistic, provided by an affluent Executive board complemented by an Advisory committee (including local theatre professionals), gave the new venture a good foundation and a community impulse from the start. The new community theatre was contributing to civic culture and developing the talents of avocational actors. The first production, Art and Mrs. Bottle, opened in a borrowed auditorium, Frick School, with rented equipment on December 10, 1934, to social fanfare and mixed reviews. Despite a lack of permanent home and financial hard times, the recipe for a long-lived institution had been established -- wealthy patrons, knowledgeable artistic guidance and popular appeal. By the second Season, 1935, a part-time Artistic Director was replaced with a full-time position and a permanent home on Craft Avenue, Hamlet Theater, was renovated and available. Despite a briefly lived (1935-37) movement away from semi-professionals toward a professional company under its first Director, Herbert Gellendre, the organization remained committed to a semi-professional, community theater under its next Director, Fred Burleigh, for the next thirty years. Although briefly interrupted by World War II, the Playhouse offered a varied, popular fare under Mr. Burleigh's leadership. The expanding cultural and social center was complete with a restaurant offering meals and entertainment both prior and post performances for the membership. The largest leaps came in the late 1940s with the addition of the school and children's theater. In 1947 the Playhouse began offering classes in all aspects of the theatre, formalizing the Playhouse tradition of hands-on learning. The school offered a full-time curriculum including stage techniques, radio acting, and other subjects related to theatre taught by instructors that included Edith Skinner, Shirley Jones, Sada Thompson, George Peppard, Charles Grodin, and local personalities like Helen Wayne Rauh. The second important component was the addition of a children's theatre. In 1949, Fred Burleigh tapped a staff member, William Leech, to organize the Playhouse Jr., Mr. Leech quickly hit upon a winning formula with the shared use of the available acting and production talents and the development of original scripts, mostly from extant sources. Both elements reflected and enhanced the Playhouse's local reputation for quality theatre. The period of growth continued into the 1950s and included the addition of two theatres (Craft Avenue in 1952 and Theatre Upstairs in 1958). This growth, supported by box office receipts and private donations, lead to ambitious thoughts of professionalism. By the early 1960s the growth, organizational size, and waning public interest caused an increasing amount of fiscal distress. The decision to attempt a new approach, regain a somewhat tarnished reputation, and fulfill the goal of a first rate professional theater (within the Playhouse's grasp in the mid-1950s) solidified into a joint venture with Carnegie Tech (now Carnegie Mellon University). In 1965, William Ball formed a professional company, The American Conservatory Theater, in residence at the Pittsburgh Playhouse. After a somewhat successful, albeit short, six month season, Mr. Ball and the Pittsburgh Playhouse parted company (A.C.T. thereafter settled in San Francisco and remains a major regional company and training ground). The 1966-67 season, the next attempt at professionalizing, brought in noted director John Hancock. The intellectual style of Mr. Hancock's theater, although of respectable quality, was met with disinterest by an audience weaned on light comedy and musical revues. Mr. Hancock quickly moved on. By the late 1960s the Pittsburgh Playhouse was financially strapped and still unable to meet the goal of professionalization. A deal with Point Park College managed to keep the wolf from the door for a few more years and during this time the Pittsburgh Ballet Theatre and the American Dance Ensemble were formed, but even that arrangement proved unworkable. The Executive Committee voted to disband and closed the Pittsburgh Playhouse complex in 1973. The joint venture with Point Park College was unable to maintain the extant institution, however; the college saw fit to acquire the facilities and use them to expand their performing arts departments. From 1974 to well into the 1990s, Point Park College continued the Playhouse tradition of performing arts education and until recently maintained the film repertory, children's theatre and the small professional company. Due to financial concerns Point Park College discontinued the film series and severely curtailed the children's and professional companies.</note>
