  <abstract type="Summary">The scrapbook primarily contains clipped newspaper and magazine articles in approximately chronological order.  In most instances, the clippings are adhered to the scrapbook pages, but some clippings and articles are loose.  This scrapbook has been disbound and its contents broken up into folders based on subject.  It is assumed that the pages are still in their original order.

Note that some of the clippings are very fragile.  Preservation photocopies of these items have been made and are available in the same folder as the originals.  In some cases, preservation photocopies have replaced the original scrapbook pages.  Researchers are encouraged to use these facsimiles.

The majority of the scrapbook contains materials related to Russell's career post 1904.  There are a number of pages dedicated to her 1912 marriage to Alexander Pollock Moore, owner of the Pittsburgh Leader.</abstract>

  <note type="biographical/historical">Lillian Russell was an American actress and singer and one of the more popular entertainers of her era.  She became well-known in the 1880s performing in New York City in light opera and musical comedies.  She was a part of the Tony Pastor company, the Weber and Fields company, and eventually had her own Lillian Russell Opera Company.

In 1912, Russell married Alexander Pollock Moore, owner of the Pittsburgh Leader, and settled in Pittsburgh.  During this time, she performed only sporadically.  During her later years, Russell wrote a newspaper column on various topics including health, love, and beauty, became an advocate for women's suffrage, and participated in Marnie recruiting efforts for World War I.  In 1922, Russell traveled to Europe on an immigration fact-finding mission for President Harding.  Following a short illness after her return, Lillian Russel passed away at her home in Pittsburgh.

This scrapbook was donated by Margaret Mckee Crothers in March 1965.  Mrs. Crothers or her brother are presumed to be the creators of the scrapbook.</note>
