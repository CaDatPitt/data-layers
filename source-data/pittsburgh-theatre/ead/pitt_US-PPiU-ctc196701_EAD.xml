            <p>Harold Barth organized his scrapbooks in volumes according to subject, i.e. drama, music, motion pictures, etc. Twenty-one volumes contain programs accompanied by related clippings (although scrapbooks for motion pictures are primarily clippings), presumably for those performances that Barth attended between 1905-1967. All of these programs are mounted in loose-leaf albums. For clippings of interest from magazine and newspapers, Barth used bound ledger books (scrapbooks 22-34, 40) and composition books (scrapbooks 35-39). The final volume is a loose-leaf notebook presented to the Curtis Collection by Eva Wasbutsky, Barth's secretary, after his death. Barth was in interested in all of the performing arts, but mostly in theatre and film. His primary collection focus was on Shakespeare; the final volumes consist of Shakespearean productions on stage, film, radio, and televsion.</p>
            <p>The scrapbooks have been organized into categories according to form and content, arranged, as much as possible, in chronological order, and assigned numbers. Loose souvenir programs, pamphlets, and clippings were removed and integrated into other areas in the Curtis Collection.</p>

            <head>Biography</head>
            <p>Harold Bradshaw Barth, 1884-1974, was the grandson of one of East Liverpool's earliest settlers. Barth was also a life-long resident of the community except for a brief period as a young man. He was a graduate of the Byron King School of Oratory, a school of dramatic art in Pittsburgh. He later studied under the noted actor, Frederick Warde, and for a few years performed with the Ben Greet Troupe, Shakespearean Players. This early interest in the stage influenced his collecting interests which yielded an enthusiastic accumulation of theatrical memorabilia spanning more than 60 years.</p>
            <p>Barth returned to East Liverpool, Ohio, after the death of his father in 1907 to begin a long and active career in civic life, serving in voluntary roles within municipal, county, state, and federal agencies. He was one of the organizers of East Liverpool's Rotary Club and served as the organization's Secretary for 50 years. He also had a long association with the East Liverpool Chamber of Commerce.</p>
            <p>Local history was of particular interest to him. His two-volume history of Columbiana County was published in 1926. He was a member of the East Liverpool Historical Society, first elected to its Board of Trustees in 1920. He later served as Secretary and later, President. For many years until his death, he served as the Curator of the Society's Museum and developed a notable collection of pottery and local artifacts.</p>
