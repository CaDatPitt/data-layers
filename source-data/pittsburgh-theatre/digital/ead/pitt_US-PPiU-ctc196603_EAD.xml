            <p>The Pittsburgh performing arts photographs are interfiled within the Curtis Collection's larger preforming arts photograph collection. For the most part the collection consists of 8 x 10" or 5 by 7" photographic prints, however, there is also a small amount of negatives, slides, digital images, etc. All of the photographs are arranged in one large alphabetical system. This finding aid was written and the photos were categorized into three series (People, Productions, and Theatres) to facilitate researcher browsing.</p>

                    <p>Contained in this series are images from theatre productions by Pittsburgh-related performing arts groups. Each item contains a scope note that details the individuals in the photograph, who produced the production, and when and where the production took place. Please note that this series does not contain images from touring productions that were produced in Pittsburgh. Images from touring productions can be found in the Touring series within the Ford E. and Harriet R. Curtis Theatre Collection of Performing Arts Photographs. The majority of the photos date from the early 1970s through the early 2000s. The series is arranged alphabetically by the production title. When there are multiple productions of the same play, the producing group is identified in the title and the scope note.</p>

                        <p>The Stanley Theatre was located on Penn avenue at Seventh avenue in downtown Pittsburgh. The theatre was renovated and renamed the Benedum Center of the Performing Arts in 1987. There are a series of seven photographs documenting the construction of the Stanley from early November 1926 through the end of April 1927. Appearing on five of the seven photos is the following - "Theatre and Clark office building for Stanley - Rowland - Clark Corp. Hoffman Henon Co. architects &amp; contractors." These photos appear to have been printed in the 1970s or 1980s. Each photo roughly measures 40' x 24' and there are three copies of each photograph.</p>
                        <p>These photographs are filed separately from the rest of the Curtis photographs due to their size.</p>
