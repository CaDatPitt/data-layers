            <head>History</head>
            <p>Pittsburgh Irish and Classical Theatre (PICT) was founded in 1996 by Andrew S. Paul and Stephanie Riso. PICT's mission is to produce innovative interpretations of dramatic literature in the classic and Irish traditions. Since its inception, PICT has grown to be one of the larger professional theatre companies in Pittsburgh. Alan Stanford became the artistic director of the company in 2013. As of 2015, PICT has produced eighty-nine main stage shows, including six world premieres, eight U.S. premieres, and forty Pittsburgh premieres. In addition to the great works of Shakespeare, Shaw, and Wilde, and their contemporaries, PICT has familiarized Pittsburgh audiences with modern Irish and British playwrights including Brian Friel, Thomas Kilroy, Martin McDonagh, Tom Stoppard, Conor McPherson, David Hare, Harold Pinter, and Marina Carr. Between 2003-2015, most PICT productions have been performed at the theatres in the Stephen Foster Memorial building in Oakland on the University of Pittsburgh campus.</p>
            <p>There have been seven actors of PICT productions to be named the 
                <title render="italic">Pittsburgh Post-Gazette</title> Performer of the Year - Simon Bradbury, Derdriu Ring, Martin Giles, Scott Ferrara, Sheila McKenna, Douglas Rees, and David Whalen. Many of the PICT's productions have been named as among the very best in several local publication's year-end lists.</p>

                    <p>Within this series are the production files of the Pittsburgh Irish &amp; Classical Theatre. Each annual season is treated as a subseries and each production in the season is treated as a section. Most production's files include newspaper clippings, programs, photographs, promotional materials, and a video recording. Video formats include VHS cassettes, DVD discs, and digital video cassettes. All photographs after 2005 are black and white images printed on non-photographic paper. The production of 
                        <title render="italic">King Lear</title> in 2008 is the most well documented production in the collection. In addition to the normal array of materials it includes performance reports, production meeting reports, rehearsal reports, and set designs.</p>
