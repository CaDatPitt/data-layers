            <p>This collection contains nineteenth and twentieth century theatre programs from both New York City and elsewhere in the state of New York. The New York City programs are located in Series I and are filed chronologically. The New York state programs are filed alphabetically by theatre title in Series II.</p>
            <p>Please note that this collection does not represent all of the New York theatre programs in the Curtis Collection. There are many New York City programs prior to 1930 in our scrapbook collection.</p>

            <head>History</head>
            <p>The Ford E. and Harriet R. Curtis Theatre Collection contains a fantastic collection of New York theatre programs. Dr. Ford E. Curtis began teaching drama in the English department at the University of Pittsburgh in 1924. He and his wife, Harriet, were avid theatre goers. They would take frequent trips to New York City to see Broadway shows.</p>
            <p>In 1950, Dr. Curtis started a subscription to the opening night programs through 
                <title render="italic">Playbill.</title> He then began to file the programs along with corresponding reviews, photographs, and other clippings. After his retirement in 1961, he began to add to their personal collection of playbills and programs in the hopes of building a collection to donate to Pitt. He solicited the help of the New York Public Library's Theatre Collection. For a period of about twelve years the Curtis Collection received fifteen to twenty boxes of duplicates from the NYPL. These contained programs, scrapbooks, photographs, journals, and scripts. Thousands of items in this and other Curtis collections are stamped DUPL NYPL.</p>
            <p>The materials that Dr. Curtis amassed -- his own collection, materials donated to him, and the Curtis Collection staff's current efforts to acquire additional programs -- help to document the history of theatre and the performing arts.</p>

                        <p>The Broadway programs collection is broken into three organizational schemes. There are two folders of programs without dates; these are filed alphabetically. The nineteenth century and early twentieth century programs are filed by the date printed in the program. From 1943 to the current Broadway season, all the programs of a specific production's run are filed chronologically by it's opening night date. These dates are usually printed in the program. When they are not, staff use 
                            <title render="italic">Theatre World</title> and the 
                            <extref ns2:href="http://www.ibdb.com/">Internet Broadway Database</extref> to determine a production's opening night. Finally, there is a small amount of programs without dates. These are primarily nineteenth century programs and they are filed at the start of the series alphabetically by their title.</p>
                        <p>Supplementary to the programs, there are newspaper clippings, marketing materials, and memorabilia related to productions in the folders. These materials are available for the programs dating from the mid 1950s through the mid 1980s.</p>

                        <p>The Off-Broadway programs are filed chronologically by the date of the program. When there were no dates printed on the programs, the productions were researched to find out when the opening night was and filed under that date. The programs which we found no opening night information for are arranged in alphabetical order by the name of the venue they were performed at. Also filed in with the Off-Broadway materials were a small amount of programs from other New York City boroughs.</p>
