He was active as a public school educator in the Arnold, Pennsylvania, Public School System between 1928 and 1942. In 1942, he joined the United States Army, Special Services, and served with distinction until the end of the war in 1945. He was awarded the Legion of Merit in 1946. After the war he moved to New York City and worked as an editor between 1945 and 1947 and then returned to the University of Pittsburgh. Between 1947 and 1952, he served as a lecturer and then an instructor. In 1953 he was promoted to an Assistant Professor, Associate Professor in 1956, and eventually a full Professor in 1967, serving in that capacity until 1972. Dr. Laufe became a lecturer and radio speaker on theatre, musical comedy, and Hollywood music and continued in that capacity for many years. He was known as Pittsburgh's Victor Borge and authored numerous scholarly books and articles. Dr. Laufe died in Pittsburgh on February 9, 1984 after a long illness.</note>
