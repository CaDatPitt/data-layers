  <abstract type="Scope and content">The Records of the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust contain the organization's office files from the beginning, in 1984, to the opening of the O'Reilly Theater in 1999. The majority of the materials concern the restoration of the Stanley Theatre and its reopening as the Benedum Center for the Performing Arts, the settlement files for every show that performed at the Benedum Center from its opening in 1987 to 1998, the development of the Cultural District between Penn and Liberty Avenues, the planning and construction of the O'Reilly Theater, and finally the advertising and marketing information for a majority of the productions presented by the Cultural Trust as well as the marketing of the Trust itself. The vast majority of the collection are office files, but there are a few other types of materials, including photographs, slides, ledgers, newspaper clippings, and architectural designs.</abstract>

  <note type="biographical/historical">In the early 1970s a group of prominent Pittsburghers led by H. J. Heinz II began an effort to return the Penn Avenue-Liberty Avenue corridor of downtown Pittsburgh to the thriving theater district it once was. This area had been in steady decline since the 1950s. The era of the Nixon, Stanley, Alvin and Pitt Theatres had long since passed. They all were demolished, dormant, or in disrepair. The Howard Heinz Endowment funded the renovation of the Loew's Penn Theater in 1967. In 1971, Heinz Hall was unveiled as the new home of the Pittsburgh Symphony Society. In 1984, this group officially created the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust with the goal of creating a cultural district in downtown Pittsburgh. Their current mission statement is "to stimulate the economic and cultural development of Pittsburgh through the development and promotion of a downtown arts and entertainment district. The Trust encourages and presents diverse performing and visual arts programs in the Cultural District." The Trust purchased the Stanley Theatre and completely renovated it. It was renamed the Benedum Center for the Performing Arts and was dedicated in 1987. After the $43 million project was completed, the Cultural Trust began to develop other properties in and around Penn and Liberty Avenues. Jack Heinz named Carol Brown as the Trust's first president in 1986. She served until her retirement in 2001 when Kevin McMahon, former executive vice president of the John F. Kennedy Center, was named as the new president. The Trust offers assistance and provides services to Pittsburgh local arts community. It organizes free quarterly gallery crawls through the Cultural District, internship opportunities, and student and teacher workshops. Other businesses and organizations located in the Cultural District have joined the Cultural Trust in the revitalization project of the Penn-Liberty Historic District. The Trust has facÌ§ade restoration grants available to buildings that are within the Cultural District to help improve the overall appearance of the district. The Trust and the city of Pittsburgh have spent millions of dollars on beautification and improvements in the Cultural District. The theatre renovations, art installations, and other improvements all led to the creation of the Cultural District, which was designated a national historic district in 1987. The newest addition to the Cultural District is the O'Reilly Theater, completed in 1999. The 650 seat theater was designed by Michael Graves and is the home of the Pittsburgh Public Theater.</note>
