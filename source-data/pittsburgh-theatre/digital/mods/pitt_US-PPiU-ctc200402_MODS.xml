  <abstract type="Scope and content">This collection includes two series of materials. The first is a set of operational files that are arranged chronologically from 1950 to 1995. There are a few years in the 1950s and 1960s that do not have any records attributed to them. Each yearly file of records contains some or all of the following materials: programs, newspaper clippings, photographs, slides, financial reports, press releases, and promotional materials. The second series consists of twelve scrapbooks that contain newspaper clippings and photographs from the period of 1950 to 1986. Some of the newspaper clippings, photographs, and programs are duplicated in the two series. Other times there is only information on a given year or production in one of the series and not the other.</abstract>

  <note type="biographical/historical">The Sherwood Forest Theatre was founded in Murrysville in 1950. The Theatre's productions were staged in a 100 year old barn on the property of its founders Joseph and Alphretta DeSimone. Throughout its years, Sherwood performed small, but quality community theatre. Each season, between six to nine productions were performed over the summer months. The productions ranged from light-hearted comedies and musicals to serious drama and politically themed plays. Sherwood became a non-profit incorporation in 1958. In 1973, the daughter of the DeSimones, Joy Tobin, became the producing director. She began the process of applying for and receiving state and federal funding for the theatre, which paid for staffing and production costs. In 1980, the Theatre's Board of Trustees created Sherwood's mission statement: "The Sherwood Forest Theatre is a not-for-profit, incorporated community theatre committed to providing, through professional leadership: 1. Quality theatre for its audiences. 2. The opportunity for participation by all members of our community without regard to age, sex, race, or religion. 3. Additional educational experiences in theatre arts for all ages. 4. The enhancement of the cultural growth of the area population." In the late 1980s, federal funding became more scarce as the United States slipped into a recession. The Sherwood Forest Theatre ceased operations at the end of its 1994 season due to financial difficulties.This collection includes two series of materials. The first is a set of operational files that are arranged chronologically from 1950 to 1995. There are a few years in the 1950s and 1960s that do not have any records attributed to them. Each yearly file of records contains some or all of the following materials: programs, newspaper clippings, photographs, slides, financial reports, press releases, and promotional materials. The second series consists of twelve scrapbooks that contain newspaper clippings and photographs from the period of 1950 to 1986.
