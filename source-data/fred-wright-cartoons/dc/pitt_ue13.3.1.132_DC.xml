  <dc:subject>Strikes</dc:subject>
  <dc:description>This cartoon describes the largest labor movement due to the &quot;big three&quot; unions going on strike because of low wages and bad working conditions. Caption 1:  In January, 1946, members of UE struck plants of General Electric, Westinghouse and the electrical  division of General Motors. One week later, 800,000 steel workers responded to the strike call of their union. A few weeks before the UE strike started, United Auto Worker members in the General Motors plants had gone on strike. This was the biggest coordinated strike movement in the history of the United States.  Caption 2:  The corporations, biggest in the country, had used the World War II emergency to gorge themselves on profit, taking advantage of the working people&apos;s determination to defeat fascism. They held down wages and undermined working conditions. Inspired by the actions of the &quot;big three&quot; of the labor movement, unions which had come into being only a decade before, tens of thousands of workers in other unions also struck.  Caption 3:  As monumental as was this unprecedented strike wave, was the outpouring of support for the strikers. Numerous city governments endorsed the UE strikes. Fifty-five U.S. senators and congressmen put their names to a public statement which said: &quot;UE strikers deserve full moral and financial support in their grim struggle for a substantial wage increase and for a decent American standard of living.&quot; UE News, Vol. XXXVII, Issue No. 22</dc:description>
