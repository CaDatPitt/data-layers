  <dc:title>Labor History - 149: Bills to Legalize Blacklist</dc:title>

  <dc:description>During the 1950&apos;s, bills were being passed to blacklist unions in effort to restrain their power. Caption 1:  The corporate-political hookup against militant unionists which hit at GE workers was being duplicated in other companies and other industries in 1953-54. While GE was firing workers who had been dragged before the McCarthy committee, Westinghouse was singling out as &quot;undesirable&quot; long-time employees who failed to satisfy the anti-labor House UnAmerican Activities Committee. Seamen, communications workers, auto workers and many others were being hit.  Caption 2:  While congressional committees continued to invade the major industrial centers to smash workers&apos; ability to fight unemployment and employer anti-labor conspiracies, a barrel full of bills was being pushed in Congress to establish nationwide blacklists of unions and union members. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce wrote that &quot;1954 may well be the last chance for a number of years&quot; for big business to tie up the labor movement&apos;s ability to resist employers.  Caption 3:  One bill, proposed by Atty.-Gen. Herbert Brownell, of Eisenhower&apos;s cabinet, and introduced by then Rep. Barry Goldwater, would have given the government the authority to dissolve unions, religious organizations, newspapers, radio stations or businesses on the pretext that they were &quot;communist-dominated.&quot; The AFL saw this bill as opening the door to &quot;abuse by employers.&quot; The Mine Workers said it could lead to breaking down &quot;the whole wage structure and working conditions&quot; in an industry.
