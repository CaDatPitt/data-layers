  <dc:description>This cartoon depicts the struggle unions faced to even be recognized as organizations and their employers&apos;  tactic of creating a &quot;red scare&quot;  in which strikes were considered to be Moscow-inspired. Caption 1:  While the World War I strike wave subsided for a while it swelled to tremendous proportions as soon as the war ended. The cost of living had doubled in five years, real wages had gone up only 14 percent. In 1919 about 4 million workers struck to try to recover some of the lost ground. Groups which had never had strikes came out.  Caption 2:  Recognition of unions as bargaining representatives was also a major issue. The companies started to take back concessions on this granted under wartime pressure. A National Industrial Conference called by Pres. Wilson on this issue in 1919 collapsed when corporation chiefs including John D. Rockefeller, Jr. and Albert H. Gary, head of U.S. Steel, rejected all recognition of national unionism.  Caption 3:  Instead of granting unions the right to exist, the corporations inspired a nationwide &quot;red scare&quot; branding strikes as Moscow-inspired. The Bolshevik revolution had occurred in late 1917 and from then on American employers and their political aides were quick to blame the Russians for U.S. strikes. The biggest strike found 365,000 steel workers out in September, 1919. UE News, Volume XXXV, Issue No. 9</dc:description>
