  <dc:description>This cartoon depicts the AFL&apos;s approach to sit-ins by the CIO unions, kicking them out of the AFL in 1936. Caption 1:  Production had been halted but the men refused to leave the Firestone plant as Akron, Ohio rubber workers were trying a new method of fighting back--the sit-down strike. Food was sent in to them by their families. After three days and nights they had won a pay increase and other demands. The AFL had said such workers could not be organized. Before a year had passed close to half a million working people had been in sit-down strikes.  Caption 2:  And many were singing a song written by Detroit Attorney Maurice Sugar: When they tie the can to a union man, Sit down! Sit down! When they give him the sack, they&apos;ll take him back, Sit down! Sit down! When the speed-up comes, just twiddle your thumbs, Sit down! Sit down! When the boss won&apos;t talk, don&apos;t take a walk, Sit down! Sit down!  Caption 3:  This new strike tactic was branded as &quot;communistic&quot; by the employers, the press, the AFL officials. &quot;Communists Rule the CIO&quot; John Frey, head of the AFL Metal Trades Dept. told the Un-American Committee. He named &quot;248 Reds&quot; as running the CIO unions. In the fall of 1936, the unions of the Committee for Industrial Organization were thrown out of the AFL.
