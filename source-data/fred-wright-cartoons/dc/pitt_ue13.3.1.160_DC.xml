  <dc:description>This cartoon describes the battle between the UE and the Westinghouse company regarding the inclusion of a no-discrimination clause in their contract. Caption 1:  UE had made the incorporation of a no-discrimination clause in all its contracts a major demand at all negotiations. While much progress had been made by 1957, Westinghouse still resisted. Writing to the company that year to demand such a clause, Director of Organization Matles noted that 75 percent of UE&apos;s contracts already contained no-discrimination clauses.  Caption 2:  Again, the company refused. It admitted that in order to get government contracts it had to agree not to discriminate against workers. But the company stated that the government&apos;s representatives were &quot;reasonable&quot; when it came to enforcing equal rights while the UE would not be once it succeeded in getting such a clause into its Westinghouse contract.  Caption 3:  The UE demand received wide publicity and won the support of many noted people who wrote to the company on behalf of the union&apos;s demand. The following year, UE demanded an end to discrimination against married women by Westinghouse noting that when a woman had to take a temporary leave because of pregnancy she was fired and deprived of all seniority rights, regardless of length of service.
