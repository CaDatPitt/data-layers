  <dc:description>This cartoon describes the hardships of the unemployed and the increase in union membership during the Great Depression. Caption 1:  Seven years had elapsed since the outbreak of the worst economic crisis in U.S. history when UE and other CIO unions were bringing organization to millions of unorganized workers in 1936. Various government programs had created jobs for millions of unemployed on public works, in the building of homes, in creation of the Tennessee Valley Authority for public power and flood control.  Caption 2:  But large numbers of workers remained unemployed. For the employers this pool of unemployed was a weapon they used to depress the working conditions of those fortunate enough to have jobs. The employers and their organizations fought the government public works&apos; programs, said they were steps towards socialism, boondoggling operations and the workers employed on them just &quot;leaning on their shovels.&quot;  Caption 3:  Initially the heavy unemployment tended to discourage workers from joining unions but speedup and wage cuts made workers realize that they needed unions. In 1938 the UE organized 28 plants including GE plants, Allis Chalmers, Singer Sewing Machine, American Machine &amp;amp; Foundry, about 30,000 workers. At the first CIO convention that year, Pres. John L. Lewis cited the UE achievements, including the first national agreement with GE as evidence of CIO accomplishments. UE News, Vol. XXXVII, Issue No. 8</dc:description>
