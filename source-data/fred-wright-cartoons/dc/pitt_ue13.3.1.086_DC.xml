  <dc:title>Labor History - 86: The Progressive Party</dc:title>

  <dc:description>This cartoon depicts how the Progressive Party was formally endorsed by the AFL but the organization did little to help with the LaFollette-Wheeler campaign: the party won 5 million votes anyway. Caption 1:  The Progressive Party candidates favored public ownership of the country&apos;s water power, railroads, tax reduction on the lower incomes and abolition of the injunction in labor disputes. When both old parties refused to recognize labor&apos;s demands, the AF L reluctantly agreed to support the third party. The AFL had always, up until then, supported the two major parties.  Caption 2:  This time the executive council found that the two old parties had &quot;flouted the desires of labor&quot; are &quot;in a condition of moral bankruptcy which constitutes a menace and a peril to our country and its institutions.&quot; Many AFL leaders, however, supported the Republicans and backed the Republican Coolidge. Others backed the Wall Street lawyer John W. Davis.  Caption 3:  The AFL contributed a meager $25,000 to the LaFollette campaign. Outside of the formal endorsement, it did little to back the Progressive Party. Yet the new party, without any machinery, drew 5 million votes. As soon as the election was over, the AFL withdrew its support from the Conference for Progressive Political Action, which had launched the LaFollette-Wheeler candidacy.
