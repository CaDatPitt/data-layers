  <dc:title>Labor History - 141: Labor&apos;s Ranks Divided</dc:title>

  <dc:subject>Politics and Legislation</dc:subject>
  <dc:description>This cartoon describes the anti-labor laws and policies and how they were upheld in the work force. Caption 1:  The UE and other unions which insisted on up-holding the founding principles of that organization were the subject of raids on their membership by sister unions even before the Taft-Hartley law was enacted. First those unions helped create the climate for passage of the anti-labor law by splitting the ranks of labor; then after denouncing the law they used it as a weapon to disorganize the organized.  Caption 2:  Mineworker Pres. John L. Lewis had said of those union leaders who agreed to live with the Taft-Hartley law that they were &quot;kneeling in obeisance,&quot; before a &quot;detestable and tyrannical statue.&quot; Now those leaders encouraged the anti-labor congressional committees to wage war on the democratic rights of working people. As the anti-labor propaganda poured out of committee rooms, corporations stood ready to further the divisions in labor&apos;s ranks.  Caption 3:  Corporations, such as GE, decreed that any worker who failed to satisfy the anti-labor politicians would be fired automatically. Union leaders who refused to abide by the Taft-Hartley law restrictions on labor&apos;s political independence  were cited for contempt of congress, subjected to violent denunciations by the press and in a number of instances sent to jail. Labor organization came to a halt. UE News, Vol. XXXVIII, Issue No. 6</dc:description>
