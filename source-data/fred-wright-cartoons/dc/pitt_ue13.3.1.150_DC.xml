  <dc:title>Labor History - 150: Senator Parallels Hitler</dc:title>

  <dc:description>This cartoon describes Senator McCarthy&apos;s attacks to destroy the free labor movement. Caption 1:  Sen. Joe McCarthy&apos;s so-called attacks on the &quot;communist menace&quot; spread beyond radical groups, trade unions, and liberals. He began going after the Democratic Party and his own Republican Party as helpers of the communist cause. Members of President Eisenhower&apos;s cabinet soon were being assailed for the same reason and finally, the U.S. Army leadership including World War II Chief of Staff Gen. Marshall.  Caption 2:  Many of those who had been willing to countenance McCarthy&apos;s wild-swinging attacks on radicals and liberals were frightened. Vermont Sen. Ralph Flanders, a liberal Republican, charged in a number of speeches that McCarthy was following a course parallel to Hitler&apos;s. Flanders recalled  that &quot;Hitler exploited the issue of communism,&quot; as the opening wedge in his drive for power.  Caption 3:  Flanders warned that McCarthy, like Hitler, aimed at destroying the free labor movement. He noted that McCarthy had defended the &quot;Nazi ruffians&quot; who massacred American prisoners of war in World War II. Flanders proposed that the Senate censure McCarthy. But too many Republicans and quite a few Democrats were not willing to follow that course, including Senators Nixon and Goldwater. UE News, Vol. XXXVIII, Issue No. 16</dc:description>
