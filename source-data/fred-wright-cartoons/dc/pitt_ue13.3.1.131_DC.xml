  <dc:description>This cartoon depicts the attacks that the working class witnessed after World War II ended due to the high amount of layoffs and diminishing wages. Caption 1:  The war which Hitler had begun in Europe in 1939 came to an end in May 1945 as the Red Army from the  East and the allied forces of the United States and Great Britain from the West, crushing the Nazi armies between them, met at the Elbe River in Germany. Full attention was turned to defeating Japan, the remaining member of the German-Italian-Japanese axis which had begun the war in the name of defeating communism.  Caption 2:  With the major part of the war over, U.S. employers, bloated with wartime profiteering, launched their offensive against working people. Mass layoffs of those who had produced the war goods, chiseling on wages and conditions which had already suffered heavily during the war was commonplace. The war-induced price increases were pressing down on living standards. Working people were preparing to fight back.  Caption 3:  The leadership of the big three of the CIO, the UE, Steelworkers and Auto Workers, began considering ways of responding to the needs of their members. Separately in their own union conferences and together in a beginning of common action, these unions began planning for a united fight against the most powerful corporations in the country.
