  <dc:title>Labor History - 124: Depression in Europe</dc:title>

  <dc:description>This cartoon describes how in Europe large corporations would fund organizations and leaders to destroy the labor movement by force during the Great Depression. Caption 1:  The economic depression which had hit the United States in 1929 had also hit hard at the other western industrial nations including Great Britain, Germany, Italy, and Spain. Many millions of people starved. Huge corporations went bankrupt, major banks collapsed dragging down entire nations and revealing widespread governmental corruption which had contributed to bringing about the worst economic crisis the world had ever seen.   Caption 2:  Wherever working people began demanding relief from the terrible conditions through their unions and in vast new political movements, big business financed organizations and leaders to smash the labor organizations and political movements which represented the people. The German monopolies financed Hitler&apos;s Nazi movement which used brutal terror and race hatred to smash the German labor movement.   Caption 3:  German fascism became the source of anti-democratic infection which swept across Europe. When the Spanish people established their first democratic government in 1936, a clique of militarists led by Gen. Franco gained the support of Hitler and the Italian fascist leader Mussolini in waging a bloody three year war to overthrow the Spanish government. The new CIO was deeply concerned over these developments. UE News, Vol. XXXVII, Issue No. 9</dc:description>
