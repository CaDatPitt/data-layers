  <dc:description>After the Civil War labor realized the need for national organization and formed the National Labor Union in 1866.  It&apos;s main goal was the 8-hour day, which President Andrew Johnson signed into law. Caption 1:  Union soldiers returning from the Civil War found unemployment facing them. There were growing demands for an eight-hour day instead of the 10 being worked. Labor saw the need for national organization. The answer was a national congress which formed the National Labor Union (1866-Baltimore). Of the 60,000 represented, many came from eight-hour day leagues and local unions.  Caption 2:  Organization of the unorganized, independent political action of labor and the eight-hour day were the key resolutions adopted. In the months following there were many successes. &quot;Seven workingmen or other good citizens,&quot; wrote an NLU organizer, &quot;who favor our views...can form a union.&quot; The Ohio chairman wrote of having set up 20 unions. By 1869 membership was set at 600,000 in the NLU.  Caption 3:  The 1866 meeting set up a committee to see President Andrew Johnson on the eight-hour day, on ending convict labor and keeping public lands out of the hands of speculators. Two years later the organization had proven its worth. Congress voted for an eight-hour day for all in government employ. It was 28 years since President Van Buren had ordered a 10-hour day for federal employees. UE News, Vol. XXXIII, Issue No. 12</dc:description>
