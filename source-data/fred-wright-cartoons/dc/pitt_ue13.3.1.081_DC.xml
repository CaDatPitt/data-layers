  <dc:description>This cartoon shows how railway workers strike when railroad control is returned to private business after the First World War and workers immediately suffered wage cuts.  A federal injunction was used against them. Caption 1:  The end of the first World War saw the nation&apos;s railroads returned to private ownership. The roads had been government operated during the war emergency. A Railway Labor Board was set up to keep labor peace on the roads. In 1920 this board cancelled all contracts, did away with overtime pay and announced a $60 million wage cut for the railway shopmen.  Caption 2:  The members of six of the railway crafts voted to strike on July 1, 1922. Another union went for arbitration while the Brotherhoods which were spared the wage cut, in a typical divide and conquer scheme, declared themselves above the battle. The 400,000 strikers were declared &quot;outlaws&quot; by the Board. The non-striking unions joined the employer drive to keep the trains running and break the strike. Strikebreakers were hired from among college students and others.  Caption 3:  Militia, deputized gunmen went to work on pickets and the federal government mobilized its legal powers to smash the strike. President Harding&apos;s attorney general applied for a federal injunction. This was granted and the strikers were barred from holding any meetings, issuing statements, spending the union&apos;s fund for the strike and the leaders even denied the right to communicate with each other.
