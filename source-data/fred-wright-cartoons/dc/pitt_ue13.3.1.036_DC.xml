  <dc:description>This cartoon depicts the massive demonstrations that occurred throughout the country demanding work, food, and shelter.  Some demonstrations became violent, such as Tomkins Square in New York in 1874. Caption 1:  To meet the financial panic New York unions in December, 1873 called a conference on unemployment. Result was demands for an 8-hour day to provide more jobs and for a $30,000 limit on wealth owned by any individual. Then the unemployed warned the city that they would take proper food and shelter &quot;and we will send our bills to the City Treasury, to be liquidated, until we shall obtain work and pay for our work.&quot;  Caption 2:  Other cities acted similarly. Everywhere the 8-hour day was the top demand. Twenty thousand marched on Chicago&apos;s City Hall demanding that money left over from the Chicago fire aid society be turned over. In an attempt at frightening the demonstrators, they were told that only those who would submit to vaccination would be helped. The rush to the doctors smashed this ruse. The money was paid out.  Caption 3:  But the City Council in Chicago never met the demand of the people for &quot;bread for the needy, clothing for the naked, and houses for the homeless.&quot; A peaceful demonstration in New York&apos;s Tompkins Square on Jan., 1874 was attacked by the police. Many were clubbed and trampled. Hundreds were seriously injured and some arrested--to be sentenced later for attacking the police. UE News, Vol. XXXIII, Issue No. 19</dc:description>
