  <dc:title>Labor History - 126: Independent Political Action</dc:title>

  <dc:description>This cartoon describes the workers involvement in independent political movements in the 1930&apos;s. Caption 1:  Along with the development of the industrial unions and the struggles of the unemployed through their councils and alliances, there was a parallel development of independent political action by working people. Other sections of the population including farmers and professionals who were inspired by the new labor movement&apos;s militant stand joined in helping to build various forms of independent political action.  Caption 2:  Some of the new independent political movements of the 1930&apos;s emphasized support of the candidates and policies of the Roosevelt administration. Others leaned towards developing their own political platforms, often more radical than the administration&apos;s, and presented the voters with their own candidates. Such independent political action, whatever the form, helped overcome conservative or employer pressure on the government.  Caption 3:  Among the independent political movements which won extensive support, electing many state and national legislators, mayors and governors, were the American Labor Party in New York State; the Minnesota Farmer-Labor Party; the Washington Commonwealth Federation. Such movements pushed the legislative interests of working people and fought anti-labor groups such as the Black Legion, and Silver Shirts, modeled after Hitler&apos;s Nazi gangs.
