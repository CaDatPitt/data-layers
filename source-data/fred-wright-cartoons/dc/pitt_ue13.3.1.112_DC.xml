  <dc:description>The fifth cartoon in the Sit-Down In Auto Plants series. This cartoon depicts the victory of the strikers over the GM plant.   Caption 1:  Michigan Gov. Murphy could not bring himself to clear the GM plants with troops. The corporation officials had tried everything and failed to frighten the sit-down strikers. On the 44th day of the strike one of the most powerful corporations in the United States admitted defeat and announced its readiness to recognize the rights of its employees to engage in collective bargaining.  Caption 2:  It was hard for men who had been inside the Chevrolet plants for well over a month to realize that they were about to go home. But the union leaders gave the word and the factory whistles blew. Gathering up their sox, extra shirts and underwear into bundles, the auto strikers marched out to be met by thousands of other workers and members of their families. They formed into a parade and marched through the streets of Flint.  Caption 3:  Fisher body plant No. 1 strikers marched to Plant No. 2 where they were joined by strikers coming out of there. Their first union contract brought the workers raises of 30 cents and 40 cents an hour. Auto industry wages rose by $300,000,000 in one year and the union&apos;s membership increased from 30,000 members to 500,000 in that year. Men who led that first big battle such as Wyndham Mortimer and Bob Travis were in a few years to be thrown out of the union as &quot;reds.&quot; UE News, Vol. XXXVI, Issue No. 23</dc:description>
