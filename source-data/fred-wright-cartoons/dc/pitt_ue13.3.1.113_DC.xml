  <dc:title>Labor History - 113: Steel Workers Organize</dc:title>

  <dc:description>This cartoon depicts the beginnings of the steel unions and their formation in the late 1930&apos;s. Caption 1:  The smashing victory over the General Motors Corp. was the start of a vast organizing campaign in the previously, almost totally, unorganized auto industry. Meanwhile similarly unorganized workers in the electrical, maritime, transport, steel and other industries were building their organizations. In 1919 a large group of AFL craft unions had been brought into a steel organizing drive under the leadership of William Z. Foster and John Fitzpatrick.  Caption 2:  That effort had been smashed by thugs, police, militia, and finally, the inability and unwillingness of the craft unions to stick together. Now, in 1937, a Steel Workers Organizing Committee was set up. It called on veteran mine worker organizers, on some who had had experience in the 1919 fiasco, on old time steel workers, regardless of political views, to unite to smash the opposition of the steel corporations to unions.  Caption 3:  Besides the paid organizers some 5,000 volunteered to help the SWOC. Tremendous fear had to be overcome as the steelworkers recalled the old terror, the blacklists. With the workers&apos; victory at GM fresh in the country&apos;s mind, the chairman of the United States Steel Corp. accepted John L. Lewis&apos; bid for union recognition. But the big battle was still to come. The so-called Little Steel companies were stockpiling munitions, assembling armed men, spies to fight off the  forthcoming union bid at Youngstown Sheet, Inland Steel and Republic Steel.
