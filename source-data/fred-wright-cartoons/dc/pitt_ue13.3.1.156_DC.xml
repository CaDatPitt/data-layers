  <dc:description>This cartoon depicts the attempt by employers and politicians to have one of the UE&apos;s prominent leaders, James J. Matles, deported in an attempt to weaken the Westinghouse strikers. Caption 1:  As Westinghouse workers battled on the picket lines for an acceptable contract, in 1955-56, corporate-controlled politicians schemed to wreck the UE. Besides instituting proceedings to have the union outlawed by the Subversive Activities Control Board, Atty.-Gen. Brownell, a Wall St. lawyer, pushed a plan to cancel the citizenship of Director of Org. James J. Matles as prelude to having him deported. Matles had already been a citizen for 22 years when these proceedings began.  Caption 2:  The plot to deprive the workers in the electrical manufacturing  industry of Matles&apos; leadership had been initiated by the notorious Wisconsin Sen. Joe McCarthy several years earlier, before the Senate censured him. Appearing before McCarthy, on his own insistence, Matles had stung the fascist-minded senator by calling him a liar to his face. &quot;Let&apos;s ... get this man deported,&quot; the enraged McCarthy roared to his aide, Roy Cohn. Three years later Brownell took the attack on Matles to court.  Caption 3:  The attacks on the UE and its leaders did not discourage the Westinghouse strikers. In February 1956, the company got a judge in Delaware County to send 26 leaders of the strike at Local 107, Essington, Pa., to jail and to fine them $22,000 plus a $5,000 fine on the local union. The union leaders marched to jail accompanied by more than 500 workers-strikers and members of the Steelworkers, Seafarers, Textile Workers, Transport Workers, and other unions. This, after 18 weeks on strike. UE News, Vol. XXXVIII, Issue No. 23</dc:description>
