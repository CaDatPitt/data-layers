  <dc:title>Labor History - 106: Victory At RCA</dc:title>

  <dc:description>This cartoon depicts the strike against the RCA led by the CIO. Caption 1:  RCA Pres. David Sarnoff had refused to negotiate with the representatives of the new UE organization at the company&apos;s Camden, N.J. plant. He claimed that CIO head John L. Lewis had pledged there would be no strike. Getting into a car, the unionists drove all night to a small Pennsylvania coal mining town to check with Lewis. The miners&apos; leader denied any such promise.   Caption 2:  Word went back to Camden and the next morning 6,000 RCA workers were out. This was the beginning of one of the toughest battles in labor history. Before it was over RCA was to have spent $244,390, according to a research organization, to fight the UE. About half of this was paid out to a notorious detective agency which hired scabs, armed thugs, criminals to attack the strikers.  Caption 3:  The thugs were associated with state troopers, and 1,000 city police who were just as devoted to the RCA cause of stopping unionism. Bail for the arrested 175 strikers added up to $2 million. The hospitals received a steady, almost daily, stream of battered and beaten strikers. For four weeks these new unionists fought the terror-and won. UE News, Vol. XXXVI, Issue No. 16</dc:description>
