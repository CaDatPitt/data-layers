  <dc:description>This cartoon describes two important victories for the UE in 1957-1959.  The Supreme Court ruled in favor of the UE in both cases. Caption 1:  UE scored decisive victories in the fight for free trade unionism in the years 1957-59. Outstanding were the defeats of the attempts to deprive Director of Organization James J. Matles of his citizenship as a step towards deporting him, and the dropping of the Justice Department&apos;s move to have the union outlawed on &quot;communism&quot; charges through the Subversive Activities Control Board, an action undertaken by the Wall Street lawyer, Herbert Brownell who was Eisenhower&apos;s attorney-general.  Caption 2:  Both cases had been launched during the 1955-56 Westinghouse strike. When Matles refused to supply the Justice Dept. with information to be used against him in the court, he was sentenced to serve a jail term on contempt charges. Witnesses called to testify against him in the denaturalization proceedings were exposed as liars under cross-examination. Appealed to the Supreme Court, the contempt conviction was thrown out as were the denaturalization proceedings.  Caption 3:  The Supreme Court found that the Justice Dept. had acted lawlessly and illegally. The first witness called to prove Brownell&apos;s communism charge against the union had been caught lying in another case. He had boasted, &quot;I had to decide whether to lie or steal. So I figured that a lie could always be justified and stealing couldn&apos;t.&quot; He was shown up, also, as a depraved individual. Brownell&apos;s successor as attorney-general, William F. Rogers, in 1959 asked that the case against the UE be dropped because he had no witnesses to make a case. UE News, Vol. XXXIX, Issue No. 2</dc:description>
