  <dc:subject>Strikes, Scabs</dc:subject>
  <dc:description>This cartoon depicts various issues regarding the Lynn Shoemakers&apos; Strike: including both women and men&apos;s fight for higher wages and the attempt employers made to use scabs. Caption 1:  From the 3,000 Lynn Shoemakers on strike, groups fanned out in 1860 to get support throughout New England. In a few days Mechanics&apos; Associations had been set up in 25 towns and about 20,000 shoeworkers in Mass., New Hampshire and Maine were out against $3-a-week wages. To the newspapers this was &quot;Revolution at the North.&quot; &quot;The Rebellion Among the Workmen, Beginning of the Conflict Between Capital and Labor.&quot;  Caption 2:  Weekly wages for women were as low as $1. They were compared to the &quot;amiable females&quot; of the French Revolution. Parading in Marblehead they carried such signs as &quot;American Ladies Will Not Be Slaves,&quot; &quot;Weak in Physical Strength But Strong in Moral Courage.&quot; Lynn employers persuaded the mayor to call out the light infantry and import Boston police. 800 people massed at the railroad station to denounce the invaders.  Caption 3:  Attempts to line up Germans and Irish to scab failed; so did appeals for Negro scabs. A Negro minister told his congregation: &quot;You, my colored brethren, know how to sympathize with labor unrequited.&quot; Many employers agreed to settle but not to recognize the union. Some strikers returned with a 10 percent raise and no contract. Others got signed agreements. After about six weeks the strike was called off and the basis laid for permanent organization.
