  <dc:description>This cartoon describes how laborers reached a striking frenzy during WWI, when big business owners were profiteering. Caption 1:  While the miners and the needle trade workers were achieving many organizing successes through industrial unions, the AFL stuck to its craft set-up and continued to ignore the developing steel, automobile, electrical, meat packing and other mass production industries. Ninety percent of the workers remained unorganized before the first World War and nothing was being done about it by the AFL.  Caption 2:  The old-line leaders ridiculed the efforts of the IWW and anyone else who urged industrial organization. Efforts to keep workers from striking during World War I failed as profiteers ran away with prices. In addition, such noted labor leaders as Eugene Debs branded the war as one for profits. By the end of 1917, over a million workers had struck, more than at any time before the war.  Caption 3:  The amount of profiteering in the war years was emphasized by the making of 20,000 new millionaires in the United States. After the war President Wilson told a public meeting that &quot;this was commercial and industrial war.&quot; (Sept. 5, 1919.) With labor in ferment, it was natural that employers would seek to repress them and wherever possible get subservient politicians to help them. The Tom Mooney-Warren Billings case was one of the results. UE News, Volume XXXV, Issue No. 6</dc:description>
