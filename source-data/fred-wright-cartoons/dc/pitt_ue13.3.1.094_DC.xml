  <dc:description>This cartoon illustrates the desperate counter-measures employers were taking in reaction to rising union organization, like hiring spies to weed out union members and buying stocks of weapons in the case of a strike. Caption 1:  As hundreds of thousands of workers sought union organization, the corporations developed a nation-wide counterdrive of company unions and spies. The LaFollette Senate Committee study estimated that starting in 1934 corporations spent $80 million a year for spies and associated measures to destroy unions. This paid for an estimated 100,000 labor spies.  Caption 2:  Engaged by 230 detective agencies these spies were reported to have wormed their way into every local union in the country. Union plans were reported to the corporations, union members&apos; names turned over to the bosses for firing. General Motors admitted that it spent $419,850 with the Pinkerton spy agency between Jan., 1934 and July, 1936 and more than another half million with other agencies.  Caption 3:  Westinghouse, RCA, United Shoe Machinery were among the other big spy hirers. Workers on whom the spies informed were blacklisted and couldn&apos;t find jobs elsewhere. Many companies laid in stocks of tear gas, munitions and arms to use against their employees in case of strikes or lockout. In three years over a million dollars was spent by them for arms.
