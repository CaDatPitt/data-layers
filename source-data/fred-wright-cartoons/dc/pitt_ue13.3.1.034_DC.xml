  <dc:subject>Union Organization, Equal Pay</dc:subject>
  <dc:description>This cartoon depicts the growth of the Knights of Labor and the union&apos;s forward thinking demands for equal pay for men and women. Caption 1:  When nine tailors gathered in Philadelphia in December, 1869 to form an organization, they started something which grew to over 700,000 by 1886. The Knights of Labor had such advance demands as &quot;equal pay for the sexes,&quot; prohibition of child labor, government ownership of railways and telegraphs, and a graduated income tax.  Caption 2:  The first president, or Grand Master Workman, as he was called, was Uriah S. Stephens, who had been trained for the Baptist ministry but became a tailor. His organizing ideas were vague and surrounded by mystical ideas. Stephens opposed strikes and objected to labor organizing by trades. After a few years he became interested in politics, ran for Congress on the Greenback ticket, lost and dropped away.  Caption 3:  Workers were invited to come to a Knights meeting without being told what it was. If they answered satisfactorily questions put to them on the &quot;elevation of labor,&quot; they were held eligible to join. Even the name of the organization was never mentioned in public so that no one would know it existed unless he was a member. When an &quot;assembly&quot; grew large, some would be allowed to &quot;swarm&quot; to form another group of Knights. UE News, Vol. XXXIII, Issue No. 16</dc:description>
