  <dc:description>This cartoon depicts businesses&apos; early attempts at outlawing unions by charging them in court with a conspiracy to raise wages. Caption 1:  With union organizations leading to higher wages (a painter&apos;s daily wage in Massachusetts was $1.15 in 1800) employers moved to outlaw them. Eight Philadelphia shoe workers were charged, in 1805, with forming &quot;a combination and conspiracy to raise wages&quot; through the Cordwainers Union. The prosecution argued that one worker could legally seek a wage increase but that it was illegal for two or more, to do so.  Caption 2:  Merchants, innkeepers, master tailors were among the jury and labor spy Job Harrison a chief witness. Among prosecution arguments were that industry would leave Philadelphia if the union continued; that the unions were made up of men &quot;who have been only a little time in your country&quot; and were already trying to change its laws. Witnesses were found to claim that union members had threatened their lives.  Caption 3:  Defense Attorney Rodney said neither the public&apos;s welfare nor patriotism was the issue, but employers&apos; profit. Many employers attended the trial. The men were found guilty of trying to raise wages. The fine was small, eight dollars each, but the heavy costs incurred broke the organization; it had to disband. In the next years similar trials were held in Pittsburgh, New York and Baltimore. Tough times were ahead. UE News, Vol. XVII, Issue No. 16</dc:description>
