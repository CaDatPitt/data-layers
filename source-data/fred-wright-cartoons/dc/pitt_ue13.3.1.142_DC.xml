  <dc:title>Labor History - 142: Split hurts Workers</dc:title>

  <dc:description>This cartoon describes how from 1949 to 1960 was a rough time period for the UE and workers wages and working conditions were diminishing. Caption 1:  Between 1949 and 1960, the American labor movement had become a battlefield in which the casualties were workers&apos; wages and working conditions. Workers in the electrical manufacturing industry who had, through UE, set the pace on wages, holidays, vacations and many other basic conditions were now falling behind the Steelworkers and the Auto Workers, two of the unions whose leaders led the attack on UE.  Caption 2:  At the end of World War II, UE had several hundred thousand members. By the time this unprecedented assault had run its course, the aim of the corporations to weaken the UE had been gained. In place of one powerful union of electrical workers, there were now many, none of them strong enough to take on the corporations alone and all of them battling each other for handfuls of members.
