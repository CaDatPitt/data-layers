  <dc:description>This cartoon depicts labor&apos;s movement to prevent bills from passing that would have jailed strikers for a year.  At the same time, employers cut wages drastically which prompted the call for a national organization. Caption 1:  The development of city trades&apos; assemblies during the Civil War gave labor the means of developing stronger political action. When the New York state legislature considered a bill to jail strikers for a year (1864), the N. Y. Trades&apos; Assembly held a big street meeting attended by 15,000. Speakers warned the legislators voting for the bill would be &quot;sent to hell&quot; in the next election.  Caption 2:  Similar gatherings and expressions in other cities helped defeat the bill just as labor action had licked an anti-strike bill in Massachusetts. But labor was not yet strong enough and employers were slashing wages. Massachusetts nail workers were cut 25%; Troy, N.Y. iron workers suffered a dollar a day wage cut. A national wage cut drive was now forcing a new action on labor.  Caption 3:  There was need for even greater strength and workers began thinking of national organizations. The Louisville, Ky. Trades&apos; Assembly issued a call for a national meeting of similar bodies. &quot;Are not capitalists and employers of almost every city organizing themselves into unions?&quot; the call asked. Although only eight central bodies sent delegates, the time was nearing when national organization would be established. UE News, Vol. XXXIII, Issue No. 11</dc:description>
