  <dc:title>Labor History - 106: Electrical Workers Organize I</dc:title>

  <dc:description>This cartoon depicts the beginnings of the union organization of the electrical workers in the 1930&apos;s. Caption 1:  Among the least organized industries in the United States in the 1930&apos;s was the electrical industry. While the radio industry was fairly new (television, of course, non-existent) electrical machinery and electric light bulb manufacture was of quite substantial size. Earlier organizing efforts in the big GE and Westinghouse companies had been smashed by the Wall Street-run corporations.  Caption 2:  At Westinghouse, for example, a strike for the 8-hour day in 1916 had been broken when the company called in troops and bombarded the community with wild charges about the subversive character of the East Pittsburgh Westinghouse workers. In 1935 several independent unions and AFL federal labor unions set up the Radio and Allied Trades Council and applied for an AFL national charter.  Caption 3:  The old-line AFL craft unions feared the power of the rising industrial union movement. They rejected the appeal of the group. The Machinists Union had its private empire; the IBEW its own. Moulders groups, toolmaker groups and others stood in the way of industrial unionism. The Radio Council was advised to disband and turn over its members to the existing unions. They refused and called a national convention. UE News, Vol. XXXVII, Issue No. 1</dc:description>
