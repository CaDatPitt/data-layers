  <dc:description>This cartoon depicts several strikes by women&apos;s unions in the 1830s. Caption 1:  Unions sprang UP all over the east coast and as far as St. Louis between 1833-37. More than 150 of them were set up in New York, Philadelphia, Boston. There were 168 strikes in that time. Of special note were the activities of the &quot;Ladies Unions.&quot; At Dover, N.H., 700 girls struck; at Lowell, Mass., a 15% wage cut led to 800 girls striking in 1834. They lost. Two years later wages were cut 12% and they were out again.  Caption 2:  Forming a factory girls assn., with 2,500 members, these Lowell workers marched through the streets singing: Oh, isn&apos;t it a pity that such a pretty girl as I, Should be sent to the factory to pine away and die? Oh! I cannot be a slave! I will not be a slave. For I&apos;m so fond of liberty, That I cannot be a slave.  Caption 3:  They were thrown out of the boarding houses, starved into surrender. Ordered to tend two looms, Amesbury girls stopped work and pledged &quot;under a forfeit of five dollars&quot; not to go back to work until the speed-up was dropped. They won. While some men objected to women&apos;s union activities, others held that &quot;unless we have the female sex on our side, we cannot hope to accomplish any object we have in view.&quot; UE News, Vol. XXXII, Issue No. 15</dc:description>
