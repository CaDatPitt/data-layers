  <dc:subject>Average Work Day, Union Organization</dc:subject>
  <dc:description>This cartoon depicts how the AFL and it&apos;s leader, Samuel Gompers, initiated a massive movement for the 8-hour work day all throughout the country.  Workers everywhere convened in mass meetings and demonstrated to show their support. Caption 1:  The newly-formed American Federation of Labor decided in 1888 to make the winning of the 8-hour day its prime aim. Pamphlets were to be printed, meetings held and the whole working people prepared for a general strike on May 1, 1890. Unorganized workers were called to set up Eight-Hour Leagues. A Slogan of the movement was: &quot;Eight hours for work, eight hours for rest, eight hours for what we will.&quot;  Caption 2:  On Washington&apos;s birthday, 1889, 240 mass meetings were held in as many cities which adopted 8-hour day resolutions. On July 4, 311 such meetings took place. On Labor Day the number had grown to 420. The AFL distributed over half a million circulars, 50,000 pamphlets. Pres. Samuel Gompers urged an International socialist meeting in Paris that year to mark May 1 as &quot;International Labor Day,&quot; the start of the 8-hour day.  Caption 3:  After further consideration it was decided to forego a general strike but to have the Carpenters start the fight with the backing of the rest of labor. On May 2, 1890 a New York daily headlined: &quot;Everywhere the Workmen Join in Demands for a Normal Day.&quot; Another headline: &quot;Parade of Jubilant Workingmen In All the Trade Centers of the Civilized World.&quot; Thirty thousand marched in Chicago; 70 unions were in the N. Y. demonstration. UE News, Vol. XXXIV, Issue No. 6</dc:description>
