  <dc:description>This cartoon depicts UE&apos;s success for increasing wages for both men and women at General Electric. Caption 1:  The first national strike against the General Electric Co lasted nine weeks, ending in March 1946 with 100,000 UE members winning an 18.5 cent hourly increase. Corporation-inspired violence, many arrests of strikers, and an expensive anti-union publicity campaign had failed to budge the strikers. One of the hindrances to settlement had been the insistence of GE Pres. Charles E. Wilson that the union accept a smaller increase for women whom he contemptuously called &quot;bobby soxers.&quot; He failed.  Caption 2:  As the GE workers streamed back to work proud that they had beaten the biggest electrical corporation in the country,  Westinghouse still refused to come to terms. A New Jersey jury refused to convict five UE strike leaders at Westinghouse. Federal mediators upheld the union&apos;s position that the company   was offering a much smaller increase than GE had finally granted. The mediators scored the company and withdrew from  the case. The strike had started in January. Now it was April.   Caption 3:  GE had tried to split the workers by offering women a smaller increase. Now Westinghouse tried to split the workers by proposing to give no increase to lamp workers with 9.7 cents for the rest. Pennsylvania&apos;s Gov. Martin, who had refused to meet striking war veterans who had come to the state capitol, stationed state troopers around the company&apos;s East Pittsburgh plant to try to frighten the pickets. It didn&apos;t work. GE workers, back at work, joined in raising funds for the strikers, some giving a week&apos;s wage increase. UE News, Vol. XXXVII, Issue No. 25</dc:description>
