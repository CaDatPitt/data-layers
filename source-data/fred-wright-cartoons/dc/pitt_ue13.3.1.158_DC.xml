  <dc:description>In 1956, following the Westinghouse strike, information appeared proving that informers used by the Justice Department against union members and leaders, were frauds. Caption 1:  The national strike against the Westinghouse Electric Corp. ended on March 27, 1956, five months after it started. The company&apos;s attempt to wipe out working conditions developed over 19 years had failed. But the lock-out  against Local 107 members at the big Lester, Pa. plant continued over local issues. The entire labor movement in the Philadelphia area and political leaders, were among those who condemned the company. A petition signed by 444 merchants protested the company&apos;s wage cut demands as threatening their security.  Caption 2:  Ten months after the lockout started, 6,000 members of Local 107 had an agreement they could ratify. Meanwhile, Atty.-Gen. Brownell&apos;s Justice Dept. made a startling admission. In an affidavit to the federal court in New York City, the department urged haste in prosecuting denaturalization proceedings against Director of Org. Matles because he was &quot;probably the main guiding spirit&quot; of the union &quot;which recently conducted a long strike against Westinghouse.&quot; It would be &quot;dangerous&quot; to permit him to continue in his position, the affidavit said.  Caption 3:  At the same time, there was growing proof that the informers being used by the Justice Dept. and various congressional committees were frauds. The Justice Dept. advised the Supreme Court in Oct. 1956 that it had doubts about the truthfulness of one of its leading stool-pigeons, Joseph Mazzei. His testimony before a Senate subcommittee had been used by the General Electric Co. as the basis for firing UE Local 506 Pres. John Nelson and by the Westinghouse Airbrake Co. to fire Local 610 Pres. Harold Briney and rank-and-filer Theodore Wright. UE News, Vol. XXXIX, Issue No. 1</dc:description>
