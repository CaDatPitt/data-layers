  <dc:title>Labor History - 174: War on U.S. liberties</dc:title>

  <dc:description>During the 1970&apos;s during the Regan era, the government was involved in many scandals and undermined U.S. liberties. Caption 1:  The U.S. had suffered 55,000 dead and hundreds of thousands of other casualties by the time the Vietnam war ended in April 1975. The huge cost of the war had brought on the worst unemployment in nearly half a century and the highest inflation ever. In order to suppress opposition to the war, government agencies had waged a war against the constitutional rights of the American people through the FBI, CIA and other agencies.  Caption 2:  Then came the Watergate incident in which the Nixon Administration directed the looting of the Democratic Party headquarters in an attempt to find proof that that party&apos;s Presidential candidate was a tool of the Cuban government. With the probing of that incident the American people began learning to what lengths their leaders had gone to undermine basic freedoms in the name of opposing communism.  Caption 3:  Further investigation had shown that using the same excuse, U.S. agencies had plotted the assassination of foreign government heads; had helped overthrow the democratic government in Chile and replace it with an anti-labor military dictatorship; that American corporations had bribed foreign government officials; that American legislators were bribed by heads of U.S.-favored foreign dictatorships. All of this secretly, at taxpayers&apos; expense, while problems at home grew ever greater. UE News, Vol. XXXIX, Issue No. 17</dc:description>
