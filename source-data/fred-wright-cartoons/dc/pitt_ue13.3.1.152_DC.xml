  <dc:description>This cartoon depicts the Supreme Court ruling in favor of UE, setting limits on congressional committee probes in response to the damage done by Sen. Joe McCarthy. Caption 1:  Growing numbers of Americans recoiled against repression as they realized that behind the drive on an alleged &quot;communist conspiracy&quot; there was an actual operation against democracy. In the Senate, a resolution censuring Sen. Joe McCarthy was adopted when he started going after top officials of the Eisenhower Administration and the Army charging them with being involved in the &quot;communist conspiracy.&quot;  Caption 2:  The courts began paying attention to the growing opposition to the congressional and employer assaults on the Bill of Rights. A decision of historic importance was won by the UE when the Supreme Court in 1955 overturned the 1950 contempt of Congress conviction of UE Secy.-Treas. Julius Emspak and Field Org. Tom Quinn who had been fired by Westinghouse for defying a congressional committee.  Caption 3:  Emspak had refused to give the committee names of UE members it wanted to pillory. &quot;I think it is my duty to protect the rights guaranteed under the constitution... This committee will corrupt those rights.&quot; The judge who had sentenced Emspak said: &quot;Concern for the union was uppermost in his mind.&quot; Chief Justice Earl Warren wrote the Emspak-Quinn opinion. It set limits on the congressional committee probes. UE News, Vol. XXXVIII, Issue No. 19</dc:description>
