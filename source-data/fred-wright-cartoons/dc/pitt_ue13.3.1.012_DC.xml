  <dc:description>This cartoon depicts labor&apos;s victory in gaining the 10-hour work day through various state legislations.  Employers, however, resisted this by blacklisting workers who would not work the longer hours. Caption 1:  Defeated time and again workers kept returning to the demand for a 10-hour day to ease their hardships and enable them to get needed leisure time for recreation and education. A meeting of New Jersey workingmen resolved that &quot;we hold the doctrine that masses were created to toil and the few to think in abhorrence&quot; (1847). And in Nashville, Tenn. carpenters declared: &quot;We are flesh and blood, we need hours for recreation.&quot;  Caption 2:  To some legislation was the only way to cut hours. Others thought arrangements with individual employers the answer. Then there were those who proposed a general strike throughout New England starting on July 4. Meanwhile New Hampshire passed a state 10-hour law (1847). Pennsylvania followed a year later and other states followed a few years later. But the laws did not stop employers from blacklisting any who wouldn&apos;t work longer hours.  Caption 3:  To this employers answered as did a Chicopee, Mass. mill manager: &quot;It is not the hours per day that a person works that breaks him down, but the hours spent in dissipation.&quot; He saw shorter hours as reducing wages and increasing dissipation. Even among workers some felt that they could get a shorter day only with a reduction in earnings. But others felt that reducing hours would result in a greater demand for labor and therefore higher wages. UE News, Vol. XXXII, Issue No. 19</dc:description>
