  <dc:title>Labor History - 140: The Employers Get Their Law</dc:title>

  <dc:description>This cartoon describes the Taft-Hartley Law that overrode the Wagner Act, discouraging people to join unions. Caption 1:  In December, 1946, the National Association of Manufacturers was assured by a U.S. senator that legislation was being prepared which would &quot;bear down most heavily on unions.&quot; Eventually, that legislation became known as the Taft-Hartley law, superseding the Wagner Act which had been wrung out of the federal government at the height of the organizing drives of the Congress of Industrial Organizations, a decade earlier.  Caption 2:  The Wagner Act recognized workers&apos; right to join unions. The Taft-Hartley law was designed to discourage workers from joining unions. It gave employers a free hand to disrupt union organizing drives; it produced a mass of regulations which entangled workers seeking organization; it contained for the first time in American history a section establishing political tests for union membership.  Caption 3:  Out of desire to protect themselves from the employers&apos; attacks, out of a fear of militant rank and file unionism, or out of a corrupt desire to fatten their union treasuries by slicing chunks of membership out of other unions, many labor leaders joined the employer-politician campaign to wreck the CIO. Ten unions, representing one million members, were severed from the CIO for refusing to kowtow to the anti-labor politicians. UE News, Vol. XXXVIII, Issue No. 5</dc:description>
