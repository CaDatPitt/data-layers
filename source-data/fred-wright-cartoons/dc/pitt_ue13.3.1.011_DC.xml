  <dc:description>In the mid 1800s, labor suffered setbacks due to increases in the use of machinery and large scale immigration.  Wages dropped dramatically, affecting the lives of many workers and immigrants. Caption 1:  Machinery was rapidly taking over from hand production in the 1840&apos;s. The shoemakers (Lynn, Mass.) who had their little shops in season and could dig clams out of season were being swallowed by factories; power looms displaced hand-loom weavers; power presses replaced hand printing. This was accompanied by severe earning slashes. Hatters pay, for example, dropped from $12 to $8 a week between 1835 and 1845.  Caption 2:  Millions of immigrants were arriving. Only one million had come in the first 50 years of the nation; from 1846 to 1855 about three million came. They were refugees from famines as in Ireland; from suppressed revolutions as in Germany. Employers took advantage of this to provide themselves with cheap labor. An 1850 budget said about $11 a week was the minimum needed for a N.Y. family. Average weekly earnings were $1 a person.  Caption 3:  Slums grew in this misery. N.Y. had 18,000 living in cellars; from 6 to 20 persons in a single room. A Boston study (1849) told of people &quot;huddled together like brutes...&quot; sometimes wife, husband, brothers and sisters in the same beds.&quot; A tremendous protest movement for a shorter work day, for decent living conditions was growing. Refugees from unsuccessful European revolutions responded eagerly to native leaders who sought to curb capital&apos;s greed. UE News, Vol. XXXII, Issue No. 18</dc:description>
