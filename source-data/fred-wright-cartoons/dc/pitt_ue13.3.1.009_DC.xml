  <dc:title>Labor History - 9: Children Strike</dc:title>

  <dc:subject>Average Work Day, Strikes</dc:subject>
  <dc:description>This cartoon depicts strikes held by children and their parents demanding a shorter work day, resulting in resistance from their employers. Caption 1:  The demand for a shorter work-day was sweeping the east in the 1830&apos;s following the defeat of the workers on this issue a decade earlier. Children working in the Paterson, N.J. textile mills struck on July 3, 1833 for an 11-hour day and 9 hours on Saturday. Their parents formed the &quot;Paterson Association for the Protection of the Working Classes of Paterson.&quot; Financial aid came from nearby cities. The kids held out until victory.  Caption 2:  Employers responded with charges that it was &quot;bands of Irish and other foreigners,&quot; &quot;elements of disorder&quot; who were responsible for the shorter work-day demand. Newspapers warned that to be idle several hours of the morning would lead workers to drunkenness and ruin. Employers resisted the 10-hour day as much as they did the 8-hour day 50 years later.  Caption 3:  Resolving to work for a 10-hour day, Philadelphia carpenters said all men had the right &quot;to have sufficient time for the cultivation of their mind and self-improvement.&quot; Boston strikers declared that a longer day exhausted the mechanic&apos;s physical and mental powers. It was a sign of labor&apos;s maturity to demand greater educational opportunities, and free schooling for their children--they tied the shorter work day to the &quot;cultivation of the mind.&quot; UE News, Vol. XXXII, Issue No. 16</dc:description>
