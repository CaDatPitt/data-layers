  <dc:title>Labor History - 101: AFL Suspends 10 Unions</dc:title>

  <dc:description>This cartoon explains the how the Congress for Industrial Organization was formed and the AFL&apos;s reaction to it. Caption 1:  A few weeks after John L. Lewis knocked Carpenters&apos; Union Pres. Hutcheson to the floor with a punch, the leaders of ten AFL unions met to form a Committee for Industrial Organization. They were disgusted with the AFL convention&apos;s decision to again postpone organization of the big mass production industries. And before Nov. 1935 was over, Lewis announced his resignation as vice president of the AFL.  Caption 2:  When the AFL Executive Council met in Jan. 1936, it had before it a demand for industrial union charters in the radio, steel, rubber and auto industries-all almost totally unorganized. The hidebound Council countered, instead with demands that the CIO disband on the ground that it was a dual organization promoting rebellion against the parent organization.  Caption 3:  When warnings to disband were treated with contempt by the ten members of the new committee, the Executive Council suspended those unions. When the AFL convention met at Tampa, Fla. in the fall, there were no delegates from the ten unions who were associated with the Committee for Industrial Organization.
