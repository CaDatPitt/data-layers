  <mods:abstract>This cartoon describes how McCarthyism began and how his actions effected the labor movement. Caption 1:  A number of congressional committees undertook the job of undermining the Bill of Rights in the late 1940's and into the 1950's. The most notorious of these committees was headed by Sen. Joe McCarthy, a Wisconsin Republican. Waving sheets of paper, McCarthy, for example, would rise in the Senate to proclaim that he had a list of communists who had taken control of the State Dept. and betrayed the country.  Caption 2:  Untroubled by truth and unlimited in gall, McCarthy made his lists grow more extensively by the week. Denials and contrary proof meant nothing to him. The wartime chief of staff, the secretary of the army, fellow legislators, newspapermen who dared criticize him were among those dragged into his net of alleged subversives or tools of subversives. His statements received widespread publicity.  Caption 3:  The labor movement became a special target of McCarthy's. Big business recognized in him a handy tool with which to recover gains labor had made in the post-war strikes. It was difficult to attack working people for wanting a better life so employers resorted to an old device; condemn their struggles as "communist-inspired." It had been used against the 8-hour day movement, social security, and to maintain child labor. UE News, Vol. XXXVIII, Issue No. 10</mods:abstract>
