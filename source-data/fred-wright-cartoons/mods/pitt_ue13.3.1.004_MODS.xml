  <mods:abstract>This cartoon depicts businesses' early attempts at outlawing unions by charging them in court with a conspiracy to raise wages. Caption 1:  With union organizations leading to higher wages (a painter's daily wage in Massachusetts was $1.15 in 1800) employers moved to outlaw them. Eight Philadelphia shoe workers were charged, in 1805, with forming "a combination and conspiracy to raise wages" through the Cordwainers Union. The prosecution argued that one worker could legally seek a wage increase but that it was illegal for two or more, to do so.  Caption 2:  Merchants, innkeepers, master tailors were among the jury and labor spy Job Harrison a chief witness. Among prosecution arguments were that industry would leave Philadelphia if the union continued; that the unions were made up of men "who have been only a little time in your country" and were already trying to change its laws. Witnesses were found to claim that union members had threatened their lives.  Caption 3:  Defense Attorney Rodney said neither the public's welfare nor patriotism was the issue, but employers' profit. Many employers attended the trial. The men were found guilty of trying to raise wages. The fine was small, eight dollars each, but the heavy costs incurred broke the organization; it had to disband. In the next years similar trials were held in Pittsburgh, New York and Baltimore. Tough times were ahead. UE News, Vol. XVII, Issue No. 16</mods:abstract>
