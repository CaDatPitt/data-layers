  <mods:abstract>This cartoon describes women's involvement in the work force while men were overseas fighting in World War II. Caption 1:  As millions of men entered the armed forces, women swarmed into the factories to produce the materials needed for fighting the war. Many jobs formerly denied women  were opening to them. But if employers had to hire women to keep the factories going, they were not under equal pressure to grant them equal pay for the work men had been doing. This was to become a major issue, especially, for the UE which began to build a case for government action.  Caption 2:  While working people were going all out to help defeat fascism, industry was going all out to take advantage of the emergency to swell its profits. Prices soared as consumer goods including food, clothing and other basic necessities became short of supply due to conversion of civilian industry to military production. Workers seeking wage increases to help overcome inflation, found government officials ready to help industry keep wages down.  Caption 3:  Although a price control law was enacted, federal officials in charge of enforcement were vary lax in doing so. Instead, they pressured the National War Labor Board to reject any substantial wage increases negotiated by the unions. As always workers' wages, were regarded as "inflationary" but not profits. In addition, corporations still engaged in civilian production, stalled on turning to military production as long as they could take advantage of the very profitable consumer market.
