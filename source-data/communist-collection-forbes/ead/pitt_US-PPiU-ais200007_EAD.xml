            <head>Biography</head>
            <p>Born in 1907, Adolph Edward Forbes lived in the Oakland neighborhood of Pittsburgh with his mother, father, and siblings. Following high school, Forbes spent fifteen years working in Pittsburgh and also traveling throughout the country, both on his own and later with the United States Navy. By the early 1930s Forbes was a member of the Communist Party, as evidenced by his involvement with its front organizations such as the Workers International Relief (WIR), Cultural Division. Forbes' work in the CP reflected his own interests, such as writing, acting, and selling books. During this time, Forbes worked on novels and short stories. He also acted in local productions of radical plays, was involved in the 
                <title type="simple">Pittsburgh Pen and Hammer</title> (a working-class literary publication), and tried to establish a labor research library. There is no indication that Forbes held any high post in the Communist Party at either the national or local level.</p>
            <p>In 1940, Forbes left civilian life and entered the United States Navy. In the Navy, Forbes was first a clerk and later a shipbuilder. It was during this time that Forbes met his future wife, Shirley Levine. They were married during World War II and eventually settled in Pittsburgh. While Forbes briefly attended the University of Pittsburgh following high school, he completed his degree after the war, making use of the G.I. Bill. In the next decades, Forbes remained in Pittsburgh with his family and became active within the local Jewish community.</p>

            <head>Scope and Content Notes</head>
            <p>This collection has been broken down into two series. The first presents a collection of Left wing agitation and propaganda publications that demonstrate representative rhetoric on positions important to the American Left during the Depression decade through World War II. Primarily in the form of broadsides, pamphlets, newsletters, and flyers, these documents detail both issues known internationally and ones unique to Pittsburgh. For a sampling of material contained within this series, please consult the online exhibit at 
                <extref ns2:href="http://historicpittsburgh.org/collection/communist-collection-ae-forbes">http://historicpittsburgh.org/collection/communist-collection-ae-forbes</extref>. Additional information on this series is found in the Series I scope note in the contents list located below.</p>
            <p>Series II consists of material personal to Forbes, such as his writing and correspondence. The correspondence that Forbes maintained with his family and friends in the midst of his travels prior to World War II comprise the majority of this series. The collection contains letters as early as 1922, but not until the late 1920s is the correspondence continuous. Additionally, this series contains his efforts at writing fiction (drafts of short stories, ideas for novels, and scripts for plays) and a 1939 diary detailing his thoughts on life, women, and politics. While the focus of Series II is not communism or the Communist Party, documents and references to both are found throughout the series. Further information on Series II is provided in the contents list.</p>

                    <head>Scope and Content Notes</head>
                    <p>Topics covered in Series I reflect the involvement of Left wing groups (notably the CP) in local, national, and international affairs. Locally, documentation includes hand-rendered, mimeographed broadsides pertaining to issues including strikes, rallies, and protests for imprisoned labor leaders such as Phil Frankenfeld and James Egan. Also documented are local efforts to aid hunger and advocate for unemployment benefits. Flyers demanding justice for Eugene Cole, an African-American from Pittsburgh jailed for alleged murder are included as well. Flyers, course descriptions, and events from the Pittsburgh Workers School also reside in Series I.</p>
                    <p>At a national level, documents reveal Left wing participation in elections along with activism for unemployment and social security benefits. Items pertaining to Tom Mooney and the Scottsboro Boys are well represented. This series also reflects international circumstances such as the Communist Party's relationship with the Soviet Union, the rise of fascism, and the Spanish Civil War.</p>
                    <p>Beyond broadsides, pamphlets, and flyers, there are several labor publications, often specific to a given factory or mill. Youth publications from both the Youth Communist League (YCL) and National Student League (NSL) are also included.</p>
                    <p>The documents found in the first sixteen folders can be viewed at http://images.library.pitt.edu/a/aeforbes. The online exhibit displays a representative selection of this series.</p>

                    <p>This series contains the personal material of Forbes, including many items that do not explicitly relate to communism. Most prominently featured in this series are Forbes' correspondence with his family, friends, and people he met while away from Pittsburgh. More specifically, his sister Ethel and his friend Herbert Leifer account for most of the correspondence. Folders marked 'miscellaneous' usually refer to female acquaintances he met or one of the few cousins with whom he remained in contact. Beyond family and friends, Forbes also corresponds extensively with his fiancée, Shirley Levine. Letters to a war buddy, Heinz, reveal that Forbes was assigned to spy on subversives while stationed in Alaska with the Navy (Folder 18).</p>
                    <p>Series II also displays Forbes' interest in writing short stories, novels, and plays. Although the series does not contain any completed works, it does include several outlines, drafts, and sketches for projects that Forbes intended on using to launch a writing career. In one instance Forbes worked on a novel about a female heroine, many of the files containing questionnaires and articles relate to this venture. In 1939, Forbes intermittently kept a diary in which he divulges information ranging from his concern with the direction of his life to his relationship with women and his political views.</p>
                    <p>For researchers aiming to find Forbes' work with the Communist Party, there are a few documents that explicitly relate to this. A small notebook and several pages from a larger notebook provide meeting minutes from the 
                        <title type="simple">Pittsburgh Pen and Hammer</title>. Also, letters from the Workers International Relief express Forbes interest in doing 'cultural' work for the Party. In addition to these, the correspondence, while primarily focusing on the more mundane aspects of life, sometimes relates to the Communist Party and communism.</p>
