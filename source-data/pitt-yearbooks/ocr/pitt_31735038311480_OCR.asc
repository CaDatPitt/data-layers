If the passing game was inconsistent, the
running game could always be counted on.
Craig Heyward, at 260—some pounds, was
strong enough to blast up the middle, yet agile
enough to hurdle tacklers in the open field.
After the season, although he was only a jun-
ior, he sought to turn pro, and after some
controversy, was drafted by the New Orleans
Saints.

In the 1987 season, junior guard Mark
Stepnoski was recognized as one of the very
best offensive linemen in the college game,
and was expected to be a linchpin of the of-
fense in the 1988 season.

Return to
Excellence

The 1987 season marked a turning point in the annals of Pitt
Panther football. Many players would emerge as among the best at
their respective positions. But perhaps more importantly, Coach
Mike Gottfried proved that the Panthers were capable of returning
to the upper echelon of college football teams.

The Panthers ﬁnished the season at 8 and 4, their first winning
season in three years. The season climaxed with an appearance in
the Bluebonnet Bowl in Houston, Texas. The Panthers played a
difficult schedule meeting the likes of Brigham Young, Notre
Dame, Syracuse, and Penn State. Statistically, the Panthers fin-
ished with one of the premier defensive backﬁelds in the country.
The secondary permitted just eight touchdowns, with opposing
quarterbacks completing just forty-percent of their throws. Three
seniors, Gary Richard, Quintin Jones, and Billy Owens, can be
credited with solidifying the secondary.

From the corps of linebackers emerged one of the finest players
to ever don a Panther uniform. Ezekial “Zeke” Gadson tormented
the opposition with reckless abandon as his statistics might indicate.
Gadson set a Pitt record for sacks in a season with twenty-four and
a half, eclipsing the record of Randy Holloway.

The defensive line could be considered one of the deepest areas
of the team. Despite the graduation of three starters, Tony Woods,
Lorenso Freeman, and Walter Johnson, the Panthers were able to
find four quality players to fill the most glaring need. Strong play
from the front four helped to make the Panthers one of the nation’s
best defensive units. Perhaps the most impressive of any of the
linemen was Marc Spindler, a seventeen year old freshman from
West Scranton, Pennsylvania. Despite being double teamed for
most of the season, Spindler used his raw talent to finish second
only to Gadson for number of tackles. Jon Carter and Burt
Grossman also turned in solid performances, as the two players
combined for eleven sacks.

While the defense proved to be a cohesive unit, the same could
not be said for the offense. A season—long quarterback controversy
ended with three different signal callers lining up behind center. Sal
Genilla, the senior signal caller from San Mateo, California, started
the season armed with a group of ﬂeet receivers as well as a
punishing ground attack. But the offense tended to sputter against
inferior opposition, thus precipitating a change. Enter Darnell
Dickerson, the freshman with a strong arm and the ability to
scramble out of trouble. But for all of his quickness, Dickerson
completed just thirty-five out of ninety-three passes with just one
touchdown. And yet, while the Panthers did suffer from an in-
experienced quarterback and a generally inconsistent offense, there
was one constant on the field — Craig “Ironhead” Heyward.
Heyward became only the sixth player in N.C.A.A. history to rush
for one hundred yards in every game. This performance enabled
the Passaic, New Jersey native to move into second place in Pittls
all time rushing list, trailing only Tony Dorsett. Heyward finished
the year with 1791 yards and twelve touchdowns. He was also
credited with a touchdown through the air as he threw a seventeen
yard scoring strike to Billy Osborn during the North Caroline State
game.

The 1987 season will hopefully serve as a strong foundation to
build upon in future seasons. However, Coach Gottfried will have to
find a consistent quarterback, as well as a running back to anchor
the offense. The bevy of wide receivers will be greatly enhanced by
a confident signal caller. Defensively, the Panthers will have to fill
holes in the secondary as well as at linebacker. “I hope that with the
maturing of our freshmen, as well as the continued improvement of
the upperclassmen, we’ll lay the foundation for a very successful
football program,” according to Coach Gottfried.

The Gottfried Era Continues

The 1987 season may in the future be seen as the
beginning of the Mike Gottfried era. A winning
season, a bowl game, and the signing of a stellar
freshman squad all boosted the hopes of Panther

fans.

In April, Athletic Director Ed Bozik signed Gott-
fried to what was reported to be a lifetime contract.
The contract was meant to give Gottfried the stat-
ure and the stability held by the coaches at the

football powerhouses.

Gottfried returned the fa-
vor by donating $50,000 to-
ward the construction of a
new indoor sports facility.

The contract was not
something he sought. “The
university and Dr. Bozik
had mentioned it to me, and
of course I was honored that
they would even consider
that, and I thought about it
for a long time before I ac-
tually did anything on it . . .
That was a big decision, be-
cause I’ve always had a goal
to coach in the pros, and I’ve
always had a goal of win-
ning a national champion-
ship. So, you can’t just one
day. . . say, ‘I want to do this
and do that.’ A lot of thought
went into it.”

By Matt Martin

His reign is not untroubled, however. He
lashed out at agents, calling them “vultures,” and
the decision of Craig Heyward to turn pro after
his junior year cost the Panthers an All-

American running back.

 

“I think the NCAA, the coaches, the athletic
directors, the NFL and the (football players’) un-
ion ought to get all together and say, if somebody
adopts and deals with the player early, that they

cannot negotiate the con-
tract with the player,”
Gottfried said.

Gottfried’s wife, Mick-
ey, and his daughters,
Mindy and Marcy, have
made a successful transi-
tion to living in Pitts-
burgh. “I’m from Ohio,”
Gottfried said, “about
three and a half hours
from here, so I’ve always
known about Pittsburgh. I
coached in Youngstown
— high school ball —
when Iohnny Majors was
coaching here in 1976, so
I followed the program.
Always when I was grow-
ing up, I heard of the Pitt
teams and the tradition
and so forth, and of

course, the city. I love the city.”

that they won't make it. You can't be a part-time

  Another key next year will be the goalkeeper.
This year, time was split between Mark Hendricks
n.id Jay Kapusta. Both played well at times but also
1made some mental mistakes that cost the team
games.
  "All year, I was looking for one of them to take
charge - neither did," said Luxbacher. "All of our
goalkeepers have the skills, but they have to work."
  "The best game we played was the last one," said
Luxbacher. "For the simple reason that we finished
our chances. We put the ball into the net. The thing
was that we played [well] in just about every game.
We had the chances but just couldn't capitalize on
them."

Homecoming

“Gazing Into the Crystal Ball” was
the theme of Homecoming, as Pitt
looked ahead to its third century. The
traditional “keg roll” games found
winners in teams from Delta Tau Delta
and from Student Nurses Association
of Pennsylvania. Pitt fans were con-
fident the blue and gold would win,
but the Pitt schedule makers appar-
ently had not looked into their crystal
balls to see that Syracuse would be
~ M undefeated coming into Pitt Stadium.
r The Orangemen won, 24-10.

Although fashion trends were in
flux, the punk look was still the mode
of choice for some Pitt and CMU stu-
dents (above).

Television and stage personality Ma-
ry Robb Iackson (right) tries on an out-
fit for a Halloween event. Halloween
seems to have become a major “party”
occasion on campus, and a number of
students dressed up for the holiday,
while others simply celebrated.

Pitt football was back in full force.

e defense was unstoppable, the of-
“ rise was psyched, and the Iron City
lowed freely at tailgate parties.
 Like the Pitt football program, tail-
ting had a tradition of its own.
rtiers gathered at parking lots
roughout Oakland, with the largest
owds near the Syria Mosque. The
rious tailgater arrived at 9 a.m. to set

 
 
   

;_f Spirit seemed to be high due to the
"arm weather and the cold drinks.
is year some fans went all out for
e tailgate like Tom Conley and Jim
ston. They brought grills and

 

cooked hot dogs. However, they didn’t
have the problem of “too many cooks

“Tom’s in charge of the weenies,”
said Krista Dunlap. Students Dunlap,
Sue Simon and Dave Conley were en-
joying the party, but Conley thought
the mood was casual. To remedy that,
Rob Yarsky led a Pitt cheer. The fans
around him responded enthusiastical-
ly.

To some, attire is more important
than what is served at the parties. The
fans were decked out in Pitt sweat-
shirts, hats and jogging pants. Some
wore blue and gold in their hair, and
few fanatics had painted their faces in
the school colors.

The tailgaters were friendly with
their neighboring partiers, offering
drinks to passersby and comparing
pregame predictions.

“The best part of tailgating is the
people you meet,” said freshman
Laurie Palumbo. The students report-
ed that even those who had graduated
from Pitt come back to tailgate with
their friends when the new season
started.

In spite of the rain showers, tail-
gating always continued. There are

usually grumblers, but the grumbling
isn’t enough to disband the parties.

The parking lots grew quiet, as the
students departed. The tailgating was
over until after the game. And with
next week’s home game, the tradition
will continue.

Comic Erno Philips (right) brought his unusual
brand of humor to Pitt during the year.

Comic Jeff Altman (below) told a Pitt audience
about how he realized that dating and drinking
don’t mix: “It’s hard to be cool and nauseous at
the same time." He also reminisced about his
father’s reactions to his poor grades: “I'll hit you
so hard your kids’ll be dizzy.”

At Heinz U.S.A.,

we think a winning team

needs team players .

In basketball, it’s usually the high scorers who get the press clippings. And understandably so. But it’s

also important to recognize the value of team players who can pass off the ball at the right time.
We like to think we’re team players who are ready and willing /

to help make our community a better place for everyone. ‘,1

K I i . I

Our participation is wide ranging—food donations to

community service organizations, financial support for
many worthwhile programs and projects. . .and involve-
ment in vital programs ranging from the

United Way to Children’s Hospital to V
Sickle Cell research and treatment to
job training to sponsorship of

youth groups.

We’re proud of our hometown and
its people. . .and proud to be team
players in the effort to make it an
even better place to live.

PLAIN PAPER COPIERS

8070/8570

At 70 copies a minute, Canon's new NP-8000 Series system copiers make
copying faster, better The NP-8070 and NP—8570 knock the big jobs down to size,
with more automatic features and full—system performance than any copier in their
class. The NP-8570's Recirculating Document Feeder feeds up to 50 originals and
allows for multiple two-sided copies; an Automatic Document Feeder on the
NP-8070 feeds up to 30 originals. A “friendly" message display lets you communicate
with the copiers in plain English. And a multifunction memory stores entire copying
tasks and recalls them at a touch. Add an optional 50-bin sorting system or a
Finishing System that stacks, folds and staples your copies. From feeding to sorting
to finishing, the NP-8000 Series offers speed exceeded only by performance.

The Pitt Program Council, university and local theaters, and the Office of
Student Activities were just some of the organizations that brought the
best in art and entertainment to the campus in 1987-88. Some examples:
“Pump Boys and Dinettes” (above) brought music and song to Pitt. Grover
Washington Ir. (left) headlined the Jazz Seminar. Natalie Ross (opposite
page, lower right) portrayed Emily Dickinson in “The Belle of Amherst."
Amy Seifried (opposite page, lower left) conveys a girl's anguish in a Pitt
Theater production of Arthur Miller‘s “The Crucible.” The rock group
The Cure (opposite page, top) brought punk rock to Pitt.

262 Farewell

Farewell to a leader

Although Pittsburgh’s skyline
testified to the city’s determina-
tion to battle the economic up-
heaval of the past decade, Pitt-
sburghers were stunned by the
death in May of the leader who
guided the city through the dec-
ade.

Mayor Richard Caliguiri (far
left) had been suffering from a
rare disease, amyloidosis, in
which protein fibers interfere
with internal organs. Although
the disease is always fatal, and
Caliguiri had been visibly weak-
ened by the disease, his death
still came as a shock to Pitt-
sburghers.

His funeral at St. Paul’s Cathe-
dral in Oakland was attended by
hundreds, from Gov. Bob Casey
to ordinary people who were
touched by the mayor’s leader-
ship and dedication to the city.

The year after the bicentennial:
201 and beyond. Pitt made strides
into its third century, making ad-
vances in research and in teaching,
in the arts and in the sciences.

At the same time, other traditions
remained, from tailgating to french
fries at the “O” to winning sports
teams. Yet other things passed, as al-
ways happens. The region was
changing, and old ways were disap-
pearing.

In some ways it was appropriate
that, as the year passed into history,
so did a mayor who had come to
symbolize Pittsburgh’s transition to
I e new world.

Pitt Students do Daytona

When Pitt students arrived in Daytona Beach to
celebrate Pitt’s first spring break ever, they were
expecting the kind of scene portrayed in every beach
party movie. At first, it didn’t look that way.

“We get here,” said Paul Acosta, a student from Case
Western Reserve in Cleveland, “We’re expecting
sunshine, beautiful people, and it’s raining and we’re
greeted by bikers.”

Indeed, dozens of Pitt students, on a trip sponsored by
the Pitt Program Council, witnessed a brawl in the
middle of Atlantic Avenue among several motorcycle
gang members.

And that was before the visitors from Pittsburgh had
stepped off their buses.

Eventually the Pitt students settled into the Clarendon
Plaza Hotel, the bikers concluded their Bike Week
Festival, the sun came out, and the party began.

“I’m here to get hammered,” said a Villanova student.
“We’re here for three things,” said a William and Mary
College student. “Girls, beer and fun.”

All three were present in abundance. There were beer
specials, belly ﬂop contests, and wet T-shirt contests.

Several women from Pitt competed. One explained, “I
don’t regret entering the wet T-shirt contest because it’s
spring break, and you’re supposed to be wild — and I’m a
senior. I’m glad I didn’t take off my shirt, though.”

A number of women did, and a few took off their bikini
bottoms, too. Some men applauded, but not all.

“I thought it was rather gross,” said Pitt junior Charles
Stevenson of those who took it all off. “The ones who
kept their clothes on had class.”

Spring and alcohol contributed to the atmosphere.
“The time I had was out of control,” said one Pitt junior.
“It’s the best time I’ve had all year.”

Crime is not as prevalent as one might think, with most
arrests coming for having alcohol in a public area, a
crime in Florida. Still, police and security forces are
present in force to keep the crowds in line.

Most of the visiting Pitt students seemed to agree with
sophomore Gil Borok, who said, “Daytona was magic.”

(Adapted from Frances Sansig’s story in The Pitt News.)

African art is not art for art’s sake — “it is a

He cited the accomplishments of African art,
and said that the classroom would help
preserve a wide spectrum of African culture.

Drinking, long a part of campus life, came under greater
scrutiny, for legal, social, and health reasons. More than 100
Carnegie-Mellon University students were arrested by au-
thorities after a raid on two CMU fraternities.

Yet students continued to use fake IDs to get liquor, and
to smuggle it into the dorms. One 20-year-old female stu-
dent at Pitt said, “It’s something to do on the weekends.
When you go out on the weekends, you drink, in some
cases, because of the frustrations of classes and stress.”
(Rich Cholodofsky for the Pitt News.)

“The ground floor is really social,” said Allan Bell. “The

One student said that during finals week the library
replaced the bars for socializing because the library was
better lit. “You can see the people!” (Keri D. Smith for The

Human rights — for consumers, for crime victims,
for racial and ethnic minorities —— was a central topic
at Pitt this year.

Consumer activist Ralph Nader (above, left) told law
students that as lawyers they ought to work for justice
and for consumers. He also blasted the Federal Com-
munications Commission.

Pittsburgh native and poet Lamont Steptoe (above,
right) dedicated his speech at the Pittsburgh Poetry
Festival on International Human Rights Day to the late
novelist Iames Baldwin.

Model Marla Hanson (right) spoke on the rights of
victims, based on her experience of being slashed in
the face on a New York City street.

   
    

Spin magazine publisher Bob Guccione, Ir. (left) opposed censorship
in the music business. “I don't believe music has ever made any-
body do anything they didn't want to do.”

The exhibition “Auschwitz: A Crime Against Mankind” [below]
brought home the horrors of hatred. The series of lectures and
photos was sponsored by the university and by the United Iewish
Appeal.

Pitt
divests,
ending

controversy

On Iuly 1, 1987, Pitt’s board of
trustees voted 16-0 to divest from
South Africa, quelling a ten—year
dispute with local groups oppos-
ing apartheid. Pitt President Wes-
ley Posvar (above) called the ac-
tion a “meaningful” public
statement on the policies of
South Africa’s government.

The university’s resolution re-
portedly said in part, “The uni-
versity has adopted an increas-
ingly rigorous policy toward
investment in stocks of American
companies operating in South Af-
rica . . .”

Posvar added that the univer-
sity’s position was “unswervingly
anti-apartheid.”

In an interview with The Pitt
News, Posvar said “It was not re-
ally feasible any more to think of
large numbers of American cor-
porations working in concert in

South Africa effectively against
apartheid. Their position had
eroded so much that the symbolic
value and the solidarity of op-
position to apartheid through this
symbolic act became of para-
mount importance.”

He added that “The last thing
we want is to leave the impres-
sion that we no longer care and
that we have turned our back on
the problem of South Africa.”
Posvar said the university still
applauds efforts to grant equal
rights to workers, and the uni-
versity also supports improving
education in South Africa as a
means of easing racial conflict
there.

The Black _Action Society and
Pitt’s Students for a Free South
Africa had in the fall of 1986
erected shanties on the lawn of
the William Pitt Union, the cent-

er of student activities. Man-
ned day and night, the shanties
were abandoned with the on-
set of cold weather. The pro-
testers wanted the university
to divest faster; university of-
ficials responded that the uni-
versity was moving rapidly,
and was still holding out some
hope that American corpora-
tions could influence apart-
heid.

Dennis Brutus, chairman of
the Black Studies Department,
said in a May protest meeting
on the Pitt campus, “We are
here to remind people on this
campus (that) people are dying
in South Africa. As long as we
are invested in South Africa,
we are involved in the killings.
This university will not lose
any money by getting out of
racism.”

Black Monday

 

The New York Stock Ex-
change was the scene of
panic selling on October
19, when the market suf-
fered its biggest loss ever.

 
   

Later the market recov
ered, and the world econ-
omy seemed strong, al
though worries over th
trade deficit continued.

The Israel Heritage
Classroom leads off
a burst of interest in
nationality rooms.

54 Israel Room

he dedication of the Israel Heritage

Classroom in November highlight-
ed the biggest surge of interest in new
Nationality Rooms in 30 years.

The Israel room — the 20th class-
room in the Cathedral of Learning to
celebrate the ethnic cultures of Pitts-
burgh —- includes replicas of art and
buildings from ancient times.

E. Maxine Bruhns, director of the
nationality rooms, traveled to Israel in

  
    

1980 and in 1984, as part of the process
of recreating the ancient heritage.
“Cultural groups choose to exp1‘e&'
their heritage in the national room“
because it’s an educational setting;l
serves an instructional purpose. The.‘
are classrooms that teach. Also, ll“
rooms are virtually guaranteed to exisl
for many generations to come. The C3’
thedral of Learning is about as pet
manent as you can get,” she said.

Other ethnic groups are also devel-
oping classrooms to reflect their her-
itages. The Armenian room was sched-
uled for completion in 1988. It will be a
first for the Cathedral: it is patterned
after an actual room, the library in an
fleventh-century Armenian monas-

ery.

The African Heritage room was

      

boosted in 1988 when Ghana’s U.N.
ambassador spoke at a fund-raiser; the
room is scheduled to be finished by
the end of 1988. A Ukrainian room will
feature traditional wood paneling, and
plans are being laid for an Austrian
Room. (Adapted from an article by Ma-
ry Ann Thomas in Pitt Magazine.)

The dedication of the Israel Heritage Classroom
included a blessing, and a presentation of an
ornamental key from heritage room chairman
Ioseph M." Katz to President Wesley Posvar.

Into the Third Century

Welcome to 201 — and beyond.
Pitt's 201st year saw the university
move toward the future. One direction
was the obvious one of growth in tech-
nology. Pitt has become a major re-
search university, ranging from break-
throughs in organ transplants to the
opening of UPARC.

But the University of Pittsburgh is
growing to the future in other ways.

gaining prominence in the literary
world, as the University of Pittsburgh
Press grows in stature. The philosophy
department is one of the very best in
the country, and the administration is
moving to improve undergraduate ed-
ucation.

The future was also addressed by
the presidential candidates. Econom-
ics and social concerns continued to
demand attention from the Pitt com-

munity.

At the same time, student life we
on, especially during the first spri
break in Pitt’s history. The SPO]
teams produced some of the best at
letes in the country, and the basketlm
and volleyball teams challenged 1
the national championship. Now, om

‘Mysteries of Pittsburgh’ makes grad hot writer

I 11 an age of novels about hip young
people on the fast track in New York
or LA, the hottest first novel of the
year is about several young people
coming of age in Pittsburgh.

And in an age when young writers
thrive on hype, 24-year-old Michael
Chabon (SHAY—bon), a 1984 graduate
of Pitt, says, “I’m not interested in be-
ing famous at all.”

His novel, The Mysteries of Pitts-
burgh, was written at the University of
California at Irvine's fiction-writing
workshop. Chabon handed it in to his
advisor, expecting a critique. The ad-
visor mailed it to a New York literary
agent, and it was auctioned off a
month later for $155,000 for North
American hardcover rights. The sale of
the international rights and the movie

rights, plus accolades for the quality of
the writing, completed a writer’s fan-
tasy-come-true.

Chabon displayed early promise as
editor of Pitt’s literary magazine, Back-
space. He also worked at ]ay’s Book
Stall and sang lead for a rock band,
“Bats.” His activity left him with little
actually written. The cure was a sim-
ple prescription by part—time fiction
instructor Dennis Bartel. Chabon re-
calls, “He said, ‘Michael, if you really
want to write a novel, you have to
learn to sit on your a--’.”

Chabon also credits Pitt fiction writ-
ing professors Chuck Kinder and Eve
Shelnutt with guiding his talent. “Eve
taught me to care and really attend to
my writing on the sentence level,”
Chabon says. “What I got most from

Chuck was friendship. He was the firs
totally accessible writer that I met at
I learned a lot just being in his com-
pany.”

“It wasn’t until my last year it
school that I realized how much I like
Pittsburgh,” he says. His recollection:
of such local shrines as Hillman Li-
brary and Gustines restaurant will res~
onate with anyone who has spent timr
here. But Chabon knows the on]?
thing mysterious to those who havt
never been to Pittsburgh is whysf
many who have been to Pittsburfi
grow so attached to it.

University Press takes place among leaders

itt’s growing stature in the literary
Pworld is reflected in the eminence
Ofthe University of Pittsburgh Press. It
is now ranked among the top scholarly
publishers in the country. Consider:

_. In poetry the Press is ranked the
best of American academic publishers,
second behind Antheneum among all
American publishers.

, The Press has established its ex-
cellence with works on Latin America,
descriptive bibliography, social and la-
bor history, Russia and East Europe,
Milton, and policy and institutional
studies.

— The growing stature of winners of
the Drue Heinz Literature Prize for

short fiction.

According to its director, Frederick
A. Hetzel, the Press’s goals are more
important than ever. What is the point,
he asks, in supporting research “if the
findings are unavailable to the people
who need them?”

The Press has stepped in to publish
quality books that once would have
been published by commercial houses
that now concentrate on blockbusters.
An example is And the Wolf Finally
Came, Iohn Hoerr’s study of the de-
cline of the steel industry.

This goes for poetry and fiction, too.
“Too many commercial publishers
have dropped out of publishing fine

fiction. It only seems natural that uni-
versity presses should take up the
slack,” Hetzel says.

The Press’s impact is growing, said
William Lafe, formerly chief endow-
ment officer of the Howard Heinz En-
dowment and the Pittsburgh Founda-
tion. “Call it intellectual cachet, call it
the necessary outpost of a major uni-
versity, call it a barometer for meas-
uring the literary output of our city —
call it any of these things and more,
the University of Pittsburgh press is a
vital and critical element in Pitts-
burgh’s struggle for future growth.”

Perot lambastes corporate complacency

merica needs leaders who are

“willing to get down in the pits
and slug it out,” said Ross Perot
(above) in a speech at the Joseph M.
Katz Graduate School of Business.

The country may be ailing, he
said, and although “We haven’t had
the ‘heart attack’ yet,” unless some-
thing is done to solve basic business
problems, “This country could be in
deep, deep trouble.”

He praised the students at the
business school, which was re-
named after the Pitt alumnus who
founded Papercraft, Inc. “If you go

back through his life,” Perot said of
Katz, “he was living with the custom-
er, he’s still living with the customer.
And if I could wish for one thing in
this great country it would be for the
people who run our large companies to
go find out what the customer wants.”

Perot has followed his own advice.
He founded Electronic Data Systems in
1962, then sold it to General Motors.
He’s known for his pungent opinions,
and, typically, in his Pitt speech Perot
did not pull his punches.

“We are soft,” he said. “We are lazy.
We are doing a lousy job of passing a

better life on to the next generation,

He concluded: “Never forget that
a handful of people can restore
American competitiveness. That
group’s here in this business school
today. These are the young people
who can determine the future.”

U-PARC spearheads high tech surge

5 steel mills close along the Mon
Aand Ohio valleys, a new kind of
economy is rising at U-PARC
[beloW)- . .

U—PARC [University of Pittsburgh
Applied Research Center) formerly
was the Gulf R&D center in
Harmarville. By late 1987, U—PARC
was home to more than 55 com-
panies and spawned more than 500
jobs. More than a hundred high-
tech, light manufacturing, research
and corporate companies are ex-
pected to employ 2,000 persons by
the early 1990s.

Chevron acquired the
Harmarville center following its
merger with Gulf in 1985, and do-
nated it to Pitt in 1986, in one of the
largest corporate gifts to a univer-
sity ever.

The Harmarville facility has been
known for decades for its research. Its
new functions will add a few twists.

“The unique aspect of U—PARC is
that a variety of companies can call
this home,” says Henry A. LaRue,
president of Pittsburgh Applied Re-
search Corp., a for—profit subsidiary of
the University of Pittsburgh Trust that
operates the center.

At U—PARC companies will not only
find office space, but will be able to
lease or purchase on—site lab equip-
ment, research resources, and support
services. This will make it easier for
small and new companies that often
find themselves struggling to find
cash.

“U—PARC serves as a bridge be-
tween advanced technology and

4

heavy industry,” he says. “For ex-
ample, the center can meet the
needs of a company developing bac-
terial vaccines and provide the
computerized equipment and test
bays for a major automotive com-
pany devising new emission control
systems.”

The mix of corporate and aca-
demic resources produces a synergy
of new ideas and enterprises, and as
a bonus spawns new service busi-
nesses tending to the high—tech
businesses there.

Though U-PARC is clearly
unique, it remains a model for the
rest of the American economy.

A Pitt grad,

class of ’63,

is now one of

the most powerful
book publishers
in America,

Ioni
Evans,
at

Pitt graduate Joni Evans (above)
now occupies the seat once held
by Bennett Cerf — ublisher of
Random House. And s e did it the
hard way: She earned it.

Nikita Khrushchev visited Pitt
about the same time Ms. Evans ——
then Ioni Goldfinger from
Larchmont, N.Y. — arrived to work
out a life in literature. She studied
with Montgomery Culver in Pitt’s
Writing Program when he was the
program.

“He was marvelous,” Evans re-
calls. “It was a wonderful educa-
tion. It was there that I realized I
was fascinated with literature, by
reading, by the history of literature.
Most important, though, I learned
that I was not as good as a front
writer. He read In manuscripts in
class. He let me now that I had
talent, that I was good, but I wasn’t
that good.”

She added, “I also learned the dif-
ference between great writing and OK
writing, and that was when I made the
decision that I wanted to be around
writing more than anything else.”

Gra uating in 1963, she went to New
York City, and got a job as secretary to
the editor of McCall’s magazine. Hers
is another classic literary story: that of
the novice editor who starts reading
the “slush pile” of unsolicited manu-
scripts, and works her way up the lit-
erary ladder.

She displayed a talent for finding
and nurturing best-sellers at William
Morrow publishers, then for making
subsidiary rights sales at Simon &
Schuster, then having her own imprint
with Simon & Schuster. She was
named president of Simon & Schuster,
then joined Random House, where, af-
ter a corporate shuffle, she was named
publisher.

Supervising literary superstars such

as James Michener and Norman

Mailer, plus finding writers of the
future, still boils down to finding 8

good story, Ms. Evans says. And
quality books are thriving as never

before.

“For the first time, you’re seeing;
Margaret Atwood, Anita Brooknery
Iohn Irving, Toni Morrison — real;
artists — finding a big audience,‘
finding a mass audience. Look at

Tom Wolfe, a reat example (with
The Bonfire of the Vanities). The fact
that these kind of writers can break
through, sometimes to the number-

one spot on the best-seller lists»

shows that this country cares about

having a good reading experience»

cares about uality fiction.”

‘Good Morning, Vietnam’ story began at WPGH

ne of the hit movies of the year
0 actually began when Pittsburgh
native Adrian Cronauer arrived on
the Pitt campus in 1957. “I asked
Somebody where the campus radio
Station was and they looked at me
like, ‘Huh? I've never heard of such
athiI18’-H
Cronauer and some friends con-
vinced student government to give
them $200 for a transmitter, and
WPGH took to the air. Later,
Cronauer joined the Air Force, and
with his broadcasting experience he
became a disc jockey, winding up in
Saigon as a D] for Armed Forces

Radio at the height of the Vietnam
War.

In 1979, Cronauer and a friend wrote
a TV treatment of his adventures, and
after many rewrites and changes, it
became “Good Morning, Vietnam,”
starring Robin Williams.

However, “If I had done everything
that Robin Williams does in the film, I
would have been court—martialed and
I’d still be in Leavenworth,” Cronauer
said, in a visit to the up-to-date studio
for WPTS.

The movie’s depiction of military
censorship is closer to the mark, he
said. “Everything had to be cleared

with the information officer from
(General William] Westmoreland’s
headquarters in Saigon, which
meant that nothing of any news val-
ue could be read over the air.”

Now a law student at the Uni-
versity of Pennsylvania, he added,
“I’ve got to tell you that some of the
scenes in the movie brought back
memories a little more vividly than
I cared to remember.”

Kuntu honors
Wilson

As the prestige of playwright August Wilson
continued to grow, the Kuntu Repertory Theatre
honored the Pittsburgh native with a presentation
of his award-winning play Ma Hainey’s Black Bot-
tom.

Ma Rainey was directed by Dr. Vernell Lillie,
founder of Kuntu Repertory Theatre. The Kuntu
Writer’s Workshop was founded by Wilson and by
Rob Penny, the current playwright-in—residence at
Kuntu. The workshop and the theater group are
separate, but both operate under the Black Studies
Department at Pitt.

“Kuntu” is one aspect of an African world-view
in which there is no “art for art’s sake.” To sim-
plify, in this philosophy art ties in with the com-
munity’s overall aims and goals; art is not seen as
something alien to the community, but part of the
community.

Since its conception in 1974, the Kuntu Rep-
ertory Theatre has raised social consciousness
about black history through drama.

Other plays scheduled for the 1987-88 season
included The Dilemma of a Ghost and A Love
Celebration: The Ebony Man and Mahogany Wom-
an. (Lorey Kelley in The Pitt News.)

See the world to find yourself
by Deborah Kaufman

Some may find it strange that
in an issue devoted to welcoming
freshmen, I’m making a plug for
leaving the university. I'm not
talking about renouncing this
“bastion of higher education,” I
am advocating a temporary
leave-of—absence in the shape of
study abroad.

I remember with a startling
clarity the feelings I had after I
stepped off the fourth and final
plane that carried me the last leg
of my trip to France — I felt, God
forbid, like a freshman

The journey began in early Ian-
uary. In fact, my stomach hadn’t
yet recovered from a New Year’s
Eve party, which had turned into
an emotional farewell to all my
friends. It wasn't until later that I
realized my nerves had a lot to do
with that upset stomach. (Denial
is one of my strongest defenses
sometimes. I had convinced my-
self that I would take to foreign
travel like a yuppie to Perrier.
Leaving my home would be the
proverbial piece of cake.)

I learned a lot about transcon-
tinental travel in the 48 hours it
took me to get from Pittsburgh to
Cannes. It was seven airports and
five countries from start to finish
and, almost needless to say, my
luggage took a detour along the
way. It was a full week later be-
fore it caught up to me  just
when I had gotten used to the
idea of buying a new wardrobe in
France.

After a month-long orientation
period on the Riviera, I was off to
Paris. All the cliched school—girl
fantasies were with me on that
north-bound train. There are
honestly no words to describe
how I felt that night as I traversed
the City of Light in a taxi bound
for my “family’s” apartment. I'm
sure the driver got a chuckle out
of my attempts to comment on

the sights en francais as we
crossed the most scenic parts
of the city.

I was one of the luckier stu-
dents when it came to living
arrangements. Students study-
ing abroad sometimes board
with families, often single par-
ents, widows or older couples
whose children have left
home. My family, though, was
complete with two older chil-
dren — warm and welcoming,
considerate and sometimes
concerned.

The Ferals were also noble,
as in royally descended. That
fact allowed me to experience
things that the typical foreign
student doesn’t: I traveled to
their country chateau (15 bed-
rooms) for a weekend, I hob-
nobbed with colonels, generals
and higher-ups in the Ministry
of Defense and, the piece de
resistance, I met President Mit-
terand at an awards ceremony
where Monsieur Feral re-
ceived the National Order of
Merit.

Besides those events that
caused me to write home with
more school—girl enthusiasm, I
experienced the day-to-day
life of another culture. It was
simply living in that foreign
environment that left such an
impression on an impression-
able mind, even more so than
the many memorable events
that highlighted my trip.

And there were so many of
those memorable events. I
probably chose one of the
worst times to study abroad.
The value of the dollar was at a
new low; international terror-
ism and anti-American senti-
ment reached new heights. But
that was half the fun. (My
mother loses sleep when I say
things like that.) I got to dodge

bombs, meet Libyans, travel to
the Soviet Union — all the things
a semester abroad should in-
clude.

In my opinion, there is simply
no better way to study abroad.
Yes, you learn the obvious: a for-
eign language, foreign customs,
international etiquette. But more
than that, you discover parts of
yourself that were perhaps hid-
den under the cloak of famili-
arity.

The time I spent in France was
a turning point for me. It was the
first time in my life that I was
able to truly be myself. Before I
left everything and everyone be-
hind, I had always been defined
by those things and those people
— my parent’s daughter, a Pitt
student, a business major, my
boyfriend’s girlfriend, my sib-
lings’ sister. There were a num-
ber of different roles, but I was
always me in relation to some-
thing else.

Going away from all of that let
me define who I was on my own
terms. In many ways, it was a lot
like my freshman year all over
again. Although people would
have you believe that being a
freshman is the lowest pursuit, it
allows you certain inalienable
rights: the right to experience for
the first time.

Going away is something eve-
ryone should do — even if you
aren’t a language major. There
are experiences for everyone;
sights, tastes (be courageous ——
everyone should try tripe at least
once), sounds, smells (avoid
small, enclosed, populated areas,
and keep an open mind, not an
open nose), feelings. What you
can get out of it is a lot more than
proficiency in a language.

Semester at Sea brings world to students

by Kerri Hamilton

A Semester at Sea is more than
just another semester of college.
It’s an opportunity for students to
get hands—on experience with the
problems, the people, the culture
and the issues of the world.

The voyage around the world
takes place on a ship called the
S.S. Universe. It’s an 18,000 ton,
floating university. The ship is
complete with everything from
classrooms, library, bookstore
and student union to a dining
room, a hospital and several sport
facilities including a swimming
pool and volleyball court.

Semester at Sea is offered twice
a year: during the fall term from
September through December
and the spring term from January
until May.

While at sea, the student will
spent 50 percent of his or her
time on board the ship and the
other 50 percent in the countries
of call. Port calls range from 3 to 7
days. They give the student the
opportunity to explore the coun-
try.

The complete voyage takes stu-
dents to 10 countries, including
Spain, Yugoslavia, the Soviet Un-
ion, Turkey, India and Malaysia.

The academic program on
board is based on the University
of Pittsburgh’s curriculum. The
credits earned while on board the
ship will be put on the student’s
permanent record and will be ap-
plied toward graduation.

The classes meet every day ex-
cept Sunday. The courses that the
student take on board help them
to become both personally and
academically ready to explore
each new culture as the ship
moves from one country to the
next.

“The benefits of taking a Se-
mester at Sea are numerous. The
student gains a sense of global
interdependence,” according to
Dr. Angie Yucas, director of the
Study Abroad Office at the Uni-

LL

versity of Pittsburgh.

Yucas said she believes that
the student receives great per-
sonal benefits from taking this
trip —— they become more self-
sufficient, and it really helps to
develop their interpersonal skills.

“Those who participate on this
voyage get exposed to so much.
They see how countries have
military impact on one another.
They see firsthand what Third
World countries are all about.
They uncover so much about the
world in such a short period of
time that many students think of
their experience at sea for many
years to come,” said Yucas.

The courses offered on the ship
are carefully chosen to help en-
hance the student’s learning ex-
perience. The core course is es-
pecially designed to intensify the
awareness of the student to the
world, and its many different cul-
tures and beliefs. The core course
is required of all students be-
cause it is vital that they gain an
understanding of the complexity
of the world, according to the
guidelines of the program.

As well as taking the core
course, students have a wide
range of other classes offered
from which to choose. They offer
anthropology, biological sciences,
business, including several inter-
national business classes, com-
munications and economics, as
well as fine arts, geography, ge-
ology, history and literature. In
addition, they also offer psychol-
ogy, religious studies, sociology
and theater arts.

“Its curriculum is steered to-
ward those individuals who are
interested in any international
field. It’s for anyone who wants to
become a more well-rounded
person,” said Yucas.

While on board, the students
can take part in various clubs or
organizations such as Students of
Service, Ambassador’s Student

Council, Choir, Drama Club,
the student newspaper The
Helm and the student year-
book, The Aft. There are social
activities such as dances, mu-
sical programs and fundraising
events that are organized for
international projects.

“There's always something
going on. Sometimes there is
too much to do and not enough
time to do it all,” said Chris
Smerdel, a Pitt student who
took the trip spring term 1987.
“A lot of students really got
into working out. This pro-
gram has so much to offer,”
said Smerdel.

Semester at Sea is a once in a
lifetime event. “What ap-
pealed to me most was the dif-
ferent countries we were ex-
posed to. There was so much
variety. The thought of it re-
ally gets my blood pumping,”
said Smerdel.

To be eligible for this voy-
age, students must have a cu-
mulative GPA of 2.5 or better.
Although students with a GPA
of 2.0 and 2.5 will be reviewed
on an individual basis, admis-
sion will be based upon each
student’s status.

The cost of the trip is higher
than that of typical semester. It
ranges from $8,109 to $9,675
depending on accommoda-
tions. “Very few students who
take this trip are concerned
with the cost,” said Yucas.

Financial aid is available for
those with financial need. The
University Center for Interna-
tional Studies grants three
scholarships to students who
carry a 3.0 or better and who
demonstrate financial need
and can justify relevance to
both academic and career
goals.

“A TA You Would Like” BY IUSTIN LAUHEAD

How many times have

you entered a classroom
and instantly became intim-
idated by the atmosphere?
The class size, a distant pro-
fessor, and the infrequency
of classes tend to alienate
teacher and pupil. A polit-
ical science TA tears down
this barrier and turns it into
an educational opportunity.
Ellen Dorsey, a Pitt graduate
and political science TA,
does this job well.

Ellen worked together
with professor C. S.
Gochman on a 1988 winter
term World Politics course.
Her responsibilities includ-
ed: teaching a recitation sec-
tion, creating paper and test
questions, and grading as-
signments.

“A TA has to explain and
expand on lecture material
in a clear and coherent
way,” said Ellen. But she
has to conquer many prob-
lems when doing her job.
One difficulty is not letting
her own opinions interfere
with the professor’s inter-
pretation.

“The TA’s job is to en-
hance the professor’s inter-
pretation of the material,”
explained Ellen. “My own
separate opinions inter-
mixed with professor
Gochman’s approach would
only confuse the students.”
Ellen will use her own ap-

proach to world politics
when she teaches the
course in the summer.

But TA’s are a new phe-
nomenon to the political sci-
ence department. The Pitt
administration is conduct-
ing an experiment to see
whether students react bet-
ter in a small class with one
teacher or in a large class
with recitation sections. But
this experiment also creates
problems for the learning
process.

The new large class struc-
ture makes it difficult for
TA’s to teach their sections.
“TA’s have to adapt on the
run,” explained professor
Gochman. Since the class
only meets twice a week,
the professor does not pos-
sess much ﬂexibility when
teaching the class. He has to
quickly know" whether or
not the students are under-
standing the material.
“Ellen has to gather student
responses about class lec-
tures,” said professor
Gochman. “She is an impor-
tant factor in eliminating
the distances between the
professor and the students.”

This new relationship
creates some advantages
and disadvantages for Ellen.
The obvious disadvantage is
the heavy workload. But
the TA position offers some
rewards for Ms. Dorsey. Her

working relationship with
the professor and students is
a training ground for future
teachers.

Ellen’s success as a TA has
impressed professor
Gochman. The judgments
she has made when creating
papers and tests have shown
the abilities of a future pro-
fessor. “When considering a
person’s educational future,
you have to cite a distinc-
tion between teaching and
research,” explained the
professor. According to
Gochman, Ellen has the per-
sonality of a teacher. “She is
outgoing and a political ac-
tivist,” said professor
Gochman, “These are per-
sonal qualities of a person
who wants to present her
knowledge to students.”

Ellen also wants to fulfill
her teaching responsibili-
ties. “IfI didn’t help the stu-
dents, I would quit at once,”
said Ellen.

Ellen will have a chance
to complete this objective
when she teaches her own
world politics course in the
summer. “Pitt undergrads
are smart kids,” said Ellen.
“Some just have inferiority
complexes that keep them
from participating.” Her job
is to get past this shield and
work with the students to-
ward achieving a better un-
derstanding of the subject.

Philosophy Dept. among the best.

he Greek philoso-

pher Aristotle would
have been proud. De-
spite a decline in inter-
est in the humanities
since the ’70s, the phi-
losophy department at
Pitt has managed to sur-
vive and even thrive.

Many people may not
realize it, but located in
the Cathedral of Learn-
ing is one of the most
distinguished depart-
ments at Pitt. The phi-
losophy department is
recognized as one of the
most outstanding in the
country. As a matter of
fact, the department
was named the second
best, behind Princeton,
ahead of Harvard, in a
ranking chart by Time
magazine in 1983 and
has since topped charts
and surveys as one of
the best schools.

Dr. Joseph L. Camp,
chairman of the depart-
ment, said, “The de-
partment was brought
to its present state by a
group of faculty who
came to Pitt in the early
1960s. They consisted of
Nicholas Rescher, who
is a university professor
of philosophy and pres-

ent director for the
Center of Philosophy of
Science; Adolf
Gruenbaum, who is a
Mellon professor of phi-
losophy; Kurt Baier, dis-
tinguished professor of
philosophy, and Wilfred
Sellars, university pro-
fessor of philosophy.”

“They brought in sev-
eral other outstanding
philosophers over the
ensuing years. At the
same time, the depart-
ment recruited a large
number of very prom-
ising junior faculty
members who were
subsequently promoted
to tenure rank, and the
department was gradu-
ally built up,” said
Camp.

Rescher and his col-
leagues believed then
that there was still room
in American philosophy
for another department.
They began with a de-
partment for the philos-
ophy of science and
gradually built it up.

The department
sponsors a number of
programs. A series of
lectures is conducted
every year at Pitt by
leading philosophers.

A large number of vis-
iting fellows come from
all over the world to
give these lectures.
There are normally 10
to 20 lectures and con-
ferences each month.

The presence of both
the philosophy depart-
ment and the depart-
ment of history and phi-
losophy of science has
made Pitt an attractive
place for graduate stu-
dents in the depart-
ment, the majority
working toward their
Ph.D.

Virtually all the grad-
uate students come
from out of state, some
as far as Australia.
“These students are
very gifted. Entrance is
extremely competitive,
and only 5 percent or
fewer are accepted,”
said Camp.

The graduate pro-
gram at Pitt is mainly
geared toward educat-
ing future professors.
Those receiving Ph.D.
from the department
have traditionally gone
on to become faculty.

Some memories don't fit a pigeonhole. (1) Freshman Dean Andrews com-
peted in the ping-pong tournament in the William Pit Union. (1) An
example of Danish Christmas decorations. (3) The “O” remained a place to
hang out and eat fries. (4) Seasonal decorations brightened The Carnegie.
{5} Tracy Barnabas and Evan Davis wait to check in people at a career
seminar. (6) Charles Gottschalk dodged traffic on Forbes Avenue. (7)
Sitting too long in the dim lights of the Cathedral of Learning can bring on
a nap attack. (8) Pittsburgh’s damp weather can make the campus seem

gray.
