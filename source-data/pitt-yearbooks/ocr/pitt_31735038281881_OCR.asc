1982 morlsed Pitt's entronce into the mighty
Big Eost conference ond exit from the Eostern
Eight. The Eostern Eight become the Atlontic 10
ond the Big Eost brought highly regorded ploy-
ers like Tony Bruin, Ed Pincl<ney, ond Potricl<
Ewing to Pittsburgh. The Ponthers boslsetboll
seoson opened with on eosy victory over \Vest-
minster before o closh with the Duquesne
Dulses. Although Pitt ond Duquesne now repre-
sent different conferences, the cross-town rivoi-
ry is still olive. This yeor Pitt prevoiled o2-53.

Pitt trovelled to Syrocuse for their first Big Eost
conference gome with o 5-3 record. Before
23,608 tons Syrocuse defeoted Pitt 87-oo. Bock
in Pittsburgh, the Ponthers met onother former
conference rivoi on Jonuory 15, 1983. This time it
wos the \vest Virginio Mountoineers ond Pitt
pulled out eorly scoring twelve srroight points.
WVU continued to fight bocl~: ond tools the ieod
or one point but Pitt held on to win 81-07. With o
Big Eost record of 0-4 the Ponthers met the
Seton Holl Pirotes ot the Fieldhouse on Jonuory
22, 1983, ond it turned out to be on historic
occosion Led by Clyde Voughon ond Dilly Cul-
bertson Pitt emerged with o 78-08 victory for
their first Big Eost conference victory.

Following o five point loss to Boston College
Pitt returned home to ploy Providence. At one
point in the gome Pitt troiled by fourteen points

but 0 late steol by Joey Dovid put the Ponthers
oheod by two. At the end of regulotion time
the gome wos tied or 51. It wos still tied ofter
one overtime but o Trent Johnson shot in the
sec ond overtime iced the gome os Pitt won 59-
55.

\Vhen Big Eost leoder ond fourth ronlsed St.
John's come to town Pitt sported o 9-8 overoll
record ond o 2-5 Big Eost record. But, it wos time
for some excellent boll ploying by Pitt ond o little
bit of mogic. Pitt fell behind 5-0 but come bock
to ploy os well os St. John's — even o little
better! Led by top scorers Voughon ond Andre
Williams the Ponthers beot St. John's 72-71. The
next victim of the Ponther mogic wos 1oth
ronl<ed Syrocuse. Mott Miklosevich did o good
job ond shored top rebounding honors with
Culbertson — they both hod seven — ond
George Allen lit o fire under the crowd with his
exciting reverse slom dunk. The finol score wos
Pitt 85, Syrocuse 74. Pitt left the Fieldhouse ond
Villonovo put o stop to Pitt’s mogic ond their four
gome Big Eost winning streols by defeating the
Ponthers 78-65. It wos just o temporory stop
though, for o Februory 19, 1983, Georgetown
ond Potricl< Ewing mode their first oppeoronce
ot the Fieldhouse. Georgetown led by seven
with less thon five minutes remoining but the
Ponthers come bocls to defect mighty George-
town o5-o3 os Clyde Voughon scored 22
points.

Pitt could do nothing to top the three upsets
ond they closed their seoson with o (34-53 loss to
eventuol Big Eost chompion St. John's. Clyde
Voughon wos the Big Eost's leoding scorer over-
oging 22 points in the seventeen Big Eost gomes
ond he wos o third teom selection to the All-Big
Eost squod. The finol seoson record for the Pon-
thers wos 13-15 ond their Big Eost record wos (3-11
but the newest member of the Big Eost brought
boslsetboll fever to Pitt with its mony thrilling
gomes.

The 1982 field hockey season resulted in a
disappointing 3—8 record. After their last
game of the season coach Cindy Baldridge
and the team members were not discour—
aged as they looked ahead to the next sea
son with another year of experience under
their belts and with nine of eleven starters
returning, next season looked bright. What
the team did not realize after their final
game of the year against LaSalle was that
that game had been the final game ever.
Late in November it was announced that the
field hockey program was being eliminated
due to budget cuts. The hope of more suc—
cessful seasons on the horizon was dashed
and the last year of field hockey at Pitt would
be remembered as a losing season.

This year's team began by going winless
the first month of the season which con—
tained four games Their first win came on
October 2, 1982, in a victory over Indiana
(PH). It was a hard fought victory as the score
remained knotted at 00 after regulation

rime and two overtimes. Pitt gained its first
victory of the season when the tie was
broken during the filckoff. The final score
was 32. In the Pitt tournament held the
second weekend of October, Pitt played lost
to Ohio University, Slippery Rock, and Frost
bury. The team posted its last victory of the
season in its home game. They defeated
Washington and Jefferson by the score of 5-
0 Although goalie Colleen Ahern played
well all year it was the first game in which
she and the rest of the team held the oppos»
ing team scoreless.

The two senior tri-captains on the team,
Colleen Ahern and Margie Hall, knew they
were playing their last season at Pitt, but iri-
captain loura Ron and the rest of the under-
classmen members of the team thought
they would be back in 1983 to improve their
record. However, it was not meant to be.
1Q82 was the last season of competition for
the Lady Panther Field Hockey team

There wos no undefeated seoson, no no-
tionol chompionship, no Heismon trophy, but
there wos everything else. Through four
yeors these seniors compiled 0 42-6 record,
the best onywhere. There were mony All-
Americo honors — Don Nlorino, Jimbo Co-
vert, Julius Dowlslns —— ond Acodemic Ail-
Americos J.C. Pelusi ond Rob Fodo. There
were numerous records set, four straight
bowl oppeoronces including victories in the
1979 Fiesta Bowl, 1980 Gotor Bowl, ond 1982
Sugar Bowl, ond Don Morino finished in the
top 10 Heismon voting the lost two yeors.
Throughout these four years every fon wos
treated to mony thrilling victories ond intense
rivolries, ond ot seoson's end the Ponthers
were olwoys ronlsed in the top 10. To the
twenty-five senior members of the 1982 Pitt
Ponthers, thonlss for the memories.
Records Were Mode to be Broken . . .
ond these Pitt records were in 1982 —

September 9, 1982, morlsed the begin-
ning of the Ponther footboll seoson. The
North Corolino Torheels come to town fec-
turing Kelvin Bryont. The Ponthers ond new
heod cooch Foge Fozio left Pitt Stodium ond
trovelled to the lights of Three Rivers Stodium
for o notionolly televised Thursdoy night
gome. The hoiftime score wos 8-0 in fovor of
the Torheels —— not exoctly whot most fons
hod in mind on this worm Thursdoy night!
But, the defense wos mighty ond the big 0
come out steoming in the third quorter driv-
ing 69 yords for 0 score. The final score: Pitt 7,
North Corolino o. One point is oil it roles!

The next gome wos ployed or Florida
Store in weother thot wos less thon ideol in
the second holf. Not only did Pitt hove to
bottle the Seminoles, but they olso hod to
overcome noture ond bottle the monsoon-
iii<e weother. Pitt won both encounters ond
come from the gome with 0 37-17 victory.
Next on Pitt's trovel itinerory wos 0 meeting
or Chompoign, Illinois. Brought olive by Dove
Puzzouli's 95-yord interception return the
Ponthers defeoted the lllini 20-8.

Bocls home on October 2, 1982, was 0
showdown of two of the Eost’s beosts — the
Ponthers and the West Virginia Mountain-
eers. At the end of three quarters Pitt trolled
180. This teom was not reody to go down so
the fourth quorter belonged to the Ponthers
os Don Morlno drove the teom downfield for
two scores on route to becoming Pitt’s oli-
time coreer totol offense leoder. The de-
fense odded 0 safety ond on ottempt by
WVU to tie the gome with 0 long field gool
fell short. The finoi score; Pitt lo, \VVU 18.

Game five was the Pitt Homecoming
gome which the Ponthers won eosily over
the Temple Owls. The finol score was 88-17.
In gome six the Ponther defense put togeth-
er its first shutout os Pitt defeoted Syrocuse 14-
O. in o tune-up for the Notre Dome show-
down Pitt demolished Louisville (>8-14. Then
come Notre Dome. Pitt led 13-10 going into
the fourth quorter but 0 long touchdown
poss erosed thot leod ond Pitt trolled with
most of the lost quorter remoining. This foot-
boll teom wos not one to go down without 0
fight so 0 touchdown drive begon. But, the
ort of the \>/VU comebocls could not be re-

Fooﬁibeﬂﬂ Wtt@[;>mtu1[;>>

peoted ond the Ponthers lost their first gome
of the seoson. Finol score; Notre Dome 31,
Pitt 10.

After the letdown of the first defect of the
seoson the Ponthers hod to rebound if they
wonted on invitotion to o mojor bowl. The
next two gomes pitted the Ponthers ogoinst
Army ond Rutgers. Mojor upsets octoss the
country together with two Ponther wins
brought Pitt o Cotton Bowl invitotion ond on
outside shot or the notionol chompionship.
The Ponthers were in control of their own
destiny (if they could get 0 little help from
Penn Store or the Sugar Bowl) — consecu-
tive victories in their finol two gomes ond the
notionol title could deservedly be cloimed by
the Ponthers. Unfortunately the finol two op-
ponents were mojor obstocles stonding in
the woy -— the Penn Store Nittony Lions ond
the SMU /vlustongs.

The Penn Stote gome come first. On No-
vember 26, 1982, Pitt trovelled to Beover
Stodium to visit the Nittony Lions. Pitt ployed
well in o gome filled with mony ploys to
remember ond tolls obout ond Pitt led or
hoiftime 7-8. However, noture ogoin deolt o
nosty hond in the second holf, this time in the
guise of 0 wind storm. The wind ond being
pitted ogoinst 0 strong ond eventuol notionol
chompion Penn Stote teom were more than
the Ponthers could hondle. Although Pitt out-
goined Penn State in totol yords 397 to 359
the Ponthers were on the short end of the
comporison thot counted most — the finoi
score. it read Penn Store 19 ond Pitt 10.

This teom hod hod such high hopes for the
1982 seoson ond os theyjourneyed to Dollos
for the Cotton Bowl they hod to be disop-
pointed. The offense seemed to be just 0
step owoy from exploding ond the defense
yielded on overoge ofjust 12 points 0 gome
