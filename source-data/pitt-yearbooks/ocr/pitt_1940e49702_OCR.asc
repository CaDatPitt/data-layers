SNG OUR THEME

Wii have tried to edit this volume of THE OWL
with a good-natured, tongue-in—cheek, modern
treatment. The formalities of dedications and
editorials have become passé. But we do, here,
want to explain the signiﬁcance of our theme.
Polly and Peter represent more than just a
publicity stunt. In portraying them, We strike
our only serious vein. They personify the real
students of the University of Pittsburgh, not
necessarily the bookworms nor the heads of
activities. Rather they are the normal and
average healthily-successful man and woman. ‘
They are the sincere and the modest, but not the
ideal. Yes, they might cut a class in the spring-
time to lie on the Cathedral lawn to discuss
campus political gossip; they might violate an
occasional regulation. But in them we ﬁnd no
traces of the superﬁcial, only the sincere. In
these pages We shall ﬁnd them  every
photograph and paragraph——they are..tlie type
of student that make us proud to calil,-Pittloiir

Alma Mater. 

  

grand knock—about summer

ded on that day in September

* and Peter Pitt Walked up the
campus to register for their last year at
the University. From then on it was a
mad scramble: hearty hand—shakes, smil-
ing tanned faces, beaming professors with-
out "that tired look.” In the midst of
registration we ﬁnd them together at the
desk of a professor—to—be. Not too early
to polish a few apples. Early Fall cere-
monies such as the Druid Smoker and
Lantern Night separated Polly and Peter
temporarily. We did snap them, though,

white shoes and all, at the Screwball Hop

which heralded the Fall social season.

AND SUCH

SATURDAY afternoons found Polly and
Peter rival section leaders in the Demon-
stration Block; but the prize for the most ‘
noise went to the band. The peak of foot-
ball season came with the downfall of
Tech. Peter secretly gloated. That Tech-
man of Polly's would be taken down a few
pegs now. Need we add that our campus

couldn’t wait for the planned Victory

campus news events and personalities of the
year burlesqued in a spirit of good, clean fun.
The outstanding piece of news was the trustee
investigation of the University; therefore, the
top—hatted, bearded little men crawling all over
the place. The Duquesne mob invasion of the

campus, the sororities’ futile attempt to clean

up politics, the football teams ﬂight to
Seattle, and the elimination of hockey from
the sports program comprise some of the
episodes which might need clariﬁcation.

ALL WORK
AND NO PLAY

POLLY and PETER didn’t get through all
these years without meeting up with those
three floors known as Libraries, "cram-
halls," or what have you. We see them
here exuding an almost ethereal radiance
as they wear out an elbow or two on the
sturdy study tables of the Reference Room.

Can this be the same irresponsible couple

  
 
 
 
 
 
   

that ﬂit around the eighth and twelfth
floors respectively five days each week?
Comes examinations and an unnatural calm
settles over the Cathedral, all elevators
point for the ﬁfth floor, the birds cease to
sing, the grass grows longer, and Polly
and Peter "hit the books."

    

F OR a change the mid-winter season
brought more banquets and a ﬂock of
traditional formals. Polly participated in
the celebration of Women's Day at Which.
time the women of the University honored
themselves and famous Pitt women before
them. Peter Was drafted into attendance
at the Druid banquet. The “oomph”
dancer erased all his earlier doubts about
going. The top of the social season
reached a climax with the Silver Anni-
versary celebration of O.D.K. at the Uni-
versity Club. Polly and Peter scraped
ankles in that yearly spectable, the Mili-
tary Ball. Can you ﬁnd them in the mob?
We couldn’t either.

As the golden autumn leaves ﬂuttered
downward (this from our freshman English
themes) in a most irritating fashion, Polly
and Peter served as aides at the Chancellor's
Reception for parents of freshmen. All was
sugar and honey until the last parent passed
through the revolving doors. Within two
minutes Polly and Peter were surrounded
by those fellow aides “going to town" on
the remnants of ice cream and hors-
d'oeuvres. The Interclass Sing gave Polly
an opportunity to add an unharmonious
throat to her not too melodic class—which
ended up losing. Peter whiled his time
away chatting in the Commons Room,
“col<ing" it in the Tuck Shop, and devour-
ing another skimpy meal at the Football

Banquet. What, another banquet?

BILLS for cleaning white ties and e '
wraps hit the maximum as Polly and
donned their formals to enjoy a glee
concert, and to be ﬁrst—n.ighters at '
Players’ presentation of Three Mm On
Home. The annual style shows alway
packed the Schenley ball—room. Polly re-
fused to model, but Peter strutted out on
the stage in a plaid jacket, covert trousers, V
barges, etc., all for $17.95. Polly wasn't
impressed by his board—trodding. She
leaned back, closed her eyes, and thought
of the time her favorite maestro, Hal
Kemp, led the Pitt Band between halves
of a football game.

SPRING wafted in between snow—drifts and
brought with it strange emotions to the
heads ofour Pittites. Nomination ofsenior
queen candidates, a few baseball games,
Spring Festival, and traditional Tap Day
tumbled out of the calendar. Peter pre-
sented thejunior Spoon to the outstanding
third year man of the year; Polly marched
in the Senior Queen coronation ceremony.
Their year was closing. That day in
September when they had registered to-

gether wasn't so long ago.

PCLLY and PETER sat down on the cam-
pus and looked across Friek Acres to Heinz
Chapel. The rays of the June sun were
mixing brilliant color patterns in the

stained—glass windows.

JOHN GABBERT BOWMAN
C/mncellor of the Univer.rity

A big man on campus, the most popular girl, a senior

activities woman, a fraternity brother, and an up—and-
coming Junior side—by—side walked into the office of
Chancellor Bowman. It was Thursday afternoon, time
for another Fireside Chat. Time to meet and know john
Bowman. No sooner had they gathered around the huge
ﬁreplace with its hand—wrought iron grating then they
found themselves conversing with the Chancellor about
dormitories, science hall, finished class rooms, changed
curricula, educational systems, and ideals. Through it
all was one idea, the appreciation of beauty, and appre-
ciation for the best in every culture, Dr. Bowman's
philosophy. The Cathedral stands as a solid reality of
this philosophy.

Polly and Peter Pitt, their smoking rooms, libraries, and lunch

with the editors of the Owl, Pzmtber, and News, and as a member of
the committee on Religion he helps to plan services held in Heinz
Chapel and to organize Religious Emphasis Week; his responsibilities
include both student and faculty affairs. But behind all the provost’s
activity as well as behind all Pitt activities stands Mr. Weber, the
man who signs all the checks for the University. In the past years
Whirl of incomes and outgoes, bills, and cancelled checks he did not
forget to place one big item on the credit side of the budgetAthe

MEET THE GOOD DEANS

Among the busiest administrative officers at Pitt are the deans of
the schools. All of them are men experienced in their fields; men who
have devoted their lives to research, study, and administrations; men
who understand the natures and problems of Polly and Peter Pitt.
Each of the deans works constantly to raise the standards of his school
and to bring greater recognition to the University.

The University of Pittsburgh is divided into many separate and
distinct schools, seven of which are presented in this section. The
largest, of course, is The College, guided by Dean Stanton C. Crawford.
Other under—graduate schools are those of Business Administration,
administered by Dean Charles S. Tippetts; Engineering and Mines,
Dean Elmer Allen Holbrook; Education, Dean Frank W. Shockley;
and Pharmacy, Dean C. Leonard O'Connell. Among the graduate
schools are those of Medicine, with Dr. William S. McEllroy as Dean,

and Denistry over which Dr. H. Edmund Friesell serves as Dean.

BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION

How to Obtain a job after graduation is the problem
most often brought before Dean Charles S. Tippetts by
his student friends. “The most practical solution," he
points out, “is to do well in undergraduate work of the
chosen phase of business.” To the end that students in
the school might better achieve the solution, he con-
ducted classes in business orientation which he fre-
quently supplemented with personal conferences.

Working with Dean Tippetts in the training of future
C.P.A.’s, secretaries, salesmen, and commercial teachers
is a qualiﬁed faculty whose members are recognized
authorities in business. The only major change made in
the faculty during the year was the appointment of
Miles H. Jones to succeed James C. Reed who resigned as
head of the business law department.

Dean Tippetts’ own experience is Varied. He earned
a Phi Beta Kappa key and a Ph.D. degree at Princeton,
studied at Harvard Law School, served two years in the
Army at home and abroad, and taught at the Universi-
CHARLES S. TIPPETTS ties of Iowa, Seattle, and Buffalo before coming to Pitt

Dean of the Sc/oool of Bmiazem Adminirtralion in 1935.

30

THE COLLEGE

Although Dr. Stanton Crawford is
equally at home with a detective story, on
a tramp steamer, studying a Phyllostoma—
tida (leaf-nosed bat to us), or investigat-
ing a question of local history, he can or-
dinarily be found in the quietly business-
like College office, directing the activities
of the largest undergraduate school in the
University. Dr. Crawford began teaching
Biology at Pitt in 1924, received his Ph.D.
and became head of Johnstown Center in
1926, and returned to the main campus in
STANTON C. CRAWFORD 1933. He still devotes some of his time to

Dam 0f the College biological research, and he is an enthusi-

astic reader; but a very particular interest

is in questions of education. While he
polishes his glasses, Dr. Crawford will tell you that the most signifi-
cant development of the year in The College is the Humanities course,
planned for students who wish to postpone professional training until
after graduation. By learning to understand the creative work of the
past, Humanities students are better able to take part in the construc-
tive work of the future.

 

DENTISTRY

Although a long six years’ grind, the School of
Dentistry, headed by Edmund H. Friesell, is one of the
most popular schools of all, and the "dents" are known
as the most uniﬁed and loyal students in the University.
Occupying three buildings on campus, members of this
school also have classes in the Skin and Cancer Clinic,
Montefiore Hospital, Falk Clinic, Children's Hospital,
and Magee Hospital. The Dental Library, housed in old
Mellon Institute, has one of the most complete collec-
tions of dental literature in existence. In all, it contains
over thirty thousand volumes, among which are many
early and rare volumes. This year, special dust-proof and
moth—proof cases for display of material in the School’s
Teaching Museum were secured. Both the Dental Li-
brary and Museum originated from Dr. Friesell’s private
collections.

Dr. Friesell's outside activities include heading the
dental departments of St. Francis and Children’s Hos-
pitals and the Western Pennsylvania Home for Crippled
Children. He is also an advisory fellow of Mellon Insti— EDMUND H. FRIESELL
tute. Dean of the 55/900! of Dentixtijx

31

EDUCATION

Added this year to the positions which give Frank
W. Shockley the distinction of having the longest title
in the University was that of acting dean of the School
of Education. Dean Shockley is also director of Exten-
sion and Summer Sessions, and director of late afternoon,
evening and Saturday classes.

Formerly active in public school work, then in ex-
tension study at the University of Indiana, Dean Shock-
ley was also assistant to the dean in the extension divi-
sion at the University of Wisconsin, and in 1925 came to
Pitt. His chief interests are in the Junior colleges at the
Erie and Johnstown centers where students receive in—
struction similar to that given in the ﬁrst two years at
the Cathedral. He ﬁnds that after two years of study in
these schools, nearly 70% of the students complete their
undergraduate work in the University.

As a member of the board of admission, Dean
Shockley reviews the qualiﬁcations of many prospective
teachers. Under his administration, the requirements

_ _ _ FRANK W. SHocKLEY

for entrance remained unaltered, with continued em— Dam of ,5, 56500; Of E[,;um,,-M
phasis being placed upon scholarship and teaching

aptitude.

ENGINEERING AND MINES

Supplementing his work as head of one
of the country's highest ranking technical
schools, Dean Elmer Allen Holbrook of
the University's Schools of Engineering
and Mines is kept busy in his position as
chairman of the Pittsburgh district of the
American Institute of Mining and Metal-
lurgical Engineers.

Formerly Dean of the Graduate School
and of the Schools of Engineering and
Metallurgy at Penn State, Dean Holbrook
has gained experience in his ﬁeld through
his work with the United States Bureau
of Mines at Washington.

ELMER A. HOLBROOK This year, the Schools of Engineering
Dmn of the School; of Engineering and Mi72e.r and Mines have shown a greater trend
toward growth and development in the
number of students and faculty members,
in equipment, in methods, in public interest, and in contributions
to engineering, science, and practice than ever before. Comprising
the seven main divisions of the school are the departments of Civil,
Electrical, Industrial, Aeronautical, Mechanical, Chemical, and
General Engineering.

 

32

MEDICINE

"Most people know what it means to be a patient.
Few stop to consider what it takes to make a competent
doctor." These are the words of Doctor William S.
McEllroy, present Dean of the Medical School.

As Dean, he provides adequate and progressive facili-
ties for the advancement of the student doctor as well
as the entire medical profession. In the laboratories,
fundamental medical. sciences are taught in such a way
that the student learns by individual application of
scientiﬁc method; and he has access to ﬁne medical li-
braries. At the hospital, the future medico acquires
experiences with diseases and develops skill in diagnosis
and treatment. A dispensary furthers the development
of practical knowledge.

Since his graduation from Pitt’s Medical School in
1916, Dr. McEllroy has served on its faculty and in
January, 1939 was appointed Dean. He was formerly
University tennis coach, and now serves on the faculty

WILLIAM S_ MCELLROY committee of athletics, in addition to working on his
pm” of me 35/900; of Medicine research of pernicious anemia, blood pigment, and the
kidney functions.

PHARMACY

The students who report to the building at Pride
Street and the Boulevard of the Allies for practical
experience in the study of pharmacy may be “off cam-
pus," but they are still a part of Pitt and Pitt life. Under
the able guidance of Dean C. Leonard O’Connell, the
School of Pharmacy has further proved itself a credit to
the University, for it ranks at the top in its ﬁeld.

Since his appointment in 1932, Dean O’Connell has
worked constantly to raise the standards of the School,
and most important, he has used his vast knowledge of
youth in helping his students to solve the problems
that confront them.

Active in civic affairs, Dean O'Connell is chairman
of the board of managers of the Juvenile Detention home,
and president of the Civic Club of Allegheny County.
A past president of the Pennsylvania Pharmaceutical
Society, he spends his spare time writing for the publica-
tions of his profession. Dean O’Connell's degrees in-

OFFICE OF DEAN OF WOMEN

LIFE BEGINS AT 1209

A lift with a cup of black Chinese tea, a summer
camp job, a dab of Run-Stop for a snagged triple—sheer,
a glimpse at the latest fashions in Mademoiselleﬁall can
be had on the twelfth ﬂoor.

Here Dean Amos advises Polly Pitt on the more seri-
ous side of her campus life. Always alert to the needs of
Pitt women, in her progressive program she has been
instrumental this year in transforming the dingy, color-
less Women’s Lounge of Thaw Hall into a restful Blue
Room, and has taken particular interest in housing on
campus. She has also arranged luncheon conferences for
those women students having special problems and need—

ing special attention.

Assisting Miss Amos is Miss Helen Poole Rush, aide-de—camp of many distressed

committee—women, and ex—Miss McLaughlin, now Mrs. John Holland, who will

help you find that room, only a five—minute walk from school. Petite receptionists,

Kay Sturm and Pittite Jane Key, will make an appointment for you.

OFFICE OF DEAN OF MEN

LIFE BEGINS AT 809

Looking for Peter Pitt? Try 809. Even if you don't
find him there, someone will be sure to tell you where he
is; for the oﬂice of the Dean of lVIen is the oflicial home
of Peter and all the other men students outside of the
classroom. There undergraduates assemble and are coun-
seled by its kindly and efhcient head, Dean of Men,
Dr. Vincent W. Lanfear.

Keeping several hundred
fellows busy and happy is a
diﬂicult task for one person,
so the Good Dean has di-
vided his responsibility
with Theodore VV. Biddle,
director of extra—curricular
activities; Robert R. Corley,
administrator of the social
and honorary fraternities;
and Edward B. Williams,
director of the men's em-

During Freshman Week
and through the Orienta-

his assistants keep in con-

ing so that Pitt life becomes,
for the men, much more
than lectures and textbooks.

A FEW OF THE FACULTY
THEY GROW ON Us

In the rush and din of a big University, there is activity
everywhere; and it is not only the students who get head-
aches over classes, who romp madly from elevator to stairs,
and who tap typewriters or go in for extra activities after
school. The faculty gets around, too. In its more lofty
moments, it writes books, institutes new courses, improves
departments, edits magazines, and acquires high—sounding
titles.

Books written and published by faculty members in
the past year would make a good—sized shelf, perhaps a
little unusual for bed—time reading, but certainly varied.
Dr. N. A. N. Cleven’s The Political Organization of Bolivia
would rub Covers with Enjoying English, by Ellen Mary
MR_J_G1LBERTQUICK Geyer and Don M. Wolfe. For lighter moments there

U,,m,.,,-U R,.g,~,,W would be Dr. Leland Baldwin's best-selling novel, The
Delectahle Country, an historical romance of the days of the
whiskey rebellion, and Edwin L. Peterson's No Life So
Happy, which started out to be a technical ﬁshing manual,
but now hides the technicalities pleasantly among stories
of ﬁsh and ﬁshermen. Genuine works of erudition are
Dr. Carl Engleder's Calculation; of Quantitative Analyciy,
Dr. William A. Yeager's Honie—School—Coinniunity Relationr,
Dr. Florence Teagarden’s Child Psychology for Profemional
War/em", and Dr. Richard Hope's A Guiole to Reading; in
Philoiophy.

Besides writing books, the professors spend some of
their leisure time contriving new and different courses for
adventurous students. In the sub—basement of the Cathedral
there is, of all things, a seismological laboratory, where
Donald C. Bradford and his students now record the vibra-
tions of earthquakes, and, sometimes, of down—town

planet than into it, James Stokely of Buhl Planetarium
has instituted a “Man and the Stars" course. Emerson
Venable teaches another new course, Industrial Hygiene.

Throughout the year, the Fine Arts department, under
Walter R. Hovey, has brought distinguished people to
the University to discuss subjects related to the seventh
ﬂoor art exhibits and to classroom studies in art apprecia-
tion. (Incidentally, one of the exhibits featured a group
of paintings done by faculty members.) The department
of Music Appreciation has become popular as more and
more students discover the library of recordings and the
listening rooms on the fourth ﬂoor. Theodore M. Finney,
head of this department, was one of the appointees of the
year, becoming editor ofa national music teachers’ journal,
The Mimic Tenchem” Nntionczl Auocintion Bulletin. Among
the other appointments were those of Dr. 0. E. Jennings,
head of the biology department, chosen as an expert on
conservation to advise army engineers in a new project;
and of Dr. Manuel C. Elmer, head of the sociology depart-
ment, who is aiding in the reorganization of the American
Sociological Society.

Something unique in university publications is Pin‘,
edited by Agnes L. Starrett, assistant professor of English,
and featuring on its cover a facsimile of the signature of
William Pitt, namesake of the city and the school as well
as the new magazine. Published to interpret the University
to the community, Pitt is very popular with high—school
students, who like the authentic picture of college life in
the ﬁne—screen photographs and the faculty—written articles.

We could write on and on about faculty achievements;
we could even mention the less lofty moments such as table-
tennis in the gymnasium, learned discourses (no doubt)
over lunches at the Faculty Club, and the emancipation
of Mr. Corley's moustache, but we won't become gossipy.
The wings of THE OwL must remain unclipped.

0/; 7/re Record

NO MATTER HOW TIGHTLY SCHOOL CALENDARS TRY TO BIND PITT LIFE TO
a schedule, sometimes it overﬂows and goes its own way. Off—the—record events sometimes do
not make the Neuu, but they always make between-class conversation. Dolly Dawn and a pep
rally on the lawn instead of fourth hour class; the progress of the Kathedral Kitchenette from
sawdust to Chinese Red leather and chromium; unedited wisecracks at the Fashion Show; a sudden
fall of ﬂuffy snow making a Christmas—card setting for Heinz Chapel . . . These are the momentous
matters Peter and Polly whisper about while the teacher raps for attention.

TWO UNSCHEDULED FOOTBALL CELEBRATIONS BROKE THROUGH THE MONDAY
routine last fall. Duquesne students who got the idea of storming the Cathedral were all wet,
for enterprising students on the second and third ﬂoors discovered hoses and water buckets, and
used them efficiently. A little later, irrepressible Pitt students jumped a planned celebration of
the victory over Tech by three hours, leaving their second hour classes to march behind the band,
letter the score in lipstick on the Tech campus, and trail through the town, casually acquiring
Community Fund ﬂags (and a following of police) as they went by.

THE BIGGEST SURPRISE OF THE YEAR FELL FROM HEAVEN ON VALENTINE'S
Day to blanket the whole city in white. (The big snow of 1940, children—we don't have winters
like that any more.) The professors tucked their trousers into big black galoshes, co-eds plowed
manfully through big drifts in childishly gawky snow pants, and almost everybody came to
school, at least by sixth hour. But the surprising ladies almost outdid the weatherman when
they threw their no—politics bombshell, a resolution for a political cleanup among women's
fraternities. And the freshman women created another upset at the Interclass Sing, when, with
a sweet—and—simple presentation of the Wizard of Oz, they demurely relieved the Juniors of their
twice—won trophy.

A REAL CHRISTMAS PARTY IN THE COMMONS ROOM, WITH POINSETTIAS AND
evergreens, was a relief after the rush of finishing term papers. With their fingers sugary from
Mrs. Miller’s doughnut surprise and with crumbs of candy around their mouths, the lowly fresh-
man and the hardboiled B.M.O.C. wandered around together with a blissful, peace-on—earth
expression on their faces. They hummed softly in an off—key fashion when the Chapel choir sang
the old carols; fought whole—heartedly for a bag of the candy Santa Emil Narick was tossing out;
and together applauded the magniﬁcent catch of Chancellor Bowman.

FOOD FOR CONVERSATION WAS PROVIDED BY A NUMBER OF BRAIN—TURNING
publicity stunts, including a perfumed Pam‘/oer’ and a miniature Plymouth Rock; but more serious
discussions were concerned with Dr. Bowman’s reply to the committee of Directors who investi-
gated administrative conditions at Pitt, or about the possibility of completing the Cathedral,
extending the library facilities, and building dormitories and a student union. And two serious
innovations were the student opera (Dido and Aeneas) and the poetic symphony.

SPRING FINALLY CAME, ASSISTED A LITTLE BY BROTZMAN OF THE WEATHER
Bureau and Perring of the Panther. With spring came a crisis for the students who drive to school,
when a two—hour parking restriction was placed on some of their favorite parking spots; came
also a new organization, the University Council, to act as an advisory board of faculty members
and deans; and an early election battle.

OTHER UNEXPECTED EVENTS OCCURRED THIS YEAR—SPONTANEOUS, UN-
PLANNED, sometimes disreputable happenings that made some people laugh and others swear.
But why go on writing them down? Lectures must go into note—books, but no one needs notes
to remember how the biology prof looked the time he found a frog’s insides in his pocket. Perhaps
such highlights as these will be remembered best if they are kept—oE the record.

They Wear Yellow Chrysanthemums

Polly and Peter may not look any different after the last ceremonies of gradua-
tion, but somewhere there will be a change; for Polly and Peter, no longer mere
"stoodents," will have attained the dignity of Alumni. As such, they may join the
Joe College and Betty Co—ed models of yester—year in the General Alumni Association
of the University of Pittsburgh. United by all the ties which graduates of the same
University have in common, the members of the Alumni are divided into still more
intimate interest groups according to the school they attended at the University.
Polly may belong not only to one of these groups but also to the Alumnae, for ladies
only. From each division, three representatives are sent to Alumni Council.

. . and Debate Over Trustee Elections

Alumni do more than just recall bygone days together and wear big yellow
Chrysanthemums at football games; through their association they carry on organ-
ized activities. The Alzmmi Review is published six times a year. This year there is a
trustee election. Pitt Clubs are formed through the association for alumni too far
away to attend the Pittsburgh meetings. But the activity best known to under-
graduates is the celebration of Charter Day, which this year included a variety show
in the Foster Memorial. Features by talented alumni, the girls’ chorus from Cap and
Gown, and Men's Glee Club made it a whiz—bang showﬁa grand reunion for those
who “usta—be."

Dr. C. L. Lewis, '72, the
oldest alumnus, and George
B. Palmer, '99, the grandson
of Robert Bruce, ﬁrst princi-
pal of W.U.P., talk over old
college days on Charter Day.

To be selected Senior Queen by
her class—mates is the highest honor
a woman at the University may
attain. Miss Gregg has not only
beauty and intelligence, but she has
that sparkling charm and refresh-
ing gaiety which inspires popular-

ity and friendliness.

 

Nominees for the position of Senior Queen were these
ﬁve co—eds who share the limelight as the outstanding
women of the Class of ’40. They are Miss Glenda
Fitch, Miss Patricia Elmer, Miss Betty Batty, Miss Betty
Teal, and Miss Gregg.

Miss Fitch in the role of Alma

tainly no queen has had a lovelier

attendant than Miss Fitch.

LEADING SENIORS OF ’4O

Each year ten senior men and ten senior
women are selected to the Hall of Fame
of the University. These outstanding stu-
dents have risen to campus prominence
after having proved in four years to possess
the qualities of good character, wise and
capable leadership in activities and scholar-
ship, and all—around good fellowship and
sociability.

They are chosen by an authoritative
committee composed of ﬁve juniors and
two faculty members.

Practically a snap, that Freshman year: upperclass counselors for
Peter and Senior Mentors for Polly. Saturday night rushing parties
and mixer dances helped Peter meet Polly. Then glorious afternoons
munching hot—dogs at the football games and being part of the gold-
and—blue Demonstration Block. First big formal, maybe with Peter
and orchids. Small informals and lots of fun dancing and gabbing
with his friends from Freshman Camp and her friends from unit and
mentor groups. Their first Spring Festival Week—tea dances, sweep-
stakes, Tap Day, Carnival Night—Spring Formals, and long walks
and picnics in Schenley Park—worth cutting classes for.

Into a glorious Sophomore year; Cwens for Polly, and Druids for

Peter. Beating the four o’clocl< deadline for the news, and selling
advertising for You Know What! More dances, more friends, more

picnics, and more cuts! Why go to a 1:30 class when GWTW is in
town?

On to the Junior year. Polly has her share of work as a unit advisor
and as a Panhel representative. Peter is becoming well known as a
junior member in SFA, and as rushing chairman in his fraternity.

That undergraduate life is real stuff, isn't it? Between the peppery
round of Pitt’s social calendar and the themey ever—increasing circles
of the class calendar, Polly and Peter have a high old time of it. Ahead
of them lie—but why get serious and professional? For the present,
we'll let them be undergraduates; it’s a gayer life.

To the freshman, S.F.A. is merely the Sam Goldwyn of Pitt, the
sponsor of free movies that ﬁll in Thursday afternoons; but to the
upperclassman, S.F.A. stands for an organized student—governing body,
one that aims at a closer relationship between the average student and
the University. It is to this end that the standing and temporary
committees, under the guidance of the Student Faculty executive
committee, have been set up.

Last fall, when the University appropriations were cut, S.F.A.
action resulted in an appeal to the state legislature by the entire
student body and faculty, with a consequent restoration of funds as
well as an added appropriation for the University medical center.
Following the close of the football season, during which the pep
assembly committee rallied Pitt scholars and socialites to rah for the
team, a new University tradition was rooted with the S.F.A.-spon-
sored football banquet. Variety marked the entertainment—an

address by Chancellor Bowman, short speeches by the coaches of the
local college football teams and members of the varsity, singing by
vivacious Adele Yorio, and even some hula—hula. Through a special
committee, it has also made more friendly athletic relations with
other schools in the district.

Besides entertaining students with four-bell pictures, the Essefay
theater introduced a cultural and instructive aspect to its movie pro-
gram, “The Other Side of Town" showing “one of the best known
slum areas in the world," the Hill district of our own city of Pitts-
burgh; went beyond its safety campaign in an attempt to stave off
the possibility of students and faculty car—owners losing all parking
places around the Cathedral.

However, S.F.A.’s most prominent and active season comes in
springtime when the annual political hub—bub between fraternities
and independents over gaining a majority of seats reaches its full and
foolish climax at the polls.

Two weeks before the ﬁrst formal, the Junior Prom, Peter found
himself without a stiff shirt—and broke. But not for long, for he
soon found that he could rent one at the Men’s Tuxedo Exchange on
the eighth ﬂoor. It was also through Men’s Council that he picked
up that crazy hobby of collecting Tuck Shop sandwich wrappers, and
learned to write a punchy letter of application for a job. Through
the Book Exchange, also found on the eighth floor and headed by
George Hartman, he kept himself in date—rnoney by turning his old
but unthumbed text—books into cash. During the hectic beginnings
of classes last fall and at mid—semester, this second-hand book store
was readily accepted by classmates of both Peter and Polly as a place
to purchase that much-needed Ogg and Ray’s American Government,
Modern European Hiytory, or American Literature. Proceeds contribute

to the Student Loan Fund which is open to all students in need of
ﬁnancial aid.

This year, as when Peter was a freshman, the Council’s major
activity was the men’s customs~an eight—week project that orients
the newcomers to the life of the University. Conducted during the
Orientation hour, the class leaders gave the freshmen an idea of “what
it is all about" by discussing University history, activities, B.M.O.C. ’s
fraternities, and other topics of interest with them. At the end of
Customs, golden Panther keys were awarded to approximately seventy
of the outstanding boys at the Freshman Honor Court in Foster
Memorial Hall—for scholarship, activities participation, and per-

sonality.

Polly Pitt couldn't quite make up her mind about the Women's
Self Government Association. Of course, it was number one on her
activities list, for Polly and her class sisters became members of
W.S.G.A. at the Green Arm Band Ceremony as soon as they came to
Pitt. Yet she wasn't quite sure; \V.S.G.A. insisted upon such crazy
instructions. Wearing that green arm band took away the glamor of
her smooth new suit. It simply screamed “Freshie." Then too,
W.S.G.A. took time away from her dates  by requiring her attend-
ance at things called Lantern Night . . . “Sounds silly to me"—and
mentor meetings “What’s a mentor?"—and mixer dances
“Foo, I want upperclassmen!" However, Polly decided to give these
things a try; she had little choice in the matter, anyhow.

Polly Pitt is quite sure about W.S.G.A. now. In her language

“lt‘s swell!" In the language of a truly educated person . . . “It’s
a fine group of girls carrying on traditions of supreme beauty." Polly
regrets that arm band period is over; it was fun. People answered
your most foolish questions seriously, mistakes were overlooked, and
oh yes,~the dates! Lantern night? Well, Polly couldn't (even with
her smooth vocabulary) find words to describe its beauty; this was
the first year that it had been held on the Cathedral campus. It made
Polly realize that traditi()ns and customs were a part of Pitt life. She
is looking forward to the Coronation of Senior Queen, now. Her
mentor had described the Old English coronation held in the Com-
mons Room and made each girl anxious for May and Coronation time
to come. Of course, Polly won‘t forget that she owes the prestige
of her merit panther and her place in Pitt as a woman, to W.S.G.A.

The Owl is a fat book which appears
every May after nine months of work writ-
ing articles on organizations no one cares
about. It has a separate oﬂice far enough
away from the other publications to pre-
serve the reﬁnements and culture which
mark the members of the OWL staff. The
editor is addicted to printing “leg art"
pictures and leaves town the day before
publication.

The Pemther is a magazine published
monthly which contains brief paragraphs
labeled “jokes." It sells for ﬁfteen cents to
those who don’t get “comps" and who fall
for super-salesmanship while waiting for
elevators. It has a lovely editor who calls
herself Fanny Panther and delights in doing
such things as selecting the most eligible

men on campus.

C472 if he the female editor who attract: there
lovely thing: to the PANTHER oﬁce?

So successful was the production of Our
Town, that it gave a third “command” per-
formance two weeks after its regular billing
last May 9 and 10. Not only was Our Town
the most ambitious eﬁort of a season of hit
plays, but it was the most difficult, for its
author had a theory to prove as well as a
character study to present. Thornton Wilder
deliberately omitted scenery from the pro-
duction, believing that it only served to
detract from the characterization of the roles.
He also decided that only the stage manager
should speak since the audience needed some
explanation to replace the settings, and that
otherwise, the play was to be pantomimed.

With only a table, two stepladders, and
some chairs for settings, then, the Players
portrayed events in the lives of George Gibbs
and Emily Webb.

‘7/wee Men on a J/cwte

138

Newest comedy addition to the Pitt Players
repertoire, Three Men on at Home, was staged
in Stephen Foster on November 2 and 3.

Dramatizing a portion of the life of Erwin
Trowbridge, professional verse writer, the
play combined the writing of greeting card
verses and the “doping" of horse races in a
highly entertaining fashion.

Coming to New York, Erwin falls in with
two men and a girl who are making a poor
living ﬁguring the races. On his tips the trio
bet and win several times. They become
Erwin’s managers and make him place a large
bet himself. This is all that is necessary to
ruin Erwin’s miraculous powers; he loses,
and vowing never to “dope" another race,
returns to his job in time to write a number
one greeting for Father's Day.

 

PITT PL AYERS

PITT PLAYERS

eauwle/ad-G1-[ma

Turning to more serious drama for their
second show, Pitt Players introduced their
audiences to George Simon's, Conn.te!or—nt—
Law, on December 7 and 8.

Threatened by the disclosure that in his
earlier and more idealistic days, he had re-
sorted to illegal means in order to save a
a young client from life imprisonment, the
counselor—at—law, interpreted by George
Veinegar, is faced with a crisis in his life.
At this trying point, he is deserted by his
wife and friends, until ﬁnally he becomes
disillusioned to the point of deciding to
commit suicide. But Simon is dissuaded in

this decision by his secretary in whom he
ﬁnds true love at last.

The entire student body was “summoned"
to serve “jury duty” and their decision on
the case was unanimous~“guilty of pro-
ducing an outstanding performance.”

 

74¢ HJJM7 Mac/tine

Following the successful reception of
Thornton Wilder's Our Town, the Players
again delved into the unusual when they
produced Elmer Rice's T/oe Adding Machine
on the Foster stage, March 14 and 15. This
time, they selected expressionism, a realistic
dramatic form, to carry their ability across
the footlights.

Through ﬁve scenes of gloomy and fore-
boding atmosphere, the satire moved, un-
folding the obsessions of timid Mr. Zero
who murdered his boss after having been
ﬁred following twenty—ﬁve years as a cog in
the vast machine of modern business.

In an impressionistic setting of the Elysian
Fields, Zero apparently fulﬁlls the penalty
for his crime by serving as operator of the
largest adding machine in Heaven for twenty-
ﬁve years. That his ever—degraded soul must
go back to earth to serve another body is
his ﬁnal doom.

Your Fingers” was written by Frank S.
Miller, C41, and was presented before a
student and public audience in the Nixon
theater the week of April 29.

Written in two acts and eight scenes,

Adkins, director of the Stanley theater
orchestra, and arranger for Cap and Gown
for several years, became musical director
of the show.

"Snap Your Fingers" was typically Cap
and Gown. Everything worked out in the
end; everybody found a soulmate, everybody
found economic security, and all——including
the audience—sung the Alma Mater.

MOLDERS OF SECOND LIEUTENANTS

You needn’t be alarmed with any talk of war scare around the
University today, because the Cathedral has its own War Department
and a "national" defense program, manned by a commissioned and
enlisted personnel with a combined total of 52 years of service to the
University. It isn’r particularly important whether the five commis-
sioned and ﬁve non—commissioned ofﬁcers have located anti—aircraft
batteries at strategic points on Frick Acres, or whether they have
mapped every one of the Cathedral's 36 ﬂoors, however, because they
serve a more serious purpose. Under the direction of Colonel Hol-
combe and Lieutenant Colonel Gantt, the military staff trains basic
and advanced students in Pitt’s Coast Artillery and Medical units of
the Reserve Oﬂicers’ Training Corps. And in addition they supervise
the activities of the Pitt Band, one of the largest military bands in
the nation; Pitt Riﬂes, honorary drill unit; a chapter of Scabbard and

Sergeant Chester Hanover, Sergeantjarnes W. McDonald, Techni-
cal Sergeant Alfred Gunter, Sergeant Walter I-lardison, Technical
Sergeant Eddie Evans.

AND LOVELY CO-ED OFFICERS

Blade, national honorary military fraternity; the R. O. T. C. riﬂe
team; and the co—ed sponsors who “keep up morale and make the
military routine more interesting.” This year there was one addition
and two promotions to the personnel, Lieutenant Colonel Wilson was
promoted to Colonel, and Technical Sergeant Evans received his war-
rant as Master Sergeant. Sergeant Murrie Underwood will be attached
to the University beginning June 1.

The freshman who registers for Military Science 1 does so volun-
tarily. He then undertakes two years of instruction under these
oﬂicers so that he will be proﬁcient in the basic arts of soldiery, and
have some knowledge of anti—air-craft and ﬁxed sea—coast artillery.
Two years later, if he is physically qualiﬁed, this student will be
commissioned in the advance corps, and upon graduation, be com-
missioned a second lieutenant in the organized Reserves.

Elite of the R.O.T.C. . . . expert gun—toters . . . Eve of the
Military Ball on March 29, ten members of the advanced R.O.T.C.
unit were tapped to membership in Scabbard and Blade as outstanding
representatives of the senior and junior classes . . . During the fol-
lowing week, the ten proved their right to the distinction when they
successfully completed the rigorous course known in military circles
as Hell Week 2, M.T.W.Th.F., no credits, with a final “Hell Night"
test . . . Prior to this big event, in the early part of the year, ten
student oﬂicers were tapped at a private Scabbard and blade dance held
across the Avenue in Hotel Webster Hall . . . Smokers, to which all
members of the advanced corps were invited, introduced candidates
for membership in D Company, seventh regiment of the national fra-
ternity, to the aims and activities of the campus organization .

Other speakers were Dr. Miles Jones and Dr. James B. Blackburn,
faculty advisors . . . Although the honorary does not give snap
courses in self—defense or guarantee that its members will pass the bar
after sweating for the first three ﬂunks, at its monthly meetings it
brings together those students who have one common interest~law

. and led by a prominent speaker provides for a more adequate dis-
cussion of legal and economic problems.

Lost All Bets This Year

When the first six weeks exams were threatening last semester, the
potential "medicine men" of Kappa Psi relaxed at a smoker . . . Dr.
Bernard Daubert, Professor of Pharmacy, and Dr. C. Leonard O'Con-
nell, Dean of the Pharmacy School and the ﬁrst Grand Vice—Regent of
the Executive Chapter, were honored guests . . . Twice, last fall,
together with the rest of the dope—makers down the Boulevard, the
boys, betting odds in favor of the Panther booters, came out on the
paying end . . . Net result: two I.O.U.’s, one of 1000 silver—coated
blaud pills to Fordham U., the other, 1000 licorice pills to Duquesne
. . . Once a month, capsules and pills were forgotten when the fel-

lows dined out at Child’s . . . supposedly, to discuss pharmaceutical
problems . . . Together with the spring rains, the pill rollers show-
ered their one and onlys with Corsages of sweet violets and roses for
the last formal dance of the year . . . at the Hotel Henry.

Campeting at the Pam-He!/mic Sing

They Receive Freshmen and Sip Tea and Sponsor Sings and Sip Tea and Eat Progressive Dinners
and Sip Tea

Fraternity women had to eat and run as constantly changing groups moved from
one fraternity house to another for each course of the progressive dinner arranged
by Panhellenic Council under the direction of Hulda Tully and Evelyn Green. End-
ing up at Heinz House for their ice cream and cake, they sang and listened to the
favorite song of each fraternity to top off an evening that was truly panhellenic.
With the first winds of March, this Panhellenic ingenuity blossomed forth among
the individual fraternities in a bustle of rushing parties. From Hawaiian beach
to Farm Frolic, from Circus and Nursery Rhyme parties to swank fashion shows
and formal banquets, whirled petite Polly Pitt, until she saw the Greek letters from
Alpha to Zeta riding by on a merry—go-round.

After the traditional Freshman Reception and the Transfer Tea, fraternity
women again met together at Heinz House; it was February and time for the Inter-
fraternity Sing. With history as a theme, Betsy Ross, Thomas Edison, and Martha
Washington swung out against each other, until the T.P.A. Villian ﬂicked his
mustache and Theta Phi Alpha's “Gold Rush" struck ore and the trophy. For
splendor in spring formals, the Council once more reserved the Urban Room, and
Evelyn Green led fraternity women and their escorts at the Panhellenic Ball. A
popular part of Spring festivities, the women's fraternities’ ﬂoat parade with its
pantomimed song titles passed the reviewing stands. When the last ﬂoat trailed
out of the stadium, Panhellenic Council ended another season in fun and good
sororship.

ALPHA DELTA PI

First love of Alpha Delta Pi is that new apartment furnished by the girls them-
selves . . . left off matching rust cushions and gold draperies long enough for a
fall tea at the William Penn . . . then back went the A.D.Pi's to their waxing
and painting . . . On the social side, actives of Alpha Delta Pi got into the glitter-
and—tinsel mood with a winter formal at the Dormont Century and followed it up
with a party around the Christmas tree at prexy Jane McCracken's . . . the Valen-
tine shindig at Wilma Lovrencic’s home featured palpitating hearts under the spell
of a leap year fortune teller . . . A.D.Pi’s chose April Fools’ Day to fete the pledges
and the Marge Kuhbach—Jane Musser combination kept heads spinning with their
version of a roulette game . . . After the strains of the Spring Dance music had
drifted away, the A.D.Pi's threatened to camp through summer vacation in the

shade of that cozy apartment.

The Theta kite again ﬂew over the social world with each Theta gal swinging

Wray . . . Cavorting after the games on football Saturdays, the Thetas shortened
their skirts a la Daisy Mae and chased their men at a Sadie Hawkins dance .
Early in December they were back in their swishiest formals for an evening of dinner
dancing with the Kappas from over Dithridge street way . . . It was a glittering
holiday all around from the shiny Christmas tree to the new sparkler on Marion
Briney’s engagement ﬁnger . . . A special prize goes to the soror with the greatest
gain in quality points, so books and papers were the Thetas’ playthings 'til after
exams . . . At annual Slumber Party they snuggled in pajamas and furry slippers,
and gossiped through the winter night . . . Soon, quick as a warm breeze and a
young man’s fancy, came new chiffons and the spring formal to end another year of
Theta events,

. . . June Staib brought in a Christmasy mood with red, green, and silver fir trees

Jannie Marg Collins, secretary of Phi Mu, were quite mystiﬁed by the chopsticks
at the Chinese luncheon . . . Jannie, however, taught everybody how to eat

dreamed of Glacier National Park and the National Convention.

TAU ALPHA

 

“Pride of our hearts, Zeta Tau, Zeta Tau,’
sang the chorus around the fire in South Park
where early—bird Zetas roasted corn and wei-
ners at a pre—school Jamboree . . the Kesslers
and Mel Perring ﬂipped Vacation thrills across
the embers instead of ghost stories . After
this social warn1—up all the Zetas were set for
that gay, jolting hayride to Hoﬁ"meyer’s with
slacks, overalls, and straws in their hair .
Saturday night house dances hit the big top in
December when Loisbelle Pryor became ring-
master and the girls had a circus with pink
lemonade and pop—corn balls . . Then visit-
ing national officers called for special entertain-
ment and grand scale Zeta hospitality led by
prexy “Smyles" Wilson . . Snow and black
Velvet reigned over the winter formal at the
Churchill Valley Country Club . . . But more
than one Z.T.A. reigned over a publications
oﬂice, the “Y", W.S.G.A., and the gym at Pitt
this year.

F LA S H !
AS WE GO TO PRESS . . .
Interfraternity Council, on Tap Day, awarded plaques to the five men who have in

their four years at the University contributed most to fraternity circles both in inter-
fraternity relations and in their respective chapters.

Honored from the class of 1940 were:

Henry Derocher William Edmunds James Kennedy Richarcle Weiss Walter White
Pi Kappa Alpha Phi Gamma Delta Delta Tau Delta Pi Lamhda Phi Sigma Chi

They Issue Booklets and Have Dinners and Make Rules and Have Dinners and Break Rules and
Have Dinners '

The fact that the Phi Delts won the interfraternity athletic cup, the Pi Lams
took top in scholastic honors, or that the Phi Gams copped the Intramural All-
Point trophy makes no difference when I.F. Council hang up their hats together.
Once a month, the executive committee and two representatives from each fraternity
assemble at a dinner meeting in one of the Greek houses. In spite of the adherence
to Parliamentary procedure, the meetings are conducted informally. In regard to
the prohibition of beer parties, the Council maintains that dignity is something
you can't preserve in alcohol.

"A new practice instituted this year was the awarding of a scholarship plaque
to the house whose Freshmen class had the highest scholastic average. Another
innovation was to issue to all freshmen: a booklet discussing fraternities and fra-
ternity life in general, this in addition to the regular handbook. Thus, no longer
will prospective rushees be ignorant of the mysteries of a fraternity.

With Jim Kennedy behind the gavel, I.F. Council wound out another successful
year in its social activities. The most ﬂambouyant affair was the I.F. Ball at the
Schenley Hotel on February 23 and orchestrated by Richard Himber. During the
course of the year, I.F. sponsored the Yuletide Festival, the I.F. Sing, and a Christmas
food gathering for the Pittsburgh needy.

Minus the fan—fare and notoriety caused by the great
number of resignations that reached the Athletic Director
James Hagan's desk during 1938-1939, the sport scene at the
University took on a brighter outlook this year.

If one event could be selected as outstanding in Pitt’s
sports program since September, the plane ride to Seattle for
the Washington game would head the list.

Although Goldberg, Woodruﬁ‘, and hockey were sorely
JAMES A. HAGAN missed, the athletic squads rated keen student support and
Director of Atwm-U gained fair results in competition.

With only Dick Cassiano returning from last year's varsity eleven,
the 1939 edition of the University football team opened its initial
season under the gridironship of Charles W. Bowser and his new staﬁ’.

The first three games on the schedule, which included an airplane
ride across the continent, ended with victories, and the sports writers
of the nation ranked Pitt as the number one Contender for national
honors. The fourth game jinx interrupted the winning streak when
fumblitis gave the Duquesne eleven a hard—fought victory. The fol-
lowing ﬁve encounters resulted in two triumphs and three defeats for
the Bowser warriors.

Highlights of the season were the two thrilling victories‘ over the
foes that upset the Panthers’ "Dream. Backﬁeld" last year. Twice
Pitt came from behind to eliminate Duke from the undefeated ranks,
and a last minute touchdown pass spelled defeat for the Carnegie
Tech Skibos.

In Defense of Ear-muffs

The 1:30 bus splattered yesterday’s rain water on Polly Pitt’s anklets as she
hurried through the boisterous crowd on Bayard Street. Glancing ahead, she spotted
Peter leaning against the mail box on the corner of De Sota and O'Hara. He was
sporting those ﬂashy ear—muHs, almost blocked out of view by his pork—pie hat.
With the usual “Hyah kid," they shoved on to the stadium.

Five minutes later they pushed up to gate seven, produced their student books
and “passport" pictures, and entered without further diﬂiculties toward section F
of the cheering block. After they wormed into the blue and gold capes, Peter
resignedly reached into his pocket and extracted a two—bit piece to purchase a pro-
gram before Polly could heckle him for one.

Polly, in the customary manner of the typical female football fan, bothered the
already irritated Peter with scatterbrain queries, but she received few replies. The

new ear—muff fad is not only fashionable but also practical.

PITT 27—6 WASHINGTON

Combining an aerial attack and an airplane ride to
Seattle, the Panthers connected for 12 passes in 18 at-
tempts to down the Huskies in the opening game. Joe
Rettinger scored the season’s first touchdown, and
Cassiano and Kish contributed to the scoring.

 

223

I940 RESUME OF

PITT 20~O WEST VIRGINIA

Cassiano’s spectacular run of 43 yards for the open-
ing touchdown proved fatal for the Mountaineers. Dick
Fullerton recovered a teammates fumble in the end zone
for the second marker, and Ernie Bonnelli added the
third score on a short line smash.

 

PITT l4—\13 DUKE

The Panther underdogs came from
behind on two occasions to upset
George McAfee and his Blue Devils
mates. Emil Narick's two accurate
touchdown passes to Cassiano and
Ben Kish's two place—kicks accounted
for the home teams points.

 

PITT 13~21 DUQUESNE

Twice within four years Du-
quesne's under rated eleven knocked
the Panthers from the ranks of the
undefeated. The Jungle Cats scored
two quick touchdowns, but Dame
Fortune gave the Dukes a helping
hand and aided them to come from
behind to triumph.

 

PITT 13-27 FORDHAM

Fordham took advantage of the breaks to gain re-
venge over the Pitt gridders and even the series at one
victory apiece and three scoreless ties. Dennery, Ram
end, intercepted a Panther fumble on his own one—yard
line and scored the winning touchdown.

GRIDIRON SEASON

PITT O—1O PENN STATE

With center Leon Gajecki starring on the defense,
the Nittany Lions won their ﬁrst game from the Pan-
thers in two decades. It marked the first time this season
that the air—minded Jungle Cats failed to score. State
held the upper hand throughout the game.

 

PITT l3~14 NEBRASKA

Nebraska ﬁnally scored a victory
over the Panthers in an exciting battle
which marked the ﬁrst Pitt one—point
defeat since the Western University
of Pittsburgh started to play football
in 1890. Injuries deprived Pitt the
use of Kish and Dickinson.

 

PITT 6—O CARNEGIE TECH

Edgar “Special Delivery" Jones hit
the headlines with a bull's eye pass
that traveled 55 yards into the wait-
ing arms of halfback Bob Thurbon in
the end zone for the only score of the
game. The solitary marker came in
the ﬁnal two minutes of the game.

 

PITT 13-7 TEMPLE

Pitt: 13 points for the third straight week gave them
a one touchdown victory over a stubborn Temple eleven.
The Owls scored their lone touchdown on a Pitt fumble.

Well, They Tried Hard

H. CLIFFORD CARLsoN

Coach

 

An in—and-out Panther quintet ﬁnished a so—so season with a record of eight
victories in seventeen starts. Blowing alternately hot and cold, the good Doctor
Carlson’s courtmen looked like one of the country's premier outﬁts in several games
and distinctly mediocre in others.

Beginning the season with a swing through the mid—west, the team dropped
decisions to Butler, Northwestern, Indiana, and Michigan, notching a single win
over Ohio State between the Hoosier and Wolverine defeats. The Michigan fray
was the only over-time battle in which Dr. Carlson's passers participated.

The Blue—and—Gold courtmen returned to the Stadium for engagements with
Penn State and Westminster. The Pittmen nosed out both visiting opponents, down-
ing the Nittany Lions 31-28, and outlasting the Titans 47-35.

Cornell was the next stop for the golden clad Panthers, and the Big Red lost
out in a thrilling game, 38—33. The Panthers ran their victory string to four straight
as they hit the season's high spot with a smashing 73-42 triumph over Carnegie
Tech. The 73 point total established a new Pitt team scoring record, and Eddie
Straloski topped "Chipper Charlie" Hyatt’s individuals scoring mark of 27 point
by looping 13 ﬁeld goals and six charity tosses for 32 points. This fell two points
short of tying the district record set by Tech's Mel Cratsley two years ago against
the West Virginia Mountaineers.

Waynesburg handed Pitt its first loss on the home court, 41-28, with former
Pitt freshman Bob Simmers leading the attack. “Red" Port's 15 points aided in the
sinking of the Navy quintet, and john Billie, sophomore sensation, pitched in 17
points to lead Geneva to a 47-45 victory over the home team after trailing for three-
quarters of the game. Charley Ptacek, senior forward, starred for Pitt.

West Virginia's l\'Iountaineers came north with a good record, but found the
"Kute Kids" blowing hot and fell before the Panther attack, 68-49, Eddie Straloski
topping the scorers with 25 points.

Jimmy Tumpane's last second ﬁeld goal from the 18-foot line gave Carnegie
Tech a revengeful victory over the Pittites, 46-44. Ed Straloski, John Pataky, and
Sam Milanovich were ousted via the personal foul rule early in the ball game.

Pitt finished the season in its typical in—and-out way, routing Fordham at
Madison Square Garden, 57-37, dropping a close 36-29 decision to the Penn Staters
at State College, and closing the season with a loss at Morgantown.

Kicking up Cinders in opponents faces in
typical Pitt fashion, Coach Carl Olson's
track outﬁt engaged in a satisfactory season
of indoor and outdoor competition.

In the Central Collegiate meet, the cinder
crew was second only to Marquette. “Hap"
Stickel and "Bullet Bill" Carter placed one-
two in the 75-yard dash. Stickel's time of
7.5 seconds was just one-tenth of a second
shy of tying the world’s record. Larry
Tregonning captured a second place in the
440 and Johnny Bazyk was runner—up in the
shot put, a quarter-inch short of tying for
ﬁrst place.

Dusty Rhoades’ leap of 13 feet gained him

hurdles, and a second place in the mile relay
accounted for the remaining Pitt points.

A tie for ﬁfth place was all the trackmen
could garner in the I.C.4A. meet. Carter
placed second in the 60-yard dash and ﬁfth

In the New York Athletic Club Games,
the Panthers had only two point winners.
They were Carter and Bazyk, who both
placed third in the 50 yard dash and shot

The Pittmen placed third behind Michigan
and Indiana in the annual Butler Relays.
Among the point winners were Carter,
Stickel, and Bazyk. Carter breasted the tape
in 6.2 seconds in the 60-yard dash with

specialty with a toss of 49 feet, eight inches.

Several dual engagements plus three more
intercollegiate contests were on the Pitt card.
Meets with three giants of the Big Ten, Ohio
State,xMichigan, and Indiana, were scheduled
as well as meetings with Penn State and
Temple.

Coach Carl Olson's proteges defended
their three—year—old grip on the Penn Relays
title on April 26 and 27 and engaged in the
I.C.4A. and N.C.A.A. outdoor meets before
ringing down the curtain on the 1940

Well. ..

“All aboard for the southlands" was the
heralding cry of the Panther baseball nine
as they prepared to open their second season
of diamond warfare after a 15 year layoff.

Thirteen games were carded for the season
with the Duke Blue Devils furnishing the
opposition in the initial encounter. Wake
Forest, Virginia, and Maryland, three new
additions, completed the makeup of the
southern tour.

The diamondmen were inactive until April
27th when they opened a home stay by play-
ing Indiana State Teachers College on the
Stadium ﬁeld. Last year Pitt won over the
Teachers, 6-5. West Virginia's Mountaineers
came to the Stadium for a pair of contests
May 3 and 4. The Panthers split four games
with West Virginia in '39. The home season
closed after a tangle with the Nittany Lions
from Penn State.

Guadzzgnino zzu/airy the pitch

 

A brief Eastern trip followed the short
home stand. Army's horsehide belters were
Pitt's foes on May 18 at West Point, and the
Navy Middies battled Pitt's team a week
later at Annapolis. The Pittmen journeyed
to Morgantown for a brace of contests on
May 31 and June 1, and closed the season
June 8 with an encounter against Penn
State at State College.

A squad composed mainly of veterans
answered Coach Ralph Mitter1ing’s call for
baseball candidates. Pitchers returning from
the 1939 team included southpaws Andy
Johnson and Joe Treolo, and right handers
Joe Pommersheim and Ed Haluska. Johnson
was the most effective pitcher of last season.
Among the newcomers to the pitching corps
were "Lefty" Bob Geiger, a transfer from
Duke, footballer Ed Jones, Jack Brady, Jim
Simpson, and Milt Ripp. The ineligibility
of Jim Egen weakened the staff considerably.

George Hartman and Guy Guadagnino
received considerable competition for the
first team catcher’s berth from Frank Goodell,
senior gridder.

The inﬁeld and outﬁeld saw all seven
regulars returning to their old stations. Ed
Keiper, Al Bush, and Frank Goelz were
pushed by such performers as Charlie Ptacek,
Howdie Updegraff, Joe Klein, and Ernie
Bonelli.

On the inner defense Bob Foliart was a
ﬁxture on third base, Eddie Stralowski con-
tinued his ﬁne work at short stop, Al Hol-
brook beat out a classy ﬁeld to retain the
keystone position, and Lefty Drobnyeski had
things his own way around the initial sack.
Other inﬁelders that added throughout the
season were Snuffy Hughes, Dave and Bill
Meyers, Mike Mitchell, Larry Katz, Glenn
Grubb, and Andy Vaiksnor.

Niblicking through the 1939 season with a not too impressive record of six
victories and a like number of set backs, the University’s golf team were casting
anxious glances toward this year's difficult schedule.

With Tony Kay, Bill Daddio, and Charley Mathias lost by graduation, this
year's squad teed off with many newcomers who were faced with tackling a ten
game schedule plus the National Collegiate Athletic Association tournament at
Manchester, Vermont.

Five of the Panther matches were against foes in the Eastern Intercollegiate
Golf Association. These matches included Cornell and Penn State at State College,
and Pennsylvania, Georgetown, and Princeton at Oakmont. Four of the six losses
incurred last year were at the hands of E.I.G.A. members with Penn State winning
a second match in non-league play.

In a “do or die for Pitt" spirit, the “Big Four," Captain Alex Slobodian,

tank season for the Panther mermen.

With Pat Corr absent from the scene for the first time in 16 years, Ben Grady,
a recent Michigan graduate, assumed the role of ‘coach and caught hold quickly
in his initial season at Pitt. He did much to bring the University into the national
swimming spotlight.

Winning the Eastern Collegiate crown over such opposing teams as Franklin
and Marshall, New York University, Rutgers, and Carnegie Tech was the high—
light of the season.

Herb Cosgrove, Joe Orloﬂ’, Al Sampson, Dick Ames, and Bob Schrader joined
the “Big Four" in garnering the majority of points in competition.

Splattering the bull's eyes with regularity, the University's riﬂe team added

With the majority of matches being of the telegraphic variety, the Blue and
Gold representatives engaged in meets with top notch teams from all parts of the
country plus several shoulder to shoulder contests with local rivals.

Besides the dual matches, the Panther marksmen competed with leading schools
in the William Randolph Hearst Trophy matches and the National Association
Riﬂe competition. a

James Bates, a consistent 380 scorer and a newcomer from Erie, handled the
number one slot for the locals with Larry LaSpada, James Townsend, Kenneth
Schafer, Arthur Stiffey, \Villiam Wilson, and Richard Frankovich comprising the
remainder of the squad.

Returning to the University after a year’s absence, Coach Dr. Dave O'Loughlin
built his team around Kristufek, Francis Harmuth, Edward Goehring, and Robert
Burns, letter winners of last year.

Captain Kristufek was again the outstanding man on the Pitt team in both
singles and doubles matches.

Included in Pitt's schedule were such outstanding teams as Ohio State, Penn
State, Miami U., Navy, George Washington, and Carnegie Tech, and old district
rivals as Indiana Teachers, Slippery Rock, Grove City, Allegheny, and Geneva.

On April 15 the club held a tea dance at the Schenley Hotel which
was a huge success. This dance ofﬁcially opened the Club's social

The object of the club is to "establish a stronger bond of unity

What, Again?

Jack Eitel, Potts, Bill Edmunds, Rex
Williams, Mike Mitchell.

Mixing up an assortment of sports in their due season, Director
James Potts and his able assistant, Ollie Stiff, produced an Intramural
program that far surpassed any previous program of this kind.

Two vital obstacles which had to be contended with were the
long climb up Alumni walk to Trees Gym, site of all sports activities,
and the blustery winter of the past year. These hindrances did the
most to cramp up the schedule, but the would—be athletes cooperated
in fine style, and a minimum amount of difficulties were encountered.

Three leagues, fraternity, independent, and engineer, comprised
the divisions in each sport with the engineers and independents

combining in a few of the sports where the entries dropped off.

INTRAMURAL COACHES

 

Cecil Morgan, Ben Grady, Charles Radi, Steve Horton, James Potts.

Dividing the sports into three seasons, Director Potts kept the

entrants busy throughout the year. The majority of the sports were
conducted by means of the round-robin manner, the exceptions being
football, speedball, and golf in which double—elimination was used.

Football dominated the fall schedule with speedball taking a good
hold on the players in its opening year.

The hardest and longest program took place in the winter when
five sports were run simultaneously. Basketball held sway through-
out with bowling, table tennis, handball, and volleyball keeping the
members of the three divisions on their toes.

A young man’s fancy may turn to love during the spring, but the
athletic—minded gentlemen of the University turned to softball, golf,
tennis, and horseshoes. Swimming and track also managed to be

squeezed in for one day stands.

A bang—up year of intramural battling

began with a two—sport fall program. Lively
competition in football and a curtailed
speedball schedule occupied in the intra-
mural outﬁts. G

Delta Tau Delta, defending champions in
tennis, golf, and horseshoes, had a veteran
team on the field in each of these sports and
looked like a certain repeater. With Jones,
Kramer, and Kennedy handling the golﬁng
assignment, and Hamilton teaming up with
Kennedy in the ringer sport, little hope of
dethroning them had been held.

Newman Club and Oil and Gas faced a
strong field as they attempted to retain their

laurels in golf.

Active games, feasts, outings, and business meetings make up the
calendar of the Women’s Athletic Association of Pitt. The year got
under way at the annual Fall Play—Day when the women on the campus
got a chance to play at whatever sport suited their moods. After fully
recovering from stiff legs and stoved ﬁngers, W.A.A. started work on
the biggest social event of the year, the Bal Mystique. Question marks
served for admission tickets, red diamonds for awards, while original
millinery styles created and modeled by the freshmen were the feature
of the evening. Prexy Joy Hartman did the “Boomps-a-daisy" with
Cap and Gown star, Fred Kelly. Under the guidance of the Mistress
of Revels, Betty Crowe, freshmen presented clever skits aided by
masked W.A.A. members. The nine o’clock curfew put an end to the
fun but not to the new friendships.

The serious side of W.A.A. is seen at the Wednesday meetings of
the board members. Here, officers and committee chairmen plan the

classes in tennis, modern dancing, and swimming. The scent of burn—
ing pine logs lingered in Heinz House long after the Yuletide Feast
was over. A traditional English dinner complete with the boar's
head was served to merrie members and their guests. The toast of
good health and good fun was realized at the Laurel Ridge outing.
Despite frozen syrup for the pancakes, cold feet and red noses, the
girls enjoyed the skating and skiing.

Programs for the March Health Week were aimed at raising health
standards of college women. Co—operating with Women’s Choral in
the production of Dido and Amem, W.A.A. furnished the chorus for
ballet numbers. This meant hours of practice. The fine performance
was their reward. Spring brought Festival Week with inter—class
competition in. outdoor sports. Then the annual good—bye picnic and
plans for an early fall meeting.

We Say “Tbam.és, Very Muc ”

There is little doubt that without the cooperation and wise suggestions of our
many friends in and out of the University this thirty-ﬁfth volume of the OWL would
still be a conglorneration of photographs, rubber cement, galley—proofs, rejected
write—ups, and unpaid subscriptions. I should like to express the sincere gratitude
and appreciation of the staff of the 1940 OWL for those who have worked behind the

scenes.
