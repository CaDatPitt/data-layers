Margaret Morrison, 1912.

Annie aspires to be a teacher and as long as she can see
the funny side of things as she does now she will make

“Isn't it cute?” “Fish” came over from the college to
learn to be a teacher. Nowadays she’s always either just
going to Biology, or just been to Biology, or thinks she
will go to Biology to-marrow. The “Owl” recommends
that she be sent out in the summer advertising corps to

Juniors may talk about having work to do but the word
WORK is little understood or appreciated by anyone in our

and spends four nights a week teaching in the Pittsburgh

“Pat" is most too busy for a girl of her size. If there

then she laughs until you can't. Once in a while she dis-
appears but rumor has it that she is no farther away than
Edgeuvood. Sometimes she rides to school on the ear and
sometimes in the car.

Contrary to our expeetatioizrs Betty has settled down into
a very sedate and competent School Marm. We who knew
her as a Freshman hardly recognize in this .S‘zoiss'zIale

Every one knows her because her. chief accomplishment
is being kind. She makes new girls feel at home, and old
girls ashamed of their inhospitality. She is noted for her
red hair without a temper, and says the charm comes from
the use of Retail.

And yet suspicion seemed to lur/3.
Regarding hours not all

Required by University.

In Canonsbnrg he last no time—-
Engagement, preacher, wedding*rhyine.
Dead now? Oh, no, just married.

Never is he idle now ,‘
Oh, no, not he,
With “benedict" upon his brow.

mention Holder to her and the result will amaze you.
A great mathematical pedagogue Anne will be some day.

believe that one of two things is true; he either knows the
stuff, or he is not sure of his bull. Take notice some of
you fellows and do likewise.

GEORGE WIESE FLACCUS, <I>Z<I>, Pittsburgh, Pa.

Shadyside Academy.
Student Senate.

Well! Well! Look whose here. The boy immaculate.
The true heart crusher of the class. You have to hand it
to him boys, he has tried to be hard, just like Gibby, but
he just couldn’t make it. There may be a reason, maybe
he's never been to Chicago.

JAMES GLOVER GIBSON, Avalon, Pa.

Avalon High School.
Scrub Vvrestling.

Gibby is noted for his hardness, just like Emery. Thinks
that there is no town like Chicago. Is ‘very fond of his
intelligent, pedigreed companion, called “Geraldine” for
short. On general principles Gibby is an “All American"
good scout. His favorite expression is, “She won’t work,
eh? Shoot!”

GEORGE REATCHOUS GRAHAM, Piittsburgh, Pa.

Allegheny High School.
’Var'sity Basket Ball and Baseball.

Now here is a man who we know something about, we
know lie is a lady’s man and he ueed uot deny it. We had
It demonstrated very forcibly one night in Bellevue. But
who could blame the girls, just look at the picture. lVe
agree with you girls.

EDWARD JAMES GRAY, Elyria, Ohio.

VVilliamsport Dickinson Seminary.

There are two kinds of Gray; light Gray and dark Gray.
This is of the first mentioned species. Quiet and mild with
ezrerybody but dark Gray. I/Vheu Gray meets Gray, its
time to duck. You can just [vet that lid is some studeut.
One of the family has to be.

RICHARD GABLE GREER, Magnolia, Ohio.

Howe Military Academy.
Technical High School, Cleveland.
‘Varsity Baseball.

Rivaled Corao/rolls Hill for uu/mpularity until he lim-
bered up his wing and threw a few over the /vlate for Old
Pitt. I/‘hen Triumvate stock went up and they became
f>o[2ular enough to have the AOR formed against them.
If we get to know Greer, we may come to like him.

MARCUS SAMUEL‘ HALL, Lock Haven, Pa.

Lock Havvn Normal School.

The family of Hall ahpeared one class previously in the
form of brother Bill and _Mark fulfilled all e.1'[>ectatious
upon his advent. With such a uame he ought to make his
mark. We admit that the [mu is the lowest form of wit
but this is a thankless task at best.

128

SIDNEY EARL HASSEL, Shatpsville, Pa.

Meadvllle High School.

Most of the fellows wait until their Junior year to go to
fussing around the chickens and birds, but Sidney started
right oil‘ the bat to admire the fair sea’. This may be due
to his rooming with Olie Larson, but at any rate he gave
us a learned discourse on the birds in Schenley Park dur-
ing our “fresh” year.

HAURICE J. HAUPT, Homestead, Pa.

Homestead High School.
Scrub Wrestling.

Yes, we all liked Hauppy until he established diplomatic
relations with the Triumz/ate and since that time he has
been rather at outs with the bunch. But we feel he wants
to repent and get in the straight and narrow. The latch
string is always out and a welcome assured.

CHESTER OTTO HENRY, Pittsburgh, Pa.

Carnegie Tech.

Henry looks like a worker, acts like a worker, in fact, is
a worker. To hear him talk you would think that he did
not have ambition to turn the other cheek but look out
boys and don’t hit him on the nose, if he ever gets mad he
will fight as hard as he works and he makes work look
sick in no time.

JOSEPH CLEM HOOPER, Waynesburg, Pa.

Waynesburg High School.
Waynesburg College.

One of the elite who have reservations at the Gayety
and at Forbes Field. He has, to /rut it mildly. an affinity
for the fair sea’. We fear that he is ﬁckle. but hope that if
his girl, (oh, yes. he has a steady). sees this she will not
throw him over as she had ought to do.

PLINIO IGNELZI, Naples, Italy.

Italian Club.
D. Pedro 11., College, Brazil.

If all the Latin-blooded people were like Ignat: we would
not be having war with Mexico. It tool: him a year to get
onto our ways but now he’s one of us. If you don’t /know
and like Ignat: you’re not one of the bunch and that is
going some.

WALTER EMANUEL LARSON, Waupaca, Wis.

Waupa'ca High School.

ll"alter has become famous around Pitt for the amount
of work that he can do, but no wonder, being the secretary
of that roughuecla trio—Hassel, Larson and Lewis. Doomed
to be a great inventor for he is now perfecrting a new
machine, a heart crusher. l/Ve don't blame you for rating
over him, girls.

EARL LeROY LEWIS, West Elizabeth, Pa.

Curry College.
Class Baseball.

Lewis hails from some unknown Tillage just around the
earner from nowhere but never the less he gets here, when
he (lI‘l‘i‘Z'(’S he is bubbling ozrer with spirit and goodfellu~w-
ship. Earl is a dear little fellow and not a bit like his
roug/znerle namesalre, Bob Lewis.

ROBERT ASI-‘I LEWIS, Birmingham, Ala.

Birmingham High School.
Editor-in-chief 1915 Owl.

It is mighty hard to pay a fellow back in a few lines all
that he (l(’SE)"Z’I’.S‘ for these‘ outrages roinmitted. Howeizrr
we will let him oﬂ‘ light by saying that he is the worst
roughnecle of the roug/inerhs, the henrhmau of the profs
while posing as the students’ friend, and we would tell the
rest but he wouldn't />rz‘nt it.

130

J ECHIHEL LICHTIN, Philadelphia, Pa.

Brown Preparatory School.
Menvorah.
Cosmopolitan Club.

Lichtin, the Russian Socialist. is some orator. He is
also some chemist and in spite of Brenner’s eﬁorts, he is
still unconvinced that he flunked in chemistry. A quiet
sort of a chap and a hard worker, therefore doomed to make
a success of life. We all like Lichtin.

OCTAVE BENJAMIN OPSION, Pittsburgh, Pa.

Pittsburgh High -School.
Student Manager of Track.

Write his initials, O0, and you have nothing. He might
have been named Lionel or Lucifer and then they would
spell the poor Indian LO. Or had his name been Charles

or Cedric, they would have been CO and therefore dan—‘

gerous. But as they spell O0, nothing, we will say
nothing.

R. T. MCDONALD, Duquesne, Pa.

Duquesne High School.

Why of course Me has the spirit and would like to niix
in more but he is just naturally too shy or takes life too
seriously. Some say that there is a girl in the case but
we won’t insinuate without more proof. We therefore will
introduce him as Von Ritter’s Star.

PAUL MEEHAN, New Castle, Pa.

New Castle High School.

Paul, being one of the most mature members of our
class, didn’t get into the spirit of things right off the bat,
but drew in his horns and founded the Triumvate. How-
ever. he is getting to be one of the bunch more and more
every day and will be one of them before we terminate.

JAMES RUSSELL MULLIGAN, Hays, Pa.

Pittsburgh Academy.
Cap and Gown.

Now we used to consider that Mulligan was the tipical
college rah-rah, but we have changed our minds. He is
just getting down to business and then some of you sharks
will have to look to your honors. If it were not for dances,
theaters, teas, parties, etc., he would be a good student.

WALTER RODNEY PARVIN, Wilkinsburg, Pa.

Wilkinsburg High School.

Ladies and Gentlemen, we take great pleasure in intro-
ducing to you our» little wonder, the biggest hearted little
fellow in the school. A wonder at everything but his
studies, spends most of his time wondering how he will
pass them. The P. R. R. couldn’t get along without him.

ENOCH COLBY PRATT, Pittsburgh, Pa.

Pittsburgh High School.
’Varsity Football, '12.
Engineering Manager 1915 Owl.

The old Keet is a good scout with a heart as big as his
body is long. When the L/10R wanted a good healthy
Sergeant—at—/Irms, they /wicked this bull: of humanity and
peace has reigned thereafter. Colby thinks that he has a
voice but—Ach Gottt Pull it!

HUGH MacGRUDER ROBERTSON, Rockville, Md.

Montgomery County High School.
Student Senate.

The first of the Triumvate to get mixed up in politics,
but when he mixed, he mixed. In fact, he kicked Bob
Lewis clear out of the Senate and left the AOR gasping
for breath. “Red” just naturally can't see how it hap-
pened. The AOR’s loss is the classes gain.

132

JULIUS CHRISTIAN SCHMIDT, Pittsburgh, Pa.

Allegheny High School.
Carnegie Technical Schools.

His main fault is his independence. His lack of tact is
very often a trouble maker. Everyone whom he likes likes
him; but those that he don’t like are let down so hard at
times that he has a choice selection of enemies. An
organizer and main supporter of the AOR.

CYRIL CYPRIAN SCHWERHA, Glassport, Pa.

Pittsburgh Academy.

We hold out grave fears for his future peace of mind
and state of happiness if Dick Best perseveres inhis de-
termination to graduate this year. Wherever you see one,
the other is in the vicinity or will be soon. He never uses
the kind of language his name would indicate.

WILLIAM ALVAN SMITH, Coreiopolis, Pa.

Coralopolis High School.

Old Ponce de Leon traveled far to ﬁnd the fountain of
youth, but Coraopolis Bill beat him to it. Bill is just the
same now as_ when a freshie, good hearted and willing, but
just can’t put it over. PVe thank you for our start any
way, Bill. Yes, he’s improving.

WILLIAM H. SMITH, Waynesburg, Pa.

Waynesburg High School.
Carnegie Technical Schools.

Waynesburg Bill has gotten in with the bunch, but not
through hard work, rather the lack of it. Look at those
eyes -in the picture, did you ever see anything so devilish?
Gather around me little ones. It is a long sad story.

Th'at’s Bill 's nature.

HOWARD A. THOMPSON, AA, Pittsburgh, Pa.

Pittsburgh High School.
Cap and Gown (2).

The big boy with the big heart. If there is a fellow in
the class who doesn't like Howard, it isn’t Howard’s fault.
He’ll (the apostrophy’s there) end up by being a popular
man yet if he keeps up that smile. Too bad he hangs
around with that ronghneck, Totten.

HARRY HORACE TINCH, Tahlequah, Okla.
Oklahoma N. E. State Normal.

Mother! Mother! Look who’: here.’ The wild man
from Oklahoma. Harry started under a handicap, we
didn't understand him, but he has now been admitted to
full membership in the bunch. Now just to look at him
you wouldn’t take him for a fusser, honest? He is.

ROBERT MASON TOTTEN, AA, Pittsburgh, Pa.
Allegheny High School.

Yes, “Totter” went to Chicago with “Red,” but it didn’t
seem to have the same effect on him. Of course he had
experiences, but they were tame. On the other hand, he
might have been right there with bells, but scorns to make
so public all the particulars.

WILLIAM FOSTER TRIMBLE, AA, Bellevue, Pa.

Bellevue High School.

“Spike” just naturally didn’t get started until this year,
but now he is making the profs sit up and take notice. He
has n'e'z1er mixed with the bunch very much, but at his
present rate of speed he may yet be admitted to fellowship.
Another debit on the books of the P. R‘. R.

134

DAVID MARION WINEMAN, JR., Derry, Pa.

Derry High School.

Shorty is a typical specimen of that old saying, "Nobody
loves a fat man,” but we don’t see why for he is a dear
little fellow. He has never been seen with a girl in Pitts-
burgh, but if he is anything like his old side partner, Victor
Smith, he surely has a nice little girl waiting for him back
home.

RALPH CARLTON ZINDEL, AA, Eric, Pa.

Edinboro Normal School.

They just naturally can’t keep a good man down. Has
had more hard luck than all the rest of the class put to-
gether, but comes back with the punch. We thought that
he would be a roughneclz in his freshman year but he just
couldn’t make it. Maybe he is better oﬁ‘.

YUNG TSO TONG, Canton, China.

Technical High, Springﬁeld, Mass.
University of Illinois.

We just couldn’t let Dean Mellor have all the bright
students, so we got Tong to join our goodly numbers. In
the short time that he has been with us, he has tried to
qualify as a member of the bunch and with a little more
coaching in slang, he will have all the qualiﬁcations.

CORNELIUS PRUGH HARNISH, AA, Butler, Pa.

Morcersburg Academy.

You see we can’t really give Harnish a good knock for
he has so few weak spots in sight. The only thing to his
discredit is that he runs around with a lot of those rough
necks in the class and therefore the co-eds have not invited
him to any more of their dances.

135

ALBERT ELLIS FROS1‘, A.M., Sc.D.,

GEORGE MILTON KRATZERT, Woodlawn, Pa.

Beaver High School.

We don't want to say anything to hurt anyb0dy’s feel-
ings. It has been our policy throughout these writen/vs to
slander nobody and allow everybody to talee an Owl home
this year. Therefore, we will say nothing about Kratzert.

WILLIAM EMERY GRAY, EX, Elyria, Ohio.

GUY M. WILLIAMSON, <l>ZtI), Indianapolis, Ind.

New Mexico Military Academy.
Purdue University.
’Varsity Football, Baseball and Track.

Owing to the shortness of his [muting and the general
1’0lt(’1M1c’SS of his playing, Old Pitt won the Cornell and
State game: last fall.. ll/e sure hope that Challey will im-
/vrove by ne.1't fall or we are afraid that he will be unable

HUGH WALLACE BELL, Midway, Pa.

Vvashington and Jefferson College.
Penn State. B. S.
Student Senate.

Class Obstetrician. Started out in life with the idea of
becoming a Sanitary Engineer, but decided that an M. D.’s
s/iin_¢'l(* was more in arcordaizre with his requirements. Is
rather taciturn by nature, but e1z_io_\vs a good joke as well
as the rest of us, and IZUTTI‘ sidoste/vs any rough house.

RALPH HENDERSON BOTTS, NEN,
New Brighton, Pa.

New Brighton High School.
Geneva College. .'

Class"'Athlete. -A New Brighton product who followed
in the footsteps of Joe Thompson. Hube Wagner et als.,
to Pitt. “Right at her, Geneva,” is his slogan. Ralph is
an authority on. the treatment of neurasthcnics: “Put ’crn

. to,bcd and give them a paper to read.”

~z

MARION SIARR5 BOWERS,‘N2i\I, Wilkinsburg, Pa.
I’ittshu1'gh High School.

As Class Pugilist, Marian has made the term “foot of
the steps” a s_wz0n_vrn for trouble. “Tem[>era1nentaZ ‘iIly”'
is a man of rliangeable moods. At times he is theatrically
sentimental, at others haughty and ’ItI1(1['T_[7l‘(l(1C/1(lble, but he
bluffs nobody. His handsome countenance and faultless
attire nialrv him our Beau Brmimwl.

ORLANDO F OUSE, ATA, <I>P2, Pittsburgh, Pa.

Pittsburgh High School.
Washington and Jefferson College.
Class Secretary.

Class Methuselavh. Father Orlando is one of the ex-
ponents of conjugal bliss. He has very little to do except
run a bowling alley, go to Medical School, and sell auto-
mobiles. In spite of his many occn/rations-—or is it because
of them?——he holds the record as long distance sleeper of
the class. Her/vicide, that’s it.

JULIUS HENRY GOLDSTEIN, <l>AE, Pittsburgh, Pa.

Pittsburgh High School.
Washington and Jefferson Collcge.
Class Secretary. ‘

Class Infant. The sole sui"oizring re/vresentative of his
race in the class, and withal its youngest member. “Goldie”
has a hobby for syste-rnatisinq his notes, but, unfortunately,
generally loses his notebook about the time the system
begins to take deﬁnite form. A friend of Royan and a
conﬁdent of Bowers.

CHARLES SEATON HENDRICKS, rbK~Ir, rI>P2,
Bolivar, Pa.

Bolivar Academy.
Allegheny College.
Junior Prom Committee.

Chief Class Blutter. He has convinced some of the
/vrofs that he is /vroﬁcient in this -res/'7ect at least. Much
of his time is spent in making trips to './‘arentuzn to see his
“,Jrand1notlzer.” but is always on the job when the reports
are sent home to mnimna.

HAROLD HENRYLAMB, <I>TA, <I>BK, <I>P2,
Wilkinsburg, Pa.

Braddock High School.
Allegheny College, B. S.
Medical Owl Editor.

Class Little Standard Bearer. Harold has dabbled in
many activities since coming to Pitt, being an accomplished
politician, student and fusser. Reported to he fledged to
the Pi Theta Nu. He disagreed -with her one day, but
has not done so since. Always sits in the front row during
quizzes and is right there 'zc'hen called on.

COLIN M’FARQUHAR REED, ATA, <l>.P2‘.,
Washington, Pa.

Vvashington and Jefferson College. A. B.
Class President.

Class Ministerial. Is one of our most earnest little
workers, and helps keep the Standard Oil Company in
existence. Has the best line of coon songs and minstrel
jokes in the school, but when occasion demands, can lay
aside all frivolitics and assume the air of a Sir Oracle.

DE WAYNE GREENWOOD RICHE , NZN,
McKeesport, Pa.

Mr.-Keesport High School.
Allegheny College.

Class Fusser. Is always “there” with a bright saying or
a good story and contributes much to the gayety of the
class except during the week before e.i‘aminations. At such
times we suspect that he is getting acquainted with his
books, although he denounces the slander.

WILLIAM COOPER STOAKES.

Vvashington and Jefferson College.

Class Absentee. If there is a prize to be won, leave it
to Bill to bring home the bacon. A square-jawed, easy-
going fellow, with a big proclivity towards "sleeping in”
in the mornings. He has all the big 7l.'r7rrl.v nf medicine at
his ﬁizger's end, but someway is not able to connect.

ORVILLE JACKSON WALKER, «1-P2, Apollo, Pa.

Apollo High School.
Westmlnlster College.
Medical Manager of the Owl.

Originator of the “Penrose Gang.” Orville has earned
the title of class bicker, since he is never afraid to tell the
faculty when things don’t go right. Now a member of the
faculty scrub team, i. e.: he scrubs the apparatus in the
Department of Physiology. A fusser, having been in love
with one girl since before his freshman year.

156

EARL PHILLIPS WICKERSHAM, «I>P2,
Monongahela, Pa.

Monongahela High School.
Grove City College.
Class Vice President.

Class Grind. An earnest young man whose chief ambi-
tion in life is to sound the praises of “Manon City.” l/Vick
is there when an argument is started, no matter 'I('lit‘ll1(’l'
he knows anything about the subject under discussion, or
not; in fact, no other than (1 Prof can make him back down.

CHARLES HORMEL WOLF, fI>K\Ir, NEN,
Washington, Pa.

VVashington High School.
Washington and Jefferson College, A. B.

Class Humorist. Here is another Wa.sh.-Jeﬂ‘. whose
ha]:/7y-go-lucky manner and genial cordiality have made
him friends here -in the enemies’ country. When “Sleeets”
says, “Have you heard this one, fellows?" we all _4'at/(er
around. Deservcdly the most _ho/vular num in the class.

LEOPOLD VACCARO, Pittsburgh, Pa.

VVesleyan Academy.
Clark University, A. B.
Bible Teacher's Training School, N. Y.

Class Evangelist. Vaccaro means cowboy, wherefore this
member has been styled M.A. (not Master of Arts). The
moral censor of our benighted class. Like Fouse, “Vac” is
married and raising a family of little cowboys. Does the
“Billy Smm'ay" stunt at the Italian Mission.

?Jln> (‘llama nf 1915

COLLE(.}l<} career should prepare us for the battles of life. To
prepare for the battle we must learn. the arts of war by the
practice thereof.

A student is one who studies—-and learns; a person who
procures the stored—11p learning of the ages through the me-
dium of books, who adds thereto the fruits of original research in labora-
tory or practice in the ﬁeld, who learns through intercourse with the rest
of mankind. ’

There are two outward signs of a student’s success——his reports and
his participation in student activities. The past successes of a class in
the Junior year may be ascertained more comprehensively by the latter.

The Class of 1915 is proud of those of its members who have fought
for the University on the gridiron, diamond, ﬁeld, ﬂoor and court. They
are highly endowed with muscle and brain. They have attained success
as athletes and gentlemen. They deserve the title of Pitt Men.

Many of the members of the class are interested in the club and
social life of the University. They are brainy, enthusiastic and therefore
successful. 1

The class, as a whole, ﬁrst emerged from complete oblivion on the
occasion of the greatest Cap Night that Pitt ever saw, the opening gu11
of the One Hundred Twenty-fifth Anniversary. Class spirit has been
promoted. by means of banquets and smokers.

The Junior Prom was a. distinct social success.

The Owl——will hoot for itself.

The class has witnessed and helped its little share in the upbuilding
of the University since the fall of 1911. Old Uni’s interests have been
their interests. They have at times become impatient, but they cannot be
classed as knockers. Their impatience proving their zeal.

And so, pausing at the end of the J11nior year, the members of the
class look back with a sense of pride and devotion. Having done well,
they aspire to grow in wisdom and zeal that they may become worthy to
bear the distinction of being Sons and Daughters of Pitt.

JUNIORS

JEROME C. ALBERT, Latrobe, Pa.

St. Vincent College.
“I’Il get there some day, some how.”

Jerome is always the ﬁrst of our num..’)er to get to school
in the morning and the last to lea-re. He opens the restau-
rant by taking the first cup of coffee. Short and heavy,
but very quiet, talking only when the subject is woman and
time is money.

SAMUEL BASCOMBE ALLOWAY, Erie, Pa.

Erie High School.
“Brevity is the soul of wit.”

“Sam” was washed ashore at Erie. After preliminary
occupations and much aforethought, he decided there was
no other calling for him but to become a Ph.G. One of
our star athletes. having made guard on the class basket
ball team.

ROY WALKER BALDWIN, Latrobe, Pa.

Meyersdale High Séhool.
“Arrogance is the obstruction of wisdom.”

About twenty years ago a baby boy brought great joy
to Latrobe, and ever since that day Latrobe has been a
metro/rolis. A village cutup, as denzonstrated in lab. wwhen
throwing tallow and blowing bubbles. l/Vill return home,
better or worse, according to the resistance.

HARVEY ROSSEL BENNETT, Latrobe, Pa.

Latrobe High School.
“What a cruel world this is."

Harvey came to us from Latrobe, but he does not talk
about it as some others. His chief trouble in life is to get
to the nine o’cloek class on time. He intends to use this
illustrious talent in Pharmacognosey some day and make
things around Latrobe much better.

191

. ELMER BIERWIRTH, Bellevue, Pa.

Pittsburgh Academy.
What is Bierwirth in Bellevue, Ask "Beck."

Comes from that beautiful village of beautiful streets
and home of beautiful girls. Elmer shines in Pharma-
ceutical coagitations just like a diamond shines in mud. If
his good work is continued throughout, he will, no doubt,
return to Bellevue Wirth more than Bier to that coni-
munity.

WILLIAM EDIE BISIL, K\I/, Connellsville, Pa.

Connellsvile High Schooi.
Chairman of the Class.

”lVine, women and song doth sometimes life [Jrolong.”

Bisil is another of our “Bills,” not monthly but yearly.
To receive payment, he will come fore-ver. His ambition
is to become a real druggist, and marry a widow (a real
widow). Bill was a/I/minted chairman of the class, but as
everything was on him, he decided negatively. He is a
great instigator of class cuts, es/vecially at psycliological
moments.

I. J. BROSKY, Pittsburgh, Pa.

Pittsburgh High School.
.“Old age brings companions with it.”

Has been attending school ezver since he was a mere child
and according to the record of his attendance this year he
may be with us for quite a while. This young man was
given quite a lecture one day about wine, women, song
and the downfall of man, so Bros.-’.’y has given up singing
forever.

IRA LEE BRYAN, <I>AX, Clearﬁeld, Pa.

Clearﬁeld High School.
"As noisy as a thousand men.”

Can be heard in the snzolcing room at any time between
classes. Has a bad habit of [rushing his friends around
when he onglit to give them a pull. Ira is a star in
chemistry and can tell more about unlenowns than has yet
been discovered by any human being. But for all that
he is a good bluﬁ"er. '

192

HOMER HARVEY BURNS, Claysville, Pa.
Claysville High School.

“And fire burns also.”

Homer hails from that disease located between Wheeling

and W heeling’s back yard, namely Claysoille, and is about‘

as good as could be expected under those circumstances.
Homer and Brownlee started together but Burns is too
fast. Homer can be identified by his rube wall: and his
dragging voice; there are also hopes.

DAVID BUSIS, Pittsburgh, Pa.
Fifth Avenue High School.

“He came from across the pond.”

Is one of our real druggists who learned the game under
the Czar where they serve no ice cream in a drug store.
Busis has been made the goat of the :lass and every time
he opens his month he puts his foot in it. Everybody picks
on “Abie” and puts signs on his back. He is inquisitiz/e
enough to get there.

PAUL SHELDON BYRNE, Butler, Pa.
Butlei‘ High School.

“Nothing so bad as not to be good for something.”

. Byrne was found out in a laboratory lecture in which
he stated that no part of the body can be modiﬁed unless
(mother part suffers. For instance: A person with a big
body might have a little brain or vice oersa. Paul is a
large boy for his age, and well liked.

LESLIE RICHARD DAVIS, Ebensburg, Pa.

Ebensburg High School.
Student Band.
Class Secretary.

“You look wise, please correct that error.”

V Ranks first among our great men. A member of the
band, looks like (1 Victor Herbert, especially when he is
dolled up in that new band coat. On any Saturday after-
noon he may be seen awaiting a fair one at the Jenkins
Arcade. Can make more noise than Mcnermott.

193

ELMER BERNARD DEISS, Pittsburgh, Pa.
Fifth Avenue High School.

“The beautiful are never desolate, for some one always
loves them.”

Has a full portion of that admirable quality known as
“class spirit.” He, like Ward, has a great foresight for
high ﬁnance, but, of course, that comes naturally, working
for years on Fifth Avenue. Has a “steady,” although all

‘the fair ones between town and Oakland know Elmer, the

nice looking young man in Saalbach’s.

-

LEE ALFRED DONALDSON, Pittsburgh,'Pa.

Pittsburgh High School.
“At last all things some to be known.”

A product of the Smoky City which accounts for his
overwhelming amount of knowledge. Although young,
with inst a little erperience in the “pill shop,” Lee took
the Q. A. examination and passed with honors. As he
grows older and fills out he will become an attraction for
the fair sex. '

 

JAMES RAYMOND DUDLEY, KNII, Wilkinsburg, Pa.“

Washington and Jefferson Academy.
Vvashington and Jefferson College.
Pharmacy Owl Editor.

"People who live in glass houses should never throw
stones.”

In behalf of the Juniors we take pleasure in breaking a
little glass. The class as a whole refrains from expressing
their full sentiments after considering the fact that he is
of a decidedlv weak nature, physirally, mentally, etc. Not-
withstanding his failings, numerous as they are, we give
Jimmy full credit for his endeavors as class detective,
humorist, moral censorer, general nuisance.

CARL JACOB DRUMEYER, <I>AX, Johnstown, Pa.

Jnhnstnwn High school.

“It is less painful to learn in youth than to be ignorant
in age.”

Very handsome, having beautiful silver locks and large
blue eyes, which he keeps hidden with dignity. Carl is all
right, but at times is very noisy and can be heard from
the basement up. He is a shark in his lessons, so they say.

194

 

EBEN SHAFFER CALDWELL, Elizabeth, Pa.

Elizabeth High School.
“Touch not my pretty golden locks.”

One of our small, light, cu~rly—headed kind, with rosy
cheeks and smiling countenance, and a regular cutu/7. A
member of the lonesome three; where you see one, you
see the others.' We don’t know what Eben's profession
will be, but we hope that he will qualify for it.

EARL CAVANAUGH, Pittsburgh, Pa.

St. Mary’s High School.
"‘Here’s honesty, manhood and good fellowship for all.”

Earl is one of our specials and comes to school when
he feels like it, other times following the line of least
resistance. He hopes to go out for football, but we are
afraid that he cannot do it and keep up with his other
work, namely, taleing care of his bed.

ROBERT ANDREW CARROL, K\II, West Finley, Pa.

Rich Hill High School.
Chemistry Assistant.

"Fear not, ankle spats will protect you ever.”

Hails from Greene County. A chemistry shark, being
made assistant to Dr. Judd in the laboratory so he could
be watched closely. Some one might entice him away.
Went out for woman’s suffrage at one time, but failed to
qualify.

LINN LIONEL CARSON, <I>AX, Washington, Pa.

Washington High School.
“All that is fair must fade.”

"Punk” hails from that city of the gods, that Athens of
learning located some [vlace on a branch of the P. R. R.
He has the rosy cheeks and dimpled chin of a sweet country
maid, and a smile just as charming. Linn is very young
and unsophisticated: so bashful that his face would flag a
train at the sight of a girl.

IVAN L. CARTER, K\II, Altoona, Pa.

Altoona High School.
Conway Hall.

“Fashioned so slenderly, young and so fair.”

His eye glasses and digniﬁed bearing give him the appear-
ance of a student, and as a matter of fact he is no slouch
when it comes to study, even though he once claimed to
be able to show that the thermometer was wrong. Ivan’s
beautiful hair nialces him a rival to McGrew, and is his
chief attraction. '

J. MONT. GEORGE, ‘Pittsburgh, Pa.

Pittsburgh High School.
“You can not have the cake and eat it too.”

One of those who have done and seen everything and yet
have never been away from home. Always an anxious
looleer when passing the “Mercy,” for he claims he has a
girl.

EDMUND E. COLE,.Martins Ferry, 0.

Martins Ferry High School.
“One of the old Confederates, but wears a Union suit.”

Edmund is a prince, so we were informed by the father
of our class. He is tall and light haired. l/Vith a grandeur
about him that would make some lonesome heiress go wild.
lid will get there with the aid and succor of all the Juniors.

WESLEY COSSER, Wheeling, W. Va.

McMechan High School.
“From down the river.”

When he first blew in from the Nail City, we were really
surprised at the way he smeared things, but since he has
taken more interest, he realizes that it is worthy to be wise.
Wesley is of the beautiful blondes, wears a Norfolle suit
and imparts to everyone all he knows.

196

JOHN HUGH ENGLEBACH, Johnstown, Pa. _

Johnstown High School.

“If you can’t see the bottom wade not.”

John Hugh is a little too deep for our analysis, but he
is really making good. So far, however, we have not been
taken by surprise. You cannot tell what /ohnstown will
produce in the German as per Englebach, Coalbach, etc.
A standard well worth living up to.

LOUIS FEINBERG, Altoona, Pa.

Altoona High School.
“Why did you make me love you?”

Louis is our “well informed” and can certainly tell a
funny story. It comes naturally for him, hailing from
Altoona, where everything is a joke. Louis and Davie
lrazze quite a time talking Irish in laboratory. Louis works
in Oakland and is fast learning to play pool.

' HARRY FEINSTEIN, Pittsburgh, Pa.

Pittsburgh High School.
"A man’s a man for a’ that.”

“I am Jack’s pal and Jack and I are going to try to
settle down by next July.” Like the rest of the boys from
Central High he knows how to behave. Other fellows
please take notice of our model. Possesses a grcat amount
of respect for the fair sex which may be his downfall.

DON EUGENE GILLUNG, K~II, DuBois, Pa.

Du Bois High School.
Student Band.

“If the beard were all the goat would be the winner,"

One of the studious looking gentlemen that wear mus-
taches and grow glasses. .4 member of the band and one
of the "Band Parade” which took place after the Thanks-
giving banquet at the Schenley. May be seen in chemistry
lab, where his hands are stained with many acids.

197

ALBERT REED GUTHRIE, Clarion, Pa.

Clarion Normal School.
“Solitude is sometimes best society.”

Why Albert was sent to Pitt is more than we know, but
owing to his good friends, we took him in. Albert is very
quiet and conservative; his fellow students must be very
careful they dont hurt his feelings. His glasses and chain
show his studious disposition.

JOHN W. JAMES, KW, Altoona, Pa.

Altoona High School.
“A bird is known by his note and a man by his talk.”

One of our midgets and a member of the Altoona crew.
Also one of the neucleoli of our class and does not want to
smear the professors, just naturally can’t help it. We must
not forget to mention his pompadour hair which in itself
is enough to add fame to any man, even a real one.

STANLEY WILBERT JEFFERSON, Pittsburgh, Pa.
Pittsburgh High School.
"Rolling stones gather no mass.”

Might have been called Thomas but for the thought of
cunclescension. Stanley, like Thomas, is one of oui country’s
great men. Some of his associates claim that he is Booker
T in einlvrvo and will some day start a Pharmacy school
down in Dixie.

HARRY JOHANNES, East Liverpool, 0.
East Liverpool Academy.

“Over the stars there is rest."

Harry does not come from South Africa, as his name
would seem to indicate, but from a town on the border.
Gave us all a surprise when we found out that he was able
to talk as well as he looks, and you all /snow that he is
good looking.

MILTON A. KAUT, Pittsburgh, Pa.

Pittsburgh Academy.
“Some People are never Kant.”

One of the happiest members of our class, in fact you
cannot make him mad, no matter what you say to him. He

hopes to become Pittsburglfs greatest Pharmacist. -We

hope he does this little thing, but some of his friends say
that they have their doubts.

DAVID LEFKOWITZ, Pittsburgh, Pa.

Allegheny High School.

“Better to have loved and lost than never to have loved
at all.”

That good looking little chap from across the river may
be seen any time hanging around the College restaurant.
He is the most hungry member of our class. HrI‘:'lI1g
attended the Allegheny High and the Gayety, he may malce
good. Who knows?

WALTER MANNS, McKeesport, Pa.

McKeesport High School.
"As gentle as a lamb.”

One of our children and all must be careful, for he is

very unsophisticated and quiet: some stray germ might’

ter_minate therein and cause a great disaster. /Iltlioiiglz
small, has a man’s lznowledge, 7UlM(‘l1 he exercises every
day between town and MeKeesport.

199

ARTHUR JOSEPH MASTERSON, Pittsburgh, Pa.

Altoona. High School.
Class President.

“He that wants should not be bashful.”

Only our class president, although his main and good
looks are enough to get him the /rresidential chair of the
whole United States. Our theater critic and very seldom
misses the Victoria, even if he has to cut class to go.
Masterson is also a connoisseur wlien it comes to the latest
steps in the latest dances.

PAUL CARLTON MCCONNELL, K\II, Prospect, Pa.

Prospect High School.
“The good die young and I feel so sick."

Paul has a record for trying to make good, at least, and
some day hopes for Darby's [vosition. His blond hair and
blue eyes lead him into many wonderful and odd circum-
stances. but some of these days he will make a miseue and
then his friends will have something to go to.

THEODORE WATTS McDERMOTT, Kxlz,
Pittsburgh, Pa.

Duquesne Uni\'crslt.V.
“How noisy some noises are.”

No sooner landed here than he hegan chewing the rag
at such rapid fire pace that we became alarmed. A closer
eramination disclosed his ailment to be lint on the lungs
or girls on the brain. “Mac” has a very good habit of
slee/ving during classes and is therefor very popular with
the faculty.

W. EARL MCGREW, I\'\lI, Finleyville, Pa.

Pittsburgh A(:adem,v.
Randolph Macon Aceulexny.

“Neat, sweet, handsome and fair.”

Undoubtedly the szeeetest and softest looking man in
the class. Must have taken domestic science at Randolph
Macon for a better sweeper is yet to be found. in manner
he is quiet: in s/veech. taciturn. and in distmsition, ha/!tv_\'.
By not talking over much he has gained a reputation for
much knowledge.

GLENDON EMERY McNARY, <I>AX, Washington, Pa.
East Vvashington High School.
“From Little Washington. l\'uf ced.”

Coming from that sanctified section, lze knows no harm
and no worm. He started with “Punk" <9" “Fat," but:
“Fat” could not stand the pace.

CHARLES MENDZO MENDERSON,
Weston, W. Va.

Weston High School.
"VVhere ignorance is bliss, ’tis folly to be wise.”

The bright light that darkened the lab. the day of the
class cut. Having gone to school in Philadelphia, when
someone makes a mistake his melodious laugh may be
heard in criticism and for that he is said to have some
/vull with the faculty.

JOHN LLOYD MOONLY, <I>AX, Greensburg, Pa.

Greensburg High School.

“A pretty face and lovely hair.”

One of the most /vo/mlar boys in the school. If he liked'

work as well as he lilacs girls John would be as/iiring to
some ﬁmmezal throne instead of “Po1sons."

CURTIS BLAINE MURTLAND, rI>AX, Dawson, Pa.

Dunbar High School.
"A born worker.”

Curtis is one of our most studious men, well liked and a
eentlemrm in all resfrects. He has a bright future before
him and we er/vcct him to be one of the leaders of his
line. He 7('orl’s quietly and eornestlv at all that he under-
talees. wlzieh is not much. but we l1(IT'(’ ho/res.

201

FRANK RALPH NOVISH, Pittsburgh, Pa.

Pittsburgh High School.
“Oh, how these exams do frighten.”

Frank would hate been considered a ﬁne looking man
years ago. His glasses are the most important looking
peculiarity about him. Also has a curiosity beyond the
nearest eonipetitor. What he does not know, he will very
soon. inquire about.

GRAFTON FRANK PORCH, K\Ir, Johnstown, Pa. 4'

Johnstown High School.
Pharmacy Owl Manager.

Hails from fohnstown, but by mistake, for he is as.

illustrious a singer as ever hailed from the Swiss Alps.
He has a reputation of being the only member of our class
to sing a solo at the Sehenley Hotel by special request. I-Iis
steadiness and faithful work has helped materially in
making this book what it is.

GUY QOUETER, <I>AX Pittsburgh, Pa.
“A regular guy.”

One of those precious assistants in “Mike lab.”, willing
to tell you all he knows, but that don’t take long. When
it comes to slowing away the sandwitehes at the “ban-
quets,” well girls its a shame to tell it on him, but he is a
regular schnorer.

CLYDE THADDUS REED, K\II, Butler, Pa.

Butler High School.
“Lead on Mac Duﬂ‘.”

Clyde Thaddus sounds like a Grecian god and he is as
near to the aforesaid as possible. Always wearing a smile
that won’t tome otl. Clyrle's real aim is to become a real
druaaist and own a store in a little town with a small wife.
We hope that his dream will come true to the fullest extent.

202

MALCOME EARL_REED, <I>AX, DuBois,‘Pa.

Du Bois High School.
“Moses was found among the Reeds.”

Malcome is another of our goats except that his goatee
was somehow or other misplaced on his upper lip. He is
very small, but, contrary to size, he can make an awful
noise. When he starts to talk, all others please keep quiet.
Attracts more attention by his mistakes than by his hand-
someness.

LEO RITZI, Youngstown, O.
Youngstown High School.
“Always talking, saying little.”

One of the noisy crowd, but, considering the source, what
else could be expected? When he and Spohn get together
in quiz, you may vouch for the fact that very little is
learned. Wears a fake mustache and soft hat. If he were
not so well known around school he mi,;=ht be mistaken for
a real duke.

ARTHUR HUGO ROBERTS, K~Ir, Pittsburgh, Pa.

Pittsburgh High School.
“Is so dianietric in shape.”

Our infant in size only. A good natured child and takes
thinszs as they come and go. ll/hen he gets all dolled up

in his long white lab. coat_. he looks almost as big as John -

Di.i‘on. He aspires to the “mot'ies" and hopes to some day
sub for John Bunny. li/zll carry honors in his class if
he ever gets started.

JAMES THOMAS MANNING ROEBUCK, Kxlz,
Harrisburg, Pa.

‘Vest Fairview High School.

“The mustache was never the true standard of brains."

Roebuck certainly landed in our class lvy mistake, he
was meant for the Carnegie Museum. This is the first
Roebuck that we ever saw that could raise a mustache, but
he is some deer at that. James newer misses /1 dance and
has all the new steps down so good that the girls call him
“professor."

203

ALBERT JOSEPH RENNER, Monaca, Pa.

Monaca High School.

“A calm is welcome after a storm.”

This youth with the innocent face has the appearance of
a high school boy rather than a college man. He is one of
our noisest, in fact he is so noisy that he has the professors
"up in the air” all the time. Is going to be a great “pill
roller" some day.

H. M. SHELDON, Kit, Hughesville, Pa.

Hughesvllle High School.
Student Band.
Athletic Committee.

“I am not naturally laz ; it is the weather.”

One of the most popular men in the class. He is one of
the many wits, although his jokes often lack a point. Our
class musician, and the pride of the “pill rollers.” Has an
idea that he can get along better with a little study and
much bluﬂ‘, but the prescription does not seem to give relief.

HARRY ELWOOD SIMPSON, JR.,
Wheeling, W. Va.

Wheeling High School.
“Rather be dean than president."

His highest ambition is to be a Pharmacist and wear a
white coat. Being rather quiet and bashful, he is generally
seen in some corner studying. We have been unable to
heel? a close watch over him, but, realizsing that he has been
and will be well cared for, we all wish him a cup full of
joy and lucle.

ROY GRAY SMITH, West Sunhury, Pa.

\Vest Sunbury Academy.
“I know what study is.”

Roy first toyed with the educational rattle in Sunbury
sicademy, but. not satisﬁed with the quality of the rattle,
he came to Pittsburgli to cut his eye teeth. He has a
i()'Ui(1l disposition, and generally /snows his lessons, wlzieh
goes a long ways for a Smith. Brown or Jones.

204

EUGENE RAYMOND SMITH, K\II, Altoona, Pa.

Andover High School.
“Better poor, young and wise, than old, rich- and a fool.”

Born January th, 1753, and fought in the Revolutionary
War. Smithy has a large amount of class and college
spirit and the aid he gave us towards this Owl has helped
us materially. Shines especially bright in botany; he can
distinguish from stone and cork immediately.

KATHERINE SNYDER, Pittsburgh, Pa.

Pittsburgh High School.
“Arms, women and books should be looked at daily.”

An excellent representative of our fair sex. She desires
to be a business woman and a militant suﬁragette, so she
became one of us to gain knowledge of the weaker sea’.
A true “Class Man" and, when an aﬂ‘air of social impor-
tance arises, does her best to make it a success. Is also a
great help to Section A by causing the boys to watch their
P’s and Q’s, thus raising the morals of our class.

WALTER R. SPOHN, K\Ir, Pittsburgh, Pa.

Pittsburgh Academy.
Carnegie Technical Schools.

"By ignorance is pride increased.”

One of our favorite pianoists and when he starts synco-
pating those melodious notes we are overpowered with
the rolling sounds of universal regret. Sing? Well, he
would make Bisil, the great singer, look like Caruso. Vies
for the stage and is very jealous of Bert Williazn:, whom
he claims cannot hold a candle to IV. R.

HARRY ALTON STERRETT, Kxlr, Pittsburgh, Pa.

Barnesboro High School.
“Why be a camel?”

The Indian of the class. He has but one constant friend and
that is a Wheeling stogie. Has lovely H202 hair. Can be
seen at almost any time roaming East Liberty. Alton is
very fond of the ladies and together with MacDermott‘
knows most all of the “blondes" east of the river.

205

JOHN COLVIN FETTERMAN, PH.M.
Dam of the College.

17

STANLEY JOSEPH TAYLOR, Canonsburg, Pa.

Canonsburg High School.
“What a great gift to mankind are Taylors.”

Taylor was ﬁred from “Guntown” and, landing in our
midst, created as much of a splash as could be ex/>ected
from a body of such magnitude. Has a lot of class spirit
and will take a chance at nioving the world if he thought
it would do anybody any good. Since his giddy high school
days he has become quite a business man.

ELMER THOMAS, McKeesport, Pa.
McKeesp0rt High School.
“Bad ware is never cheap.”

Why Elmer was thrust upon us is more than we can
say. He thinles that he has a big /7ull with the faculty,
butfi so, you may rest assured that it is the faculty that
is doing the pulling. Is constantly in «om/vanionshi/2 with

'Manns, which, we must say, does not add anything to his

/2 restige.

CHARLES HORNER TROXALL, Weston, W. Va.

Weston High School.
“Almost kills no man.”

Charles. like Menderson, is one of our snake hunters,
both hailing from the same place. We wonder if there
are any more at home like them. But at that, considering
l/Vest l"irs7inia, it is not so had but what a great and noble
scholar like T7’0.1"?€‘(’ll iiiiglit terminate some day into one
of our Q. A.'s at least.

MARION HARRIS TANNER, Pittsburgh, Pa.

Pittsburgh High School.
“Things are not as they are painted.”

Marion is a nice name for a great big healthy man like
Tanner, but since Marion is Tanner than Harr-is, we use
Tanner. Tanner is a shark. in lab. and his time is mostly
sbent in teaching Bnsis the trade and telling funny jokes.
Who made rice?

206

WILLIAM DAVIES WALLACE, New Castle, Pa.

New Castle High School. ‘
“Everything is difﬁcult at ﬁrst.”

Is one of the prettiest boys in our school. Blond air, red
cheeks and of course some ladies’ man. He is great on
attending high ‘school dances and calling on visiting girls
from out of town. Girls! Take 'warning, lie is some heart
breaker and runs around with Maslerson.

HOWARD ALOYSIUS WARD, Pittsburgh, Pa.

Duquesne University.
Prom. Committee.
Class President.

“The greatest events often arise from accidents.”

Ward is the Shyloclz of our class and is also some
stump speaker. Ward made our class bresidency by deter-
mined electioneering. l/V hen some one S'lt_{_£eSl3d sweaters,
Ward was there with best prices obtainable, and they say
he made a fortune. Summing up this illustrious student,
the greatest thing about him is his middle name.

HARRY LECHLER WOOD, Rockwood, Pa.

Rockwood High School.
“What blessing to man are the Woods.”

Harry Wood, coming from Rorkwood, shows that he is
a very hard wood. Here to be polished. He lilees to throw
paper wads and is getting in training for the spring baseball
period. We do not know whether he likes girls or not, but
we think he does.

CHRISTIAN W1LLIAM ZEHNER, Pittsburgh, Pa.

Pittsburgh High School.
“Crealeing carts last the longest.”

Zeiner, according to his name, might be a Christian. He
started to school -in 1911, but due to his inability to attend
regularly, he had to quit, at least that is what she told. As
.i'eincr and 5_/>0hn both claim to be Allen.Dale in a'.isguise,
we guess that accounts for their cuts from lab.

207

WILLIAM HENRY ALLEMAN, Kilt, Altouna, Pa.

Altoona High School.

“Like a lamp—not especially bright——is often turned down-
sometimes smokes—and frequently goes out at night.”
“Ally-man” is one of our stickers. Bryan has nothing

on him for coming back.

SAMUEL I. BILLIK, Pittsburgh, Pa.
“He that corrects not youth controls. not age.”

One of our friends from Russia, but nevertheless a great
talker. Frequently gives interesting talks on Socialism.
Our only member whose walk is lighter than air.

CHARLES E. BRANTLINGER, Altoona, Pa.

I Altoona. High School.

“A penny for your thoughts.”

“Brant” is only unfortunate, it isn’t lzis fault that he is
with us again, but, ‘being from Altoona, bad luck greets
him everywhere.

DE WITT CAMPBELL BARR, K\II, Pittsburgh, Pa.

Pittsburgh High School.
“One may smile and smile, yet be a villain.”

According to DeWitt's name you might think that he
did, but he doesn’t. Has made himself famous by his
singular laugh. Met his dream at the Nixon last Feb-
ruary and since then has been talking "auto” constantly.

THOMAS ALFRED CI‘-IAMBERS, rI>AX,
Sutersville, Pa.

West Newton High School.
Indiana Normal School.

“I am from Indiana Normal, I am.”

Some say Sutersville made a mistake in sending this big
bulk of humanity to Pittsburgh to learn the art of pill
rolling when his calling should be as a boiler maker, or a
future white hope.

GUY P. COULTER, North Braddock, Pa.
North Braddock High School.

"Here is a gift beyond the reach of art.”

To look at Coulter you would think that he was some
back woodsman from Rankin. Guy is a great talker, Ii/ees
an argument, but never loses his temper.

208

WILLIAM NICHOL DICHIE, Homer City. Pa.

Homer City High School.
Indiana Normal.

“This and better may do, but this and worse will never do."

Like Chambers, wears that 1952 style hair cut. His voice
is low and easy, but in volume it would compare with that
of a man twice his age and size.

JOHN EDWARD DOCKREY, Oil City, Pa.
Oil City High School.
“Laugh and the world laughs with you.”

Coming as he does from a city noted for its oil, we
suppose that accounts for his e.rtremc smoothness.

CHARLES ALBERT DROZ, Ambridge, Pa.

Ambridge High School.
“The little chauffeur, the social rage."

One of our “c0nie—backs,” but, considering that he is a
Barney Oldﬁeld, what more could we expect?

WAYNE J. EBERLY, Hallton, Pa.

Hallton High School.
Ebinboro State Normal.

"Sleep, sleep, sweet sleep.”

McDermott doesn't like Eberly a little, because he shores
so loud during lectures that he lI‘I§’(Ih‘L’lI.Y Mc eziery day.

DAVID M. FORD, Pittsburgh, Pa.
St. Mary’s High School.

“What a wonder is the Ford.”

Hopes someday to be the father of a great drug house.
Aspire: to high things, especially chemistry, in which he is
very bright.

ALEXANDER BOOLUS GANTOS, Mt. Pleasant, Pa.
Mt. Pleasant High School.

“Some men are born great, some achieve greatness, while
others ham greatness thrust upon them.”

Alex cast his shadow and it fell on lucky ground. He
has displayed many odd colors and patterns to us.

209

   

G. C. CHENTALA, Pittsburgh, Pa.
“What’s in a name?"

Never cuts classes to go fussing the tcioinen, for he is
now under subjection to a female of the species; a believer
in woman’: rights and is willing to back up his argument
in the basement at any time. Noted for his original jokes.

JOHN STANISLAUS HARENSKI, Pittsburgh, Pa.
l’iLtsbu1'g'h High School.
“Praise a wife, but remain a bachelor.”

John may be determined by the square root of his middle
name, that being his strongest asset. One of our typical
Irishmen.

GEORGE EDWIN HAURY, Monessen, Pa.

.\1un(:s< n High Sl'h0UL
“Better to wear out than to rust out.”

George graduated in tlze t‘l'Z’£’.” sports at Monessen High.
l/Ve hope that he will rroﬁt by wliat he learns and go into
the musical /vrofession.

FLOYD COOPER HOFFMAN, Greensburg, Pa.
Mercersburgh Academy.
“He laughs best who laughs last."

Floyd hails from Mercersburg and is better than the
rule. He can bear more lab. utensils than Bisil and H00/zer
combined and is also a sure shot when throwing leaf lard.

JAMES ANDREW JACKSON, Pittsburgh, Pa.

Armstrong Technical High School.
“A great soldier was Andrew Jackson.”

One of our three dark horses and. although the smallest,
is not the worst, if T(’0J‘S(’ there eonld lie.

ANDREW KARABASZ, Pittsburgh, Pa.

Duquesne University.

“Shall live to ﬁght another day."

Has the dignity and glibe of an ancient duke. When he
slides into the class roonz (’7'(‘l'_\'l70d_\' takes a look.

JAMES A. MAHER, New Castle, Pa.

St. Ronzwentures College.
“Per aspera ad astra. ’

knowing a lot more than he is ready to let be known.

EDWIN JAMES MATHEWS, Pittsburgh, Pa.
Pittsburgh High School. '

"'Amlrition should be made of sterner stn2‘l‘.”

The village cutup. When anything contrary to the rules
is to he done, lid-win is among the leaders. /1 specialist on
burlesque and very seldom misses one.

HOWARD EARL MILLARD, McKeesport, Pa.
McKeesport High School.
“Better late thrive than never do well."

Hails from Sclimidt’s town and, like him, is very good
looking. If given proper training, will Qwn the Island
Trust Co. some day.

RAYMOND KEITH O’BRIEN, Pittsburgh, Pa.
" Pittsburgh High Srhool. -
“Red headed and tall, but a sharlr after all."
Only his dislike for 'Z('0I‘lC ran lreep liini from taking

highest honors. He has had great e.i‘[ve/jienee and tutored
under “Cuy," the man famous for nialmzg Juniors.

JAMES ANTHONY. PALANGE, Pittsburgh, Pa.
I’itt:<hurg'h ‘High School.

:1

"Me thinks that is a rooster e/‘owing.
Has a great reputation for inquisitiveness. When asking

anestio/is during Quiz periods. it is not to gain knowledge,
but inst that Pittshnrgli stall.

GEORGE RICHARD RYALL, «mx, Greensburg, Pa.
‘ - (ireensburg High School.

“The 'Z('(II'l(l l\’tIOT('S little of its greatest men.”

li/hen George struvlc Westnioreland eomity some thirty
odd years ago there was great tall.’ of the ealanzity.

211

JACK SCHOENBERG, Pittsburgh, Pa.
Pittsburgh High School.
“What, here you are! Out with it."

An inseparable companion of Harry, and, while we feel
his presence, were it not for his witty sfatenients and con-
tinuous talkzng, we would hardly know of his existence.

JOSEPH STARR, Chicora, Pa.
Jacques Academy.
"What sweet delight a quiet life affords."

Joseph is not the only Starr in our college, but he
trinkles higher up.

CLARENCE RUSSEL STATLER, Grafton, W. Va.
Grafton High School.
“All the world lows a lover.”

Statler looks very fastidious in his long white coat, and
if Father Time is good to him he may get a Pl1.G.

HARRY AUGUSTUS STYPE, East Liverpool, 0.

East Liverpool High School.
“Do I not resemble Napoleon?”

Is very important looking in lectures and when dolled
up in his white coat makes his neighbors look like helpers
of some great chemist.

JOHN S. TRESS, Beaver Falls, Pa.
St. Vincent College.
“I am a stranger here; Heaven is my home.”

John came an innocent youth from St. Vincent, but\
under the tutilage of the Junior class, it did not take him
long to get on to our ways.

THOMAS FRANCIS WEGER, Pittsburgh, Pa.

Allegheny High School.
“I’ll wager he is bashful.”

The little boy with the rosy cheeks blushes whenever
any one looks at him. Francis is a shark and his asso-
ciates have quite a time keeping him from making the
highest marks.

SISTER MARY CLARA WOLF, Pittsburgh, Pa.

FOOTBALL

 

H. F. JENKINS
Student Manager

The football team last fall enjoyed the most successful season in the
history of the University. A team composed largelyiof new men, under
the leadership of a new coach, confronted with the hardest schedule ever
a1'1-anged for a Pitt team, finished the season with a record of six victories,
onetie, and only t\vo defeats. The weaknesses of the 1912 team seemed
to have been entirely eradicated, the men almost always having the neces-
sary punch.

The ﬁrst step in the building up of this machine was the election 1-ast

spring of Joseph M. Duff, Princeton, ’12, as head coach, with E. H. W.

(“Nubs”) Harlan, Princeton, ’07, as assistant coach. These men were

V both rated as ‘‘All American” players While they were in Princeton, Duff

as a lineman and Harlan as a lialfback. ’l‘hns their thorollgh knowledge
of all departments of the gaine lnmle them a pe1'feet cont-l1i11g ‘combination.

‘ Preliminary training qu«arters were provided by A. K. Hamilton on
his farm near VVind1)er, Pa. There a large portion of the squad reported
for practice in the ﬁrst week of Septeniber, and worked hard and
patiently until the opening game with Ohio Northern on Saturday,
September 27. Of the 1912 team Galviii, Leahy, and Connelly were miss-
ing, While among the new men were Collins, Soppitt, Heil, Wi11ia1n~son,

The Pitt team entered the ﬁrst gzalne of the season fresh from the
training camp, and defeated Ohio Nortliern by a score of 67 to 6.

Captain VVargner made the ﬁrst touclidown of the game by picking
11p a fumble and running over the line, his ﬁrst. performance of the kind

221

ill the season. Of the twenty players used by Coach ])11ﬁ', all (lid well,
but the whole squad seemed to lack teuniwork, most of the points being
scored by individual efforts.

U. S. NAVAL ACADEMY

On Thursday, October second, the Varsity and :1, small l)2lI1(l of root-
ers left for Annapolis, where, on the following_; Szitlmlzty they hztttled the
Middies to at scoreless tie. In the first half the Pitt n1en seemed to be
afflictetl with a touch of stiz1ge—f1*igl1t which prevellted any show of hril»
liant tezlniwork, altlimlgll they put up :1 stiihhorn tlefense each time their
goal was threatened.

The Navy played very little open football, gaining ground on line
plunges by her p0Wert'11l l)2l(‘l{ﬁ(*l(l. The Pittites, on the other hand,
showed great diversity of style, m;1l<in;_>; the lm'g;est ;:;1i11s on shift forma-

lNDlAN GAME

WEST VIRGINIA UNIVERSITY

One week after the Navy game, Pittsburgli defeated West Virginia
by the score of 40 to 0. In the first half tl1e Blue and Gold warriors
played a rather listless game, and scored only one touchdown against the
scrappy and consistent Mountaineers. When the whistle blew for the
secondihalf, Pitt. came back with a coinplete reversal of form and piled
up ﬁve more touchdowns in quick su(teession.

CARLISLE INDIAN SCHOOL

On October eighteenth, the Carlisle Indians invaded Pittsburgh and
met the surprise of their lives at the hands of the VVagner tribesmen.
After a battle that raged desperately for every minute of the four long
quarters, the Indians went down to defeat by the score of 12 to 6. Glenn
Warner, this year, was without the services of the famous Jim Thorpe,
but his place was ably ﬁlled by Guyon, one of the best halfbacks ever
seen on Forbes Field. '

Pitt started the game on the defensive. Carlisle attacked the line
furiously, but it held ﬁrm until the end of the second quarter, when
Guyon went through for a touchdown.

 

I11 the begixiniiig of the second half the Panther crew started to Show
their real form. Several long runs by Dillon and successful foi-ward
passes brouglit the hall to the Indizlns’ 5—_va11-d line just as the q11z11-te1°
ended. \Vhe11 play was 1'es11111ed, \Vi11i;1111.<o11 palssed the hall to “Red”

CORNELL UNIVERSITY

On the ’I‘hursday evening following the Indian game, the Pitt squad
and its followers left for Ithaca, where they arrived at noon of the next
day. They went immediately to the Rogue’s Harbor Hotel, several miles
out of Ithaca, Where they remained until late Saturday morning.

As they had done the week before, the Pittites came from behind and
snatched victory o11t of seeming defeat. The Ithacans, at their best,
appeared to be stronger than the Gold and Blue, but they could not stand
the hard pace set by the visitors, and toward the end of the game they
slowed up and gave the Panthers their chance. Coach Duff made but
one substitution, Dillon replacing Peek in the second l1al-f.

Cornell scored the ﬁrst touchdown of the game near the end of the
second quarter. In the ﬁrst part of the second half (“ornell again threat-
ened to score, but lost the ball on Pitt’s 12-yard line.

Pitt then worked the ball down to Corne11’s 5-yard line and lost it
on a bad forward pass. Barrett. tried a low, quick kick from formation,
which VVa.gner intercepted, running from the 50-yard li11e for a touch-

‘ down. VVilliamson tied the score by kicking goal.

out on Forbes Field, for, apart from Lafayette’s fumbles, the two teams
were about equal in strength.

goal.

WASHINGTON AND JEFFERSON COLLEGE

The W‘. & J. game was the greatest. disa.ppoint1nent of the season
for Coach Dutf’s hllskies. The I’antl1ers, kliowing that all the “dope”
favored the Red and Black, still had strong hopes of being able to turn
the trick and put one over on their bittei-est rivals. It is needless, how-
ever, to say that these hopes were vain. The men f1-om “little” Washing‘-
ton showed their snperioi-ity in a manner very disagreeable to a supporter
of the Gold and Blue, as they made it evident that Pitt stood second
in all departments of the game, even on a wet ﬁeld.

W. & J. c..~\.\11«:

The first of tl1e visitors‘ two tourlidowns was tl1e result of three
perfect forward passes and a11 end run by S1)ieL‘el in the first period.
The second was the e11d of an uninterrupted advance tfrom Wasli-Jet‘f‘.4
46-yard line to Pitt’s goal. Shot’ srored the only touchdown t'or the
locals by falling on the ball, over the line, after Goodwin had tomhezl
an(l missed one of VVilli-.1n1son’s punts. I’atterso11 kicked two perfect
ﬁeld goals for VV. & J. The ﬁnal score was 19 to 6.

PENNSYLVANIA STATE COLLEGE

For the ﬁrst time in three years, Tll&l11l{Sf.,"l\‘ll1§1 Day was a real holi-
day for the loyal sons of Pitt. Penn State rame to I’ittsh11rgl1 and were
defeated to the tune of 7 to 6, after one of the most Stl1l)l)()1'11 battles of
the year. A ﬁne, (l1-izzlitlg rain fell all afternoon o11 a ﬁeld of mud,
while the fog was so thick tl1at all the players looked alike. Pitt showed
a return almost to mid-season t'orn1, and State played a wo11derf11l game
from start to ﬁnish.

The play was mostly in the center of the ﬁeld. States touclidown
was made in the second quarter, (‘lark takin_u' the ball over the line after

a determined attack which started iii the exact center of the gridiron.
Captain Miller missed an easy cliance i11 kicking the goal from touch-
down. VVilliamson made Pitt’s score by plunging straight through the
center of the State line, running between Clark and Tobin, and eluding
“Shorty” Miller. After his 67-yard run, he kicked the goal that Won the
game.

The Hotel Schenley was the scene of the annual football banquet
given on Thanksgiving night by the Athletic Committee. Innnediately
before the celebration feast the election was held for captain of the 1914
team. This position was given to W'ayne B". ( “Red” ) Smith, Varsity
guard for the past three years, and a man fully deserving of the honor.
Joseph M. Duff has again been elected head coach. The following men
were granted letters in football: Captain J. H. VVagner, W. B. Smith,
J. P. Herron, W. H. Cowell, Leo Collins, Rendall Soppitt, J. M. Jones-,
(‘. S. Reese, I. Shapira, R. H. Heil, R. D. Peck, G. M. Williamson, Philip
Dillon, C. E. Thornhill, E. F. Ammons, F. F. \Vard, H. D. Shot’, and
M. R. Hoag.

K. E. Davis, Graduate Manager of Athletics, has announced for 1914
one of the most attractive schedules ever arranged for a Pitt team, but it
is an assured fact that. judgiiig from the present outlook, the team will
make a creditable shoxving.

(‘aptain ()rhsenhirt‘s basket ball quintet enjoyed a fairly successful
season this year, in spite of the niisfortunes elicountered on the North-
ern trip and the quarantine after the trip. About half of the games were
won, a11d it is certain that tl1e percentage of victories would have been
higher, l1ad the team been blessed with an even break of luck. The season
opened on tl1e ninth of January at Trees Gymnasiuln, Pitt beating Ge.-
neva (‘ollege by the score of 28 to 21. A week later Carnegie Tech was
defeated, 32 to 23. Penn State beat us by three points in an extra period
game, the ﬁrst for the championship of the western division of the Penn-
sylvania Intercollegiate Basket Ball League. ‘

The Northern trip, the ﬁrst ever attempted by a Pitt team, was a
dismal failure as far as victories were concerned. Niagara University
won 011 January 27 by four points. During the next three days the team
lost to (‘olgate, Syracuse and St. Lawrence in three close games. An
extra period was required to decide the contest with Syracuse, the ﬁnal
score being 36 to 29. Rochester University won the last game of the trip
by a large score.

After their return from the North the members of the team were
quarantined for a period of ten days, Manager Murray having contracted

CHALMERS HALL
Student Manager

The Pitt track team last year had the a(lvaI1ta;.>;'e of an indoor track
in the new Trees (;‘rymnasiu1n, where they practiced faithfully all winter.
Chalmers Hall, ’13, was the manager of the team, and he -arranged a
schedule well worthy of the team’s best efforts, while Captain Rosenthal
'worked hard at all times to lead his men to victory. Some .of the
eandidates were entered in the Y. M. C. A. meet at the Pittsburgh Expo-
sition building‘ on February 21, and they did very well, winning the
VVestern Pennsylvania college relay and many individual events. West-
inghouse Club was also defeated in an indoor dual meet several weeks
later in the g_\f1nn'asiun1 of the Club.

As soon as the Weather permitted the candidates were out running
and practicing 011 the stadium, and a few weeks later the members of the
relay team were selected. This team was made up of Captain J. VV. Ros-
enthal, Matt Marshall, Harry Shoﬂ’ and \Vallaee Thomas, who along with
Geo]-,2;e M (-Donald, were entered in the University of Pennsylvania Relay

Saturday afternoon on Schenley Oval by the score of 701/; to 411/_». This
was the ﬁrst dual meet ever held with the Eastonians and it was a great
success. Caldwell of Lafayette broke the Western Pennsylvania colle;_>;iate
record in t.wo-mile event, running: the (listance in 10 minutes and 20
seconds. Pittsl)111'g'11 won nine firsts and eig,-‘ht seconds in the fourteen
events on the program. A

The dual meet with VVashington and Jefferson was a great disap-
pointment. It was staged at VVashington, Pa., on the tenth of May, and

Apart from the disast1'o11s Euste1'11 trip, the U11iVe1'sity Tennis Team
last year had :1 very s11(-cesSt'11l se;1so11. H2111-y Se_y111o111-V, the well—known
e.\'pe1-t, was :1ppoiI1ted 21dvise1' in tennis. The Captilill of the team was
A. P. VV1-igI1t, '13, and t11e other 111911 chosen \\'e1'e ML-Elli-oy, Flood, and
Lytle. Owing to :1. long spell of i11cle111e11t weatheI°,’tl1ese men were 1111-
able to get into very good f:§ltn1_v‘l_)(‘f()1'(% tl1e_ig_,peni11g of the season, as there
are no chances for indoor 111*1wti5é  U11iVe1*sity.

The season opened with 111111:11«::1sr(»1-_1_1 trip, which i11cl11ded matches
with [,l11iVe1'Sif_‘\' of I’o1111.s“\'ld:\"z1”11iz1;“’H;11*\'z11td’, Yale, and Princeton. As the
members of t11ese teams were fo1't1111ate in hz1Vi11g good indoor 00111-ts for
their early spring p1':1(-.ti(-0, tl1o)' \\'e1'e all i11 pm-feet condition, so the
poorly trained Pitt men had little <'l1a11ce to win any victories.

At Penn all t11e 11111t(-lws were lost but 0110, Flood defeating his op-
ponent. Ha1-V:11'd and Yale both took all their 111a1t(-thos, although they
were forced to extend t11e111sL-lvos to their 11t1110st. At Princeton Flood

257

again managed to best his man, Captain Montgomery.‘ On their return
home the players had nothing but praise for the cordiality and ﬁne treat-
ment which they received at the hands of each of the universities at which
they played.

On May 24 the University of Michigan tennis team stopped here,
near the end of their victorious Eastern trip. Out of the six matches
played Pitt won four, McEllroy defeating his opponent in _two love sets,
Lytle and Flood winning their matches, and VVright and Lytle winning
their match in the doubles.

Penn State was to be met at Pittsburgh 011 May 23, but this match
was called off on -account of rain. On the thirty-ﬁrst the team defeated
State in six straight matches at State College. A few days later, June 5,
Washington and Jefferson was also sh11t ou-t by the score of six matches
to none. As a result of these victories the team was justiﬁed in claiming
the collegiate championship of Western Pennsylvania.

The prospects for a championship team this year are excellent, as
the only member of last year‘s team lost by graduation was VV1-ight, and
there is a wealth of good material to choose from. Mr. Seymour will
again act as adviser. Lytle was elected manager for 1914.

WRESTLING

Pit*t’s ﬁrst year of intercol1eg'iate wrestling was a fairly successful
one, considering the inexperience of the men and the caliber of the teams
met during the season. Leo Collins, former intercollegiate heavyweight
champion, was re-appointed Adviser in VVrestling, while the manager of
the team was J. P. Harvey, ’14. About thirty men came out for the
team, and after working out for a few weeks, the following gt-applers
were chosen to represent the University: 115—pound class, Forbes, fresh-
man; 125-pound class, Reilly, freshman; 135-pound class, Riehl, junior;
145-pound class, Ray (Mlliiis, junior; 158-pound class, Herron, sorpho-
more; 175-pound class, Jones, freshman; heavyweight, Givens, sopho-
more. Early in the season Herron withdrew from the team and was
replaced by Nichols of the sophomore class.

The ﬁrst. event o11 the schedule was the dual meet with Penn, Feb-
ruary 6, at Philadelphia. Reilly was the only man of the Pitt team to
gain a decision, all the others losing on falls. On F9l)1"11aI‘_V 21, the Pitt
matmen lost to Penn State at State College, the’Blue and White grapplers
winning all six matches. The big: wrestling tournament held by the

261 .

Pittsburgh Athletic Association resulted in a tie between P. A. A. and
Pitt, each team securing 26 points. The preliminary bouts were decided
on February 27, and the ﬁnal matches the following evening.

On March 23, the only home meet on the schedule was held at Trees
Gymnasium with Lafayette. Forbes and Reilly of Pitt won the ﬁrst two
bouts, while Riehl of Pitt and Ellis of Lafayette struggled to a draw after
twelve minutes of the hardest kind of work. The Eastonians won all the

other matches on falls. Collins gave Mummert of Lafayette a hard battle"

in the 17 5-pound event, but was ﬁnally thrown. The meet with Lafayette
closed the schedule.

Ray Collins, ’15, succeeds to the wrestling managership for next
year, with R. L. Huﬂ, ’16, as assistant manager. VVith all the members
0vf'the 1914 team back in school next year, and a schedule made 11p of the
best teams in the east, wrestling will become the most popular minor
sport in the University.

Fencing at the University was more popular this year t11an ever
before. Professor Postgate, fencing instructor at the Pittsburgh Athletic
Association, was reappointed coach, with W. G. Gray, J r., ’15, as man-
ager. The team was made up of Gray, ’15; Roney, ’15, and Bern-arcl, ’15,
with Edsall, ’16, as alternate. Although the men had the beneﬁt of last
year’s experience, it was a l1ard task to prepare the team for the pre-
liminary trials of the Illtercollegiate Fencing League of America.

The trials for the Southern division of the league were held at
Annapolis, Md., the Naval Academy, Penn, a'11d Pitt being the only insti-
tutions represented, as Princeton failed to send a team. The score was
as follows 2‘ Navy, 15 points; Pennsylvania, 11 points; Pittsburgh, 1
point. Bernard was the only member of the Pitt team who won a match.
defeating Finlay of Penn by the score of 11 to 7. As the team failed to
qualify, the University will not be represented at the ﬁnals of the league,
which will be held in New York City. As the interest grows in this
branch of sport, in a few years Pitt should be 11p among the leaders.

accounts for his staying out of the Junior-Senior football

Lilee the snail, he is slow but sure. Came to Pitt through
the, influence of “Cinders" Ashe, and [he Pitt Hana’ surely
beneﬁted, for J. 5. is a peach of a musician. Has the
distinetion of being the most [rrodigious eater extant. There
“ain’t no lea7.'in’s" when Ike’s around. Favorite dish—
everything.

HARRY LEONARD BAER, <I>AE, Finleyville, Pa.

Pittsburgh High School.
Class Football.
Varsity Track Squad.

Harry doesn’t get excited, is calm at all times, except in
the “qui::.':es’—l1e thinks of what he should haze said after
class. He is 7‘€l‘_\' congenial, always toillfng to lend a
helping hand——es/>eciall_v when “fawn" is selling pins. His
only failing is dancing and at that he's a "Bacr.”

CHARLES W. BETHUNE, NZN, Wilkinsburg, Pa.

Y. M. C. A.

Has relatives in the undertaking business, so Chuck is
studying to be a Doctor. Looks like collusion. 'Seems
uninteresting until you become acquainted with him-—then
look out! He'll (the apostro/7he’s there) worst you in a
verbal parley every time. Specializes in pinie teas a la
automobile.

"S/Jaghett.” The jolliest Dutchman (.7) of them all. Likes
bananas but is fondest of Olive (the sweet, not pic/«led
kind). Revealed to Ethics class that some people live
despite the doctor’s treatment. The rate of mortality is
bound to increase when Tony is tn.-‘tied loose on the
defenseless public with his M. D. degree.

Y. W. C. A

Pitkln Club.
College Choir.

Violently opjiosed to woman suﬂ‘rage—with emphasis on
the adverb. Skilled in writing booklets on household
management. We expect great things from Gretchen since
we saw her executive ability in the campaign for that three
million. Had more Freshie Boys working for her than any
other Co-ed.

ELLA COHEN, BET, Pittsburgh, Pa;

Pittsburgh High School.

Ever smiling eheerily to all fversnns tulzozn she meets,
Lilces to help a friend where’er she can.
Loves to set the heart awhirl of every boy she greets,
Always on the lookout for a man.
Ouch!

WILLIS J. COLBERT, Jeannette, Pa.

Jeannette High School.

“Isn’t that right, Squire?" Always /n-owes his assertions
b_1 appealing to one of his fellow citizens. “Prrce” is not
afpreeiated. He and “Gibby" love to argue on the current
topics of the day. Isn’t fat enou_s_rh to grease a /‘air of
spectacles.

HARRISON DAVIDSON, Center, Pa.

A real wonder. Actually insisted upm paying his Owl

MICHAEL DEPTA, NEN, Mount Pleasant, Pa.

Milwaukee Normal School. '
Class Treasurer.

Mike is our chronic minority. Loves argument so well
that he will not eat that which agrees witlz him. His
blonde hair and blue eyes so won our conﬁdence tlzat he
was chosen class treasurer-—to talre care 0/ what he might
get by force or other means.

MARY DONOGHUE, Munhall, Pa.

Munhall High School.
Women's Activities.

Mary has two sorrows in life—the poor car ser-vice from
Homestead and the awful tendency of lecture notes to make
their escape. Rising earlier would remedy the effects of
the one—Mary might reach school on time occasionally. As
for the other—she told Joe Richardson that she really
ought to have a private secretary.

HAROLD SEARS DOWNING, Wilkinsburg, Pa.

A big, long, disconnected string of beans. Beats it around
through the halls as if he owns the University. I mportant
in business-——which is attending to the business of everybody
else and not his own. Always collecting moncy——-but for
whom? However, he is a mighty fine fellow and bats .400
in the Popularity League. Out of my way, boys, ("in the
Chancellor.

WILLIAM BOYD DUFF, Wilkinsburg, Pa.

A cousin of "Silent foe," whom he resembles about as

“THE LITTLE SUFFRAGETTE”

The greatest complinient to he said of those back of the club is
that the play this year was a complete success a11d worthy of Pitt. Never
before have we seen as well a balanced cast, costnines so beautiful,

scenery as appropriate, play as
well written and the chorus girls
as sweet as they were this year.
The music and dancing, under the
direction of Dr. Tyler and Gus.
Schnahle, were the best ever. The
cast was well drilled by Mr. Story

The Student Activities Books
brongllt out the crowds and then
everytlning was complete. “The
Little Sntfragette” was in her
glory and “s11ﬁ'e1'ed” at a mighty
lively pace.

One step in advance was the
earlier production of the home
show. This was a g1-eat improve-
ment over past years and we hope
that it will continue to be the
(-luh‘s policy. A longer trip on the
road is all that is needed to make
this club one of the most popular

as well as one of the best college d1-am-atic cl11bs in the country.
The club's success was largely due to the energy and enthusiasm of
l)r. Ashhrooke, Professor Meller. Dr. Tyler and Mr. Story.

The Young Women’s Christian Association is recognized as one of the most
prominent women’s organizations in the University. During the four years of its
existence, the membership has increased four-fold, making the present enrollment
sixty. Each year a greater number of representative women have become identiﬁed
with the Association, and as a result there has been marked progress, in the work as
well as in the interest.

This year has been a particularly successful one. The Meetings, which are held
weekly, have been well attended. Besides those of a purely devotional character,
meetings have been held in the interests of home and foreign missions, and social
service work in the city, the speakers coming both from within and without the Uni-
versity. There have also been three joint meetings held with the Y. M. C. A.

Aside from these serious meetings, there have been three socials, the largest
and most successful social event of the Association year being a party held in co-
operation with the Y. M. C. A., which was enthusiastically attended by both men
and women.

Two delegates were sent to the Summer Conference at Eagles Mere, Pa., seven
to the Western Pennsylvania Student Volunteer Convention at Geneva College, and
two to the National Student Volunteer Convention at Kansas City, Mo. This Kansas
City Convention has been a potent force in arousing new missionary study classes,
and a very successful plan has been inaugurated for systematic weekly giving to the
foreign work at the Buenos Aires Association. A group of members are also doing
active social work in our own city.

The difficult problem of raising money to pay the expenses of convention delegates,
etc., has been solved in a rather unique way. The term “Y. W. C. A. Dairy_Lunch”
has become a part of the University Vocabulary, and the eagerness with which these
lunches are patronized, shows that even University students must satisfy the “inner
man.” During the year one lunch was served by the Y. W. C. A., and a second, by the
Y. W. C. A. and Y. M. C. A., working in partnership.

In January, 1914, shortly after the eleven delegates of the University of Pittsburgh
returned from the great Student Volunteer Convention at Kansas City, Rev. Dr. Hugh
T. Kerr of the Shadyside Presbyterian Church and Dr. Elizabeth L. Martin, Advisor
to VVomen of the University, kindly offered their services for the purpose of con-
serving the missionary spirit which had been aroused and promoting the study of
missions in the University. A meeting of the delegates was held for. discussion,
committees were appointed, and at the ﬁrst regular session, an organization was
eﬁected, oﬂicers elected, and ﬁfteen charter members were present. The name
“Pitkin Club” was adopted in honor of Horace Pitkin. the famous missionary to China,
who gave up his life during the Boxer rebellion. The name also symbolizes the
religious fellowship of Pitt.

The Club met every Wednesday noon during the Winter and Spring Terms, at the
Shadyside Church, and through the generosity of two of its members, a delicious
luncheon was served each week by the Business Women’s Association of the Church.
Dr. Kerr was unanimously chosen as the teacher and the book selected for study was
Dr. John R. Mott's “The Decisive Hour of Christian Missions.” The work consisted
largely of original research and special assignments based on the text, by the members,
under the wise and sympathetic guidance of Dr. Kerr. The interest grew steadily,
week by week, until a maximum of thirty members was reached.

The Club is undenominational and co—educational, its purpose, as expressed in the
constitution, being: “The careful study of the non-Christian lands and the missionary
work there, for the intelligence of those who will enter this work and to encourage
others to enter the same.” The Club expects to continue its work next year.

The missionary zeal of the University, instead of being exhausted by the formation
of the Pitkin Club was only increased. A second mission study class with about thirty
members was organized in March. This Club met every Thursday noon at the First
Baptist Church, where a free lunch was kindly served, and Dr. Frederic T. Galpin
consented to act as teacher. Dr. Mott's book was also studied in this class, of which
the officers were: ‘

The Y. M. C. A. during the last year has passed through a most
successful season. The most important accomplishments were the Kansas
City trip and the formation of the Pitkin Club.

Through the efforts of Dr. McClel]and, the association was able to
send nine delegates to the Seventh Quadrennial Student Volunteer
Convention for Foreign Missions, held at Kansas City, Mo., from January
1-6, 1914. _

Besides this good work in the creating of interest in foreign missions
the club has been carrying on an active campaign among the students and
has been very successful in social and religious work among the student
body.

One very important step in the right direction was the bringing
together of the Y. W. C. A. and the Y. M. C. A. in a social way, thus
bringing the two societies closer together and allowing them" to work

_ more in harmony for the mutual cause. ,

Of the one hundred and ﬁfty manuscripts submitted
by the stndellts of the various colleges and universities of
Pennsylvania to the Pennsylvania Arbitration a11d Peace

Society, Mr. l}roido’s or-.1tion was one of the six chosen by the com«

mittee of judges.

Competing -against the repre-
sentatives of four other Pennsyl-
vania‘ Colleges at the ﬁrst ora-
torical contest held on .April 24 at
Bucknell University, Mr. Broido
showed his splendid preparation
and excellent thought when he
carried off ﬁrst honors.

On Friday evening, May 1,
l’itt’s orator again duplicated his
feat by winning the ﬁrst prize of
$100, oﬂfered by the New York
Peace Society, at Gray Hall of the
College of the City of New York.
Mr. Broido also competed against
representatives of the colleges ot'
the Intercollegiate Civic Ora-
torical League, held at Allegheny
College on May 8.

 

MR. LOUIS Bnomo

Under the careful coa(-,hing~ of Prof. Lane of the D(‘I)ill'tlll<*11l of
Public Speaking, Pitt’s orator rounded his oration i11to tine shape. It
is a discussion of “National Honor and Peat-e." In it Mr. Broido shows
that International Peace must come through a higher conception of
national honor, a conception that will make war dishonorable. He
also answers the argument of the protagonists of war that peace will
destroy the ﬁghting spirit which is so desirable.

Four years ago, when the University was entering upon that period
of greatest development after having moved to its new site in the Schenley
district, it became necessary for the student publication to keep pace, and
through the efforts of one ambitious, educated youth, by name Frank 0.
Stewart, the monthly magazine, the Oourunt, was supplanted by the
greatest sheet in College newspaperdom, Tun PITT WEEKLY.

Since that time the paper has had made wonderful progress. It
has grown from a small sheet to a six—coluinn newspaper. In past days
the staff secured its regular exercise by spending two hours every
Wednesday evening in trying to locate a room in which to pursue its
journalistic pr-oclivities, and the “cubs” might have been seen spilling ink
up on the roof of Thaw Hall or in the cellar of State, but those good
old days are past, and now the stait has commodious quarters in Thaw
Hall. H .
The second editor of the paper was Ralph E. Jeorge, and he injected
a ﬁery personalism into his work that rivaled that of Horace Greeley.

After a year of labor personiﬁed, “Pap” laid down the reins in
favor of L. G. Boggs, and the work of spilling the ink went on. “Keggy"
had a regular mania for newspaper work, and it is said that he used a ﬁle
of PITT WEEKLIES for a downy pillow while he pursued his slumbers.

336

337

All good college editors must go, so “Keggy” graduated from the
staff in favor of J. P. Harvey. During 1’au1’s reign the paper made good
progress and the style was changed to that of a regular newspaper.
Circulatioli increased, and the paper was placed one rung higher 11p in
the ladder.

Harvey had visions of graduation, however, and gave over his
position to J. Clare George, the present editor. “Built,” as his name
indicates, is small in stature, but we who know him feel that this does
not apply to his executive ability, and expect great things during his
reign.

The best of men are apt to fall into error, so the Advisory Board
keeps a watchful eye over the gelleral maneuvers of the staff at all times.

The staff for the ensuing year is as follows:

Tilt» Svrnatr

HE SENATE this year has gone througli its year of trials
a11d tribulations and has appeared after the year of strife
with many scars and scratches. To say whether the body
as a whole has progressed or not is without our jurisdiction,
but it would be safe to say that never before has the student

_ body taken a greater interest in the deliberations.

They saw ﬁt to cause a second election of THE OWL BOARD, but
have not as yet had a Cap Night. They have passed many laws, but
few of them have been e11t'orced. The last is especially true of the rules
governing the Freshmen. These rules have been passed, discussed, etc.,
ad inﬁmitmn, but little heed has been taken by the youngsters.

The Senate, to gain and hold the respect of the student body, alumni
and faculty, must get a new lease on life, more authority, less talk and
more energy. The student body will back them up if they show a deter-
mination to take active, yet conservative, control of student affairs, but
until that time comes the Senate will be a thing of name only.

HE \Vo.\IE.\"’s Ac'J.‘I\'I'I7I1<}s A.\‘.\‘()(‘IA'l‘I();\') po~pul:1rl_\f known as the
VV. A. A., is the name of the o1';::11ii7.ution of women stutlents
of the UniVersit_y whose purpose is to further their interests
in every direction. It is the ontt-ome of :1 body known as
the Girls’ Executive Clomiiiittee, whirh was t)l’j_":llll’/.(‘1l in
1911-12. This committee was composed of one 1nem1>e1- from

each class in the College and School of Edilczition, n1:1l<in;,r ei;,-'ht, repre-

sentatives, who were elected h_\' their respective elzisses. The t-mmnittee
looked after all questions pertaining to nliiversity life, from the lizizim:
of the fair frail Fresh to the speediiig of the pm-tiiig (lrad. The pi-ohlems
to he 1net with and solved were those for the hetterment of the young
women in their every day and S0(‘l21l intert-om-se with their fellow
students. It furnished 21 representative hod_\' to express the wishes and
opinions of the girls and :1 l0(':1l body for their student §,vovernment,.

In the Spring of 1913 the old order yielded, giving: place to new.

The Execiltive Committee was dissolved and the present one, the Women’s

 

344

Activities Association, took its place. This Association is broader in
its constitution and provides for every possible condition. It controls
the ditferent activities of the girls——a Glee Club is being formed under
its direction, and a Dramatic Club is already doing excellent work. Next
year the Association hopes to have a basket ball team.

The oﬂicers of the W. A. A. consist of a president, vice p1'e~sid<-nt,
secretary and treasurer, together with one member from each sorority
and an equal number of non-sorority girls. No girl can be appointed
to office Whose class standing is not satisfactory. The Association has
done much this year under the direction of Olive Carnahan as president,
Bertha Kirkpatrick, vice president and treasurer, and Pauline Abraham,
secretary. A series of teas have been held during the winter, a picnic
supper and a dance. They were all Well attended and the prevailing
spirit seemed to be towards unity.

With this Association the old adage—“You cannot keep a good
thing doWn”——bids fair to assert itself. The women of the University
of Pittsburgh are members of a large and ever-increasing body and the
spirit among them is for equality. Through the W. A. A. they look
forxvard with expectum-y to the time when this, their dearest hope, will
be realized.

Nuts

7 HERE are all kinds a11d shapes of nuts. In other words, there
are nuts and n11ts, and the squirrels chase merrily after all
of them. \Vith most of the commoner varieties we are fa-
miliar. These include peanuts, walnuts, chestnuts, and
doughnuts. ))11‘t a very common nut, and o11e which is but
obs-curely known, is the Pitt nut——the nuttiest nut of all nuts. This par-
ticular kind of nut is recognizable by the following characteristic—the
Pitt nut is invariably “cracked”; in other words, ready for picking. He
is usually rough and hard, but occasionally a soft-shelled specimen is dis-
covered. This particular brand, however, is very rare. At all events, his
nuttiness is unquest.ionable. .

The photograph on the opposite page is that of the Home for Over-

 

" worked Pitt Students——otherwise known as the Finishing School for Pitt

Nuts—and the inmates sure are tinished. _At first glance, the picture
might seem to be a photograph of the “Students’ Activities Building,”
but such is not the case.

In the picture may be seen many prominent. Pitt nuts, each of whom
is plying his own particular hallucination with the utmost zest and
fervor. Identiﬁcation is by no means difficult. Dick Greer is located
upon the roof and is saving the University the expense of a spring train-
ing trip by warming up upon the anatomy of Jim Allison, who, attired
in a blanket swiped from Bernie ()‘IIagan‘s bunk, imagines that he is the
Fountain of Youth. I11 the extreme northeast apartment can be seen
Bill Grrose buried in deep meditation over the monientous question,
Should he wear the Frat dress suit to the Prom or “hock” it for a round
of meal tickets at VVolt'e’s? Speaking of the Prom, do you lamp “Peedie”
Bier and Ray Steele learning a few of the new vines and walks upon the
northwest brink of the nightmare‘? As regards the northeast corner, we
shudder for the fate of Bill McKi1me_v, the track star, when Steve Dillon
slams out that three-bagger against Bill’s cranium.

As for the identity of the remainder, we leave that to the readers.
The picture thus becomes a sort of puzzle page, and as a prize for the
greatest number of correct solutions the OWL BOARI) offers a scholarship
in the institution depicted—the Home for Over-worked Pitt Students,
or the Finishing School for Pitt Nuts.

Gone But Not Forgotten

How dear to my heart is the old public towel,

Which, in its crude vileness, once hung on the rolls.

’Twas greasy and dirty, ’twas truly quite foul,
But ﬁrm in my grasp were its plenteous folds.

What fond recollections the common cup's bringing,
Which always stood willing to serve me so well;

’Tis true that its sides were germ-laden and clinging,
But free was its service, with nothing to sell.

And now. for our use, has stern science supplied us
With sterilized cups and with towels quite pure.
The old were the source of the deadly bacillus,
The new make our health and contentment secure.

But damp are my hands with the thin clammy paper,
And drinking’s expensive and wobbly too;

My heart is quite sad for the friends gone forever,
So cold and inadequate seemeth the new.

Lots of Things at Pitt

I met a friend the other day—a stranger here in town,
Said I, “Come out to Pitt and I’ll be glad to show you 'round.”
“Well, well,” said he, “What have you there? l’ve somewhere heard of it.”
“Why, man!” said I. “Just come and see, we’ve
Lots of things at Pitt.”

And then I told him of the things we have around the place:
Of Doc McCormick as the man who sets our ﬂeeting pace,
Of Mellor_.tall, and Holdsworth bald, and Bishop dolled up ﬁt,
Of Chambersshort, and Fett the long. Oh!

Lots of things at Pitt.

Said I, “We’ve got a hill that’s called the ‘Mountain Goat’s Delight’,
And, too, there’s our gymnasium that’s truly out of sight;
We’ve. got some Co-ed lassies here who always make a hit,
For Dr. Martin mothers them, and
Lots of things at Pitt.”

The teams we have are, without doubt, the ﬁnest in the land,
Our,Foot—ball Tean1’s invincible, our Base-ball Team is grand.
In Basket-ball, we beat them all, our Track men never quit,——
That’s why we cheer, from year to year, the

Lots of things at Pitt.

Our Senate, too, is on the job. ’tis organized quite ﬁne:
It does ’most everything that’s right. and does it just on time:
The Weekly always prints late news, we read it every hit,

But, though I try, I can’t tell half the

Lots of things at Pitt.

So when a stranger comes to Pitt to View us cap-a—pie,
Let all the tutors “toot” their best, let pupils make reply,
Let not the Weekly weaker grow, let Goat Hill higher sit,
Let’s all show off as best we can. the
Lots of things at'Pitt.

This may be due to his ever-/zresent smile and sunny dis-

$3,000,000 Campaign

HE SUCCESS of the great campaign last January was due
to the organization perfected by Mr. VVard, the Y. M. C. A.’s
official money raiser, the Pittsburgh business men back of
the movement and the great public spirit shown by the
citizens of the city.

Getting money is a hard task, as many of the workers
are no doubt aware, the keynote of success being organization. Under
the able guidance of Mr. VVard an organizaztion was perfected which
did wonders. The business men at the head of the campaign included
such representative men as C. W. Scovel, ’83, VV. 0. Cofﬁn and E. V.
Babcoek, whose pictures we see above, together with Howard Heinz,
D. L. Gillespie, A. R. Hamilton. ’94, and Joseph 0. Trees.

The citizens rallied to their support, the students did their best,
the faculty got out and hustled. and Mr. H. J. Heinz capped the climax
with a Student’s Building. Truly, it was a great time for Old Pitt.

The Co-ed

The Co-ed is the magnet which draws love—lorn lads to Pitt,

She’s popular wherc’er she goes, she’s sure to make a hit.

The Profs ﬁnd soon, they’re not immune from her captivating ways,
They all approve the things she does, believe the things she says.

In College and in School of Ed, she sets a lively pace,

The one who keeps abreast of her, will know he’s in a race,
Psychology, Biology, she masters every one,

Mathematics are a joy to her, Sciences are fun.

In School Activities, you’ll ﬁnd that she will do her level best,

To boost the school’s her golden rnle—she applies it too with zest.
Learns every yell, and cheers like —— well. she goes to every game,
The team may win, the team may lose,—she’s loyal just the same.

In looks,—well we admit that she is there in every way,
No wonder that the sterner sex attends class every day!
With no Co-ed, the class seems dead, the lectures dry and ﬂat,

When she’s in sight, they seem all right. so she's the cause of that.

So knockers all, both short and tall, be wise, take my advice,
Remember that a knock’s a boost, to slam girls is not nice,
That anyone who thinks it fun to knock them. is ill—bred,
Then all who hear, join in and cheer. our charming‘. fair Co—ed.

Left Out

We hoped to utilize this space

To picture here a pretty face-
Some laughing girl with golden hair—
True likeness of a lady fair.

Yet when it came to names, you see,

The editors could not agree;

One swore her name was surely “Betty”—
Another laid a bet on “Hetty.”

But, truth to tell, nobody knows;
The question merely leads to blows.
What pleases Peter angers Paul,
And so she isn’t here at all.

Excelsior 1

[Slightly revised and modernized by “Sid” Hoeh1.]

The rain and snow were falling fast,
As on his way to Gym there passed
A “Fresh” who bore ’mid snow and ice
This word embroidered on his “dicez”
EXCELSIOR!

His lip was cut, his nose was red.

(A Soph had lately punched his head.)
But ’though his face was beat to jelly,
There still appeared upon his “kellyz”

ExcELs1oR!

In State and Thaw he piped the glim

In class—rooms where “zips” awaited him.

Above, the snow cast quite a sheen

Upon that word on Freshie’s “beanz”
EXCELSIOR!

“Try not the path,” the Junior said,

"Unless you’re rummy in the head.

The Gym steps, too, with ice are sleek!”

The “greenie” only shook his “beak :”
ExCELsIoR!

“Oh stay,” the Co—ed said, “and rest

Thy crazy head against my ﬁst!”

Fresh spake, “Fair maid, withdraw thy bid,

And read the sign upon my “lid :”
EXCELSIOR!

“Beware of Goat Hi11’s lofty height,

The Gym is still far out of sight.”

The janitor cautioned with a sob,

That word still blazed on Freshie’s “knob:"
ExcELs1oR!

At length he reached the Dental School,

The Dents yelled forth, “You dog-gone fool,

You'll reach no Gym, you rummy mut,

Despite that word upon your “nut :”
EXCELSIOR!

The Medics thought he sure was cracked,

VVhcn past their school through snow he tracked,

Advised the "boob” to go back home,

Then read the slogan on his “dome :”
Exci:Ls1oR!

Between the Medic School and Gym,
Alas! the last was seen of him.
As if he’d been wiped from the map,
The only relic is his cap:

ExcELsroR!

There in the snow and slush it lay;

A Soph recovered it next day;

’Twas crusted o’er with snow and ice,

But still it bore this strange device:
EXCELSIOR!

A Pilgrim’s Progress

[Being a little afﬂiction found by Peary, tacked to the
North Pole, and now transcribed and edited, with notes
and vocabulary, by VV. Irwin Moyer.]

A Freshman there was, at the portals of fame;
From somewhere ’way out in the country he came.
And he looked it; although it is safe to remark
They are all a bit verdant when ﬁrst they embark
On the perilous trip o’er that troublesome sea
That leads to the land of a college degree.

But with great expectation

Of high elevation
The Freshman thus pondered in deep contemplation:

“Whatever the rules of the game may be here,
It's a cinch I’m not going to wait for a year
Until I begin to make myself heard.

I'm going to start off at the crack of the bat,

To show some of these Sophomores just where they are at.

And I'm going to set such a wonderful pace
In a couple of months I’ll be running the place."

Our great projects, alas, are oft buried in sorrow;
Fond hopes of to-day are but dreams of to—morrow.
The Freshman was caught in a class-ﬁght day raid,
Was locked up in a shed, and that’s where he stayed.
The hero shut out from the scene of the fray
Had hoped for great honor and glory that day.

But with praises unsung,

And with glory unwon,

His great expectation

Brought small consolation,
For the world cares but little for deeds yet undone.

The truth is, as time ﬂew unmercifully by
The Freshman discovered, as you might or I
That Rome wasn’t built in the‘wink of an eye.
And sometimes our high aspirations must fall;
That march to the front is no joke, after all.
Till at last by degrees
He reluctantly sees
To use his expression, “he’s not the whole cheese,”
And admits with a sigh of unhappy regret,
He'll not conquer the world for a year or so yet.

A Sophomore now, with a pipe and mustache
And a constant appeal to his Dad for more cash;
As time has her pages of knowledge unfurled

He think he knows ever so much of the world.

His greatest ambition
Is strict admonition

That the Freshman should learn to respect his condition.
The “Freshie” he treats with paternal affection;
The poor little dear needs somebody’s protection;
Someone to guide his young footsteps aright,
And see that he doesn’t stay out late at night,

Or fuss with the ladies, for such it appears,
Was hardly intended for infantile years.

The Soph is of course as a gentleman classed,

His frivolous childhood forever is passed.

He has joined a Fraternity, “I Eta Pi"

(Got hazed and emerged with deep gloom in one eye.
One night he sat up until past four o'clock,

At strip poker (I mention the word with a shock)
And played until nothing was left but. a sock.

' But such a confession
Is no indiscretion,
That’s part of a S0phomore’s daily profession.

’Tis not till the Junior has made himself known
That modern knighthood can come to its own.

The Junior, the symbol of manly perfection,

The natural leader in every direction,

Energetic and clever, with valor endowed.

He soon takes his place at the head of the crowd.
Our Pilgrim, thus far on his journey progressed
Gets exalted ambitions as well as the rest;

Goes out for Athletics, in Football and Track,

And soon wins renown as the star quarter—back.

I presume we have all hoped forsimilar fame
With some honor or other to hang to our name.
Though it may not be pleasant to roll in the dirt,
And besides, you are likely enough to get hurt.

Such objections as these
Disappear in the breeze
When you think of the letter you’ll wear on your shirt.

But now there arises a grave complication,

A question involved with profound perturbation;

He looks at his watch. but it's not at the face,

Oh, be still, ﬂuttering heart! There's a girl in the case!
A cardiac inﬂation,
Peculiar sensation,

Accompanied by frequent severe palpitation.

He becomes quite romantic; writes poetry too,
About moonlight and boat—rides, and benches for two.
In such a condition, you’ll ﬁnd as a rule
His principal aim is to get through with school.
And he tries to commence
Application intense,
Until cruel disillusion
Makes painful intrusion
And ethereal fancies begin to condense,
Like clouds in the sky,
Sailing peacefully by,
And thus endeth the tale of his first great offense.

At last now the time of the harvest arrives;

The Senior, sedate, philosophic, and wise;

With broadness of mind and with fullness of heart,

What a change from the Freshman you saw at the start!
For the signs of advance
One can tell at a glance,

Time will do some great things if you give it a chance.

“Let truth be a vantage ground, whence to behold

The lost Eldorado, the City of Gold;

And this kind won’t tarnish so quickly, I’m told,"

The Pilgrim remarked as I watched him away.

He told me some other things, too, by the way,

One was, I remember, that “Whoever shares

The fresh air on the roof must first climb the stairs.”
What more he confessed
Must remain unexpressed,

I'll leave Johnny Bunyan to tell you the rest.

Why Is an Owl?

N OWL is the personiﬁcation of Silence; that is, Wisdom.

One who stays o11t late at night is said to be an Owl.

These two statements are similar only in so far as they relate
to the same bird.

Silence is Golden. Silence is more than Golden; Silence is
VVisdom.

VVe are in an age of talk. We discuss subjects whether we know the
facts of the case or not.

We are in an age of snap judgments. We jump to a conclusion and
learn the facts afterwards, usually to our embarrassment.

VVe are in an age of learning. A larger percentage of the American
people are seeking knowledge through the medium of good schools than
ever before.

We, as a people, believe in education.

Education does not necessarily mean college training. Education is
the abundance of knowledge, useful knowledge, combined with Under-
standing; alias, horse sense.

A good mechanic has a better education than a poor doctor.

Knowledge and Education are related, but not the same.

Men with education are few. They are in great demand the world
over. They are the men who do things worth while. The world is made
better by their endeavors—regardless of their ﬁelds of activity.

Many men with Knowledge are hunting positions. They have
Knowledge but they are not Educated. They are like the merchant with
a large stock of merchandise but without. ability to make sales.

Wisdom is the proper use of Knowledge. Wisdom and Education
thereby become anonymous.

Let us seek Knowledge. That should be our object while at College.

Let us combine Knowledge and Understanding, and thereby obtain
an Education. This will surely bring Success.

A man with Wisdom is silent. He does not tell ‘all that he knows; he
is too busy getting an Education.

Naturalists tell us that the Owl is a silly old bird, but he has gained
the reputation for Wisdom through Silence.

HERE’S TO THE OWL!

Being Rushed

[As Related by Peggy Smythe.]

AS I ever rushed by a Sorority? Say, rushed isn't the right
term. They had me on the gallop and panting for breath.
I wouldn‘t wa11t to take -.1 chance on another experience like
that. But, say, 1 had better begin at the beginning so you
can get me straight.
You know ever si11ce Uncle picked up all that coi11 in
Coal last year, he has bee11 crazy to have 1ne get. an education. Ke kept
arguing with me and, at last, I just had to give in, throw up my job down
at the store, turn my back on the ribbon counter and promise to be a
perfect lady a11d go to College. It seems Uncle had given some University
a Antiferisticranis, or something like that, and he could get me in with-
out trouble.

Geel I’ll never forget my ﬁrst day at Pitt—for that’s where he sent
me. I though some of the Professors were real dears, but the girls——
bless you—w‘hy, they thought the whole idea of life was digging dope out
of those school books. Why, do you know that a whole l-ot of them were
at year behind in style and wore their hair straight back instead of over
their ears and didn’t even know the first step of the tango or the Castle
Walk—why, the half of them were not even living. '

Oh, yes, they treated me cool enough. Guess they thought I Wasn’t
in their class, too crude or something. But I could see alright that they
were crazy about the way I wore my hair and the drag I had with the
boys and the way that I could dance. llut after I was made President
of the Society for the Development f-o1- liackward Young Men, and elected
Representative of the Equal I<‘r-ancliise Society, my stock began to boom
a11d I soon had theineatillg from 1ny hand. So I really was not so very
1nucl1 surprised when one day Ellen Fish who is one of the big bugs in the
Biddies Sorority came up and put her arm around my waist and after a.
few preliminary remarks, says, “Peggy, how would you like to join our
Sorority?”

“What is them things?” I asks.

“VVhy,” she says, “it's like being a sister and—”

“xix, nothing doing," I says. “No convents or nun’s veiling in
mine.”

“But,” says Ellen, “you don‘t seem to understand. This isn’t a
‘Little Sisters of the Poor’ stunt. It‘s just a crowd of girls who are all
fron1 school and who agree to stick by each other just like sisters. If
you belong, you would be a sister to me.”

“Got any brothers?” I asks.

“Yes,” she replied, kind of puzzled.

“Good looking and not afraid to spend some coin?”

“Yes,” says she.

“Alright,” I says, “I‘l1 be your sister. Trot out these brothers of
yours so we can look them over.”

“Oh, Peggy,” she says, “that isn’t our idea. Our plan is to have a.
congenial bunch of girls who will aid each other, lend things, keep the
other girls in their places, prevent the Profs from brow—be~-ating us, en-
courage the boys, and see that we get our rights.”

“I think I get you,” I says. “It’s a kind of a Union like we had
down at the store to prevent somebody beati-ng our time. What’s the
dues?”

“Suppose you come 11p to house for supper to-night, and you can
meet the girls and see what kind of a jolly time we have,” Ellen says,
kind of discouraged like.

“I’m on,” says I, “I’ll be there with bells on.”

It was considerably later in the afternoon, just as I was getting
ready to go home and dress for the eats, that Hazel Heifer who is a
shining light in the Pie-faces Sorority came rushing 11p to me and with-
out hesitation asks, “\Vhere are you going to-night, Peg? Got a date?”

“Bet your life," I says. “You never saw me lay out a dull evening
for myself studying. I am going over to Biddies for eats.”

“Don’t do it,” she says earnestly. “You won’t have a bit of a good
time. They are a poor crowd. And ‘this is Friday night! They always
have beans and beans only Friday night for supper.” I

“Gee!” I says. “Beans and I don‘t like each other a little bit. I’m
sorry I ever agreed to go.”

“Call Ellen up,” says Hazel, “and tell her you can’t come. Come
over to our house instead. We are going to have chicken and ice cream
and lots else. The Pie-faces can sure show you a good time.”

“I believe I will,” I says, and beats it off to call Ellen.

“Hello, Ellen,” says 1. “Sorry, old girl, but I can’t get up for the
eats tonight. Beastly headache and a. little imligestion. I guess it’s bed
a11d a hot water bottle for me alright.”

‘Blindness of Virtue’ a11d thought l had queered myself good a11d proper.

“No, We used to have beans on Friday night but we cut. that out long
ago. Say, who put you next to that?” she asks suspiciously.

“Oh, I was talking to Hazel Hetter and she happened to mention
that you girls always have beans on Friday night. But say, listen, I feel
better now and I do want to see the ‘Blindness of Virtue’—I believe I
will come over after all for the eats. Maybe the company will brighten
1ne 11p and make 1ne forget this beastly headache.”

“Sure, come,” says Ellen. “But just you wait until I get a hold of
that tW-0—faced Hazel Heifer. So that's her game, is it? \Vell, 1 a1n glad
that you didn’t let her persuade yo11 to go to the Pie-face house for
supper. You sure wouldn’t have gotten even beans there.”

I tried to get Hazel on the phone but couldn’t raise her, and so I
sent a note telling her I could not break the date and besides the Biddies
were going t-o take 1ne to see the “Blindness of \'irtue.”

I was received at the Biddies’ house with as much \velco1ne as an
allowance from home and found the girls an awfully jolly crowd. The
eats were swell, and well, you know how fond I am of chocolate cake-
well, I had three slices. Even-ytlling was, Oh, so good, and there wasn’t
ever a suggestion of beans. I showed all the girls l1ow to arrange their
hair over their ears in the latest style, showed them my tango sash and

hesitation stockings. VVe danced a11d sang a11d I showed them all the ,

newest steps—The (‘an of \Vorn1s and the Horse Trot, and Oh, just all
the latest ones. ‘

stopped in front of us and says, “Come on, girls, get in. We’ll go for a
joy ride.”

“Nothing doing, kid,” says I, “we’re going to a show.”

“Hop in anyhow, says Herb, “I’ll drop you at the theatre. Im going
in town and you can go" in along.”

That listened good to us and so I got in beside Herb and Ellen and
Pat and Beth Mcswiggle climbed into the tonnage. We were just about
half way in town on the Grant Boulevard when suddenly with an awful
explosion, the engine stopped.

“My heart,” gasps Pat, “What’s happened? I guess this means we
stick around long enough to miss the show. Always our luck.”

Herb was down under the machine hammering away at something,
and I was humming “He had to get under,” which didn’t seem to im-
prove Herb’s disposition one bit. Finally he told the other girls they
would have to get out so he could ﬁx the differential or something. They
got out and Herb climbed in beside me, and, bless my heart, before I
knew it, he has turned on the power and we were speeding away leaving
Pat, Beth, and Ellen standing open—mout.hed with surprise in the middle

of the road, shouting frantically after us. Of course, I was furious.
I “Herb Litle,” I says, “are you plumb crazy? Turn back immediately

and get those girls. Why what on earth do you mean?” .

But» ‘Herb only laughed and seemed to take it as a huge joke; and
assured me that I would thank him later for what he was doing. He
ended up by saying that he intended to kidnap.me. .

I saw I had to make the best of a bad job and wasn’t going to let
him see I wasn’t game, so I merely says, “Well, I should worry. I’m a
bear on joy rides. Show me some speed.”

And, believe me, he did; and I had lots of fun but had trouble
making Herb behave. And I was just beginning to enjoy myself when
all of a ‘sudden Herb stopped the machine in front. of a house in Craig
Street.

I barely had time to adjust. my hair and put a dab of powder on my
nose (Herb is such an unruly boy) before the door openediand I was
carried into the house by a bunch of girls.

“VVhat’s the idea,” I asks as soon as I can get my breath, “I don’t
owe you nothing.”

The girls all crowded around me, assuring me that I was among;
friends at the Pie-face House. Agnes Wells and Hazel Heffer said it was-

all a good joke on the Biddies and that, if I wanted they wouldtake me
to see the “Blindness of Virtue” the next evening. H W’ ell, I didn’t think it
\Vas such a swell joke on the Biddies but what could I do? I saw I would
have to stick and make the best of matters. I really hadI1’t got my bear-
ings or learned the part I was to play before there was an awful rumpus
outside and in a minute the door bell rang and Hazel, who had run to
the window, shouts, “Hey, Peg, duck behind the divan. There is a bunch
of those Biddies at the door. Don’t let them get next to you.”

I knew that it would be awfully embarassing for the Biddies to ﬁnd
me at the Pie-face House, so I took the chance and did the fade-away
stunt behind the divan. I listened in amazement to Hazel telling the
Biddies that she didn’t know where I was, hadn’t even laid eyes on me
for a week. Agnes said that the last time she saw me, I was just pack-
ing my grip to go to my grandmother’s funeral. (You know my grand-
mother has been dead ten years.)

I know I ought. to be ashamed of it but I just couldn’t help it. When I

more than half of what they said, but that was plenty. But after every-
body had had their innings and while they were getting their second
wind, Ellen arose to the occasion and with the air of a judge, said: “Well,
girls, there is only one persons to decide which Sorority Peg will join
and that is Peg herself. We have both played our hands and it’s a show-
down now. VVe’ll settle this matter right away. Peg, which Sorority
will you join——the Pie—faces or the Biddies?” ,
“What do you mean, joint a Sorority?” I asks. “Is that why I have
been made the goat and been pestered so?”
“Sure,” shouts everybody. “What did you think we were doing?
Showing you a good time? Nix on that stuff.”
“Well,” I replies, “if I had known that sooner, I could have saved
you all this trouble. I can’t join a.ny Sorority. My religion won’t let me.”

Advice to the Lovelorn

By Lizzie Marr Tinn.

Dear Lizzie: I expected to attend the Co-ed dance at the gym last Monday
night but my escort did not call for me and so I had to remain at home. I later
learned that my intended escort attended the dance unaccompanied and expressed
surprize that I had not “shown up yet.” What is your opinion of this occurrence?
How high should the slit in a slit-skirt be slit?

TANGO SALLY.

I can easily sympathize with you in your predicament inasmuch as the same
thing happened to me at one time. The next time, choose a gentleman instead of an
Engineering student as your escort. Slit the slit in a slit-skirt a little above two feet.

Dear Lizzie: I am one of the choice sixty-ﬁve who ﬂunked in “Bugology.” Why
I was ﬂunked I do not know for I attended at least two quizzes during the term.
Please write me your opinion on this matter? '

TOMMY SOFFOMORE.

I fear, Tommy, that you are not on the job. I‘ have heard that you are a regular
“cut-up” in Laboratory. Don't loaf. It gets you no dough. It is the best policy
to behave while at Pitt, get your lessons and make a hit, so they won't give you the
mitt, and quickly tell you to beat it.

Dear Lizzie: Oh, I am in the worst trouble and I need you to help me. Harry
has asked me to go to the Junior Prom and here I have become so rotund that I
cannot squeeze into my evening—gown. Dear Lizzie, what in the world shall I do?

DESPERATE.

My poor unfortunate girl, yours is a sad plight but can be easily remedied. Eat
nothing for two weeks and I am sure that your surplus avoirdupois will disappear
amazingly. But if this method does not prove effective and you are still unable to
squeeze into your dress try a soavped shoe-horn. .

Dear Lizzie: I have been coming to Pitt for the last three months but‘ have
never had occasion to ask your assistance but now I am in trouble. I have a Trig
exam next Friday and if you do not tell me how to pass it, I will sing my “swan song”
sure. Why do they call it “Thaw Hall”?

BILLY FRESH.

The best way to pass your Trig exam is to take it slow—solve your angles by
degrees. I cannot say why they call it “Thaw Hall”—the Profs there usually deal
out nothing but zero.

Dear Lizzie: Kindly tell me how I can make the boy who sits behind me in
French stop giggling during class? How can I get rid of freckles? Kindly inform
me of a good way to entertain a large party. , ETHEL.

Dear Ethel, let the boy in French class see your face. For the removal of freckles,

try dynamite. If the large party does not weigh more than two hundred pounds,
‘entertain him in the hammock.

Dear Lizzie: I am going to the College Banquet next Wednesday with “Boots"
Riehl. Never having been out for dinner before, I would like to get some informa-
tion on how to act. How should I wear my hair? What color dress would be appro-
priate? Kindly tell me whether it is proper to hold p-ie in your hand when eating
it or should one use a spoon? TROUBLED.

Your ignorance is most astonishing for a Freshman College girl and I feel very
sorry for your poor escort. A very attractive way to wear the hair is to pin it over
the ears with safety pins. A crimson dress with a long maroon sash would be very
becoming. My dear child, pie is neither eaten with the ﬁst nor with a spoon. A knife,
not sharp enough to cut the mouth, is the proper implement.

Dear Lizzie: It is quite shocking, the trouble I have with Electricity. It seems
to go right through me. What shall I do 3 JUNIOR E. E.

You apparently worry too much over this subject. With Electricity, make light
of it, make light of it.

Dear Lizzie: I am a Freshman in Doctor Chamber’: Home for the Hopeless.
How long should I wear my dresses? I am in love with a cross-eyed Sophomore
who plays the mandolin but is quite rational otherwise. However, he seems indiﬁerent
to my attentions and seldom looks at me. Kindly tell me how I can gain his affec-
tions. How do you like my writing? MABEL.

Never mind, dearie, Dr. Chamber's probably regrets your presence as much as
you do. Wear your dresses as long as there's any one in sight. Write poetry to
your cross-eyed friend and I am sure that he will become quite arduous. Your writing
is almost legible.

T IS the earnest hope of the OWL BOARD that nothing in this
book will cause hard feelings among the students. Student
writeups at their best are poor reading, and, if we have in-
serted too much spice in some of them, we want to assure
the oﬁended parties (for there will be a few) that all has
been said in jest and without malice.

We want to thank the student body for their loyal support, without
which the book would have been a complete failure.

It would be impossible to mention all of those who have helped us
with valuable advice and loyal labor, but we wish to acknowledge par-
ticularly the loyal co-operation of—

"‘Paynie” is the name he goes by here, but
he is not as transparent as his name suggests.

RONALD M. REID, «I42,

HOWARD C. RINK, ‘lift, Hoboken, Pa.

Millvale High School.
Grove City College.
Athletic Committee, 1913.
Junior Class President.

One of our deservedly popular members of

rather borrow than return." His favorite song
is, “I’d rather live in Homestead than in
Heaven,” the last -verse» of which we er/iect to

DAMASO RAMON RIVERA, Am,

FRED RILEY SMITH, 11/9, Brilliant, Ohio.

New Castle High School.
Baseball, '12, ’13.

This is the man that gave the name to his
home town and as an artistic operator Fred
surely shines. — Through the influence brought
to bear‘ by a certain Queen he has been induced
to cut all his bad habits and is now a model
young man.

GEORGE ATEN SMITH, JR., ‘M2,
New Wilmington, Pa.

A worthy example of the old adage, "‘S_till
water runs deep.” His conﬁdence gained, and
his observing love of nature may be appre-
ciated.

STEPHEN M. SPEERS, qza, Speers, Pa.

Charleroi High School.
California Normal School.

A direct descendant of the founder of his
native city. An interested reader of Mexico's
troubles and sh! he even goes so far as to
declare himself a sutfragist. Yea he is a war-
rior, a militant suffragist. And yet with all
this, a splendid fellow.

Lyda, the loyal snake from I/V. Va., con— ‘

tinues to be the good student for which he has
been noted during the [last two years. He is
fond of coasting, but does not enjoy the least
bit a taxicab ride in the snow.

WALTER GARDNER SUTTON, AEA,
Pleasantville, Pa.

Sutton is one of the unfortunate members of
the class. In his great desire to obtain knowl-
edge he slipfred and broke his leg, which laid
him up for six weeks, but industry and applica-
tion being his hobby, he cannot fail to make,
good.

WILLIAM M. WALLACE, ~14),

pared only to the wit of Marie Twain and
Elbert Hubbard.

EDGAR WAYNE WALFORD, «Ira,

“Wolly," alias “Cotton,” is one of our shin-

EARL F. B. CAMPBELL, AZA, New Kensington, Pa.

New Kensington High School.
University of Michigan.
Class Baseball and Basket Ball.

Likes New Kensington so well that he goes home every
year or two. Rooms with “Talley Taylor.” Sits in Asylum
Row. Is it any wonder that he is a squirrel? Champion
lightweight rough-house artist and wears a latest style
derby on all occasions.

EARL CONLIN, ‘PS2, Duquesne, Pa.

Duquesne High School.
Penn. State.

“Ziggy” is known as the “Duke from Duquesne.” At
dissection he dons his gown and rubber gloves, loads up
lzis pipe and “Knifes" the “stiff” like a friend. An acconi-
plished pianist, an all-around good fellow, but must be
handled carefully—brealrs a pair of glasses a week.

WILLIAM ANDREW DUNN, Chester, W. Va.

Irondale High School.
Varsity Football, '12.

Familiarly known as “Mother” Dunn. Heavyweight of
the class. Shines in chemistry. Peaceful as a lamb until
aroused—then scatter every one. Keeps the two-bit
bleachers at Forbes Field and the peanut heaven at the
Grand crowded. '

MALDEN JAMES FAST, AZA, Fairchance, Pa.

Fairchance High School.
Uniontown High School.

Though very well behaved generally, becomes at times
quite crude in his discourse. Not long ago a mistake was
his sad fate in the manipulation of his lab. work. Malden,
forgetting his propriety. was heard to utter these uncouth
words, “I don't give a Kitty.” Slioc/ring!

66

ROBERT BROWN FISHER, ‘I'D, Greensburg, Pa.

Greensburg High School.

The savior of the class via the N. G. P. route. The
jingo, “Necessity is the mother of invention,” is never
more potent than in our hero. If in need of a new kind
of bucket, go to Bob. We would say more, but we haven’t
the heart.

HYMAN ABRAHAM FRANK, New Castle, Pa.

New Castle High School.
Student Band.
Menorah.

Known as “Peroxide” last year on account of his desire
to sterilize his fact which was cut during the freshman
activities. Has stood quite a lot of kidding since being
among us, but is fast becoming quite a favorite among
his classmates. His smile, that is the thing. ’

JAMES HOWARD FREW, AEA, <I=A, Grove City, Pa.

Grove City High School.

Reared on the farm. Manifested his dental tendencies
by extracting via the “door lznob and piece of string"
methods. Leans toward the female of the s/>ccies, although
we have yet to see him with a “birdie.” Yes, James is
rather shy.

G. E. GETTY, Meyersdau, Pa.

Meyersdau High School.

Owns the only 80-day shirt in captivity. Objects to
entering the Inﬁrmary, because he will have to don a white
collar and a barber's jacket. Insists that the action of
water and sulphuric acid are the same. Senior member
of the only successful business firm in the class.

BEN. F. GLASS, ‘I/(2, New Castle, Pa.

Baltimore Medical College.

“Don't hit him.” Coming in from another school, Ben.
has not been long in winning the goodwill and friendship
of the Junior class. Baltimore lost a good man when he
cast his lot with us. However, the old town will still be
noted for oysters.

ALFRED LOGAN GREGORY, ABA, E<I>E,
East Palestine, Ohio.

Ohio Northern.

The second leg in the chair of Anatomy, and is kept
busy ﬁxing tliings after Meisel has “done” them. Thinks
Pitt would haze a better school if it were moved to Ohio.
Changes his boarding house every other -week trying to
dodge hard lnek.

ROBERT LYSLE GRIFFITH, W9, Homestead, Pa.

East Liberty Academy.

"Quarter-l'aclced" at E. L. A. with great success. Known
around school as “Gentleman Bob." Can be seen any after-
"oon in the halls handing out left jobs and right hooles to
his classmates. A “Bean Brnmmel” in dress but-—-—
“Loolr out for dat fella.”

JAMES W. HAMMOND, AZA, Ford City, Pa.

Ford City High School.

Very strong for the fair sex as e7/idenred by the fact
that he can't stay from Ford City. Has a habit of visiting
the theaters weekly and enjoying the gay life generally.
Talees sudden notions and always carries them out, good
or bad.

68

CLARENCES. HARRIS, ‘I19, Verona, Pa.

Verona High School.
Grove City Academy.
Pittsburgh Academy.

When we think of Harris, we think of his violin and
the sweet music they make. His services as a violinist are
so much in demand that we seldom see him except at ex-
amination times. We like him, we like his violin, they
must share honors.

B. L. HERRON, ‘PS2, Monessen, Pa.

Monessen High School.
Notre Dame.

Barney was shot by an arrow from Cupid’s bow last
summer and Mrs. Herron now directs his “goings out”
and “comings in.” It takes nerve, fellows, but it is a cinch
after you get domesticated. Go-v. Tener and he are great
pals; he helped elect the governor, don't you know.

EDWARD C. HILGER, ‘I42, Pittsburgh, Pa.

Pittsburgh High School.
Carnegie Technical Schools.

“Eddie” is a precocious child. In his freshman year he
was subject to hysteria, especially when someone inislaid
a piece of his prosthetic work. Likes to tango with
“Tubby” Sanderson. Faz'orite expression: “Maybe you
think that don’t hoit me.”

JOHN THOMAS KEISER, AEA, Mars, Pa.

Mars High School.

“All for the ladies,” as Sam Bernard would put it. Tom .

strongly endorses the girlsof the North Side. Is great
for fussing, and is quite successful at the vocation. Some-
times becomes so elated that he nses the school telephone
all afternoon. No, we think it chronic.

 

69

ROY H. KERNOHAN, AA, Homestead, Pa.

Homestead High School.
Glee Club, ’13.
Football.

When he enrolls in the fall, broneed with the sun of
the training earnp, the girls floclc around and Kerny smiles.
All through the year the girls continue to floele and Kerny
continues to smile. Has taken up singing lately, but we
still think him handsome.

RUSSEL HARRISON KIRK, ~IIﬂ, Pittsburgh, Pa.

Pittsburgh High School.
Student Band.
Glee Club.

Kirk is the proud possessor of a rich basso /irofundo
voice wlzieh he has cultivated to a high degree by the
selling of cabbage in Knoxville. He is also one of the
boss tooters in the band and is right there with his little
toot at every game and parade.

HANNA KLOETZER, Asch, Bohemia, Austria.

“Our Lad_v"' came to us from the Land of _Bol1eInia, and
since becoming acquainted has been laefrt busy presiding
at afternoon tea /iarties and settling rlisbutes among her
“altena'ants" in laboratory. I3“L'e/iv fellow in the class is
at her eorimand. You bet we believe in Co—educati:)n.

FRANK RAYMOND LEIGHNER, AEA, Mars, Pa.
Mars High School.

Although in his Junior year, there is not a rnernber of
the faculty who does not need a lesson in pronunciation
everv time his name is called. In fact, Thomas Keiser is
the onlv man so for who has been able (0 intelligently [wro-
nomzce the rognoznen.

CARTER HAMILTON LEWIS, Pittsburgh, Pa.
South Side High School.

Steve Lewis—Comedian, Hero and Heart Smasher. His
wit is genuine and comes out une.rpectedly. Recently he
saved a “little girl” from death by snatching her from
under the wheels of a street car. Phone messages may
become too numerous, even to a hero.

SAMUEL LICHTER, Pittsburgh, Pa.
Pittsburgh High School. '

Jumped into notoriety last fall by inciting a race riot
with the freshmen but, in due respect to him, we must
admit that he was not in the least subdued by having a
dozen freshies clutching at his throat. He was 7/ictor. His
temper is quite normal now.

WALTER DUNCAN LOVE, Falls Creek, Pa.

Falls Creek High School.
Grove City College.
Student Band.

Student Senate.

As a freshie, Love shone as our fullback and in basket
ball, until he pushed his knee through the gym ﬂoor.
“Dunc” plays a cornet in the band. His moonlight con-
certs on the hill above the school draw great crowds to
the boarding house. There's a girl, but we don't know her.

J. CAREY MARSH, New Bethlehem, Pa.

Canisius College.
Medico Chiruglcal College.

As an entertainer, Marsh can keep the whole class in an
uproar without apparent effort on his part. As a trainer
for our class football team last fall, he aided us much by
getting the men in physical condition. Acquired his ath-
letic abilities across the Rio Grande.

WILLIAM HILGER MCKINLEY, Ml, Pittsburgh, Pa.

East Liberty Academy.

One time he was standing on the st.-2/vs at sehaol inur-
inuring against particifrating in a certain Uni~versity parade
when the Dean, o-z/erhearing his remarks, turned and
handed him the school ensign, saying, "Here, McKinley,
carry the banner." Loud a/2/vlanse by :he student body.

HARRY CAMERON METZ, ~14), <I>A9.
Williamsburg, Pa.

East Liberty Academy. Class President.
President Junlor Class. Student Senate.
Washington and Jefferson College.

One of the busiest bodies around school. We believe
that he could graduate in a year, set up in [>ractiee, get
married and retire. if they could only arrange a course to
heel» up with him. Being an old college man. he is also
very />0/vular with the gentle sex. One of the bright lights
in dentist/'1' and-

EMANUEL GEORGE MEISEL, AEA,
Carrolltown, Pa.
Dental Owl Manager.
Student Senate.

Dr. McCu1'(lv’s first assistant in the dissecting room and
nmlrcs all the freshmen call him Doctor. Rooms with
“Dutch” O7'erl>cr,-zer and (ll?S01‘l).S‘ enough lmo'wlerl_.r;'e to
lead the class. At one time taught school and says it is
hard to get down toworlc again. The class .-igrces that he
is some rolleetor.

ABEY SABOSKY NEWELL, Ml, Monongahela, Pa.

East Liberty Academy.

The best hearted fellow in the school. Has a train ride’

every day with his “intended,” who also comes to the city
riailv. It is not nnconznion to see /lhev seated at her side
in the train and slee/vine soundly. Most /'/1‘0l)(ll7l_';' needs the
rest after long hours of study. He /vlerrds an alibi.

LOUIS HARMAN NICHOLS, Bridgetown, Barba-
does, B. W. I.

' Combermere School.

Has the nza/cilzgs of a first rate lawyer, but this talent
will come in handy in the practice of dentistry. The kind
that puts t/mzgs over, as it were, even thong]: he had to kill
the whole bum‘/I of freshies to gain his point.

PLUMMER ORVILLE NIXON! \IIS2, Edmin, Pa.

Kiskiminetas Springs School.
Grove City College.

I/Ve believe “Nick” has a girl hid away somewhere as he
is never 7C‘llll'11r§' to discuss his female attitude. His first
name does not in any 7('(1_\' indimte his a/7/>earan('e or (Il7ll1-
ties. The way he handles dental instruments indicates a
bright future for him as an 0/veralar. Another prosthetic
e.r/vert. ~

CHARLES E. OVERBERGER, Patton, Pa

Patton High School.

Smnetintes ca/led “Dut(h." Has a deﬁnite of>im'on on
every subject and lets e7/'er'yl7o<ly know it. W0/'1d’s cham-

/5oint.dHas a habit of saying, “Keep ‘em off, L(>7‘c_v," when

LORAINE LEON PAINTER, ASA, Grafton, W. Va.

Grafton‘ High School.

“Pete” i/weztted a new 'Z('(lN of />r0z'ing that nmni/>5 are
contagious ‘when he leaned from an open window to talk
to the girl next door. Insists, nay, affirms that snalees are
not native to his hart of W. Va. Rooms with Preiss, but
a'oes/1'! /.’/10:0 it. Great in />l1_\'siology.

73

GLENN WILBER PEIFFER, AEA, DuBois, Pa.

Du Bois High School.
Class Football. '

“Pie” has had a full tzUo—year course in “Love,” but
doesn't show any ill effects now, even though he became
badly poisoned once and at another time tell an easy victim
to tlze mum/vs. Des/vite his name, never seems to get a
look-in at Barney Herron's daily cargo of a hungry
student’s best friend.

LESTER LEWIS PREISS, AEA, Grafton, W. Va.

Grafton High School.
Cap and Gown.

Sometimes called Lester and sometimes Rosy because-

'tc'ell not because his chee/es are red. Has never satisfac-

torily e,r[>lained why he went home every two weeks during
his freshman year, but cannot be dragged out of Oakland
now. Painter says he saw him with Her, but Rosy submits
an alibi.

RAYMOND J. ROBISON, ASA, New Castle, Pa.
New Castle High School.

Bobby has two faults: Girls and singing popular songs
to his own music (?’3. Only strong will power on the part
of the class has saved him from an early demise or the
class from Dixmont. After trips to Meadville he is very
ligltt hearted. No, we haw been unable to learn her name.

MONT SANDERSON, «I/(2, Butler, Pa.

Butler High School.
Glee Club.
Junior Prom. Committee.

“Tubby,” the cute little fat boy -who carries the banner
in the _harade. His desire to harninni':e with the Vulczmite
Quartette, together with the dechtmations of his “down-
town do/we" and his continuous tangoinj occn/vy all of his
time. The inspiration for the “lSl:inny Shanrr“ pictures
in “The Sim."

Tartntum High School.

lllarried! Not quite, but the dear boy is eoiitinually
chanting: “Would that she were here.” Yes, he is a spe-
cialist in the field of matrimony, but why she must go to
Florida every year and leave poor Claude alone and lone-
some, I do not know. Ofﬁees at two of the downtown
theaters; has probably opened a third before now.

HORACE CLAYTON SCOTT, \IIS2, Wilkinsburg, Pa.

East Liberty Academy.
Glee Club.
Dental Owl Editor.

Songster of the Songsters, our own dear little Horace.
Dental school is now a paradise (lost) as strains with a
metallic luster are constantly oozing from the students’
room. Here may be found the “dentieal" qnartette, selected
from the four corners, being lead to lofty heigh-‘s of melody’
by our beloved Seotty.

LEO SHONFIELD, Mansﬁeld, Ohio.

Mansﬁeld High School.
Zanesﬁeld High School.
Cap and Gown Club.

Although he insisted upon taking the Juniors to the
theater in our freshman year and was unanimously de-
nounced as a traitor, he lzas won his way into our hearts
as a good fellow. The only thing that can hee/7 Leo from
being a good dentist is the high price of gold.

“Red” has a good “erew" in the laboratory and can be
seen at his desk directing his assistants almost daily. A
clean cha/I who by hard work and dogged determination at
his position of Guard on the Varsity has gained the res/zeet

LISLE SPEEDY, AZA, Indiana, Pa.

Elderton Academy.

When Speedy left Indiana the girls‘ dormitory was
draped in mourning. He still has a weakness along that
line. A quiet, black-eyed individual who is '.vor/ling hard
to get his sheefwslein. When that time comes, you girls ub
in Indiana—“Look out!”

HOWARD DE WOODY TAYLOR, AEA,

Emlenton High School.

Wonder if the middle name has reference to his head?
1: little, but makes more noise and fuss than a steam

Wallace has charge of the track house. May the clever
manner in which he handles a dental instrument comﬁensate
for his culinary abilities. The men in the track house have
our earnest felicitations. Beats a mandolin most cleverly
and thereby drives dull care from off the hill.

GEORGE w. WIELAND, 112., M2, Scranton, Pa. .

Jolly, good natured and carefree, he basses ‘rt.-and among
the boys and is always in everything. Many an anilvitious
student has been lured away from afternoon classes by him,
but next year when he joins the “7c.rhite coat brigade” we
look for a change. “Isn’t he handsome?”

Here we have a true college chap. Can be seen every
evening on the fair slopes of Allegheny with a damsel
tucked under his arm. Ofﬁcial purveyor of pies at noon
hour to their Majesties, The Bunch. We predict that he
will have a large female practice in after years .-if he persists
in his charming ways.

KARL F. WELLER, AZA, McKeesport, Pa. i

McKeesport High School.

His war cries: “Match you a nickel” and “Safety First.”
Quit railroading on the Manon. Connecting R. R. to take

bridge across the river. Has a better dentriﬁce than chew-
ing gum and is willing to demonstrate its use at any time.

ALFRED CLYDE YOUNG, ASA, Wilkinsburg, Pa.

Wilkinsburg High School.
Glee Club.

His baritone voice is very much missed in the Glee Club
this year. Found it necessary to devote more time to
dentistry and women. lVe are unable to re/>(,.-rt on the
progress in the latter activity, but he is making good in
the former. We believe he is Smith’s chief assistant in
fvrothesis and dental ethics.

FREDERICK FEINER WARD, W9, Beaver Falls, Pa.

New Kc-nsington High School.

Although a star on the football gridiro/z, his‘ work in

known as "'Runt."’ The name certainly doesn’t apply to his
mental makeup and it takes no pro_Ivh.et to say that George
will certainly be heard of and from.

East Liberty Academy. Chairman Junior Prom.
Glee Club. Atsistant Manager Football, 11.13.

When he once starts something you can depend on its
being ﬁnished and finished well. Grose never treads on
peo[rle’s toes unnecessarily, and so has everybody’s respect
and the warm friendship of most of his classmates. He
never startles the profs, but he knows what he is talking
about when he does say something.

Chief Engineer, Fireman and I/Vhistle Blower of the
-zuorld-fantous lieonomics Steam Roller. Rov will also

be found among the Seniors. Why? He gets 25 Sociology
Credits 0 year by teaclting Soho ( .7) Settlement kids how
to swim. Soft, eh? “Keitz” is one of the best liked fellows
Ill school; wants to‘l>e a lawyer, and if he doesn’t make a
good onc—-‘there ain’t no such thing.”

HERMAN KLINE, <I>21I, Boston, Mass.

Was blown higher than anyone else when the last
'Boml7" came out, and ran around looking for victims with
blood in his eye. Is a staunch worker in the Manura
Society and was born under the sign of Taurus, the Bull.
Is very [*0/rulor with the chosen ,heo/vle and even'we are
gettlzzg used to hint. Gets 07‘? a pretty keen t‘(’ItLtl."l»’ every

WALTER JOSEPH LACEY, Pittsburgh, Pa.

Pittsburgh High School.
Business Manager, 1915 Owl.
Civic Club.

Press Club.

One of the fellows that does the school credit and is
largely resfvonsible for the success of this “Owl.” Although
he has spent three years in the School of Economics he
never says anything unless he has something to say. Lacey
is a hard worker in every line he goes into and has the
teshect of faculty and students.

GUSTAVE ADOLPH DAUB, EAE, Pittsburgh, Pa.

Pittsburgh High School.
Economics Quartet.
Glee Club.

Here we have one of the few fellows who is liked by
everybody for his good nature, happy smile, and fine voice.
Gus. divides his time between counting the other fellow’:
monev at the Oakland Trust Co. and singing in dulcet
tones to entranced audiences. One of the troubles about
graduation is that we won’t see Gus. Laub so often after
it happens.

ROBERT MILO MAC ANULTY, EX, Pittsburgh, Pa.

Would like to have a college without anv recitations.
but goes more than he used to. Mac is a real artist on the
waxed floor and we understand he could give a lecture on
Real Estate with some of the inside do/>e just like they
have at Economics /lssemblv. He went once, but the subject
was not Real Estate.

JAMES PAUL MILLER, <1>Z<l5, Ben Avon, Pa.

Athletic Representative School of Economics.
Bellefonte Academy.

One of the most popular men in the School of Economics.
Was elected Athletic Re/>resentati7.'e because it was gen-
erallv felt he was what Doc. Holdsworth describes as "a
enod consermtitre man:"' he has been living up to e.r[7ecta-
tions. llliller is a good fellow to sit ne.rt to either at a
banquet or during an (’.1'(14ttit’l(lll0tt.

EDWARD CLYDE SPEER, AA. Pittsburgh, Pa.

Pitt Weekly, ’12.
Gite Club.

l7istingu-ished himself during Junior near by taking
scarlet fever just when he was about to take a scholarship
in tvsychology. The man who called off the freshman boat
ride. (‘lwlr has a lanrlable habit of beating‘ non-Gentiles
and Ethio/vians over the head with heawy tc.rt books just
before the startled /vrof. calls the roll.

WARREN W. ZINSMASTER, EAE, Navarre, Ohio.

Massillon High School. Economics Quartet.

Navarre High School. Controller Owl, ’15.

Band. Student Assistant in Accounting.
Glee Club.

Holds the balance of fate for the poor fresh in account-
ing and is Prof. Flocleen"s right—hand man. Professional
cares nezrer interfered with "Zins" lveing a mighty good
fellow, and it would be a mighty hard job to ﬁnd anyone
about Thaw Hall that doesn’t have a hearty liking for him.
One of the best students in the school, but you never find
it being impressed upon you while you talk to him.

RAY GALLAGHER STEELE, Pittsburgh, Pa.

Pittsburgh High School. Class Football, 1, 2, 3.
Y. M. C. A. Delegate, Kansas Cit.y.Class Basket Ball, 1, 2.
Treasurer Y. M. C. A.

Takes life and Y. M. C. A. seriously and expects others
to do the same. Despite this Steele needs more than the
fingers on- both hands to count his friends, and if he once
becomes interested in anything you can count on some hard
work. backed u/> with ideas that count for soinetln'ng._
Possesses good horse sense and many iiheable qualities.

WILLIAM CAMPBELL, Pittsburgh, Pa.

Kiskiminetas, 1911.
Paulding School, N. Y.

Bill is the traveled man of 1915 and is always called upon
in Dr. Thor/>e’s classes to verify statements about France
or Italy. but he rarely commits himself. We don’t hear as
7'/111571 from him as we would like to, but we all like to
bum with him when occasion offers. Rumor hath it that
when not ardently pursuing his studuies Bill is ardently
pursuing son1ethin_q else—/vonltry.

ARTHUR WILLIAMS GILES, EAE, Pittsburgh, Pa.

Glee Club. Varsity Baseball.
Cap and Gown. Student Senate, 1912.
Student Band.

Art can bring tears to the eyes of a terra cotta statue
when he /rlays on that cornet of his. The Student Band
certainly owes a lot to Giles for his hard, consistent work.
When the clouds of dust settle after an election to the
Student Senate, the lanle form of /l. Giles is generally seen
enierging muttering curses against the tverﬁdious foe.
