The arrival of registration kits in mid—August was a rude reminder to vaca-
tioning Pitt students of the approaching Fall Trimester. Sagacious seniors con-
tentedly filled out the multitude of cards and sent in their scholarship forms,
while freshmen who never knew the frustrations of long lines, labyrinth of ar-
rows, and signs tried to understand why the University had to know their major.

The School of Business Administration Cabinet
was active in providing programs of interest to
the students. Following the newly instituted pro-
gram they invited outstanding speakers in the
ﬁeld of business to speak at three seminars. The
Business Administration Cabinet also forms a
channel through which student affairs and prob-
lems can be brought to the attention of the
school’s administration.

Student Government in the School of Engineer-
ing and Mines is vested in the Engineering and
Mines Cabinet. Composed of four elected mem-
bers from each department, the Cabinet provides
a student voice in inﬂuencing faculty and ad-
ministrative decisions regarding the trimester
plan, curriculum and other major problems. In
addition to its administrative functions, the Cabi-
net plans for and sponsors such worthwhile proj-
ects as the EMITT Award, Engineer’s Week, and
the Outstanding Senior Award. Its plans also in-
clude the Engineer’s Ball, the Shamrock Ball, co-
ordination of the intra—department athletic pro-
gram, and providing for the maintenance of the
lounge in the Engineering and Mines Building.
As one of the most eﬁective Student Govern-
ments on campus, the Engineering and Mines
Cabinet continues to be a strong inﬂuence for
over a third of a century.

Foto Club

Regardless of the shrill feminine
cries arising in the wee hours
from the black depths beyond
the darkroom doors, and the
shrieks, groans, scrapings, and
slitherings that resound from the
fourth ﬂoor hall Walls, the mem-
bers of the Foto Club insist that
they are only happy hobby lovers.

However, the usually unrelia-
ble sources have let it slip that
this same Foto Club, operating
supposedly from capital origi-
nating in a ﬁVe—dol1ar—a—head
honorarium, has to date ﬁnanced
a) an unsuccessful coup directed
against the Thane of Bosnia-

bridled orgies, and c) one bri-
dled orgy.

Glee Club

The Men’s Glee Club is one of the oldest extracurricular activities on the Univer-

sity of Pittsburgh campus. Last year the group celebrated its seventieth anniversary.
Besides being one of the oldest groups on campus, the Glee Club is one of the
most active. In addition to participating in many University activities and present-
ing a Christmas Concert with Women’s Choral, they perform throughout the city of
Pittsburgh and in the eastern section of the United States for many civic organiza-
tions and other colleges. They also present programs for high schools in the Pitts-
burgh area.

Believing that singing together creates a strong bond of friendship, the Glee Club
creates a willingness in its members to constantly strive for perfection. The pro-
grams of the Men’s Glee Club demonstrate their versatility as they present classi-
cal compositions, folk songs, and novelties all with the same enthusiasm and high
quality.

University. Poetry, drama, short stories,
essays, and reviews are accepted from
talented students eager to have their work
in print. This year two issues of the mag-

man Club. The club provides Catholic students with a
more balanced life through religious, educational, and so-
cial activities. Among the religious and educational activi-
ties are Initiation, Communion breakfasts, First Friday
Communion breakfasts and Tuesday and Wednesday lec-
tures at noon. Full, too, is the social program of the New-
man Club. There have been Socials, a pizza party, square

The eﬁort to put out the best possible
publication insures the OWL staﬁ many
hours of work throughout the school
year. The lamps on the fourth ﬂoor of
the Student Union burn dimly long into
the nights, casting light on the serious
hard work as well as on the fun and
frolic that provide extra incentive for the
staﬁ members. A bond of friendship and

of unity comes from time and effort spent,

on a common project, and when a First
Honor Rating from Columbia and a

Press were awarded, a bond of pride
was added to the relationships already
ﬁrmly established.

When the PITT NEWS began publishing ﬁfty—four years ago, it came out once a
week; now it has expanded and is published twice a week during all three trimes—
ters. The newly instituted controversial editorial policy led to an ever—increasing
response on the part of students and faculty members in the form of letters to the
editor. Since the aim of the NEWS is to provide an outlet for student opinion and
journalistic abilities as well as comprehensive coverage of the happenings on cam-
pus, the organization has effectively fulﬁlled its purpose.

The Associated Collegiate Press awarded the NEWS an All—American Award
this year. The staﬂ also sponsored a High School Institute for all the area high
schools to participate in and receive help and advice in putting out a better high
school paper.

Pitt Players

Pitt Players is an extra—curricular theatre production
group. It was founded in 1807 as The Thespian Corpora-
tion and in 1917 the name was changed to Pitt Players.
The qualiﬁcations for membership are a love and interest
in the theatre and all its functions. The purpose of the
group is to produce a high caliber of credited plays which
in turn will stimulate interest on the Pitt campus.

Pitt Players sponsored the production of Saroyan’s “The
Time of Your Life” and also the Menotti Opera, “The
Telephone.” In addition to these productions the group
worked on TV programs and an experimental art ﬁlm.
Each year they hold a banquet where the dramatic awards
are given.

The Skyscraper Engineer, which is edited and man-
aged by students, has recently been awarded ﬁrst place
by Pi Delta Epsilon, honorary journalism fraternity, as
the class A Engineering School undergraduate maga-
zine of 1959-60.

Among its social affairs there are frequent staff par-
ties and picnics. This year at their annual banquet the
members celebrated a successful ten years.

Student Government is the policy making and enforcing organization of the student
body. Student Government was organized in order to enable students to Voice
their opinions and to provide a channel of communication between the students
and the faculty and administration. Oﬁicers and representatives are elected from
the student body at large and various committee chairmen are appointed by the
President. It is the responsibility of Student Government to satisfy all the needs
and desires of other organizations on campus. All University activities such as the
Christmas dance, Inauguration Supper and Freshman Orientation are handled
through Student Government.

Every day of the week and at almost all hours of the day, something exciting is
happening in the Student Union. 11 may be that classic movie you never did get to
see showing at the University Film Series. Or if your desire is intellectual stimula-
tion, then Quotes and Comments or the Midday Series is for your interest. At
Quotes and Comments you will hear discussions by members of Pitt’s faculty while
at Midday Series you are likely to hear anyone who is nationally famous from
Henry Cabot Lodge and Aldous Huxley to Malcolm Muggeridge. Perhaps you
would rather relax and have fun. Then the dance series, jazz concerts or a perform-
ance of the Symphonetts is for you. All of these features are made possible through
the hard work of members of the Student Union Board. Working with members of
the University staff, the members of the Student Union Board plan, co-ordinate,
and execute all the activities of the Student Union.

In order that the glorious tradition of the Old World will not succumb to the hasty
forgetfulness of the New, there have banded together a stalwart group of higher
class indiViduals—the SDH, Stalwarts in the Defense of Heraldry. This semi—secret
organization is deVoted—to the last dying breath of the last indiVidual—to the
creation and the continuation of the glorious art of heraldry and the environs there-
of. Requirements for membership do not include Q.P.A., friends on the faculty, or
a sparkling smile. A spirit of “joie de Vivre,” a reluctance to pay dues, and the
willingness to accept an immediate presidency mark the incipient member. Induc-
tion is by tapping only and the bestowing of a platinum key bearing the coat of
arms of the SDH, a mole rampant.

William Pitt Debate Union

The William Pitt Debating Union is devoted to the discussion of contro-
versial public issues. Through the training offered by the Debating Union,
students learn the techniques of analysis and public address. Debating
leads to experience in many media. Practice intermural debates are held
twice a week with extemporaneous contests as a regular part of the pro-
gram. Major intercollegiate debates are held with 500 participating col-
leges and universities. Included among the 500 intercollegiate debates are
engagements in the West Indies and Canada. Debate trips allow members
of the teams to learn about other campuses and even other countries. The
Pitt speakers also appear on a number of television shows including the
weekly WQED program, FACE THE PEOPLE. Preparing for these many
appearances also motivates members to inquire into current issues.

 

S.C.R.O.

The Student Council of Religious Organ-

by a group of devoted students who rep-
resented four major faith groups and
eleven religious organizations on the Pitt
Campus. Members of SCRO are elected
by their individual clubs and represent
the Protestant, Roman Catholic, Jewish,
and Eastern Orthodox foundations.
Through its activities SCRO tries to pro-
mote inter—religious instruction and re-
ligious consciousness on the campus.

greeks

Greeks develop the social side of

Social fraternities and sororities, local or international, pro-
vide many advantages for their members. The Greeks pro-
mote high scholarship through positive study programs and
tutoring within their own ranks. They teach teamwork and
fair play through inter—fraternity and inter—sorority athletics.
They develop a spirit of competition by rivalry in Homecom-
ing which carries over to outside life. They improve poise and
conﬁdence by chairmanships, ofﬁcerships, and work. They
encourage the joining and accepting of responsibility in im-
portant campus activities. But most important of all, the
Greeks contribute to the social side of their members.

Through the fraternity and sorority social programs, the
man who was once shy and retiring, learns to be self—confi—
dent as a Greek. He has developed into the well—rounded
person that he should be, helped by the extensive social ac-
tivities presented by his fraternity. At all-Greek affairs he ,
gets opportunities to meet members of other fraternities and
sororities and to better inter—group relations. Regular informal
parties bring the brothers or sisters together for good times
and camaraderie. Sometimes the Greeks elaborate on their
parties by using novel costume themes: the Roman Holiday,
the Hawaiian Hula-Hop, the Roaring Twenties Party, and
the Gay Nineties Party are examples of the many different
theme affairs held by the Greeks. Formals, whether they are
the Spring, Fall, or Founder’s Day Formals, are always the
highlight of the social year for any Greek group. Often a
fraternity Spring Formal is combined into a weekend event
which closes out the school year on a social note. The com-
bination of all these affairs enable the Greek to mature so-
cially, and to help him become the total man.

The Interfraternity Council is the gov-
erning body of all Pitt social fraternities.
Each fraternity, represented by its presi-
dent and one other member has one vote.
Chief objectives of the IFC are the es-
tablishment of a unity of spirit and action
among fraternities and promotion of the
general welfare of the University and the
students.

The Council sponsors many programs,
including interfraternity athletics ranging
from football to ping—pong; Greek Week,
co—sponsored with Pan-Hellenic Council;
and special service projects, including
several worthy charities.

The IF Judicial Committee is the
branch of the Council which investigates
and rules on violations of fraternity laws
in which fraternity men are involved.

Delta Sigma Phi

The international social fraternity, Delta Sigma Phi, was
founded at the College of the City of New York in 1899.
Although a comparatively young fraternity, the Delta Sigs
have risen until they are now in the top quarter of all na-
tional social fraternities, and their plan for “Engineered
Leadership” has brought them such leaders as Heinrich
Bonstedt, Editor of the OWL, Richard Sobota, president
of the Student Government, and Nick Kefal, president of
Delta Sig and a member of" the OWL Hall of Fame. The
Delta Sigs also have an active social program which in-
cludes parties, sports, and a formal spring Weekend.

Alpha was founded in 1913 to
further the mutual beneﬁt of
young college men united by
common goals and shared pur-
poses. To encourage scholastic
achievement, to cultivate a feel-
ing of brotherhood, and to be of
some service to the community
are the worthy aims of this
group.

This year the Alphas spon-
sored a back to school barn
party, the annual pledge dance,
and the Winter Whirl as the
main ingredients in their social
program.

brotherhood.

This Fall the Kappa Nus had
the largest pledge class on cam-
pus. The fraternity sponsored a
party at the Hilton and a spring
formal. The group also entered

A bus crowded with shouting freshman
men, hurriedly improvised team yells, and
an upperclass counselor standing in the
aisle leading cheers marks the gradual
abandonment of the first week’s role play-
ing. The freshmen slip back into a more
natural boyish rowdiness. The exuberant
competition and newfound comradeship
provide an opportunity for the freshman to
acquire that feeling peculiar to himself
which he will come to call, oversimplifying,
school spirit.

honoraries

onoraries recognize student

achievement

Honoraries play an "important part in the organization of any
University because of their service both to the institution and
to the individual. They serve the individual first of all, because
by their nature as an honorary society, their members gain a
certain amount of respect from the student body through their
membership. Secondly, honoraries oﬁer a place where a free
exchange of ideas can ﬂow, and thirdly, because many hono-
raries, especially professional, serve as a liaison between their
members’ lives as students and their future lives in the actual
profession. Last of all, honoraries foster a spirit of fellowship
among their members.

The types of honoraries on the University of Pittsburgh
campus vary greatly. There are professional honoraries which
honor students in a particular ﬁeld, and there are leadership
honoraries which recognize those actively engaged in activi-
ties. There are also scholastic honoraries which recognize
those who have made outstanding contributions in the aca-
demic ﬁeld. Although each of these three types have a dis-
tinct and separate purpose, they all attempt to recognize and
honor those who have distinguished themselves in these vari-
ous areas.

No matter what type the honorary is, students are proud to
be tapped as members because it is a mark of achievement
rendered to those who have served the University well.

The Mu chapter of Alpha Tau Delta was organized in 1944 under the sponsorship of the Theta
chapter at Duquesne. This national sorority for nurses has a three fold purpose: to raise the stand-
ards of nursing education; to develop an organization which will reward their efforts with awards,
scholarships, and grants; and to increase the fellowship of working professional nurses. Any active
student in the School of Nursing with a Q.P.A. of 2.5 or above is eligible for membership. Recent
projects include the organization of an alumni chapter and a scholarship fund. An annual dinner
dance, picnics and rush parties are on the social calendar. It is also a member of the Professional
Panhellenic Association.

Scabbard and Blade

Scabbard and Blade, an honorary fraternity for advanced
army ROTC cadets, was established on Pitt’s campus in
1929 by Company D. Its aims are to spread intelligent
information concerning the military requirements of the
United States, to develop and preserve those qualities es-
sential for top military ofﬁcers, and to take an active part
in the military affairs of the community.

Their largest project is the Military Ball, held in co-
operation with the other military units of the University.

Quo Vadis

Visitors to Pitt’s Nationality Rooms are
greeted by student hostesses who lead
guided tours through the rooms, inter-
preting the cultures of each country rep-
resented and providing a brief history of
each classroom. The hostesses are mem-
bers of Quo Vadis, a student organiza-
tion founded ﬁfteen years ago, to instil a
closer understanding between nations,
and to provide a broader comprehension
of societies and cultures throughout the
world.

A sophomore woman, in order to be-
come a member, must be able to pass a
written and oral examination on material
concerning the classrooms and possess a
2.0 Quality Point Average in all her stud-
ies. Quo Vadis helps to enrich the Vis-
itors’ knowledge as well as the hostesses’
knowledge of cultures other than their
own. Each year the girls in the society
make themselves an indispensable part
of the broadening University by welcom-
ing and entertaining the many foreign
visitors at Pitt.

paring leaders.

The organization aims to foster high professional standards, encourage curative
work, promote the maximum development of the individual and, thus, increase
one’s capacity to serve the profession and society. Each year a scholarship is pro-
vided for a student in the basic program in the school of nursing.

Sigma Tau

Sigma Tau, national honorary engineering fraternity, recognizes junior
and senior engineering students who have achieved a 3.0 Q.P.A. and who
show qualities of sociability and leadership. The purpose of Sigma Tau is
to promote scholarship and engineering ethics and to recognize outstand-
ing achievements or abilities in the various ﬁelds of engineering. The sym-
bol of the fraternity is a pyramid and rail section representing stability
and progress.

Sigma Tau keeps up to date with new articles of interest by subscribing
to the PYRAMID, a national quarterly publication‘. Their activities included
the presentation of awards to outstanding freshmen, a dance held in No-
vember, a stag party, and trips to plants in the Pittsburgh area.

 

odk man of the year

Carl H. Templin

Each year Omicron Delta Kappa chooses an outstanding
man in the senior class to be awarded the title of ODK
Man of the Year. This award, given for leadership, scholar-
ship, sound character, and service to the University, is the
highest honor a Pitt man can receive. For 1961, the ODK
Man of the Year is Carl H. Templin.

A Physical Education major, Carl H. Templin has been
most active in Varsity Soccer. He is also a member of Phi
Eta Sigma, ODK, Westminster Fellowship, and Physical
Education Club. While at the University, Templin also
devoted his service to community projects; he was a recre-
ation leader at the Home for the Crippled Children and at
the City’s Juvenile Court. During the year 1958-1959 he
was chosen to serve with two other Americans as a volun-
teer worker and teacher in the American Mission of
Pokwo-Gam Belta, Ethiopia.

mr. and miss pitt

Every senior class has its leaders, its activities men, its schol-
ars. The Class of 1961 has many such people, all of whom
have contributed much to their class and the University. Each
year the OWL singles out two outstanding seniors to repre-
sent the best of the class, the best of the school. These are
two people who have been active in many groups and organi-
zations, quite often oﬂicers in several, while maintaining high
scholarship. Their work has always been unselﬁsh and they
continually fulﬁll more than just their responsibilities. These
two seniors, representative of the type of student the Univer-
sity is striving to produce, are awarded with the titles of Mr.
and Miss Pitt. For 1961, the OWL has chosen Harry Turner
and Ann Abbinanti.

Miss Abbinanti is in the School of Liberal Arts majoring
in Writing. She was Vice President of the Student Union
Board and was selected a Senior Worthy last year. She had
been tapped into Mortar Board and was a member of the
William Pitt Debating Union.

Harry (Woody) Turner was President of the William Pitt
Debating Union, acted as Senior Worthy for the school year
1960-1961, and was winner of the “S” Award last year. He
used this award to study at the University of Oxford. A mem-
ber of ODK, Druids, and the Westminster Foundation, Turn-
er also served on Student Government in 1959.

owl hall of fame

The OWL Hall of Fame is comprised of outstanding sen-
iors who have been chosen to represent the senior class.
They are picked by the Hall of Fame Committee, which is
composed of six outstanding Junior men, six outstanding
Junior women, and representatives of the Dean of Stu-
dents Staff. Through the many diversiﬁed activities and
interests of the members of the 1961 Hall of Fame, the
OWL hopes that a fair sampling of the important men and
women in the senior class has been obtained. These people
who have been chosen for this honor are the students who
have sat next to you in class; these are the men and women
you see in the Tuck Shop, at football games, in SG meet-
ings; these are the leaders and workers who are oiﬁcers » - M
and chairmen of their groups, clubs, and committees; these Gail Bruder
are the students who have taken an active interest in extra-

curricular functions, and in the University as a whole.

football Rough schedule ends

A mark was established by the Panther football team this year.
Although the Panther gridders didn’t get a bowl bid or place high
in nationalfootball rankings, they did set a team record for the
most one point decisions in one season. Compiling a 4-3-3 record,
two of the Panthers’ three losses were by one point and three
games ended in ties of identical 7-7 scores. On the other hand, Pitt
did produce an All-American in End, Mike Ditka, and nine Pan-
thers were drafted by professional football teams. This is the larg-
est number of Panthers ever to be picked for professional football.

Pitt was primarily a- defensive team this year. The Cats limited
their opponents to 77 points in 10 games while scoring 134 them-
selves. Once again this season the Panthers’ oﬁensive was led by
the highly publicized C—Boys. Halfback, Bob Clemens, was the
leading ground gainer with 249 yards in 74 carries for an average
of 4.7. Halfback, Fred Cox, was second with 333 yards and full-
back, Jim Cunningham, was fourth with 303 yards. Sophomore,
Jim Traﬁcant showed great promise as the Panthers’ number one
quarterback. Although hurt through the latter part of the season,
Traﬁcant still led the Panthers in passing with 29 completions in
57 attempts for a total of 407 yards. All-American, Mike Ditka,
caught all of those passes for 229 yards and two touchdowns. The
Cats’ all-around performer, Fred Cox, was second in pass receiv-
ing, did all the kicking and led the Panthers in scoring with 42
points. Leading the Panthers in line play were Mike Ditka, Larry
Vignali, Paul Hodge, Regis Coustillac, Dick Mills and sophomore,
Gary Kaltenbach. The highlight of the season was a stunning 10-0
upset over Syracuse, one of the top teams in the country.

U.C.L.A.: A one-point jinx hit the Panthers early in the season as
they dropped the opener to the UCLA Bruins 8-7., The Panthers
questioned several calls that enabled the Bruins to defeat the Pan-
thers. A pass on the Cats’ four was caught and dropped when
Jim Cunningham made a tackle; however, the referees ruled a
completed pass. The Panthers top guard, Larry Vignalli, was in-
jured and the Cats were hurting at the outset of the season.
MICHIGAN STATE: An accident cost the Panthers a victory
against Michigan State. With only seconds remaining in the half,
and the Panthers winning 7-0 as a result of Ed Sharockman’s
touchdown pass to Mike Ditka, Sparten, _Tom Wilson, hurled a
long pass intended to put his team back in the game. Sharockman

OKLAHOMA: A trip to Oklahoma netted no better luck and the
Panthers were still winless after three starts. Fred Cox was out-
standing as he scored on a three yard run and a 34-yard pass from
sophomore quarterback, Jim Traﬁcant. A two—point conversion
by the Sooners was enough for a 15-14 margin of victory. The
Panthers still had not shaken that one point jinx.

MIAMI: Feeling of expectation ran high in the Panther dressing
room after the Miami game. For three weeks running the Pan-
thers had been frustrated by one-point decisions, then they tasted
victory, 17-6, and they were hungry for more. Offensive stars for
the Panthers were Bob Clemens who scored on a three-yard run,
Jim Cunningham who romped nine yards for a touchdown and
Fred Cox who kicked a ﬁeld goal and two extra points.

WEST VIRGINIA: Then came the West Virginia game. Seek-
ing to revenge a setback from the year before, the Panthers
pounded the Mountaineers to the tune of 42-0. Many of the Pan-
thers got into the scoring act. Bob Clemens scored on a 12-yard
pass and a 16-yard scamper, Ray Tarasi on a 23-yard intercep-
tion, All-American, Mike Ditka, on a 58-yard run. Fred Cox
added the extra points.

T.C.U.: But the Panthers enthusiasm over two consecutive wins
was terminated by Texas Christian University. In the ﬁrst half of
play TCU completely dominated play. The second half proved
to be a reverse of the situation. Running quarterback, Ed Shar0ck-
man scored the Panthers’ only touchdown on a 75-yard run, the
longest of the year for the Cats. Fred Cox added the extra point
but the Panthers couldn’t evade another 7-7 tie and a 2-2-2 record.

victory for the Panthers, who had been readying themselves for
Syracuse all season. The win ended Syracuse’s 16-game record.
Fred Cox, voted by the press as the top back, kicked a 38-yard
ﬁeld goal and an extra point. Sophomore quarterback, Jim Traﬁ-
cant scored the Panthers’ only touchdown on a 12-yard run. Sen-
ior end, Ron Delﬁne, won the football.

NOTRE DAME: Although Notre Dame was laden with Sopho-
mores, the Irish proved to be one of the roughest teams the Pan-
thers faced all year. However, the Panthers had too much power
for Notre Dame and defeated the Irish 20-13. Mike Ditka caught
a 58-yard pass setting up one touchdown. Fullback, Jim Cunning-
ham, scored on a one—yard plunge. Fred Cox kicked the extra
point and later scored from the two yard line. Halfback, Chuck

and one wishes he could trade a little of his
freedom for home’s comforts.

ARMY: With a 4-2 record, the Panthers had their eyes on a pos-

Army’s quarterback, Torn Blanda spoiled the Panthers’ hopes
as he set a Cadet passing record hitting on 24 of 35 passes for
235 yards. The Panthers’ only score came in the third quarter
when Ed Sharockman picked oil a Blanda pass on the Army 39-
yard line and raced the distance for the score.

PENN STATE: A ﬁst full of miscues cost the Panthers a 14-3
loss to Penn State in the last game of the season. The loss also gave
the Cats their Worst record since ’57. A ﬁeld goal by Fred Cox
early in the game gave the Panthers a short lived 3-0 lead. Lions
roared back to score on passes of three and 30 yards, enough
points to stop the Cats.

After a disappointing start, the Panther Soccer Team ﬁnished
their eleven-game season with a commendable 5-5-1 mark. The
Panthers were plagued by injuries throughout the season. Open-
ing the season with Frostburg State College, the Panthers lost the
services of sophomore standout, Bob Cuthbert. Cuthbert was out
of action the first two weeks with a knee injury. Pete Smith, fancy-
dribbling Irish star, also incurred a leg injury during the year.
Goalie, George Zanicopoulos, received a bruised hip in the Michi-
gan State game and was unable to equal last year’s All—American
performance. Without the full services of top offensive and de-
‘fensive standouts, coach Leo Bemis was forced to use inexperi-
enced sophomores to struggle through most of the season. Bemis’s
“patchwork” Panthers, however, recuperated near the end of the
season and the booters tied unbeaten West Chester, 1-1, and de-
feated a strong Penn State team, 2-1-

unimpressive season record.

Although the Panther Cross-Country team had an un-
impressive 2-6 slate this season, Coach Carl Rees is op-
timistic about his team’s chances in the future, for three
of the top six runners were sophomores. The Panthers
opened the season with a 25-31 win over Slippery
Rock, then placed third in a triangular meet with Ohio
University and Central State. Penn State brought a
strong team to the Schenley Park Course and handed
the Panthers their Worst defeat of the season 40-19.
West Virginia gave the Panthers their most heartbreak-
ing loss edging the Jungle Cats 28-27. The Pitt team also
placed second in a triangular meet with Navy and
Georgetown, and lost a dual meet to New York Uni-
versity. The Panthers competed-in the ICAAAA meet,
but failed to place a runner. Co—captains for the Pan-
thers this year were seniors Bill Hinchberger and Reed
Clarke. Sophomore Harry Stokes led the Panthers in
every meet, although he only placed in the Navy-

beat Stokes were considered to be among the 10 best
cross—country runners in the nation. Other top runners
for the Panthers were Bob Tarkany, Bill Hinchberger,
Reed Clarke, and Vance Carter. Both Tarkany and
Carter were sophomores. Despite the Panther’s poor
record, Coach Rees feels conﬁdent that his runners will
develop into some of Pitt’s all—time greats.

This season the Panthers recorded their ﬁrst winning cage
mark in three years, just barely attaining the achievement
with a 12-11 chart by knocking oﬁ arch-rival Penn State in
the ﬁnal contest of the season, 57-53. Appropriately
enough, Co-Captains John Fridley and Dick Falenski led
the scoring with 20 and 13 points respectively. The sched-
ule started off with a shocking 81-80 last-second upset
over Big Ten stalwart Purdue, as the Cats rallied in the
last half after trailing by as much as 22 points. The round-
ballers then dropped ﬁve of the next six matches, including
a convincing 80-66 loss to Duquesne in the Steel Bowl
ﬁnal. They were revived, however, by the exciting play of
two newcomers to the lineup, sophomore Ben Jinks and
ex-serviceman Tom Maloney. With these two registering
points in double ﬁgures, the Panthers won four straight
games during the holiday season, including a 79-62 Victory
over Syracuse in which Jinks dunked 25 points——a season
high.

Coach Bob Timmons’ boys conquered two favored foes
in the most exciting contests of the campaign, besting
Temple in overtime 80-75 and downing nationally ranked
Villanova, 57-55. Both games were sparked by the in-
spired play of Don Steinhart who scored 35 points in the
two conquests. The Panthers split even in their next eight
duels, losing to the Mountaineers once again, but brushing
off neighboring Carnegie Tech for the second time, 87-75.
Newcomer Jinks proved the leading scorer on the starting
ﬁve, with 13 points per game, but three others averaged in
double ﬁgures—Tom Maloney, 11.9, John Fridley, 11.0
and Dick Falenski, 10.9. The other starter, Don Steinhart,
just missed with a 9.2 clip. Fridley paced the rebounding
department with 288; Steinhart was next with 204.

Day begins at dawn for most commuters and the morning hours are spent entangled

in traﬁﬁc, locating parking spaces, and trudging the long blocks to the Cathedral. Ar-
riving on time hinges upon traﬁic conditions, which are uncertain in clear weather
and impossibly snarled in rain and snow. And when spring rains ﬁnally wash away the
last of winter’s ice, the driver must be alert to avoid broken axles and ruined springs
as he faces that condition peculiar to Pittsburgh streets—the Pot-hole Peril.

upset over Lehigh

Though it was their worst mark since 1951, the 6-3 record com-
piled by Coach Rex Perry’s wrestlers was nothing to be ashamed
of. On the brighter side of the picture were the matmen’s upset
victory over Lehigh, their good showing in the Eastern and Na-
tional championships plus some ﬁne individual records. The upset
of Lehigh could be classed as one of the top collegiate wrestling
upsets of the year. The Panthers were heavy underdogs to the
Engineers, but, when it was all over, the Cats found themselves on
the right side of a 16-14 score.

Victories over Cornell, Syracuse, Northwestern, Michigan State
and Maryland can be mainly attributed to the work of the Blue
and Golds’ four light-weight wrestlers known as the “Mighty
Mites.” Rich Martin, Larry Lauchle, Daryl Kelvington and John
Zolikoﬂ compiled a 31-4-1 mark among themselves. Martin was
undefeated, and Lauchle and Zolikoﬁ absorbed one loss each.
For Lauchle it was the ﬁrst dual meet loss of his collegiate career.
He ended his stay at Pitt with a 27-1 record in dual meets. Sopho-
more Jim Harrison also helped the Panthers greatly with a 6-3
record. Although the grapplers failed to win the Eastern title as
they had done in the previous year, they showed themselves quite
well. Lauchle and Martin won individual titles. Second places TRIUMPHANTLY 157 Pounder John Z01ik01‘T has his hand

in Pitt history

The 1961 edition of the Panther swimming team proved to be the
fastest in the University’s history as is evidenced by a long list of
broken records. Lack of depth hampered the natators somewhat,
but they were still able to come up with a highly satisfactory 6-3
record. The assault on the record book was instrumental in bring-
ing about victories over Lehigh, Bucknell, New York University,
Virginia Military Institute, Syracuse and Notre Dame. Losses were
suffered at the hands of powerful North Carolina State, Maryland
and Ohio University. Leading the record—breaking charge were
Jerry Sollinger, Tony Sarsﬁeld and Carl Warnes, who each broke
two records. Sollinger broke the 100 and 200 yard records in his
specialty, the backstroke, as did Sarsﬁeld and Warnes in their
divisions, the butterﬂy and breast—stroke, respectively.

Bart Haas smashed the school’s 50 yard freestyle record and
proved to be a consistent winner in the 100 yard freestyle also.
Jackie Hayes got into the act by setting a new mark in the 200
yard individual medley race. Sarsﬁeld, Warnes and Haas joined
Rich Rush to break the freestyle relay record by more than three
seconds. Tony Tresser was a regular point winner in the 220 and
440 yard freestyle races, as were Kevin Keller and Jerry Irwin in
diving. Coach Ben Grady will have Sarsﬁeld, Warnes, Sollinger,
Hayes and Rush back next season.

CONCENTRATION is very important for the perfect dive.

through a poor 2-5 season

Gymnasts Ed Zamecnik and Earl McConnell give Coach Warren Neiger the
promise of a bright future. This year the Panther’s gymnastic team struggled
through a 2-5 season, the poorest in Pitt’s gym history. The biggest problem
Neiger faced all season was the lack of manpower. He ran through a rough
schedule with only eight men, most of them inexperienced. But when the gymnasts
did win, they did it big. Midway through the season they defeated Georgia Tech
86-41. In their next to last meet, they dropped West Virginia 70-26.

Although Joe Battaglia led the Panthers with 70 points, Earl McConnell de-
veloped into Pitt’s outstanding winner, taking ﬁve ﬁrst places in tumbling. Mc-
Connell also took a second in free exercise in the Eastern Collegiate Gymnastic
Championship and captured a ﬁfth in the same competition in the Nationals.
Neiger credits McConnell with the outstanding performance of the season when
he ran up a near perfect score in his favorite event, tumbling, against Army. Ed
Zamecnik, although only a sophomore, took second place team point honors
with 70 markers, picking up most of his points in his speciality, the high bar.
Losses suffered were to Navy, Army, Syracuse, Temple and Penn State. " " ' _

The squash team compiled a 2-2 log this year, winning victories over
Penn and Dickinson by scores of 5-4 and 9-0 respectively. Their losses
were 3-6 and 2-7 to Army and Navy. The 9-0 victory over Dickinson
proved to be the ﬁrst shutout in University history. The Panthers partici-
pated in the National Intercollegiate Squash Racquets Tournament this
year where they tied with Army for fourth place in the team tourney. Be-
cause of the Panther’s small schedule, four games, they were not given
national ranking. Army, for instance, schedules 15 games a season, while
Penn plays 13.

The two top performers on the squash team this year were Dave
O’Loughlin and Joe Brown. Both ﬁnished the season with identical 4-0
records. O’Lough1in was voted the team’s Most Valuable Player. Brown, A HARD SHOT to the left wall is good for

a 7-7 ledger. Other Panther squashmen failed to get above the .500 mark.

Brown and O’Loughlin are both sophomores and, according to coaches
Ben Pope and Bill Summers, are expected to lead the Panthers again next
year.

West Virginia Was only win for Pitt

The Eastern Collegiate Athletic Conference selected Dan
Kanell as the top athlete in the East. Kanell, a senior,
maintained an excellent quality point average at the Uni-
versity and turned into one of the Panther’s top trackmen.
While Kanell was setting a record in the shot—put at 54 feet
4% inches, the rest of the trackmen and the team were
struggling through one of their worst seasons in years.

The only team the Panthers managed to beat this year
was West Virginia, a perennially weak opponent. The
Panthers smashed the Mounties 81-50. The rest of the
opponents rolled over the Panthers and left the team with
a poor 15 record.

Maryland handed the Panthers their worst defeat of
the season at 104-27. Most of the Panther’s problems
came as a result of poor depth. Kanell, a co—captain this
year along with Bill Hinchberger’ picked up more points STRAINING WITH EFFORT two Pitt runners cross the ﬁnish line
than any other trackman winning the discus and shot—put agamst Penn State‘ .
in every dual meet.

Hinchberger ran his best races toward the end of the
season. In a dual meet with Penn State, Hinchberger won
the 880—yard run in 1:53.3, the best time of his collegiate
career.

Coach Rees had to depend a lot on runners like sopho-
more Vance Carter who was hampered by injuries most
of the year. Carter did manage to win his share of races,
running his best race in the 440—yard distance at 49.6.

season best in last four years

A shining star in Pitt’s dismal summer sports record was
the outstanding showing made by the tennis team. The
netters, under the tutelage of Bill Summers, compiled
an ll—3 mark to give the young mentor his best record
since he accepted the coaching chores four years ago.

Losses to highly rated Penn State and Navy and an up-
set at the hands of Franklin and Marshall marred the
season. Triumphs over district rivals West Virginia, Du-
quesne, and Carnegie Tech and a victory over usually
strong Fort Eustis highlighted the campaign.

Outstanding individual performances for the racquet-
men were turned in by the number one and three play-
ers, Joe Brown and Jack Douglass. Brown, one of the
district top players, turned in a 12-2 card while the di-
minutive Douglass posted a glittering ll-l season, despite
being hampered by a back injury during the entire year.

The bottom end of the Cat’s six man lineup also held
up admirably. Paul Kochman and Roger Glaser both won
more than they lost. Only in the number two and four
spots did the Cats run into trouble. Dave O’Loughlin and
Ralph both played well but constantly seemed to be run-
ning into strong opposition.

In double play Brown and Douglass once again led the
way. The outstanding duo was defeated only once during
the season. Kochman and Ted Martens gave Summers
another doubles team that could be counted on for a win.
A third doubles pair wasnever really found.

 

ACCURACY and a strong backhand made Ralph Mason a consistent threat

golf tearn’s season record

Coach George Underwood’s golfers, hampered by
a lack of early season practice, turned in a 6-9-1
record while playing against some of the finest
competition in the country.

The linksmen’s ﬁrst match was an indication
of what was to follow. They traveled to Ohio
State where they expected to play one match. In-
stead three teams showed up and the Panthers
dropped all three matches. Losses to powerful
Duke and Navy were not such bitter pills to swal-
low considering they always rank among the
country’s better teams.

Wins over Carnegie Tech and Duquesne and
the outstanding showing of Ron Dermitt helped to
make the season a little brighter. Dermitt played
the best golf of his career in reaching the ﬁnals of
the Eastern Intercollegiate Golf Association’s
championship before being beaten in a sudden
death playoff.

The team’s top three scorers were Stew Snod—
grass, Neil Shorthouse, and Ron Dermitt, who was
voted the most Valuable player. They played con-
sistently good golf and were instrumental in the
team’s six Victories. Others who saw action for
the Cats were Jack Veseleny, Denny Peters, Bill
Hoffman, and Dale Long.

GOOD FORM and distance helped Ron Dermitt place as runner-
up in the Eastern Collegiate Golf Championships.

season partly blamed on trimester

 

NO QUESTION HERE, the throw from third to
first baseman Pete Suder nips a runner.

Jim Brosman, the literary pitcher for the Cincinnati Reds baseball
team, wrote a best—seller entitled “The Long Season” which could
also aptly headline a resume on the 1961 diamond scene at Pitt. The
Panthers lost the initial battle and the ﬁnale and eight of the thirteen
contests between.

It was a wonder that the Cat nine even compiled this record for it
often appeared that the gods were against them. A dozen of their
scheduled games were cancelled or postponed because of rain and
another abbreviated because of snow!

As it was, California State, of the Pennsylvania vintage, edged the
Pitt mitters 9-8 in the ﬁrst game, and the losers had a tough time
shaking the bad habit thereafter. A six game losing streak was among
the epidemics that besieged the forces, and twin—losses to arch—rivals
Penn State, Slippery Rock, and West Virginia did not ease the pain.

Only neighboring Duquesne consoled the forces somewhat, drop-
ping two meetings to ease the downward slide. Other ills that plagued
the forces were dropouts, the trimester plan, poor scheduling, pre-
season practice in the Field House, and a minimum roster.

The only bright spot in the season’s program was a brilliant 1-0
win over Clarion when sophomore Jim Sylvis hurled a no-hitter in
his first start.

Ironically enough, the Pitt team dropped the ﬁnal game of the year
to Fort Lee, Virginia, in a 14—inning marathon contest which lasted
until 1:00 in the morning. Sylvis pitched the entire game. Maybe he
ought to take up the pen and write a best—seller, “The Longest Sea-

administration

The Administration of any great Univer-
sity must be composed of leaders who are
outstanding in both ability and experi-
ence. The progress made by the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh is an excellent tribute
to its ﬁne administration.

Chancellor Edward H. Litchﬁeld came
to the University in 1955, bringing with
him the valuable experience gained
through his three successfully combined
careers——education, business, and public
service. ln the time that Dr. Litchﬁeld
had been here, he has had to call heavily
upon his background in inaugurating a
bold new program for Pitt.

The University Board of Trustees is
composed of outstanding people from
the ﬁelds of education, government, and
business. The diverse abilities of the
members of the Board of Trustees and
the service each has been willing to give
to the University has been instrumental
in making Pitt a leading American Uni-
versity.

its students and faculty. Yet a university is measured also by the W°rk-
less obvious. Research done in the quiet of a laboratory or in the
dusty shelves of the library can often bring recognition and ac-
claim. The achievements that mark our country’s progress in the
ﬁelds of science, medicine, and engineering are the products of
long and tedious hours spent on the campus long after the rest of
the university has ended its day. A vaccine or serum is the culmi-
nation of hundreds of successes and failures in a wide variety of
experiments completed by people within the academic professions.

Research at Pitt, growing in importance with the University as
a whole, manifests itself in projects as varied as the sciences them-
selves. Ranging from the search for drugs to use in cancer treat-
ment to the efficient management of an industrial ﬁrm to the
policy of the United States toward Red China, the University
strives to make itself not only a place of learning but of discovery
as well. Recognition of the role the University of Pittsburgh is
playing in all areas of research is shown by the constant increase
in endowments to the University by industry, government, and
private concerns, who realize that the world of tommorrow is being
planned within the University today.

liberal arts

Provides basis for specialized

The University of Pittsburgh believes that all students
should obtain a broad, liberal background upon which to
build a more specialized education in a professional ﬁeld.

The school of Liberal Arts, the oldest and largest divi-
sion of the University, is primarily concerned with pro-
viding such a liberal education for the students, stressing
the mastery of both Liberal Arts and Science. With a
strong background in liberal studies, usually obtained
over four trimesters, about one half of the original Liberal
Arts students enter one of the professional schools to

INDUSTRY REQUIRES a thorough understanding of products and
prices. A solid background is built on the repetition of problems
basic to the business world.

A NEW IBM 7070 CONTRASTS strangely its harsh lines
with the soft curves of a Gothic window.

ATTENTION IS FOCUSED on the blackboard as an instructor charts
the ﬁgures to be used for a homework assignment. Accurate notes are
necessary in order to complete the work correctly.

The University School of Business Administration
is intent upon graduating men and women who
are prepared to meet the increasing complexities
inherent in a rapidly progressing business world.

Ideally situated in one of America’s greatest
industrial centers the school has installed many
beneﬁcial innovations to its general curriculum,
as visits to the local company offices, discussions
with management personnel and participation in
business conferences, thus offering the students a
much broader insight into the business world.

Realizing that tomorrow’s business leaders
must have a professional as well as Liberal edu-
cation, the school requires all Business Adminis-
tration students to have completed two years of
study in the School of Liberal Arts, before enter-
ing Business Administration. The Liberal Arts
background provides the student with an oppor-
tunity to obtain an education in such areas as
psychology and foreign languages to complete his
business education.

The combination of a Liberal and a specialized
education, and the practical experiences gained
from personal contacts with nearby industries
serves to give the graduates of Pitt’s School of
Business Administration a superior background
in their chosen professions. Whatever their partic-
ular ﬁeld of specialization, each graduate will
have been trained to handle effectively, the ever
rising business problems.

PRECISE PAPERWORK and meticulous calculations
are musts in order to edge past a failing grade in
accounting.

Curriculum ives background

EVERY SPRING Civil Engineers make the trip to the upper cam-
pus to survey what many other classes have surveyed before them.
The results are not important; it’s the technique that they must learn.

in Humanities

Competing industrially in a world that has witnessed many techno-
logical advances has placed a severe strain on the number of top
quality engineers in this country. To replenish this dwindling supply
many engineering schools have revamped their curriculum, added
new teaching methods, generally increased the standards, and thus
the quality of their particular school. Leading in this gradual renais-
sance has been the University of Pittsburgh’s School of Engineering
and Mines. Located in the center of America’s greatest industrial
region, Pitt’s School of Engineering and Mines is in close contact
with many of the surrounding industries, giving her an insight into
many of the new advances in modern technology. Realizing that the
engineer of tomorrow must not only be well-versed in his scientiﬁc
skills, but must also have a sound liberal education, Pitt’s curriculum
has been so balanced that every graduating engineer has a strong
background in the Humanities. Prepared to meet the challenge of a
constantly changing world, the alumni of Pitt’s School of Engineering
and Mines lead the way to a more prosperous future for the world

OVCY.

CAREFUL OBSERVATIONS followed by calculations can
be the basis for a future career and can bring the immediate
reward of an A grade.

educaﬁon

Summer workshops aid

Since 1910, Pittsburgh’s School of Educa-
tion has been preparing professional edu-
cators through the study of theories and
their practical applications. The back-
ground, ideas, and theories are presented
both in formal class and in small discus-
sion groups.

The climax of the program comes,
however, when the future teacher may
put into practice what he has been taught,
while under the careful eye of an exper-
ienced educator.

The most essential qualiﬁcation of edu-
cation is progress and the University of
Pittsburgh has been making great strides
in this area. Research programs are being
carried on in aﬁiliation with other local .

FORCEFUL ENTHUSIASM and zeal of the young teacher, so evident in her early
career, plays an important role in fashioning the development of her pupils. Main-
taining this enthusiasm and freshness as she matures in her work is necessary, and
it’s something which many educators occasionally forget.

COLORFUL DISPLAYS and arrays can help the teacher
interest her second grade students, but as with most ele-
ments involved in education a great deal of time must be
spent preparing them.

institutions of learning, improving not
only Pitt’s program, but those of co—oper—
ative schools.

In addition to the courses offered in
the three trimesters, there are special
summer courses and workshops for teach-
ers unable to attend the third trimester.

The School of Education not only pre-
pares the students for teaching but at-
tempts to ﬁnd employment for them. The
School’s placement service has proved
most effective in matching the needs of
our schools with the qualiﬁcations and
interests of the graduating teacher.

closed circuit TV

Because of its excellent training and the perform-
ances of its graduates, the University of Pitts-
burgh’s Dental School is considered one of the
leading dental colleges in the country, and a
signiﬁcant branch of the University Medical
Center.

The student, in his sophomore rather than
junior year, actually begins the treatment of
patients, and for the ﬁrst time, the Dental School
has introduced closed circuit T.V. into the class-
room allowing the student to witness intricate
laboratory Work.

Because of its ﬁne reputation, the number of
applicants for Pitt’s Dental School is ever increas-
ing. Thus, requirements are becoming more strin-
gent, and only a high caliber of student is admit-
ted. With these rigid programs, the University
School of Dentistry will continue to rank as a
top Dental School.

UNDER THE GUIDANCE of skilled teachers students learn
techniques and practices that they will use in their professional
careers. Pitt students often take advantage of the moderate fees
and in turn provide the competent seniors with the necessary
patients.

nursing

Revised program to offer new

The University School of Nursing has revised its
program and courses to ﬁt the new trimester sys-
tem which offers many deﬁnite advantages.

An entering student will now attend school
for only nine trimesters, or three calendar years
instead of the ﬁve years required to earn a bac-
calaureate degree.

Two programs are offered under the School of
Nursing leading to the degree, Bachelor of Science
in Nursing.

One plan is for graduates of hospital programs
wishing to become professional nurses. The other
is for graduates of hospital programs wishing to
earn a baccalaureate degree. Nurses holding the
professional baccalaureate degree may prepare
to become practitioners in a clinical ﬁeld, for one '
of the functional ﬁelds, nursing administration,
nursing education, or nursing research. The aim
of the baccalaurete program is to prepare nurses
to practice in any setting.

Professional Education combined with a gen-
eral education prepares them to assume leader-
ship on the nursing team or as a head nurse, or
an assistant clinical instructor.

The school of Nursing offers graduate pro-
grams in nursing leading to the degree Master
of Nursing Education.

STEADY HANDS are the result of this student nurse’s three
years of applied training. Hours spent applying classroom knowl-
edge lead to a useful degree in nursing.

 

advantages

 

SITTING IN THE SUN a student nurse takes advan-
tage of the last warm September days as she scans her
notes before going to class.

A STUDY BREAK is welcome relief from hours of book work when
an understanding roommate is ready to listen to the day’s news. Lasting
friendships are formed when conﬁdences are shared in the friendly
atmosphere of the Nurses’ Residence.

AT NIGHT the lamps burn long as student
nurses work hard to master the fundamen-
tals of anatomy, chemistry, and biology. A
bit of drudgery is a necessity even to a
glamorous profession such as nursing.

pharmacy

School adjusts to

The University’s School of Pharmacy is striving to
develop the best program of study in a Pharmaceutical
ﬁeld by experimenting and improving methods of
study.

The Pharmacy student enrolls in the School of Lib-
eral Arts for the ﬁrst two years of his college career
enabling him to broaden and develop his educational
interests. The following three years are spent in the
School of Pharmacy completing the required ﬁve—year
program.

Practical experience is valuable to the Pharmacy
student. To insure this the school requires its students
to work a designated number of hours in an approved
retail drug company. Periodically, the students take
extensive trips to drug manufacturing centers through-
out the country.

The School of Pharmacy is currently attempting to
adjust their curriculum to the trimester program re-
cently put into effect at the University.

USE OF THE NEEDLE requires a sure hand and, when the
victim is a frog, a sound stomach. A complete knowledge of
chemistry and basic biology are also necessary requirements
for a successful pharmacist.

 

FROG DISSECTION absorbs the interest of two intent pharmacy stu-
dents. Laboratory work, an integral part of their course of study, calls
for many hours of tedious concentration.

idea man...
the Keller gearbook
representative

 

DONALD J. MESSINGER

To the casual reader a yearbook is often simply an
“album” of pictures with accompanying identi-
ﬁcations and enough written text to ﬁll up the re-
maining holes on the pages. Merely ink on paper
. . . though nice to own and enjoy.

But to the staff and the adviser the yearbook
means much more. For yearbook work comprises
a multitude of details: Layout, Art, Photography,
Copy, Typography, Covers and Binding (not to
mention the small detail of money—raising).
Highly technical and often confusing, these details
are at the very least time-consuming and a source
of anxiety to a staff unless the publisher’s repre-
sentative is company—trained to give needed help
and suggestions.

All representatives for Wm. J. Keller Inc. are
skilled in the many facets of yearbook work, hav-
ing at their ﬁnger—tips the answers to yearbook
problems as well as a multitude of ideas for new
graphic arts special effects, to enable the staff to
produce a yearbook that is different and attractive.
Your Keller salesman is more than a technical ad-

viser, he is a “clearing-house” of yearbook ideas.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

It would be possible for me to write a book about my
experiences which I had while working with this OWL.
There were many times when I began to doubt if we
would make it through the year. Everything would be
going ﬁne until a camera broke, an appointment was
missed, or someone opened a ﬁlm holder with exposed
ﬁlm in it. Then the fun began. Telephone calls here,
errands there all took up time which was to be used in
putting the book together. At times lack of foresight
on the Editor’s part kept us from meeting the dead-
lines.

Although we had what seemed like more than our
share of ups and downs, we also had an equal number
of laughs and good times working together. Monday
and Wednesday night sessions and hours during the
day brought a wonderful crew to the OWL oﬂice . . .
a group that I shall never forget and one that made
work enjoyable.

DON, our faithful Associate Editor, never gave up
even when the deadline was so far overdue that it
would have ﬁtted nicely into the plans of next year’s
staﬁ". His cracks made me laugh no matter what went
wrong. BILL’s job of Photo Editor was mainly riding
herd on the largest crowd of shutterbugs the OWL
has ever seen. JACK, you were in on all the prelimi-
naries of planning these three hundred and twenty-
eight pages and were taken so rudely away from us to
serve in the Air Force as a 2/Lt. Thanks for spending
all the hours arguing with me over many cups of cof-
fee. And also thanks for leaving me with such a capable
man like MIKE to take over where you left off. BARB
handled the most tedious job of all——the typing and
without her this book would still be in production. Al-
though ELLEN had to take a lot of kidding about her
size, she managed to turn out a lot of good copy. With-
out her help I would have never been able to get the
writers to write. The Sports Editor this year was on loan
from the PITT NEWS and did a ﬁne job with his crew

from our “All American” newspaper. JACK, you really
handled that section like a professional. JUDY had a
bad time contacting all the seniors and making sure
that all the names were correct and matched with the
pictures.

As it is, space prohibits more than a mere mention
of some of the most loyal members of the staff. BILL,
MARTHA, DAVE, ELSA, JOEL, KATHY, and
JERRY were truly the ones behind the scene pulling
the strings. After working hard on last year’s book
RON and DIM came back, although graduated, and
helped us write the Intro—Section.

MR. ROTHMAN, thanks for all the help in dealings
with faculty and administration, and for the use of that
wonderful FM radio which put more pleasant sound
than the rattling of typewriters in our ears. MARIAN,
despite your getting married, I will still keep on ad-
miring you and your ability to put up with a crazy
group like us. Thank you, also, for straightening out
all the girlfriend problems I had. And now a very spe-
cial thanks to my “PAPPA und MAMMA” for putting
up with a son whom they only saw on an occasional
weekend, and then only for a very few hours.

It strikes me as remarkable that things turned out as
well as they did in creating a book that only existed
in one person’s mind. Well, RON, we are a couple of
has-beens and the worst is over. We can sit back and
think about the trips to Buffalo and Chicago and the
ACP jinx we never seemed to break and all the fun we
had getting excited about little things, all of which
counted.

And now the last page closes. All of the late hours,
the disappointing grades we carried home, and the three
hundred and twenty-eight pages of this book are be-
hind. I want to look ahead and say “Good Luck” to
Bill and Glenn and the rest of next year’s staff. Thank

ll ' .
youa again A

 

Without much question, 1960 can certainly be called
a banner year. We went through two of the most heart-
pounding events that one could ask for: a presidential
election and a Pittsburgh victory in the World Series.
Another major event in the breaking is the soon to be
released 1961 OWL.

A new face and a new name were added to the
Student Publications Office. MR. IRVING N. ROTH-
MAN became our new advisor and Marian Kielman
added a Mrs. to her name to become Mrs. Marian
Nehus. As long as I can remember MARIAN has been
the girl Friday to the OWL. Her duties performed for
the OWL have been invaluable. To her I wish to ex-
press my sincerest thanks.

Our staff has been somewhat reduced in comparison
with those of recent years. I have felt that this reduc-
tion has produced a closer and more harmonious en-
deavor. The key ﬁgure behind any organization is the
person who guides the ﬁnancial pen. LOU GRANDE
fulﬁlled this operation quite successfully. Being a fra-
ternity brother of Lou our relationship has been more
than just a business one. I have expressed my thanks
to him many times over.

One of the recent changes at Pitt has had a direct
effect on the yearbook——the kit-registration. Our sales
manager, GLENN GRAHAM, had the duty of con-
ceiving a new plan to sell yearbooks. Glenn appar-
ently clicked with the right combination because we
were able to match the sales record of the previous
business staffs. I am certain that Glenn will be success-
ful as next year’s Business Manager. Our sincerest
thanks for a job well done.

The feminine View was lacking on this year’s business
staff. MARY JANE POWELL and MARY BALLE-
RINI were student teaching. The many hours and con-
tributions made by these two in the past years have
certainly been appreciated. I wish them both every
success in their new ventures.

Last butlnot least, one of the most important ﬁgures
in the success of our yearbook has been the comptroller
of all the publications, GEORGE MCCLINTOCK. His
valuable tips and scope of experience have been most
rewarding to the success of the OWL.

I hope the 1961 OWL staff will be able to look back
and recall with happiness the events with our staff as I
have done. My sincerest wish for a most successful
publication and a prosperous year to next year’s staff.

During the sleep-robbed days and nights before
Homecoming endless hours are spent creating
paper mache ﬁgures, stuﬂing napkins in wire net-
ting, and keeping the ﬂoat design a closely guarded
secret. The weekend itself is the ﬂoat, the game,
the Queen, the dance and the all night parties
squeezed into three days when activity is the only
stimulant. Monday morning finds the weary stu-
dent back in class—the remnants of his eﬂorts in
the rubbish heap outside.


Whether they publish weekly, monthly, or yearly, the stu-
dents involved in publications have much in common.
Night lovers with a literary bent gather on the fourth floor
to spend long hours at the multitude of jobs necessary to

conceive, plan, and produce publications consistently on a
par with any in the country. Always there are leaden eye-
lids, neglected studies, and stinging criticism from a few
dissatisﬁed readers, yet these are of little importance; the
ﬁnished creation is its own reward.

Though the administrators would have it other-

wise, often more energy is channelled into extra—
curricular pursuits than into academics. Those
who find classes an inadequate outlet for their
drives and talents must seek further. Sports, dra-
matics, music, and politics fulﬁll the need for per-
sonality expression.

A unique opportunity to learn from many educated and
inﬂuential people is provided by the Midday Series, a pro-
gram which brings senators, ambassadors, authors and
philosophers to the University to speak. Afterwards a cof-
fee hour discussion prompts an exchange of ideas that
often broadens a student’s campus-limited world.

Students climbed over snowbanks,
slipped on the ice, and slogged
through ankle—deep slush pools to
classes where professors wearily ac-
cepted the snow as an excuse for
being late. Snowfall followed snow-
fall with a rapidity that was monot-
onous, covering the already snow
choked campus with more great
mounds of icy wetness. The pene-
trating chill lingered until the last
dirty patches of snow ﬁnally disap-
peared in the cold March rains.

Guiding the undergraduate
through four years of aca-
demic searching, the learned
man has a responsibility of
keeping his student’s initial
interest alive. It is a diﬂicult
and all encompassing job
with little reward except the
procession of men and wom-
en wearing black robes who
pass him on graduation day.

   



Every imaginable festivity is packed into seven days of madness
during the week of fraternity pins and white pass cards. Shrieks
and dances and contests pass by in staggering amounts and this
year, as a special highlight, the Brothers Four presented an eve-
ning of folk songs. The Greek watches weary eyed as another
event begins, summoning up new energy and a new excuse for
an unfinished homework assignment.

 

A hodge-podge decor, from low orange couches to
ornate gilt chandeliers, furnishes the marble halls
of the Student Union, née Schenley Hotel. The
range of activities it oﬂers is parallel, with quiet
corners for chess, luncheons in the first ﬂoor dining
rooms, and jazz sessions on the patio. Residents
and commuters alike appreciate the relaxed atmos-
phere, from the carpeted quietness of the lounges
to the piped-in music in the Hunt Room.


  
 
 
  

   is the record and story of a year at the University of Pittsburgh. it does more
than list prosaic images. it selects from the frivolous and the scholarly, the modern and the ivy—cov—
ered, the crowd and the quiet. It is the view from within.

   records formal accomplishments but does not neglect the singular moments
of personal triumph which make an effort worthwhile. It makes a red-pencil  a pat on the back, a
game—winning field goal all part of our pictorial record. It views events in their entirety but stresses
particular instances, and so reflects the spirit of this University.

   tells a story of students and faculty. It pictures them in individual pursuits,
both academic and social. It shows them as individuals and as integrals in the relationships that
begin in crowded lecture halls, form in private office conferences, and deepen, sometimes, into friend-
ships.

Hurrying to class on what seems to be a typical
gray Monday morning in March an Arts stu-
dent notices bright green paper derbies, cocked
at jaunty angles, upon the heads of certain stu-
dents and knows that it is Engineers Week again.
He smiles, but otherwise ignores that which is
important to the Engineers—the parades, the
arrival of St. Patrick, the departmental exhibits
in those buildings somewhere up on the hill.

Most of all, Greek life is friendship. There are the
late “ball” sessions, the formals, and meetings
which create a sincerity through living with, and
being constantly near people. Utter frankness is
necessary if one is to compete with his brother and
for him. Fraternity and sorority life is a dedication
to something idealistic which is passing, yet leaves
a mark for a lifetime.

Eating places in Oakland are as varied as the stu-
dents’ pocketbooks. They range from the stand-up-
and-stuﬁ‘-yourself informality of the hot—dog shops
to the pompous plushness of the Park Schenley.
The student must tread the thin line between com-
fort and budget and choose a restaurant where din-
ing is neither a ﬁnancial nor a gastric disaster.

Weeks before election day arrives enthusiastic can-
didates are busy petitioning students for nomina-
tions. Political parties are formed and dissolved
daily while candidates aﬁﬁliate haphazardly with
one party and then with another. Presidential can-
didates debate the major campus issues and cam-
paign workers hang posters in strategic corridors.
On election day anxious candidates are still drum-
ming up additional support and urging the student
body to get out and vote.

Large numbers of foreign students attend the University in a mutually beneﬁcial ex-
change of ideas and customs. Indian saris and Japanese kimonos are as much at home
on campus as sweaters and plaid skirts. After the barriers of language disappear the
foreign student becomes a personality long remembered by the Pitt undergraduate.

The student spends the majority of his time outside
of the classroom studying. He works on his lengthy
research paper in the Library, reads a chapter as-
signment in the Commons Room, practices his
French accent in the Tuck Shop, and experiments
long hours in the laboratory. This learning process
never stops, regardless of where the student goes
or what he does.

The years the individual spends as a
student pass within a sheltered place.
There is work to be done and empathy
cultivated among friends, but, for the
most part, the mundane world is
screened out. The student is protected
not that he may draw an untroubled
breath, but that he may shape original

thoughts to enhance his intellectual
maturing.

Those who have achieved academic excellence are
recognized once a year at the Honors Convocation.
A yellow lapel ribbon and their name in a printed

program seems little enough to do for those who
uphold the ideals of the University.

Spring temperatures drew students
in shirt sleeves from classrooms to
the benches of Lilly Court; they
came from their dormitory rooms to
the Cathedral lawn. In the late
afternoons, the Quadrangle pro-
vided a more convenient lounging
area. Leaning back on her metal
porch chair, there, a coed could
catch a quick wink ‘from the bicy-
clist turning past her.

Once each spring the students pause to select
from their number those few who through their
services to the University have brought them-

To the civilian, the ROTC man is
distinguishable by his neatly pressed
uniform, his meticulous salute, and
his jaunty air of casual authority.
To the girls, watching fascinated
from a Cathedral window, the serv-
ice man is an interesting hero who
helps raise the flag on weekday
mornings. To the miniature soldier
however, ROTC is a diﬁﬁcult course
of tedious drills and sharpened wits.
Often, notice from the females and
witty remarks from his friends on
the sidelines are his only rewards.

To the careless observer, Oakland streets in the daytime
appear to be like those of any other cultural center. But
on a closer look one sees the tell tale signs of the nearby
University: brass buttoned blazers displayed with Madras
shorts and sneakers, posters advertising low price hair-

cuts, and three busy bookstores.

Oakland at night provides diversion for the students. The Strand is there for the
movie bugs, the Bookcenter for the hungry—minded, and a plethora of bars for
the thirsty. And for the hand-clutching couples, those for whom college has be-
come suddenly more meaningful, there are deserted concrete walks, grassy
lawns, and dark quiet places.

Besides cramming for ﬁnal
exams, the Pitt student must
still attend his regular classes
and turn in last minute term
papers. Bleary—eyed and un-
shaven he sits restlessly in
the classroom, anxious for
the moment when he can
hurry to the Tuck Shop and
a last minute look at his
notes. Draining coffee, tak-
ing No—Doze, grabbing sleep
when and if he can, he en-
vies the well prepared schol-
ar who has the time to read
the newspaper, and the ones
who always have time for
bridge.

The last day comes quickly in the confu-
sion of ﬁnal exams, last—minute packing
and summer job interviews, and goodbyes
are said hastily or not at all. Cars, some
with out-of-state license plates, pull into the
Quadrangle daily and are loaded with
everything from stuﬁed giraﬂes to Picassos.
Some remain for the spring trimester, a
little lonely on the half-deserted campus.

A weekend for much needed sleep and the pressure builds again

with the start of the spring term. Most of the classrooms are
empty this time and even the usually crowded Tuck Shop is half
closed oﬁ‘ by green bench barriers. Classes are small and relaxed
and attention often wanders to the sunny lawns where students
with free time can study and dream.

Long after the Winter Trimester has ended and the June sun warms the
stone walks, Graduation Day dawns once again. The graduates return
for a day of festivities, greeting friends, and one last look at the chapel
in the sunset. Then they realize that they never again can be a part of
Pitt as they once were.

owlettes

An Owlette is more than just
pretty. More than beauty she has
a spirit of commaraderie that
places her above the casual Owl
oﬂice visitor or the yearly sub-
scriber.

Doing her share of the work,
she combines a sense of humor
with the tact necessary in the
awkward situations that arise
during “High School” Publica-
tions Day.” She is found sipping
Coke in the Tuck Shop, dancing
in the Student Union or pounding
a battered typewriter to help
meet a deadline, while dawn
breaks over Schenley Park.

ORGANIZATIONS


activities

Total individual developed

The purpose of any university is to develop and encourage the
three traits of an individual which are most essential to his future
success——intelligence, training, and personality. Although the ﬁrst
two traits are obtainable in the student’s academic life, the latter
one cannot be learned in any classroom. A student’s active partici—
pation in the many activities offered by the University of Pittsburgh
is one of the best ways to cultivate this intangible thing called per-
sonality. In order for an individual to be a successful member of
any activity, he must also learn to budget his time to obtain a
healthy balance in his student life academically, organizationally,
and socially—all of which are necessary to insure his success when
his days as a student are ended.

Besides playing a major part in developing the total individual,
activities make many contributions to the University itself. Organi-
zation such as the band, choral groups, athletics, and publications
do much to further the name of Pitt both in the Pittsburgh area
and across the country.

Thus, activities, because of their role both in developing the
total individual and in contributing to the University, are a vital
part of student life at Pitt.

Air Force ROTC

AFROTC means hard work and study
for the cadet, with complicated courses
in air navigation, military aviation, air
base functions, and global geography of-
fered, all of which prepare him for the
role he must play in America’s growing
air power. The cadet also learns how to
give and take orders on the Drill Field.

Socially the cadets co—sp0nsor the Mili-
tary Ball and hold an annual Parents’
Night program.

Army ROTC

The Army Reserve Officer Training
Corps provides future oﬂicers for the
United States Army by offering govern-
ment sponsored military training at the
University level, but under the control of
the Army Department. The present cur-
riculum, however, is not pointed to any
particular type or branch of the Army.
Pershing Riﬂes and Scabbard and Blade
are honorary military organizations which
aid in the development of the military
cadet—special features of the ROTC.
The annual Military Ball, held in con-
junction with the Air Force ROTC, is the
social highlight for the Corps of Cadets.

Associated Women Students

The governing body for women on Pitt’s campus is the
Associated Women Students. All full—time, undergradu-
ate women are members of this association. Operating
through three governing bodies, the Executive Board,
Senior Court, and Commission, A.W.S. co—ordinates all
women’s activities on campus. They strive to bring all
women’s interests from athletic organizations to class
councils and choral groups to a common understanding.
A.W.S. women serve as hostesses not only at University
events, but as hostesses to new students. They welcome
the new freshmen women at an impressive Lantern Night
ceremony in September. Throughout the year, they help
transfer students become acquainted with Pitt. The
women serving on the various committees of the Associ-
ated Women Students also make available a tutoring serv-
ice and an Activities Fair._In all their work on campus,
A.W.S. makes stronger the role of the University women.

Block P

At ha1f—time, when the bands march on
the ﬁeld, the Block “P” card section en-
tertains Visitors across the ﬁeld by hold-
ing up colored ﬂash cards. In the 1,150
seat section students ﬂashing the colored
cards form a variety of patterns. The re-
sponsibility for the cards and the design-
ing of the patterns rests with Block “P”
leaders, Mary Grace Mackenzie, Torn
Auten, Ann Saxman and their committee
of row leaders. Block “P” not only pro-
vides Pitt Visitors with entertainment, but
also forms the nucleus of the student
cheering section at the games.
