DEDICATION

FTO RICHARD BEATTY MELLON

§  E dedicate our Owl to you. You
are President of the Mellon National Bank. In

industry and ﬁnance you stand in the small top
group of the Nation. As a student at the Univer-
sity, Class of ’75, you were known as Dick. But
our interest here is in your character. Subtle in
happy humor, kind, and always modest, you have
remained a boy. You seem never to have got over
a surprise at ﬁnding so lovely a world in which to
live. That world was and is Pittsburgh; and what
you count as achievement in living is to stir this
surprise in others, to cause others to feel its
rhythm, color, design, and results. No one else
has cared so much for Pittsburgh. Vastly more
than most of us know, we have in Pittsburgh, be-
cause of you, better hospitals, wider streets, more
inspiring architecture, better city planning, more
sensitiveness to things spiritual, more sunrise in
faces on our streets, more industrial progress and
relief of man's estate through theMellon Institute,
and best of all, a better University of Pittsburgh.

We are glad and proud to dedicate our
Owl to you.

PRIMARILY southern in membership, 26 of the 33 Circles having been es     tablished in colleges and universities below the Mason-Dixon Line, Omicron
Delta Kappa, national honorary men's activities fraternity, has grown in accord
with a welldefined policy. Alpha Circle founded at Washington and Lee University in 1914, debated upon the idea of national expansion. Finally, in May,
1916 it admitted Johns Hopkins as the Beta Circle. Recognizing the qualities
of a third petitioning group, the national circle was expanded to include Gamma
Circle of the University of Pittsburgh on June 9, 1916. The basic and fundamental ideals and purposes that characterize the circles of today are:
        "To recognize men who have attained a high standard of efficiency
    in college activities, and to inspire others to strive for conspicuous at    tainments along similar lines; to bring together the most representatve
    men in all phases of collegiate life; and to bring together members of
    the faculty and student body on a basis of mutual interest and under    standing."
    Gamma's roster has grown from 10 founders to 285, active, alumni, faculty,
and honorary members. Imposing rigid requirements based upon outstanding
participation in one or more of the five phases of collegiate life-Scholarship,
Athletic Prowess, Social Leadership (including conspicuous service to Alma
Mater), Publications, Forensic and other Non-athletic Activities-Gamma seeks
to choose only those men who measure up to the general ideals of the fraternity.

        SOPHOMORE HONORARY ACTIVITIES FRATERNITY
                       Founded at Penn State in 1907
A BOUT two thousand years ago a religious cult called the Druids spread
       over central Europe and the British Isles. In 1907 a group of prominent
sophomores at Penn State decided to revive the memories of the race and accordingly, The Druid Fraternity was founded as a national honorary fraternity
for distinguished sophomores in the field of College activities. In 1920 the
fraternity came to Pitt as the Delta Chapter of Druids. Druids also maintain
Chapters at Washington and Jefferson, Carnegie Tech, Delaware, Alabama,
Bucknell, and Franklin and Marshall.
    The purpose of the Fraternity is to stimulate interest in activities and to
give due recognition to those Freshmen who have been outstanding in the University activities. The first qualification of Druids is scholarship. The Druids
feel that men of a high mental calibre are more capable of fulfilling the purposes of the Fraternity. The second requirement is activities. The Druids are
interested in men who have constructively participated in 2 or 3 activities
and who have been outstanding in these. Even if a man had all these qualifications and lacked character he would be held ineligible. The Druids measure
character in terms of "Pitt Spirit". Thus by drawing membership from outstanding Freshmen, the Druids believe they can more fully realize their principles and traditions.
                                                                          Druids

     Club was organized in 1926 to amalgamate into a fraternal group all members
who have given at least two years of meritorious service to Cap and Gown. Through
their contact with the faculty and other
students, the members of the club aim to
help in promoting a more intense and loyal
interest in Cap and Gown productions. To
aid in the accomplishment of this ideal, the
club sponsors social functions, including
smokers and dances, which students may
attend.  This year, the club  sponsored
afternoon  dances during   the rehearsal
period to promote fellowship and interest
among the members taking part in the Cap
and Gown show.

"K  APPA PSI, pharmaceutical fraternity, was founded at the Medical College
     of Virginia on December 15, 1879. The organization \was the first Greek
letter society established in the Colleges of Pharmacy in the United States. It
is strictly a pharmaceutical fraternity which limits its chapters to colleges of
pharmacy holding membership in the American Association of Colleges of Pharmacy. There are two classes of chapters, namely college and graduate.
    The Beta Kappa chapter of the University of Pittsburgh is a collegiate
chapter and was founded in 1900 and installed as Beta Kappa of Kappa Psi on
March 26, 1913. The Chapter House is located at 258 Bellefield Avenue.

HONORARY SCHOLASTIC FRATERNITY

                                           OFFICERS
T   HE   object of Pi Tau Phi, honorary
     scholastic fraternity, is to unite into a
fraternity those students who have, by their
scholastic attainments at the University of
Pittsburgh, shown themselves to be capable of
intellectual achievement. Until this year, this
fraternity has extended membership to eligible
students of all the students of the Universitty.
Inasmuch as such a heterogeneous group resulted from this selection and inasmuch as
each of the several schools of the University
has its own professional fraternity, it was decided to restrict membership to members of
the college only. Hereafter, the fraternity
has reason to expect a more consolidated,
homogeneous group.

ATTEMPTED TO SELECT VIEWS WHICH
TRULY EXPRESS THE SPIRIT OF THE

GLORIOUS DAYS NEVER TO BE FORGOTTEN.
THE BUILDINGS HOLD FOR US MEMORIES
OF THINGS DONE IN OUR TOO BRIEF
SCHOOL YEARS. WE REGRET LEAVING
THEM, BUT KNOW THAT WHEN WE RETURN
IN THE FUTURE, WE WILL FIND THEM JUST
A BIT MORE MELLOW, MORE OVERGROWN
WITH IVY, AND THE MERE SIGHT OF THEM
WILL REVIVE FOR US THE THINGS THAT

  This year the 1932 Owl has tried
to enclose within its cover as faithfully as possible a history of the activities of the members of the senior
classes at the University. We have
tried to present a graphic picture of
the student after he lays aside his
books to take part in the extra-curricular program of the University.
  Perhaps you will wonder why we
have not used a "theme" in planning
our Owl. We of the staff have felt
that the most effective way of buildBusiness Manager
ing a year book is to make it as simple
as possible, to avoid all superfluous
material, and so the keynote of the
1932 Owl is simplicity in style and in
layout.
  We of the Executive Board take
this opportunity to thank all of the
members of the editorial and business
staffs for their cooperation.  This
year's staff has been a small one, but
we feel that it has done the work required of it in an efficient and praiseworthy manner.

        W      HEN   activities were still groping about to find their place in the life
                at the University, a monthly magazine, The Courant, made its
        appearance. A few years later Frank C. Stewart, conceived the idea that a
        weekly paper should supplant this monthly publication. The Pitt Weekly
        was organized.

        IN the first days of its existence, the staff obtained regular exercises in
           trying to locate a room in which to pursue its journalistic proclivities.
        \n early edition of the Owl adds, "The cubs might be seen spilling ink on
        the roof of Thaw Hall or in the cellar of State, but those good old days passed
        and the staff entered the commodious quarters of Thaw Hall."
           Later the W\eekly was issued from headquarters at Frick Acres and three
       years ago moved to its present office in the Activities Building.
           The Weekly is distributed each Friday morning in all schools of the
       University. It serves as the medium for informing students and faculty
       members about the cirriculum, activities and the social life of the campus.
            A distinct honor was won by the Weekly in October, 1931, when it was
       awarded a trophy by the Intercollegiate Newspaper Association of the
       Middle Atlantic States for being judged the leading paper from         point of
       make-up and news coverage. At the same time, the Weekly was awarded a
       second place cup for its editorial policy.

T   HE history of the Pitt Panther, official humorous and feature magazine of
     the University, began just about 19 years ago. Offices were first in State
Hall, later in Alumni Hall, later still on Frick Acres. Today, the Panther den
is located upstairs in the Activities Building, where the gay walls, decorated with
a many colored coat of covers from the comic magazines of many other universities lend a distinctive atmosphere.
    During the last four years, the Panther staff has never been beyond the sound
of riveting hammers. While located at Frick Acres, the steel framework of the
Cathedral of Learning was being fastened together and when progress demanded the demolition of the old mansion, and the staff moved to the present
office in the Activities Building, the noisy racket followed them still while the
Falk Clinic and the new Presbyterian Hospital were under construction.

            During the past school year, the staff published the usual quota of their
        sprightly issues. In September, a program       for the Pitt-Miami game, with a
        Freshman flavor; in October, a Football Number and the program          for the Pitt        Western Reserve game; in November, a Literary Number, which revived the
        tradition of a literary publication at Pitt; and in December, a Christmas number.
            In the New Year, the January issue was a Junior Prom number, the Pitt
        Panther's first issue in honor of a dance; the February issue was a Wittier num        ber; the March issue, a Military Ball number, as a special advance feature of
        the year's biggest social event; the April issue, an Exchange number, gathering
        together in one issue the best fun and cartooning from all other college comics;
        the May issue, with which was combined the Cap and Gown program; and for
        June, to interest the Seniors a graduation number.

P ITT Panhellenic Association has since
     its inception in 1915 been the vital factor in promoting inter-fraternity loyalty
and co-operation among the women of Pitt
and encouraging an intelligent interest in
fraternity problems. There are seventeen
women's fraternities enrolled in Pitt Panhellenic; sixteen of these are national organizations and thirteen are members of
the National Panhellenic Congress.
  Panhellenic Council, the executive body
of Panhellenic Association, consists of an
active voting representative and apprentice
representative from   each women's fraternity. It makes such rules as are necessary
for the finest interfraternity relationships.

ORIGINALLY the Student Senate, the group now known as Student
      Council was in 1924 the Men's Self Government Association. This organization did not meet the needs of both men and women students; so it was
changed once more into its present form-representing both the men and women
on the campus. The council is composed of sixteen members of the student
body, eight Juniors and eight Seniors, with two women from each class. The
Student Council meets twice a month, at which time the various committee
chairmen present reports. These committees include Student Relations, constitution, assemblies, finance, elections, investigations, and tradition. Officers
of the Council are elected internally. At the end of the term no more than
four Junior members are elected internally to act as Senior Counsellors for
the next year. Other members are elected in the Spring at the general campus
elections.

THE first interfraternity organization on the campus was formed in 1914
     and steadily gained in importance and prestige. This body was known as
the Interfraternity Conference and operated in the same manner as the present
Council. However, the World War interrupted the work of this group, causing a temporary cessation of its activities. After the war, a new group was
organized and given the name of Interfraternity Council.
    This year, the Council sponsored an Interfraternity Conference, at which
representatives from Pitt, Carnegie Tech, Washington and Jefferson, and Penn
State were present at business conferences and social events; the Interfraternity
Pledge Banquet, an innovation in Council affairs, with Milton Shore, of Phi
Epsilon Pi, as chairman; and the Interfraternity Ball, with Daniel Butler, of
Sigma Alpha Epsilon, as chairman. The nationally known Isham Jones band
played for the latter affair.
    The Council holds monthly dinner meetings at the respective chapter
houses. Among the events sponsored by the Council are tennis, horseshoe,
basketball, bridge tournaments; sweepstakes; and track meet.

E VERY woman regularly enrolled in
     the University automatically becomes
a member of the Women's Self Government Association. The purpose of the Association is "to foster a spirit of unity and
loyalty to the University of Pittsburgh; to
maintain high standards of academic and
social life by increasing the sense of individual responsibility, and to regulate all
matters pertaining to the student life of its
members."
  The Women's Self Government Association was established at Pitt in 1921 when
the women adopted a constitution, with
Dean Amos as their faculty advisor. Since
then the organization has grown to include
all women students at the University and
has become a member of the national
organization of college \~.S.G.A.'s.

E   DUCATION which sharpens the tools of mental achievement without in     fluencing the motives behind their use may be a great evil as well as a
great good. The Y.M.C.A. aims to put before a large group of Pitt students
those motives and purposes which make for a sincere and authentic insight
powerful and useful enough to give practical help for satisfactory personal
life and better social order.
    There are two main types of activities: clubs and projects. These groups
usually meet for lunch and are addressed by faculty and outside speakers. These
meetings afford students a variety of stimulating social, spiritual and intellectual
contacts.
    There are a large number of campus-wide projects which are set up to
give all students an opportunity to work with some vital piece of work. Some
of the projects undertaken by students are World Education, Religious Study
Groups, and Social activities. These projects have brought to the campus
famous lecturers and have provided a large group of students and faculty
members with some of the most helpful experiences of University life.

"9TX  TE, the members of the Young Women's Christian Association of the
   VV University of Pittsburgh, unite in the desire to realize full and
creative life through a growing knowledge of God.
        We determine to have a part in the making of this life possible for all
             people.
        In this task we seek to understand Jesus and to follow Him."
    This is the purpose which the University of Pittsburgh's Young Women's
Association strives to follow.
    The Y.W.C.A. program this year has been a varied and extensive one and
some of the outstanding features of the program were the Fall Retreat at Oglebay Park with Dr. Paul Jones, in October; a Disarmament Conference led by
Kirby Page in November; a Campus Poll on Disarmament in December and a
Model Disarmament Conference in January to which twelve colleges sent delegates, each college representing a nation. The Association also cooperated with
the groups at P.C.W. and C.I.T. on the first Y.W.C.A. Student Industrial
Conference program.

IN 1919, women's athletic activities were organized for the first time on Pitt
   Campus under the name of Women's Athletic Council. In 1921 there was a
reorganization and the name was changed to the Women's Athletic Association. The purpose of the organization is to foster clean sportsmanship and to
promote higher physical efficiency among the women at the University of
Pittsburgh.
    In the spring of 1927, the Pitt co-eds held their first Play Day. An equal
number of representatives from all the institutions of collegiate rank in this
district took part. The girls were placed upon teams irrespective of schools.
These teams competed with one another in every form of sport or play, with
the girls playing either individually or as teams. At the end of the day a formal
banquet was held and the winning team rewarded. The purpose of Play Day
is to eliminate inter-collegiate competition and to foster a spirit of play, and
so successful has it been that it is now eagerly awaited by all women students
at the university.

T   HE American Society of Mechanical Engineers was founded in New York
     in 1880. The purpose of the society is to promote engineering education,
research and friendly intercourse among engineers. Since its foundation, the
society has expanded until now it\boasts a membership of 19,149 with branches
in 55 countries. In 1908 the society began the formation of student branches
in recognized engineering schools throughout the country, for the purpose of
helping the student engineer and assimilating him into the engineering world.
The University of Pittsburgh branch was founded with this purpose in mind,
and holds weekly meetings in which prominent engineers of the district tell of
engineering practice in industry.
    Among the honorary members are Herbert Hoover, the late John A.
Brashear, Charles M. Schwab, the late Thomas A. Edison and the late George
Westinghouse.

THE American Institute of Electrical
     Engineers was organized at the University as a student branch of the parent
association and  constitutes the general
seminar of the Electrical Engineering Department. A considerable number of these
student branches have been    established
throughout the country.
  The purpose of the organization is to
Foster interest in engineering organization
and to provide a means for the discussion
of technical subjects not covered in the
classroom. Regular meetings are held once
a week at which time the students themselves prepare talks. Occasionally a prominent engineer is secured to address the
selinar.

THE College Association, due to a well
     balanced  and   attractive program, is
again meeting with the success that has attended it since its organization three years
ago.
  The Association follows a definite program
of social events, planning two informal gatherings and one formal dance each semester.
The first semester's formal was held in the
holiday spirit of Thanksgiving Eve. In the
second semester a St. Patrick's Day formal
was held.
  The Association was organized with a twofold purpose in view. It hopes that a greater
unity of ideas and increased progress may be
attained. In addition to the social interests,
the Association has established a Student
Loan Fund from which any junior or senior
in the College may receive aid.

PITKIN Club, the first religious group
    on the campus, has been a factor in
student life since 1914. The aim is to
acquaint students with the various mission
fields and their needs, and to promote interest in Christian work. Campus problems
and remedies, missionary work, the Bible,
and current political interests have formed
the basis of study in past years. This year
the club is investigating problems such as
disarmament, the war debt, Jesus and
Money, the Meaning of the Cross, and like
questions. The group meets every Friday
noon at the Shadyside Presbyterian Church,
and after luncheon the meeting is open for
discussion.

T   HE   American iMNanagement Associa     tion was organized as a forum for the
discussion of purely management problems. Its purpose is to secure in management the same scientific treatment of its
problems as in the older branches of engineering. Its officers have always been
leaders in the field of management. To secure the greatest effectiveness in its work,
the membership    has been   divided into
seven sections,-Consumer Marketing, Financial, Industrial, Office, Personnel, Production, and Shop Management.
  The student section at Pitt was chartered
by the National Association in September
1929. It is conducted as a departmental
seminar and meets every Thursday during
the academic year in Room 102, State Hall.

T   HE purpose of the Men's Debating Association is to give students ex     perience in discussing subjects of current interest before audiences at home
and abroad. To this end, the manager and his assistant arrange an extensive
schedule of debates. This season the debaters have participated in approximately
fifty-five debates with every member of the Association having the opportunity
to appear in several matches.
    The home schedule is composed predominantly of extension debates in
which two teams from the University debate before local business Men's clubs,
high schools, church groups, voters' leagues, Y.M.C.A.'s and Y.M.H.A.'s. In
addition to these debates, there are about a dozen home intercollegiate contests
with University teams from all parts of the United States.
    The two feature trips of the year were the Southern and Western trips.
On the Western Trip, Cyril Jacobs and Samuel Strauss, accompanied by Doctor
Parrish traveled to the Pacific Coast debating twenty-one times in a period of
twenty-five days. John P. Bracken and William Butterbach handled the Southern Trip participating in nine debates. These trips are the reward of conscientious work and ability in debating.

        THE Women's Debating Association was organized in October, 1921, and,
             during that season, engaged in one intercollegiate debate. During the past
        eleven years it has steadily increased its program, and this year its schedule
        has included eleven intercollegiate debates, ten additional extension debates, and
        six freshman debates. Collegiate debates at home were held with Ohio Wesleyan
        University, George Washington University, Seton Hill College, and West Vir        ginia University. Swarthmore College, Trinity College, George Washington
        University, University of Richmond, William and Mary College, State Teachers
        College of Virginia, and New York University were met on an extensive road
        trip.
            This season's program has been developed to carry out the major purposes
       of the association which are to give experience in discussion of important
       questions to as many girls as possible; to bring the discussion of timely topics be       fore interested groups on and off campus; and to foster debates with students
       from other colleges.

HE John Marshall Club was organized
     in November, 1909 at the University of
Pittsburgh as an honorary pre-legal society
for the purpose of providing a forum for the
discussion of legal matters of the day. The
club had unlimited success from its date of
organization to the opening of school in 1929
when it was temporarily inactive on the campus. It was reorganized in the fall of 1930
and has enjoyed a prosperous life ever since.
  The aim of the club is to give active prelegal students a non-technical introduction to
legal procedure.
  A precedent was set this year by the members bringing prominent speakers in the field
of law to the meeting to discuss legal matters
and to acquaint the future lawyers with the
hardships and   glories of the practicing
attorney.

        ORGANIZED as an independent group in September, 1927, previous to which
             it was part of the Combined Musical Clubs, the Men's Glee Club is the
       oldest non-athletic activity on the campus.
            The purpose of the organization has always been to stimulate interest in
       music among students and to give those with talent the opportunity to cultivate
       their voices. Gold keys are awarded for four years service in the organization.
            Carrying out a varied program of activities, which has characterized the
       "work of the Glee Club throughout its existence, the organization has given con       certs in high schools, churches, clubs, and has sung over the radio. This year
       they sang at Pennsylvania College for Women, Perrysville M. E. Church, the
       Chancellor's Reception for Parents of Freshmen, and at Jeannette, in addition
       to the annual home concert at Carnegie Music Hall. On these occasions a skill       fully blended selection of classical, sacred, and semi-popular numbers is presented.

T IE Women's Glee Club is one of the oldest women's organizations on the
     campus, and has always been one of the University's most prominent and
successful activities. The purpose of this organization is to foster the appreciation of music among the students of the University; to afford women an
opportunity for some formal training in singing; to provide music for campus
activities, and to give public concerts.
    Since its complete reorganization in 1922, the Women's Glee Club has
steadily increased in importance-there are now about eighty members in the
Glee Club. The Club has participated in radio programs upon several occasions, and has given a number of concerts in churches and schools in the surrounding towns of the Pittsburgh territory. The annual home concert is held
at Carnegie Music Hall. On these occasions a blended selection of classical
and songs of a lighter vein is given under the direction of Mrs. Robert 1D. Ayars.

THE University Symphony Orchestra is an outgrowth of the former Pitt
     Ensemble. It is the most recent of the musical organizations on the campus, having received its charter from the University in the fall of 1927. The
orchestra was created in response to a long felt need for an organization which
could supplement the Band and other musical activities.
    The Symphony Orchestra gave its first program before the Yuletide Festival in 1927. Its activities have grown since then to include appearances before Pitt Players, Assembly, and Commencement Exercises. During the past
season the Orchestra also gave a concert at the Children's Hospital.
    Professor Rocereto, a member of the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra, is
director of the Synmphony Orchestra as well as the Pitt Band.
    In addition to its musical activities the Symphony Orchestra held several
social functions.

 T   HE University Band had its origin at the Western University of Penn      sylvania in 1904 when the personnel of the organization consisted of eight
 young men whose official uniforms were made up of inexpensive caps. A few
 years later a uniform including derby and sweater was adopted.
     The Band is the first student activity on the campus and last to leave it.
 From Freshman Week, preceding the official opening of school, to activities in
 connection with Commencement in June, the Band is continually in service. It
 plays at all football games, pep meetings, student assemblies, and at nearly all
 the official functions of the University.
     The outstanding events in this year's history of the Band were the trips
to South Bend, Indiana, for the Notre Dame game and to Penn State. The
marching band of 125 pieces, which functioned during the football season, is
reduced to approximately forty, which plays at the annual home concert at
Carnegie Music Hall.

             N 1916, George M. P. Baird organized a little theater
             group to which he gave the name, THE PITT PLAYERS.
             With true little theater spirit, everyone in the group
             assisted in all phases of production. There was no
             star system and no cast was published. In 1922, Mrs.
Madge B. MacQueen was appointed director. Performances were
then given in the Heinz House where a moveable stage was constructed in 1923 by the technical staff which was organized the same
year under the direction of E. Willis Whited. By 1924, the PLAYERS
were so popular that
performances were held
two evenings instead of
one, and it was seldom
that people were not
turned away because of
packed houses. In 1927,
the late Walter G. Edmundson was appointed
director.  Jane Ellen
Ball then became director. In 1930, the department of English took
over the organization
and appointed Carl B.
Cass, a member of the
faculty, as director of
PLAYERS. In 1930, also,
William D. Carothers, E.E.,'26, was engaged to direct the technical
staff. All productions are now staged at the Y. M. and Y. W. H. A.
auditorium. Under Mr. Cass, the PLAYERS have made great progress.
The audiences have doubled since the policy of charging admission
was installed, and greater progress is being planned for the future.

            year's  Senior Announcements. De      signed in both white cardboard and blue
      leatherette, the announcements bore a sil      houette reproduction of the University of
      Pittsburgh's symbol, the Panther, and the seal
      of the University on the cover. A full view
      of the Cathedral appeared on the front page
      of the   booklet.   Administrative officers,
      Senior Committees, a list of graduates and
      their degrees, the events of the University's
      Spring Festival, all appeared in this book.
      Also presented were interior views of the
      Cathedral which preceded vignettes of the
      Deans of the various schools. The Senior
      Announcements are the formal engraved invi      tations to the annual graduating ceremonies
      of the University of Pittsburgh which were
      held in the Stadium.

class, John W. Stirling was the recipient of the
University Award and the $100 honorarium
which goes with it. The University Award,
which is the continuation of the former George

To the Seniors:
U    NTIL   recently, graduation and commencement
      were words of general meaning only. Now as
June approaches they become particular and personal.
It is your graduation, your commencement. And what
does that mean? If graduated, to what will you be admitted, from what will you advance? If this day is a
commencement, what will you undertake? On this occasion your family will rejoice, your friends will be glad,
the University will be gratified, the state will be pleased,
you, yourself, will be happy.
    What occasions all these satisfactions? This: You
assume on this day guardianship of self. These your
guardians for many years are saying, "'We give you now
a noble trust, the guardianship of your own self. We
deliver you now to your own care, for we know of no one
fitter to be trusted than you. Preserve this person for
us, wise, noble, modest, unterrified, dispassionate, tranquil. And will you not then preserve him?"
    This then is the meaning of your graduation and
commencement.
                         Miss THYRSA W. Amos,

         SOPHOMORE HONORARY WOMEN'S FRATERNITY
               Founded at the University of Pittsburgh in 1923
 C   WENS, an honorary society for sophomore women prominent in extra      curricular activities was founded at the University of Pittsburgh in 1923
by Thyrsa W. Amos. Dean of Women. It became a national organization in
1925 and now has eight chapters in leading schools in the United States. The
purpose of the organization is to establish and maintain chapters at schools to
promote leadership, genuine interest in scholarship, and participation in student
activities. The Cwen insignia consists of a gold crown and sceptre with a small

Q    UAX, women's science fraternity, was
      organized at the University of Pittsburgh, for the purpose of inspiring and developing interest in general science among
its members and to foster among them a
spirit of good-fellowship. Those persons
who by the end of the first semester of
their sophomore year shall have shown
themselves to   be actively interested in
science, and who have achieved an average
grade of "B" in their major subject and a
general average of "C" are eligible. It is
the hope of Quax to some day become
affiliated with a national women's science
fraternity and this, at present, is one of its
chief aims.

held in the offices of Dr. -Will Grant Chambers, then dean of the School of Education
at the University of Pittsburgh. In July
1917 a Philadelphia group asked for a
meeting of delegates from all known groups
similar to Kappa Pi. At the convention
held at the University of Missouri in July,
the national fraternity  of Pi Lambda
Theta, in which Kappa Pi was to be Delta
chapter, was organized. By January of
that year, the required five chapters had
ratified the new constitution. Since then
through conservative but steady growth,
the fraternity has forty-one chapters.

MORTAR Board, senior honorary society for women, was founded on
      February 16, 1918 at Syracuse, N. Y. The University of Pittsburgh
chapter of Mortar Board existed previous to its affiliation with the national
organization in 1923 as Alpha Lambda Nu.
    The purpose of Mortar Board is; "To provide for the cooperation between
senior honorary societies for women, to promote college loyalty, to advance
the spirit of service and fellowship among university women, to maintain a
high standard of scholarship, and to stimulate and to develop a finer type of
college women."
    New members are elected to Mortar Board in the spring by unanimous vote
of the outgoing chapter from the undergraduates who will have completed their
junior year at the opening of the fall term. There is a definite scholarship
standard set by national Mortar Board which must be met by each candidate.
                                                               Mortar Board

                                           staff to Erie. Five instructors presented
                                           a program of academic work in afternoon
                                           and evening classes throughout the year.
                                           The University came to Erie at that time
                                           because of active encouragement given by
                                           the Education Committee of the Chamber
                                           of Commerce. The city of Erie showed
                                           its interest and appreciation of this work
                                           by the gratifying number of students that
                                           enrolled during the year. Encouraged by
                                           this popular response and still further
                                           supported by representative committees of
                                           the Chamber of Commerce and Board of
                                           Education, an expanded curriculum, in       cluding day college classes, was administered by the staff of twelve instructors
       that was added. Thus in September, 1928, the Charter Class of fifty-nine fresh       men brought into existence the Erie Junior College of the University of Pitts       burgh. Forty of the Charter Class returned as Sophomores, while the Fresh       men group consisted of one hundred and thirty-four students, making the en       rollment one hundred and ninety-four for the second year. This year the Erie
       Junior College includes two hundred and twelve men and women receiving in       struction from the resident staff of eighteen officers and instructors. Paralleling
       this growth in the Junior College division each year has seen an increasing num       ber carrrying on part time work in the Evening School with the gratifying total
       of over seven hundred students. Notwithstanding the youth of the Center the
       development of spirit and ideals is keeping pace with expanding numbers and
       equipment. Erie has taken the University as its own and shares wth the Uni       versity the brightest hopes for the future.

        T   HE Student governing body of the Erie Junior College is the Student Senate.
             It is composed of representatives, usually the president, of each of the
       officially recognized organizations of the school. This year there were twelve
       men, one girl, and one faculty member in the Senate. The duties of this body
       include the approval of the constitution of each of the societies connected with
       the Center and the supervision of all their social events. In cooperation with
       the administration, it provides lounge room facilities for the students and spon       sors such projects as are necessary to pay for them. Student conduct in and
       about the College is regulated by it. At the end of each semester it awards
       activity pins, by the point scale system, to those students who have been most
       deserving of them by their extra-curricular activities. The Student Senate, by
       its own success and by the efficiency with which it has supervised and aided the
       organizations of the school this year, has proven its superiority over the old type
       of Student Council, made up of direct representatives of the student body as
       a whole and without any regard for the individual organizations.

        THE University of Pittsburgh Dramatic Club was organized in 1929 in the
             Erie Center to promote an interest in dramatics among the students. Be       cause of the tardiness of its inception only one play was produced the first year,
       but last year it had an active and continuous program including several one act
       plays and the great success "The Best People" which was given at the Erie
       Playhouse on March 16, 17 and 18 to large audiences. This year interest had
       again lagged when the proposed production of Miss Lulu Bett was necessarily
       postponed several times and finally given up. However, one fine one act play was
       given in assembly by Lorenz Martin, Virginia Renz, Marie Smith, and Burton
       Brown.    The crowning achievement of three year's work was "Hay Fever"
       presented on April 22. All rehearsals have been conducted under the super       vision of Mr. J. Arthur Gordon. The play represents the work of the entire
       student body whose efforts whether they be selling tickets, ushering, advertising
       or acting have been whole-heartedly interested in this second large dramatic
       entertainment of their school.

THE 1932 OWL
                    HIS June marks the completion of the fifth year of history at
                    the Johnstown Junior College of the University of Pittsburgh.
                    Established in 1927 as an experiment in providing college work
                    in the local community and also as a venture in cooperation
        with a public school system, the plan has, on the whole, been very successful.
        The Junior College provides the curriculum of the first two years in the Col        lege, School of Engineering, School of Business Administration, and School
        of Education, for eligible persons in Johnstown and vicinity. The college is
        maintained through an agreement with the Johnstown Board of School
        Directors, whereby the University furnishes faculty and supervision while
        the school district furnishes space and equipment. The Junior College occu        pies parts of two floors in the splendid new Central High School building of
        Johnstown.
            During the five years, about 750 students have begun their college experi        ence in the Junior College. The average attendance has been more than
        200 throughout the ten semesters. The students have come not only from
        Johnstown but from a district having a radius of about twenty-five miles.
        This territory includes almost fifty communities in parts of five Pennsylvania
        counties.
             Most of these students are continuing in classes at Johnstown or have
        transferred to other schools. Of 271 who had continued beyond the two
        years work afforded at Johnstown up to the present year, 154 or 56%  had
        transferred to the main campus at the University, and the rest had trans        ferred to colleges, universities and teachers colleges scattered over the eastern
        part of the county from Maine to Texas and from Virginia to Michigan.
        Reports received from  these students and from  their schools indicate that
        they have done very well in scholarship and that they have been unusually
        successful in entering student activities at the schools to which transfer was
        made.
             At Johnstown, the students maintain a full program of student activities
        which includes eighteen to twenty groups in the average semester. A number
        of these student groups are pictured on the following pages.
             In addition to the Johnstown Junior College. the University conducts in
        Johnstown a large program of late afternoon, evening and Saturday classes
        and a branch summer session. During the session 1930-31, the total number
        of different persons taking class work through the Johnstown Center of the
        University was 1025. During the current session, steps have been taken to
        organize the evening student group so that there may be a student activities
        program for the part-time students as well as for the Junior College group.
        The program of the Johnstown Center is conducted through a resident staff
        of twenty-five members. The work of this group is supplemented by faculty
        members coming from the campus to teach evening classes.

        T HE discipline and order of the student body of the Johnstown Junior College
             are in the hands of the Student Council, a non--partisan organization con       sisting of ten student members-eight men and two women, and a faculty adviser,
       who is elected by Student Council, and, aside from advising the council, main       tains a relationship and understanding between the faculty and the students.
            Since the head of the college is a firm believer in student self-government,
       the Student Council has an unusual amount of authority and power. Besides
       being responsible for the general conduct of the students, the Council directly
       governs the fate of all extra-curricular activities, granting them permission to
       use the name of the college, directing their use of finances, and supervising the
       elections. Permission for any event must be granted from the council. Other
       important duties of the Council are the regulation of freshman customs, the
       appointment of a tribunal to enforce the customs, and the awarding of activities
       keys at the end of the year to sophomores who have been active in extra       curricular work.

S INCE the Women's Self Government Association was organized in 1927
    under the guidance of Dean T. Amos, it has grown in strength as the Jolhnstown Center has grown.
    The group aims to govern justly, to sponsor a true Pitt spirit, and to help
develop individual personalities. All the activities are planned by the Executive
Committee of the group, subject to the approval of the girls. They have made
a few necessary by-laws which are cheerfully obeyed. Merit Panthers are
awarded each year to the freshmen having sincere interest in the Junior College
activities and high scholastic standing. Individual personalities are developed
and social graces attained through a social program of teas, bridge parties, and
dances.

                     Uniontown Center
T    HE Uniontown Center of the University of Pittsburgh was established in
      1928 as the direct result of an educational survey of southwestern Pennsylvania made by the University the previous year. The Uniontown Board of
Public Education gave its whole-hearted cooperation by furnishing all the facilities and equipment while the University provided the faculty.
     The Center opened in September 1928 with one hundred and twenty freshmen students registered in the College, Schools of Engineering, Education, and
Business Administration. In the fall of 1929 the sophomore year was added.
This brought the Center to its full status as a junior college, offering the first
two years work in all schools.
     The facilities of the Center include almost the entire sixth floor of the
Second National Bank Building, the entire ground floor of the Ella Peach School
Building, and the gymnasium and pool of the local Y.M.C.A. All these buildings are located within the same city block.
    The enrollment for the year 1931-32 reached two hundred and fifty equally
distributed between the junior college and the late afternoon and evening classes,
with a faculty of twelve full time instructors.
    The activities at the Center have developed along lines similar to those on
the campus with the Student Self Government Association as the governing
body. All athletic activities are organized on the intramural basis and include
volley ball, basketball, swimming, wrestling, etc. Other activities are the D)ramatic
Club, Glee Club, Engineer's Club, Y Groups, W.S.G.A., and Center U News,
the bi-weekly student paper.

T   I-E Women's Self-Governing Association of the Uniontown Center was
     organized in October, 1928, with its primary purpose that of strengthening
and emphasizing the true Pitt spirit among all women students at the Center.
Notwithstanding the fact that this group faced many serious problems during the
first years of its existence, it has admirably succeeded in bringing together into
a harmonious group the coeds at Uniontown.
    The W. S. G. A. of Uniontown has developed an organization through which
many of the major social and extra-curricular activities of the school are carried
on.

       T HE judiciary branch of the Student Self Governing Association is the
            Student Senate, which consists of eight members, five sophomores and
       three freshmen. These members are elected by the student body at the beginning
       of each school year. From the five sophomores elected, the Senate elects its
       president, who automatically becomes a member of the Student Council.
           It is the duty of the Senate to enforce all laws of personal conduct, and it
       is in this connection that the freshman gains his first knowledge of the Senate
       which enforces freshman regulations. The Senate also investigates financial
       returns of the various committees; maintains order and cleanliness within the
       men's smoking room and locker room; handles any affair of conduct which arises
       concerning a student of the school; and must attempt to promote "fair play"
       among the student body. The Senate is the supreme law making body of the
       Uniontown Center and has always been respected as such.

 O   NE of the most active organizations of the Uniontown Center is the En      gineer's Club. This club made up of both Freshman and Sophomore
Engineering students takes the place of the Engineering Society on the main
campus of the University of Pittsburgh. Meetings are held every Wednesday
evening at which the members are given the chance to discuss different Engineering achievements. Numerous tours are taken during the year to places of
interest. At the end of the year a banquet is given to which outside speakers
are invited.
    It is the object of this club to further interest in Engineering throughout
the school and community. In the past it has been very successful and is now a
recognized part of the activities of the center.

THE 1932 OWL
       T   IIE 1931 football season opened with bright prospects for a powerful
            team. Only two regulars, Captain Eddie Baker, quarterback, and
       Franklyn Hood, fullback, had graduated and the entire 1930 line was back.
       Furthermore, it was an odd year, and Dr. Jock Sutherland, coach, has had
       striking success since he first came to Pitt in turning out great grid machines
       during the odd seasons.
           The first game was with Miami. Miami, an Ohio Conference team, came
       to Pittsburgh with an excellent record for previous seasons and highly touted
       as one of the toughest first game opponents Pitt had ever scheduled but
       faded away before the stronger Panthers and were crushed, 61-0.
           The Panthers next invaded Iowa and experienced little difficulty in
       sweeping the Hawkeyes before them, 20-0. Following this, the Pitt eleven
       smeared the West Virginia Mountaineers, and then crushed Western Re       serve, 32 0. The Panthers showed great power during these three games
       and were ranked by football critics as one of the most promising squads in
       the country.
           Now came one of the highlights of the schedule, the contest with Notre
       Dame at South Bend. The Ramblers had not yet been scored upon and only
       a 0 0 tie with Northwestern blemished their record. A brilliant aerial attack
       with \lMarchmont Schwartz as the thrower, furnished the source of Pitt's
       downfall. As far as the ground play was concerned, Notre I)ame displayed
       none too pronoitnced a superiority, the PIitt line being almost equal to that of
       the Irish, but the forward pass gave a satisfactory margin of difference for
       the victors. The final score was 25 12.
           After the Panther squad had journeyed to Penn State and won, 41 6,
       Pitt and Carnegie Tech came together for the city championship. Pitt en
       tered the game heavy fa vorites, but the Tartans put up an extraord(inar
       game fight, losing only 14--6. The Scots played aggressively but the sheer
       power and strength of the Panthers proved too great an obstacle for the
       Tartans.
           In the next game, that with Army, Bobby Ilogan was hurt early in the
       game and Rocco Cutri replaced him while Paul Reider, halfback, began to
       call the plays. Reider, always a daring player, immediately called for several
       forward passes and trick plays and brought the crowd to its feet by some
       exceptional work. WVith AWarren Ileller, and in one flashy play, Collins
       hurling, and Reider receiving, the Panthers completed enough forward tosses
       to change everyone's mind for the time being about the old reputation of the
       Pitt team as a non-forward passing aggregation.
                                                                Varsity Football

    The Panthers clicked on all fours in their Thanksgiving day battle
against Nebraska. The Cornhuskers arrived in Pittsburgh, widely heralded
as being big, smart, and smooth-working. Pitt pushed the ball up and down
the field, smothered every offensive move of its opponents, and altogether
gave a great demonstration.
    As per usual, Pitt was able to boast several stars of all-American calibre.
Jess Quatse and Jim MacMurdo were picked by most observers as being the
best pair of tackles in the East, and as equal throughout the country by only
three or four other players. Ralph Daugherty, who has received comment
ever since his sophomore year, also was picked on the first and second allAmerican teams of various boards and observers.
    Captain Eddie Hirshberg, who had not been a regular until his senior
year, was a popular and capable leader. Paul Reider and VIarren Heller dis
played classy footwork at the halfback positions.

THE 1932 OWL
        THERE are limits to the endurance of even super-durable basketball players,
             and the Pitt team of last season found that out.
             With co-captains Doc Kowallis and Tim Lawry, together with Don Smith
                                    and Bus Albright, as holdovers from the year be                                    fore and with Russ Ochsenhirt, Don Macamant,
                                    and Charley Hughes as additions from the 1930                                    31 freshman team, prospects at the start of the
                                    campaign were bright for the extension of the
                                    "long list of victories which the team had com                                    piled in the four previous seasons.
                                        Sickness, however, forced Albright to give
                                    up the sport; and the long jaunt to the coast, the
                                    longest  ever  made
                                    by a Pitt team, took
                                    all the reserve en                                    ergy the boys had
                                    with the results that
        they had little to carry them through the balance
        of the season after their erturn from the coast.
          Pitt looked great in its 29 21 victory over
        Temple in the season's opener, and then came the
        long 12 game trip to the Coast. A field goal from
        the center of the floor in the last thirty seconds of
        play gave Wisconsin a 30-29 victory over Pitt,
        but the Panthers came back the next (lay to win
        an extra period game against Indiana 29-24.
            After that came two straight losses at the hands of Purdue and Butler, two
        of the strongest collegiate teams in Indiana, the hot-bed of basketball in the
        country. A three game series with Kansas with the game falling on successive
        days was next on the program. In the two opening tilts, the Panthers were
        ahead until the final few minutes of play when the home team spurted to eke out
        close victories. The reverse was true in the final game when Pitt came from
        behind to score a last minute victory.
            Colorado fell next by the score of 25--23. The Panthers were scheduled to
       meet California, the cream of the West Coast, two days later but a sudden snow
       storm delayed the Panthers and the game was called off. Stanford, the next
       foe, fell easy prey to the Panthers, and then Southern California was added to
       the list of victims. The latter team, however, evened the count in the second tilt
       between the two fives and left the Pitt team with a record of five victories in
       eleven games on the trip.
            The wearied Panthers hopped a train Saturday night and arrived in Pitts        burgh the following Wednesday. After a day's rest and two practice sessions,
        they again boarded a rattler this time for Syracuse where they lost a 32-28
        decision.
            Duquesne, the next home foe, scored a victory over the Panthers to cele                                                                  Varsity Basketball

Doc Carlson decided that his boys needed a good rest so he called out some
football men who started the Panther's next game with New York University.
Pitt lost but the strain of endeavoring to maintain a winning record was removed, and the boys were in fine condition for their next game with Carnegie
l'ech.
    Pitt, and Johnny Brown in particular, surprised every one at the game and
the Panthers were returned easy victors by the score of 33-22. Notre Dame
repeated its football score victory over the Panthers in the first of the two cage
games between the two schools, 25-12. Then Pitt returned to its in and
out ways for the remainder of the season.
    Carnegie Tech fell in the seconl game of their series. Notre Dame came
to the stadium and repeated its earlier victory over Pitt. Georgetown and Navy,
two of the weakest teams in the East, defeated the Panthers, who then turned
around and trounced Creighton, one of the strongest teams in the mid west.
Western Reserve and Penn defeated the Carlson men in their next two starts
and then followed a string of four straight victories.
    Hlarvard succumbed on the Crimson court. Wash-Jeff offered Pitt little
opposition in the "West View Day" at the stadium. Penn State failed to realize
its dream of a victory over Pitt at State College, 36  32; and West Virginia
was forced to take the short end of the score for the second time that season.
    And then, just when the Panthers needed a victory in their final game with
Penn State here to end their season with.500 average, the Lions turned around
and won, 40--30.
    The Kowallis boys, Tim Lawry, Al Wrobleski, and Johnny Brown completed their allotted three years of varsity competition this year.

H     AVING the benefit of a good range from the start of the season, the Pitt
       rifle team enjoyed its greatest success since the inauguration of the sport
for inter-school competition. In thirty dual meets during the season, the riflers
were victorious in twenty-eight. One of the meets lost was by a one point
margin, while the score for the other was tied but due to the fact that Pitt's
opponents, Cornell, had a better score for the standing position, they were
awarded the meet.
    The string of victories was doubly sweet for numbering among the Pitt
victims was Carnegie Tech, which annually possesses one of the strongest teams
in the country and which has made a habit of beating Pitt rifle teams for the
past few years.
    The Panthers were off form in their sectional championship shoot at Cincinnati where they finished fourth in a field of seven entries. All three schools
which finished above the Panthers in this meet had previously bowed to them in
dual competition. The Panther score for this meet was the lowest of the season
with the exception of that compiled in the first match.
    Manager Spurgeon Weurtenberger, captain Harold Backen, and Robert
Wilson completed three years of competition this season. All three were high
scorers during the season and lead the other members of the team in the amount
of points scored. Walter Taussig and captain-elect Itrnest Mair were the other
lettermen who will be available for competition next year.
    In addition to these men, Charley Zoller and Clifford Franz, two men who
placed in many of the meets but not enough to earn varsity awards, will also be
back in harness. The schedule for next season will practically be the same as
that during the past season but coach Lieutenant Wilson hopes to establish a
better record with a winning habit now acquired by the team.
                                                                     Rifle Team

        D ESPITE the loss of Eddie Jacobs, number one singles player for the past
              three years and captain during his junior and senior years, Pitt's tennis
        team faces bright prospects for the present season. Billy Jacobs, brother of
        Eddie and a former national junior indoor singles champion, a sophomore at
        present is attempting to take Eddie's place; and he is being assisted by such stars
        as Nate Ganger, former Ohio interscholastic singles champion; Billy O'Lough        lin, twice winner of the Western Pennsylvania scholastic singles title; captain
        Edgar Alcorn; Woodsie Adler and Irvin Goodman, lettermcn for the past two
        years.
            This year's schedule calls for thirteen matches, ten of which are with dis        trict opponents. Duquesne, Carnegie Tech, Pethany, Washington-Jefferson, and
        Grove City are being met in home and home matches. The feature of the season
        is a three day Eastern trip which finds the Panther racqueteers meeting Navy
        on May 18, Georgetown on May 19, and Maryland on May 20. These three
        schools annually boast of some of the best squads in the East, and the Panthers'
        hopes to go through another undefeated season rest upon the results of their
        matches with these schools.
            Good tennis teams have been a tradition at Pitt ever since the advent of
       Dave and John O'Loughlin, brothers of Billy. Until their arrival, teams here
       were just so-so; but since that time, the Panthers have lost but one duel meet,
       that being a post-season affair with California three years ago.
            Prospects for good teams in years to come are also bright for Billy Jacobs,
       Billy O'Loughlin, and Nate Ganger, the three outstanding candidates for this
       year's team, are playing their first season of intercollegiate competition and will
       be on hand when coach Dr. MFclllroy issues the call for new candidates in the
       next two years to come. Major letters are awarded for participants in this sport.

          Cogswell, Mervis, Carik, Reilly, Szawzuk, Schmeiler,
        CONGRATULATIONS are in order for coach Pat Corr and his array of
             splashing stars for finishing another season with an undefeated record
        in dual meets.
            The Pitt swimming team's winning spree extends back to the midde of 1930
        when the Panthers downed Carnegie Tech, 39-23. The winning pace con        tinued throughout 1931, when the Pitt swimmers won over Wooster, Case, and
        Carnegie Tech.
            This year, the schedule arranged was an exceptionally hard one, and great
        credit is due Corr and the swimmers for their victories over Wooster, Delaware,
        New York University, Rider College, Carnegie Tech, Franklin and Marshall,
        and Case. All these schools have reputations for turning out consistently strong
        teams but were unable to match the skill and speed of the Pitt splashers.
            After beating Carnegie Tech decisively, the Panthers had a clear claim to
        the Eastern Intercollegiate Swimming Association title. The Pitt swimmers
        were not so fortunate in the individual championship meet but managed to finish
        in third place.
            Although the squad was evenly balanced, Hanna stood out in practically
        all the meets. Swimming on the relay team and in the 100 and 440, Hanna
        proved a consistent point winner. With still another year ahead of him, he
        should continue his great pace.
            Carik, undefeated throughout the season, proved his right to be called
        Pitt's best diver. Receiving close competition in only one meet, Carik swept
        through with ease.
            The Schmieler boys, Joe and George, lived up to pre-season predictions
        by splashing through with victories time and again.
            Herman Adlersberg, swimming his first year on the varsity squad, proved
        valuable enough to bear watching. Adlersberg swam free style, breast-stroke,
        and back-stroke, and spent part of his allotted time swimming on the relay
        team.
                                                                  Varsity Swimming

        F OR their first season in the big time, the Panther boxing team compiled a
             fairly good record. One of the hardest schedules ever set before a col        legiate boxing outfit was placed before Joe Orsini and his mittmen.
            West Virginia was met twice, and Carnegie Tech, Temple, Army, Syracuse,
        and Penn State rounded out a full schedule. The schedule was made doubly
        hard by the mittmen having to meet Army, West Virginia, and Carnegie Tech
        within a period of 7 days.
            The final results of the season leave something to be desired but also hold
        great promise for the future. This season the boxers defeated West Virginia
        and Carnegie Tech, tied Army, and lost to Syracuse, Penn State, Temple, and
        West Virginia. Most of the losses were by small margins, the Temple match be
        ing lost by the forfeiture in the 175 pound class.
            Throughout the season, Pitt fought without the services of a 175 pounder
        and was also without the services of a 115 pounder in the first two matches of
        the year. This handicap usually sent the Panthers into a match with one or two
        defeats chalked up against it before the fighting had actually started.
            Several finds of real value were unearthed by Coach Orsini with Siegel,
        Rubbo, and Namlik heading the list. As was expected, Jack Schricker, sopho        more middleweight sensation, turned in the best record, topping the season off
        by winning the 155 pound championship of the Eastern Conference. Neither
        Rubbo nor Namlik had any previous experience but both defeated some of the
        best collegians in the country.
            Francis Siegel, captain elect for 1933, was the most colorful fighter in this
        district. Fighting at 165 pounds without any previous experience, Siegel was
        never knocked off his feet and scored knockdowns in his two bouts with Meil
        and against Jamison and Olson.
            Left-overs from this year's squad will be Captain Siegel, Schricker, Mc       Carrell, Schimpf, Conti, and Santicola. Several good prospects are also expected
       from the freshman ranks.
Varsity Boxing

THE 1932 OWL
        A    LTHOlUGH held to two ties and defeated once during the past season,
              Skip Gougler's school for future Pitt varsity gridiron warriors graduated
        several men who are expected to play important roles in future Panther foot        ball conquests.
            Wyoming Seminary and Wash-Jeff freshmen were the Panther's victims in
        the first two games of the season. The Penn State frosh succumbed to the
        tune of 33-0 with Gougler's second and third string players playing the major
        portions of the game. Following that tilt, the Panthers and the Tartan plebes
        battled to a scoreless tie in a sea of mud.
            West Virginia freshmen, previously defeated by the Carnegie frosh, sur        prised the Pitt boys the week following the Tech battle and trounced them,
        12-0. The Panthers came back, however, and held Kiski, conquerors of the
        Tech plebes, to a 6-6 tie when Mike Nicksitch returned a kickoff 98 yards for
        a touchdown.
            The record was not one to which Pitt frosh teams are accustomed but the
        quality of the men on the team's roster will gladden the heart of Jock Suther        land when they report for fall training at Camp Windber.
            The outstanding linemen produced were Harvey Rooker, an end, and Ken
        Ormiston, a guard. Both boys came to camp last fall with brilliant records as
        backfield men, Rooker at Tarentum and Ornmiston at Westinghouse high in
        Pittsburgh. After a few early drills, however, the former was placed at end
        and the latter at guard; and from the forim which each displayed at his new
        post several holdovers on the varsity team will have a tough time holding their
        coveted positions.
            Kutz, another guard; Mike Nicksitch, a halfback, and Iz Weinstock, a full        back, are others who are expected to make varsity candidates next season sit
        up and take notice, Kutz is adapted to the Pitt style of guard play, and it would
        not be surprising to see him and Ormiston in the regular posts when the 1932
        season rolls around.
            Nicksitch and Weinstock will also make determined bids for regulars berths.
                                                                 Freshman Football

             Butler, Mgr., Caesar, Capt., Mazzie, Tapp, Thiele, Smoyer, Clise, Santicola, Shea, Coach
        A FTER an auspicious start against Allegheny in which meet the Panthers
           finished with a perfect victory score, coach Shea's cross-country team
       found the remaining teams on its schedule a little too strong and was forced to
       accept defeat in its five other duels.
            Syracuse and Penn State, perennial contenders for the intercollegiate
       championship, were Pitt's strongest opponents during the past season and won
       their meets with the Panthers by scores of 16 39 and 15-40, respectively.
       West Virginia and Army scored 17-38 victories over the Panthers, while Car       negie Tech copped the city championship duel, 20  35. The Panthers, how       ever, managed to win the A.M.A. team championship and the Pitt yearling
       team finished second in the same meet.
           The one redeeming feature of the season was the fine work of Johnny
       Clise, who will lead the harriers in 1932. It was his fine work which prevented
       the Panthers from losing all but the Allegheny meet by perfect scores. Clise
       has shown steady improvement since his freshman year and is counted upon to
       have the best season of his career this fall.
           Captain Glenn Thiele, Tony Mazzei, Johnny Smoyer, and Norman McCor       mick are the lone regulars who will be lost to coach Shea by graduation. In
       addition to captain Clise, he will have Jim Watkins and Marius Santicola from
       this year's team as holdovers.
           From the freshman team will come Charley Wagenhouser, Paul MacMurdo,
       Charley Kirkpatrick, and Al Bruenig. These boys inade a creditable showing
       in their duels with freshman teams, winning over Penn State and Carnegie
       Tech while dropping a close one to Syracuse. The Pitt frosh team was con
       sideled one of the best in the country.
           Wagenhouser who was elected honorary captain following the close of the
       season was not counted upon very heavily at the outset of the season, as he was
       unaccustomed to running any distance over a mile. He ran well in the two
       mile freshman jaunts and topped off a successful year by finishing up among
       the first three in the 61/2 mile A.M.A. championship grind.
Cross Country
331
THE 1932 OWL
        F OR the first time in many years, track prospects at Pitt are looking up.
            Captain Leonard Monheim, Mike Milligan, Woody Harris, Bill Keller,
       Johnny Luch, John Valenti, Marshall Lewis, Rob Roy, Johnny Clise, John
       Smoyer, Bill Lawrence, Jim MacMurdo, and Jim Watkins are the main reasons
       for the present outlook.
           The schedule arranged for the Panthers, however, is by no means an easy
       one. Ohio State, boasting of one of the strongest teams in the Big Ten, is the
       first opponent on the card. Jack Keller, dean of American collegiate and
       amateur hurdlers, is the mainstay of the Buckeye team. The Penn Relays at
       Philadelphia on May 7 are next on the schedule, and following that duel, the
       Panthers hook up with Notre Dame for the first time on the cinder path. The
       Irish are as strong in track and field sports as they are in football, and their
       appearance here is the high spot of the season. The Panther-Irish duel is
       scheduled for May 14.
            Following that duel, the Panthers meet two district opponents in Carnegie
       Tech and West Virginia to close the inter-school season. The I.C.A.A.A.A.
       meet at Harvard stadium will close inter-collegiate competition for the Pan       thers on May 28.
           Bill Keller, star quarter and half miler, and John Valenti, weightman ex       traordinary, are two possibilities for Uncle Sam's Olympic team. Both boys
       are sophomores.
           The freshman team will provide some material for coach Shea's varsity
       next year with Menaker, a sprinter; Smith, a discus thrower, and Gongloff, a
       javelin thrower, being the outstanding in the array. Captain Monheim, Harris,
       Lewis, Roy, Smoyer, and MacMurdo will be lost to the team through gradua       tion but the Pitt coach is counting upon the frosh material to more than make
       up for their departure.
                                                                                  Track

Looking Up...
                          Looking Ahead
Steadily expanding, even in the
face of the most world-wide economic stagnation in history, the
Aviation Industry today offers opportunities for a successful career
unequalled since the early days of
railroad development. Within another decade Aviation may be as established and as stereotyped as any
other great industry, but meantime, it offers problems to solve,
difficulties to overcome, success
and fortune ripe for the making.
  What are your ambitions? Will
you choose an established business, with its settled routine? Or
will you help to blaze the trail in
a new and fast-growing industry
             as did the railroad
             builders and indus             trial pioneers of yes             terday?
               Penn    School,
             through its close as             sociation with every
             department of Avi             ation, can give you
             specialized training
and a real start in this new industry. It has already done so for many
others. Penn School is a highly
specialized organization that can
make you a specialist in your chosen department of Aviation.
  Penn School is operated by Pittsburgh Aviation Industries Corporation, a company actively engaged

WHEN YOU STEP OUT
     INTO INDUSTRYYou may be headed for a steel plant-a great foundry  a
machine tool organization-a textile or an automobile plant.
You may be slated for electrical, chemical, metallurgical or
aeronautical engineering-but it doesn't matter what may
be the nature of your industrial activities you will find the
products of The Carborundum Company-grinding wheels
-abrasive grains-coated abrasives-refractories-among
your most necessary and valuable aids.
   The uses for the abrasive and refractory products of
The Carborundum Company are as wide and varied as
Industry itself.
   And might we suggest that you regard this as an invitation to visit the great plant of The Carborundum Company
at Niagara Falls, N. Y. Technically trained men are always
at your service to explain the interesting processes involved
in the making of the two remarkable manufactured abrasives "Carborundum" and "Aloxite" and the various
abrasive products.

      One Hundred Years of Friendship
           The University of Pittsburgh had its origin
           in the Pittsburgh Academy, chartered in
           1787. Forty-five years later in 1832, the
           Farmers Deposit National Bank was estab           lished. During these eventful one hundred
           years, both institutions have progressed with
           Pittsburgh, friends, and workers in their re           spective fields.

Worth the Difference
      To you, young man, about to start your professional career, the
      choice of dental equipment is a matter to be carefully considered.
      You will want equipment that is modern in design, utility and
      construction; equipment that will save you many tiring steps and
      needless effort; equipment that will convince your patients that
      you are capable and progressive.
      Don't handicap yourself at the start with poor equipment. Take
                                 advantage of Ritter's forty-two years of
                                 experience.... compare the values
                                 and you will see why Ritter is Worth

EQUIPMENT
       SPEAKS
What will you make
   it say about you?
Albeit fine Feathers do not necessarily make fine birds, or clothes
the man, an impressive showing is a valuable asset. The environment into which you invite your patients, subtly tells whether or
not you are progressive and successful.
There are three factors of prime importance in the success of a
dental practice. The first can be considered as knowledge, skill,
and experience; the second as personality; the third, environment.
Knowledge and training should of course be the deciding Factors
in judging a dentist's ability.
Unfortunately these are too often judged last by patients. They
estimate a man's ability first by his surroundings, then by his
personality, his skill and training last. Fair or unfair, this method
of mass approval is nevertheless a fact.
S. S. White Equipment will make your office a modern operating
room. It is graceful, dignified, will impart the proper atmosphere,
and give a uniformly dependable service. The Unit brings the
automatically warmed sprays, the mouth and antrum lamps, cauteries, warm air syringe and cut-off with graduated air pressures, and
thermal instruments, close to the field of operation for comfortable
and efficient operating.
It will extend the limits of your services and certainly make your
time mean more dollars for the hour.

T 79066
WESTINGHOUSE ELECTRIC
&amp; MANUFACTURING COMPANY
       EAST PITTSBURGH, PA.
   EQUIPPED
The city which has supplied steel to
change the pattern of a hundred skylines
recently pushed its own silhouette a step
higher. Pittsburgh's new Gulf Building,
home of the Gulf Refining Company,
towers 41 stories above the street, topping all neighboring structures by an
impressive margin.
In other ways, too, the Gulf Building
goes a step beyond most of its neighbors.
Lighting, for instance. Where the average office building of today skimps along
with four or five foot-candles, the offices
of this new building will have as much
as 14 or 15 foot-candles at their disposal,
if desired. This illumination is provided
by means of Westinghouse Lunaire semidirect lighting units, installed with the
co-operation of Westinghouse lighting
engineers.
No frantic searches for electric fuses will
ever be staged in this building. No pennies nor hairpins, inserted where fuses
should be, will menace the safety of wiring. Panelboards are equipped with the
new  Westinghouse "De-ion" circuitbreakers which snap "off" in case of
short circuit or overload-and are then
flipped on as easily as you throw a wall
switch.
With Westinghouse lighting, Westinghouse elevators, and Westinghouse motors for pumping and ventilation, each
floor of the Gulf Building carries evidence of the part Westinghouse plays in
making a modern skyscraper possible
... and evidence, too, of the complete
range of equipment which Westinghouse offers in the hundred million
dollar market which is the electrical side
of the four-and-a-half billion dollar
building industry.

Engineering reports based on sound business judgment, and accurate
appraisals are assisting in the necessary business readjustments of today
just as they did during other unusual business periods. Since 1889 we
have been making reports and appraisals for widely different business
interests.
Bankers and banking houses are employing us in connection with the
origination of financing or as preliminary to making loans; investment
houses as a protection for their customers, and industrials and utilities
for the study of present situations leading to the formation of future
programs. In addition, reorganization committees find our work helpful
in many problems.

for the Sunny Days
Let's be different.
Why not provide for the pleasant, as well as the
   rainy days.
                     When you are 65 and "worked out",
                        the geniality of the sun's smile
                        will be as warm as it was in your
                        youth.
                     It will beckon you to play-to golf,
                        travel, fishing, to many pleasant
                        hobbies. If you are Independent
                        you can respond to the urge and
                        leave dull care behind.
         A Prudential Endowment at Age 65
         will assure that Independence and
         PROTECT your DEPENDENTS
                     meantime.
 This Policy has many interesting features and benefits which I will
            be very glad, upon request, to explain.

",,He Can Who Thinks He Can"
   Millions of people in this world do not own $1000
because they think they cannot.
   Millions more who passed the thousand dollar
mark long ago once thought it impossible to collect
half that sum in a bank account.
   "He can who thinks he can" is a maxim which
has stirred many to a decision to make a difficult goal.
Say to yourself now, "I can do it." Then do it.
   Many thousands in nickels, dimes and quarters lie
around now, waiting for purposeful people to pick
them up and store them for future use. People are
picking them up and letting them slip through their
fingers every day. The people who manage to keep
some lift themselves into the $1000 class.
   If you start from nothing-or in debt and worse
than nothing-and by sheer determination get $1000
in bank, or safely invested, you are well on the road
to fortune.
   The lessons you learn, the habits you form in
getting that first $1000 will make many more for you
if you will give yourself a fair chance.

     SAVE IN A
PRACTICAL WAY
    HRIFT really means saving by
    foregoing needless expenses.
    You can go to extremes in
saving as in anything else, and
when you do you defeat the real
purpose of thrift, which is peace of
mind and greater enjoyment of life.
Save in a thoughtful, practical way
and it will not seem like self-denial,
but more like self-expression.

To the Seniors of the School of Business Administration:
A    LMOST three years of subnormal business condi      tions have elapsed. This should not mean discouragement to those of you who are about to be graduated from the School of Business Administration. Instead
it is a challenge which you should and must accept
eagerly. Clear thinking predicated upon sound concepts
and continued study, a recognition of your social, political and civic responsibilities-these and others are your
required tasks if you are to carry on as we have attempted
to direct you in your course of studies with us.

A CDX Dental X-Ray
Unit you will need one in
your new office
LEADERs in the dental pro   fession  have their own
x-ray units.  They find that
making their own radiographs
enables them to spend their time
more profitably and speeds their
work with greater efficiency and
accuracy. The fact that many of
these leaders have chosen the
CDX Dental X-Ray Unit evidences its
superiority.
  The CDX Dental X-Ray Unit hangs
suspended from the wall. It is 100%
electrically safe. You and your patient
can touch the CDX while in operation
without any danger of shock.
  And owning a CDX is not an expense. Our
liberal monthly payment plan will enable you to pay
each monthly installment from the revenues derived
and still have a profit. In starting out you cannot
afford to be without this important tool of your
profession. Write for full information.

C OMMENCEMENT;S not a reward for work
    well done but rather an opportunity
to meet the varied problems of life with a
better understanding. It is your right to
survey your chosen field and determine the
possibilities of success which it offers. If
the young men and women who have been
graduated before you are filling positions
which are attractive to you, follow them,
but if they have not yet fitted into the
scheme of life, it behooves you to specialize.
Voice training in all of its many phases
offers an excellent future to University
Graduates. The world has become speech
conscious. Defects in speech must be corrected, stammering, stuttering and all other
abnormal speech remedied. Byron King's
School of Oratory has specialized in speech
arts for more than fifty years and can aid
special teachers in obtaining school positions.

LEE PAUL SIEG
B.S., M.S., Ph.D.
To the College Seniors:
A BOUT thirty years ago I taught my first class in a
      university. I said to my students, and I believed
it, too, "Education is the only hope for a better citizenship." Today these former students are men and women
over forty-five, and some of them, at least, are probably
among those responsible for the general failure in this
country. What is wrong with us? Isn't education any
good? I still believe that education is necessary, but I
am convinced that it isn't sufficient. Education must go
with wisdom   and wisdom  must go with greatness of
spirit, or soul. Are you going to share, thirty years
from now, responsibility for failure, or are you going to
be among those who will keep our heads up"? Your education is sound. Hlave you attained wisdom and soul?
That is the real question.
                                     L. P. SIEG,
                                     Dean of College

LEE PAUL SIEG
B.S., M.S., Ph.D.
To the Seniors in the School of Education:
TN two respects vou are now about ready to teach. You
   know enough, at least for the present, about the subjects which you are hoping to teach; you know something at least, of how to go about your job of teaching.
But there is one more qualification, much more important than are these other two, which, in my opinion, you
must have or gain if you are to be really good teachers.
You must have a spiritual insight, a certain human
quality-call it what you will. This quality includes a
real liking for teaching, an interesting personality, a
high character, and a fitting combination of pride and
humility. You must have this last quality-you may be
naturally endowed with it, or you can strive to gain itif you are to be worthy of your high calling.
                                     L. P. SIEG,
                                       Acting Dean

ELMER A. HOLBROOK
      E.M.
7'o the Senior.s of the Schools of Engineering and Mines:
  N vour four years at Pitt we have tried to give you an
  academic background that would fit you to enter and
to go forward in our complex industrial civilization. You
are this year facing the fact that business and industry
is below normal, but gathering strength, I believe for new
and greater accomplishments. Please remember that
mental stagnation can do you more harm than can industrial depression. So continue busy with mastering more
of your profession; taste, if only through reading, some
of the fields of learning you have not taken here; keep
presentable and optimistic; then when the day comes to
go forward, you will be prepared even better than when
you left the University.
                                E. A. HOLBROOK,
                                               Dean

To the Pharmacy Seniors:
F OR a period of years we have been privileged to assist
    you in developing a certain ability to function in a
specific sphere. May I not express the hope, however,
that, in addition to this, you may have caught the thought
that the educative process is a progressive one, in consequence of which, you may be influenced to advance yourselves in knowledge and service in the years to come.
May you have all the success you merit.

To the Seniors:
IN a sense I suppose this is a posthumous statement as
   I shall have left the campus before the Owl appears.
The Staff has given me the opportunity however of
saying good luck to the members of your class as you
too go out into the world. Many of you I've known well
and cordially. I shall think back to our association here
with a sense of great satisfaction.
    Keep one thing in mind: the alumnus of a great
university has a debt of devotion and loyalty to the institution which gave him    so much during his undergraduate years. If a university is great, it is great in
part through the interest of its alumni. Remember your
debt to the University of Pittsburgh. Don't let the pressure of business or professional life make you indifferent to the ties of loyalty. The alumnus of a university
who lets his sense of loyalty grow cold deprives himself
of some of the greatest satisfactions a man can have.
    In whatever field you enter, opportunities lie ahead.
Make the most of them. The good wishes of all your
old friends will go with you.
                            ROBERT C. CLOTHIER,
                                      Dean of Men
