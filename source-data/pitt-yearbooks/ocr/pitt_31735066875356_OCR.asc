ATHLETES

There are many more athletes on the
University of Pittsburgh’s campus than it
would first appear, and that is due in part to
the existence of club and intramural sports.
Thanks to Pitt’s club sports teams and
intramural programs, anyone interested in
athletics has the opportunity to participate.
Pitt has a variety of club and intramural teams,
including ultimate Frisbee, volleyball, soccer,
and tennis. These athletes practice, travel, and
compete against other club and intramural
squads, just like their varsity counterparts.

While arguably less competitive than Division I
athletics, club teams offer an agreeable
atmosphere that allows students to continue

Intramural and club sports
like vo//eyba//, Frisbee, and
lacrosse give students a
chance to continue competing
in the sport they enjoy.

playing the sports they love. Intramural sports
also let students socialize and make friends
with similar interests.

With numerous athletic options available to
them, Pitt students find it easy to stay active
and participate in sports.

Home SWEET HOME

Each fall, University of Pittsburgh students
and alumni gather to celebrate homecoming
weekend and enjoy themselves with events
all over campus. Homecoming 2006 was
no exception.

On Friday, students decorated the panther
statue in front of the William Pitt Union and
attended the pep rally for the game. That night,
the Pitt Program Council's fireworks and laser
show amazed everyone gathered on Bigelow
Boulevard, which was closed for the event.
Festivities continued in the Union with Casino
Night, music, and refreshments.

against Rutgers University’s Scarlet Knights.
At halftime, Michael Long and Kristyn Stewart
were crowned homecoming king and queen,
ending weeks of campaigning.

While the Panthers could not pull off a victory
against Rutgers, students and alumni alike
enjoyed networking opportunities, theater
performances, Pitt football, and everything else
homecoming weekend had to offer.

Pitt NOW AND THEN

,The backbone of Oakland and, according

to the 2006 rankings released by US News

& World Report, the 19th best public university
in the nation, the University of Pittsburgh has
come a long way since its founding in 1787.

Throughout its 220—year history, Pitt has

made many medical and scientific break-
throughs. In the early 1950s, Jonas Salk and
his team developed the polio vaccine, which
saved countless lives. In 1984, two Pitt
surgeons performed the world's first heart/liver
transplant surgery.

Pitt also contributes to other fields of science.
In 1991, astronomer David Turnshek identified
the world’s most distant galaxy then known.
This past year, Small Times magazine ranked
Pitt second in the nation for micro— and

nanoscale research. Between 1995 and 2002,
funding from the National Institutes of Health
increased by 82 percent, placing Pitt among
the top 10 funded research universities in

the nation.

Pitt athletes also find national and international
success. John Woodruff won the 800—meter run
at the 1936 Berlin Olympics. Pitt's renowned
football team has 15 national championships to
its name, with past stars including Mike Ditka,
Dan Marino, and Tony Dorsett.

Thanks to its impressive list of achievements,
the Pitt family will continue to make its mark
on the world.

JAZZ

Each year, the University of Pittsburgh hosts
the four—day Jazz Seminar and Concert to
celebrate the original American musical art
form. The annual seminar brings some of the
world's biggest names in jazz to campus.

In its 36th year in 2006, the seminar is the
longest—running event of its kind and attracts
fans wishing to learn directly from top jazz
performers, educators, and historians.

Nathan Davis, head of Pitt’s jazz program,

and renowned guests give on—campus lectures,
clinics for students, and free demonstrations
throughout the week.

The seminar culminates with a concert in
Carnegie Music Hall. The 2006 concert
brought back some favorites, such as bassist
Abraham Laboriel, whose unique jazz fusion
style kept audience members laughing and
cheering. Pittsburgh's own Ron Affif pleased

Oakland—a hot spot for restaurants with
great food and distinctive atmospheres-
can accommodate practically every mood
and taste.

”The O,” as the Original Hot Dog Shop is
known, is a University of Pittsburgh landmark
famous for its heaping servings of cheese
fries. Home of the ”almost famous” sandwich,
Primanti Brothers presents their sandwiches
topped with french fries and coleslaw. Other
campus favorites include Joe Mama’s Italian
Deluxe, Five Guys Famous Burgers and

Fries, and Pamela's.

Many University of Pittsburgh students dread
the infamous Pittsburgh winter with its gusty
winds, chilling temperatures, and snowstorms
measured in feet. To stay warm and dry,
students bundle up in hats, jackets, gloves, and
boots and often resort to just staying inside.

But for those who do not catch the winter

The END

For most undergraduates, the end of the spring
semester means freedom from classes and
homework and the beginning of the carefree
summer months. However, the end of the
school year also means packing up your things,
selling back your books, and moving yet again.

Upperclassmen will remember all too well

the overfilled trash cans, elevator jams, and
traffic that accompany the moving—out process.
Students must also make sure that they have
returned all their library materials and handed
over their dorm room keys. Students selling
back $150 textbooks for $10 might discover
additional reasons for anxiety.

Of course, for graduating seniors, the end of
the year holds a deeper significance—the

worrying about selling back books or packing
up possessions, seniors focus on graduation
activities, seeing as many friends as possible,
and saying their good—byes.

Although April comes with a long to—do list,
undergraduates look forward to their summer-
time freedom while soon—to-be graduates
eagerly anticipate entering the ”real” world.

Alma Mater, wise and glorious,
gchiljd of Light and Bridergf Truth,
Over fate and foe victorious,
Dower’d with eternal youth.
Crowned with love of son and daughter,
Thou shalt conquer as of yore.
Dear Old Pittsburgh, Alma Mater,
God preserve Thee ever more.

First beyond the mountains founded,
Where the West road opens free,
Where twin rivers, forest bounded

Merge and journey t’ward the sea,
In the dawning of the nation
Eregthe clouds of strife had cleared,
{Rose thy rough-hewn habitation,

By our prophet fathers reared.

Close thy mother love embraces
All who gather at thy knee,
Castes and classes, creeds and races,
Mother, are as one to Thee;
Thou who unto knowledge bore us,
In the good old days long gone,
Raise thy Gold and Blue high o’er us,
Lead and we will follow on.

Dear Old Pittsburgh, Alma Mater,

Congratulations, Class of 2007!

This has been a year of successful campaigns
at the University of Pittsburgh. The capital
campaign hit the $1 billion mark this year,

our campus got a new look during the Paint
the Town Blue and Gold school spirit campaign,
and our Get Out the Vote campaign drastically
increased student voter turnout for the midterm
elections—from just 2 percent in 2002 to more
than 25 percent this year.

The Student Government Board (SGB) made
strides in enriching student life with Light Up
Night; town hall meetings; and our new student
handbook, The Pitt Compass. SGB’s main goal,
however, has been to promote the interests,
needs, and welfare of undergraduate students.
I am proud to announce that this has been
achieved, as displayed throughout the pages
of this book.

SGB
President's Letter

I would like to thank you for the opportunity

to serve as SGB president. Our accomplishments
could not have been achieved alone. I would
also like to thank our advisor, Joyce Giangarlo;
our office manager, Donna Mihalik; Dean

of Students Kathy Humphrey; and all eight

SGB members.

It is amazing to look back on our time at Pitt
and realize how much we have grown. I hope
your years as an undergraduate have left you
with great memories, and I hope that the years
to come provide many more.

Hail to Pitt!

The Cathedral of Learning
complements its surroundings
in every season.

lPitt’s Lasting LANDMARK

The Cathedral of Learning—with its towering
stone walls, countless glass windows, and
cavernous Commons Room—is a central
fixture of the University of Pittsburgh's
Oakland campus. Alumni will fondly recall
studying while surrounded by its Gothic
architecture, attending class in its Nationality

Rooms, or just relaxing on its expansive lawn.

This magnificent building epitomizes the
Pitt experience.

Conceived by then Chancellor John Bowman
in 1926, the construction of the Cathedral
survived the Great Depression and many
other obstacles. Thanks to contributions from
the community and around the world,
the project persevered, and the Cathedral

A student catches a quick
nap between classes.

Far right: On warmer days,
many professors take
their classes outside.

was finally dedicated in 1937. Bowman
boldly envisioned a vibrant future for Pitt
and felt that the Cathedral should serve
as a visible symbol of the University.

At 42 stories and 535 feet tall, the Cathedral
stands as the second tallest educational
building in the world and, perhaps more
importantly, the heart of Pitt's campus.

On the cornerstone of the Cathedral

of Learning is a small copper engraving that
pays tribute to all the people and cultures
that have helped shape the University

of Pittsburgh: ”Like the Magi of ancestral
traditions  they offer their gifts of what is
precious, genuine and their own, to truth that
shines forever and enlightens all people.”

The Nationality Rooms, numbering 26 in
total, are a medium for cultural exchange.
Crafted out of different materials, each room
is adorned with artifacts from the culture or
country it represents. The rooms emulate
historical settings, such as a scene in Athens,

an ancient Indian university, an Asante temple,

and London's House of Commons.

The Indian Room’s design
mimics the golden age of
Indian architecture.

Far right: Shelley Hawk,
Austin Deaver, and Beth
Vrbanic wait for class

to begin in the ornate/y
decorated Austrian Room.

The Israel Heritage Room
features elaborate tile mosaics.

lCu|tural CLASSROOMS

Despite their historical significance, the rooms
were designed as functioning classrooms.

With elements like stone chairs, tapestries, and
portraits, the rooms offer a welcome alternative
to the traditional classroom and provide a
unique learning experience that no Pitt graduate
is likely to forget.

Heinz Memorial Chape/’s striking architecture
makes it a ﬁxture on Pitt’5 campus.

H The ornate woodwork of Heinz
I _ Chape/’s doorways is one of the
many reasons the chapel is an
historic landmark.

 

l

S Heinz Memorial Chapel is a preeminent
Pittsburgh building. Ground was broken for
the neo—Gothic chapel in 1933, and the
structure was completed five years later.

The chapel contains 23 stained glass windows,
including some of the tallest in the world.
Using 250,000 mosaic pieces of colored glass,
the windows illustrate nearly 400 famous men
and women from the fields of religion, history,
art, medicine, and science.

 

The interior architecture is also historically
significant. The stone vaults, arches, and high
ceilings are all typical of a form of American
architecture that dates from the early 1900s

more than 100,000 people in attendance.
Through its role in celebration, religion, and

Simply FOR STUDENTS

Formerly known as the Hotel Schenley,

the William Pitt Union is the center of student
life at the University of Pittsburgh. By visiting
its numerous offices and the main floor
information desk, students can learn about
many of the University’s opportunities.

In 1956, Pitt converted the former hotel-
now affectionately known simply as the
Union—into the headquarters for student
entertainment and activities on campus.
The Union houses Pitt's more than

300 student—run activities and organizations.

Students flock to the William Pitt Union, not
only because of its constant flurry of events,

but also because of the presence of the
convenient Schenley Café. Located on the
lower level of the Union, the cafe is a popular
on-campus eatery.

Whether they are looking for information,
food, or entertainment, students come to the
Union and immerse themselves in the unique
experience that is Pitt.

The William Pitt Union gives
students a chance to eat, work,
and play with its Schenley Café,
game room, and multitude of
student organization offices.

Though it sits in the shadow of the Cathedral of Learning,
the Union is the real heart of student life on campus.

For decades, ”the O” has satisfied Pitt students’ /ate-night
cravings with its great hot dogs and mounds of french fries.

 

With their Pitt /Ds, students
have full access to all of the
Carnegie libraries and museums.

A Student's PERSPECTIVE

If you were to ask anyone about Pitt’s landmarks,
you would likely hear about the William Pitt
Union and the Cathedral of Learning. If you
were to ask a Pitt student, however, you might
hear something a bit different. All it takes is one
week in Oakland for students to develop their
own favorite places.

Restaurants and coffee shops in Oakland,

for instance, have achieved their own landmark
status. Hemingway’s Cafe offers reduced after-
hours food prices. The Original Hot Dog Shop,
affectionately nicknamed ”the O,” is famous

for its fries. Fuel & Fuddle offers half—off
specials after midnight that attract the late—night
student crowd.

Oak/and offers something
for all students, from a
favorite student hangout
like Hemingway’s to the
educational Carnegie
Museum of Art.

Local coffeehouses—such as Starbucks,

Kiva Han, and Caribou Coffee—make great
places for studying, holding meetings, or just
hanging out. The David Lawrence Hall and
Hillman Library computer labs, with their
endless lines of students waiting for printouts,
have also become staples in the Pitt community;
Without a doubt, these landmarks, too,

are part of the essence of Pitt.

A Supportive START

Arrival Survival is the beginning of every
student’s experience at the University

of Pittsburgh. The University designed this
multistep process to make the transition to
college life as seamless as possible. To make
this happen, streets throughout campus are
blocked off at the end of August, dorm room
keys are distributed, and carloads of belongings
are unloaded.

The trained volunteers who constitute the
Arrival Survival team help new students and
their parents by answering questions, giving
directions, and unpacking carts. Once the
students are settled in, the University
sponsors many free activities for incoming
students. These events include Freshman

Convocation, the Meet and Greet Ice Cream
Social, and the Orientation Aloha Luau.
Arrival Survival is complemented by PittStart,
a two—day orientation that welcomes students
and helps them register for classes and take
placement exams.

In an unfamiliar environment, the steps of
Arrival Survival, along with the volunteers’
help, make students’ transition to their first
days at Pitt as smooth as possible.

Amanda Fierro

   

Students have lots to do at the beginning
of each school year, from moving in and
unloading to purchasing textbooks at the

University of Pittsburgh Book Center.

Panther GREEKS

At the University of Pittsburgh, those involved
in Greek organizations are driven by academics
and community service, and they embrace
every aspect of college life.

Three governing bodies preside over Greek
organizations at the University: the lnterfrater—
nity Council, the National Pan—Hellenic Council
(NPHC), and the Panhellenic Council. These
councils represent 16 fraternities, 11 sororities,
eight historically African American fraternities
and sororities, and one multicultural sorority.

Fraternity and sorority members balance fun
with honoring their commitments to their
classes, the student body, and the outside
community. Each year, Greeks pick a charity
and fundraise for that cause. In 2005-06,

of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute enabled the
funding of the Fraternity and Sorority Life
Office Laboratory.

Whether testing out their vocals at Greek Sing,
performing traditional steps at the NPHC Step
Show, or fundraising for fights against lung
cancer and pediatric AIDS, fraternity and
sorority members see Greek life as a way to
make their mark on Pitt’s campus.

For the STUDENTS

The University of Pittsburgh Student Govern-
ment Board (SGB) is a small body of eight
elected board members and an elected
president who control a multimillion dollar
budget each year. The organization also has
10 student committees that deal with issues
like diversity, Pitt's environmental impact, and
freshman involvement.

In 2005, SGB President Brian Kelly ended his
second consecutive term, handing over leader-
ship to Joe Pasqualichio, who also served two
terms. Both former presidents and their boards
implemented new activities and projects, such
as Pitt’s first Light Up Night, a celebration held
by student organizations close to the winter
break. Other notable events include Panther
Pride Campus Wide, an event that encourages
student participation in homecoming activities,
and a 2005 benefit concert for Hurricane

Katrina victims. Additionally, SGB facilitates
positive student experiences through budget
allocations, campus activities, and internal
changes, like moving elections from polling

online ballots.

Consistently striving for improvement, SGB
makes the student body their top priority.

The Pitt African Music and Dance Ensemble
(PAMDE) is a group of musicians committed to
studying and performing a nontraditional genre
of music on and around Pitt's campus.

Founded in 1983 by Willie Anku, PAMDE
consists of students taking a class for credit
and those participating in a club. Both sets
of students see PAMDE as an opportunity
to learn about traditional African music and
dance. After much studying and many
rehearsals, students are required to perform
for the campus at the end of each semester.

Under the current leadership ofJ.S. Kofi
Gbolonyo, PAMDE recently performed off
campus for the first time and was able to
charge admission, which became funding
for the group.

Students get a chance to 
perform for audiences both I

on and off Campus after taking
a course offered through the V j
music department.

 RHYTHMS

The group can also be found performing for
local elementary and middle schools, teaching
them not only about African music but also
about the culture. Through interpretive dance
performed to the music, younger children

gain a more realistic picture of African arts.
The members of the group particularly

enjoy these performances because they spread
knowledge of and appreciation for the rich
culture of Africa.

CHANCELLOR

,

i Congratulations on your graduation from the
University of Pittsburgh! This collection of essays
and photos by your fellow students will keep
memories of your Pitt experiences alive for years
to come. Your Student Government Board and
the Office of the Chancellor have partnered

to produce this keepsake of impressions for the
Class of 2007.

As you look to the future, remember you are
entering a world that needs the knowledge, talents,
and skills you developed at the University

of Pittsburgh. Your formal credentials will reveal
some of your achievements. But many of the truly
significant talents you nurtured here will not be
apparent from your transcript: the ability to
analyze problems and think critically, to gather
and synthesize information using an array of tools,
to work in teams, to ”walk in another’s shoes,”
and to continue to learn and to grow—-every day
in every way. These lasting benefits of your Pitt
education will remain with you throughout

your life and will pay lasting dividends, both to
you and to society.

As you meet new challenges and pursue new
opportunities, please remember that you always
will be a part of the University of Pittsburgh.

Our extended family of former students—Pitt
alumni—can be found throughout the United
States and in most nations across the globe.

We invite you to stay connected and continue

to be involved in your University by participating
in Pitt alumni programs and events. |t’s rewarding,
it’s fun, and it is one of the best ways to continue
building the talents and skills that are the product
of your Pitt education.

Your alma mater forever will be a part of your
life, and we hope you will join us as we build
further on the proud legacy that belongs to the
University of Pittsburgh——and to you. Best of luck
in everything that you do, and hail to Pitt!

For those entering Pitt for the first time, these
new experiences often take place in the Amanda Fierro

located at the center of campus. Numerous
Pitt students have lived in one of the Towers

make college living simple, and living there has
definite benefits. From the cafeterias located
below to the laundry rooms in the lobby,
the Towers can be ideal for freshmen.

But living off campus has its benefits, too. Erin Stimer

Whether students choose North, South, or
Central Oakland, there is a certain freedom in
knowing that roommates now come in single
digits rather than in the hundreds. Other perks
include having a real kitchen that does not limit
menu choices to ramen noodles or microwave
mac and cheese and, of course, freedom from the
supervision of RAs. Having guests over does not
require Pitt IDs and sign—in sheets, and there are
no limitations on just how many people can visit.

Bikes, cars, and public
transportation are all ways that
Pitt commuters get to campus.

lA Road LESS TRAVELED

lThe University of Pittsburgh attracts its more
than 17,000 undergraduate students from all

over the world. A little more than 1 percent

of those students commute to campus.

For students living on campus, commuting may
seem like a hassle. Why wake up two hours
before class just to get to campus? And, more
importantly, where do these people catch their
midday naps?

Yet somehow commuters have mastered the
process. With countless buses running through
Oakland, commuting is as easy as hopping

on the 10A shuttle. Parking meters may irritate
those who drive to campus, but seasoned

commuters soon note the locations of broken
meters. Commuters can also enjoy the benefits
of their homes, such as prepared meals, single
rooms, and free laundry.

Despite some annoyances, commuting can be
fairly easy with the proper planning, and it has
become a way of life for some Pitt students.

The Working WORLD

Nobody ever said that college would be easy.
For many students, though, the stresses of
college extend beyond homework, courses,
and exams.

College tuition and other expenses are often

a burden to students. Loan payments, rent
money, groceries, car insurance, and the like
are on the minds of many, and dividing time
among a job (or jobs), classes, homework, and
extracurricular activities is not an easy task.

Luckily, many local employers understand the
needs of students and cooperate in arranging
student—friendly schedules. The University's
student employees are particularly lucky,

in that they need not work on weekends,

holidays, or late at night. But that doesn’t mean
employers expect any less from students. As with
all student workers, University employees must
learn to balance the pressures of school, friends,
work, and more.

Holding down a job while shouldering a full
class load may be difficult, but some Pitt
students have been able to use the experience
to learn to manage their time effectively and
prepare for the ”real world.”

 Ca47ro==f<Alor=£ioM5,

 Class of 2007! It’s finally time to graduate

and to leave the University of Pittsburgh.
Yet while your undergraduate years are
over, your Pitt education will help you
with whatever lies ahead.

With a campus as large as Oakland,

Pitt has meant something different to each
student. Graduates can walk away with
lasting friendships, distinguished mentors,
outstanding athletic achievements, and

a great college education. Whatever path
you have pursued over the past four years,
you can venture into the world with an
overwhelming sense of pride in your
accomplishments—as well as in Pitt.

Whether you plan on furthering your
education, accepting a full—time job,

or traveling, you will take a small part of
Pitt with you. This book will help to
remind you of your time in Pittsburgh.

Its photographs and narratives are meant
to preserve your memories so that even if
your career, family, or additional schooling
takes you away, the pride of Pitt will remain
with you always.

Some Added ENTERTAINMENT

The Pitt Program Council (PPC) is a student
organization dedicated to improving the
quality of undergraduates’ lives outside

the classroom. With eight committees devoted
to different areas of student life, wide—ranging
activities are offered year—round.

PPC coordinates bonfires and pep rallies and
hosts events like Fall Fest, Winter Wonderland,
and Bigelow Bash. In fall 2006, PPC brought
the Nintendo Fusion Tour to campus, featuring
acts such as Hawthorne Heights and Relient K.
They also arrange trips to Cedar Point and
Kennywood throughout the school year to give
students the opportunity to spend some time
away from campus.

Ben Folds was the
highlight of PPC’s
2006 Bige/ow Bash.

Far right: PPC often
offers seasonal
activities, like pumpkin
decorating outside

the William Pitt Union.

56

During finals week, students know that they
can turn to PPC for a break from studying.
Massages, movies, and free food give students
a chance to escape finals—related anxiety and
relax in a stress—free environment.

PPC hosts countless events aimed at enriching
students’ lives and getting them up, on their

feet, and having fun.

efforts, more than 100 free programs are
available every year to undergraduate students.

With their Pitt IDs, students receive free
admission to the Carnegie Museums of Art
and Natural History, Phipps Conservatory
and Botanical Gardens, Andy Warhol
Museum, and Mattress Factory. More than
13,000 Pitt students take advantage of this
opportunity every year.

Discounted tickets are also available to students,

such as the Pittsburgh Ballet Theatre, Pittsburgh

A Spring BREAKAWAY

The cliché that is college spring break will
not soon be forgotten or lived down, but at
the University of Pittsburgh, some students
experience more.

In lieu of the beach, some students travel
throughout the United States on the Student
Volunteer Outreach’s Alternative Break trips.
These weeklong trips allow undergraduates to
volunteer their time in places like Gila National
Forest in New Mexico or the Cumberland Trail
in Tennessee. Some students donate their efforts
to underdeveloped nations by participating in
Habitat for Humanity |nternational’s home-
building events.

Some of the sports teams on campus spend
spring break training for their upcoming season.
The Pitt crew team, for example, endures the

Georgia heat to perfect their strokes and devote
themselves entirely to practice for a week.

Other students participate in the Pitt Program
Council (PPC)’s annual sponsored spring break
trips, like last year’s excursion to Panama City
Beach, Fla. PPC offers students a reasonably
priced chance to meet peers who might
otherwise remain strangers.

Whether they are volunteering with Habitat
for Humanity or just catching some sunshine
in Florida, Pitt students ensure that they get

a much—needed vacation from classes as well
as a break from the dreaded Pittsburgh winter.

Kenzie Swift

    

While some students choose P’ .
to spend their spring break on V W
the beach, others use the
time off to volunteer in areas
all across the country. '

Ellen Deutsch takes advantage of a Colorful
fall day by running in Schen/ey Park.

 

The newly constructed dining
kiosks in Schenley Plaza provide
patrons with quick and
reasonably priced lunch options.

An Outdoor ESCAPE

Spanning an impressive 456 acres, Schenley
Park is where Pittsburghers head to escape

the chaos of urban life. As one of the largest
public parks on the eastern seaboard, it con-
tains numerous recreational facilities, including
playgrounds, tennis courts, a golf course,

a swimming pool, a skating rink, a soccer field,
and several hiking trails.

Recently, Schenley Park expanded to include
its long—awaited grand entrance, Schenley
Plaza. This acre of lush greenery at the heart
of campus offers four small cafés—the Bagel
Factory, Dog House, Asia Tea House, and
Schenley Pizza Co.—as well as a carousel,
a large and cleverly designed seating area,

A stroll through
Schenley Park is
a great way to
escape the hectic
pace of Oakland.

and wireless Internet. It also brings the arts
outdoors by hosting many cultural and
musical performances.

Whether you're looking for a place to exercise

or simply an urban green space, Schenley Park ,

and Plaza offer something unique to everyone.

It's an HONOR

The University of Pittsburgh's University Honors
College (UHC) creates opportunities for highly
capable and motivated students by providing
intellectually challenging courses, supplemental
advising, and a carefully cultivated community.

Headquartered in the newly renovated 35th
and 36th floors of the Cathedral of Learning,
UHC commands a breathtaking view of campus
and city, a vista available to more than just an
elite group of students. Pitt’s Honors College is
distinctively inclusive in that it does not restrict
membership to its academic community.
Rather, any student who is academically driven
can enroll in an Honors College course with
departmental consent.

Steve Hein finds the reception
desk an informative resource
for Student Honors Activity
Council events, such as a
Gateway Clipper dance
attended by Andrew Abbott
and Ashley Lafata (near right).

Students relax and unwind
in the Honors College lounge
on the 35th floor of the

 v Cathedral of Learning.

UHC supports its own Bachelor of Philosophy
degree and ensures small class sizes for UHC
courses. The college also oversees the Student
Honors Activity Council, its main programming
body, whose sponsored activities include
Friday afternoon lectures, the Pizza and Prose
book club, and the distinguished Drue Heinz
Lecture Series.

While UHC clearly enriches the lives of Pitt
students, the college can also claim partial

responsibility for Pitt’s swiftly growing reputation.

Pitts’ ACADEMIC PROWESS

In our four years at the University of Pittsburgh,
Pitt students have had a remarkable record
when it comes to winning major scholarships,
fellowships, and grants.

Two years in a row, in 2004 and 2005, Pitt un-
dergraduates received all three of the renowned
congressional undergraduate scholarships:

the Barry M. Goldwater Scholarship, awarded
for science, mathematics, and engineering; the
Harry S. Truman Scholarship, for government
and public service; and the Morris K. Udall
Scholarship, for environmental policy. Pitt was
one of only three universities to earn all

three scholarships.

In 2006, Justin Chalker won a Rhodes Scholar-
ship—one of only three students to do so from
a public university—and Clayton Magill earned
a Churchill Scholarship in the University's first
year of competition.

Impressively, Pitt has also received a number
of other highly esteemed academic awards,
including Marshall Scholarships, Andrew W.
Mellon Foundation fellowships, and numerous
Fulbright Program grants. Pitt's own
Brackenridge Undergraduate Fellowship
program continues to foster young scholars
and encourage undergraduates to conduct
independent research projects.

The University's ready resources, accessible
faculty, and dynamic student body cultivate
a unique learning environment and make the
University of Pittsburgh a leader in education.

Center to watch the men’s basketball team
claim victories over rivals like the University
of Connecticut, Syracuse University, and the
University of Notre Dame. Under the leader-
ship of head coach and 2004 Big East Coach
of the Year Jamie Dixon, the Panthers have
produced quite a few notable players, includ-
ing Carl Krauser, Chris Taft, Chevon Troutman,
and Aaron Gray.

With such talented players and coaches, the
Panthers have found success. In March 2006,
the team entered the NCAA Tournament for
the Pitt—record—breaking fifth consecutive year.

Carl Krauser helped lead his
teammates and the Oakland Zoo
to the 2006 NCAA Tournament.

Cheering these players to victory is the
enthusiastic student section dubbed the Oakland
Zoo. The Zoo has a reputation for being one
of the most supportive student fan groups

in the country.

With fans wearing golden shirts bearing the
Zoo logo constantly jumping, chanting, and
cheering, it is no wonder that Pitt’s men’s team
continues to impress Pitt fans and basketball
enthusiasts alike.

l Under the guidance of Head Coach Chris
Beerman, women’s volleyball has surged
forward in the past five years, building and
maintaining a solid program.

The past three years were all winning seasons
for the Panthers. They had an outstanding

season in 2003 with an overall record of 26-6.

With the addition of key players like 2004 Big
East Rookie of the Year Diana Andreyko,

the next two seasons also proved successful,
with overall records of 21-11 in 2004 and
17-13 in 2005. In 2003, the team’s success
extended through the postseason as they
captured the Big East title.

Though the team has not returned to the finals
since 2003, other players have pushed the
squad in the right direction. 2006 graduate

NCAA Woman of the Year Award for her

Lengths BEYOND THE REST

Although the University of Pittsburgh’s
swimming and diving teams take up a
relatively small portion of the athletics
spotlight, that does not deter them from
excelling at what they do.

The last three seasons featured success

after success for Head Coach Chuck Knoles’
squads. In 2006, diver Jeremy Stultz made his
first appearance in the NCAA Swimming and
Diving Championships. He placed 30th in his
event and finished the season as the Big East
Diver of the Year. Diver Dennis Nemtsanov,
who graduated as one of Pitt’s top performers
of all time, also captured many Big East awards
and was given honorable mention on the
NCAA All—America team multiple times. Trees
Pool, the location for the team’s home meets,
displays the numerous banners from these

Big East Conference accomplishments.

Whether they are excelling in the
backstroke, butterfly, or diving,
Pitt’s swimming and diving teams

continue to be two of the most
successful Panther athletic squads.

On the women’s side, five participants
advanced beyond the Big East Championships
to the NCAAS, including Kristin Brown and
Stacie Safritt. In addition to their performance
in the pool, the College Swimming Coaches
Association of America named the Pitt
women's team a 2005 Academic All-American
team. The Panthers were one of five Big East
teams honored.

Whether his team is in or out of the pool, the
continued success of Knoles’ swimmers and

divers remains unmatched among Pitt athletes.

Leaps and BOUNDS

lThe University of Pittsburgh's gymnastics team
has enjoyed plenty of success in the past few
years. In the 2003-04 season, the team finally
beat Pennsylvania State University, their tough-
est rival, for the first time in 20 years. In 2004,
Alyse Zeffiro scored two perfect 10s on the
vault and floor—the first in Pitt history.

In the 2005-06 season, Andrea Arlotta led the
Panthers in nearly every event, while Robyn
Marszalek was named to the East Atlantic
Gymnastics League All-Academic team along
with eight other Panther gymnasts. Anya
Chayka competed her way to second team
all-conference on the balance beam, as did
Samantha DeBone on the uneven bars. The
team placed fifth overall for the season at the
NCAA Northeast Regional Championships.

While Pitt gymnasts
compete individually in
events, teamwork and
camaraderie are

essential to their sport.
/\/oncompeting athletes
are expected to watch and
support their teammates.

The future is looking bright for the Pitt
gymnastics program. With the addition of
Assistant Coach Mike Rowe in 2006 and the
experience of Head Coach Debbie Yohman,
the squad expects to make even more
progress in the years ahead.
