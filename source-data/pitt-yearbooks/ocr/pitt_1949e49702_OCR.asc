The School of
Engineering and Mines

With the post-war demand for technological educa-
tion still as strong as ever, the University’s School of En-
gineering and Mines took great steps this year in pro-
viding both adequate physical facilities and an increased
teaching staff. With a registration exceeded only
by the College, the School was faced with the problem of
meeting current needs while looking to the projected
Building Program to eventually drain off the overﬂow.

Under Dean Elmer A. Holbrook, the E & M School
has kept abreast of latest developments in science and
engineering with numerous additions to the faculty,
revamped courses and texts, and a general ‘change-as-
you-go’ improvement program in all ﬁelds of engineer-
ing and mining education. All this has been accomp-
lished with no lowering of standards or prestige, in
spite of the fact that the School each year places in its
courses the absolute maximum number of students pos-
sible.

The students themselves, although for the most
part separated from those attending classes on the
lower campus and at Ellsworth Center, round out their
busy scholastic life with numerous social functions
planned and operated through their ‘own governing
body, Engineering and Mines Cabinet.

Here is a story, told by the students of the University

. . a tale about the life of students at Pitt. Here is a

story, a photographic presentation of the two major

phases of college life. It brings you ﬁrst the impressive

formal side of student life and then the unceremonious

informal side, in symbolic photographs. Here is a

story, the essence of a year of student life at Pitt, as

nearly as it can be expressed in words and pictures.

Dr. William S. M(-Ellroy

The School of
Medicine

119

To prepare the student for a practice of medicine
proﬁtable both to himself as a doctor and society  a
whole—this has always been the aim of the School of
lVIedicine. The prospective practitioner is trained in
the techniques of the latest developments in the field,
learning the scientiﬁc principles underlying normal an(l
abnormal functioning. He is trained in the physics and
chemistry of human life, and the application of sound
scientiﬁc methods of treatment.

All this, however, is not taught at the expense of
the student’s losing his perspective in the practice of the
art of medicine. The d0ctor—to-be is taught the correct
physician-patient relationship, his responsibility to him-
self, to his patient. to his fellow practitioner. He is made
to realize his duty in the support of the highest standards
of the profession. He is trained to be completely worthy
of the high esteem with which his patients and neighbors
will look upon him.

The School of Medicine hopes to improve, through
an extensive building and expansion program, the stand-
ards of the medical curriculum which are already suffi-
ciently high to warrant the school’s being universally
acclaimed as one of the nation’s best. Under the ex-
panded eurriculum there will be greater facilities for
research in the medical sciences. The school will be able
to surpass even its present high standards of scholarship.

The School of
Nursing

More than any other undergraduate or graduate
school in the University, the School of Nursing can
claim that its students receive practical on-the-job
training as well as classroom studies. Whether they are
undergraduates putting in their three years of general
training at Magee Hall or Registered Nurses studying
for specialized degrees, Dean Ruth Perkins Kuehn’s
students never lose contact with the actual situations
for which their training will ﬁt them to handle.

Although one of the most recently founded of the
University schools, the School of Nursing ranks with
leading schools much older than its eleven years of
existence. Through high standards of scholarship,
ability, and character, the School each year graduates
some of the nation’s finest nurses.

Providing both a basic course in general nursing
essentials and a program of graduate courses in special-
ized fields, the School has established itself as a center
of nursing education soon to expand to even greater
limits along with its partner fields of medicine and
science.

The School of
Pharmacy

Perched on the bluff overlooking the lVIonongahela
River is the youngest member of the University of
l’ittsburgh’s academic family. Although it has operated
in conjunction with the University for many years, it
was only last year that the School of Pharmacy actually
became a part of the University.

Now full members of the student body the upper-
class pharmacists are still isolated in their red brick
building on the Boulevard of the Allies. It is here that
they Work, study, and experiment through their four-
year course. Every bit of equipment necessary is on
hand. even to a special library of four thousand volumes
to help the pharmacists cope with the problems con-
cerning their profession.

A further aid to Pharmacy students is the Ameri-
can Pharmaceutical Association. a professional organ-
ization which maintains a student branch at the school.
This local branch is entirely managed by students and
it not only helps them with their work but also arranges
social functions to relieve the burden of long class-
room and laboratory hours.

Directing all this activity is a well—trained profes-
sional staff headed by Dr. Edward C. Reif, dean of the
School of Pharmacy and a longtime member of its
faculty.

Granite corridors, trophies, memorials, are common tri-
butes to men and women who have won recognition. The
1949 Owl Hall of Fame, however, serves as an epithet of twenty
students who, outstanding in their four year college life for
character, honesty, leadership and work, have earned for tl1em—
selves a place in the Owl Hall of Fame. Among them are
scholars, athletes, journalists, social leaders, business men,
artists, and administrators, who, depriving themselves of
pleasures and good times, have devoted more than what was
demanded of them. Many were considered by a committee of
Juniors and faculty members before these twenty students
were ﬁnally selected. l\Iay this honor be a spur to added fame

and continued integrity.

Honorary Elementary Education Fraternity

Alpha Beta Gamma. the professional elementary edu-
cation fraternity, was founded in 1940 as a means of
communication of ideas between students and faculty
in the teaching ﬁeld. From its small beginning Alpha
Beta Gamma has gained a position of importance on
campus.

The organization has endeavored to promote fel-
lowship and a friendly co-operation among the students
and faculty of the department of elementary education,
and to stimulate and encourage interest in this ﬁeld.
A11 alumni committee was created this year so that the
graduates and undergraduates can keep in closer con-
tact with one-another and exchange ideas.

The organization has tried to develop socially as
well as professionally. In the early part of the school
year, Alpha Beta Gamma held a tea so that the old
and new members might become better acquainted. As
their social service project the girls packed Christmas
boxes for underprivileged children. The annual banquet
was held i11 April as an appropriate ending for the year.

The officers for the year were as follows: President:
l\Iarjorie Peterson: \'1ce—l’resident, l\Iar1e van Nerven;
Secretary, Ruth l\Ietz_2er: Treasurer, Marie l\repps.

Alpha Phi Omega, Pitt’s only service fraternity
has been serving the University faithfully since 1925.
Belonging to a family of 168 chapters, Pitt’s Beta
chapter was the second chapter formed.

Since its reactivation after a quiet war-time ex-
istence, the Beta chapter has been making up for lost
time by taking part in more activities than ever before.
These include the conducting of all student elections,
working under the direction of the Dean of Men in
Freshmen Week, ushering at commencement, proctor-
ing of exams and working at the Graduate Record ex-
aminations.

During Spring Festival, the Alpha Phi Omegas
handled the refreshment concession to earn funds
for their social program. This program was dotted with
many gala affairs. A Fall hayride, the annual banquet
in December, a spring picnic in North Park, and nu-
merous smokers afforded ample opportunities for the
members pleasure.

Members represent those men who were or are at
the present time registered with the Boy Scouts of
America. Those who can most readily ﬁnd interests in
helping others are invited to join.

Officers for the year were: Earl Jacob, President;

159

Honorary Activities Society

Cwens, the sophomore honorary activities society,
has long been one of the busiest groups on campus. The
(lwens begin their year when they are tapped at Tap
Day. Qualiﬁcations are cooperation in the various
freshmen activities such  customs, guild programs,
and mentor groups. A 2.0 average is also a prerequisite.

(‘wens strive for leadership, scholarship, and fel-
lowship among the sophomore Women. This year the
Cwens served as aides for the freshmen guild program.
In addition, they worked on such projects as hostessing
for the Nationality Rooms, ushering at Heinz Chapel
services, and editing the (lwen Directory.

In spite of the numerous activities, Cwens still
found time for a weiner roast, swimming party, and
monthly social meetings. Through the many activities
and social events, the Cwens ma(le closer friends and
rendered service to the University. The Anglo-Saxon
word “flvven” means “queen” and “bread—giver”, but
it has come to mean honor, scholarship, and above all
—unselfisl1 service.

Officers for the year were  follows: President,
Peggie Cochrane; Vice-President, Grace Salzman; Sec-
retary, Mary Ellen 1\Iiller; Treasurer, Caryl Snyder;
and VV. S. G. A. representative, Reva Parish.

Honorary Commercial Education Fraternity

Delta Delta Lambda, honorary Commercial Ed-
ucation fraternity named for Dr. Daniel D. Lessen-
berry, has as its aim the honoring and encouraging of
active scholarship in the field of commercial education.

The junior and senior students in the department
of commercial education recognized the need, because
of the increased growth of the commercial education
department at the University of Pittsburgh, for an
organization which would bring them closer together
and further the principles for which they stood.

Delta Delta Lambda carried out this purpose dur—
ing the year, serving all the commercial students,
but especially those on the campus, by providing a
medium through which the social—business problems
could be discussed.

This was accomplished by introducing outstanding
leaders in the field of commercial education and by
fostering a social spirit among the members of Delta

Delta Lambda.

The oﬁicers for the year were as follows: President,
 Peterson; Vice—l’resident, Ruth Boksenbaum;
Secretary, Virginia l\IcCullough; Treasurer, Ruth

Druids

Honorary Activities Fraternity

In 1907 a group of prominent upperclassmen at
Penn State organized the ﬁrst chapter of Druids to honor
freshmen who had distinguished themselves on campus.
In 1920 Pitt’s Delta chapter was organized and joined
a group of six activities fraternities throughout the na-
tion which had adopted the name of Druids.

Last spring, following a period of two inactive
years, the wearers of the skull and dagger were reorgan-
ized into an honorary activities fraternity. The aim
of the reorganized chapter as expressed in the new
constitution is to “encourage student participation in

Honorary Electrical Engineering Fraternity

The activity of Eta Kappa Nu, the honorary
Electrical Engineering fraternity, has increased rapidly
since its reactivation in 1946. Its membership has in-
creased despite a change in the qualiﬁcation for mem-
bership. The program for each semester is so arranged
so as to provide at least two or more social functions.

Membership in Eta Kappa Nu is reserved for
those men who have demonstrated marked abilities
in scholarship and individual attainments, and who
possess qualities which indicate they will be leaders in
their chosen profession. It aims to assist the members
throughout their lives in becoming outstanding men in
the engineering profession.

The organization also aims to be a constructive
force in helping fellow members and non-members alike
in improving the standards of the Whole electrical engin-
eering profession, the course of instruction and the in-
stitutions with which each chapter is associated.

Thomas Hohing, Vice-President; Richard Dean, Cor-

responding Secretary; Joseph Koepﬁnger, Treasurer;

Marshall, the local honorary taps junior men and wo-
men who have a quality point average of 2.0 or better.

This past year saw the revival of the traditional
pre—legal forums, sponsored by John lVIarshall and open

with “How to Enter Law School," as presented by a
member of the Law School faculty. The other forum
featured former members of John l\/Iarshall now in law
school. with their ideas and experiences with life upon
the fourteenth ﬂoor.

New innovations in John lVIarshall this year saw
the club adopt a new streamlined system of tapping,
and an impressive initiation.

Still on the calendar were the bi-annual banquets
at the Fairfax and the monthly business meeting in
the Cathedral.

In the future, John Marshall hopes to extend its
services to the pre-legal student, member and non-
member alike, and to join with legal honoraries in other
schools in a national organization.

Lee Karageorge

Delta

Honorary Journalism Fraternity

Pitt’s chapter of Pi Delta Epsilon, national honor-
ary journalism fraternity. celebrated its third year on
campus  hosts to the National Convention June 11
and 12. After replacing Xylon. a women’s honorary,
shortly after the war, Pi Delt has come a long way in a
short time. Under President Lee Karageorge and Fac-
ulty Advisor Robert X. Graham, the fraternity this
year sponsored a writing contest for members of the
journalism classes and publications staffs, awarding cash
prizes for top entries in various writing ﬁelds.

Composed of veteran members of all Pitt. student
publications. the fraternity, in addition to promoting in-
terest in better journalism. provided a common group
in which editors and writers in all student ﬁelds can
meet and exchange ideas and information. Far from
ignoring social activities, the group sponsored several
select parties as well as planning entertainment for the
national delegates in June.

Cooperation among the three main publications,
the Pitt News, Panther, and Owl, hit a new high, partly
as a result of previous association of their members in
Pi Delt. VVith great improvements in campus publica-
tion on the books for next year, Pi Delt is looking to-
ward increased prominence in Pitt activities.

honors students in the College who have reached their
junior year with a quality point average of 2.5 or better.
Founded on campus in 1925, the fraternity was designed

ﬁsh aid and guidance in the early years of the group’s
existence.

to membership at Scholar’s Day exercises. Through
its regular monthly meetings, the organization provides
a means of social fellowship and opportunity for ex-
change of ideas.

The ultimate purpose of Pi Tau Phi can best be
explained by the following excerpt from the preamble
to its constitution: “We the members of Pi Tau Phi do
hereby band together to conserve and spread scholar-
ship, culture, and idealism . .. always striving by all
sound methods to stimulate serious thought and true
intellectual standards.”

Scabbard And Blade

National Honorary Military Society

D. Company, Seventh Regiment, the National
Society of Scabbard and Blade, entered its second dec-
ade of service on the Pitt campus this year. In this
third year of post-war activity, the Pitt company en-
deavored to live up to the high ideals conceived by the
Society’s founders. The prime purpose of Scabbard and
Blade has been to promote and reward efficiency in the
training of Reserve Officers through R.O.T.C. and to
assist and cooperate with the Military Department.

The past year has been an eventful one for Scab-
bard and Blade. The men of D Company have, in
addition to their own private social events such as
dinner dances and picnics, sponsored the Nlilitary Ball
for the students of the University.

For the second straight year, Pitt has placed high
in the Society’s national riﬂe matches. The basic stu-
dents of the Corps probably feel that the reorganization
of the famous Pitt Riﬂes was the most important
activity of this military honorary. Those who attended
the Voice and command sessions found them very
valuable.

Pharmaceutical Fraternity

Kappa Psi Pharmaceutical fraternity, founded i11
1879 finished another successful year as an integral
part of the numerous fraternities on campus. Although
organized for the mutual beneﬁt of the brothers to in-
culcate industry, sobriety, and mutual fellowship and
esteem, the brothers also foster pharmaceutical re-
search and high scholarship. The Kappa Psi’s com-
pleted a well-rounded year of social, athletic and inter-
fraternal activities.

If the men of Kappa Psi are  successful at their
profession as they are at social affairs, the nation is i11
for a very special batch of ingenious workers. The first
social gathering of the year was held at the Concord
Cafe, an informal dinner. This was followed by a
smoker at the Penn-Shady Hotel that featured Dr.
Edward P. Claus who spoke on “Fraternalism.” Be-
sides the usual picnics, weiner roasts, and bowling ses-

sions, the highlight of the social season came after initia-
tion when the men of Kappa Psi honored their grad-
uating brothers with a May Dance.

Recently one of the members of the fraternity was
made an oﬂicer in the district province. Kappa Psi will
play host in the fall of 1949 when the Province Conven-
tion will be held in Pittsburgh.

In keeping with the professional spirit, Kappa Psi
offered their services at the annual spring convention
of the Pittsburgh branch of the American Pharmaceu-
tical Association and had their members serving as
guides. Thus, the Kappa Psi’s neglected no phase of a
complete fraternal life.

The officers for the year were: John Harrington,
President; Wooda Hixenbaugh, Vice—Regent; Ralph
Kim, Secretary; Harry Soles, Treasurer.

Honorary Dramatic Fraternity

Theatron, honorary dramatic fraternity, was or-
ganized in 1938 for the purpose of providing recognition
for those students and faculty members whose work in
or with campus theatrical productions was of superior
quality. Qualiﬁcation for nomination is that the candi-
date be a member of Pitt Players and that he demon-
strate sustained talent, ability, and initiative in the
accomplishment of his duties.

Using as their symbol the traditional Greek Mask
of tragedy, members of Theatron hope to stimulate and
perpetuate an appreciation of “good theatre” within
their own ranks as well as among the entire student body
of the University. It was to this end that the members

The Students’ Governing Body

A student poll, and advisory system. and a new
demonstration block were the three most important
successful projects of the Student Congress of 1948-4!).
Under the leadership of President Larry Burwinkle the
ﬁfteen members of Congress strived to interpret the
wishes of the student body, and to provide services for
the student welfare.

Since the members of Congress wanted to draw into
activities as many interested students as they could,
they initiated a policy last spring of appointing to their
various subordinate organizations students who were
not members of Congress. In accordance with this
policy Abby Clark was chosen to be chairman of the
Pitt Chest Drive, which overreached its goal this year:
Joe Santone was named to represent Congress on the
Publications Board: Robert Dickey remained as stu-
dent representative to the University Athletic Commit-
tee. and Jeanne Ditz was Congress’ appointment to the
policy-making University Committee on Political
Speakers. All these appointees worked successfully
. . with their respective committees and reported faith-
Larry Burwinkle fully to Student Congress.

Pep rallies and hard-earned victory rallies during
the football season started the program of school ac-
tivities in the fall. Pat Leix with her assemblies com-
mittee provided a bonﬁre rally before the ‘Vest Virginia
game. as well as other rallies.

In order to encourage more school spirit Student
Congress appointed Flora Diemert, recording secretary
of Congress, to Work with Captain Hamilton, new Ath-
letic Director, to plan a more colorful Demonstration
Block for the football season of 1949-50. Financial sup-
port by the Athletic Department promises reactivation
of the block. which has been defunct this year. Plans
are now under way to insure student cooperation for
the project.

Also during football season Student Congress
worked with the University to sponsor the High School
Day Coke Dance, first of its kind at the University.
After the hlarquette game on October 16, hundreds
of high school students who had attended the game had
f11n at the dance in the Syria Nlosque. where Pitt stu-
dents entertained them. Expansion of this hospitality
program is now being discussed.

Another innovation in student life this year was
the Student Poll, which was begun to more adequately
determine the needs and wants of the students in the
University. Tom Ryan. chairman, reported that trial
polls revealed the system to be more than 97376 ac-

curate. and the service is now ready to be used. An im-
portant result of the organization of this poll was the
addition of a class in the Psychology Department on
Public Opinion Surveys.

A more extensive academic advisory program was
also effected by Congress. A program was submitted
by Dr. Rodger Russell and student chairman Audrey
\Vesterman approved by Student Congress. and sub-
sequently effected by the Deans. Every student with
a designated major or intended major may now have a
permanent advisor of his own request.

Complete revision and clariﬁcation of University
social rules, for the first time in many years, was the
product of the Soical Committee which worked hard
this year under Chairman Dave Fox. The prompt and
efﬁcient actions of the Appointments Committee chair-
maned by Bob Silberstein permitted better planning of
student dances and Scholars’ Day. The Assemblies
Committee in the spring semester sponsored for the
students such speakers  Frank Gervasi, Stuart Chase,
Chancellor Fitzgerald, and Ogden Nash.

VVith a genuine wish to furnish the students with
a better-rounded University life, the members of Stu-
dent Congress. assisted by their advisors, Professor
Louis Johnston and Dr. Rodger Russell, successfully
completed these projects.

l\len’s Council

Men’s Governing Organization

A truly progressive l\Ien’s Council represented the
men of the University for the 48-49 term. The Council
investigated and presented photographic data as to
the athletic situation to the Faculty Athletic Commit-
tee. Improvement of the program began immediately.
Other changes included the streamlining of the cus-
tom exam and upper class counselor program in order
to beneﬁt the freshmen more efficiently.

Freshmen are given a well—rounded orientation
program. The hlost capable of these students are
awarded the Panther Key.

hIen’s Council sponsored the Freshmen Smoker
and iVIixer Dances, with ofﬁeial recognition given them
by representation on Student Congress and the Pub-
lications Board.

Election to hIen’s Council occurs in the spring
when all men presenting a nomination petition are given
consideration. After the bitter competition for council
seats, the council settles down to do its constructive
and progressive job of representing the men of the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh.

Oﬂicers for the year were: Gene Thrasher, Presi-
dent; James Lauble, Vice-President; Robert Kaufman,
Secretary; Carl Angstrom, Treasurer: James Barto,

Military Science Department

The Reserved Officer's Training Corps reorganized
their program, after the War, to include iI1 both the
elementary training and advanced training those sub-
jects found most necessary for the training of ofﬁcers.

During the two years of elementary courses, a stu-
dent is instructed in the formal rules generally applic-
able to the army as a whole. Study in the advanced
courses is of a specialized type designed to qualify se-
lected students for reserve commissions.

In these advanced courses, the cadet studies such
subjects as military leadership, personnel management,
military problems of the United States and occupied
territories, military law, operation of antiaircraft ar-
tillery, and the theory of joint operation of the land,
sea, and airforces.

Col. John I. Hincke is the head of the staff of the
Department of Military Science. Besides their work
with this department, Captain Hunter acts as drill
coach for the University Band and Sgt. Shablowski
coaches both the Varsity and R.O.T.C. Riﬂe Teams.

mote those activities which will best provide for con-
tinued development of the basic professional students.
The organization also aims to maintain high standards
for the school and to uphold ideals for the nursing pro-
fession.

Many of the social functions sponsored by the
association have. through student response, become
traditional. The special parties held at Halloween. at

('hristmas time and on St. ]’atriel<'s Day. now hold a
very deﬁnite place iii the total program. A l\Iusicale.

dents in the basic professional program.

Alpha Tau Delta, professional nursing sorority.
is the o11ly one of its kind on campus. It has just com-
pleted its third year of active life at Pitt. Recently
Alpha Tau Delta was accepted in to the National Pro-

fessional Panhellenic Association

The purpose of the organization is to foster friend-
ship among college women in the nursing ﬁeld. Quali-
ﬁcations for students who have reached a junior status
in either the basic or advanced program are on the basis

of scholarship, practicability. and sociability. These

three qualities get the nurses’ Votes for future profes-

ional success.

Alpha Tau Delta specializes in social affairs that
will make their busy nurses forget stiff white uniforms
and give them their Well-earned relaxation. The social
season began their pledge parties followed by the initia-
tion dinner. Finally to end the social season. the girls
danced at their Spring Formal. Thus the girls had a

complete year of teas, parties and dances.

Indiana School for Nurses in 1922. The University of
Pittsburgh School of Nursing established Eta Chapter
on June 3, 1946 with thirty-three charter members.

The purpose of the organization is to foster high
professional standards, to encourage research and pro-
mote the maximum development of the nurse and thus
increase her capacity to serve her profession and
through it, society.

Membership is open to selected students enrolled
in the programs which lead to the Bachelor of Science
degree in Nursing ,Bachelor of Science degree in Nursing
Education and Master’s or Doctorate degrees with a
major in Nursing Education.

One of the basic requirements is that the student
has maintained at least a B average. Not more than one
ﬁfth of the total number of any one graduating class
may be elected to membership. One tenth may be
elected in the year preceding graduation and one
tenth in the year of graduation.

Members of the administrative and teaching staff
of the school of Nursing who have demonstrated marked
achievement in the ﬁeld of nursing and who have shown
special interest in Sigma Theta Tau may be elected as
associate members.

Members enjoyed a successful year both socially
and professionally. The group achieved great success
in heightening interest in nursing and new methods of
helping to cure the sick.

Omicron Kappa Upsilon

J. R. JACKSON, Vice-President

E. G. MEISEL, Secretcm -Treasurer

Omicron Kappa Upsilon, national scholastic honor
society for students of dentistry, is to dentists what Pi
Tau Phi is to students in the College. Membership to
this scholastic honorary is limited to twelve per cent
of the members of the graduating class who rank
highest in scholarship for the entire four—year dental
course. They must show outstanding character and
potential qualities for future professional growth and
attainment. Members are chosen for their abilities to
grow in dentistry and to capably take their place as
valued members of the community in which they prac-
tice.

The highlight of the year comes on Dental Alumni
Day, when those young men and women who have been
chosen by the faculty for tapping into Omicron Kappa
Upsilon are given their keys and certiﬁcates of member-
ship. On that day, the entire senior class is the guest of
the faculty, and the names of the honored students are

202

read. Faculty members, only, remain active members;
for they alone have powers of election to the organiza-
tion. The student members remain members without
the voting powers.

Omicron Kappa Upsilon was founded in 1914.
When Alpha chapter decided to expand in 1916, Beta
chapter at the University of Pittsburgh was formed.
Since that time, thirty-six chapters have been estab-
lished throughout the country to maintain the high
professional and academic standards of the whole ﬁeld
of dentistry. By maintaining these rigid standards of
competence, OKU has continually brought honor and
dignity to the profession it serves.

Each year the various chapters of this dental
honorary meet in convention. There they talk over
organization plans. The convention features talks by
prominent dental scientists and technicians on new
approaches and techniques in dentistry.

Psi Omega, national professional dental fraternity
is the “grand daddy” of dental fraternities in Pitts-
burgh. \Vhile the Psi Omega was founded forty-six
years ago, Nu, our local chapter has been in existence
for forty-one years.

Psi Omega is a fraternity with a purpose. In this
case it is to cultivate the social qualities of its members
and to surround each member with friends to whom he
can turn for advice and assistance when needed. Be-
sides these aims, the fraternity exerts its inﬂuence en-
tirely for the advancement of the dental profession in
methods of teaching and practice.

Not only are the Psi O’s noted for their profession,
they have also made a name for themselves in sports
and social activities.

They have always been well represented in all
intra-mural athletics. Their standing in the dental inter-
fraternity play-offs in football, basketball and softball
have always been high. Last year they won the H.E.
Friesell trophy for their superiority in the interfrater-
nity combined sports program.

In the social line, the dents are never too busy to
dream up a smash affair at their Chapter House. As
usual, the social season was highlighted by the Senior
Formal. Numerous house parties and dances  well as
Spring picnics rounded out the active Psi 0 social
program.

Helping the fraternity along this year was Dr.
J. F. l\IcParland  Deputy Councelor. Dr. l\IcParland
gave much time to the fraternity. His leadership has
done much to advance the fraternity.

Some sixty-six years ago. November 15. 1883 to
be exact, seven men gathered at the University of
l\Iichigan, one of the oldest dental schools in the cou11-
try. They formed an organization that was destined to
keep high the standards of dentistry by inculcating in
its men a spirit of real fraternal cooperation toward
scientiﬁc. ethical and professional progress in the ﬁeld
of dentistry.

From this meeting, Delta Sigma Delta has deve-
loped into the oldes and largest dental fraternity in
the world. Thirty-four chapters are now located in
the various dental schools throughout the country. In
addition to this, active graduate chapters are located in
every large city.

Sigma Chapter was born in February, 1903. From
this date, the chapter has gone ever forward to much

desired heights both scholastically and fraternally.
Delta Sigs are continually represented each year in
Omicron Kappa Upsilon, the National Dental Scholas-
tic honorary.

But all is not scholastic with the Sigs. The many
social functions throughout the entire year——formal
parties after football games, holiday parties and numer-
ous smokers, attest to this. The highlight of the social
season is the spring formal when Sigs and their dates
allow the social to take precedence over the academic.

For Delta Sigma Delta is a fraternity in the fullest
sense of the words. Its fraternal brothers are like real
brothers. The Delta Sigs have established a real unity
and harmony among themselves by hard work and co-
operation. Like in everything, this unbeatable combi-
nation works well for the Delta Sigma Delta dental
fraternity.

The purposes of Sigma Tau, the honorary frater-
nity for engineers, are: to recognize the achievements
of engineering students. promote the interests of the
engineering school, an(l encourage fellowship among
engineering students. Sigma Tau is the only member
of the Association of College Honor Societies to have a
chapter on the University of Pittsburgh campus.

l\Ien who have reached the level of juniors are
eligible on the basis of scholarship, practicality, and
sociability. These qualities are those which best give
promise of a successful engineering career.

Last year was an important one for the Psi chap-
ter of Sigma Tau. The highlight of the year was the
national convention held on the campus in the Foster
l\Iemorial. Other activities during the year were: a.
get-acquainted smoker for pledges. a (lance at South
Park Lodge, and an initiation banquet where forty
pledges were activated into the group.

Without Any Thought?

An artist produces a painting. The painting, if good, is dis-
played. Each individual that views the painting delves into the resaon
behind the artists composition: especially in this era of surrealistic
and impressionistic art. It may be overheard at any exhibit, “The
artist, most decidedly, put across this or that impression, feeling,
meaning through his composition or choice of objects in his paint-
ing.” No one knows what the artist had in mind when the master-
piece was painted. That artist may have painted this work for the
sheer joy of mixing colors with out any thought of a meaning or im-

pression to be put across.

Therefore in order to anticipate any misconceptions, we are here

setting down the why and wherefore of our division pages.

This, the 1949 Owl, has been divided into eight main sections
an(l thirteen sub—divisions. These divisions were chosen as a cross-
section of the myriad activities that make up student life. The divi-
sion pages are modern in design as is this new generation of college

graduates. (VVith this in mind, we planned these page arrangements.)

The background is an overall picture of students of the Univ-
ersity; the students that are the University. A section of the back-
ground has been ma(le lighter in tone than the overall picture to
connote that the student body is the whole of many groups. Classes,
the sum total of the University’s schools; organizations, fraternities
and societies, parts of the family that is the student body. Superim-
posed on the background is a picture depicting the section it forwards,
in focus on but a few students. As the whole is made up of groups,

so are the groups made up of individuals.

Last fall, the fifty members of the Heinz Chapel
Choir returned from their annual week of rehearsal
at Laurel Y Camp and swung into another year of
activity.

The choir, a familiar spectacle in their purple vel-
vet robes, is rated among the outstanding college choral
groups in the country. Dr. Theodore l\I. Finney or-
ganized the group in 1938 and has been with the group
ever since.

In its ten year span, the choir has grown from the
preliminary function of singing for services in the
Heinz Memorial Chapel to what is now a full schedule
of concerts and tours to Various cities and towns in this
section of the country.

208

However, every few weeks during the school year,
members of the choir put aside their music long enough
for events such as the guests of Chancellor Fitzgerald.
Add to this, private parties given by the members and
it isn't hard to see why the Heinz Chapel Choir sing
in such perfect harmony.

Any undergraduate student in the University may
try out for the choir by making an appointment with
Dr. F inney. After one year of participation, members
receive silver keys, and at the end of two years, they
are given gold keys.

Association with the choir does not stop at grad-
uation however, for there is an active alumni choir that
meets every two weeks throughout the school year.

l\r'Ir. Wleiss directs \V(rinei1's Choral in the Commons Room during Christmas “leek.

The "musical elevators" you hear I\I0nday and
Wvednesday seventh hour are all part of VVomen's
Choral. Since tl1e purpose of the choral group is to
foster music among the women of the University, the
organization is one of the busiest on campus.

In early November, the Choral sang their first pro-
gram in the (‘ommons Room. VVith the Christmas sea-
son at an early start, the girls joined the Pitt Singers,
lVIen’s Glee Club. and the YBICA for the annual Christ,-
mas Party. (‘hristmas also brought caroling in the halls.

\V0men’s Choral

Their spring tour took them to Gettysburg. Cham-
bersburg, and ;\It. Airy.

VVomen's Choral is made up of sophomore, junior,
and senior women who are selected by audition.

The Choral is directed by David VVeiss. with l\Iar-
ion Baeslak as accompanist.

Ofﬁcers for the year were: President. Rose l\Iarie

Keeping pace with the expansion of events at the
University this year, the l\Ien’s Glee Club inaugurated
a program of two concert tours to round out a successful
musical season.

Under the direction of David Weiss, the sixty
Voice choir has had a prominent place in all school
activities. There first public appearance took place at
the beginning of the year at the Chancellor’s Recep-
tion, where before Pitt parents, the Chancellor, and
guests, the Glee Club demonstrated the reason for its
popularity.

The Glee Club gave concerts at the Carnegie Col-
lege Club, the Presbyterian Hospital, and, for its home
concert, at Stephen Foster 1\Iemorial. In between
times, there was time to add to the Christmas season
at Pitt by singing carols in the Commons Room and
joining Pitt Singers and VVomen’s Choral for a Christ-

210

mas party that featured Santa Claus as chief guest.

The eastern concert tour taken between the fall
and spring semesters included stops at Reading, Scran-
ton, and Atlantic City. The western tour was taken in
April.

Added to the Glee Club as a specialty was the Var-
sity Quartette.

As usual, the real culmination of the year took
place at the annual banquet where keys were distrib-
uted for outstanding work in music.

Oﬂicers for the year were as follows: President,
VValter J. Fleming; Vice-President, VVayne lVIcCoy;
Secretary, John ‘Wilson; Business Nlanager, James W.
Chrissis; Assistant Business Managers, Jerry Krantz,
Richard Campbell, and Henry George.

Three years ago a group of men and women, mem-
bers of Women’s Choral and Men’s Glee Club, formed
the Pitt Singers. Although an informal group their
abilities were soon displayed at programs presented in
the University and at local affairs.

These abilities were apparently not to be denied for
in its second year a budget was provided by the admini-
stration. The membership had also grown to thirty-
five participants chosen from its elder relatives in the
Music Department. Appearances were well received at
such places as Seton Hill and Aspinwall Veteran’s Hos-
pital.

This year the membership has increased in strength
to forty-two. The outstanding performance of the year
was when the group sang with the lVIen’s Glee Club for
the Carnegie College Club. It is hoped that in the fu-
ture the “Singers” will take many more trips of this
type.

Pitt Singers

An attempt has been made to give an opportunity
to sing to those who cannot attend the other full time
musical organizations. In View of these developements
and an increased budget, a separate performance is
planned. In preparation for this the eighth ﬂoor of the
Cathedral resounds every Thursday duringthe ﬁfth hour.

The featured soloists for the past year were Ethel
l\I. Childs and Anthony Picci, soprano and tenor re-
spectively.

As has been said before the Pitt Singers are “bound
to be hear( ” and if the same type of interest is shown
in the future, there will be little doubt as to the group’s
ﬁxation.

Ofﬁcers for the year were: President, Richard l\T.
Pfeiffer; Vice-President, Ethel lVI. Childs; Secretary,
l\Iary T. Logan; Business l\Ianager, Richard R. Camp-

The Publications Board is the policy making body
of Pitt’s three main publications. The Board is com-
posed of three Executive Committees: The Pitt News,
The Owl, and The Panther. The Executive Committees
are made up of the editors and business managers of
the three publications, faculty members and students
appointed by Student Congress an(l Men’s Council.
Each Executive Committee holds periodic meetings and
discusses the pros and cons of meeting the problems of
their publication. Together, as the Publications Board,
they discuss recommendations of the Executive Com-
mittees, presented to the Board for ﬁnal decision.

Vade Mecum

This year the Board accomplished a great deal.
Some of the major measures were: a committee set up
to coordinate the business systems of the three publica-
tions; the appointment of the editors and business man-
agers at an earlier date than had been set in past years;
a committee to investigate the off-set method of print-
ing in regards to the newspaper and magazine; and the
purchase of a vari-type machine. Along with the major
recommendations, many minor measures were institut-
ed in the program for better publications.

Virginia Fansler: Peggy Evans; Lois Hite.

Aside from the three main publications on Pitt  ass
campus, there are handbooks published each year by M g P p

several of the larger organizations on campus. These
handbooks provide freshmen and upper-classmen with
information about activities and other facts of interest
to students at Pitt.

  

 

During the spring and summer, a staff appointed
by the Women’s Self Government Association Writes
and edits the women’s handbook, the Vade Mecum,
that is distributed to all women students at fall registra-
tion. This book serves as a guide, not only for freshmen,
but for upper-class women as Well, to all phases of stu-
dent life. Editor for this year’s Vade Mecum was Peggy
Evans, and the members of her staff were Ginny Fansler,
Lois Hite, and Jayne Bibby.

Men’s Council publishes a similar handbook, the
Compass, for men students each September. The editor
is appointed by the Dean of Men and this year’s editor
of the Compass was Maurice S. Hepps.

Two other handbooks published by campus organ-
izations are the Interfraternity and Panhellenic hand-
books. These booklets, put out by Interfraternity Coun-
cil and Panhellenic Association, contain information
about the social fraternities and sororities at Pitt. In-
cluded in these handbooks are the histories, officers,

active members, and ofﬁcial emblems of the fraternities
and sororities.

Interfraternity Council publishes its handbook in
the fall. The Panhellenic Handbook is published each
spring prior to Women’s rushing. Both are available to
any’ student who is interested in joining a social fra-
ternity or sorority. V

FRESHMEN

First thing on tl1e 1948--1-9 calendar, the Y , Fresh-
Inan Camp was probably the longest-remenibered event
of the 'ear for many Pitt men, freshmen and uppereluss-
Inen alike. Held at Cainp Kon-0-Kwee. near Zelien-
ople, Pa., the weekend served ' an introduction to Pitt
student leaders and faculty advisors for the 100—odd
freshrnen who attended.

For the freshmeli. the line to the bus wa; just a
continuation of the 1‘egistration line. At the Camp.
they piled off. sat around while their living quarters
were as '__ned, then filled in the rest of the afternoon
with softball games and s m1nin,{.,

Their ﬁrst night was the oee: on for Ineetin _ ad-
visors from the student body and faculty. as each coun-
selor outlined his particular function at Pitt.

Hi5_,>‘l1li,g‘l1t of the evening‘ was Dr. John 1\I.l*‘e1‘gn-
son’s (lisse1'tz1ti(>n on ‘My *2] Years at Pitt.’ “Fergie"
was well on l1is way to he -olning a t1‘:1(liti0n with an-
other Class of Pittites. Before the evening ended, tl1e
frosh eurnpers haul lea‘1‘11e(l most of the football songs
and (-heels for the eolning gritl se21s011.

Between sports events Saturdzzy, the boys pre-
p2'1re<l skits and sinu‘ teams for inter-sc-l100l (rolnpetition
in the evening‘, prograln. Counselors. too. turned i11
smne ﬁne entertuiinnent.

Sun<l:1_v morning after church services, the new
men got their ﬁnal pep talk 011 Pitt, pitted their ‘All
Stars‘ against the counselors in :1. softball game, then
piled on the lmses to go from ‘(',‘ai1np to Czunpils’ and 21
new life at the university.

The best indication of how far the ['niversity has

The .\Iost Valuable Player Awards are given to
l’itt’s outstanding athletes of the year. These awards
were presented for the first time last year to give re-
cognition to the best players for their sportsmanship,
playing, and ability to cooperate with their fellow
players.

The athletes whose pictures are on this page have
been selected for this award by their teammates in a
secret, mailed—in ballot conducted by the Sports Staff

of the Owl.

Bill Mt-Peak
A four year great at Pitt, Bill was acknowledged
by his teammates as their top man for the second year
in succession. He was the true spark of the 1948 sur-
prise Panthers at his terminal post and played a mag-
nificent game on offense and defense alike. Had it not

Most Valuable

Bill Mt-Peak, Football

been for the Dark Age of athletics at Pitt during the
first three of l\IcPeak’s four years in collegiate football,
he would very likely have been the choice on many an
All American squad. All at Pitt wish Bill the greatest

of success in his newly chosen field, Pro football.

Clarence’ Doak

ln the first i\lost Valuable Player selection the
track team has participated in. Clarence Doak was
elected top man by his teammates. An outstanding
track man for the past few years. Doak was undefeated
in the low hurdles in 1948. Taking over a spot on the
shuttle hurdle team, a position he never had run before,
Doak led the team to a first place in the Penn Relays
of 194-8. He is one of the holders of the worlds record
for the fifty yard indoor low hurdles. A true gentleman
and an outstanding athlete Doak has often demon-
strated his fine spirit by teaching track novices in the
low hurdles.

Dick Petro

Following in the apparent spirit of selection the
swim souad saw fit to also select a man who has been
outstanding since his freshman year as their l\Iost Val-
uable. Dick Petro came to Pitt heralded as one of the
best A..-LU. competitors the district has ever seen. He
proved his notices by aiding coach Grady turn out’ a
outstanding squad for the past two years. Dick is
equally at home i11 the free style events as he is in the
440 relay. His speciality, however is the free style in
which he aims for the record times.

Dodo Canterna

set up plays and scored the points. Sammy broke the
all time scoring record for a single season and Dodo
holds the Stadium scoring record for one game. Thus it
was significant that two great Pitt athletes were con-
sidered equal by the men who know them best.

Smarting from a year of frequent football set-
backs and even more frequent leaks from the various
appointed investigating committees, the Faculty Com-
mittee on Athletics caused the entire city of Pittsburgh
to buzz by announcing the selection of Captain Tom
Hamilton of the United States Naval Academy as its
choice for the office of Athletic Director. This announce-
ment came in the wake of an exceptionally successful
grid season and assured all connected with the Univer-
sity that Pitt was once again climbing to great peaks
in the athletic world.

On February 1, "Blister" Hamilton began his
.. duties with the University and started to fulfill the
Frank Gar\'<-1', Gradilatc Manager of .\tl1leti(-s Inany m1f‘3C1eS Outllnefl by the C1t_V ‘newspapers lI1 tliell‘
pre—appo1ntment stories. Among his renovations were
the complete reorganization of the Physical Education
Department, establishment of new contacts with the
nations’ football attractions, and presentation of attrac-
tive offers to the district high school sports leaders,
for it was the popular belief that by the appointment
of a man of Hamilton's calibre to the head sports post,
the Administration had conceded to the fact that great
athletic teams produce a great institution.

Perhaps the happiest person at the announcement
of the appointment of Hamilton was Frank (larver.
former Sports Publicity Director, Acting Athletic Di-
rector and present Graduate hlanager of Athletics.
Frank performed exceptionally well in both previous
rolls and is maintaining his superior rating with the

The President llonorarius

Dr. John Gilbert Bowman

An energetic idealist, President H()N()R.\RIL'S Jonx
G. B0\v.\1AN believed in the present and future students
of the University more than anyone else. He dedicated
his life to the ('athedral of Learning, which he has ex-
plained simply, represents on the outside what a man
should be on the inside. He believed and worked on the
principle that the student would be taught by his sur-
roundings. Guided ﬁrmly by this belief he did not yield
from l1is purpose of building a University of which we
would all be proud.

Few students from the Class of 19-19 know the man

whose faith raised this Cathedral of Learning, for Dr.
Bowman has been living for the past few years in re-

21

tirement at l1is_farm in Befdord County. He no longer
takes part in the everyday administration of the Univer-
sity he helped build, although he occasionally attends
lfniversity functions.

The class of 1949 has left its mark in the stone and
mortar of the Cathedral of Learning. The building too
has left some irremovable marks on the minds and
hearts of this graduating class. We will forever be
aware of days of youth and learning when we see this
tower from all parts of the city of Pittsburgh, or when
its vision is recalled in some far off place in the World.
Dr. Bowman can truthfully feel that his faith in the
students of the Lniversity has been rewarded.

A well coached. well conditioned Panther football
team upset all pre-season predictions and caused all
the local sports scribes ma11y embarrassin,<_§ moments by
turning in a respectable record of six wins against onl_V
three defeats. Doing a complete about face. after the
never mentioned 1947 season of eiglit defeats and one
win. the Pitt squad stormed over such grid stalwarts
as Indiana. Purdue, and undefeated Penn State. Even
though the defeats were by comparative large margins
they may be overlooked when one considers that
they were inflicted by three of the nation's top teams,
Southern Blethodist, Notre Dame, and Ohio State.

The past season produced a few outstanding play-
ers among which Nick Bolkovac looms as a certain All
American in his two remaining years. Nick scored the
winning‘ touchdown against Penn State when he inter-
cepted a pass.

Chancellor Rufus H. Fitzgerald

The Chancellor’s Message To Seniors:

You who have been students here the past year
have lived at a time of greatness in the history of the
University. In the University and in the community
around it faith and optimism stirred men’s imagination
and set them working with fresh energy. People have
developed new enthusiasm for what the University is
trying to do. An immediate need was some buidlings
and equipment for the University to do better its work
of teaching and research.

l\Iembers of the Board of Trustees and of the Fac-
ulty, leading citizens of \\'estern Pennsylvania, and
many Alumni gave their time and their money. Last
June an anonymous gift of $3.,00(),000 was made for the
l\'Iedical School; in September a gift of $]3,600,()()0
came from the A. ‘V. Mellon Educational and Charit-
able Trust for a Graduate School of Public Health:
one VVestern Pennsplvania corporation gave as much as
$300,000: one Alumnus gave $°250,00(): many others
gave generously, according to their more modest means.

These gifts of money mean much, but what is be-
hind the giving and what the gifts are to mean to stu-
dents and teachers in the University is much more. The
Ifniversity is here to help you and the students who
come after you develop the ability to think, values by
which you will live, and courage to act. Above all, we
hope that this University may help you in the great
adventure of life to be your best self.

For the understanding‘. the help, and the loyalty of
you. the students. I am deeply grateful.

The twenty-seventh edition of Doctor H. C. Carl-
son’s caravan piled up an eleven win, fourteen loss re-
cord in their annual Cooks tour of the United States.
It was the old story of mighty-midgets doing a mighty
ﬁne job.

The annual ““'in-em-all” battle cry went by the
boards in early season when powerful North (‘arolina
handed Pitt the season’s worst heating 77-42. At Ntiami
the Panthers dropped their first contest 58-59 and
bounced back the following night to beat the same
aggregation 80-4-8. A mi(l—season addition to the sched-
ule was Michigan. At Ann Arbor the caravan was de-
feated (SQ-4-—1.

An innovation to the Panther schedule was a far
western swing between semesters. Big Bradley Tech
dropped the Panthers by two points, at Denver it was
Denver 4«7~Pitt 46 and the following night Utah 65—
Pitt -14. It was Paciﬁc Coast teams for the rest of the
tour with Pitt losing close games to California. Stan-
ford. Loyola of Los Angeles, U.(7.L.A., and Arizona.

The first game after the new semester began found
Pitt dropping “'estminister on the Panther home court
50-41. A week later Pitt lost to West Virginia 54-51.
At State College the Lions dropped Pitt 4-9-38. The
Panthers wound up the season dropping (‘arnegzie Tech
76-49. W'estminister 50-40 and taking an upset victory
from “est Virginia 34-32 in overtime.

Coach Ralph Nlitterling gives pre-game instructions.

An abbreviated season plus the late arrival of
Spring provided the Panthers with their most disappoin-
ting season in recent years.

A lack of indoor practice facilities hampered the
squad considerably and as a result, opening day found
Penn State dropping the Pitts 2-1. The next day it was
the Lions again 14-8, while a week later, it took Juanita
15 innings to eke out a 3-9 victory. In rapid succession
the home nine was set back by Geneva 9-5 and Penn
State 13-7, but bounced back to defeat State in extra
innings 4-3. Mitterling’s men made it two in a row by
defeating W and J but VVest Virginia broke up the
streak with an 11-4 victory. Late in the season in their
ﬁnal Victory Pitt defeated W and J 3-1 and a few days
later ended the season dropping two close games to
West Virginia 4-3 and 4-9.

Pitching honors for the season were taken by Calder
with two wins and three losses, while Huder notched
the runner-up spot with one Victory. Hitting was a
weak department with the Pitt Squad. McGill swatted
.400 and Couch took second place with .364. Of the
four round trippers of the year, Snyder slammed two
while Canterna and Couch each turned in one.

The ’48 Panther track team came through with
one of its best seasons in recent years.

In the Outdoor Track Meets, the Panthers swept
through Ohio University, VVestern Reserve and VVayne
College. Against Miami Universiity of Ohio, Pitt lost
three ﬁrst place standing out of ﬁfteen events. Penn
State the roughest foe on the trackmen’s sche(lule,
took ten ﬁrst place standings to Pitt’s ﬁve.

At the West Point Relays, Pitt captured ﬁrst place
in the broad jump with Douglas going Q2 feet 11 inches.
Doak captured second place in the 80 yard hur(lles and
Douglas repeated for the Blue and Gold by coning in
third in the 60 yard dash.

In the outdoor Penn Relays, Pitt came in ﬁrst in
the Shuttle Hurdle, the time 61 and .2 seconds. Doug-
las, Doak, Brennﬂeck and lVIorton captured second
place in the 440 relay. In the 880 relay hlorton, Brenn-
ﬂeck, Doak, and Douglas took second. Douglas paced
the broad jump doing 23 feet 6 inches.

Herb Douglas added his name and the name of
the University of Pittsburgh to the glory of the 1948
Olympics at London, England.

On the Schenley Park course, the Pitt Harriers
took three meets out of four to have their traditionally
ﬁne season. VVith an inexperienced squad the harriers
dropped Westminister. Case and VVestern Reserve while

Ben Grady’s hustling swim squad had a near per-
fect season in 1948-49, losing only to Penn State. Even
though the Lions broke the two year Panther win streak
Pitt amassed 378 points in eight meets to 204: rung up
by the opposition.

The season opened with an overwhelming victory
over Allegheny. At Meadville, the Panthers set two
pool records. The new marks were in the 60 yard free
style and the 440 yard free style relay. The three suc-
ceeding meets brought the Panther win streak to ten.
The tenth meet, at Slippery Rock, resulted in the es-
tablishment of another pool record. The Pitt 400 yard
free style relay team, sparked by Dick Petro, pared
two—tenths of a second off the old mark. Another pool
record fell as Dick Petro trimmed the 100 yard free
style mark to 5 :39, a highlight of the Westminster con-
test. Kenyon went the way of the vanquished as the
Panthers rode a victory wave of twelve straight. Pitt
dropped the thirteenth meet to State by one point, the
400 yard free style relay being the crucial event. Pitt
took Kent State to wind up the season with a seven win,
one loss record.

Golf

In their second year of competition after a four
year layoff, the Pitt linksmen posted a record of 2 wins
against four losses. It was a decidedly better showing
than that of the no win team of 1947-48.

The Panthers were solidly bumped by Penn State
in the season opener and dropped matches to Army
and Cornell on their eastern swing. Locally they notch-
ed two easy wins over W and J, While dropping close
matches to West Virginia and Juanita.

Sparkling play was turned in by Mihocko, Daker and
Mohr. The Pitt golfers feel that they have gotten the
“bad ones” out of their systems and with two years ex-
perience plus the return of seasoned players, plan to
win em all in ’49.

Tennis

Wet weather and a lack of adequate practice facil-
ities an old Pitt nemesis proved to be a stumbling block
to Panther netmen during the 1948 season. Bright
spots in an otherwise mediocre year were the outstand-
ing singles play of Stan Weil and the doubles play of
the Weil-Schoenberger combination.

Pitt opened the season with a 6-3 setback at the
hands of West Virginia and was defeated following
weeks by Western Reserve and Penn State. The net-
men hit their stride late in the season by defeating city
rivals Carnegie Tech 7-2. Meeting W and J on home
grounds the following week, the Pitt men came away on
the short end of a 6 - 2 score. In their second meeting
with West Virginia the Panther team hit the victory
column again, winning 3 singles and 3 doubles to take
the match 6 - 3. The season was brought a close with a
6 - 3 loss to W and J and a 6 - 3 loss to Allegheny.

The outlook for the 1949 season is considerably
brighter for Pitt tennis fans. Two years experience and
the “promise” of more adequate practice facilities
should make a better style of play.

Riﬂe

Once again the Pitt rifle team is on it’s way to a
great season. Under the able coaching of Sergeant
Watts Shablowski and with Captain John Kelley as
officer in charge, this years team bids fair to match the
ﬁne records run up in the last four years. VVith the
season almost over the team has won three fourths of
their postal meets against the toughest competition in
the country.

In the annual Marine match in Maryland, Pitt
placed twelfth in a ﬁeld of fourteen competitors. Al-
though the results of the NRA sectional meet have not
yet been published, the Panthers have received an in-
vitation to the National Intercollegiate Meet which
indicates a good showing in the NRA meet.

In the newly formed Intra-City Intercollegiate
Riﬂe League Pitt scored victories over both Tech and
Duquesne. ‘The boys are conﬁdent of winning the team
trophy and {individual brassards that will go to
the winner.

The Registrar

This year every student in the University received
an up-to-date cumulative record of his credits and
grades. VVith this step the Registrar's office has at last
overtaken the post—war rush at Pitt. Actually, the new
streamline procedures in Dr. J. G. Quick’s office will
handle the 20,000 enrollment with more speed and
efficiency than was possible in the pre—war days when
there were only 12,000 students to process. The answer

"to the new efficiency is the International Business

l\Iachine system which has been installed on the eight-
eenth ﬂoor. VVorking sixteen hours a day, one of these
machines addresses pre—registration kits automatically
from master ﬁle cards at a speed of 80 lines per minute.
Still other I.B..\I. machines can turn out 100,000 grade
reports in  little  5-1 hours. The fastest hand re-
corder can do only about ‘25 such reports an hour. Late
in 1946, acting on the advice of assistant registrar E.A.
Batchelder, the University ordered an IBl\I system
specifically designed to handle the situation at Pitt.
When the new machines arrived, the Registrar's oﬂice
was behind by 350,000 in its grade reports, and losing
ground. Now in June, 194-9, the grade reports are up
to date and cumulative records, not issued since early
in 194-6, have been distributed.

10-18 was a year of fulfillment for many of the
dreams of Pitt Secretary Dr. John \Veber. Year after
year Dr. V\'eber has looked forward to the time when
a new science building. better sports’ facilities. libra-
ries, and student buildings would be added to the Uni-
versity. The announcement this year of two new
building programs was the first tangible evidence that
at last Dr. \Veber's hopes are to become a reality. A
graduate of the University, Dr. Wieber served as a
captain in the first Wvorld ‘Var before returning to
teach in the llechanical ‘Engineering department.
After serving as head of the )I.E. department. Dr.
“eber became business manager of the University in
1926. His other services to Pitt include membership on
the Board of Trustees and many years as supervising
engineer in the construction of the Cathedral and Heinz
(',‘hapel. Although his administrative duties as secretary
are exacting, Dr. Weber has still found time to serve on

the Board of Klanagers of Juvenile (‘ourt and as a mem-

ber of the (‘ity Planning (‘ommission.

Dr. J. Gilbert Quick

Intramurals

The 1948-49 Intramural sports program at Pitt hit
a new high in thrills. The year’s plans called for football,
bowling, badminton, basketball, wrestling, volleyball,
ping-pong, track, swimming and softball.

After a nip and tuck race the underdog Phi Gamma
Delta knocked over last years champions PiKA to take
the IF touch football championship. They in turn
were trounced by the Locals, winners in the Indepen-
dent league. In the third annual inter-school playoff
the locals went down to defeat before the Tech IM
champs.

In another hot race the two bowling leagues were
burning up the alleys. SAE proved the best of the
independent league.

In Badminton the Phi Gams again scored out PiKA
to take first place honors.

Intra-mural Wrestling was inaugrated this year
with Capelli, Hutchens, Abraham, Skirpan, Thomas
and Supinski taking the honors in their respective
weight ﬁelds.

As the Owl went to Press an exciting basketball
season was nearing its climax. The Educators, com-
posed of varsity football players were as usual leading
their league. In the fraternity loop the PiKA’s, Phi
Gams, Phi Eps and Theta Chi were set for the play-off.

Despite the curtailing of some events because of
the loss of Ellsworth ﬁeld for IM competition, Director
Leo Bemis was conﬁdent that the remaining winter and
spring events would be the best in Pitt’s history.

Women’s Sports

A well-rounded program of athletic activities is
supplied by the Physical Education classes, the Pro-
minaders and the Orchesis Club.

Square dancing, volleyball, basketball tournaments,
modern dancing and swimming are on the schedule of
the Phys Ed classes. These classes meet teams from Mt.
Mercy, PCW, and Carnegie Tech in inter-school games.

The Prominaders Club and the Orchesis Club
specialize in the teaching of square dancing and modern
dancing.

Another organization open to Pitt women is the
Women’s Athletic Association. The only requirement
for membership is that the girl must have completed a
full year term.

This year’s VVAA program has been very successful.
It began with a cook-out in Panther Hollow, followed
by badmington and archery competitions. Basketball,
volleyball, swimming and bowling proved popular dur-
ing the winter months.

Picnics and dances helped to complete the circle of
events. The officers for the year were: President, lVIary
Ruth Carson; Vice-President, Margery Black; Secre-
tary, Anne Livingstone; Treasurer, Eleanor Beige.

The song that goes, “oh, its great my boys to be a Greek!”
doesn’t apply to all of us. Only some of us are fraternity men
or sorority Women; some of us would like to be and are not;
some of us are and Would like not to be. But endorse or dis-
credit, we all know what fraternities mean on campus. They
almost seem to be campus: until DeSoto Hall, their houses
have been the only dorms; except for Military Balls, their
dances are the biggest successes; aside from a few, the campus
leaders are Greeks; discounting exceptions, their close—knit
fellowship is unexcelled. Good and bad, they characterize the
University. They are miniatures of its Work, its stubbornness,

its play, its progress.

Panhellenic Council

Panhellenic Council is made up of all the sororities
on campus, each sorority represented by two members.
Panhel irons out the perplexities of rushing and other
sorority problems, and in addition to that sponsors an
an educational and social program as a service to all
undergraduate women. It tries to establish unity among
all the women students at the University.

The year started off with the always impressive
Panhellenic Reception for Freshmen women which was
held in Commons Room.

This year the combining of Panhellenic and Inter-
Fraternity Sings into one Greek Sing was a complete
success. This sing gives an opportunity for friendly
competition between the sororities.

Panhellenic Ball, the traditionally formal dance
of the sororities was a better success even than those in
the past. On Tap Day the Panhellenic Scholarships and
the scholarship were awrded.

With the wholehearted support of the sororities
on campus, Panhel will always have bigger and better
things to look forward to in the years to come.

0fﬁce (If The [Dean 0f \V0men

In the thirty years since its establishment in 1919,
the office of the Dean of VVomen has grown to one of
the most important in the University. Headed by
Dean Helen Poole Rush. a stal’f of six works to inte-
grate Pitt women into a full program of social and extra-
curricular activities. The twelfth floor of the Cathedral
is _now ﬁrmly established as the women’s floor and pro-
vides a much needed center for women’s activities and
relaxation. The senior mentor system directed by Dean
Rush insures every freshmen woman an upperclass
friend and counselor during her first and hardest seme~
ster at Pitt. Helen Van Dyke is assistant to the Dean,
in charge of the Information room. Working closely
with her is Miss Elizabeth J. Wood who trains and
assists the nationality room hostesses in their service of
MISS Helen Poole Rush explaining Pitt to visitors. Jean R. Findley has charge
of the ‘Women's Housing and Job Placement bureau.
The Heinz (‘hapel is ably managed by assistant to the
Dean. Mrs. i\Ielrose Wveitzel. Patricia l\Iac Donald
assists Dean Rush in the supervision of the extensive
program of women's activities at the Ifniversity.

Alpha Delta Pi

“If wishing well were at our common and magic
laterns in each hand”——Alpha Delta Pi could not have
wished for a more successful year. Besides holding
campus offices and working in mny school organizations,
the girls kept in the social limelight with a full schedule
of activities.

The girls entertained at informal Halloween and
Thanksgiving dances, got out their formals for the
annual Black and White Diamond Ball at the Jacktown
Hotel and the Spring Formal at the house, and in their
spare time shined their ﬁrst place ﬂoat parade cup.

On May 15th Founder’s Day Banquet was held at
the University Club, and another year was coming to
an end. But even after the year was all over, they re-
membered their Seniors. Helen Rose Poole wearing her
shining Mortar Board Pin, Lucile Augustine carrying
a dog-eared mentor notebook, Dot Smith and Pat

O’Connell comparing the Senior Class and Sorority
gavels, Norma Blosser writing her new name Norma
Robinson, and Doris Dudley and Kay Ridge making
up Secretaries reports for Kappa Phi and Phi Sigma
Alpha.

Alpha Delta Pi sorority, as the ﬁrst secret sister-
hood for college women, appropriately enough had its
birthplace at Wesleyan Female College which is the
oldest women’s college in the world and the first of
such institutions to grant academic degrees to women.

From the day of its founding, the sorority has
been bound by the covenant that no girl could be taken
into membership save“such as may commend them-
selves for their intellectual and moral worth dignity of
character and propriety of department.” On these
foundations Alpha Delta Pi looks forward to the future.

Alpha Epsilon Phi

The strains of the national hymn of Alpha Epsilon
Phi sorority were being sung vigorously, but a little
sorrowfully, at the group’s last meeting of the year.
It was a big year for A E Phi but nothing could sway
Dean Sally Baer from her decision that “Next year will
be even bigger.”

It will be rather difﬁcult to beat the annual A E
Phi fashion show held at Hotel Webster Hall, the proﬁts
of which went to the United Jewish Fund. Also, their
spring formal at the Westmoreland Country Club was
“simply lovely” as described by Bobbie Feldman,
scribe, and sub-dean, Renee Shorin. Renee was secre-
tary to Panhellenic Council this year.

Tea dances and beneﬁt bridges, informal get-to
gethers with the Tech Chapter, the December dance
with family and alums in attendance, luncheons and
the Senior Breakfast, stood out in the minds of the

Seniors as activities which will make the year an unfor-
gettable one for them.

Of these Seniors, we ﬁnd Audrey Westerman,
secretary to Student Congress, at one time chairman of
the Customs Committee, and active at Pitt since she
was a Freshman.

Adlyn Letwin, program chairman, and member of
the Owl Editorial Staff Bea Schneirou, Iris Rosen,
Chari Baker, and treasurer, Renee Sheinburg found it
hard to believe that this was their ﬁnal meeting.

The strains of the national hymn of Alpha Epsilon
Phi sorority were dying away. The last meeting had
come to a close. The girls were sorrowful. However,
they were assured that the future years would be equally
as successful, and that Alpha Epsilon Phi would always
remain a campus force.

It looks as if Mina Serbin and Renee Sheinberg need a knitting
instructor.

Most any Monday night you would ﬁnd them all there.
happy to be “at Home”.

Muriel Thompson. Margie Bell, Lois Emmel, Joan
Martin, and June Hubbard were gathered around the
piano harmonizing a favorite song‘. while Rosemary
Loeffler was being coaxed into playing one “of her
own” tunes.

Off in a corner Carol K11rtz was telling Lynn
Gallada the details of a radio celebrity’s life; Sally
Mrvos and Jeanne Captain had their heads together
over eight knitting needles and two paris of argyle
socks.

If you heard someone expounding on practice
teaching you knew it was lVIary Logan or Ginny Rey-
nolds. Huddled together on the davenport (7. J. Becker
and Margie Maher were laughing about the funny in-
cidents that occured in their mentor groups.

l\Iary Englehart listened intently while Irene

Gursky told of her last weekend’s date. l\/Iary Lou Todd
reminded everyone of the coming frat dances and
Greenie wondered how soon the Theta (7/hi’s would be
over.

Marilyn Knisely and Marty lV[cl\Iichael ﬂoated a-
round on their ever-present cloud, while practical Pat
Holland worried about the national debt and her faith-
ful assistant, Ruthie Oartel. asked for the weekly fifteen
cents.

Taking top honors in the entertainment depart-
ment were Lupie and l\Iarjorie Donnellan with Phyl
Cooper, Judy Braun and Shilrey Davis as an enthus-
iastic audience.

Dolly Gates very seriously told Betty Lou Fennell
about her nomination for “man” of the year.

Delta Delta l)elta’s thirty third year at the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh began with a ﬂourish, when Betty
Jane Redman, social chairman, announced a beneﬁt
bridge to be held the ﬁrst week of school.

Since then, the Tri Delt sing team, Evie Thompson,
B. J. Redman, Bettie Milligan, Ruth King. Rose Boyd,
Dottie Clemens, and Libs Englehart, led by Rosemary
Parlack, practised through the Wee hours of the night,
while the football team, coached by Dolores N aughton,
practised throughout the day. Peggy Maquire, kept
all spare minutes ﬁlled with her cry, “On to the cellar,”
where the recreation room was taking shape.

At school, Martha Duffy ﬂew from meeting to
meeting. As chairman of the Customs Committee and
the Junior Prom, Duff was kept pretty busy. And so
was Jeanne Elliott who held down the position of Chair-
man of Traditions plus Fashion editor of the Panther.

285

“Three cheers for Pitt” yogied up a 7-0 victory over
State. Ruth King, Jean Ann Coyle, Libs Engelhardt,
and Janet Schorr rally-up spirit early Sat. morning.

Senior Mentors, King. Englehart, Schropp, and F laherty
made and received phone calls by the dozens (not all
from freshmen women). Annlou also acted as treasurer
of the senior class. Jean Ann Coyle aided the appoint-
ments committee of Student Congress while Dottie
Clemens, as chairman of the program committee for
the Heart Hop, contacted printers and musicians by
the dozen.

Janet Schorr and Rose Boyd were members of the
Customs Committee and the Sophomore program com-
mittee.

Bettie Milligan acted as social chairman of the
Housing Board. The busy year ended with the tradi-
tional Pansy breakfast and the annual Spring formal in
June. So Tri Delts carried on their tradition of service
to the group and school with members participating
fully in activities.

ﬂffiee 0E The Dean 0i’ lien

Student rallies, fraternities. veterans affairs, senior
placement and musical organizations are but a few of
the many activities that make the office of the Dean of
Men one of the busiest places in the (lathedral. Now
in his eighth year as Dean of Men, Theodore VV. Biddle
has as his goal the achievement of a well rounded stu-
dent life by every man at Pitt

Aiding the Dean in striving towards this goal are
seven assistants and directors. Fraternities are the
chief responsibility of E. J. Nlclntosh. assistant to the
dean, and other student activities fall under the super-
vision of “'illia.m S. Saalbach. (‘harles H. Ebert Jr. is
director of the placement. bureau and is a busy man
every year when thousands of prospective graduates
begin that search for a job.

A newcomer to the staff this year is Paul S. Loli-
meyer. adviser to student publications. By contrast,
the member longest on the Dean of 1\Ien’s staff is
\\'illiain Daufenbaugh, in charge of the information
room and the University marshalls, and now in his 24th
year at Pitt. The nationally known marching band
and orchestra are the domain of Director Robert L.

Kappa Alpha Theta

The members of Kappa Alpha Theta returned to
school from their national convention at Mackinac Lake
determined to keep the Theta kite ﬂying high. Start-
ing things off, we held a tea to bid good-bye to our
retiring House-mother, Mrs. Cooper, and to welcome
our new one, Mrs. Genge.

Our next project was the painting and redecorating
of our powder-room in the basement: here many riotous
evenings were spent  We spread more blue paint
through our hair than We put on the walls.

Monday nights were ﬁlled with dances with the
Pitt fraternities and Fireside Chats with our alum ad-
visors and Dean Rush. One Week-end is outstanding
in Theta memory—the week-end we forgot about books
and sleep and all went to Laurel Ridge. It took a whole
week to regain the lost sleep but not one ofus regrette(l it.

We returned home to plan our traditional Christ-
mas formal for which we gayly decorated our house
with mistletoe and holly.

Spring soon came bringing exams but we had our
moments of relaxation and fun at our lively Theta picnic
and our lovely Spring Formal. VVe were quite proud of
Kitty O’Hagan, our vice-president of Panhellenic Coun-
cil: Flora Diemert, our Student Congress secretary, and
Peggie (lochrane, our sophomore president of Cwens.
But all too soon the school year closed and regretfully
we bid goodbye to each other.

So the Theta kite continues it flight on year num-
ber eight. Eighty years of progress. Eighty years of
memories, sweet and lasting. Eighty years of friend-
ship and the close bond of sister hood in Kappa Alpha
Theta.

Thetas, Joanne Fisher, Pat Gaw, Pat Kirshhaumer, Caryl Snyder, Kitty (Yllagzili, Joyce Daniels, Marge Mosvr,
and F10 Diemert, look with pleasure at the first prize (-up won in the Pitt Chest Fund Variety Show.

Kappa Delta Phi

This year was an important and busy one for the
members of Kappa Delta Phi. Things began happen-
ing when the sorority received official recognization on
October 13, 1948, and President Sandy Thomas along
with Vice-President Betty Grace Blank rushed to
spread the news to the rest of the K. Delts.

Then things started in full swing. Beverly Schmidt
was kept busy writing the minutes and recording plans
while Jane Barthelemy budgeted the money t.o ﬁnance
activities.

A hayride, candy party, and a Christmas party for
orphans were the first activities of the new sorority.
The high-lights of the social season were the semi-formal
dance held in January at the Dormont New Century
Club, and the Founders’ Day Banquet in February.
Social Chairman, Marie Mance, and her committee of
Dorothy Ohlsson and Angie Bieno are planing for bigger

and better events in the future. As the first oﬁicial
rushing party was a great success, Olga Ivanowski,
rushing chairman is to be congratulated along with
Helen Conway and Agnes Iglar. They are working
hard making plans and getting ideas for the coming
rushing parties. Elaine Morgan is the jovial K Delt
who is always giving a friendly nod or making music
and laughter. The Kappa Delta Phi’s are well on their
way to becoming one of the outstanding sororities on
campus with one thought in mind—going national.

Almost as much business is handled by the Kappa
Delta Phi girls  at the New York Stock Exchange.
There are plans for parties, cramming For tests. writing
of papers, sipping of cokes, and an occasional political
discussion. It is truly hard to ﬁnd a more active group
than the K. Delts. We have already had one successful
year. Activities and scholarship with lots of fun blended
in will make the rest even better.

Kappa Kappa Gamma

VVith the Panhellenic Scholarship Cup for 1947
decorating the Kappa Kappa Gamma House and with
full memories of the wonderful social season of 1947,
Kappa’s started their 1947-48 school year.

Liz Holl, Kappa President, returned from Sun
Valley Convention with many new plans and sugges-
tions that helped Kappas plan a more versatile pro-
gram.

Kappa Kappa Gamma boasts three dreams girls:
Joanne Gray~PiKA dream girl. Ellen l\Iaguire~SAE
dream girl, and Lois Dunlap Phi Gam dream girl.
Abby Clark, president, Katie Gaskin, and Marnie Zu-
lauf held up the scholarship end as members of Mortar
Board.

Pinky Balquist, social chairman, kept Kappa’s
busy but happy with a full social schedule. KKG’s
played “Cowboys and Indians” at an opening fall house
dance. Betty Clark and papoose captured the prize for
the best costume.

Actives l\Iary Ellen Ntiller, Betty Goulrey and Betty Clark help the
pledges on K. P. duty.

Gamma Epsilon held their Founders’ Day Dinner
at VVebster Hall on October 13. Kappas journeyed to
Bucknell on October 30 to welcome their new Delta
Phi sisters into Kappa Kappa Gamma. Sigma Alpha
Epsilon and Kappa held a Christmas party for Pitts-
burgh Orphans. The winter aI1d spring formals were
highlights for the Kay girls. Kappas entertained at tea
dances with Psi Omegas, Phi Gams, Theta Chi’s, S.-\E’s
and Phi Eps. Kappas ﬁnished the school year with a
ﬂourish at the Spring Festival.

Kappa Kappa Gamma was organized at l\Ion—
mouth College, Monmouth, Illinois, as early  March
1870 by four young college women who aspired to have
a Greek letter fraternity “like the men’s” and believed
that they had founded the ﬁrst one for women. October
13, the date of the groups’ ﬁrst public appearance is
still observed as the anniversary of the founding of
Kappa Kappa Gamma.

Katie Gaskin studies diligently (it could be a novel) above the chatter
of Mary Lou Lois and June Siard.

The Phi l\lu housc—1nother, Nlrs. Hutchinson, is a patient model
while Lois Swaney and Charlotte Clauson show Betty Lou l\Iears
Jeanne Patterson a new hair style.

Phi Mu led another busy and eventful year, and
as our seniors sat through their last meeting, there
many things and people they knew they’d never forget.

Peggy Baird an(l “Boots” Robbins could always be
found howling over the latest joke as they knit 1 and
pearled 2, While Nancy Mechling repeated for the
fourth consecutive time, “Doesn’t anyone want to buy
a ticket to Pitt Players?” Vara Federoff and Jeanne
Patterson, our song chairmen, will make singers out of
us all in a short time if the piano holds out under their
constant thumping.

In a conference over their mentor groups were Lois
Hite, Jeanne Patterson, Charlotte Clawson, and Mary
Batz. Mary was also at the helm of the Y.VV.C.A. this
past year.

How could anyone ever froget Sally Clow’s, “Come
on, I want to start at 7:00” or our dilemma when it

294

came to the Cooper twins . . . which is Virginia and
which is Elizabeth? Peggy Evans could always be
found wondering about the features for the next issue
of the Pitt News while Betty Lou Cox l\Iears would
be writing a letter to her hubby in Med School.

There are some things which are deﬁnitely associ-
ated with some people: Virginia Fansler and her treas-
urer’s reports: Jean Rowley and her latest Phys. Ed.
problem; Lillian Pasqual’s hunting for pictures for the
scrapbook; Marion Ford’s. Now, does everyone know
l1ow to get to the dance’?’; and Elaine Caliquire’s

“Would you please repeat that for the minutes?”

Patty Berg and F10 Gustason held their weekly
private conferences: Gloria Sunderland faithfully at-
tended Panhel meetings. Yes, our Seniors do have a
lot of memories of Phi Mu.

Phi Sigma Sigma

With the falling of the leaves once more we happy
mortals tripped back to the old grind of school, sorority
and 4817 Centre Avenue; the happy abode of the Phi
Sigs. There is no telling what a Phi Sig is capable of
doing . . . for instance . . . Audrey Golomb is Vice Pres-
ident of the Senior Class. Shirley Bloom our archon
can be listed under the category of Senior Mentor.
Carol Nunes was chosen chairman of the Scholastic
Honors Committee. Tema Seidman is the Secretary of
the Class of ’51 and Geri Taper the W.S.G.A. repre-
sentative for the sophomore class; Roz Harris, co-
chairman of the Custom Committee; Rita Roth and
Miriam Cantor are on the Custom Committee; Bunny
Golomb, chairman of the Inter-class Sing for the Sopho-
more Class. Harriet Hertz and Miriam Cantor are on
the decoration committee for Heart Hop. Thus, may
be seen a bird’s eye view into the activities women of
Iota Chapter on campus. Anyone visiting 4817 would
ﬁnd activity at its height. We might ﬁnd Elaine Holz-

man pouring salt in tea for ﬂavor; Shirley Linden,
Barbara Finegold, Roz Margolis in search of a fourth
for bridge; Jackie Blitz and Sandy Shine practicing
their ever famous “Sonny Boy”. Of course, there are
those that spend the long hours knitting argyles . . .
Ruthie Selkovits and Norma Reuben. Not to be out-
done amidst this activity we ﬁnd Natalie Laufe, Fay
Goldstein, Thelma Kaminsky, Betty Mae Swartz, Flo
Korn and Ruby Feldman discussing current events.
Executives at this time are trying futilely to conduct
a meeting.

The pledges are polishing the new National Pro-
gress Cup which was awarded to Iota at the National
Convention and the cup for second place in the Pitt
Chest Variety Show.

So you see, here the foundation is laid for bigger
and better things that go to make Phi Sig a sorority
that tries to make the University of Pittsburgh proud
of them.

Things began hopping earlier than usual this year
for Kappa Chapter of Theta Phi Alpha with the na-
tional convention held here in town. Delegates from
Massachusetts to California were greatly impressed
with our Cathedral of Learning, especially the Nation-
ality Rooms.

We all oh'ed and ah’ed at Mary Jane Donohoe’s
half inch square diamond from Beta Jack Mellun. It
got to be the usual thing when Helen Tighe, Pat Corr
and Nina Peyton had their third ﬁnger bejeweled.

Pledging for Nancy Christian, Elena Bonaro, and
Gwen Wholey arrived in time to get our new house
in shape. House Manager Doris Bartko weilded a
mighty strong hand while Pledge Mother Peggy Finner-
an kept the underdogs in tow.

At meetings we all marveled at Rita Butler’s deft
manner in getting those bills out on the “ﬁrst”. Pres-

“llirror mirror r)n_‘theAwall” . . . .lGiven Wlioley and Justine Reagan

ident Dottie Higgins kept meeting miraculously calm
in spite of Peggy Furguson’s antics. Sylvia Steinbach,
Jeanne Kellar and Fran Mocker ﬁnally learned how to
knit argyles, while Pat Egan kept up with her fan mail.

In the Tuck Shop Rush Chairman Justine Regan
fiitted all around making luncheon dates with Anita
Knapp close on her heels. Mary Ann l\IcAleer was over-
joyed all year long that she could live her senior year
over again, thanks to Physics 5. Verny Wallisch, Jo
Maglaughlin and Mimi McCauley busy plotting things;
Jeanne Klingensmith telling everyone she wanted to
major in secondary ed, but in elementary when at last
looked older than the students; Pat Segar and Brenda
McCauley scribbling layouts for the Panther and dis-
cussing mentor and guild activities . . . all gave his-
torian Alice Barr much material to send in to national.

This and the Thanksgiving at the Gun Club plus

the Saphire Ball all spelled “Fun” and another year

Zeta Tau Alpha

This year marks the ﬁftieth anniversary of Zeta
Tau Alpha. It has also proven to be a very eventful
year. Margie Sopher, Sally Grotefend, Marg Harvey
and Nancy Brumbaugh attended the annual convention
at Virginia Beach and brought back many fascinating
tales. Eight of the nine founders were present and these
girls had the honor of meeting them.

New initates are Colleeen Denniston, Jeanne Ditz,
Rosemary Eckles, Sally Edgar, Audrey Evans, Carole
Frownfelter, Kay Holland, Mary Johnston, Dottie Kas-
putis, Marg Kohler, Shirley Pearson, Kay Thompson,
Ginny Vogel and Gerry Yanakas.

college days and that memories of Zeta will live always?
Memories such as: Sally Edgar, Audrey and Dorey
Evans’ “can-can” dance at Spring Festival Carnival;
Pattie Dickerson, who recently married a Navy Lieut.;
as “Queen of the Bowery”; Dottie Kasputis, who
proved herself to be “whistle—bait” in her brief costume
as sign-changer; the table-lamp in the upstairs hall, a
reminder of first prize taken because of the unique idea
of tequilla and tortilla at the tea dance; Spring Formal
at the Pines when Mae Flemin and Nancy Brumbaugh
announced their engagements and the chapter said
“goodbye” to Pattie Dickerson; the tea-da11ce for the
football players, along with the Thetas, after the In-
diana game; Sally Edgar and Audrey Evans’ “Baboon-
Twins” routine; Flo Eisenbeis’ “Pay your dues kids.”
Rita MacDonald and her original ideas for dances and
decoration and Dorey Evans’ ability and unselﬁsh
efforts to carry them out: yes, these are but a few of
the many memories of Z.T.A. life that will live always.

Alpha Kappa Alpha completed an active year in
which frivolity and friendship mingled with the more
serious aspects of education. Starting the school year
with a bang, Iota Chapter celebrated Home-Coming at
it’s traditional Autumn Nocturne. The Social Chair-
man really knows how to plan a good time! She hit
the jackpot again with the annual Skate and Dance
Party just before Thanksgiving. A party was given in
honor of Mary M. Page, one of the faithful sisters for
being named Alma Mater for the graduating class of
June 1948.

November brought rushing which kept Chairman
Myrna Parks busy. The pledges were really made to
step lively! Now they’re having fun being authorata-
tive Big Sisters. When Christmas Day rolled around,
the sorority tramped out to the Children’s Hospital
early in the morning for their yearly Caroling. It seems

they never sounded better in spite of sore throats and
colds.

February was a busy month, too. After relaxing
from exams at the Big an(l Little Sister’s Party, AKA’S
rolled up their sleeves and worked on their local project,
the annual shower for the Davis Home for Children. In
the spring they swung into their Health Week program
as part of the sorority’s National Health Project. After
we clebrated the closing of school with one ﬁnal burst
of frivolity Jeanne Davis signed the minutes for the
the last time. Prexy Jean Farrish, with her usual com-
posure and dignity, wound up all old business. Cli-
maxing the calendar for the year was a party given in
honor of the graduating sisters. That accounts for
Iota Chapter of Alpha Kappa Alpha until this time

Mu Chapter of Delta Sigma Theta Sorority has
had a year bustling wit.h activity. During the fall se-
mester outstanding events on the Delta slate were
rushing, during which a number of girls were pledged
. . . Pigskin punt after the Pitt-Indiana game at which
George Taliaferro and a few of his team mates stopped
in to say “hello” . . . the Turkey Strut in December
where guests danced to the music of Walt Harper-’s
band and the Pyramids, pledge group D.T.S., raffled
off a turkey for some lucky person’s holiday dinner . . .
the Christmas Party at which little sisters entertained
big sisters.

Then came January with pre-registration and ﬁnal
exams. Also in January George Washington Carver
Memorial Service at Heinz Chapel, which was originally
sponsored by Delta, was resumed after a year’s absence.
Registration was completed in February and Mu Chap-
ter sisters launched into the execution of their spring

program. Included in the spring semester activities
were: the Book Tea for the beneﬁt of Deltafs national
travelling library which supplies books to rural sections
of the South; the party for the Patroness Board of
Delta; the tea for mothers of undergraduate Mu Chap-
ter sisters; the “Jabberwock” which is put on by the
three Pittsburgh Chapters of Delta Sigma Theta each
spring for the replenishing of the sorority scholarship
fund.

Campus spring activities included Panhellenic Ball,
Spring Festival activities, Spring Rushing parties, inita-
tio11 of pledges. Mu Chapter’s own birthday celebration
in June ,and the summer picnic.

Delta Sigma Theta’s purpose of bringing together
college women of like ideals, and promoting social and
race betterment was fulﬁlled. All in all, Delta Sigma

The curtain was going up on a new year of fun and
activity for Delta Chi Rho. The first scene revealed us
celebrating Founder’s Day at the Roosevelt Hotel.
Tessie Sharove, our president, waltzed by with Danny.
The music stopped and they chatted with our other oili-
cers Rita Finkelstein, Mallie Rosenﬁeld, and Elaine
Levine. Rhoda Finn, star Pitt Player, presented a gala
program with the aid of our seniors . . . Mimi Kornitzer,
Ruth Perchesky, Norma Barker, and Phil Silver. Lee
Mussoff gave a dissertation on “How to be a Big Wheel”.
She ought to know for she is Chief Justice of Senior
Court and a member of Mortar Board.

We had a grand time and were still discussing the
affair at our Christmas Party. VVe ate candied apples
and spoke of the many events to some, including our
Father—Daughter banquet. We allowed for a philan-
thropic beneﬁt and planned a Playhouse night.

VVe were occupied with rushing and pledging and
didn’t realize how time had ﬂown. Socials and meetings
and months passed by rapidly. The spring months were
just around corner.

In the scenes to follow we are seated at our spring
dinner dance reminiscing about the fun we had at the
past aﬁairs. We made a pretty picture in our gowns of
pastels. Later we sat in a circle and sang sorority songs.
We hated to see the year go for our officers and seniors
would go with it.

Young and struggling, Delta Chi Rho continues on
with the hopes of a bright future, a future of which our
posterity may well be proud.

The curtain falls and so we say farewell to a won-
derful year of spirit and unity.

FMTERNITIES

Inte1°frate1°nity Council

Interfraternity (louncil. an integral unit at Pitt,
supported to the fullest, I'niversity and fraternity
policies tl1is year. Its participation in intra-mural
athletics. numerous social att'airs, and its list of frater-
nity men in activities at tl1e Yniversity proves conclu-
sively that Council has again gone over the top.

Amiable James J. Greany has been largely respon-
sible for the success of IF Council. Through his efforts.
and the efforts of all the other (louncil members. the
student body at Pitt had a taste of the finer things to
come. Starting‘ with tl1e IF Ball in April, fraternity

men have had the best in the way of a good time.

The list of fraternity men in activities and hon-
orary organizations is too long to list, but mention of
it is noteworthy. IF (l/ouncil’s record has been achieved
through cooperation and understanding‘.

Officers for the year were: James J. Greany. Pres-

Delta Tau Delta

Delts are ﬁnally in the alsolute post-war era as
fraternities go. A slightly smaller frat plus a younger
age set has taken over where it left off in 1941. Also
signiﬁcant of a new regime is the athletic prowess Delts
have established this year. Higher standings in all In-
ter-Fraternity trophy race events has given conﬁdence
to the chapter that new cups and trophys will accom-
pany the ol(l ones at the 4712 Bayard Street shelter.
Above all spirit has helped move the fraternity closer
together not only in athletics, but also scholastically
and socially.

The men at Gamma Sigma this year, as in the past,
met their obligations to the school. We followed the
team to VVestern Reserve and Victory, and we saw it
lose to Ohio State, but our faith held on for the even-
tual successful season. No matter what the event.
Delts supported it or acted to see it a successful ven-

ture. The Frat’s achievements in ’48 and ’49 came as
a response from a solid cooperating unit rather than
from any individuals.

Socially speaking within our unit, our calendar was
little less than terriﬁc. The Winter Formal at South
Hills spelled fame for the beautiful Queen of Delta we
crowned there. Trinity Church revelled under the
annual tri-chapter sing hosted by Brother Dean High
Moore of that church. Harmony between Delts from
Tech, W & J, and Pitt won acclaim from the many
friends and alumni assembled.

Yes, this year was great for Pitt and for Delta Tau
Delta who stood by ready to support the University’s
movement forward. Few of the present chapter will be
at the Alma Mater when the expansion is complete,
but those here now will have certain reason to say later,
that they gave their best. to the cause of Pitt.

Dr. Elmer Graper

Head of the Political Science department since 1930, Dr.
Elmer Graper first came to tl1e University to teach i11 1923.
Although he claims that he has no hobby, l)r. Graper admits
to enjoying the brief vacations he takes up in Vermont. Here
the Grapers have a summer home, an old colonial house built
in 1772 by Benjamin Carpenter, the first l.ieutenant—Governor
of Vermont.

Dr. James S. Taylor

“'hether mathematics or magic is his favorite science is
a question that Dr. James S. Taylor, head of the .\Iath depart-
ment, has never quite decided. Dr. Taylor, pictured here with
Blackstone the magician, is treasurer of the Pittsburgh Con-
clave of the Inter-national Brotherhood of llagicians. Inter-
ested in magic since high school days, Dr. Taylor once travel-
ed a vaudeville circuit and is a distant relative of the famous
P. Taylor Barnum.

Dr. Walter Read HoVe_v

.\ gardeii in .\lassacl1ussets, a sailing ship on Nantucket
Sound—these are the vacation pleasures of the Fine Arts de-
partment’s head man, Dr. “alter Read Hovey. During the
school year, ho\\‘e\'er. he finds his time pretty much taken up
by his duties as president of the Crat'tsman's Guild at the Arts
and Crafts Center and member of the board of the Pittsburgh
Playhouse. He still manages to ﬁnd time for travel, and on
these trips has built up an enviable collection of Chinese
ceramics.

 

Dr Putman Jones

As chairman of the English department, Dr. Putman
Jones has had less time to spend 011 his number one hobby,
short story writing. In addition to managing the department
since 194-7, l)r. Jones teaches the advanced course i11 Chaucer.
But even with this heavy burden of school duties, the soft
spoken English professor still finds a little time to indulge in
his second hobby, relating with a good book.

Delta Sigma Phi

The depression in 1934 spelled the doom for Delta
Sigma Phi that the war spelled to seven other Pitt fra-
ternities. But 1946 meant the recovery of Delta Sig.
Reestablished as Omega chapter of a fraternity had its
beginning at City College of New York in 1889, the local
chapter has struggled successfully to be a fraternity in
the post-war sense. But it has two inspirations to look
to, two occurrences indelible in the minds of the parti-
cipants. Initation was held for the first post-war Delta
Sigs at their Penn State house. The other “most un-
forgettable characteristic I’ve seen” was the handing
of the new charter by National President Stephen Ruan
to local president in the candlelight of the initiation
banquet hall.

The past year saw the Delta Sigs joining the frat-
ernity way of life at Pitt.

Under the leadership of President Purdy the Delta
Sigs gave a show that had Carnival visitors standing
in line outside the biggest tent on the midway. The

show was such an all around success that Delts Sigs
will go into show biz in a big way with each succeeding
Carnival.

The athletic teams directed by co-managers Hell-
mer and Papsch snapped out their slump and came
through with some hard fought victories. This was a
pleasant change for the warriors of the Green and VVhite.

Bill Sausser in addition to being the watchdog of
the treasury served as Social Chairman of Inter—Fra~
ternity Coucil. All the Greeks at Pitt including his
brother Delta Sigs say well done Bill, and thank you
for a grand social program.

Congratulations too, to Charley Yost who was
awarded a conveted gold P for his work on Pitt’s grid-
iron eleven.

These men have indeed learned the meaning of
true friendship and brotherhood.

Dr. Louis 1’. Gotlieb, Dr. Morris Lazersohn, Dr. Joseph
A. Lazarus, Dr. Harold Leve, and Dr. Abram Levy as
a local organization, it was changed to be national in
schope in 1915. In 1921 the fraternity was incorporated
under the laws of the state of Massachusetts.

Honorary membership is provided for men who are
deserving of some recognition by the fraternity te-
cause of interest they have taken in it or in one of its
chapters; and who in others ways would be eligible by
being unaffiliated with any other fraternity and by being
themselves college graduates.

A national endowment fund has been provided to
establish the national ﬁnances on a permanent basis;
and to help chapters purchase or build chapter homes.

Xi Chapter of Kappa Nu Fraternity returns after
having left the campus during the depression. VVith
the same spirit of fraternalism, good sportsmanship,
and high scholarship that brought fame to Kappa Nu
during the roaring ’°20s, the Chapter was reactivated by
a pilot class of fourteen pledges on November 13, 19-17.
During the next twelve months the Chapter was for-
mally initiated, accepted into Inter-fraternity Council,
and offered a fraternity home by its Graduate Club.
With much fraternity enthusiasm, the Chapter in-
creased its membership to forty-three actives and
pledges, unofficially attained the highest scholastic
standing on campus, and remodeled the fraternity
home which will be formally opened during 1949. Un-
der the guidance of its active Alumni the Chapter is
well on the road back to the position it held only a few
short years ago.

Lambda Chi Alpha

Omega Alpha Pi, a local fraternity at the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh, became the Gamma Epsilon
Zeta of Lambda Chi Alpha in 1919. The National
Fraternity was founded at Boston University, in No-
vember of 1909. Now in its thirty—ninth year, and num-
bering over one hundred and twenty chapters, Lambda
Chi is. one of the largest of the Grreek letter social fra-
ternities.

Growth characterized the year 1948 at Lambda
Chi Alpha. Rising rapidly from war-time inactivity,
after reactivation in December of 1946, the Cross and
Crescent men weathered well the growing pains of a
healthy fraternity and assumed a well earned position
on campus.

The biggest addition to Gamma Epsilon’s stock
was their acquisition of a house in May, not far from
the Cathedral.of Learning. After a summer of com-

330

plete remodeling and redecorating, the shelter became
the center of much social activity in time for the foot-
ball season. Bob Rossel, the chapter secretary, set
off the main room with a striking full-length mural of
the Lambda Chi coat of arms. Among the furnishing,
a full sized grand piano is the pride of all, and is often
surrounded by the ﬁve Heinz Chapel Choir regulars,
Elmer Metz, Bert Nevin, Bob Rossel, Ralph Rose and
Don Briggs.

VVhile the house occupied most of their time this
year, the Lambda Chi’s also ﬁelded dangerous teams in
all intramural sports and activities and maintained a
full social calender. One of the highlights of the year
was the formation of the Mother’s club.

Graduating this year is Sam Simpson, president
of the fraternity and Karl Newman and Al Capozzi.
These men have the satisfaction of knowing they serv-
ed well in a ﬁne fraternity during their college years.

Phi Delta Theta

December 26, 1948, marks the one hundreth anni-
versary of the founding of Phi Delta Theta. Since that
momentous day a century ago, at Miami University,
Oxford, Ohio, where six undergraduates organized Phi
Delta Theta, this great fraternity has grown into one
of the most powerful in the Greek world.

Today in a world full of changing ideas and radical
differences, there are not too many static elements
around. One of these may be found however in the
house at 255 N. Dithridge. Here the air of friendliness
and brotherhood that men will always search for and
appreciate abounds. This year, our Fraternity cele-
brated it’s ﬁrst century of existence. The centennial
convention, held at Miami University, Oxford, Ohio

was a gala week-long affair. Brothers Herrington and
Grigsby as delegate and alternate attended and returned
with many ﬁne tales for the ﬁrst meeting in September.
The 1948 school year commenced with its usual fervor
and every Phi Delt was a part of it. Much of this energy
was consumed in a house improvements campaign which
brought about a complete remodeling of the house. The
’48 year also found this energy a spirit being projected
elsewhere. On the football ﬁeld, Borther Fisher and
Pheiheia, Mike Boldin were part of one of Pitt’s best
football teams. Phi Delts may also be found in every
other part of the University. They range from College
freshmen to Seniors in Medical School. Culture, friend-
ship and sound learning are our principles—in the chap-
ter house and as parts of the rest of the world.

Phi Epsilon Pi

Phi Epsilon Pi, the second fraternity on Pitt’s
campus is one of the oldest Jewish national fraternal
organizations, having been founded at the City College
of New York in 1904. Here at Pitt, Phi Epsilon Pi has

next prize is the All-Point Trophy which will soon re-
pose on the mantle.

The big news at the Phi Ep house 150 N. Dithridge

were being installed when this picture was snapped.
The stove on the ﬂoor is the last word in modern ranges.
The play room which will be in the basement, combines

new feature to give Phi Epsilon Pi the most modern
house on campus.

Phi Gamma Delta

Brothers of Phi Gamma Delta, known the country
over as Fijis, believe that through intimate fraternity
life, the college man has an opportunity to develop his
ﬁnest qualities. It was with this view in mind that the
fraternity of Phi Gamma Delta was founded one hun-
dred years ago at what is now Washington and Jeffer-
son College. Today there exist seventy-four chapters
in thirty-two states and two Canadian Provinces all of
which were represented at the huge centennial celebra-
tion held last summer here in Pittsburgh.

Phi Gamma Delta started its year in a big way
with plans to make this year the best we’ve had at Pitt.
Through the efforts of our Board of Governors, these
plans became a reality. Our spirit led the fraternity
through a year that will long be remembered by those
brothers who graduated in June.

Our athletic calendar was followed with the full
support of every Fiji. The spirit of the boys ran wild
last year at the football, basketball, and softball games.
The vigor of the fraternity was again proved at the
Spring Festival when all the brothers worked harder
than ever to make Phi Gamma Delta stand out above
the others.

With the winter formal at Edgewood Country
Club, miriad house dances, and that ever important
Spring Formal, we still had time to work in a little
study. Parties and dances made the weekends some-
thing to look forward to and occasional tea dances in-
terrupted and brightened the long school week. At the
close of the year the Fiji’s all got together to celebrate
a successful year with a big picnic and party at North
Park.

Pi Lambda Phi

The big question this year for the Pi Lams was
whether to get their house or themselves plastered. The
boys at 225 North Dithridge chose the latter. They
really had something to show for their choice by early
December. The old chapter home emerged from a six
month face lifting as the ﬁrst thoroughly modern fra-
ternity house on campus.

Lots of the fun of the old days was gone. There
could be no more water battles with cascades ﬂowing
down the back stairways, and no more Violent de-dunk-
ing sessions in the second ﬂoor shower. But the Pi Lams
now had a showplace.

Gene Kline took office as president and somehow
found time to get engaged too. Pledge policy was etched
in letters of blood by Tito Braunstein, while Jim Cooper
cracked the whip over the unfortunate youngsters. VVith
no formal accounting behind him, engineer Howie

Hampton continued his unceasing wrestling bout with
the books.

John Schnapp, Mort Lerner and Bob Silberstein
juggled varsity track, basketball and tennis respectively
with heavy activity slates, While Bob Myers also hand-
led a difﬁcult double job involving Pitt News layout
and the house manager’s chores.

And, of course, there was the sentimental journey
which the pledge class arranged for Al Mundel.

Pi Lambda Phi was founded at Yale University by
a group of undergraduates of various faiths with the
chief purpose of eliminating what they considered un-
due prejudice and sectarianism in American colleges.
From that wholesome spirit of organization, Pi Lambda
Phi has grown from a fraternity made of men in nine
different colleges to the truly national Pi Lambda Phi
of today.

Sigma Alpha Epsilon

The first chapter of Sigma Alpha Epsilon was
founded .\Iarch 9, 1856, at the University of Alabama.
Despite adverse university feelings towards fraternities
and the demands of tlie Civil War. at this time, the fra-
ternity has since grown until today there are one hun-
dred nineteen chapters in forty-six states.

\Vith a star studded social calendar, a newly re-
modeled basement, and powerful athletic teams, Sigma
Alpha Epsilon completed one of its most successful sea-
sons. Highlights of the social calendar were the VVinter
Formal at the Churchhill Country Club, the Christmas
Party for the Orphans, co-sponsored by the Kappas,
and the Spring Formal. The soft lights and music of
the new downstairs provided real atmosphere for the
many informal dances and parties held during the year.
Here, also, meetings were called to order. :\Iany dis-

One of the oldest fraternities on campus is Psi
Chapter of the international Sigma Alpha Mu, found-
ed at the College of the City of New York on November
26, 1909, by eight men who joined themselves together
in a lasting bond of friendship.

The Sammies of Psi are especially proud of ob-
taining a house on campus and have spent the greater
part of the year redecorating the premises. The ﬁrst
purpose is to provide a home at Pitt for the fellows from
out of town. But the Sammies wish to extend the invi-
tation to the students of the University to feel free to
drop in and get acquainted. After all, Psi chapter be-
lieves that a fraternity is just one of the many functions
of the University of Pittsburgh and if in any small way
or manner they can help materially towards the future
of our school, it is deﬁnitely time well spent.

The prime purpose of the organization is to con-
tinue to grow and better itself so that it may aid the
University in its expansion plan. Alma l\Iater always
will come ﬁrst and it is the aim of Pitt chapter of SAM
that they play an active part in the growth of our
university. The big thing about a fraternity seems to
be that a group of individual fellows can act collectively.
All fraternities and organizations have that power and
SAM wishes to use it in the manner that will beneﬁt
the students and school most.

The chapter wishes to thank all those who have
made it possible to put SAM back on top after the war,
and appreciates the consideration and aid of the Uni-
versity and its students. Here’s to you and the many
happy years ahead in your companionship and friend-
ship.

The Stray Greek Club was founded at the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh in the fall of 1947. Its purpose is to
provide fraternity life and activities for transfer stu-
dents who are already members of Greek letter social
fraternities and do not have chapters on campus. We
feel justly proud that in the two short years of our ex-
istence, we have been recognized by our school and the
Inter-Fraternity Council. We are at present the only
organization of this type on any American College cam-
pus. Inasmuch as we hold the distinction of being the
ﬁrst such club on the records of the National Inter-
Fraternity Council, our official name has been desig-
nated as the Alpha Chapter of the Stray Greek Club of
the University of Pittsburgh.

In passing we must mention just a few of the names
of those men who have been of particular aid to our
club. Mr. Ned McIntosh of the Office of the Dean of
Men has helped the Stray Greeks become a full ﬂedged
fraternity. A real Stray Greek, one of our faculty ad-

University has been a constant source of encourage-

proved to be a real friend in time of need.

We have been active in every phase of campus life.
Our teams made their presence felt in the Inter-Fra-
ternity intramural program. Our individual athletes
include such men as Jim Musgove, Bob Walton. Bill
Kraybill, Bill Braxley, Art Gittins, Walt Uffelman, Jim
McCune, Paul Young, and many others.

Tom Ryan was our ﬁrst president and representa-
tive to Inter-Fraternity Council. Mike Kadar, our
second president was active in the Inter Fraternity
Council. Jim Musgove, our current president, is not
only a member of IF, but also the clubs most outstand-
ing athlete.

Our social activities have been many and varied.
This year our ﬁrst Formal was a great success.

This is our first time in the “OVVL”. We are proud
of our past and hopeful for our future.

Way back in 1856, when little groups of earnest
young college men were banding together into mystic
brotherhoods that were later to form the foundations of
the Greek-letter fraternity system of today, two young
men, Frederick Norton Freeman and Arthur Chase,
founded the Theta Chi Fraternity at Norwich Univer-
sity, in Vermont. Their ritual embraced all that was
ﬁne, manly, and upright in the inspiring code of the
military school of which they were a part.

Two years ago, six men of Alpha Beta Chapter in-
stigated the return of TL eta Chi to Pitt. VVithin that
time, Alpha Beta had obtained a house; it has surged
to full strength in membership; and it has taken its
rightful place as a challenger for leadership in campus
activities. Every one has watched with interest the
startling progress of Alpha Beta Chapter of Theta Chi
and the future undoubtedly holds many surprises for
those observing Theta Chi’s Alpha Beta Chapter.

This year has been another large step in the ladder
which has made Theta Chi one of the lea(ling frater-
nities on campus. Under the leadership of president
Homer Frazier there has been built up a fraternity
spirit and cooperation that can be envied by any fra-
ternity.

Under the direction of Dave Phillips Fall rushing
was a great success. The rushees were entertained by a
l\Ionte Carlo Night, a smoker, and OX-Ranch Dance,
and a dance to close out the week. Other social activi-
ties included a dance after the Notre Dame football
game, a hay-ride, tea dances, and picnics. At the tea
dances a band, made up of Theta Chi’s, were present.
to take the place of the usual juke-box.

It will be a long time until the graduated Brothers
will forget the house on Bayard Street.

Alpha Phi Alpha

Alpha Phi Alpha was founded at Cornell Univer-

fraternity in the United States established for negro
college men. The fraternity grew out of a Social Study
Club formed by seven students at Cornell and now
boasts of one hundred and eleven active chapters, one
of which is located in London. Omicron chapter was
forced to go inactive up to 1947 due to the war. Reac-
tivated, the fraternity now has forty active members.

During the past year Alpha Phi Alpha has been
putting all emphasis on its new Fraternity House at
3046 Centre Avenue. The Executive Tribunal, con-
sisting of President Wilbert Whitsett, Vice-prexy Bob
Hawkins, Secretary Bernie Sykes, Money Changers
Ralph and Clarence Brown, Dick Richards, Stan (Ru-
die) Lewis, Dozia Frazier and Laconia Knox, has been
talking seriously of a lavishly furnished ofﬁce.

Alpha Phi Delta

Everybody is excited about the prospect of an A.P.
D. frat house on the Pitt campus. Our hopes for a house
were raised a couple of times before and it ended up that
we were just disappointed; but now, the reawakening
of the Pittsburgh Alumni and a new policy of the Na-
tional Oﬁice make a solid foundation for our new hopes.
The outlook is so good that the upperclassmen, espe-
cially the Seniors, bewail the fact that they might not
be around to live in it; but, on the other hand, the
younger brothers are making plans already.

After this graduation, Ralph Liberati, the Prez,
will no longer be on the verge of apoplexy in seeing that
everything is in order and that everybody, especially
Larry, is doing his job. Clyde Tommelleo, “money-
bags” for short, will no longer hound us for dues. You
see, they’re both leaving us this year.

Floyd Greco and Larry Cresce will be only ofﬁcers
left. but they feel that they’re enough.

The new brothers, initiated Dec. 1948, are still
uneasy when Tony Latona, a transfer from Temple, is
around. It was his fiendish little mind that made life
miserable for them for a week or so. The night of the
initiation conﬁrmed the fact that] Tony Marsico can’t
sing and also that the brothers from the Tech and
Duquesne chapters, whom we invited, have enormous
appetites. The most popular guy that night was Joe
Frangona—he laughed heartily at everybody’s jokes,
even Bill Cavalcante’s (our little Bob Hope because of
his nose only.)

All in all, we all feel that the year was a good one.
A lot was done and a lot wasn’t ,but things are moving
We hate to see the graduating brothers go, we still need
them as actives but we know that as Alumni brothers
they will still be pitching for Alpha Phi Delta at Pitt.

Phi Kappa

Twenty—siX years have passed since a group of
eighteen men established Mu Chapter of Phi Kappa
Fraternity on the Pitt campus. During these years the
chapter has taken an active and leading part in all
campus activities. Wveathering the years of depression
and war has given the chapter a solid background of
faithful alumni and friends.

The brothers of Phi Kappa, who spent their last
year at Pitt, graduated in the blaze of glory they de-
serve. These men are the last remnants of those who
made a memory and a dream come to life, when they
reactivated the chapter following the war. Tremendous
progress has been made since those lean days. Last year
the foundation was laid and Phi Kap took on new
life and meaning. A few of these accomplishments were,
a completely remodeled playroom, the interior of the
house was painted, a drive-way and a twenty eight car

group. Jack Feeney served as Chairman of the Demon-
stration Block.

A ﬂash back on our social calendar shows further pro-
gress. Numerous tea dances, bi-monthly house dances,
a spring and winter formal, and through the medium Of
two vigorous rushing periods we obtained the men that
will carry the Catholic banner of Phi Kappa for the
next four years.

Sigma Pi

About two years ago, when officials of the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh were considering additional na-
tional fraternities on the campus, they inquired if
Sigma Pi would like to re-establish Chi chapter. Sub-
sequently, With the help of our chapter at Penn State
and the many Sigma Pi alumni in Pittsburgh. agroup
of students were organized an initiated on March 7,
1948, to become the present Chi Chapter.

_ Sigma Pi was founded at Vincennes University,
Vincennes, Indiana, on February 26, 1897, under the
name of Tau Phi Delta, which was changed to Sigma
Pi ten years later. Next to the Miami Triad, it is the
oldest national fraternity originating west of the Ohio.
The purposes of the founders were “to organize the
most worthy activities. social, athletic and scholarly,
and to set a high standard of manliness and college
loyalty.” Scholarship has always been encouraged and

is supervised by a national committee, called the Clegg
trophy commission to the chapter maintaining the
highest competitive scholastic standing throughout the
year. The commission also awards a prize each year to
the pledge in each province who attains the highest
scholastic grade.

Sigma Pi is, and has been. a member of the Na-
tional Interfraternity Council. We have a considerable
alumni body to support and assist the interest and sup-
port of alumni.

Although only established last March, Sigma Pi is
represented in several campus activities. Sigma Pi’s
social acitvities consisted of alumni banquets, dances,
smokers, picnics, and other entertainments.

Sigma Pi has made an excellent start and in the
future will prove worthy of recognition.

Gamma Sigma chapter of PIKA can look on a suc-
cessful year. In spite of setbacks it found itself in the
enviable position of having a powerful inﬂuence on
campus and a bright outlook for the future.

It was this critical year that saw Pi Kappa Alpha’s
long house hunt ended, and we hope, their long house
keeping began. This was augmented by a successful
rushing campaign yielding many fine new members and
was climaxed by the rushing dance at Edgewood Coun-
try Club.

Many extra-curricular interests have called PiKA’s
to leading campus activities. Members of the Pitt band
and Pitt Players, chairman of Spring Festival, several
members of the varsity football squad, a member of
the swimming team, a Y.M.C.A. president, a member
of O.D.K., student congress members, officers of Ells-

354

worth Y cabinet, members of the debate team, cheer-
leaders, glee club members, Pitt singers, upper class
counselors and last but not least the Pitt Panther,
throughout the past year have worn the garnet and
gold.

Churchill Vally Country Club was the scene of the
winter formal held in January. During that same
month the pledges held their traditional “Hard Times”
dance for the active members. Indeed the PiKA’s were
socially busy bees throughout the past year, interested
by a succession of dances, hayrides, parties and stags.

Pi Kappa Alpha may not have been a pioneer frat-
ernity in the full sense of the word, but it was such in a
large measure, and is among the oldest of the national
fraternities. The past year has been a glorious one for
the fraterntiy based on friendship and socialbility.

With the discordant sounds of the band as it prepared for a night of syncopating

rhythms, the all-campus dances were heralded into another year.

Each year Student Congress, in addition to keep-
ing the wheels of the regular Pitt activities in smooth
working condition, sponsors a number of dances to
provide the school with a basic social program. The
dances, one of which this year was an afternoon non-
(late affair, were planned to provide a form of social
activity in which all University students could take
part. The afternoon tea dance gave those students
from out of town and those who worked at nights a
chance to enter into the Pitt social life. Working

through a social committee made up of a speciﬁed num-
ber of its members, Student Congress planned carefully
dances that would appeal to the varied tastes and in-
terests of the thousands of Pitt students. These dances
enabled students to meet their fellow classmen in an
atmosphere other than the usual classroom type of

acquaintance. Three evening dances were sponsored by
Student Congress this year. Each of these affairs was
managed by members of various classes: the freshmen
sponsored the Ice Ball, centered around the theme of a
“winter wonderland”; the sophomores started the sea-
son with their Ballot Bounce, very appropriately using
the national elections as their central idea for decora-
tions and bids; and the juniors as their annual Junior
Prom sponsored the Turkey Twirl, completely atmos-
pheric of Thanksgiving—even to the extent of giving a
turkey to the person with the winning door prize stub.
Although these were called class dances, they were open
to any student of the University, and so the purpose of
the Student Congress, to foster friendship among all
University students, was fulﬁlled.

Spring Festival Week

Spring Festival 1949 joined with Pittsburghs’ VVel—
come VVeeks that gave Pittites a week of fun unmatched
in recent years, and showed Pittsburgh a celebration it
will long remember. VVith most of the events held right
on campus, Spring Festival was the best attended o11e
since the war.

Starting off with a streamlined Tap Day on the
Cathedral lawn. the festivities moved on a theme of
“Pittsburgh Then and Now" through the Float Parade,
Tea Dance, Carnival, and l\Iain Ball.

The Phi Delts began by copping the Sweepstakes
held in Schenley Park, while the Theta Phi Alpha’s won
first prize in tlie Float Parade with their ‘Goddess of
Steel’ Float. In the Interfraternity track meet, Phi
Gamma Delta took ﬁrst honors.

For the ﬁrst time in many years, the Carnival was
held on the main campus, running Tuesday, Wednes-
day, and Thursday nights on the Belleﬁeld-Forbes cor-
ner of the Cathedral law11. Attendance at the Carnival
was pegged at 8879 people.

Some of the attractions that drew this record crowd
were the appearance of several King Features cartoon-
ists who dropped in to draw souvenir copies of their
own comic strip characters. The ‘Mr. Pitt’ contest, a
clue-guessing contest, gave lucky Larry Herlick, among

llowa rd D11 vies, chairman

Jim .\Iaddcn, business m:in:igcr

other things, a $50 savings bond, a night at the Car-
ousel, a 1949 Owl. and a year’s subscription to the
Panther.

\V'ednesday afternoon saw the ‘Three-Quarters Tea
Dance’ draw a large crowd to dance and see the booths
representing various stages in Pittsburgh’s history.
\Vedncsday was the first all-Pitt music festival. with
all the University choral and instrumental groups par-
ticipating.

Thursday was opening night for Pitt Players’
“Dark of the Mo()I1”. This Kentucky l\’I0untain fantasy
drew record crowds for its three-night showing, eliciting
praises from all who saw it, including Florence Fisher
Parry, drama commentator for The Pittsburgh Press.

The lVIain Ball at West View Park capped the Fes-
tival with dancing to Russ Morgan’s Orchestra. and the
awarding of the various prizes and honors won during
the weeks’ events.

Highlight of the evening was the crowning of the
l\Iiss ‘Panther,’ nominated by the stafl’ of the Pitt
Panther and elected by the students who attended the
Carnival. 3/Iayor David Lawrence crowned I\Iarilyn
Oakes as the first ‘popularity’ queen elected on campus
in some years.

Each year two senior girls are chosen by their classmates
to reign as Senior Queen and Alma Mater for one year. They
are selected for their character, personality, academic achieve-
ment, participation in extra—currieular activities and service to

the University.

Senior Queen is a symbol. The members of the senior
class not only honor her as a person, but also see in her, and
honor in her, their own personal attainments. To be nominated
for Senior Queen is in itself an honor of which any Pitt woman

can be proud.

Alma lVIater, second in esteem only to the Senior Queen,
serves as chief attendant in an English Coronation ceremony
under the Gothic arches of the Commons Room, where the

Senior Queen assumes the regalia of her office.

Proclaimed Pitt’s most outstanding senior man by a
board composed of faculty and fellow classmen is the Senior
Awardee. This award is given to the senior man who most
closely approaches standards set up by Omicron Delta Kappa:
Intelligent leadership, personal integrity, and intellectual

honesty.

Omicron Delta Kappa and the University honor the Senior
Awardee on Tap Day during Spring Festival week by inscrib-
ing his name on O.D.K. walk between Heinz Chapel and the

Cathedral of Learning.

Carnival . . . Float Parade . . . Tap Day

Spring Festival—climax of months of plannin '
weeks of preparation. and days and nights spent in con
structing booths and ﬂoats, collecting equipment, and
adding the last-minute touches that made Spring Fes-
tival 1949 a really extra-special one. ( mpus organiza-
tions had put 11 nths into the planning of ﬂoat themes,
' desliows, and concessions: fraternity and sorority
house backyards bloomed with crepe paper creations
that were soon transplanted to the campus to compete
for float honors and cash customers. By day the campus
rang with the sounds of hammers and saws: at night it
rocked to the hoar. ies of barkers and the laughter
of the crowds. l\Ia r Lawrence and Pa l’itt helped

witl1 the coveted honorary award. )Iontl1s of suspense
ended as Barbara Schropp and Lenore l\“[ussoff were an-
nounced as Senior Queen and Alma Mater. The Owl
Hall of Fame opened its doors to another group of
honored students, while the Dipping of the Spoon
marked the choice of Junior and Senior \Vorthies. (‘ain-
pus honoraries tapped new members as Tap Day came
to a close. Rounding‘ out the week, Pitt Players packed
Stephen Foster Hall with ‘Dark of the 310011.’ then
ended its suc( ‘ful season with awards to its leading

My heartiest congratulations to the young men and women graduates from the

University of Pittsburgh.

To go to school in America, where anyone who wants it can have a sound and

useful education, is indeed a priceless privilege.

And when school days are over, to work at a job of your own choice; to take
part in the activities of the community where you live; to choose your government
representatives, freely and without coercion, in the security of the voting booth; to
have maximum enjoyment of your rights and privileges so long as you do not
infringe on the rights and privileges of your neighbor; to worship God as you please;
to express your views without fear; to meet freely with your friends and neighbors
for the discussion of problems of mutual interest; to go where you want when you

want; those are some of the many privileges that go with being an American.

But we must never forget that with these privileges goes a responsibilityéthe
responsibility of keeping America free—and this is a challenge to every one of you.
It is only by keeping America free that we can safeguard the dignity of the individual

American and his privelege of living the way he wants to.

The future stretches before you. What you make of it is in your own hands.
If I were asked to summarize my advice in a few words, I would say, ”TI2inI< for
yourseIf—do not czbdicate your right to make your own decisions to some

self-seeking demagogues or power-hungry despots.”

My best wishes to you all.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENT

The staff members of the 1949 Owl have given much of their time to the yearbooks production.
They have stayed up till all hours of the night working for the book; they have cut classes for it;
they have given up social events for it; they belittle it, hate it, curse it, leave it; only to return to
it. It’s not printers ink in their blood, but the knowledge that there is something that they can do
better than anyone else, something that will not be complete if they are not there to do it. To
adequately express my appreciation to the people who have made this book possible is not easy, so
I will simply extend my sincerest gartitude to every member of this year’s editorial and business
staffs.

To these people I extend a particular “thank you”:

B03 FUHR, who sparked the sale of the book with a barrage of posters that took a great deal
of work; planned layouts; cut innumerable glossies; turned out paste ups en masse; all, with
an appropriate remark for each tedious job that made them seem less like work.

RENEE FRIEDMAN, a transfer student from Purdue University, who immediately became
orientated with the Owl staff; turned out snappy layouts that did not need revision: helped
with pasteups, introducing a new method; always ready to help whenever needed.

JAYNE BIBBY, who did the majority of the photography, sacriﬁcing time and sleep; who could
be depended upon to meet appointments; took the uninteresting assignments; did a lot of
necessary contacting of groups and people over and above her duty; came thru on last minute
assignments. To a good friend whose contribution to the book is immeasurable, I can only
say again, “thanks JAYNE.”

CLEM LARKIN, who helped plan the breakdown and makeup of the Division pages of the book;
photographed and printed the Division pages in that special way I liked; stayed late to help
with pasteups and proportioning of pictures and joined the Editor in a mid-night brew.

FLoRA DIEMERT, who turned out the VVomen’s Organization writeups in record time; did a
great deal of miscellaneous typing that had to be done in a limited time; whose smile and
willingness to work when she already had a lot to do kept me going through trying times.

SCOTTY AND SLA'rs GARDNER, who always had the welcome mat out at their home and cool re-
freshments ready for a tired Editor; SCOTTY who paraded about the stadium during football
games dressed in tux and Owl head, to publicize the “New ‘49 Owl”: to both of you I say
“thanks.”

LARUE Moss, JEAN MOSTOLLER, VVALTER THOMPSON, who helped me inadvertently to pro-
duce this year book. To LARUE, who introduced me to the Owl; to Jean, who fostered my
love for the book and the work, whom I shall never forget; to VVALT, who tried to warn me
of what I was getting into when I went out for the Editorship; at the time, little did Iknow
what the job entailed, but now, well pleased with my decision, I extend my sincere gratitude
to all of you for your friendship.

NIR. PAUL LOHMEYER, Advisor to Publications: MR. THOMAS JARRET, University Photogra-
pher; MR. PAUL MILLER of Ashby Incorp.; MR. RAPH BENZ of the S. K. Smith Company:
MR. RoLLINs HADDOCK of John and Ollier; the Photographers of Gold-Tone Studios; whose
interest and help made ‘this book possible; words can not express my thanks.

l\IARK KARAGEORGE, my father, whose patience with me was incomparable; who worried con-
stantly about the late hours and irregular meal times I kept, and my many auto trips to Erie
to see the printer; to say thank you seems but small in view of your faith in me, that there

would be a 1949 Owl.
Sincerely —
THE EDITOR

The Broken 0ar

Once upon Iceland’s solitary strand
A poet wandered with his book and pen,
Seeking sone ﬁnal word, some sweet Amen,

VVherewith to close the volume in his hand.

The billows rolled and plunged upon the sand,
The circling sea-gulls swept beyond his ken,
And from the parting cloud-rack now and then

Flashed the red sunset over sea and land

' ‘Then by the billows at his feet was tossed

A broken oar; and carved thereon he read:

“Oft was I weary, when I toiled at thee;”

And like a man, who ﬁndeth what was lost,
He wrote the words, then lifted up his head,

And ﬂung his useless pen into the sea.

The School of

Business Administration

The I:ni\'ersity's accountants. economists and sta-
ticians of tomorrow are fortunate in having Dean
Vincent Lanfear as head of the School of Business
Administration. Dean Lanfear is never too busy to
listen to the young men and women he guides, talk
over their problems or have a friendly chat.

The students in this school of the University follow
a course designed to arm them with the minimum re-
quirements necessary for success in the fast moving
business world. The course of study is closely prescribed
during the ﬁrst two and a half years. It is during this
time that the general background is imparted to the
student. It is during the latter part of the junior and
senior year that the students of ‘bus ad’ specialize.
During this time, the aspiring accountants spend much
of their time using the calculating machines in offices
adjacent to the departments headquarters. l\Iany stu-
dents turn to the college to ﬁll-in the rest of their edu-
cation; the advertising student enrolling in courses of
display art, design and copy writing, for example.

Standards of scholarship, and performance are high
in the business school. It is only after meeting these
requirements that degrees are bestowed upon the men
and women who have spent four years readying them-
selves for paricipation in the business world.

The College

Oldest of all the University schools, the College
this year garduates a record number of students. The
Class of ’49 College graduate looks back on four years
thickly populated with the newly returned veteran.
Headed by Dean Stanton C. Crawford, the College
trains its students in the basic arts and sciences. Here
the prospective graduate is guided through a course of
study built about a core curricula of eighteen credits
in each of three speciﬁed ﬁelds: arts, social science, and
physical science.

The course of study in this branch of the Univer-
sity is a largely diversiﬁed one, for it prepares its stu-
dents for the professional schools, grounds them in
liberal arts, and equips them in the sciences. Here the
doctor, lawyer and social worker obtain their pre-pro-
fessional training. Prospective teachers also spend their
ﬁrst two years in the College before admittance into
the School of Education.

9 7 Dean Crawford advises College students with the

point of view that young people must be given
every opportunity for working out their own careers.
Two degrees are granted by the College, one in liberal
arts, the other in science. The graduate is well rounded
in the basic backgrounds so that he may easily ﬁt into
the complex pattern of life today.

The School
of Dentistry

There is more to this business of dentistry than the
occasional removal of an unhealthy molar. The School
of Dentistry has always had as its objectives the train-
ing of students in the diagnosis, treatment, and pre-
vention of oral diseases, disorders and deﬁciencies. The
school has also impressed upon the student his responsi-
bilities to his patients, his fellow practitioners and to
the members of the other health services.

Building from a ﬁrm base of the sciences, the stu-
dent is given thorough training in the most modern
techniques of scientiﬁc dentistry. For advanced stu-
dents who show special ability, there are positions avail-
able in outside clinics, asylums and penal institutions
to give these promising practitioners valuable experi-
ence in handling interesting a11d unusual cases. All
students are prepared to practice dentistry with due
regard for its social, economic, and ethical relationships.

There is adequate opportunity for practitioners to
pursue special courses. Graduate work is offered in the
ﬁelds of teaching and research, and for those students
who are interested in advanced degrees.

The University may be justly proud of its dental
school, nationally recognized as one of the ﬁnest in the
country.

The

All are architects of Fate,
Working in these walls of Time;
Some with massive deeds and great,

Some with ornaments of rhyme.

Nothing useless is, or low;
Each thing in its place is best;
And what seems but idle show
Strengthens and supports the rest.

For the structure that we raise,
Time is with materials ﬁlled;
Our to—days and yesterdays
Are the blocks with which we build.

Truly shape and fashion these;
Leave no yawning gaps between;
Think not, because no man sees,

Such things will remain unseen.

Builders

In the elder days of Art,
Builders wrought with greatest care
Each minute and unseen part;

For the Gods see everywhere.

Let us do our work as well,
Both the unseen and the seen;
Make the house, where Gods may dwell,

Beautiful, entire, and clean.

Else our lives are incomplete,
Standing in these walls of Time,
Broken stairways, Where the feet

Stumble as they seek to climb.

Build to—day, then, strong and sure,
VVith a ﬁrm and ample base;
And ascending and secure

Shall to-morrow ﬁnd its place.

Thus alone can we attain
To those turrets, where the eye
Sees the world as one vast plain,

Andyone boundless reach of sky.

~—Hem'y Wadsworth Longfellow

Dean S. P. Franklin

The School
of Education

86

Teachers in this era of specialization must be
equipped to meet the needs of rising generations. This
means more than facts; it calls for instruction in the
psychology, methods and techniques of teaching. Teach-
ers of today must know how to cope with clashing per-
sonalities as well as mischeviousness.

Education has progressed from the unattractive
one-room schoolhouse to the modern school building.
It is the job of Dr. Samuel P. Franklin, Dean of the
School of Education to make certain that the education
of teachers keeps pace with the growth of our school
system.

Dean Franklin has been a member of the Univer-
sity administration since 1943 and at present represents
the University as a member of the National Education
Conference.

Curriculum for the education student includes two
years in the College followed by two years of specialized
courses in the School of Education.

However, scholarship, capability, and personality
are prerequisites for admittance. One of the ﬁnal tests
of these students is a semester of “practice teaching”
during which time actual teaching experience is gained.
Lessons are planned, taught, and tests given by these
student teachers. This gives a well-rounded background
to our future teachers.
