Dorm Life
We good, the bod, “(Vie Ulgﬂg

Because of the immense size of
the freshmen class, overcrowding in
residence halls became a Way of life.

Freshman enrollment this year is
around 2,475, up from the 2,137 fresh-
men last year.

Originally students chose to live
with one roommate, but because of the
overcrowding problem, students were
forced to live with up to five other room-
mates.

Some students were even forced
into the lobbies of many of their resi-
dence halls.

Dorm living has many positive
aspects including security, utilities,
and laundry but there are many things
that may cause someone to decide to
live off campus.

Early in the year, Tower B was
evacuated several times due to unex-
pected fire alarms. Also, there was a
water main break which caused many
students to find an alternative place to
live for the night.

Most everyone has to do their time
in the dorms Whether the time is good,
bad, or ugly.

What a Long Strange Week...
Glteele Cl/\/eele Events

 
 

Greek Week is a Week of fun and games for the Greek community. There
are many events scheduled including Dance Marathon,Greek god and goddess.
and the blood drive. The events are to promote unity among the Greek commu-
nity while also raising money for charity.

Dance Marathon was an event that lasted 18 hours consecutively. Greeks
danced from dusk till dawn trying to raise money for a universal cause.

Greek god and goddess was an event where one brother or sister from each
fraternity and sorority go on stage to perform a talent of their choice. Some
sang, others danced, but all done for a good cause.

A student gets ready to give blood at the annual blood drive. The Blood Drive is one of
the most giving events. All houses donate blood to the blood drive which is held all weel
with different days assigned to different houses. For some students it is a first experi-
ence but for others it is an annual event. For those who go, it is an experience that bené
fits those in need.

It was a brighter day at the University when the newly renovated Bellefield Hall
opened. The new facility offers a new gymnasium, weightroom, and shower facilities.

Bellefield gym located on 315 Bellefield Avenue opened early in the year pro-
viding new classes for students. Aerobic Medley was one of the courses offered there 1
which picked up attendance for the physical education department. Students did
not have to walk to Trees Hall, which was often time consuming.

Freshman Corrine Rushkowski said, “I loved the idea that there was a gym clos-
er to where I live. I never would have taken the class had it been in Trees. It was a
great class that I would have missed out on.”

Bellefield Hall is available to be used by any student with a valid Pitt ID.

Spring Break Alternatives
/1 Oltiﬂﬂg vocation

Many think of spring break as a time for rest and relaxation in the sun,
but many found fun in the cold.

The Ski Club sponsored a trip to Smugglers’ Notch, Vermont Where stu-
dents could take advantage of the colder weather and enjoy a Week of skiing
from March 1-6.

The trip is an annual event for the Ski Club. If students don’t enjoy the
Warm weather there is always a colder alternative through trips such as these
for Spring Break.

The trip Was fun for those who attended. Freshman Fred Horanic said, “I
had such a great time on the trip, I am definitely going to go again next year.
I met a lot of great people and had a good time on Spring Break without a

beach.”

Many underclassmen students were accustomed to the every day cafeteria
style dining until Chick—fil—A and Starbucks coffee came into the Cathedral’s base
ment.

The meals were offered under student’s meal plans. Dining dollars were able
to be used which proved convenient for many students who do not cany cash.

Meal plans are also able to be used in Eddie’s, C—side cafeteria, and Schenley
Cafe. These three are the most popular places to eat because their hours are most
convenient for students.

   

Above left: A Starbucks worker prepares a double mocha for a students anxiously await—

This year was an exciting yet
hectic year for those in the

large number of incoming
Freshmen, extra work was
demanded of the little office

had not seen so many visitors
to the Pitt campus in several
years. They provided informal
tours to the prospective stu-

Although an added Workload

By Brian Knavish

The football team emerged
from the depths of the toilet
bowl in 1996, to a major New
Year’s Eve bowl in 1997. For
the first time in years, Pitt
football was fun.

Under the direction of new
Head Coach Walt Harris, the
Panthers embarked on one of
the most dramatic one year
turnarounds in sports history.

It all climaxed in the regu-
lar season ending with the
Backyard Brawl at West
Virginia. The Panthers’ win in
the triple-overtime thriller sent
Pitt to Memphis, marking the
team’s first post-season trip in
almost a decade.

It’s hard to believe that just
a few months earlier, expecta-
tions were dirt-low heading
into the season. The team had
minimal talent and most fans

  

prepared for another nauseat-
ing year of football.

But Harris tapped the talent
and forged a winning attitude,
and to the surprise of many,
Pitt opened the season with a
45- 1 3 slaughtering of
Southwestern Louisiana. But
most remained unimpressed
because the Ragin’ Cajuns are
a weak team.

It was actually a loss in the
next game that started people
believing. Pitt fell 34-17 at
Penn State, but the 34 point
underdogs played right with
the number one ranked
Nittany Lions.

A last second interception
by Chiffon Allen sealed a 35-
24 victory in the season’s third
game at Houston, but it was
the next game that turned the
season around.
It was

Thursday night, and the game

ly ranked Miami. The
Panther’s spine—tingling 2 1 - 17
win sparked a mad rush of
fans onto the field as they
uprooted the goal post and
paraded it around Pitt
Stadium.

The Panther’s found them-
selves on the other end of an
upset in their next game, los-
ing a 17-13 shocker at
Temple. Pitt stumbled again
the following week, losing to
Notre Dame 45-21 and drag-
ging their record to 3-3.

Pitt got back on the winning
track the next week in a 55-48
shootout at Rutgers.
Unfortunately they followed
that up with a one point loss
at Boston College.

That left the Panthers in the
difficult situation of having to
win two of the final three
games against the top three
teams in the Big East to qual-
ify for the post season.

But Pitt responded, beating
nationally ranked Virginia
Tech 30-23 to keep their bowl
hopes alive. But when Pitt fell
just short against Syracuse.
most expected that to be the
nail in the coffin of the season.

The Panthers had a differ-
ent idea. Pete Gonzalez’s
touchdown pass to Terry
Murphy in the third overtime
at WVU turned around Pitt's
program forever by sending
the team into the post season-

The team did suffer a 41-7
loss in the Liberty Bowl, but

expected.

The list of heroes who contributed to
the miracle season is endless.

The team rallied around Gonzalez’s”
charismatic personality as his rocket
right arm threw a school record 30
touchdowns.

His favorite targets were Jake Hoffartpyp y
who also set a school record with his 64 it
catches, and Murphy who grabbed 13
touchdowns.

On the ground, Dwayne Schulters and
Billy West combined for 1291 yards
rushing behind the mammoth offensive
line lead by all conference tackle Tony
Orlandini.

On the defensive side of the ball, Phil
Clarke, John Jenkins, Frank Moore, and
Ernest Coakley are just a handful of the
names that made headlines weekly.

The men’s soccer team
finished the 1997 campaign
with an overall record of 10-
5-4 and a Big East mark of 3-
5-3.

The team started its
season with a 0-0 tie at home
against Notre Dame in late
August. The Panthers went
on to continue and tie at a
tournament in Oneota, New
York, before opening their
Big East schedule.
Pittsburgh beat West Virginia
and Providence before tying
Boston College and losing to
Rutgers. The Panthers then
played to another tie with
Villanova and beat cross—
town rival Robert Morris.

The Panthers beat Big
East foe Syracuse and also
beat Saint Francis in the
middle of their season before
losing 2-1 in overtime
against Georgetown.
Pittsburgh suffered three
losses in a row to
Connecticut, Seton Hall and
St. John's which just about
sealed their fate for the year.
The Panthers missed the Big
East Tournament and ended
their season with a 7-0 win
over California University of
Pennsylvania.

Pittsburgh outscored
its opponents 42-25 this sea-
son registering 219 shots.
Eighteen of those goals came
in Big East play, while Big
East opponents scored 20
against the Panthers.

Phil Matilla led the

104 Sports

   

   

team in goals and points with
12 and 26 respectively.
Reagan Bender finished the
season with six goals and 14
points. Bender led the team
with three game-winning-
goals.

Chris Hanlon minded
the nets most of the year for
Pittsburgh. He started 18 of
the Panther’s 19 games. He
finished with a mark of 9-5-4
and seven shutouts. Hanlon
had a Goals—Against—Average
of 1.26 overall and 1.59 in
the Big East.

Hanlon had a rough
road to the starters job as he
sat out most of the last
two seasons either with an

injury or waiting for his
chance to start. He made the
most of that chance this year
as he was the backbone of
this team defensively.

Hanlon’s
Jared Cochran, played in
three games and started one
and had a record of 1-0-0.
He made eight saves and
gave up one goal making
his GAA 0.71.

The Panthers played in
the very competitive Big East
Conference which reﬂects in
their poor conference record.
This young team hopes that
next year will bring added
success for them overall and
in the Big East.

The women’s soccer team came into the
1998 campaign with a great deal to prove.
They entered the Big East for the first season
and were only in their second season of com-
petition. The Lady Panthers posted a 3-16
mark during their innaugural season.

This year saw freshman goalie, Nicole
Bashor, become a huge factor in the success
of the team. She finished the year with five
shutouts and a goal-against—aVerage of 1.98.

Bashor played in 14 games for
Pittsburgh stopping 105 shots. Bashor along
with fellow freshman Renee Spampinato,
Charity McClure and Charity Kriley led the
team.

McClure sealed up the points lead for
the team during the last weekend of the sea-
son. She finished with two goals and two
assists in her first year.

Kriley led all defensemen in scoring S ' t
with a goal and an assist. She also led the     O

team with 30 shots. Spampinato led the team on
field with her fiery play and team attitude.

Pittsburgh faced a lot of adversity this year.
At the beginning of the season, they lost last

‘year’s leading scorer, Aidemia Mora to a knee
injury. The team is also very young, having no
upper classmen and has had trouble dealing with
the experience of the Big East.

Notre Dame finished second in the nation
last year and dominated the Big East much of this
season.

The Lady Panthers registered wins against
Youngstown State and SUNY Buffalo last season.

The Penguins forfeited their game with
Pittsburgh early in the season. This gave the Lady
Panthers their first win of the year.

Just a few weeks later, Pittsburgh went to
Buffalo and the game was tied 0-0 at the end of
regulation play. The Lady Panthers took the lead
just 11 minutes into the first overtime on a goal
by sophomore Megan Beasley.

The Lady Panthers had a tough year offen-
sively and look to change that for next season.
They can build on the strong performance of their
defense and goaltending to lead them into their
second Big East campaign.

Second year head coach Roland Sturk has
been very patient with his team and has done a
good job recruiting, so that he can look forward to
the continual improvement of his team.

While Pittsburgh Panther
sports as a whole had a pretty
good 1997-98 on the field, on
the court, and on the mat, it
was in the water where we
truly excelled.

The men’s swimming
team captured its 13th Big
East Championship. The
championship season did not
start off in a championship
manner as the team dropped
two of its first three meets
including close, hard fought
losses to Syracuse and the

University of Virginia.

But the team bounced
back and slaughtered most of
its competition the rest of the
season. Some of the team’s
more one-sided victories
included a 145-84 romp over
Villanova, a 162-79 domina-
tion of Connecticut, and a
139-110 handling of cross-
town rival Duquesne.

The team also ran away
with first place at the West
Virginia/UMBC tournament in
February.

This year also marked

1 12 Sports

the fourth year in which Head
Coach Chuck Knoles won the
Outstanding Men’s Swim
Coach Award.

Men’s swimming contin-
ues to be a staple of outstand-
ing athletic achievement at
Pitt. The 13 Big East
Championships is an astound-
ing number for such a compet-
itive conference.

“This was a very reward-
ing win for us, and we are glad
to win the championship in
Pittsburgh,” Knoles said after
his team captured the confer-
ence title at their own home in
Trees Pool this year. “There is
no easy win in this conference
and every year from now on,
Miami and Syracuse will be
breathing down our neck.”

Senior captain Jon
Haggerty had the most impres-
sive performance at the Big
East Championships with his

two titles in the 100 meter and ;

200 meter butterﬂy. Haggerty
had team bests in those two
events during the season with
a time of 48.36 seconds in the
100 meter and 1:59.69 in the
200 meter.

Other outstanding swim- 
mers include senior captain»
and sopho- 
mores Adam Love and Jerry 
Koller who excel at freestyle 
set team 
bests in both the 100 and 200 
meter freestyle events (44.69

and 1:37.84 respectively.)

The backstroke is Where
sophomore Brian Elko excels,
turning in a team best time of
49.87 in the 100 meter back-
stroke, and the breast stroke is
freshman Devin Meece’s forte.
Meece had team best times in
both the 100 and 200 meter
breaststroke races.

Off the diving board, it was
George Anderson who lead the
charge. This senior captain led
the team in every single diving
event.

With so many young stars,
the Pittsburgh swimming and div-
ing dynasty appears far from fin-
ished.

VVhile the success and failures of other
Pitt sports get all the headlines, the wrestling
team has quietly built itself into the school’s
most consistent winner. The team has fin-
ished among the nation’s top 30 in 13 of the
past 15 years.

The 1998 season was no different for
the Panthers. The team cruised to a 20th
place finish in the NCAA championships and
boasts three All—Americans.

G r a d u a t i n g
seniors John
Withrow and
Mark Bodo
became just the
sixth and sev-
enth grapplers in
the history of Pitt
to land All-
American honors
three times.

W i t h r o W
finished third in
the nation at the
177 pound
weight class, the
highest finish of
any Pitt wrestler ‘
since Pat
Santoro won the
N a t i o n a 1
Championship
in 1989. He was
also named an
academic All-
American for the
second time this
year.

“It’s an
honor to have
my name men-
tioned with the
other three-time
A1l—Americans,”
Withrow said.
“Pitt has a lot of tradition, and it’s nice to
know you’ll be a part of that tradition.”

Bodo, the other three timer, will also
be missed. His quiet leadership and no—non—
sense attitude has inspired his teammates
for four years.

The story of Nick Mengerink, Pitt’s
other 1998 All-American, is different than

1 14 Sports

John Withrow

 

that of grizzled veterans Withrow and Bodo.
Mengerink brought home the honor as a
freshman, something only one other Pitt
grappler has done.

Mengerink led the team in wins with a
34-4 record and also was named the Eastern
Wrestling League Freshman of the Year.

During one of his matches at the NCAA
tournament, Mengerink suffered a grewsome
bicep tear. But he did not tell anyone of the
injury until after the tournament; he wres-
tled with the excru-
ciating injury until
he secured his spot
as an All-American.
“He’s got that burn-
ing desire, you can
see it,” Head Coach
* Rande Stottlemyer
said. “He really
wants to be national
champion and he’s
willing to pay his
dues to get there.”

Pitt’s lineup is
\ chalk full of stand-
out grapplers such
as Rob Loper, prob-
a b ly t h e b e s t
wrestler in the
j country to never win
 All-American hon-
 ors. The 126
pounder led the
team in wins two
seasons ago and
was second this sea-
son. But freak mis-
fortunes at NCAAs
have kept him one
win away from the
honor both years.
Chad Jesko and
Mike Ziska are also
among the nation’s
best and will be
counted on to step
up to help fill the Voids left by the gradua-
tions of Withrow and Bodo.

The team is also loaded with young
prospects such as Shawn Amistade and Matt
Mueller who have unlimited potential and
should develop into All-American caliber
grapplers.

The men’s basketball
team had a very up—and—
down year, with high expec-
tations, low finishes and a
lot of injuries.

The Panthers started
the season with three
straight exhibition wins, but
then followed with a loss to
Illinois State. This was the
first sign things were not
going to go well.

Pittsburgh lost two
close games to St.
Bonaventure and Notre
Dame at home and all hope
seemed to be lost, but they

 

 

rattled off three straight
wins.

Then, the team lost to
Miami, but beat Notre Dame
on the road. After this
stretch, the Panthers lost
nine of their next 11 games
putting them near the bot-
tom of the Big East.

Pittsburgh won three
of its last five games, but
lost to Villanova by three at
the Big East Tournament in
New York. This game was a
very close contest, but the
Panthers could not make the
big shot at the end.

Pitt suffered through a

The biggest surprise
for Pittsburgh was freshman,
Ricardo Greer. Greer shot 43.

helped the Panthers a grea \
deal to fill in for Taylor.

It wasn’t just winds of
change that swept through the
Pittsburgh Women’s
Basketball Program in 1997 —
98, it was an all-out hurricane
of change. The old coach is in
the front office, a new coach is
at the reigns, and a brand
spankin’ new convocation cen-
ter is in the works.

The plan is that all of
these changes will give the
struggling program the jolt it
needs to transform it into a
national powerhouse.

After the team finished
the season a dismal 6-21,
Athletic Director Steve
Pederson continued his
impressive reconstruction of
the athletic department by
bringing in Traci Waites to
coach the women’s basketball
team. Former Head Coach
Kirk Bruce was then promoted
to the front office where his
masterful administrative abili-
ties will better suit the pro—
gram as an assistant athletic
director.

‘‘I’m excited about the
commitment our school has
made, and more importantly,
the commitment our kids have
made,” Head Coach Traci
Waites said of the rebuilding
process. “We expect to com-
pete and to get out there and
try to make a name for our-
selves in the Big East.”

Waites has all the cre-
dentials to become a top ﬂight
coach. She comes to Pitt after
serving as an assistant coach
for the University of Arizona, a
perennial top 10 team.

Her impressive playing
career started at the
University of Georgia before
she transferred to Long Beach
State. Not only did her teams
make the NCAA tournament
in each of her four playing
years, but Waites is the only
player in history to play in the

1 18 Sports

   

 

 

Final Four for two different
teams.

Despite the team’s
struggles, several Panthers
put up some solid numbers
last season.

Alecia Balich led the
team in scoring with 229
points including a team lead-
ing 4O three—pointers. Nickeia
Morris, Gina Montesano, and
graduating senior Farrah
Woods followed Balich closely,
with 228, 227, and 226 points
respectively.

Morris was also a star
on defense, picking up a team
high 21 1 rebounds.

With only two graduat-
ing seniors, the team is excep-
tionally young. Balich,
Montesano, Morris and other
young players like Kenosha

Chastang, Monique Toney,
and Michelle Katkowski will be

counted on to step up and

lead the resurgence on the
court.

The other key element
in the rebuilding process is
recruiting which Waites said is
going excellent. Her plan is to
lure the best talent possible to
Pitt.

The Taj Mahal of the,

athletic department’s facelift,
the Convocation Center,
should help with recruiting
and boost basketball in gener-
al, but Waites is not waiting
for the building to jump—start
the program, she wants an
exciting, competitive team
ready to play in the center
when it opens.

The women’s tennis team had one of
the best years of any Pitt sport in 1997-1998.

The Panthers posted an eye-opening 12-4
record in the regular season before stumbling
in their 1 lth place finish at the Big East tour-
nament.

“I thought the season went pretty well.
We played a lot of good teams; we played West
Virginia pretty tough” talented freshman
Lindsay Carlson said. “Our coach [George
Dieffenbach] said that two years ago we
wouldn’t have even stood a chance against a
team like Providence, and this year we played
right with them.”

The team had a ﬂawless fall season
turning in wins over Robert Moms, Clarion
and Indiana University of Pennsylvania.

When they took to the court again in
February, the team picked up right where
they left off with a 9-0 win over Mercyhurst.

That was followed by Pitt’s first loss of the
year, a 9-0 romping at the hands of Marshall.
But the resilient team bounced right back
with wins in its next two matches.

The schedule got a little tougher and
the team played
some of its best ten-
nis of the year in
this span, despite
the team dropping
three of its next five.
Two of the losses
were closely contest-
ed matches against
tough Big East foes
West Virginia and
Providence with an
impressive confer-
ence win over
Villanova thrown
into the mix.

Pitt then
cruised through the
remainder of the
regular season with
four straight wins
including victories
over crosstown
rivals, Duquesne

and Carnegie—Mellon.
But they could not

fran Davis

find that winning groove in the Big East
championships, finishing 1 1th in the 13 team
tournament.

Seniors Fran Davis and Amanda
Hoffman led the team to its successful year
on the court. Davis put together an 18-11
singles record and a 21-7 mark in doubles
action for a team leading combined wins total
of 29.

Hoffman posted similar numbers in her
17-15 mark in singles competition and her
17-8 record in doubles.

Other standout performers for Pitt
included junior Erin Shalbrack who recov-
ered from a knee injury to post 13-5 and 1 1-
4 marks, sophomore Alison Bucher (18—9, 17-
10) and the impressive freshman duo of
Carlson (17-15, 12-15) and Dana Jafarian
(15-16, 11-15).

The future of Pitt tennis looks bright as
the team will move their home courts out of
the Cost Center and into a brand new facility.

Thg new facility will be built where 

Pennsylvania Hall currently sits overlooking
Pitt Stadium.

The women's softball
team played in their innagur-
al season in the spring of
1998. The Lady Panthers did
not play in a conference
because they were a first
year program. The team only
had two home games
because they do not
have a home field.

When they did
play at home, the
women used Pitt
Stadium, but it was
converted into a soft-
ball field.

Home plate sat
at the far end of the
stadium from the
football entrance.
Playing here made it 
difficult as the play-
ers had to deal with
the slope of the field
and the slick turf.

The school has
plans in the works to
buy Mazeroski Field,
but that has not yet
taken place.

The women enter the
Big East Conference next
year with teams like Boston
College, Notre Dame and
Providence.

The competition will be
tough next year. The Lady
Panthers will play in the fall
and one month in the spring
before starting their confer-
ence schedule.

"This should afford us
some time to get used to each
other and create some team

122 Sports

chemistry," head Coach
Michelle Phalan said.

The Lady Panthers had
a rough season in every
sense of the word. They fin-
ished the season with a
record of 0—12—0. They went
0-2-0 at home, 0-9-0 on the

road and 0-1-0 at neutral
sites.

Jen Mannick was the
leading hitter for the Lady
Panthers, batting .333. She
also added three RBI. Laura
LeViere followed with a .250
average and Shannon Delker
had a .222 average with
three RBI.

The team batted a
meek .124 in their first sea-
son. They hope that a year of
experience will help to bring

R
this number up a bit.

The pitching staff did‘
not fare much better. LeViere
finished the season 0-6 with
a 5.91 ERA. Shelby Scrabis
ended the season 0-6 as well
with a 9.63 ERA. The staf
combined finished with a
7.56 ERA.

"We learned a lot about

  
   
   
 
 
   
         
 
  

recruited players coming
in for next year," Phalan
 said.

good team may only be a
few years away.

This year allows the
team more recruiting
time to go out and find
some players who will
make an immediate

impact on the club.

In terms of wins and losses, 1998 wasn’t
the most memorable year for the Pittsburgh
Panther Baseball team. But despite the trou-
bles on the field, the year saw the program take
huge steps forward. Under the guidance of new
coach Joe Jordano and with a new baseball
facility to be ready for 1999, the team appears
to have the pieces in place to compete with the
big boys in the Big East in the years to come.

“I was disappointed with the outcome of
the season,” Jordano explained of his team’s
12-27 - 1 overall record. “But we absolutely have
potential. We have an excellent recruiting class
and we have some talented players returning. I
think that combination will make us a very
solid team next year.”

The team started the season in style,
playing nine games in beautiful Homestead,
Florida during spring break. They brought
back just a 3-6 record from their trip to the
Sunshine State, but they followed that up by
winning three of their next five to keep their
hopes of a winning season within reach.

But unfortunately for Panther fans, the
team managed only six more wins in its final 20
games leaving the team hungry for more wins
and itching to get back out on the field.

Despite the disappointing record, several
Panthers did put up some eye-opening num-
bers in 1998.

Shortstop Lou Melucci started all 40
games and led the team with a .316 batting
average and five homeruns. Bill Brown tied
Dave Hoopes and Steve Dickinson for the team
lead in RBIs, each knocking in 25 runners.

Other stars include Harry Ciavarella—
who drove in 22 runs while providing strong
defense up the middle at second base—and
outfielder Jason Oliver who hit .288 with 21
RBIs.

On the mound, senior Bob Balazantis
sparkled. His 2.35 ERA and 53 strikeouts lead

the Panthers. .

The most encouraging thing about this
group of players is that all but three will return
for the 1999 campaign.

When the players finally do take the field
for fall practice, they’ll be playing on a newly
renovated Trees field. The old rocky infield will
be replaced by artificial turf and outdoor lights
will be erected so the team can practice later
and host night baseball games.

The Pittsburgh
women's gymnastics team
finished its season 6-5 and
2-1 in the EAGL with its
highest finish, a third place
in the CAT Classic.

Pittsburgh saw some
great things out of the gym-
nastics team and the team
brought the NCAA Regional
competition to Fitzgerald
Fieldhouse. The Lady
Panthers finished sixth in
this event as the host
school.

The team scored its
highest point total of the
year at the CAT Classic with
190.625 points. In a head-
to-head meet, the team
scored 193.55 points
against Ball State.

Danielle Alba tallied
the highest marks on the
balance beam for the season
with a 9.875 at Penn State.
She also holds the mark for
All-Around score with 38.95
points.

Calli Bodnar, Lisa
Fronhofer and Robyn Senior
share the mark for best
score on the Vault with 9.8
points each. Senior and
Fronhofer set their marks in
two different meets against
Ball State.

Senior also holds the
mark for Floor Exercises
with a score of 9.875. She
set this mark in February
during a meet with Rutgers.

The team set a school
record with a combined
score of 48.725 on the bal-
ance beam in one meet this
year.

Joy McElhinny set a
Personal Best, 9.55, this
season on the Floor
Exercises, and Pamela
Lieberman did the same
with a 9.725 on the Uneven
Bars.

The season started a
little rocky for the Panthers
with a loss to
West Virginia just after
Christmas Break.

They bounced back
with a win against Missouri
and Ursinus the next week.
This meet raised their record
to 2-1.

They followed these
two victories with two more
just a week later. The Lady
Panthers defeated James

Madison and Rutgers in a
meet at James Madison.
Pittsburgh went to the
CAT Classic the next week
and fell on some hard times
with one win and two losses.
They followed this with a
win against Rutgers and a
loss at Kent State.
Pittsburgh then beat
Ohio State and went on to
finish its season with two
other meets and then the
NCAA Regional Competition.

The men’s and women’s track teams
completed a successful season at the NCAA
Championships at the State University of New
York at Buffalo.

The men had no participants beyond
the IC4A championships, but the women sent
two members to the NCAA meet with Trecia
Smith winning the triple jump and finishing
second in the long jump, the event in which
she holds the NCAA record set last year.

Chantee Earl, Pittsburgh’s other repre-
sentative at the NCAA meet, finished fourth in
the 800-meter final, which left the Panthers in
twelfth place overall.

Smith and Earl will both return next
year and Smith looks to be on track for the
2000 Olympics in Sydney.

Smith set the NCAA long jump record of
14.22 meters on May 25, 1997 at the
Championships.

With their performances both Smith
and Earl earned Al1—American honors.

The women finished fourth in the ECAC
meet the week before and the men came away
with twentieth place. Smith added to her
totals with a fourth place in the discus and
the shotput.

The women’s 4x800 relay team finished
first with a time of 8:40.81, setting a school
and meet record. The team of Tamika Dorin,
Earl, Lynda Andros and Anna Kohler did not
quite have the time to propel them to the
NCAA meet but did run their best race of the
year, said head coach Steve Lewis.

The men’s 4x400 relay team finished
fourth, while Se’kou Nelson Diday placed
sixth in the 400—meter race.

Senior Kohler shattered the Pittsburgh
record for the mile run. The record set in 1978
had not been challenged in recent years
because that event is no longer run in NCAA
meets.

Pitt knew it was a weak record and they
allowed Kohler to run the mile to set the new
record which now stands at 5:00.02.

J oetta Purter had a very strong showing
in this meet which propelled her into the
ECAC meet for 400—meter intermediate hur-
dles along with Ron Losiewicz in the discus
and Jeremy Ward in the 1 10—meter high hur-
dles and the 400—meter.

The women finished second in the Big
East just behind Miami while the men cap-
tured 10th. Smith was named Outstanding
Field Performer winning the long jump and
triple jump. She owns 1 1 Big East titles which
is just three behind present assistant Najuma
Fletcher for the Pittsburgh record.

Gina Bundy took the heptathalon and
Losiewicz finished second in the discus. Earl
took the 800—meters and the Lady Panthers
also won the 4x800 relay, but it was not
enough to catch the Hurricanes.

Losiewicz, James Neece and Diday all
earned All—Big East honors this year at the
meet.

CGS Student Government g

By Linda Messineo

The CGS Student Government is the
representative student government for all
students enrolled in the College of General
Studies. It is governed by a Council of five
CGS students elected annually by the stu-
dent body.

Non-traditional students enrolled in
the College of General Studies often take
longer to earn their degree, some times as
much as 12 or more years. Students have to
juggle many responsibilities in addition to
their classwork, such as family and career.
Many students attend their classes at night,
after a full day at work. Since these students
most often are not
able to spend
much of their
spare time on cam-
pus, it is critically
important that
they be represent-
ed and advocated
for by a body of
their peers, other 
students who 
understand their
unique needs and 
interests. W

The University of Pittsburgh has a
great tradition of Greek life on campus.
Many of the “secret letter societies” were
founded in the 1800’s and still exist today.
They were founded as a means to bond peo-
ple together in friendship during their for-
mative college years.

IFC and Panhel both govern Greek life
on campus and every fraternity and sorority
are represented. The IF C and Panhel work
together to determine policy, programs and
marketing strategies. They also work to coor-
dinate philanthropic and community service
efforts.

I_FQ

The InterFraternity Council (IFC) is
comprised of representatives of all 18 frater-
nities on campus. They exist to promote

Greek life, to create unity and to dictate pol-
icy and programs related to campus life.

This past year, the IF C saw much
progress in the area of recruitment, for they
rushed 20 percent more than in recent
years.
Panhel

The Panhellenic Association (Panhel)
celebrated a terrific year as they won the
award for Overall Sorority Excellence for the
entire northeast United States. Their award
was based on outstanding recruitment, pro-
grams, leadership and service. In addition to
this prestigious award, Lea Shafer, Panhel
President and member of Delta Zeta Sorority
was recognized as Northeast Panhellenic
Woman of the Year.

Greek Week is perhaps one of the most exhilarating and enjoyable parts of being

0 Greek. It offers the individual a chance to get together with 1900 other fraternity and
sorority members in a fun and competitive atmosphere.
The 1998 Greek Week activities raised over $80,000 for Children’s Hospital. In
addition, the Greeks also donated 1,700 pints of blood for the Central Blood Bank and

I hundreds of cans of food.

The goal of Greek Week is to combine philanthropy with fun. Such activities
‘ include a Greek God and Goddess Contest, Greek Sing, 5K run, chariot race, a Greek
 Formal and a dance marathon.

The purpose of all this is to raise money for less fortunate individuals, Who do not
 have some of the same opportunities that We Pitt students have. Greek Week is just
M another example of the many things that Greeks are involved in at the University of
‘ Pittsburgh.

Delta Pi was established at Wesleyan Female
College in Macon, Georgia on May 15, 1851. It is
said to be the first secret society for Women.

It has been a successful year for Alpha
Delta Pi in the sense that they have made them-
selves very competitive and more involved with
the Greek community.

In addition to the confidence that the
Women gained during rush, the chapter was very

Alpha Epsilon Phi, Nu Chapter, had an eventful
year filled with excitement, achievement and most
importantly, sisterhood. They started the year with a
bang when they made quota-plus during formal rush.
The Phi’s participated in Pitt Project, Homecoming and
successfully competed in Pi Kappa Phi’s annual War-
of-the Roses football tournament. In November,
Melissa Chordock was elected president of the
Panhellenic Association and Melissa Bartolini was
appointed Chief Justice of the Panhellenic Judicial
Board. Alpha Epsilon Phi was extremely pleased with
informal rush, for it was only their second time partici-
pating and their numbers tripled. Numerous sisters
were recognized campus-wide as they were inducted
into honor societies such as Rho Lambda and Omicron
Delta Kappa and appointed to Rush Board. Alpha
Epsilon Phi also ended the year with a bang when they
placed overall in Greek Week for the second consecu-
tive year.

Chi Omega was founded April 5, 1895. The
Phi Beta Chapter at Pitt was founded in
December, 1919 and has over 215,000 members
and 170 chapters. There are six purposes that
Chi Omega was founded upon. They are:
Friendship, High Standards of Personnel, Sincere
Learning and Creditable Scholarship,
Community Service, Participation in Campus
Activities and Career Development.

The Phi Beta Chapter enjoyed this past
year by becoming more active in chapter pro-
gramming. Together With the Women of Sigma
Alpha Epsilon, Chi Omega shared in the efforts of
a food drive/non—alcoholic mixer. The chapter
hosted a faculty tea this spring and had much
enthusiasm shown for the mocktail mix—off com-
petition for all new members. They prepared a
non—alcoholic chocolate drink that sent choco-
holics back for more! In addition, Chi Omega Won
the award for the “Best Tasting Non—Alcoholic
Beverage.”

The 1997-98 school year was one of many
celebrated achievements for Sigma Sigma Sigma.
The Beta Theta chapter began the year with an
incredible rush that placed them at optimum
membership, thus establishing them as the
largest sorority house at the University of
Pittsburgh. The competitive spirit that pervades
all Sigma’s showed when they won Sigma Chi’s
Derby Days in the fall.

As the new year began, Sigma Sigma
Sigma celebrated their 100th anniversary as a
national sorority. With all this excitement, it was
no surprise they came out to be winners of
Greek Week Cathedral Awards. Two other note-
worthy achievements was that Lisa Pfeifer was
named to be the New Member Educator of the
Year and Kyra Harmonous was appointed as one
of the Greek Week 1999 Overall Chairpersons.

With the Beta Theta chapter 50th anniver-
sary approaching next year, we can only imagine
what new accomplishments will be achieved.

65,000 brothers nationwide. The brothers of the
Phi Delta chapter here at Pitt are proud of their
Greek heritage and the traditions associated with
it. As one of the most involved groups on cam-

Being a chapter of the oldest con-
tinuous social fraternity in America has
given the brothers of Delta Phi high
standards to meet and exceed. After
Weathering a short period of turbulence
caused by recolonization in 1990, Delta
Phi has met those standards, emerging
as a strong and stable fraternity. The
current membership has grown to thir-
ty-five active brothers.

Under the leadership of President
Dean Monteleone, Delta Phi has an
increased presence in the Greek com-
munity. The men lead all fraternities in
scholarship by posting a 2.93 GPA.

The brothers at Delta Phi are
committed to helping and supporting
each other in any endeavor they under-
take; including social, academic and
fraternal. However, the primary value
they emphasize is friendship.

The creation of Delta Sigma Phi was found-
ed on the ideals of free—thinking men. It is a fra-
ternity based on diversity and friendship. The
Omega chapter at Pitt is entering it’s 81st year.

Not only do these brothers carry forth the
ideals of their founding fathers, but they are con-
tinually striving to push forward the boundaries of
the present day fraternal experience. Delta Sigma
Phi brothers are the innovators of new social
events, such as Pitt’s first Brother and Faculty
Wine and Cheese Open House. So, whether it’s
the Alumni Cocktail Party for a Steeler Tailgate,
the brothers of Delta Sigma Phi do it right.

Delta Sigma Phi has drafted and com-
menced a complete restoration plan of their house.
So Far, the presidential suite has been completely
rebuilt, as well as two bathrooms on the second

phase and all house windows are currently being

The 1997-98 school year turned out to
be quite an achievement for the members of
Sigma Alpha Epsilon. Sigma Alpha Epsilon had
more brothers in campus organizations than
any other fraternity. Thesepositions included
IFC, SGB, Greek Odyssey, the Pitt News,
WPTS and Panther football among others. We
also worked with charities such as the Western
Pennsylvania School for the Blind, Make-A-
Wish, Salvation Army, Genesis House, and the
Veteran’s Hospital. Our pledges alone raised
over $1000 for the Children’s Hospital Free
Care Fund. Finally, our house and the sisters of
Chi Omega joined forces to host the university’s
only non-alcoholic mixer during Alcohol

TKE is a fairly new fraternity, officially established in 1996 at the

to create a new fraternity that “selected its members on the basis of
personal Worth and character, rather than the artificial one of rank,
position or Wealth.”

Tekes are loyal to the University of Pittsburgh and place it as
their “first duty.” They demonstrate their loyalty and devotion
through their active participation in various eXtra—curricular activi-
ties.

“It is our aim to be an active, helpful, purposeful, loyal and
respected fraternity -—— a fraternity that stands high among the other
fraternities With school administration, faculty and citizens of the

According to the 1997-98 Rush

Theta Chi offers “incoming Pitt
males an opportunity to pursue their

personal ambitions and aspirations in
an atmosphere entirely free from the
generalized conformity of the Greek
system.” Theta Chi’s see themselves as
“free thinkers, establishing ideals that
stress the importance of individuality.”

Theta Chi’s “pride themselves in
the diversity of their brotherhood” and
are eager to say there is no general or
specific classifi-
cation that can
define their
Chapter. They are
painters, poets,
brain surgeons,
