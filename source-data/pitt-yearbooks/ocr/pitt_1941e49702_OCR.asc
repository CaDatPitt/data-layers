  "S. F. A." stands for Student-Faculty
Association, for Thursday afternoon movies,
pep rallies, concerts, and elections that students and faculty sponsor collectively. After
the excitement of the annual independents
vs. fraternities campaign, the succeSsful candidates, thirty in number, met with the ten
faculty members, and the legislature thus
formed, set about discussing basic changes
in the school organization.
  The immense task of selecting the heads
of the various school dances, of Spring
Festival functions, and of Senior Announcement committee, was the responsibility of
the Appointments committee, headed by
Rae Young. The "Information Please" assembly, with Concellor Bowman as the informer, was arranged to give the student
body and opportunity to become familiar
with the   administration's attitudes and
plans.

   The S. F. A. Nationality Rooms committee did its bit when it formally dedicated
the beautiful Italian room, eleventh in the
series of completed memorials.
   Also well supported by the student body
was the Concert Hour presentation of the
Foster Hall quartet of Indianapolis, a negro
vocal group.
   No less a success in S. F. A. ventures was
the pep rally preceding the Pitt-Missouri
game and the Demonstrations Block, headed
by Betty Sapp and Bill Morton.
  Summarizing this year's activities, one is
impressed by the varied program of S. F. A.,
a program which has made S. F. A. stronger
than ever on campus.

  From acorns, oaks; from pennies, a Cathedral; from monthly M.C. luncheons, service!
For as Head Councilman Don Parke's salad
diminishes, so unfolds plans of tentative
projects.
  One innovation was the early December
tea dance. Managed by Al Ludwig in Hotel
Schenley, the affair, honoring the senior
members of the gridiron squad, was enthusiastically added to other projects that have
become a taken-for-granted phase of campus life.
  Versatile councilmen refuse to be detoured from their goal of assisting fellow
students: if Wendell Dietz cannot save a
freshman the price of a necktie by supplying
that Ogg and Ray, Harold Byer, after investigating and iudging his six-week career, may
award him a golden Panther key, the first
sign of an embryonic B.M.O.C.

   Another notation on Don Parke's presidential pad concerned the need for sponsorship
of a bridge club. A committee set to work
- organized interested students, secured
frat and sorority houses for meeting places,
anJ planned instructions for beginners.
   For intermediate classmen, Jim Bateman
decreed the Student-Faculty Hobby Show.
Exhibits ranged from snails, street-car checks,                                           7 v
dolls, to homemade violins and pottery. "We
want to know you and your interests," explained Jim, while stamps fluttered and miniature trains zoomed by. An industrious group

  To the University of Pittsburgh come some
3100 women - to its undergraduate, graduate, and evening schools. The big job of the
twelfth floor administration is to blend these
girls of widely different backgrounds, beliefs,
nationalities, religions, into a harmonious
unit.
  To accomplish this, an organization called
Women's Self-Government Association was
set up twenty-nine years ago. Theoretically,
every woman who enters the University is a
member of this group. Actually it is governed by a smaller group of elected women.
  To facilitate its tremendous task, many
committees are organized and the chairmen
of these committees meet weekly or monthly to discuss common problems. Functioning
smoothly and efficiently, W.S.G.A.'s committees supervise women's elections, arrange
student-faculty meetings, oversee class activities, and guide freshman women through
the difficult first year.
        Mary Ruth Hosey
   This year, under the guidance of Mary
 Ruth Hosey, W.S.G.A. has been particularly
 active. The social committee, in charge of
 Betty Toddie, opened the twelfth floor to
 men. This monthly open-house, complete with
 dancing, bridge, and refreshments, was most
 successful.
 For the more serious minded, Senior Court,
 with Harriet Glasser as Chief Justice, again
 sponsored Dr. Bowman's fireside chats. Oth er projects of W.S.G.A. included Dorothy
 Ornitz's employment clinic series, Ann Rayz's
 activities committee survey, and the unit
work of freshman women, directed by vicepresident Nadine Dean.

                                     Bureau of Retail Training
  The nineteenth floor, with its atmosphere of
handsome modern decorations, houses Pitt's
Retail Bureau, training ground for one of the
most practical and important fields in modern
education-Retail Training. It is a far cry from
the classic American "general store" to the
business of modern retailing;-merchandising,
personnel management, control, store operation, and advertising. In step with the tempo
of modern life, the Bureau is one of three such
graduate schools in the country.                                   Bishop Brown
   Because of the demand for college trained
 men and women in retailing, Bureau gradu ates are usually snapped up before graduation,
 have more than an even chance of landing in
 the sort of store work that interests them most.
 Pittsburgh department stores become a work ing laboratory for students gathered from
 Smith and Sweetbriar, Thiel and Texas, Miami
 and  Minnesota, - colleges and    universities
 from Holyoke to Vanderbilt, from Duke to
 Northwestern.
   Retail Training is a one-year vocational
course with a personality all of its own. Much
of the study actually goes on in Pittsburgh's
downtown department stores, and includes a
full time store supervisory position during the
Christmas rush. Three days a week the student
spends in class, two days in a local store, and
one in research carried on for the benefit of
the Bureau's member stores. At the end of the
year, the student has accumulated practical
knowledge and experience in all phases of department store life.
                       Three days a week
                       The student spends in class,
                       Two days in a local store,
                       And one in research.
Our theme is
                                  This school, this structure is made
                                up of a number of elements: stone,
                                steel, wood, and glass. More im                                portant than any of these is the Flesh
                                and blood that gives warmth to the
                                structure. Without people, there
                                would be no Pitt.

  Anxious to promote wallet-saving social activities and cooperation for a united school
spirit, Gene Tedick and the College Association mottoed "of the students, by the students, and for the students."''
  For the first time since the founding of the
organization, a permanent office was provided
in 828 Cathedral. Here Matilda Helfgott filed
records of experiences and problems for reference by future CA members.
  Another innovation was the introduction of
standing committees with permanent chairmen.
Thus John Hughes handled publicity and made

the campus C.A. conscious. Rudy Janata acted as social chairman, making plans for the
ever-increasing C.A. affairs.
  A "get-acquainted" freshman tea dance, a
pep rally during the C.A. kick-off dance, a
non-corsage autumn formal, and a "Spring
Spree" tea dance, swelled the Student Loan
Fund and made plenty of work for the treasurer, Matt Marshall.
   As the year drew to a close, the C.A. set
plans for reorganization under Helen Buente's
constitutional revision committee.

  Annually some 600 enthusiastic football fans
sign up for the Demonstrations Block to help
cheer the home team on to victory. This year,
under co-chairmen Betty Sapp and Bill Morton
they twirled blue and gold capes and waved
colored papers to make some spectacular formations. During the Carnegie Tech game they
went patriotic and formed the American flag.
Alternate rows held up red and white cards,
and a group in the corner waved whito stars on

they formed a Nittany Lion for the Penn Staters. Revolving "P's" and brilliant yellow Panthers were a part of every game. Various colored tacks and painted seats enabled the
members of the block to get into position at
the given signal from Betty Sapp. The football
season for Demonstrations Block leaders ended
with a banquet in the Cathedral Mansions.

   Organized and functioning on the same
principles of student-faculty cooperation, the
D.S.C. is the S.F.A. of the School of Dentistry.
It serves as the chief contact between the two
groups in a social as well as an administrative
sense. The Student Council assembly consists
of the class officers and one representative for
each fifty students. Its monthly meetings are
presided over by James Battaglia and Leo
Leonard.
   Activities of the group are not confined to
formal business meetings, however. One of the

most anticipated events on the social program
is the annual Student Council dance. At this
year's affair, February 13, in the Hotel Roosevelt, Al Andrews and his orchestra entertained
the Dents and their guests. Al was a familiar
figure at Dental gatherings, social and academic. For in his off-moments from the bandstand, he relinquished his professional name
and became plain George Luccy, Dental'42,
exchanging his swing scores for an odontology
text.

   Making night into day is not a hard job for
the energetic members of the Evening Students Association. Their life begins at 4:30
P.M. It is then that this self-governing unit arranges social affairs, taps to honorary and social fraternities, publishes the Pitt Evening
News, and in general, cooperates with the administration and faculty in student matters.
Yearly, men and women who have shown exceptional ability in commerce are tapped to

debaters demonstrated their art before fortyfive Western Pennsylvania high schools, and in
December, they played host to 400 high-school

  On the four-day Pennsylvania trip the varsity men debated at the University of Western
Maryland, Dickinson, and Bucknell. Including
this 500 miles, the 1500 mile convention trip,
and an additional 250 mile barnstorming tour
to Western Reserve and fourOhio high schools,
their mileage read 2250 miles--slightly less
than the distance from Pittsburgh to San Francisco. The debaters surely went places this
year.....

   "To help promote the spiritual and social

students from Pitt, Tech, Duquesne, Mount
Mercy, and P.C.W. compose the membership
of the local chapter, the only intercollegiate

and fifty couples danced to Dick Stabile's

membership, the Y. W. C. A., under efficient
president Betty Jane MacQueen, did not
neglect any phase of the members' lives. On
Monday she went to the Upperclass Luncheon
Club planned in cooperation with the Y. M.;
she found spiritual inspiration at the seminar
led by Dr. Farmer; and she made new friendships easily during the fun of Association Nites.
The weekly Y. W. bulletin, a project of the
publicity group headed by Ann Rayz, kept her

  No purveyor of literature is the Panther. No
champion of campus politics is the monthly
magazine issued under the guiding hand of
Jack Stauff. Rather it is a handbook of the
casual. To this end it has become a campus

  Alpha Kappa Psi, oldest national commerce fraternity,
has a two fold purpose, to further the welfare of its members and to foster scientific research in the fields of commerce, accounts, and finance. The organization taps male
students enrolled in the School of Business Administration
in both the day and evening school. Together with the
alumni chapters, the members carry on an extensive program of social and professional activity. The biggest social
events of the year were the formal initiation banquets held
in December and April; and informal spring stag party,
held in the Army and Navy Room of the Hotel Henry and
a formal dance at the University Club in March. This year,
the social events were directed by Herman Dietz. Professional activity, under G. Louis Troppman included lectures
by prominent men, industrial trips to the J. &amp; L. Steel mills
and the Post-Gazette, forums on career planning and job
hunting, discussions and debates.

   Omicron chapter of Alpha Omega has survived the "ups and downs" of fraternity existence since its establishment out of the old
Odons Club in 1920. Today its members boast
that it is one of Pitt's largest dental fraternities, and that their new house on Forbes Street
is the most beautiful on campus. Their material
gains, however, have not outweighed their
fraternity spirit or professional abilities. Next
fall when the representatives of thirty-two
other chapters meet in Pittsburgh for their
                   Alpha Omega
national convention, the local Dents will exhibit
both as they display the accomplishments of
the past eighteen years.
   The A.O.'s can talk with equal facility about
pedodontics or their house dances, for they
have professional as well as social interests.
They know a little about bowling, too, having
won the Interfraternity bowling championship.
Most novel of their several social affairs was
their cup and saucer dance to which each boy
brought a cup, and each girl a saucer.

  Capsules, pills and drugs are forgotten when the members of Alpha Zeta Omega meet. Though the furtherance
of pharmaceutical knowledge is the formal aim of the
group, president Dave Pearlman and the officers planned
and successfully completed a broad, diversified program.
  Socially, the pharmacists-to-be staged dances and smokers, and were themselves entertained by their own Ladies
Auxiliary, composed of the sisters and wives of the actives.
The biggest event was the Spring Formal on April twentyfourth in the Roosevelt Hotel.
   Other yearly projects discussed at the bi-monthly meetings included the loan fund, which is maintained for the
benefit of members, and the national convention, this year
held in Cincinnati, but scheduled to be held in Pittsburgh
next year with Mu chapter as the host.
   Also on the agenda were the initiation of tappees,
pledgeship of new men, and the role that A.Z.O. alumni
may play in assisting graduates to find employment.

   Graduation from the School of Dentistry is
only the beginning so far as membership in
Delta Sigma Delta is concerned. For this honorary professional fraternity is primarily a graduate group, a dental society which considers the
problems affecting the profession, legislation,
p u b li c relations and the "dental aspect,"
in general. Thirty undergraduate Dents comprise the preliminary chapter which maintains
the fraternity house; while the graduate chapter includes more than 300 leading dentists in
Allegheny County.
          Delta Sigma Delta
  At the national convention of Delta Sigma
Delta, held in Cleveland last September, Dr. A.
C. Young was elected Supreme Grand Master,
highest fraternity post. His election being the
second national honor for the local chapter
since 1923, a banquet in his honor was held at
the Hotel Schenley in February. There, members presented Dr. Young with a movie camera
to help him record fraternity activities during
his term of office. In addition to the banquet,
the undergraduate chapter gave a dance this
spring.
Dental
InterFraternity
Council
Rossner, Shumnate, Peters, Myers, Choby, K ang
  Improve, Improve! The watch-word of the Dental Interfraternity Council. Improve fraternity activity, student facilities, student-faculty relations, themselves. To these ends,
the Council, consisting of two officers from each of the
three Dental fraternities, Psi Omega, Delta Sigma Delta
and Alpha Omega, has been active in coordinating the
interfraternity activities of the groups. Leadership, by fraternity rotation, was in the hands of Paul Klang, Alpha
Omega, this year.
  Monthly meetings, held alternately in the fraternity
houses, are complete with business and refreshments, occasional dances are anticipated generally, but the big thing
in the life of the Council is interfraternity competition.
Each year Dean Freisell provides the all-point fraternity
trophy, and the contests begin, last long, and are accompanied by frequent displays of the famous Dent spirit. Athletic competition is the chief activity with teams participating in tournaments of ping pong, basketball, bowling,
touch football, and swimming. This year, Psi Omega won
the I.F. trophy.

   Ever watch the action of morphine on the
heart of a box turtle? Then you ought to sit in
:n one of the demonstration meetings of Kappa
Psi. For the student pharmacologists in this professional fraternity have used the experience
gained in class or as laboratory assistants to
perform experiments that will contribute to
their own knowledge and perhaps to the profession to which they aspire. And that is their
aim, whether preparing papers to be read before the American Pharmaceutical Society, or
pharmacology displays for health shows at Buhl
Planetarium. Following the appointment of Bill
Kappa Psi
Haeckler and Bill Fleming as laboratory assistants to Dr. Claus, the fraternity planned to establish these posts as permanent ones in which
Kappa Psi men might receive additional practical training.
   Kappa Psi has not forsaken the social aspect
of fraternity life. The annual formal dance in
the Keystone Hotel, April 25, ended a series
of social programs which included a reunion
dance, a formal at the Fort Pitt Hotel in January, a dinner-dance in February, and the traditional "third degree" initiation ceremonies.

  These hard-working    "pharmaceuticals" forget about
chemicals and scientific equations once a month as they
gather in Heinz House for a regular business meeting.
  After cultural and scientific endeavors for the coming
month are discussed and a visit to St. Johns General Hospital is arranged, the talk turns to more social things.
  With the first snowfall of the year, the girls plan a skating
party. One of the senior members still blushes when the
girls remind her of the north, south, east, west sprawl she
made while roller-skating at the Diamond Rink. After plans
are made for a spring dance, their most important event
of the season, the girls are told of the candy sale. Congratulations were given to Clara Mehr, Collembolae member,
for her perfect attendance and punctuality.

  A hayride, a Halloween masquerade dance,
and a fall formal at the Fort Pitt hotel-these
activities represent merely a start for the Psi
Omega boys. At the start of the second semester the actives introduced the pledges to
the house with a gay house dance. A winter
and spring formal and two more house dances
topped off the full year of festivity. But there
are more serious moments over at the house on
North Bellefield Street. The members proudly
Psi Omega
claim that of the keys given annually to the
upper 12 per cent of the dental graduating
class, Psi Omegas usually claim the majority.
Last year one of the Psi O's took the first key
and of the other three winners, two were his
fraternity brothers. In their spare moments, between classes and fraternity activities, some of
the Psi Omegas write for the School of Dentistry magazine, "Dental Rays."

  You have fitted yourself into the complexity of all the things that are Pitt. You have
come to recognize that it is no cloistered school, shut off from the agitation of the
world, no sanctuary in which the student may withdraw into silent contemplation of the
universe. Rather, it is in the midst of all motion, moving as all the world moves, pulling
you safely always through the maelstrom, never around it.
  As liquids may swirl over the mouth of a funnel and eventually combine in the tube,
so do you here, and those about you come, each one different, to the mouth before the
downswing. You come from different high schools, with your own views, your own beliefs, your own social backgrounds. There is no true chemical union as you pass through
the tube: there is only a blending and a levelling, in which these elements that are you
retain their identity, yet complement each other.
  From the farm, from the metropolis, from the mining-town you come. Perhaps you will
return to these. Still you will have been alte red.

                                              A preliminary tuneup at Camp Pitt early in September
                                           marked the beginning of the Heinz Chapel Choir's activi                                           ties. The members chuckle when they recall how Louise
                                           Negley upset a canoe, dunking neatly attired and surprised

                                           group.
                                             At a tea in the Commons Room in December, the late

   Fifty proficient musicians, fifty sparkling instruments,
augmented by Theodore M. Finney's directing, are a study
in harmony and a symphony in blending, each time the
University Symphony Orchestra performs. Its members are
Pitt's music students, whose first task it is to interpret Bach,
Beethoven and Brahms, but who can, nevertheless, swing
out at informal parties like the one held at North Park in
November. More often the entire orchestra plays, although
the string ensemble and the brass and French horn quartets
have been featured in their own concerts.
   On April 2, the annual home concert given in Foster
Auditorium climaxed the concert season. Later in the
spring, the orchestra members came out from behind their
own instruments to enjoy the music of another band at the
spring formal. On this occasion, three-year veterans received engraved gold keys for service and ability to revamp the classics in approved Raymond Scott style, or
perform the "Nutcracker Suite" a la Finney.

   Top performances were the high notes of the Glee
Club's season. After members sang to their large following
in several Eastern states, they returned to Foster Memorial
and an enthusiastic audience of students. The repertoire
ranged from the lively bass solo of Bob Davis' catch recipe
for "Shortenin Bread," to the grand ensemble performance
of "Old Man River."
  This, the fifty-first year of the organization, saw president Ed Trembath welcome fifteen new members in time
for them to enjoy the tour through New York and New
Jersey. Here they appeared at a national educational convention, and presented a program of American songs.
Once, they reversed the usual procedure and the club was
on the listening end of harmony when they danced together with other campus musical organizations to the music of
Benny Burton at the Musician's Ball. After this interlude,
Mr. Theodore Finney caught up his baton again for the
spring concert and a tuneful finale.

climaxing event of a series of appearances before the "Y,"
the College Club, and other organizations. The first was the
Beaux Arts program, which introduced freshman women
to music and drama at the University. Addison Jones, the
famed pianist, also appeared and was enthusiastically applauded. Under the direction of Mrs. Mildred Lissfelt and
the leadership of Esther Groenert, president, the 45 women
spent weeks preparing their final concert, which was presented in an Elizabethan setting. Ruffled, colorful costumes
and high-starched collars set the theme for Carol Sand's
old English tune, "A Poor Soul Sat Sighing," and Mabel
McGirr's rendition of Gershwin's "Summertime."

  Pitt Players this year, under the guidance of director
Buell Whitehill and president Bill McElwain, completed an
exacting schedule. In addition to choosing three of the most
difficult plays of the modern theatre, they took part in two
other programs. "Why the Chimes Rang" was presented
during the Christmas season in conjunction with the Heinz
Chapel Choir and W.A.A. dancing classes. Leo Harter narrated, while Betty Brunk, John Glasson, Paul DeMerit, and
Jules Cubernek interpreted the action by pantomime. In
February, Players joined with the Heinz Chapel Choir to
present the program "America at Home" at the Atlantic
City national convention for educators. Hulda Tully and
Leo Harter gave selected readings of modern poets.
  Taking time off, however, to entertain themselves, the
Players sponsored two dances with Cap and Gown Undergradute Club, and ended their social program with a May
banquet. At this occasion, Players who had earned eight or
more points in the acting, technical, or business fields were
awarded keys.

   It was lights! camera! action! with Pitt Players when
 Holywood invaded the campus. Kleig lights replaced foot lights as Players deserted the stage long enough to make a
 movie.
   The film records the complete production of a play from
 the casting until the opening night. The Players chose
 "Golden Boy" and so the camera moved along with the
 routine preparations.
   Photographers set up their equipment for closeups of the
cast during rehearsals; of Joe Diely and his crew building
scenery in the technical shop; of Emil Diely, electrician; of
manager Jane Lintleman arranging the props; of Al Glass,
publicity manager and Mollie Ortinberg, ticket manager,
attending to the finances.
   Besides this project, the technical crew under Frank
Mason went about their usual work of drafting, building
and painting sets, and found time to build scenery and
work backstage for the Pittsburgh Opera Society's production of "Marriage of Figaro."

Pitt Players' Shows
My Heart's In The Highlands
  With house lights down and stage lights up,
Pitt Players, on November 6th and 8th, presented William Saroyan's "My Heart's in the Highlands." Leo Harter, as the unrecognized but
self-appreciating poet, and Harold Shapiro, his
gymnastically inclined son, are visited by a
bugle-blowing Scotchman portrayed by Irv
Avner. Impressed by the bugle solos, Johnny
and his father continue to search for the "heart
in the highlands" even after they are evicted
from their home. The actors' difficulty lay in
maintaining the sombre yet hopeful mood
throughout the play. But the Players with their
candid characterizations gave a professional
performance.
  December    I th and 13th, Pitt's Players did
Maxwell Anderson's "High Tor." Romantic Van
Van Dorn, played by Jim Dunn, tries to retain his
ancestral mountain and natural way of living in
the face of modern exploitation. Aided by ghostly Dutchmen stranded in the Catskills, he outwits
the despoilers and makes peace with his earthly
love, Judith (Louise Rowland). Best situation was
when the crooked colleagues, Paul De Merit and
Dan Cannon, were trapped in a steamshovel cage
suspended far out over the palisades and prayed
for an inexpensive salvation. Bill Patrick, first student to design a Players' set, worked successfully
with the problems of an outdoor scene and a
small Foster stage.
   "Golden Boy", by Clifford Odets, furnished
the Players with a knockout drama for the close
of their season. The story of the violin player
turned pugilist, his rise to financial heights and
his ultimate downfall, starred Larry Morris,
with Jeanine Stephenson furnishing the romantic interest. Although classed as a comedy,
the three-act drama provided much pathos,
especially in the role of the self-sacrificing
father, played by Leo Harter. On the other
hand, some good laughs resulted from the action and dialogue of Peggy Martin and Israel
Grossman, as the young married couple; Allan
Gould, as the bungling fight manager; and
August Trovaioli as the gangster menace.
With this four star performance, Pitt Players
climaxed a top-notch year.
   Pitt Players closed the 1941 season with a
Spring Festival week production of that comedy
of family life, "You Can't Take It With You." The
story is concerned with the efforts of the slightly
delirious Sycamore family to marry their daughter, Peggy Megee, to the rich boss' son, Jim
Dunn. Any quiet evening at home found the
happy family engaged in their various diversions:
Essie, Alice Lewis, toe dancing under the tutelage
of Kolenkhov, Allan Gould; Penny, played by
Molly Ortinberg and Anne Tumpane, painting;
Papa Sycamore, Bob Shissler, concocting firecrackers; and philosophizing Grandpa, Bill McElwain, presiding over all.
  Although the play was well known to the audience because of its professional production and
later Hollywood version, Pitt Players iniected a
new spirit into the familiar situations that was
good for long and loud laughs.

   Life in a newspaper office can be hectic and
 beset with difficulties. Swing can convert a ballet
 into a four-star success. Love can triumph!
   George Hyde realized all this, so "Head Over
 Heels" is the whimsical story of Johnny Higgins,
 debt-ridden Daily Star reporter, madly in love with
 Camille, the glamorous prima ballerina of the Ballet
 Russe de Castle Shannon. Camille is really publisher
 P. G. Butterfield's daughter, Adrienne.
   When Johnny turns the office into a race-track
 trying to escape Joe and Moe, two sure-fire bill
 collectors, Mr. Butterfield sees red and fires Johnny.
 He attaches a rider. Daughter Adrienne is forbid den to see hero Higgins again.
   Boris Sergi Dmitri Ivanavitch Petrovsky, general
 director and choreographer of the ballet company,
 enters. Johnny learns first, Camille's real identity;
 second, that Uncle Louis has conveniently died leavd Joe -Gofsman and  Endy

Military OFficers
  National defense took its toll of both student and faculty men throughout the entire
University this year when the call to the colors
sounded. And it effected a complete reorganization of the Military Department when the
commissioned personnel, with the exception of
Colonel Wilson, were called to field duty. As a
result, Col. Wilson was promoted to head the
Department, and Captain Cameron, Captain
Wills, and Lieutenants Dougan, Husband, Havlak, and Campbell were appointed by the War
Department to assist him.
  Headlines of the News in the year of World
War II announced that a military coup ousted

the Political Science Department from the
fourth floor, but at any rate, a new staff in new
quarters was but one of many changes designed to make the R.O.T.C. a more efficient
unit. This year's student enrollment, highest in
the department's history, was made possible
through increased Federal quotas, although
qualification standards were raised. To keep
pace with the expansion, cadet commissions
were granted to juniors for the first time. New
uniforms for the Band and advanced corps
members, even new metal chevrons, streamlined the University's standing army.
   In addition to conducting classwork and drill
for the Coast Artillery and Medical Corps,
Col. Wilson and Captain Cameron supervised
the activities of the Pitt Band, Pitt Rifles, Scabbard and Blade, and the R.O.T.C. Rifle Team;
while the coed sponsors kept up the Corps'
morale.
   Order of the days in mid-April called for
rehabilitation of cadets to uniforms after a
winter layoff. This was in preparation for the
annual spring   inspection at which ranking
Corps area     officers reviewed  the  Coast
Artillery unit. The dress parade occasioned
by their visit was the climax of R.O.T.C. activity for the school year.

   Guarding the entrance of the Cathedral
from 7:30 A. M. to 6:00 P. M. was but one of
the ways by which Scabbard and Blade tappees proved their merit. Hell Week featured
other tests, such as a written examination on
military knowledge, general drill information,
qualities of leadership, and the United States
military affairs.
  The acid test of all was Hell Night. It
loomed over tappees throughout the week.
Their expectations, however, were even exceeded that long night in Clairton Park; and
when it was all over, they were cadets in D.

        "For the crowd there's a thrill
          When the Rifles hold their drill...
... For they are the finest in the land" -  so their
marching song epitomizes the core of the ROTC.
Gentlemen and soldiers all, proficient at drill,
adept in military routine, at home on drill field or
ballroom floor.
   In their serious endeavor, the members try to
become better officers by advancing themselves
in the schooling of military science, and by serving as guards of honor at University events. Socially they display a gentleman's gallantry as they
escort their dates to the "Little Military Ball,"
given annually at the Twentieth Century Club.
Frequently, the officers-to-be put formality aside
to become just another gang of good fellows reveling in a demonstration of their own brand of
heckling of the pledges who survive a semester of
rigorous drill and examination.
  You are still in the midst of things here. You do not have the full perspective of

as a freshman and first walked through the Commons Room and today, you have been
changed. But you do not yet realize the immensity of it.
  You have developed warm familiarity with the University. You know where the elevators stop; what the walls look like under the plaster; where the pencil sharpener is;
which professors check attendance and which do not. These things are of you; the

Fanny Panther, the Band executed a Conga
exhibition and many other formations ranging
from a living map of Pennsylvania flanked by
the Cathedral and Penn State's Old Main to
the Texas Star of S. M. U.
  Big events of the year for the 125 bandmen
were the trips to Columbus and Durham and
the Home Concert on May 8. Between the
highlights of their marching and touring seasons, the special concert band performed in
many district schools and played a four-day
concert run in Pennsylvania and New York, in
the latter part of April.

  When nineteen members of Mortar Board
gathered about the fireplace at Heinz House
one January night, every subject was discussed
from luncheon problems to new hair-dos. Between bits of idle jabber, Gene Pyle presented
chapter business. A letter from Mrs. W. M.
Fowler, national vice-president, recalls her recent visit to campus and aroused thoughts of
days to be spent in the Pocono Mountains and
at the coming June convention. Compliments
went to Betty Dils on her Christmas party at
which gifts and original poetry were exchanged. Arrangements for a Mortar Board
and O.D.K. party were made, and Betty Jane
MacQueen was heard making plans for carrying through the colors of the two honoraries on
her table decorations. Adele Yorio was appointed chairman for the entertainment program. The meeting ended with Mortar Boarders rehearsing a dance routine for the party at
which they intended to amaze the O.D.K.
boys.

   Everyone agreed that the Founders' Day Banquet on December
10 was the most important O.D.K. event to take place on campus.
Cy Hungerford, the cartoonist, and Dr. Andrey Avinoff, director
of Carnegie Museum, were guest speakers at the formal dinner
held in the College Club. There were, also, the bi-weekly luncheon
meetings, and the two occasions on which members pinned the
names of tappees to their giant O.D.K. key.
   But the event to which O.D.K. men looked forward most was
the national convention held at Louisiana University March 13-16.
President Rugy Aldisert represented Gamma Circle as the official
delegate, and was accompanied by Irv Kaufman, Bill Patrick, Dave
Buente, Cort Bacall, Joe Roberts, Al Gross, and Dave Tucker. C.
Stanton Belfour, director of the University Extension Bureau, and
E. A. Batchelder, assistant registrar, represented the faculty.
When, a week later, "Little O.D.K.," a turtle mascot, arrived at
the University, he brought the news of Mr. Belfour's election as
national president of the fraternity.

 After complimenting Dorothy Stoltz on the
 good food, the girls settle down to business.
 It is another dinner meeting of Cwens, national
 honorary activities fraternity for sophomore
 women. Gathered around the large table, the
 girls listen to reports from Betty Kalish on the
 progress of the Cwen directory-the little red
and silver booklet listing his address and her
phone number. President Betty Haldeman asks
for volunteers to read copy, and Lois Blotter,
Hazel Miller, and Alma Nicholas offer their
services. Plans are discussed for the sale of
flowers on May Day, and the names of freshman girls who will be eligible for membership
at the end of the year are suggested. After
a brief talk by Helen Benowitz, describing the

 (well, just about, anyway!). After all, the Smoker and blond
 Cwens are regular yearly highlights, but the order of business
 at one of the semi-monthly meetings is of immediate all-import ance. So whether the soph BMOC's appoint Danny Mash to
 compile a twenty-five-year history of the honorary at Pitt or
 enjoy secretary Shaughency's minutes- minutes that defy ed ucation and English Composition I and 2 - the youthful activi ties leaders are on the job. Their devotion to things Druid has

  What Phi Beta Kappa is to a College scholar
Beta Gamma Sigma is to the Bus Ad student.
Scholastic standing is the primary consideration, since only ten per cent of a graduating
class may be tapped. A smaller number is frequently chosen, for the fraternity is proud of
its selections. To encourage an early start for
potential members, Beta Gamma Sigma maintains a plaque on which the names of outstanding   Business Administration freshmen
have been inscribed. The individual thus recognized by the group is given a certificate of
merit.
  Bus Ad business provides the topic for discussions at B.G.S. luncheon meetings. Their
annual dinner, held this year on March 21, features traditional five minute talks by the
pledges on business and economics. Ranging
in subject matter from pickles to bonds, these
talks are designed to give the pledges a background and stage presence, and the activities
and alumni hecklers a pleasant evening.

   Cap and Gowners went through their routine
once more. This time neither on the Nixon stage nor
before a capacity audience, but at a business meeting of the Undergrad Club. And what business is
more important than studying last year's C.&amp;G.
show to perfect the 1941 "Head Over Heels" performance?
  When Ed Trembath called for new business, members planned the informal "Highland Fling" and
"KO" dances, which double-featured with the Pitt
Players' productions, all for a one-dollar, doubleduty ticket! Bud Schlesinger led these socials, the
first of the theater-dance mergers sponsored by the
two dramatic groups.
  Later on, discussion centered about the smoker
to welcome Edward Morgan, new dramatic-dance
director of Cap and Gown, Inc. Also on the agenda
were the tapping ceremonies, to be conducted on
the Nixon stage after the Friday night show, and
plans for the next monthly luncheon when undergraduate actors and producers would again get
together to reminisce.

buzzed with comment, flipped notebooks
shut, and adjourned to West Penn Hospital's

techniques in their own foreign-sounding,
medicated lingo. Now our Owrey is not the
head of a surgical society, nor was his the
scalpel-wielding; he's prexy of those degreeless, beardless medicos, famed for their two
point two averages and medically preferred
for their character and personality.   First
hand witnessing of a clavicle-setting of a deappendixizing is only an item on the honorary's year-round program. They tap in January, again on Scholars' Day, fete the fortunate few at a smoker, and follow through
scribe Neal Veenis's semi-monthly postcard
invitations to devote Tuesday's fifth hour to
scholarship and social committee reports.
Results of said committees? A soaring scholastic average; a Cadaver Caper labeled
"terrific."

   Delta Delta Lambda was named and inspired by Mr. D. D. Lessenberry, the head of the Commercial Education Department. The
principal purpose of this professional and honorary fraternity is to
give the students of commercial education an opportunity to
broaden the scope of their interests in the field and to become
acquainted with leaders in commercial education. There are over
300 members, both undergraduate and graduate. Its governing
body consists of the executive committee of the graduate council
and officers of the undergraduate group, presided over by Jane
Poinar.
   The activities held yearly are numerous; yet all of them help to
enrich the knowledge and understanding of their particular field.
At the initiation banquet last fall, Dean Jacobsen was tapped as
an honorary member. Frances Rowell was chairman of this affair as
well as of the dinner-dance at the spring initiation.
   Every month Mr. Theodore Woodward, chairman of the graduate council, edits a bulletin named "Lesson" which includes special
activities by members and serves as a guide to new members.
  At Christmas time, sobriety was put aside and the group had a
party with grab bags, games, and toys. Installation of officers at
Heinz House on April 22 was followed by the last affair of the
year, a picnic at Mr. Lessenberry's farm, hostessed by charming
Mother Spence. This last meeting helped students to clinch friendships before the semester ended.

  Pre-lawstudents whose 2 point average
qualified them for membership in the honorary pre-legal fraternity, heard Mrs. Marie G.
Lindsay, registrar, speak on procedure for entrance to the School of Law, at one of the
fraternity meetings. They learned many facts:
that one must register as a law student with
the state and county bar associations, that
citizen and faculty sponsors are necessary, and
that, in all, it is a difficult procedure. At another meeting Judge Elder W. Marshall talked
about everyday happenings in the legal profession. And so the agenda went, that these
students might better understand their profession as a study and a practice.
   Dr. Eugene A. Gilmore, dean of the School
of Law, and prominent lawyers were guests
of the fraternity at its annual banquet, in April.
At the spring tap day exercises, John Marshall
concluded its 1941 activities with the naming
to membership of additional legal aspirants.

   Glancing through the minutes taken by Regis Larkin, secretary
of Kappa Phi Kappa, national honorary and professional educational fraternity for men, we find that our future profs really did
things and in a big way. A successful rushing season increased the
number who received the benefits of the club's letter writing clinic.
Led by president Fred Roth and directed by Mr. Lessenberry the
newly organized job analysis clinic taught members the correct
procedure during interviews. These clinics helped students learn
how to obtain teaching positions.
  Relaxing and learning were combined at the luncheon-meetings.
Here, good times, good food, and the expanding of educational
philosophies by guest speakers made the affairs a success. The
banquet and song festival held at the College Club added to the
Kappa Phi Kappa 1941 minute book which grew under the recordings of a big year.

Pi Lambda Theta
  Pi Lambda Theta aims high as an honorary
fraternity for women in education. Its members
foster high standards of scholarship and professional training. Maintaining an interest in
educational activities and encouraging graduate work, Delta chapter carries out these ideals
in its program.
  The formal dinner-business meetings feature
speakers who are authorities in their fields. Dr.
E. A. Dimmick spoke on the role of the teacher
in the present emergency and R. Herbert L.
Spencer's subject was "Our Leisure, an Asset
of Democracy."
  Although the members are primarily graduate teachers, many undergraduates are active.
Evelyn Westermann, Esther Groenert, and
Gina Filipponi were among the recipients of
keys presented in January. Sponsoring a sidelight to regular Pi Lambda Theta activities,
Betty  Kimberling  and   Rosemarye   Bunting
served as hostesses at Home's fashion show
and tea in early April and when Delta chapter
entertained junior women in education, Esther
Glick and Margaret Kentsler aided with the
program.

 presented Guy V. Miller, foreign editor of the Pittsburgh Press,
 who discussed the background of the European War. Not only two point fivers but faculty and other students attended. Another
 meeting was devoted to an entertaining discussion of Persia given
 by Robert H. Steiner, visiting professor.
   Although Pi Tau Phi stands for scholastic achievement in the
liberal arts College with 2.5 as their average, a glance at the activities of the members and at the interests of the fraternity prove
that they are not bookworms. For instance, there are Freda Jaffe,
president of W.S.A. Jane Vorech, Mortar Board member, Irv
Kaufman, O.D.K. man, and Seymour Kerber, copy editor of the
Pitt News, all prominent in campus activities. And to further prove

of the fall smoker were read before the discussion of new business. Since many complex
problems arise during the fraternity's free instruction to freshmen, the tutorial service was
discussed. Plans for the annual spring banquet
were developed, after the president had announced the speaker for the next monthly
meeting. Each speaker, reminded the president, talks on a subject in his specialized field.
A proposal to establish a reading clinic to improve the reading habits of students was
made, but action was deferred pending further
discussion. Before the meeting closed, congratulations were extended to William C.
Kelly, who, with a 3.0 average, received the
scholarship placque awarded annually to the
freshman having the highest average.

   "Everything to do with the earth" is a slogan that might serve
as the motto for Sigma Gamma Epsilon, honorary mining and
metallurgical fraternity. Its members come from the fields of
mining, geology, metallurgy, and petroleum engineering.
   Two meetings each month, a luncheon and a dinner meeting,
were the chief activities of Sigma Gamma Epsilon this year. Held
in Heinz House these gatherings featured forum discussions led
by eminent geologists and engineers. Dr. Tolmochoff, formerly
of the Imperial Russian Museum, and Dr. R. E. Sherrill were among
these speakers. The fraternity joined with Sigma Tau and Pi Tau
Sigma in May to give a dance at the Churchill Valley country club.
  The brothers, and the pledges who completed the initiation
tests, including the construction of an autographed compass model, have decided upon a new freshman orientation program. They
will also award associate membership status and A.I.M.M.E. publication subscriptions to the most outstanding freshmen in the
School of Mines.

   One speaks of college spirit as
though it were something into which
the student must be Fitted. By now,
you are aware that it is you who
have moved rather than been moved
makes the spirit what it is, that you
by it.
   You are now In the midst of all things moving. You cannot stop to
ask what is happening around you, for you are a part of it. There is no
mirror by which you may see the totality. Yet when the time comes and
you may look back upon all of this, you will have been happy for it, and
you will have deemed the ends worth the effort.

  Once a month the members of Sigma Kappa
Phi, national honorary modern language fraternity, meet at Heinz House and center their
program about a foreign country. This year's
German meeting typified the idea for all the
gatherings conducted by president Audrey
McLaren.
  Guten Abend greeted the members as they
arrived. After taking off their coats, they sat
down to a real German Fest, a dinner of sauerkraut and Speck, wilted lettuce, coffee and
apple strudle, which put everyone in a mood
for the program. Gretchen Schutte led the
group in singing "Auch du leiber Augustien,"
"Schnitzelbunk," and many other German
songs.
  With Mrs. Lotte Lohstoeter and Dr. Whitford Shelton looking on, everyone joined in the
folk dances until they were all out of breath.
To relax, they sat down and listened to Paula
Glaab's "Information Please."
   "Auf Wieder Sehen" and "Gute Nacht"
and another meeting of Sigma Kappa Phi
comes to an end.

as she prepared the food for another dinner meeting.
   Kitchen samples soon gave way to larger portions as the
girls found their place cards and sat down to individual chicken pies. After exclaiming over the lovely centerpiece of
flowers arranged by Julia Waida, they chatted of things, literary and not so literary, then went on to discuss the immediate business of the day. Regina Heinz, Ann Rayz, Tillie Helfgott, and Alice Lewis were complimented on their successful
parties for the Panther, Owl, and News staffs. Plans were
made for tap day and the spring initiation banquet. All were
reminded of the coming Xylon day, during which high school
journalists would be taken through the Cathedral and a loving
cup would be awarded for the best high school publication.

local honorary science fraternity for women,
fosters interest in science and aims to create
fellowship among women students in the field.
   Meeting twice a month with Marie Gilbert
presiding, the undergraduate actives join with
the alumnae for dinner and a group discussion
stimulated by a guest speaker. Genial Dr. Edna
Higbee, faculty advisor, aids the group and
Miss Inez McGill, alumnae advisor, in making
their tentative plans.
  With a quality point average of 2.0, members are tapped each fall and spring from the
group of biology, chemistry, physics, and
mathematics majors.
  Quax's program attempts to cover the many
interests of Beverly Ransome, Marie Pragliola,
and Lois Voland. Consequently, Dr. Alexander
Silverman from the chemistry department, Dr.
Albert Staniland from mathematics, and Miss
Alma Young from Montefiore Hospital spoke
before meetings of these scientifically-minded

  Composed of one Senior and one Junior
from each of the engineering departments,
the Association Cabinet is the governing
body for the Engineering School. It functions to make the routine of thirty semester
credits less tedious, and at its weekly meeting acts in the interests of the student,
whether it is by realizing the dream of an
Engineers' Lounge, or organizing intramural
teams.
  The Association sponsored two dances,
and two smokers this year. Gee Skinner
chairmaned the first dance, Bill Smith the
first smoker: Paul Papanek and Edward Edge
were in charge of the second semester affairs. The "Jalopy Dance" May 2 featured
the awarding of a 1931 Ford as a door prize.
  The decision to initiate an Engineering
section in the Owl was made and carried out
by the Cabinet. By installing automatic coke
dispensers in State Hall, they also raised
funds for the conversion of Heinz House
into a student lounge. Good Business men?
Yes, but better engineers.

   Chemical Engineers
   Every other week the members of the
Chemical Engineering seminar hold their
meeting   in Mellon institute auditorium.
There, they learn up-to-the-minute information about industrial processes and become
acquainted with authorities in their field.
Alternate meetings, held in the Cathedral,
feature guest industrialists and engineers or
movies about chemical engineering problems. To maintain a well-rounded program,
chairman John McKlveen frequently invites
men in other fields, religion, psychology, literature, to speak. The associations and
friendships made in these seminars help
maintain their unity beyond the scope of
mere class work. The Chemical Engineers
danced at Webster Hall, April 18, and
throughout the year entered teams in intramural athletic competition.
     Civil Engineers
   A seminar sports night at Trees
Gym, bowling, smokers, and a spring
dance. A social fraternity rushing program? No, merely a few of the outside activities of the Civil Engineering
Seminar, but social pleasantries are not
their only purpose. The student and
faculty leaders have set out to learn the
ins and outs of engineering defense,
bridge construction, super highways,
and dams. When J. A. Michels, editor
of the "Highway Builder" magazine,
spoke before the group, they even
learned the application of engineering
to journalism.
   Electrical Engineers
   Transmission fie-ups, phase differences,
 and kilowatt hours, are familiar terms in the
 Electrical Engineering seminars, where stu dens literally aim to meet "problems and
 personalities" on common ground. The
 problems are those dealing with the crea tion, transmission, and distribution of elec trical energy; the personalities are eminent
 electrical engineers and utilities men. The
 engineers, however, often provide speakers
 from their own ranks to discuss thesis ma terial or research. Two meetings were con ducted by Eta Kappa Nu, electrical en gineering fraternity to acquaint freshmen
 with the fraternity and to give pledges op portunity to discuss topics such as "Popula tion vs. Power Lines" or "Radiant Heat
 Energy."
   Industrial Engineers
   Are you looking for the Industrial Engineering Seminar? You might try Shadyside Academy. For with the expansion that
followed the Defense Training Program, the
Industrial Engineering department moved to
new headquarters. The difficulty is, however,
that the industrial engineers are on the move
in more ways than one. In their seminars,
they survey the industries, studying manufacturing processes and methods. And the
best way to do this is to study first hand, so
that many of the seminars are conducted in
industrial plants and laboratories. In their
classroom meetings, I.E. students keep
abreast of the times through lectures by
leading industrialists.

Mechanical Engineers
  Although the Mechanical and Aeronautical Engineering seminars are combined,
there is a division of classes so that Juniors
and Seniors meet together, while Sophomores and Freshmen conduct their own
seminars. By this arrangement, the engineering problems discussed can be chosen in
accordance with class and thesis work. But
in addition to discussing specific problems
in mechanical engineering, these seminars
are planned to provide a general cultural
background. Speakers participating in this
phase of the seminar program were Mr.
Gerten, representative of the Blawnox Company who talked on the political and industrial situation in France, Dr. H. C. Carlson,
and Dr. Farmer.
         Pi Tau Sigma
     Candidates for membership to the
   Mechanical Engineering fraternity, Pi
   Tau Sigma, have to be well-versed in
   the practical application of their book
   learning. Each of them must draw a
   plate of the fraternity key and have it
   blueprinted before he is accepted. He
   has the alternative of turning out a
   huge wooden wrench, but either article
   must conform to rigid specifications of
   engineering detail.
     Activities carried on by the mem   bers of Pi Tau Sigma include the edit   ing of a departmental newspaper and
   management of a library. This year two
   banquets at the Cathedral Mansions, a
   fall pledge dance, and a picnic in May
   filled the fraternity's 1941 social cal   endar.

   "Attention, men! This is an inspection," may sound like a
military command, but to the prospective pledges of Sigma Tau,
honorary engineering fraternity, it's a simple slide rule drill. And
when President Jim Bateman shouts, "On your mark -  go,"
he's not starting the 440 but just a speed test of efficiency on
the "slippery stick." This is only the beginning for pledges of
Sigma Tau. Keeping strictly to the engineering theme, they make
a carefully detailed plaque on an enormous piece of white paper,
upon which they obtain the signatures of all the actives, honorary members, and alumni of Sigma Tau. While resting between
calls, each must polish a rough bronze pyramid, the emblem of
Sigma Tau, to smooth perfection. Handed in when finished,
these pyramids are returned, chromium plated, to the new members at the semi-annual initiation banquets. Together with these,
the pledges keep their scroll name-catalogues as a memory of
"carefree Sigma Tau days."

Varsity Football
      Only an over-abundance of bad breaks kept the 1940 Panther
   football squad from finishing the season on the credit side of the
   ledger. Facing one of the most formidable grid schedules in the
   country, Pitt's tough, and at times, forcible Bowsermen were able
   to struggle through with a record of three wins against four losses
   and an unexpected tie. Although the team surprised many experts
                                   by nearly upsetting unfavorable
  Coach Charley Bowser             predictions a number of times,
                                   Dame Fortune just wasn't with

                                     But the season did produce
                                   its quota of outstanding play                                   ers. Added to the ever growing

                                   the name of Captain Ted Ko                                   netsky. Edgar Jones and Bob

PITT FOOTBALL RESUME
   PITT   7............. 30 OHIO STATE
   A super passing attack defeated the Panthers, when
they met Ohio State at Columbus for the first game
of the 1940-41 season. George Kracum and Bobby
Thurbon played outstanding ball but the Buckeye airraid was too hot to handle. A brief play-by-play description of the game might sound something like this:
There goes an Ohio State forward, it's a touchdown.
There's another Buckeye pass, another touchdown.
Again a pass... pass the  aspirin.
     PITT   7.............     7  S. M. U.
  Why did the water boy "truck" onto the field as the
team called time, out? Why did Coach Bowser "Suzy
Q" down the line looking for substitutes? Why did
Sekela call signals to the tempo of "Beat Me Daddy
Eight to the Bar?" Why did the Panther and the Mustang dance the "Rhumboogie?" Students??? That's
right, you're right. That Southern Methodist swing
band was here again. The Stadium rocked in rhythm.
Though the game ended in a 7-7 tie, no one was disappointed because "It Ain't What Ya Do, It's the Way
Howdie Do It."
     PITT  19............13 MISSOURI
  Looking forward to their first victory of the new
season, the Panther gridmen of 1940 play their home
opener in the stadium against Missouri. "Pitchin' Paul
Christman" shows rifle accuracy in his passes, and
"Slippery" Harry Ice skirts the Pitt ends time after
time. But, neither of these Tigers can retard the steady,
machine-like movement of the Pitt eleven this afternoon.
    PITT  12.............24 FORDHAM
  Gloom! That's an ugly word! But it was an uglier day
when the Panthers met Sleepy Jim Crowley's Rams in
the Stadium. In Pittsburgh's first snowstorm of the year,
fifty thousand faithful fans passed through the turnstiles, umbrellas up, spirits down. After three hours of
snow, a rumor got around that the game was over. So
everyone went home, tuned in the radio and discovered that Pitt had lost, 24-12. Gloom! That's an
ugly word!
1941
       PITT    6............. 0 TECH
   Everyone expects a battle when Pitt and Tech have
 an athletic get-together, and the Panthers really got
 one when the two teams clashed at the Stadium. There
 were several schools of thought as to the outcome of
 the game. One group thought that Pitt would win by
 at least seven touchdowns. The other was more con servative and gave the Panthers only three. The Tartans
 thought a little differently, and the game almost ended
 in a scoreless tie. The day was saved though, when, in
 the last minutes of play, Pitt was able to eke out a one
 touchdown triumph, 6-0.
    PITT    7............. 9 NEBRASKA
  With no let-up even in the last minutes of the final
period, and with sophomore Jack Stetler giving the
first of his bang-up performances, Pitt and Nebraska
battle on. Two minutes to play, Pitt three points behind, and in the shadow of Nebraska's goal. Fourth
down-inches to go. Nebraska's defense stiffens. The
Pitt drive stops. Those all-important inches! Pitt loses
and fails to save the Cornhuskers the railroad fare to
a Stanford thrashing at the Rose Bowl.
   PITT 20............. 7 PENN           STATE
   Ted Konetsky and George Kracum come running out
of the.dressing room between two long queues of
cheering Pitt students for their last game in the stadium. It isn't long before the Pitt backfield, and
Big George go on two long touchdown jaunts. Not
even Penn State's potent "Pepper" Petrella could put
on enough pressure to prevent three provocative pigskin pushes by the Pitt Panthers.
       PITT   7............. 12       DUKE
  Way down South in Dixie on a late November afternoon, an in-and-out Pitt football team seeks its fourth
win of the year, in its annual battle with Duke. Duke
sneaks a touchdown over in the first period. Midway in
the second quarter, skitterbug Jack Stetler breaks
loose, and tears 78 yards, one of the longest runs from
scrimmage all year. Ernie Bonelli, too, turns in one of
the best games of his career, trying to overcome ihe
Blue Devils' second half lead, but the Panthers are
stopped a yard shy of the goal line, and they drop
another close one.

  The University of Pittsburgh's 1940-41
basketball season was unique, inasmuch as
Coach Carlson failed to produce a new system on which to run his team. Maybe it was
all for the best, because the boys seemed
to do allright without a fantastic new Carlsystem.
   With a record of 12 wins and only 5
losses, the all-senior starting team produced
the best season in six years. Blowing hot and
cold, the Panthers smashed some of the
country's best teams. Pitt reached the
heights when they dropped West Virginia
at the Stadium and Duke at Durham. Other
notable victories were scored over Wisconsin, Butler, and Penn State. Poorest nights
were when Waynesburg and Northwestern
defeated the Panthers.

Coach Olson
  The task of replacing the five crack graduating seniors from  last year's o u t d o o r
I.C.A.A.A.A. championship squad was the
toughest problem that confronted coaches
Carl Olson and James Potts when they began
the 1941 indoor season. But the rise of four
junior stars to top national ranking made their
work easier.
  Hap Stickel and "Bullet" Bill Carter drew
headlines as famous sprinters all over the country. Carter tied the world record of 6.1 seconds for the 60-yard dash in the Butler relays.
Stickel whipped the famed Barney Ewell to win
the I.C.A.A.A.A. sprint title. The other two
Fridley, Jessup, Sulkowski
Tregoning, Larkin, Graf
Saunders, Alli3s, McCabe, Graham, Sterner, Olson, Brosky, Davis, Foote
who drew national acclaim were Red Jessup
and Dusty Rhoades, the pole vaulting twins.
Both of these boys consistently soared above
13 feet, reaching a ceiling of 13 feet 8 inches
in the Butler relays.
  Other outstanding performers were Del Anderson, Zeke Sterner, Joe Newman, Bud Graf,
Regis Larkin, and Larry Tregoning. As a team,
the Panthers tied for second in the
I.C.A.A.A.A. indoor and placed second in the
C.I.C. meet.

             Varsity Baseball
   Early last March, baseball coach Ralph Mitterling looked up and down the row of candidates standing in front of him, and breathed a
hopeful sigh for the first time in his three years
at the head of Pitt diamond squad. This sudden
optimism was prompted by the presence of an
experienced and talented team to face his stiff
1941 schedule.
   First there was Guy Guadagnino, a fine
catcher of two years experience. Also he
noticed a promising group of pitchers: Edgar
Jones, Bob Malloy, and Andy Johnson, all
hardened by tough campaigns in college or
sandlot ball.
   When the coach looked over his prospective
infield, he actually smiled. He could have a first
string corps with Bart Brown at first, Eddie
Straloski at second, John Vaiksnor at short
stop, and Ernie Bonelli at third base. He also
had some insurance in reserves Al Holbrook,
Lefty Baker, and Larry Katz.
   In the outfield, fleetfooted Al Bush, hardhitting Frank Goelz, and the widely talented
Jones, left him little to worry about. Certainly
the 1941 season provided the most promising
outlook since the renewal of baseball at Pitt,
and the Penn State Lion had reason to sharpen
its claws in preparation for a Panther invasion.

     Coach
           Starting his second year as coach, youthful
         Ben Grady found it necessary to rebuild en         tirely his 1940 swimming squad. The inexperi         enced Panther mermen started slowly, going
         through three meets without registering a win.
         However, a victory over Penn State ended this
         string of defeats, and later the improving Pitt
         swimmers surprised all by taking second in the
         E.S.C.A. championships. Dick Ames, Buzz Cos         grove, Joe Orloff, Al Samson, Bob Soles, and
         Joe Kaule did most of the point scoring during
         the campaign.

   Although the 14 victories and 16 defeats of
 the 1941 Panther marksmen seems to indicate
 a slightly sub season, this team again met and
 defeated many of the country's best rifle clubs.
   Besides dual matches with Drexel, Wiscon sin, N. Y. U., and Kansas State, the Panther
 sharpshooters also competed     with leading
 schools in the William Randolph Hearst Trophy
 matches, the National Association Rifle com petition, and the National Shoulder to Shoulder
 Match in Washington, D. C.
   Veteran Larry LaSpada led experts James
 Townsend and Gerald Haywood in a close race
 for high rifle of the team. Other good marks men were two crack shot newcomers, Bruno
 Cengia and Bill Shuck.

   Despite the loss of Joe Kristufek to the 1941
Pitt tennis team, the squad is looking forward
to a more successful season than that of last
spring. The return of an experienced foursome: Ed Goehring, Francis Harmuth, Frank
Gaenger, and Bob Nickeson makes an improved record quite possible. With the addition of valuable sophomore talent, the tennis
enthusiasts will find the 1941 team capable of
upholding a fine Pitt tradition on the court.
                  Kramer, Rees, Glenn, Seybold, Simpson
  With three lettermen from the 1940 golf
team returning to the links, coach Art Snyder
anticipates a creditable showing during the
current season. Bill Kramer, Bob Seybold, and
Jim Rees make a formidable nucleus for any
opposition, and with the appearance of two or
three crack newcomers on the scene, the situation seems quite promising. Pitt is a definite
threat in collegiate golf circles this year.
Golf
Intramural Athletics
   A survey of the winners in the various Intra mural contests during the year just past, re veals that the titles were well distributed. One
 of the most surprising upsets of the Intramural
 sport season was the Independents' winning of
 the Intramural basketball championship over
 both the favored fraternity entry and the En gineers. In the volleyball race, Phi Gamma
 Delta squeezed through to the championship
 in the last week of the race. The Fijis also
 topped all opposition in the touch-football fes tivities. The Amity Club keglers took the bowl ing title by downing the Pi Lams in the season
 play-offs. A strong Sigma Alpha Mu squad won
 the badminton crown; the Delta Tau Deltas
 made it three in a row as they easily captured
 the Intramural table tennis title; to Phi Epsilon
 Pi went the honor of winning the first paddle
tennis championship in that sport's competitive debut.
Mitterling, Grady, Sheaffer, Josephs, Stiff

FOOTBALL
  While the Punks were easing into the Independent championship of Intramural touch
football, the Phi Gams had to battle all the way
for the top position in the Fraternity League.
Dr. Carlson's non-fraternity eleven proved their
all-round superiority by placing three boys, Mel
Port, "Lefty" Ziolkowski, and Sam Milanovich,
on the all-intramural mythical squad. The Fijis
were not rated much of a chance to win the
fraternity football crown in early season predictions. But, the Phi Gam boys came through,
and also had two of their players, Mike Mitchell
and Paul MacNeill, unanimously elected to the
all-intramural ranks.
              TABLE TENNIS
   For the third consecutive year, the men of
Delta Tau Delta captured the interfraternity
table tennis championship. In the last match of
the race, the Delt quartet, made up of Dan
Cannon, Bud Hawkins, Bill Kramer, and Jim
Klein shut out Sigma Alpha Mu, who placed
second, and took the trophy. Dan Cannon,
completing four years of competition, proved
himself the outstanding player on the campus.
               VOLLEYBALL
   By sweeping through three straight games in
the final match of the season, Phi Gamma
Delta nosed out Pi Kappa Alpha for the intramural volleyball chaimpionship. Competition
was keen throughout the race as the Phi Gams
and Pi.K.A.'s battled neck and neck, the
Pi.K.A.'s finally settling for second place. Outstanding for the champions were Al Holbrook,
Stoney Bitner, Bill Colvin, Mike Mitchell, Earl
Pressel, and Joe Roberts.

PADDLE TENNIS
   With paddle tennis making its debut in the
 intramural program, the two-man team from
 Phi Epsilon Pi, southpaws Wally Hirsch and
 Jimmy Deutelbaum, swept through the fra ternity ranks to emerge as champions. Bob Fer ris and Bob Black of Phi Delta Theta, second
 place winners, menaced the Phi Eps, but Hirsch
 and Deutelbaum finished out the race with a
 record of thirty-three victories in thirty-six
 games to easily top their rivals from Dithridge
 Street.
                BASKETBALL
   Comparatively unheard of at the start of
 the race, the Independents achieved real
 recognition by emerging victorious over both
 the Electricals and the Interfraternity cham pions, Sigma Alpha Mu, to win the all-intra mural basketball championship. In the final
 game of the season the independents nosed
 out the Electricals, previous conquerers of the
 Sammies. Footballers Edgar Jones, Ralph Fife,
 and Bill Dutton starred for the champions while
 Rudy Tratar and all-intramural Hack White
 paced the Electricals and Sammies, respec tively.
                BOWLING
   By exhibiting championship form during the
entire race, the Amity Club keglers captured
their second consecutive intramural bowling
crown, when the Pi Lambda Phi bowlers, interfraternity champions, lost two straight games
during the playoffs. Emil DeLeo, Jack Henning,
Al Norbut, Ed Murphy, and Frank Franchini,
composed the Amity quintet. Burt Engelsburg
stood out for the Pi Lams. The remaining members of the fraternity champions' team included Lenny Wolk, Al Gross, Hershey Mattes,
and Norm Feinberg.

  Once a month they meet -for dinner in
Heinz House, where led by president Doris

man, may suggest cookouts, bowling or
swimming parties, or a treasure hunt. Or, on
the more serious side, the members may discuss lectures given by the department on all
phases of hygiene.
   Their big night on campus is Recognition
 Night, during which the club honors out standing senior men and women. The week
 the local group played host to other college
 clubs at the State convention saw Mary
 Hilda Fagan busy decorating Hotel Web ster Hall and Adele Yorio planning the en tertainment.
 Although the club, composed of all physi cal education majors, has the serious pur pose of advancing professionalism in physi cal education, affairs just for fun hold a
favored spot on its program. An outstanding party was the one on October 2 which
introduced the freshmen to the organization.

  "A sport for every woman!" That's the
motto of Women's Athletic Association.
And this year, the organization has outdone
itself in trying to live up to this goal. Tournaments in which the members compete with
each other for letters, intramurals in which                      j
they vie with Tech, P. C. W., and Duquesne,
and sports just for the love of it are only a
part of the extensive program. Bowling and
basketball enthusiasts, under chairmen Harriet Harris and Mary Hilda Fagan, compete
in tournaments; swimming champions-to-be
hold swimming parties in Trees Gym pool,
under the chairmanship of Virginia Nedetsky; and girls who want to learn an easy way
to rhythm and grace trek up to the modern                       Informal Parties
dancing classes headed by Bernice Keuhner
in a special studio on the 32nd floor. Peggy
Bibza will instruct anyone who is interested
in badminton; Ruth Yardumian will teach
archery; and tennis groups are under the
chairmanship of Vivian Schang.
   Members of the organization are often
invited to "Sports Days" at other colleges,
including Penn State and California State
Teachers College. Health Weeks, under the
direction of Dr. Auleen M. Jamison, are held
several times through the year. A Posture
Clinic, arranged by Ruth Steeb, was one
project sponsored by the members.
  Working hand in hand with W. A. A. is
the Outing Club which sponsors two outings
a year at the Y.W.C.A. camp at Camp Pitt.
In the midst of such an elaborate program,
the social angle is not entirely forgotten.
Square dances and a hillbilly orchestra featured the Thanksgiving Barn Dance, led by
Ruth Sample; there was also a Yuletide
Feast, which Harriet Harris arranged, a
George Washington Party directed by
Midge Anderson; and picnics at South Park.
The most important event of the social season was the "Bal Mystique," a formal dance
which served as an occasion to welcome
Freshmen early in the Fall.

Women's Sports
  Women's sports at Pitt lay emphasis on
"broad participation." Consequently, there
are no varsity or school teams since this would
of necessity limit the members. Believing that
most of the girls are interested in playing for
recreation and not for learning highly skilled
methods of teaching the sports, Dr. Elizabeth
Rearick, head of the department of Women's
physical education, has divided the program
into two classifications. The freshman service
classes provide an opportunity for freshman
women to participate in sports. All action outside of classwork is related to the major program and works directly with W.A.A. The two
organizations are so closely co-ordinated that
there is no real dividing line between them.
Members of the W.A.A. have charge of tennis, archery, bowling, badminton, riding, modBadminton                      Tennis                          Ping Pong

ern dancing, volleyball, and basketball. They
do the planning themselves under the supervision of the Physical Education department.
This year began the co-recreation hour which
has become very popular. During posted hours,
men and women of the University may participate in sports together.
  Playing not for tournaments but just for the
fun of it, they have thoroughly enjoyed the
games of badminton, ping-pong, shuffle board,
archery and lawn bowling. With our new facilities here at the Cathedral gym, there have
been a greater number of participants both
in classwork and in the intramural program
this year than in any other year.

       "May I present Betty Dils." With this intro     duction the members of the freshman class
     were introduced to the officers of Panhellenic
     Council and the women's fraternity commit     tee. From the receiving line, the freshmen and
     their mentors wandered from group to group,
     meeting the fraternity women and faculty ad     visors. Meeting the representatives of the four     teen groups wasn't half so frightening as the
     freshmen had supposed for Mary Hilda Fagan
     made them feel right at home. The hum of
                                                                                 Betty Dils
     voices mingled with that of the soft music as
     the girls were met by Christine Allan and her
     aides, serving refreshments. After visiting and
     chattering for the better part of an hour, the
     freshmen said good-night.

     There are no blank pages in the 1941 memory
   book of the Alpha Delta Pi's for this year was
   crowded with events. The social season was off to a
   start with a real, old-fashioned hay-ride which the
   actives held for the pledges. Dorothy Segelhorst
   arranged the affair. The pledges, in turn feted the
   actives with a pajama party early in December at
   which Dolores Moser planned the program and
   served the refreshments. In the spring, all the girls
   received invitations to "let down their hair" at an
   Adagio Party. After this rough and tumble affair,
   the A.D.Pi's went into quite a different mood as
   they donned their most glamorous gowns for the
   spring formal. On the more solemn side, they had a
   Founder's Day celebration at the College Club and
   a Patronesses Dinner at their apartment in the Belle   field Dwellings. In June, most of the members at   tended the national convention which this year was
   held in Hot Springs, Virginia.

Alpha Epsilon Phi
   A local service project of the neophytes of
Alpha Epsilon Phi under Dean Evy Green has
kept them busy this past year. They sponsored
a program to financially aid unusually gifted
public school children and give them opportunity to continue their artisitic talents at a Pittsburgh institution. To raise money for this project Selma Shapiro and her committee planned
a scholarship bridge at the Hotel Schenley on
April 20.
   When returning from a mid-semester vacation in Florida, Sally Pittler, Bea Sheffler, and
Reva Rosenberg brought home a dinner bell
which now graces the dining room of the A.E.
Phi apartment in the Bellefield Dwellings. This,
along with a radio-victrola set won in a popular contest, new rugs, and draperies helped
make the apartment complete.
   In celebrating the twenty-first year of Nu
chapter on campus, national dean Gertrude
Friedland Markel entertained the girls at the
Founder's Day Banquet by comparing the beginning in 1920 with present-day activities.

         In September, Beta Sigs donned aprons to get
       their new Morewood Avenue apartment in order
       under the directions of Olive Reitz, house manager.
       Anne Logue painted chairs, Molly Rossier hung
       drapes, and Joyce Hansen shined the Beta Sigma
       Omicron national scholarship cup. Finally, the apart       ment was finished and for the rest of the month the
       girls of the ruby and pink showed off the results of
       their domesticity at open houses.
         The sixth of December found Lois Howe and Ann
       Carr along with actives and alumnae shaking hay       seed from their hair at a barn dance in Clairton
       Park Lodge. Betty Kimberling acted as fun director.
       On December twelfth, Alpha Tau chapter cele       brated Founder's Day with an informal banquet at
       which Betty Jane MacQueen served as toastmis       tress.
         Chairman Johanna Chesnick with the Beta Sigs
       and their dates closed the season at the traditional
       starlight formal in May. Patsy Miller exclaimed
       about the moonlight, starlight, and soft music as she
       danced by, while the orchestra serenaded with                        Martha Jane Abercrombie
       "Loveiy to Look At."

   Chi Omega
     No that wasn't a whirlwind that just blew past!
   That was just the Chi O's in Italy Strain's new road   ster. And under the leadership of Murelle Russell
   the girls have kept going at a fast pace this past
   year.
     To supplement the special occasions, the Chi
   Omega's high-lighted each month by entertaining
   a faculty member at dinner and a round-table dis   cussion and they claim this program was not de   signed for "apple-polishing." Personnel chairman
   Rosemarye Bunting presented Mrs. Edna T. Batz
   speaking on "Personality" and rushing chairman
   Martha Belle Buchanan brought Miss Helen Poole
   Rush in to speak on "Rushing."
     Jane Middleton aided friendly relations between                  g       -
   sister and brother fraternity, Chi Omega and Kap   pa Sigma, with a formal dance at the Churchill Val   ley Country Club in December. After receiving
   wallets on which the fraternity seal was engraved,
   escorts nodded approvingly at the tune "That's
   What I Want For Christmas."                                                 Murelle Russel
     In keeping with the traditional myth in the frater   nity of the spring and fall Eleusian, the Chi O's cele   brated these two seasons with a fall tea and spring

  A new star and crescent sign lighted up the Tri
Delf chapter house on Bayard Street. And it was
here that an early fall luncheon started the round of
activities originating under Estella Stout's direction.
  After Hulda Tully and Joann Riddle decorated
the house in festive Christmas colors, Peg Patterson
and the other Tri-Delts entertained children from
the Home for the Friendless. D. J. Bailey dressed as
Santa Claus while Alice Day, Jean Daker, and Fran
Hughes helped him pass out gifts to everyone.
  The Traditional Pansy Breakfast after the Friday
night dance of Spring Festival Week was given by
new pledges for seniors. Beginning about seven
o'clock, pledges served and then gave their senior
big sisters a gift with the fraternity seal and a pansy
corsage. Mary Kate McMaster, Betty Toddle, and
the other seniors later bid farewell as active members of the chapter and joined the alumnae group.

Delta Phi Epsilon
   This year the D. Phi E. social book proudly displayed a new address and as soon as the housekeeping efforts of the sorors were up to A calibre,
their new home was introduced to the campus at an
open celebration. Later on, Adeline Applebaum led
a winter house dance and'tis said that iitterbug
Ann Burke really stole the show that night.
   Saturday night parties arranged by Minna Kamber and Frances Berez brought the D. Phi E.'s closer
together and proved successful.
   In January, Blanche Cousin was chairman of the
annual scholarship bridge at the Fort Pitt Hotel.
Profits from the affair went toward an award presented to the outstanding undergraduate nonfraternity woman.
  To celebrate the completion of exams, Matilda
Kamber led the couples at their spring formal at the
Pines. A purple and gold color scheme, symbolic of
the fraternity, was the theme for this last and favorite dance of the year.

  The super special Delta Zeta social program
opened with a formal at the Shannopin Country
Club. While president Ruth Roberts and Sally Siebert exclaimed over each other's gowns, their
escorts gazed wistfully at the dance floor. Finally,
the group divided into couples and the dance
began.
   Polly Watt and Christina Allan appreciated the
candy received from newly wed Mary Wilcox
Meyers, but they still looked lonesome for the third
member of their triumvirate.
   Festivities for the week-end of the Tech game
began with a pajama party at the house the night
before the game. By the time of the Saturday night
dance, Evelyn Westermann and Bobbie Birnie were
trying to hide the circles under their eyes.
   January 21, the Delta Zetas celebrated their
twenty-fifth anniversary on campus with a dinner at
the house. Betty Maits planned the affair which featured the rose, their floral symbol.
   Betty Jane Thatcher, Grace McCombs, and
 Betty Maits made attractive bridesmaids as they
 attended Kay Stoltz, last year's president down the
 middle aisle.
   In the midst of all this social life, the Delta Zetas
 found time to study, and were rewarded with the
 Panhellenic Scholarship Cup. The lamp is burning
 brighter than ever.

   Kappa Alpha Theta
     This year, Theta's began something which they
   hope will become a tradition. In memory of Nancy
   Hiles, last year's president, who died during the
   summer, a bronze plaque was placed in the chapter                                             i
   room. The name of each year's outstanding senior
   will be inscribed on the plaque. This year, several of
   the girls are eligible for this honor because of their
   activity in the fraternity. Ginny Vinnedge was chair   man of the fall pledge tea, the first social event of
   the season. Mary Lewis planned the entertainment
   for the fall initiates, and Margaret Gibson proved
   how much fun a scavenger hunt could be. When the
   district president of Kappa Alpha Theta visited the
   house, Rhoda Plummer and Rose Brennan honored
   her with a tea. During the Christmas vacation, ac   tives held a slumber party directed by Harriet Glas-                         Rhoda Plummer
   ser. Tish Hamilton was chairman of an informal
   dance and Kitty Koontz led the Spring Formal at
   the Field Club to close the social season.
                                                                 President.............. Rhoda  Plummer

          If there is a king of hearts around, you can bet
       some Kappa will capture him-for the K.K.G. girls
       can boast of more marriages and engagements than
       any other women's fraternity on campus. First Lady
       in the order is prexie Ruth Beachler Taano who was
       married last August. Gene Pyle and Beth Hughes
       are both wearing rings, and Jean Geib, now wear       ing "his" fraternity pin, will soon join the diamond
       ring rank. So it is entirely appropriate that the
       Kappa's presentation of "Good Housekeeping"
       won honorable mention in the Panhellenic sing con       test held in February. Also apropos of their new       found domesticity is the interest they all took in
       adding the maple furnished chapter room. To get
       practice in the "domestic arts," they held several
       social affairs. An open house began the whirl. Later,
       fraternity rivalry was forgotten as they feted the
       Thetas at a dance. Soon after,.the fathers were
       guests at a banquet planned by Sue Rigby and
       Nancy Sundstrom. A Kappa-Delt banquet for the
       faculty held at the Delt house highlighted the social                 Ruth Beachler Taano
       season. Gene Pyle was the Kappa chairman.

   Phi Mu
     Going dramatic, having weddings and moving
   into a new apartment are only a few of the activi   ties which have kept the Phi Mu's busy this past
   year, under president Betty Bailey.
     In April, the alumnae and actives presented a
   play, "The Ghost's Train" by Robert Allan Geen of
   Kilbuck fame at the Congress of Clubs. Jean Doehla
   promoted the sale of tickets from the active chap   ter while the alums headed the actual cast.
     Janet Collins was married in October with Mary
   Alma Olander acting as maid of honor and the rest
   of the chapter serving as hostesses at the tea and
   reception following the wedding.
     A bridge at Rosenbaum's in January for the ben   efit of the national scholarship fund was chaired by
   Mary Ellen Tritsch. Tea and cookies, cards and a
   clever program were enjoyed by everyone-ac   tives, alums, and members of the Mother's club.
     In keeping with the American custom of moving
   every May first, Phi Mu's took up a new residence
   at "The Gables" and the furniture, trophies and                             Betty Bailey
   what-nots from their former place soon made the
   apartment complete. Peggy Woodside and Gerry
   Steinacker cleaned, painted and worked very hard

THE
     Even before school started the Phi Sigs
   made it quite apparent that they were on the
   march. They were the first women's fraternity
   in the city to do volunteer work for the Red
   Cross by knitting and making surgical dress   ings. Starting this project last summer they
   continued with it throughout the year.
     During Christmas vacation, Leona Lieber   man, Marion Weiss, Tillie Helfgott, Jane Kan   del, and the Nydes twins took themselves off
   to St. Louis and the National Convention.
   Here, they welcomed three newly organized
   chapters. Here, too, Isabel Nydes accepted
   the impressive national efficiency cup for Iota
   chapter.
     Parents of active Phi Sigs also played a part
   in this year's program. In April, the Dad's were
   feted by their daughters with a Father's Steak
   Banquet at the Hotel Schenley. The mothers
   were not forgotten for a bit later they had
   flowers, poetry, speeches and -refreshments at
   the Mother's Day Luncheon. Gladys Silberman
   kept festivities going at the William Penn for
   this most successful of Phi Sig luncheons.

Theta Phi Alpha
   "It is better to give than to receive" was the
 motto of Theta Phi Alpha this year as they under took a number of philanthropic projects under the
 supervision of Mary Jane Firth.
   Their extensive local project was the Margaret
 Enright Memorial Fund scholarship which is given
 every Scholar's day to a deserving Sophomore
 woman for use in her iunior year.
   At Christmas time, Mary Lou Walters helped
collect dolls for the Catholic charities to give to
poor children. Mary Ruth Hosey and Rosemary Sullivan experienced real pleasure as aids in this service
project.
   T. P. A. enjoyed the Mardi Gras party sponsored
by the alumnae just before vacation. This traditional
affair saw the T.P.A. residence decorated in typical
Mardi Gras splendor with real open house hospitality, Southern baked ham, and colorful frivolity.
  Their social schedule included a winter and spring
formal at the William Penn, neat teamwork at the
Sadie Hawkins party, and riotous times at house
dances.
   Then back again to Chippewa, the T.P.A. cottage
on Chippewa Lake near Cleveland, where Alice
Lally, Mary Hilda Fagan, and Virginia Halen got
plenty of swimming, sun tan, and relaxation from
their strenous senior year.

   Last fall's harvest brought with it an altered
castle for the Zetas. Cobwebs, dust, sheet-covered
furniture, dangling strips of wallpaper, and the
writhing window entrance were inescapable at their
Haunted House Party, spirited by Midge Anderson. Julia Clemens' ghostly sound effects had everyone screaming in horror.
  The day of the Penn State game found the actives of Zeta Tau Alpha bickering with their sisters
and the Sigma Nu's from State. The girls enjoyed
brunch at the house and then left arm-in-arm to outcheer each other at the game.
   Fun and fellowship was caroled loud and long at
the Christmas winter formal at the University
Club. Martha Wandrisco made arrangements for
the orchestra, refreshments, and favors while Betty
Larson and Margie Winter greeted actives, alums,
and their dates.
   Dessert at the house before Panhel Ball prepared
by Betty Dils, Loisbell Pryor, and Betty Duffield
added to fraternity friendships and a perfect

  The only good precedent is a broken precedent, according
to IF Council, long proud of its independence and progressiveness. Meetings are not the perfunctory women's book-review
club type; representatives are not the lackadaisical, lame-duck
congressmen. Instead, they are conscientious, introducing proposals related to every phase of fraternity life. Motions are
made, discussed, passed, and so...
  An educational program, directed by Jack Stauff, was designed to eliminate the confusion of rushing and pledging.
The series of functions gained campus prominence when freshmen were entertained in early October. A tea dance in Webster Hall and a style clinic, featuring "Eskie's" latest toggery,
headed the program.
  To facilitate the cooperation of the pledges of the thirteen           Alvin Ludwig
groups comprising fraternity council proper, a pledge union
was organized. Objectives included improved faculty and
alumni relations, and higher social and scholastic standards. Progressive pledge dances were
among the first events on the group's calendar.
  One more step taken to strengthen the
Greeks' place in the sun was the conference
between Chancellor Bowman and the Council
concerning the ideal fraternity row. Members
were assured of the administration's interest in
a plan for construction of more adequate
housing facilities.

tributions for the Pittsburgh needy, the Greeks
combined frat songs with carols as a part of
the "sing and swing" of the Yuletide Festival.
The Hotel Schenley was the locale, Jimmy Joy
and company the band, Larry Katz, the chairman.
   February found fraternity men swamping
florists with orchid orders for Rudy Janata's
"sophisticated but gay" version of the IF Ball.
Harry James supplied the jive. "Best in years"
was the current comment.

   How to Win Friends and Influence People must
have been on the required reading list of every Delt
over the summer. Rushing Chairman Jack Stauff
started off the season with a new campus sigh, gathering no fewer than thirty-two pledges to the fold.
Rush week was a busy time with a fathers' smoker
and a stag barbecue at South Park. Prexy Bob Jones
proudly pointed out his ODK boys, Bob Shaw and
Dave Buente, introduced Bill Sheris, editor of the
Owl, and paraded the three varsity footballers, Bud
Hawkins, Bill Benghauser, and Jack Stahl before the
eyes of dazzled rushees. Sprinting at the finish with
a dinner-dance at St. Clair Country Club, they finished first in the race for new blood. The Delts added a reception for the faculty to their social calendar this year, with the Kappa Kappa Gammas lending a helping hand, to help break in their new
Recreation Room.

   With all the ceremony, pomp, and splendor of
the ancient rituals at the founding of the fraternity,
541 years ago at Bologna, the Kappa Sigma fellows
held pledge inductions at their Dithridge Street
house. Bull sessions around the Kappa Sig fireplace,
a banquet with all the fixings, and an informal
smoker added to the fellowship and fraternal background of the pledge night program. Then activity
went back in theme to 1400. Pictures and an alumni
lecturer recreated the original mystic initiation with
movies of old Bologna. To climax the evening, the
whole group, with the awed pledges in the center,
moved into the darkened chapter room. What went
on behind the doors is a secret to men outside of
Kappa Sigma, but the pledges boast that it is the
grandest ceremony on campus.

     Wally Renton will tell you that there's little that's
   philanthropic about Lambda Chi's Orphans' Day,
   that the fellows enjoy hosting for the kids, and that
   the occasion ranks top-place on the frat's social
   calendar.
     Normal procedure for the last three years has
   been to arrange with officials to call for the young
   charges early Saturday morning. Leading off with
   a brunch, thence to the Stadium, followed up by
   all the cocoa, cookies, candy, and Glenn Miller that
   they can consume.
     "This year," laughs Wally, "the kids swarmed the
   gameroom billiard cues, ping-pong racquets, Pet   tyiana, felt the wrath of boisterous youth." And the
   fellows loved it! George Bunder, Lew Lovell, Bill
   Wilson all romped and rollicked a la Katzenjammers.
     No coincidence is IF Council's adopting the idea,
   lock, stock, and barrel with Wally heading the proi   ect. No, indeed, credit goes where credit's due -

  Phi Delta Theta
   Bull sessions are bull sessions, and might be much
the same everywhere, but members of Phi Delta
Theta will tell you that their "democratic" bull sessions are unique. Perhaps because of the senior
leadership of Jim Smith, Jimmy Jacobs, Merge
Metzer; certainly  because everyone from    the
pledges to the chef have a part in them.
   Unique, these gatherings, however, because of
their usefulness. Herbert Nicholas started one, and
out of it grew the Interfraternity Pledge Council
which not only planned to honor outstanding
pledges with trophies, but also sponsored a progressive dance in February. From another bull session
emerged the Formal Triad dance, with Pitt's own
Sigma Chi's and Tech's Beta Theta Pi's joining the
Phi Delts at Webster Hall in the first interfraternity
affair of its kind in this district. Bull sessions are bull
sessions - but those of the Phi Delt's are not all
talk!

             Phi Epsilon Pi
    To Phi Epsilon Pi, hell week meant more than an
  opportunity for hazing, for both the house and the
  pledges benefitted from     the "tradition" which
  qualified the pledges for brotherhood. On the one
  hand, all the needed repairing and improving was
  done gratis from spring housecleaning to redecorat  ing the chapter house. On the other hand, the
  pledges were brought into closer unity with them  selves and with the brothers as they solved common
  hazards, not the least of which was the hell night                             Jay Silverberg
  "treasure hunt" which climaxed the four-day cere  mony.
     When, however, the pledges had completed their
  ordeals, they were able to take part in the Phi
  Epsilon Pi social program which highlighted a series
  of thematic dances beginning with a Nautical
  Pledge Dance in November, a barn dance, A New
  Year's Eve formal at the William Penn, and a Span  ish Dance at which professional dancers taught the

   One night in the F.J. game-room and you understand why cups and trophies glitter on every mantle,
every side table. The fellows, seniors and underclassmen, are athletically-minded all. Rudy Janata brings
his band home from a concert tour and, first thing,
reaches for a ping-pong paddle. Joe Roberts relaxes after one of his SFA executive meetings at the
billiard table. Walled with knotty pine, decorated
with pix of the alumni (some years ago, all twentytwo first string members of the Pitt and Purdue football squads were Phi Gam pin-wearers), the room
is easily the most popular in the house. Here, during
rush-week, house-dance, and meeting-night, FiJis,
dates, and friends recreate. Bobby Thurbon not
only stars on the gridiron, Al Holbrook is not only
at home with a slide-rule: practice at the Fiji tables
have made them formidable contenders for the
campus ping-pong championships.

     Forgetting studies, dates, and empty wallets, the
   Phi Kaps staged their annual stag party. Pool and
   table tennis kept the boys busy when they weren't
   being entertained with the gag-filled skits of Pitt
   Players' Bob Ryan, golfer Jack Glenn, and Druid
   Prexy Chuck Cusick. Impromptu wisecracks pro   vided almost as many laughs as the "actors." Cig   arettes and overstuffed chairs provided a com   fortable, smoke-filled atmosphere for the bull ses   sions where such serious problems as the relative                             John Hughes
   merits of LaMarr and Grable and Pitt's basketball
   chances in the N.C.A.A. tournament were dis   cussed. The brothers and pledges paused only long
   enough to consume scores of weiners and cokes. A
   sometimes harmonizing quartet in the corner led
   the boys in a tuneful rendition of "The Sweetheart
   of Phi Kappa,' as the fraternity brothers finally dis   persed for the night.

   December 18, 1940 will be recorded in the musical annals of Pi Kappa Alpha as one of the highlights of the year. For that night, the fraternity song
team harmonized its way into first place at the Interfraternity Sing and Swing. Coached by Tommy
Stephenson, author of several Cap and Gown hits,
the group sang "Down in Old Virginny," and the
''First Noel'' to win the cup.
  The Pi Kappa Alpha team was not a planned
organization; it developed out of the competitive
singing between pledges and brothers at house affairs. By the time the Sing came around, however,
tenors John Syka and Dick Fair, baritones Bob King
and Frank Mateer, and basses Carl Anderson, Lloyd
Carlson, Dan Mash and Stephenson had formed the
A Capella octette which won the competition.
They're proud of the fact that they won with their
own arrangement of a fraternity song.

         "PI LAM, if only thou couldst cook!"
     No reflection on the virility of PI LAM        pin   wearers is that oft-spoken remark of affection. For:
   undoubtedly some Pittite will leave the campus   famed dining hall to adjourn to the living room,
   light up his pipe, listen to the latest swing record   ings, and join in the bull session exclusively styled
   the  PI LAM     way.'Even    the  pledges   radiate

   to the chef, Sully Loeb's dimples, or Al Gross's

  Sigma Alpha Epsilon
   "Brother, have you got a tux," was the pertinent
question at the S.A.E. house this year. Collar buttons, cuff links, studs, and boutenniers suddenly
assumed major proportions as the dress parade began. Which all adds up to a formal dinner dance
held at the lion-guarded house on Bellefield Street.
After food, singing, and relaxation in the dining
room, the boys escorted their dates to the dance
floor to truck, trip, or tango as befitted the tempo
of an "allright" band. While "precision stroker"
Bob Lotz and "side pocket" Chuck Robinson took
over the billiard room and offered free lessons to
one and all of the non-dancers. Later, Dick Gardiner presided at the midnight ginger ale and cookie
feast. The S.A.E. brothers are willing to bet that
future pledges are, "going to get their old tuxedos
pressed, going to sew that button on their vest,
going to shine their shoes and look their best, cause
the formal dinner dances are really going to town."

     Among the activities of Sigma Alpha Mu frater  nity men, an enthusiastic and successful participa  tion in athletics played a significant role. Paced by
  Red Silverman and Lou Mendlow, defending cham  pions in the interfraternity mushball league, the
  S.A.M. team won its second consecutive first place
  trophy. Making certain that their house would not                    71
  fail to have a new trophy every season, Norman
  Sapolsky and Henry Nemrod won both the inter  fraternity and all-intramural badminton crowns dur  ing the fall season.
     The winter campaign found the Sammies leading
  the interfraternity  parade in basketball. Hack
  White, Morris Mayer, Harry Abramovitz, Bob Col  tin, and Melvin Frank swept through all opposition
  without a defeat in the major indoor sport. The suc  cess of these Sigma Alpha Mu star athletes was in  spired by the whole-hearted backing of non-playing

        Sigma Chi
   "The scholastic honor of Sigma Chi is at stake,
her IF ranking threatened by a dozen rivals," reported Chairman Jim Householder to his scholarship
committee. And so the study wizards planned a
campaign.
   It has paid dividends. The frat ranked consistently
among the three highest on campus in scholarship.
For six years it held first place in its national fraternity district, and last year was third in national
Sigma Chi ranking.
  The year before, the boys won the Interfraternity
Scholarship Trophy, the Province Scholarship Award,
and the Harvard Group Scholarship Trophy: three
ributes to their gray matter. That is the record.
   Nor is it a case of all study and no play. The Sig
Chi social calendar included a Father and Son Banquet, participation in the Fraternity Open House
after the Penn State game, and occasional house
dances.

After Office hours
Through the arches
A chat in the Early American Room
Theta Chi
     In obvious disregard of the dignify and sophisti  cation of the annual Theta Chi spring formal,
  brothers and pledges, mostly pledges, crawled in
  shorts and stiffly-starched formal shirts under beds,
  bureaus, and desks on their hands and knees. For on
  this of all nights, Al Ludwig and his studs had part  ed one from the other. Bill James became the man
  of the hour; he arose, clutching the elusive jewelry.
     The lost studs episode was already completely
  forgotten when actives and alumni arrived with
  their dates at the Churchill Country Club. After the
  formal dinner, Al Ludwig, retiring president, re  viewed the year's progress and expressed the good
  wishes of graduating Theta Chis to his successor,
  Harold Oaks. Then the executive board presented a
  gold key to that freshman whom they considered
  the most outstanding of his pledge class.
    As the music faded into the June evening, the
  fellows chatted quietly between dances of the close
  of another year in the life of Alpha Beta chapter.
  All too soon, the brothers waltzed to melodious
  "Stardust." The last goodbyes were exchanged and
  Theta Chi had disbanded for the vacation.

  On Monday, May 5, the circus came to
town complete with everything from a calliope and popcorn balls to a band concert
on the lawn. Spring Festival Week was officially open. Tuesday was packed full of lively events-a water carnival, a greased-pole
climb, a water battle, and a pie fight.
Wednesday was unique, featuring women's
sports and the Merry-Go-Round Matinee.
With Thursday afternoon came the interfraternity track meet at the stadium and
sideshows in Lilly Court. Friday, closing day,
classes were cancelled after third hour: tapping ceremonies, the sweepstakes, a circus
parade, then off to the Schenley for the
sports dance.

Hold that, Please!
There's the thing we are talking about. It's on
your face, in your eyes, overflowing in the sound
of your laughter. Maybe it's inspiration or hope
or faith; or all of them. We have caught glimpses
of what it can do. It can build motors to speed
trains across continents; turn air waves into music
and words; harness rays to comfort and heal the
sick; make lamps and refrigerators and vacuum
cleaners to help people live better. What it will
do tomorrow depends on you; hold it, please!

We Say
"Thanks, Very Much"
    There is little doubt that without the cooperation and wise suggestions of our
many friends in and out of the University this thirty-sixth volume of the Owl would
still be a conglomeration of photographs, rubber cement, galley-proofs, rejected
write-ups, and unpaid subscriptions. I should like to express the sincere gratitude and
appreciation of the staff of the 1941 Owl for those who have worked behind the scenes.

CHANCELLOR BOWMAN
   An energetic idealist, Chancellor Bowman be lieves in You perhaps more than anyone else.
   For You he has dedicated his life to the "high
 building" which, as he explains simply, represents
 on the outside what a man should be on the
 inside. The Chancellor believes in and works on
the principle that you are taught by your surroundings. Guided firmly by this belief, he has
yielded not a whit in his purpose of building the
kind of Cathedral of which he dreamed for you.
   The Chancellor is a dreamer with faith, with
 practicability, and with a saving humor. He is a
 man who goes simply about what he feels is his
 work in life and does it in his own way.
 We were happy when the Jugo slavian people gave him the Order
 of St. Sava II, medal for highest
 honors in the field of education,
 but we hardly need the symbol of
 outside approval to feel that we
 have at the University a great
 man.
Mr. RuFus Fitzgerald
  "The classroom comes first," says Mr. Fitzgerald, University Provost, "but along with
that we must have activities that develop
initiative, integrity, cooperation, and iudgment."
  This is the philosophy of Rufus H. Fitzgerald who carefully considers educational problems in his quiet office and solves them in
collaboration with the faculty.
  His principal interest is, and always will be,
the student. Alert and alive when he talks to
you, he remembers you well after only one
meeting. And he is always happiest when he
is building: building better facilities, building
a program of activities, but finally, and most
important, building the character of the individual student.
Dr. John Weber
  Stone and steel have long been a part of
Dr. John Weber's life. A mechanical engineer by profession, he has served the University in charge of the construction and
maintainance of the Cathedral. Amazing as
it may seem, Dr. Weber knows the location
and dimension of every stone in the Cathedral.
  Interested in student affairs but with little
chance to participate due to his specific
functions as secretary of the University anc
Board of Trustees, Dr. Weber has been of
service to the University as a student, en
gineering professor, head of the Engineerinc
department, and administrator since 1909
  Although his duties are many and exact
ing, he still finds time to be a sports enthusiast. He is an ardent football fan, bul
boxing runs a close second in his interest.

The Deans of the Schools
            DR. CHARLES S. TIPPETTS
  Genial Dr. Charles S. Tippetts became Dean of the
School of Business Administration in 1935, after leaving his post of economics professor at Buffalo University. Through his efforts, the Pitt Business Institute, an
organization for business students, was organized.
  Dr. Tippetts' principal interest is the student, and it
is his belief that the Biz Ad School trains young men
and women to understand the economic and business
world and leads them to a successful and socially useful
career.

    Respected as a leader in dental education, Dr.
  Edmund H. Friesell is one of the few faculty men who
  have been with the University for over twenty years.
  During that time he has developed the Dental School

 active in the Association of American School Super intendents.
   A native Californian, Dr. Jacobsen is interested in

 these duties he continued to keep his own schools run ning smoothly and chairmaned the American Institute
 of Mining and Metallurgical Engineers.

Dean Thyrsa W. Amos
    Dean of Women's Office
    Worried about grades or activities? Want a part-time
 position to make a little extra money? Or do you just need
 plain, old-fashioned advice? In any case, take your troubles
 to 1209 Cathedral.
   Here the First Lady of the Dean of Women's office sits
 ready to help solve your problems. The well-known, stately
 figure is present at most affairs and generally oversees the
 activities of all women at the University. Most often she
 can be found in her office interviewing students, making
 final arrangements for a traditional ceremony, or planning
 part of the Orientation
 program for women.
 Happiest when making
 others happy is dean of
 women Thyrsa W. Amos.
   Probably the biggest
activity woman on campus is the assistant to the
First Lady. Supervising
all extra-curricula activities, she acts as advisor
to Cwens, Mortar Board
and o t h e r honoraries.
Her life is one of interviewing students about
their own or their organ-                 Helen Poole Rush
     On Monday evening, May 5, Thyrsa W. Amos,
   dean of women, died after an extended illness.
     A great educator, a sympathetic friend and
   counselor of hundreds of students, and a moving
   influence in civic life has passed from the scene
   after twenty-two years of academic leadership at
   the University.
ization problems and attending committee meetings. Aiming to build a better life for Pitt women
is the work of assistant dean of women Miss
Helen Poole Rush.
   Women students who are undecided about
their vocation or worried about obtaining employment, find their best friend in the other
assistant dean. She also knows all about Pitt's
housing problems. To further Pitt women toward
a financial success is the endeavor of assistant
dean of women Mrs. Frances McLaughlin
Holland.
  Outside the private offices, are two trim
young girls who see that everything runs smoothly. They type, answer the phones, make appointments, and add to general efficiency. But more,
their friendly smiles are the first to greet you as
you enter the office-that's secretaries Jane Key
and Kay Sturm.
Mrs. Frances McLaughlin Holland
   Kay Sturm and Jane Key
      Dean of Men's OFFice
   809 is the open door to big events for every man from
the shyest greenhorn to the campus biggie. Here, sandwiched between the Tuck Shoppe and the "Owl" office is
the bustling Dean of Men's Office. Here, in the atmosphere
that gives a man the sense of belonging, quiet, soft-spoken
Dr. Vincent W. Lanfear presides as dean.
  To the dean's office, pervaded by the feeling of hospitality and hominess, the freshman brings his seeminglyserious problems, his nebulous plans, his high-sounding aims,
for here he is certain of a sympathetic hearing and kindly
advice.
  Assistants to the Dean are Mr. Theodore Biddle, Mr.
Robert Corley, and Mr. Edward Williams. Falling within the
scope of Mr. Biddle's activities are duties of interviewing
and selecting chairmen for the various social functions, seeing that dances run off smoothly, working with Cap and
Gowners and attending to the numberless other browwrinkling details connected with the directing of things
extra-curricular. The fraternity question is tackled, and capably so, by Mr. Corley. It is with his assistance that rushing,
house-parties, scholastic standing and the other little headaches of fraternal life are smoothed out. Through Mr. Williams, director of the men's employment service, new jobs
and part-time employment can be secured.
  And in these almost-too-masculine environs, Mrs. Ruth
Cubbison, Mrs. Able Dorfield and Miss Lorene Kessler add
the delicate feminine touch and, with their pleasantries and
business-like efficiency, make the office a favored place for
all students.

                                              and perhaps we may be excused for thinking of our faculty as a rare
                                              collection. Certainly we gain knowledge more easily sitting at the feet
                                              of the professors than we do by digging in musty tombs in the library;
                                              we usually find our teachers somewhat more lively than the Encyclopedia
                                              Brittannica. And somehow along with the bits of wisdom that we have
                                              gleaned from them, we always remember their personalities. We like

makes sense to our mundane minds even when he discusses artistic
abstractions.

member of the Publications Board, sometimes forgets radioactivity to
join in the "screwball" activity of the publications parties.

motherly without being sentimental.
   Dr. O. E. Jennings, head of the biology department and director

friendship of faculty and students alike.

                                                  has made college more than a place to                 Dr. Root
                                                  learn facts. Education is partly books and
                                                  study, and partly knowing people like them.

             Sixteen years ago, in a ceremony similar to that of a ninth century English corona           tion, the first Senior Queen at the University of Pittsburgh was crowned.
              Since then, each year a senior girl has been chosen for the royal reign of one year,
           the highest honor a senior girl may receive. Possessing "the ideals of fine womanhood,"
           she is selected by her classmates for superior character, beauty, personality, for main           taining a high academic standing, for participation in extracurricular activities, and for
           unselfish service to her university.
              To her, the senior girls pay tribute and see in her their own ideal of what a woman
           graduate of the University of Pittsburgh should be.
              The Omicron Delta Kappa Award is given annually to that senior who best repre           sents the type of man the University would like to call alumnus.
              The awardee is chosen by a special committee of O.D.K. members. Some are of the
            University's faculty; others are Pittsburgh alumni. Dr. Vincent W. Lanfear, dean of
            men, is chairman of the committee.
              The coveted award is made to a student who has consistently maintained a credit            able scholastic record, who possesses an affable personality, who has displayed evident
            leadership in extra-curricular activities.
              This type of man Delta circle of Omicron Delta Kappa and the University proudly cite
            for tribute, and for the highest of honors-the inscription of his name on a stone in the
            O.D.K. walk.
