    Symbolic of his mentality are the hands of man.
When the brute learned to use its hands, it became
man. And as we look at the hands of the professor, of
the artist, of the athlete, we see the man.. each reveals himself in his hands. His motions, his gestures
are expressions of himself.
    When man meets man, hands clasp; a story is
told in that meeting of two hands. They can touch
limp and cold or they can grip firm and warm.
    Footsteps sound beneath clasped hands... and
they tighten to seal the spirit of Pitt. The footsteps
crowd the arch of hands, for they are the steps of many
students bound by a common faith.

When entering med school students must equip
    themselves with their microscope for long
    hours of observation.
Medical students relax with cokes and a cigarette
    after a long lab class.
A medical student writes up a report of his microscope
    analysis.
Preserved specimens supply the med students with material
  for study.

      DEAN E. A. GILMORE
  Reorganizing the Law School terms to help
his students combine studies with the draft,               2._
and teaching in the'grand manner' of Justice
Holmes are both part of the program of the
University's Dean Eugene A. Gilmore. Two
years ago he came to Pitt with a background
of education and law which has been used
to maintain the high standing of the Law
School and to give his students friendly       I
counsel and help with their problems. Dr.
Gilmore was formerly president of the Uni-            i.
versity of Iowa, and he has been Secretary of                 f    t
Public Instruction and Acting Governor of
the Phillipine Islands. The author of numer-._ -_:,
ous legal and educational works and member          I A
of many organizations, he has kept a balance
between learning and the social graces.            DEAN GILMORE faces a serious problem in
                                                           Law School enrollment.

                                               DEAN    WILBER     I. NEWSTETTER
                                               Versatile head of the School of Social
                                             Sciences is developing a program for train                                             ing workers in government service. He says
                                             he has not yet found a substitute for his
                                             hobby in amateur radio, but the many
                                             miniature bridges he has constructed seem to
                                             show that his interests do run into other
                                             fields. Every summer he devotes his time to
                                             his boy's camp in Canada.
 DEAN NEWSTETTER: His field will be more
        prominent after the war.

HAL"
  Outstanding in their four year college life
for good character, honesty, leadership, and
hard work twenty students have earned for
themselves recognition in the OWL HALL
OF FAME. They know full well the meaning of Benjamin Franklin's bit of philosophy,
"Do not squander time, for that is the stuff
life is made of." Depriving themselves of
pleasures and good times, they have devotedly given more than what was demanded
of them. Each has made his life worth
while.
  Many students were considered by an
authoritative committee composed of three
faculty members, three Junior women, and
three Junior men before twenty students
were finally selected. We hope this honor
will be an added incentive to those who won
fame, and may they serve as models for
ambitious Freshmen.

    A short time ago, in 1938, we were full of hopes, full of promises, full of
ambitions. We were rosy cheeked smiling young men and women wearing
green pins and arm bands. We sang "Hail to Pitt" and the "Alma Mater."
We were eager and determined.
    As the semesters rolled on, they tumbled us into the swirl of college life.
The traditions of Pitt were our traditions. We studied hard, played wth activities, and were tapped to Cwens and Druids. For the next year and the
next, our life made us confident.
    With this confidence we entered our senior year. Then came that
December 7 and we were at war; the world that had encouraged us was
now hostile and indifferent. Many of us felt that all we had worked for these
years was for nothing.
    But was all our work for nothing... from the decay all about us don't
our opportunities and incentives increase? The tragedy of the times broadens the demands made upon us, for it will take brains and men with the
ability to use them to set this human society in order again. Perhaps we are
fortunate to be living in an age which gives us the opportunity for the fullest
use of our knowledge.
    We have not engaged in vain pursuits, neither have we lost opportunities nor have we wasted four years. The college life captured on the pages
of this Owl is not an end but a beginning of a new and greater life for us.
Ours will be a better tomorrow.

   The R. O. T. C. student holds in his hands the future welfare and
security of our country.
   Clean white hands that once took notes in class; shined brass
buckles, gripped a rifle stock, and whipped sabers from scabbards
will take on a new significance.  In their place will be waving hands
when the greetings and the hurrahs begin; hands that clasp those of
a girl in Friendship and love; hands that salute in respect for and loyalty to the nation.
   These will be strong knuckled hands that squeeze triggers; dig
trenches, and drive tanks and planes; hands that will string telephone
lines and twist barbed wire; hands that scribble hurried notes from
the battlefield. And they will be the hands that work alone in danger, the hands of men who fight courageously and look for no reward.

No one objects to binding an oflicer' sxword (/ith ribbons, but on the day of battle,
he will lear away the ornament and present the naked edge to the enemy.

Colonel Edward L. Kelly, P. M. S. &amp; T.
   Keystone of the arch of national defense is
the Reserve Officers Training Corps instituted
among colleges to train men for leadership in
peace and war.
  The   University's  Coast Artillery   unit,
founded in 1919, is the largest voluntary group
in the country. Students are admitted to
the Corps after passing a rigid physical examination. In the basic course a cadet attends
two classes and one drill period a week while
advanced students have five hours a week.
Upon graduating, these cadets become 2nd
lieutenants in the army reserve. Col. Edward
L. Kelly, a West Point graduate, heads the
Military  Department.     He is assisted by
Capt. Ramon Dougan of V. P. I. and by Pitt
graduates, Lieutenants William Havlak,'34;
Donald Campbell,'35; Howard Husband,'35;
and Capt. Merlin Wills,'27.
  Besides its present importance of providing
young officers, the R. O. T. C. develops habits
of discipline, leadership, and   a  spirit of
patriotism. And even if we have no more
wars, the training it offers is amply justified.

     Our army requires that its officers be men of the highest type. The officers
and soldiers of an army are expected to consecrate themselves to their country,
to subordinate their personalities, their rights, their privileges, and their opportunities to the good of the nation as a whole.
                                                           Gen. Douglas MacArthur.

To the hundreds of Pitt students and Faculty in the
armed forces maintaining a fight against all enemies to
preserve the principles, welfare, and independence of
the United States of America.
   CADETS...
         at Fort Monroe
  From regimental parades on the Cathedral
lawn, from dusty drills on Bubbles Field, from
home and     friends seventy-four  advanced
R. O. T. C. cadets parked their army foot lockers and set out for six weeks of camp life at
Fort Monroe, Virginia.
  In a sandy camp sprayed by the salt air of
the Chesapeake, the future officers along with
cadets of five other universities received practical training in various phases of the Coast
Artillery branch. However, camp life was
not all firing of 12 inch guns, for there were
dances, trips, swimming, athletic     meets,
movies-and KP duties as these pictures will
show. An experience they will all remember,
the Pitt Cadets came home feeling that an
officer's job is a life work of devotion to duty.
        Cadets were early taught "how to go through the ropes".
    At the end of the day, Brosky thinks it over.
   Windows were broken and houses rocked when this 12 in. gun
went into action agaWnst targets on the Chesepeake Bay.
Captain Wills gets an explanation of the fire from Charge of Quarters, Ed Klein.
"When I was in Wee Pants"-Williams
  and Schwartz in a friendly scrap.
Pitt men, Warne and Quick arrive at camp in time to see a fire break out.
One factor behind Battery A for having a neat looking
street was Sergeant McDonald who cracked down
   on the boys and made them pull weeds.
Pay day at camp meant also pay up. Pitt men line up for their last check
      as Bradley squares himself. Couldn't cut you out, McShane.
Finley, Brosky, and Schaper have a last glimpse of Fort Monroe as
       their steamer sails for Washington, D. C. and home.

  Generals of tomorrow-members of Scabbard and Blade are the men to watch in years
to come. Chosen from the cream of the advanced   R.O.T.C. corps, forty-five actives
carried the local chapter colors with correct
military bearing.
  Fall tapping brought ten men into the
organization, and fifteen more were added at
the Military Ball on March 20 amid brilliant
military background and solemn rite. Then
candidates became'cannon fodder' for the
actives during Hell Week, seven days under
heavy fire.

men fired a full round of activities. Introduction smokers, a memorable "come as you
are" party, and a strong fellowship began at
Camp Fort Monroe served to strengthen their
social and leadership qualities.
  Additional recognition came to the local
unit as a result of the inspection by the Corps
Area commander. Reports of the check-up,
given every two years, were'favorable'.

   Practice makes perfect, and the energetic
Pitt Rifles believe in no shortcuts to perfection. From     the sweltering   days of early
September, through the frost-nipped air of
January, to warm breezy May, the actives,
members, and candidates of this honorary
military fraternity practice several hours a
week on the Cathedral lawn for mastery of
close order drill. Selected candidates, who
must pass a rigid mental and drilling examination after having drilled at least one semester
are initiated during Hell Week... a sizzling
series of early morning drill, sentry duty,
mass singing, and late evening drill.

   Chairman Jack Foley and Betty Ann Crede,
wait on the steps for the opening number at the
Pitt Rifles' Dance, held in the Twentieth Century
Club.
                         Early comers at the dance were Howard
                     Walther and Bill Bardes. Anxious to dance, they
                     waste no time in checking their dates' wraps.
        Ever willing to exhibit their military skill,
     the Rifles staged a November drill for the
     spectators of the Pitt-Fordham game; a few
     days later they represented the entire R. O.
     T. C. at the annual Armistice Day parade.
     Parents night found them aiding in the cere     monies at the Cathedral.
        Not to be outdone socially, the Riflemen
     danced to the music of Owen Peiper at their
     annual Little Military Ball held at the 20th
     Century Club on December 12. Amid shiny
     brass and flashing blades on dark blue, the
     Coed-Captain and officers of the Rifles for
     the coming year were announced. An exhibi     tion of fancy gun drill concluded this "com     plete military success".
                        At the entrance, Sergeant Hardison distributes
                      favors to the girls.
                        George Chirigos introduces Betty Jane Case to
                     Doe Ferguson, who never misses a University dance.
Faculty Advisor, Lt. Husband, meets with actives and dates at intermission.
BAND
Over one hundred and twenty band members drill regularly to maintain their
rating as one of the finest bands in the East. Mr. Arthur and Captain
    Dougan deserve much of the credit for the band's fine showing.
  The autumn of 11941 brought to the University of Pittsburgh a new streamlined marching band that ranks with the finest in the
land. Vying    with  our football team    for
Saturday afternoon honors, the grenadier-clad
marching unit, 120 strong, thrilled spectators
with a show unique in style and precision.
  There were the "Anvil Chorus" for Purdue,
the huge compass arrow for Duke, and the
Piano Concerto for Penn State-all tops in
planning, that gave Pitt men broad recognition.   The annual trip    carried them   to
Michigan, the reward for all good horn players.
  To the seated student section the work of
the band seemed effortless. But to Captain
Dougan, drill master, and to Mr. Arthur, who
conceived the original plans, and his expert
staff of six arrangers, each afternoon presented
individual problems. As the head man expressed it, "Every note played on the field
was arranged for that particular occasion."
  Not to be outdone, the concert band toured
the East in the spring with New York City
their final stop. A trip to Pennsylvania
cities completed this phase of the year's work.
  Guy Wallace managed the band until called
to the colors. Siegal took over from there.
All in all, our boys in blue put on quite a
musical show.

    At the Military Ball three thousand people danced to the music of four
different bands in rooms that suggested the Army, the Navy, the Marines,
and Pitt R. O. T. C.... At intermission they saw Coach Olson tapped along
with eleven others to Scabbard and Blade.
    And at the dance, Chairman Dimel and Co-chairman Harris made known
their engagement. They saw the officers pin insignias on their coeds.... In
keeping with the tone of the dance, defense stamps were given as favors. The
girls kept their programs as momentoes.

  To a casual observer, the Pitt Camp
us on the one hand is materialistic; on
the other, it is picturesque. Away
from the smoky industries lining the
Pittsburgh  river banks, towers the
Cathedral of Learning in majestic splendor as "the central symbol of creativeness and of achievement in the Pittsburgh district". Concrete floors, walls
of Indiana limestone, and structural steel frames are only a partial description of
the campus. Pitt is more than all this.
  From the cultural viewpoint, the Cathedral stands as a romantic vision surrounded by a campus of colorful sights that is part of the natural beauty found
here.   The photographs were selected with this in mind.    We pass them   on
to you in hopes that they bear us out.
  Summer and Spring hold for us a special charm. The air is full of a thousand scents.  Our very life becomes luxury.  At our leisure, we lie on the grass

   Activities are the fingernail polish of the hands of the student
body.   This year, in spite of an accelerated schedule, they are as
bright as ever.  Deft hands, grasping pens and pounding typewriters,
were constantly busy throughout the school year. Calculating hands
figured budgets for dances and other activities. Ink smeared hands
made Owl, Panther, and News ready for publication. Trim hands
shuffled papers at executive meetings.  On the twelfth floor, Samovar faucets were opened, and tea cups filled by slender fingers.
   Second semester issued a new outlook with knit-a-mitt clubs and
Defense stamp drive. And so activities are still the active part of
the student hand---the greatest diversion from texts and lectures---
not only for those who go into them deeply, but for those who
wear a light pink shade.

  S.F.A. had a triple-header aim this yearto put S.F.A. committees to better administrative use, to plan projects in which all
students were included, and "to bring S.F.A.
into its own"-that is, to have S.F.A. actually
make decisions itself.
  Roy Ruane, president, later succeeded by
Ed Tait, attributed the organization's rise in
carrying out this huge assignment to the
splendid work of the various committees.
  Unusually successful this year were the
several Pep Assemblies planned by Ed Tablac
and his committee which aroused more school
spirit than had been seen on the campus for
some time. Working also in the'football
field' were co-chairmen John Hughes and
Harriet Harris and the Demonstration Block
Committee under the complete responsibility
of the athletic department for the first time
this season.
  The   Statistics Committee, headed    by
Thomas Grogan, compiled accurate student
survey data by conducting campus polls on
the problems of locker shortage, smoking in
the Red Tuck Shop, and dancing in Lilly
Court. This committee not only worked
along with the Texas Campus Poll, but also
opened its data to the various Pitt student
publications.  Interviewing applicants and
recommending the most dependable candidates for the chairmanship of class dances was
the job of Al McArdle and the Appointments
Committee. Bob    Lesko and the Parking
Committee studied the problems of providing
parking facilities for Pitt drivers; they also
worked with the Safety Committee in an attempt to eliminate school safety hazards.
[142 ]
                   Arrangements for the annual Tap Day
                 ceremonies were made by the Scholar's Day
                 Committee with Virginia Porter as chairman.
                 Gus Wilde headed the Constitution Revision
                 Committee, and Charles Cusick chairmanned
                 the Social Committee which certified the com                 pliance with S.F.A. social rules of all campus
                 organizations and sponsored Pitt's first Snow
                 Carnival, as well as Open House at Heinz
                 House.
                   The Book Drive Committee, with Ralph
                 Hines as chairman, proved an especially
                 active temporary committee. Its purpose
                 was to collect books to furnish a library for the
                 boys in camp. Also interested in the soldier
                 boys was the Letter Writing Committee co                 chairmanned by Mary Bowen and Ed Tait.
                   Looking over this long list of achievements
                 proves convincingly that 1941-42 has been a
                 most active and successful year for S.F.A.

this service of Men's Council. Hard working
Bill Rial was in charge of the Exchange this
year and produced one of the most successful
seasons ever enjoyed by this feature. The
success of the Book Exchange is essential to
the plans of Men's Council, for the proceeds
are used to finance the Men's Student Loan
Fund, another    Men's   Council sponsored
service.

HONOR COURT AND BOOK EXCHANGE
Kleissas greets incoming Freshmen
[ 145]
From the North entrance of the campus, students stroll down the 0. D K. walk lined with slender
    trees that lead to the Cathedral. The scenery at Pill is as varied as the students you meet.
      beneath the shade of a tree and the shadows of the Cathedral feeling as though
      we belong to the growing things about us. Those having class on the first floor
      listen to the birds chatter in the trees besides the windows. Spring on the cam      pus is gorgeous, romantic, and vibrant.
        Thousands of visitors come here each year to view the Cathedral, the Stephen
      Foster Memorial, Mellon Institute, and the Heinz Memorial Chapel in its beauty
      of material and workmanship.     No less important is the campus itself which
      inspires us to create and achieve, the source of the value of education and of life.

WOMEN'S SELF GOVERNMENT
                ASSOCIATION
   The Women's Self Government Association
of the University of Pittsburgh represents a
unique government organization among college campuses of the country. It is composed
of all women enrolled in the undergraduate
schools and is governed by a group selected
during spring elections.
  To unite all the women into an ideal friendship by having a well organized democratic
government is the aim of the Association.
Its purpose is so all-inclusive and highly
specialized that a great many standing committees are needed. To guide the freshmen
through their first difficult months the Social
Committee gives Freshmen mixer dances, The
Traditions  Committee    sponsors  Lantern
Night, and the Style Committee teaches
how coeds dress at Pitt. Jean Brink, the
president, inaugurated   a  series of  style
shows. These displays illustrated to the women
how to dress inexpensively but beautifully and
how to select a wardrobe that will be striking
for four years.
  Elizabeth Foster, Chief Justice, and the Senior
Court guide the elections on campus for
women's organizations. The Traditions Committee, with Betty Kalish as chairman, sponsored Interclass Sing Day, and the Scholastic
Honors Committee, under the guidance of
Helen Meyer, fostered student faculty conferences relative to graduate work. These are
but a few of the many projects undertaken
by the Women's Self Government Association.

  Chief Justice Libby Foster strikes her gavel
on the table in the twelfth floor conference
room at 3:30 every Tuesday, and the judicial
branch of the W.S.G.A. meets again. Libby
then asks Elinor Barbrow, scribe, to issue
invitations to the Fireside Chats which they
sponsored. At one of the early meetings
Libby announced, "This year we are to act
as hostesses at Dr. Bowman's Fireside Chats
each Thursday. Tonight we will make plans
to serve as clearing house for women's elections in the spring. And we must not forget
our annual dinner for Dr. Bowman in the
Twentieth Century Club. We have a busy
year ahead of us."  At this meeting Martha
Wandrisco defined to the group the rules
concerning freshman women-that the organization merely interprets the rules to the
freshmen   but never inflicts punishment.
Senior Court assists the women students and
advises them. With the completion of the
discussion the group adjourned to begin a full
and successful year.

  Enthusiastic members of the College Association met on the 8th floor under the supervision of Dr. Crouch, faculty advisor, to plan
for their coming social events. While Lois
Blotter telephoned the Schenley Hotel to
make reservation, and Bob Davis, President,
contacted the orchestra, Alice Lewis and
Harriet Harris debated whether or not the
Sadie Hawkins theme was too worn to use
for this dance. The Howdy Hop at the
Webster Hall, a tea dance on March 4, and
the dance on November 15 were only a few
of the social events on the C. A. calendar.
Because of the hotel strike, the Kick-Off
dance scheduled for October 3 was postponed
until November 15 and re-named the KickBack dance. This year the C. A.'s biggest
task was the reorganization of its constitution.
Deciding that the Association was too social
and that the constitution did not definitely
state the purpose and plans of the organization, the members broadened the program so
that each student in the college will feel that
he is a part of the association. One of the
new features of the association was the accumulation of all data concerning the army,
navy, and marine. It listed commissions open
to college graduates. This information was
collected by the C. A. cabinet members and
relayed to the students during special appointments.

DEMONSTRATION BLOCK
  Brilliant blue and gold capes over the
shoulders of some 600 student football fans
make Saturdays' games at the stadium a
colorful spectacle. Al Icardi, head cheerleader, calls over the P. A. system, "Blue tacks
turn gold to the field," and our student body
forms a Blue Devil for Duke University.
Harriet Harris, chairman of the Demonstration Block, dashes from section to section
clarifying directions and supervising displays.
Whether it was spelling out Ohio for Ohio
State or forming a bugle for Tech, the student
body was on its toes cooperating with the
cheerleaders, band, and directors.
  Before the football season was under way,
students had been urged to sign up with their
fraternity or campus organization section on
the ground floor of the Cathedral. But it was
on the field that they did their duty cheering
our boys on to victory and showing the true
Pitt spirit in every game-win or lose.
  This year for the first time the Demonstration Block was under the direction of the
Athletic  Department. Profiting   by  many
changes and original ideas, this year's block
was one of the best. Mr. Benjamin Grady,
faculty advisor, worked out clever yet simple
displays which he submitted to the chairman
and the cheerleaders. But it was the excellent
turn-out of students that made the Demonstration Block a success.

  All is not work with the gift of gab, as a
glimpse of the sixteenth floor antics of Men's
Debating Association will prove. Breezing
in and out of Dr. Lomas' office, wisecracking
or serious, one finds a close friendship bred
by sincere and honest discussion of world problems, and reaching a peak during the annual
debate banquet, held this year on April 9th.
  This year the opposition crumbled before
three irresistible forces-Seyler, Baldrige, and
Byer, who wrecked the hopes of many teams.
Led by these three, Men's Debating Association chalked up many achievements. On
their annual barnstorming trip they often appeared before audiences of 6,000 people--high
spots on this year's record were at Penn State,
and   Lexington, Kentucky.     This  Grand
National Assembly at Kentucky called five
Pitt men on a 400 mile jaunt.
  While the sophomores engaged in a tournament at Westminster, the upperclassmen continued their ambitious schedule with numerous
forums and discussions for women's clubs. In
December the varsity team handled a huge
debate conference of high school debaters
held at the Cathedral. Our debaters joined
in round table discussion of current questions,
fostering closer relations between the city
schools.

EVENING STUDENTS' ASSOCIATION
  To the hundreds of clerks, school teachers,
millworkers, stenographers, and   first-year
college students who enroll in the Evening
Classes of the University of Pittsburgh, the
Evening Students' Association serves as a
center for University spirit and co-operation.
This self-governing council, besides planning a
busy social program, has charge of publishing
the Pitt Evening News and tapping to the
numerous evening honorary fraternities.
  Inaugurating a year of friendship and activity, the E.S.A. held an Open House Party
on October 25. There, amid smooth dancing
in the Cathedral Gym and refreshments and
group singing in the Tuck Shop, old acquaintances were renewed and new friendships begun.
Functioning through Prexy Tom Schofield's
plan of naming co-chairmen for each affair,
the Association held a Thanksgiving frolic at
the Diamond Roller Rink. Beneath the blue
and white winter Carnival decorations of Cochairmen Betty Jenny and Charley McAdams
the evening students danced to the music of
Dale Sommer's Band. The support the Evening Student's Association receives from the
students evidences the popularity and esteem
it has among them.

year. The girls took   part in  the Intercollegiate Debate and Discussion Group which
is composed of delegates from the University
of Pittsburgh, P. C. W., Tech, and Duquesne
University. Members of this symposium discussed pertinent current problems such as
"What is the Role of the College Student in
the National Defense Program?"    Intercollegiate debates have been scheduled with
various colleges including Penn State, Washington  University, and  Randolph  Macon.

     groups for the Pan-American question, which
     was selected as the topic for a nation-wide
     collegiate contest. To carry out this varied
     program there have been dinners and meetings
     Tuesdays, at 12:30 with President Dorothy
     Weiner, Vice President Mary Sarantopoulos,
     Secretary Ann Hornbeck, and W.S.G.A. Rep     resentative Lois Neundorf. To their officers
     and to Miss Haun, their advisor, Women's
     Speech Association speaks, "May the Voice
     of the University Women continue in interest,
     enjoyment, and effectiveness."
[152 ]
Y. W. C. A.
  The program of the Y.W.C.A. during the
year 1941-42 fitted well with the present war
by emphasizing social service. Each committee in the Y had the opportunity to benefit
others in some fashion. The Knit-A-Mitt
club, led by Jennie Fedak, knitted mittens for
needy children. Eleanor Hallock's Personality Development Committee offered advice
on grooming to Pitt women through a series of
clinics. With desire to spread Pitt goodwill
abroad, the girls sold Christmas cards picturing  winter  scenes   of campus    buildings.
Through seminars, worship services, and retreats, Janet Lincoln and Dottie King gave
Pitt students an opportunity for worship and
for discussion of religious topics.
  Eileen Boyd's Public Affairs Committee
emphasized peace in its many forums and
panel discussions. Lois Miller's membership
committee planned dinners; Janet Steeb's
Freshman committee presented the inspiring
Caritas ceremony. At all of these affairs
Evelyn Clements, Chairman of the Social
Committee, acted as a gracious hostess and
helped create the friendly spirit for which the
Y is noted.
  In all of its activities the Y.W. was led by
Mrs. Batz, executive     secretary, Virginia
Porter, president, and   the other officers.
Through a spirit of service within the group,
Y.W.C.A. helped to foster Christian fellowship on Pitt campus.

  "We have something to offer everyone on
the Pitt campus". With these words Rudy
Holloman, genial president of the Young
Mens' Christian Association, aptly summed
up their year round goal.
  Before school was even under way in
September, the Y. M. C. A. was busily engaged
in planning Freshman Camp, now an established institution at Pitt. From social affairs
to religious discussions, retreats to Pitt Town
meetings, this largest activity on campus includes a concentrated program to fit the
student for all phases of life. Bill Hammaker,
popular executive secretary, with the help of
Herbert Pifer, advised and guided proceedings.
  Closer contact with Y. W. C. A., a task the
boys entered into with spirit, resulted in association nights once a month, a night of
speakers and general get-to-gether.
  And then, of course, the highlight of "Y"
fellowship occurred at the National Assembly
of Student Christian Associations at Oxford,
Ohio. Twenty Blue and Gold members attended the convention from December 27 to
January 3.
  Aggressive, friendly, evermoving Y. M. C. A.
can look back upon the past year as one of
high accomplishment.

THE OWL
EDITOR
JOHN BROSKY
   The Owl office was a pleasant place for the literati
to spend their afternoons through the first semester.
No one worried about deadlines didn't we have a
whole year to produce an All-American book? Plans
were made, revised, and made again but still remained in the blue print stage. Then the accelerated
program was introduced, and the staff members swung
into real action. In January and February the pressure
was on, and no one failed. Through March it was the
editor's turn and again it was an all-out effort. John
Brosky insisted on both speed and quality without
sacrifice of either one, and he got it.

  "Hey! Jack, I'm hungry. When are we
going to eat?" or "You got any copy paper?"
are natural queries in the Pitt News office.
Three days a week about one hundred students
work feverishly to put out the widest-read
publication on campus. Most recognizable of
the improvements this year was the change
from the two-sheet regular-size paper to the
four-sheet tabloid-size paper.

         THE PANTHER
BUSINESS MANAGER-EDWARD TAIT
  The business staff under capable Ed Tait
this year sold more ad space than any of their
predecessors in spite of the loss of much national advertising. Faced at the start with
an imposing deficit, they ended the year using
only black ink. Much credit is due to Al
Brunwasser, co-advertising  manager who
managed the active salesmen. Rising costs
hit hard, but close co-operation and plenty
of work account for the business staff's
excellent record.

  The elite of Pitt's singing groups is the
Heinz Chapel Choir under the direction of
Theodore M. Finney, Professor of Music.
The Choir's national reputation has necessitated high admittance qualifications for membership into this select group which practices
four times a week. Further proof of the
Choir's excellence is obtained in the itinerary
of the group's annual New York trip with
concerts at such places as Riverside Church
in New York City. Hundreds of people in
Pittsburgh have heard the Choir's music at
the weekly vesper services in Heinz Chapel
on Sunday afternoons. Another special feature of the Choir's work this year included the
musical expression of a pageant before Christmas vacation in the Commons Room. The
beauty of the music blended with the soaring
arches to create a true peace on earth.

their instruments to listen to a swing band.
At this time, three year veterans received

  Holding their reputation as one of the
finest male choruses in the country serves as
a challenge to the members of the Men's Glee
Club. The boys get a chance to prove their
rhythmic ability at their annual singing tour
which takes them through several states. In
preparation the personnel of the club attend
weeks of Professor Theodore Finney's vigorous
rehearsals. To "Pop" Finney goes the task
of blending sixty strong voices into one beautiful, clear tone. After President John Stuchell
and Business Manager John Fulton had completed all the necessary planning for a successful trip, this years organization traveled to
East Orange and Irvington, New Jersey, and
then on to New York City.
  Of course there is the yearly home concert
for the Glee Club. This year's concert contained a recreated colored church service with
negro spirituals as a feature.

  Curtain going up! Places everyone! Three
times this year our drama hopefuls heeded the
call of the footlights in celebrating the silver
anniversary of Pitt Players. If novelty is a
measure of accomplishment and entertainment, director Whitehill's selection of plays
proved quite successful.
  Things began buzzing early in the season
with Yellow Jacket, a Chinese fantasy; shifted
into high gear with Flight to the West; and
rang down the finale with The Women. As
usual, tryouts were thrown open to the entire
school and the final casts provided a more
than a rare sampling of Pitt talent.
   Behind the scenes of the finished play went
months of planning and reshaping. This task
belonged to the technical section of Pitt
Players while the business department highpressured tickets and publicized the shows.
  Between productions, activities such as the
Christmas pageant and the program with the
Heinz   Chapel Choir gave additional experience. The girls also did their part for
the boys in camp by presenting The Women
at Indiantown Gap. The annual banquet,
awarding of keys and Oscars, and farewell
handshakes darkened the Players' playhouse
for the season.

     THE YELLOW           JACKET
  The Pitt Players opened their 1941-42
season with the delightful Chinese fantasy,
The Yellow Jacket, by Hazelton and Benrimo.
In line with the Players' policy of producing
at least one experimental drama each year,
Mr. Whitehill chose this allegorical satire of
the Oriental theatre convention. Over makebelieve mountains, across imaginary rivers,
through mythical snow storms, Woo Hoo Git
(John Reid) made his way in search of his

lost heritage. Fantastic spiders did not daunt
him, nor were the temptations of beautiful
women in "the flowery paths of pleasant

The play was comparable to an Oriental
Our Town-Alexander Endy played the important role of Chorus, the stage manager and
commentator portrayed in the professional
theatre by Alexander Woolcott; and Paul
Schaugency was the comic, silent property
man, played by Harpo Marx in the summer
stock. The play was more than amusingly
novel, and the Players presented it admirably.

FLIGHT TO THE WEST
  With a roar of its powerful motors the transAtlantic airliner took off on its- flight from
Lisbon to Long Island carrying a load of
refugees, newspaper people, diplomats, and
foreign agents. Flight to the West was interesting in that all the action of the play took
place on board the plane. Elmer Rice's antiNazi propaganda thriller is a difficult assignment for any amateur group, but the Players
turned in a well-rounded, near-professional
performance. Betty Luck and Larry Morris
were cast as the just-married couple escaping
from persecution in Nazi Germany. Alexander
Endy with a convincing German accent gave
"a fine performance in the role of Dr. Walther,
"a symbol of the ruthless Nazi ideology.
Opposing him in many arguments of principles was Hiram Milton as Mr. Ingraham, an
author mirroring our democratic ideals. The
whole conflict of beliefs is summed up in Mr.
Ingraham's final speech, "... it is the struggle
of irrational sanity against rational madness..
and in the end irrational sanity will win".
  Pitt Players third production, The Women,
a three-act comedy written by Clare Booth,
brought to a close the 1941-42 season. Aside
from the novelty of its involving a large cast
of women (no male characters at all), it was
an entertaining panorama of our modern
metropolitan world from the feminine viewpoint.

Betty Sapp read her notes of suggestions for

for a party with O.D.K. in the spring. She
also read a letter from Mrs. William Skirble,

gave a five-minute speech on some important
business topic to the actives and the alumni
seated around the dinner table. As soon as
the last talk was given, the initiates were
treated to a fine dinner and then settled
down for an evening of fun and laughter.
  Beta Gamma Sigma is to the Business
Administration student what Pi Tau Phi is
to the College scholar, and each year approximately ten per cent of the senior class
is elected to membership. Also approximately two per cent of the junior class is tapped
every year, but Beta Gamma Sigma never
goes below a 2.2 scholastic average in selecting its members.

  This year was, without a doubt, one of the
most difficult in the 34-year old history of the
Cap and Gown Club. Theirs was the task
of maintaining the Cap and Gown spirit at
a time when there was no show. Because of
the accelerated program, the uncertain status
of men students, and financial problems, it
was deemed advisable to suspend the annual
Cap and Gown all-male production-probably
for the duration. Toward this end, Chuck
Sarber did his best to sustain the C. &amp;. G.
spirit while presiding at the frequent luncheon
meetings, but the best Cap and Gown morale
building was the big smoker held for all men
who were a part of the production last year.
Tapping of new members this year is uncertain-requirements may have to be lowered
because of the lack of material, but C. &amp;. G.
spirit will always be a part of some Pitt men.

You meet Ed Fisher and Kenny Garver who
are high quality-point men. Dr. Gray begins
an illuminating and inspirational talk, and a
new desire arises. You want to become a
member of Chi Rho Nu, Pitt's honorary premedical fraternity. You, too, want to watch
operations at the Montefiore Hospital just as
the active members do. You can and will
earn the 2.2 average necessary for eligibility.
Now, under its able leadership, Chi Rho Nu
is making new progress in strengthening its
ideals of friendship and scholarship among

the goal of better men in medicine.

  Order of Artus, the only national honorary
economics fraternity in the U. S., was founded
at the University of Pittsburgh in May, 1937.
One of the newer honoraries on campus, its
purpose is to enable its members to secure a
better understanding   of the fundamental
concepts of economics and to establish a more
just  regulation  of  economic   intercourse
through   the  education  of the   populace.
Periodic meetings are held at which some
current problem is explained by one who has
closely studied the subject, and this explanation is followed by an informal discussion
among the membership. This year there have
been presented at several meetings the phases
of the Canadian price control law, effects of
the fall coal strike, U. S. and its foreign trade
policy, and the recent price fixing bill. In
order to stimulate thought on various problems, beginning with this year, an annual
award will be given to the student submitting
an essay adjudged by a faculty committee as
the outstanding work presented.

Phi Eta Sigma to the fore as freshman men
watched the presentation of the annual plaque
award to John Fitzpatrick for earning the
highest scholastic average in his class during
his freshman year. Within a few weeks of
the assembly, freshmen again encountered
this honorary   scholastic fraternity at its
annual fall smoker at which time potential
tappees, as indicated by their intra-semester
reports, were acquainted with the activities
of Phi Eta Sigma and had an opportunity
to converse with the members. At the spring
tapping, which took place on Scholars Day,
approximately 5%   of the freshman class was
tapped.

  excelled in the courses during their fresh  man year.
    Phi Eta Sigma has as its purpose the de  velopment of scholarship and high ideals in

who have averaged 2.5 for at least five
semesters, Pi Tau Phi honors scholastic work
and helps to further acquaintances among
outstanding students.
  To give prospective members a chance to
view "life among the learned," the Pi Taus'
held a Hallowe'en party in the eighth floor
Tuck Shop. Though it was rumored that the
members might suddenly ramble into a philosophic discussion of Grecian Epicurianism,
or lightly discuss economic conditions affecting Pithecanthropus erectus both guests and
actives had a good time. The following
month six new members were tapped into the
select circle, bringing the membership up to

    twenty-five. At another monthly meeting
    an agent from the Federal Bureau of Investi    gation gave an interesting talk on the work of
    the department. The traditional Pi Tau open
    meetings had to be cancelled this year due to
    emergency scholastic conditions.
      In the field of extra-curricular activities, the
   boys and girls of Pi Tau also play a leading
   part: Helen Meyer and Virginia Porter are
   active in women's organizations and Ernest
   Cohn, Jack Belle and Hershel Markowitz
   support four honorary keys. However, all
   the Pi Tau Phi's might well be considered
   B. M. O. C.'s in a special sense-they repre   sent the Big Minds of the College.

Shuset, an assistant to the editor, and Jean
Thoms, features editor. Norma Lee Koelliker was features editor of the Panther while
Christine Grote and Alice Lewis shared the
role of features editor on the Owl.
  This year Xylon initiated something new
in the way of tapping members. In addition
to the annual spring tapping they introduced
a mid-year procedure. This was done by
printing the name of each tappee in consecutive issues of the Pitt News. The tappees
included Wilma Dobie, Miriam Horowitz,
Zelda Fuss, and Alara Russell. Marie McSwiggan, assistant to Robert X. Graham,
head of the University News Service, and
author of a new children's book, "The Snow
Treasure," just published by Dutton, was

Fraternity for Women. In direct contrast
to the old formal meetings of the past are
today's ultra   modern, "up-to-the-minute"
meetings held in the beautiful surroundings
of one of the nationality rooms. After the
routine business has been completed, the real
meeting, a pleasant and informal meeting,
begins. Authorities of various fields come in
to lecture and answer questions on current
happenings in the sciences.
  The aim of this group is to create an interest
among science majors toward further research
in their respective fields.
  At present Quax has twenty-two active
members and     one  honorary. It includes
majors in the fields of psychology, mathematics, biology, chemestry, geology, physics,
and engineering and brings to the campus,
in group meetings, women in science.

the activities of the students, the Dental I.F. Council works
to create a better understanding within the school, and
among the dental fraternity men. This group is composed
of two officers from each of the dental fraternities, meeting
monthly in each of the houses in turn. Bob Peters succeeded
Herbert Ressler who was president during the first semester.
    Beside pulling the strings which make frat socials move,
the Council is the administrative authority for the Dean
Friessell Cup. This cup which will remain permanently with
the fraternity which wins it three years in succession, is given
for competitive achievement in basketball, ping pong, bridge,
swimming, and bowling. It is a cherished prize indeed,

much to the affair. Psi Omega's Winter

  Eight-thirty every Monday night, President
Suto calls the meeting of Alpha Kappa Psi to
order in the chapter room in the Fort Pitt
Hotel. Because many of the members are
evening students, working in the city during
the day time, it is more convenient to meet
downtown and at a later hour than the other
fraternities.
  Alpha Kappa Psi is a national professional
fraternity in commerce. Membership is open
only to men in the School of Business Administration who maintain an average of 1.5 and
display superior qualities in the fields of
commerce, accounts, and finance.     In addition to the collegiate members, there are
eight faculty  members besides the other
alumni who have joined the faculty since
graduation.
  Once each month a speaker, an alumnus,
or faculty member, is invited to address the
fraternity on some topic of interest to students
in the School of Business Administration.
One of the most interesting of these talks was
delivered by Dean Lanfear at a rushing
smoker early in March. Through these talks
the boys not only become better informed,
but also better acquainted with the alumni
and men in the business world.
  In an attempt to promote scholarship the
fraternity annually awards the Alpha Kappa
Psi medallion to the junior with the highest
scholastic average in the School of Business
Administration; it also awards a one hundred
dollar scholarship to the most deserving evening student who has completed at least sixty
hours.

semester, a formal dance in January, a reunion
dance, and a dinner dance.
  This professional fraternity, one of the
largest in the School of Pharmacy, conducts
pharmaceutical research in all of the different
prescriptions to show its members the contents of the individual prescriptions. Like
true scientists, these students always strive
to increase their own knowledge and perhaps
benefit the profession to which they aspire.
And they are always on the alert to find new
means for broadening their scope of knowledge. They borrow the principles they learn
in the class room and their observations in
the laboratory and apply them to outside
projects. Quite often they conduct experiments at their meetings just for the fun of
working and observing. All of their actions
center around one thought, their chosen field.
  The Beta Kappa chapter was founded at
the University in 1913. It taps to its membership only men ranking in the upper third of
the School of Pharmacy.

  The Mu chapter of Alpha Zeta Omega,
national Pharmaceutical fraternity, is made
up of some of the best "mixers" of the future
pharmacists from the Boulevard of the Allies.
The A.Z.O.'s, who are firmly resolved to promote interest in the field of pharmacy and
raise the standards of the profession, discuss
new plans at their bi-monthly meetings held
at the Hotel Roosevelt. Standing foremost
among the fraternity's accomplishments is the
support of the Bernard Cohen Memorial Aid
Fund which helps any deserving Pharmacy
student in financial need. The fraternity is
also very proud of their faculty advisor, Dr.
David Levin, who was called to the army in
early February because of his work in perfecting a lotion for the cure of third degree
burns. The members presented him with a
portable radio as a farewell gift.
  The busy A.Z.O. social calendar this year
included a Pledge Dance, several dances to
celebrate holiday occasions, and the annual
spring formal dinner dance. In May the
brothers also plan to be hosts to the National
Chapter of Alpha Zeta Omega at the National
Convention to be held in Pittsburgh this
summer.

  As stated in the constitution of the Engineering and Mines Association the aims
of the cabinet are "to create a closer fellowship among Engineering and Mines students
of this University, to provide opportunities
for contact with professional and non-professional men, and to add to the social life
of the Engineering and Mines School". To
these ends, the present officers and members
of the Cabinet have dedicated themselves.
Fulfillment of all three purposes is attained
by sponsoring two smokers and two dances
annually which bring together for fun and
fellowship the technical students of the University. At present, the creation of an Engineering and Mines lounge where the students
can "take things easy" between classes is the
goal of the cabinet. A sinking fund for this
project was founded several years ago by a
farsighted cabinet and the present group
expect to see the start of actual work on the
lounge. The Association Cabinet is composed of one Senior and one Junior from each
of the engineering departments and is the
governing body of the Engineering school.

  Programs of the Industrial Engineering
seminar are designed to give the student
not only lectures in his field but also discussions which acquaint him with the
problems confronting the world today.
Outstanding speakers, among them many
leading industrialists, address the seminars and classroom meetings. Frequently
they hold seminars in industrial plants
and laboratories so that the students may

  This year, the Pi Tau Sigma chapters of
the University of Pittsburgh and the Carnegie Institute of Technology    cooperated
in holding their National convention here in
Pittsburgh.  The local chapters initiated
sixteen deserving Mechanical Engineers into
the fraternity and they were given a royal
welcome by the boys. A blue ribbon achievement of the season was the publication of
the first edition of the Stoker, the Mechanical
Engineering newspaper. For relaxation the
boys held bowling parties and topped off their
season with a Spring dance for members of
Pi Tau Sigma and their friends.
  Since Aeronautical and Mechanical Engineers are similar, they were combined in one
seminar for the first semester. The Seniors
and Juniors meet separately from the Sophomores and Freshmen. On the Engineers' social
calendar were the annual Senior picnic where
Seniors were bidden farewell and the Aeronautical and Mechanical Engineering program
held at Penn State last spring. Naturally
their touch football team came through as

is to bore deeper into the problems of the
petroleum industry and to cause more friendship to flow among the members of the oil
and gas department. To help create intimacy
and association among the fellows, a series of
smokers, dances, and picnics are held each
year. Several football and basketball teams
were organized by the association to participate in, intramural sports.
  This seminar of Petroleum Engineers and
Petroleum Geologists met every Thursday
during  the   semester to   hear prominent
speakers from industry discuss the problems
in the field of petroleum. The American

  "This year defense comes first" is the slogan
that was adopted by the Sigma Gamma
Epsilon Honorary Mining and Metallurgical
Fraternity this spring. Its members come
from the fields of mining, geology, metallurgy,
and petroleum engineering. In 1941-42 their
program was limited. Because of the war
situation and other difficulties the Sigma
Gamma Epsilon activities were suspended in
January for the rest of the year. The first
semester's program included several luncheon
meetings, one dinner meeting, and a pledge
dance in the fall. The annual Freshmen
award of associate membership status and
A.I.M.M.E. publication subscriptions, instituted this year, went to Gardner Robinson of
the  Geology   Department.    Then   S.G.E.
played true to its past reputation and dug

    The hands of the fraternity men join together and initiate a feeling that is
warm, that is the spirit of college. These hands grip one another with the
strength of men, for the owners of those hands are men. Across the campus
stretch the hands of the fraternity leaders to form a close association with the
school.
    In all their activities the fraternities revolve about the school. To work
with the University, to aid it to the extent of their abiliy is the prime aim of
fraternities. They bring about a close association between the administrative offices of the University and the student body.
    On campus the hand of the fraternity man is strong. It evidences itself
in printed words of the publications, in the gestures of the Pitt Player... it is
a capable and friendly hand.
Contribuling within her sphere oJ influence a moral, spiritual, and
social development, jraternities display pride in their achievements
through the many trophies, won in Interfraternity competition.

                                            Early last autumn fraternity women formally
                                        entertained the freshmen at the traditional reception.
                                        This reception, with its vases of beautiful flowers, and
                                        lovely hostesses, held in Stephen Foster Social Room,
                                        introduced the freshmen to the spirit of graciousness
                                        and dignity associated with the fraternities at Pitt.
                                        After a busy period of rushing came the Panhellenic

                                            Besides cooperation, the council fosters a com                                        petitive spirit between the groups on two occasions,
                                        the Interfraternity Sing and the Float Parade. The
                                        Sing, held on December 8, was a long awaited event in
                                        which Delta Delta Delta took first place and Theta
                                        Phi Alpha and Zeta Tau Alpha tied for second place.
                                        The Float Parade, coming when trees were budding
                                        and fur mittens had been discarded, was one of the

all talking excitedly as they walked toward
their apartment in the Bellefield Dwellings.
In one group Alice Lewis, the A. D. Pi corresponding secretary, member of the Pitt Players,
and staff member of the Pitt News, was listening to the other girls' opinions of their winter
formal which was held at the Jacktown Hotel
and was supplementing their information with
her own. Florence Hetherington, the A. D.
Pi who controls the strings on the money
bags, was explaining how the budget for the
dance was met.     In  another group Jane

the vice leader, and Sara Staude, the woman
who records the business and reads "the

  They tell us that the seventy-seven respectable families in the Bellefield Dwellings were
just getting used to a normal existence over
the summer when-bang! the vacation was
over, and all the Alpha Epsilon Phi's came
trooping back to their fourth floor apartment.
  When the twenty-first of October rolled
around, all the sophomore sisters got out their
pens and paper, sent notices to the alums,
and proceeded to hold a Founders' Day celebration. That was the first social function
of the year.
  After Founders' Day was over, activities
really started. For it was then that chairman Mildred Rosenfield presented plans for
the annual Scholarship bridge on November
9th. Nobody minded the work connected
with the affair because the bridge was a big
success.
   From the proceeds of the bridge Alpha
Epsilon Phi presented three summer session
scholarships-vocal, instrumental, and sculptural-to children selected through the Pittsburgh Board of Education.
   Orchids and pastel formals came next-the
Winter Formal. Then during the Christmas
vacation they all let down their hair for a
Pajama Party at the sorority apartment.
  Then came the important business of a
successful fall rushing season. Our National
Dean, Reba B. Cohen, graced this year's
rushing and made it particularly impressive.
  This year Alpha Epsilon Phi's at Pitt are
celebrating their "coming-of-age" birthday.
They are twenty-one and quite willing to put
in their vote-this time for a lovely-as-ever
Spring Formal at Westmoreland Country
Club.

the themes, and spring formals are their
specialties.
   In a more serious vein, the girls do much
research in order to choose the most outstanding American woman of the year. At a national tea the chosen woman receives an
award. This year they gave the award to
Carrie Chapman Catt. Chi Omegas are all
interested in personnel work.    They show
their enthusiasim in their activities and nurture it in their discussion. Maybe in the near
future some very fine personnel workers will
get their ideas fresh from a session at the Chi
Omega house.

  Delta Delta Delta placed first in the
annual Panhellenic Sing Contest with their
smooth harmony on the "Dream          Man",
"Banjo Song", and that catchy bit of syncopation, "Delta Indigo". Prexy      Charlotte
Harris, Vice President of Student Faculty
Association and R.O.T.C. Coed Colonel, led
the harmonizing of her sisters Janet Jenkins,
Margie Geer, Mary Elizabeth Murrell, Unit

  In  a  celebrating mood, Women's SelfGovernment Association President, Jean Brink,
Senior Class President and Heart Hop Chairman, Peg Patterson, and Pitt Players' feminine
leading lady Jeanine Stephenson helped the
Tri-Delts to carry the trophy to their Bigelow
Boulevard House.
  A vear of activities included luncheons with
faculty guests, novel and formal Saturday
night dances, hayride specials and the six
a. m. traditional Pansy Breakfast.
  Climaxing the year's events was a Spring
Formal at the Edgewood Country Club, led by
Red Cross Victory Dance Chairman Mabel
Moore where Virginia Glenn, Jean Daker
Dickinson, Gretchen Schutte, and Jane Black
bid adieu to their undergraduate days at Pitt.

  The D Phi E's sat knitting on a fine day in
January-but with their thoughts far from
Pearl Harbor. The knitting project which
they had undertaken in connection with the
local Red Cross had resulted in much more
than khaki socks and sweaters.
  The conversation inevitably ran to the
spring formal which would climax the week
of exams before graduation. Interrupting
this discussion, Minna Kamber declared, "As
chairman I feel we should have at least a
little discussion about Founders' Day even
though it isn't until March 17."
  "I second the motion," Divine chimed in,
"for this should by rights be the very biggest
event on our calendar since it is our 25th
anniversary.'
  "I think we should present ourselves with
a  silver loving  cup,"  suggested  Blanche
Cousin. "After all, 25 years makes us really
a great national institution."
   "The plan is this," continued Minna when
everyone had finally settled the importance of
the affair to her own satisfaction, "the program
we follow during the evening will be identical
with that of every other chapter throughout
the country. The events will even be timed."
  "But we don't have to stop our dance when
the other chapters call it quits, do we?" asked
Pearl Lichtner anxiously.
  "If you are sufficiently recovered from
Masquerade by then we might manage a
couple of extra hours, Pearl," Minna assured
her.
  "Oh, we D Phi E's are made of tougher stuff
than that. After all the masquerade is in
February. It only took me a week to recover from the convention in New York at
Christmas time and that ran four days without stopping."
   "Not to interrupt any profound discussions
or anything," said Frances Berez, "but if
someone would just help me finish up this last
bundle for Britain, we can all call it quits with
clear consciences."  "Heave ho, kids. It's
10:30. Let's go."

  A typical evening at the Delta Zeta house
is filled with confusion and fun. If we look
in on them, we might see Geri Rust and Helen
Meyer dancing to a rhumba record and Porter
looking on from the over-stuffed chair by
the window. Probably Helen Woolslayer and
Louise Kimmel will dash in from Choral
practice and join Eleanor McClain and Grace
Lyon who, with the help of Marjorie Martin,
are attempting some acappella harmony.
And we might hear Peggy Wolfe and Ruth
Becker by the fire-place recalling the Christmas Formal. Ruthie Yardumian and Harriett
Blair never fail to demonstrate correct volleyball technique with a pillow right in the
middle of the floor. Some one says, "I'm
starved. Let's have supper." And then there
is a scramble for the dining room. A calm
follows and they sing their own special grace.

  Monday afternoons at the Theta house
were quite festive this year. The afternoon
set aside for slumber and bull sessions was
transformed into a lively party by declaring
'open house'.   These were delightfully informal without chairman or planning. Tuck
Shoppees found it impossible to refuse an invitation to make themselves at home. Refreshments consisted only of cokes from a
shiny new coke machine and occasionally
potato chips.
  Rug cutting was the order with some
couples while other guests were content with
the inviting open fire in the chapter room.
But there were added attractions---a man
from a neighboring fraternity spent one whole
afternoon making caricatures of anyone who
would stand still long enough. The bridge
games were usually kept in check by president
Jane Anderson who has unexcelled talent in
this line.  The old stand-by    entertainers
would always come through-Betty Sapp with
her "Can't Get a Date", the trio, Jean Garland
doing her bit with the piano, and Nan Crawford's violin solo.
  The afternoons were ended by outbreaks of
songs. Thetas might well be proud of their
singing. They boast a number of good clear
voices, a wealth of lovely songs, and clever
arrangements by the group innovators, Vera
Daum    and  Peggy   Coulson.   The Kappa
Alpha Thetas never closed their door without
an invitation to return the next week.
  Leading all other activities this year, however, was the celebration of the 72nd birthday
of the founding of the fraternity. At a
luncheon at the P.A.A., Thetas young, and
old, far and near, were entertained by the
active chapter. Guests at the speakers table
received sterling silver pins in remembrance
of this great affair.

  Monday night is fraternity night on the
campus; meetings are meetings, but meetings
at the Kappa house, if they are all like this
one, are something. About 3:00 P. M. the
Kappa migration to 165 North Dithridge
begins. As the members begin to assemble,
bridge tables pop up, chatter becomes incessant, and the beautiful new vie, trophy
from this year's Phillip Morris contest, plays
the latest tunes in accompaniment. There is
an air of apprehension even though things
seem to appear normal. Betty Haldeman is
busy on W.S.G.A. reports, S.F.A. reports, and
similar data. Peggy Johns and Janet Elliot

          The regular dinner is replaced by a diet of
        vitamins. Just after dinner each Kappa sister
        is given a little hat-box containing an an        nouncement of the engagements of Nancy
        Sundstrom and Esther Undercoffler. Ice cream
        and cake and singing and laughter paint an
        appropriate picture of Kappas enjoying them        selves. Mary Lee and the executive com        mittee might just as well forget about the
        order of business for this evening.

  From the doorway of the rose and white
chapter room in the Phi Mu apartment
stepped Lois Remaley, social chairman, with
a cheerful "Hi, kids, come on in!" By two's
and three's the kids, Angie, Lois, Ruth, Peggy,
and Ida straggled in and sprawled over chairs
in friendly corners of the banner-bedecked
room where they held their weekly meetings.
"Did ya bring your knittin', Ann?" asked
Kappa Phi president Ruth Welke. Then a
discussion of "what all the girls are doing"
followed. "Gee, I had a swell time at the

           Mary Ellen Tritsch cuddled up in a blue arm           chair in the corner. "We sure did!" they all
           agreed. When they were all there, a voice
           rose above the chatter about the Christmas
           formal at the Jacktown     Hotel, knitting,
           monthly Phi Mu bowling parties, and Tuck
           Shop experiences. It was the voice of Jean
           Doehla, prexy, requesting that another meet           ing of the Phi Mu be in session. Soon Gerry
           Steinacker was rapidly scribbling notations
           into her minute book-notations that recorded
           a brilliant year filled with frolic and fellow           ship that a Phi Mu girl will always remember.

the installation of the newest Phi Sig chapter,
Beta Gamma. Under the capable chairmanship of Lillian Barris their annual Founders'
Day Banquet was held at the Royal York
Dining Room. Later in the season the Phi
Sigs again joined in the fun with a Winter
Dance at the Chatterbox. On another trip
Mildred Linden, prexy, Beatrice Feingold,
treasurer, and Rita Lerner spent a wonderful
week-end at Syracuse attending the Regional
Conference. Early in January the Phi Sigs

sponsored a defense bridge at the Hotel
Schenley. Parents weren't forgotten when
the mothers were entertained with a Mothers'

Banquet. Officially ending the activities of
the school year was the Spring Formal held
at the Westmoreland Country Club. Seniors
were bid farewell and awarded gifts as a
parting gesture.
   Phi Sigma Sigma really had a successful
 year. Activities and scholarship with lots of
 fun blended to make Phi Sigma Sigma one of
 the most active sororities on campus.

  The T.P.A.'s like to sit in the Tuck Shop,
one of the crossroads of Pitt. Sometimes,
when classes and activities permit, the booth
is overflowing with campus smoothies, B.W.
O.C.'s, and a myriad of smiling faces. Sometimes it almost looks as if an I. F. council
meeting were taking place. Geniality is the
keynote with the girls, and they are well
known for their wit and enthusiasm.
  President Mary Zarman picked from this
group many helpers for her Red Cross drive.
A diamond studded V might well be given
them for their support. Mary Rita Keenan
and some of the sisters are beginning to hide
from Eleanor Epping, for she's always selling
something, and she always gets the best results at this booth. Whether it be Junior
Prom tickets, Heart Hop tickets, or Xmas
seals... perseverance does the trick. Julia DeLeo finds plenty of use for her place on the
bench in getting the lowdown on S.F.A.
business. T.P.A.'s do forsake their booth
for their dances, teas, and chocolate hours.
  Almost as much business is handled here as at
the New York Stock Exchange. There are
plans for parties, cramming for tests, writing
of papers, sipping of cokes, and an occasional
political discussion. It is truly hard to find
a more active place than the Theta Phi Alpha
booth in the Tuck Shop.

  An over ambitious group of actives with
their mothers and alumnae were "thrilled with
excitement" when the Chi Chapter officially
opened the new Zeta Tau Alpha house on
February 22. The house is an object of great
pride to all the girls who worked on Saturdays
with scrub buckets and aprons. The mothers
made the draperies and curtains. Of the
new furniture added, the Baby Grand piano
was a surprise gift of the Mothers' Club.
Mrs. Geneve Clutter became the new house
mother.
  With this as an incentive, the ZTA's set
out creating creditable records scholastically
and in extracurricular activities. On a Monday afternoon groups of girls sat around
knitting, some were playing bridge, while
others indulged in talking. In one group
this year's head woman, Norma Jean Wilkes,
told of the treats of being a part time mother
to a group of Freshies. At a bridge table was
..........   ORLA LANG
       Grace Steele, the secretary. Along with the
       others she was listening to kibitizer and Vice
       President Norma Lee Koelliker explain why
       the next issue of the Panther, of which Norma
       Lee is campus editor, was to be better than
       ever before. Helen   Buente, president of
       Panhellenic Council discussed activities with
       Marty Wandrisco, Mortar Board sister and
       member of Senior Court. In another part of
       the room, Midge Anderson, Theatron Presi       dent, rehearsed her lines for "The Women"
       while Elaine Beiersdorfer, Nancy Hardy, and
       Martha Bolar considered tappees for Cwens.
       As the newly elected Treasurer of W.S.G.A.,
       Elaine manages to do her bit on the Sten       ography Staff of the Owl.
         House dances, parties, and Mother and
       Daughter banquets made up the year's social
       program. Thus, with enthusiasm and spirit,
       the ZTA's have come through to a smashing
       climax of a great year.

     For years now college men have sung about their coeds. The theme is
not a new one, but it is always fresh and vital in the eyes of the collegian. Each
era has its typical college girl; each school has its queens. Each year college
men think they have found something new in their coed.
     And we think we have our ideal girl here at Pitt... she is the Pitt Girl.
Our girl is not the slink-eyed sophisticate. She is the fresh American girl.
She is the girl who wears her cosmetics with the proper dash and seasons her
speech with intelligent phrases. She is the versatile girl who enjoys a good
football game as well as a dance.
    Printed words can hardly sketch her; pictures approach more closely a
true representation of her. We hope a combination of the two will convey
our meaning to you.
Who could resist a sales girl like this one?
Freshman women gather for a publications unit meeting.
Pretty girls, cool shade, soft grass, a radio-comfortable looking.
            the fellow in the background we mean.

  The twenty-four members of Interfraternity
Council met at the Phi Delta Theta house for
their regular monthly dinner meeting. Each
month the two representatives from each of
the twelve fraternities meet at one of the
different Greek Houses, and the Phi Delt
house was chosen for the October meeting.
After the dinner table had been cleared and
the boys had fully digested a delicious dinner,
President Richard Mansfield gaveled for order.
Minutes of the previous meeting having been
read by Secretary Harold Oaks, old business
was brought to the floor. After all points
were thoroughly discussed, new business was
then called for by President Mansfield. A
report from the Treasurer Mark Anderson
told the members of the financial status of
I.F. Council, and read the list of accounts
receivable and payable. Alex Zelenski, sports
chairman, reported that each house would
receive a schedule of athletic contests to be
held every week. Carl Stein, Vice-President,
and chairman of the executive council, reported that trophies for all of the major
sports and trophies for the "sing and swing"
had been ordered. Wendell Dietz, publicity
chairman, gave a brief report on rushing
before the meeting was adjourned.
  This year I, F. Council again awarded the
All-point trophy to Phi Gamma Delta. In
December the Greeks held their annual Yuletide Festival at the Hotel Schenley, with Al
McArdle as chairman. In      February, fraternity men danced to the music of Bob
Strong and his orchestra at the I. F. Ball,
held in the main ballroom of the Hotel
William Penn. This successful dance was
chairmanned by Sherman Jubelirer.

   In spite of conflicts and a jittery semester,
Delta Tau Delta found itself in an enviable
position as it ended a successful year as a
powerful influence on campus.
  Although the year was a critical one for
fraternities, the Delts speeded up its program
and   strengthened  its aims. The chapter
turned in the greatest number of books for
soldiers, gave the most money for crippled
children, and supported many campus affairs
a hundred per cent. Rushing season yielded
thirty-three men which led the campus for
the second consecutive year. The pledges
are very active having Ken Alexander named
outstanding pledge and Andy Patterson, President of Interfraternity Pledge Council.
  Varied extra-curricular interests have drawn
the Delts to most of the leading campus
activities. Jack Stauff, who served as editor
    Secretary.............. BILL BEERBOWER
    Corresponding Secretary........ BILL NEWBURY
...... WALT DICKINSON
       of the Panther and chairman of many leading
       committees, was selected as Senior Worthy;
       John Brosky, editor of the Owl, is a member
       of O.D.K. and captain of the cross-country
       team; Dave Naley was successor to Stauff on
       the Panther; Bill Benghauser, John Stahl and
       Jim Clowes were on the varsity football team
       with Bill Beerbower and Ed Cornelius as
       head managers; Howard Hanna was chair       man of Freshman Camp; and Bob Soles was
       a member of S.F.A. and the swimming team.
         On the Delt's calendar were numerous
       dances, sports, parties, dinners, Founders
       Day Banquet, Mothers' Club dinner, and a
       Faculty reception. Seniors graduating are
       Stauff, Brosky, Beerbower, Benghauser, Dick       inson, Hanna, Newbury, Sands, Stahl, Sven       son, and Swenson. These men know the
       meaning of fraternity.

  Phi Delts' rushing seasons are usually very
successful, and this year proved to be no
exception-the boys from Dithridge Street
pledged eighteen rushees. This successful
rushing can be attributed to the fine tactics
of President Bob Feightner, Vice President
Bob Crissman, and Pledge-master Ken Defoe.
  The boys opened their rushing affairs on
Monday evening with a smoker, which included movies and a performance by a
magician. On Tuesday evening, the boys had
Monte Carlo night; Wednesday evening's
feature attraction was a theatre party featuring the music of Jimmy Lunceford and his

orchestra.   Thursday   evening was sports
night, and Friday evening the boys journeyed
to South Park for a picnic. The concluding
affair was a very successful house dance on
Saturday night.
  Throughout the week the rushees were
entertained by varsity football players, Bob
Stodgell and Bob Crissman, and Roy Ruane,
President of S.F.A.
  When silence week was over and eighteen
rushees answered the Phi Delt call to fraternalism, the boys began laying plans for their
next rushing season.

  For the third consecutive year, the Phi
Gams were presented with the I.F. All-Point
trophy at the I.F. Ball. Athletic Chairman
Jim Warne, who received the trophy, expressed his appreciation to all of his brothers
who had helped to pave the way to victory.
In taking the trophy, the champs won a total
of five firsts, two seconds, and three thirds.
Their five firsts were gained in the track meet,
the swimming meet, the sweepstakes, paddle
tennis, and, for the fourth consecutive year,
volleyball. Along with these first places,
the boys took seconds in golf and speedball,

          and third positions in mushball, basketball,
          and table tennis.
            The Phi Gams did not confine their activ          ities to athletics, but did their best to make
          the school social affairs a huge success. Bill
          Clemmer, member of S.F.A., was chairman of
          the Junior Prom; and Al McCardle, who is
          also a member of S.F.A., acted as chairman
          of the Yuletide Festival. Dick Mansfield,
          president of I.F. Council and the Engineering
          school, and Bob Eckhardt, business manager
          of the I.F. Ball, also helped the Interfraternity
          Council throughout the year.

  Lambda Chi Alpha lost no time in supporting the Pitt football team as all of the brothers
gathered at the chapter house early on the
morning of the first football game of the
season to go en masse to the stadium. Before
leaving the house, after a typical Lambda
Chi bull session, the boys filled up with hot
chocolate and cookies. As soon as the last
cup of chocolate warmed them for the blustery
afternoon, the boys were off to the stadium.
No sooner at the stadium, and seated, than
they began to back the Panther by joining
in songs and cheers. Half-time found the
Lambda Chi's eating hotdogs and drinking
hot coffee and talking over the situation.

When the gun sounded ending the game, the
boys were so hoarse from yelling that they
decided to call it a day and rest their vocal
chords for the next game.
   Lambda Chi's didn't back only the football
 team, though. Every Pitt Player's show was
 well supported for Brother Bill Wilson, Presi dent and Business Manager of Players. It
 was culture and brawn both that appealed to
 them this year.
   Not to be omitted is their new chapter
 home, either. This year found the Lambda
 Chi Alpha's in a smart new home at the
 Fairfax Apartments.

  The Phi Eps think they really have something to put their thumbs in their vests about
this year. And looking back over the main
events, they seem to have done quite well.
  They opened the year with a tremendous
fall rushing and followed it up with quite a
favorable mid-year rush season. In fact the
Phi Eps pledged the second largest number
of men during the year.
  And they did their part in keeping up the
scholarship average for fraternity men. In
spite of the fact that they carried an abundance of credits, the boys managed to end up
in second place on fraternity row.
  In the whirl of social events the Phi Eps
were by no means slackers. Dick Barach's
excellent planning made their "Gay Nineties
Dance" the peak of the year. Mustached
actives waltzed their bustled dates from one
room to another. And the chapter kissed
the boys good-bye at a banquet and spring
formal for the seniors.
  Inevitable at every affair was Stan Barish
and his camera taking clever shots. From
last year's Owl photography editor, Stan
moved up to this year's managing editor.
And   sport   fans  relish in  sports editor
Zelenski's columns in the Pitt News.
  Just to prove that they are all-around boys
the Phi Eps took first place cups in interfraternity touch-football and ping pong. They
won first place cups for interfraternity and
intramural tennis, as well.

   "How do you stand in the draft?" was the
question of the year among fraternity men.
Several of the boys from the S.A.E. house
held low numbers-Prexy Bill Stormer and
George Smith first heeded the call of Uncle
Sam, and there is a disconcerting rumor
around the house that more men are going
to be getting up to the bugle instead of the
alarm clock in the near future. But in spite
of the draft, the S.A.E.'s are gathering no
moss as they roll along in activities. On
campus Bill Stormer heads Men's Council
and drum-major Bob Davis is President of
College Association. In Interfraternity bowling, ping pong, and volleyball the boys placed
well up in standings. To varsity athletics
the Sigs contributed footballers Walt West
and Bill Dillon, trackman Dick Wilt, and
baseball men Johnny Brown, Jimmy McCullough, and Dave Williams. But all activities aren't carried on outside the classroom and the fellows are justly proud of their
scholastic average. House dances are getting
more and more popular with the S.A.E.'s
and every other Saturday night, if you walk
up Bellefield Avenue you can hear Glenn Miller
or Tommy Dorsey swinging out.

  With final examinations a thing of the past,
the senior brothers of Phi Kappa donned their
formal clothes to join the underclassmen at
the annual Phi Kap spring formal. For on
this night, the graduating seniors were attending the final big social affair given in their
honor by the underclassmen at Chartiers
Heights Country Club. All during dinner,
Joe Connell, varsity football player and Tom
Lamb, member of S.F.A. reminisced with Bob
Tyberski and    Leonard   Fuchs over their
college days, while Smitty Charland and Al
Fall were busy discussing plans for the future.
After dinner was served and the plates taken
away, President Bob Cusick gave a farewell
message to the seniors, and then dismissed
the boys to do as they pleased for the evening.
With confetti, balloons, and banners flying all
over the ballroom, the brothers and pledges
danced until early in the morning, and then
after the last goodbyes were exchanged, the
seniors bid adieu to Phi Kappa.
[ 244 ]
  Examination time at the Pi Kappa Alpha
house finds a sudden change from activities
men who are usually engaged in athletics,
politics, and student publications to scholars
engaged in statistics, chemistry, and literature.
Looking in one room we find President Gus
Wilde, who devotes his spare time to swimming for the varsity, or else is leading a
discussion at S.F.A. meeting, taking time out
for an hour or two of cramming in preparation for exams to come. In the next room,
Ed Tait, President of S.F.A. and O.D.K. is
studying finance notes with Ben Foote, who
has just finished tucking away his plans for
Spring Festival Week. Jim Dimel, vice president of O.D.K., and cadet-colonel in the
R.O.T.C. is busy taking down notes for his
final exam before leaving for the army.
  Upperclassmen aren't the only ones cramming, because it is also the underclassmen's
grades which are taken into consideration for
the scholarship plaque; therefore it is no
wonder that examination time for the PiKA's
is serious business.

   "Out to the Ball--Back for Breakfast!"
   That's the sign the PiLams hang on their
doorknob every weekend. This year their
unique thematic house dances filled the gaps
between the big events of the University's
social calendar. What really kept them busy,
though, was helping their brothers make the
school dances successful. They started in
December when Gerald Isaacson was Business
Manager of the Yuletide Festival; and the
PiLam choristers brought more glory to the
house that night by carrying off runner-up
honors in the Interfraternity Sing.
  In January the boys tied their white ties
to help Business Manager Dietz put the
Junior Prom in the black-and brushed off
their tails again for Chairman Sherman Jubelirer's Pan-American I-F Ball in February.
  Of course PiLams didn't spend all their
time gadding about-they upheld their high
standards of scholarship, activities, and athletics. Permanent possession of the Interfraternity Scholarship Award was given to
the PiLams, who hung it opposite the scholarship award from their national fraternity.
Business Manager Julian Silverman kept the
Pitt News on the credit side of the ledger,
and Hillard Kreimer balanced the books of
both S.F.A. and the Owl. In other circles
on campus, Hillard sported an O.D.K. key,
and Rex Carl Stein served as Vice-President
ot Interfraternity Council. In athletics, the
PiLams conquered a double crown in Badminton this year, coming out on top in both
the Interfraternity and Intramural leagues as
well as several second places in other sports.

  Known for years as a scholastic fraternity,
the Sigma Chi's are equally as proud of their
social affairs, largest of which was their
winter formal which they held one week
before the Christmas vacation at the Longue
Vue Country Club. This annual affair joined
with the Phi Delts of Pitt and the Beta Theta
Pi's of Tech. These three fraternities, founded
together at the University of Miami, meet
each year in holding their "Miami Triad
Dance." The brothers danced to the music
of Rusty Williams and decorations displayed
the Coats of Arms of the three fraternities.
  This year the Sigma Chi's published their
own local publication, "The Smoky City
Sig", with Rudy Holloman, president of
Y.M.C.A., as editor. The boys also proved
their worth in athletics when they won the
I. F. bowling championship for Mark Anderson, prexy of the house and captain of the
bowling team.

  The premier of "Club Sammy" on the
evening of February 6, 1942, was attended-by
all brothers of Sigma Alpha Mu and their
guests. The chapter house on Neville Street
was decorated as a night club and a sign reading "Club Sammy" was hung out in front of
the house. There was a miniature bar in
the living room, and the bartender served
cokes and cookies to all; there were also
"slugs" for the many pinball machines which
were scattered throughout the house. Sandwiches were served at tables in the dining
room by a few of the pledges serving as
waiters. The evening ended in a blaze of
glory as chairman Sig Edelman closed "Club
Sammy" with the singing of "Fast and Firm",
the fraternity song of the Sammies as scrubwomen-pledges began to stack chairs on the
table a la Stork Club.

  It was "cooperation" this year in the Theta
Chi house. But this might be misleading,
because the cooperation was not entirely within the house. The major cooperative movement was with the T.P.A.'s. This cooperative
spirit was culminated in the Valentine Dance
at the house during rush week when the
T.P.A.'s entertained rushees and brothersyou can guess who fared the best. Brothers
Fitchko and Jones ably upheld Theta Chi on
the gridiron, and doubled on the hardwood
floor to bring the second place basketball
trophy into the house. Dances at the house
this year were many and not far between. A
dinner party after the Purdue game, a barn
dance in November, and a dinner dance for
the pledges in February are just a few of the
high spots of the social calendar of the year
for the Theta Chi boys. Bill Russell was
awarded the scholarship key, given each year
to the pledge with the highest scholarship
average. So it was dances, cooperation, and
more dances, with a bit of books wedged in
to finish another successful year for boys from
Dithridge Street.

  Debunking    all superstition   of number
thirteen, Alpha Phi Delta organized for boys
of Italian decent, was recognized on the Pitt
campus as the thirteenth fraternity. It was
first planned a year ago, but had to undergo
a period of probation, prescribed by Interfraternity Council, during which its members
had to show a certain amount of activity in
academic and extra-curricular work.
  Those members who formed the nucleus,
that today numbers twenty-two actives are:
Paul Cerchiara, Carmen F. Capone, John
Chaffo, George Sirianni, and Albert Ceravolo.
Alpha Phi Delta holds its business meetings
in one of the Cathedral rooms and takes part
in all academic, political, and athletic programs offered by the University. Its members
could very easily be the cross-section of
student life here at Pitt; they belong to
numerous honorary fraternities, varsity athletic teams, student publications, the Pitt
Band and numerous other non-academic activities. A. P. D. is not a new Greek letter
fraternity on campus. It appeared here about
six years ago, but due to financial difficulties
it was forced to bow out of the scene. The
boys have a well-rounded social calendar
which includes dances, picnics, smokers, and
other social affairs.

    Living is made worthwhile only by having an abundance of health and
a life full of happiness. Cheerful people with emotions that are strong and
bouyant make for good companionship and right thinking. And, in this
thought lies one of the chief aims of life: learning to live happily with others.
    All athletes know what this means, for in the great game of sports, one
is taught to lead, to follow, to cooperate. If a hundred hands were shown,
you would spot the short stumpy hands of a football player and say, he will
be able to stand up under criticism; you would point to the imbedded cinders
in the knuckles of a track man and say he will compete in a friendly rivalry
and be a good loser as well as a good winner; and you will spot hands that
grip baseball bats; hands that cut water; and hands that toss a basketball. In all you will know the men who have been taught to join wholeheartedly in living with others. These men who have bodies of perspective,
balance, and proportion are a justification and inspiration for the hope of all
ages.

THE CZECHOSLOVAK ROOM is decorated with a dark red Moravian frieze and a Slovak "Tree of Life" design
   painted to contrast with the white plaster walls. Ceiling portraits of outstanding leaders and a bronze relief
   of the President-Liberator emphasize the nation's strong personalities.
                       THE SYRIA-LEBANON SEMINAR has the ceiling imported from a seventeenth century house in Damascus.
                          Arabic designs, grilled windows, and deep cushioned benches give the atmosphere of the near East.
     Surrounding the Commons Room of the Cathedral
of Learning is found a new type of classroom-the nationality room. The nationality rooms, which were presented to the University of Pittsburgh by the racial
groups represented in Western Pennsylvania, interpret
and typify the cultures of the people who built them.
Taken together the nationality rooms represent what
the people of Western Pennsylvania want their children
to have in their hearts and mind. The first floor location
of the rooms has been deliberately chosen to symbolize
the fusing together of these cultures into the modern
American educational system      found in the Cathedral
of Learning. One must see these rooms to understand
how   this fusion is completed. Nowhere in the world

    When a team loses heavily through graduation,
the outlook for the following season will not be too
bright. When a team has a back-breaking schedule
without any open dates or breathers the prospects are
even worse. But when a team is faced with both these
problems, then the result is almost suicide.
    The University of Pittsburgh 1941 football team
had to overcome both these hurdles and consequently
finished their season with a somewhat expected poor
record. Defeats were handed the Panthers by Purdue,
Michigan, Minnesota, Duke, Ohio State, and Penn
State. On the opposite side of the ledger, the Pitt
team recorded the names of Nebraska, Fordham, and
Carnegie Tech.
     Outstanding for the Panthers were three seniors
each of whom won All-American recognition. These
included end Stanley Gervelis, guard Ralph Fife, and
left half back Edgar Jones. It was Jones' fine ball
carrying plus the aid of his team's defensive work that
enabled the Pitt eleven to turn in impressive wins
over both Fordham and Nebraska.

        PITT 0- MINNESOTA 39
  The third game of the season and still
Pitt had to score the first touchdown. Jones
and Stetler made several nice runs but to no
avail. The great Gopher team, probably the
best in country, was too much for Pitt's weak
defense. Led by Capt. Smith and Higgins,
the Gopher backfield men sieved through the
Pitt line. Meanwhile, the Gopher line checked every offensive effort of the Panthers.
                      PITT 7--DUKE 27
             Rated by football experts as the finest
           team  in the Southern conference, Coach
           Wallace Wade brought the finest offensive
           machine of his career to Pittsburgh to meet
           the already thrice beaten Panthers. Again
           the outcome was the same as that which
           had taken place for the past three weeks-a
           one-sided defeat.
             Duke presented two very fine backs in
           Steve Lach and Jap Davis both of whom
           have received All-American mention. Pitt
           showed signs of life though and managed to
           score its first touchdown of the season when
           fullback Johnny Ross scored on a short line
           plunge.

           PITT 14-OHIO STATE 21
  Victory! What a high sounding word and
what a happy ending to a football game. But
Pitt couldn't use the word or enjoy the result
for the simple reason that the Ohio State
Buckeyes came to town and promptly handed
the Blue and Gold their fifth straight setback.
  With "Special Delivery" Jones leading the
attack, the Panthers seemed to be quite an
improvement over last week, and at one time
even seemed to have a fair chance of winning.
The Panther bandsmen, too, were completely
overshadowed for the first time this year by a
smooth working Ohio State unit.
                      PITT 13-FORDHAM        0
              Thoroughly aroused by their five defeats and
            full of contempt for the high praise given the
            Fordham football team, Pitt scored the upset
            of the year by removing the Rams from the
            list of the nation's undefeated by a 13-0 score.
              For the second consecutive week, Pitt's sen            sational halfback, Edgar Jones, sparked the
            Panther's play with his fine running and de            fensive performance. It was Jones' pass inter            ception of Blumenstock's pass that clinched
            the game for Pitt.

      PENN STATE 31-PITT 7
  Smarting from their two consecutive
wins, the unpredictable Panthers lived up
to their reputation of uncertainty and
completely went to pieces before a concerted Penn State running and passing
attack. The Panthers gained one consolation from their defeat, however-the
privilege of making the first touchdown.
   PITT 27-CARNEGIE TECH 0
   Old Lady Luck continued to smile
down upon the Pitt eleven as they completely overwhelmed a hapless Carnegie
Tech team and marked up their third win
of the year. From the opening kickoff
until the final whistle, the Panthers
battered the undermanned Kiltie forward
wall and tallied touchdowns in somewhat
wholesale fashion.
         PITT 14--NEBRASKA 7
   With the football experts throughout the
country still stunned by the 13-0 upset of
Fordham, the Pitt Panthers moved        into
Lincoln, Nebraska, and met a potentially
strong Nebraska eleven. When the Pitt team
came to Lincoln, they had visions of registeriilg
their second win of the season, but it was not
until the final few minutes of play that that
vision came true.
  Trailing 7-0 at halftime, the Panthers came
back in the third quarter to tally and throw
the game into a deadlock. All indications
pointed to a 7-7 tie as the game went on, but
a certain Edgar Jones had different ideas.
The stellar Panther left halfback intercepted
a Nebraska pass and raced sixty-five yards
for the winning touchdown.

Coach Mitterling wonders: two on, two out, what a spot.
  This is baseball's senior year at Pitt; four
seasons ago the University included the sport
in its athletic program.
  The problem of replacements looms as a
large one for Coach Ralph Mitterling. Graduation cut heavily into last year's prize squad
which won nine of the twelve games played,
taking all but three of the regular members.
(Among those missing from the team will be
pitcher Bob Malloy who personally accounted
for six of the victories, and Eddie Straloski,
Ernie Bonelli, and Guy Guadagnino whose
.350 and better batting averages did much to
make up the Panther attack.)
  But even greater than the problem of replacements is that caused by the war and the
accelerated college program.    The annual
spring trip through the south has been cancelled. The possibility of extending the baseball season throughout the summer depends
entirely on being able to schedule other teams
and on having enough players attend the
extra session to make up a team. The Pitt
baseball picture has all the unsettled aspects
of a current affairs map, its only bright spot
being a group of exceptionally promising
sophomores.
A hit right now would mean a lot..

      Although they lost heavily through gradua    tion, the University of Pittsburgh swimming
    team presented a strong aggregation, one which
    was capable of meeting the best in country
    on an even basis.
      The Pitt team was completely reorganized
    as a result of the losses from the 1941 team
    and had to shift several key men around so as
    to attain the maximum strength. Heading
    the list of lettermen upon whom Pitt coach
    Ben Grady were Herb Cosgrove, Gus Wilde,
    Joseph Orloff, Martin Kramer, and Albert
    Samson.
      Among the early opponents of the Panther
    mermen were Rider College, Penn State, and
  With the coming of the 1942 season
the University tennis team looked forward
to many successes. Last year's squad,
with six victories against four defeats,
showed a strong, well balanced attack, and
most of its players are back this season.
However, the     draft may    force the
Panthers to use several newcomers in
their lineup. Trimble and Grance, each
with six singles and four double victories
to their credit in 1941 will return to form
the nucleus of the 1942 team. Aiding
these players will be Nickeson and Reese,
both with two years of experience behind
them.   Other   holdovers, Wynn     and
Jorden, will round out what promises to
be the most balanced Pitt team in recent
years. Included among the list of Pitt
opponents will be Navy. The Middies
will be back with the same team that
defeated the Panthers last season.            T

two, the Pitt swimmers turned in impressive
victories while against the Buckeyes from
Ohio State they met defeat.
  Outstanding for the Panthers this season
were three boys, each of whom is a specialist
in his field. Captain Herb Cosgrove handled
the breast stroke duties, junior Gus Wilde
managed the free style chores, and Joe Orloff
took part in the relays.
  In addition to the regular meets held with

  The Panther marksmen opened
their 1942 season in wobbly fashion
but compiled a successful record.
They   were   defeated  only  by
Kansas State, City College of New
York, and the University of Cincinnati. These setbacks were more
than balanced when the Blue and
Gold Riflers finally found themselves and registered six straight
wins. Other strong teams which
faced the Pitt squad were Virginia
Military Institute, Michigan State
and Cornell.

were the brilliant performances of        Sgt. McDonald, Haywood, Dickinson, Hoffman, Middleton, Burr, Vajda, Senzio, Capt. W

                                                The fall schedule again featured touch football,
                                              speedball, paddle tennis and badminton. Five sports
                                              occupied the spotlight in the winter program; basket                                              ball, bowling, ping pong, swimming and volleyball.
                                              Spring afforded the most interesting program, all of
                                              the sports being of the outdoor variety. The program
                                              consisted of mushball, golf, horseshoe pitching and

  Composed of all the physical education
majors, the Physical Education Club has as
its purpose the advancement of professionalism in the field of physical education. Under
the leadership of president John Stahl, they
gather in the Heinz House once a month for
informal dinner meetings at which      time
prominent guest speakers are presented. New
ideas into the field of physical education are
introduced and current problems are discussed.
  Affairs just for fun are of greatest importance to these students since recreation is
one of their chief aims. The members of the
club supplement this, however, by including
movies, talks, and discussions in their programs.
  Some of their outstanding achievements
this year have been the "Blackout Dinner"
at which time movies of an air raid on England
were shown, the Freshman Reception, and
the Sport Swing. The latter was a dance
held in the Cathedral gymnasium for the
honor of the athletes of the University.
  Perhaps the biggest event held by this club
all year is Recognition Night. It is here that
the club honors the outstanding junior and
senior students in the field of physical education.
  An innovation this year is the StudentFaculty forum composed of members of the
physical education   faculty and   members
elected by each class. The aim of this group
is to coordinate student-faculty opinion and
also to work out policies for the physical
education club. Members of the StudentFaculty forum   are: Harriet Harris, John
Stahl, seniors; Bernice Kuehner, Norman Fry,
juniors; Mary Jane Griffith, Walter Jones,
sophomores; Marcella Struzel, Fred Wilmer,

        Basketball, tennis, and badminton
      are rapidly becoming major winter
      activities in the girls' sports program.
      The girls recognize that these garmes
      develop alertness, balance, and poise.
   If Pitt students can't dance, it's not the
fault of W.A.A., for one of the new items on
the program of this organization was the biweekly jam sessions in the Cathedral gym.
Peggy Brennan, chairman of the Co-Recreation Committee, acted as dance master. But
Dolly Acker, the president, claims that the
association taught more than dancing. Harriet
Harris, intramural sports chairman, had the
job of coordinating a tremendous array of
tournaments which gave every Pittite the
opportunity to enjoy himself, to become adept
in a variety of sports and to get his share of
exercise.
  These tournaments, which involved class
competition, varied   from   tennis, directed
by  Jessie Schutte, and    badminton, with
Geraldine Rust as chairman, to basketball,
lead by Ruth Mendoza, and volley ball, chairmanned by Jane Bolster. And, for still more
variety, the sports committee provided tournaments in bowling, with Irene Komorski as
head'striker'; in archery, with Florence Levy
playing William Tell; in swimming, with
Harriet Blair chief splasher; and in riding,
with Lucia Zylak holding the reins. Bernice
Kuehner had charge of modern dancing classes
in which Pittites learned to'swing and sway'
gracefully.

  One important aim of W.A.A. was better
health, and Christine Grote's health committee provided a complete program to help
fulfill this aim. It included the Posture and
Fashion Clinic in coordination with the Y.W.
C.A. and Women's Choral, lectures by Dr.
Auleen M. Jamison, and provisions for student
relaxation in the gym between exams.
  Clara Hecht and her membership committee
climaxed their fall membership drive with a
picnic in South Park. Gizella Linder, historian, kept the scrapbook, and Mary Sarantopoulos publicized all the events of the year,
including those arranged by Midge Anderson
and her social committee. This committee
arranged for "Bal Mystique", traditional
W. A. A. party for Freshman women, at which
Carl Heinrich had Freshies and Seniors alike
"rhumbaing". Also crowded on the social
calendar were a barn dance, complete with
straw, chickens, and barmaids; a Scavenger
Hunt for February Freshmen; a Christmas
Party; Snow Party in North Park; a Midsemester Outing at Laurel Ridge; skating and
swimming parties; a spring bicycle excursion
through Schenley Park, and the annual Installation Banquet.

Dr. John G. Bowman
  That each co-ed may express her desire in
recreation, the women's sports program provides a wide diversity of activity. It is largely
set up for individual competition and to have
at least one sport in which a girl is interested.
Some of the more popular sports sponsored
by the woman's physical department are
basketball, tennis, archery, badminton, bowling, volleyball, and modern dancing.      The
department assisted by the W.A.A. also had
charge of lawn bowling, ping-pong, shuffle
board, and riding.
Edna Tarr, director of women's
     athletic program.
  There is always a big turnout of
enthusiastic basketball players in the
Cathedral's spacious gym.
In the spring archery is the favorite among the women's sports.
  The women's athletic program is a
broad one; it offers activities for those
who do not care for the more strenuous
sports.
  The girls find a pleasant hour
of relaxation away from classes
playing shuffle board, building
pyramids, or just tossing the
basketball around.

    Hand in hand with learning goes the social life of the student. Social
life is not separate and apart from the rest of his life at Pitt; rather, the two
are joined together like two hands. Swinging as a boy and girl stroll along
the 0. D. K. walk.
    Hands portray the activities at social affairs: delicate hands picking up
dainty sandwiches from a round glass platter, strong, masculine hands flicking ashes from a cigarette at a fraternity meeting, capable hands decorating
the Main Ballroom with streamers, balloons and posters, limber hands of the
orchestra leader directing smooth music, the slender white hands of a girl
fastening boutonnierre into her escort's lapel.
    The hands of the student are continually being trained to create and to
build, and in social life they are striving to better the art of social relationship
and thus to build the very character of the student himself.

    After several weeks of planning a program and figuring out a budget,
Chairman Charles Perlick, Business Manager William Brown, and Publicity
Manager Myron Levine were well rewarded, when the Freshman Friendship
Frolic, held at the Schenley Hotel proved to be a real success.
    Music was furnished by Leighton Noble and his orchestra with Noble, himself handling the vocals. The girls kept their small sachet dolls, which were
given as favors, to remember the swell time they had. As the dance ended,
a big barrage of balloons were released from the ceiling, and this marked the
end of a perfect evening.

                                           For many months the University has been
                                        keyed up for defense, but now it is preparing
                                        itself for war. Every   student and   every
                                        faculty member is keenly conscious of the
                                        vastness of the problem    ahead. Each    is
                                        aware of the need for a program for protection.
                                        Every individual in the university knows that
                                        for a successful completion of such a program
       7'                               we must have a unifying force, a leader. And
                                        we all turn for this leader to Chancellor Bow                                        man;we feel the warmth of his extended hand.
                                          All of us have a quiet faith in the man whose
                                        dreams and efforts have built for us the
                                        Cathedral of Learning. When we look about
                                        us and feel the massive strength of this build                                        ing, we recognize the power of his hand behind
                                        it, and we feel secure. When we see the
                                        success of his planning, we know that through
                                        his guidance we will evolve the program for
                                        which we are striving.

In an atmosphere that was Pan American.
We dipped low amid the friendly couples around us,
For I wasn't afraid of crushing your corsage.
And we saw them give cups to winning teams
That night as we danced to "Blues in the Night."
And we were sorry to see the end of it all
That night at the formal Interfraternity Ball.

Hold that, Please!
There's the thing we are talking about. It's on
your face, in your eyes, overflowing in the sound
of your laughter. Maybe it's inspiration or hope
or faith; or all of them. We have caught glimpses
of what it can do. It can build motors to speed
trains across continents; turn air waves into music
and words; harness rays to comfort and heal the
sick; make lamps and refrigerators and vacuum
cleaners to help people live better. What it will
do tomorrow depends on you; hold it, please!

is important, and essential.
  By naming this institution executor and trustee
of your estate, you place your affairs in the hands
of men trained by study and experience in the
specialized work of estate management... men
whose interests are the protection of your estate
and the welfare of your beneficiaries.

  A favorite among students and popularly known
as "Doc" is the head of the Men's Student Health
Service, DR. HAROLD C. CARLSON. This usedto-be-carrot-top coaches the Pitt basketball quintet
as a side from his regular work.
  In no other teacher can Pitt women find as much
consolation as in DR. AULEENE        JAMISON,
Director of Women Health Service. Pleasant and
charming, she often speaks to many groups on
"Boy Meets Girl" relationships.
  If the fish that are caught by red-headed DR.
MONT GABBERT of the philosophy department
even partially equal him in size, then you can
believe his "fish" stories for he is a giant of a man.
  Hidden behind stacks of schedule cards is efficient
J. G. QUICK, Register of the University, who concerns himself with the distribution of blue-prints
and the interviewing of prospective scholarship
recipients.  At registration time he is a busy
figure approving deferred payment plans.
  Author, psychologist, "putterer-around" in his
garden at Valencia describes DR. WILLIAM T.
ROOT, Dean of the Graduate School, who is kept
busy with administrative affairs. On the University staff as a professor of psychology since 1920,
Dr. Root became head of the department and
worked in the graduate office since 1935.
  PROFESSOR L. C. McCANDLESS, head of the
department of civil engineering and supervisor of
the engineering, science, and management defense
training courses hardly finds time any more to
spin his watch chain and talk to people with his
slow frankness.
  Digging for coal is of vital interest to the head
of the Department of Mining Engineering, DR.
ROBERT M. BLACK, whose favorite hobby is
"work". He has recently completed an article,
"In Field Economics".

         OWL HAND CONTEST WINNERS
    Early last fall the OWL sponsored a contest... a contest whose
aim it was to find Pitt's most photogenic hands. Mr. Walter R.
Hovey, Mr. Reid Hastie and Miss Eleanor Mitchell, members of
the Art Department, judged the contest. And the judges looked
for all types of hands... thin hands, fat hands, hands that were
rough and expressive, hands that were delicate, beautiful hands,
and hands that were beautiful in their ugliness.
    All through the book you have seen hands as the motif for pages
introducing main sections. It was the hands of the contest
winners that you saw, and we want to express our thanks here to
the following owners of those hands:

OUR APPRECIATION
    With the declaration of war this thirty-seventh volume of the
Owl had to undergo a complete change. To present a true picture
of University activities during 1942 this change was necessary.
    The adoption of the tri-semester plan forced on us the great task
of producing the Owl in a shorter time. We are gratified to those
kind friends who cooperated with us in offering suggestions for
style and substance. We are happy to acknowledge their goodwill and encouragement. Our great desire is to see this Owl, in
passing from hand to hand, give pleasure and enjoyment in the
years to come.

  DR. MANUEL C. ELMER-Head of the Sociology department, with his royal ancestry and
Wisconsin farm background, is never at a loss
for a story to illustrate a sociological point. To

reader and to cut class is to challenge his photographic mind.
  Genial DR. LELAND      BALDWIN     not only
eficiently heads the University libraries, but also
finds time to write. Some of his past works are

make difficult technical problems very simple.
He has an attractive personality and a good sense
of humor.

old school is DR. MARION McKAY, professor of
economics. He always advocated preparedness,
and long before the war, he predicted the impending struggle.
[31]
  DR. JAMES S. TAYLOR'S friendly grin gives
the math students a moral boost. Although as
head of the mathematics department he is kept
quite busy, he is interested in student problems.
  DR. JOHN W. OLIVER, head of the history
department also chairmans the morale committee
on the University defense council and lives the hard
work philosophy that he preaches.

the Wednesday tea in the Commons Room or a
distinguished visitor dedicating a new Nationality
Room.
  DR. WHITFORE H. SHELTON, chairman of
the department of modern     languages, always
begins class on time, gets out his little book, and
closes the door. His speech is quiet but it carries
a strong sense of humor.
  ROBERT X. GRAHAM, director of the Uni
versity News Service, extended his duties in be
coming publication advisor. Bob's humor arise~
from his play on words; at times he is very punny.
  Respected by all for his erudition, genial DR
PERCIVAL HUNT, head of the English departmen
and professor at large, livens his lectures by quota
tions and illustrations from experiences commoi
to all his students.

OFFICE OF THE DEAN OF MEN
  When campus leaders and activities men
brought their problems to 809 this year, they
found new counsel and new advisers. Presiding over the busy domain that is the Dean
of Men's office is Acting Dean of Men, Theodore W. Biddle. No stranger at judging
ideas, plans, and men, Mr. Biddle drew from
his store of experience to answer the many
questions brought to his desk.
  To the difficult job of coordinating the
varied and expansive activities of Pitt fraternities came personable Roy H. Umble capably performing his task with vigor. Band
director Robert Arthur was another new
name to be painted on the door. His was
the responsibility of general adviser to the
University's many diverse activities.
  Replacing Ed Williams in the placement
bureau, the job of finding the best places for
Pitt graduates became the trust of Lawrence
Irwin. Inspite of new faces and new problems, Mr. Biddle and his associates were more
than equal to the demands made of them.
MR. THEODORE W. BIDDLE settles men's problems.
  MR. ED WILLIAMS finds us jobs.
MR. ROBERT ARTHUR counsels activities.          DEAN OF MEN SECRETARIES: Kesseler, Cubbison, Dorfield.              MR. ROY UMBLE advises fraternities.

    Take an ordinary classroom door and watch the beating it gets
during the changing of classes. The impatient students on their way
out pull on its stubborn knob, hold it open for those in back, and
bang it against the wall until it Finally comes into the gentler hands of
the instructor who closes it quietly. Then for a Few moments he stands
quietly until the next mob rushes into the room.  Now it is pushed,
sometimes by fat heavy hands that shove it open, sometimes by soft
painted hands that weakly struggle against its bulk. The late comer
hits it a solid blow  as a boisterous salute. Inside the room the
hands are still busy rustling the News, probing in pocket books---
conscientious hands that leaf through texts, and relaxed hands whose
idleness shows that their masters are already on the way to sleep,
and Finally the earnest hands which grasp the pens and pencils. The
class has begun.   And so we begin the most important part of this
book, the part that makes Pitt a University---the Classes.

SENIOR
QUEEN
ALMA INVATER
NANCY CRAWFORD
E 43 1
    Each year one senior girl is chosen by her classmates to reign as
Senior Queen for one year. She is selected for her character, her
personality, her achievement in academic studies, her participation in
extra-curricular activities and her contribution to the life of the
University.
    Alma Mater, another outstanding senior girl, crowns the queen
in an English coronation ceremony under the Gothic arches of the
Commons Room.
    The Senior Queen is a symbol. The members of the senior class
not only honor her as a person, but also see in her, and honor in her,
their own personal attainments.
                                                          "Intelligent leadership, personal integrity, and intellectual
                                                     honesty" are phrases that describe the Senior Awardee. And this
                                                     award is given to the senior man who most closely approaches these
                                                     standards set up by Omicron Delta Kappa.
                                                          From the outstanding men a special committee chooses the
                                                     awardee. Dean Theodore Biddle is the chairman of the committee.
                                                          0. D. K. and the University honor the Senior Awardee by in                                                     scribing his name on O. D. K. walk.

DR. LANFEAR reads the latest business journals.
    DR. VINCENT W. LANFEAR
  Because he misses his boys on the eighth
floor, the wise and friendly counselor, Dean
Lanfear, is always glad when they drop into
his office for a chat. Last July, Dean Lanfear
moved from his office of Dean of Men and is
now Dean of the School of Business Administration. Since the war he has noted a
great demand for girls in business administration. He says this field offers broad opportunities.
  Although too busy to spend much time on
hobbies or recreation, Dean Lanfear is a
nature and fishing enthusiast. Several years
ago he and his wife collected liverworts from
thirty-six counties in Pennsylvania, and Carnegie Museum now exhibits their entire collection.
  Dean Lanfear came to Pitt in 1924 as a
professor in business finance. Until 1934 he
was head of the downtown Chamber of
Commerce division of the University.

  DR. STANTON C. CRAWFORD
  Dean Crawford, combining a high standard
of learrniig with a necessity for student activity, a ects his school wisely and efficiently.
A graduate of Bethany College, West Virginia,
where he majored in biology, he obtained his
master's degree at Cincinnati and his doctor's
degree at Pitt. Dean of the College for seven
years, Dean Crawford first came to Pitt as a
teacher and was appointed director of High
School Relations. Primarily interested in the
student and his place in the University, Dean
Crawford believes that, "Young people must
be given every opportunity for working out
their own careers. The value of student
activities can not be over-emphasized, and as
a means toward obtaining that end, the
present Student Advisory systems are very
effective."

DR. FRIESSELL enters another year
       with the University.
     DR. H. EDMUND FRIESSELL
  During the thirty-eight years that Dr.
H. Edmund Friessell has been Dean of the
School of Dentistry, his initiative and drive
have been responsible for Pitt's recognition
as a leader among American dental institutions.
  Since 1918, when the Dental Education
Council of America began its ratings, our
Dentistry School has been recognized as class
"A".
  Dr. Friessell, believing that "dentistry is a
field of health service of the utmost importance
to man", has given most of his life to his
work. He founded the American College of
Dentists in 1920 and has served on numerous
state, national, and international committees
for dental research. The Dental Library and
Museum originated from his own private
collection.
In the DENTAL INFIRMARY with its modern equipment, students get practical dental training.

DR. JACOBSEN, believer in educational ideals
            through arts.
     DR. EINAR W. JACOBSEN
  Dr. Einar W. Jacobsen has been at the
University for less than two years, but no man
has been more active in two years. As Chairman of the Civilian Defense Council at the
University, his duties are doubled arranging
a complicated and elaborate defense program.
In December Dr. Jacobsen directed a Christmas Festival which was presented in the
Commons Room.
  But he does not spend all his time at the
University.  Recently, he made trips to
Nebraska, Iowa, Indiana, and California.
His Education for Family Life, which is newly
off the press, is a great help to many people.

     DEAN RUTH PERKINS KUEHN
  Since nursing is an essential defense service,
Dean Kuehn is quite busy aiding the need for
more nurses. In the local Red Cross Nurses'
Chapter, her responsibility is to train people
in home nursing, and to build up the Red
Cross First Reserve which serves as a reservoir
for obtaining nurses for both the army and
navy. Women's clubs, community organizations, and educational groups are striving to
have Dean Kuehn speak to them.
  The only let-up that she has had from her
work was her trip to New York last January,
where she is serving on the State National
Committee for the Recruiting of Nurses. She
will make this trip again very shortly, and
perhaps get a rest from her many activities.

     MR. BISHOP BROWN
  Director Brown is a graduate of Dartmouth. Since 1929 he has been connected with the University's Bureau of
Retail Training, and for the last seven
years has headed the Bureau as its
director. Before joining the Bureau, Mr.
Brown was store manager for Hobey Co.
and Jay's in Boston.
  Mr. Brown's interests run outside his
field. He is fond of flowers and has an
elaborate garden around his home. During the last war he was a citation.
  Once a year Mr. Brown makes a tour
to some of the leading universities of the
country to recruit for the following year's
course.
  Prominent in the realm of its graduate
schools is the University's Research Bureau
for Retail Training. In 1918 the Bureau had
its beginning in a committee of Pittsburgh
merchants and educators interested in the
problems of young people entering the field
of retailing. Thus it is the pioneer graduate
retail school of the world.
  The Bureau has as its basis the needs of
the young men and women interested in reMR. BROWN checks current business reports
tailing and of the business man who will
employ these young people. It intelligently
recognizes the fact that although the business
man desires his young employee to be wellfounded in the theories and principles of
retailing, he looks for the person who can
meet the problems of business with ease and
competence, the person who is skilled in
practical knowledge. The Bureau knows that
the student who is best acquainted with the
diverse aspects of retailing is the student
most likely to solve his own problems quickly;
it knows that the business man prefers the
well-rounded student.
  With the student's needs in mind, the
Bureau plans its program. It is the graduate
school of specialization for students of retailing; it does for the retail student what the
hospital does for the medical student. From
the program the Bureau sets up, the student
can see merchandising, personnel management, control, store operation, and advertising
in action and can choose among them. He
gets theoretical and practical training in the
field of his choice.
Research always plays an important part in the Bureau program.
    In addition to the class room, the
Bureau offers the student laboratory
work, actual experience. It sets aside
two days a week for the student to observe and work in     one of Pittsburgh's
seven cooperating department stores, in
which he meets and handles real business situations. But most important is
the fact that during that year of grad             F                                                                             Students make and study charts
                                                                                         that disclose surprising facts about
                                                                                         familiar store operations.

uate work, the young student finds himself and directs his training toward one
line rather than blundering about in the
business world indefinitely. For in our
age of specialization the individual must
be skilled in the needs of one field; the
student with general knowledge and no
specific training is at a disadvantage.

Up the hill, on University Drive stands PENNSYLVANIA HALL
           where medical students attend classes.
   DR. WILLIAM S. McELLORY
   The United States Navy used to have
"Bill"; Pitt has him now. A former tennis
champ, a letterman in football, and a lover
of golf is Dr. William S. McEllroy, Dean
of the Medical School "up on the hill".
His many responsibilities at the University
keep him very busy, but he always finds time
to help a fellow. Although he is not doing
any research at present, he has conducted
extensive research studies in blood pigment,
protein and iron, anemia, and metabolism.
  Dr. McEllroy, a former Pitt man, served
as junior lieutenent in the Medical Reserve
of the United States Navy after he graduated
from the University.   Later he became assistant instructor in  the medical school.
Today he is the dean.
DEAN McELLROY heads Pitt's Medical center.
From the thirty-fifth floor of the Cathedral, one can see the vast expanse of the upper campus
                 showing Pennsylvania Hall in the background.
