the guise of Kirk Bruce who garnered 32 points against
the Red Flashes. Sixteen more points by Tom Richards
aided the Panthers to a 89-75 victory.

The ups and downs continued for the hoopsters with
three away games coming up. The Cats travelled to

Reynolds Coliseum in Raleigh N.C. to face the Duke
Blue Devils. A jittery performance cost the locals an
89-75 loss despite a 24 point output by Bruce. The
next night the Panthers were to oppose N.C. State, the
defending national champions with superstar David
Thompson. A brilliant first half effort spearheaded by
Freshman Melvin Bennett‚Äôs rebounding shot the Cats
into a 36-33 lead at the half. The second half was a

The Pitt-Notre Dame struggle was truly one of the

offensive punch by Bruce, Richards, Lew Hill, and

Pitt was named the top seed in the ECAC tournament

Post Season Action

Thirteen wins in the last sixteen games
catapaulted Pitt into the number one
seed position and a match-up against
West Virginia in the ECAC tournament.
The tourney champ then enters the
NCAA national wars. A dismal 36%
shooting accuracy doomed the Cats to a
75-73 drubbing at the hand of the
Mounties however. The refs also took
it on the nose for their part in Pitt‚Äôs
shocking defeat. The eventual winner of
the tournament, Georgetown, was quick-
ly eliminated in NCAA first round action.
Good news was soon coming as NIT
officials extended a bid to the Cats and a
square-off against Southern Illinois en-
sued. Good defense and accurate shoot-
ing by Larry Harris and Keith Starr
resulted in a 70-65 thumping of the
Salukls. Pitt‚Äôs quarterfinal foe, Pro-
vidence, proved to be a different sort
of opponent as six Friar players scored
in double figures to hand the Cats a
101-80 bombing. The Friars used a high
pressure defense that saw Pitt players
simply throwing the ball away at times.
The Cats had an excellent year finishing
with an 18-11 record, unbeaten at
home,Aand a solid group of performers
will return next year. New head coach
Tim Grgurich promises more of the
same.

 

Melvin Bennett

Freshman sensation Melvin Bennett
produced many thrilling moments for
basketball fans this year. His leaping
ability made him tops in rebounding
and in blocked shots. It appears how-
ever that Bennett will be lost to the
Virginia Squires of the ABA leaving a
big hole to fill in Pitt basketball.

BUZZ RIDL THE GRAND OL‚Äô MAN

Pitt Panther head basketball coach,
Charles ‚ÄúBuzz" Ridl has decided
that it is time to retire. After
spending 7 years at Pitt and 12
years as head coach at Westminster
‚ÄúBuzz" has compiled a record of
312 wins and 173 losses for a win-
ning percentage of 64.3%.

Ridl's success came long before he
reached Pitt. Formerly serving as
Westminster's head basketball

coach, Ridl compiled an amazing
record of 216 wins and only 90
losses (70.4 winning percentage).
During his reign he captured seven
West Penn Conference champion-
ships in nine years. He also guided
the Titans to six apperances in the
NAIA, reaching the finals in 1960
and '62 and the semifinals in '61
and '68. His 1962 squad was voted
by both wire services as the #1
small college team in the nation.

and he subsequently was named
NAIA Coach‚Äîof-the‚ÄîYear.

It is no wonder why Pitt was de-
lighted when ‚ÄúBuzz" came here in
1968. But the road was not an easy
one. He knew that Pitt needed alot
of work, not only on the court, but
also in the administrative and re-
cruiting areas as well.

It took a couple of years, but
‚ÄúBuzz" did it. Taking the Panthers
on a 22-game winning streak, Ridl
led the Cats to a 25-4 record for the
'73-‚Äô74 season. This fantstic feat
brought honors in from all over the
nation. First, Pitt was invited to the
NCAA Eastern Regional Playoffs in
which Pitt ended up as a finalist.
Also Pitt was recognized as being
one of the top twenty teams in the
nation. Ridl recieved recognition
too, and was named District ll
Coach‚Äîof-the‚ÄîYear. He also finished
third in the balloting for National
Coach‚Äîof-the‚ÄîYear.

In his final season at Pitt, Coach
Ridl took command of a young ball
club and molded them into a team.
A team that not only won 16 of
its 25 games, but also went to the
NIT playoffs. It took discipline and
inspiration to make the players do
their best. But more importantly,
Ridl gained the respect and admira-
tion of the players. These qualities
have not only made Ridl a dedicated
coach, but also a class individual.

With his retirement from basket-
ball coaching, Ridl has left a big
question mark. He has brought in
good recruits and developed the
team to a high potential. It will
be interesting to see how the Pan-
thers do without the ‚Äúgrand old
dad".

PITT GRAPPLERS
KEEP FANS ON EDGE
OF SEATS

The Pitt Panther grapplers marched
into the 1975 wrestling season full of
confidence and enthusiasm. Coach Dave
Adams felt the team had the best atti-
tude of any team he had coached and
was expecting great things of returning
All-Americans George Bryant and Rande
Stottlemyer. Ten Ietterman returned to
this team including the addition of
seven new freshmen. Early season in-
juries hampered the progress of many
wrestlers. Pitt overwhelmed Temple 33-
15 to open the year with Bob and Bill
Baily, Carl Roba, and John Chatman
each gaining pins. Consecutive losses to
Navy and Lehigh were followed by a 42-
zip body slam of West Virginia and a
31-3 pinning of Maryland. Momentum
was gained in successive pummellings
of Delaware, Maryland, and Franklin and
Marshall. Pitt grapplers finished up and
down, sparring with Clarion (L), Lock
Haven (W), Syracuse, (L), Millersville
(W), and. Penn State (W). The Penn
State upset was a hotly contested af-
fair with Pitt winning on a heavyweight
pin by Carl Roba in the final event.
The Panthers finished a phenomenal
third at the Eastern Championships, one
point behind second place Navy. Stottle-
myer placed sixth at Nationals earning
All-America Honors.

Head Coach Dave Adams shows the pressure of the very close Pitt-Penn State
contest. Pitt won 22-17 on a pin by Carl Roba.

Rande Stottlemyer escapes to decision Navy opponent
Tom Bauer 2-0.

when Jeff Minerd, John Chatman,
and George Bryant missed most of
the season must have been pres-
ent. in order to compete with the
likes of Navy, Penn State, and Clar-
ion, Pitt would have to be physically _

lar season bouts, and placed third
in the Easterns, one point out of
second place. Sending six to the

WOMEN ENJOY THE TENNIS
RACKET, NET WINNING YEAR

The Pitt Women's Tennis Team launched itself into a
6-3 season record this year, a fine showing for a first
year squad. Coach Willa Bentley, local tennis standout,
brought together twelve walk on candidates who by
season's end made a formidable showing on the tennis
scene. Coach Bentley commented ‚ÄúFew of the girls had
any tournament experience and we literally built from
scratch. The twelve started playing tennis together for
the first time on September 10, and by September 21st
we had to play our first match.‚Äù Anouk Sassouni, the
number one player, swept through most of her oppo-
nents this year. She was backed by Kathy Turner, Leslie
Nichols, Rhonda Filapose, and Beth Secosky in singles
play. After losing the season opener to West Virginia,
the girls swept past Bethany, Chatham and Cal. State

INDOOR TRACK
SEASON A
SUCCESS

Coach Jim Banner (soon to be-
come Athletic Director at Carnegie-
Mellon) was again blessed with an
abundance of young talent on the
banked track as Pitt began its 1975
indoor season. The addition of
Karl Farmer, wor|d‚Äîclass 440 sprint-
er gave an added dimension of
strength. High jumpers George
Jupin and Tim Riley were joined by
state high school champ Dan
Goodyear to form an awesome
threesome, all capable of clearing
6'8" or better consistently. Chuck
Mozingo and Rich Markley looked
like sure bets to reach nationals in
the 880 and 1000 yard runs re-

spective‚Äù/_ A good recruiting haul Jay Sharpley matches talents with arch-rival Turner of West Virginia. The Two staged spec-
brought Mel Boyd and Dave Mao tacular races which Sharpley pressed to a six second flat Fieldhouse and Pitt record.

Donald into action in the distance
events and Pitt as usual looked
strong in the relays. Sprint strength
was here at last with the addition of
Willie Walker in the 60 yd. dash and
Jay Sharpley and Dan Schuerle in the
hurdles. At the Michigan State Re-
lays, the team took home a first,
second, fourth, fifth, and three sixths,
an effort unmatched by many of the
college powers there. The Ohio State
Relays saw only 16 Pitt tracksters, of
which 14 placed in the top six. Karl
Farmer ran away from the field in
the 440 and Rich Markley grabbed a
third in the 880, definitely not his
race. Chuck Mozingo clocked a 1:11
flat in a second place effort and
Keith Taylor took second in the triple
jump. Two home meets saw Willie
Walker sprinting to victory and Jay
Sharpley setting a Fieldhouse record
of 6.0 flat in the hurdles. in the
|C4A's, a bad day and some wacky
event organization cost Pitt a good
day at the races. Even though,
Farmer placed fourth, and the dis-
tance medley team garnered a fifth.
Mozingo and Farmer were invited to
the nationals where both finished
ninth.

Karl Farmer was a welcome addition from the
football squad. The world-class sprinter ran away
from most competition clocking a 48.5 best
indoors.

SOCCER STILL KICKING

It was called a rebuilding year for Coach Leo Bemis.
Gone were the big name players of last year, Joe Lux-
bacher, Dennis Kohlmyer, and Bill Haines. Having a
group of, relatively inexperienced booters on a team
that receives pitifully little in funds, Bemis set out
to face the likes of Penn State, and West Virginia. Al-
though Pitt did not play giant killer, they did manage
an improved 4-6-2 slate, bettering last year‚Äôs record.
Senior Mark Venanzi, fullback, was named team MVP
and other standouts included Jerry Luxbacher, Bill
Rex, John Curley, Ernie Gross, and goal keep Frank

PITT HOCKEY
ICES OPPOSITION

To say the least, it was another very
good year for the Pitt independent
Hockey Club. The graduation of seven
players form last year's squad brought
about early doubts about improving on
the 1973-74 record of 18-3-1. But depth
problems were erased as a new breed
of tough, aggressive, hard‚Äîshooting icers
were found. The 1974-75 version of the
club finished a remarkable 19-3-2.

The starting offensive line of Rick Ver-
non, Charlie Hagins and Denny Browne
returned intact. The Goals Incorporated
line, as they were called, accounted for
92 goals this season with top man Rick
Vernon tallied a fantastic 56 goals on
his own. Backing up Goals Inc. was the
‚ÄúKid Line" made up of freshmen Bill
Gedeon, Chuck Crisanti, and soph Jeff
Saunders. This group added 44 goals
to the Pitt scoring totals. Vernon's one-
man show was highlighted by a power-
ful slap shot, exciting solo rushes, and
a game breaking style that amassed an
average of 2.5 goals per game. Vernon
was named Player of the Year by the
Rotary International Hagins added 17
goals and many assists and Browne
tallied 19 times to round out the Goals
Inc. line.

The Kid Line was sparked by Gedeon
with 19 goals and 27 assists. While
scoring an average of seven times per
game, the Panthers held opponents to
just 2.7. John Finney, hard checking
defensiveman led the Panther stoppers.
Bob Arturo and Russ Stump backed
Finney while goalie Jumpin John De-
Fazio became the WPIHA top netminder.

Aggressive play put the Cats at the top
of the WPIHA heap once again as Pitt
humbled closest competitor CMU several
times. The only seniors graduating are
Hagins, Browne and DeFazio, though
these will be key positions to fill. If
new talent is discovered, next year's
hockey club (hopefully team) will again
reign over area opponents.

Tough checking and aggressive play have led Pitt to the
top of the local hockey scene for many years.

WOMEN GYMNASTS

7-3 RECORD

The 1975 Pantherette gymnasts were
guided by first year coach Donna De-

gymnast for Pitt and is a 1974 graduate.
An unknown commodity at the season‚Äôs
start, the Pantherettes finished with a
strong 7-3 slate and a fifth place in the
State meet in which ten schools com-
peted. Prospects for next year look
good as only senior Nicci Adams will be
leaving. Returning will be best all‚Äîaround
gymnasts Lori Warbutton, and Nancy
Weisser; Lisa Adams, Marianne Kennedy,
Sheila Barber, Carol Winstanley, and
Diane Baumgartner. These girls all per-

ence and a further desire to win. War-

SEASON

You would think that no one could look
back and smile at a 1-7 record but
that's exactly what coach lg Perez is
doing. ‚ÄúThis year we're trotting, next
year we'll start running," observed
Perez. That may indeed be so as only
senior Mark Boyette will be lost on a
team comprised of himself, three fresh-
man, and five sophomores. Pitt scored
in the 141 point range early in the sea-
son but improved to a 198 score against
Navy. This is startling progress in the
very stable sport of gymnastics. Rob
Pasterick was the best all around man
and he received very capable support
from Gus Papantonio, Mark Boyette,
and Don Stevenson. The season's only
win came at the expense of West Vir-
ginia 192-187. Pitt's all-around men
plus Gary Wolf on the side horse pro-
vided most of the scoring punch.

BRADSHAW FATHOMS
BRIGHT FUTURE
FOR YOUNG TEAM

The eyes of swimming coach Dick
Bradshaw are gleaming at the prospects
of next year's team. The only loss on
this year's squad was senior Eric Shultz.
A fine recruiting year may be just what
the doctor ordered to improve on this
year's 6-3 record and second place
finish at the Eastern's. Every team and
all but one pool record was broken in
this year's onslaught. Jerry DeMuro,
distance swimmer Tom Fatyol, Jeff
Miller, and Dave Reeder, one and three
meter divers. all went to the nationals.
This trio was capably supported all sea-
son long by standouts Schultz, John
Schepner, Carlos Santiago, Dave Natali,
and John Templin. The season opened
with a 98-15 splashing of rebuilding
Temple. Bradshaw substituted liberally,
testing several new talents. An eighth
of a second spelled the difference in
the Bucknell contest as the Tankers were
defeated in the final event. Kent State
likewise proved to be a better foe in a
hairsplitting competition, but Penn
State, American, Maryland, Cleveland
State and Youngstown could simply
tread water in their defeats. Jerry De-
Muro proved to be one of the top dis-
tance men in the country and the divers
improved with every meet. Diving coach
Al Coffey summed it up, ‚ÄúWe have an
exceptionally talented young team.
Watch out for us next year.‚Äù

PERFECTION

Diving Coach Al Coffey offered expert
tutelage to Pitt's men and women's
diving teams this year. His efforts paid
off as two women, Bert Snoznik and
Sandee Lipp, and three men, Dave
Reeder, Tom Fatyol, and Jeff Miller
qualified for the Nationals. The men have
been undefeated in duel meets since
1974 showing loyalty and dedication to
the sport. Dedication is in deed neces-
sary as two months of running, calls-
thenics, weight lifting andvtrampolining
are planned before the team ever hits
the water. Strength and gracefulness
are needed to perfect the diver‚Äôs tech-
nique. If national stature and team and
pool records are any indication, Coach
Coffey's charges have indeed been prac-

WOMEN TANKERS
SPLASH TO VICTORY

First year head coach Kate Mathison
inherited a young but strong contingent
of female swimmers and the team im-
mediately proceeded to wipe the record
slate clean by smashing every team rec-
ord in the very first meet of the sea-
son. After Kent State was torpedoed
104-29 in the year‚Äôs opener, the girls
met tough water against Clairton state,
and Ohio State. Both teams are top
caliber competition, beating the Pan-
therettes in the last event of each meet
in close contests. The Pantherettes went
on to dunk the remaining opponents
finishing 7-2. Pitt qualified Angie Lopez,
Mamie Heretick, Saoron Reisdorf, Sue
Price, Connie Walker, Lois Gould, Nancy
Yates, Mary Wallisch, Charlotte Senseny,
and Mickey Chamberlain for the East-
erns, along with divers Bert Snoznik and
Sandee Lipp. Lopez, Price, Walker, Reis-
dorf and Heretik qualified for the na-
tionals on the basis of their season
performances. The women placed 11th
out of 58 teams at the Easterns, an
improvement over last year. Even better
things are expected of next year's team.
Angie Lopez was named All American in
the 100 yard breast stroke.

WOMEN RUN AND
GUN T0 VICTORY

The Pitt Pantherette Basketball team
under head coach Jean Condo pounced
on competition for an 11-5 overall slate
this year. Led by senior Mary Ellen Klob‚Äî
char with a 13.2 ppg average the women
gained victories over Penn State, Slip-
pery Rock, Ohio State and West Virginia.
Under the revamped women's program,
scholarships were allowed bringing in a
host of freshman talent. The ra ngy sharp
shooters jelled in their first year together
to form a powerful run and gun offense
and a sticky defense. Debbie Jones and
Kim Raymond led in rebounds and were
second and third in scoring respectively
to back the high scoring Klobchar. Diane
Zaken, Margie Schneider, Kathy Szra-
mowski, Geri Seidl, and Jamie Andrews
saw lots of action this season in aiding
the Pa ntherettes to their fine record.

WOMEN DIG
VOLLEYBALL-
SPIKE FOES

T0 WINNING SEASON

Pantherette volleyball made a stun-
ning return to the women sports
scene this year compiling an overall
14-3 won-loss record. Coach Mary
Kromer welded an all freshman
team into one of the top units in
the East. The fact that two of the
six starters never played volleyball
before makes this feat all the more
amazing. A 150% effort by the Pitt
six (pictured at right) led the
Pantherettes to the quarter-finals
of the EAlAW tournament in New-
ark, Delaware. Coach Kromer re-
marked, ‚ÄúFor a first year team
to be invited to the regionals is
very good. We're happy and proud."

FIRST YEAR TRACK
TEAM SHOWS SPEEDY
IMPROVEMENT

Head Coach Georgia Eberhart (1968
Pitt graduate) molded green first
year women's track recruits into
a group of girls with a thirst for
stronger competition. The women
proved to be tough opposition for
local college squads during both
the indoor and outdoor seasons.
Freshman Martha Suhayda, discus
and shot thrower showed the poten-
tial for national distinction. Michelle
Bressant, hurdles, Cris Cornelius,
sprints, and Jenny Westman, Mile,
were stand‚Äîout performers in their
events all year long.

PITT SLUGGERS
FIELD 10-4 SEASON

Every year the Pitt baseball team is
plaqued by spring rains and a paucity
of games. This year proved to be little
better as only fourteen of eighteen
scheduled games were completed. The
team ended the season with a commend-
able 10-4 record under the stern eye
of head coach Bobby Lewis. The Pitt
sluggers terrorized opposing pitchers
as seven batters finished with batting
averages of over .300. Lynn Nystrom,
first baseman, led the hitters with a
.370 season average. Joe Groetsch
pounded out four home runs and thir-
teen RBl's on the season, both highs on
the team. Jerry Minsinger was the pitch-
ing ace picking up four wins and one loss
in thirty-five innings of throwing. Don
Kennedy and Don Siegle followed with
three and two wins respectively. In the
field, Joe Groetsch showed his major
league potential making many dazzling
plays at shortstop despite an unex-
pected batting slump early in the sea-
son. Groetsch has a high possibility of
following former Pitt stars Ken Macha
(Pirates) and George Medich (Yankees)
to the major leagues.

Outfielder Mel Howard sends a fastball screaming toward centerfield.

COMPETITIVE
SEASON FOR
BANNERMEN

After a successful indoor stint the
Pitt trackmen took to the cinders
for a new outdoor season. Mike
Matter, freshman, provided some
of the biggest thrills by hurling
the javelin 247 feet, one of the
top throws in the country. Karl
Farmer established a new school
record in the 440 with a 46.7 clock-
ing. The mile relay flew to a 3:12
flat at the |C4A's. Bigger and bet-
ter than ever was the Pitt Invita-
tional. For a team highly dependent
on youth, the trackman did quite
well this year.

Chuck Mozingo takes the baton and helps the mile
relay to a 3:12 time at the invitational.

Freshman Mike Matter establishes himself as one of the top javelin throwers in the
country and a threat to break the Pitt record of 256 feet.

Polish Dignitary Visits Pitt

JAMES MCCORD

James McCord was at Pitt in late
September to speak of his role
in the Watergate break-in. The
former Security Chief of the
Committee to Re-elect the Presi-
dent spoke to a crowd of about
200 students at Benedum Hall.
McCord reminisced about his
pioneer ancestors and his career
in the CIA before coming to
terms with the Watergate situa-
tion. Responsible for taping open
the doors of the Democratic
Headquarters, McCord was
arrested along with four co-
conspirators. He maintained that
former President Nixon's close

defeat in 1960 and close victory
in 1968 elicited a need to gather
political intelligence on the
Democratic opponents.

McCord spent time in jail for
his part in the break-in and sub-
sequent cover-up. At this point
he offered much evidence to
Judge Siricca who presided over
the case. This blew the top off
the Watergate cover-up and led
to the eventual resignation of
President Nixon.

Monty Alexander and Moses Allison
presented their talents in coffee
house fashion at the Student Union
Annex this fall. Few knew that this
would be one of the last mini con-
certs to be held at this Mecca for
music lovers. Later, opposition by
Oakland residents forced the
closing of the Annex. Monty Alex-
ander, Jamaican born, thrityish,
blended country and blues and jazz.
His music was a reflection of life,
his piano rhythms a mixture of
Latin and Jazz. Although originally
appearing to be obscure artists,
Allison and Alexander provided a
full evening of listening enjoyment.

JAZZ/BLUIES

The Student Union Annex was the scene for the Moses Allison and
Monty Alexander Jazz/Blues Fusion Show. It was to be one of the
last shows held at the Annex which closed under community pressure.

FRESH MAN FALL WEEKEND
FUN-FILLED TRADITION

Freshman Fall Weekend, a tradition at Pitt for over forty
years, took place this year at Camp Kon-O-Kwee in
Butler County from September 6th through 8th. A
capacity group of freshmen enjoyed a beautiful, sun
filled weekend of swimmin_g, softball, and singing among
other things.

The sixty upperclassmen in attendance as counselors
were representative of many campus groups and pro-
vided the freshmen with a well rounded introduction
to the University. Faculty members and administrators
from various schools and departments also contributed
greatly to the success of Freshman Camp.

Freshman Fall Weekend is the first opportunity for a
new student to meet and form close friendships with
other freshmen, upperclassmen, and faculty members.
Many of the friendships made at Freshman Camp last
throughout the student's years at Pitt and beyond.
Nothing can guarantee a student's involvement in
campus life, but Freshman Fall Weekend can give the
entering student an excellent start.

A DAY IN
  THE PARK

staff Hill in Schenley Park for an
afternoon rock show and get to-
gether. The event, sponsored by
Engineering and Nursing Students,
featured McKendree Spring. The
usual concert delays occurred and
students amused themselves by
flipping Frisbees and tipping a few
beers. The crowd was unusually
well-behaved dispite the delays.
When nothing that looked like a
riot occurred, the few police that
were nearby disappeared. Mc-
Kendree Spring put on a good
show even though the crowd's
doldrums remained throughout
the afternoon.

A relatively sedate crowd was on hand for McKendree Spring and Raun McKinnon. Flipping
Frisbees proved just as entertaining to most.

Remember the old Allan Sherman song about life at
Camp Granada? Well things were pretty much the same
when Mom and Dad visited campus on Parents Week-
end. We had about a month and a half of school,
enough time to complain all about, dorm life, roomates,
early classes and Szabo food. Ah, it was good to see
Mom and Dad again.

Take me home . . . . . . . Dear Muddah, Faddah.

A comical farce about the wheelings and dealings of
a mischievous manipulator called Scapin, played with
flair by Robert Reusch. The play was directed by David
Rinear, and the cast of Scapin included, Bill Hanks,
Mark Schuler, Paula Swart, Larry Lott, Neal Kogen, and
Phillip Thomson. Scapin originally was performed
during the Spring of 1974 and was revived again for
pefrmances in September.

cabarety

Cabaret, directed by Dr. Gillette Elvgren of the theatre
arts department, was the first main stage production
of the year. Set against the decadent background of
Hitler's Germany, the show played to sell-out crowds
throughout its run. John Fahey, as the American writer,

and Kate Young, as Sally Bowles, shared the leads. Paul
Binotto acted as the M.C., and Edwin Rupert and Jocelyn
Johnson added support. Song and dance numbers held
the plot together and stage sets by Henry Heymann en-
hanced the feeling of despair and uneasiness.

LOCAL ART SCENE PALETTE‚ÄîAb|e

 

The Sistine Ceiling Seen for the First Time, featured full scale color photos of the Michelangelo

masterpiece.

With the opening of the UP Gallery on Forbes
Avenue in 1974, the scope of art in the area was
greatly increased. Faculty, student, and profes-
sional exhibitions have abounded there this past
year. At the Frick Fine Arts Building, several top
exhibitions including; The Price of Genius, Swedish
Impressionist paintings; Antiquity Reborn, Ren-
aissance prints; and the Sistine Ceiling Seen for
the First Time, a collection of 1:1 photographic
reproductions of the great Michelangelo work.

PITT STUDENTS
SPEND SECOND
TERM WALKING
IN A WINTER
WONDERLAND

For several season's winter in
Pittsburgh was nothing more than a
rainy season. But this year, all those

 
 
 
 
 
   

174

skiers who said ‚Äúthink snow" got
what they wished for, in spades.
Pitt students enjoyed slushing to
classes, throwing snowballs, ‚Äútray-
ing" at Schenley Park (for traying
one must take a dinner tray from
the cafeteria and use it in the
manner of commercial snow sau-
cers etc.), and literally rolling
themselves in the snow. Schenley
Park was a Mecca for snow en-
thusiasts who found warm weather
and high snow drifts from plowed
roads just the thing for some
rambunctious horseplay.

CO MMUTER WEEK

Gala Festivities for
The Travel Weary

Commuter Week was once again
held this year to offer some recog-
nition, information, and entertain-
ment for Pitt‚Äôs bus-riding majority,
the Commuter. The commuter is
the ingenious soul who trudges
to Pitt each day in a variety of
means of transportation; private
car, PAT bus, on foot, hitchhiking,
even commuter trains. So for those,
and all of the Pitt Community as
well, Commuter Week offered,
magician, Donaldo, a cycle display,
PAT bus info, a commuter dance
with Sweet Breeze, and much more.

Sweet Breeze brought rompin' stompin‚Äô music to the Commuter Week
Dance.

A Penny Toss and carnival games added to the week's success.

Controntatlon In the Chancellor‚Äô: office: About 100
black students entertained a captive audience of four
University officials for four hours with demands and
questions about the appointment of Roland Smith
as Black Studies Chairman and not the crowd's

BLACK STUDIES
CHAIR DISPUTE
SPARKS BROUHAHA

On Tuesday October 23, in what
has to be described as one of the
shabbier incidents of the school
year, about 100 black students
descended upon the Chancellor's
office. Their intention was to get
an explanation for the appointment
of Roland Smith as chairman of
the Black Studies Department and
not the crowd's favorite Curtiss
Porter. The SRO crowd literally
stood toe to toe for four hours in
an attempt to hash out an agree-
ment with FAS Dean Rosenberg and
aides Ray Coble and David Powers.
Reassessment of the situation was
the administration's decision, as
the blacks gained another victory
for self-determination.

Qmf

favorite Curtiss Porter. The party broke up about
dinner time with the words still ringing ‚Äúif we want
Joe Blow for our chairman, then we should have Joe
Blow for our chairman."

   One thousand and twenty-eight scoops of ice cream

were consumed during the Ice Cream Eating Marathon
 O N G U 1 held in February in order to raise money for the Western
"‚Äî . Pennsylvania Heart Fund. The contest, sponsored by

Pitt Greeks, raised $258 for the charity.

Winner of the contest was Dennis Vicusi who became champion by downing 180 scoops. The winner demonstrates his style.

 

DANCE MARATHON
‚ÄúI COULD HAVE
DANCED ALL NIGHT‚Äù

Pitt's Third Annual Dance Marathon
was held this January in an ex-
panded thirty-six hour version of
the contest. The over fifty couples
who participated came equipped
with foot sprays, epsom salts, and
various means of restoring lost
energy. Only three couples re-
mained to finish the contest.

 
 
  
  

ROBERT KLEIN
ZANY COMEDIAN

Robert Klein appeals to the college audience. ‚ÄúMaybe
its his ‚ÄúI'm one of you" appearance, his body contor-
tions that enhance his humor, or his own brand of
zany comedy with which most college individuals can
identify. His act combines, song, (a take‚Äîoff on 50's
rock and roll songs), music, (a harmonica redition of
old Civil War campfire ballads), and of course great one
liners, (Did you hear Johnny Cash's song for a commer-
cial for Preparation H? It's called ‚ÄúThe Burning Ring
of Fire.")

A stroke of genius by the Student Union
Board brought the Pitt Beer Festival
to students in Early March. Brewers
Stroh‚Äôs, Iron City, Schlitz, Genesse, and
Lowenbrau, uncorked the taps on their
wares for sampling. We had all tasted
(guzzled)? these beers before, but there
was something extra attractive about
lining up five beers in front of you and
samplin each one in succession. Then
with a sophisticated air of a true beer
devotee you claim ‚ÄúI like this one best",
and immediatley proceed to find where
you can get a whole pitcher of that
golden brew. The taps flowed, and for
one afternoon, everyone was all smiles
and good friends. Free trinkets, stickers,
posters, and t-shirts made the day pro-
fitable even for teatotalers.

The final main stage production of the
season was John Osborne's Look Back
In Anger. Directed by Richard Mennen,
the play describes social revolt in Eng-
land in the 1950's. William Wendt plays
Jimmy Porter, an angry young man
caught up in the social malaise of the
times. Relationships develop with two
women, Helena (Polly Bolton) and Allison
(Kate Young). The feelings of alienation
and personal isolation which pervade are
heightened by a black stage and a circle
lighting effect which seperates the char-
acters from the outside world. This in-
tensely emotional play, elicited strong
reaction by theatergoers, again proving
Pitt theater as a leader in Pittsburgh
area entertainment.

SUPER BOWL VICTORY
LEADS TO SUPER
CELEBRATION

Within minutes after the Pittsburgh Steelers had
trounced the Minnesota Vikings in the Super Bowl
January 12th, thousands of delerious fans swarmed
to the streets of Downtown Pittsburgh to celebrate
despite a snowstorm and freezing temperatures.
Casey Boylan, Pitt student, said, "Man, I feel like I've
waited 42 years for this. Downtown is where the action
is going to be and that's where I'm heading.‚Äù Indeed,
downtown was full of action as fans climbed a top
buses, street lights, cars, and buildings. An anything-
goes atmosphere prevailed through early hours . . .
Riot police stood by but didn't intrude . . . One cele-
brant said, "Hi copper‚Äù and the policeman returned
"Hi hippie freak". All was in fun. Later as the crowd
swelled, police swept Liberty Avenue clear and en-
couraged all to return home.

STEELER WIN

The Steeler Super Bowl victory over the Minnesota Vikings
touched off a spontaneous celebration which lasted until
late morning. By the next day, thousands of fans lined the
streets along a proposed parade route to honor their heroes.
The crowd sometimes broke ranks, sometimes got a bit over
boisterous, but face it, unless you read about it in an out
of town newspaper; it really wasn't all that bad.

DQWTQGMEZE

A University of Pittsburgh Theatre Production

In coordination with the
Theatre Department's se-
ries of plays concerning
social revolt, the production
of Pantaglieze was pre-
sented in March. The play
was bittersweet, a farce
to make you sad. It con-
cerned revolutionary po-
litical movements circa
1930's. Pantaglieze starred
Tom Siegel in the title role,
and co-starred Paul Binotto,
Buffalo Bromberg, Wayne
Claeren, Toby Beckwith,
Vito Zingerelli, Julie Quinio,
and Jay Silverma n.

KAPPA
ALPHA
THETA

Once there was a young woman who lived
in a cloud.

A stranger looked up and asked her why
she lived so high in the sky.

She answered, ‚ÄúHere in my cloud I can
look down to the earth and see the beauty
of the lush green grass and marvel at
the sunset.

I can see people working, playing, and
crying.

My cloud lets me see so many wonderous
things.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut why live in a cloud?" questioned the
stranger.

‚ÄúIsn't it much better to share and experi-
ence all that life has to offer rather than
just be content to watch?‚Äù The stranger
was a Theta who told the young woman of
the happiness and love of Kappa Alpha
Theta.

She brought her down to earth to learn
and live.

Soon they were no longer strangers, but
very good friends.

Barb Ewald and the KAT‚Äôs show their might in Derby Day contest.

‚ÄúShuffle Off to Buffalo" and ‚ÄúForty-Second Street" highlighted the Kappa's salute
to Ruby Keeler at Greek Sing.

Dear Mom,

How are you? I am fine. Remember that sorority I joined?
Theta Phi Alpha? Since then my entire life has changed. Every-
thing has been hectic and fun. I just experienced my first Greek
Week and it was great! At Pun-Night we took a second place. These
guys from Sigma Alpha Epsilon and Delta Sigma Phi are a real bunch
of game players! Anvway, for Greek Sing we did a "Tribute to Bar-
bra Streisand." We even got 100% participation for the Blood Drive
and I didn't even pass out...until I got back to my room. To end
that fantastic week the Greeks sponsored a formal at Howard John-
sons in Monroeville. Dave took me.

That was just Greek Week. All kinds of crazy things have
been happening all year. Angela tried to run her car through Amos
Hall after she couldn‚Äôt fit the space in the Quad. Julie fell down
the Quad steps and sprained her ank1e...the only good thing about
that was some motorcycle dude that saw her fall asked her out.
Linda tried to kick a football on the Cathedral lawn to show some
guys what a terrific athlete she was and she lost her shoe... it
landed on Fifth Avenue. Saturday night, Maryanne went to the Luna
incognito. I'll fill you in on that one later. Carm lost her
valuable starfish pin...a1most. Remember quiet, little, V.J.?
Well, she's been living in the center bedroom studying Organic
Chemistry for three weeks. Something tells me she's perfecting
a bomb t.oblow up her prof...I hear he‚Äò a creep.

Last night we went to a mixer. Sue come in screaming
obscenities about her boyfriend. God only knows which one. Mar-
cia floated in...a little too much beer, Heather paraded in with
one of her boyfriends, and Cetta never came in...oh yeah, she came
in with a couple ofother sisters who decided to have a pmnochele
marathon.

Enclosed is our sorority picture. No we don't act like
this all the time. We still have time for studying, ceremonies,
and friends...but we ARE having the time of our lives.

Take care. I'll be home soon for the summer.

Love,
A TPA Sister

UPI-P|TTSBURGH‚ÄîP|ans were an-

G. Bowman of the University of
Pittsburgh for a new educational
facility in his plans for expansion
of the urban campus. A 14-acre
plot of land, called Frick Acres,
has been purchased with the finan-
cial assistance of the Mellon Family
as the construction site.

UPI-PlTTSBURGH‚ÄîA ground break-
ing ceremony was held today to
begin construction on the new W
University structure. The ceremony ‚Äî:‚Äú
also kicked-off the fund-raising .I--
campaign in Pittsburgh which all ‚Äò "

filled the central areaway. Massive
stone walling, partially completed,
prevented the fire from spreading
into classrooms and offices filled
with expensive furnishings and
equipment. The firemen battled the
blaze in 22¬∞weather for over four
hours before it was brought under
control. Several firemen were taken
to area hospitals for smoke in-

halation, treated and released.
Damage was estimated at
$15,000.00.

UPI-PlTTSBURGH‚Äî After a long
delay period the Cathedral of Learn-
ing completion is now in sight.
Today the federal government an-
nounced that it will appropriate
$840,000 or 30% of the money
needed to complete the structure
started in 1926. This federal aid
will enable the continuation of
work long enough to complete the
exterior framework. Funds totaling
over $10 million have been put into
the building. Upon completion it will
contain 91 classrooms, 67 labor-
tories, 52 research labortories, 13
large lecture halls, 15 department
udies, 78 offices, the Faculty

~ and several student lounges.

SIGMA CHI

Sigma Chi . . . . . 4724 Bayard . . . . . 682-8655 Where
first class, full-time festering was founded. The home
of Norman Shield, fun and games, spirit, and parrrrdees.
A stone's throw from Haddon, Luna, Ritters and the
splash of Schenley Pond. The only house in town with
bunk water beds, an abuse tree, and the Sweetheart
of Sigma Chi. With teasers, fund raising functions, 23
Fall Pledges, grain punch, and toga parties a common
thing. Here brotherhood, blood drives, Little Sigmas and
mixers are happening. The Home of the Toilet Bowl
Champs and the Kings of Derby Day. Where one can find
a ‚Äúcake course‚Äù, a party with the crazies, pledge skits,
pinball machines, a pool table and beer‚Äîpong. And
statements as: ‚Äúget down, get down", ‚ÄúToad", ‚ÄúIn
your eye" and ‚ÄúIn Hoc Signovinces" are often heard.

I think I was hit by that truck over there!

Delta Phi has gone be-
yond the tradition‚Äîbound
stero‚Äîtype of a fraternity
‚Äîit's an alternative life
style. We are individuals
yet brothers, partiers yet
students, an important
part of campus life yet
in an off‚Äîcampus setting,
supporting the university
yet seeing room for im-
provement. In both the
social and academic
worlds at Pitt, diversity
and involvement are our
main goals.

TH ETA CHI They've Gotthecutest Little . . 

azaggaa

Theta Chi . . . more than just a fraternity. The local
chapter of the ‚ÄúUnited Nations" formed with a tight
brotherhood. A place where academics are stressed
as well as having a good time, (of course not in that
particular order). Parties, where if you didn‚Äôt have a
good time, your idea of fun must be shaking the
chancellor's hand at his freshmen reception for
students. Homecoming, a time to share past memories
with present ones. IFC intramurals are a chance to
be discovered by the WFL, San Diego Padres, or the
Philadelphia 76er's. Theta Chi has a lot to offer
an individual but you only get out of it what you
put into it. THETA CHl‚Äî‚Äîwe're not getting older, we're
getting better.

The name Triangle stands out in contrast to the
other Greek letter fraternities, emphasizing our
uniqueness. Our membership is offered to students
in engineering, architecture, and the physical
sciences. The result is a membership with common
educational goals‚Äîone where the individual finds
others working in fields similar to his own. Where
the emphasis is placed on a dedication to his chosen
profession, resulting in a stronger brotherhood

ZETA BETA TAU

Zeta Beta Tau Fraternity is one of the largest national
fraternities, consisting of more than 80 chapters
and colonies across the country. Locally our chapter
had a fine year, the highlight of which was a regional
football tournament that we sponsored. The tourna-
ment drew teams from ZBT Chapters in New York,
Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Virginia, and Indiana.
Following the games was a riotous band party, featuring
the antics of Dan ‚ÄúThe Moon" Padilla, a brother
from Calumet College, who likes to show off his better
side. While Dan was doing his thing, a few of the
brothers began contesting whose was longer. That
dubious distinction was won by a local brother whos
name shall remain anonymous.

We closed the book on 1975 with a post finals bash
that saw all the brothers celebrate in true Zeeb style.
Hopefully by September we will have recovered
sufficiently to start the year anew.

If the impulse towards self-preservation was as
instinctive all over the world as it is to Lambda
Sigma Rho, the Dodo bird would probably be alive
and well today. Lambda is the newest and possibly
the freshest group of guys on campus. (Bob Spack is
sticking to his story that he was merely following
a sexual impulse he got from the Johnny Carson
Show.) A few of our more stately members include
the son of the inventor of Preparation H, the Hyper-
ventilation champ of two years from Poughkeepsie,

N.Y., and Bill Klein on a full Zap Comix Scholarship. .

He is the only person who knows just how fast the
U.S.S. Enterprise can really go.

Lambda, always versatile, lost practically everything
by buying 500 Penguin-Flyer tickets to scalp at their
first Stanley Cup Playoff game. We made it all
back on 2 quarts of outrageous Electric Murine . . .
Three drops in each eye and you could see God as
he appeared in San Francisco in 1965.

were the Allen Ginsberg look-alike contest, the Miss
Dixie Chicken Pageant and six Checkered Demon Tum-

A CAMPUS
UNDER EXPANSION

 .

UPI-PITTSBURGH‚ÄîToday the child-

ren of the late H.J. Heinz have

decided to carry out their father's

will by commissioning the Heinz

- Memorial Chapel. The Heinz child-

ren do not intend the chapel to be

2. a church, but dedicated to all stu-

 dents at the University of Pitts-

‚Äò burgh as a non-sectarian symbol of

spirituality for the student to at-

L tend religious ceremonies in their
2 individual faiths.

 

UPl-PlTTSBURGH‚ÄîThe Heinz Me-

morial Chapel was dedicated today

after five years of construction

and at a cost of nearly a million

dollars. The French Gothic struc-

t re is a memorial to the late
_' J. Heinz and his mother Anna
"  rga retta.

‚ÄúOn certain levels of the human
race, there seems to be a positive
libido for the ugly, as on other and
less Christian levels there is a libido
for the beautiful. It is impossible
to put down the wallpaper that de-
faces the average American home
of the lower middle class to mere
inadvertance, or to the obsence
humor of the manufacturers. Such
ghastly designs, it must be ob-
vious, give a genuine delight to a
certain type of mind. They meet,
in some unfathomable way, its ob-
scure and unitelligible demands."

1974-75 was a year of ex-
pansion for WPGH. Program-
ming was extended to include
a wide range of public ser-
vice and special interest pro-
grams, a beefedup news for-
mat and a new music format
covering nearly all possible
areas of musical interest. Un-
der the cooperative leader-
ship of General Manager Joe
DeStio and Program Manager
Jim Gardener, the station took
on a somewhat new and dif-
ferent image as a medium
specifically designed accord-
ing to the interests of Pitt
Students.

Future plans include expan-
sion to the Tuck Shop, Rec
Halls. The ultimate aim is for
WPGH to become an FM sta-
tion. Whichever alternative is
accomplished, the members
of WPGH are committed to
making the station something

interest and come from all segments of the uni-
versity; Greeks, Engineers, Nurses, Blacks, and
Socialists. Yet, their prime concern is YOU, the
PITT student, for they are your representatives
and watchdog over all academic, economic and
recreational interests that you persue.

Their governing influence and knowledge of re-
sources has already let them make their mark in
Pitt history. This year they have burst forward in
an attack against: rising tuition with S.T.A.R.T.
U.P. Day, setting up a guide to apartment living
in Oakland and the vicinity, checking the alloca-
tions‚Äô move on all university organizations, and
being very active in the Pennsylvania and National
Student Lobbies.

Craig Bluestein, Janet Nicholson (Secretary), Dan Stiffler,
Jamie Mclntyre (Parliamentarian), Mark Satinoff.

The rest of the year has an executive gambit of
plans to better the university and the community
at large. May was the kick-off month for the fol-
lowing goals of this years SGB: establishment of a
University Food Co-op Service, revision of the Un-
dergraduate Academic Review, publication of a
Student Directory and an Activities Review Book,
assistance and literature on the problem of Fi-
nancal Aid, and the resumption of the printing
of the Freshman Registrar.

But most of all, this years‚Äô Student Government
Board wants to be looked back upon as a Com-
plaint-Resolution Center; a place where students
can go to air out their problems without fear of
them receiving a royal hassle for it. By broden-
ing our public relations‚Äô attitudes and opinions,
we have aroused students to what is happening at
PITT without letting them feel helpless in time
of need.

teaching children. Our aim in conducting various
projects in the schools is to discover, define, and
attempt to deal with the problem areas in educa-
tion found in the urban schools. Our organization
members, as students at Pitt, also suggest pos-
sible curriculum changes which might enhance the
University's effectiveness as an educator of teach-
ers. Thus, we exist to provide more realistic and
useful exposure for future teachers, to aid the
school system in defining and solving some of its
problems, and to give greater experience to mem-
bers working with children.

PITT HOSTS

A Pitt Host is a vital link between the university
of Pittsburgh and prospective freshmen. We pro-

questions both academic and non-academic that
the student or parents may have. This is the only
chance one receives during the admissions pro-
cedure to tour the excellent facilities here at Pitt.
The Pitt Hosts are a positive realistic, organization
that aids this university in it's recruitment
program.

There are at least four areas in which the Pitt Host
are involved. First, it benefits the admissions office
to provide tours after interviews, Secondly, it aids
public relations. The information asked a Pitt Host
is from a wide spectrum of topics, and is public
relation oriented. Thirdly, it helps the student af-
fairs office with their orientation of freshman stu-
dents. Finally, it helps the undergraduate schools
to recruit better students for the university
community.‚ÄîJeffrey H. Chaby, Pres.

In 1890, twelve young men from
the Pitt campus organized them-
selves into what they called the
‚ÄúBanjo and Mandolin Club." Eighty-
five years later, and now known as
the ‚ÄúUniversity of Pittsburgh
Men's Glee Club," the group con-
sists of forty‚Äîfive students selected
from all segments of the university.
The oldest extra-curricular activity
on the campus, the Glee Club at
Pitt includes men from many states
and countries who take pride in
representing eighty‚Äîfive years of
university tradition, a tradition of
spirits, camaraderie, and love of
song. And now, the Glee Club in-
vites you to share with them, the
joy ofmusic.

One of the smaller groups of the Glee Club is our Barbershop group. They call themselves the
‚ÄúPITT TUNES‚Äù, and they perform at all major concerts, plus any other bizarre functions
where.they can show off. These Men of Song are: Jack McNutt, Warren Hutchinson, Ritchie

Borz, Steve Tarnock, Dave Hammer, Les Weiss, and Mark Musmanno.

Concert with Washington and Lee University‚Äôs
Men's Glee Club. From this concert we have

For 63 years, Women's Choral has been rep-
resenting the University of Pittsburgh through
its musical performances on campus, in Oak-
land and the surrounding communities, and at
various colleges and universities. Under the
direction of Ms. Patricia Crosby, the Choral
has a musical repertoire that is diversified,
appealing to almost anyone's taste. Past
selections sung in concerts included works
by Claude DeBussey, Franz Schubert, Duke
Ellington, and Dory Previn.

During the 1974-1975 concert season, Wo-
men's Choral first sang at Lantern Night, the
official welcoming of Freshmen women to the
University of Pittsburgh. In December, the
Choral travelled to Ohio for a joint Christmas
Concert with the Glee Club of John Carroll
University. Later in the year the group hosted
Washington and Lee University‚Äôs Men's Glee
Club, who joined the Choral in presenting
their Annual Spring Concert.

A highlight of the year was a joint concert
presented with the University of Pittsburgh's
Men's Glee Club in a Spring Concert held at
Stephen Foster Memorial. As a part of this
concert, the Choral performed staged num-
bers from the musical ‚ÄúO|iver", as well as
‚ÄúMood Indigo" and the well-known Joe GarLand
arrangement of ‚ÄúIn The Mood‚Äù, as sung by
Bette Midler.

Future plans for broadening our horizons are
to widen and expand our touring schedule,
to work at enhancing and increasing our mem-
bership and recognition at the University, to
sponsor a special Bicentennial Concert to ful-
fill the mood of the Spirit of '76, and to pos-
sibly plan some excellent programs in conjunc-
tion with the University‚Äôs Women's Studies
Department.

The Studio Theatre Organization is one which pro-
vides anyone in the University community the op-
portunity to produce theatrical works. Consisting
mainly of undergraduate students, this theatre or-
ganization emphasizes education in the ways and
means of theatre production. The types of shows
built and performed have ranged from Greek classics
to works by contemporary authors. The theatre
facility itself is a free space, technically we|l‚Äîequipped.
Because of its architectural design, the space beauti-
fully lends itself to design and performance of theatre
pieces of an experimental nature. All of the technical
aspects of production from costume, light, sound
and set design, to the sewing of seams, flipping of
switches, winding of tape and hammering of nails
are handled by students, often accompanied by ad-
vice and manpower from interested members of the
faculty of the Theatre Arts Department. The Theatre
and organization are open to any student. lt‚Äôs fun
and a lot of hard work, but everyone learns; about

Eta Kappa E11

While one if its purposes certainly is the
stimulation and reward of scholarship, Eta
Kappa Nu has a far broader purpose than
merely to award a badge of distinction to
scholars. As conceived by its founders and
as carried forward by its membership dur-
ing more than two generations, another
aim is to assist its members throughout
their lives in becoming better men in
their chosen field as well as better citi-
zens. In turn, it is still another purpose
of the organization, that its members be a
constructive, force, helping fellow mem-
bers and non-members alike to improve
the standards of the profession the courses
of instruction, and the institutions gen-
erally where its chapters are located. Each
chapter is carrying out these ideals in the
manner best fitted to its individual needs
and opportunities.

 

Kappa Kappa Psi is a National
Honorary Band Fraternity for col-
lege and university bands. Its pri-
mary purpose is to help build better
bands on campus, and thus it acts
primarily as a service organization
to the Band. Its service activities
range from administrative duties
to the actual operation of the Band.
The Fraternity also offers a social
aspect to the Brothers with acitivi-
ties planned throughout the year.

By combining the service and so‚Äî.

cial activities the Fraternity offers
the opportunity for the Brothers to
both broaden their education and to

become more involved in campus
life.

benefits a fraternal society offers

FRANKLIN PANGBORN
FILM SOCIETY

The Franklin Pangborn Film Society serves several functions.
We show several film series. We have the conventional Satur-
day night series that usually includes recent Hollywood
features that are released for campus showing, this part is
mainly for entertainment purposes. We also show a Film
Arts series consisting mostly of Award Winning Foreign
Films that are more obscure and artistic in nature. Thirdly,
we also intermittenly show an Experimental Film Series.
Usually it shows a visual experience and an educational pur-
pose of filmmaking and visual perception. In addition, our
club makes films, provides film equipment and tries to
interest the college community into realizing the impor-
tance and art of film in our society today.

CHEEDLEADEDS

The 1974-75 Pitt Cheerleading
Squad consisted of six males
and six females. The Pitt Pan-

, ther is also part of the squad.

The main goal of the cheer-
leaders is to increase spirit
and student participation in
backing the Pitt Athletic
teams. We participate in foot-
ball and basketball games and
also homecoming, public re-
lations, and recruiting for the
football team. We cheered at
all home games and some of
us got to go to some away
games. We held rallies at the
airport to greet the players
when they returned from away
games. During basketball
season, we cheered at the
games and also decorated the
locker room. We only travel-
led to the Penn State and West
Virginia games and the ECAC
tournament, but not to the
NIT in New York. One of the
highlights of the year came
in January of 1975 when the
ICF (International Cheer Foun-
dation) honored Vicki Veltri
as an all-American Cheer-
leader, first team. Vicki was
one of only six cheerleaders
in the country given this
award. The other five cheer-
leaders were from UCLA, Ala-
bama, Notre Dame and USC.
We‚Äôre very proud of Vicki and
hope that future Pitt Cheer-
leaders will strive for the
Award.

The 1974-1975 Pantherette
Drill Team had a very suc-
cessful year. During foot-
ball season they actively
participated in various
Spirit‚Äîraising activities such
as pep-rallies and the Snake
at the football games. The
group also were hostesses
at the recruit dinners. Dur-
ing basketball season the
Drill team made new uni-
forms and added sparkle to
the games and the half‚Äîtime
performances. Next year the
group will be working with
the band and will be on the
field for all pre-game and
half‚Äîtime activities. The girls
really are devoted to the
group and their main con-
cern was to bring back
spirit and enthusiam.

is to provide a channel for students and faculty
interested in the outdoors to meet and enjoy it
together. The club participates in a variety of
activities ranging from rafting,

HISTORY FORUM

The Undergraduate History Forum is an organiza-
tion of history majors as well as those interested
in‚Äòthe subject although pursuing other careers.
It unfolds history in a way that makes it come alive.
The Forum accommodates interests in all types of
history‚Äîmi|itary, American, European or Asian.
Past programs included a tour to the Archives of an
Industrial Society and speakers included Maureen
Greenwald, Harold Simms, Samuel Hays and Irving
Bantlett. The hope of the History Forum is that the
students involved will find that history is more than
a classroom study, but an extracurricular disci-
pline in conjunction with the historians in the
departments. The Forum helps helps to expand and
unfold history and its related disciplines in a more
understandable and meaningful way than is often
encountered in a classroom environment.

ENVIRONMENTAL ACTION CLUB

The Environmental Action Club was founded to unite
all interested members of the University of Pittsburgh
in working to promote and preserve a better environ-
ment. Since its organization in the Winter of 1974,
the club has been involved in many projects designed
to promote awareness and understanding of the varied
aspects of environmental concerns. Included were
several air pollution studies, a radiation study, a nature

hike on the Harmony Trail, Earth Week activities and a
cleanup of Panther Hollow. A major project was a paper
recycling program for Pitt. Over 2‚Äò/2 tons of newsprint
were collected in seven weeks. Weekly meetings feature
speakers from environmental groups in the Pittsburgh
area and films of ecological interest. Future plans in-
clude another cleanup of Panther Hollow, can re-
cycling, and more environmental studies.

BAHAI CLUB

The Bahai Club promoted and fur-
thers the ideals of the Bahai faith
as proclaimed by the prophet
founder, Bahaullah. The unity of
the human race implied the es-
tablishment of a world common-
wealth in which all nations, races,
creeds and classes are closely and
permanently united, and in which
the autonomy of its state mem-
bers and the personal freedom and
initiative of the individuals that
compose them are definitely and
completely safeguarded. The Bahai
Faith inculcated the principle of
equal opportunity, rights and priv-
ileges for both sexes, advocates
compulsory education, propose a
spiritual solution to economic pro-
blems, exalts work performed in

 

Houshmand Khosravi Freeman Porter, Dorothy Hai,Sammander Hai the Spirit of service to the ram‚Äò of
worship, and advocates world
peace.

CHRISTIAN SCIENTISTS

The Christian Science Organiza-
tion at the Univ. of Pittsburgh holds

Christ Jesus, the biblical prophets,
and writers, and Mary Baker Eddy,
the discoverer and founder of Chris-
tian Science. ln January we spon-
sored a public lecture on Christian

The University of Pittsburgh at Johnstown
offers the ‚Äúpersonalized‚Äù education of a
small college combined with prestige of
ties with a metropolitan university. 'ohns-
town campus which emcompasses a 500 acre
area with a 13 building complex is a suburban
campus, yet it is within five miles of the city
of Johnstown. There are approximately 2,300
students. The smaller classes offer more
personal attention which builds stronger
student‚Äîteacher ties. There are year round
recreation facilities within easy traveling
distance and varied programs and activities
on campus.

UNIVERSITY or
  PITTSBURGH AT
GREENSBURG

The University established a campus at Greensburg to
bring to the residents of Westmoreland, Fayette,
Washington, and surrounding western Pennsylvania
counties a cross section of the total educational
facilities of a major university. The Greensburg
Campus provides a basic and expanding program of
undergraduate courses offered both during the day
and in the evening for 350 full-time and 650 part-time
students.

In addition to area students, those from other parts
of Pennsylvania and other states and foreign countries
bring a cosmopolitan atmosphere to the campus. While
sharing the University‚Äôs commitment to excellence,
the student at Greensburg also enjoy the advantages
of a small personalized campus.

The fu||‚Äîtime program during the day on the Greensburg
Campus gives the student an opportunity to complete
the first four terms of work in either the College of
Arts and Sciences or Engineering or the first two and
one-half terms in Nursing. After completing four terms
at Greensburg, he may enter his junior year at the
University's Oakland (Pittsburgh) Campus without loss I I "M 
of time or credit or he may transfer to another four- I . T?"  
year institution.

The Science Building. now under construction, will be completed by 1976. It will contain labs for biology. Chemistry, physics, and engineering.

Powers Hall, a multi-purpose structure which was completed library collection. The building also provides three classrooms
during the school year, will be used temporarily to house UPG's andaseminar room.

UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT TITUSVILLE

332

The transition from a high school curriculum and
surroundings to the atmosphere of a large metropolitan
university can be an experience pleasant to remember
or a very difficult one. In 1963, the University of Pitts-
burgh, in cooperation with the community of Titusville,
provided the opportunity for students of northwestern
Pennsylvania to participate in a university level program
close to home. The undergraduate program at Titusville
provides the basic courses for the first one or two years
of university level study.

The campus in Titusville is located on the former
McKinney Estate, which provides a wooded setting for
the prinicpal campus buildings. Classrooms and admin-

istration offices are located in McKinney Hall. The
Iaboratories tor physics, chemistry, and biology are
in the Bennett Davis Memorial Laboratory Building. Just
east of the main campus uulldlng IS the student union
where reading, recreation rooms and a snack bar, as
well as studyand conference rooms, are provided. The
library building is adjacent to McKinney Hall while the
University dormitories and dining hall facilities are two
blocks east of McKinney Hall. One of the dormatories
houses 156 male students. The other accommodates
96 women in the latest dormitory concept of se|f-con-
tained town house-style apartments.

 

UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT BRADFORD

One of the University of Pittsburgh's four regional
campuses, the University of Pittsburgh at Bradford was
first opened in September, 1963. The Bradford Campus,
a fully accredited part of the University, provides the
freshman and sophomore years of the University
courses by offering a cross section of the total educa-
tional programs of the Oakland Campus located in Pitts-
burgh. The academic standards and the sequence of
couses are the same at both places. Thus, a student
at the Bradford Campus has the advantage of being
enrolled in a small college and yet enrolled in a na-
tionally known university. Students receive the indivi-
dual attention a small school can offer and the academic
training characteristic of a university distinguished
for its scholastic standing.

The Bradford campus is currently developing an attrac-

tive 115-acre tract of land on the outskirts of Bradford. '

The development is proceeding in a manner which pre-
serves Bradford's natural setting, edged by forest
covered mountains. Seven apartment style residence
facilities housing 300 students were recently opened,
creating an English village type environment in this
picturesque valley campus. A student union-cafeteria
building is located nearby. Hamsher House, Bradford's
academic center, provides laboratories, classrooms,
Computer Center, and administrative offices while the
physical education program is carried on in the new
million-dollar YMCA, staffed by University faculty.
Students use these facilities thoughout the year.

The University of Pittsburgh at Bradford offers students
a wide variety of experiences that may contribute to
their total personal development. There is an oppor-
tunity for friendly and informal exchanges between
students and faculty, not only in the classroom, but also
in social situations on and off the campus. The campus
encourages the students to enjoy a well-rounded cam-

pus life, balancing study with informal social contacts,
responsible community action, and recreation. The
Bradford Campus offers intercollegiate as well as
intramural sports programs. Interested students form
other athletic clubs, while other student organizations
include a radio, bowling, hockey, engineering, photo,
ski, and drama clubs.

Perhaps the best way to evaluate my four years
at the University is to compare what I was like,
and how I felt after high school graduation, with
the way I am now.

In June, 1971 I graduated from a small Catholic
girls school. Like most ‚ÄúBig‚Äîfish‚Äîin-a‚Äîsma|l~pond", I
thought I was ‚Äúhot stuff" and prepared for any-
thing. Unfortunately, that was not true, and I
made a lot of mistakes. These mistakes taught
me perhaps the most valuable lesson of my
college years~‚Äîin order to succeed, you must
decide what you want, then go after it with all
the grit and determination you can muster. I
still have a hard time sticking to that rule.
However, whenever I analyze why I did not
succeed at something, it can usually be attributed
to a lack of perseverence and will power. Emily
Dickinson wrote,

‚ÄúThe heroism we espouse

would beadailything,

Did not ourselves the cubits warp

forfearto beaking."

Most students, most of the time lay the blame for
their failure on ‚Äúpoor professors, lousy texts,
work, etc." I have found however, that with few
exceptions the seeds of failure lie within me. If
for nothing else, I am grateful to the University
for having taught me that important lesson, for
now I know who my ‚Äúadversary" is, and how to
deal with her.

UPI-PlTTSBURGH‚Äî-It was five
years ago today. June 27, 1970,
that the Pittsburgh Pirates played
their last game at Forbes Field.
Now Forbes Field is gone and a new
40-million dollar project named the
Professional Quadrangle has taken

its‚Äô place. The complex will include

huge areas of space which at pre-
sent are unassigned. All that is
known for sure is that the complex

will include lecture halls, pedestrian
bridges to Hillman Library, escala-
tors, a bank of elevators and two
elevations of parking garages to
alleviate the parking problems in the
campus area. Weather and excava-
tion problems have been hamper-
ing construction, but hopefully it
will meet the completion date set
in 1977.

Jann Torrance:

Pitt is a large university that provides
a kaliedescipe of activities and organi-
zations to its students that are willing
to provide the initiative to become in-
volved. Due to its diversity and size,
there is no ‚Äúideal" student leader.
Therefore, interest and a sense of respon-
sibility are the only requirements neces-
sary to get involved on campus. One of the
unique qualities of Pitt is that its re-
sources are always available but never
dominate the collegiate environment.
The wide range of daily activities how-
ever indicate an ever increasing level
of participation by the students, both
at undergraduate and graduate levels.

WOMEN'S STATUS
IMPROVED

In 1869 Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Lu-
cretia Mott came together in Seneca Falls
N.Y. forming the National Women's Suf-
ferage Association. From that time on wo-
men across the nation fought for voting
rights. Finally in 1920 Congress passed
the Women's Sufferage Amendment. But
the fighting didn't stop with the right to
vote, women all over the world wanted
equal rights. In Pittsburgh women lobbied
for the use of the voting machine. A wo-
men, Mrs. J.O. Miller chaired the committee
that won voting machines for Pittsburgh.
In November 1929 Francis Rethey of Bud-
apest visited Pittsburgh and organized the
first Hungarian Women's League.

Later that same year Miss Christabel
Pankhurst, daughter of the late Emmeline
G. Pankhurst militant sufferagist from
Britain came to Pittsburgh advocating wo-
men's rights through religious prophecy.

During the 1960's, women comprised 40%
of the Nation's workforce and still did
not have equal rights. Finally in 1972,
The Equal Rights Amendment was passed
saying ‚Äúsex had no effect on equality
of rights under the law.‚Äù

This year July 1975, Mexico City held
the first United Nations International Con-
ference for women. The theme of the con-
ference was equality, development, and
peace, but the delegates believe that these
goals cannot be reached until the Middle
East disputes have been solved.

ECONOMY
SUFFERS
UPS AND DOWNS

in November 1929 there was an unexpected
and mysterious break in stock prices. Some
of the leading stocks dropped 10 to 30
dollars a share. Soon farmers, textile
manufacturers and coal-miners com-
plained of poor working conditions and low
wages. By 1930, some of the wealthiest
fortunes were wiped‚Äîout and thousands of
workers lost their jobs. The depressed U.S.
economy was plagued with widespread
credit which caused banks to fail and
foreclosures on mortgages leaving people
homeless.

In 1975 the United States was hit again,
but this time by a recession. Prices were
inflating and wages stayed the same while
unemployment reached 10% nationwide.
In Pittsburgh, Jones and Laughlin Pitts-
burgh Works were forced to close down and
other large mills were forced to |ay‚Äîoff
hundreds of workers. Not only did factory
workers feel the crunch but students look-
ing for work found jobs scarce. This year
Pitt students will have to contend with a
$70 tuition hike per term and also in-
creases in housing, books and other
supplies.

SPECIFICATIONS

I like entertainment. Give me a show that runs smoothly;
one in which it is apparent that extra time, effort, and
money were spent to produce a spectacle that is
thoroughly crowd pleasing. I'm the kind of person that
wouldn't pay 25¬¢ to watch a pisant pull a freight train
if it wasn't done with a proper showmanship flair. I
appreciate the extras, the added touches that didn't have
to be done, but were.

I like a year book that's entertaining. I like a yearbook
that's fun to read, to page through, even though I've
never seen that particular college or know anyone who
is a student there. Most yearbooks unfortunately are
bland, like a grade B movie. They lack ‚Äúcolor", warmth,
the added touches of design and of speaking directly
to the reader. All too often one sees the square-picture-
on-a-white-page format of mechanical campus scenes.
The 1975 Owl has been an attempt to entertain, a sort
of ‚Äúputtin' on the ritz" in yearbooks. We drew a lot
from top current magazine styles although all layouts
are original conceptions. Graphics, art, and design
figured heavily in the concept of the book. Becuase of
the abundance of original art, the book has been copy-
righted to protect the Owl's exclusive use of these works.
I hope everyone finds the 1975 Owl as enjoyable to
read as it was to create.

‚ÄîDave Sheluga
Editor 1975 Owl

416

The specs on the 1975 Owl are as follows: This 416
page edition was printed at the State College, Penna.
plant of Jostens/American Yearbook Company with a
limited edition press run of 1100 copies. The type style
is News Gothic with Headlines in News Gothic Con-
densed. Special heads are Letraset and Format transfer
types, and although there were numerous styles, the
most widely used were Letraset Broadway and Roco. The
opening section is brown ink on Hammermill ivory
stock and the remainder of the book is Gloss Enamel.
Our cover is a Tru-Life Litho from original artwork
by Walter Yablonski and Robert Plata. Janusz Einhorn
is responsible for the cover concept and he also did the
divider page art. The movie stars in the Greek Week
section are by Randy Choura and all remaining art
was by staff artists Robert Einhorn and Kitty Martin.
Photographs were by student photographers and the
color is Type C reflective prints, custom processed
from Ektachrome slides/internegs by Filmet Color Lab
of Pittsburgh. The senior photos were done by Stevens
Studios of Bangor Maine. Photos appearing on pages
8-64 are from the Carnegie Photo Library. All layout
concepts by the Editor.

‚ÄúLadies and gentlemen, only fashion can defy
the Wall Street Crash and the Great Depression.
The bold march of style includes Vionnet's bias
cut dresses and Schiapare|li's padded shoulders.
Coats are in step with the military, represented
by the masculine Chesterfield, the camel's hair,
even the Persian lamb is black or gray.

The streets have been invaded with the dirndl
skirt, the cloche cape, the popular shirtwaist,
and off-shoulder and bare-back evening gowns.
And the ‚Äòpiece de resistance‚Äô, headgear of course
conquers the fashion front. Heads are sporting
berets, turbans, Eugenies, and pill boxes.

It's all so deliciously stark and simple. If only
there were ration cards for a silver fox . . 

‚ÄúNow we have a generation in denim, doing
their own thing. The look is always changing
to suit the tastes of the individual. Campuses
are crowded with anything from work shirts
and overalls to glitter shirts and double knits.
A nostalgia craze is here, and the jazz genera-
tion look has returned. Gatsby hair, beIow-the-

knee skirts, and halter gowns reveal an art
deco revival."

UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH VOLUME 70

DIARY OF A LONG
DISTANCE COMMUTER

There are several thousand commuters at Pitt,

Every night they pray through the bus ride they make it home.
We should admire these courageous young souls,

No matter what happens, getting to class are their goals.
They stand at the bus stop soaked in the rain,‚Äô

The bus passes them by, a 15 minute wait again,

Their books are splattered with rain and mud,

Their lunch bag soaked through, their apple falls ‚Äúthud‚Äù.
Their clothes are soggy and rain-spotted through,
Because their trusty umbrella has a hole in it too.

Finally their bus screeches to a stop,

Drop in the money, into a seat they flop.

The trip is almost over, maybe their luck has changed,
Then they discover their bus route has been rearranged.
At last the bus clamors to a stop, driver opens the door,
In immediate reaction their books fall on the floor,

Only five minutes til class as the bus pulls away.

This was a memorable day.

No time to put books in the locker, to check a mistaken grade,
Just time to run to the third floor Cathedral, they have it made.

They tear up the stairs and fling open the door,
Their class has been cancelled . . . . . why say more!

This was the first of 666 Streamliner trollys made for Pittsburgh

between 1936 and 1949 beginning the Commuter Age in Pitt history.

A SEASON OF PRIDE
AND

Two years ago Pitt football fans
could prabably hear a bottle drop
during a game. Today, such sereni-
ty does not exist. Though this is
only Coach Majors second year at
Pitt, the attitudes of the fans have
not only turned around, they have
been amplified with unison chants
of ‚Äúdefense" or ‚ÄúDorsett", with
larger and larger signs and of
course, the ever increasing number
of fans. Last year there was a per

game increase of over 12,000 fans
at the stadium.

Obviously, there was a good reason
for all this excitment; the ‚ÄúMajor
Change in Pitt Football". The team
itself provided the impetus for a
thrilling game. Repeatedly. the
Panthers turned risky situations in-
to advantages. Together, the fans
and the players helped to make
this ‚Äúa season of Pride and
Enthusiasm."

A WIN IS A
WIN IS A WIN

Coming off the first winning season
in ten years, Pitt's football team
prepared to start its 1974 campaign
in full gear. The first stop was
Florida State. Finishing their last
season with a 0-11 record, the
Seminoles weren't considered a
great threat. On the other hand,
the Panthers were nothing to get
excited about either, after the re-
sult ofthe game.

Things looked bad for Pitt at the
start. FSU took the opening kick-
off and in 10 plays drove 75 yards
for a score. Running back Larry
Key kept the drive moving carry-
ing the ball 45 yards in 5 plays.
Rudy Thomas added 17 yards and
then caught a 5 yard pass from
quarterback Ron Coppess for a
score. Kicker, Ahmet Askin missed
the X-point.

After this first drive the rest of
the game was a seesaw battle. The
Seminoles barely got a chance to
scratch the Panther‚Äôs territory,
while Pitt, although moving "the
ball, just could not put points on
the score board.

However Pitt did win and the vic-
tory stemmed from a FSU fumble.
Coppess was hit hard by middle
lnebacker Al Romano and Glen
Hodge recovered the ball on the
FSU 17. Then the Dorsett & Daniels
Co. came in and scored in 3 plays.
Dorsett went over the top for the
T.D. Carson Long came in, but
like his two earlier field goal at-
tempts, he was unable to put the
ball through the uprights. Thus, the
half-time score was 6-6. ‚Äò

Recieving the kick-off for Pitt Bob
Haygood returned the ball to the
FSU 39. Again the offense had a
chance to score but could not. Now
the Panthers turned to Long. His
39 yard attempt was up and good.
Pitt went ahead 9-6 to win the
game.

PANTHERS WRECK
GEORGIA TECH

Pitt‚Äôs unimpressive victory over
FSU, left the fans very doubtful.
The inexperience of the front line
was probably the reason for the
sluggish offense. But, whatever the
reason, the offense that played
FSU was not the same one that
played Georgia Tech.

In the opening minutes of the
game, Pitt's defense halted the
Tech wishbone attack and forced
them to punt from their 39. Re-
cieving the ball, Moorehead scamp-
ered from Pitt‚Äôs 16 to Tech‚Äôs 14,
a 70 yard return. Four plays later,
Daniels plunged into the endzone
from the one. Long came in and his
kickwas good.

On their next possession, Tech per-
fectly executed the wishbone at-
tack, and sustained a 77 yard drive.
Halfback Pat Moriarity carried 42
yards including 7 for the score.

The Panthers were not alarmed by
the quick Tech TD and in response,
Pitt scored again. Dorsett carry-
ing most of the time, climaxed the
drive with a dazzeling 20 yard run.
This time Long's X-point kick was
wide. This left the score at 13-7
with Pitt leading to end the half.

The Pitt offense hit a lull in the
third quarter. This gave Georgia
Tech an oppertunity to gain some
ground. Dave Simms, a Tech back,
powered his way through the Pitt
defense and scored. The X-point
was good. Tech led 14-13.

It was in the 4th quarter that
Pitt won the game. First, Dorsett
climaxed another drive with his
second TD. Then the defense pre-
vented a Tech score by forcing
them to kick a field goal. Finally,
the last Pitt drive assured a Pan-
ther victory. Bruce Murphy, in a
crowd of defenders, grabbed a pass
from Daniels for Pitt‚Äôs fourth TD.
The final score was 27-17. Pitt had
its second victory.

Johnny Majors has generated a sort of
enthusiasm in Pitt football that has revived
such traditions as the pep rally. For the big
game against eventual national champs
Southern California, an afternoon pep rally
drawing a couple thousand studnets, and
a more or less spontaneous nite time rally
brought pre-game expectations to a fever
pitch.

Majors has been extremely satisfied with
the fan support calling the Temple game
one of the finest shows of student enthu-
siasm he has seen.

T.D. EAST

What a scenarino! Two of
the finest running backs
in the game, perhaps 
heading for ‚Äúa||-timer"
status, meeting in a ti-
tantic struggle. It was
born a year ago when
Dorsett a mere freshmen,
took those first electri-
fying steps in his debut
in Georgia. For football,
he had run before he had learned
to walk. And then, before Pitt's
big turn around under Coach
Johnny Majors had really begun,
fans were saying ‚Äúwait till next
year, Dorsett and Davis.‚Äù A year
in the making, with a cast of
two. It was the kind of thing that
issues from fevered brains in
Hollywood, a thing made in foot-
ball heaven, the confrontation of
the year. (Pittsburgh Post
Gazette.)

And that's the way it was at pre-
game. TD-East, Tony Dorsett of
Pitt versus TD-West, Anthony Da-

  
 

vis of Southern Cal. Although these
galloping halfbacks are seperated
by thousands of miles, they have
alot in common. Last year they both
gained All-American status, and
over a thousand yards. They were
selected to the pre-season Playboy
All-American team and are ex-
pected to break individual school
records at this Saturday's game.
About the only difference between
the two is that Dorsett is a soph-
more and Davis is a senior.

Dorsett needs only 23 yards to

T.D. WEST

break Marsall Goldberg's
all-time rushing record.
This mark was set way
back in 1938 when Gold-
berg ended his college
football career with 1,957
yards. Davis is looking to
break O.J. Simpson's rec-
ords for total number of
points scored and for
total number of touch-
downs made by one player. Davis
needs only one TD to break these
records.

When the two teams entered the
stadium, the fans became hyster-
ical, but after the start of the
game the fans quieted down to
watch USC stomp Pitt. Davis was
the victor, carrying the ball 33
times for 149 yards and a TD.
Dorsett carried 15 times for 59.
After the game, Davis met Dor-
sett on the field and remarked,
‚Äúyou sure do look like Flip
Wilson."

‚ÄúWe just took a good ass-whipping,"
remarked Coach Majors after being
beaten by the North Carolina Tar-
heels. The game will not be an easy
one to forget.

Pitt got its first score after winning
the toss and taking the opening
kick-off for an 83 yard march in 14
plays. Dorsett carried the ball in
from the three.

North Carolina came right back
driving to the Pitt 43. Then, Tar-
hell quarterback Kupee, unloaded a
bombto JimmyJerome foraTD.

The Panthers on their next pos-
session found themselves deep in
their own territory and forced to
punt. Punter, Larry Swider tried
to catch the low snap from center,
but dropped it. He was tackled on
Pitt 2 yard line. The very next
play NC carried the ball over for
ascore.

Pitt set up for the kick-off. Bob
Haygood recieved the ball and re-
turned it 49 yards. Daniels came
in and on the option play, kept
the ball and galloped 48 yards for
another Panther TD.

The Tarheeels completed another
drive making the score 20-14. Time
remained in the first half so Pitt
started another drive. Again, Hay-
good returned the kick-off for 29
yards. The offense moved down the
field. Completing a pass to Murphy
put the ball on the NC 9. Then
itt was Daniels to Farmer who made
a diving catch inside the left cor-
ner of the endzone. This gave Pitt
its half time lead of 21-20.

In the third quarter NC blew Pitt
off the field by making three suc-
cessive touchdowns to make the
score NC 42‚ÄîPitt 21.

The Pitt defense controlled the NC
offense and only allowed them one
field goal. Pitt on the other hand
scored when Walker broke away for
a 80 yard TD. Thus NC won the
game, 45-29.

MOUNTIES GUNNED
DOWN 31-14

This Saturday's game marked the 67th
meeting of the Pitt Panthers and the
West Virginia Mountaineers. This was
also the turning point for the Cats,
for they not only won this game, but
the next fourto come.

In the first half the Panthers made the
mistakes which cost them the half
time lead. First, Weatherington was
thrown out of the game for fighting.
This penalty sustained the WVU drive
which ended several plays later.

It was Daniels and Dorsett who got
the Cats moving. With the ball in their
possession, the offense drove 77 yards
ending with Daniels‚Äô sneaking into the
end zone from the one. Long's kick
was good, the score was tied.

Pitt's next mistake was due to a rough-
ing‚Äîthe‚Äîkicker penality. The Mounties
now had possession of the ball on
the Pitt 38. A few end arounds and a
9 yard pass to Marshall Mills gave
WVU its 2nd TD and the lead for the
half.

In the second half the Mounties
were literally blown off the Pitt
field. About the middle of the third
quarter, Daniels engineered a 66 yard
drive in 11 plays. With Long's kick,
the score was tied 14-14.

The WVU defense broke down in the
fourth quarter. They gave up a 41
yard field goal by Long, then Daniels
hit Farmer for a 41 yard touch‚Äîdown
pass and finally Pitt's last drive,
perpetuated by Dorsett‚Äôs running,
ended on a 10 yard strike to Todd
Toerper for the score. This made
the final score 31-14. Majors was
very happy at the end of the game
and showed his contentment by saying
it was a ‚ÄúWonderful game."

BURLEY DEFENSE
SMOTHERS B.C.

An enthusiastic Boston College
team invaded Pitt Stadium with
hopes of an upset. But dreams
sometimes do not come true as
Pitt down BC 35-11.

The Panthers wasted no time at
all. On their first possession Daniels
drove the squad 80 yards with Dor-
sett making the touchdown. BC
came back but was only able to
manage a 52 yard feild goal. Then
in the second quarter, Murphy
romped into the endzone with an
11 yard pass to climax a 59 yard
drive.

Pitt's defense was outstanding
throughout the game. The team
was led by Gary Burley and Arnie
Weatherington who repeatedly
sacked the BC quarterback.

In the second half Dorsett broke
away twice for runs of 61 and 74
yards. Farmer added six points to
the score on a 58 yard pass. Then,
BC made a TD on a 80 yard drive.
The whistle blew, Pitt won 35-11.

Defensive back Glenn Hodge became
a gamesaver for Pitt Panther defense
this year. His aggressive ball-hawking
style brought four interceptions and
over forty individual tackles. The
6'1", 175 pounder had the confidence
of the secondary every Saturday while
stopping the opposing receivers time
and time again.

CATS CLIP OWLS
FOR 7th WIN

Coming to entertain the Pitt Home-
coming crowd of 42,700, the
Temple Owls put on an exciting
but hopeless game as Pitt went
on to win 35-24.

Pitt was in trouble though, for
both Dorsett and Farmer had to
set out the game due to injuries.
The Owls grabbed an early lead
when they took the opening kick-
off 80 yards in 11 plays. But,
Pitt fought back and in the sec-
ond quarter Haygood received a
punt on the Pitt 45, and returned
it 20 yards. Several plays later,
with a 3rd down and 3 on the Owl
29, Walker broke a tackle and
scooted 29 yards to tie the score.
Long kicked the X-point.

Temple was not going to give up
that easy. Before the half ended,
the Owls drove down to the 5, but
were forced to kick a field goal
making the half time score 10-7
in favor of Temple.

Early in the 3rd quarter the Pan-

A .thersa_';9.mpLeted,.a_ 63 yard-drive

with Murphy catching a 33 yard
touchdown pass. Later in the quar-
ter the Owls bounced back with
another TD and took the lead with
a 17-14 margin.

The first couple of minutes of the
fourth quarter were consumed by a
Panther 100 yard drive which was
capped by Walker from the two.

The next TD was by Temple. This
was set up with an interception on
Pitt's 38. But again the Panthers
were on the move. On the next
series, Daniels completed a pass
to Clark for 24 yards, then Walker
picked up 15 and on a reverse
Murphy went 41 yards to the one.
From there Walker went over the
top for the score.

Pitt was not finished, and as
Temple started another drive, Glenn
Hodge intercepted the pass in Pan-
ther territory. Two plays later
Walker galloped 62 yards for his
fourth TD. Pitt won its 7th game
35-24.

CATS EKE OUT
13-11 WIN

Although Navy's record is 2-4, one
of their victories was an upset
against the powerful Nittany Lions
of Penn State. The upsetting score
was 7-6 Navy. With this in mind,
Majors was not about to take it
easy. He knew the Middies would
also be prepared to revenge the
17-16 loss one year ago as Pitt
won the game in the last 33 sec-
onds. All this meant that Pitt
better be ready.

And ready Pitt was not for the Pan-
thers coughed up the ball six
times while losing it four times.
The only thing the offense could
muster the first half was a 46 yard
field goal by Long. The play was set
up after defensive tackle Don Par-
rish recovered a Navy fumble on the
Middy 27. The defense was tough
sacking the Navy quarterback many
times with Parrish making 3
himself.

In the third quarter, both Pitt
and Navy scored on field goals.
Navy's field goal came after Pitt's
fifth fumble, a pitch from Daniels
that eluded Dorsett, and the Middies
recovered on the Panther's 38.
Once again the Pitt defense stif-
fened but Navy kicker Dyckes
booted a 32 yarder. This cut Pitt‚Äôs
lead to 6-3 in the third quarter.

The fourth quarter was a scary one
for Pitt. To begin with, Daniels
drove the ball down to the Navy 7
on fourth down and five yards to
go. Instead of attempting an easy
field goal. Majors decided to go for
it. The assignment was given to
Dorsett who slanted over right
guard, and plunged across the two
for a first down. Three plays later
Dorsett dove into the endzone for
the TD. Pitt now had a comfortable
13-3 lead.

But the Middies stormed right back
on the following kick-off. Navy
quarterback Mike Roban marched
the Middies 80 yards in 14 plays.
The drive was sustained by runs

around the ends and two aerials
for key gains. The score came
when full-back Bob Jackson scored
with 1:21 left in the game. Then
Navy successfully attempted a two-
point conversion to cut the Pan-
ther lead to less than a field goal
difference.

Everyone in Annapolis knew what
was coming next as Navy kicker
Steve Dyckes placed the ball on
the lefthash marks. The on side
kick squibbed for the left sidelines
and recovered by Navy on the Pitt
47. But the Pitt defense came
through and sank Navy. Pitt won
by the narrow margin of 13-11.

Mike Bulino (Above), standout sen-
ior defensive back, looks on from
the sidelines during the Temple
struggle. Bulino was sidelined for
many games due to an ankle injury
that occured in the Southern Cal
tussle. Bulino will long be remem-
bered for his rocking tackles from
the monster man position.

SUN KISSED PITT
DOWNS ORANGEMEN

It was just orange for Pitt after
the Panthers nudged the Syracuse
Orangemen 21-13.

The Panthers dominated the first
half by taking the kick-off and
driving 63 yards in 13 plays. Dor-
sett and Hutton ground out the
yardage to put the ball on the
Orange 20. Daniels completed a
pass to Murphy for 15 yards. Then
several plays later Dorsett ran
around the end for the score.
Long's kick was good.

The Orangemen came right back
and in no time were able to tie
the score 7-7.

On the next Cat drive Hutton burst
up the middle for 18 yards then
caught a 16 yard pass from Daniels.
But on the next play Daniels kept
the ball on the option and fought
his way for seven yards before he
fumbled the ball. Syracuse re-
covered on their 29. Soon after-
wards the Orangemen gave the ball
back to Pitt when Glenn Hodge in-
tercepted a pass on the Pitt 31.
But Pitt went nowhere.

Late in the second quater the
Orange put a drive together but
were halted at the Pitt 25. They,
then kicked a 42 yard field goal
to take the halftime lead 10-7.

The second half was all Pitt. On
the Panther's first drive, Daniels
engineered a 95 yard romp. Dor-
sett got 4 yards and Murphy picked
up 18 more.‚Äò Several plays later
Daniels broke for a 31 yard scamp-
er. To cap the drive Daniels passed
to Corbett for the score.

Syracuse came back with a 45 yard
field goal in the fourth. but Pitt
put another drive together. This
time Pitt went 62 yards in 10 plays.
Corbett made the key catches that
put Pitt in the Orange territory.
Finally Walker went over the top to
make the score 1-13.

UPSET DREAM
FALLS SHORT 14-10

The Panthers traveled to South
Bend, Indiana to put up one of
their toughest battles of the sea-
son against nationally ranked Notre
Dame. Following their five game
winning streak, the Cats were look-
ing forward to upsetting the lucky
Irish, and they almost did.

To start the half, the Irish who
won the toss, chose to kick-off in-
stead of receiving. The Cats could
not move. Swider came in and
punted to the ND 46. The Irish
moved the ball easily through the
Pitt defense with Wayne Bullock
doing most of the work. ND com-
pleted the drive with a 3 yard
pass for a score.

The game then turned into a de-
fensive battle with the two teams
exchanging punts until Pitt was
able to get their first break of the
game. The Irish on their 25 and in
a punting position were hammered
by the Pitt defense and Bonasorte
blocked the punt. Pitt took over
on the ND 12, but let the ball fall
through their fingers as Dorsett
fumbled on the one.

Driving down the field the ND of-
fense was picking up good yardage.
But near the goal line the Pitt
defense tightened up and the Irish
fumbled. Keley Daviston recovered
the ball for Pitt.

Pitt failed to move the ball again
and punted to the Irish. Two plays
later the Cats had possession again
when Daviston intercepted a pass
from ND quarterback, Tom Cle-
ments on the Irish 44.

The very next play was tragic
for Pitt for Daniels after being
steam-rolled, suffered torn liga-
ments on his knee. This put him
out of the game for the remaining
season. After a fantastic punt re-
turn by Larry Felton, Medwid took
the quarterback position for Pitt.
From the Irish 23, Medwid com-
pleted a pass to Murphy for 13
yards and Dorsett scampered for 7

more. Then, Medwid made the TD
on an option play from the 2. This
made the half-time score 7-7.

The third quarter was a defensive
struggle with both teams depending
on their puntinggames. But the
fourth quarter was probably the
most exciting quarter all season.
Clements on the Pitt 33 coughed
up another fumble. Glenn Hodge
recovered for the Catsand the of-
fense scrambled on the field. Dor-
sett gained 8 and fullback Bob Hut-
ton made a first down with four
more. Walker came in and picked
up 14 yards to move the ball to
the ND 41. Dorsett gained 8 more
yards. Then, Long came in to boot
a 52 yard field goal to put the Pan-
thers ahead by 3.

 

Notre Dame put together a drive
of their own with Clements cli-
maxing the 55 yard drive.

There was 2:49 left on the clock.
Pitt had one last chance. Medwid
had everyone on the edge of their
seat as he completed 3 passes to
Murphy for 15, 25, and 13 yards.
Clark caught a pass to put Pitt
on the ND 16 with 44 seconds
left. But time ran out after Med-
wid desperately tried to put the
ball in the end zone. Notre Dame
won 14-10.

CATS DOWN ED IN
TURKEY BOWL

This was "THE GAME‚Äù, The Nittany
Lions of Penn State and the newly
arisen Eastern power the Panthers
of the University of Pittsburgh. The
game was nationally televised by
ABC at the Three Rivers Stadium.

The first half of the game was a
very unproductive one. State's only
points came from two field goals
by Chris Bahr. Meanwhile, the Pan-
thers' only touchdown came when
State fumbled the ball on a punt,
in the second quarter. Several
plays later, Dorsett scrambled into
the end zone for a touchdown.
Long's extra-point kick made the
half-time score 7-6.

Just like last year's Pitt-Penn
State game, the Panthers were
blasted off the field in the sec-
ond half. The Pitt offense was con-
stantly tripped up by the aggresive
Lion defense. Medwid replacing the
injured Daniels, was unable to get
any type of drive together since
he was too busy scrambling. About
the only offensive highlight was a
19-yard run by Dorsett which
brought his total yardage above
the 1000 mark.

State went on to take the lead
early in the third quarter with a
31 yard field goal. Later in the
quarter, Lion quarterback Shuman
passed for a 25 yard touchdown
to make the score 16-7.

Pitt came back with a Long 50
yard field goal, but it was hope-
less for in the fourth quarter the
Lions bombarded the Panthers.
Bahn then kicked a 38 yard field
goal to make it 19-10. Then, Web-
ster receiving the kick-off for Pitt
fumbled the ball. PSU's Tom Wil-
liams recovered in the end zone for
six points. The final Lion TD came
with a 35 yard toss to fill out the
score. So, Penn State won it 31-10.
Once again PSU out-performed Pitt,
but, like always, just wait till
next year.

 

Pitt's 7-3 record was matched
against Penn State's number one
Eastern ranking as both teams
squared off on a frigid cold
Thanksgiving night. A national

supporters pointed to the hope that
this year Pitt would knock off
rival Penn State. The Panthers
were sky high as they emerged
from the dressing room for this

The Pitt‚ÄîPenn State game proved to be a
disappointment for Pitt fans everywhere.
Leading 7-6 at halftime, the Panthers were
smothered in the second half losing 31-10.
The third and fourth quarters were fraught
with third and long situations. Above,
imagine the conversation going like this,
‚ÄúWell coach, it's the fourth quarter, we're
losing 31-10, and its fourth and 21, what
should we do?" ‚ÄúPunt . . . .  Oh well,
can't win ‚Äôem all.

several Panther careers. Seniors wearing their
Pitt helmets for the last time are: Bob Medwid,

This Thanksgiving night game marked the first time
since 1965 that Pitt was on national T.V. The ABC
cameras brought out the best in the local fans as dozens
of signs and hundreds of pennants and stickers vied
for attention. While Pitt fans, students, and cheerleaders
did their best to get on national T.V. (see above), it
appears that the Penn State cheerleaders (left) stole
the show. Pictured at top are Pitt cheerleaders, Vicki
Veltri. Kate McKay, and Myra Lynn Beaver.

The Pitt Panther basketball squad under head coach
Buzz Ridl had their best year ever in 1973-74 ending
their season as Eastern Regional runners-up. To kick
off what was expected to be another successful year,
Pitt faced Ohio Northern at home. The lightly regarded
opponent succumbed to the taller and more talented
Panthers 53-36. In the season's second contest, the
team traveled to unfriendly Morgantown to meet the

Mounties of West Virginia. A ball-hawking defense gave
Pitt a 37-32 halftime lead but 24 second half points by
WVU‚Äôs Warren Baker gave the opponents an 82-78
overtime win. Turn‚Äîovers and poor foul shooting were
important factors in the loss. The Panthers hoped to
rebound in contests at the Steel Bowl held at Pitts-
burgh's Civic Arena. The Panthers were favorites to
meet Oregon in the tourney‚Äôs finale but opening round

Finishing the season with a 17 point per game average mostly on the
strength of a floating jump shot made senior Kirk Bruce the team
leader in scoring.

the following night a lackluster performance against

Pitt downed a tall and quick Marquette five. The War-
