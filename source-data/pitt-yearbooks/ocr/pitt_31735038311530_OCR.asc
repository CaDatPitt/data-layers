ust mention the
words The University
of Pittsburgh, and in-
stantaneously the im-
age of the Cathedral of
Learning pops into
mind. Essentially, the
Cathedral of Learning

«is the center of the Pitt

campus, towering over
the other ninety build-
ings that make up the
campus.

If you have ever no-
ticed it, the Cathedral
of Learning can be
seen from almost every
vantage point in the
Oakland, Squirrel Hill
and Pittsburgh area.
Though not to worry, if
you are ever lost from
your home at Pitt, all
you need to do is look
for the familiar shape
of the Cathedral on the
Pittsburgh skyline, and
it will point you back to
your rightful home.

To Pitt students the
Cathedral is a special

6 g Student Life

place. It brings back
fond memories of days
spent at Pitt. Be it from
reminiscing about the
lack of air-conditioning
in the summer, the
nonexistence of heat in
the frigid Pittsburgh
winter, the tiny, dark
and cramped class-
rooms, those scary el-
evator rides to the up-
per ﬂoors, running up
and down those many
flights of stairs for
some needed exercise,
to hanging out and
studying with friends,
in the dark Commons
Room to the wee hours
of the mom.

The Cathedral of
Learning plays host to
many campus func-
tions. This year during
homecoming week, it
was the scene of the
annual Alumni Recep-
tion. The Cathedral
was also the site of the
third annual stair-
climb.

Yet, many people do
not know anything be-
yond the point that the
Cathedral of Learning
is the hub of the Pitt
campus. Though, the
Cathedral has a rich
history and is full of in-
teresting facts and
happenings.

For instance did you
or do you know any of
the following facts con-
cerning the Cathedral
of Learning?

-The University, in
1907, bought a pasture
in what is now the
home of Oakland.

—With the construc-
tion of the Cathedral of
Learning, the Universi-
ty was relocated from
Downtown to what is
now Oakland.

-Funded in part with
the dimes of area
school chﬂdren, today
the Cathedral is the
schoolhouse for 28,120
Pitt students.

Student Life & 7

 

106 * CGS

”Never in my wildest dreams
did I believe I would get a college
degree,” said Richar , who has
been }put of prison for only a few
mont s.

Fiore Pugliano, who coordinated
the Pett program that helped Rich-
ard et an e ucaﬁon, describes the
stud ents as ’;lexcited, challenged
an comrnitte .”

Several prison inmates have
turned their lives around by at-
tending college behind bars
through Pitt's program at the State
Eortﬁctional nstitution at Pitts-

ur .

” ’m on a whole different path
than I was before,” said John, who
was paroled late in September.
John and Richard requested that
their names not be used.

”The students are very motivat-
ed, very interested. The ask a lot
of questions,” said rofessor
J.havem1eRocereto, who teaches an-

ro oo .

” havgey seen epiple change,”
Pugliano said. e escribed one
man who was sullen and with-
drawn when he was practically
dragged into the program.

” e has been transformed. His
attitude is much more open, and he
lwants todfinish his degree,” Pug-

ano sai .

Without education "one could
pretty much guarantee that many
of these people would be sup-
ported by the state the rest of their

ives,” Pu liano said.

Studies ave shown that the rate
of offenders returning to rison
goes down as the level 0 edu-
cation goes up. One year after a-
role over 30 percent of offen ers
with less than a college education
have returned to prison. Of college
graduates, only 11 percent have
gone back to prison.

Richard explains it this way: ’’If
people are monsters when tlvizy go
in t ere, without help they ' l e
bigger monsters w en they get
out.”

”They train inmates to come
back,” he said. ”Many of thes guys
never learned to acce t responsi-
bility. In prison some ody else is
running your life for you. You are
provided with a warm place to stay
and three meals a day. ’

”Three hots and a cot,” John de-
scribed it.

Most of the 120 to 150 students
who take college courses each term
are learning to take on responsi-
bili as well as a new way of
thin 'ng. About a fourth of the in-
mate-students take a full load.
The often combine External
Stu "es courses with those taught
on site by volunteer faculty.

"The students themselves have
helped to keep the program go-
ing,” Pugliano said.

me inmates who have com-
pleted their education tutor stu-
dents and teach basic courses. In-
mate John Minarik teaches a
poetry writing course and expects
is students to submit their work
for ublication.
ore than 40 students have
graduated while in prison, some
with honors. One was a Chancel-
lor’s Scholar. Each year a gradu-
ation ceremony is held, which in-
cludes those prisoners who have
completed eneral-education di-
plomas an vocational training
courses as well as bachelor's de-
grees.

A party afterward allows grad-
uates to celebrate their accomplish-
ments along with family and
friends.

”It’s a great reward for me to see
the happiness on the faces of the
parents and other family members
who are so roud of these men,"
Rocereto saidl

Donna Williams, one of the ad-
visors with the program, recalled a
mother with tears in her eyes who
thanked her ersonally.

Some stu ents leave prison be-
fore graduating and continue their
studies on the outside. John and
Richard are both now studying on
the Pitt campus.

John expects to graduate with a
major in information science in
August 1992, and Richard looks
forward to completing his degree
in communications in December
that same year.

Both ex ressed gratitude for the
support e have received from
pleople like obin Wingard of the

niversit External Studies Pro-
gram of ice and Pugliano, who
ave helped them make the ad-
justment to taking classes on cam-

pus.
"I feel I belong. I’m a card car-
rying member 0 the university,”

his GED in prison and was mo-
ﬁvated to 0 on.

He said e can't understand why
more prisoners don't take advan-
ta eo the pro am.

‘Guys shoul ‘be breaking down
the doors to get in,” he said. "Most
of the guys are in a graveyard.
They are just dying — wasting
away. I d hke to elp them. Be an
exam le. I'll never stop learning.”

Ric ard gives credit to the prison
tutoringlservice for part of his suc-
cess. ” gebra gave me the blues,”
he said. ‘Robert Wideman (an in-
Ealte instructor) gave me a lot of

e ."

John explained that when the
Pitt advisors come to the prison,
it's big event for the men. ”We
always et a large tumout,” he
said. ” e men feel these people
care about them.”

”The men seem surprised that
anyone wants to help,” Robin
Wingard said. ”The appreciate the
fact that people donate their time
to teach and that students are will-
in to donate study guides.”

ingard said that because they
lack maoney for books, some of the
men have had to dro courses they
wanted. The UESP o fice has made
available to the risoners over 200
student-donate study guides for
UESP courses.

In addition to textbooks, the ro-
gram is also in constant nee of
more teachers.

Richard speculated that some
teachers ma be afraid to go to the
prison. ”T e guys protect the
teachers. They aren't going to let
anyone treat them with disre-
spect,” he said.

Pugliano said the dedication of
the instructors and of the students
themselves has been the biggest
factor in making the program a
success.

Richard knows. ”I always want-
ed something better. Now I’m do-
ing fine,” he said with a grin.

CGS to work on recruitment

The College of General Studies Student Government wants to work on a student-
recruitment internship plan that could help the school's enrollment problem, but the
program still must be approved by Pitt President]. Dennis O'Connor.

T e plan focuses on enabling students to earn credits within the SGC and the
internshi program by giving communi presentations to recruit CGS students.

Accor ' gto council resi ent Marcie oberts, O'Connor wants to see more enrollment
statistics be ore the plan can progress.

Roberts also said admission criteria to the Alumni Association's new Blue and Gold
Society is unfair to CGS students. The criteria include leadership qualities and working for
the society a minimum of 10 hours a week.

"The 10-hours- er-week work schedule will discourage CGS students because most
are non-traditiona and have other responsibilities.” Robert said. "It’s hard to prove that
you are a leader, work at least 10 hours a week and still do everything else you need to

OIII

The Alumni Association will look into the matter, according to Roberts.

The council also agreed to look into the suggestions and opinions uncovered at a ast
meeting. The sug estions included CGS phone-in registration, including more GS
clfasses within the onors College, and scheduling more CGS classes in mornings and
a temoons.

Council Corner: CGS Myths

I would like to devote this article to dispelling some of the myths and misconceptions
that I have heard concerning CGS students.

Myth #1: I think that the most common misconception about CGS students is that they
are old, married, boring people with spouses and children. Well, to dispel that myth, I
present myself. I am twenty years old, a full-tirne student, I live in the residence halls, and
I even eat in the cafeteria! I am what most peo le call a traditional student. And please
believe me, I am not a rarity to the College of eneral Studies.

CGS does, however, service a lar e number of non-traditional students: students who
are res onsible, vital people that ta e their studies seriously and are looking to im rove
themse ves and their situations. CGS student-run organizations also sponsor a num er of
fun events and activities.

Myth #2: CGS students are second-rate students and deserve to be treated that way.
This myth offends me the most. Although I don't have any statistics to uote, I know that
CGS students are probably the most studious people I know. They stu y constantly and
take full advantage of services like free tutoring.

And, believe me, we don't deserve to be treated like second-rate students. CGS
students are a vital part of this community and we in CGS Student Government are doing
everything we can to see that we are treated as such. I stron ly urge all CGS students to
ex ress any problems, questions and concerns to our office. e were elected to service the
C S student body's interests, and for us to do the best possible job, we require input from

all of you.

The College of General Studies is very di-
versified in the variety of students enrolled.
Many of the students are continuing their
education. The ages vary from over 60, to
the average college age of 18. The students
quite ha gily attend classes that are en-
erally he at ni ht. Most of the stu ents
are continuin t eir education, so gener-
ally, these stugents have full-time jobs and
families. Obviousl not ordinary students.
The biggest comp aint that these students
have is t at the professors dismiss the class
too early. The students want to learn as
much as possible to better themselves. The
College of General Studies has organiza-
tions and events just like the other colleges,
but these section is unique unto itself.
These students thrive to be the best in theis
competative world we live in by continuing
their educatrion, whether it is for job ad-
vancement or simply interest in a particular
subject.

These two students eagerly await the beginning of their
next class in David Lawrence Hall. Their happy faces
reflect the love of learning inbred into the College of
General Studies student. Their bright eyes show that
the late hour does not damper the interest in their
class.

This student did not want to leave the learning at-
mosphere created in his class, so he decided to camp
out until the next class arrives. The late night class
seemed to wear him down for his little nap.

they rush to their next class. They are just anxiously
awaiting the stimulating lecture that is soon to follow
after their departure from the escaltor.

As these students go throu h their day,
man things ma be going t rough their
min s. Because t ese are not ordinary stu-
dents, there are greater pressures u on
them. Many have families and small c '1-
dren at home. The College of General
Studies tries to address this problem by a
pro osed day care center for its continuing
stu ents’ children. This center would ro-
vide adult supervision for the chil ren
while the parent enjoys stress free learning.
This is just one of the uni ue stresses put
u on the College General tudies student.

any attend Pitt to further their career. Not
only do they go to work everyday, but they
must also attend school at night. Obviously
not the most stress free environment. But
these students get through it all and grad-
uate. The typical student in the College of
General Studies has a great assion for
learnin , otherwise, why wou d they put
themse ves through the stress. There are
three types of student that attend the Col-
lege of General Studies : over 60, con-
tinuing education, and regular college age.
For these students, there are a variety of
ways that the person can attend Pitt. : at
night, Saturdays, or externall . The first
two are quite self explanatory, ut the Col-
lege of General Studies unique external
studies rogram rovides education
This student eagerly walks into his next class. Eyes alert and straight ahead for the through the mail an the student only has
next learning expirence-’ to come to the University to take test on
scheduled days. This program is perfect for
the traveling business person, or someone
who just does not have the time to invest in
the college experience.

     
  

These students calmly soak up the information spuded by the professor. Sitting by
the door..hmmm could be anxious to call home to see if the kiddies are all right
and the house is still intact !

   

Class dismissed already I I want to learn
more ! Well, might as well pck up and hover around the
next classroom and wait. . .

MAKING IT IN THE WORLD

111

Ode to Pitt

0' Pitt how I have loved you so
Yet it is now off into the world I go

You have kept me well
Within the hallowed halls of which I have dwelled

You have guided and nutured me
Shaping me into the adult I am to be

You have given me a sense of kinship
With the creation of ever-lasting friendship

You have imparted with me a feeling of home
Of which has been cast in stone

You have blessed me with a sense of spirit
Of which one day the wind will inherit

It is now that I must bid you Adeiu
Though in my heart your spirit will always linger

Up for a Little Alumni Football?

Well, are you up to play-

ing a litﬂe football?
If you are an alumni of Pitt
and you played a little bit of
ball in your years at Pitt,
then this game will be right
up your alley. What am I
talking about, you ask. Sim-
ple answer, Pitt's first ever
Alumni football game.

1992 marked the begin-
ning of a new tradition at
Pitt, the alumni football
game. This game held at
Pitt Stadium pitted (forgive
my pun will you) the current
Pitt football team against
some of Pitt's greatest alum-
ni players.

Some of the alumni that
participated were known
stars, though Pitt quarter-
back great Dan Marino
couldn't make it.

The end result of the
game was a win for the cur-
rent Panther squad. Though
crowd turnout was low, or-
ganizers hope that future
games will draw more fans.

Got a Quarter?

What to do? What
to do? I seem to have
time on my hands.

I really don't want
to do my homework
(that would be get-
ting ahead of things
and would make me
look like a nerd).

What can I do? I
don't have enough
time to do my laun-
dry (I have six loads
to wash and if you
live in the Towers like
I do then you know
how long that will
take — eternityl).

So now what? By
George, I've got it! I'll
meander down to the
lobby and play some

video games. Since
I'm not going to do
my laundry, I've got
some extra quarters
to spare.

Now the hard de-
cision, do I go for
football, cyperball,
racing, or Terminator
2. I don't know what-
ever strikes my fancy
and isn't being
played at the’ mo-
ment.

Picking the Books

Where are the students? Where
did they go? It's the beginning of
the new semester, shouldn't there
be more students roaming
around the campus?

The answer to where they went
is simple — to the bookstore of
course. At the beginning of every
term students go to their first class
find out what books they need,
and then head off to the book-
store to make their purchases.

Finding the right books is not
as easy as it seems. Though the
bookstore is organized by sec-
tion. Many students must hunt
down their books by looking for
their course number, that corre-
lates to a number on the book-
shelves with the proper books for
that class.

After a student has made a
match with their course number
and their rightful books, they

must get in line and wait, and
wait, and wait, to get checked
out.

Usually within the first three
days of the term the bbokstore is
jammed with students. The lines
are twenty-five to thirty people
deep. And the wait to check out is
near two or three hours.

But never fear eventually it will
be your turn and you will be done
book shopping until next term.

Study

Where do you go to when
you can't study in your own
room or apartment? Or if
you're a comuter where do you
go in between classes to
study?

The William Pitt Union of
course. The concourse area of
the student union offers an

  

ideal, yet somewhat noisy, at-
mosphere in which to study.

Many students can be found
sitting on the wooden tables
that form an outline of the con-
course area, such as the stu-
dent on the left of this story is
doing.

Or if you would like to study
with a view, you can curl up
with your favorite textbooks on
the window seats on the main
ﬂoor of the union.

All in all, there are many
places to study in the union,
you just have to find one.

Want to Drop a Pint?

At different times throughout
the year, the need for blood do-
nors arises. Pitt in it's way helps
this cause with many different
blood drives.

Many of the blood drives can
be associated with the Greek
community, for they are forever
donating to the cause. 

Most of the blood drives are g
held in the William Pitt Union or
Forbes Quad. Many feel that by
donating a pint of blood they
may be saving someone's life,
possibly even their own.

Need a break? Is the weather
warm and sunny? If it is put on your
shorts, grab your bookbag (if you
must study), suntan lotion, etc. and
head off towards the Cathedral
lawn.

Many students make their own
personal beach called the Cathe-
dral of Learning Beach. Of course it
doesn't have sand, or water, but
you still can catch some nice rays
there. And while you're tanning
there you can get together with your
fellow sunworshippers and have a
get together.

Spirit Panther Style

The Campus Rallies Behind the Team

Spirit is still alive
and doing well on the
Pitt campus, no matter
what may have been
said to the contrary.

During the Pitt foot-
ball season the Pitt
campus showed it's
support for the team by
participating in many
pep rallies and spirit
days.

The first spirit day
was held on the day of
the Pitt versus Mary-
land game. The Stu-
dent Government
Board, Spirit Commit-
tee, sponsored face
painting and a banner
contest. Students had
their faces painted be-
fore the game. You
may have seen these
painted faces walking
around the stadium
during the game. Pop-
ular motifes seen were
Go Pitt!, Panther paw
prints, Pitt written in a
variety of styles,
names, Greek letters
proclaiming what fra-

ternity or sorority the
owner belonged to and
total blue and gold
masks.

Other students pre-
pared banners, hope-
fully looking to win
some of the prizes of-
fered, and displayed
them on the stadium
walls. Some of these
banners displayed
showed the Panthers
tromping over the
Terps, a check list dis-
playing Pitt's wins and
losses (at the time the
Panthers were 4 and 0
and looking to make it
5 and 0, which they
did) with a football ex-
ploding out of a wall of
fire, and others dis-
playing the Panthers
beating the Terps.

Another way Pitt stu-
dents showed their
spirit was by attending
pep rallies in the
Schenley Quad, the
biggest one being the
one before the Pitt ver-
sus Penn State game.
Head Coach Paul
Hackett along with

some team members
showed up to enliven
the crowd with some
spirited speeches. And
a special guest even
made his appearance,
Joe Paterno (no, not the
real one, but a look-a-
like). This is where the
Pitt Panther came in
and took on Joe Pa and
beat him to the ground.
The crowd reacted en-
thusiastically to this in
the hopes that this
would really take
place at the game. The
cheerleaders led the
spirited crowd with
some lively cheers and
choreographed
manuevers.

And to those who
may have once said
that Pitt has no spirit,
you are wrong. The Pitt
campus and student
body does possess a
spirit that will always
linger in our hearts for-
even

Say Cheese!

Is it really time? I can't believe it, I
have to go and get my senior pic-
ture taken for the yearbook.

I better hurry or I'm going to be
late. Now the big question what do I
wear and do I do my hair. Well, if I
wear that really cool tie I love, my
mom will hit the roof. But, if I wear
the one she got my I'll look like a
dweeb. What to do. I know I'll bor-
row my roomies tie, that way I can't
get into trouble.

Off I go to the Union to have my
picture taken. What is this why do I
have to fill out these forms. (Easy
answer, so I, the Seniors Editor, will
know what to put under your mug
shot).

Chin up. Don't slouch. Feet to-
gether. Smile. Click. Click. It's done
now I can go home and get out of
this suit.

Chillin'

The time is upon
us. What time you
ask? But of course
(please forgive the
Grey Popoun refer-
ence) the relaxing,
chﬂlin’ time.

Your homework is
done, there are no
exams in the foresee-
able future (two
days), miracle of mir-
acles your laundry is
done and you have
time on your hands.

What to do? Relax,
chill out, take a chill
pill, kick back, etc..
Do whatever it is that

you do when your
bummin' around with
nothing better to do
than nothing.

If you can't think of
anything to do take a
nap zzzzzz.

The'Need to Read

Did you ever
need something to
do inbetween class-
es to kill some time?

Well if you are
wondering what to
do, I have a sugges-
tion for you. And
that is to pick up a
copy of The Pitt
News (they are very
easy to find, but if
you have problems
finding one scope
out the Towers lob-
by), sit down, open
it up, and read.

As the student in
the photo, right (or
as some would say

Ralph) to this column,
is enjoying the Pitt
News in the splendour
of her dorm room,
think that you could
be doing likewise.

Many students en-
joy reading about the
events and happen-
ings about the Pitt
campus, while others
enjoy keeping
abreast of world hap-
penings.

Information

Are you in need of information? Are
you lost? If you are then the easy way to
get to where you are going is to stop in
front of the William Pitt Union and look at
the information sign.

The directory in front of the Union
contains a complete campus map to point
you in the right direction.

This map is most useful for new stu-
dents and visting high school seniors.

In it’s own way it marks out the Pitt
campus for vistors.

Homecoming

 
 

H omecoming exploded

this year marking the big-
gest homecoming in Pitt
history. The Pitt Program
Council planned a gigantic
funfilled week in which
everyone could partake.

Homecoming week
kicked off on Monday Oc-
tober 14 with the CBS Col-
lege Tour which stayed un-
til Tuesday October 15.
The college tour gave stu-
dents the opporttmity to act
in CBS soap operas, call
sports plays, see movie
previews, shoot some
hoops, guess lines from
CBS comedies, report the
local weather and play
The Price is Right and
Family Feud.

Next it was on to the Mo-
nopoly tournament, with
round one on Monday
night and the finale on
Tuesday. Students had the
opportunity to play, in elim-
ination rounds, the fea-
tured game — Monopoly
— in order to win prizes
offered by the PPC.

Wednesday featured a
concert by Steven Wright
at Soldiers and Sailors. Pitt
Night Out was the event
slated for Thursday, with
many students taking ad-
vantage of the special in-
centives and discounts of-
fered by area merchants.

Friday and the Keg Roll

course. Photo by Steve

miss the bucket, what a
mess I'll be if she miss-
es. Photo by Steve

was on. The annual event
was once again held on
the Cathedral Lawn. The
keg roll was just not a keg
roll, it was a series of
events, or shall I say
"obstacles," that the con-
testants (4 man teams) had
to "roll" through. Though it
was the keg roll that was
the main attraction, being
so popular and fun that
even our own university
president, I. Dennis
O'Connor, decided to join
in and roll out his own keg.
Later that evening was
witness to the Presidental
Reception held in the Ca-
thedral's beautifully deco-
rated Commons Room. The
reception greeted return-
ing alumni and distin-
guished individuals, such
as Pittsburgh Mayor
Sophie Masloff. After the
reception the attendees,
along with the enitre stu-
dent body, were treated to
a fireworks and laser show
on Bigelow Blvd. The fire-
works and lasers were
choreographed to a sound
program featuring the likes
of Iames Brown's Coming
to America to get the Pitt
fans revved up for Satur-
days football game. The
show ended with a laser
Panther climbing the Ca-
thedral of Learning. What
a sight to behold!
Saturday and the smell
of football was in the air

with Pitt taking on Syra-
cuse. Even though Pitt lost,
we still won with the
crowning of the King and
Queen. The candidates
were chosen by a new se-
lection process this year.
The court was selected by
a five-person committee,
which judged the candi-
dates in five areas: aca-
derr1ics, verbal skills, non-
verbal skills, extracurricu-
lar activities and the judg-
es overall impression of the
candidate.

The candidates selected
for king included Omari
Daniel from the Black Ac-
tion Society, Brock Hamula
from Sigma Phi Epsilon, Gil
Golden from Sigma Chi,
Michael Moore from Quo
Vadis and Boice Allen from
WPTS.

The court of queen can-
didates consisted of Chris-
tiana Hahnfeldt from Delta
Zeta, Natalie Pecora from
Chi Omega, Marianne
Rome from Quo Vadis,
Ioanne Demsher from Tau
Beta Sigma and Kim
Whitmore from the School
of Nursing.

At 1:30 pm, the candi-
dates were standing on the
field wondering who was
going to be crowned 1991
Homecoming King and
Queen. The suspense was
unbearable. A drumroll
please. And the winners
were Brock Hamula and

Natalie Pecora! Con-
gratulations were of-
fered to the happy cou-
ple by Lisa Tate, 1990s
Homecoming Queen.
As President I. Dennis
O'Connor and his wife
crowned the new king
and queen, Pecora's so-
rority sisters swarmed
down on to the field to
also offer their congrat-
ulations.

Homecoming week
was capped off on Sat-
unday night with the
Homecoming cruise
aboard the Gateway
Clipper. It was a night
filled with stars and ro-
mance.

Amidst the ongoing academic
challen es, there seems to be evi-
dence t at life actually does exist
outside of the classroom. The hope of
any college is to cultivate well-
rounded students, and in addition to
the solid academic foundation Pitt
provides, there are in excess of 200
active organizations. Whether it in-
volves ta ing the field for a rugby
match or voicin your opinion in a
women’s suppo group, Pitt has an
organization for every interest. Or-
ganizations are a great way to meet
people, to get involved, and to help
promote further endeavors. They
help brin people together who rally
for a simi ar cause or share a similar
identity. These are the best mo-
ments of your life —— these are the
moments outside of the classroom
— the moments when you get to
show your true colors.

STUDENT

GOVERNMENT
BOARD

The Student Government Board’s
major goal is to be the voice of the
students. SGB is composed of many
sub-committees, such as Alloca-
tions, Election, Governmental Rela-
tions, Jucicial, Student Relations,
and Freshmen Council, which help
further students’ views and inter-
ests. Many projects were accom-
plished this year, such as promotion
of self-defense classes, “Crime
Stop”, 491-4VAN service, and free
Carnegie Museum passes, and the
addition of a lawyer who will council
students for free. The Board also had
the opportunity to take part in the
selection of the university’s new
chancellor.

It's an autumn Saturday and where are
you? At Pitt Stadium with your friends root-
ing for the Panthers. Spirit is the name of
the game in collegiate athletics and three
organizations are in charge of instilling it in
the student body. These groups also per-
form at basketball games and pep rallies.
Immediately when one hears the words
“marching band" he or she thinks of foot-
ball games. Band members perform at half
time and play fight songs during the games.
Band is a large, but cohesive group that
even has its own fraternities.

Through rain or shine the cheerleaders are
always prepared to excite the crowd. Not
only do they do cheers, but they also per-
form dances. Cheerleaders practice hard
every day, and you can sometimes catch
them ﬂipping on the Cathedral lawn.

The Golden Girls perform at halftime with
the band. They are essentially majorettes,
but they also do a number of different
dances each week. These girls can be quite
a spectacle in their golden shoes and ﬂow-
ing capes.

Parking at Pitt

A Commuters Nightmare

Hell has no fury like
a commuter scorned,
or one who can't find a
parking space. These
may seem like pro-
phetic words, but they
are true. For parking in
Pittsburgh, especially
in the Oakland area, is
a terror that many
must face each day.

Many commuters ar-
rive between 8am and
9am everyday inorder
to secure a choice
parking space. By
choice parking space,
I mean one that is in-
front of the Cathedral
and permits four hour
parking.

After 9am finding a
parking space be-
comes hetic, for many
of the choice spots are
gone, and only two
hour meters near the
Chevron Science
Center remain. If you
are out and about
around 9am, you will
see many cars circling

the Oakland area in
hopes of finding a
parking space in
which to park.

Though finding a
parking space is only
the beginning of prob-
lems that commuters
face. Ever heard of a
parking ticket, if you
commute I'm sure that
you have.

The City of Pitts-
burgh Parking Patrol
roams the streets of
Oakland with an iron
ticket book. These
Parking Patrol Officers
are on the lookout for
expired meters, cars
parked in unofficial
parking spaces, cars
that are parked be-
yond the two or four
hour parking limit, etc..

If you are an unfor-
tunate soul, who just
missed feeding the me-
ter or parked in an il-
legal space, then you
will find a nice parking
ticket attached to your
car. Thovah if you pay

Need ct place to park
just head on in here.

the ticket within 72
hours then the fine is
only five dollars. But, if
you wait past the al-
loted 72 hours, then it
will be 10 dollars. And
if you do what some in-
dividuals do and stuff
the ticket in your glove
compartment or put it
on another car (in the
hopes that this poor
sucker will pay your
ticket for you), then you
will find a summons to
pay the ticket, which
has now gone up to
$37.50. So be a smart
cookie and pay any
tickets that you do get
within 72 hours, it'll
save you a lot of time
and aggrevation.
Another option that
commuting students
have is parking in an
University owned
parking lot, like Pan-
ther Hollow or those lo-
cated behind the sta-
diurn or any other local
parking lot. The Uni-
versity lots offer afford-

able prices and shuttle
service to various parts
of the campus, though
they do fill up early,
due to the fact that
many university per-
sonell park there. Oth-
er lots which are found
in various parts of
Oakland, like the one
across from Hillman li-
brary, offer monthly
rates and hourly rates.

All in all, parking in
Oakland has gotten
better within the last
year with the opening
of the parking lot
across from Hillman li-
brary and the con-
struction of a parking
garage beneath the
lawn of Soldiers and
Sailors. For commuters
that must still be on the
search for a parking
space, I wish you the
greatest of luck in find-
ing one.

Clowns roam freely, children win

Sigma Delta Tau

This past year has been a busy and
successful year for Sigma Delta Tau.
I They had a Fall Pledge Class of 13
young women and a Spring Pledge
Class of eight. With two pledge classes
the chapter doubled in size and ended
I L the year with over 40 members. This ‘
year also saw the 75th Anniversary of
the founding of the sorority.

The sisters of Sigma Delta Tau were
involved in many activities within the
community. They participated in Greek

Week and many of the sisters volun-

teered their time to United Cerebal Pai-

I sy by spending time with their hon-

orary little sister and working at (lCP’s
telethon. They participated in all Greek
Week events and won several awards
placing 4th in Volunteer and 2nd in
l Chariot Race. Their Fall Pledge Class
volunteered at Designer Dress Days, a
I fundraising event for various organi-

zations in the Pittsburgh area, and their
Spring Pledge Class visited the School
for the Blind and spent some time with
the children there.
I Even with all this hard work and
preparation for events like Greek Week
and Rush they managed to have a lot of
fun. The Winter Pledge Class held a
1 sleepover for the sisters and took them
to breakfast the next day. They had
several mixers throughout the year
with fraternities both at Pitt and Car-
negie Mellon. They also had an in-
I formal in October and a formal in F eb-
ruary.

They are currently ranked forth of
the twelve sororities on campus ac-
! ademically. They won several National
awards including Most lmproved Rush.
Panhel also awarded them the Most
Improved Sorority on campus for the
1991-92 academic year.

Sigma Alpha Epsilon

Sigma Alpha Epsilon celebrated its
79th year at Pitt with many significant
accomplishments. Among the high-

lights of the yeafrfwas winning their 7th ~

consecutive f Chapter Acheivement
Award, an honor given by their Na»-
tional to only the top SAE chapters
throughout the nation. They also
placed second in the Cathedral Award,
given to the best all around fraternity at
Pitt. For their continued excellence in
handling the ever~changing social pol-
icies, they received the IFC Social Pro-
gramming Award. And, for the quality
time spent in advising and educating
our brotherhoodgtthey also received the
IF C Membership Education Award.

Nothing else brings their house
closer together than whenever they
step onto the ﬁeld of play. As a result,
they once again managed to capture
the IFC Ali-Sports Championship for
the 7th straight year. This year's mar»
gin of victory was the closest out of all
seven years.

Graduationgddiiitake its to]! on the :
chapter, as it did jfotmany others. They

an integral part of their house. They
have initiated 16 new brothers and

In the past year Phi Delta Theta has

Greek Olympiad. They were also were

The members also became involved
in all aspects of University life. These
include: Pitt’s Mentor Program, SGB,

o Omega Honor Society, Resident As-

Lambda Sigma Honor Society, Order of I

sistants, Young Republicans, and
ROTC.

Phi Delta Theta members also ex-
celled in leadership positions. The cur-
rent IFC President, Scholarship Chair-
man, and Junior Judicial Board
member are all brothers of Phi Delta
Theta.

The chapter initiated it's 1000th

Delta Delta Delta

Throughout their existence at the
University of Pittsburgh, the Alpha
Theta chapter of Delta Delta Delta has
been very involved both in the Greek
and University communities. They take
pride in the strength and unity of all of
their programs. The relationship with
the pledge members, alumni, and (Ini-
versity mentors has been strong in the .
past years. On campus, it is important
that chapter members stay visible to
the faculty and administrators.

Tri Deltas presently serve as Pres-
ident of Panhellenic, Panhellenic Public
Relations Chairperson, Judicial Board
Member, and President of the Golden
Key Honor Society. They are also in-
volved with the Blue and Gold Society,
Society of Women Engineers, Heinz
Chapel Choir, Omicron Delta Kappa
. National Honor Society, Order of Ome—
ga, Pitt Tennis Team, Mentor Program,
u and The Pitt News.

Along with being involved in campus
activites, TriDelta also stresses the im-
portant of academic excellence. This
past year, the chapter boasted a com-
bined grade average of 3.04.

One of the most important weeks of
the Greek system, Greek Week, has
kept their chapter busy over the past
years. Tri Delta has captured first place
overall for the past eight years.

Greek Week is only one of four chapter
service projects they participated in.
With their help, the American Cancer
Society raised approximately $5000
with their Making Strides campaign.
They also placed first for the third con-
secutive year in Sigma Chi Derby Days.

Unity is indeed important; however,
some top individual talent does shine
above all others. They were pleased
that Stephanie Myers was the recipient
of the 1992 Savina 8. Skewis Award,
recognizing the Outstanding Greek
Woman of the Year. W

Sigma Phi Epsilon

in the 1991-1992 academic year the
Pennsylvania Gamma Chapter of Sig-
ma Phi Epsilon had its third year since
recolonizing at the University of Pitts-
burgh. More so than the previous two
years, Sig Eps made their presence
I I known on Pltt’s campus. The fraternity
has been progressively growing and
building toward becoming one of Pitt’s
most outstanding Greek organizations,
and this year was marked by strides in
the direction of that goal.
Sig Eps are now involved in every
I I facet of the Greek community at Pitt,
which is a very impressive feat for a
fraternity which will be celebrating it's
second anniversity as a fully recognized
chapter on November 3, 1992. Several
brothers have emerged both as leaders
within the fraternity and as leaders in
I ' Greek and campus organizations. Da-
vid W. Matta is the Internal Vice-
President of the lnterFraternity Counsil,
and there are four brothers serving as
commitee chairman on IFC. Brock
Hamula was named Homecoming King
I and served as one of the Formal Open-
' ing Ceremonies chairmen for Greek 1
Week. Hamula was also given the Zol-
linger Awars for being the most out-
standing brother of Sigma Phi Epsilon
in the Western Pennsylvania/West Vir-
ginia region. In the Spring, both Hamula
and Matta were installed in the Order
I Omega Society. I
Sigma Phi Epsilon continues to com-
pete in intramural sports, and Sig Eps
participated in Greek Week for the third
year. As it moves proudly in to the
future at the University of Pittsburgh,
this fraternity will continue to be the
gentiernen of Sigma Phi Epsilon. I

Sigma Sigma Sigma National Soror-
ity has acheived many aspirations since
their recolonization three years ago.
They are proud of their many on-
campus accomplishments including
the fourth place overall award at Greek
Week. Through their 1992 Greek Week
sponsor, United Cerebal Palsy, many of
their sisters gained outstanding intern-
ships working internally with the or—
ganization throughout the year.

Nationally they were recognized with
the 1992 National Education Award for
the best chapter scholarship program.
Among other national recognitions,
they also received an awars for a
“Honor Roll Chapter.”

Along with raising money for (ICP
they also spent much time and effort
raising funds for their philanthropy
“Robbie Page Memorial-Play Therapy
for Children.” The sisters have par-
ticipated in the volunteer program at
Children's Hospital also.

Sigma Sigma Sigma remains a
strong united chapter at Pitt. Through
their growing rush program and sis-

their sorority tradition will have con-

More Than Just The Home of Pitt

Oakland is the

the home of the
University, an end-

dance of college
students, but it is
the home of fami-

Oakland is a
family community.
Iust take a look at
any of the streets
which surround the
hub of the Pitt cam-

find that not only
do students live
there but families
as well. This

nent residents and
temporary resi-
dents.

Though one would
often think how
can families live in
an area where
there is a large
concentration of
college students?
What about all
those wild parties
that students are
always having,
don't they wreck
havoc with family
life? Though this
may be true in
some instances, it
is generally the ex-
ception to the rule.
Pitt students on the
whole work with
these families to
provide a better
environment in
which to live. For

instance there is a
community crime
watch program in
which both perma-
nent residents and
college students
participate. This is
good for the entire
community, for
community mem-
bers are kept
abreast of all crime
happenings in the
community and
can be on their
guard for any such
occurances.
Oakland is like a
world of it's own for
it is home to many

‘ diverse individuals

of different cultures
and backgrounds.
This is unique, in
that within a such
a small radius one
can experience

many different cul- e

tures. If one is
searching" for cul-
ture all they" need
to do is visit the
Carnegie Musuem
or take a play in at
one of the many
theaters. Visitors to
the Oakland area
are suprised to dis-
cover the different
worlds that are
present in the com-
munity, for they
may have only
thought that Oak-
land was the home

land is more than

Panther Football

Marks A Winning Season

Even before a game
was played, the 1991
Pitt football season
was proclaimed by
many as a lost cause.
The loss of many key
players to transfers,
the NFL draft and ac-
ademic ineligibility,
left Pitt with a young
and mostly inexperi-
enced team. Surpris-
ingly, many under-
classmen stepped up
to meet the challenge
and made many sig-
nificant contribu-
tions.

The first game was

performance, redshirt
senior Steve Israel,
provided a lift for his
team. Israel intercept-
ed the first pass
thrown by WVU quar-
terback Darren Stud-
still and later re-
turned a kickoff 73
yards. Also, the rest
of the defense played
well as freshman
linebacker Tom
Tumulty recorded 1 1
tackles, and senior
linebacker Ricardo
McDonald was named
Big East Defensive
Player of the Week for
his dominating play.
The Panther home
opener looked to a
tough match up with
Southern Mississippi,
a bowl team last year.
It was again the Pitt
defense hat brought
Southern Miss to it's

knees. Early in the
first quarter, Steve Is-
rael intercepted yet
another pass and re-
turned it 81 yards for
Pitt's first touch-
down. In the second
quarter, Israel re-
turned a Southern
Miss punt from the
Pitt 39 for what
looked like his second
touchdown of the first
half, but it was called
back on account of a
penalty. Israel did not
let this stop him, as
he picked up a fumble
late in the game and
raced down the side-
line for a 35 yard
touchdown. Junior
defensive end Keith
Hamilton also

sparked the Panther
defense with two
sacks, four tackles for
losses and a pass de-

into making six turn-
overs compared to
Pitt's one. Quarter-
back Alex Van Pelt
had a good game com-
pleting 18 of 31 pass
attempts for 267
yards with one inter-
ception. Unfortunate-
1y, with the loss of
Curtis Martin, the
running game strug-
gled amassing only 69
yards. The lack of
time consuming
drives forced the de-
fense to be on the
field for almost 40
minutes. This took
it’s toll on the Pan-
ther D, as they were
unable to stop the
Oran emen’s last
drive. yracuse snuck
by the Panthers with
a last minute score
31-27.

Pitt lost it’s second
in a row, in the last
minute, against East
Carolina, one of the
nation's most un-
heard of teams. The
Pirates scored on
quarterback Jef
Blake’s two yard run
with 46 seconds re-
maining. The Pan-
thers last chance for a
win was stopped,

when receiver Chad
Askew was tackled at
the ECU 11 yard line
as time expired. The
Pitt offense was
somewhat successful
racking up a total 523
yards. Quarterback
Alex Van Pelt had a
monster day, in
which he passed for
369 yards. The prob-
lem again was that
many scorin oppor-
tunities were lown.
If there was a ame
this season tha the
Pitt players, coaches
and fans would want
to forget, it would be
the Saturday after-
noon “Boston Massa-
cre” on November 2,
1991. The Boston
College Golden Eagles
dominated the Pan-
thers in their 38-12
win. Darnell Camp-
bell ran through the
Pitt defensive line for
227 yards rushin .
Campbell’s 7.8 yar s
a carry overshadowed
Pitt sophomore run-
ning back Jermaine
Wil iams’ 146 yards
rushing. After start-
ing the season 5-0
and then losing four
in a row, the Panthers
started to show signs

of wear. They were
down to their last two
chances to salvage a
winning season.

The Pitt offense
was ready to play
against Rutgers with
A ex Van Pelt com-
pleting 21 of 34 pass-
es for 335 yards to
lead the Panthers to a
22-17 victory. Eight
different receivers
were on the other end
of Van Pelt’s comple-
tions. Curtis Martin
returned to action af-
ter missing three
games with a toe in-

jury. He ended the day

with 95 yards rushing
on 23 carries. The de-
fense nailed the coffin
shut when Ricardo
McDonald and Jeff
Esters sacked the
Scarlet Knight quar-
terback for a safety in
the last minute. This
win secured a win-
ning season for a Pan-
ther team that was
predicted by many to
struggle throughout
the entire season.
Almost everbody in
the country was pre-
dicting the Nittany
Lions to walk over the
Panthers on their way
to the Fiesta Bowl.

However, the Pitt
played tough in it’s
32-30 loss. The
problem for the
Panthers was their
inability to capital-

The .:Pitt volley-
bajl team finished
it's season with a
loss to Ohio State
in the NCAA Tour-
nament.

The Buckeyes
ended the Pan-
thers’ season by
defeating them
three games to one.

In addition to the
tough opponent,
the Panthers had
the disadvantage of
Big East Player of
the Year Ann Marie
Lucanie being at
less than 100 per-
cent, because she
aggravated an an-
k e injury in the
New Mexico tour-
nament.

Pitt did continue
its dominance of
the Big East by
winning all seven
conference match-
es, losing only one

game, on the way to
the regular-season
crown. They domi-
nated the conference
tournament, beating
Boston College 15-1,
15-0, 15-6 in the first
round, Providence 15-
7, 15-3, 15-5 in the
semifinals and Syra-
cuse 15-10, 15-11,
15-8 in the champi-
onship game. Lucanie
garnered Most Out-
standing Player of the
Tournament for the
second straight year.
“We went through
many phases this
season with injuries
and illness,” Pitt
head coach Sue
Woodstra said, look-
ing back on the sea-
son. “I’m proud of the
way the team stayed
together and played
well when it might
not have been so easy
for them to play well”

One goal that was
not fulfilled was mov-
ing up to the next lev-
el. Pitt did not win a
match against Top 20
competition. In addi-
tion to Ohio State,
there were two heart-
breaking losses to
Penn State and a late
season loss to eighth-
ranked New Mexico.
The Panthers still
might have ended up
in the Top 20 if not for
an early season
slump in which they
lost four of five, while
senior co-captain Sue
Zonneville was out
with mono. Zon-
neville was among six
seniors who finished
their volleyball ca-
reers at Pitt this sea-
son. Of the others, co-
captain and middle
hitter Dee MacAulay,
outside hitter Heather
Hollands, and outside

hitter Linda Zols were
starters this season.
Shelly Seanor and
Bridget Gary were the
first two players of
the bench when Gary
was healthy. The 5-
foot, 6-inch outside
hitter suffered
through knee and
shoulder problems in
addition to missing a
match due to food poi-
soning.

“They are a very
special class,” Wood-
stra said. “Each
brought something to
the team. They all
brought cohesiveness
to the team. I have
been involved with
many teams, and I
know how good it is to
have teammates you
enjoy playing with.”

A Team Not To Be Taken For Granted

The soccer season start-
ed on a high, “we had high
expectations coming into
the season because of last
season,” Junior forward A1
Lopus said. Coming in the
Panthers were a team to be
reckoned with, for as
“opposed to last year and
previous teams, we beat
the teams that we should
have beaten especially the
local teams, Carnegie Mel-
lon University, [UP and
Grove City. The difference
was that this year nobody
took us for granted. Last
year we beat some tough
teams. And they were
ready for us, so we couldn’t
sneak up on anyone,”
Lopus related. With this at-
titude the Panthers set off
on what became a roller-
coaster season.

The season kicked off
with a hardfought 2-0 win
against Geneva. This was
seen when sophomore Ted
Noethling bolted out past a
group of defenders, gained
control of the ball and slid
the shot past the goalkeep-
er scoring the Panthers
first goal.

Next, the Panthers, hop-
ing to avenge last year's
loss, took on Carnegie Mel-
lon. And they succeed beat-
ing Carnegie Mellon 1 -0. At
first it did not look like the
Panthers would win, for
the offense seemingly fell
apart, taking a few pot-
shots on the Tartan goal.

Senior Don
Overmeir runs it
down. Showing his
stuff.

Yet, they came alive with
15 minutes to play in the
half and started to fire
shots at the Tartan goal.
Victory was a hand and the
Panthers were 2-0 on the
season.

The Panthers opened Big
East play with a tie 1-1
against St. John's at Pitt
Stadium.

Next it was on to face
Canisius College. The Pan-
thers rocked Pitt Stadium
with a 4-0 win. The Pan-
thers controlled the game
from early on, led by first-
year player Eric Prex’s two
goals in the first-half.

Georgetown was next
and the Panthers ended up
on the losing end of a tough
fought battle, 4-3. The
bright spot of the day was
Eric Prex’s playing, with
the midfielder leading a
two-on-four Panther assu-
alt into the Georgetown
zone.

Strong defense was the
key in the battle, against
Marshall, to a scoreless tie.
This game saw excellent
goaltending by the Pan-
thers with netminder Tim
Sobelman making 10 saves
on route to his fourth shut-
out of the season.

In double overtime the
Panthers tied Big East
champs Boston College 1 -1.
Once again the key to this
game was the goaltending
by Sobelman and the re-
newed vigor of the offense.

The Panthers kicked on
the afterburners and
sorched the Slippery Rock
University Rockets 5-0.
The star of this game
proved to be co-captain
Nick Liberati scoring a hat
trick with two penalty
kicks and a free kick.

Overtime proved to be the
Panthers downfall against
Villanova, 3-1. The teams
only goal was scored by Er-
ic Prex, which sent them
into overtime, where the
Panthers surrendered two
breakaway goals.

The Panthers final home
game was a disappoint-
ment as they lost 2-0 to
Providence. The Panthers
got burned on the defense
as their non-aggressive
“wait-and-see" attitude

~ failed against the fast-

paced Friar offense.

The Panthers final mo-
ments of the season ended
with a sloppy tie against
Robert Morris. 2-2; a loss in
a rout to Syracuse,3-0; a
win over a run-of-the-mill
Grove City team, 3-0; and
the season ended with a
close loss to Seton Hall 2-1.

The Panthers finished
the season with a record of
6-7-4.

The Pitt men’s

wrapped up its sea-
Son with four con-
secutive losses.

Coming off two
convincing victo-
ries over IUP and
St. Francis of Pa.
with scores of 8-1
and 9-0, respec-
tively, managed to
win only five of its
last 35 matches
while losing four
straight to
Edinboro (8-1), Ak-
ron University [6-
3), Youngstown
State (8-1) and
Georgetown (8-0).

Head Coach

Dief-

George

fenbach said, “The
last few teams we
faced were very good
opponents, but I
know that everyone
gave 100 percent, and
I’m very proud of their
p e r f o r In a n c e
throughout the sea-
son.” The men fin-
ished the season with
12 wins and 1 1 loses.

Despite the poor
finish, Pitt’s season
was highlighted by
the record-setting
campaigns of seniors
John Tegano and Lar-
ry Garrard.

Tegano tallied 1 1
singles wins this
year, giving him 54
over his four-year Pitt

career.

This makes him
Pitt’s all-time leader
in singles victories,
surpassing the old
mark of 51 wins set
by Greg Campbell,
who graduated from
Pitt in 1987.

Larry Garrard post-
ed a solid singles rec-
ord this year with 13
wins and 13 losses.
He also added 5 wins
in doubles competi-
tion to close out his
career with 95 all-
purpose victories (51
singles, 44 doubles) -
another Panther rec-
ord. He, too, passed
up Greg Campbell for
top honors on that

list.

The men’s team
will be losing three
vital parts of its at-
tack when John
Tegano, Larry Gar-
rard and Joel Orth
graduate this year
along with Kayran
Ilkanipour.

The Pitt men’s
swimming team
capped off a decade
of dominance by
capturing its 10th
straight Big East
conference champi-
onship at Trees
Hall.

Pitt tallied 854.5
points to second-
place finisher Villa-
nova’s 577, far ex-
ceeding Big East
Coach of the Year
Chuck Knoles’
prophesy of a 200-
point margin of vic-
o .

“The team per-
formed magnificent-
1y," Knoles said. “It
was nice to watch
the guys rise to the
occasion and stay
focused throughout

L

L

the meet.”

Staying in focus was
the only challenge for
Pitt because the out-
come of the meet was
pretty apparent after
the first full day of
swimming. The team
of Joe Kozlina, David
Dodson, Zac Economos
and Eric Cornell began
the rout by setting a
new meet and pool rec-
ord in the 200-yard
free relay. This was to
be the first of 12 Pan-
ther victories in the 20
event meet.

Throughout the
year, Pitt’s greatest
strength had been the
sprint freestyle events,
and this meet was to
prove no different. Loz-
lina won the 50 free
and set meet and pool

records in the 100 free
and in anchoring the
400 free relay team.

First-year student
Matt Brady posted his
first of six team and in-
dividual victories by
posting a lifetime best
in the 200 individual
medley.

Brady speaking at
the meet’s halfway
point said, “No one
seemed to be into the
meet, we didn’t swim
out fastest, but we are
still (leading), and that
says something about
the other teams we are
s w i m m i n g
against. . .We are kill-
ing everybody.”

Coach Knoles agreed
that the competition
was not good enough to
really push his swim-

mers but contended
that parity with Pitt
and the rest of the con-
ference may not be
that far off.

Swimmer Eric
“Cubby” Mattson
crushed the meet rec-
ord in the 400 IM by
three seconds with a
time of 3:54.96. Don
Boyd swam a lifetime
best in the 100 (55.78)
and 200 breaststrokes
(2:01.l6) breaking his
own meet and pool
records.

Pitt finished the dual
meet season ranked
#23 in the nation by
the College Swimming
Coaches Association of
America, with a dual
meet record of 7-3.

Pitt Diving
Help On The Road To The Big East

270 ﬂ Athletics

In the Big East
meet, to no one’s
surprise, the Mi-
ami’s men team
swept the diving
events.

While Pitt’s Se-
an Braud placed
fourth on the 1-
and 3-meter
boards, and team-
mates Mike
Naylor and Phil
Cruz filled out the
fifth and sixth
slots.

“Overall this
meet went very
well,” said diving
coach Julian
Krug. “I knew
coming in here
that Miami is the
best team in the
country, and they
proved it. We are
on our way to hav-
ing a successful
NCAA qualifying
meet ourselves.”

Even though
the diving team

lost to Miami, its

the overall team
score helped to

ming and diving

ing Bi East meet.

The Pitt women’s
swim team's string of
nine consecutive Big
East championships
came to end with the
Big East champion-
ships this year.
Though the team did
finish in third place,
against the likes of
Villanova (first place)
and Miami (second
place), with 587
points.

For a gutsy Panther
squad that had faced
adversity all season,
the one-two combina-
tion of Miami and Vil-
lanova was too much
to overcome, despite
the fact that the team
swam by far its best
meet of the year. And
while Pitt head coach
David Belowich was
impressed by the per-
formance of the new
champs, he could not
have been prouder of
the efforts of his

team.

“This team did way
beyond what every-
one around them
would have thought
they were capable of
doing," Belowich
said. “I’m very, very
pleased with every
one of them. We did
n o t h a v e a b a d
swimm all weekend.”

Pitt's most impres-
sive performance
came from first-year
swimmer Christy
Knobloch, who placed
second in three
events : 1 00- and
200-yard backstroke
and 200 butterﬂy.

One of Pitt’s best
breaststroke special-
ists ever, Panther co-
captain Laura-Lee
Sullivan placed
fourth in the 1 00
breaststroke, fifth in
the 200 breaststroke
and seventh in the
200 individual med-

ley. Looking back on
the final meet of her
career, Sullivan chose
to unselfishly shower
accolades on her
teammates rather
than ponder her four
years as a Panther.

“I am so proud of
our team and how
we’ve competed,"
Sullivan said. “I was
glad to be a part of it.”

Every Pitt team
member has reason to
be proud of her ef-
forts, especially when
reviewing Pitt’s over-
all point total —
which included zero
first-place finishes.
Eighteen of the 19
athletes competing
for Pitt scored points,
with several team
members placing in
three different
events. Among those
who contributed with
fine efforts for Pitt
were Jen Burns

(fourth - 100 free,
fifth — 100 back),
Vicky Geubtner (sixth
- 100 back and 100
free), Laura Zdyb
(third — 400 IM), Crit
Gallagher (fifth —- 50
free), Noelle Barry
(seventh — 100 ﬂy),
Janine Atiyeh (sixth
— 200 back), Clare
Mcshane (seventh —
100 free) and Marga-
ret McC1urg (seventh
— 1,650 free).
Another first-year
athlete who stepped it
up a notch was
Geubtner, who
achieved career bests
in her three events.
On looking at the
meets scoreboard,
Geubtner found that
the final score was
not indicative of what
the meet was really
about, and what the
Pitt women had
acheived as a team.
“I think we won be-

cause we came to-

gether as a team,”
Geubtner said.
“From what I un-
derstand, (team
unity) is not much
of a tradition for
Pitt. I think we
started a new tra-
dition — being
close and caring for
everyone."

“In that respect.
we all think that
we won —. in our
heart, as a team,”
Geubtner said.

The Pitt women’s
team finished the
season with an
overall record of 3-
5.

Wrestling
Clinches A Winning Season

274 ﬂ Athletics

The Pitt wrestling
team closed out its
dual-meet season
with a 19-16 loss at
Kent State.

Panther head coach
Rande Sittlemyer said
his team was not
completely into wres-
tling this meet from a
mental standpoint,
but it was looking
ahead to the Eastern
Wrestling League
Championships.

“It was a frustrat-
ing night, but it’s be-
hind us now,” Stot-
tlemyer said.

If the Panthers
could have won just
one of the first six
bouts, the victory
would have been
theirs.

Heavyweight Perry
Miller scored a major
decision to conclude a
stellare, 23-1 regular
season. Stottlemyer
praised his four stal-
warts, who have com-
bined for an 84-16-3
mark.

“We didn't get

started until 167, and
we blew them away
after that,” Stot-
tlemyer said. “Those
four guys Wrestle
tou her than shoe
leat er.

Stottlemyer said he
is not overly con-
cerned aboput losing
this bout with the
EWLs staring Pitt
right in the face.

“The most impor-
tant thing is how we
prepare ourselves,”
he said. “This has no
bearin on what;s go-
ing to appen in two
weeks. It was kind of
anti-climatic at the
end of the year. We
had been up for so
many tough match-
es.”

Indeed, Pitt finished
with a dual-meet rec-
ord of 1 1-6, including
5-2 EWL mark. Of its
17 opponents, eight
were ranked amon
the nation’s Top 2
teams.

Pitt defeated two
Top 10 squads, Ohio

 

State and Clarion, as
well as ranked West
Virginia and Bloom-
sburg. Four of Pitt’s
six losses came at the
hands of ranked op-
position; Penn State,
Navy, Clemson and
Lock Haven. This was
a tremendous im-
provement over last
season's 4-12 dual
meet mark, which in-
cluded a 1-6 EWL
slate.

In the EWL, Pitt’s
Scott Hovan lost
tough match-up to
Penn State’s Tim
Whitman, 6-4 in over-
time. While Pitt’s Per-
ry Miller lost a tough
stru le to Clarion’s
Kurt Angle, 3-2 deci-
sion.

After the EWLs,
Pitt’s Scott Hovan
was named All-
American.

the Pitt men’s
gymnastics team
traveled down to
Columbus for a
meet with the na-
tionally ranked
Ohio State Buck-
eyes, not expect-

hoping to score
high as a team. Pit

The Panthers

The Buckeyes tal-
lied a total score of
281.10 points for
the meet. Ironical-

best score of the
year against its

throughly over-

Going Home

The Wait Continues

Here's the

scene. Break ( or a
long weekend) is
almost here, just a
few more days to
go and then it's
homeward bound
to catch up on
what's happening
and visit the family
and the dog.

The phone call to
home goes out.
Mom, Dad (or who-
ever usually takes
you home — may-
be your boyfriend
or girlfriend) could
you come and pick
me up please?

The usual reply
is sure when do
you want picked
up? (You think to
yourself "Lets see I
only have two
classes on Friday
and they aren't
very important -
since I usually
don't go to them
anyways — so I
could skip them
and go home a
day early. Or you
think maybe I
could go out Thurs-
day night — I think
C.I.'s has a special
— and get picked
up Friday after-

noon as soon as I
roll out of bed.")

To the parents you
say could you pick
me up Thursday
night? This is when
your mom usually
asks "Honey don't
you have Friday
classes?" Your
standard reply
would be "Mom
they cancelled
them earlier in the
week the profes-
sor, he's going out
of town."

Now your mom
believing every
word of what you
just told her (yeah
get real, if she's
anything like my
mom, she'll say
sure now go to
class, and I'll pick
you up on Friday.
At which I would
opt for the going
out option. Hey,
you already decid-
ed to cut your
classes anyways.)

So it's decided
your going home
Thursday (or may-
be Friday if you
lucked out). Time to
get everything
packed up. It's not
hard you just have
to take your dirty

laundry basket
that's bursting
home.

Now just the
wait. You get your
friends to help you
carry all your stuff
down to the front of
the building. The
waiting has begun
will they ever get
here? (If it's winter
be warned you
may freeze to
death, and your
parents will have
to carry home the
frozen popsicle
that resembles
you.)

Finally, they
have arrived. Your
mom takes a gan-
der at all the stuff
you have waiting
to go home and
asks "What do you
think this car is a
moving van?" You
reply it's not that
much MOM! You
load it into the car,
get in and take off.

The screen fades
to black as you
wait to get out of
the Quad and
head down Fifth
Avenue. The End.

The Making Of New Friends

Dorm life, it.has
a certain mystique
about it. To some
the image that
comes to mind is
college students
living in little tiny
hovels provided by
the University. To
those of us who ac-
tually live in the
dorms, the image
that comes to mind
is one of living with
a bunch of friends,
who become your
new family.

Dorm life is
about being a fam-
ﬂy, at least it has
been for me. When
I moved into the
dorms, during my
junior year, I met a
lot of new people,
who became very
close friends.
Which was very

Dorm Life

easy to do living in
the Towers, since

‘so many people

can be found
hanging out all
over the place. It
seemed to be that
share and share
alike was the motto
of the year, with
everyone sharing
everything from
food to advice.
The same was
true when I moved
into my new room
this past year. Liv-
ing in Holland Hall
has given me the
opportunity to met
new people and
make lasting
friendships. I just
don't consider the
people on my floor
to be my friends, I
consider them to
be my family. We
are a close-knit

group, who regard
each other as sis-
ters. Which makes
life totally bear-
able, for if you
want someone to
go with you to
check mail or go to
the "O" at 3am,
you can find some-
one to go with you.

It may seem that
dorm life is all ros-
es, it isn't. With
everyone being so
close, eventually
people start getting
on your nerves
and little fights
break out. Not the
fist fight variety,
but little caty fights
that are full of ver-
bal barbs. This
kind of tension usu-
ally necessitates
calling the R.A..
Usually the R.A.
will call all the par-

ties involved to-
gether and have
an open air discus-
sion about the
problem. This usu-
ally works, and it's
almost back to nor-
mal.

Though living in
the dorms does
have it's draw-
backs, such as
signing in every
guest (though we
know it's for our
protection, it be-
comes a nuisance),

What Do You Do With Your Room?

what do you do

with your dorm
room? That is the
question of the
day.

When you move
into your room, the
walls are bare just
begging to be cov-
ered with posters
and memorabila,
the desks are emp-
ty just waiting to be
filled with your
clutter, everything
is empty and just
waiting for you to
take over. When
you move in and
take over, your
room becomes an
extension of your
personality along
with the personal-
ity of your room-

mate, if you have

one.

This was the
case of when I
moved into my
room in Holland

Hall. I had an idea
of how I wanted to
decorate, so I set
off on a mission to
decorate.

The posters
came out of their
tube, I brought
them with me from
home (well actual-
ly some of them
graced the walls of
my room last year
in the Towers), and
were put up on the
wall. I even went
as far as to give my
wall(s) a name —
The Wall of
Shame . As the
tenn went on more
things found them-
selves on my walls.
My walls are now
covered with a va-
riety of posters,
mainly hot looking
guys and alcohol
related ones, I
plastered alcohol
ads around the top
of the walls, and

plenty of pictures
of me and all my
friends adorn the
area where post-
ers don't. Do your
walls look any-
thing like this?
Though if you're a
guy, you probably
have girl posters
on your walls.

I even have a
trophy area. They
are not the tradi-
tional trophies, but
rather they are a
collection of all the
bottles I have
drank over the
course of the year.
Though I know that
this idea is not
original, for I stole
it from friends of
mine, Iimbo and
Chew, who had a
similar display last
year. Maybe now
that you know this
idea you'll steal it
too. Go right
ahead, it's cool

with me.

I love my side of
the room, because
it is totally me. But
my roommates
side is a different
story. Our room
looks like you've
stepped into the
twilight zone with
all the different
decorating ideas
present. My roomie
is the exact U.) o-
site of me, she ' es
posters, prints, of
various artists such
as Van Gogh, Mo-
net and O'Keefe.
This makes our
room look like an
art museum on her
side and a wall of
graffiti on mine.
Thems the breaks,
and that's life.

So what have
you done to your
room? If it's, any
thing that's great
let us know and
we'll probably

   
 
    
  
    
  

steal it from you.

Doing Your Laundry Towers Style

Laundry, it's a never end-
ing story. It usually goes like
this. You're getting ready to
go out and have your outﬁt
all planned out. Your are
styling tonight hoping to
catch that special someone’s
eye. As you are getting
ready you can't find you fa-
vorite jeans or shirt. Where
did it go? Oh no, I wore it last
week, and I haven't done
laundryl

You have two choices (l) dig
through your dirty laundry to
find it, and hope that it
doesn't smell too bad or (2)
do your laundry so that you
can wear it.

You think to yourself I
have the time to wash a load
(you have two hours until
you're planning to leave). So
you get your quarters
(remember to save them up
for they are a precious com-
modify), laundry soap, dryer
sheets and of course your
dirty laundry.

You head to the laundry
room. You're in luck there is
one washer open. So you
snag it and dump your
clothes and the soap in and
set out to wait. Finally, they
are done washing, and it
only took 45 minutes.

Next, to find a dryer, you
spy one hiding in the comer
that is open. In go the clothes
and you wait again. The dry-
er is done, you reach in to
get your dry clothes only to
ﬁnd that they are soaking, so
you feed the machine again
and pray that they get done.
It stops, and you reach in
they are finally done and it
only took a little over two
hours to do it. Better hurry
back to your room and get
ready, you're late.

Recently, the Tow-
ers of a new addition
— he Towers Ex-
press.

The Towers Express,
located near the
mailroom in the Tower
B area, is a little store,
aimed at servicing the
needs of the Towers
resident's and also
those students living in
the Schenley Quad
area. The store fea-
tures candy. pop (or
soda to those of you
who are not native Pitt-
sburgher's), fast food,
such as microwave
burritos, hamburgers,
hoagies. pizza, etc.,
snacks like potato
chips, Doritos, pretzels,
health and beauty
items, like soap and
tissues (yes, even if
you run out of T.P. you
can pick up a roll

:54 * Student Life

here), laundry sup-
plies, ice cream and
coffee.

The store is clearly a
bonus for on-campus
students for they do not
need to go outside to
purchase a snack or
get some coffee to stay
awake. The store is
open to midnight sev-
en days a week.

The best fact of the
store is that it accepts
choice dollars. Which
means that if a student
has the munchies, but
has no cash. they can
still get something to
snack on by using their
choice dollars.

So if you want to
grab something to eat
just stop by the Towers
Express and pick your-
self up something.

For students, living

mail is a very happy
event. Normally it goes
like this. You get up
around noon (earlier if
you lucked out and
have morning classes),
jump in the shower. get
dressed. check out to
see who is out and
about on the floor, find
your friends and see if
they want to go to
lunch.

On your way to the

during each meal.
Students have their
choice of two or
three offered en-

side dishes. Al-

The meals that

And for students

such as a low sug-

The Chances of Getting Housing

The low clouds held
the Land of the Oak
(otherwise known as
Oakland) in a death
grip. This place is the
home of the University
of Pittsburgh. Today,
the tenth day of the
second month of the
year nineteen hundred
and ninety two, the
fates of many young-
sters will be deter-
mined. For today is the
Lottery. Like the name
of the maiden to be
sacrificed to the beast
of medieval legends is
chosen out of a wicker
basket, many students
who wish to gain the
high honor of on-
campus housing, must
pick a number out of
the Plexiglass box.
Those choosing a num-
ber below the rounded
sum of one thousand
are the lucky one,
those that do not, will
have to face the real
world and begin a
quest for an apart-
ment. Or maybe even

folks in the family cot-
tage for a year.

This ritualistic event
takes place on the first
ﬂoor of the Towers that
Dominate the Universi-
ty Skyline (otherwise
known as Tower A).
Many students from
afar (Lothrop Hall,
Forbes Hall and off-
campus apartment
dwellers) and near (the
Towers themselves
and the Schenely
Quad) will gather in
the circular lobby of
Tower A. There they
will pray to the fate
goddessess that they
choose a low number.
If one listens enough,
they can hear the
Choosers Creed whis-
pered in low, desper-
ate tones: Please oh

know my own hand
determines my own
fate and I should not

The line will move
as slow as the gravy
served in the under-
ground cafeteria. The
gravy is alive, but due
to the unfortunate cir-
cumstances, the stu-
dents are not. They
have entered The
State of the Penetrat-
ing Stare. This is a
harmless temporary
plague that is caused
by the monotonous
dread one begins to
feel by waiting until
that fateful moment
when one's life could

changed. Unfortunate-
ly for the walls, ﬂoor
and ceiling, who are
often the ones left with
scars of ‘eye marks’
caused by being

this ailment is highly
contagious.

As the student en-

they know that they

Spring Break 1992

Pitt Students Hit Panama City Beach

Spring Break, it
brings to mind im-
ages of college stu-
dents converging
on a Florida town
and running wild
for a week. Though
some would like to
disagree with me
on this point, this is
exactly what hap-
pened for the most
part (we weren't
that wild, but we
were wild).

This year'_s__ trip,
sponsored by Pitt
Program Council,
was to Pananma
City Beach, Flori-

da. I had the pleas-

ure of going on this
remarkable, mem-
orable week long
extravaganza. So
let me tell you
about my trip, and
all the good times
we had.

Weeks before we
actually even
headed down the
highway, my
friends Shelly, Lisa
and I started plan-
ning for the trip.
We started a
Spring Break
countdown three
weeks before we
left. It seemed as
though Spring
Break would never
get here. We were
aH packed and
ready to go a week
in advance (talk
about being pre-
pared, we were),
the bathing suits (of
course lots of biki-
ni's for you guys
reading this arti-
cle), suntan lotion,
and a few clothes
for nighttime activ-
ities.

Finally, it was
Friday, the day we

were supposed to
leave. It was off to
the Union to get
signed in and
board the bus, you
should have seen
us trying to carry
all our luggage to
the Union from
Holland Hall, what
a sight to behold.
The air of excite-
ment was running
high once we got
into the Union and
saw all the other
fellow Spring
Breakers waiting
in line. Time to
load up the stuff on
the bus. Bus #3, my
bus, was a fun bus.
Everyone got to
basically know
everyone throug
drinking games
(remember it was a
no ‘holds barred
drink-a-thon on the
bus), the only way

to pass the bus trip
was to be either
drunk or really
buzzed. Though,
the buses were
equipped with
T.V's and a VCR,
so we watched
movies, like Bill
and Ted's Bogus
Iourney, Major
League, on the
way.
Our first rest stop,
in West Virginia,
saw a numerous
amount of stu-
dents, yours truly
included, heading
off towards Giant
Eagle to replenish
their alcohol sup-
plies. Back onto the
bus, we had been
fed and stocked up
on supplies, and off
we go towards
Florida.

The ride down
was a long on, we

made it in 24
hours (if you ever
take a trip like
this take your
walkman, plenty
of tapes and CI
large amount of
alcohol). F inally;

lar, and beneath
us was the pool
deck complete with
bar and grill. And
ICF, the company
through which we
had booked our
tour, sponsored
daily activities,
such as belly-ﬂop
contests, lip-
synching, bikini
contests, best male
bod contests, wet
boxer con-
test,stupid human
tricks and the all
popular wet T-shirt
contests.

Next, we got to
meet our other
roommate, Moni-
ca. Then it was out
to the balcony to
check out the ac-
tion going on all
around us. Our
neighbors were
nice, we became
friends and partied
with them.

Nighttime fell.
and Monica and I
were off to check
out the club action.
We took the shutﬂe
that ran along the
strip, and after one
trip, which took for-
ever, we decided it
was time to rent a
car. This was the
best idea ever, get-

42 & Student Life

ting the car, for it
allowed us to see
what was happen-
ing all over.

On to day two,
Sunday. It was the
most gorgeous day
that we had, tem-
peratures were in
the mid-80's and
the sun was out in
full force. So we
decided to hit the
beach, after we
picked up the car.
The beach was ter-
rific, white sand
beaches and clear
blue Gulf water.
This was the day
that most of the
breakers got a tan
or in cases like
mine, burns. The
day was spent
drinking on the
beach with friends,
playing some vol-
leyball, swimming
in the ocean, toss-
ing the frisbee
around and gener-
ally having a good
time.

Good news, MTV
was filming their
special Spring
Break Edition right
there in Panama
City Beach. Off to
the clubs, to see if
we could get on
T.V. and have all
our friends envy
us. Monica and I
decided to hit Spin-
naker's. What a
cool place to hang
out. That night we
saw Ugly Kid Ioe
and War Babies in
concert they
rocked the place

for three hours.
Later on ELI came
on, and Monica
and I got to go
backstage and
meet the band.
Back to the hotel,
it's time for bed at
4am (Panama City
Beach parties late).

Monday and
we're seen cruising
the strip checking
out guys (we're
normal healthy fe-
males please, this
is a national past-
time!). As we were
driving down the
strip, near the
Ramada, I spotted
a guy that looked
familiar. He was
wearing a LA.
Kings hockey jer-
sey and had long
black hair, I could
have sworn that he
was the guitarist
for Ugly Kid Ioe.
Monica didn't be-
lieve me at first,
until I turned
around a repassed
him. It was him. So
being the kind
women that we
are, we stopped
and picked him
and his two friends
up. Guess what? It
was really him —
Roger. We got his
autograph, Monica
on her Ugly Kid Ioe
T-shirt what fate
would have it that
she should be
wearing it, one for
my best friend
Danelle and of
course one for me.
He was great and

invited us to party
with him later at
Spinnakers.
Abrupt dash
back to the hotel to
change into our
party gear (we
would never go
partying in T-shirts
and shorts), it was
time to get the big
guns out. On to
Spinnakers for an-
other night. We got
to meet the rest of
the band and par-
tied into the wee
hours of the mom.
T u e s d a y
dawned bright and
cool, the tempera-
ture had dropped
into the mid-50's.
Though back home
the reports were
that Pittsburgh had
gotten five to six
inches of snow.
Boy were we glad
we were in Florida,
even though it was
in the mid-50's.
Shopping and
cruising was the
plan for the day.
Then later it was
drinking, partying
in the hotel. We
learned how to do
Tooters. I'll bet
you're wondering,
what the hell is a
Tooter? Well, it is a
shot (some of you
may know it as a
shooter) in a test
tube that is
slammed down. It's
a great way to get
drunk quickly for
the ingredients in-
volve a flavor of
Kool-Aid and hard

alcohol, like
Vodka or Rum
mixed. Nigljt

The Fun Wraps Up

Thursday, the
week was almost
over, only two days
left. The weather
was still the same.
More cruising
around and check-
ing things out.

Shopping was
fun, I got the best
air-brushed shirt
complete with
growling panther
(don't worry you'll
see a picture of it
around here some-
where). The lip-
synch contest was
supposed to be to-
day, but it was post-
poned on account
of rain. Which sort
of bummed me out,
since I was sup-
posed to be in it. But
we made up for it
by going out to a
seafood buffet with
friends from Wis-
consin (what a

drive they must
have had, though
not as bad as the
guys we met from
Alaska). Can you
guess what came
next? If you
guessed Spinna-

kers your right.

Once again it was a
party until the wee
hours of the morn.
Though that night
was special, at least
if your were female
it was, for a male
dance/strip show
was there Male
Factor. It was a lot
of fun, though don't
ever let my mom
know she would
probably flip out
though not for the
usual reasons, she
would have wished
that she was there.
Friday, our last
full day in Florida
same old weather

(yuck). Time to get
some last minute
shopping done, you
know buy some-
thing for the par-
ents. I finally got to
do my lip-synching.
I did Van Halen's
Runaround off of
For Unlawful Car-
nal Knowledge for
my first song and
was given Popeye
the Sailor Man to do
for my second num-
ber. It was fun, I
had Runaround
down pat, but I
sucked doing
Popeye, for I didn't
know the words. As
you guessed it, I
didn't win, though
Pitt people did. Way
to go Pitt! Time to hit
some parties and
then off to Spinna-
kers (we had to end
it with style). As us-
ual party on till

dawn. No way!
Way dude! (Sorry, I
just had to throw
Wayne and Garth
in there, honest the
devil made me do
it.)

Saturday, yeah,
the weather cleared
up, it was now in
the mid-60's time to
work on that last
minute tanning. We
layed out and froze.
One does not look
good wearing a bi-
kini and goose-
bumps. Though do-
ing this is sure to
make you catch a
cold (did you too
come back from
break with a cold, I
know I did). Finish
packing, boy how
did I ever fit all this
stuff in here in the
first place, and I
have even more
stuff to take back.

Many students
were seen sitting
(or in my case
laying) on their
luggage to get it
closed. Back on

the bus. The way ,

to go is to take a
few sleeping pills
and sleep the ride

back away as my .

roommates did.

Continuing her suc-

in recent years, sing-

charts with her latest
album "Spellbound."

On the movie scene,
the body-buﬂding, ac-
tion-adventure actor,
Arnold Schwarzeneg-
ger was a bit hit in the
extremely successful

  
  

movie Terminator 2:
Iudgment Day. This
movie was the most
expensive ever made
with a price tag of
more than $90 million.
The sports scene
saw Dan Marino, a for-
mer Pitt quarterback,
now the golden-armed
quarterback of the Mi-
ami Dolphins sign a
$25 rn.illion contract in

 

the fall of 1991.

The most breaking
sports news story of
1992 dealt with basket-
ball star "Magic" John-

nounced his retirement
from pro-basketball for
a very astonishing rea-
son — he had tested
positive for the HIV vi-

World Events

On the Home Front

As the school year

began, many different
happenings were tak-
ing place both at home
and throughout the
world. These happen-
ing and upheavels
have not only left their
mark on their individ-
ual communities, but
have also effectively
marked our lives and
our futures as well.

On the home front,
yes in the good old
U.S.A., we found that
President George Bush
nominated Clarence
Thomas to replace re-
tiring Iustice Thurgood
Marshall on the Su-
preme Court. -

Thomas, a 43-year-
old conservative Re-
publican, faced a hor-

rendous confirmation
process that lasted for
approximately three
months. After the se-
ries of public hearings,
the Senate Iudiciary
Committee split 7-7 on
his confirmation.
Though just before the
full Senate was to vote,
serious allegations of
sexual harassment
were brought forth by
Professor Anita P. Hill.

Professor Hill, a 35-
year-old law professor
from the University of
Oklahoma and a for-
mer assistant to Thom-
as at the E.E.O.C.,
claimed that she was a
victim of sexual har-
assment, from Thomas,
while the two had
worked together some
10 years earlier.

The Senate commit-
tee reconvened and
heard testimony from
Thomas and Hill and a
group of supporters
from both sides. This
testimony was broad-
cast on the major tel-
evision networks for
nearly a week, holding
the country in sus-
pense as to the final
outcome. The full Sen-
ate then debated the
issue at hand and vot-
ed to confirm Thomas,
52-48, to the Supreme
Court.

Terry Anderson, af-
ter being held ‘for near-
ly seven years as a
hostage, was released
on December 4, 1991.
Anderson spent 2,455
days as a hostage in
Lebanon, becoming

the longest held Amer-
ican hostage. After be-
ing freed he arrived in
Wiesbaden, Germany,
to be greeted by his
sister, Peggy Say.

Late in 1991 ﬂoods
hit Texas causing ex-
tensive damage. Many
parts ‘of Texas were
underwater not only
causing property loss,
livestock loss, but hu-
man tradegy. Texans
lost their home under
this avalanche of un-
expected rainfall.
Firefighters were busy
saving not only human
lives but animals as
well.

Along nomination
lines, President Bush
nominated Robert M.
Gates to head the Cen-
tral Intelligence Agen-

  
  
   
   
  
  
   
  
   
  
   
  
  
   
 

cy, Gates, a 48-
year-old deputy na-
tional security advi-
sor to the president,
was a former No. 2
man at the CIA. _»

The New York
Stock Exchange
was on a roll, with
regular closings
over the 3,000 mark.
Even though the
country was still in a
recession, the U.S. 
stock market contin— :3
ued to hit new highs.

f;The, international
scene took on a new
outlook this year. At-
tention was drawn,
by international en-
vironmentalists, to
the plight of the Bra-
zilian rain forest.
T h o u so n d s o f

est were being cut

cutting of the rain

by environmental-
tsts for‘ the serious

forces ignited hun-

from these wells for
many months.

The main interna-
tional event that struck
many individuals
around the world, be-
gan on August 19,
1991. That being the
coup that took place in
the Soviet Union. Vice
President Gennady
Yanayev, leading an
eight-man committee,
took power from Pres-
ident Mikhail S.
Gorbachev, saying
that the later was ill. As
Russian President
Boriz Yeltsin called
upon Russians to resist
the coup. tanks and
other military equip-
ment rolled into Mos-

Latvia and Estonia,

In the later part of
1991, the world saw an
event that would for-
ever change the polit-
ical map of the world.
The Soviet Union
broke up into frag-
ments. The Soviet Un-
ion as we had known it
was no more. Presi-
dent Mikhail S.

down as the leader of

In Yugoslavia a civil

disassembled the
country into six diver-

these republics, Cro-
atia and Slovenia, had
declared their inde-
pendence from the fed-
eration in Iune of 1991.

omputer Labs

4

Most of Pitt’s students do not own a
personal computer and printer of their
own and take advantage of the many
computer labs throughout campus.
Since they are paying to use the com-
puters, students figure they should get
the most out of their money that goes
to the University. There are several
computer labs around campus includ-
ing ones in the Cathedral of Learning,
David Lawrence, Forbes Quadrangle,
and Hillman Library to name just a few.

The University has made it faster
and easier for students to gain access
to the computers. A start-up disc is no
longer needed to begin work on the
computer. This makes it easier for stu-
dents to enter the computer lab and
begin to work as soon as possible.

Eventhough there are many com-
puter labs throughout campus, there is
always need for more. The students
writing papers for midterms and finals
realize this. Because there are so many
students attending the University need-
ing papers completed on the same
week, the lines in the computer labs

are very long. People wait hours just to
be able to use a computer. Since some of
the labs are open twenty-four hours,
some students try to go to the labs at off
hours, like three in the morning. During
finals week, however, this still does not
work because other students have the
same idea.

Increasing the number of computer
labs would help the problem a little, but
there will always be students waiting until
an hour before a paper is do to type it. If
they would have done it earlier they
would not have the problem of long lines.
I do not think anything will really solve
the problem of the shortage of comput-
ers. The only solution I see is making sure
you get your papers written and printed
out before the finals rush begins.

Beautiful
Rooms

ationality Rooms

The Nationality Rooms are located on
the first ﬂoor of the Cathedral of Learn-
ing. These various rooms attract tourists
from around the world. The rooms rep-
resent different aspects of the countries
they wish to be like. They are decorated
in the same exact way they would look in
the country. The many rooms represent
countries like Poland France, and Ger-
many to name just a few.

Approximately thirty thousand visitors
come to the University of Pittsburgh to
take part in the Quo Vadis tours and
almost twice that number visit the rooms
at their own leisure.

Each room has it’s very own distinctive
decor because of the country it repre-
sents. The furniture in each of the rooms
is shipped directly from the country that
it represents. Because the furniture is
shipped from the country, the ethnicity
can clearly be seen in each of the rooms.
The Christmas season is a special time
for the Nationality Rooms because they
are decorated according the the individ-
ual country’s customs.

It is the diversity of the Nationality

Rooms that help to give the University
of Pittsburgh it’s own sense of diversity
because the rooms give the feel and
texture of so many different nations. If
you have a spare minute I would rec-
ommend visiting the Nationality Rooms
in the Cathedral of Learning.

Go to class?

kipping Classes

 

It’s 7:59am, you’re all snug in your bed
enjoying a great dream (I don’t know what it
is-it’s your dream not mine) and wishing this
could go on forever. Then reality intrudes, it’s
now 8:00am and your favorite thing Mr.
Alarm Clock has just gone off waking you out
of your euphoric state with its infernal buzzing
or ringing. You reach over to shut the blasted
thing off hitting it with slightly more force that
necessary. The thought shoots instanteously
through your mind, do I really want to get up
and go to class or do I want to stay in my nice
warm bed and grab some much needed beau-
ty sleep?

Skipping class is a part of the university
system that is hard to get around. Many
students don’t want to go to class when they
have something better to do, such as sleep or
go out with their friends. Finding an excuse
not to go to class is easy.

Recently the staff of Panther Prints set out
on a mission, what mission was that? It was to
find out the best excuse(s) for not going to
class and we went to the sources themselves,
the studentbody. Here’s the top 14 (in the
tradition of David Lettermans top 10 lists)
excuses for not going to class (Paul some
music please):

14. Mom and Dad will never know!!

13. Your room caught on fire and all your
books were burnt.

12. I might as well waste some more mon-

ey at Pitt.

1 1. Your bed is warmer than the air you have
to walk through to get to class.

10. Because I can!

9. I thought that I would give the other kids a
chance to answer some questions.

8. I don’t want to miss my “soap.”

7. Ba-da-boom, Ba-da-bing!

6. I had a better offer.

5. I don’t want to be too smart!

4. One out of 300 persons won’t be missed.

3. I was malnurished from the cafeteria food
and did not have the strength to get out of bed.

2. If I do go to class today, there is a slight
chance that a tick will jump from the grass to my
clothes, bite my skin, and give me Lyme dis-
iease, so I’m better off just taking a NAP!!

And our number one excuse for not going to
class comes to us from John Mastrian, Soph-
omore.

1. One doesn’t completely experience college
until he misses class and gets behind!!!

direct links with employers that offer
these interships, the Pitt Placement Cent-
er is geared to enable students to gain
practical training in their special field of
interest. The philosophy of the center is
to create an awareness of the business
world within the university setting. Since
finding a job in today’s job market is
difficult for even the birghtest students,
the Placement Center is a place where
most students go who are looking for
‘obs.

1 Over 500 companies actively recruit
new employees through the Pitt Place-
ment Center. They also help graduating
seniors obtain jobs in their field of study.
One way they help senior students find
jobs is by planning workshops to help

them “polish” their resumes. This
helps students by letting them know
what potential employers are looking
for when the students go on interviews.

Some undergraduate students do
not know what they want to major in.
The Placement Center helps them also.
They give the students “tests” to find
out what they are most interested in.
This helps the students realize the ca-
reer that want to enter.

Need help?

 

 

The Learning Skills Center is located
on the third ﬂoor of the William Pitt
Union. Here, students can meet individ-
ually with their teaching assistants from
their classes or receive private tutorial
services. If a student is in need of private
tutoring he or she can seek the help they
need there.

The Learning Skills Center is also de-
signed for those students who are in-
terested in developing more efficient and
effective ways of studying. Many students
do not do well on exams because of the
anxiety they have at exam time. In order
to help students in this way, the LSC
offers Study Skills Workshops, Individual
Study Skills, Various Study Skills, Mini
Workshops, and study skills assesments.
Many of these workshops are held at the
beginning of each semester and again
before finals to help students cope with
the anxiety of taking final exams. Stu-
dents are helped alot with their finals
when they attend these workshops.

Many students take advantage of the
services the LSC has to offer. Each year
the Learning Skills Center helps approx-

imately two thousand students. All pro-
grams help students earn better exam
scores to boost their Q.P.A. The LSC
is a vital part of learning at the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh. If you are having
any type of difficulties in any of your
classes, I would recommend visiting the
third floor of The William Pitt Union as
soon as possible.

Library anyone?

tudying

Did you ever notice anyone walk-
ing around campus with their heads
buried in their text-books? Many
people find it useful to study on their
way to class. Although, this is not
the only unique form of studying
here at the University of Pittsburgh.
It is common to find the lounges oc-
cupied during the late night hours
with students vigorously trying to
accomplish what they consider to be
studying. More likely known as
cramming, which seems to be the
most popular form of studying on
campus.

Other insomniacs prefer to go to
the William Pitt Union and the Ca-
thedral to study for those dreadful
exams. The Union offers late night
study from 1 1pm to 2am during the
week. On the other hand, the Ca-
thedral is opened 24 hours.

Some students are satisfied study-
ing in the comforts of their own dorm
room or apartment. Many enjoy re-
laxing on their bed while studying,
while others feel they work better at
a desk.

Some students may prefer a dif-
ferent place or type of studying
which suits their needs better than
those which are more traditional.

Whatever way you enjoy studyin
the most, or feel is the most pro -
itable way of studying, the best of
luck goes out to you on those most
feare exams.

Cheating?

onesty Policy

 

Many students at the University of
Pittsburgh spend hours upon hours
studying in the various libraries around

‘ campus, such as Hillman Library.

These students have no reason to look
off of the test paper of a fellow student.
There are other students, however,
who do not see the need to study very
hard because they are taking a class
that it is easy to cheat.

Most professors try to make it hard
to cheat by making students sit every
other seat. They also use many dif-

T ferent versions of a test and alternate

them throughout the rows or by every
other person. Also, at least in the class-
es I have taken, there are UTA’s walk-
ing through the aisles ready to answer
questions and catch cheaters.

While some professors make it dif-
ficult to cheat, others do not spend
much time worrying about this and do
not take the cheating precautions other
professors do. Instead, they let the stu-
dents sit wherever they want and do
not rotate tests, but give the same
exact version of the exam to every

student. This type of class is ideal for
people who do not study because it is so
easy for them to cheat off of their neigh-
bor of the unsuspecting person in front of
them. It is very frustrating, on the other-
hand, for students who spend long hours
studying because these people get away
with cheating and receive the same
grades on the exams as they do.

If a person is caught cheating on an
exam or plagiarizing someone else’s work
it is usually up to the professor involved
to decide upon the type of punishment
that the student or students will receive.
Professors usually let students know up
front what their honesty policy is by in-
cluding on their syllabus. Their policies
are no surprise to the student because ho
or she usually receives an automatic F for
the exam and the course.

That time again?

egistration

If one word can strike fear into the heart of a Pitt
students, it is Registration. For, it brings about fond
memories of waiting in line forever and possibly a day
just to get classes for next term.

The process starts out innocently enough. First, the
course description guides and time schedules come out.
There is a mad rush up to Thackery Hall. To an
observer on the first and second floors, it must look like
the University is giving something free away (you know
us college students-if it’s free we’ll be there to get it).
This is the easy part of registration the hard part comes
later on.

Next, after you have the description guide and time
schedule in your hot little hands, you need to call your
advisor to set up an advising appojnment. Though if you
have not as yet declared your major, your advisor will
have sent out a flyer informing you and his/her other
advisees when your advising session will be. You then
get to visit your advisor, once again up at Thackery,
where he / she will review your transcripts and tell you
what requirements you still need to meet. You set up a
registration appointment.

After you know what classes you need to take for
next term, sitting down in front of the description guide
and time schedule comes next. This is the fun part,
trying to decipher the guide and schedule to find the
perfect schedule. It usually happens this way, the one
class that youi are dying to take is offered at the same
time where you already have a class scheduled. Axe
that class and on to the next. Eventually you come up
with a schedule that you like, though not necessarily
love (you still have Friday classes, but what else is new).

Back to your advisor for the registration appointment.
He / she looks over your schedule to see that it fits. Then
wham!! He/ she types it into the computer to see if your
classes are still open. Yeah! Only one class is closed, but
we’re prepared for that, you just open the guides back
up and find another class. Simple right? Wrong. Here we

go again, leafing through those descriptions and
times, aha finally a class that seems interesting anf
fits into your schedule. And the good news is, it isn’t
closed. Time to go and stand in line at Thackery.

Here it is the moment is upon us, you're finally in
line for registration. Though if this is the first or
second day of registration be prepared to wait. Usu-
ally the line is to the door by 8am, but never fear it is
only a two hour wait from here.

Finally, you’ve made it into the registration office,
they take your form, and you get to sit down for
another little wait. Did you actually here it right? Did
the registration lady really call your name. Definitely,
you jump out of your seat with a spurt of enthusiasm
and follow her to another person that will help you.
As you sit down, you send many prayers heavens
bound, just hoping that none of the classes are
closed. The nameless registration individual types
you schedule into the computer. It takes a minute to
come up. And what do we see, that all your classes
are still open, and you got a seat.

Breathing a sigh of relief, you grab your validated
copy of your registration schedule, turn and walk out
the door with a very large smile plastered on your
face. The final scene of this scenario involves you
walking through the doors of Thackery off into the
sunset. Fade to black. The End.

Just snoozing

ibrary Sleeping

 

Here’s the scene. You have a major exam
in a few days and need someplace to go and
study.

Of course you can’t study in your room or
apartment, your roommate makes enough
noise to wake the dead from their eternal
sleep. Your friends are always dropping by
asking you to go out and do something, and
against your better judgement (yeah, great
right) you decide to throw caution to the wind
and go out.

I’ve got it, why don’t you go to the library?
It’s fairly quiet. (Just don’t sit on the first
floor, if you really want to get some serious
studying done, because it’s the biggest pick-
up spot on the Pitt campus.)

So here you are, you finally made it to the
library. You decide that the third or fourth

floor would do nicely for your studying pur- .

poses. You find a nice, comfy seat, sit down,
get your books out, find the pages you need
to read (if you’re like most other students,
myself included, this is probably the first time
that you have looked at the material-good
luck!), check out all the other people studying
to see if anything looks interesting and then
begin the fun process of studying.

Everything is going along great. The read-
ing is fairly easy to understand, you’re taking
notes to help you to remember what you just
read and the information is slowly seeping
into your brain.

But, all in all this scene is boring. You notice
that your eyelids are beginning to feel heavy,
and that it’s very hard to keep them up.
Thoughts of your warm, comfy bed intrude into
your thoughts, and you wish that you were
snuggled up in it (maybe with your favorite
stuffed animal-if you still sleep with one), en-
joying a great dream. Your head begins to
droop, and sleep is looming on the ever present
horizon.

You think to yourself, what would it hurt to
take a little nap to get you through this studying.
So it’s decided, you’ll take just a short nap. You
lay your head down on the table, fall asleep and
go off into dreamland. (Though, let me give you
a word of advice, don’t snore too loud-it disturbs
the other people who are also studying and
sleeping.)

Sleeping in the library is a common sight,
students just need that slight refresher to get
back on course with their studies. The next time
you’re in the library to study (I know that’s a
rare occurence) check out how many students
are asleep and keep it down, you might wake
one of them up.

Above Average

onors College

Have you ever been to the 35th ﬂoor of
the Cathedral of Learning? If you have then
you know what you have found. But if you
have never been there, let me tell you what
you will find — The University Honors Col-
lege. _

The 35th ﬂoor of the Cathedral provides
honors college students, and other students,
the opportunity to read magazines, study
and socialize with other students.

To be enrolled in the program students
must possess a 3.25 quality point average,
or if they are below this requirement special
permission from the instructor. Approxi-
mately 600 students are enrolled in the
program at this time.

The University Honors College provides
an alternative academic opportunity to mo-
tivated students. In order to acheive this goal
the Honors College offers some 30 to 40
Honors course per term. These classes are
demanding, requiring more time than a non-
honors course, but in the end the student
receives a high degree of statisfaction with
his/her work.

These courses range from basic courses to
upper level courses in a variety disciplines.

The most popular courses for freshmen
are Honors biology, chemistry and phys-
ics, and for upper-level students human-
ities courses.

It is through the Honors College that a
student can complete a Bachelor of Phi-
losophy degree in the University Honors
College. A student does so by fulfilling the
requirements of the school of which they
are enrooled in and completing a program
of study in the University Honors College,
which will culminate in an independent
piece of scholarship that is offered to a
board of faculty examiners.

The University Honors College pro-
vides special advising, which goes along
with an Honors students’ regular advising.
This allows for the Honors students’ to
have more options open to them. The
Honors College, by having the 35th ﬂoor,
in the Cathedral hopes to provide Honors
students with a means of interaction with
other Honors students.

Necessary?

equired Classes

 

CAS students in order to receive their
degrees, must fulfill certain basic require-
ments of which the University has dic-
tated.

These requirements are to be taken by
all students, so that they may have a
better rounded academic experience. The
University feels that with these require-
ments the graduating student will be able
to better grasp the world in which they
live in and further understand it.

To many these requirements are seen
not as a way to further their education,
but rather as a burden that they must
overcome.

Yet, it is these requirements which give

the total college experience. For college is '

all about new experiences and experienc-
ing new ideas and emotions. It is such that
the University wishes to provide in it’s
academic environment.

These requirements have a wide range
and differing, conflicting values. Students
are required to study foriegn cultures,
which introduce new worlds and new peo-
ple.

Cognitive thinking, such as a math

course, is required to expand the mind into
the world of abstract thinking.

Science, be it life or physical, is another
such requirement. This requirement is one
that gives the student the opportunity to
have hands on experience with the scientific
facts, theories and laws, which control the
world.

Taking an art or music class opens the
students eyes to the beauty that has been
created and surrounds us like a warm sum-
mer breeze.

Students are introduced into the world of
writing and great works of literature, when
they enroll in an English literature class, or
even fulfill the writing squenences of basic
and general writing.

They are other requirements that, in line
with the noted requirements, better the stu-
dent as a more roundly educated person. All
in all it is these classes which give the stu-
dent the essence of the total college ex-
perience. For, they have truely been awak-
ened to the many mystify worlds that make
this planet a whole and guide our very lives.

ust one more quiz
question to add to the
millions answered by
Pitt students daily. The
question of the day is
—— where else can you
read, relax and watch
T.V. besides in one of
those Crafmatic ad-
justable beds many of
you may have at
home? If your answer
was the William Pitt
Union, you are abso-

comfortable area to ei-
ther enrich their knowl-
edge by studying or in-
tensify their social lives
by socializing. (Don't

different T.V. shows.
For those who want
greater control as to

word of advice, what-
ever you do, don't get
so engrossed in a vid-
eo game that you miss
class. A small snack
shop is there stocked
with typical junk foods
that are fabled to add

get to visit the candy
wall to buy some of
those little red fishies
that we all remember
from childhood.)

If you are in the
mood for frozen yogurt

Schenley Cafe is
where you want to be.

Be sure to buy a fa-
mous combo meal con-
sisting of the sandwich
of your choice and
french fries.

From time to time,
vendors sell items such
as international crafts,
posters to contribute to
the "Student Designer
Wallpaper Line" and
credit cards, so that
students can spend
even more money. All
these sales usually
take place near the
Schenley Cafe. This is
a good time to get
great buys without
even having to leave
the campus.

The entire William

All Aboard !!

ester at Sea

A Semester at Sea aboard the S.S. Universe
is more than just another semester. This se-
mester combines the traditional undergraduate
courses and an experience of a lifetime en-
countering the oppertunities of international ex-
ploration.

One of the Semester at Sea’s program’s many
aims is to expand a student’s liberal arts cur-
riculum by experiencing world issues and prob-
lems up close. This program is also designed to
let students interact with people of different
cultures. The students can also learn about their
own culture by contrasting and comparing it to
the countries they visit.

On the average, the University of Pittsburgh
students join 500 other students from various
other colleges and universities throughout the
U.S. and foreign countries to take off on an
incredible cruise around the world. Depending
on whether students go on a fall or spring
semester determines which countries they will
visit. Some will make stops in Malaysia, Japan,
Turkey, Taiwan, and India. While on the 100
day voyage, 50 days are spent in-port visiting
countries. Once on land the students engage in
activites such as university visits, diplomatic
briefings, music performances, and ‘visits to
museums and stock exchanges. The other 50
days are spent on board the S.S. Universe
where the students attend classes that fulfill
requirements or count toward their major. Dur-
ing their free time students often go swimming,
do aerobics, play volleyball and chess, or be-

come involved with some of the clubs aboard
the ship.

The U.S. Universe is meant to be be as
much like home as possible. The students
heve the choice of living in doubles, tRlples,
or without a porthole. The “campus” in-
cludes classrooms, study lounges, a library,
and a theater. It also includes a cafeteria-style
dining room, a student union, snack bar, cam-
pus store, swimming pool, a hospital and a
computer lab.

While aboard, the average student takes no
less than 12 and no more than 15 credits. The
average class size is 20 to 30 students with
maximum student involvement. The students
are required to take a class known as CORE
or International Studies 100 which is a multi-
disciplinary course that gives students and
overview of the cultures they will be ex-
periencing. The CORE director uses the en-
tire faculty plus lecturers from the different
ports of call along the journey to discuss his or
her specific region.

Classes Already!

low-off Classes

The time is upon us, registration is about to
begin. We shoot out of the gate (through your
gate might be in North or South Oakland or
one of the housing facilities) up towards
Thackery Hall to obtain the latest installment
of the course description guide and the time
schedule. For without these two items, you
may not be able to figure out a schedule for
next term.

You take this information back to your

humble abode (or maybe not so humble de-
pending upon where you live) and beging the
painstaking process of looking through the
description guide to fing some interesting
classes to take next term. Finally, you have
found the classes that you need to take for
next semester. But, you need to take one or
two more classes to add up to 12 or more
credits so you can be classified as a full-time
student.
Hmmm, what classes to take? You do not
want to take anything that will be too hard,
your required classes already fit that bill. You
do not want anything that will take too much
of your time, or possibly even worse, pull
down your QPA (your parents would have a
bird if it fell any lower).

I have got it! How about one of those
classes that the upper classes usually refer to
as blow-off classes. One of those would surely
help the QPA, wouldn’t it? It would not
require much time (that is surely a bonus, it

leaves more free time to do whatever. Maybe an
extra party and there are some additional study
hours for those harder classes).

But, what really is a blow-off class? Generally,
it is one that has no recitations (or just one a
week, that is easily acceptable), usually with just
one or two exams, with a final given that is
multiple choice (or multiple guess in some
cases), and lectures that are straight from the
text (which means you do not have t go to class,
just read the text).

Relatively speaking here are some, in my
opinion, a sampling of blow-off classes that Pitt
has to offer. Physics 81 (I think that is the
number) Ideas of Modern Physics. The professor
teaches directly from the book with in-class
demonstrations, and exams that are multiple
choice and open book. Also, and extra bonus is
that there is no recitation. Physical Education
classes are easy, too. They do not require any
mind power (which is good if you are burnt out
from your other classes) just physical strength.
This is one reason why the University only
permits two credits of physical education to
count towards graduation.

Q.P.A.: 1.5

ailing Out

Did you ever imagine yourself
failing out of college? Or even
being on academic probation?

Probably not, but suprisinlgly
many students at Pitt face t is
dreadful situation.

There are many common ex-
cuses when it all boils down to
it. Bad professors, roommates
who would never allow you to
study, a course that never had
your interest to begin with, are
just a few excuses many stu-
dents blame their problem on.

To be placed on academic pro-
bation a student's QPA must fall
below the required 2.00. Re-
cently, CAS put a new probation
policy into play. Students’
QPA’s are reviewed only once a
year, instead of once a semester.
This will surely cut down on a
lot of students frustrations. If a

student falls below the 2.00
QPA requirement, they are
placed on probation for the next
academic year. They remain on
academic probation til the fol-
lowing year.

_ If you fail to progress academ-
ically during your year’s proba-
tion, you will be suspended or
dismissed from CAS.

If a student happens to be
placed on academic probation,
they will not be permitted to en-
roll in courses at other univer-
sities. In the long run, it is best
to try to avoid failing out now,
instead of dealing with it when
the time comes.

Ranger Platoon, of course.

The Ranger Platoon consists of 30 mem-
bers ranging from freshmen to seniors. The
Ranger Platoon is not what some individuals
would stereotypically think, for it is com-
prised of both male and female represent-
atives. The program is highly competitive, for
the Rangers are constantly striving for high
QPA’s and PT (physical training) scores. For
with these high QPA’s and PT scores, the
Rangers may then proceed on to advanced
camp, where they can achieve their ultimate
goal of receiving a regular commission in the
army.

ROTC classes teach critical leadership and
management skills. Skills that make the stu-
dent better today and a more competitive job
applicant in the future. In addition to the
regular ROTC classes and PT in the morning,
the Ranger Platoon also trains every weekend

for a special event —- the Ranger Challenge.
Taking place on November 1, 2 and 3, the
Ranger Challenge saw a Pitt Ranger Squad take
eighth place overall. The Rangers competed
against squads representing Pennsylvania uni-
versities. They competed in areas, such as firing
and assembling M-16s, PT tests, building one
rope bridges and land navigation and grenade
throwing.

The Ranger Platoon is for those individuals,

who want to go above and beyond regular
ROTC training especially in their first and sec-
ond years. Though being a Ranger is not re-
quired, those who enter the program feel as
though they learn more than regular ROTC
students. In addition to their regular activities,
the Rangers are responsible for 21 gun salutes
at funerals.
Both the Army and the Airforce programs have
an annual Military Ball and Dining in Ceremony.
Both events are formal and feature a guest
speaker, usually a general. To supplement the
cost of these events, both programs participate
in fundraisers such as hoagie sales on the
groundﬂoor in the Cathedral.

Stress! Even that word can’t sum up what
finals are all about. Let me tell you it’s more,
much much more than just stress, stress and
more stress. Though it does play a part during
Finals Week.

Here’s the scene. Things are going great so
far, the semester is looking good. Your grades
are in good shape. You’re handling it, you only
have one or two (maybe three or four-if you
lucked out) exams a month. No problem right?
It’s easy to catch up on the material you’re
behind in to be ready for the next exam. You
have the time to go out and do things with your
many friends. It’s definitely smooth sailing.

Then wham, it’s the end of the term. Things
are drawing to a close, and the big moment has
arrived-Finals Week(what a thrill). It starts to
heat up in the old proverbial kitchen. Stress
starts to flow like blood around the university.
Students start to hibernate in their rooms clois-
tered with their numerous textbooks. The com-
puter labs fill to bursting with students trying to
complete that final paper or computer project on
time.

Finals Week for some is to be regarded as hell
week. What do I mean by hell week? Well, one
of pulling all-nighters trying to cram four months
of material into your brain in order to have a

Cramming!

hope of passing the final. While for others it is
the first time that they have looked at the
material, trying to catch up on the readings
they are behind in and facing the task of
digesting it and making some sense of it.
How do students survive finals week? Well as
I mentioned above many pull all-nighters. This
is where coffee or any source of caffiene
comes in handy. Staying awake is the hard
part but drinking a lot of caffiene does help.
Many students head off to the library, which is
open til 2 am, or go up to Scaife Hall, which is
open all night, to study. Just stop in at these
places during Finals week, and you’ll see a
large number of students studying their brains
out. During finals Pitt appears to take on a
haunted quality with students staying in to
study to the wee hours of the morn, only
venturing outside when they have a final to
take.

Don’t worry though you’ll survive. Take it
from a pro you’ll do just fine. And think of it
this way after you’re all done you can sit back
and relax and think of how you’ll spend break
with you friends and family. Hey! Cheer up
finals aren’t that bad and they’re finally over
(Yeah)!
