DEDICATION

To you, Iohn Gabbert Bowman, we dedicate our Owl. In the many
offices of importance which you have held, Secretary of the Carnegie
Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching, Director of the American
College of Surgeons, President of the State University of Iowa, and now
Chancellor of the University of Pittsburgh, you have accomplished much
—even more than the world knows. But it is not for the tangible gains
you have brought these institutions that we respect you; rather it is for the
personality you have used in their service. For your way of thinking, for
your faith in the people you live among, for your belief that the best is
always possible, we honor you. You have understood our youth with its
strength and its confusion and, understanding, you have shown us the
purposes for which we should use our strength. In this quick-changing

world, where people see often only the surfaces, you would have us find"

the obscure but significant possibilities within us. Because we know that
you have done these things for us, you are to us more than a great executive
—a man. To you, sir, then, we dedicate our Owl.

 

Slutlenl Facully

Associalion

The Student Faculty Association was
formed in the spring of 1934 when a
general campus referendum approved
the adoption of the newly formed by-
laws to supplant the previous Student
Council organization. The governing
body of the Association which is known
as the University Assembly, is composed
of forty members, thirty students and
ten faculty members. The executive
committee, composed of the Chancellor,
the Deans of Men and Women, and ﬁve
student members is the centralizing
force in the government of the Associ-
ation.

During this, its first year on the camp-
us, the Student Faculty Association has
been concerned with the development of
a strong and eﬂicient working organi-
zation to take care of the numerous ad-
ministrative duties of student self—gov-
ernment, and with the formulation of a
program to provide for the cultural, so-
cial, and intellectual interests of stu-
dents.

The Assembly is charged with the
enforcement of rules and regulations
governing undergraduate social affairs,
the admission of new organizations, the
regulation of existing organizations and
of general campus activities.

The Association is composed of all
students registered in the College, the
Schools of Business Administration,
Dentistry, Education, Engineering, and
Mines, and their respective faculty
members. The purpose of the Associa-
tion as expressed in the by laws is, “To
provide additional ways by which
faculty and students may work together
on common problems and through these

96

LEONARD MARKS, Prexident

joint activities enrich further the col-
lective life as well as the life of the
individual at the University."

In addition to this work, the Associ-
ation has been active in bringing promi-
nent speakers to the campus to address
the student body on significant phases
of current life. The Association experi-
mented with a University Newsreel
theatre to display outstanding news
reels, travelogues, and educational
features.

For the benefit of those students who
are interested in athletics but who are
unable to find places on school teams,
the Association has introduced and de-
veloped a program of intra—mural ath-
letic competition.

During the year a study has been made
by a committee for the re—institution of
customs for Freshmen. The committee
has evolved a plan to inaugurate cus-
toms on an entirely new basis with no
element of hazing or ridicule.

The Young Women's Christian Association unites University women who ﬁnd in
the Christian ideal a challenge to live a full and creative life. In keeping with its
purpose, the Association has established a program emphasizing the relationship of
social, political, and economic factors to present-day religion. The organization
conducts discussions on student problems, campus standards and student-faculty
relationships. For a number of years it has sponsored the Inquiry Forum; to it the
Y. W. C. A. has brought many prominent speakers to aid in the discussion of social
issues. The group conducts Human Relation Trips through Pittsburgh, to investigate
social agencies, settlement houses, factories, and slum districts.

The purpose of the College Association is “to
establish greater unity of spirit and action in
the college, to advance social interests, and to
promote the general welfare of the students and
of the University, and to create a more friendly
relationship between the faculty and the stu-
dents.” One of the major functions of the organi-
zation is to maintain a loan fund for students in
the College. Money for this fund is gained by
holding a series of four dances a year, one formal
and one informal each semester. In giving these

dances the Association endeavors to carry out
its Social side by presenting reasonably priced
dances, as well as using the money for worthy
purposes. The Association also sponsors two
assemblies a year. During the first semester an
assembly was held at which Dr. Spencer, the
new clean, was introduced. In carrying out its
purposes the College Association has brought
together all the Students of the college into one
compact group.

W. A. A., with the two-fold purpose of foster-
ing clean sportsmanship and promoting higher
physical eﬂiciency, sponsors an athletic program
which includes sixteen sports arranged for the
fall, winter, and spring seasons. Once a month
members of the association spend a week-end at
Camp KOn«O-Kwee. During Spring Festival week
the group stages a dance-drama at the stadium.
W. A. A. claims the credit for sponsoring two

social events which year after year make a wide
appeal to University women. To the annual
Co—Ed Prom, held this year in the Twentieth
Century Club, Freshmen women, dressed in
summer party dresses, were escorted by upper-
class women dressed in tuxes and tails. The
second major social event sponsored by the
group is the W. A. A. cabaret.

The Downtown Students Association was or-
ganized in 1926 for the purpose of furthering the
interest of the students in the social activities
of the evening school. The present group is the
outgrowth of the Evening School Association,
an organization which, by sponsoring meetings
and dinners at different times in the school year,

105

PATRICK  HYLAND

helped to foster the genuine university spirit
which now exists. In 1920 a fee of ﬁve dollars
was added to the tuition of each student; thus
membership in the organization was automatic-
cally insured. Today the Association sponsors
numerous social occasions at appropriate times
throughout the school year.

The record of the Pitt Doumtou/net is a
record of change and adaptability to
new conditions. When the first issue,
published as the Pitt Rivety, appeared in
September, 1927, it deﬁnitely ﬁlled a
need for a coordinating unit in the
Downtown Division. The make—up of
the magazine varied little in the ﬁrst
two years. In December, 1929, however,
it was felt advisable to launch the
magazine under a new name, the Pitt

Doumtowner, and to institute radical

107

changes in its form. Still the changes
did not sufficiently stimulate circula-
tion; on October 13, 1930 the first
number in the present style was dis-
tributed gratis to downtown students.
Today, working in close coordination
with the Downtown Student’s Associa-
tion, the paper serves as an exchange for
fraternity news, student activities, fac-
ulty and administration announcements,
and general news of the Downtown
Division.

THE PITT NEWS

 

JOHN Tnnav, Editor

The Pitt Neu/.r, written and
edited by undergraduate students
of the University, appears each
Monday, Wednesday, and Friday
morning of the regular school
year. The Pitt Neu/.r, in Septem-
ber, made its debut as a tri—weekly,
having added one issue a week for the
past two years.

More than ﬁfty people devote a major
part of their time spent in extra—curricu-
lar activities to work on The Neu/.r.
Approximately three—fourths of that
number are engaged in gathering and
writing the news, editing and preparing
it for publication. The remainder con-
stitute the business staff which takes
care of advertising, circulation, audit-
ing, and secretarial work.

The Pitt News serves as a means of
communication for each curricular and
eXtra—curricular division on campus as

 

108

ELLIS TUMPSON, Bminerr Manager

well as for the afculty and the
administration. Semi—annually,
in the fall and in the spring, The
Nezw sponsors a fashion show
and tea dance which is open to
the student body and the faculty
free of cost. Extras are issued at the
annual basketball and football clinics
sponsored by the athletic department of
the University, and at the conclusion of
the activities tap—day exercises during
Spring Festival week. On occasions
throughout the year, it appears as a
functional publication: at mid—year
graduation, alumni conventions, and
special sports events.

Through an arrangement with the
University, The Pitt New; is distributed
free to central points on the campus
from where students, faculty, and em-
ployees of the University may obtain
their copies.

THE OWL

 

CHARLES FOREMAN, Editor

THE OWL is the official year
book of the University of Pitts-
burgh. Though a senior project,
it includes on its working staff
representatives from every
school, class, and department.
Its aim is to present for instant and
joyous recall the happenings of four
years of college life. It records all
campus events—social, scholastic, and
athletic. On the pages of the OWL ap-
pear individual photographs of gradu-
ating seniors, each photograph
accompanied by a list of activities
suggesting the work and interests of the
senior beyond his scheduled hours.
Photographs also picture in groups not
only activities of seniors, but also of
juniors, sophomores, and freshmen.
Copper and monotyped lead make
permanent incidents of clubs and or-
ganizations, of dances and fraternities.
The word—descriptions of activities

 

110

JULES GREEN, Burinerx Manager

attempt to present in perspective
the individuals and groups
which have set the character of
the work of the school year.
Sketches of administrators are
for some of the readers an intro-
duction to men who are determining
current policies of the University and to
others a reminder of conferences with
distinguished advisors.

THE OWL exists primarily for the
seniors. Their last few days on the
campus and their many years as alumni
of the University are brightened by
memories of undergraduate life as it
appears in the pages of the year book.
For them the OWL attempts not only to
recall memories of speciﬁc organiza-
tions, speciﬁc events; it strives so to
weld them together as to recapture the
spirit of the University, present in each
of its activities.

THE PITT PANTHER

 

CHARLES RUCH, Editor

Literary libel it would be to
present a serious write—up of the
Panther. Rather than burden the
humorous publication with un-
due solemnity and dignity, the
OWL presents an article by the
Panther Editor—in—Chief. From him you
may learn how the Panther appears to
the Panther.

folk who enjoy being campus folk add
a paper-backed magazine to the day's
quota of text books they carry in their
arms. That magazine is the Pitt Panther,
monthly humorous publication of the
University.

Approximately ﬁfty students aid in
putting out this mirthful monthly and
virtually all of them remain sane at the
end of the year. The columns of the
book are filled with light and frivolous
treatments of anything from a discus-
sion of a Saturday night date to a

history of ski-jumping. Equally
important to the value of the
pages are the cartoon effects,
most of which deal in a satiric
manner with campus events or
institutions.

Jokes of varied vintage and short
pieces and poetry fill up the rest of the
columns devoted to feature material.
Other sections include the inevitable
dirt column, fashion notes and hints,
and an editorial broadside, “From an
Eighth Floor Window."

Of particular note Was the Christmas
issue of the Panther, featuring a cover
which portrayed caricatures of adminis-
tration oﬂicials as they were garbed in
children's clothes and playing beneath
a Christmas tree.

The Panther seeks to provide an outlet
for all witticisms, humorous and unique,
and attractive feature material. Its
sworn slogan is: “Show the boys and
girls a good time.”

The Men's Debating Association oﬁers students interested in
political, economic, and social questions the opportunity not only to
organize their thinking but to develop ability in effective public
speaking. Each year the association selects two or three current
controversial topics. Squad members investigate different phases of
these problems and prepare expositions of them. Teams then engage
in an extensive program of debates before leagues of women voters,
business men's clubs, and other local organizations; they make a series
of intercollegiate forensic tours through the South, East, and Middle-
West. The ideal of the association is not to win decisions; it is rather
to present clearly and persuasively the personal convictions of the
debaters.

Through extension and intercollegiate debates, participation in the
annual conference of Delta Sigma Rho, national honorary forensic
fraternity, and monthly informal discussion meetings, the Women’s
Debating Association provides adequate training for those students
interested in learning to speak with some force and ability on topics
of economic, social, and political import. Last year members of the
Association presented ﬁfteen debates before parent—teacher organiza-
tions and similar groups on questions of social import which confront
the United States today. In the second annual Delta Sigma Rho
conference held here on March 29 and 30, the women’s debating teams
of the University were awarded second place in the formal debates on
munitions.

Social

and musical and

dramatic activities are im-

mediately appealing to all.

When minds wander away from the

words of a lecturing professor, they turn

naturally toward activities which in organi-

zation and enjoyment are more distantly removed

from the actualities of University classrooms of Pitts-

burgh streets. Indeed, however stimulating may be

classrooms and streets, mind and body leaps eagerly to

activities which, in their naturalness, seem dissociated

from intellectual effort. Not that this dissociation is neces-

sarily present. But the enjoyment of social affairs, of music, of

dramatics, different in method as it is from the stimulation of

lectures or reading, is universal. And it is this universal appeal

which contributes, in large part, to the unification of the University.

Publications may not appeal to some, honorary organizations may

not appeal to others, but music, drama, social affairs touch almost

everyone. They sweep boredom from the mind and leave it free to

chase after self-expression . . . or to dream of the next dance. Three

times yearly the Pitt Players present standard plays of a nature stimula-

ting and enjoyable to University audiences. The Players offer to mem-

bers experience in all phases of dramatic work. For 28 years Cap and

Gown has presented each spring a highly successful musical show; the

production is an important Pittsburgh social event. Periodically the musi-

cal groups give performances to heighten the music appreciation of

students and faculty. Dances are held in the most attractive Pittsburgh

ballrooms; often nationally-known orchestras are engaged. Dances, dram-

atic and music activities offer further opportunity for the realization of the
essential unity of the University.

With a roll of drums one hundred
twenty blue and gold uniformed
bandsmen quickstep through the
ﬁeld tunnel and spread into forma-
tion behind the strutting drum ma-
jor and the cavorting panther.
There is a burst of cheering and ap-
plause; the Pitt band has scored
again!

The history of this prominent
group began in 1911 when a group
of eight students, using instruments
borrowed from Becker's Music
Store, made its first appearance on
October 14 at the Pitt—Ohio Nor-
thern football game. In 1917 the
band secured its present director,
Professor M. S. Rocereto. The in-
tricate marching formations are
planned and directed by Lieutenant
Tredennick.

The activities of the band are not
limited to campus functions. Last
fall the band played at the Baptist
Church reception, at the Southern
California pep assembly, at the
Alumni Smoker, at the Variety
Club’s Milk Fund program. It
broadcasted twice over local radio
stations. The band furnished stir-
ring music for the football games in
the stadium; more than that, it
followed the team for three games
away from Pittsburgh. The only
scheduled trip was the one to West
Virginia, but later, as a reward for
excellent performance, the Navy
trip was added. The band, more-
over, wishing to play at the West-
minster game, furnished their own
transportation.

In llle Soup

With all the coyness which can
be learned in six weeks of rehearsal,
and all the grace which can be
attained on three inches of heel,
the members of the Cap and Gown
Club produced their annual pro-
duction “In the Soup. ” Once again
the boys donned silken things and
laces and set out to prove to the
world at large that pulchritude is
not conﬁned to the fair sex. Anoth-
er bit of evidence was added to
strengthen the contention that
Helen of Troy didn't do so much.
However, there is a good bit more
to a Cap and Gown production
than dancing and singing before an
audience. Weeks of intensive re—’
hearsal are required before the
show is ready to be placed before
the public. The would-be chorines
soon realize that the life of the
theatres is not all glamour. Too
much credit cannot be given to the
patient and tireless directors, Theo-
dore Viehman and Eugene Kelly.
Viehman was responsible for the
staging of the production as well as
the directing of the cast, while
Kelly directed all the dancing. The
smoothness of the production as a
whole is testimony of the friendly
spirit of cooperation which char-
acterized their combined direction.

In the chasms between dark immense buildings, Pittsburgh life is teeming,
bustling, crowding, shoving. The quick tempo of its life is shot with
screeches, whistles, shrieks, impacts. At first, Pittsburgh noise and activity
swirls around your consciousness, quickening the nerves, opening the eyes.
Gulp back your enthusiasm; reorient your nerves; squint at Pittsburgh as an
artist squints at a landscape. Here is the real Pittsburgh with its long lines
of people, heads bowed, emotionless, ploddingly tramping together the same
steps they tramped yesterday, the same steps they will tramp tomorrow.
The reason for tramping? They know it not; they tramp because they have
always tramped, because their fathers tramped, because everyone tramps.
Underfoot there is a continual monotonous thump and shuffle. Here and
there, a man, smiling and gesticulating in protest against an enervating spirit,
darts forward around a group of people, his shoes scraping briskly like sharp
skates. His is a protest born of despair. With a thump and shuffle the
whole of Pittsburgh tramps, without reason or hope, from habit alone.
What of it? Did we not last year produce an infinite number of tons of
pig iron?

PITT PLAYERS

 

of
dramatic history, this year, the program of Pitt

Covering approximately eighty years

Players has included as its main productions a
burlesque melodrama of 1850, Far/aim, a German
tragedy, Magda, and a gay modern comedy,

presented in the auditorium of the Y. M.-
Y. W. H. A., Bellefield Avenue, the organization
sponsored two series of one-act plays, numbering

In addition to the major plays

twenty-ﬁve in all. The one-acts were entirely
student produced; the casting, selecting, and
directing being done by members of the Play
Production class of Carl B. Cass, director of the
Players. Although all one-acts were first pro-
duced on the stage of the Fanny Edel Falk
Elementary School, many of the plays had repeat

performances outside the school.

Banquet, Charter Day, alumni meetings, and
other campus functions.

From leading lady to poster painter, the
Players’ organization offers students practical
experience in all forms of dramatic production
and management. Although each presented play
is the result of cooperation of the entire organ-
ization, the wide field of play production neces-
sitates dividing the group into three separate
staffs: acting, business, and technical. To insure
more eﬂicient working, each division maintains
its own particular tryout requirements and stu-
dent oﬂicers.

A desk in Room 801 Cathedral is the head-

126

quarters for the business staff of the Players. The
staff arranges ticket sale campaigns, printing of
tickets and programs, and both on and off-
campus publicity for major productions. Notices
are sent to home towns of all those who partici-
pate in such productions. Pen sketches of
prominent cast members displayed on University
bulletin boards before each play were presented
as an innovation in advertising this year as were
the action portraits of the cast by the University
Photographer, Luke Swank. All poster work is
done in the poster shop which is located on the
second ﬂoor of the Y. M. C. A. hut.

Twice a semester, try-outs, consisting of
dramatic readings and pantomines, are held for
applicants to the acting staff. After preliminary
try-outs members are eligible for casting in
major plays and one-acts. Members of all staffs
are united in the social group of the Players,
which numbers two hundred and fifty-one
students this year. To become an active member
of this group necessitates the participation in a
play or in the business of technical activities
connected with a production. The social or-
ganization sponsors a tea dance each year, a
dinner after each production, various general
meetings, and a spring banquet at which time
new officers are elected for the following year.
Points are given for service in the organization,
and when eight points have accrued the member
is eligible, for a gold key. Outstanding work in
the Players is recognized by membership in Theta
Alpha Phi, the honorary dramatic fraternity.

From the situation of an audience
a stage set looks remarkably natur-
al; its creation appears to have
involved no particular difficulties.
But, backstage, a variety of flat-
props, a complicated series of ropes,
batteries of lights placed at differ-
ent points of advantage, carefully
planned scenery and decorations
suggest the effort which has gone
into the making of a background
suitable and effective for the action
of the play. During this school
year the hard work of the technical
staff of Pitt Players has been re-
sponsible for the creation of scenery
and properties which have not only
contributed but added to the suc-
cess of the three productions.

The technical staff has its own
workshop in the second ﬂoor of the
University garage across from the
stadium. For Weeks before the
production of plays it is alive with
paint—scraping, carpentry, ﬂat-
painting, electrical work. The tech-
nical staff offers to its members a
type of activity different from the
routine of class—work and organiza-
tions. At the technical shop stress
is laid upon knowledge of various
manual techniques and upon ability
to use those techniques in such a
way as to create stage settings of
genuine merit.

The staff furnishes equipment for
plays other than its Own; it handles
lights for University dances. Its
members prepare the posters an-
nouncing coming Pitt Players
events.

Cheers and jeers and pennies and
peanuts made November 14 a hila-
rious nigl1t in Pitt Player's history
when Fez;/non,‘ or Life in New York,
a melodrama of 1850 written by
Anna Cora Mowatt was presented
by a cast of thirteen as the ﬁrst
major production of the year.

The play was done in the manner
of the Broadway theatre of the
ﬁfties; the gestures were ﬂittery,
the speeches were ﬂowing, the
make—up was heavy, and the audi-
ence responded with tears and cab-
bages. A wing type scenery set
with furniture and props painted
ﬂat on the wall heightened the
effect.

A satire on society, Fez;/nan sets
its action in the mansion of one
Mrs. Tiﬂany, a leader of the New
York “eelight." An intrigue be-
tween a French count and a lady’s
maid, a romance between the
Tiffany governess and an army
oﬁcicer, the blunderings of Farmer
Trueman, new to city ways, and
the sinister plotting of the cur,
Snobson, made for lively action.
The ﬁfth and final act found virtue
triumphant and the cast waving
American ﬂags and singing the joys
of the Independent Femner. Entre-
acts of clog dances, quartette num-
bers, songs, and skits provided
entertainment during scenery
shifts.

By popular request, Fm/9z'on was
played again in the YW—YMHA
auditorium, Belleﬁeld avenue, on
November 27, the first repeat per-
formance in the organization his-
tory.

From the middle of the nine-
teenth century in America, the
Players Went to the turn of the
century in Germany and chose
Hermann Sudermann’s four act
tragedy, Magda which was one of
the most talked about plays of its
time, being played simultaneously,
in rival companies, by the greatest
actresses of the day, Duse and
Bernhardt. Magda was produced
on February 20 in the YW—YMHA
auditorium, Bellefield avenue. It
is a dramatic study of the age—old
conﬂict of provincialism and world-
liness and oﬂiered the group oppor-
tunity for the most difficult char-
acter studies of the year.

A small German town in the late
nineteenth century is the back-
ground for Zvfagda, the action tak-
ing place in the household of a
retired German oﬂicer. To this
family living in the tradition of
patriarchal supremacy, returns
Magda, a headstrong daughter
driven from home years before be-
cause of a quarrel with her father.
Magda has become a famous singer
during her years of exile and her
return home changes the lives of
the entire family. The play reaches
a tragic climax in a final struggle
between daughter and tyrannic
father, a struggle revealing the
ever—conﬂicting ideals of youth and
paternal authority.

Magda Was given a pre—campus
performance to an invitation audi-
ence at the Irene Kaufmann Settle-
ment auditorium on the Sunday
preceding the campus showing.

The Players’ spring show intro-
duced two innovations; for the first
time in the history of the organiza-
tion a show was presented on two
consecutive evenings, and a produc-
tion was “taken on the road" for
an out-of—the—city performance.

“March Hares” by Harry Wag-
staff Gribble, a modern sophisti-
cated comedy, was the ﬁnal show
of the year. Subtitled “The Tem-
peramentalists," the comedy dealt
lightly with two young elecution-
ists, Geoﬁrey Wareham and Janet
Rodney; eccentric and in love. A
break comes in the Rodney house-
hold when Janet brings home
Claudia Kitts, a blonde coquette
whom Janet claims as an “affini-
ty.” A placid young gentleman,
one Edgar Fuller; a temperamental
butler, Oliver; an amorous maid,
Ethel; and a snifﬂing cook complete
the household. It is this menage
that the calm and charming Mrs.
Rodney attempts to keep peace and
stability, two qualities noticeably
missing among the temperamental-
ists.

With three women in the house-
hold in love with the same man, a
husband turning up at an unexpect-
ed moment, and Claudia Kitts
reciting passionate poetry at un-
appropriate situations, the story of
a week—end in the Rodney family
provided an entertaining evening.

“March Hares" made its campus
performance on Wednesday and
Thursday evenings, April 10 and
11, in the auditorium of the Y. M.-
W. H. A., Belleﬁeld Avenue. Di-
rectly after the ﬁnal show the
scenery was packed and shipped,
and the cast “took to the road" to
give a production on Friday night
in Sharon, Pa.

Bernard Shaw, in his play ‘Heartbreak House," described the insane,
irresponsible self-satisfaction of war-time English society. England, he
implied, was fast breaking to pieces. Through his character Captain
Shotover he declared that knowledge of navigation is essential to the
avoidance of shipwreck of English institutions. The institutions of the
United States, likewise, must be steered away from the rocks and must be
headed “towards God's open sea." The administrators, the trustees, the
faculty, the members of the Alumni Council are in large part the navigators
of the University of Pittsburgh. The glory is theirs if rocks are avoided; the
responsibility is inevitably theirs if shoals are struck. Their responsibility
is not to their own ship alone, since they must utilize their knowledge to
make effective the teaching of navigation to others. This knowledge
extends to many spheres. It embraces decisions on campus policy, on
scholarship, on methods of instruction, on construction of buildings; it
reaches out into the arena in which the struggles of ideas and of men are
decided. Today, the navigators in the United States are perhaps not so
irresponsible as the navigators of the English war-time society. They
recognize the need for careful navigation; they are in doubt only as to the
proper theory of charting and the proper application of the rules. And so,
upon the navigators of a university a double duty falls. The responsibility
is great; likewise the necessity. For upon the correct charting of the
training-ship, the charting of other ships depends.

The Cathedral of Learning, still in process of construction, houses the mad
swirl of magazines and papers preparing for print and calmer interviews
with deans and advisors. Too new, perhaps, and too incomplete, it is, to
have developed an atmosphere either of gaiety or oppression. Too impres-
sive are the huge unclothed pillars of the first floor, too frank the incom-
plete construction of upper floors to invite false laughter. Too tall are the
pillars, too actual the techniques of building to be oppressive. Today, the
Cathedral is a sky-scraper, business-like and efficient. W7 e treat it in a matter-
of-fact way . . . The Cathedral not only houses activities, offices, and class-
rooms; it presents opportunities. Watching the construction, we catch
glimpses of the techniques and the men upon whom our civilization rests. We
watch plasterers slinging mortar, or plumbers laying pipe, or stone-workers
placing huge bulks of limestone. Their activities bring a feeling of reality
to the Cathedral. Perhaps future students would benefit if the Cathedral
were to remain permanently as it is—in process of construction.

Any university which draws a large number of its students from the
city in which it is located is faced with the problem of satisfactorily intro-
ducing those students to the life of the institution and of integrating them
with it. The University of Pittsburgh has a double problem, since it has
no dormitories for out of town students. And so the fraternities not only
bring men and women into the main stream of University activity, they also
offer to the student whose home is not in Pittsburgh a place to live which
has not the impersonal atmosphere of a boarding house. The fraternities
are centers of University social functions; they offer assistance to students
who are interested in activities and help them to secure places in fields in
which they have talent and interest. They bring to individuals the advan-
tages of a companionship which might otherwise be lost. In a word, they
draw the University together by playing a part in the introduction of the
students to each other. The professional fraternities offer contacts not only
for the exchange of ideas concerning the field in which all members have
concentrated their interest, but also for professional contacts which are of
great value in post-university life. The honorary fraternities bring together
those students who for talent and effort are outstanding in different fields.
The opportunities which they give to men and women for the development
of intellectual activity bring results which not only help the student but
also bring credit to the University and useful activity to the world into
which the student graduates.

The history of Panhellenic Council at
the University of Pittsburgh may well
be told in terms of the signiﬁcant
achievements which have made it one
of the most distinctive organizations of
its type. Most important is the well-
coordinated deferred rushing system
which has created a more sane attitude

toward rushing. Another distinguish-
ing feature is the policy of electing
officers rather than the system of rota-
tion. A third achievement is the exten-
sive social program which brings
together women of all fraternity groups
in a way that tends to establish a feeling
of unity in a common purpose.

Because

the University of

Pittsburgh is an urban

institution the women's frater-

nities on its campus are unique. The

fourteen women's groups are not only

sanctioned by the University, they are fostered

and encouraged. The University aids the frater-

nities in settling their problems; it is ever willing to

advise. On this campus, fraternities do not serve as

mere housing units, since their membership is composed

largely of girls residing at home. Nevertheless, it is believed

that fraternities do have a place in an institution the size of the

University because they bring girls together in small, intimate

groups. They are social units which give invaluable training to

the individual girl. One of their fundamental purposes is to enrich

and broaden the friendships of those who are chosen to membership.

But that they do not emphasize the social to the exclusion of the
academic and cultural, is evidenced by the high general scholastic
average which they maintain. The scholastic average of the fourteen
groups ranges between 1.5 and 2.0. A number of the groups have
Sunday evening gatherings which they devote to the discussion of cultural
subjects. . . . The groups encourage participation in University activities,
not purely for the sake of group representation, but rather because they
realize the benefits to be derived from such participation. All the groups
have large, loyal alumnae chapters; it is a well-known fact that the fraternity
serves as a valuable link between students and graduates. There is a strong
interfraternal spirit on the campus, fostered by Panhellenic. This spirit is
shown by the enthusiastic support which the fraternities give to all

‘A _ Panhellenic projects.

WOMEIVS SOCIAL FRATERNITIES

 

On February 15, 1920,
Sorosis, a group which was
organized on the University
of Pittsburgh campus in the
year 1916, affiliated with
Alpha Delta Pi, women's
national social fraternity,
and became Alpha Iota
chapter. The national or-
ganization was founded at
Wesleyan Female College in
Macon, Georgia. The nati-
onal group is growing
rapidly; at present there are
chapters in schools through-
out the United States and
Canada. The colors of the
fraternity are blue and
white; the ﬂower is the
purple violet. Alpha Delta
Pi aims not only to establish
sincere friendship during
college years but also to
continue group interest in
later life. The local chapter,
Alpha Iota, of Alpha Delta
Pi, is located in the Dith—
ridge Apartments.

Alpha Epsilon Phi, found-
ed at Barnard College, Oc-
tober 24, 1909, was the first
Greek—letter fraternity for
Jewish women in this coun-
try. There are, today, twen-
ty-nine active chapters
throughout the country.
The local group was in-
stalled as Nu chapter of
Alpha Epsilon Phi at the
University on May 5, 1920.
The national project is a
travelling library which
was presented to the Ar-
kansas Free Library Service
Bureau for distribution in
the rural districts of Ar-
kansas. l934—35 marks the
first time that the scholar-
ship fund, originated by Nu
chapter last year, has been
put to use. This scholarship
consists of one hundred and
ﬁfty dollars; it is presented
each year to a student in the
University.

 

 

The Eta chapter of Beta
Phi Alpha, an outgrowth of
a local fraternity, Theta
Gamma Phi, which joined
the national group in 1924,
has distinguished itself on
the campus for high quality
Of scholarship. The fraterni-
ty has won the Panhellenic
Scholarship Cup for the
years 1932-33 and 1933-34.
Alpha chapter, the first
women's fraternity on the
Paciﬁc coast, was founded
May 8, 1909, at the Uni-
versity of California. Thirty
chapters are now included
within the national group.
Beta Phi Alpha's motto is
"Scientia,Virtus,Amicitia."
The fraternity Colors are
green and gold; the ﬂower is
the yellow tea rose. Eta
chapter also has in its pos-
session the scholarship
placque of the national or-
ganization; for the year
1933434, it won the national
fraternity’s program cup.

Chi Omega was founded
at the University of Arkan-
sas, April 5, 1895, by Jobelle
Holcombe, Jean Vincenthel-
ler, Alice Simmons, and Ina
Mae Boles. The charter
members chose as their ﬂow-
er the white carnation, and,
as their colors, cardinal and
straw. T/9e Elmizu is the
official publication. Chi
Omega was the ﬁrst Greek
Letter Society south of the
Mason-Dixon line. Since its
beginning, many chapters
have been added to the
national organization.
Today there are eighty—eight
groups. Alpha Gamma Omi-
cron, a local sorority at the
University of Pittsburgh,
admitted to Pan—Hellenic
council in 1917, became Phi
Beta chapter of Chi Omega,
December 6, 1919. In its
forty years of service, Chi
Omega has been a society of
college women devoted to
close friendship and pro-
gress.

The Delta Zeta fraternity
was founded at Miami Uni-
versity, Oxford, Ohio, Oc-
tober 24, 1902. In 1915 the
national organization
selected a group of Pitt
women to form a local fra-
ternity which joined the
national group January 21,
1916, to become Omicron
chapter. There are f1fty—six
chapters in the national or-
ganization. The colors are
Vieux green and Kilarney
rose. The national publica-
tion is T/oe Lamp, whose
function it is to bind to-
gether the different chapters
through information rela-
tive to nation—wide fraterni-
ty activities. The local
chapter cooperates with the
national fraternity in foster-
ing ideals of scholarship and
companionship. Omicron
chapter acts together with
other chapters of Delta Zeta
in supporting an elementary
and secondary school, hos-
pital, and city welfare cen-
ter at Vest, Kentucky.

 

 

Kappa Alpha Theta,
founded in 1869, was the
first Greek-letter fraternity
among women. Bettie
Locke, a student at Depauw
University at Greencastle,
Indiana, refused to accept a
Phi Gamma Delta pin unless
she could be initiated into
the organization. To atone
for its inability to fulﬁll the
request, Phi Gamma Delta
helped Miss Locke to found
an organization of her own.
Since that time the fraterni-
ty has grown in size; now
there are sixty-four chapters.
The Pittsburgh chapter, the
ﬁrst national women's fra-
ternity to be established on
the University campus, was
installed in 1915. The pur-
pose of the fraternity is
three-fold; it aims at excel-
lence in social life, scholar-
ship, and activities. The
chapter house is located at
200 Belleﬁeld Avenue.

Kappa Kappa Gamma
was founded at Monmouth
College, Monmouth, Illi-
nois, October 13, 1870. The
fraternity at present includes
seventy Chapters through-
out the United States and
Canada. Gamma Epsilon
chapter of Kappa Kappa
Gamma was established at
the University of Pittsburgh
on February 21, 1919, when
a national charter was
granted to the members of
E. R. O., a local fraternity
founded in 1916. The pur-
pose of the fraternity is to
develop the nobler qualities
of the mind and the ﬁner
feelings of the heart and to
provide mutual helpfulness
in the attainment of indi-
vidual and social excellence
among members. The colors
of the fraternity are dark
and light blue, and the
ﬂower is the flour ole Zia". T/9e
Key is the quarterly publica-
tion.

 

 

Phi Mu is an outgrowth
of a local organization
known as Philomathean So-
ciety established at Wesley-
an College in Macon, Geor-
gia on March 4, 1852. On
June 24, 1904, the name was
changed to Phi Mu; a policy
of expansion was adopted.
There are now ﬁfty—nine
chapters in the national
chain. The local was estab-
lished in 1919. Although
primarily a social fraternity,
Phi Mu emphasizes scholar-
ship and philanthropic
work. The national organ-
ization has established the
Alpha Memorial Scholar-
ship Fund for loans to un-
dergraduates; it gives a
loving cup to the chapter
that stands highest scholas-
tically; each year it presents
a $1000 graduate fellow-
ship, administered by the
American Association of
University Women, to a
woman student in any col-
lege where the fraternity has
a chapter.

With the purpose of ad-
vancing Catholic thought
and ideals, and of. making
possible an opportunity for
friendship and cooperation
among Catholic university
women, Theta Phi Alpha,
national social fraternity for
Catholic women, was
founded at the University of
Michigan in 1912. A Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh group,
originally founded as a local
organization, Epsilon Pi
Epsilon, in 1922, became
Kappa chapter of Theta Phi
Alpha in 1922, The colors of
Theta Phi Alpha are gold
and silver. The local chapter
has individual colors of sil-
ver and blue. The national
publication is called The
Campamq it strives to Weld
together the different fra-
ternities composing the
national group into an inter-
related unit.

On October 15, 1898 Zeta
Tau Alpha, located at the
Virginia State Normal
School, was Chartered by a
Special act of the legislature.
Zeta Tau Alpha was the
first women's fraternity to
be given a charter by the
State of Virginia. The local
Chapter was established on
the campus in 1915. Previ-
ously it had been known as
CIC—COnIpaniOnS in Com-
mon. Zeta Tau Alpha main-
tains a scholarship loan fund
to which contributions are
made on National Day. It
is interesting to note that
these contributions must be
earned rather than merely
donated. The fraternity has
established the Mt. Health
Center in Currin Valley,
Virginia, in honor of the
founders of the fraternity
and of the State of Virginia.

The Council of Presidents of Social Fraternities
was organized in the fall of 1934 as a temporary
body to supplant the former interfraternity
council. It is composed of all the presidents of
the thirteen national social fraternities on the
campus. It is the governing body of the fra-
ternities and has legislative, judicial, and
executive powers in matters concerning rushing

,,,,,,,, ,.Pz' Lambda P122"

and interfraternity policy. On October 31, the
by-laws ratiﬁed by the different fraternities, were
approved by the University Fraternity Commit-
tee, Which also granted University recognition
to this council. The Council sponsored this year
interfraternity dances and sings; it made possible
an extensive and varied athletic program.

Men's

fraternities still

exist in the public mind as

groups dedicated to the destruc-

tion of the peace of citizens and

pledges. Not that this popular conception

is without basis in fact. Years ago a fraternity

was considered unworthy of the name if it could

not boast of a whole series of destructive pranks and

of a strenuous program for wearing down pledges.

Today, however, the fraternities are gradually discarding

their old activities; they are developing other functions,

formerly less employed. Pledgeship is losing the embarrass-

ment of hardship and obligation; it is becoming a game in which
sportsmanship and adaptibility are the qualities tested. Hell-week

is becoming an initiation period in which efforts are made to prove
worthiness by logical and constructive methods instead of by the
ridiculous antics of past fraternalism. . . . To the individual, the
fraternity offers many things; chief of them is the test of ability to get
along with other men. A fraternity is not alone a place to eat and sleep,

not alone a place to play ping-pong and pool. It provides organization
and integration of college spirit, friendship, and cooperation, set in a
socially pleasant background. The fraternities’ purpose is not to cater to
the man who seeks to make contacts with the sole View of his private
advantage or who uses the fraternity as a pleasant playground for four years.
Aims which stress loyalty to the University and attention to substantial
intellectual progress are in accord with desires to create a suitable environ-
ment for college men; their purpose has nothing to do with selfish individual

advancement.

The Delta Tau Delta
members are strong support-
ers Of the University social
affairs. The fraternity, to
the end of organizing itself
as a unit, has a dormitory
type house. Their strong
fraternity spirit manifests it-
self in support of interfra—
ternity activities. The
group has Won many Cups;
they have Won the Interfra-
ternity Sing for the last
three years. A local fratern-
ity on the University camp-
us, Alpha Alpha, became
Gamma Sigma chapter of
Delta Tau Delta in 1914.
Alpha chapter of the nation-
al organization was founded
at Bethany College, West
Virginia in 1859. There are
nOW seventy—ﬁve chapters.
Delta Tau Delta aims to de-
velop its members along
spiritual, social and intel-
lectual lines. The local pub-
lication is the Panther Delta;
the house is located at 4712
Bayard Street.

The Kappa Sigmas have
stood forth amid new and
attractive furnishings since
their recent ﬁre. The group
is strong in track activities,
both collegiate and inter-
collegiate. The members
have a strong fraternity
spirit; in the Thanksgiving

gave his thanks for being a
Kappa Sigma. Kappa Sigma
is one of the largest national
fraternities; founded at the

blish bonds of fraternal
friendship; it encourages ex-
cellence in scholarship and
participation in eXtra—cur—
ricular activities. T/ac Kappa
Sigma journal is the local
publication.

 

 

The Gamma Epsilon
chapter of Lambda Chi
Alpha was founded on the
campus in 1916. Recently it
has played a prominent part
in glee—club activities. This
year it has had a strong
pledge group, interested
both in scholarship and in
university activities. In co-
operation with the national
oﬂices Gamma Epsilon has
inaugurated a pledge train-
ing period. Alpha chapter
Of the national group was
founded 1919 at Boston Uni-
versity; at the present time
Lambda Chi Alpha has
eighty—f1ve chapters. The
local publication is The
Smo/eexmc/e. The fraternity
strives to achieve coopera-
tion and friendship among
its members, and to stimu-

The Pennsylvania Iota
chapter of Phi Delta Theta,
for some time strong in
athletics, has recently made
striking gains in scholar-
ship. They show also an in-
creasing interest in activi-
ties. The University group
Was originally a local frater-
nity, Delta Sigma Chi. In
1917 it joined the Phi Delta
Theta chain which now in-
cludes one hundred five
chapters. Phi Delta Theta
was founded December 26,
1848 at the University of
Miami, Oxford, Ohio. The
national publication is The
Scroll of Phi Delta Them
which serves to unify the
different branches of the or-
ganization. The fraternity
colors are azure and argent.
It is the aim of Phi Delta
Theta to encourage excel-
lence in scholarship and to
develop a high moral char-
acter among its members.

 

 

The different chapters of
Phi Epsilon Pi have given to
their national group an en-
viable scholastic reputation.
The organization is the
holder of the National
Scholarship Cup which is
given to the fraternity hav-
ing twenty or more chap-
ters, with the highest
scholastic standing. Phi
Epsilon Pi was at the head
of the University fraternity
scholarship ratings for the
first semester of the school
year. The group has a
strong fraternity spirit. The
alumni members are loyal
and active; both alumni and
undergraduates are Out-
standing in Cap and Gown
productions. The Universi-
ty group is Zeta chapter of
Phi Epsilon Pi. The nation-
al organization was founded
at C. C. N. Y. in 1904.
There are now thirty—two
chapters. The fraternity
Colors are puple and gold.

Pi Kappa Alpha has done
much to develop its mem-
bership by fraternity partici-
pation in University and
interfraternity activities,

terest in scholarship and

come of Omega Delta, local

Sigma Alpha Epsilon, one
of the most prominent na-
tional fraternities, was
founded at the University of
Alabama in 1856. The Uni-
versity branch of the fra-
ternity is the outgrowth of
a local group, Chi Omicron,
which joined Sigma Alpha
Epsilon in 1913, as Pennsyl-
vania Chi—Omicron chapter.
Sigma Alpha Epsilon aims
to promote and perpetuate
college friendships. The lo-
cal publication is Xpo12z'/am/;
the national publication,
which serves by exchange of
information concerning the
different chapters to keep
the group a close-knit unit,
is the Record of Sigma Alp/m
Eprilan. The fraternity col-
ors are royal purple and old
gold. The local chapter of
Sigma Alpha Epsilon is one
of the most busy fraternities
on campus in social affairs.

 

 

The local chapter of
Sigma Alpha Mu was organ-
ized ten years after the
founding of the national fra~
ternity in 1904. Psi chapter
is one of the forty groups in
the national chain. The
quarterly magazine of Sigma
Alpha Mn is The Octagon.
The purpose of the frater-
nity is to form a close social
and fraternal union of Jew-
ish students at the various
universities, colleges, and
professional schools in the
United States. The local
publication is T/ae P.tz'—Rm;
the colors are purple and
white. Members of Sigma
Alpha Mu are outstanding
in the business divisions of
University publications.
During the course of the
year the local chapter of the
fraternity has moved to new
quarters at 4211 Bigelow
Boulevard.

The University of Pittsburgh Dental Interfraternity Council—a
branch of the National Dental Interfraternity council founded in
Chicago in 1922—is made up of two representatives elected by each of
the three dental fraternities. The fraternities take turns in entertaining
the council members at regular monthly meetings. The council
promotes each year interfraternity competition in basketball, bridge,
and mushball; it sponsors a dance every year; it regulates and formu-
lates rules for the rushing and pledging of new members. The group
aims to stimulate harmony among the different fraternities under its
jurisdiction.

versities first

began to appear at the close

of the Middle Ages. If we

examine their beginnings, we are

struck, first of all perhaps, by the turbu-

lence of the life of scholars. Education then

was literally forced to fight. Comments on riots

between town and college, between student groups

of different nationalties fill many pages of early uni-

versity history. But we sense, too, the intellectual

curiosity, the mental combativeness that made of university

education an adventure stimulating scholastically as well as

politically, an adventure which produced a type of thinking that

helped to stir thelworld into the renaissance. Today universities

are welcomed by cities; education is not a matter of fighting town

fathers and foreign students; there is not the same newness about
intellectual effort. Today we cannot secure an intellectual vitality so
thorough-going as that of an age when education was still a surprise.

But such vitality can be created, if not for all the students, at least for
those who through scholarship and interest have caught the spirit of
intellectual adventure. For students such as these the honorary fraternities
exist. They create opportunities for students conscious of the stimulation
of serious thinking to meet together and in discussion, recreate an atmos-
phere of intellectual combat, an atmosphere which not only adds to the
stature and satisfaction of individuals, but which provides needed reenforce-
ments for an age seriously in need of clear thinking. Professional fraternities
have the further function of satisfactorily introducing students to the pro-

fessional leaders of the fields which they expect to enter.

The first chapter of the Alpha Omega Fraternity was organized at
the Pennsylvania College of Dental Surgery, Philadelphia, in 1907.
Since its inception the fraternity has grown steadily until today, with
its many undergraduate and alumni chapters, it is international in
scope. The Omicron Chapter of Alpha Omega was established at the
University of Pittsburgh, December 13, 1920, by a group of Jewish
dentists headed by Dr. Albert 1. Wise, present Praetor of the chapter.
The purpose of the fraternity is to foster social recreation; to spur
professional and intellectual achievement; to make college dental

training a signiﬁcant force in the lives of graduates.

Druids, men's national honorary activities
fraternity for sophomores, was founded at Penn
State in 1907 by a group of outstanding sopho-
mores who wished to revive the traditions of
the ancient religious cult of the Druids. Delta
chapter was organized at the University of
Pittsburgh in 1920. Druids started the year by

203

revising its constitution, making the require-
ments for admission more stringent and provid-
ing for a membership of eighteen instead of
ﬁfteen, thus allowing for the recognition of more
men. In order to stimulate interest in activities,
Druids awards each year a plaque to the most
outstanding sophomore activities man.

Scabbard and Blade, honorary military fraternity was founded to bring into a
closer relationship the military departments of American Universities and Colleges.
The organization strives to develop in its members the qualities of efficient officers, to
prepare them to take an active part and to wield an inﬂuence in the communities in
which they reside to the end of disseminating intelligent information concerning
military requirements. Membership in Scabbard and Blade is drawn from Junior and
Senior Cadet oﬂicers and from those who will become Cadet Officers. Although the
organization's chief purpose is to recognize activity in the military department, it
holds such social affairs as smokers, stag dinners, and a yearly dinner-dance.

The Pitt Riﬂes organization is an Outcome of a unit in the Reserve Officers Training

Corps known as the Model Drill Platoon.

The model platoon was active from

November, 1931, to January, 1932; it was open to all men who volunteered to receive
extra drill instruction. In February, 1932, the Original organization became known as
the Pitt Riﬂes; it retained its original purpose. The group affords members an oppor-
tunity to gain extra skill and practice in close order drilling. The yearly activities of
the group include an Armistice Day Parade, a drill—exhibition in the spring. Last
year Pitt Riﬂes activity Keys as well as pledge pins for prospective members appeared
on the campus. Its insignia is a braided silk fourragere which is worn on the left
shoulder of the uniform.

Pi Tau Phi, honorary scholastic fraternity in
the college, was founded in 1925 for the purpose
of recognizing University students Who have
maintained high scholastic rating throughout
their undergraduate years. In 1932, because each
of the undergraduate schools had its own fra-
ternity to recognize Outstanding students, Pi
Tau Phi limited its membership to students in
the college. The membership policy of the

fraternity is highly restrictive. To be eligible for
membership the student must have maintained
at least a 2.2 average. Character and participa-
tion in student activities are also considered
when the fraternity taps new members. The
function of Pi Tau Phi has broadened to include
a stimulating yearly program. The fraternity
brings to its members Outstanding scholars in
various fields of knowledge.

Chi Rho Nu, honorary pre-medical fraternity
for men, was founded in 1922 as the Chiron Club;
it was Chartered by the University in the follow-
ing year. The original group was the outgrowth
of a need for an organization which would
supplant numerous Smaller and less useful
groups. The present name of the organization
was adopted in January, 1930, when the group

became an honorary fraternity. The Standards
for membership are high. The organization
fosters friendship among pre-medical students;
it stimulates an active interest in the medical
profession through visits to medical schools and
clinics and through lectures given by prominent
physicians and professors.

Recognition by Sigma Tau is an honor
bestowed on students of outstanding ability in
the ﬁeld of engineering or mining. In selection of
its members, the fraternity considers not only
the scholastic standing of the students in the
schools devoted to these subjects, but also to
qualities of sociability and interest. It presents a
silver and bronze medal each year to the sopho-

214

more who has made the highest scholastic
standing during his freshman year. The group
exists primarily to stimulate interest in pro-
fessional considerations; it does not slight, how-
ever, more informal activities. Sigma Tan is a
member of the Association of College Honor
Societies.

Tau chapter of Kappa Phi Kappa,
honorary national educational fraterni-
ty, was organized on the campus of the
University of Pittsburgh in May, 1926.
Dr. Quincey Rohrbach, a member of the
Philadelphia chapter of the national
organization, helped a group of young
men in the School of Education to
enlarge their group, to organize, and to
join the national fraternity. Since the
time of its founding the local chapter of
Kappa Phi Kappa has developed friend-
ship, through its program of combined

217

social and educational meetings, among
prospective teachers and established
educational leaders. The group sponsors
informal functions at which educators
and students leave behind class rooms
and text books and meet each other on
the grounds of social pleasure. But at
other times, contacts of a more serious
nature are effected. Speakers of impor-
tance in the educational world are
secured; discussions are held in order to
achieve clariﬁcation of the complexities
of pressing educational problems.

Phi Alpha Theta, national honorary history
fraternity, honors with membership those Stu-
dents, majoring in history, who have manifested
a deep and abiding interest in this study and who
have maintained high standards of scholarship.
The organization was founded by Dr. Andrew N.
Cleven at the University of Arkansas, March 14,
1921. When Dr. Cleven came to the University
of Pittsburgh the following year he organized
the Beta chapter. Phi Alpha Theta, the only
national honorary history fraternity, now is

composed of seventeen chapters throughout the
United States. Its primary purpose is to recog-
nize excellent work done in the field of history
and to diffuse historical knowledge. Those
students who are considered for membership
must have completed at least eighteen credits in
history with honor grades. Furthermore,
deﬁnite scholastic standards must be met in other
college work. Graduate and honorary members
also make up the composition of the group.

Pi Lambda Theta is a national honorary
organization which aims to hold high the
standards of character, scholarship, and
professional training for women in the
educational ﬁeld and to promote the spirit
of fellowship among women in the teach-
ing profession. Recently Pi Lambda Theta
celebrated the twentieth anniversary of
the founding of Kappa Pi, the parent
organization at the University of Pitts-
burgh. Members of Kappa Pi were in-
strumental in forming the national
organization of Pi Lambda Theta now
consisting of thirty two college chapters

In the last analysis, it is individual minds rather than buildings which
determine the force and push of educational attempts. In some classrooms
there is dispassionate, unmoved recital of past thoughts, past events, or
omnipotent labeling of present thoughts and present events. But in others
there is a concerned dynamic force. A professor, whether his course deals
with past or present, may lean over the lecturer’s table, grip his class with
fingers of vigor and power, and catch them up into a sphere of thought
and activity wedded to the needs and spirit of the present; or, in another
room, students and professor may thrash out at one another in an attempt
to formulate their reactions to the central problems of our existence. In
how many classes is there this dynamic spirit? In how many love of knowl-
edge for its own sake? That is for us to answer out of our own experience. It
is for us to probe our consciousness to determine what efforts we ourselves
have made to come to grips with the problem of monotonous endless
tramping existence. For we who are a part of the University must carry
our share of the responsibility.

Not all the good which a university can do the student comes from the
classroom, or the fraternity house, or the club. It is in the various fields
of sport that the student finds a training-ground for the development of his
physical self. Beyond the regular scheduled gymnasium classes, the
department of athletics sponsors teams in every field of competition.
Through participation in these fields the student finds relief from the tedium
of study; he benefits from the experience gained by pitting his skill and
muscles against those of his classmates in healthy competition. Not all
those who put their greatest efforts into their development are able to
represent the University on a varsity squad, it is sure. And not to all of
those who work and battle throughout a season's schedule is granted the
honor of wearing a varsity letter on a varsity sweater. Yet there is some-
thing in athletic competition other than the thrill of wearing letters. It is
that something which brings capacity turnouts to each locker room on the
opening of a season's practice, which keeps college men running, jump-
ing, tackling, and dribbling night after night, and year after year. Some-
one has said that one's education is a security which can never be lost; it
follows also that the good fellowship, good sportsmanship, and physical
development which come to him who participates in athletics remain long
after the diploma has hung framed on the wall and the words of “Hail to
Pitt" become only a blurred memory in the mind.

When W. Don Harrison, director of athletics,
laid out the 1934 program for the varsity foot-
ball team, he passed out to Dr. John Bain Suther-
land, head coach, what was perhaps the tough-
est schedule any team in the country was called
upon to face. In his eleventh year as head of the
Panther football destinies, “Jock” came back
from a summer trip to Scotland with a “High-
land Fling," a new shift used in Panther offen-
sive maneuvers, and went right to work in
priming his men to go out and win eight of those
nine battles. The sole defeat was handed out by
the Minnesota Gophers, an outﬁt that was hand-

ing out defeats to anyone and everyone it came
across on the gridiron. When all the words and
phrases of football had been brushed off and put
away for the last time, it was generally conceded
that the Panthers of 1934 were privileged to be
listed among the top three of the country's foot-
ball teams. The Sutherland charges, who were
ably assistant-coached by William Kern, Ralph
Daugherty, Edward Hitshberg, Walter Milligan,
Dr. Edward Baker, and Howard O’Dell, found
their way to the top despite a stiff schedule and
the loss of graduated stars such as Skladany,
Walton, and Hogan.

 

GENERAL ALUMNI ASSOCIATION

 

JOHN W. HALLOCK, Secretary

The General Alumni Association is an organi-
zation of more than twenty thousand graduates
of the various schools of the University. Prac-
tically all colleges and universities maintain
active alumni associations. It is the hope of our
organization that we can provide a signiﬁcant
service, not only to graduates and former stu-
dents of the University, but also to under-
graduates. In order to accomplish this we are
anxious to carry in our alumni publications and
to emphasize in our program of activities timely
information about current student affairs.

As stated in its constitution, its object is "to
promote the welfare and interests of the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh and its alumni, to foster
close cooperation between alumni and the Uni-
versity, and to support and advance the cause of
higher education." The Association does more
than that—it provides opportunity for helpful
fellowship; it promotes the friendships and as-
sociations of student days; as an organization, it
safeguards the interests of the University, its
faculty, students, and alumni. It is a great,
constructive, civic force and every eligible
individual should align himself immediately
upon graduation.

Members of the General Alumni Association
automatically become members of the constitu-
ent alumni association representing the school
from which they were graduated. There are ten
such constituent associations,—College, Engi-
neering and Mines, Business Administration,
Medicine, Dentistry, Law, Pharmacy, Down-
town Division, Education and Graduate Schools,
and Alumnae. The General Alumni Association
holds only two stated meetings a year. Con-
stituent school associations meet frequently and
promote the distinctly professional relation-
ships.

The governing body of the General Alumni
Association is Alumni Council. This consists of
three elected delegates from each of ten con-
stituent associations, three elected delegates
from Pitt Clubs outside of Allegheny County,

19

 

DON F. SAUNDERS, Editor
T/ae Record and The Alumni Review

and the elected officers of the General Alumni
Association. Alumni Council divides itself into
the following committees: Executive, Finance,
Program, Publications, Alumni Headquarters,
Membership, Relations with Constituent As-
sociations and Clubs, Relations with Under-
graduates, New Students, and Aims and Objects
Committee.

In populous centers Pitt Clubs are chartered by
Alumni Council to hold regular meetings and to
foster and perpetuate an interest in University
aﬂ"airs. The oldest of these Clubs was formed in
1914. Clubs are now active or are in the process
of organization in Westmoreland County, Johns-
town, New Castle, Erie, Harrisburg, Connells-
ville, Allentown, Scranton, Philadelphia,
Newark, N. J., New York City, Youngstown,
Ohio, Steubenville, Ohio, Chicago, Illinois, and
Southern California.

The General Alumni Association has two
oﬂicial publications,—T/ae Pitteburglv Record and
the Alumni Review. The Record is published four
times a year and the Review seven times a year.
Both publications are sent to members in good
standing.

The Placement Bureau is operated by the
secretary's office, to assist in putting alumni in
touch with prospective employers. A very
effective work has thus far been done in this
connection.

Dues in the General Alumni Association are
$3.00 a year, payable July ﬁrst. These dues in-
clude a year's subscription to the Pittrburgb
Record and the Alumni Review; membership in one
constituent school association (and to a Pitt
Club if the alumnus lives in a Club territory),
and all the general and special services men-
tioned. Above all, the payment of the annual
dues aligns the alumnus with the organization
which keeps him a member of the University
body as long as he remains in good standing.

For further information regarding the General
Alumni Association or its activities, address the
secretary, 1301 Cathedral of Learning.

PITT—26 WASH-_]EFF—6

While the rain came down in great quantities
the Panthers took on Washington and Jefferson’s
Presidents in the season's opener at the stadium.
After sliding around in the mud until the second
quarter without doing more than getting their
uniforms dirty, the Pitt boys suddenly opened a
hole in the W. and line around midﬁeld and
Heine Weisenbaugh scampered through for the
first touchdown of the season. Izzy Weinstock
slammed through the line on a short buck for
touchdown number two just before the half
ended.

No sooner had the boys got down to business
in the second half than Dan Croft, a substitute
halfback for the Presidents, raced almost the
length of the ﬁeld on an end sweep for W. and
].’s first touchdown against Pitt in a decade.
There was plenty of cheering from the Wash-
_]eff section on this one and, come what may, the
Little Washington patriots had had a good day,
or even a good year for that matter.

Weinstock added another touchdown as the
fourth quarter opened and Leon Shedlosky, a
sub Pitt halfback, made good on his first appear-
ance by turning in the fourth touchdown of the
day for the Panthers.

PITT—27 WEST VIRGIN IA—6

Continuing their four-touchdowns-a—Saturday
fare, the Panthers pushed the West Virginia
Mountaineers a little bit farther back into the
mountains at Mountaineer Field in Morgantown
on October 6. The Panthers appeared for the
first time in their white jerseys, thereby defying
the old tradition of blue and gold shirts, and
causing innumerable sports writers to tear their
hair because the Pitt athletes could no longer be
called the “Golden Cats.” '

It didn't take long for the men in white to
put the scoreboard boys to work. Harvey Rooker

Hartwig, Captain Kutz

227

Munjas

snagged a pass from Mike Nicksick and went
half the length of the ﬁeld for the first score.
Repeating his performance of the preceding
Saturday, Leon Shedlosky personally conducted
the second touchdown drive to give Pitt a 14-0
advantage at the half. Weinstock and Weisen-
baugh each made good a kick after touchdown.

Eck Allen, the “Green Mountain Boy,"
tossed a pass to halfback Heath, and when Heath
just failed to get over the last white line Allen
took the ball over himself after hammering a
couple of times at Pitt's line. Weisenbaugh
counted a six-pointer on his specialty, the sucker-

Nicksick

Weisenbaugh

play, after scooting along close to the sidelines
in the neatest run of the day. Baxter added the
ﬁnal touchdown after catching a pass from
Malarkey.

PITT—2O SOUTHERN CAL~6

With the gossip of “toy football players pam-
pered by movie stars” buzzing in their ears, the
Trojans of Southern California migrated into
town and stayed just long enough to absorb a
good, substantial beating from an aroused Pan-
ther which had several scores to settle up with
these men of Troy. Before the Southern Cals had

Wilkins Wojcihovski

taken in many whiffs of the stadium air, Izzy
Weinstock had banged through their line and
the panthers were ahead for keeps.
Weisenbaugh did his daily stunt by running
back a punt to put the ball in scoring territory
and then carrying it over on an end sweep after
Baxter caught a pass to push it along a little
farther. Now that the walls were down, the
Trojans started out to bring some order to the
mess, and Cotton Warburton tossed a couple of
passes to Cal Clemens, the ﬁnal one resulting in
the single touchdown allowed the Californians.
In the third quarter a half-blocked punt gave
Pitt the ball in the U.S.C. territory and Randour

Dougert Kliskey McCue

Randour Rector Schnidel

faded back to toss a pass to Baxter. Little Cotton
Warburton was johnny-on-the-spot to break it
up, but Mr. Baxter scooped it right from under
Cottontop's nose and that was the end of the
scoring and the Trojan menace.

PITT—7 MI N NESOTA—1 3

They came from out of the midwest, those
Minnesota Gophers, and we liked 'em a lot for
three quarters. During those three quarters they
were content to be meek little Gophers who let
the Panthers run around just as the Panthers
pleased. But just as the sun started to go down
those little Gophers got their dander up and

Shedlosky

229

Stark Woods

Troglione

swept through the Panthers.

Carrying the ﬁght all the way, Pitt took com-
mand of in the first half and marches off the ﬁeld
with a 7-0 lead as the half ended. The score came
as the result of a beautiful piece of lateral pass
work on the parts of Messrs. Weinstock and
Nicksick. The beginning of the second half
brought a few signs of life from the Gopher camp
as Stan Kostka, burly fullback, began smashing
into the Pitt line for sizeable gains. A punt fum-
bled by Bobby LaRue, who had been handling
them ﬂawlessly all afternoon, gave the Minne-
sotans the break they had been waiting for.
Alphonse, Gopher halfback who was reported

to be out of his mind at the time, steered his
way around left end for the tying score. Once
the steam-roller had started there was no one to
put on the brakes, and a few minutes later Pug
Lund passed to Tenner and Tenner stepped over
the goal-line and came down hard on Pitt's
championship hopes.

PITT—3O WESTMINSTER—0

Only a handful of spectators braved the rain,
snow, sleet, and every other variety of element
which New Castle has to offer, in order to watch
the Panthers romp with the Westminster Titans
on a ﬁeld that was drowned in mud. The Pitt

Olejnicsak Ormiston Rooker

Ruff

230

second team got most of the workout and the
seconds proved themselves to be very good mud-
ders, keeping the Titans well in hand all the way.

Izzy Weinstock, the people’s choice, gave the
fans their biggest thrill and caused them to for-
get their chills as he tore off a 65-yard touchdown
run as the customers were yet adjusting their
umbrellas. Playing behind a second-team line,
Izzy sloshed his way over for touchdown number
two. Hub Randour added another six-point
effort just before the half ended and Rector
missed the try for the point as a matter of pro-
cedure. The boys might as well have been kick-
ing at a stuffed pig, the ball was that soggy.

Randour broke loose again in the second half
for another touchdown, in a short time Mike
Nicksick was scampering down the ﬁeld with the
ball and the ﬁnal touchdown.

PITT——19 NOTRE DAME—O

The Nicksicks and the Shedloskys made it
tough for a bunch of Irishmen in the stadium,
and as a result of their rambling with a football
under one arm, the greatest three-act football
program Pittsburgh has ever seen was concluded
with 19-0 victory. It just didn't seem to be the
day for Notre Dame, and when Mr. Shedlosky

Malarkey

231

McClure Valenti

Quarantillo

gathered in a punt on the run and kept running
the length of the ﬁeld for the ﬁrst Pitt touch-
down, the Irish put away‘ their shillalahs for
better times. just before the half ended, big Arn
Greene, sub quarterback, intercepted one of
Notre Dame’s passes and carried the mail far
down the ﬁeld and over the goal-line, but an
ofﬁcial detected his foot skidding just outside the
boundary line and it was no go.

Mike Nicksick went on another long journey
into the end zone, and the Irish hearts were very
unhappy. Here Weinstock added the ﬁrst suc-
eessful try for point that the panthers had made
in seven tI‘lCS.

Weisenbaugh got his daily long run on an in-
tercepted pass, Shedlosky made another play for
the spotlight with a run of thirty some yards,
and Nicksick took it over without an enemy
hand touching him. The play of Captain Hartwig
and Ken Ormiston at the guards was a constant
headache to the South Bend backs.

PITT~25 NEBRASKA—6

Nebraska's Cornhuskers got just a little bit
sick of Nicksick in their annual tussle with the
Pitt Panthers, the site of this one being Lincoln,
Nebraska. Four times this gentleman raced along
for touchdowns behind the most perfect block-
ing the Panthers turned in during the year.

Panther plays were clicking as never before,
and the boys were tossing the ball around on
lateral passes much as the native Nebraskans
toss corn cobs. It was only after the ﬁrst-string-
ers had left the game that the pace let up enough
for the Huskers to get a little interest in the game
and toss a pass to Ray Tomans, sub end, who
stumbled over the goal line for Nebraska's only
score.

The Play of Nicksick cannot be mentioned
without all due praise to Izzy Weinstock who
generally managed to get the ball past the ﬁrst-
line trenches and then ﬂip it to Nicksick before
barging with all speeds forward into an enemy
Cornhusker. Likewise the play of the guards,
tackles, ends, the other backs, and that center of
interest, George Shotwell, merits mention.

PITT~31 NAVY—6

A Navy crew that had been riding high on a
victory wave all season was the next on the list
for the Pitt steam-roller, and that crew is still
standing with one hand on the rail. With pre-
cision and power that had Washington sports
writers marveling for days afterward, the Pan-
thers sliced and cut their way through Middie
lines to a lopsided victory of what had been the
class of the East.

Weinstock went over from the one-yard line
before the Midshipmen had a chance to weigh
anchor, and Bobby La Rue added touchdown
number two on a jaunt around left end just as
the quarter ended. Mr. Buzz Borries, the Navy's
most heralded red-head, starred hitting the tar-
gets with his passes, and in no time at all his
teammate, King, was standing in the end zone,
clutching tightly the ball tossed over the heads
of the Pitt secondaries by this same Borries.

With only one touchdown lead to work on,
Pitt went to it right after the testing period.
Weinstock had it over on short bucks in very
little time. Hub Randour, who was getting out
into the secondary defense locations at almost
every try ﬁnally eluded Borries and scored. Leon
Shedlosky ﬁnally counted the last touchdown of
the day on a pretty 14-yard run.

PITT—20 CARNEGIE TECH—0

For nine minutes of the first quarter the Scots of
Clan Carnegie took the Pitt "Highland Fling”
and ﬂung it right back into the faces of the Pan-
thers in the Thanksgiving Day football battle
for the city title. But after nine minutes Izzy
Weinstock broke the ice and the Tartan forward
wall to score Pitt’s first touchdown. It would
have been enough to win the game, and what
followed was as drab as the day.

Another Tech fumble in the third quarter,
covered by Doc Hartwig on the two—yard line,
gave Izzy his last chance to cross the goal-line
for Pitt. Shedlosky brought about the setting for
the final Panther score of the season by returning
one of Joe Mihm's punts and then moving the
ball up within scoring distance on a scrimmage
play. Here Hub Randour came into the picture
again and loped around right end for the last six
points.

Eighteen seniors were playing their last game
of ball for Pitt as the city title was placed once
more in the Panther bag.

 

 

DR. H. C. CARLSON

Varsily Baslcellnall

Frmt Row: Hughes, Jesko, Noon, Emrick, Wilson, Cribbs
Second Raw: Carlson, Rowl, Loucks, Nickel, Taylor, Wainio, Roderick, Ferguson, Mallory

Roaring through a series of Mountaineer defenses
which were designed to stop them from gaining the
championship of the Eastern Intercollegiate Basket-
ball Conference, the Golden Cats put their third
straight league title in the bag. West Virginia had
made a real race of it by knocking off the Panthers in
their ﬁnal game of the regular season, leaving the
conference standing at six games won and two lost for
each of the outﬁts.

The Carlson men travelled down to Morgantown
again several days later and put out the typical brand
of ball which they were capable of playing all year
and won handily, 35-22. That left the Panthers high
and dry in the conference lead for the third time and
ﬁnished up the cage season with the exception of the
exhibition battle with Louisiana State University at
Atlantic City.

It was a long season for the Cats, 23 games in all
being played, excluding the exhibition game. In 18
of these the Panthers came off the winners, a record

233

that tied last year's mark. However, the defeat list
shows ﬁve entries this year as against three of last
year.
i The Carlson men started off -the year with but two
regulars retaining in the lineup. Co-captains Claire
Cribbs and Skip Hughes were the holdovers. Cribbs
was moved back from center to guard berth to round
out the combination. Claire, incidentally, was
awarded several All-American honors again this year,
making him perhaps the only player to be called an
All-American center one year and an All-American
guard the next.

Ted Roderick, Pete Noon, and Ross Emrick ﬁlled
out the remaining positions on the generally regular

_ﬁrst ﬁve. Emrick’s sensational scoring spree during

the last few games of the season brought him up to
the top among the Panther scorers. All three of these
players will be available for another year of com eti-
tion. Cribbs, Hughes, and Slim Wainio, depen able
substitute, are three men Dr. Carlson will lose by
graduation.

PITT 52 BUCKN ELL 22

A packed house gathered to watch Dr. Carlson's
ﬁfth annual basketball clinic and remained to watch
Dr. Carlson’s Golden Cats open their season with a
very healthy victory over Bucknell’s Bisons. Skip
Hughes and Claire Cribbs started to put the skids
under the Bison herd, but it remained for sophomore
Frank Loucks to come in as a sub in the second half
and ring up 18 points to lead the scoring in the rout.

PITT 28 NORTHWESTERN 42

For the second time in as many years the Panthers
struck a Snag in their first appearance in the midwest.
This time it was the Northwestern Purple outﬁt that
hung a 42-28 scar on the Panther hide. The Cats were
unable to score from the ﬁeld during the ﬁrst 14
minutes of play and were behind by a 31-9 count at the
half. Led by Ross Emrick, the Carlson men made a
game effort to make up the deﬁcit but it was just too
enormous a task.

PITT 38 IOWA 26

Playing before a crowd of 7,000, the Cats resumed
their winning ways by socking the Hawkeyes down
to a 38-26 defeat at Iowa City. Pete Noon and Skip
Hughes accounted for 10 points agpiece in stopping the
Iowa cagers. Pitt led at the hal , 22-11, and put on a
great passing game in the ﬁnal minutes to thwart
whatever ideas the Hawkeyes had of making a strong
comeback.

PITT 42 BUTLER 22

In the ﬁnal game of the midwestern invasion, the
Cats gained revenge on Butler University's crack cage
team for the defeat suffered at the Indianapolis’ boys
hands the season before. After trailing at one stage
of the contest by a 9-1 count, the Panthers turned on
the power and just missed doubling the score on their
opponents. Skip Hughes again accounted for 10 points
and his teammate Emrick matched that total.

PITT 25 DUQUESN E 27

The Pitt-Duquesne basketball feud was renewed
before a crowd which packed the stadium pavilion in
a manner that left no doubt that people with not-so-
stout hearts should stay away from Panther-Duke
games. The Cats managed to put on a last-quarter
spurt which brought them from eight points behind
to one point ahead of the Dukes. Three straight fouls
by the Dukes, while the Panthers missed several
ordinary shots in the hectic last few seconds, gave the
ball game to Duquesne.

PITT 38 CARNEGIE TECH 37

In a game that aroused more controversy than any
other game on the schedule, the Panthers nosed out
the Tech Tartans by a one-point margin on the Tech
ﬂoor. The Tartans boasted a seven-point lead at the
half but the Panthers tied it u at 26-26 as the ﬁnal
quarter began. Charley Spisak ropped in ﬁve straight
points in the see-saw quarter to put the Techs ahead
at 37-36. With but seconds left to play, Noon passed
from out-of—bounds to Skip Hughes and Skip sunk the
Tartan brig with one neatly-banked shot at the hoop.
PITT 38 ’ TEMPLE 45

The Cats went skidding all over the smooth Owl
ﬂoor this Saturday night right out of ﬁrst place in the
conference standings as Jimmy Brown and his Temple
teammates chopped out a 45-38 victory over Pitt.

234

Brown netted 15 points to lead the Owl attack and
Fox was close behind with 12. Cribbs counted 15 for
the Panthers but the Carlson men couldn’t cope with
the Owls and the tough luck which saw them deprived
of six ﬁeld goals through rulings by the officials.

PITT 43 FORDHAM 20

Before the 16,000 fans who jammed Madison Square
Garden to watch a basketball double-header, the Cats
licked the Fordham Rams with plenty to spare.
Emrick scored 12 points to lead a Panther attack that
fairly sizzled at times. The famed Pitt fast—passing
demonstration was put on at its very ﬁnest and the
16,000 New Yorkers cheered the Cats to the echo as
they zipped the ball around, through, and between the
dazed rams.

PITT 26 NOTRE DAME 22

Back again at the stadium, the Cats continued their
victory match by taking the Irish of N otre Dame into
camp. They must have had the lid on the basket
during the ﬁrst half of the game, the score reading 11-9
when the period was over. Marty Peters swung into
action immediately at the second half and sent the
Irish ahead. Skip Hughes ﬁnally turned the tide in
Pitt’s favor after Pete Noon had tied up the game.

PITT 38 WESTMINSTER 32

Westminster's great and undefeated Titans came to
knock off the Panthers. For the ﬁrst 20 minutes of the
ball game the Titans did knock off the Panthers. But
ball games last 40 minutes and, as the Titans found
out, the last 20 minutes are likely to be the hardest.
Just a way of saying that the Cats were far behind a
ﬁne Titan team at the half but the ﬁne Titan team was
swept off its feet when the Cats ﬁnally started to go.

PITT 35 WEST VIRGINIA 34

In one of the tightest ball games at the stadium in
a long while the Cats barely ﬁnished ahead of the
West Virginia Mountaineers as big Joe Stydahar's
last—minute Shot rolled over the rim and dropped off.

PITT 22 NAVY 24

Something went wrong at Annapolis and the Pitt
boys came off second best to Buzz Borries and his
mates. A last—minute burst of steam by the navy sent
it into port the winner.

PITT 57 WASHINGTON AND JEFFERSON 30

You could have had 1,000 to 1 odds on this one and
you’d have lost anyhow. The only trouble the Cats
had was in keeping warm on the way home.

PITT 35 DUQUESNE 34

The natives of North Braddock wore their chests
one inch further out the day after this game. For it
was the hometown boy, Roderick, who took a pass
from the hometown boy, Ferguson, and sank the ﬁeld
goal that sank Duquesne. For the ﬁrst time in 25 starts
the Dukes ended up on the short end and once again a
packed house sat limp in its seats following the whirl-
wind last-minute ﬁnish of the breakdown of the
Duquesne band-wagon.

PITT 27 NOTRE DAME 25

In a game faintly reminiscent of the Dempsey-
Tunney long-count affair, the Cats made it four
straight over the Irish. A faulty stop watch kept the
boys going almost 10 minutes beyond the regulation

time and both fives were playing with tongues hang-
ing out when it was all over. Cribbs made his famous

“from the ﬂoor" remark, “Am I hurt? No, just
exhausted. "
PITT 34 TEMPLE 25

Whatever ideas the Panthers had that they could
clip the wings of the Temple Owls, they were sus-
tained as Temple went down to defeat before a snarling
Cat outfit in a return engagement at the stadium. The
Owls were never in the ball game as the Carlson men
romped to victory.

PITT 42 GEORGETOWN 24

Georgetown's Hoyas, doormat of the Eastern Inter-
collegiate conference for the season, didn't give the
Panthers much trouble at Washington, D. C.

PITT 36 CARNEGIE TECH 31

The Tartans came over to Pitt’s floor to do battle
but the result was the same. This time Claire Cribbs
said goodbye to the Skibos with an exhibition of
basketball which the Tartans are not likely to forget.
Cribbs scored 11 points and played a crackerjack ﬂoor
game. Rigg started for the Tartans, who were ahead
at only one stage of the game, but always close enough
behind to keep the Cats stepping.

PITT 40 GEORGETOWN 25

Ross Emrick was afraid he wasn't shooting enough
at the basket. He tried doing it a lot against the Hoyas

235

at the stadium. Result: 18 points for Emrick and
another victory for Pitt. Georgetown pulled up to
26-25 with but four minutes to go and the Panthers
put on a 14-point ﬁinishing touch to the home cam-
paign which left the Hoyas gasping and Dr. Carlson
smiling.

PITT 41 PENN STATE 25

Emrick Went to town again in the little hamlet of
State College, Pa., when he counted 15 points to lead
the Panthers to an easygvictory over the Lions.

PITT 26 WEST VIRGINIA 43

The Panthers went down to Morgantown to sew up
the Eastern Intercollegiate conference crown and came
back after absorbing the worst beating they had all
season. The Mountaineers has an “on" night and
Messrs. Gocke, Simpson, and Phares accounted for
more than enough points between them to stop the
Cats.

PITT 35 WEST VIRGINIA 22

Things were so different when the Panthers jour-
neyed to Morgantown to battle the Mountaineers in
a playoff for the conference championship. Holding
Gocke and Simpson two points each, the Cats turned
on the power and shot through the Mountaineer
defenses almost at will. West Virginia counted only
one ﬁeld goal in the first half, so complete was the
Pitt mastery of the situation.

20

Track

Led by a trio of veteran runners, one of the most evenly—balanced
hill-and-dale teams in recent years at Pitt helped Coach Carl Olson
to complete his third season as cross-country coach with another
enviable record. Only one blot appeared on the Panther score-sheet,
that being the result of a defeat by Penn State’s unbeaten aggregation.

Victories were scored over Westminster, Miami of Ohio, Notre
Dame, and Navy in dual competition. In addition to these meets, the
Blue and Gold representatives brought home the first place title in
the National junior cross-country run, a sixth place in the National
Intercollegiate championships at New York, and a ﬁrst place in the
local Senior A. M. A. meet.

At the conclusion of the season Coach Olson recommended
varsity letters for Charles Kirkpatrick, Kenneth Wagenhouser,
William Albright, Charles Howe, Samuel Musico, Harold Tost,
and William Dornenburg, manager. The ﬁrst four named are seniors,

eaving but two lettermen available for next season's competition.

The Panthers started off with a roar that ran Westminster's Titans right off the Schenley Park course and
the Olson men made it a perfect 15-40 victory over the lads from New Wilmington, Pa. Wagenhouser, Kirk-
patrick, Albright, Musico and Tost led the Pitt procession across the ﬁnish line.

Miami College was next on the list and the Ohioans fell by a 21-34 score as Albright bested Hatﬁeld in a
duel during the ﬁnal lap of the race around the Miami stadium. Kirkpatrick and Tost ﬁnished right after Hatﬁeld.
Pitt's next run was the ill-fated one with Penn State, the Panthers losing by a reverse of the identical score
by which Miami fell. Harvey and Book led the ﬁeld for State, followed by Kirkpatrick and Wagenhouser.

Gaining revenge for a last season’s defeat, the Pitt runners whitewashed Notre Dame’s harriers as Kirk-
patrick, Musico, Wagenhouser, Albright and Tost took the honors for Pitt.

The National junior A. A. U. championships were next on the list and the Pitt runners took the team trophy
with an aggregate of 27 points. Kirkpatrick led the Pitt ﬁeld home by getting third place. Navy's land outﬁt
came next and was checked off after a 19-36 triumph. Sam Musico set a new fourmile course record to win the
event.

In the National I. C. 4 A. meet the Panthers battered their standing of last year by ﬁnishing sixth in the
team standings. Charley Kirkpatrick ﬁnished sixth among all entries over the Van Cortland park course, the
best showing made by a Panther since the days of Ted Corbett In the Senior A. M. A. championships at Schen-
%ey Park, “Kirk" grabbed himself another title as Pitt entrants hogged the places and won the meet easily

or Pitt.

    

CARL OLSON

The freshman hill—and—dalers compiled a record similar to that of their varsity brothers, losing only one
meet, and that to Penn State’s Frosh. Triumphs over Langley, Schenley, a team title in the Junior A. M. A.,
and a third in the Senior A. M. A. gave the runners a very creditable showing for the season.

Numerals were awarded to Franklyn Theriault, John Turchik, Morgan Kishpaugh, Robert Blean, James
Crawford, John Emens, Charles Heller, Guy Horvath, Elliot Howell, Thomas Roberts, Fred Ottie, and Raymond
N ordstrom. Theriault, Turchik, and Kishpaugh were the outstanding performers for the frosh.

Once again Coach Pat Corr’s Panther swimmers
enjoyed a fairly successful season. This time the
natators suffered but two defeats, one being a pretty
tangled-up aﬂ"air with Franklin and Marshall's
undefeated team and the other to Ohio State.

After getting off to a good start by taking the Tartan
tankmen into camp in a dual meet, the Panthers went
off to the east to meet F. and M. and Delaware on
successive evenings. First reports had it that the
Panthers lost the meet with F. and M. by a close score.
The Corr splashers continued on to swamp the Dela-
ware boys, allowing the Mudhens only 14 points.

Manhattan was next on the Pitt list and was
written off in a decisive manner, the Jaspers getting
only one ﬁrst place, and that by Captain Murray.
Pitt totalled 56 to Manhattan’s 15. It was on this
same night that announcement came that the tables
of the F. and M. meet had been reversed and Pitt
declared the winner by one point. In the Eastern
Swimming association meet later in the season the
two teams held a relay race to settle the issue. F. and

238

M. won.

Ohio State waited for the Panthers at Columbus and
the Buckeye swimmers also waited for the Panthers
to cross the ﬁnish line in most of the races, the State
men winning in easy fashion. Pitt was able to cop
only 15 points in the meet.

The big event of the swimming year, the Eastern
Swimming Association Championships, found the
Panthers winding up in second place with a 20-point
total, 12 points arears of the Franklin and Marshall
bugaboo outﬁt. Bill McQuillan captured Pitt’s only
ﬁrst place in the Tech pool affair, winning the diving
event after suffering a broken toe in the qualifying
round. Jack Denny and Russ Lindberg lost heart-
breaking races in the 440-yard and 100-yard freestyle
races.

Lindberg broke by 26 seconds the existing mark in
the A. M. A. 500-yard freestyle championship event
later in the season. Tom Locke, freshman star, and
Jack Denny ﬁnished in second and third places,
respectively.

Even in athletics you can’t have everything. And
Pitt didn't have a successful season at the wrestling
game this year. The grapplers lost all but one of their
four matches, that one ending in a tie. The mat teams
of Waynesburg College, West Virginia University,
Temple University, and the Naval Academy took over
the Panthers. The Pitt boys earned a draw with
Washington and Jefferson.

The Panthers Won two events in both the Waynes—
burg and West Virginia matches. Hinchberger and
Bedillion accounted for the victories in the Yellow
Jacket affair, while Evans and Bedillion won out in
tussles with their respective Mountaineer opponents.
Other men, who entered in the rather meager victory
list were Detzel and Rector, varsity football players
in season, and Niebel.

Red Bedillion was the only wrestler able to keep his
shoulders off the mat in the engagement with the
Middies as the Annapolis boys scored a whitewash
victory over the Panthers.

Other men who did ﬁghting duty for Pitt were

239

Babcock, Cover, Thurston, George, Willetts, Koda-
shov, and Stark, another gentleman who does guard
duty on the football team.

The Panthers came out on the short end when they
met the Temple Owls at Philadelphia. The Owl team
was too well-balanced for the Pitt boys and the result
of the match was never in doubt. When the West
Virginia matmen did battle with the Panthers follow-
ing the Cats basketball game with the Mountaineers,
it was the same sad story.

Although misfortune seemed to come in large pot-
tions to Coach Earl Oster in his ﬁrst year as the
Panther wrestling coach, nevertheless the fact that
most of his mat performers will be available next year
for more com etition should lead to a brighter future.
Every one 0 this year's leading performers will be
available for another try at the mat sport next season.
The added experience they will have gained may help
the Pitt boys to break into the win columns next year
with more regularity. At‘ any rate, let's hope so.

 

 

JACK SCHRICKER

Front Raw: Kopp, Hart, Spiegel, Giannati, Paslowski, Sivak
Second Row: Coach Schricker, Underwood, Gongloff, Linderman, Stoughton, Kennedy, Dines, Kaufman,
Tommarelli, Manager Ebert

In their first season under the tutelage of Jack
Schricker, captain of last season's team, the Pitt
boxers made out with a creditable record in seven
matches. The ﬁnal count showed two won, four lost,
and a draw with Miami University of Florida.

The regular team consisted of Sivak, Paslowski,
Giannatti, Speigel, Dines, Kopp, and Stoughton.
Linderman fought several battles in the heavyweight
division, but he was generally too greatly outweighed
to be pitted against opposing heavyweights.

Captain Jimmy Giannatti enjoyed the most suc-
cessful season among the Panther mittmen, copping
four bouts, earning a draw in one, and losing one. The
loss he avenged by coming through to defeat his
conqueror in the semi-ﬁnals of the Eastern Boxing
conference tourney at Morgantown. Jimmy Went on
to win the ﬁnal bout and became the 135—pound king.

Bernie Speigel, 145-pounder, left-hooked his way to
four victories, one draw, and lost out in two matches.
Bernie also advanced to the ﬁnals of the conference
tourney before being defeated.

240

Boxing

 

Al Paslowski registered three wins as against four
losses. The sophomore 125—pounder showed a promis-
ing left jab which ought to do lots of damage when
cultivated properly. Paslowski appears rugged enough
to hold his own against any comer in the 125-pound
division when he gets experience. Joe Kopp, sturdy
senior, fought another year in tough luck. After
losing three hair-line decisions, Kopp suffered a bad
cut over the right eye in the opening round of his
match with Michel of the Navy.

Light-heavyweight Gene Stoughton slugged his
way to two wins and suffered ﬁve setbacks. Gene’s
performance against his Wisconsin opponent was a
brilliant exhibition of grit, Stoughton sticking it out
to win although he was going on nothing but nerve.
Dines and Sivak, both sophomores, copped but one
verdict apiece, but can easily do better when experi-
ence is on their side.

All in all, Coach Schricker can be right proud of
the record compiled by his boxers. The ﬁstic game
appears to be on the upswing at the University.

Rifle Team

Front Row: Lt. Kleinman, Adams, Truman, Davis, C. Duff, A. T. Duff, Levitske, Sgt. Gunter
Second Raw: Poellot, Miller, Robson, Cirrie, Greer, Cullen, Eichler

Panther riﬂemen, both varsity and R.O.T.C., shot
their way to a successful season. The R.O.T.C. outﬁt,
by capturing 29 victories in 34 skirmishes, compiled a
slightly better record than did the varsity marksmen.
The varsity men had 24 wins against 16 losses to show
for their record for the year. A 1400 score made in
their match against Lehigh was the high spot on the
varsity's ledger.

Coach Kleinman’s performers started their season
January 12 via the postal telegraph route, taking on
two Brooklyn schools. After winning these two
matches, the sharpshooters got their wires crossed by
Cornell and Washington University, both these latter
schools shooting over 1400 in the engagement. In the
same meet, Johns Hopkins and Boston College bit the
dust. Ohio State and Minnesota beat the Panthers in
the next meet.

Throughout February, the Pitt boys ke t up their
rapid ﬁre mixing six victories in with ﬁve efeats, one
of the losses being to Carnegie Tech. The riﬂers hit
their stride in March winning 10 out of 13 encounters.

In addition to their collegiate duties, the varsity

Z41

competed in the N.R.A. Postal League, chalking up
three victories and four losses. Drexel, Cincinnati, an
Lehigh felt the sting of the Panther's telegraphic
bullets, while Cornell, Lafayette, West Virginia, and
Tech held decisions over the Blue and Gold. In the
last match of the season against Lehigh, the boys hit
the 1400 mark which, in rifledom is equivalent to a
.400 batting average in baseball.

Captain Davis, C. Duff, A. T. Duff, Poellot, and
Currie were usually the ﬁve on the ﬁring line for the
Panthers. Of this group only one, Captain Davis, will
be lost through graduation. Otner boys on the team
were Adams, Greer, Cullen, Forney, Booth, Eichler,
Lovitske, Miller, Randazzo, Pickering, Zukas, and
Truman. Sergeant Gunther and First Lieutenant
Kleinman divide the coaching duties.

R.O.T.C. riﬂers, besides compiling their splendid
record, won the Third Corps Area match out Lehigh
for the title. In taking the corps title, the marksmen
hit the bulls-eye 3775 times. Eighteen schools partici-
pated. In the Hearst Trophy match, the R.O.T.C.
team was able to garner third place.

“’o1nen’s Alhlelics

The introduction of many new activities, in addition
to the regularly scheduled sports of a more compli-
cated type of organization, such as hockey and basket-
ball, have made many new sports enthusiasts among
the women at the University. Coeds who are not
interested in developing skill in the more strenuous
forms of games ﬁnd these new recreation sports to be
most exciting. A few others of this same type, but
which require even less skill for the beginner, are:
deck tennis or tenniquoit, tether ball, clock golf, and
horseshoes.

Badminton and deck tennis are games played in
opposite courts divided by a net. In badminton a small
object called a "bird" is batted back and forth across
the net, similar to tennis except that the “bird"——a
light object-—must be kept in the air all of the time.
Scoring in this game is something like scoring in
volleyball in that only the side serving may score a
point. The latter of the two games mentioned above,
deck tennis, is very much similar to volleyball; the
only real difference being in the object used to play
across the net. The oﬂicial piece of equipment is an
inﬂated rubber ring.

Techniques of play are, of course, different from
those in volleyball. The ring is thrown and caught,
many types of twists and spins being applied, whereas
in volleyball a series of vollies from one side to another
constitutes the play. Volleyball is, however, essenti-

ally a team game, but in deck tennis two people may
enjoy all the strategy of the game themselves.

Table tennis, which is a game played with ping-
pong equipment, may be developed to quite an art.
Scoring in table tennis is like that of regular tennis.
Tether ball, clock golf, and horseshoes require only a
very simple set-up. In the first-mentioned, two people
play the game, the object being to wind 3. string
around a pole. This is done by batting a soft ball
which is attached to the lower end of the string, the
other end being fastened onto the top of the pole. The
players stand opposite each other and each tries to
strike the ball, winding it around the pole away from
her. Clock golf takes very litle space, also. A series
of numbers are placed in a circle all at an equal distance
from a hole in the center. Scores of hits are kept from
each number to the hole. Several minutes at each of
these sports, the students rotating in groups from one
to another, constitute a regular play period.

Hockey and basketball have their followers. For
those athletically inclined who wish to engage in
something requiring increase of skill; for those who
like strenuous work, nothing can take the place of
hockey and basketball. They are the outstanding
team games. Many girls at the University have be-
come proficient in these sports and there are many
girls entering who desire to play and to understand
these games.

Every girl at the University, it is hoped, will be a
swimmer before she leaves. Trees pool is open every
day in the week. The fee which a girl pays her
freshman year entitles her to the use of facilities at
hand. There are a number of recreational swimming
periods, W. A. A. hours, and, when permission is
asked, the others are welcome to attend the freshman
class.

A new riding stable has been contacted for those
who have a yen to take up this sport. At designated
times every week girls meet and are taken by auto out
to Ingram where there is a beautiful country of many
winding trails. A riding club is being organized for
week—end recreation.

Instruction and practice in the principle golf strokes
are being taken by those with an interest in the game.
A real golf “bug" feeling may be aroused merely by
trying your skill at driving down in the cellar of the
Oil and Gas Building where there is the necessary
equipment. A

Archery has an outstanding place with a large group
of girls. How to shoot, how to score, and of what a
round consists are among the details of interest.

The feeling of quiet and rest always overhanging the University campus is
disturbed by never-ending clashes and activities. Students move along side-
walks, up steps, chattering, quickly stepping. We feel the gothic spiritu-
ality of the Cathedral of Learning, though we feel, too, threats of collapse,
groundless but inherent in a building whose long unbroken verticals explode
into web-like stone work at the very top. The static Grecian tranquility
and Omnipotent assurance of Alumni Hall overlooks Gothic spirituality and
clashes with it. But differences may be discounted before uses. Are the
buildings part of an educational process which concerns itself with the chal-
lenge of a monotonous present? Does it concern itself only with once-vital
thoughts of the past and with scientifically precise and unemotional in-
quiries into things? Look at the weeping-willow before Thaw Hall. The
freshness and vigor of trees ‘is endlessly real. The weeping-willow asks a
question; it does not answer it. It asks whether its vitality can find a
counterpart in the spirit of the University.

ADVICE THAN THIS

FOR

T is generally agreed that only a small

minority of the population avails itself of
the services of the dental profession. Some
sources estimate the number to be less than
twenty per cent.

However, it is a well known fact that
people are becoming more and more dental-
minded now that they are beginning to ap-
preciate the great value of modern dental
service to their health and happiness.

Consider, then, what a wonderful oppor-
tunity is offered to you dental graduates who
are beginning practice just as this demand for
dental service is gaining momentum!

' By establishing yourselves in the right
locations and equipping your offices with
new Ritter equipment which will enable you
to take full advantage of your skill and pro-
fessional knowledge, you will be prepared to
meet this growing demand for high grade
dental service.

Let the Ritter Architectural Department
help plan your office. Start out with equip-
ment that is built up to a standard . . . not
down to a price. Begin right. . . buy Ritter!

TODAY
YOU STAND AT THE THRESHOLD

Q Spread before you lies the ever expanding drama of
life. How different it is from that of two generations
ago! Count the new facilities for better living that have
appeared on the scene since ﬁfty years ago:

Speedier, more comfortable transportation by air, rail,
highway and water . . . instant communication by radio,
wireless and telephone that most thought impossible a
half-century ago . . . better, more efficient equipment
with which to work in every phase of business endeavor
. . . and, best of all, countless new conveniences and
luxuries for the home.

In making possible these vast improvements, elec-
tricity has played a leading part . . . both directly and
indirectly. Electrical progress has parallelled or led that
of general advancement in living and working condi-
tions. And George Westinghouse, by laying the ground-
work for today’s use of electricity through his develop-
ment of alternating-current machinery and transmission
equipment, stands out as a pioneer in the electrical ﬁeld.

Today, wherever electricity is put to work . . . from
the giant motor that drives the rolls in a steel plant to
the electric refrigerator in your kitchen . . . you will ﬁnd
Westinghouse products completely and dependably serv-
ing industry in all its phases.

In a place set apart for helping men and women to find their way
intellectually and socially the seniors have now lived four years. Much
has gone into their living of those years. Books and lectures, journalism
and creative writing, sports and fraternities, friendships, time to think. A
wealth of food for thought there has been. All the college life of the seniors
has been lived within a period of great social and economic unrest. For
some years they have seen men torn loose from employment; they have
seen their own families’ incomes shrink; they have been forced into contact
with the stimuli for serious thinking which institutions out-of-order provide
for the people they govern. Not only that, they have come to college at a
time when the questioning of the basic concepts of our society has forced
every person to define his position toward intellectual movements. For the
seniors the University has been no cloister withdrawn from the grim
suffering of city streets and the colossal greed of men and nations. But
there have been, besides, days of satisfying surrender to learning, hours
of stimulating companionship, and moments of delight in the spring green
of hillside lawns and the upward reaches of the Cathedral. Enthusiasms
in sports and social occasions have had their place. All these factors that
determine the pattern of college ‘life are important. In them is rooted a
strength and inspiration that, coupled with a determination to relate educa-
tion to actuality, are the best gifts a university can give to its men and
women.

DEANS

Herbert L. Spencer, dean of the College, has risen
rapidly in the education profession. In 1921, he
began teaching mathematics in Wilkinsburg high
school. After a half year at that institution he came
to the Pittsburgh high schools to again teach
mathematics. Later he became a vice—principal;
in 1927 he was made principal of the Frick Training
School. In 1934 he became dean of the College.
While principal of the training school, he held the
positions of instructor, associate professor, and
lecturer, respectively at the University, and ﬁnally
he became dean. Dean Spencer is interested in the
liberal arts method of teacher-training. He was
responsible for the changing of the Frick Training
School to a four year college connected with the
University. He was the first president of the West-
ern Pennsylvania Educational Association.

Dean Spencer’s cheerfulness—he is optimistic
and social—ﬂts him well for his administrative
duties. The dean is particularly interested in artis-
tic photography; he has exhibited some of his
photographs in the International Photography
Salon.

CHARLES E. PRALL
Dam of the School of Education

Dr. Charles S. Tippets, dean of the School of
Business Administration was present at a dinner of
the American Institute of Banking some months
ago. Before the end of the dinner everyone was
calling him by his first name. The dean's ease-
inspiring attitude conceals no carefully planned
front; to him everyone is a human being, a person
to treat kindly and sympathetically. It never seems
to have entered Dean Tippets’ head that his posi-
tion makes him in any way different from his
students. He concentrates on the problem of how
to do most for those with whom he comes in
contact.

After graduating from Mercersburg, Dean Tippets
attended Princeton where he received his B.A.
degree and a fellowship for the study of law at
Harvard. The war interrupted the course in law,
and when the dean returned from France his interest
in economics caused him to drop law. He studied
at Princeton for his Ph.D. and taught there for
three years. Before he came to the University he
served as professor of Economics at Iowa, Wash-
ington University, and Buffalo.

26

Charles E. Prall, dean of the School of Education,
came to the University as an educator with a com-
plete and varied career. From 1912 to 1927 he was
superintendent of four different Iowa school sys-
tems. At that time he became professor of Educa-
tional Research at the University of Arkansas. The
following year he accepted the position of dean of
Education at the Arkansas State University. He
left this position to become dean of Education at
Pitt, September 1934. He is an active member of
the American Educational Research Association
and in the Minnesota Conference on Research in
Higher Education. Dean Prall not only has a thor-
ough knowledge of the problems of education and
of educational research, but a vital and understand-
ing interest in the people with whom he comes in
contact.

Dean Prall enjoys outdoor recreation. In Arkan-
sas, his garden, upon which he expended his char-
acteristic thoroughness, was one of the show places
of the city. The Prall home was from early Spring
to December plentifully supplied with ﬂowers.
Camping and ﬁshing also interest the dean. He
takes many ﬁshing trips with his son. He enjoys
baseball.

CHARLES S. TIPPETS
Dam of the School of Buyineu Adminirrratian

Dr. E. A. Holbrook, Dean of the School of Mines
and Engineering, having received his education at
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, left his
native state for the West. The success which he
enjoyed at the Institute—he was elected to Phi
Kappa Phi, national honorary engineering frater-
nity, Scabbard and Blade, and O.D.K.—carried over
into his work as superintendent of mines in Mon-
tana, British Columbia, and Mexico; and as pro-
fessor of mining and metallurgy at Nova Scotia
Technical College. A professorship at the Uni-
versity of Illinois, service with the United States
Bureau of Mines at Washington and Pittsburgh,
and the ofﬁce of Dean of the School of Mines and
Metallurgy at Penn State preceded his deanship at
the University, to which he came in 1927. Inter-
ested in all kinds of mining, Dr. Holbrook is
recognized as an authority particularly on coal-
mining.

The genial and popular Dean has other interests.
Reading, ﬁshing, a New England farm, to which he
goes every summer, a wife and ﬁve children afford
a rich variety for non-professional hours and long
vacations.

ELMER A. HOLBROOK
Dean 0f the 56/900! of Engineering and Miner

Mr. J. Lloyd Mahoney, director of the Down-
town Division, received his College education at
New York University. He gained his practical
experience at the Guarantee Trust Institute of New
York City. Mr. Mahoney became director of the
Downtown Division in the spring of 1934, after
having been for several years a member of the
faculty of the School of Business Administration.
He is a tireless worker; his working hours leave
him little time except for the reading of books on
economics; he salts this scientiﬁc reading with
books of poetry. Not only is Mr. Mahoney the
energetic, efficient administrator, he is in great
demand as a singer. His musical career began in an
unusual manner when, some years ago, one Sunday
when Mr. Mahoney was singing as one of the
congregation at church, a person of musical training
recognized the excellence of his voice and persuaded
him to take further training. Mr. Mahoney once
thought seriously of taking up music as a profes-
sion. As it is, he sings at many different occasions
in Pittsburgh throughout the year.

SCHOOL OF DENTISTRY
SCHOOL OF PHARMACY

H. Edmund Friesell, dean of the School of Den-
tistry, has a distinguished record of active profes-
sional service. He was one of the founders of the
American College of Dentists; he has been president
and an active member of many dental associations;
he has made many contributions to dental literature
and research. He is chairman of the Dental Index
Bureau which recently completed a listing of all
periodical literature in English.

Dean Friesell was, early in his life, interested in
track and bicycling athletics. In 1892, the combined
efforts of all his relatives were necessary to inﬂuence
him to continue his dental studies and to give up
his plan of riding around the world on a bicycle.
Dean Friesell still indulges his desire for travel,
however. After each of his trips to scenic and his-
toric points in the United States and Canada, the
faculty is curious to know what cemeteries he has
visited and whose tombstones he has photographed.
Dean Friesell has an excellent library of many dif-
ferent types of literature. He has an unusually ﬁne
collection of dental books.

C. LEONARD O’CoNNELL
Dean of the School of Pharmacy

H. EDMUND FRIESELL
Deam of the School of Dentzﬂry

Dr. C. Leonard O'Connell, Dean of the School of
Pharmacy, has been both student and teacher at
the University. He became a member of the faculty
as an instructor in 1922 and, rising steadily, was
appointed to his present position in 1932. At
present he is the only teaching clean in the Uni-
versity. Dr. O'Connell is looking forward to the
day when the School of Pharmacy will be moved to
the Campus. He is an ofﬁcer in the National
Association of Pharmacists.

.He believes that a man must have interests in
different ﬁelds. His own range of interests is wide.
Not only in the ﬁeld of his professional activity is
he prominent; he reads widely in philosophy; to
the work of the Juvenile Court—he is chairman of
its board of management—he gives unselﬁshly
many of his few leisure hours. The Dean is an
excellent mixer, has a great reserve of energy, and
is a good speaker. From the many demands of the
Pharmacy School and the Juvenile Courts, he ﬁnds
relief in a pleasant home with his wife and four
sons.

FAME

 

Colonnades, granite corridors, bronze markers are common

tributes to men and women who have towered above their fellows.
Generally such honor is accorded when the course of life has been
run. Our Hall of Fame, however, is no post-mortem award. The
persons who have received the award have been chosen as the
ones representative of what is thought best in the life of the Uni-
versity, as the ones who seemvto have contributed most to that life.
Among them are scholars, athletes, journalists, social leaders,
business men, and administrators». Prominent in classroom and

Campus activities, -they have helped to determine-the pattern of

University life.

X FOREWORD

The 1935 Owl is an attempt to distil the spirit of the university, to link it
with the world of which it is a part, and to present it in such a way that the
Owl will in years to come give form and color to memories of University
life—memories that will be concerned not alone with single incidents of
classroom, campus, and fraternity but with the whole sweep of University
activity. It is the hope of the editors that they have presented the Univer-
sity in the fulness and the oneness which the word suggests; that they have
indicated a concern for the social tragedy of today as a necessary means of
realizing the possibilities of the University for completeness.

JOHN TIBBY is editor of the Pitt
News in its first year as a tri-

ulty Association, Pi Tau Phi, and

There is quiet, dead quiet in State Hall. We may climb from the ground
floor to the library, from the dim basement corridor with dark slits of doors
to the library floor with white casts of classic gods; and as we climb we
may pant, stifled by an atmosphere of oppressive lifelessness. Everywhere
the past seems to push down with thick walls, shining stone, high ceilings
upon a present in which breathing is difficult . . . Steps and more steps,
and we come to Alumni Hall. Students stand in groups outside, students
shove and push in groups inside, all talking, laughing. The air of gaiety, of
unrestraint, of joyousness is perhaps forced; perhaps we try to cast out of
-our minds the reality of the trudging of Pittsburgh, the reality of its uniform
monotony; perhaps we try to create an atmosphere differentefrom that of
the oppressive antiquity of State Hall. In all events, in Alumni a kind of
jazz-like intoxication catches us up, moves us along almost artificially with

gay emotions. We laugh and shout, and our excitement produces a gaiety,
actual but unreal.

To the casual observer the University may seem collossal; its parts
may appear disjointed, one without logical connection or intercourse with
another. Yet the life is unified. Indeed it is essential if the University is to
occupy a position of importance not only in the community but also in the
minds of its students that some means of drawing together students of
varying interests and groups of varying functions be utilized. Perhaps
more than any other institution of the University the varying activities
serve to bring the students together. Men and women of different fraternity
affiliations meet and mix; prompted by a common interest; students who
follow courses in different schools meet and exchange ideas; organizations
which pursue different fields are brought together and their work is corre-
lated. Knowing this, we may look upon the University as an organism, an
organism which offers the advantages of unification to those who desire to
enjoy them. Activities fulfill this function of unification in all institutions of
learning, from the smallest college to the largest university. Particularly
in an institution like the University, where size militates to a certain extent
against classroom contacts, activities afford for the individual possibilities
of self-realization through the expression of groups. They reinforce class
presentation with an experience which amplifies and gives new meaning
to theory. A class in journalism takes on a new significance for its members
after their actual participation in the production of a newspaper; organiza-
tions for the student of modern languages or political theory offer oppor-
tunities for clarification of thought through participation in discussion.

Miss Thyrsa W. Amos is widely known in the
United States as an outstanding dean of women.
She has served a number of times as president of the
National Association of Deans of Women; her
services as a speaker are in great demand. Through-
out the past year she has spoken before a number of
colleges throughout the United States.

Miss Amos’ national reputation is wide; yet her
importance to the University lies chieﬂy in her ﬁne
contribution to its traditions and its practical
functioning. She has been the guiding spirit in
building up customs such as Lantern Night and
Senior Coronation, functions which epitomize the
thought of many students concerning University
life. She has instituted an orientation program for
freshmen women which is complete and effective.
One of her aims has been to lead women’s organiza-
tions to sponsor only such programs and activities
as are comparable in dignity and signiﬁcance to
work done in the classroom. But, although the
Dean of Women is an unusually busy person, she
has always a ﬂashing smile and a gracious nod for
everyone.

THYRSA W. AMOS
Dean of Women

The professional career of Vincent W. Lanfear,
dean of men, has been active and Varied. Career
and character have come together to make of him
an individual who keeps in touch not only with the
intellectual atmosphere of University life, but with
the underlying human basis. Dean Lanfear received
his ﬁrst college training at the University of Texas.
He earned his way through the University by work-
ing during the summers and in spare time; there he
received his M.A. degree. At Columbia University,
Dean Lanfear completed work for his Doctors de-
gree and served as instructor in Economics. There
followed an assistant professorship of Economics
at Yale, a professorship of ﬁnance at the University,
directorship of the Downtown Division. Last
spring he became dean of men. Dr. Lanfear’s in-
terest in people, his fund of understanding and
sympathy, brought him close to the students and
faculty of each institution of which he was a part.
This sincere and sympathetic attitude toward the
welfare of others has given to him a real importance
at the University.

Many

in number are

the types of organizations of

the University; many in number

are the organizations themselves. Be

one's interest writing, journalistic or

creative; be it languages; be it administration;

be it discussion of religious problems; there is a

coat to fit each figure. These organizations are basic

in the unification of the University. Three times a week

the News appears; it is in touch not alone with campus

activities, with the programs of S.F.A. and the policies of

the University administration, but with the kiln in which the

stuff that makes history is fired, with world wide activities which

have a bearing on undergraduate life and thought. The Pitt
Downtowner unifies the organizations of the evening school. Once

a month the campus collectively chuckles over the Panther. Once a

year the Owl sums up the University and the events of the year. . . .
Some like to argue; some like to convince. The debating societies are
open to these individuals. And, on top of the whole structure, drawing

it together and amplifying it, are the student government organizations.
The Student Faculty Association regulates activities in which both men
and women participate. The Women's Self Governing Association is
responsible for those which are open to women only. The two groups
supervise elections, facilitate the establishment of new organizations as well
as the smooth operation of existing ones, make suggestions for the more

. successful functioning of University activities. The Dental Student Council

fulﬁlls similar functions for the School of Dentistry. Together, publications,
debating, and organizations offer excellent training for the student who is
interested in applying to important considerations methods of expression
and of administration.
