Studying is a major part of student life.
The Internet has expanded the range of infor-
mation available, but it still must be trans-
ferred to the minds of students. There is still
no substitute for sitting down with a book, and
perhaps a pen to take notes, and pouring over
assignments. Professors’

lectures are rehashed:

 
  

”What did she mean by S -
that?” ”Is it really going

to be on the final?” ”He
said there were three
key points, but he only
covered two before he wandered off the sub-
ject.” The pressure becomes more intense
before mid-terms and finals. The Commons
Room in the Cathedral of Learning remains a
popular study spot. Its rather dim exterior and
Gothic ornamentation still seem to help stu-
dents concentrate, as they have done for near-
ly seventy years. The libraries, dorm rooms, or
any old perch will do, as students do their best
to cram learning into their brains.

Established less than three years ago,
the undergraduate College of Business
Administration has made its mark as one of
the nation's leading business schools. Ranked
sixteenth nationally for quality in 1995 by LI.S.
World News 8 Report, CBA has already set a
top of the notch standard to continue building

azfame

up from. Offering majors

ranging from accounting,
finance, marketing, and gen-  goaege cg

eral management, the BSBA 

program gives students a full

range of options and also 

gears them towards attaining
the critical interpersonal and communication
skills necessary to be successful in a business
environment. A dual major with the College of
Arts and Sciences is also another option avail-
able to Pitt students.

Aside from the academic strength it
provides, the college of business administra-
tion also has a variety of extracurricular activ-
ities for students interested in seeing every
side of a business education. A Business
Student Council as well as a business fraterni-
ty are only two of the options to choose from.
Lastly, a multitude of internship opportunities
for a more hands-on experience are readily
available to students to help them form bonds
with major nearby corporations and business
environments.

A great part of education is learning how to
work with other people as a team toward a
common goal. Student organizations have
always been vital in the life of the University.
Some organi-

 zations began

g in the last

century. Traditions may change; there no longer

is a
Temperance  et
Club or a 8

Dandies’ Club, as there were earlier in the cen-
tury. Other groups arise in time for the next
century, such as the Comic Book & Anime Club
and the Ultimate Frisbee Club. But all of
today’s organizations are dedicated to giving
students a wide range of activities and enterpris-

es to help campus life ﬂourish.

A group of students spends many hours working
on the same goal - The Panther Prints yearbook.
The book was established in 1906 for the purpose
of creating a record for the University. Once called
The Owl, the University of Pittsburgh’s record book
became The Panther Prints in 1981.

This year, The Panther Prints had a staff consist-
ing of seven members. The staff members are
supported by different representatives from their
publishing company, their photography company,
and their University advisor, James Tynen.
According to Tynen, “Panther Prints continues to
persevere over the years in order to provide an
opportunity for students to remember big games
and good times.”

The book has had some difficulties surviving on
campus, due to a lack of interest on the part of the
student body. Karen Haller, this year’s editor-in-
chief, says that “yearbooks are hard to promote on
a campus such as this. The large number of stu-
dents attending Pitt tend to consider the yearbook

as a book with their picture, and then pictures of a
lot of people that they don’t know. What many
people do not understand is that we cover the
events that they went to, the sports teams that
they cheered for, and the places that they hung out
at. The book has come a long way since just
being a book filled with portraits.”

The staff makes various fundraising efforts in
order to gain publicity. Often, students are
unaware of the fact that there is a book available
on the campus. Sandy Watt, marketing consultant
for the book, has changed this. She makes the
book more accessible to all students, and pro-
motes it by posting flyers, setting up tables, and
doing mass mailings. According to Haller “Sandy
has done a remarkable job of letting me forget
about selling the book, and lets me focus on pro-
ducing a quality book. With this year’s staff, I am
confident that we will put out the best book that
this University has seen in a long time.”

The achievements of our predecessors and their inﬂu-
ence on our daily lives helps us to realize the value of

 

mm the Lantern ceremony for freshmen
women to the graduation ceremony, rituals I
have been part of the Pitt tradition. These

celebrations are formalities that many of the stu-
dents participate in in order to more fully appre-
ciate the value of tradition at the University.
Over the past 200 years, the students, faculty, and
staff have developed many ideals that have con-
tinued on to be considered traditions. Although
some yearly rituals are less formal, they are still
considered traditions. For example, every
semester begins with fraternity and sorority rush,
which involves endless hours of visiting houses,
meeting new friends, and making decisions.
Every fall, the Panther fans celebrate
Homecoming, which includes such festivities as
fireworks, laser shows, and of course, the foot-
ball game. Not only is this event exciting for
current students, but it also proves to be nostalgic
for Pitt alumni. During the holiday season, spec-
tators come from all around to see the decora-
tions in the Nationality Rooms on the first ﬂoor
of the Cathedral of Learning. This tradition cele-
brates the importance of diversity, existing at the
University of Pittsburgh. Some of these tradi-
tions were initiated by our predecessors, and have
been passed on over the years. Others began
more recently, and will most likely be carried on
for years to come. Pitt students tend to appreci-
ate the value of outstanding traditions and contin-
ue to pass them on as time goes by.

The American Chemical
Society-Student Affiliates is Pitt’s
undergraduate chemistry club.
Membership is open to all stu-
dents with an interest in chem-
istry and related fields. This year
they have over 70 members.
They host a wide variety of
speakers from academics and
industry at weekly meetings held
at 12 noon in 132 Chevron
Science Center. Speakers this
year have included Dr. Stricker
from the Department of
Neuroscience, Jeanne Christy
from Pre—Med Advising, The

Valspar Corporation, and
Duquesne’s School of Medicinal
Chemistry.

The ACS-SA sponsors two
volunteer outreach programs for
high school students each
semester. Saturday Science is a
program that gives basic chem-
istry lab experience to minority
students in a fun setting. ACS
members provide one-on-one
instruction during the experi-
ments. The Honors Organic pro-
gram allows outstanding high
school students to learn about
organic chemistry. The students
attend a series of lectures by their
advisor, Dr. George Bandik, and

then perform actual organic
chemistry labs under the supervi-
sion of ACS members.

In addition to weekly meet-
ings and volunteer activities, the
ACS-SA also has a variety of
social events every year. For the
first time this year they had a
Halloween Pumpkin Painting
Party. On Friday the week before
Halloween, they met on the patio
behind Chevron Science Center
and decorated pumpkins. They
also had a belated post-vacation
party at George’s house on
February ninth. Every year they
go to a Pittsburgh Symphony
concert. Also, at the end of the
school year we have a field trip
and farewell dinner as a way of
saying goodbye to our graduating
members. This year they were at
Penn Brewery.

BELOW: Months after TWA Flight
800 exploded in midair in the sum-
mer of 1996, investigators were
still searching for a cause. The

Boeing 747 jumbo jet plunged into ~ g 3 

the Atlantic ocean off the coast of
Long Island, N.Y., just minutes
after taking off from Kennedy
Airport for Paris. All 230 people
on board were killed. The theories
ranged from a mechanical failure
to a bomb, from an exploded fuel
tank to a missile.

ABOVE LEFT: A deadly explosion
disrupted the Olympic Games. Just
as the Games were turning Atlanta
into a giddy metropolis overflowing
with tourists, a black-powder pipe
bomb packed with nails exploded in
the crowded Centennial Olympic
Park. One person died instantly,
and another died of a heart attack.
More than 100 people were injured.

ABOVE: Shannon Lucid is a new
record holder. The 53-year-old
shuttle astronaut veteran set the
women’s record for consecutive
days in orbit, 188, beating Russian
cosmonaut Elena Kondakova. She
also amassed 223 days in orbit
since 1995, making her America’s
most experienced astronaut.

more votes than any other independent Presidential

LEFT: The stock market surged to record highs as
the school year began. It was a continuation of
one of the greatest bull markets in history. The
Dow Jones industrial average hit record highs in
late September, and closed over 6,000 in October.
The spark that kept the markets moving upward
was news that suggested that the economy was
slowing down, thus keeping interest rates low.

BELOW: Hillary Rodham Clinton shied away from
confrontation. The 48-year-old First Lady champi-
oned the massive health-care reform plan, but it
never became a law. Nevertheless, Mrs. Clinton
pushed ahead and had a long history of work on

children’s issues. She buried the image of a
super-activist First Lady, and became a model of
traditional political spousehood.

TOP: A R&B pop singer named Toni
Braxton hit the charts about three
years ago and hasn’t left since. Her
latest hit album, “Secrets”, blends her
rich, smooth voice with a versatility
that continues to grow with each new
hit. “Secrets” has the firepower to
carry Toni to the top.

RIGHT: Three years ago, Jewel was
a fledgling singe—songwriter living on
carrots and peanut butter sandwich-
es. Now, the 22-year-old performer is
a smashing success. Her debut
album, “Pieces of You,” just went plat-
inum. Jewel sings many of the songs
on the album in a crystalline voice,
while playing her acoustic guitar.

BELOW: George Strait began
recording hit songs 25 years
ago and he’s still at it. Every
one of his more than 20 albums
for MCA records went at least
gold, and his total sales are
now at about 30 million albums.
His latest hit, “Blue Clear Sky,”
is well on its way to gold sales.

ABOVE: Tracy Chapman was back on the charts
with her latest album “New Beginning.” As one crit-
ic wrote: “One thing Tracy Chapman has inevitably
gained over the years is polish. This new album is
simply impeccably orchestrated, tightly and
urbanely played. The songs are adorned with soft
jazz accompaniments.”

RIGHT: Hyped as the most popular British band
since the Beatles, Oasis is a million-selling rock
band that is about to begin work on its third album.
After abruptly cancelling a U.S. tour, they denied
reports that the group would split up. The group’s
first two albums have sold 20 million copies.

ABOVE Alanis Morissette has talent that seems
to know no limit. Her debut album, “Jagged Little
Pill,” attracted consider ble attention thanks to the
ht single “You Oughta Know,” a fiery, raphic rant
at a to mer boyfriend. Morrisette delive s the
deeply personal lyrics with a dramatic voice and a
dy amic rhythm. As one cri ic put it: “She lashes
out at her targets with a fury that makes her music
both invigorating and frightening.”

LEFT: Three years ago, Dave Matthews, a Sout
African who settled in Virginia as a teenager, put
together a quintet that became one of the biggest
draws on the concert circuit. The Dave Matthews
Band brought funk into the mainstream, as one
critic said. And non-traditional instruments, such
as the violin and the sax, expanded the band’s
sound and universal appeal.

Pitt Athletic Department Adapts to the Changes
Which Accompany a new Athletic Director

154 Sports

Pitt's tradition of athletic
excellence depends almost as
much on the men behind the
scenes as it does on the players
on the field and court. This is
especially true in the ’90s, as
sports became more competi-
tive than ever, and as financial
concerns became more urgent.

On Oct. 28, 1996, Steve
Pederson was introduced as the
new athletic director, succeed-
ing Oval Jaynes.

Pederson, 39, had most
recently been associate athletic
director at the University of
Nebraska. He had helped raise
20 million dollars for that pro-
gram, and had negotiated a
shoe contract, an essential in
today's go-go athletic world.

At his first press confer-
ence, Pederson said his goal
was to make Pitt again an ath-
letic powerhouse.

”We are going to set
grand plans to make this hap-

pen,” he said. ”I want to build
a program that will go into the
next century as one of the best
in the country.”

He made it clear that a
top priority would be to build
the much-talked—about convo-
cation center as a showcase for
sporting events, as well as for
other campus events.

He had also been recruit-
ing coordinator at Ohio State,
where he plainly had success in
helping to build up that pro-
gram.

Pederson had also been
recruiting coordinator for
Johnny Majors at Tennessee.

As the year went on,
Pederson moved to put the
University's athletic programs
on the fast track. After the res-
ignation of Johnny Majors,
Pederson hired Walt Harris as
the new football coach, and re-
organized the athletic depart-
ment.

There were ﬂashes of
hope during the season. The
team took Houston to overtime
before losing (as the new over-
time tiebreaker rule took effect.)

The win over Temple
was one of the most exciting
ever in the Stadium.

The game began with a
53-yard kickoff return by Hank
Poteat, and included for Pitt
alone a flea-ﬂicker, four 2-point
conversion attempts, a fullback
pass and an onside kick to open
the second half. Temple led 45-
27 and then 52-33.

Matt Lytle came off the
bench to throw three touch-
downs in less than nine min-
utes of the fourth quarter to
thrill the Stadium crowd with a

53-52 win.

The Panthers also beat
Kent State, and gutted out a
gritty win against Boston
College. In the latter game, two
interceptions by Rashaad
Whitmill were key.

The team also gave
Coach Iohnny Majors a going-
away present by beating
Rutgers 24-7. They held the
Scarlet Knights to only 9 points,
and a meager 219 yards in
offense. The running of
Dwayne Schulters, the passing
of Lytle and the receiving of
Jake Hoffart were key elements
in that game. The final win
gave the Panthers a decent 3-4
record in the conference, good
enough for fifth place.

She made 11 of 22 shots and
scored 25 points, far and away
the team's top scorer.

Melissa Thompson did
much of the scoring during the
year.

An injury to sophomore
guard Gina Montesano hurt the
team. She started off the year
well, averaging 20 points a
game in Big East competition.
She scored 27 and pulled down
8 rebounds against St. ]ohn’s.
But a knee injury early in
January ended her season, and
the team stumbled in the latter
part of the year.

Women's Soccer Team Breaks Boundaries

/4%ew5m

in Rookie Season at Pitt

A women's soccer team
was added this year to help
women's programs attain pari-
ty with men’s. The Lady
Panthers hope to achieve the
same tradition of excellence as
the men's teams have achieved.

Like all rookies, the soc-
cer team had a lot to learn.
They finished the season 3-15.
Megan Beasley and Mia Mora
were the team's top offensive
threats during the year. In the

final stats, the leading scorers
were Beasley with 12 points;
Mora with 10; and Tracy
Mascari with 9.

Coach Roland Sturk saw
progress throughout the year,
which mainly can be chalked
up as a learning experience.

”All year long our kids
have progressed both individu-
ally and collectively,” he told
The Pitt News. ” In some ways,
I'm very optimistic.”

Or do they? Seniors remember what campus was
like in their first year, and what has changed.

It's almost funny as you
actually dig through the
cobwebs in your mind to
remember what was
going on when you
arrived at this fine insti-
tution. You were young
and eager then, not so
exhausted and eager (to
finish school, that is!!)

So let's see - what has
changed? Well, four years
ago Coach Majors led his
men through the intro-
duction year with three
wins, claiming that they
could move ”Back to the
Future” (their theme) and
begin winning national

titles. Paul Evans was
unknowingly entering
his last year as Pitt's
basketball coach, and
we had not yet seen the
arrival of the Pitt Dance
Team.

Chancellor Dennis
O'Connor had just fin-
ished renovations on his
office and home and
was ready to begin
them on the University.
As far as Oakland went,
Zelda's was still the
place to go for a drink if
you weren't yet -21.

Transportation was
more accessible to stu-

four years ago as it is
now, and very few peo-
ple had even heard of
the World Wid Web.
Oh, what four years

Life brings about different challenges and new
opportunities every day, but one thing that

remains the same is

 

n important part of the University of
Pittsburgh is the change that occurs here
every day. In our academic endeavors, our

cultural surroundings, or our social gatherings,
change is ever-present. Technology has dominat-
ed the teaching methods used in the classroom by
utilizing computer-based resources. Today, there
is a greater appreciation for ﬁne and performing
arts, and the signiﬁcance of individuality plays a
greater role in society. Socially, we have gone
from meeting for a milkshake at the diner to surf-
ing the web on our laptops at a local coffee shop.
Change has deﬁnitely taken place, and the nine-
teen-nineties are simply the gateway for more
advanced means of living.

At Pitt, students have realized the value of
transition as the years pass. For example, within
the last few years, the use of computer technology
has been stressed in more and more classes.
Today, students are required to research subjects
on the World Wide Web, rather than simply look-
ing in the books at the libraries. Other changes at
Pitt include the reformatting of Bigelow
Boulevard, the installation of a new chancellor,
and, most importantly, the signiﬁcance of the edu-
cation that students are receiving here.

The greatest of traditions at Pitt is that of transi-
tion. The great traditions of study, friendship,
service and learning give rise to new traditions,
new ways of moving forward. Study brings

forth new

  ideas and
new discov-

eries; friendships and service to the community

open doors

friendship

and service. Yet the new discoveries only
highlight the greatness of the traditions. The
clothes may change, the fads will come and go,
the faces will change. Yet that change will fuel
the bonds that make the traditions work.
However much Pitt may change, it will remain

in our hearts forever.

these things have

On Friday, October 4, 1996,
ﬁreworks lit up the sky to begin
the Homecoming festivities.
Hundreds gathered on Bigelow
and the William Pitt Union
lawn to see the event and to
show their school spirit. The
show, which included laser
lights and Star Wars music, was
out of this world. Freshman AJ
Rodgers, who was attending her
first homecoming at Pitt, said
she “liked the way the Cathedral
exploded.” The ﬁreworks that
shot from the top of the
Cathedral did start off the week-
end with a bang. Senior James
Sanders agreed, saying that it
was “an awe inspiring experi-
ence.” However, the ﬁreworks
were just the beginning of the
weekend filled with fun activi-
ties.

After the show, the festivities
continued in the William Pitt
Union Ballroom where the Pitt
dance team led the crowd. All
the students, faculty, and alumni
who attended enjoyed refresh-
ments, dancing, and other activ-

ities.

The spirit from Friday carried
over into Saturday’s big game.
The Pitt Panthers were victori-
ous over the Temple Owls by a
close 53-52 score. The game
had many exciting twists and
turns which kept the fans on
their feet, and the rocking Pitt
Band and representatives from
each of the Greek houses kept
the spirits high.

After the game, students and
alunmi celebrated at the Greek
alumni party hosted by Kerry
Daley. Everyone celebrated the
Panther’s win with food and
laughter. Daley said,
“Homecoming at Pitt is a great
experience for Greeks because
it’s the time when many return.”

Indeed, homecoming at Pitt
is a special time. From the fire-
works on Fridays to the last
party of the weekend, the stu-
dents, faculty, and alumni get to
share a moment to recall past
memories, and to form new
ones together.

At half time, the suspense was building
about who would be the 1996 King and
Queen.

All the members of the court were excit—
ed to be there. Tom Ablauf said he enjoyed
being on court because “'it’s a nice way to
represent the students and traditions that go
along with it.” 7

Half time was also a special
moment for the 1976

It’s that time of year
for students to return to the
campus. For some, it is excit-
ing and full of new experi-
ences. For others it can be
very scary as well as a pain.
Whether you are moving into
a dorm or into an apartment,
moving back usually means
endless streets of traﬂic, thou-
sands of fonns to ﬁll out, and
lines beyond those at any
amusement park.

The exciting part
about coming back is seeing
old friends and making new
ones. Marianne Nazzaro says
“I like to see old friends, but
moving back can be a real
pain. For the most part,
though, returning is a fun
time to reunite with an old
roommate or an old ﬂame!”

However, for some
students, returning to the
University can be a scary
time, especially for freshman.
It takes a lot of adjusting to
the new surroundings and
curriculum. College life is

very different from high
school.

College life is a lot of
responsibility. It requires
remembering to set the alarm,
getting yourself up and to
class, and ﬁnding food.

The term begins with
Freshman Orientation. Here
many of the freshman get
their ﬁrst taste of college life.
There is the traditional
Lantern Night Ceremony to
welcome the freshman
women and Panther Night to
welcome the freshman men.

The week is ﬁlled
with many events such as
volleyball tournaments and
“The Dating Game” to help
provide a fun-ﬁlled way to
make friends in a strange,
new place. All in all, the ﬁrst
week back is fun, yet difﬁcult
week of adjusting.

For many people, the
dorms are their ﬁrst attempts
of life on their own. Learning
to deal with the hassels of
paying your own phone bills
and getting along with your
roommates. Though most
students eventually opt to go
out into the area and ﬁnd their
own apanments, the dorms
can provide housing straight
through the college years.

“Many of the people you
live with become the people
you hang out with,” said
Yessenia Novak, Freshman.
“When you ﬁrst get to school,
these are the ﬁrst people you
meet. Hopefully, you get
along with them. I didn’t
know how my roommate and
myself would get along at
ﬁrst, but you learn to live with
the things you don’t like.”

The dorms offer high
security to students with both
the security guard at the
entrance to the dorm, and the
individual key locks on the
door to the rooms.

The range of room selec-
tion varies both in the type of
room and the number of
occupants. The Towers offer
students the bare necessities
with single and double
rooms, whereas Sutherland
offers suites with private bath-
rooms.

The advantage of living in
the dorms is their proximity
to campus buildings and
classes. Often times, the resi-
dent advisors plan activities
that unite the ﬂoor, such as an
ice cream social.

Every year the Ofﬁce of
Student Activities sponsors
the Freshman Activities Fair
in order to familiarize the new
students with the numerous
student organizations and
activities that are on and off
campus. This year, 250
organizations gathered in the
Forbes Quad Galleria to par-
ticipate in the Activities Fair.

The fair is an excellent
opportunity for representa-
tives from each of the student
organizations to give informa-
tion and recruit new mem-
bers. It is also a great place
for freshman to become more
acquainted with the numerous
organizations. Students are
given a chance to explore
their ﬁeld of interest, and to
become more active in the
University of Pittsburgh.

RIGHT: One of
the groups
which promot-
ed themselves
at the fair was
the ASA.

Many groups
find the fair the
best time to
gather new
members.

 

For the most part, the fair
is designed for freshmen.
However, all of the students
beneﬁt from it. Junior Jeff
Jones said that “the Activities
Fair is a great opportunity for
students to meet new people.”
Upperclassmen as well as
freshmen beneﬁt from this
event.

Besides all the organiza-
tion booths setup, there are
performances by numerous
choirs and dance clubs. Also,
there is a lot of free informa-
tion and demonstrations.

Overall, the Activities Fair
is a traditional, fun part of the
year that helps students
become a part of the Pitt
atmosphere.

Pittsburgh, the city of bridges, is one
of the fastest growing cities. Named in
the top ten most livable cities, Pittsburgh
is seen as a cultural and business center.

Although the city was once known as
the steel capital of the world, most facto-
ries left the area. Despite this,
Pittsburgh has remained a thriving city
with many prosperous endeavors.

Many students who are not from
Pittsburgh soon ﬁnd that the people in
the area are extremely friendly. They
have even developed their own dialect,
sometimes called Pittsburghese. As with
any native dialect, outsiders ﬁnd certain
words or expressions upsetting. With
Pittsburgh’s universities attracting peo-
ple from all over, who hasn’t heard the
battle over whether a can of Coke is a
can of pop or a can of soda?

Pittsburgh is also the city of champi-
ons. It was given this name after the
success of Steelers, Pirates, and
Penguins. With the campus being so
close, the student discounts on tickets are
sizable, and many students enjoy to go
out to a game every so often.

Pittsburgh’s other attractions include
amusement parks like Kennywood and
Sandcastle, the Pittsburgh Zoo, the
Carnegie Museum, and Phipps
Conservatory. Together they make
Pittsburgh an exciting home to all.

All Hallows Eve, a
night of ghosts and gob-
lins and practical jokes on
that friend of yours who’s
just a little too scared of
the dark. It’s a night to be
whoever (or whatever)
you’ve always wanted to
be.

Starting out as the
night the souls of the dead
were free to roam the
world, Halloween has
become another opportuni-
ty for candy distributors to
rack in the money.
However, sugar highs are
only one aspect of the
spooky evening.

“I love Halloween
because it never matters
what you look like, as
long as you’re having a
great time,” said junior
Justin Sresol.

In college, Halloween
takes on a new meaning.

RIGHT: The
night brings
out the fun in
all of us.
When else
could you find
a gangster, a
Canadian
Mountie, a
member of the
Village People,
and a drag
queen hanging
out together?

 

   

It’s no longer running
around seeing who can fill
their pillow case the high-
est with bite size candy,
even though some stores
will give out a snack to
people dressed up. In the
mature world of college,
your costume becomes
your pass to the various
college parties.

This year, Halloween
fell upon Pitt’s football
game against Boston
College. Fans came to
cheer with their costumes
specially designed to boost
spirit. Even the cheerlead-
ers traded in their pom-
poms for Minnie Mouse
ears.

Students who can’t
afford to run out and buy
the latest costume will
cross-dress or wear those
clothes they bought on
sale at K—mart.

Take a break, put down the

books, and hit the stores. Yes,
shopping is a great way to
relieve the tensions of college.
It doesn’t matter whether you
need to pick up a new outﬁt
for the party or you would
like to surprise someone with
a present. Shopping is a fun
activity for whatever reason.

Sometimes, shopping can
be a hassle, like at Christrnas-
time. But, it is fun to check
out the new styles.

The Pitt Program Council
has even started the new mall
shuttle. Every Saturday the
shuttle goes to either Ross
Park or Century III Mall,
dropping off and picking up
students. This makes shop-
ping even more convenient.
All you bargain hunters can
head to one of the local malls
in search of the perfect item.

"Ihere are more choices
here than back at home,” said
freshman Kris Rost.

If you’re not into the mall
scenes, a quick bus ride
downtown will take you to

  

many individual stores.

So, you have no excuse
not to shop. Short on money,
you say...well, just open a
credit card at the many tables
around campus and charge
it!

Vendors are always on
campus trying to sell you
something. Sometimes it is
better not to buy, if you think
it may be a fraud. The free T-
shirt or candy bar wouldn’t be
worth it. However, most of
the vendors’ deals are worry-
free, and a great way to pick
up that special something
you’ve been looking for.

Shopping isn’t just for
clothes and food. Often
times, many students get a
tattoo or piercing when start-
ing off on their own. “It’s a
great rush. You’re doing
something that’s not bad, but
that you would never do if at
home,” said Freshman
Bridget Fisher.

It’s the night before the big
test. Are you ready? Did you
review your notes, call your
lab partner, stock up on soda
and chips? There’s so much to
remember. And, oh yeah,
where did you put that twelve
page paper that is due at nine-
thirty in the morning?

Does this sound familiar?
Are you plagued with this type
of stress at least once a week.
Well, if so, join the club.
Stress is about as much a part
of college as fraternity parties
and ﬁnancial woes. Many stu-
dents think that stress can be a
direct result of procrastination.
This is most likely true. Many
students tend to delay the big
projects until the last minute,
thus resulting in a tight situa-
tion.

On the other hand, stress is
sometimes the result of just
too much work Many stu-
dents feel that professors can
be too difficult, and can tend to
assume that their class is the
most important. But, when
the student has a full course
load of professors who want

their class to be the top priori-
ty, the result is usually the feel-
ing of the weight of the world
on one’s shoulders.

As a result of stress, students
often tum to different means to
cope. Smoking is all too com-
mon among college students,
as is drinking. Although many
students ﬁnd these ways as a
means to relax, some are satis-
ﬁed just relaxing in front of the
TV, or calling a friend to take
their mind off their worries.
According to one Pitt student,.
“When things get too rough, I
sneak away to my boyfriend’s
apartment, where no one can
call me or bother me, and I can
relax for a while before worry-
ing about my homewor .”

However you cope with it,
stress is a fact of life on carn-
pus. Just remember, when
you’re ten minutes late for a
test, it’s not the end of the
world. Although things seem
important enough to stress us
out, we’ll look back in ten
years and laugh at how we
worried about such small
problems.

But after all the parties
and the the skipping classes
and the studying, there
comes  the final exam.

Some students have all
their notes outlined and high-
lighted and annotated. They
have read every assignment,
and even the recommended
reading. They have talked to
the professor after class and
thought about the issues
raised.

Then there’s everyone
else. You can find them in
Hillman Library, trying to
cram three months of work
into one night. Or you can
find them at a coffee shop,
chug-a-lugging double
espressos and reading text-
books frantically.

There are many kinds of
final exam: open book, take-
home, multiple choice, essay.
All hold their own terrors for
the unaware student.

The take—home final
allows you to work on it as
much as you want. But how
much is that? And how much
is everyone else doing? At
least if the final takes place
in the classroom, you have as

much time as everyone else
to do the work, and don’t
have to worry about some
geek staying up five days
straight to hand in the
world’s greatest take—home
exam, and blowing the whole
curve.

A final in the classroom,
however, has its own perils.
Who has not felt the dread of
getting the test and finding
out that it is entirely based
on the one lecture you
skipped because (really and
truly) you had a fever of 104
and didn’t want to spread
your germs to the rest of the
class.

The ideal, of course, is no
final. Professors who disdain
the final exam are to be com-
mended as the most brilliant
and noble of their kind.

Then, however, the whole
grade hinges on the term
paper. Then you will find
yourself in Hillman Library,
cursing as you wait for a
computer to become avail-
able, because you are trying
to cram three months of
work on your term paper into
one night.

Throughout the year students
are faced with many challenges.
We have to pick a major, which
usually changes every other
semester, we choose our housing
facilities, roommates and classes.
But eveiy semester brings us the
biggest challenge of our non-
scholastic requirements : dating!
The dating ritual is a complex
series of body language, sending
out verbal “feelers”, blind dates
by well-intentioned friends and
just plain luck. Where do you go
to ﬁnd your soulmate? Our cam-
pus provides many “hot—spots” in
our endless quest for a signiﬁcant
other. Some of the favorite cruis-
ing areas include our local water-
ing holes. The Attic, Fuel and
Fuddle, Peters Pub, C.J. Barneys,
Thirstys and Mitchells are only a
few of the local taverns that may
open up conversations with the
opposite sex, especially after a
few a drink specials to subside

 

your nervousness of meeting a
“perfect” stranger. Some students
are more comfortable in quieter
surroundings. The Union lawn,
laundry rooms, Schenley Park,
the museum and even the class-
rooms themselves can offer
ample opportunities in your quest
for a special someone. Kris
Kissel, a Junior explains that
“dating reminds me of skipping
classes: it gets easier as you go
along.” Some students come to
college just to look for a spouse.
While these students are far and
few between, a lot of our class-
mates do ﬁnd the love of their life
without even meaning to look for
them. Dating is a fundamental
activity in the collegiate scene, it
may be harder than getting and
keeping that high GPA , but the
rewards for the effort can be one
of the most fulﬁlling things that
one can get out of their stay at the
university!

The Job Placement Center
on the 2nd Floor of the
Vifilliam Pitt Union is an
excellent way to ﬁnd your
perfect career. Mostly seniors
go to the ofﬁce for help in
resume writing or counseling
for different career areas.
Some go for job outlooks or
even for job applications.

The Job Placement Center
is designed to help students
enter the job market. Director
Bob Perkoski says “each job
search is unique. And
because there are many ways
of ﬁnding your ﬁrst job,
we’ve put together a variety
of services to help you.”

Indeed, the job center can
help because they know
employers and what they are
looking for. The Placement
Center works hand in hand
with a majority of large
employers. Their on—campus
interview program includes
local, state, and national
employers. They will even
send your resume to employ-

ers who ask for Pitt graduates.

If you have problems with
your resume, they offer pro-
grams to teach you how to
write one, as well as offer
workshops for someone to
review and help you ﬁx your
resume.

Also, the Placement
Center can teach you how to
interview. They even offer
mock interviews to help you
practice talking with employ-
ers.

The Placement Center is
always willing to help. They
have walk—in advising, job
listings, and career counsel-
ing. Also, they work with the
Career Counseling Center on
the 3rd ﬂoor of the VV1lliam
Pitt Union, and the Internship
Office in 140 Thackeray.
Together, they work to offer
Pitt students job experience
and skills which are useful in
ﬁnding a permanent job after
graduation.

This fall was an election
time again. For some stu-
dents, it was their ﬁrst time at
the Voting booths. For others,
it was just another election.
But, for candidates, the stu-
dents’ votes can make a differ-
ence.

The most publicized run-
ning was the presidential
campaign. President Bill
Clinton and Vice President Al
Gore were running for re—elec-
tion. The opposition was
Republican Senator Bob Dole
and his running mate Jack
Kemp.

MTV was a big part ofthe
presidential race. They came
to the university in September
to raise the issues being debat-
ed, while also listening to stu-
dents’ concerns. The MTV
Choose or Lose Bus became a
forum for students to voice
their opinions on a national
level.

One of the major concerns
was Do1e’s attack on President
Clinton’s use of drugs. Many
students believed that the drug
issue was not as important as
Dole and Kemp made it out to
be and that they needed to
spend more time on their plat-
form, rather than attacking his
opponent.

This was an important point
to a lot of campaigns.
Sophomore Adam Scott stated
“it has become common prac-
tice to bring down opponents
by scandals. Instead, they
should debating real issues
that affect real people.”

But, scandals weren’t the
only issues MTV discussed.
They also encouraged the
students to register to vote.
Students had to “Choose or
Lose” their right to voice an
opinion. After all, one person
can make a diﬁerence if they
rock the vote.

held at Soldiers and Sailors hall.
Each group prepared for weeks
in advance to perform the show.
The winners of the Greek Sing
were Delta, Delta, Delta, Phi

Sunday, everyone headed
down to Metropol to show off
their grinding skills at the Dance

brothers and sisters danced till
the music stopped, in hopes of
not stepping on each others toes.

The week ended in a formal.
There each ﬁaternity and sorori-
ty were honored with awards for

 

their efforts during the week
long competition. The most
prestigious was the Cathedral
Award which was given to
Sigma Chi and to Delta Delta

Pittsburgh not only is a
diverse city, but it also offers
a wide variety of foods. Pitt
students have many choices
when it comes to where and
what to eat.

Where usually depends on
how much time one has. Fast
food restaurants are on every
comer. Also, there are cafes
and restaurants. A few of the
popular hangouts are C.J.
Ba1ney’s, Fuel and Fuddle,
Hemingway’s, the BeeHive,
Uncle Sam’s, and Primanti’s.
Pitt has numerous cafeterias
all around campus like the
Schenley Cafe, Eddies, and
Second Plate.

One doesn’t even have to
leave the comforts of their
room. They can just order
pizza from one of the many
pizzerias in the area.

There are as many types

of foods as there are places to
eat. Pittsburgh is known for
the Primanti sandwich with
coleslaw and ﬂies on it. Also,
“O” ﬁies become a part of
every Pitt student’s vocabu-
lary.

Food is always big on
campus and they even found
a new way to get it.

Although Choice Dollars
have been accepted around
Oakland for a few years,
Campus Funds were intro-
duced this year. With just one
swipe, one can pay for food
with blocks or choice dollars.
Most of the restaurants and
local convenience stores
accept them. So, whether
you are starving for a break
from homework, or you just
want to hang out with friends,
go to the nearest food
place...and mangia!

Living away from home is
an eye—opening experience in
itself, but when you pile the
tons of responsibilities that
come with renting an apart-
ment on top of that, you can
get to be a bit overwhelmed.
From paying the electric bill to
making sure that you actually
have food to eat, apartment
living introduces a whole
world of new responsibilities.

Around campus, students
normally live in neighbor-
hoods such as South Oakland,
North Oakland, Shadyside,
and Squirrel Hill. Although
South Oakland is a pretty sure
bet for an inexpensive apart-
ment, you can also expect to
live in an area that is not as
well-maintained as the other
three mentioned. However,
students frequently rent in
South Oakland simply for the
convenience of walking to
class. Shadyside and Squirrel
Hill are more prominent
neighborhoods, and, as a

result, rent is much higher. Of
course, living in places such as
these, one must consider the
inconvenience of public trans-
portation, which tends to be
crowded and, unfortunately,
rL1ns too sporadically.

North Oakland is a good bet
for students attending Pitt,
because it can be less expen-
sive, but it is still close.
Overwhelming demands for
living quarters have pushed
rent prices through the roof.
As a result, many students
share apartments with two or
three other people. Even
though this lowers the rent,
added responsibility can put a
strain on roommate relations.
Junior Erin Morley says that
although “living off-campus
gives students a chance to
experience real—life responsi-
bilities like paying bills and
washing dishes, it can cause
problems, especially if you
have a different idea of ‘clean’
than your roommate has.”

Every day many students
slowly trek into the Oakland
area. The late sleepers spend
most of their mornings in tur-
tle speed trafﬁc. Most people
kill the time by listening to
their favorite radio station or
by counting how many pot-
holes they have encountered
on their way to school.
However, most early birds can
beat the trafﬁc into town and
secure a parking space.

Yes, commuting has its
advantages. It is a great way
to save money. Living at
home means Mom does the
laundry, cleaning and cook-
ing. Also, after a long day of
classes, it is great to sleep in
one’s own bed. For those who
need to study in total peace
and quiet, it is great not to
have the loud noises often
associated with dorm life.
Also, commuters do not risk
having the roommate from
hell.

However, commuting also

has many disadvantages. Not
only do commuters have to
ﬁght the traffic, but they also
have to scour the streets for
limited parking. This means
searching, sometimes for
hours, for a place to park the
car in hopes of avoiding a
ticket.

Still others commute by
bus. This may mean a long,
cold wait in the winter.
Freshman Jaime Ross said
“commuting by bus is better
than trying to ﬁnd a parking
space, but it can be really bad
in the winter. Sometimes the
buses are so crowded.”

There are other ways of get-
ting around in Oakland.
Bicycles, ridesharing, and the
shuttle systems are increasing
in popularity. The Parking
and Transportation Office
offers a lot of alternatives for
commuters.

Commuting has its ups and
downs. But, for many Pitt stu-
dents, it’s a way of life.

RIGHT:
Searching for
the perfect
parking takes
a long time,
and so does
crossing the
streets.

On September 16, 1996, Pitt’s
Department of Transportation, in
conjunction with the City of
Pittsburgh, blocked off part of
Bigelow Boulevard between
Forbes and Fifth Ave for thirty
days. This area between the
Cathedral of Learning and the
VV1lliam Pitt Union is one of the
busiest pedestrian intersections
on campus. The closing was
designed to facilitate the cross-
ing of Bigelow for students and
faculty. The temporary closing
was also used to show the need
for a permanent closing.
However, some members of the
community argue that the clos-
ing would eliminate necessary
parking and draw regular con-
sumers away from Oal<land’s
businesses on Forbes and Fifth
Ave as well as Craig Street.

One of the arguments for the
closing was that it would create a
safer environment for the
University community. The con-
gestion of trafﬁc was hazardous
to pedestrians who are usually in
a hurry to get to class on time.

RIGHT:
Students take
full advantage
of the empty
street to enjoy
lunch on the
double yellow
line. Others
had used this
area for street
hockey, since
many of the
other streets
are too trav-
eled by cars.

 

However, City Councilman Jim
Ferlo, along with local business
owners and residents argued that
the University and the City had
not sufficiently proven that this
block of Bigelow was unsafe.
They did not provide the evi-
dence needed for the closing.

The University proposed a
ten—year program to beautify
campus. They said that by clos-
ing Bigelow they could create a
university environment and stu-
dent unity through symbolically
linking the academic center to its
center for student activities. It
would be replaced by a lawn
where students can relax and
recess before and after classes.
Students say that the absence of
traffic during the test closing cre-
ated a very relaxed atmosphere.
A compromise was created: this
portion of the road will be nar-
rowed from ﬁve lanes to two
while expanding the lawns on
either side.

opening of Bigelow in a peaceful demonstration.

 other related

areas. This

type of education is an attribute that many corpo-

Built to symbolize power, achievement,
and the eternal quest for knowledge, the
Cathedral of Learning is not only a landmark,
but also a source of inspiration for all of
Pittsburgh. Completed in 1937, the 535-foot
Gothic building represents

seventeen years of planning,   ¢Z gig

fund-raising, and building

headed by the University of 
Pittsburgh's tenth chancellor,
Dr. John Gabbert Bowman.
As the trademark for the University, the
Cathedral embodies the academic path each

student and faculty member takes to be one
step closer to completing the quest for knowl-
edge. Its beauty and elegance truly make a
statement towards the enriching fulfillment
which can be achieved through motivated
ambition for and a sincere interest in gaining
knowledge. Through the upcoming years, as
the University changes to deal with the transi-
tions of time, the Cathedral of Learning will
symbolize the traditions which will always

remain.

As a result of the extensive costs of
financing a college education, the
University of Pittsburgh has instituted a
Federal Work Study Program to assist stu-
dents since 1964. Giving

students opportunities to

not only hold part-time 

jobs, but also to build their
resumes and enhance their 5

majors, the program is uti-

lized by thousands of stu-
dents at the university.

Offering over 1000 opportunities
both on campus and off, students can work
in a variety of positions including clerical,
research, computer, child care, or even stu-
dent recruitment positions.

Along with the financial and acade-
mic advantages, work study enables stu-
dents to work around their academic
schedules and learn time management —— a
valuable and necessary tool used all
throughout life.

many students is to find the right type of job to
utilize and enhance their individual talents.
However, many students realize a little too
late that pre—graduation job experience is a

vital necessity on any resume.

For many, one of the key 

ways to attain that job experi-
ence is by finding internships

related to their field of study. 

Through the Various

concentrated colleges and
through the placement office, students can
find hundreds of internship opportunities to
not only help them gain experience, but also to
enhance their present studies. The general
saying ”Your internship should help you in
your studies, and your studies should help
you in your internship” epitomizes this circu-
lar type of connection and rings true for many
students who earn academic credits through
internships.

Internship opportunities are available
in 140 Thackeray Hall.

Established in 1986 to enhance the
University Honors Program, the University
Honors College is designed to give Pitt's most
talented and motivated students the opportuni-
ty of greater challenge. ”This is accomplished
through four basic emphases: formal course-
work, special advising, academic community,
and the option to pursue a unique baccalaureate
degree.” A myriad of specially designed courses

exist which offer personal
attention, challenging ée .
coursework and small
class sizes. However,

since most UHC courses 

are not extremely special-

 
 
  
 
  
   
 

  
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
   
  
  
  
  
 
  
  
  

ized, many students can
have the chance to take
solid, stimulating introductory courses in the
humanities, social sciences, and the natural sci-
ences. 

In addition to special coursework, UHC
also offers a variety of special opportunities
including the Student Honors Activities
Community (SHAC) which is composed of stu-
dents who take UHC courses and who plan co-
curricular activities. The Pittsburgh
Undergraduate Review (PUR) enables students
to publish intellectually stimulating and schol-
arly essays. Lastly, Phi Beta Kappa is a national
collegiate honorary society which recognizes
students who have attained academic excel-

The University has maintained its
standing as a top college. Its afiliated
hospitals remain among the best in the
world in advanced procedures. For
example, the faculty at the School of
Medicine have developed a software
program that is considered by many to
be the largest and most comprehensive
medical diagnostic decision support sys-
tem in the nation.

There are many other top-ranked
programs, from philosophy to chemical
engeineering.

The Metallurgic Engineering grad
program is sixth ranked nationally, and
its undergrad program is ranked 11th.

The School of Engineering
received a National Security Education
grant to fund a study in China. Pitt is the
only institution to ever receive a second
NSEP grant.

In a study measuring per capita
faculty research productivity, Pitt was
ranked 25th in the nation and was called
a ”rising star” in this area.

 

The Hillman Library is just one of the
many libraries on campus. As the central
library, it is a favorite spot for research, study,
or sometimes just finding a good book.

The Library is not just a place for
books, but in this high-tech era is a place to
garner knowledge from all over the world.

A student can sit down in the library
and be connected to a myriad of electronic
information—gathering sources. The latest
research papers or journals can be found in a
matter of moments.

The other University
Libraries also provide much infor-
mation for research and study. These
include the African American
Library in Hillman, the Allegheny _g 
Observatory, the Biological Science
and Psychology Library, the Buhl
Library of Social Work, the Business Library,
the Chemistry Library, the Computer Science
Library, Darlington Memorial Library, the
East Asian Library, the Economics Library, the
Falk Library, the Fine Arts Library, the
GSPIA/ Economics Library, the Information
Sciences Library, the Langley Library, the Law
Library, the Mathematics Library, the Music
Library, the Nursing Library, the Physics and
Geology and Planetary Sciences Library, and
the Western Psychiatric Institute and Clinic
Library.

The year saw the World Wide Web, the
Internet, and other computer phenomenon gain
even wide acceptance. The Internet opened
sources of information all over the world to stu-
dents in Pittsburgh. The University expanded
its computer facilities vastly.

At the same time, stu-

dents became ever more
dependent on the machines. At
finals time, the lines in the com-
puter labs could be long and
frustrating.

Of course, there were
other advantages. ”My hard
drive crashed” replaced ”my
dog ate it” as an excuse. And e-
mail enabled students to keep in touch with
sweeties far away.

Change came ever faster in the world of
electronic communication. Cell phones prolifer-
ated; pagers became more common on campus.
Careers in computers remained a hot ticket, as
companies were seeking young people with
computer skills.

Some educators gave more thought to
”distance learning.” Computers, e-mail and the
Web might someday make it possible for stu-
dents to study at home, rather than come to a
common campus.

Higher education is not only books and
computers. Students must often work in labo-
ratories doing experiments to find out how
things work.

Learning is not just
reading books; it is also about 
encountering the truths of the

natural world.
It is a reminder that

college students are not just
passive recipients of information, but that they
take part in the University's mission of
expanding fields of knowledge and research.
