E present to you this volume of the

‘Owl.’ To the friends and to our

fellow students of the University

of Pittsburgh we extend this, our effort,

making no apologies nor asking any compli~ p

ments. Your help has been appreciated and
we trust this volume justiﬁes the conﬁdence
you have. placed in us. We have endeav»
ored to reﬂect a true likeness of our school
and its associations and by so doing give
pleasure to you.

Our labor has been pleasant and now
the end is here.

Pleasant thoughts of true fellowship
with college friends and faculty, now vivid
and seemingly indelible, will gradually fade
and pass. To preserve these memories for
future moments of enjoyment is the object

of this ‘The 1924 Owl.’

The Dental School has probably had a more rapid growth than any similar insti-
tution in the world.

It was founded April 20, 1896, under the name of the Pittsburgh Dental College, and
from the beginning was associated with the VVestern University of Pennsylvania.

For a period of six years it was located at 711 Penn avenue, when compelled by
rapid growth to move to Tenth and Penn. Next it was forced to go to Pride and Bluff
streets, and in 1912 moved to the University Campus in the Schenley Farms district and
occupied a building erected especially for it. This building, now known as the Upper
Dental Building, housed the school with increasing diFﬁculty each year until growing
enrollment and expanding clinic could no longer be accommodated. In the summer of
1920 the building of the Central Athletic Association was secured and the Inﬁrmary
was transferred thereto, and in 1922, an annex, giving an additional 2,500 feet of ﬂoor
space for the Inﬁrmary, was added. In the Inﬁrmary of the Upper Dental Building
there were 50 operating chairs, while the present Inﬁrmary Building has 200 chairs. The
frame building known as Arts Hall, just west of the Mellon Institute, was also turned
over to the Dental School in 1922, and is now utilized for two laboratories and two large
lecture rooms.

In 1904 the Board of Trustees was changed and in 1905 the control was turned
over entirely to the University.

In 1904 Dr. H. E. Friesell ‘became the Dean and has held this position ever since.
Under his guiding hand the school has advanced until it now is the largest dental
school in the world.

The Faculty has grown from 29 members in 1912 to 85 members in 1922-23. Of
this number 25 are full-time teachers and 25 are half-time.

In the past ten years the enrollment has grown from 165 to 786. For the past
eight years the school’sgState Board record is ninety-nine (99%) per cent. passed. The
school is noted throughout the dental profession for the great amount of individual
instruction it gives, which undoubtedly accounts for its position in the ﬁeld of dental
education.

All we ever see of Bernard are his stream-
ing coat-tails. He is constantly chasing
around the halls bent on some urgent errand.
But you should see him in an R. O. T. C.
uniform. He’s quite the “Shriek.”

WOODRUFF DESILVA E A E
Margaretville High School, N. Y.

There is unusually some reason why most

of us get along. Some of us work hard and

others have talents, but for “Woody,” no one
knows where he stands.

Alan is good and big and strong, but the

JULIUS DIAMONDSTONE

Latrobe need never worry about not being

Eich is always in a big hurry and is always
up to something. He has a cry that runs,
“Oh, for more hours in the day, and more
days in the week that I might get more
done.”

SAMUEL EVANS, JR.

Ambridge High School

Judging from the grades “Sam” makes,
you would wonder if his smile had not
“vamped" the teachers. But if you were to
hear him recite, you would know that it is
brains that gets them for him.

Meade took time out from his studies, just

“Mac” came all the way from New York to
honor Pitt with his presence. Girls," you

clear to the top of “Mac"s” manly brow,
when he gets up to recite in class.

A friend in need is a friend in deed, and
that is what “Scotty” plays to those of us

DUDLEY REID. MEREDITH

“Dud” is small and reserved you say and

nothing done.

CLARENCE B. METZGER

THE 024- OWL

Svmiur (Elana iﬁiatnrg

The spring of 1919 was an eventful part of an eventful year. Not only did the Peace
Conference meet at Versailles, but also from the high schools of the United States there
came forth, among others, about 750 young men and women who were to become the
members of a great University’s greatest class—Pitt’s Class of 1923. At that time
Pitt, along with every other University in the nation, was reorganizing and reconstructing
and getting back to normal after a war that had played havoc with colleges everywhere.
What could have been more fortunate, then, than the entry of ’23 with its Stabilizing
inﬂuence and constructive character at this time?

To trace the history of the class as it journeyed over four years of University life is
to record a story full of adventure and romance. We shall endeavor to set down some
of the adventure. In the first place, be it known that ’23 was not the easiest class in
the world for a body of digniﬁed Sophomores to handle. On the contrary, it has been
told with much truth that Just as much and possibly more Sophomore than Freshman
hair was planted on the campus during that year of skirmishes. Any member of the
class will take you on a personally conducted tour of the campus and indicate with
shining eyes and tremulous voice the various places on which these hectic contests once
raged. The above mentioned 750, however, soon found out their common interests and
the beginnings of that famous ’23 class organization were laid with the election of
Tom Holleran as President. And so, with uncanny quickness, the first year rolled around.

The fall of ’20 found the Class of ’23 on the alert for a means of establishing itself
in the Hall of Fame. A good way to start seemed to be by teaching the incoming
Freshmen something about class and university spirit. Accordingly, a fall offensive was
started with this in mind, and be it said t'hat the Class of ’24 will hardly soon forget the
details of this campaign. It was the most effective handling of a Freshman class the
University had seen in years. With this motive as a common goal, the Sophomores were
drawn together, and under the guidance of the new president, G. Dixon Shrum, a “class
platform” prepared by several members of the class and the president was adopted.
Under this organization, with John Ankeny as Secretary-Treasurer and. a newly organized
cabinet, the result was that ’23 became recognized as the leader of campus life. The
many “Tribunals,” noon-hour dances, class meetings and other informal activities will
live long in the memory of the class. A striking event was the famous Battle of State
Hall, the grandest inter-class scrap of them all, for a description of which see Pittsburgh
newspapers of the time. The Sophomore Hop, Emancipation Day, and the Sophomore
Banquet came and went, and time decreed that ‘Z3 should pass on to its Junior Year.

The Junior Ofﬁcers were Russel Stahlinan, President; Richard Holbrook, Vice-Presi-
dent; C. R. Foster, Jr., Secretary, and George I. Carson. Treasurer. By far the most
outstanding event of the many happy activities of this Junior Year was the Junior Prom.
unquestionably the most brilliant of all the Proms. Thornton McGovern was the chair-
man of this event. The Class also published a splendid “Owl,” under Joe Stone as
Editor and Chuck Fleming as Business Manager. During the Junior Year class friend-
ships became more solid, ties of companionship were rendered more binding and the
year with its kaleidoscopic events slipped rapidly by.

In its Senior year, the Class of ’23 finds itself still intact, still thriving and hopefully
regarding the future. The class called Tom Holleran to again become President, and
selected Hadyn Vaughn as Vice-President, Mary Zeigler as Secretary, and Walter Sturdy
as Treasurer. Another work was added to the list of ’23 achievements in the fall whep
the Senior Counselor Plan with its memorable banquet was successfully introduced as
a Pitt tradition under the New Student Committee of the “Y.” President Holleran
announced as the staff to handle the affairs of the Senior Year, in addition to the ofﬁcers,
Dick Holbrook, chairman of the Commencement Committee; Paul Walker, chairman of
the Social Committee; Charley Bowser, chairman of the Invitation Committee; Mary
Chapman, chairman of the Ring Committee: C. R. Foster, ]r., chairman of the Publicity
Committee; and Walter Sturdy, chairman of the Financial Committee.

As the “Owl” goes to press, these students are at work on a program of events
which it is believed will surpass anything heretofore attempted at the University by a
graduating class. Always the efforts of the Class of ’23 have been directed toward those
activities which will build up the glory and honor of Pitt, and if. after it has gone from
the University, it will be said of it that it was successful, those efforts will have been
worth-while. The hope of ’23 is that the classes which will follow it, may be inspired
by the same ideal to work with increasing love and devotion for the institution that has
been our common Alma Mater.

ﬁiatnrg nf the (Elana at‘ '25

The Class of 1925, whose intelligent faces will adorn the next issue of THE OWL,
made their advent at the University of Pittsburgh along with many changes in
that noble institution—a new administration, a new Alumni Hall, and a new regime
which enrolled all freshmen in one school, the College. Thus consolidated, the
class of ’25 organized promptly with Carl H. Sauers as president; Bertram Kenyon as

secretary; Milo Gwosden,’treasurer; and Francis Riley as vice—president. The oﬂicers
of the girls’ organization were: President, Elizabeth Watson; vice-president, Frances
Kocnisg; secretary-treasurer, Elizabeth Ziegler. Miss Margaret McClennahan was
chosen by the girls as class advisor.

In athletics the Class of ’25 was not lacking in prowess. Its football warriors came
gloriously through an undefeated season and were the guests of honor at a dance given
bv the class in the Knights of Columbus Hall on January 13, 1922. The Freshman
1nen’s basketball team, while not as fortunate as the eleven, had a very successful season
and showed promise of excellent varsity material. The girls’ team accomplished wonders
in its season and eight numerals were awarded to freshmen girls who had distinguished
themselves in this ﬁeld. .

Among the epoch-marking features of ’25’s first year at Pitt _was a general and
ofﬁcial recognition of girls’ major activities. For the first time in the history of the
University the varsity girls’ basketball team made a trip and for the ﬁrst time a track
meet was held by the girls._ A freshman, Julia Moorehead, won distinction at this meet
by breaking the world’s record for the 440-yard run. ‘

Social events‘ were not lacking in ’25’s history. Numerous noon—day dances were
held and on April 24 the girls of ’25 held Open House in the Heinz House for the beneﬁt
of the Y. W. C. A. The University’s social season was closed with the Emancipation
Dance given by the Class of 1925 on May 26, 1922.

Vice—president Francis Riley- guided and directed class affairs during the second
semester, for by this time President Sauers had attained the status of sophomore and
was declared ineligible for the ofﬁce. ‘

As Sophomores, the Class of ’25 showed the same spirit and enthusiasm which had
been characteristic of its career as freshmen. The class elected Harold Aikens as presi-
dent; Phil Githens, vice—president; Paul Clydesdale, secretary; and Raymond Nuttall,
treasurer. The girls’ organization had Margaret Porch as its leader; Jean Ballou, sub-
leader; Agnes Hewitt, scribe; and Stella Mulligan as the keeper of the money-bags.

True to tradition, ’25 was not reticent in initiating the in-coming Frosh. They
were ﬁrmly convincedithat if the freshmen were ever to make a mark for themselves it
was necessary that they go through this testing period. The freshmen were impressed
with the fact that the better theystood the test the better off they would be in the end.
Those who failed were allowed the privilege of providing the University with unique
entertainment. It was surprising how much latent talent ’26 had in way of aesthetic
dancing, vocalizing and the gentle art of love—making. How nobly they wore the dinks
and verdant bands! How digniﬁed they were under the stress of unwelcome hair-cuts
and weird wearing apparel! Emancipation Day, held late in the spring, was a ﬁtting
climax to the frosh probation. ’2S magnanimously forgave all past sins and the freshmen,
decidedly chastened in spirit, ﬁnally came into their own.

With a view of encouraging activities and high scholastic standards among the
freshmen girls, a number of sophomores formed the Cwens, an honorary sophomore
organization for women. Dean Amos consented to act as ex—ofﬁcio advisor of the or-

ganization. Girls are elected to membership in Cwens at the close of their freshman year.
The outstanding social event of the sophomore year was the “Sophomore Hop,”

which was held in the Knights of Columbus Hall, March 9, 1923.

It's February the seventeenth,

And three o'clock in the morning.

I've just come home from the prom

And in my hand

I'm still clutching the blue suede

Tobacco pouch they gave me.

(Wonder if Oswald is gazing fondly at his card-case favor?)
We both agreed that it was a good party

So I guess it was.

Graff’s orchestra from Punxsutawney

Furnished the music. Even good old Methodists
Couldn't be blamed for backslidin’ to

Such harmonious strains.

The food was delicious and well served

(And there was enough for everyone!)

VVe cheerfully sacriﬁced comfort

For appearance’s sake, and froze

In the yellow cab. But when we arrived

At the scene of action, we thought

That we were at Palm Beach for the evening;
For the Schenley was scarcely recognizable

In its disguise. The chandeliers were decorated
With smilax and lovely ﬂowers,

And the orchestra was kept within the bounds
Of a green fence, covered with trailing vines.
Oswald and I promenaded, then we danced,
We watched Baby Andrews “do her stuff.”

VVe danced some more-—and then

We ate—and read the “Prom Pom.”

“Three o’clock in the Morning” we started home.
More shivering, freezing cold.

’N now I’ve divested myself of my ﬁnery

And am going to sleep

With my program under my pillow

So’s I can dream about the prom

And enjoy it all over again,

G'night.

Pan-Hellenic, the annual women's inter-fraternity formal brought forth the usual
large representation of co-eds from Pitt, and fraternity women from other schools, who
are at present in Pittsburgh. As is the custom, the ball was held at the Hotel Schenley
on the evening of April 13. The fact, that it was Friday the 13 either cast no gloom on
the party; or was dispelled by the music produced by the Collegiate Six.

Favors for the men were watch charms with the University seal in gold on a back-
ground of black enamel. Chi Omega was chairman of the affair, and was assisted by
Delta Zeta, Alpha Delta Pi, Pi Beta Phi, and Delta Delta Delta.

Evita Sigma iﬂhi

The Delta Sigma Phi Fraternity was founded at the College of the City of New
York in 1899. It is composed of forty active and ten alumni chapters distributed through-
out various parts of the country. The Fraternity has become international in scope
since the installation of a chapter at McGill University, Toronto, Canada.

The Pittsburgh Chapter was granted in 1916, the nucleus being the Alpha Omega
local of 1914. The ﬁrst Chapter house was located at 410 Morewood Avenue and existed

until the outbreak of the war in 1918, when the majority of the members entered the
service. At present the active Chapter consists of thirty-eight men and is located at
the corner of Center Avenue and Melwood Street.

Theta Chi Fraternity was founded at Norwich University, Northﬁeld, Vermont, on
April 10, 1856. Since that time the fraternity has followed a program of very conservative
extension and at present has 35 Chapters situated in every part of the country.

The present University of Pittsburgh Chapter of Theta Chi Fraternity was organ-
ized by a group of students of the School of Engineering in December, 1915, under the
name of Sigma Epsilon. The main purpose of this organization was to get together as
many non—fraternity men as possible, as well as to give the School of Engineering a
better representation in the University than had been the case previously. Under its
first constitution the organization was conﬁned to the School of Engineering. But as
time went on, in order to get a firmer foundation and a broader ﬁeld from which to
draw its members, it was found advisable for the best interests of the organization to
apply to a national Greek-letter fraternity for admission to their body. A petition was
drawn up, accordingly, and was sent to the Grand Chapter of Theta Chi Fraternity in
1917, and again in 1918. In the latter year the petition was approved and Sigma Epsilon
became Alpha Beta Chapter of Theta Chi, on May 24, 1919.

Kappa Nu

Kappa Nu Fraternity was organized November 12, l9ll, at the University of
Rochester, by six students seeking some way by which they 111igl1t inculcate in
each other a more fraternal spirit, both in a spiritual and a social sense. The purpose
at first was to have a strictly local fraternity, but the spirit and the groundwork of the
founders were so strong that soon it was decided to allow a branching out into other
ﬁelds, but with restrictions so severe that there was no danger of the formation of imma-
ture Chapters. The growth of Kappa Nu since that time has been rapid but deliberate.
There are now eighteen active Chapters, located at universities and colleges as far west
as the University of California and as far south as Tulane University in New Orleans.
The legislative program of Kappa Nu is in the hands of the General Assembly which
meets once a year in convention and which consists of two delegates from each Chapter.
Administrative affairs are in the hands of four national officers and a council of ten, who
are elected each year by the National Assembly.

In 1920, the Omega Kappa Fraternity existed at Pitt as a local organization. Early
the next year it petitioned and was admitted into Kappa Nu as Xi Chapter, and since
that time it has formed an integral part of the fraternal life at Pitt.

Gamma Sigma Olhaptrr

The Pi Lambda Phi fraternity was founded November, 1895, at Columbia University.
Progressive and democratic ideals. which prompted the organization of a non—sectarian
fraternity coupled with a plan of conservative expansion, has resulted in a small but
compact chain of brotherhood with Chapters at Yale, Corne1l,_ Columbia, New York
University, Lehigh, Stevens, Pennsylvania, Chicago. Michigan, VVest Virginia, McGill
Toronto, and Pittsburgh.

2

Gamma Sigma was granted a charte_r by the Pi Lambda Phi fraternity at the
University of Pittsburgh May 16, 1914. The growth of the Chapter has been remarkable.
Conservative selection of members brought fruit in a substantial way when in 1920 the
Chapter purchased its own home.

The same spirit which prompted the formation of this non-sectarian organization
was reflected in the activities of its founders and the Chapter as well as the fraternity
has always been among the leaders in scholarship, athletics and fellowship.

Last year the Chapter won the Fraternity Scholarship cup presented by Dean
Fetterman. as well as the National Scholarship plaque presented by the Executive
Council of the fraternity.

The Sigma Chi Fraternity was founded at Miami University, Oxford, Ohio, in 1855.
It grew steadily until the Civil \\'ar when fraternity and college life was paralized in
general. During the Civil \Var Sigma Chi had something that was unparalleled in the
Greek word, an active Chapter with the armies in the ﬁeld. After the war Sigma Chi
recovered quickly and continued her progress and expansion.

In l9()9 Beta Theta Chapter was installed at the University of Pittsburgh making
the oldest national non—professi0nal body on the campus. The young Chapter prospered
and soon took an active part in all school affairs.

Phi Epsilon Pi was founded in the year 1902 at the College of the City of New
York. Urged on by its progressive and democratic doctrines, its expansion was phenomi-
nal. In but a brief period it was ready to take an honored position in the fraternity world.
Recognizing no barriers to any race or creed, social or political station, it opens its door
to anyone who can measure up to its qualiﬁcations and standards; and today, Phi Epsilon
Pi enjoys the unique privilege of being the only national fraternity in the country n0n~
sectarian. Its aim is to promote an invisible comradeship that strives both to make the
individual less selﬁsh; and to develop the more inate of altruistic motives until the com-
mon welfare becomes a continual source of intellectual enjoyment.

Imbued with these very principles, Zeta Chapter of Phi Epsilon Pi was installed at
the University of Pittsburgh on December 26, 1913, and since then has left no stone
unturned in its earnest endeavors to help place Pitt where it deserves to be.

The beginning of a distinctl_v new epoch in women's educational life was marked by
the founding of Pi Beta Phi, the first national secret college society for women to be
modelled after the men's Greek letter fraternities. In April of l867, at Monmouth Col-
lege, Monmouth, Illinois, l2 women, students at the college, established the fraternity
under the Latin name of I. C. Sorosis. The following year, 1868, it having been decided
that the fraternity should be a national society, a second Chapter was established at
Iowa, VVesleyan University, Mt. Pleasant, Ia.

In 1888 the name of I. C. was officially changed to Pi Beta Phi by act of the Illinois
Legislature. There was no change in constitution, ritual, purpose, or basic ideals of the
fraternity. The change was of the name only. Pi Beta Phi has at the present time 65
active Chapters and 94 alumnae clubs.

In 1906 the fraternity as a national group, established a scholarship fund of $1,000
to be awarded competitively to any two competing Pi Phi undergraduates. Later a
fellowship fund of $1,000 was established to be used in any college of the United States
or Europe. Pi Phi did not stop, however, with her activities in the field of higher educa-
tion, Since 1910 the fraternity has maintained a Settlement School at Gatlinburg,
Tennessee in honor of the Founders.

Pennsylvania Delta Chapter of Pi Beta Phi, formerly Dianthians, was chartered at
the University of Pittsburgh, September 19, 1918.

ﬁrm (ﬁamma Sigma

Beta Gamma Sigma had its inception as an honorary commercial fraternity in Feb-
ruary, l9l3. It was a merger of three separate groups, each having the same ideal of
incentive and reward for higher scholarship in the ﬁeld of business training. These
groups, to which all Beta Gamma Sigma members are indebted, came from the University
of Wisconsin, University of Illinois, and the University of California. From this nucleus
of three there has sprung fourteen other thriving Chapters, as follows:

The number of active Chapters is seventeen, located at the Universities of California,
Georgia, Illinois, Northwestern, Iowa, Minnesota, Missouri, New York, Oregon, Penn-
sylvania, Pittsburgh, Washington, Wisconsin, Syracuse, Cincinnati, Ohio State, Indiana.

The local Chapter was organized November, 1920.

Purpose and Aims

The primary purpose of Beta Gamma Sigma is to foster higher scholarship within
the student body, making it a worthy goal to strive toward. Its aim is to inculcate in the
students the spirit of earnestness and desire for achievement in scholarship, that will

later be manifest in the commercial and industrial world, thus reﬂecting credit to his
Alma Mater. '

1922 Atlpleﬁr Resume 1923

 

It is impossible to have champion teams in every sport in any one year, for what
is expended on one must be drawn from another, either in player's skill, in money, or in
student spirit and backing. In nearly every phase of Pitt’s athletic activities, there have
been years of greater achievement; in the same phases, there have been years of lesser
glory. In other words, the season of 1922-23 saw some of Pitt's greatestiathletic teams,
and, a few whose records cannot be boasted of generally. Are we ashamed of any of
them? No, we are proud even of the least of them. VVhy? Because Pitt men have
put forth their best that we might be proud of what they accomplished.

The football team of 1922, led respectively by Captain Tommy Holleran and Acting-
Captain Charley Bowser, was just about the greatest football machine that ever trod the
gridiron. It was not quite the greatest team though, because late‘ in starting, it lost
two games—Lafayette and VVest Virginia. Later in the season, however, when “Pop"
VVarner had added the finishing touches, critics declared that no combination in the
entire country (and that means the world) could successfully meet the Panther attack.
The supposedly invincible VVashington and Jefferson team was completely demoralized,
while the great Penn State eleven was humbled 14-0.

The 1922-23 basketball team, coached by Dr. “Red” Carlson and captained by
Franklin “Red” Byers, had a splendidly successful season, turning ten of 15 games
into victories. This record may not seem so wonderful as we intimate, but never-the—less,
it was the best showing made since 1917, and had there been no injuries, sickness, or
barring of players, it is certain the defeats would have been reduced to one or none.

The baseball nine of 1922 made only a fair record. Lacking the early training
necessary to a successful season, the team suffered several defeats on its initial southern
invasion, and seemed to be followed by some sort of jinx throughout the remainder of the
year. Much natural ability developed, however. and the season ended with a double-
headed triumph over Penn State on the Centre Countian's own ﬁeld.

Had the track team had a larger representation, no doubt it would have outclassed
all competitors; several of the men—Captain Hewitt, Robusch, and Hays~habitually
taking ﬁrst places in_the meets entered, the team losing. out only for want of men to
capture second and third places.

The cross country team, captained by Ted Corbett, who was the leading scorer,
made a clean sweep of the Allegheny meet, taking the first ﬁve places. The team ran
second in the A. A. U. Championship meet. and also took second place in the Penn
State meet which was run on a course two miles longer than the Pitt men were accus-
tomed to.

The swimming team did not have what could be called a successful season from the
standpoint of meets won and lost. Considering, however, the calibre of the teams that
were met. and the scores that are recorded, the record shows up much better. Navy
won by.a margin of only three points, the closest she had been threatened in a number
of years. The Army team, met at VVest Point, won by only one point, while Lehigh,
which has always had a fast team, was defeated 41-30. Captain Clark, Corr, Kistler.
Steele, and Kearns lead the scoring for the Pitt tankmen.

The golf and riﬂe teams, only recently introduced at the University, have been active
in advancing interest in these phases of sport. ,

The Freshmen were unusually successful in the various branches of sport. Although
their records were not as good as were the Frosh records of 1921-22, still, in football they
took four of the six games played, and in basketball they pulled 14 victories out of the
19 contests engaged in. Their baseball record was the best in history, and their tennis
was beyond reproach.

“POP” WARNER

tfoacli Glenn S. \\'arner will terminate his contract as head coach of the Uni-
versity football team next season, completing his ninth year as mentor of the Univer-
sity squad. Coach \\'arner has had a phenomenal record at Pittsburgh, his achieve-
ments being so well known that they need not be enumerated here. He becomes
head coach of football at Lelaind Stanford University, starting with the season of
1925, his successor at Pittsbttrglt being Dr. J. 13. (“Jock”) Sutherland, Dental ’18,
fainous l’itt guard. who has had great success as head coach in football at Layfayette
Colle_g‘t'-.

Coach \\'arner is a graduate of Cornell and played on the varsity there, in 1892,
189.3 and 1894, being captain of the 1894 team. which was the best team Cornell had
up to that time. During 1895 and 1896 he was head coach of the University of
Georgia, turning‘ out winning teams there. Cornell called him back in 1897 as their
head Coaclt, he i‘emai1iiiig there that year and 1898. He then became head coach and
athletic director at the Carlisle Indian School from 1899 to 1903.

His .'\lma Mater, Cornell. then secured his services during 1904, 1905 and 1906
seasons, the team in his last year being the best in the history of the university,
losing only one game. In 1907 to 1913, iitcltisive, he was head coach and athletic
director at the Carlisle lndian School, the team representing that institution being famous
all over the United States for its spectacular and sensational football.

Coach \\'arner leaves l’ittsl)tirg'li for his new position at Stanford with the best
wisltes of all Pittites. He will be assisted at‘ Stanford by “Andy" Kerr, former fresh-
tman football coaelt and \'ar‘sity l)a‘Sl\‘L‘Il)2lll coach at Pitt, and C. F.. (“Tin_\"’) Thorn-
hill, Ex. Mines '17, who was one of the best linemen Pitt ever had.

The 1922 football season was more successful than even the most optomistie had
predicted. Built up from a mere handful of regulars as a nucleus, and depending for the
most part upon material that was not considered above the average, the Panthers devel-
oped into a machine that, after the ﬁrst two defeats, swept all before it.

Of the nine games played—not taking account of the postseason victory over
Leland Stanford—only two defeats were suffered, and they early in the season
when the team was still in the making. Lafayette won by picking up a fumble, and
the defeat came as quite a jolt after the easy victory over Cincinnati. The defeat
at the hands of VVest Virginia, the ﬁrst in eighteen years, was unexpected and cast
still more gloom over the football camp. West Virginia, however, was destined to
be the last victor of the Panther during the l922 season, for, beginning with the
victory over Syracuse, Pitt exhibited more and more strength in each successive
game. \Vinning over Old Penn meant much to Pitt, for only two weeks before,
Navy had been humbled by the Quakers. The victory from the ‘point of score was
not impressive, but it was universally conceded that only the breaks of the game,
and not the lack of superior football, kept Pitt from the more decisive victory that
she deserved. Then came VVashington and Jefferson with her undefeated team. On
the eve of the game, the Panther was conceded to be the under dog, picked to lose
by at least a dozen points. Evidently the Red and Black team had failed to note the
increasing strength of “Pop” VVarner’s men, as the result of the game showed. The
defeat we handed them was Pitt’s greatest‘ achievement, and incidentally, one of
the greatest upsets in the history of the gridiron. The victory also atoned for our
loss to Lafayette for they had been forced to bow to V_Vashington and Jefferson a
fortnight before. The Penn State victory was a ﬁtting climax to a successful sea.-
son. It was a triple victory, because for two successive yeans the Pitt-Penn score
had stood a ‘tie. No, we do not believe that even the most optomi-stic could have
predicted so successful a season.

Tommy Holleran, who was such an inspiration to his teaem, was out of the
game most of the season due to injuries. The position of ﬁeld general fell to
Charlie Bowser, who with “Tiny" Hewitt, “Hoot” Flanagan, Jack Sack, “Pie” Wil-
liams, (VVhat'~s the use, we can’t name them all) was considered one of the greatest
players in the game.

Other than Captain Tommy Holleran, those wh-0 have rendered their last
services, on the gridiron, to their Alma Mater are, John Anderson, “Tiny” Hewitt,
“Pie" \vVilliams, Dick Simpson, John Clark, “Tiny” Miller.

Charlie Bowser, second to none at the center position, unrivaled as a ﬁghter
and leader, and who has already shown himself worthy and capable of leading a Pitt
football team, has been chosen to pilot the 1023 Panthers. R. F. Boulton succeeds
George I. Carson as student manager.

THE 19

lﬁaraitg iBaak21hall— 1923

The 1923 basketball season stands out as the most successful since 1917, when Pitt
had its record team. The record this year, ten victories as against ﬁve defeats, stamps
the 1923 ﬂoor squad as another “Pitt Team.” To the uninitiated this means nothing, but
to those who know, it means a team ﬁlled with ﬁght; one that goes into battle giving all
that it has, regardless of handicaps, for the glory of its Alma Mater.

Beginning the season by defeating Syracuse for the ﬁrst time in history, the Panthers
had a royal start—off that carried them victorious through ﬁve successive games in which
Geneva, Allegheny, Bethany, and West Virginia Wesleyan were conquered.

The Panthers were stopped in their victorious rampage only when Grove City——
conceded to be one of the strongest ﬂoor teams in the country—nosed them out by a
mere two point margin. The ﬁrst defeat was followed by a second at the hands of Penn
State. This victory for Penn State was later duplicated to the direful tune of 38-11, but
still Pitt fought on. Two more defeats, one each from West Virginia and West Point,
completed the unsuccessful games (from the Pitt standpoint).

Now for the bright side of the latter part of the season. The crowning glory, of
course, was the humbling of Washington and Jefferson in two sensational games. The
Presidents, our ancient rivals, always call forth the best that Pitt has, and this year was
no exception. They entered Pittsburgh undefeated and triumphant——they left vanquished
and humbled. The Washington and Lee team, making their ﬁrst appearance in Pitts-
burgh, went south again_with only 33 points to show as against the S2 rolled up by Pitt.
The next contest of the season, that with Swathmore, resulted in the Panthers‘ largest
score of the year, i.e., 61 points, something more than twice as many as scored by the
Garnet team. In the other game that resulted in victory for Pitt, the contestants were
more evenly matched, West Virginia Wesleyan loosing only by three points.

Captain Byers, at guard, led his team as a true leader should, and enjoyed the best
season of his career. Carr at the other guard position, secured for the team a well-bal-
anced defense as well as added power scoring. Lloyd Jordan, getting off to a late
start, still struck fear to the hearts of the opposing teams by his brilliant work. Levison,
the little giant, was a tower of strength from the foul line and from the ﬁeld. Rose
played consistently good basketball and showed up well in all games. Funk, as of old,
was able to get the tip-off from his adversaries, while Reisgen who alternated with him
at the center position was a ﬁnished performer. The reserve strength, Buchanon, Bohren,
King, Frank and Flanagan could always be depended upon to take any place they were
sent in to ﬁll.

“RED” CARLSON

VVhen “Andy” Kerr cast his fortunes with Leland Stanford University as var-
sity football and basketball coach, it left a vacancy in the freshman football and
varsity basketball coaching ranks at Pitt. The athletic authorities, looking forward
to the day when all varsity coaches will be Pitt graduates, decided that Dr. H. C.
(“Red”) Carlson. Col. ’18, Med. ’20, was the man for these jobs, and “Red” started
his work with the Yearling football crew last Fall. He ‘has now had a season’s
experience with these two squads, and everyone admits that he is the man for the
place. The freshman football team made an exceptionally good showing and “Red"
developed a number of men who are sure to shine on the varsity this fall. The varsity
basketball team had one of its best seasons, being well coached and playing ‘brainy
and snappy basketball.

Coach Carlson is one of the many prospects who came to Pitt from Bellefonte
Academy and made good as an athlete and student. He graduated from «the College
in 1918, and from the Medical School in 1920. At present he is -practicing medicine
in Braddock, being afﬁliated, also, with the medicafstaff of the Carnegie Steel Com-
pany there.

Carlson is one of the most famous athletes Pitt has boasted of in the last

decade. He won his letter in football in 1914, 1915, 1916 and 1917, being captain of '7

the varsity in the last year mentioned. The team he captained won every game it
played, V\/est Virginia being beaten 14-9, Bethany 40-0, Lehigh 41-0, Syracuse 28-0,
Penn 14-6, Westminster 25-0, VV. & J. 13-10, Carnegie Tech 27-0, Penn State 28-6,
and Camp Lee 30-0. “Red” paired with “Pat” Herron at the Pitt ends during his
college career, and this was a combination of terminal men which will, perhaps, never
be surpassed on a Pitt varsity.

in baseball, “Red” won his letter in 1917 and 1918, playing second base. In
basketball, as a forward, he won his letter in 1915, 1916 and 1917.

Coach Carlson has the ideal temperament for a coach. He knows how to
handle men and put the ﬁght into them, and he knows how to teach football and

basketball. Judging by the success he had with the two teams this past season,—

much can be expected of his work in future as a member of the coaching staff.

The record of the‘l922 baseball season was far from being an envious one, but
as “Doc” Riddle has said, “It is better to be a loser with Pitt than a winner
with any other team in the country." Regardless of how bad the baseball record
looks on paper, taking all things into consideration it could have been worse. The
season opened with a Southern trip, and Pitt with only two or three days outdoor
practice, was forced to meet ﬁve strong teams that had had weeks of practice on
the diamond. The result of the trip was one tie game, two bad defeats and two that
were more evenly contested. After such a heart breaking start-off, it seemed im-
possible -for us to get away from the losing streak for more than one game at a time.
At the end of the season, however, we staged a comeback by taking the last three
games, two of them from Penn State, which evened our scores with them. Incidental‘-

ly, these two Pitt victories eliminated State from any possibility of taking the Tri-
State championship.

The track team of 1022 contained several individual stars that took first place in
evt-r_v event entered. It lacked, however, in numbers. and lost several meets for lack
of men to compete for second and third places. liven with this handicap, the total points
scored outnuml)ered those of competing‘ teams.

The \\'est \7irg‘inia and Allegheny meets were easily won, while the Navy
meet was just as easily lost. The other meet. on the Southern trip, V. P. 1., was lost
only by two points. In the ;\1'.my meet at \Vest Point, Pitt tied with Army with
seven tirsts, but lost the meet by the score of 88 to 55. Pitt was third in the Syra-
cuse Triangulztr Meet, which was closely contested. Of the thirteen events, Pitt
took four ﬁrsts and tied for first in the pole Vault. 011 May 20, we were host to
the \\'e>:tern .l‘ennsylvania colleges in our annual collegiate meet, which was won by
l’enn State with Pitt second. The relay team, ran fourth at the Penn Relays. Hayes,
the only other Pitt representative, ﬁnished seventh in the two mile run.

Robusch led the point scoring of the spuad with a total of 85 points. Captain
Hewitt was only 2 points behind Rohnsch. Hayes was third in number of points,

having run up a total of 49, while Allen and Brickley tied for fourth place with 40 each.

Only four niemhers of the team—«Tho1'nton, Brickley, Langhran, and Capers—
were lost by g‘raduati0n, so that prospects for this year are very bright. Esler W.
Hayes and l‘l2l1‘l):l11_Q‘l‘t Miller will succeed Captain Orville M. Hewitt and Student
.\lanager Samuel B. Nicliolson, respectively.

Interest has been displayed by students in this branch of athletics to the extent that
it has recently been recognized as a minor sport at Pitt. The various schools of the
University are represented on the team, and a number of excellent shots are being
developed, great assistance being rendered by the military department. A number of
good shots are expected to report for next year’s team.

A successful indoor range season has just been closed, the following schools being
defeated: Carnegie Institute of Technology, Lehigh University, Virginia Polytechnic
Institute, Virginia Military Institute and St. John's College. The team is composed of
the following students according to their respective team standing:

Grifﬁth, J. C. " Lewellen, C. W.

The Freshmen grid warriors, under the tutelage of “Red” Carlson, wound up the
1922 season with four victories as against two defeats. \Vhether the many breaks
throughout the season are considered or not, it must be admitted that the Yearlings,
together with their coach, deserve much credit. All the games played, with one excep-
tion, were difficult encounters, and a test for any yearling eleven.

The initial contest, with Slippery Rock, was a complete walk-away for the Freshmen,
when they piled up 31 points and held the Normal School boys to no score. The West
Virginia Reserves, however, proved more worthy of the Yearling’s metal, and were beaten
only 7 to 0. The Frosh got away to a ﬂying start which resulted in a touchdown early
in the first quarter, but were held scoreless throughout the remainder of the game. The
victory was like balm of Gilead, coming as it did, after the varsity’s defeat at the hands
of West Virginia. The following week, the Cubs followed the precedent set by the
older Panthers, and defeated the Syracuse Freshmen in a hotly contested game in the
Salt City. The Penn State Freshmen, too, were met on their own ﬁeld, but not defeated.
They won the game decisively, making up for the trouncing the Panther Cubs handed
them in 1921. Undoubtedly the best form of the season was shown at Bellefonte, when
the strong Academy team was vanquished 10 to 6. Kiski, like Penn State, sought and
attained revenge for her defeat last year. It was mighty tough for the Freshmen to lose
their last game, but fate had so decreed, and defeat it was.

The entire Freshman team came to Pitt with athletic honors, and scarcely any of
the men can be named without making mention of all, although the line plunging and
scoring of Andy Gustafson stood out as spectacular. Captain Jack Harding, at quarter-
back, was an admirable leader and ﬁeld general_ while Brown, Irwin, and McCutcheon
at the halves were as good as any that have played on a "Freshman eleven. The Iine——
but we must stop here or there won’t be any room for their pictures.

Many things could be said and written of the 1922 Freshman baseball team, and
Coach “Chalky" VV11liams deserves worlds of credit for his success in developing the

talent of the Yearlings. “Chalky's” Freshman nine was indeed a wonder team, and in

spite of the difﬁcult schedule that had been arranged, only one game was lost throughout
the season.

Each succeeding year, the Freshmen produce baseball teams that surpass all previous
records, and the 1922 team was no exception. Furthermore, the standard set by it will
make it mighty difﬁcult for subsequent teams to follow the precedent established. The
Freshmen had a well-balanced team_ and although it was essentially an offensive team,
its best asset being the ability to hit hard and consistently, still it was by no means
deﬁcient in the ﬁeld.

In brief summary—The Pantherlings scored 66 points to their opponents Z7, and in
addition, they averaged less than one-third as many errors as their opponents. The
pitching was far above the ordinary, and on the whole, the entire team performed won-
derfully and will furnish valuable material for this year's varsity.

During the season of l92§—23, girls’ basketball at the University made several
marked advances. More interest was exhibited in the home games than in former years,
and Cincinnati and Temple, two champion teams, were added to the schedule. Temple
University, easily defeating our girls on the home ﬂoor, was held to a tie score until
the last 20 seconds, in the return game, played at Philadelphia. The University of
Pennsylvania, with the same team that defeated Pitt last year, 18-14, was annihilated by
the Blue and Gold lassies. Tired from the games with Temple and Penn, the Pitt girls

faced Bryn Mawr's champion team, only to ﬁnd themselves helpless against this unusual
outﬁt.

This year the team will lose six girls by graduation. ‘Kit" MacNamara, the most
versatile player on the team. was captain for this year, and occupied a position as forward.
Mary Chapman, captain of the sextet in the past season, kept up her brilliant record
as goal tosser. Betty Dutney and “Kit“ Roehn, during the whole season, featured
in the middle section as center and side—center. Grace Love played a steady, sure game
at guard and was ably assisted by Arnoldine Lohman whenever opportunity offered.
Elizabeth Zeigler, the only Sophomore, ﬁlled a regular position at guard. Olive Wilt
and Mary Bigham, ’24, letter girls, and Magdalene Austen and Mary Kammerer, were
strong substitutes and could always be relied upon.

Miss Margaret McClenahan ’l8, Women's Athletic Instructor at the University,
coached the team again this year. Miss McClenahan played on the Freshman team in
’lS and as a guard on Varsity in ’16, ’l7, ’l8.

“Kit” Roehn was a very efﬁcient manager, and was assisted by Lucy Chamberlain.

The freshman team did remarkably well this season, defeating some of the strongest
teams in the vicinity. The games were begun rather late in the year, but after the first
contest, a thrilling one, lost to Wilkinsburg by one point, they found their stride and
continued the season with great success. The closest contest of the year was with
Cathedral High School, resulting in a 24-24 tie. This game was made especially inter-
esting since Mary Chapman, College ’23, coached the Cathedral team. Much will be
expected of the yearlings next season as there will be many positions to ﬁll on the Varsity,

Jeanne Muter, a star from Fifth Avenue High, was captain of the team. Jeanne
played guard at Fifth Avenue but it was soon discoveredthat her skill in shooting
warranted a position as forward. Gertrude Schilling and Sylvia Perovsky alternately
assisted her in the other forward position. Dorothy Drawbaugh, center, and Peg
Thompson, side-center, did excellent work in their places. Kathleen Burgan and
Marcella Akucewitz featured as guards. Martha Kunselman, Abigail Putnam, Elizabeth
Dunmire, and Nina Johnson formed the substitution squad.

Betty Dutney, Education ’23, coached the team. Marion Wolcott, College ’25, proved

a very efficient manager.

The Cap and Gown Club, presented “Leave It to Marian,” written by E. P. George.
’23; H. E. Reppert, ’24, and H. H. Douthitt, '25. The musical numbers for this year’s
show were written by G. F. Curry, ’24; H. E. Reppert, '24; Kenneth McKee, ’25; G. A.
Schnabel, ’l5, and James W. Muir, ’23.

It is believed that this year’s show ranked with the best ever put on by the club, and
a great measure of any success that may have achieved is directly due to the untiring
efforts and kindly assistance of the coaches, Mr. Walter B. Edmundson and Mrs. G. A.
Schnabel. In addition to coaching the dancing, Mrs. Schnabel took care of the costuming,
which was above the ordinary, and to her the Cap and Gown Club desires to express
its especial appreciation.

The Classical Club, the oldest student organization of the University of Pittsburgh.
was founded about 1845, was revived in 1913 after a period of inactivity, and was at that
time put in its present form. The members are those students of Latin or Greek who
have been elected by the club, with the addition of all Juniors and Seniors majoring or
minoring in Latin or Greek, who are automatically members. Its purpose is two—fold:
“to foster the scholastic ideals of the Department of Latin and Greek; to promote social

relationships among its students.” Its principal activity takes the form of an annual
classical play.

In the activities of the current year the University of Pittsburgh Debating Asso-
ciation has enjoyed a success which has been in many respects greater than that of
any other year in its history. Under the new constitution adopted by the organization
last year, the affairs of the association have been on a ﬁrmer basis than heretofore.
The affairs of the association have been ably administered by the officers consisting of
C. R. Foster, Jr., President; James F. McNaul, Jr., Manager; L. A. Schollp, Vice-
President; and Merle Burke, Secretary. The first meeting of the year found 85 men
and girls responding to the call for members. This number dwindelled through the
effects of competition, however, and the association has maintained an active member-
ship of 40 to 45 throughout the year.

At the outset the association was fortunate in securing the services of Louis Broido
as coach. Mr. Broido was a former star Pitt debator and is at present a prominent
Pittsburgh attorney. The first forensic contest of the year was a triangular contest
with W. & J. and State. The negative team for Pitt, composed of Chauncey Pruger,
Eleazor Levy and Merle Burke defeated the VV. & J. team at Washington; while the
afﬁrmative team consisting of R. L. Wilson, David Olbum and C. R. Foster lost a hotly
contested decision to State, the vote being 2 to 1. The question was “Resolved, that
the United States and the several States should establish courts of industrial relations
analagous in principle to that of Kansas.”

The second debate found the University and Harvard resuming relations in what
proved to be the feature contest of the season. In Carnegie Lecture Hall, which was
packed to capacity, the afﬁrmative team of Pitt composed of Chauncey Pruger, Eleazor
Levy and George Davis with A. W. Smith, III, as alternate, defeated Harvard by a
unanimous vote of the judges. The question discussed was “Resolved, that the United
States should enter into a mutual agreement with the former Allied Nations for mutual
cancellation of the inter—allied war debts.”

The third contest was held at the Carnegie Lecture Hall between Pitt and Syracuse

University. In the debate the Pitt speakers, A. W. Smith, Lyttron Schollp and C. R. '

Foster, Jr., defended the affirmative of the question, “Resolved, that the United States
should join the League of Nations."’ Syracuse won by a 2 to 1 decision.

The fourth contest was held in Washington, D. C., with George Washington Uni-
versity. This team was made up of James MeNaul, Jr., Martin Silverman and Merle
Burke, and succeeded in defeating the \/Vashingtonians upon the affirmative side of the
question, “Resolved, that the United States and the several states should establish courts
of industrial relations analagous in principle to the Kansas Court.”

The afﬁrmative team upon the question of cancellation composed of Pruger, Levy
and Davis, Smith as alternate, travelled to Buffalo, N. Y., where Buffalo gained the
decision, and then to Erie to meet Colgate on neutral ground, the second contest resulting
in a victory over the New York State. debators by a two to one decision. Debates
pending with Pennsylvania and one or two other schools will wind up the season, which
has undoubtedly been a good one for those interested in forensics at Pitt. The Inter-
collegiate Oratorical contest in May will also ﬁnd Pitt represented in an effort to bring
the cup again to this city. The Association has enjoyed the helpful advice of Professor
Fisher of the Public Speaking department throughout the year.

The University of Pittsburgh band has had one of the most successful years of its
career, and ranks as one of the best college bands of the country. It is composed of 60
members, all completely uniformed including capes and petty ofﬁcer overcoats. The
Overcoats were purchased by. the athletic council last year and the capes were secured
this year, adding a classy taste to the appearance. They are lined with a golden-colored
lining and the top part is of a blue cloth, matching the overcoats and the uniforms of
similar color scheme.

There is over $6,000 expended in the equipment of the band which includes the
instruments, of which many new instruments were secured this year.

The University band was started back in 1910 by the well-known Dr. D. I. Kirk.
At that time the band consisted of about 20 members and half the time had to have
musicians to ﬁll in and were not completely uniformed, some having coats and caps and
others one of either. Time elapsed and the organization grew to the number of 30 men
until the year of 1915 and between that year and 1917 the organization increased to 50
members, at which time they were completely uniformed. It was at this time Dr. F. J.
Holder, professor of mathematics was the faculty advisor and with his interest the band
was put on firm basis and such interest was created that the organization increased to the
number of 60 members.

In the year of 1916, when the varsity football team began to make its yearly
pilgrimage to the University of Pennsylvania, the band was taken along on these trips
and made their appearance that has established a reputation for itself and the University.

When the year of 1919 rolled around, it looked like the band would not be able
to accompany the team, due to ﬁnancial conditions, but with the the co—operation of the
student body, James H. Scott, the well-known cheer leader, made it possible for the bantl
to make the trip. And since that time the band has been taking the trip with the team
to Philadelphia each year, being sent there by the athletic council.

The band has made every trip with the team to Geneva college with the exception
of the past year when that school played in Pittsburgh. In 1916 the band was sent with
the team to Syracuse. New York.

The previous three years Dr. William Gregory was the student leader and really
put the student band on the modern basis. He was instigator in putting on hand con-
certs, opening up in the Carnegie music hall last year and playing a concert at Geneva.
So well was the concert scheme that it is being followed out this year. Causing a demand
by various people and towns to have the band‘ journey to various places to give a concert.

This year Charles R. Colbert, secretary of the band, who is from Johnstown.
secured the engagement and the band traveled to Johnstown January 29, and gave a
concert, which was highly praised under the leadership of George Davis, the present
student leader and directorship of Rosceretto.

The band will give two home concerts this year at the Carnegie music hall on April
18, 19, and has several other out—of—town offers.

Gustave Schramm, the faculty advisor, who is also a graduate of Pitt, played in the
band during the years of 1915, 16, 17, and since has held his present office and a great
deal of credit belongs to him for his task in making the band the greatest school band
of the colleges.

Last year Professor Schramm instigated the awarding keys to the member for their
service and as a little rememberance for the number of years they participated. The
ﬁrst year a member plays with the organization, he receives a bronze key, for the second,
a silver key and for the third year a gold key, which if he plays a fourth year, he is per-
mitted to keep the-gold key, having his name engraved upon it.

So much interest has been taken in the organization that it is always in demand for
public appearance. They have taken part in school affairs and as well play at the
athletic events and take part in parade demonstration the night before the big
games, parading the entire distance from the school area to the city

After a vacation of two years, the Girls’ Glee Club of the U11iversity of Pittsburgh
has again came to the front. It is already making Pitt famous. We organized this new
club last fall because we knew that when all is said and done, nothing can add to the
reputation of a University like a real Girls’ Glee Club can. Our first move was, of course,
to elect the following ofﬁcers: Helen Davies, president; Helen McPeak, vice-president;
Gertrude Clark, secretary-treasurer; Hazel Hipple, business manager; Mary Campbell,
assistant business manager; Ruth McEwan, librarian; Lucille O’Donnell, pianist. Then
we needed a director, and when we ﬁnally induced Mr. Yearsley to take the position, our
success was assured. VVe made a great hit when we sang over the radio, and one Sunday
when we sang at the Shadyside Presbyterian Church, people from other churches who
heard us asked us to sing at their churches. We helped to make the Men’s Glee Club
concert a success, as was shown by the way the tickets were sold. We weren’t able
to take any trips this year, being so young an organization, but we expect to make up
for lost time next year.

Pitkin Club was organized in l0l—l by a group of 11 Student Volunteers.

It was
named for Horace Tracy Pitkin, who was a martyr missionary to China. The club has
had a steady growth, until at the present time the membership is between 80 and 90.
The meeting place is Shadyside Presbyterian Church and the lessons are under the direc-
tion of Dr. Hugh Thompson Kerr, who has been a great inspiration to the members.
The aim of the club is to create an interest in Christian work. with special emphasis on
the work of the foreign missionary. The early part of the year was spent in a study of
India, while the.Book of Genesis was taken the latter part.

011 May ll), 11, 12 during the past semester the student body of the University
inaugurated a celebration which will become a great tradition of our Alma Mater. This
festivity called Pitt Week was organized to foster Pitt spirit on the campus. The
program which occupied the major portion of three days included many attractive
features including an Interfraternity migratory dance, a dance which a large part
of the Alumni as well as the student body attended and a Lawn Fete at the
Faculty Club at which various student organizations presented short skits. During the
day time there were athletic contests, such as a Push Ball game, a Football Burlesque,
Girls’ Kiddie Kar races and Interfraternity Sweepstakes Races.

These events attracted wide attention throughout the city and presented one phase
of Pitt life to the public that they had not before had a real opportunity to observe.

The committee in charge of “Dick” Holbrook had the cooperation of every Uni-
versity organization, without which Pitt VVeek could never have become a reality.

The Panther, Pitt’s humorous monthly publication, appeared on the campus for the
first time in the fall of 1914. It represented the efforts of Sidney S. Hoehl, G. M. P.
Baird, J. R. Dudley, George Ketchum and a group of kindred spirits, who were its
founders. The Panther has appeared regularly on the campus for the past nine years.

This year “Eddie” George, ’23, occupied the Editorial chair for ﬁve issues and gave
an added impetus to the work. His resignation was immediately followed by that of
H. E. Reppert, Assistant Editor, who was forced to discontinue school for a short time
because of illness. C. V. Starret, ’24, then became Editor—in-Chief.

For the purpose of establishing an organization, membership in which would be a
reward for meritorious work for the Pitt Panther, the members of the 1921-22 Panther
Staff founded the “Pantree Club.” The appetizing name of the club was conceived by
Irvin S. Cobb. Charles R. Williams, Joseph T. Stone, Michael J. Hartnett and Charles
L. Garson, Jr., were the actual founders of the club. Later in the school year the
following were elected to membership: Raymond Knapp, Allen Lynch, Howard Reppert,
Charles Croft, Russell Hamilton, William Fithian, James Parkhill, Verner Eicholtz,
Richard Robbins, Donald Couch, Robert M. Carson, Mary Benson, Harold B. Treester,
and David Heimlich.

The ritual of the club is now being revised, a pledge insignia is being considered and
plans are being laid for the installation of a Pantree Club at Carnegie Tech.

The following were recently initiated: C. V. Starrett. Charles E. Frey, J. V. Wat-
kins, Hugh V. Groves, Marie Messer, Wilverda Hodel, Olive Wilt, Olivia Keonig, and
Phyllis Newlands. Frank B. Maxﬁeld, former Business Manager, and E. L. Davidson,
former Editor-in-Chief were elected to Alumni membership.

The VVomen’s Self-Government Association of the University of Pittsburgh has
achieved and now occupies a unique position among the activities of the student body
of the University. It is the one organization of which all Pitt women students are i[v.\'a
farfo members and in which all are granted representation by voice and vote. Its pur-
pose is threefold; to foster among its members a spirit of unity and loyalty to the
University; to maintain high standards of academic and social life; and to regulate all
matters pertaining to the student life of its members. It accomplishes these purposes
through its three governmental departments—the Executive Committee, which is the
executive body; the VV. S. G. A. Commission, which is the legislative body; and the
Senior Court, which is the judicial body.

All action is carried out directly through the various units, each composed of 30
girls who meet for purposes of discussion, information and reaction. Eighteen senior
girls serve as captains of these units. To these units is carried the work of the various
chairmen of committees, who direct the social life, vocations, and scholarship interests
of the women of the University.

enlarged its ﬁeld of service to the men of the University in many helpful and practical
ways: helping them to attain the best in life, encouraging a larger expression of
Christianity in their eyery day life on the campus and in the class room, and has trained
many students for lives of Christian service. The Association cooperates with the
campus churches in uniting their members and others of the student body in carrying
out the purpose of the Association wherever they may be. The activities of the Asso-
ciation are directed by the student cabinet the ofﬁcers of which are elected annually
by the members of the Association. The President appoints the other members of his
cabinet. The general administration is vested in a committee. of management com-
posed of students, faculty, alumni and trustees of the University.

The Y. M. C. A. Hut is the general social center for the men of the University.
Facilities for study? recreation, letter writing, lunch room, check room, and general
good fellowship attracts 800 to 900 students within its doors daily. Various classes,
clubs, fraternities, and other student organizations use the Hut for their place of meeting.

The inauguration of the Senior Counselor Plan has started an event that is certain
to become a tradition in the University. Over 400 men attended the banquet which was
held immediately after the fall registration. More than 100 seniors acted as counselors
to the 700 freshmen, helping them during registration and giving. them advice and
council during their first few months at the University.

Deptitation teams have been taking over Young People's as well as evening services
every Sunday evening for the greater part of the year. At least one team goes out a
Sunday although frequently there are two or three teams out the same evening ren-
dering this service.

I The “Y” has helped promote a VVorld Forum group which meets every Sunday
evening to consider the problems of the foreign students. It has also served as a
clearing house by which service the foreign students are invited into the homes of
Christian people of Pittsburgh.

The first meeting of this organization was held in the office of Professor Ashe on
November 1, 1922. and was presided over by Roland C. Jacobs. Professor Ashe explained
the need for such an organization on the campus and remarks were made by all those
present. It was at this meeting that Jacobs and Griffin were elected ofﬁcers of the club.

The club is composed of men who have come to the University from homes in West
Virginia and who are thus organized to promote a better fellowship amongst those at
the school from that state, to create a state pride which will aid the development of
spirit on the campus, to circulate propaganda throughout their own. state (as well as
others) concerning the good points and advantages of the University of Pittsburgh, and
to bring to this university more of the graduates of West Virginia preparatory and high

schools.

The Menorah Society of the University of Pittsburgh is a Chapter of the Inter-
collegiate Menorah Association, whose purpose is study and advancement of Jewish
culture and ideals. The organization is non-partisan and non-sectarian. The whole
movement originated at Harvard in 1906, and the Pittsburgh Chapter was organized in
1913. The Chapter here aims to follow out as closely as possible the policy of the
Intercollegiate. The program carried out includes student discussions and addresses by
well-known authorities, both from the city and outside of the city, on subjects of Jewish

history and problems. This year the society carried out its program along the general
lines indicated in the syllabus furnished by the Intercollegiate on the subject of “The
Jew in the Modern World.”

A Vision That
Has Come True

In 1869 George Westinghouse gave the
world his famous Air Brake. As a youth
of 22, he caught a vision of the future
and knew that on adequate braking
facilities rested the unimpeded develop-

ment of efficient railway service.

Today the vision is replaced by actuali-
ties. The advancement in every form of
land transportation has been phenom-
enal and in every instance the Air
Brake has played a leading part.

First on trains, then on trolleys, and now
on automobiles, Westinghouse Air
Bral<es—standard of the world——are still
promoting the progress of transportation.
We invite inquiries from technical stu—
dents, or others, who may be interested
in a study of the Air Brake and its place
in modern transportation.
