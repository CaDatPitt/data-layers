Many people ask: Why is there a
yearbook? Well, there are various
superficial reasons, but the answer
is within each of us. What do I
mean? Consider the university ex~
perience. It is made up of places,
involvements, and remembrances.
The place is different for each of
us. For some, it is the Cathedral,
for others, the dorms, the gym, a
hill, or even Oakland itself. It doesn’t 
really matter what our reference*'ll'~its“.5ll.l
point is, only that it exists for eac V
of us, symbolizing the phys al in,
stitution. Next, consider);
periences each of us has
here. Whether centerecl

from the university, we

place and the experiences,
o e third and most important com-
. esented by the symbol of the OWL. That
is, reflection. The OWL means remembering how we
felt and what we believed. Its purpose is to remind
us of the place and the times, not only by what is
pictured and written but, more importantly, by acting
as a catalyst and causing us to recall our personal ex-
periences. For within them lie our ideals and our Pitt.

     
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
  

hen the University of Pittsburgh
decided, in August, 1965, to become
state—related, every aspect of cam-
pus life was profoundly influenced.
As a consequence of this new sta-
tus, the philosophy which served as
Pitt’s guiding principle underwent
an important change. Under Chan-
cellor Litchfield Pitt was aiming at
establishing itself as one of the 10 or
12 best universities in the country,
and attracting a nation-wide student
body. As a member of the Common-
wealth System, Pitt now aims to
serve the higher educational needs
of the sons and daughters of West-
ern Pennsylvania.

Before 1967, the University com-
munity shared a goal, and its stu-
dents were from backgrounds of
similar values and they shared a
largely common college experience.
Since 1967, Pitt has come to resem-
ble more closely a service station in
that the University has adapted itself
to meeting the needs of a much
more diversified student population,
and without the direction supplied
by a shared goal.

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

  
 

The period 1967 to 1971, which
will serve as the focus of this Year-
book, has been an important transi-
tional era for the University. It has
shifted from shaping a cosmopolitan
student body to accommodating it-
self to a local group, and people

from both these worlds have been
on campus during these years. The
1970-71 school year marked the

relatedness, and this Yearbook

University of Pittsburgh is a different
place now than it used to be.

A university presents its students
with two kinds of environments
within which each individual selects
what is personally important. One
of these is academic, and the other

is social. The kinds of things a stu-
dent selects depends on what each
person wants in the way of intellec-
tual and personal involvement, and
the alternatives for the expression of
such involvements which are avail-
able at the University.

When considering how Pitt is
different now than it used to be,
two separate but related processes
can be observed. Change is one
such process, and the composition
of the student body has been radi-
cally altered. Within the academic
environment a student may want an

.opportunity to sharpen analytical

tools for creative thought, rigorous
job preparation, only a passing
grade, or may not really be sure of
what is desired at all. What is critical
for the University in terms of
change is that the number of values
being expressed has increased, and
that these, and a whole bunch

more, coexist in the same classroom.

Similarly, within the social envi-
ronment, a student may want to get
deeply involved in bringing about
change in the distribution of power;
or, to spend only a few hours a day
at school and the rest of the time
with the same group of friends that
had been together since high
school; or, to concentrate on finding
someone of the opposite sex to hold
on to; or, to stay pretty much alone
and pay attention to the business at
hand. Again, what is important is
that the number of desires being
expressed has increased, and that all
these desires, plus many variations,
seek expression on the Pitt campus.

The impact of state-relatedness
was felt most directly on the kinds
of students who came to the Uni-
versity. The following table illustrates
how the geographical distribution of
the Freshman class has looked be-
fore and after state-relatedness:

1965 1970
Pennsylvania 62% 93%
Other States 38% 7%
Allegheny County 36% 55%

Other Pennsylvania Counties
26% 38%

In addition to there being dif-
ferences in the kinds of commit-
ments students make to themselves
and to the institution according to
where they come from, the back-
grounds of students, both economi-
cally and socially, has become much
more varied. In terms of the college
experience, the Freshman Year is of
special significance, and the per-
centage of freshmen who share the
common denominator of dormitory
residence has decreased from 70% in
1965 to 48% in 1970. Again, this
means that there are fewer widely
shared frames of reference among
students.

The changes in University philoso-
phy and in the makeup of the stu-
dent body have resulted in many
more and varied demands being
placed by students upon the institu-
tion. Related to the process of
change, but remaining distinct is the
process of reform, and it has been
true that most reforms have been in
keeping with the University philoso-
phy of Pitt as a service station, and
have acted to reinforce the changes
which have been taking place. Re-
form, meaning the creation of op-
tions for the expression of different
values, and the removal of policies
which restrict and add requirements
on to the exercise of self—direction,
have touched virtually every area of
campus life, from the Housing
Office, to the Student Affairs Office,
to the Greek system, to the Student
Association, to the grading system,
to the form of the classroom, to the
choice of how one should live and
learn.

What The 7977 Owl must bring
out is the wide variety of values
which people are expressing at the
University of Pittsburgh, and how
certain very important parts of the
life of the entire campus have
changed in response to these
expressions. The articles and pic-
tures which follow attempt to show
what is different about Pitt, and to
explain why. We fully realize that
any individual student experiences
only a very tiny part of the life of
the entire University, and that any-
one who attempts to serve as histo-
rian is subject to the limitations of a
very personal past. This is why we
have sought to involve as many stu-
dents with different, yet highly rele-
vant experiences as possible. In this
way we will try to present the Univ-
ersity of Pittsburgh in as fair a way
as we can see.

CHANGE I INTRODUCTION

Students now have a hand into

decision-making processes in many
areas of the University. However,
interest in the organization which
involves most of these student poli-
ticians, either through election or
appointment, has been steadily and
rapidly declining.

1968 — 2500
1969 — 2400
1970 -1600 — (This is the average of
the two elections
' which were held
because the first
election was de-
clared invalid).

The above figures are the approxi-
mate number of people voting in
Student Government/Association
elections in the last four years, and
the 1971 contest was conducted
under the auspices of a New Consti-
tution which was ratified by about
500 people in a November, 1970 re-
ferendum. The total number of eligi-
ble voters (which in 1971 included
all full— and part—time undergradu-
ates) was well over 15,000, which
meant a turnout for the year of less
than 10%.

 

ln addition to fewer people con-
cerning themselves with the formal
”political” organization, the campus
was much quieter during the
1970-71 school session than it had
been in the previous two years.
Large numbers of students did not
get together to demand basic
changes in Pitt as a social and/or
educational environment, and for
someone looking back and remem-
bering the actions focusing on ”stu-
dent power,” the question of what
is different becomes important and
relevant.

>l< >l< >l<

While a New Constitution altered

the form of Student Government

(president- vice-president—senate)
into the Student Association (four
commissioners and a social council),
there were surprisingly few real
changes in the substance of the or-
ganization. Those people who have
been involved have only attempted
relating the organization to the stu-
dents, rather than relating the stu-
dents, through the organization, to
the rest of the University. The objec-
tive of the movement to gain power
for students was to get people in-
volved in decision-making centers
like the University Senate, the Fac-
ulty of Arts and Sciences, and the
Board of Trustees, and as this was
accomplished, the responsibility to
place these influential people was
given to Student Government.

Yet the organization has always
been extremely closed off and in-
ward-facing. Campaign issues have
perennially dealt with whether or
not to abolish some or all of SC, or,
to drastically restructure it. For those
who thought SC was a good idea
but that it just needed the right
people to make it work, the thing
was to ”represent” the student body
(which meant having a few Greeks,
dormers, commuters, and, if you
could find one, a minority group
member, on your side). However,
the object and the content of this
representation, or the issues being
discussed by those students in-
volved with the University Senate
and elsewhere, were rarely debated,
or even mentioned. This has not
changed even under the New Con-
stitution, but the current Student
Association illustrates a new slant in
this sort of ”a-political politics.”

The New Constitution reflects the
values of those people who desired
efficiency and coordination in stu-
dent affairs, and the idea of having
four commissioners with very
well-defined areas of responsibility
was supposed to make sure that
everything got taken care of, but
that nothing overlapped. However,
the effect of specifying the duties
that each commissioner was sup-
posed to perform within the Asso-

ciation was to reinforce the in-
ward-facing character of the organi-
zation. The outward—facing func-
tions, such as representing students
to the faculty, administration, trus-
tees, and the legislature, were
de-emphasized, and a ”service” ori-
entation dominated. While these
outward-facing functions were still
being handled, students were and
are hearing about services such as
movies and concerts, and the availa-
bility of legal help through the Legal
Awareness and Off—Campus Hous-
ing Committees. While these ser-
vices areimportant,theyarecommon
denominators in that they are ac-
ceptable to most students. The out-
ward-facing functions, which are
potentially very controversial, are
rarely talked about by large numbers
of people.

It is ironic that rumors and scan-
dals of graft and corruption in the
Student Association were rampant
during 1971, so the goals of
efficiency and coordination may
have been bought at a very high
price. Moreover, this inward—facing
and a—po|itical nature includes the
present structure and function of
the allocations process, which has
remained virtually unchanged since
its beginning about five years ago.

The Allocations Committee distri-
butes the funds collected from the
Student Activities Fee, thus they are
the only real ”legis|ative” student
group on campus. The Allocations
Committee is the only group which
can recommend a raise in the Ac-
tivities Fee, which gives them the
power to tax. The distribution of
these monies is the one area where
students have real and complete
power, as a group, over their own
affairs, yet, it is hard to imagine a
legislative body that allocates more
than $200,000 and has the power to
tax and to refuse to fund any organi-
zation, being more removed from
the people for whom they are sup-
posed to be legislating.

New members of this Committee
are nominated by the existing mem-
bers, and candidates are given a test

(which implies that the Allocations
Committee serves the same function
as a Civil Service). This is an attempt
to introduce ”efficiency” criteria
into the distribution of monies, and
tries to create the impression that
the Committee is above the dirty
politics that the council which must
approve their budgetary recommen-
dations indulges in. The work of the
Committee is done almost entirely
during the summer, and this further
insulates the process.

However, the Allocations Com-
mittee clashed violently with the
Student Association this year when
they refused to give money to the
Pitt News for salaries which the
Association had voted the newspa-
per could have. Salaries became a
more critical issue when the com-
missioners of the Association re-

quested monthly compensation for
themselves and their services. A
power struggle ensued which was
somewhat alleviated by the Vice
Chancellor for Student Affairs when
he decided that money for working
in any student organization would
be awarded purely on the basis of
financial need.

What the salary issue did point
out, besides the fact that everybody
suddenly became concerned with
grabbing a piece of the pie for some
kind of ambiguous ”public service,”
was the extent to which the Alloca-
tions Committee is unaccountable,
and the obviously political nature of
the distribution of money.

The New Constitution attempted
to rationalize student administration
of student affairs (there never was
any real ”governing”), and it contin-
ued to consider the Allocations
Committee as being outside politics,
but it had no impact on the most
important problem facing the organi-
zation - the declining student in-
terest and involvement as shown
through fewer voters turning out.
This should lead directly to the con-
clusion that the form of the organi-
zations is quite beside the point,
and that the Student Association
must be placed in a larger context to
understand what has happened.

Student leaders, when explaining
why nothing seems to be happening
at Pitt, invoke the Great God Apathy
as the reason, which actually con-
fuses a great deal more than it ex-
plains. It is misleading to say that
students don’t care. They do care
very deeply — it is just that the
things student leaders are involved
with are neither relevant nor impor-
tant to the vast majority of people.
Apathy is an excuse used by people
who are concerned with a particular
thing to explain why everyone else
is not concerned with that particular
thing. It is all a matter of differing
priorities.

For large numbers of people there
are things more important than stu-
dent politics, and for those who
wish to become politically involved,

there are other organizations which
exist and are much closer to the
needs of particular groups of peo-
ple. Commuters have their group,
dorm students have theirs, Greeks
have theirs, minority students have
theirs, and so on. The Pitt student
body is extremely heterogeneous,
and so long as the Student Associa-
tion attempts to serve ”all” students,
it is left with common denominators
and those services which these
other primary groups cannot easily
provide. Moreover, the kinds of
things that the Student Association
emphasizes, such as movies and
concerts, are not the kinds of things
which bring voters flocking to the
polls to choose between radically
different alternatives.

The most important thing about
student politics at the University of
Pittsburgh is that it is extremely frag-
mented, and that there is little inter-
action between the various mostly-
closed groups. Demands for some
kind of change were registered most
vocally this year by Women, Blacks,
and Commuters, yet each was con-
cerned only with their own group,
and the changes which were de-
manded were largely of importance
only to that group. This has been
the pattern of political activity at
Pitt for quite a while. The demands
for student power, such as those
made by the Concerned Students
and Faculty two years ago, were also
demands which were aimed at mak-
ing room for the involvement of a
certain group of people. Student
participation in University deci-
sion—making is as much minority-
group politics as the creation of a
Black Studies Department, an Insti-
tute for Feminist Studies, and the
erection of two bus shelters. in an
environment which is as decentral-
ized as at Pitt in that there are many
groups which are expressing
different values, it becomes some-
what easier for one well—organized
group to push its demands right up
front. It also means that political ac-
tivity is directed towards creating
space for different kinds of groups

to have room to operate. There are
no students who are concerned with
bringing about a single change in
the entire institution, nor would any
such effort be successful. However,
many of the demands made by par-
ticular groups have been well-
received.

Perhaps this is one reason why
the campus is suddenly quieter.
Many vocal groups now have a slice
of the pie for themselves, and they
have become more interested in
protecting and/or expanding their
piece. In addition to the success of
many of the formerly discontented,
it is often pointed out that a very
large percentage of those who were
most vocal in demanding changes
two and three years ago came to Pitt
from far away. There are fewer such
people coming to Pitt nowadays,
and perhaps this means that there
are fewer people who are commit-
ted to living at the University in the
fullest sense, and thus are more
likely to find things which they
would like to see changed than
those who are only at school with a
small part of their total commit-
ment. There is one other thing
which people talk about as being
somewhat responsible for the com-
placent campus atmosphere, some-
times in jest and sometimes in ear-
nest. There is still speculation as to
what would have happened if the
Cambodian Invasion and the Kent
and Jackson States killings had oc-
curred while Pitt was in full Winter
Session, and many groups use the
Summertime to take care of much
important work. Perhaps the long
vacation period has caused Pitt to
miss out on much of contemporary
college activity, yet a rather large
number of important decisions are
made when there are very few peo-
ple around to make comments.

There seem to be fewer issues
around in 1971 which attract the
attention of large numbers of stu-
dents. The mode of expression of
political activity has also changed.

time & change I student politics & government

The possibility of 800 students jam-
ming the Commons Room to voice
opposition to a piece of State legis-
lation which would try to crack
down on student protest; the
chances of 1000 people sitting in the
Common Facilities Building after it
has been ordered cleared to discuss
the meaning of a Free University; or,
the odds of 40 students visiting the
Provost to demand a review of the
College of Arts and Sciences curri-
culum, all seem utterly remote, and
even absurd.

The conventional wisdom which
is shared by many members of the
faculty and administration holds
that the student of today is a very
socially concerned, involved, prag-
matic, and hard-working person.
The student of 1971 is not bothering
with trying to change any institu-
tions, but is concentrating on get-
ting as much out of the college ex-
perience as is possible to be pre-
pared to contribute towards making
changes later on in life and society.
This is to be distinguished from the

loud, idealistic, impractical student
of the past few years who was very
quick to criticize, but was never
around when it came to doing the
hard work. To the holders of this
conventional wisdom it is the doing
of the hard work which is the most
important thing. This fits in very
nicely with the philosophy which
has been adopted by the Pitt Ad-
ministration. The Vice—Chance||or
for Student Affairs says that his staff
is around to help out students and
to serve their needs. In order to find
out what these needs are, the
Vice-Chancellor set up a Student
Affairs Advisory Committee which is
made up of all the campus leaders
from the major organizations. No
one can complain about a lack of
communications.

But pressures for change have
never come from -a group like the
Advisory Committee, nor have they
come from the student government.
They have always been generated
outside these ”representative”
groups, and outside of the usual
channels. The politics of the pre-
vious three years has been con-
cerned with the expansion and loos-
ening up of the University of Pitts-
burgh as a social and political envi-
ronment. If the conventional wis-
dom contains some truth, then this
period has come to an end, and the
politics of the future will be consid-
erably different than what has gone
before.

STUDENT
GOVERNMENT

one morning during the Winter

Term of 1969, a group of about forty
students entered the office of the
chief academic official of the Uni-
versity and requested an audience
with the Provost. The Provost ap-
peared and said that he thought a
meeting with five or six group “rep-
resentatives” would be more ap-
propriate, but the group, wishing to
avoid creating distinctions between
’’leaders’’ and ”followers,” politely
refused this offer and repeated their
request for a meeting of the whole.
Such a group meeting had never
been held at Pitt, and the Provost,

CU l'l'lCLl l at‘ Change lacking any precedent for evasive
action, agreed to the request.

    

“ ,,.,y\w»-an
, g —‘

The student group presented 2

demand calling for the creation of 2

faculty-student committee to con-

duct a year—long study of the Col

lege of Arts and Sciences curricu

lum, and the power to appoint the

faculty member who would bs

. chairman of this committee. The
Provost and the Dean of the Faculty

of Arts and Sciences saw that such a
study might be of some value and
committed themselves to it, but the
selection of the faculty members
and the chairman was to be left to
the faculty and the Dean of the Col-
lege.

During the course of its existence,
the committee recommended many

reforms in and additions to the Col-“

lege curriculum, however, it concen-
trated its attention on the creation
of a radically different alternative to
the Freshman Year. This alternative,
the Prologue Program, stirred con-
siderable controversy among the
interested members of the Faculty
of Arts and Sciences, and it was de-
cided that the Freshman Year should
be subjected to another study by a
more ”representative” group. It is
significant to note that in the sec-
tion on curriculum of the Universi-
ty’s report to the Middle Atlantic
States Accreditation Association, no
mention is made of the fact that a
year-long study ever took place.

The Arts and Sciences Review
Committee (ASRC) was born in a
”radical” fashion, and its birth sym-
bol stayed with it throughout its
lifetime. It grew up during an era
when the curriculum was already
undergoing reform, and the ASRC
was committed from its inception to
expanding the academic environ-
ment to allow for different kinds of
college experience. The charged
atmosphere surrounding the crea-
tion of the ASRC was in large mea-
sure generated by the ROTC con-
troversy, in which Pitt emerged as
one of the first large universities to
eliminate academic credit for the
military program. In addition to this
major change (major in the sense
that very many people were in an
uproar over it), a pass/fail grading
system and a self—designed major
program were initiated within the
College in 1967 and 1968. These two
programs were aimed at creating
new options in the curriculum so
that a student would have increased

freedom to pursue what was per-
sonally interesting, and they indi-
cated the direction that curricular
reform was to take.

The formal staffing of the ASRC
waited for the assumption of office
by the newly—appointed Dean of the
College Dr. Jerome Schneewind
(Philosophy), and the new Dean
declared himself as in favor of ex-
tensive reform. Dr. David Bramhall
(Economics) was appointed chair-
man of the student—faculty commit-
tee, and he was selected over Dr.
David Houston (Economics) who
was the choice for chairman of the
original student group, perhaps be-
cause Dave Houston had a more
”extremist” reputation than did
Dave Bramhall, and a more ”ration—
al” approach, as Dean Schneewind
was supposed to exemplify, was
deemed more appropriate.

However, the entire ASRC was
composed of people who from the
very beginning were strongly com-
mitted to structural change, and
they defined their role as one of
advocates of such change on behalf
of students and the principle of
student-directed learning. The ASRC
was never intended to be representa-
tive of widely differing educational
philosophies, and perhaps this fact
contributed to their relative isolation
from the rest of the faculty and the
resultant shock that appeared when
the Prologue Program was pre-
sented.

The review proceeded in an ex-
tremely open manner, with hearings
being held all over campus to which
anybody and everybody was invited
to attend and express a point of
view. At such hearings, the topics of
grades and requirements dominated
discussion, as they were the things
which were central to the experi-
ence of all students. Indeed, these
two areas had already been much
discussed and reform had been tak-
ing place. The number of credits

needed to graduate had been re-

duced from 124 to 120; the freshman
physical education requirement had
been dropped; and, the pass/fail
system had evolved into a

satisfactory/un-satisfactory grade
which was a bit more attractive be-
cause a ”U” was not included in the
QPA calculation, while an ”F” (from
the pass/fail system) was taken into
account. Again, all these curricular
changes were in the direction of
expanding options and removing
restrictions — the student was being
given more room to choose what
was desirable.

The ASRC continued this trend by
proposing the abolition or reduction
of many more existing requirements.
The foreign language and English
composition requirements were, af-
ter a hell of a lot of debate, re-
moved; the limitation on the num-
ber of credits a student was permit-
ted to take in a single department
was raised from 40 to 60; an inde-
pendent study term consisting of a

block of 15 credits was made avail-
able; and, a further evolution of the

grading system into the present
credit/ no-entry option came about.
However, while all these reforms,
and many additions to the curricu-
lum, were aimed at helping the stu-
dent to make college life more per-
sonally relevant, the ASRC felt that
it was necessary to radically alter the
freshman year if what they consid-
ered to be the main curricular prob-
lem at Pitt was to be dealt with.
The review committee decided
that the curriculum functioned well
for two types of students, but not
for others. Students at Pitt who
started out sure of their future plans
(e.g. to be a doctor or a lawyer)
could very easily find their way
through four years without serious
questions. A survey conducted by

the College found that the percent-
age of students who planned to
enter professional school after grad-
uation did not change significantly
from freshman to senior years, thus
supporting this view. The student
with a relatively large amount of
self-direction and motivation could
take advantage of a self-designed
major program or the increased pos-
sibilities for creating new courses.
However, the number of people
who do exercise these options is
extremely small. in any case, these
two kinds of students have room to
work at Pitt.

The ASRC aimed its work at the
large majority of students who are
not quite sure of what it is they
want to do either during or after‘
college, and do not really know
where to go for some advice. They

were thinking of students who are
not sure of what they want to learn,
or how to go about learning, or
whether to learn at all. As the ASRC
defined the most valuable learning
experience as the learning which is
most personally meaningful and the
learning in which the student is the
most personally involved, the solu-
tion the ASRC hoped for was the
creation of an environment which
would foster se|f—directed and moti-
vated learning. The result was the
Prologue Program.

Basically, the Prologue Program
would take 300 freshmen and put
them in groups of 15 with one pro-
fessor per group. The decision to
participate in the Prologue Program
would be entirely voluntary, and a
student could decide to drop out
without hassle. Each group would
decide what it is they wanted to
learn, and how they wanted to learn
it. Topics could be singular or multi-
ple, and they could be pursued
either individually, in smaller
groups, or, collectively. No options
were closed off — a student could
elect any regularly scheduled
course, and a group could meet or
not meet according to what its
members thought would be ap-
propriate. Each student would be
advised to keep a Portfolio, which
would contain written evaluations
by any faculty members or other in-
structors that the student worked
with, a student's own personal eval-
uation, and/or a student's own
work.

The Program was to be experi-
mental, and it was aimed at freeing
the student and group from tradi-
tional restrictions to be able to pur-
sue what the student and group

considered intellectually important.
it would attempt to undo the ex-
perience of 12 years of other-
directed learning, which the ASRC
considered to be the heart of the
educational problem. It was to be
an experiment because no one was
sure of how the kinds of fresh-
men who came to Pitt would adapt
to such an environment. At small
”elite” schools like Antioch and Reed,
such a freshman year is the rule, but
at a large, heterogeneous (in the
sense that the student body is not
se|f—se|ected as it is at the smaller
schools), urban institution, such an
idea is largely untried.

The central ideas underlying the
Prologue Program — that learning
should be student-directed; that
teachers do not have a monopoly
on what is to be learned; and, that

learning does not take place solely
in classrooms and in fifty—minute
chunks — caused much uneasiness

among many faculty members, and .

generated much opposition. One
major area of concern focused on
what some people thought would
go on in a Prologue group. Some
people thought that a group would
be more concerned with ”emotion—
al” rather than ”inte||ectua|” devel-
opment, and that a sensitivity train-
ing—like atmosphere would prevail in
an environment in which group
pressure stifled individual creativity.
Some people connected the Pro-
logue Program to the largely un-
structured ”open c|assroom” ap-
proach to teaching favored by Hous-
ton and Bramhall, and determined

time & change I curricular change

that a chaotic situation would result
in which students did little ”real”
work because of the lack of direc-
tion which was normally provided
by the instructor.

This last point related to another

fundamental disagreement which
centered on the value of stu-
dent-directed learning. Some
thought that students, especially

freshmen, were not mature enough
to handle so much freedom. In ad-
dition to doubts about student ma-
turity, there were doubts as to the
nature of the role that the faculty
member (mentor) of each Prologue
group was supposed to play. People
were not sure if the mentor was
supposed to teach whatever the
group wanted to learn (thus raising
questions of professional compe-
tence and integrity), to act as a par-
ent—image and/or group facilitator,
or, to advise and consent to group
decisions. Perhaps the most contro-
versial question concerned the
”power” to decide what was to be
learned and in what manner, which,
in the Prologue group, shifted from
the instructor to the student.

These issues formed the back-
drop against which the Faculty of
Arts and Sciences debated the Pro-
logue Program. As the Program
was presented as being experimental
in nature, much of the discussion
focused on evaluation, both of the
individual student and of the Pro-
gram as a whole, in terms of the
achievement of its objectives. As the
ASRC intended it, evaluation of a
student-directed learning process is
primarily the responsibility of the
student, and in any case, an evalua-
tion should be something to help
the student, not a threat of future
failure. It was difficult, perhaps im-
possible, to satisfy those people
who demanded a more ”rigorous”
evaluation procedure than the
Portfolio which was suggested by
the ASRC. However, this was disap-
proved of because the ambiguity
surrounding what was to go into it
might lead to an inaccurate picture
of the student being presented.

An evaluation of the Program as a
whole was even more difficult to

agree on. It is not so easy to mea-
-sure the success of the creation of

an environment which fosters
self-directed and motivated learning.
The controversy about the program
evaluation was especially disap-
pointing to the ASRC because noth-
ing else that the College of Arts and
Sciences does gets evaluated very
rigorously; why should the Prologue
Program be so special? Furthermore,
the ASRC had held hearings to
which faculty members were
specifically invited to attend and
participate. This attracted about 16
teachers. Why all the shouting now,
but so little interest before? In any
case, some people formed the opin-
ion that the Prologue Program was
put together very sloppily, and they
were turned off to it.

Much stiffer opposition was gen-
erated by thoughts of where the
money would come from to finance
such an effort. Very little considera-
tion of whether or not money is
being spent wisely is indulged in by
the faculty and, as a result, no
thought is given to questioning the
value of that which already exists in
the budget. The Prologue Program is
a ’’marginal” venture in that it must
be added to everything else which
exists, so that it must compete for
scarce resources with the mainte-
nance of existing programs, the ex-
pansion of existing programs, and,
other newly—proposed programs. It
was assumed that each Department
in the College would contribute to
the financing of the Prologue Pro-
gram, and that this money would
therefore be diverted from other
expenses such as teachers and other
personnel. As this was the case,
many junior faculty members felt
themselves threatened and, there-
fore, in opposition.

The Prologue Program, as a margi-
nal program (estimated to cost
about $300,000) which had created a
great deal of controversy, had little
hope. The faculty decided during
the Winter Term of 1971, by a vote
of 136 to 81, to create another
committee to study the Freshman
Year and make recommendations
for change.

The path of the ASRC through the
year illustrates very clearly the poli-
tics of curricular change. The Pro-
logue Program was identified as the
”radical” idea, and, even though it
had the support of the Dean of the
College, the chairman of the Stu-
dent Affairs Committee of the Uni-
iversity Senate, the Faculty of Arts and
Sciences Council, and the Student
Cabinet of the College, it was put
aside in favor of a more ”representa—
tive” group. The popular opinion
was that the ASRC did accomplish
one thing - it got everybody to
agree that there was a need for
change. Everybody agreed that the
current Freshman Year is a waste of
time; that grades don't really say
much about a student's ability and
could even hurt; and, that it would
be really nice if students liked what
they were doing and were free to do
it. The problem is to get people to
agree on what the alternative should
look like — the radical approach was
”too far out,” in the sense that it
sought to change many basic rela-
tionships between the student and
the academic community. Whether

or not this mood lasts, and the kinds
of changes, if any, which emerge,
remains to be seen.

Curriculum reform has continued
during and after the ASRC. The lat-
est option which has been ap-
proved allows the student to take
120 credits in the College without
declaring a major. The Bachelor of
Liberal Arts Degree has been estab-
lished for students electing this op-
tion. In general, the College curricu-
lum, indeed the curricular offerings
of every school in the University
with the exception of Engineering,
have greatly expanded and loosened
in the last few years. The Engineer-
ing School has seen fit to prescribe
each course that its students will
take for their first two years, and

everyone will take the same courses.

The College curriculum has ex-
panded and loosened to serve more
kinds of students than it had served
previously. The entire direction of
academic reform has been parallel
to the direction of change through-
out the University — a more open
environment to serve more people.
The ASRC provided a very sophisti-

cated educational philosophy to in-
terlock with the various other as-
pects of Pitt life; whether anybody
wants to accept it or not does not
make it any less relevant. University
of Pittsburgh students are today
"demanding” many different kinds
and degrees of intellectual experi-
ence. Student—directed learning,
whether it is consciously demanded
or not, exists, and will continue to
exist regardless of the role the in-
structor plays and in whatever form
the classroom takes. The issue with
which the ASRC concerned itself
was increasing the number of stu-
dents who were making conscious
demands.

One final element to be consid-
ered is the role of active student
involvement in bringing about cur-
ricular reform. Beginning with Joe
Kociubes, who worked hard to cre-
ate ways and means for students to
become involved in decision-
making processes in every area
of University life, through Mike Fa-
bricant, Ellen Wartella, and Everett
Bannister, who served as the student
members of the ASRC, to the stu-
dents who sit on the various aca-
demic councils in the schools of the
University, active student involve-
ment has been a crucial input into
the reform process. It is one thing
for interested faculty members to
respond to and advocate student
demands for a different education,
and quite another for faculty to
speak in a student vacuum. What
has been most noticeable during the
1971 school year has been the ab-
sence of student demands for re-
form. The future of curricular
change is therefore open to serious
question.

time & change I curricular change

T16 University of Pittsburgh has

lived with a ”financial crisis” ever
since the decision to become
state—related, and it will continue to
do so for as long as it maintains that
status. Being a part of the Common-
wealth System of Higher Education
means that Pitt is directly exposed
to the budgetary process of the
State Legislature, and that the pres-
ent and future of the institution is
integrally tied to the politics of
Pennsylvania. In the sense that Pitt
is one of a number of special inter-
ests competing for a piece of the
Pennsylvania pie, its financial situa-
tion is one of unrelieved uncer-

pitt, the state, and finances .
tainty.

Tuition will be increased next year
for the fourth straight year, and this
is, in part, a reflection of a State tax
structure which is inadequately built
to handle increasing State assump-
tion of rising costs, especially in the
areas of health, education, and wel-
fare. This inadequate tax structure
(inadequate from Pitt's point of
view) is itself a reflection of the po-
litical climate, and people's values
as to the acceptable role of the state
government. This climate assigns

higher education a relatively low
priority in the total distribution of
the pie, and certainly a lower prior-
ity than is given the elementary and
secondary varieties. Perhaps it is that

Pennsylvania taxpayers cannot quite
see the benefits that all this ”higher
education” is reaping for the citi-
zens of the State.

One critically important conse-
quence of the University’s participa-
tion in the Commonwealth System
is that Pitt is assigned a role to play
in the State's Master Plan for Educa-
tion, and that future funding ar-
rangements are made in accordance
with the State’s objectives. In times
of tight money, ”efficiency” is the
cry heard ’round the state, and so
faculty Productivity measures which
are based on the number of student
credit hours taught has made many
teachers uncomfortable. In addition
to the tendency of such measures to
encourage larger class—sizes for in-
creased ”output,” there is a great
deal of pressure on Pitt to become
the ”senior college” (serving pri-
marily upperclass students) for
Western Pennsylvania, and to
de-emphasize underclass education.

Beyond Pitt's role in a new State
Plan, there are a number of new
financing proposals being talked
about to aid higher education.
However, the current crush being
experienced by private schools indi-
cates that any new State resources
will be aimed primarily at helping
out the private sector so as not to
multiply the already rising demand
for publicly-subsidized education.
One possible bright spot for Pitt is
that the State may assume the costs

of special programs dealing with
disadvantaged and minority stu-
dents, thus providing Pitt with a
rather large measure of budgetary
relief. The state-related role further
indicates that enrollment will in-
crease slightly (around 2%) for about
the next five years, and that then it
will level off. The proportion of stu-
dents involved in graduate and
professional education, currently
about ‘/3, will remain so in the fu-
ture.

Before the advent of the 18-year
old vote, one could make a fairly
decent argument that tuition in-
creases were a subtle form of taxa-
tion without representation. Stu-
dents were paying money; the
amount of money paid was deter-
mined largely by the State Legisla-
ture; but, most students could not
vote for State Legislators. Without
stretching this argument too far, it
becomes apparent that the budget is
now fundamentally a political issue,
and that it is far removed from the
University community. lf anyone has
any questions concerning how the
University of Pittsburgh spends its
money, or why a certain program
was cut, discussions need no longer
be held in the Common Facilities
Auditorium, the Commons Room, or
the Chancellor’s Office, and admin-
istrators or trustees need not be pres-
ent, except for ceremony. All efforts
directed at changing things should
be addressed to Harrisburg.

Uiolent students and lax faculty

members are favorite campaign is-
sues with many politicians. The
American people, not fully aware of
what is actually taking place on
campuses across the country, con-
sider unrest among students the na-
tion’s number two problem. Studies
of today’s college scene, however,
have shown that figures have been
greatly exaggerated and often the
observations made by right and left
wing politicians miss the point en-
tirely. Revolutionaries and terrorists,
the so—called academic society as
envisioned by many rightists, are
said to be responsible for all the
problems of the United States. Actu-
ally, the violent university students
make up only a fraction of one per—
cent of the student population and

political attitudes towards students they are confined Onlv to a Sma“

minority of campuses.

One point, though, must be
clarified. Many students of the past
four years share the same ideas as
the ”violent sector”. The ideas and
goals in themselves are not violent.
The association of the two is only a
profiteering tactic of some politi-
cians, like the President and Vice
President. They contend that if some
students ascribe to a philosophy and
are violent in asserting it, then any-
one who believes that philosophy is
violent. This same reasoning can be
'eversed and used to brand anyone
with any nationalistic feeling
[”America, love it or leave it”) as
Hitleristic, for Hitler used violence
for his nationalistic goals.

It is ironic, though, that student
violence which is confined to prop-
erty take over and damage as its
goals is often countered by the ”si-
lent majority”, middle America,

”hard hat” personal violence. In the
Oakland area, with two major uni-
versities, it is not uncommon for a
student with long hair to be ”blood-
ily rehabilitated” by a good Ameri-
can who opposes student violence.
The point being made here is not
that non-students are more violent,
the violent ones are always a small
few, but, that student property vio-
lence is more greatly feared and
reacted to than the physical vio-
lence which arises out of intoler-
ance. Tolerance for the beliefs of
others, after all, is American.

The question now becomes, does
one condemn the academic com-
munity for ideals possessed by many
students. This leads to the age-old
human reaction of fearing those
who are different either in appear-
ance or thought. In this respect,
1971 is no different than 1071. This

kind of fear is evident in the actions
of many politicians who favor the
exclusion of ”potential radicals”
from the campus, ignoring the fact
that ”protesters” or ”involved stu-
dents” also tend to be the best stu-
dents, the thinkers, the questioners,
and the concerned members of the
campus society.

At Pitt there were no po-
lice-student confrontations (except
for a panty raid in 1968), burnings,
or rock throwing. The only forceful
activities were confined to specific
academic and social issues. In 1969,
a two-day Free University took place
in Common Facilities which was
eventually recognized by the admin-
istration. Also in 1969, black stu-
dents spent the night in the compu-
ter center to emphasize their de-
mands. Other activities were in the
form of rallies, mass meetings, and
conferences, all of which were tac-
itly supported by faculty and admin-
istrators.

Higher education has long been a
scapegoat for the nations problems
and a target for the attacks of politi-
cians. The results have been cries of
oppression by many students and
this reinforces the political accusa-
tions. Perhaps what is really at fault
on all sides is the great American
fear of plots, takeovers, subversion
and insurrection. From the perspec-
tive of one side the communists are
taking over and it appears to the
other side that the fascists are in the
lead. It seems, though, that every-
one is oblivious to what really took
over — hysteria.

t the June 1970 meeting of the
Faculty Senate of the University of
Pittsburgh, a resolution was passed
setting up a two-day political recess
for the November, 1970 general
election. The day before election
day and election day were to be set
aside as school holidays (to be made
up during the reading period at final
exam time) for students to actively
participate in election campaigns of
their choice. As a part of the resolu-
tion, a University Citizenship Infor-
mation Center was to be initiated to
facilitate participation and to have

election recess available information on candidates

and the electoral process.

The resolution was a direct result
of the incidents at Kent State and

Jackson State. Student demonstra-
tions not only were proving to be
frustrating but dangerous to the
demonstrators. Many students were
concerned that, in general, the po-
litical process was not working and
specifically, that the involvement of
the United States in Indochina was
disastrous. In the spring of 1970 stu-
dents on many campuses through-
out the country felt that the most

ational way to change the politics
.nd policies of the country was to
)€‘CO|'T1€ directly involved in political
rampaigns, rather than bringing
IFESSUTE on public officials through
lemonstrations. In this context, Pitt
long with other schools across the
ountry passed resolutions institut-
1g political recesses and political
wformation centers.

On October 12, 1970 the Citizen-
hip Information Center at the Univ-
rsity of Pittsburgh opened. On
Jovember 2 and 3 classes were can-
elled throughout the University
with exception of several profes-
ional and graduate schools and in
we School of Nursing where stu-
ents had voted in a referendum
ot to participate in the recess.

  ARTINO

EPRESENTATIVE

While the Citizenship Information
Center will continue during the
1971-1972 year, the recess held in
November 1970 may be the only
such recess ever held on the Pitt
campus. The number of students to
participate in the recess is not con-
clusive, but in general students did
not seem particularly interested in
any campaign on any level — guber-
natorial, senatorial or congressional,
the major races in 1970.

Two surveys taken following the
recess give some indication of stu-
dent participation. One taken in
eight political science classes on
Wednesday, November 4, among
286 respondents showed that 24%
did some work during the fall cam-
paign while only 18% worked during

the election recess. In this sample,
70% of those who worked, worked
25 hours or less in the campaigns
they were ”involved in.”

In a questionnaire sent out by the
Citizenship Information Center at
the end of November to a random
sample of students from the student
directory (147 respondents) showed
that 8.8% of these students partici-
pated in the election campaigns.
Reasons given for not participating
were:

1. Too busy with school work —
37%

2. Lack of information — 12.6%

3. Disinterested in candidates
running — 11.9%

49% said they were registered to
vote and 21% specifically said they
would register when they were old
enough or if the law changed. Of
the students who were registered
79% said they had voted in the No-
vember election.

In the CIC questionnaire students
were asked their opinion of the re-
cess. 39% said the recess should be
continued, 32% said the recess
should not be continued, and 26.5%
did not have any opinion.

In early spring, 1971, the Faculty
Senate again began to discuss the
recess. The Student Affairs Commit-
tee of the Senate was asked to
investigate the recess and report
back to the full Senate. Under the
auspices of the Student Affairs
Committee, the Citizenship Informa-
tion Center conducted a referendum
on March 10 in a random sample of
eleven o'clock undergraduate
classes. Of 487 respondents, 55% felt
that there should be no recess; 16%
felt a one day recess should be held;
and 29% felt the policy of a two day
recess should be continued.

Because of the March 10 referen-
dum, the results of the question-
naires following the election, and a

T18 Revolutionary Socialist Union

came into existence in the autumn
of 1969, originally (since the summer
of 1968) having been a chapter of
the Students for a Democratic So-
ciety. National SDS had splintered
into several irreconcilable factions —
with none of which Pitt members
could identify — and ties were sev-
ered from the national organization.
A traumatic confrontation with
members of the SDS Weathermen
faction, and active participation in
the tumultuous struggle of the Pitts-
burgh Black Construction Coalition,
forced this handful of activists to
work out a more serious outlook in
relation to theory, organizational

structure, and general activity.
Initially, there had been much
groping and uncertainty, some spon-
taneous and rag-tag (yet thoroughly
peaceful and legal) chasing after
military, CIA, and corporate recruit-
ers on campus, a few miserably
organized rallies, and the produc-
tion of many thousands of little-read
leaflets. But RSU members came to
play important roles in the local
grape boycott of the Farmworkers’
Union, in campus support for the
Hospital Worker’s strike, and in cer-
tain anti-war and women's libera-
tion activities. RSU also played an
important role in the flurry of activ-
ity and the broad-based student co-

 o£r£uo

int
ﬁl

lation stimulated by the University
financial crisis of 1970.

With respect to the larger context
within which the University exists,
RSU members argued that the social
and political structure of the United
States was largely determined by the
need of the largest corporations to
preserve the system of reverse wel-
fare capitalism that presently
(obtains.) Asserting that such an
economic dictatorship made full
political democracy impossible, RSU
maintained that social problems in
America could never be overcome
within such a framework. American
resources should be used to meet
the needs of the people, to eradi-
cate hunger and sickness, and to
wipe out all forms of poverty racism,
and oppression; but the dynamics of
the American economy were divert-
ing resources into other channels
which were more profitable for the
corporations. T

The well-being of all Americans,
they believed, did not depend on the
corporations, but instead upon the
industrial technology and on the
labor of America's skilled,

semi—skilled, and unskilled workers
in the blue-collar and white—collar
sectors (making up over 83% of the
labor force). Unsolved social prob-
lems resulted in growing oppression
and discontent, and this was leading
to the growth of social struggles on

 

the part of the working people, the
poor and unemployed, black people
and other minorities, women, stu-
dents and youth, etc. Members of
the RSU believe that socialists
should support and participate in
such struggles, at the same time agi-
tating for a view which linked all of
the struggles to each other and
called for people’s control (instead
of corporate control) of the econ-
omy. Hopefully, major portions of
the various social movements would
ultimately merge into a powerful
socialist movement.

On the basis of this outlook, RSU
members engaged in the activities
already mentioned plus others: dis-
tributing anti-war leaflets at factory
gates in the aftermath of the inva-
sion of Cambodia; visiting the picket
lines of the United Auto Workers
during the General Motors strike
during the autumn of 1970, and dis-
seminating information on campus
in support of that strike; sponsoring,
with the Young Workers Liberation
League, a large and successful de-
fense rally for the persecuted Black
Communist Angela Davis; unsuc-
cessfully trying to persuade the Pitt
Student Government through a peti-
tion campaign to publicly investi-
gate rising tuition costs at the Univ-
ersity; supporting the lettuce boy-
cott of the United Farmworkers’
Union; and, organizing a well-
attended and lively debate between
RSU and the conservative Young
Americans for Freedom.

RSU placed great emphasis on
education. A number of columns
and letters were submitted to the
Pitt News, two interesting pam~
phlets were produced (The Evolu-
tion of SDS, and The University in
Society: A Critique and Program). A
weekly literature table was main-
tained, and an ambitious films-
and—speakers program was pre-
sented. Among those who spoke
were: Philip Foner, noted labor his-
torian; Edward Boorstein, formerly
an economist for Cuba’s revolution-
ary government; Black Communist
leader Charlene Mitchell; Black Trot-

skyist spokesman Paul Boutelle; the
widely-known Marxist economists
and editors of the Monthly Review
Paul Sweezy and Harry Magdoff; Hal
Draper, author of Berkeley: The
New Student Revolt, and The Two
Souls of Socialism; pacifists Ron and
Trudi Young, who had recently tra-
velled to Viet Nam; James Wein-
stein, socialist author; Paul Buhle,
editor of Radical America; and Dr.
George Haggar, an authority on
Arab revolutionary movements.
There was also a panel of local trade
unionists, and a platform was pro-
vided for electoral candidates of the
Socialist Labor Party and the Soci-
alist Workers Party.

There were still other activities,
but by the winter of 1971 the natural
pattern of University life — people
graduating, moving out of town, and
becoming absorbed in academic and
personal pursuits — had brought the
organizations membership down
from thirty dues-paying members (in
early 1970) to no more than eight
activists. Yet certain RSU members
were able to make important contri-
butions to the People's Peace Treaty
campaign and other peace and free-
dom activities.

The continued vitality of RSU
depends now upon an influx of new
members. Governed by a rigorous
internal democracy, with room for a
wide range of differences among its
membership, the organization can
only be what it has always been —
what its members choose to make
it. Irrespective of its future, there
can be little doubt that the Revolu-
tionary Socialist Union has not only
contributed to the vitality of campus
life, but has also — more modestly,
unfortunately — contributed to the
struggle against war and injustice.

Cynics frequently point out, since
the Socialist Revolution hasn't oc-
curred, groups like RSU are ob-
viously absurd and irrelevant. Similar
jibes were aimed at the Sons and
Daughters of Liberty in 1771, but five
years later, the cynics were eating
their words. Let us see what the fu-
ture brings.

 

he University of Pittsburgh
Chapter of Young Americans for
Freedom (YAF) was founded in the
spring of 1969. It grew out of an
organization known as Students for
Conservative Action. The founding
members of that first YAF group be-
lieved that something more than a
study group was sorely needed at
Pitt.

Obviously, the first need of a
university (or of any society) is for
ORDER. It is impossible for a univer-
sity plagued by constant disruptions
to grow and flourish. Columbia has
certainly taught us that.

Hence, to prevent disruption in
the short run, Pitt YAF has obtained
an attorney who will take appropri-
ate legal action against the guilty
parties in time of disruption. In the
past few years, several successful
suits, notably in the states of New
York and Florida, have been brought
by students against either disrupting
campus groups or incompetent and
lax administrators.

Beyond the short run, however,
Pitt YAF is extremely concerned
about the QUALITY of education
the students are getting. Perhaps the
greatest cause of campus unrest has
been the fact that students realize
that their college degree is being
cheapened by relaxed academic
standards, and therefore will be
worth less (or about next to noth-
ing) when they graduate.

In the coming year, Pitt YAF
hopes to make available scholarly
articles on this question by such dis-
tinguished academics as Professor
Steven Tonsar of the University of
Michigan and Dr. Russell Kirk. In
addition, Pitt YAF will be offering
from time to time suggestions on
how the state of higher education
could be improved.

The second major area of concern
deals with issues that affect the lives
of Pitt students. Two examples in-
clude the activities fee and the pres-
ent student government.

YAF believes that students should
have some control over how much
money is taken out of their pockets
to support organizations that they
have little or no interest in. Such
:ontro| is imperative this year.

Likewise, the credibility of the
present student government is ques-
zionable. There have been reports of
widespread corruption involving
;tudent funds and activity money.
YAF intends to examine this ques-
iion thoroughly.

The final area of YAF activity at
’itt concerns the presentation of
another point of view — the conser-
/ative viewpoint. As with most of
:oday’s universities, Pitt's ”atmo—
;phere”, including all of its compo-
nents — teachers, books, and ”zeit—

geist” — leans heavily to the left. As
a result, Pitt students obtain a dis-
torted picture of anyone to the right
of Allard Lowenstein

YAF’s position is to explain the
alternatives to big government, so-
cial engineering and Isolationism. In
the past this has consisted of distri-
buting literature sponsoring speak-
ers, and writing articles for the Pitt
News.

YAF has helped sponsor such per-
sonalities as William F. Buckley, Jr.,
Dan Jay, editor of YAF’s monthly
magazine The New Guard (in a

debate with Leonard Weinglass
co—counsel for the ”Chicago 7"),
Congressman Philip Crane, and free
market economist Professor Hans F.
Sennholz. This year, Pitt YAF hopes
to have a monthly program of
speakers and films to acquaint Pitt
students with the foundations of a
free society.

Pitt YAF has an outstanding calen-
dar of events planned for this year.
Students who believe that America
is worth saving and defending
should seriously consider joining
Young Americans for Freedom.

During the past year the use of

drugs by students on campus has
become an increasingly controver-
sial issue. Mounting public concern
over the subject — largely the result
of increased attention by national
and local news media - has raised
the hue and cry to well within the
earshot of Harrisburg lawmakers
(who are not known for their reti-
cence on the issue). And one might
rightly suppose that the University
administration is no less concerned
about the ”problem” for all that's
being said about it in the public
forum. In view of so much discus-
sion concerning the ”drug problem”
on our campus it seems important
to first of all try to determine the
extent to which drugs are in fact a
problem at Pitt. To what degree
have drugs become a part of cam-
pus life? What kinds of drugs are
involved? Too often these important
ancillary questions are dismissed in
the public forum as dilatory or un-
necessary. Yet if, as we are constantly
reminded, it is important to place
our views on other major national
issues such as the Cambodian incur-
sion or environmental pollution ”in
perspective," is it not proper to do
so when considering this equally
significant issue? Indeed, only by so
doing can we arrive at a true assess-
ment of the ”drug problem” at Pitt
and how it relates to various seg-
ments of the University community
and the general public.

 

To better understand exactly what
the drug problem is at Pitt it would
be helpful initially to review its brief
history as a campus social phenome-
non. Drug usage first became no-
ticeable on campus about three
years ago. While there are no avail-
able statistics covering this early pe-
riod, the fact remains that it was
easy enough to recognize the tight
knit group of ”freaks” who congre-
gated 24 hours a day in the Tower B
lounge area. It was common knowl-
edge that this clique consisted of
buyers and users of marijuana, hash-
ish and other mild intoxicants. At
this time the group was still small
and self-contained. The people
within it all knew and trusted one
another, a drug arrest was almost
unheard of. The major change in the
University drug scene began in the
fall of 1968. it happened that the
price of marijuana rose from be-
tween $12 and $15 to between $15
and $20 an ounce. This was due in
the main to a government crack-
down on cannabis and ampheta-
mine drug traffic. As the cost of
grass went up, so did the availability
of pills — i.e. hallucinogens, am-
phetamines and barbiturates.
Whether due to the mere prolifera-
tion of the drug culture itself, the
excitement of violating drug prohi-
bition, or other factors, the -use of
these mild (this adjective will be
qualified presently) drugs grew in-
creasingly pervasive. Which is only
to say that no longer was the eu-
phoric aroma of burning cannabis
confined to hidden conclaves within
the towers, but was now to be no-
ticed spicing the equally distinctive
odor of the exerted human body in
ocal locker rooms or thickening the
already near opaque cloud of nico-
tine smoke commonly used as a
substitute for air in the social rooms
3f Bayard street. The point is that by
:his time (1969-70) the ranks of Pitt
Jot smokers had greatly multiplied
and diversified since the early Tower
3 days, drawing its numbers from a
/irtual cross—section of the Univer-
;ity community: Greeks, jocks, some
"acuity, and even a few administra-

tors had at least tried marijuana
once.

By the fall of 1970, drug traffic was
at its height. That winter saw the
first significant influx of narcotics
agents (or ”narcs”) onto campus.
Due to rumors, a few arrests, and
constant warnings via the news
media, paranoia among drug users
ran high. However, government at-
tempts to halt the flow of narcotics
on campus by planting narcs proved
for the most part unsuccessful. Para-
noia drove everybody deep under-
ground. So, if you were heard shoot-
ing off your mouth in Tower 8
about dope you were either recog-
nized as either a narc or a damn fool.
During the past year approximately
30 drug arrests were made. Prior to
the winter term of 1971, the campus
police had never made a bust. Dur-
ing that term, they arrested seven
students for violation of the Danger-

ous Drugs and Cosmetics Act. Ar-
rests by Pittsburgh police prior to
this year were relatively few. Just
before final exams, 22 more students
were arrested for drug related viola-
tions. But presently many hundreds
of people in the University commu-
nity continue to smoke pot or other-
wise play synthetic mind games.
After acquiring a better under-
standing of the extent of drug use
on campus and resultant administra-
tive-governmental attempts to cur-
tail same, it is particularly important
to identify the specific drugs in use.
Again, it is common knowledge that
for the vast majority of heads at Pitt
(a good estimate might run between
85% and 95% -— but this, of course, is
only an estimate) the drug experi-
ence involves nothing more than
social pot smoking and an occa-
sional visit to the mind’s romper
room through one hallucinogenic

door or another. Now, at this junc—
ture an important distinction must
be made between relatively mild
narcotics such as pot, hashish and
certain types of speed and the
so—called ”hard” drugs such as her-
oin, cocaine, and methadone (the
heaviest speed trip). This distinction
is not to be taken as a polemic for
or against the danger and/or desira-
bility of either the former or latter
group, but only to indicate that hard
drug users on campus amount to a
tiny minority of the drug consumer
population. And it is not unreason-
able to assume that exact statistical
analysis, if available, would show
that the percentage of smack
(heroin) freaks in the University
community might be less but would
certainly not exceed that of extra-
University social group of a com-
parable age bracket such as white or
blue collar workers.

Thus far we have not said much
about the various types of speed
which along with the cannabis
drugs and hallucinogens seem to
keep 85% to 90% of Pitt heads
happy. Speed (usually the milder
Benzedrine or Dexedrine) is used
extensively at mid—term and final

examination time to aid students in
their last ditch attempt to cram 14
weeks of material into two or three
days. Interestingly, many speeders
who otherwise claim abstention and
personal condemnation of ‘drug use
will rationalize their use of ampheta-
mine as being necessary for the
good of their education. They are all
too willing to make an ethical ex-
ception in the name of the
a|l—mighty Q.P.A., but are unwilling
to consider the possibility that drug
use for others might have as deep a
learning significance in a way totally
distinct from tests, grades and
competition.

But, our purpose here is not to
arrive at a moral judgement on the
use of drugs, ”mild” or ”hard;” even
if it were, we would first have to
answer our original question,
namely: to what extent is drug usage
on campus a social problem or sick-
ness, if you would prefer? Well,
given the facts that a) very, very few
people (if anybody) at Pitt have
O.D.’d on smack recently, and b)
that virtually everybody seems to
remain healthy enough to hop the
first plane, train, bus or donkey cart
leaving Pittsburgh after the Winter

term (true, an isolated case of Blacl
Lung may turn up here and there a:
a result of breathing our] & L air)
one is still left with a big smogg‘
question mark as to the drug prob
lem at Pitt.

not occur naturally, then logii
would identify it as synthetic . .

Pittsburgh is an established an:

as the traditional hip flask.

There are both internal and exter-
nal dimensions to the character of
an urban university such as Pitt. In-
ternally, there is little, if any, agree-
ment as to what should be consid-
ered acceptable or unacceptable
behavior. As long as large numbers
of people hold different values with
respect to how they should behave,
a rule designed to hold everybody
to the same line will have little
public support. As long as large
numbers of people express different
modes of behavior, the possibility of
enforcing any rule is greatly re-
duced.

Externally, an urban university
cannot be separated from the streets
of the city of which it is a part, nor
can it shut itself off from the larger
world of communications to which
it is integrally tied. These dimen-
sions serve to highlight what may be
considered the two most critical
”security” problems at the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh, and the role of
any administration — of which the
Campus Police are a significant part
— in attempting to deal with them.
The problems are street violence
and drugs, and the fundamentally
urban nature of the campus renders
them insoluble by administrative
action.

The Campus Police exemplify as
clearly as possible the administra-
tion ideal of the ”service agent.”
Policemen, like administrators, are
there to help students and faculty
when called upon to respond. Their
function is primarily to maintain
order and there is little else they can
do except plan their strategy for the
impending riot or mass arrest. This
situation will remain as it is now so
long as there are large numbers of
people expressing widely different
values and behaviors, and there is
every reason to expect that this will
be so.

Editor’s Introduction:

In 7968 the University adopted a

Master Plan which outlined its
physical growth for the next seven-
teen years, and, while the Universi-
ty’s architects worked very closely
with the City of Pittsburgh and its
Planning Department in drawing up
the Plan, Pitt did not make any real
effort to actively involve the sur-
rounding Oakland community in the
planning process. There was nothing
illegal or even unusual about this
omission — the University assumed
that Oakland was being represented
by the City, and this was a reflection

   

    
 

:.-'4’;

"//’ 

of the urban political climate which
existed in Pittsburgh and elsewhere
during 7966 and 7967, which was
when the planning was going on.
Pitt did call a meeting to which the
Oakland community, through its
Model Cities office, was invited, in
order to present to them their
finished proposal. At this time, there
was no organized opposition to

what the University wanted to do,
and things began to move along.
The acquisition of properties on
which Pitt wanted to build took up
most of 7968 and 7969, and in 7970
the University announced its inten-

  

tion to proceed with its plans for
the building of a Hillside Dormitory
Complex, a Learning Research and
Development Center (LRDC), and
the demolition of Forbes Field and
construction of Forbes Phase I
(which included buildings for the
Schools of Law and Education, and
the Departments of the Social Sci-
ences). However, Pitt ran into some-
thing which it was not really unpre-
pared for, but which it deeply
wished to avoid — a group of citi-
zens who felt like protesting, and
protesting with strength. Pitt was
never secretive about its expansion
plans — the point is that the plans
were Pitt’s and Pitt’s alone.

It is no longer appropriate for
giant institutions, like universities, to
deal solely with City Hall and then
devour the people living around
them. Community input into deci-
sion-making processes is now a vi-
tally important urban political issue,
and the current City administration
is very sensitive to the need for
communities to have a voice, at
least, in what goes up and what
comes down. The Pittsburgh City
Planning Commission must approve
everything that Pitt wants to build,
and they have notified the Univer-
sity that they would not be recep-
tive to any proposals unless the resi-
dents of Oakland got a chance to
express themselves.

It is an important change that
people are listening, but a far more
important change that Oakland has
something to say. The Oakland
community’s new found strength
and expressiveness derives largely
from the concern a group of ”ex-
perts,” primarily architects and
community organizers, have shown
for the area's future. Until someone
could interpret what the long-range
effects of the University's plans
might be, and, more crucially, put
forth an alternate proposal for de-
velopment, Oakland residents had
little hope of stopping or redirecting
Pitt except by blocking the bulldoz-
ers when they came. Nobody
wanted such a confrontation.

The action of the Planning Com-
mission led to a series of meetings

attended by representatives of the
University, the City, and residents of
the Oakland community. One con-
cern which pervaded the atmo-
sphere was the question of who the
group of Oakland residents, and in
particular the group calling them-
selves ”Peop/es Oakland,” really
represented. The University felt that
these people were speaking only as
individuals, and that no one present
at the meetings could speak for the
entire area. The City, which acted as
the umpire during these negotia-
tions (in addition to having their
own vested interests), played a deci-
sive role in settling this question by
taking the position that whoever
showed up to speak for Oakland
would be considered legitimate, and
that no more rigorous test need (or
could) be applied to judge who was
really ”representative” of the whole.

The University made its position
clear at the beginning. The Hillside
Dormitory Complex, the LRDC
building, and the demolition of
Forbes Field and construction of
Forbes Phase I were ”non—
negotiable.” Everything else (there
were Forbes Phases II, III, and
IV, and a number of other plans)
was open for discussion. The com-
munity disagreed. The Hillside
Dorms was the first project to come
under fire — at issue were the archi-
tectural and social impact of the
originally planned high—rise struc-
tures upon the neighborhood, and
the effect of large numbers of stu-
dents and their cars upon existing
traffic patterns. The result of this
opposition was that a formerly
non-negotiable University project
was opened up for discussion, and
architects representing Pitt and Peo-
ples Oakland began meeting to plan
something out together.

While the University was able to
accommodate the community's
viewpoint on the dormitory issue,
and the community did not think
that the LRDC building would cause
too much disruption, the Universi-
ty’s desire to demolish Forbes Field
and continue with the planned con-
struction on that site generated and
sustained a tremendous amount of

controversy, and primarily for three
reasons. Firstly, the planned con-
struction would involve the removal
of the homes of a number of resi-
dents living in the area. Secondly,
the University planned to build a
parking lot on Oakland Avenue,
which would serve as a boundary
between itself and the community.
The community charged that the
construction of this parking lot
would increase the amount of traffic
using the side streets of the neigh-
borhood so much that the remain-
ing residents would be forced to
move out because their section
would become noisier, more dan-
gerous, and a much less pleasant
place to live. Third/y, and the reason
which seemed to mean the most to
the professional people involved,
was that Forbes Field is the structure
which separates the University from
the surrounding community, and it
is an architectural ”interface” in that
it borders on both worlds. The
community felt that the stadium
should not be torn down, and that it
be rehabilitated into the kind of
structure which would serve both
the University and the people of
Oakland, and act as a symbol of
mutual respect and cooperation.

The position of the University
with respect to the demolition of
Forbes Field and Phase I construc-
tion is largely determined by its own
inertia. It is not that Pitt is evil, or
that it thinks the Peoples Oak/and
proposal, especially the assertion
that all of the University’s planned
expansion through 7985 can be ac-
commodated within the existing
boundaries, is not as good as its
own scheme. It is rather that Pitt
already has what it considers to be a
good plan, and, perhaps more im-
portantly, it has all the financing ar-
rangements worked out. To delay
much longer, or, to alter the plans,
might possibly jeopardize such ar-
rangements — the University simply
feels it is too far committed to
Forbes Phase I to back down. In
addition, Pitt has been ordered by
the City to either demolish the sta-
dium or to make it safe, and to do
this immediately because as it

stands now, it is a hazard. For a
school which is in debt and in a
constant state of financial crisis, to
secure Forbes Field is a relatively
expensive thing.

The City, in addition to attempt-
ing to manage this conflict, also has
some thoughts floating around. The
University of Pittsburgh is a
tax-exempt institution, and the ma-
jor local source of revenue is the
property tax. For every additional
piece of land Pitt gobbles up, that
means less taxable property for the
City government and the School
District, and the City is also in a very
tight financial squeeze. Therefore,
the City may grant Pitt permission to
expand only if an agreement is
worked out by which the University
pays back the City for the taxable
property it takes away.

Such, then, are some of the posi-
tions taken by and the pressures act-
ing upon the three major groups
concerned with the future plans of
the University of Pittsburgh.
Whether or not Forbes Field is de-
molished depends on the success or
failure of the community in finding
someone to buy the stadium and
develop it the way they want before
the University rips it down. If the
community can do so, then Pitt will
rent the space it needs from the
people of Oakland.

* * *

Pitt has become inseparably in-
volved with the people around it,
and the ivory tower has come to
learn that community relations is a
very complex affair. One of the most
important elements in these rela-
tionships is the way in which the
participants perceive each other,
and it is possible to understand
these perceptions by consulting
people who are outside the Univer-
sity, but must deal with it directly.
The article that follows, then, is
written by the members of Peoples
Oakland, and it is presented in the
belief that all the members of the
University of Pittsburgh community
can benefit from knowing what the
people around them are thinking
and feeling, and how this institution
is affecting them.

hat is it about a ”neighbor-
hood” that people should want to
preserve it? Perhaps, most simply, it
can be a good place in which to
live. This does not necessarily mean
modern houses, new schools, or
wel|—groomed parks. Instead, a good
neighborhood is one in which the
residents feel secure —— they know
that the homes they have worked
for belong to them, to be cared for
and enjoyed, and that the streets are
comparatively safe. It is an environ-
ment in which people are comfort-
able — an area that is stable, famil-
iar, friendly, convenient, and varied.
To the permanent residents of the
area, Oakland is such a neighbor-
hood. They have found it a good
place in which to live and raise fam-
ilies. True, some of the houses
need repair, playgrounds are scarce,
and the traffic situation is bad. Still,
the area provides good living spaces
at reasonable prices, combined with
a rich network of interpersonal rela-
tionships that have grown up among
long-term residents. In addition,
Oakland has always had a unique
diversity, providing not only a
patchwork of racial and ethnic
groups, young people, families and
elder citizens; but, also it offers a
mixture of residential, institutional,
and commercial facilities. This vari-
ety, both in people and physical
structure, is, ideally, what a city is all
about.

The University of Pittsburgh cer-
tainly plays a vital role in the Oak-
land community, although its exis-
tence in the area has always been
somewhat of a mixed blessing. On
the one hand, it has a beneﬁcial
effect on the local job market and
income level, on commercial enter-
prise, and on the cultural develop-
ment of the area ~ as well as
offering, to some degree, Univer-
sity—related expertise in such fields
as health, elementary education, etc.
On the other hand, the University
has also been a winning competitor
for the minimal amount of usable
land, housing, overburdened recrea-
tional facilities, and circulation. It
also means that fully one-third of
the area's population is transient —
uncommitted to the ideals of an
urban neighborhood. Finally, the
University’s Master Plan for expan-
sion is presently threatening the
very existence of the Oakland resi-
dential sector. Peoples Oakland,
a residents’ organization which
emerged in response to this threat,
is attempting to give citizens a voice
in the planning of their own com-
munity. It is also an effort to pre-
serve Oakland as a neighborhood in
which a variety of people, buildings,
and purposes can co-exist.

The effects of the University Mas-
ter Plan on Oakland could well be
disastrous. ‘Imagine, for a moment,
Oakland as the University has
planned it. Stretching along Forbes
Avenue, to Oakland Avenue, down
to Bates Street, and in between,
large white concrete buildings, en-
closing well-kept concrete prome-
nades. Think of the Hillman Library
multiplied by ten, one next to the
other, facing the delicate houses
across the street. Now, if you were
to walk along the streets as they
presently exist, you would see a
crazy mixture of Forbes Field,
houses in dozens of styles, stores,
gardens with flowers, restaurants.

. The demolition of this area is
the most obvious neighborhood
loss.

The most destructive effects,
however, are the more subtle ones,
which are already beginning to prey
on the Oakland neighborhood. To
begin with, any sign of demolition
in the area will tell the local resi-
dents that they have lost — that they
cannot possibly stand against such a
large institution. They will have no
assurance about the security of their
property, and will lose what little
faith they had in the joint planning
process monitored by the city. This
will permit GSA (General State Au-
thority) to buy up properties more
easily, as residents will try to make
the best of a situation which they
think can end only in their being
forced out, with or without ade-
quate compensation.

Furthermore, residents, expecting
to be forced to leave soon, will de-
fer maintenance on their property.
This condition is presently develop-
ing. The resulting instability will
encourage onlookers and the city to
favor demolition.

Several public servants and edito-
rial voices have advanced the alarm-
ingly destructive view that the local
residential area is visibly substandard
and the Forbes Field is an ugly, dirty,
old hovel infested by rats, and that
both should be torn down as soon
as possible since they are in the way
of progress, better education, jobs,
etc. These people do not seem to
acknowledge that the deterioration
of the area is almost entirely due to
the residents’ uncertainty about
their future and their unwillingness
to invest in renovation while that
uncertainty exists. It also needs to be
recognized that the everything-old-
must—go view of the world has pro-
duced the Lower Hill, the East Liberty
renewal, the North Side Allegheny
Center and, in the immediate area,
large tracts of scarred, barren land-
scape, which were intended for Uni-
versity recreation. Security problems
in the vicinity of these playing fields
prevent their use, and have resulted
in escalated security measures. If
long-term resident families are forced
to move out of the central Oakland
area, similar security problems can be
expected to result.

Finally, the increased instability in
the residential neighborhood will
encourage private speculators to
move in and purchase properties for
higher density housing with luxury
rental scales — an already visible
occurrence. These developers can
afford to take financial risks that the
residents cannot, and they stand to
make such a good profit in a short
time that even the prospect of de-
molition in a few years does not
deter them.

This quick-renovation process,
welcomed by local government for
the added revenues yielded by rising
property assessments, results in
pushing other long—term residents
out. These residents will leave either
voluntarily (”the place isn’t what it
used to be”), or involuntarily, as
speculators evict old tenants prior to
renovation. The incoming transient
population which will occupy these
houses will not have the commit-
ment or interest to try and prevent
further institutional expansion.

What, in all this, are the implica-
tions for the University itself? Essen-
tially, universities are for students.
Most students at the University are
at a critical point in their lives,
where they are trying to discover
how they are going to fit into a very
complex, fiercely competitive, and,
to many, extremely hostile society,
offering only selected avenues of
success. Since these prescribed ave-
nues are unpalatable to many, the
University should offer opportuni-
ties to deal with the resulting
conflicts.

In order to accomplish this, we
have been told over and over that
the university must become ’’rele—
vant.” lt is extremely difficult for a
student in the social sciences, who
is learning how groups of people
with different skills and interests
benefit or hinder each other’s lives,
to come to terms with the knowl-
edge that, by his being at the uni-
versity, he might well be contributing
to the destruction of a real-life
community. Or, to put it more
bluntly, those same people who are
teaching him about peaceful coex-
istence, etc., are pushing for the

mass demolition of a neighborhood
in order to expand their depart-
ments. University departments must
realize that society is not sanction-
ing and paying them merely to exist
for their own good; rather, they are
there to help young people see the
various life styles open to them, and
contribute toward each student's
becoming a constructive member of
society.

Many students are actually at the
university for reasons other than to
study abstract ideas, i.e. to avoid the
draft or get a degree. For many, the
university period is an emotional
transition from being supported as a
child to becoming a self-supporting,
functioning adult within society.
The type of campus life which re-
volves solely around lectures, dormi-
tories, student plazas and the like, is
not providing the student with the
tools to deal with what is going to
be done after graduation.

Being realistic about these things,
most abstract intellectual discussion,
lectures, etc. are of little use to the
student, unless one has the oppor-
tunity to experience their effects in
the context of every—day life — in a
normal community of people who
have discovered how to cope. For
years, this has been stated as the
main advantage of an urban univer-
sity, where abstract ideas are placed
into the nucleus of society. What
use is that idea if the presence of
the university is so parasitic as to
destroy the urban context that
makes it worthwhile? It is obvious
that the mutal benefits to be derived
from a university in a city depend
on a delicate balance in the func-
tioning of these two parts. In other
words, the relationship must be one
of symbiosis, and this depends on a
working interface more than any-
thing else.

While the need for more student
housing, teaching space, and park-
ing is self-evident, the University's
solution to these problems is, at
best, conventional, and, more likely,
self-defeating. A plan such as Forbes
Phase I, which projects a Law
School, Social Sciences complex,
and plus graduate school of Educa-

tion (to be joined by additional
graduate and professional schools in
later phases), can only increase the
sense of unreality and frustration
that so many students are faced
with. The buildings themselves, with
their forbidding concrete backs to
the community and sheltered stu-
dent courtyards within, symbolize
all too painfully the process of edu-
cation which is occurring.

Peoples Oakland, however, feels
that there are other viable alterna-
tives — that the University of Pitts-
burgh can choose, instead, to create
a symbiotic relationship with its
urban community, and begin heal-
ing the growing rift between aca-
demia and the rest of society. Oak-
land, though small and perhaps
insignificant, seems a good place to
begin.

The Peoples Oakland proposals
are based on the ideal of harmon-
ious coexistence through mutual
consideration and perhaps, a bit of
daring. Instead of tearing down
Forbes Field, we said, why not turn
it into a symbol of coexistence: a
place where community activities,
university functions, and commer-
cial enterprises could work side by
side. All around the building, open
arches would welcome people in-
side to shops, the farmers market,
and a park on the old Pirate playing
field. The non-commercial ground
floor area might house daycare cen-
ters, a youth center, and other
community-oriented functions. The
upper two stories could be adapted
for a multitude of university func-
tions — from classrooms and offices
to student housing units. Students
and community would have a
chance to mingle and talk as they

-——..-

growth I university expansion & community relations

moved naturally between classes,
stores, meetings, and restaurants, or
took part in mutually—planned
events and festivals.

Of course, the renvoation of
Forbes Field would not supply the
University with all the space it
claimed necessary for Forbes Phase
l. We therefore proceeded to con-
sider how the University’s space
demands could be met, and with
minimal damage to the community.
Discovering that 42% of the existing
campus is open space and usable for
building (much of this is presently
parking space), the following alter-
natives were suggested:

l. There are a series of sites north of Fifth
Avenue which are presently used for
parking. Assuming that the parking is
replaced, these sites are suitable for
University buildings because of their
proximity to the existing facilities. There
may be some land acquisition problems,
but it is difficult to justify buying up res-
idential property just because these
owners have less power than the own-
ers of these more suitable sites.

2. The site between Sennot Street and

Forbes Avenue, next to Common Facili-
ties could be developed as a university
building with second-level bridge con-
nections to the dormitories, Hillman
Library, and the upper levels of Forbes
Field, with its potential classrooms and
housing above commercial and commu-
nity facilities. The Law School, as pres-
ently planned, could be built above the
present bleacher section, with the
outfield as a park, continuous with
Schenley Plaza. There is enough room
on these sites alone to build all of
Forbes Phase l, plus 500 units of hous-

ing.

.The lawns around the Cathedral of

Learning could be developed in a man-
ner similar to the original architect’s
plans. He visualized small courts sur-
rounded by low buildings, in place of
the large fields surrounded by traffic,
which presently exists. There would be
more than enough space for Forbes
Phase I in such buildings.

  
  
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
  

lt was determined that through
maximal use of existing open space,
all university expansion planned
through 1985 (3 million square feet),
could be placed within the present
boundaries at an average building
height of only three stories. While a
few present green areas might be
used for building, total recreational
space would be increased by 50%

In addition, an alternate parking
proposal was presented which
would both spare the residential
area from a devastating traffic in-
crease, and meet University parking
needs.

The University’s decision to locate parking
for Forbes Phase I on Oakland Avenue made
a lot of sense when the Oakland Crosstown
and Bates Street Bypass were supported by
the City for immediate implementation.
However, as they cannot be implemented for
at least ten years, all traffic must go through
the residential area (causing more people to
move out and the area to run down quickly).

What Oakland really needs is immediately
implementable solutions to the traffic prob-
lems, rather than |ong—range plans. There is a
bypass already available through Schenley
Park, which could easily be used for access, if
parking were located under the outfield of
Forbes Field, under Schenley Plaza, under the
Cathedral lawn, and under the present Syria
Mosque and Masonic Temple parking lots.
These areas would provide room for 45(1) cars.

Unfortunately, the University has
not felt it necessary to take commu-
nity needs — or even community
survival — into consideration. Forced
into some negotiations with the
community by the City Planning
Department, the university has
failed to treat the community as
anything but a very bad joke.

The present conflict between the
Oakland community and its large
institutions has potentially at least
four solutions:

1. The institutions may dominate,
and effectively eliminate Oak-
land as a residential area, as the
early urban renewal plans of
the 19605 suggest. This situa-
tion will result if the institu-
tions’ present expansion plans
are carried out.

.The citizens might drive the

University and other institu-
tions out of Oakland; this
seems neither likely nor desir-
able.

. A boundary may be drawn over

which the University may not
step. This solution is favored by
some citizens and the Univer-
sity. However, it is more like an
armistice than a peace treaty. It
is favored by citizens for prag-
matic reasons (it will end the
conflict and ’’settle’’ the ques-
tion), or out of fear (without it
the total domination of Point
#1 will result), and out of the
mistaken belief that such a
boundary will be stable in the
future. It is also favored by in-
stitutions for pragmatic rea-
sons: it permits them to under-
take their current expansion in
a peaceful setting and to post-
pone crossing the bigger
bridges of the future until they
get there. However, this solu-
tion is not, in fact, a stable one
because of the dynamics of in-
stitutional growth, which re-
quire increasing centralization,
bureaucratization, and space.
Beyond this, it is difficult for a
home owner to effectively
oppose the provision of more
education, health, or culture,
especially when these institu-
tions allegedly serve ”the entire
Pittsburgh region,” or ”all of
Pennsylvania.” Finally, the dis-
tribution of power between the
institutions and the home
owners is not exactly equal,
and the results of this inequal-
ity are fairly predictable: the
boundary will change when the
more powerful party wants it
changed.

. The fourth approach involves a

fundamental rethinking of the
relationship between service
institutions and thecommunity
in which are imbedded. It sug-
gests that learning does not
take place only in university
classrooms; that healing does
not occur only in hospitals;

growth I university expansion & community relations

and, that appreciation of cul-
ture is not limited to museums
or symphony halls. It involves a
change in both program and
process such that there is an
intermingling of institutions
and community. Substantial
parts of the programs and ser-
vices of the institutions would
be carried out in the communi-
ties, and citizens would partici-
pate in and contribute to the
development of the institu-
tions. This would entail institu-
tional design which was
”open” and readily accessible,
both physically and socially, to
the members of the commu-
nity. It might also involve a
”change of scale” such that in-
stitutional structures and or-
ganizations were not dominat-
ing and overpowering with
respect to residential activities
and neighborhoods. Multiple-
use structures would be

favored, and utilization of ex-
isting buildings would be en-
couraged. If the community
and institutions could agree to
develop harmoniously, then a
genuine urban interface could
be established. This interface
would not be a physical
boundary, since the parties
would not see themselves as
separate, but as parts of a
growing whole.

It must be apparent that of the
four possibilities, we strongly favor
the last. The first two would be illu-
sory victories, which would only
create sterile institutions or stagnant
communities. The third is only a
temporary solution, and the fear and
mistrust would be allayed only
briefly, as the present situation
clearly indicates. Only a genuine
and cooperative effort to rethink our
joint problems is going to result in a
pleasant and joyous place for peo-
ple to live and work.

Oakland, the

  

land of fun and
sun, where everyday is a holiday,
and students can enjoy a resort—like
atmosphere wherever they choose
to live.” Unfortunately, the Oakland
referred to here is in California. At
Pitt's Oakland, the only comparable
aspects to resort living are in the
rental rates and dorm fees that the
student pays. Regardless of rent or
realty company, living conditions for
apartment students throughout
Oakland are predictable. Among
these are surly caretakers, leaking
radiators, and troops of innocuous
crawling things. Additional features
include treading the luxury of sod-
den indoor—outdoor carpet; enjoying
a single window which faces a wall;
discovering your electric bill in-
cludes the laundry facilities for the
entire building; losing your safety
deposit because the oven blew up
while you were at class  ad
nauseum . . .

Dorm life could easily be com-
pared to living in a large unluxurious

hotel

under the American plan.
ldentical furnishings are to be found
in all rooms, and this uniformity,
especially in the Towers, becomes
extremely monotonous. Rooms de-
rive their individual identities solely
from the decorations. Some students
who are particularly creative can
almost hide the fact that they are
living in a piece of pie or a 50-year
old building.

The main difference between the
apartment dwellers, the dorm dwell-
ers, and the cave dwellers lies in the
responsibilities. Purchasing and pre-
paring food, general housekeeping,
and facing monthly bills are included
in the daily life of the apartment stu-
dent. The dorm student need only
plan far enough ahead to get to the
cafeteria before it closes. The cave
dweller had it best — no rent, no up-
keep, no social rules, and whenever
he got hungry he could go outside
and club a dinosaur over the head.
Unfortunately, Oakland lacks caves
and dinosaurs, so that this life style
cannot be offered.

The comparisons between dorm
and apartment life are enough to
make anyone sick. First, there are
rules. With the liberalization of
dorm social rules, the only require-
ments for students are that they do
not make too much noise, do not
destroy limb or lumber, or break any
civil laws. Apartment people have
similar rules plus several others (like
no more than five guests, no parties,
and no roach killing with hammers)
to act as fudge factors in the event
that the landlord wants to evict the
student or keep the safety deposit.

Service is also comparable. In the
dorms students can scream for re-
pairs for weeks before a mainte-
wance man stumbles into the room
and says: ’’It’s a half—hour to quitting
zime. I'll get it next month.” Apart-
nent students also have to scream
and threaten before the landlord
;ends over Lou, a retired shoe sales-
nan who owns a screwdriver. The
results in both cases are the same

. . learn to live without the repair.
Dne added problem in the apart-
nent is the bugs. When an extermi-
iator finally comes (usually after a
hreat of calling the Health Depart-
nent) he ends up more of a diplo-
nat than a killer. ”These roaches
ive in the basement, they just come

upstairs for meals and to watch
T.V.”

Then there is the security, or the
lack of it. Oakland apartments con-
tain a smorgasbord of assorted
locks and bolts. The ”walk” also
provides a means for studying var-
ious social problems, such as mug-
ging, beating, molesting, exhibiting,
and just plain folk out for an eve-
ning’s fun of terrorizing students.
The dorms also provide an opportu-
nity for sociological and psychologi-
cal studies. Some of Oakland’s finest
thieving operates in the dorms. In
the time it takes to go to the bath-
room and make tinkle, a stereo and
a box of Aunt Tilly’s cookies can
disappear. Women have special
problems, like ”things off the
streets” walking the floors for a
glimpse of flesh. Often, the best
way for a woman resident to meet a
sick man is to take a shower late at
night. He will be the audience.
Dope pushers in South Oakland?
You bet. Dope pushers in the Tower
B lobby? You bet.

But the greatest similarity be-
tween the dorms and the apart-
ments lies in the exploitative rates and
fees. The Big Three landlords in
Oakland are an enterprising trio.
Two of them make it clear that if

one disgruntled tenant isn't satisfied
with his inferior domicile, there
remains a throng of eager custom-
ers. The third will cajole prospective
victims with a hearty handshake and
a slap on the back. A healthier rela-
tionship and a better deal can be
established with private owners in
the area . .. provided, of course,
that you either wear a bra, have
short hair, and are not Black, Orien-
tal, or Indian. The irony of off-
campus housing at Pitt, though,
is that despite the inordinate rents
that student tenants pay, it's cheaper
in the long run than the dorm
charges. Pitt’s housing ranks among
the top ten highest priced in the
country. Administrators cite the ris-
ing costs of maintaining present
services as the cause. They also cite
the occurrence of Venus in line with
Mercury as the cause.

But, in spite of these minor prob-
lems, living at Pitt has provided a
multitude of fond memories
”Remember the time we clobbered
a rat to death with a croquet
mallet?” . . . ”Remember the time
the refrigerator decided to shut off
over Thanksgiving and defrost ‘the
$30 worth of meat?” . . . ”Remem—
ber the guy who attacked me in the
elevator?’’. . .

here was a legend in the dorms
of Pitt, that when the sun went
down and the moon came up
(owww) and the clock struck curfew
(gong! gong!) that weird and treach-
erous creatures of the night stalked
the campus (stomp . . . stomp . . .
stomp). There were also evil spirits
that would take over the minds of
young women and men and com-
pletely strip them of all moral fiber
(screechl). For that reason men and
women were separated at curfew
hour and the women were locked
securely into their chambers. But
evil spirits being what they were
had no specific hours of work and
would sometimes creep in the stu-
dents’ souls before curfew (gasp!)
and cause them to do gross things.
There was only one defense against
this force of evil. That was the exis-
tence of certain social rules and resi-
dent assistants to enforce them
(yayl). They were that thin line be-
tween morality and chaos. But even
with rules and curfews and resident
assistants, grossness did occur
(boool). For instance, the door was
to be opened the width of a book,
and a light must be on and the flesh
was not to be exposed. But often
the devil himself would be at work
within the students, stretching and
twisting their moral pillars. It was
not uncommon for the door to be

closed upon a matchbook with the
black light turned on, and flesh
meeting flesh underneath the gar-
ments.

 

 

In 1969, though, the Men’s Dorm
Council and Women’s Housing
Board met and decided to take posi-
tive action to rid the campus of the
evilness. Perhaps they saw the an-
nual spring rites in which hundreds
of students participate in chants for
silk and female undergarments, as a
yearly release and evil spirit chaser.
Having participated in one such rite
(for purely academic purposes) I
witnessed the mass of students-
turned savage as they chased the

devil from themselves. One rather
huge brassiere fell at my feet. Cur-
ious as to the motives of its be-
ing hurled into the quad, I sought
to finds its owner for the next six
months. This year there was no ”rite
of spring”, indicating that the stu-
dents’ souls have already been
sufficiently purged. But, anyhow,
changes were instituted and with
the devil seemingly gone, doors
were allowed to be secured with
representatives of both sexes inside
probably studying; and they could

be there all night. The hero here is

housing I life styles

democracy, for it was decided that
each living unit should decide its
own visitation hours and curfews.
As a result, most dorms and dorm
houses chose 24 hour open houses
and, naturally, no curfews. But one
might ask if voting on bedtimes and
visitation might be stretching de-
mocracy too far. The RA. has now
become more of an administrator
and information source. Their duties
are not to uphold a moral standard,
but to watch the mainenance, keep
peace, help out in emergencies and
try to be a friend.

Campus Report on the Occur-
rence of Crossness (excerpt from
page 138, paragraph 8). — After the
eviction of the evil grossness-
causing forces from the Pitt Campus,
the social rules were relaxed. That
was the test; if more grossness oc-
curred, then evil still existed. Upon
completion of our research (by
barging into random rooms across
the campus) we found no appreci-
able increase, As a matter of fact,
with the knowledge of the new
freedom, students felt no need to
”get in as much time together as
possible,” and would say goodnight
much earlier than with curfew.

So our story ends. Evil has lost
once again to open-mindedness and
the expansion of the university ex-
perience.

co—ed dorms

 

he living quarters and rules of
conduct for college dormitories
have traditionally been modeled
after the medieval monastic system:
long halls leading to tiny rooms with
simple furniture; a housemother or
superior hired to serve as a positive
moral influence; and a ”Bible” of
rules that listed who was allowed
where, when, with whom, and to do
what. Before the late 1960’s, it
seemed as though the twentieth
century would not disturb ”the sys-
tem.” Enter Pitt.

In an attempt to create alternative
university living patterns, the Men’s
Dorm Council, in 1969, proposed a
coed dorm set—up more integrated
than Tower C (with men only on
the first three floors). After meetings
with the Women’s Housing Board
and the Housing Office, the Mc-
Cormick Hall proposal was formu-
lated. The reasons for selecting
McCormick Hall were based on the
convenient suite arrangement, since

in this building men and women.

could live on the same floor in alter-
nating suites. Displacement was

"9-J*té=.»a.; . .

  

minimal as only those girls who
wanted to return to ”male suites”
experienced any kind of inconve-
nience. There was almost no conver-
sion cost in reorganizing the dorm

as each suite is completely self-
contained with bathrooms and kitch-
ens. There were problems, however,
with the McCormick set-up. lt seems
that men do not like large-group
suite arrangements. Instead, they pre-
fer either one or two roommates, or
privacy. Accordingly, the ideal co-ed
arrangement would be on individual
floors in the Towers with the single

   

.‘ Q’ .
.,.»7""~r,~ 

or double room arrangement. The
major problem here would be the
expense of separating the single
bathroom facilities. Also, it might be
necessary to divide the hall so the
men ”can walk around in their
jockey shorts.” This, though, is not a
great problem since most men
choosing the co-ed floors would
realize the need to compromise ex-
hibitionist tendencies.

It seems that many McCormick
residents in its first co-ed year took
the experience as no more than
apartment living on the campus, but

 

reluctant parents feared a ”collegi-
ate Sodom and Gomorrah.” At a
Parents’ Weekend seminar they
questioned administrators about
girls selling themselves in Mc-
Cormick’s halls and other co-ed
myths. But the real results this year
concern the de-emphasis of the
traditional sex roles of college stu-
dents and emphasized the students’
individuality and uniqueness. Pla-
tonic relationships were more preva-
lent than romantic ones, as residents
interacted without the formality of
dating rituals.

The creation of the co-ed dorm
also necessitated certain changes in
social rules. It seems the co-ed liv-
ing arrangement implied a 24-hour
open—house. The reason for this
concerned the university right for
members of each sex to visit at any
hour. There could be no regulating
this in McCormick, therefore, any
person of any sex could visit any
person, any sex. Understand? This,
then, set a precedent for the entire
university.

As for the future, there are no
plans to end McCormick, nor are
there any to expand the coeduca-
tional pattern in existing facilities.
Instead McCormick will be used to
experiment with new ideas in uni-
versity services such as separate
placement and 24-hour counseling
centers in the dorm itself. There is
also hope that the students will con-
tinue to create their own services
such as this year’s dorm newspaper.
But, perhaps, the most important
testimony to the success of the
co-ed dorm is the 54% rate of return,
the highest on campus (and much
of the loss that did occur was due to
the graduating seniors).

So, in a natural atmosphere of
trust and acceptance, McCormick
Hall is a new breed of dormitory —
one emphasizing the humanity of
the opposite sex.

 

leven years ago when the Towers
first opened, resident students re-
ceived an hyper-acidic introduction
to the culinary charms of Saga Food.
Since its initiation on the Pitt cam-
pus, Saga food and its reputation
have suffered a steady decline. The
increasing distaste among students
for Saga cuisine and a little politick—
ing on the part of the Housing
Office administrators culminated
this year with a loss of contract by
the much maligned food service.
Similarly disenchanted, Chatham
and Carlow College also terminated
contracts with Saga. With the deci-
sion to fire Saga, the University was
faced with selecting a new contract
caterer to operate its food service
which extends to both the boarding
and non—boarding cafeterias, snack
bars, and vending areas.

Members of the University's Food
Service Committee travelled to a
variety of campuses across the
country soliciting student opinions
on the food services which had
submitted bids. Serious considera-
tion of the survey findings resulted
in the selection of Szabo Food Ser-
vice. Another important factor in the
decision was the fact that the
financial bid of Szabo proved much
more attractive than the one offered
by Saga. Where Saga intended to
retain a 5% basic profit, Szabo
agreed to a maximum 3% basic
profit. Where Saga consented to de-
liver 50% of income beyond the 5%
to the University, Szabo agreed to
give the University 80% beyond the
3%.

According to Szabo executives,
the company's top priority is satis-
factory service to its customers. The
new food service has pledged to
conduct two polls a year to find out
which foods students prefer. Szabo
has also committed itself to improv-
ing service to commuters by upgrad-
ing the Hunt Room and the Tuck
Shop. Expansion of service in these
areas will include the installation of
”Henny Penny” fried chicken cen-
ters, in hopes of offering students
the same vareity of choices available
at fast-food restaurants on campus.
Other palate pleasers include
monthly ”spirit |ifters”, meals like a
Hawaiian luau, which would be
complete with appropriate decor
and menu.

Szabo executives are enthused at
the prospect of serving students.
Nothing humdrum about the com-
pany, they claim, which finds ”ro—
mance in a garbage pail.”

ln the spring of 1970, a
sub—committee of the Resident Food
Service Committee began to survey
other colleges and universities for
the purpose of gathering ideas for a
new food service proposal.

It was discovered that larger
schools seem to lean towards a sin-
gle option full board plan as op-
nosed to a variety of meal ticket
orograms. Although a variety of
rneal tickets will be available to stu-

K .

dents this fall, Housing Director
John Vrana has stated that foregoing
the mandatory meal ticket for resi-
dent students, though possible
sometime in the future, would not
be feasible at present because of the
difficulty the University would face
in meeting overhead costs. A new
option has been created for commu-
ters — come fall, a meal ticket for
dinner in the Towers seven nights a
week may be purchased.

The sub—committee survey also
indicated a trend, especially among
larger schools with increasing resi-
dent populations, towards the oper-
ation -of a university food service,
rather than the use of an outside
contract caterer. Because of the de-
creased expense involved, there is a

high degree of probability that Pitt
will soon choose to operate its own
facilities.

Regardless of the projected excel-
lence of Szabo food, the chances are
that any marked difference between
the two companies will be purely
psychological. The facts remain that
Szabo, working with the same facili-
ties, staff and budget that Saga
maintained, must feed a mass of
5000 students daily, and this makes
any improvement in the quality of
food highly improbable. So, if Szabo
can make students feel they're get-

ting their money’s worth, through‘

more special days, a pleasant atmo-
sphere and friendlier service, the
changing of the guard will have
been a success.

 

U -V-ith the establishment of student

judicial boards a few years ago, stu-
dents assumed the ultimate respon-
sibility for their own actions.

Student judicial boards had ex-
isted for some years, but none of
them guaranteed the rights of stu-
dents as citizens. ln the fall of 1968,
the first student demands for proce-
dural rights were heard when the
creation of a new Men’s Residence
Hall Judicial Board seemed immi-
nent. Certain groups of students
demanded that its bylaws be ex-
panded to include procedural rights
for students, the most important
being the right to be considered
innocent until the accuser proves
guilt. Previously, the student, once
charged, had to prove that he was
not guilty. Once these rights were
incorporated into /vlen’s Residence
Hall Judicial Board, they became
accepted and were soon adopted by
the other existing boards.

For the most part, student boards
heard cases involving ordinary viola-
tions of such regulations as curfew
or quiet hours, but in 1969, an im-
portant case appeared which was to
determine the viability of the stu-
dent judicial system. That March,
the Housing Office expelled four
students from the dorms because of
their conduct during the spring riot.
They, in turn, appealed their case to
Dean Pease. However, other con-
cerned students intervened at this
point and indicated that he could
not hear the appeal. They insisted
that neither the Housing Office nor
the Dean could decide guilt or im-
pose punishment without a prior
hearing before a student judicial
board. Dean Pease then informed
the Housing Office to withdraw
their punishment and the cases
were sent to the appropriate boards.
As a result of this, the legitimacy of
student boards was established.

A series of structural changes be-
gan in 1969 when the Women’s Resi-
dence Hall Judicial Board, which
was formerly part of the Dean of
Women’s Office, and the Men’s Resi-
dence Hall Judicial Board, a part of
Mens’ Dorm Council, were brought

 

under the auspices of the Housing
Office. At that time, Women’s ludi-
cial Board, Men’s Judicial Review
Board, an organizational Publica-
tion’s Board, and a University Re-
view Board existed in addition to the
previously mentioned Men's and
Women’s Residence Hall Judicial
Boards. The new reorganization was
designed to place the student
boards under their appropriate ad-
ministrative area. What resulted was
a lot of confusion. Since little was
actually written or precisely decided
upon, the functioning of the system
remained uncoordinated and the
appellate system was jumbled and
slow.

ln 1970-1 procedures were made
more explicit when the Men’s and
Women’s Residence Hall Judicial

Boards examined their by-laws and
expanded them to achieve greater
clarity and finalize procedures in-
volved in any hearing.

A much talked about issue during
this period was the fear that stu-

dents may be subjected to double
jeopardy. The University has never
fully made its intentions clear on
this matter. The policy is this — ”The
University’s authority is not used
merely to duplicate the function of
general laws. But the fact that civil
authorities may prosecute a student
will not prevent the University from
hearing a case and applying a pen-
alty when its own interests are
involved.” This means that a student
who commits an offense in this cate-
gory is not only subject to punitive
action by the civil authorities, but
after these steps have been taken
they are subject to further action by
the University. So far, a student has
never been subject to University ac-
tion in addition to civil action, but
the fact remains that under the pres-
ent University policy it is possible.
More changes and reorganizations
are expected to be put in operation
by Fall, 1971. Among these are the
written compilation of violations
which are under the regulation of all

the judicial boards, a better appellate
system, greater coordination of ac-
tivities under a new administrative
director in charge of jucidial opera-
tions, and the creation of a
non-residence hall students judicial
board with jurisdiction over
non-resident students both on and
off campus. Of course, a student
will still have the option of choosing
to be heard by a judicial board or
the appropriate administrator.

In general, there is a trend to-
wards greater specificity in written
regulations and operations and less
opportunity for interpretation. What
this means is that the power to de-
cide on the definition of a violation
is being shifted from the judicial
boards (who interpret the rules) to
the authors. The role of the student,
then, has shifted from that of de-
manding rights and responsibilities
to that of assuming a more bureau-
cratic and administrative role in judi-
cial and policy making systems that
already exist.

of all the realities which exist in

Oakland, the most seemingly unreal
is that the endearingly shabby area
from Ophelia St. to South Craig is
the greedy, yet ungrateful, asylum
for great numbers of Pitt students.
Year after year, apparently fasci-
nated at the prospect of substandard
living, some four thousand Pitt stu-
dents ensconce themselves in the
tenements of Oakland.

Because there are many more
people seeking apartments than
there are units available, the market
in student housing in Oakland is a
seller's market. Exorbitant rents are
charged for unhealthy, poor quality
living units. According to the real-
tors, high rental charges can be attri-
buted to increasingly steep property
taxes. Although the fact exists that
University expansion, by increasing
the land value in the Oakland area,
has caused a hike in property taxes,
the chances are slim that this ex-
pense on the landlord’s part war-
rants the stiff rents students must
pay. if not much complaining is
heard about the inferior living con-
ditions prevalent in Oakland, it is
due only to the fact that students,
for the most part, consider their
apartments solely as places where
they and their friends can crash.
Things like poor lighting and fire
hazards are usually overlooked.
However, among those students
who were hardest hit with a combi-
nation of high rent, foul living con-
ditions and unresponsive landlords,
the desire to improve the housing
situation in Oakland developed.

This year a small group of irate
tenants banded together under the
auspices of the Student Association
and reactiviated the long-slumbering
Off—Campus Housing Committee.
Since the fade—out of the original
group, the sole recognition of the
problem had been a rather inane
handbook published by the Asso-
ciated Women Students which
sagely predicts that apartment
dwelling ”helps to develop a sense
of responsibility — there's no one to
tell you when to be in, or to eat all
your vegetab|es.” With such a hum-

ble beginning, the crusade for jus-
tice in housing was bound to im-
prove.

The initial goal of the Off—Campus
Housing Committee was set at in-
forming student tenants of min-
imum health codes and their lawful
rights under them, and providing
free legal service. It was realized
that the large number of people
employed in Oakland who also
sought housing in the neighborhood
would preclude the possibility of an
effective tenants union. The Com-
mittee printed a survey in the Pitt
News seeking basic information
about where students lived, how
much rent they paid, who their

landlords were, etc. When a total of
eight responses was received, the
group began to reconsider its tac-
tics. Before a new approach to the
problem could be attempted, how-
ever, a seminar on off—campus hous-
ing was held in the Student Union.

Representatives from most of the
leading realtors in Oakland agreed
to attend, in addition to people
from the Department of Health,
Neighborhood Legal Services, Peo-
ples Oakland and the Department
of Housing and Urban Develop-
ment. Turnout for the seminar was
mediocre, both on the part of stu-
dents and the organizations that had
pledged to participate. In the face
of discouraging defeat, the
Off—Campus Housing Committee
re—evaluated and discarded the role
of a passive disseminator of infor-
mation as its basis for operation,
and embraced the prospect of ac-
tively bringing together students and
their landlords for the purpose of
discussing mutual concerns.

Near the end of Winter Term, a
dialogue was held between three of
Oakland’s major realtors and stu-
dents from the Off—Campus Housing
Committee, Foreign Student Asso-

ciation and the Student Association.
Resulting from the discussion was
the creation of a landlord—tenant
committee which will meet
bi-monthly, come Fall, to decide on
standards for housing conditions
and on prices. In addition, it was
decided to hold frequent rap ses-
sions in the Student Union between
landlords and tenants. As far as the
latter is concerned, the Committee’s
responsibility will lie in personally
contacting student tenants and urg-
ing them to air their grievances with
the landlords.

Throughout all of this student ac-
tivity, the role of the University
administration in dealing with
off—campus housing problems has
been not exactly helpful. However,
in early July, a step in the right di-
rection was taken with the creation
of the Off-Campus Housing Office.
Operating from offices in the Ruskin
Apartments, the Off—Campus Hous-
ing Office plans to compile a sub-
stantially larger and more compre-
hensive listing of available housing
than the one which existed in an
anteroom of the Housing Office. In
addition to assuming the former
position of the Off—Campus Housing
Committee in educating and assis-
ting students in legal matters, the
new Office hopes eventually to es-
tablish a working relationship with
the landlords, reminding them of
health requirements and advising
them of student needs.

But, in moments of deep despair,
especially after considering the
economics of the whole thing, Oak-
land will soon be a land of com-
bined luxury apartment towers and
landscaped parking lots. Perhaps
then we should all move to East Sli-
berty and set up communes.

Views of three different kinds of people are pre-
sented in this section. While some individuals be-
long to more than one of these kinds, for the most
part, Women, Blacks, and Commuters have main-
tained separate group identities and have dealt
with separate, although somewhat related prob-
lems. These particular people have been chosen
for this section because they have made the most
noise while demanding changes in the attitude of
the University towards their respective groups. We
are pleased to say that each of the following
articles is written by a very concerned and in-
volved group member‘ We thus hope to avoid
charges of misrepresentation, and also to give a
very insightful view into the inner thoughts, feel-
ings, and actions of these very important people.

peoples I introduction

The University's top administrator

sat placidly, his hands pressed into a
small steeple at his chin. Fielding
questions from a handful of campus
journalists gathered in his panelled
office for an informal press confer-
ence, Chancellor Posvar shifted po-
sition intermittently, sipping from a
ha|f—filled cup of diet soda at his
elbow and leaning over the table to
quietly make a point.

’’I really don’t think that you can
compare women’s liberation with
black liberation,” he said with
amusement, countering a comment
offered by the only female present.
”After all, there is an objective basis
underlying racial discrimination . . .
and as you know, the university, as a
haven for all opinion, must remain
neutral on political matters. it is
against the very concept of a univer-
sity to become involved in political
movements. l mean, what would be
the purpose of a School of Feminist
Studies — to turn out professional
feminists? What would you study in
a School of Feminist Studies,
anyway?

>l< * *

women

Sheila Tobias, Associate Provost at
Wesleyan University and a guest
speaker at the Symposium on Femi-
nism, held here September 23-4,
1970, suggested that ”female studies
is the intellectual examination of the
absence of women from history; the
fresh look in a non—Freudian way at
the social psychology of women;
the study of women in literature
and the images of women in arts;
the economic and legal history of
the family; and speculation about
androgyny defined as societies, uto-
pist, primitive, or revolutionary,
where sex differences have been
minimized.”

* * *

A few weeks following his re-
marks, in May, 1970, Posvar himself
got a ”fresh look” at the practical
requirements of women's studies
programs when two dozen campus
feminists staged a teach—in in his
office and demanded the establish-
ment of a School for Interdisci-
plinary Feminist Studies to the
budgetary tune of $350,000. The
confrontation followed on the heels

of a formal complaint lodged with
the Department of Labor by the
University Committee for Women’s
Rights’ (UCWR), the most active
feminist voice on campus. The
women charged the University with
gross discrimination in hiring, firing
and advancement policies and
threatened to appeal to the Depart-
ment of Health, Education and Wel-
fare under Executive orders #11246
and #11375, which prohibit an in-
stitution receiving Federal monies
from engaging in practices discrimi-
natory ”on the basis of race, reli-
gion, national origin or sex.” The
penalty for non—compliance is loss
of Federal funds, and, for the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh, a potential cut-
back of $25 million.

At the time of the teach—in, the
Chancellor and his aides promised
to respond ”as soon as possible” on
the feasibility of the studies pro-
posal and a package of others in-
cluding an arrangement for day care
facilities for female students, staff
and faculty and a demand that half
of the administrative posts in the
University be filled by women.

The administrative response, later
to emerge as a critical move in its
long range political implications,
affirmed ”the University’s opposition
to all forms of discrimination” and
initiated a four—pronged study relat-
ing to the ”education, employment
and career development of women
in the University” with initial reports
due November 1, 1970. To provide
advice and input for the study, the
Chancellor's Report also set up the
Advisory Council on Women's
Opportunities (ACWO) comprised
of four students, four faculty, four
administrators and four staff with at
least three members of each cate~
gory women. The Council, designed
”to serve as a source of collective
advice, consultation and assistance
to the administrative officers con-
ducting the study”, was rejected by
the activist women who countered
with a proposal of their own. An
Office to Equalize the Status of
Women with a full staff and an
ample budget ($300,000), they

argued, would have the major re-
sponsibility for assessing and draw-
ing up adequate affirmative action
plans to end discrimination against
women.

The University stuck with the
ACWO, and the UCWR, in coaliton
with independent feminists on the
campus, went full steam ahead with
its suit against the University in an
attempt to bring the school into
harmony with Federal guidelines. An
eight-page memorandum from the
UCWR to HEW alleged that women
suffer from a tradition of
anti—nepotism in employment, are
placed in job categories unrelated to
their talent and training and that
male faculty members enjoy greater
access to facilities (i.e. secretaries,
office space) than do females. The
charges apparently triggered HEW’s
demand for additional data after the
University submitted four prelimi-
nary reports to the agency in August
of 1970.

in November, the University’ for-
warded to HEW a 200 page
Affirmative Action Program, which

after review, was termed ”incom-
plete”. The AA Program, while
promising to update recruitment
and hiring practices and establish
child care and maternity leave
procedures, failed to include de-
tailed data concerning salary ranges
and training levels as they corres-
ponded to positioning among
women and minority groups within
the University. HEW recommended
on paper that Pitt's funds be with-
held, but according to Dave Powers,
Assistant to the Chancellor and
chief spokesman on behalf of the
Program, the resolution was not car-
ried through into practice. Part and
parcel of the agency’s objections
involved dissatisfaction with the
Programs goals in the area of fac-
ulty recruitment. Current figures
indicate that about 20% of the total

faculty are women with the largest
chunk holding instructor status;
goals for 1971-2 would increase ov-
erall numbers of women by 4 per-
cent.

The staffing and availability of
child care facilities was another area
in which University performance
was well below Federal expecta—
tions. Near the conclusion of Winter
Term, 1970, the administration, act-
ing on an ACWO recommendation,
endorsed tentative plans for a center
to be located at the Rodef Shalom
Temple and to accommodate 45-60
indigent undergraduate women. The
project, which will be funded by the
University to one-fourth of its oper-
ating costs with the Federal govern-
ment footing the rest, was attacked
for its low-scale ambitions. It fails to
deal with the problems of middle

class white and black women who
constitute 93% of the Clerical and
service workers.

At the time this publication went
to press, the status of the Affirmative
Action Program and the suit against
it were still ambiguous. The program
has not yet been either ”accepted or
rejected” by HEW and the Univer-
sity is currently receiving its share of
Federal grants and appropriations.
The ACWO, slated to dissolve last
January, was given an extension
with budgetary supplement. The
four—area study commissioned by
the Chancellor in his May, 1970
memorandum is scheduled for
completion during the summer of
1971.

Implementation of the Institute
for Feminist Studies proposal, how-
ever, has stagnated, and this is due

in part to the need for approval by
the Board of Trustees and the State
Department of Education, according
to administrative sources. Women's
courses are now piecemeal products
of confrontations with department
chairmen and academic councils.
The number of courses handling the
historical, literary and sociological
patterns of female development vary
from term to term, although course
enrollment is consistently increas-
ing.

The struggle for women's rights/
liberation has also assumed a more
visible, participatory character over
the past year among the student
population, especially in the realm
of student publications. The legal,
political and personal battles in the
quest for female self-determination
and equality became a staple of the

news and editorial pages of The Pitt
News, and even the business office of
the campus newspaper informed its
advertisers that it ’’will cease carrying
ads offensive to women”. The paper’s
policy attracted debate and contro-
versy, but succeeded to some extent
in bringing the problems of women
to the forefront. The campus engi-
neering monthly, Skyscraper Engi-
neer, almost lost its departmental
funding when its editor removed
from the magazine’s pages the
Technicutie feature, a series of
glossy photos depicting female stu-
dents in various poses. This exposi-
tion itself comes a year after a small
group of feminists, supported by
four women’s organizations, took
exception to the 1970 OWL’s treat-
ment of the women's movement
and demanded removal or refuta-
tion of the objectionable section.

in addition to publications, sec-
tors of the student body evinced an
interest in the spiralling movement
by sponsoring symposia, workshops
and speakers. Alpha Phi Omega, the
campus service fraternity, invited

two women to address a meeting;
the Student Engineering Cabinet set
up a panel discussion attended by
70 students and faculty members
from engineering departments; En-
vironmental Action/Zero Population

Growth (EA/ZPG) worked tirelessly
to educate the University community
about the legal and medical implica-
tions of abortion legislation and
sponsored an ”Abortion and Birth
Control information Week” during
Fall Term.

The Special Programs division of
Student Affairs, relying heavily on
student assistance, carried a
significant share of the educational
crusade. The office planned and
executed a two day Symposium on
Feminism, bringing to campus femi-
nists representing every coloration
of the political spectrum marking a
growing social movement. Later in
the academic year, the Symposium
was followed by a series of
discussions/luncheons examining
the status of women in the Health
Professions and a March Speakers
Series featuring national leaders
such as Kate Millett, Naiomi Gray
and Jeanne Noble.

Much feminist effort has been
centered around information gather-
ing and dissemination. The ACWO
has organized its operations into six
task forces (in line with the recom-
mendations of the Chancellor’s
Report): Student Affairs; Day Care
and Women’s Study institute; the
Health Related Professions, the Pro-

vost’s Office; Staff; and Black
Women. The Council also co-
sponsored with Mortar Board,

senior women’s honorary, a compre-
hensive study of graduate educa-
tional opportunities for women at
Pitt.

Despite the commitment and per-
severance of the relatively small
number of women waging the fight
for equality, the University, in order
to deserve its claim as a ”coeduca-
tional institution”, has a long way to
go before women and minorities
can maintain an equalized status
with white men. Males dominate
the decision-making apparati here
from the office of the Chancellor to
University Senate committees; and
female students can expect most
courses to deal with the historical
accomplishments of men and most
faculty members to be baritones.

peoples I women

After the Pittsburgh racial riots in

the spring of 1968, a rising tide of
Black identity swept over the cam-
pus of the University of Pittsburgh.
Black people were more and more
rejecting the traditionalism that had
previously patterned their lives and
were expressing the desire to help
their own people instead of only
seeking to get a degree, move into
the suburbs, and give cocktails par-
ties.

This new wave of Black thinking
first manifested itself in the physical
appearance of many Black students
— the acquisition of afros, Afri-
can-style clothing, and the rejection
of make-ups in favor of the natural
look. But this was not all. Black stu-
dents looked at the University of
Pittsburgh campus, and they won-
dered why it was that out of a total
student population of over 16,000,
Black students made up only one
percent. They wondered why the
University, with such a large Black
community population around it,
had not made greater efforts to re-
cruit young Black students. They
then realized that they were only at
the great White University of Pitts-
burgh because they were considered

”superior” Blacks — worth being
given the chance for higher educa-
tion.

By this time Stokely Carmichael
was exhorting cries of Black Power
and Unity, and Black people started
believing that they could and would
determine the destinies of them-
selves and their people; Thusly on
the University of Pittsburgh campus
came the coming of the BAS . . .
The little organization which had
originally begun as an off-campus
History Club began blossoming, and
the University administration was
shocked in January of 1969 to find
that members of the Black Action
Society has staged a protest for ac-
tion by completely taking over the
Cathedral’s Computer Center.

The students presented a list of
demands to the administration
which included: the recruitment of
Black faculty, administrators, and

other personnel at all levels; space
in the Hillman Library for a Black
Literature section; the establishment
of an Institute of Black Studies in
the University; and a proposal for
the steady increase of Black enroll-
ment until Blacks composed at least
20 percent of the University popu-
lation.

The University, after much discus-
sion and debate, finally agreed to

many of the demands made by the
BAS. In the summer of 1969, Dr. Jack
Daniels of the Speech Department
and Curtiss Porter of the Black Ac-
tion Society wrote their ”Black
Paper for Black Studies,” which

defined the need and structure of a
proposed comprehensive program
of Black Studies. A department of
Black Studies, which would contain
what Black students considered rele-

vant and vital in the way of courses,
was accepted by the University and
implemented during this time pe-
riod.

The BAS had prior to this per-
suaded the University administration
to implement special admission
programs for Black and other racial
minority students, and the Project A
program had been in existence since
the summer of 1968. It provided
scholarships, tutorial, and on-
campus living experience for Black
and other minority group students
who normally would not have
gone to a large, White University.
The program has since been named
the Malcom, Martin, Marcus pro-
gram, or Tri-M, and in September of
1969 the Faculty of Arts and Sci-
ences Committee of the University
voted to support financially and

otherwise another Black Studies
program under the auspices of the
University Community Educational
Program.

Before the coming of the BAS, the
Computer Center takeover, Black
awakening, the Black Studies de-
partment, or the special minority
programs, the small number of Black
students sort of went unnoticed by
the rest of the University popula-
tion; but, with the emergence of all
these things, a very cold tension
developed between Whites and
Blacks. Whites considered the Blacks
Klannish and fearful, while Blacks
considered the Whites racist and
oppressive. It would be an outright
lie to say that these attitudes have
completely changed, but now White
and Black students are working
toward a common goal: the better-
ment of the University with respect
to their own cultures and environ-
ments.

Black students have, over the past
two years, decided to become ac-
tively involved in those things in the
University which have an effect on
them. in January of 1970, Maloyd
Ben Wilson, a senior speech and
theater student, felt that some of
the music being played on the cam-
pus radio station (WPGH) should be
coming from a Black perspective
and from Black people. He explored
the idea, and the Black Side of
WPGH was soon established, with
Black D.J.’s, engineers, and manag-
ers. Since that time, the Black Side
has undergone some changes, but
Black students now hold powerful
positions throughout the radio sta-
tion. The situation which exists be-
tween Black and White WPGH
workers is far from Utopian — racial
tensions closed down the station in
late March of 1971, but the two
sides are functioning again.

Campus politics soon became a
point of interest to many of the
Black students, and the 1971 Student
Association elections concluded
with the very outspoken and Black
Wade Lawson winning one of the
most powerful positions in campus

politics — Committees Commis-
sioner. The area of student publica-
tions was also touched by the new
Black involvement, with the election
of Don Marbury to the position of
Editor-in—Chief of the Pitt News, the
official undergraduate newspaper.
Organizations such as the debate
team, glee club, housing board, food
service committees, and many ad-
ministration-faculty-student organi-
zations were all integrated by the
Black involvement.

In the early days of Black progress
at the University, fraternities and
sororities were the one outlet the
Black students had for any social
activity. They are still important, but
not all-inclusive. Omega Psi Phi,
Kappa Alpha Psi, Alpha Phi Alpha,
and Groove Phi Groove Social Fel-
lowship are the four main Black fra-
ternal organizations on campus,
with Delta Sigma Theta, and Alpha
Kappa Alpha the two sororities. A
very sizeable proportion of the Black
population are in or intend to
pledge Greek groups at the Univer-

sity, contrary to what is happening
in White fraternities and sororities.
The heads of Black frats and sorori-
ties attribute the stability of their
organizations to the fact that the at-
titudes of Black frats and sororities
are more oriented towards the
needs of Black people, and not only
the social aspect of college life.
Black athletes have made large
contributions to the University. The
endeavors and triumphs of Bryant
Salter, Smittie Brown, Lloyd Weston,
and many other fine athletes have
done much for the spirit and recog-
nition in sports which Pitt has re-
ceived in recent years, but little
towards alleviating the plight of the
Black athlete -— the dilemma that
the athletes face every time they
compete for their White school. In
January of 1971, the Black athletes,
united with Black students, faculty,
administration, and community, pro-
tested the treatment of the Black
athletic performers, and threatened
to boycott athletics and the Univer-
sity. They demanded fair treatment,

a Black director of athletics, and an
end to one-sided publicity.

Black students now number well
over 1,000 students, not including
many of the graduate and special
community programs which are
offered at the University of Pitts-
burgh. There are Blacks in
influential, non-token administration
and faculty positions. Black under-
graduates are organized, and have a
voice in many of the affairs which
concern them. There is no question
but that Black Pitt students have
come a long way since early 1967,
but they also realize that they are
just getting things to the way they
should have been in the first place,
and that their progress thus far is
only a comparatively few steps in
the direction that can make this
University deserved of the name
”lnstitute of Higher Learning.” Prog-
ress is being made, and Black people
are at the University of People . . .
to stay, mold, and improve them-
selves, their community, and ulti-
mately, the world.

university”

he University of Pittsburgh has
traditionally been a commuter
school. It was not until the late
1950’s, in fact, that the ”streetcar
co|lege” opened its first residence
halls. Yet the dorms have not altered
Pitt's basic character. Today, only
about 3,500 undergrads live in the
dorms, about 1,500 live in off-
campus apartments and frater-
nity housing, and nearly 6,000 com-
mute every day from as far away as
Butler and Monessen. But what kind
of education does the commuter
receive?

The huge, impersonal multiversity,
where students lack the opportunity
to become involved in their school,
is not the right environment for
developing the whole person. Presi-
dent Wilson would be disappointed.
Even though the quality of academic
instruction is high at Pitt, attending
classes is only half (?) of what a col-
lege education should be. Commu-
ters, for the most part, are forced to
miss out on the other — perhaps the
more important — half — activities,
organizations, social events, speak-
ers, films, new and interesting peo-
ple, and simple things like midnight
shaving cream battles. Commuters
face two main sets of problems:
physical problems, which hamper
participation in extracurricular events;
and, psychological problems, which
are caused largely by lack of in-
volvement. But, despite the fact
that commuters are a majority of
students on this campus — and that
more commuters than residents are
being admitted each year — almost
no overt interest, until very recently,
had been shown in helping com-
muting students. 1970—71 was the
first year that commuter problems
really came to light. Commuter
news made the front page of the
school newspaper, and administra-
tors finally began to admit that a
problem may exist. The Commuter
Association, having been re-
organized the previous year, be-
gan to make slow—but—steady prog-
ress, and a general awareness of
commuter problems was created at
the University.

Brking is the most frequent
commuter gripe, Students who drive
often have to orbit the Oakland area
for fifteen to twenty minutes to find
a parking space, and, despite the
fact that each new freshman class
increases the commuter student
population, little is being done to
increase the amount of parking
space allocated to students. The
University, until very recently, ig-
nored the commuter parking prob-
lem altogether by denying that it
had any responsibility for providing
”auxi|iary services” (parking) to stu-
dents. The Commuter Association
was once told by a high University
official that ”there is no parking
problem in Oakland.”

However, much worse than the
University’s failure to provide park-
ing are administration promises of
future plans which include parking.
High school students considering
Pitt are sent brochures showing pic-
tures of the Towers (framed by the
only tree in Oakland). In the
mid-sixties, the first Commuter As-
sociation president was told of the

Y . ..... mm...

parking that would be available ”in
two or three years.” As early as 1950,
a current students father recalled
plans to build a multi-level parking
garage under the Cathedral lawn.

But, despite the fact that the
University has at one time denied
the existence of a parking problem,
and at the same time promised
more parking without ever building
it, the situation is growing worse. A
study made by Ramp Consulting
Services, lnc., for the Pittsburgh
Parking Authority and the De-
partment of City Planning (1969)
revealed that there is indeed a short-
age. The deficit is currently esti-
mated at 2,000 spaces, and the re-
port projected that by 1975, the
Oakland area will be short an esti-
mated 9,500 spaces. It is, perhaps, a
little too early to be hopeful, but it
appeared that in the last few weeks
of school the administration may
finally cooperate with students in
the area of parking. Negotiations are
currently underway with the admin-
istration for two new lots, and more
may be obtained in the future.

Right now, the plight of commu-
ters who depend on PAT busses is
as bad as the plight of those with
cars. Busses are slow, undependable,
crowded, uncomfortable, and be-
coming increasingly more expensive.
Despite what the Port Authority’s
massive Public Relations campaign
would have the public believe, rid-
ing busses is a very inconvenient
mode of transportation. Pitt commu-
ters who would like to stay around
for evening activities are also faced
with the fact that bus service at
night is infrequent. Allegheny
County is currently in the middle of
a debate over rapid transit. The ”Sky-
bus” plan, even if approved, would
only be operational in 1975 and
would not serve Oakland.

Facilities, or more appropriately
the lack of facilities, for the growing
commuter student population dis-
courages involvement as effectively
as the transportation problem. Hill-
man Library, the Commons Room,
and the Student Union provide al-
most adequate study space for
commuters, but lounge space is

insufficient. A commuter doesn't
really have a chance to relax. The
library is probably used more as a
lounge by commuters than as a
place for study. Also, there are no
shower facilities for commuters who
would like to freshen up for an eve-
ning activity, and no overnight facil-
ities available to commuters who
would like to stay on campus for an
occasional late event or special
weekend. Next year, a substantial
increase in lounge space in the Stu-
dent Union is promised. In addition,
a new food service has been

3 
V

brought onto campus for the next
year, so there is hope for improved
eating opportunities.

Scheduling is another major prob-
lem faced by Pitt commuters. The
University has never taken a survey
of its commuter student body, but
the CA has estimated that nearly
fifty percent of all commuters hold
part—time jobs, and some work as
much as forty hours a week. Cou-
pled with the large time commit-
ment commuters make to traveling
to and from school, the amount of
time spent on the job further re-

duces the amount of time that can
be spent on campus. Yet, the Regis-
trar’s Office is not very generous
towards commuters. There is some
kind of provision for avoiding Satur-
day classes if the student commutes
from more than twenty-five miles
away, and it is possible to get some
consideration is one holds a job, but
most commuters are still faced with
very inconvenient schedules. Most
eight o’clock classes are dispropor-
tionately made up of commuters,
and many have five or six hour gaps
between classes.

peoples I commuters — the ”other university”

When I came to Pitt, I fooled
around too much. Me and my
friends majored in the Tuck
Shop. I told my son he better
just stick to schoolwork. I want
to see grades.

We don’t like our daughter
staying around at night for ac-
tivities. We want her to come
home for dinner and study.

My dad says as long as I’m liv-
ing in his house I'll have to go
by his rules. I have to get my
hair cut and he doesn’t like me
to talk about race or the war.

I think the biggest problem is
the loneliness. You don't know
anybody and nobody ever talks
to anybody. I just come to
classes. I don't really feel like I
belong here.

The most serious problems a
commuter faces are psychological.
The impersonal environment makes
many commuters feel more like
office workers than college students,
and living at home with parents can
create a bigger strain on the indi-
vidual than going away for the first
time. To compound matters, most
college counseling centers are
geared to resident students’ prob-
lems.

One psychologist who has re-
searched commuter problems is Pro-
fessor Herman Schuchman of the
University of Illinois at Chicago Cir-
cle, and he has opened the eyes of
many people. The single most impor-
tant problem is parents. At Parents’
Weekend last year, the major causes
of student-parent conflict were

brought out at the Commuter Asso-
ciation’s Workshop. Most parents,
such as the two quoted above, fail

to see education as more than just
attending classes. They would disa-
gree with President Wilson’s ideal of
a college community. To them,
there is no value in activities or so-
cial events.

At an age when a young adult
should be given more personal free-
dom, many parents still treat their
student son or daughter as though
they were still in high school. Treat-
ing students as children can create
anxiety and resentment. Many par-
ents set down unrealistic curfews for
their off-spring, and many still expect
chores to be performed — ignoring
the fact that much more of the stu-
dent’s time is now being spent in
study, commuting, or at a job than
had been spent in high school.

The commuter must really live in
two worlds — the university and the
home community. The constant
conflict between the value systems

of these two groups creates prob-
lems. For instance, a student may be
exposed to liberal ideas on the war
and the racial problem by professors
and fellow students at school, but
very often a student’s parents hold
quite different views. This is com-
pounded by the fact that many
commuters are first-generation col-
lege-goers, and often come from
working—class families whose atti-
tudes and life-styles are consider-
ably different than those of college
graduates. Living, as the commuter
does, in these two worlds, sets up
the double vise of too much control
by parents and not enough chances
for social interaction with peers. The
result is often a slowing of the stu-
dent's emotional maturation pro-
cess.

The second most serious problem
is the feeling of not belonging to
the university community. The
mainstream of campus life revolves
around those students who live
nearby and most commuters, being
unable to take a more active role,
feel ”left out.” Commuters generally
have fewer friends and acquain-
tances on campus than do residents.
Many students, dorm and commuter
alike, may never be in a class with
fewer than fifty or sixty students, or
at most have only a few small
classes in their upper-class years.
This type of environment does not
allow much social interaction or
opportunity to discuss curricular
matters outside of class with fellow
students. Three members of the staff
of the Student Affairs Office sum up
what it means to be a commuter:

*5

Students tell me that the
Commons Room is divided up
along geographical lines.
There’s a place where people
from the South Hills sit, and
there are /vlonroeville and
Beaver Valley sections. Every-
body just stays with their high
school friends.

Yes, you see an awful lot of
high school letters around here.
The commuters just seem to
come in the morning and go
home at three o'clock. We can
never get them to stay around
for evening activities or social
events.

That’s true, but there's really
nothing we can do about it.

 

peoples I commuters ~ the ”oth<=r university”

A group such as the Commuter
Association is a response, although
there are obviously profound
differences between solving physical
and psychological problems. Put
very simply, it is considerably easier
(and less frustrating) to attempt to
alleviate the crushing physical space
problem than to convince either
students or their parents that they
should be ”liberated.” Furthermore,
in the former case it is clear that
commuters have a legitimate claim.
It is not nearly so clear in the latter.
This year the Commuter Association
worked in all these areas, and, while
few gigantic successes can be
claimed, at least a start has been
made.

People wondered what the CA
was trying to do, and as such, many
misunderstood our motives. The CA
made a lot of news and a lot of
noise. We held a ”Commuting Semi-
nar” in November which flopped,
and the group also sponsored a few
moderately successful social events.
The CA newspaper, The Magic Bus,
also made an impact. Perhaps the
most noteworthy commuter event
was the mini-crisis in February when
the CA set a deadline for the erec-
tion of two bus-stop shelters. For a
year, the project had been delayed
by zoning and construction hassles,
and promises had been uttered at
least five times to have the shelters
up. Each time, the shelters were de-

 

layed, but on February 8, construc-
tion was begun.

While these hassles were going
on, there was talk of a sit-in in the
Vice—Chancellor’s Office to drama-
tize what was happening. The CA
was prepared to set up mock card-
board and wood shelters had not
construction commenced, but the
Administration had ordered coffee
for one hundred to entertain an
irate group of students. The CA
acquired a somewhat radical reputa-
tion after this incident. While the
group was most likely not as radical
as compared to some others, most
was accomplished through taking a
firm stand. In the area of parking,
for example, the CA rejected an

administration plan for the
re-opening of the Panther Hollow
lot, which had traditionally been
free, on a fee basis. It now looks as
though the lot will be available next
year without cost.

While the CA is an advocate of
taking a firm stand against adminis-
tration excuses, other people believe
this not to be enough. For example,
in February, a group of loosely orga-
nized Pitt commuters calling them-
selves ”Students Tired of Paying”
(STOP) spray-painted parking meters
in the Oakland area. Instead of pre-
venting the meter maids from read-
ing the meters, the ladies merely
scraped the paint off the glass and
gave tickets as usual. What this inci-

dent did accomplish was the aliena-
tion of the City of Pittsburgh from
the commuting student. When CA
members have met with city parking
planners, they have been reminded
of the incident and the cost of re-
placing the meters.

While the CA has been making an
effort to eliminate some of the bar-
riers towards increased commuter
participation in the university life,
commuters themselves will have to
make more of an effort. Such is the
extent of the solution to the psycho-
logical problems that exist. When a
commuter wants to stay for an activ-
ity, that student will have to try hard
to overcome the problems asso-
ciated with an extended stay. Until

such time as a large number of
commuting students begin to
change their values with respect to
what they want out of a college
education, the problem lends itself
to solution only through personal
choice.

Perhaps a panel such as the one
established at Wayne State Univer-
sity to examine the commuter prob-
lem could be attempted here. It
would be a start towards developing
a long-range commitment towards
helping commuting students. But in
the short-range, progress is being
made — again, slowly but surely.
Commuters were in the news so
much this year that the Pitt News
April Fools issue satirized the CA
twice. This year was a beginning.
There is a greater willingness on the
parts of students and administrators
to deal with the commuting situa-
tion, and in bringing about such an
awareness, the CA has been success-
ful.

 

peoples I commuters — the ”other university”

 

This year The OWL
would like to bring
your attention to three
areas of the University
whose reputation and
fine qualities are not
recognized by many

"bird’s eye view” of
the Band, the Studio

pitt marching band

”Presenting the University of Pitts~
burgh one-hundred and twenty piece
Varsity Marching Band . .  The all’
male Pitt Band is a highly spirited,
close-knit, yet diverse, group of musie
cians. As a result of their efforts to
entertain football spectators and
promote school spirit, the group has
developed a fraternal spirit that holds

it together and makes its members
willing to sacrifice much of their time
to practice and drills. Practice begins
with training camp just prior to the
opening of the tall term. For seven
daysthemembers withstandsoreness,
swollen lips, and marching, marching,
and more marching. But this kind or
effort has made the Pitt Band one of

the nation’s outstanding university
bands.

Members receive no monetary coin-
pensation for their participation,
however, they feel that their trips to
away footballgamesprovideadequate
reward. During the 1970 season the
band participated in the Steel Bowl.

As in the past 23 years, the Marching
Band ended its season with the Stad—
ium Review in Carnegie Music Hall.

Dr. Robert L. Arthur is retiring this
year as the head of the Pitt Marching
Band after over thirty years of service.

university theatre

The Studio Theatre is an undergrad-
uate organization designed to pro-
vide both the theatre major and the
interested non—major in the various
aspects of dramatic production —
acting, directing, stage management,
costume and set design. Under the
guidance of The Studio Theatre
Board and a faculty advisor, a wide
range of plays, from the experimen-
tal to the conventional, are pre-
sented each year. The board takes
charge of publicity, finances, main-
tenance of the theatre, and deter-

mines, from suggestions submitted
by student directors, which
will be produced each term.

plays

The xersatility of the theatre located
n the Cathedral basement makes a
variety of productions possible.
There is no fixed, permanant stage
3r seating arrangement so the physi-
:a| form of the theatre may be
idapted to the needs of the play.
’ast productions have included
nodern dance dramas, pantomime,
ieveral original plays and a musical,

The Fantast/'(;l<s, as well as such
famous works as Genet’s The Maids,
Anouilh’s Antigone, Dylan Thomas’
Under Mi/kwood, and Wicherley’s
The Country Wife, for which the
theatre was altered to resemble a
I7 h century playhouse. The Studio
Theatre also premiered an original
Latin American play, Carba||ido's A
Short Day’s Anger and Center Ave-
nue: A Trip a black revolutionary
play by Rob Penny.

In keeping with its function as an

educational vehicle, the resources of
the Studio Theatre are available to
acting and directing classes, as well
as to other courses in the Speech
Department. One Studio produc-
tion, The Country Wife, represented
the final product of Speech I23, a
course in the history of acting styles.
The goal of the Studio Theatre is to
provide an open center for theatrical
activity in the University, and to
present local audiences with a diver-
sity of fine productions.

 

observatory

 

The Allegheny Observatory is a rela-
tively unknown component of the
University, yet it has been a part of
Pitt since 1867. At that time, one of
the country’s largest telescopes — a
thirteen-inch refractor — was lo-
cated there.

Today, the Observatory has three
telescopes, the largest of which is

the 30-inch Thaw refractor. This in-
strument, the third-largest of its kind
in the country (and the largest pho-
tographic refractor), has been used
for parallax studies since 1914, mak-
ing the Observatory the oldest cen-
ter for parallax studies in the world.
Important findings there have been:
(1) proof that the rings of Saturn
were composed of particles (1895)

and (2) the discovery of the rotation
of stars (1905).

in addition to the obscurity of the
Observatory, the Astronomy Depart-
ment is virtually unknown. Perhaps
this is due to the failure of its four
full-time professors to offer a greater
range of appealing undergraduate
courses; or perhaps the location of

the Observatory (which contains the
Astronomy Dept.) on the North Side
of the city discourages people. In
any case, in an age in which so
much emphasis is placed on the
exploration and understanding of
space, it is too bad that the fine tal-
ents of the people and the extensive
facilities of the Allegheny Observa-
tory are currently under-utilized.

Socially, the 1970-1971 year was a disappointment. If it
were not for the Franklin Pangborn Film Club, football
games, fraternity parties, and twenty—four hour open-
house, the Pitt student might have found the only enter-
tainment in loitering in front of the Briar Bowl ogling
girls and picking on the south Oakland gentlemen.

Looking over the events of the year, one is reminded of
unqualified performers in a talent contest. The audience
was given a shoddy facsmile of a better act, and all the
while it kept looking to the wings for the big hook to
reach out and relieve it of the embarrassing spectacle.
Sure enough, the hook came.

Winter Weekend has been eliminated and so has Parents’
Weekend. Even Homecoming is not looking as healthy as
t once did.

Three major reasons for the mercy killings which abol-
shed Parents’ and Winter Weekends can be examined.

Zirst, a high calibre event must generate interest. The
iormat for a social affair, it successful, can be used for
Jne or two years and then must be changed so as not to
grow stagnant. It was through repetition of the film, car-
iival, and mediocre concert routine that Winter Week-

 

end ran itself into the ground. Parents’ Weekend started
off lacking initial appeal and never was improved. If
Homecoming is to continue, it must become more than a
time for another concert.

A second problem, and perhaps the most important, lies
in the heterogeneity of the campus. It is almost impossi-
ble to gear an event for any large segment of the campus
population. Greek Week, Engineers Week, Black Week,
and even Freak Week all experienced limited success
because of the homogenous nature of the sponsoring
groups. For the past two years Pitt has had no wide ap-
pealing events.

A third problem of Pitt’s special events is the tremendous
dependence the major activities have on the Greek Sys-
tem. The responsibility must be spread so that more peo-
ple will become active. If more interest is not aroused
within the university, there may be little use for a stu-
dent's activity fee.

What happened to the better concerts and social events
of a few years ago? They probably left along with the
better concert and social events planners of a few years
ago.

This year’s Homecoming was
rather boring until Chancellor
Posvar planted a congratulatory
kiss on the cheek of beautiful
Homecoming Queen, Ann
Thomas. Then, the Pitt football
team made the day one that
few will soon forget. And so,
through a coincidence of
scheduling, the year of 1970
will remembered by many in
terms of the Homecoming
game against WVU.

/vlelodious, blue-eyed Judy
Collins had a successful con-
cert, but it almost did not mat-
ter. After the great football
game, the Homecoming Com-
mittee could have presented
the Political Science Depart-
ment doing their impression of
the Jackson Five, and Home-
coming would still have been a
success.

But take away the football
game and, for the undergradu-
ate, Homecoming would just
be another occasion for a con-
cert. For example, an attempt
was made to replace the Horne-
coming floats of the past
with displays based on this
year’s poor theme of ‘Hall to
Pitt”. Originally, groups from
throughout the University were
to exhibit displays on the
Cathedral lawn. As it turned
out, only three groups partici-
pated, all of which were Creek.
Although the winning display
by Zeta Beta Tau and Kappa
Alpha Theta was an impressive
one, the judges missed the
most impressive one of all -
the display of apathy on the
part of the student body.

EVENTS I HOMECOMING

The cliche, ’’If you’re seen one,
you've seen them all”, was
never so applicable. Winter
Weekend 71 was a carbon
copy of Winter Weekend '70
with the exception that even
less people participated.

The carnival was once again
held in the Commons Room of
the Cathedral, but with so few
groups participating, one ex-
pected to hear echoes bounc-
ing off the walls. And the con-
cert, supposedly the highlight
of the weekend, was stained
with controversy, as the Black
Action Society sought to bring
in a soul group instead of the
redundant hard rock diet
which the University had been
receiving. As it turned out, the
Carpenters were the main en-
tertainment and gave an ade-
quate, though not sensational,
performance.

What can one say about a uni-
versity social event that died?
In its I971 form it would not
make a good story,

Engineers’ Week traditionally
scheduled for the week which
contains St, Patrick’s [)ay, began
with the annual parade down
Bigelow Blvd. to the Cathedral.
All departments are represented
in the parade as well as in the
other events of the week and each
department also nominates a
candidate for St. Patricia.

After the kickoff parade, the
demonstrations begin. These pro-
grams are open to the public but
high school and engineering stu-
dents and their parents are par-
ticularly encouraged to attend.
The fun event was the pie-eating
contest. This year, Engineers’
Week held special significance
because the new engineering
building, Benedum Hall, was dedi-
cated at this time. The cc“
monies included a dinner for
alumni and students followed by
speeches by Lt. Gov. Kline and
Chancellor Posvar. The week’s
entertainment was provided by
the NY. Rock and Roll Ensemble
and topped off by the Engineers’
Ball at the Hilton Hotel.

Since I955, the senior class of the
School of Medicine under the
pseudonym of Scope and Scalpel
Society, has presented rather so-
phisticated plays satirizir I their

chariots, built trom scratch, ranged in variety
from lite-size lions to lit’e—size ferris wheels.

won the races, while Flll and Chi Omega won
the chariot decoration competition. That
evening, Sigma Alpha Epsilon, Phi Delta Theta,
and Alpha Delta Pi won the Fun Night and
scavenger hunt activities. Phi Kappa Theta and

of the Queen's contest was Alpha Epsilon

Don’t Know How To Love Him" from the rock
opera /esus Christ, Superstar. The Chancellor’s

the All-Sports Trophy was given to FIJI. A
special award was given to the men of Zeta

Wednesday evening was considered by many
to be the highlight of the week — Creek Sing.
The sorority division was won by Delta Phi
Epsilon with an outstanding arrangement of
”A Time For Us" and Bach’s ”Brandenburg

For an event to be successful in
a large heterogenous university,
the topic or entertainment must
either be general in appeal, and
with out much depth or very
specific, and capture an audi-
ence of almost everyone with
an interest in that area.

In the early fall, Chet Huntley
spoke to a packed house at
Common Facilities. His famous
personality and wide topic area
(the world) resulted in the large
attendance. The same was true
for Dick Gregory. Although of
greater appeal to blacks, his
credentials as comedian, writer,
and politician drew a large and
varied audience. This winter,
the Amazing Kreskin attracted
such a large audience that
manystudentswereturnedaway
at the door. His topic, ESP, was
specific but combined with his
abilities as an entertainer it
generated broad interest. People
were also turned away when
Bernadette Devlin spoke at
Carnegie Music Hall. Although
her topic was more specific her
appeal was wide and her name,
too, was famous. Kate Millet
spoke to a capacity crowd in
the S.U. Ballroom. Her topic,
the women’s movement al-
though specific is current and
generated widespread campus
interest. Leonard Wineglass,
defenseattorneyforthe Chicago
Seven debated with Dan Jay
from Young Americans for
Freedom. Two interest groups
were attracted here along with
those out for an evening's en-
tertainment. Zero Population
Growth sponsored a week long
forum on abortion to present
both sides of this burning issue.
But like the topic of the week,
the forum itself was an abortion.
Perhaps the main reason for the
lack of attendance is that the
campus has been oversaturated
with such discussions. Another
forum that was less than suc-
cessful was the lCC’s two eve-
nings ofdiscussion onthe urban
crisis. Barely sixty people ap-
peared to see such speakers as
Saul Alinsky, Robert Weaver,

Isaiah Robinson, Dick Thorn-

and Roy Lubone. The specific
and academic nature of the
subject combined with the Fri-
day night appearance of Wm.

Hall resulted in a small audience

An interesting year for the ath-
letic department began in an
unexpected locale in lune of
1970 as Athletic Director Casi-
mir /vlyslinski hosted a press
buffet a Trees Hall's Carlson
Gardens.

Although word had leaked out
ahead of the noontime affair,
the AD utilized the occasion to
formally reveal the athletic
departments plans for resur-
facing Pitt Stadium with As-

troTurf, placing the old sta-
dium in a class with the mod-
ern arenas — and once again
proclaiming Pitt as big time in
athletics.

The year which followed was
destined to reveal reams of in-
formation for the newspaper-
men, television and radio peo-
ple of Pittsburgh and the na-
tion. For /vlyslinski, some of the
moments were pleasant, but
most were hectic — far short of

the festive atmosphere of the
Carlson Gardens buffet.

The department was aware of
the risks of incompletion as
laborers worked on the Astro-
Turf with their deadline only a
few weeks before the football

season was scheduled to begin.

Possible delays — which always
seem to occur in such under-
takings — did not arise, and the
Pitt gridders began the season
in a stadium which boasted a

ATHLETICS I INTRO

brand new field which bla-
tantly clashed against the older
surroundings of the bowl-
shaped palace.

There was also the risk of ob-
jections to the estimated
spending of $400,000 on the
Turf and a Tartan track which
also adorned the stadium. But
few complaints were heard,
and the outlay appeared
worthwhile.

So, for a few short months, the
athletic department ran
smoothly, as that always pres-
ent lull before the storm
passed by. Even the football
team showed signs of success,
winning five of their first six
games. A four-game losing
streak concluded the gridders’
play, but the 5-5 record was a
passable accomplishment for a
team that still hadn’t forgotten
some miserable years in the
late sixties.

However, just as everyone was
beginning to forget about foot-
ball and basketball season ap-
proached, an avalanche of
problems began for the athletic
department.

Several black football players
protested treatment during the
season — treatment by coach-
es, the publicity office, the lo-
cal media and the Pitt News.
The powerful Black Action So-
ciety called a press conference
to voice its complaints to the
public. This December press
gathering was far removed
from the pleasantries of June at
Trees Hall. The Pitt athletic
department had now been

added to a growing list of insti-
tutions accused of racial bias.
Though the charges still exist,
little has happened. So far, the
BAS has inflicted little more
than a black eye to the athletic
department. However, one of
the major objectives of the
BAS, the selection of a black
administrator for the depart-
ment, appears to be nearing
reality.

A month after the charges
were lodged, with the black
athletic dilemma fresh in ev-
eryone’s mind, the winter term
began. Perhaps it shouldn’t
have.

Another band of athletes pro-
tested in January. From the
depths of Trees Pool where
they were seldom heard — and
dunked more often than not —
the Pitt swimmers begged for
the firing of their coach, Bill
Grant. After most of the top
swimmers quit by mid-season,

Grant resigned. The ex-swim-
mers rejoined and a couple
surprising victories appeared —
but all of that came after some
dismal confrontations between
Myslinski, Grant and the swim-
mers. The wrestling program
gradually became a headache
during the winter term. With
unfortunate personal problems
and injuries, the grap squad
turned from a contender for
the national title into an also
ran at both the Eastern and
NCAA championships.

The wrestling situation, in ad-
dition to the BAS problem,
gave the department negative
national publicity which was
intensified when the NCAA
refused to permit star Mark
Payne to compete because of
shoulder-length hair. Only the
cross country and track teams
were outstanding in 70-71, but
the year was interesting — and
filled with many problems.

ATHLETICS I INTRO '

The Pitt football team teetered at the edge of
glory in 1970, but eventually fell into the medi-
ocrity of a .500 season. In his second year as
head coach of the grid squad, Carl DePasqua
at least appeared to Come by some success
with his policy of working on the fundamen-
tals‘ Concentrating on a powerful running at-
tack which was spearheaded by halfback
Denny Ferris and fullback Tony Esposito, the
Panthers were able to outscore their opposi-
tion early in the year.

However, injuries became a major concern to
DePasqua not long after the season began. A
revolving door situation occurred at quarter-
back, as the Panthers’ three signal callers per-
iodically exchanged duties because of injuries.
lt was very late in the season before the same
quarterback had started in back-to—back
games. But the quarterbacking position proved
not to be the only precarious spot on the field
for Pitt. The defensive team took a particularly
hard beating from injuries. Seven of the eleven
defensive starters missed the Notre Dame
game because of mishaps on the field, culmi-
nating in DePasqua’s switching offensive men
Lou Julian and Phil Sgrignoli to linebacker.

The injuries weren't overly harmful early in the
season, though, as the weaker part of the '70
schedule helped the Panthers march to a 5-1
mid-season chart. An opening day loss to
UCLA was the only blemish on the record at
that point. After the fifth win the Panthers had
attained the attention of national pollsters for
the first time in seven years, as the Associated
Press listed the Cats eighteenth in the nation.
The Panthers were also sitting on top of the
weekly Lambert voting for supremacy in the
East.

The most exciting part of that
leap into the limelight was not
the fifth victory, however. A
week earlier, the Panthers had
won number four in the Home-
coming game at Pitt Stadium.
It was a game that will be
remembered at Pitt for a long
time. The game was against
rival West Virginia, and both
teams entered the contest
with 3-1 records. But West Vir-
ginia was more impressive on
paper, with big wins compared
to some early squeakers for
Pitt. And for awhile on that
October day it appeared the
Mountaineers were by far su-
perior. They dominated the
first half of the game, romping
to a 35-8 half-time advantage
. . . Some of the sellout home-
coming throng began to leave.
Almost amazingly — at the
least, methodically — the Pan-
thers constructed a second half
comeback that will challenge
any of history’s comebacks.

 

their hands on the ball — and
four times the Panthers
marched for touchdowns, stay-
ing on the ground mostly and
using only a few passes. The
Cats’ efforts for the first downs
were never thwarted in the
second half, while the Pitt de-
fense halted the WVU’s three
attempts to reach the sticks‘
The comeback was so well
constructed that only 54 sec-
onds remained in the game
when Pitt scored the go—ahead
touchdown. WVU’s final op-
portunity was snuffed when a
last second mid-field fumble
recovery by the Panthers
ended the game . . Q You had
to be there.

Just two weeks after the height
of the football season, the roof
caved in on the Panthers on a
day at Syracuse where the
clouds caved in to bring a rain
storm which befitted the occa-

ATHLETICS I FOOTBALL

sion. Ben Schwartzwalder’s
Syracuse Orangemen, a team
destined to come back them-
selves from disastrous racial
problems and an early season
three—game losing streak,
smashed Pitt, 43-13. The Pan-
thers were now destined to see
no more victories in 1970.

The only bright spot the rest of
the way was a momentary
14-13 lead in the first half
against Notre Dame. It was the
first time anyone had an ad-
vantage over the Fighting lrish
in ’70, but it was short—lived as
the Irish pulled away in the
second half to defeat Pitt's
hopes for a big season. After a
loss at home to Boston Col-
lege, the Panthers final chance
for a winning season depended
on the traditional finale against
Penn State. In ’70, the game

was played at University Park,
Pa., and the host Nittany Lions
let the Cats know right away
that they were serious about
winning. State scored on the
first play from scrimmage and
soon ended the Pitt year on a
losing note. After five consecu-
tive wins, the Panthers had lost
four straight and could finish
with no better than a 5-5 rec-
ord. Certainly it was better
than the 4-6 of 1969, but after
the good start the final mark
was disappointment. With
many seniors on the 70 squad,
it looked like the year most

likely to result in a bowl trip,
something Pitt football teams
are becoming more and more

oblivious to as the years go by.

The mood was set at the final
loss to Penn State in late Nov-
ember when reporters at-
tempted to reach DePasqua by
phone in the Pitt locker room.
The Coach had already left for
an anniversary celebration with
his wife. Someone answered
the phone in the locker room
and stunned the press corps
with his answer: ’’Call back in
January.”

ATHLETICS I SOCCER

Leo Bemis, the only soccer coach
Pitt has ever had, guided his booters
to their best campaign in five years
in 1970, but the season ended with
a kind of disappointment that can
only result from a well—played sea-
son. The Booters record revealed
eight wins and four losses, and the
four defeats were barely enough to
keep them out of the NCAA District
2 playoffs. Actually, the soccermen
were rejected by the playoff people
after only three losses. They were
preparing for their season finale
against Penn State when the dis-
trict's soccer committee announced
its four choices. One of those se-
lected was Penn State (7-2 at the
time) and another was a Penn team
which had 2 defeats, 2 ties, and 2
games remaing to be played. A vic-
tory over State would have meant
two Eastern teams were in the
playoffs with poorer records than the
booters, since Penn proceeded to
lose one of its remaining games. The
Pitt booters lost a close defensive
game to the Lions 2-1, and could
only wonder if the outcome might
have been different if a tourney
berth were contingent on a victory.
But for Bemis, the 1970 season
marked a complete turnabout from
his lowest point as soccer coach in
1968 when players were asking that
he be dismissed from his position.
”We simply have more soccer play-
ers,” Bemis said throughout the
more pleasant 70 year. And he also
insisted that moving into Pitt Sta-
dium to play on the AstroTurf and
practicing on Trees Field meant a
great deal to the team. In the past
they had practicied and played on
fields that were comparable to
neighborhood lots. A more potent
scoring attack also helped the ‘I970
team. Ali Rdissi led the way with
nine goals as Tony Nicholacopolous
and Denny Kohlmeyer booted in
five and three goals respectively.
One strong threat was missed,
though, as senior Conference "Tsi-
ma” Lekoma was injured early in the
season.

Despite
the cross-country team
piled its most impressive rec-
ord since lim Banner has been
coach at Pitt.

Banner chose to eliminate sev-
eral early season dual meets
with the hope of having the
squad in top shape for the
championships at the conclu-
sion of the fall.

Led by two-time cross-country
All-American Jerry Richey, the
harriers whipped both Cleve-
land State and W.V.U. by large
margins. In a tough Notre

Dame Invitational, the team
finished fifth, one point from
fourth place. Competing

against W.V.U., Penn State, and
Syracuse in the first annual Big
Four Cross Country meet, the
harriers ran away with the tro-
phy as six runners placed in
the top ten spots, paced by
Richey’s first. At the East’s
lC4A’s the Pitt runners nar-
rowly missed upsetting peren-
nial powerhouse Villanova. The
top five scorers for Pitt — Rich-
ey, Dave Szabat, Greg Rod-
gers, Dave Cheseborough, and
Mike Schurko — to talley 79
points, enough for second

place in the team standings
and only nine points less than
the victorious Villanova. It was
the first time in sixteen years
that a Pitt cross country team
had won a trophy at the lC4A
competition.

However, Richey ran the worst
race of his career at the NCAA
championships one week later,
finishing 116th in the field. The
Pitt squad placed 11th in the
nation at the meet as senior
Vornhagen led the harriers
with a 47th place run.

ATHLETICS I CROSS COUNTRY

After almost a decade of below average basketball,
Coach Charles ”Buzz” Ridl, in 1970-71, fielded a Pitt
five that was capable of winning some games. His Pan-
thers compiled a 14-10 record, and until very late in
the season, the Panthers were under consideration for
a National Invitational Tournament (NT) bid. However,
three consecutive losses on the road at the conclusion
of the schedule thwarted the opportunity. Ridl’s cagers
startled Pittsburgh sports fans early in the season with
a convincing win at the 20th annual Steel Bowl Tour-
ney over city rival Duquesne. The win marked the first
time a Panther squad had enjoyed victory over the
Dukes in eight years. A record Civic Arena crowd
turned out the next night to watch the Pitt cagers suc-
cumb to an awesome UCLA team in the tourney’s
championship game. But the eventual national cham-
pion Bruins didn't pull away from the Pitt five until
midway through the second half. Three consecutive
victories at home in January against Davidson, Penn
State and North Carolina State indicated that the upset
of Duquesne might not be a fluke‘ But as always, the

the Mountaineers outlasted a Panther rally to win in a
contest which will be remembered as the ‘garbage
game.” Two technical fouls were assessed against Pitt
because of debris thrown onto the court by a handful
of students, and those ”T’s” had much to do with the
Pitt defeat. In the return engagement at WVU’s new
Coliseum, A WVU basket in the final three seconds
sunk the Panthers after a tight contest. Senior Bill
Downes and junior Kent Scott handled the starting
backcourt duties most of the season for the Panthers.
And Paul O’Gorek showed great improvement in the
center position, while sophomore Carl Morris and lunior
Mike Paul Manned the forward posts. Ed ”Buzzy” Har-
rison, a sophomore, sparked the cagers in his role as
the sixth man throughout the year and broke into the
starting five when Paul injured his ankle late in the
season. Future Pitt basketball teams will benefit from
the outstanding freshmen who produced an impressive
11-4 mark under Cub coach Tim Grgurich; such as
Mickey Martin who led the team in scoring, and Jim
Bolla who paced the squad under the boards. Sam
Fleming, Ken Waggoner and Gary Pagano also con-
tributed to the effort. Players like these point to a fine
future for Pitt basketball.

ATHLETICS I BASKETBALL

The Pitt wrestling coaches spent most of the
1970-71 season searching their souls for the
reason behind the curse which they apparently
incurred. The wrestlers suffered an unbelieve-
able string of injuries, accidents and freak cir-
cumstatnces which forced them to use third —
and fourth — string men in the varsity line-up
toward the end of the season. The grapplers
posted an 8-3-1 mark despite the injury jinx,
but their tournament hopes were shattered
when only two regulars remained in the start-
ing line-up. The problems began the summer
before the grap season got underway when
second unit wrestler Joe Schanz was killed in
an auto accident. Then the injuries began to
arise. Willie Saloky suffered a fractured skull in
a street fight after the second match of the
season (and after a personal 2-0 record). Ralph

Cindrich, top heavy—weight, was declared out
for the season because of a football injury.
Mark Payne, considered the most talented
wrestler on the team, incurred the wrath of the
NCAA rules comittee when he insisted on
sporting shoulder—length hair. He was sus-
pended from the line-up, but he eventually
visited a barber and returned for one match
before once again leaving the team — this time
permanently for "personal reasons.” Mark’s
brother Randy, Navy Plebe champion and run-
ner-up in the Nationals in 1969-70, withdrew
from school at the time of his brother’s resig-
nation from the team. And there were more
injuries — Steve Weiss, another e><—Plebe win-
ner, was sidelined with a knee injury, and Bud
Smeltz was put out of the line-up at times by a
back injury. Only John Chatman and Bob Kuhn

The word for Pitt track since Jim Banner became head
coach in 1966 has been triumphant, and 1970-71
proved to be no exception. Indoors, Banner’s track
men made a run at perennial Eastern Champion Villa-
nova and placed second in the |C4A’s. They then
finished eighth nationally for the second year in a row.
Yet the 1970-71 season marked the end of an era, as
Jerry Richey, Bryan Salter, and Smittie Brown con-
cluded spectacular careers which included re—writing
the Pitt record books. While contributing a major
share, this trio of seniors did not account for ”all” of
the Pitt track successes. Hope for the future appeared
in the forms of Bill Rea (jumping), Dorel Watley
(mid-distance), and Dan Kouvolo (javelin). On Febru-
ary 24, headlines were made as Richey and Brown
were joined by Watley and John Aiken in a Distance
Medley Relay race at the Delaware Invitational. The
quartet exploded to break a world record — an accom-
plishment which comes along once in a lifetime for
even the best of college coaches. Richey wound up his
career by gaining two All-American ratings.

Richey is from the Pittsburgh area, and the predomi-
nance of local talent on Banner’s squad amazed him as
he talked about the 70-71 competition. Of the
twenty-five athletes who competed regularly for Ban-
ner during the year, twenty—two of them were from
Western Pennsylvania.

ATH LETIC I TRAC

Dick
words from Charles Dickens to de-

Bradshaw borrowed some
scribe the 1970-71 Pitt swimming
season! ’’It was the worst of times; it
was the best of times,” said Brad-
shaw, who began the year as the
assistant swim coach and ended it
as the head coach.

For a while it appeared that it would
only be the worst of times, as the
swimmers protested, swam and lost,
and finally quit the team. And even-
tually, with three meets remaining

on the schedule, head coach Bill
Grant resigned for ”personal rea-
sons” which had much to do with
the complaints of the swimmers.

The team kept losing and the swim-
mers gripes revolved around Grant.
Swimmers said their coach didn’t
recruit, didn’t plan workouts, didn’t
turn in line-ups early enough, didn't
maintain rapport with the team
members, and don’t know how to
correct strokes. Grant denied the
allegations, but eventually reached

the decision to step down.

The swimmers surpisingly won tW1
of their remaining meets unde
Bradshaw, as the times of all mem
bers improved (including five c
those who left the squad unde
Grant, only to return when Brac
shaw assumed reins of the team).

Under Bradshaw, four swimmer

Something was a little different for the
gymnastics team this year. The rarity?
— Coach Warren Neiger possessed a
squad with depth in 1970-71, five se-
niors, a junior, and five sophomore let-
terman. With this excess of bodies,
then, the gym coach had reason to be-
lieve his team would produce its first
winning season in five years.

Instead, the gymnasts’ overall perfor-
mance wasn’t any different from the
past. At the season’s end the record
was an unexpected 2-8. Once again,
the only truly proud moments were
supplied by Lowell Meek, who com-
pleted his Pitt career with another reg-
ular season of undefeated competi-

tion (his second in two years). Meek
also successfully defended his Eastern
championship in free exercise, while
the Pitt squad placed seventh in ar
eight team field. Meek went on tc

Michigan University as Pitt's only
representative to the NCAA finals anc
scored highest in the optional routine
of the free exercise.

A poor showing in the compulsory
exercise, however, prevented Meel
from claiming a national title. Witl
Meek and the other four seniors leav
ing, Neiger won’t have the comfort o
depth next year. But, somehow, a 2-2
record seems to make that comfor
insignificant.

ATH LETICS I GYMNASTICS

It wasn’t really official, but there was a new sport at
Pitt in 1971. As ice hockey was just beginning to be-
come successful on the professional level in Pitts-
burgh, it shouldn't be surprising that a group of
hockey enthusiasts at Pitt rapidly became as successful
as the varsity teams while competing on the club level.
Thanks to the help of an outsider, Wade Welsh of the
Alpine Ice Chalet who coached the ”Pitt Ice Hockey
Team”, the group played eight games and posted a
4-3-1 record against opposition which was more estab-
lished in every instance. Freshman Joe Testa founded
the squad. It is now struggling financially, but it hopes
to someday become an official varsity sport.

ATHLETICS I ICE HOCKEY

The Pitt rifle team dropped from a 10-4
record in 1969-70 to a 5-9 mark in
1970-71. In the process, the squad
slipped from a first to a fifth place
finish in the seven—member West-Penn
Rifle Conference.

As in the past, the riflemen were hurt
by a lack of steady coaching. Sgt. Bill
Fausey of ROTC was the part-time
mentor this year, and he represented
the fourth rifle coach at Pitt in four
years. All of the coaches have come
from ROTC where the annual turnover
rate is extremely high.

The riflers’ five wins were established
by beating CMU, Grove City, and
Washington and Jefferson once each,
and Cenva twice.

At the sectionals, which were held at
the riflers’ home range, the team
placed seventh in a field of eighteen.

Top shooters in ’70—71 were senior Bill
Crooks, juniors Bruce Barrett and
Wade Robertson, sophomore Tim
Schmidt and freshman Howard Ash-
brook.

ATHLETICS I RlFLE

There were five separate leagues in the three major
intramural sports during 1970-71. Softball, football and
basketball teams competed in the Grad-Fac, the Frater-
nity, the Dormitory, the Engineering and the Indepen-
dent leagues. Only the Independent division didn't run
competition for an overall classification champion. But
the battles were fierce in the other four leagues:
GRAD-FAC: Economics took the overall Grad-Fac divi-
sion crown with 475 points. Although Econ only won
one championship (volleyball) its consistent perfor-
mances in all events earned the title. The Junior Dents
(409 pts.) and Baker’s Raiders (350 pts.) garnered titles
in basketball and football, respectively. FRATERNITY:
Phi Gamma Delta (Fiji) dominated the frat athletic cir-
cuit. On their way to capturing the All-Sports Trophy
awarded to the fraternity accumulating the highest
point total in IM competition, the Fiji's captured three
championships — football, basketball and wrestling. Pi

Kappa Alpha won track and volleyball titles in the frat
competition, while Phi Kappa Theta took a first place in
swimming, and Delta Tau Delta conquered the other
softball teams. DORM: Sutherland House rolled to the
overall dormitory honors, gaining first places in basket-
ball and football. Mad House won the softball cham-
pionship and finished second to Sutherland in the ov-
erall league standings. ENGINEER: The Civil Engineers,
tallying 662 points, nearly doubled the point production
of the runner-up Mechanical Engineers (348 pts.) as
the Civils romped to the Engineering division crown.

The Civils won the cage competition and the Mechan-
ics triumphed on the gridiron. There were three
Al|—Campus team champions. Made House overpow-
ered the opposition on its way to the softball title.
Baker’s Raiders prevailed over Sutherland in sudden
death to capture the football crown. And the Black
Flashed became the A|l—Campus basketball quintet by
emerging as the only undefeated team out of a record
77 which competed in 1971.

ATHLETICS I INTRAMURALS

Before the 1971 season began for the Pitt
baseball team, just about every player had one
goal in mind — a trip to the NCAA District
2 post-season tournament.

The prospects appeared sound since basically
the same Panther team was in contention
until the final week of the competition the
year before. Coach Bobby Lewis’ mitters, as
expected, were among the best in '71, but
their 18-8 record once again was only enough
for a close miss at tourney nomination. A
late season double header loss to Penn State
was the disastrous blow which cancelled out
the previous efforts of the season. Penn State
(10—4 at selection time) was named to the
NCAA playoffs.

However, the Pitt squad did win the Turn-
pike Tourney of Cleveland, Ohio during the
season.

The '71 season, with its close miss, ran pri-
marily as expected with a few exceptions.

Pitt’s only losses from the 1970 season were
in the infield, but replacements Ken Macha
(first base), Boab Livingston (second base)
and Terry Stokes came through well enough
to be named to the third annual Tri-State
Baseball Coaches Association All-Star game.
Other Panthers selected to the game were
pitcher Mike Niccols, right fielder Bob Solo-
nickne, and catcher Guy Capzarelli. This was
the third consecutive All-Star game for Solo-
nickne, the Pitt captain,

This year’s mound staff had a good deal of
depth. ln addition to Niccols fine performance
as the Panther’s top pitcher, Mike Fedoris,
the number four starter, fired a no—hitter late
in the season. This was Pitt’s first in sixteen
years.

ATH LETICS I BASEBALL

Based on individual performance,
the tennis season could be termed
successful. The original squad

squeezed a victory out of the tough
W.V.U. rivals for openers. Then, top
player Joel Hurwitz received a job
offer as a senatorial page in Harris-
burg and decided to leave the team.

Recruit Mike Pines, also quit in favor
of a job opportunity and number
two man, Mike O’Loughlin, went on
tour with the Pitt Men's Glee Club
for a week. A depth problem ensued
and the team lost the next four
meets by wide margins. in cross—city
competition the tennis players de-
feated Duquesne, but lost to the
always powerful C.M.U. squad in a
battle of close sets.

At the inauguration of the Big Four
Tennis Meet at Penn State, the Pitt
netmen failed to score, but Coach
Fran Webster felt that new number
one man, Gary Schwartz, ”put in a
good showing”, and that the rest of
the team, ”saw some good tennis
played.” The remainder of the sea-
son was disappointing, with most of
the matches being lost by wide
margins. The season record was

ATHLETICS I TENNIS

2-13. However, every player had some
taste of victory during the season.
Jorge Gutierrez won only one sin-
gles match during the year, but it
was a memorable one. Against Hir-
am, Gutierrez outlasted his opposi-
tion, 21-19, in a deciding set — that’s
a Pitt longevity record. Gutierrez
also teamed with Schwartz to form
the most productive Pitt doubles
team and netted three wins in ’71.

The Pitt golfers, after losing their opening and closing
games, still managed to record their greatest season in years.
The linksmen, suffering their first defeat of the season at the
hands of W.V.U., recovered to defeat Bucknell and Clarion.
Unfortunately, Indiana University defeated the local boys in
stroke play, but Pitt followed by defeating Duqesne, a local
rival. The golfers traveled to State College for the Big 4
Championship with Syracuse, W.V.U., and host Penn State.
However, the golfers escaped with a second place.

The linksmen then traveled to defeat St. Vincents College
and returned home for a victory over Cleveland State. The

following week the Pitt golfers conquered Allegheny Col-
lege, but this victory was followed by a defeat to Westmin-
ister College. At this point, sporting a 6-2 record, it ap~
peared the golfers were challenging Penn State for the East-
ern Championship. However, the Panthers folded in the
clutch and finished 13th. Then on to the Indiana State Golf
Tourney, where Pitt hoped to find their winning groove
again against the four school competition, but Pitt placed
only third in the tourney. The Pitt golfers closed their sea-
son against Navy, losing in medal play. One bright point of
the season, Freshman, Steve Kosalac was elected MVP of
the year by his fellow players.

ATH LETICS I GOLF

Five women’s teams competed
on the varsity level in 1970-71,
and as expected there was the
mixture of success and failure.

The women’s tennis team
highlighted the competition
among the women represent-
ing Pitt. The girl netters, under
the guidance of Goldie Ed-
wards compiled an impressive
10-0 record against established
teams. Miss Edwards, by the
way, is a nationally ranked
tennis and squash player.

Senior tennis star Elaine Kingas,
Pitt’s number two player, was
invited to the Eastern tourna-
ment, but could not attend
because of midterm schedul-
ing.

The women’s basketball team
was also unbeatable in '71 —
after their first two games, as
they won their last nine to reg-
ister a 9-2 season.

The high point of the year was
an upset victory against top
rival Slippery Rock. A last sec-
ond basket by Jan Klause
pushed the girl cagers past the
Rockets, 44-42.

The women's swimming team
couldn’t compile a record
comparable to the basketball
and tennis players, but the Vir-
ginia Grindle-coached swim-
mers were able to break a few
records while splashing to a
2-3 season.

Five consecutive mid—season

wins saved the women's field
hockey team from a disastrous
season which opened and
closed on a losing (and tying)
note. The girls’ season record
was five wins, three losses, two
ties — with all of the losses and

ties coming at the beginning or
end of the year.

The women’s gymnastic team
was not as fortunate and
finished 70-71 with a losing
mark of two wins and four
losses.

Pitt athletics is not confined to the Stadium and
Field House. Often, on a late autumn afternoon,
students battle for a football in front of Heinz
Chapel, or foreign students chase a soccer ball on
the lower Cathedral lawn. Even the Towers’ Patio is
the scene of many frisbee tournaments among dorm
students. In an urban university outside recreation
areas are often scarce, and what little exists is van-
ishing due to the University being forced to expand
in a limited area. With the gym and playing fields at
such an inconvenient location, students need a
Cathedral lawn.

There are three basic types of
groups at Pitt, the publications,
the honoraries, and the organi-
zations. They are all alike in
that the student can participate
in varying degrees. For some
students, a group is only a
name on a graduate school
application, while for others, it
is their focal point at Pitt. But,
as with courses, the amount of
learning and experience that a
group offers depends on the

interest and work of the mem-
ber.

Another similarity is the
financial problems faced by
most groups which centers

around operating on limited
budgets and fighting for alloca-
tions. The financial problems
of all groups are reified by the

University bureaucracy and
union control of services. The
groups must alwyas deal with
the University under a purchas-
ing system which puts student
organizations at a disadvan-
tage. University departments
and ”other” groups seem pit-
ted against one another in an
effort to assert their own im-
portance. The one most guilty
group is the new Student Asso-
ciation whose leaders want
great amounts of money and
control, usually at the sake of
other groups.

One thing is certain, belonging
to a group can be a great
learning experience, ”profita-
ble” experience, "ego” experi-
ence, or as for many, a frustra-
ting experience.

Next to scuttlebut, the Pitt News is the prime medium on
campus. With a circulation of 12,000, the Pitt News has
tried to lead students toward a new consciousness. Un-
like many, the Pitt News has been mindful of the need to
be fair and responsible in the process. This approach is
rooted in traditional journalistic ethics. But it also repre-
sents a rebellion from the pompour myopia of establish-
ment types which students find repugnant. Recognizing
that it is a mini—establishment, the Pitt News has avoided
pat creeds, whether they emanate from conservatives or
freaks. It has staked out a commitment to truth, which
has led it to criticize students as well as administrators.
The Pitt News has endeavored to steer a course midway
between the zealous dogmatism of 1968 and the listless
dispair of today. Because the Pitt News combines convic-
tion with agnosticism, it sometimes appears ambivalent.
The Pitt News readily pays that price, in order to be both
influential and fair.

The 1971 Polaris will try to be more than a
traditional yearbook of pictures and names
of incoming freshmen. Instead, the publica-
tion will try to present crucial and relevant
issues not only of significance to the Uni-
versity community, but also of importance to
people everywhere.

For this reason, there won't be the standard
list of campus organizations in the Polaris,
but rather it is hoped that the issues pre-

The Skyscraper Engineer is the official publi-

ly, this magazine contains material written
by students and professors and is of a tech-
nical nature. However, this was a year of
change for the Skyscraper. Perhaps the best
way to describe it is, ”heart”. There were
more in depth articles about the role of en-
gineers in the betterment of mankind along
with articles questioning existing engineer-
ing practices on and off the campus. Along
with these changes, the editor out of re-
spect for his magazine, his profession,
women, and himself decided not to print
the much disputed ”technicutie”. But the
real reward for their efforts lies in the fact
that many non-engineers are reading the
magazine.

Women’s Choral, a musical organization at the
University of Pittsburgh, originated in 1928 with a
choir of ten girls who sang together for enjoyment.
Since then Choral has developed into a forty-voice
group which performs at various University func-
tions and with Men's Glee Clubs from colleges and
universities in Pennsylvania and surrounding states.

The repertoire of music is widely varied, including
anything from sacred, folk, and show tunes to spiri-
tuals and contemporary selections.

Plans for the coming year include the installation of
a new director and tours to Ohio, Eastern Pennsyl-
vania, and Washington, D.C.

pershing rifles

 

Pershing Rifles Co. K-5, also known as the University of Pitts-
burgh Drill Team, had one of the best records of any Pitt team
this past season. Going to five drill meets in the Eastern United
States, the PR’s took four trophies and defeated Villanova
Universities Navy Drill team, considered by most experts as
the finest team in the East. They also defeated Gannon Col-
lege, last year’s National Champions.

The team consists of nine men, but membership in the Com-
pany was 16. In addition to drilling, Pershing Riflemen engage
in other social and charitable activities. Contrary to popular
belief, ROTC is no longer a requirement for membership with
50% of the drill team being made up of non—ROTC students.

pitt hosts

 

It is the job of Pitt Hosts and Hostesses to give

campus tours to prospective students. It is
through this first meeting with a Pitt student that
high school seniors form their initial impressions
of the University. The job of the Hosts and Hos-
tesses is to describe life at Pitt, keeping in mind
that often their answers help the prospective stu-
dent decide whether or not Pitt is the right place.

unicycle club

 

The University of Pittsburgh is privileged to have
among its organizations the newly formed unicycle
club. its members meet frequently and practice
cycling for fun and for the physical fitness benefits
derived from the sport. Membership is open to any-
one with experience in unicycling or the desire to
learn. This past year the club, while becoming es-
tablished, managed to be part of the Greek Week
parade. The members are looking forward to success
in the upcoming year.

commuter association

 

The Commuter Association was established to make the
University Community more aware of the problems faced
by the more than six thousand students who commute. This
year the CA endeavored to solve parking problems, help
arrange the erection of two bus shelters, hold social events
for commuters, and get the University to provide more facil-
ities. In addition, we published a newspaper, The Magic
Bus, which helped create an awareness of commuter prob-
lems on campus.

men’s dorm cou ncil

 

Men’s Dorm Council, the representative group of men
elected from those living in the dorms, is the legislative
body of all men residents on campus‘. With the addition of
men in McCormick Hall this year, ivlen’s Dorm Council ex-
tended its influence from the Towers Complex into the
Quad. MDC serves both Cultural and conforming purposes,
sponsoring a range of activities such as speakers, TClF’s, and
intramural sports competition between houses. Freedom is
the key word for the dorms, now, with 24 hour open houses
for both men and women and MDC in conjunction with
Women’s Housing Board provided the major impetus for
these reforms.

associated women students

Involvement was a key word for A.W.S. this
year. In September, we sponsored Feminist
Symposium which brought in such noted
women as Sheila Tobias, Florence Howe,
and Angela Schreiber. The Activities Fair was
jointly sponsored by A.W.S., giving students
a chance to find out ways they can become
involved. Political involvement was ex-
pressed through A.W.S. co—sponsorship of
Politico '70, a program which brought to Pitt
several candidates for city and statewide
ofﬁces. Northern lreland’s spirited member
of Parliament, Bernadette Devlin, spoke at
Pitt under the sponsorship of A.W.S. Also
the traditional programs of A.VV.S., such as
_Lantern Night and Freshman Council contin-
used to be part of the group's activities.

 

pitt road racing team

Pitt has America’s first university road racing
team. Sponsored by American Oil, Pepsi
Cola, and Goodyear, the Camero has several
victories to its name. It has been entered in
rough competition such as the Bridehampton
Nationals in New York, the Trans America
Race in Limerock, Connecticut, and the
Cumberland Transam in Cumberland, Md.

The Pitt Road Racing Team is not just a club
or group of people — it is a team, and the
victories and honors are not won by the
machine and driver alone. Scheduling, spon-
sorship, accomodations, testing, transporta-
tion, and publicity are only a few of the du-
ties of the team. The Road Racing Team was
led this year by driver Bob Fryer and busi-
ness manager Robert Ledermanr

men's glee club

 

The University of Pittsburgh Men’s Glee Club,
founded in ‘I890, is the oldest extracurricular or-
ganization on campus. In recent years it has be-
come one of the most innovative groups of its
kind throughout the nation. This year, in addition
to its two successful home concerts, the Glee
Club took weekend tours to eastern Pennsylvania
and New York. The season climaxed with a
week—long tour during which the Glee Club car-
ried the University’s name to schools in Ohio,
Michigan, and Wisconsin. Wherever they ap-
peared, enthusiastic audiences greeted the Club
with rousing applause. On the latest tour, the
Glee Club received three standing ovations.

The Glee Club is under the capable direction of
Phillip Cavanaugh, a young musicologist who
graduated from Indiana State and Columbia
Universities. Mr. Cavanaugh is currently com-
pleting his doctorate in musicology at Pitt.

engineering cabinet

As the representative body governing all engineer-
ing undergraduates the Cabinet controls such areas
as interdepartmental athletics, the Benedum Hall
lockers and lounge, the ESCIT Award for overseas
summer employment, the Outstanding Senior
Award, and freshman orientation for engineers. The
organization also has a voice in the school’s curricu-
lum policies, the activities of Engineer’s Week, the
publication of the Engineering Bulletin, and the
funding of the Skyscraper Engineer.

This year Engineering Student Cabinet concentrated
its efforts on Engineer’s Week and the dedication of
Benedum Hall — the new home for Pitt’s eight engi-
neering departments. The most important policy
change proposed by Cabinet was an overhaul of the
Liberal Arts program for engineers‘ Cabinet was led
this year by an executive committee comprised of
John Cira, Ron Cronsky, Dennis Yeskey, Ed Cerger—
ich, Barry Sicard, and John Kapustay.

GROUPS I ORGANIZATIONS

cheerleaders

Whether in front of a crowd at a
football game or a pep rally, the
cheerleaders are the source of en-
thusiasm and spirit for the Pitt
athletic teams. In blue and gold,
these spunky individuals initiate the
cheers at the football and basketball
games. Aided by the antics of the
costumed Panther, the cheerleaders
attempt to intensify the enthusiasm
of the student body and to keep it
at a fever pitch until the final seconds
of the game. The girls also partici-
pate in Freshman Camp, Orientation
Week, and aid in public relations
promotions. The squad is chosen on
the basis of ability, appearance, and
poise.

student union board

The Student Union Board is a pro-
gramming organization relying on the
creativity, imagination, and effort of
its students and staff members. Pro-
grams and activities of the union
have been developed and admini-
stered by students. The Board is
divided into four committees.

Sally Kalson is the chairman of the
Public Affairs Committee whose pri-
mary function is to present distin-
guished speakers in fields of interest
to the University Community. its
program also allows for other pre-
sentations such as forums, debates,
panel discussions, and documentary
films. Programs sponsored by Public
Affairs this year included Dick Greg-
ory, The Amazing Kreskin, The
White Roots of Peace (a North Ameri-
can Indian communications group),
a week—long symposium on crime
featuring Arlen Spector and Peter
Maas, a drug play performed by ex-
addicts from Marathon House re-
habilitation center, and a documen-
tary film series.

The Social Committee which is
headed by Barbara Johnson aims to
fulfill the ”social life” needs of the
Pitt student. lts program consists of
dances,popularflicks,andtwo Coffee
Houses per term. Concerts are also
sponsored through this committee.

The Committee on the Arts (COTA)
is chaired by Bill fvlolchen. It spon-
sors programs in the performing arts.
This year’s programs included Gen-
esis Ill, Blues Festival, and the Na-
tional Shakespeare Company in
’’Much Ado About Nothing.”

Bob Howanek. The group is designed
to serve as coordinator of the Board’s
activities. It provides publicity and
advertises for the programming com-
mittees, represents the Student
Union at University-wide functions,
and assists in the organization of the
University Brochure.

There are two sides to Cwens’ activities.
First, there is the more traditional, these in-
clude serving at chancellor receptions, act-
ing as Parents’ Weekend guides, and as lan-
tern bearers during Lantern Night. This side
is ”constructive activism”. In October,
representatives of the Pittsburgh Women's
Union spoke to the Cwens about Women’s
Liberation. In November, the Pitt-CMU
Karate Club gave a demonstration which
really cracked everybody up, especially
when program director Joan cracked a
two-inch board with her elbow. Her elbow
will be on display during the next Lenox
china showing. The January meeting was
devoted to a lecture and film on drug addic-
tion. Other activities included working at
the Louise Day Car Center, CASP, and help-
ing to establish better communications be-
tween students and state legislators.

The purpose of Cwens? It is to foster leader-
ship, scholarship, and the spirit of service
among young college women.

Mortar Board is the only national Senior Honorary for women
and this organization has been active on Pitt's campus since
1923. It attempts to select its members for their scholarship,
leadership, and service to the University. These ideals are put
into action through various programs dealing with current
problems and issues. Again this year, the women sponsored a
series of career seminars during which members of various
fields and professions came to the campus to answer ques-
tions and provide first-hand vocational information.

titusville campus

Titusville campus is 27 miles east of Meadville
on Route 27, and an hour south of Jamestown,
New York. Route 8 goes south to Interstate 80.

It is a two-year Campus with most of its classes
being held in old McKinney Hall, a mansion
which was bequeathed to the University. In
addition, there are the Bennett Davis Memorial
Labs, housed only a half—block away. Girls town-
houses are a new idea in university housing,
with each townhouse being a separate apartment
housing eight girls. Plans for the expansion

of the campus are presently being made.

The Bradford Campus of the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh offers resident and
out—ot’—state students an atmosphere
of a small rural college, while still
maintaining the highest standards of
quality in education. It is presently
working to become an integral part
of the Bradford community, and
offers part—time and evening courses
to those who wish to further their
eduration at the University.

 

sgiv ‘

Progress at the Greensburg Campus has not
so far been reflected by the erection of

new buildings, but recent General State
Authority appropriation promises a multi-
purpose building in the near future. In

the meantime, some other signs of growth
can be seen.

The faculty indicated a desire to organize
its own senate to handle issues not covered
by the senate at the main campus. The
Creensburg Senate, which has been operating
since the Fall Term, ‘ cludes students as
participating members both at senate
meetings and on senate committees.

In the academic picture, students found
several new courses this year, including
Black Lit and Comparative Lit courses, the
sociology of work, and comparative political
theory.

The increasing library collection is a definite
aid to students. Its growth is indicated by a
move to larger quarters in order to accom-
modate the holdings.

While engineering majors enjoyed the use
of new lab facilities, biology students, as a
result or an agreement with Seton Hill
College, utilized Seton Hill's labs. This
arrangement served to eliminate evening lab
periods.

Budding journalists received credit while
working on the campus paper, The Forum,

by enrolling in a journalism seminar. Aspiring
dramatists, under the direction of lack Zaharia
of the Applehill Playhouse, presented ”You
Know I Can’t Hear You When the Water’s
Running.”

The varsity basketball team, in its second
year, doubled its schedule and achieved a
commendable 14-11 record. Jim Kubicek was
named Most Valuable Player of the Regional
Campus Tournament.

Community involvement, which has increased
in importance to the University, was the pur-
pose for the organization of the Environ-
mental Awareness Committee with membership
open to students, faculty, and citizens of
Westmoreland County.

Most Greeks would say that fraterni-
ties and sororities exist primarily to
provide members with friends, a
sense of belonging to a group, and
an outlet for social-group activities
(such as parties, projects, and
sports). Perhaps more importantly,
Greek organizations provide for and
encourage involvement in college
life both within and outside the
group. Once an individual has got-
ten in with a group, it is much easier
to get going in other things because
of the contacts made and the secu-
rity and experience gained. Further-
more, it seems that there would be
a real need for Greek groups on a
large, impersonal campus. If it is
accepted that large numbers of
people want friends, a group to be-
long to, a place for activities, and a
sense of involvement, then it is not
so easy to understand why the
number of people attending Greek
rush has not increased as the size of
the student body has grown, and
why the Greek system is relatively
less important in campus life now
than it was a few years ago.

‘Internally (in terms of the relation-

ships within an individual Greek
house) and externally (in terms of
what being a Greek means in the
rest of campus life), the Greek sys-
tem is profoundly different today
than it was a few years ago. The
changes which have taken place in

the owl looks

at greeks

 

he Greek system directly parallel
he changes in the University as a
whole, and they stem from the radi-
:al|y different make-up of the stu-
lent body.

'ears ago it cost to be a Greek, and

student paid with money, time,
nd emotional energy. The product
or sale, then, was very often a way
if life which was to some extent
oticeably different than for those
/ho did not pay. The largest group
»f customers was to be found
mong those students who came
‘om far away, and among those
/ho came to involve themselves in
we life of the University (these were
ften the same people). The thing

of lasting importance was not the
”status” of being a Greek, but the
difference in terms of having a sep-
arate identity. To be a Creek was to
have a ”home,” both physically and
socially, away from a former home.
The number of people who come to
Pitt from far away has declined in
recent years, and so this important
Creek market has shrunk. In addi-
tion, many people who wish to in-
volve themselves in the University
are .not choosing to follow the
Greek route. The Greek system has
no control over who comes to
school, and if the reason that people
are not choosing the Greek route to
involvement is because the price,
either in terms of money, time, or

emotional energy, is too high, there
is, again, little that can be done.
However, there may be those who
refuse to join because they do not
like the product being offered, and
those who, after they make an initial
purchase, become disenchanted
with what they thought and drop
out. What is most important to
understand is that years ago there
was a great demand for what the
Greek system had to offer within
itself, and there was little question-
ing of the nature of the product.
However, the demand is now con-
siderably smaller, and there are a lot
more questions being asked about
what is being offered for sale. As
such, the Greeks have been forced,

both from within (in terms of keep-
ing people in the group), and with-
out (in terms of getting people to
join the group), to appeal to a much
wider variety of customers than ever
before. Creeks, like the University,
have become much more service-
oriented in recent years and the
feeling that there exists, or should
exist a separate Greek identity is
much less widespread or strongly
felt.

Among the many Greek stereotypes
which are widely believed, two are
of special importance. They are the
ones which hold that Greeks de-
mand conformity and subservience,
and it is during the pledge period
that they are most clearly in evi-
dence. Pledging is the single most
important thing a Greek house has
to attend to, and the pledge period
is analogous to raising children (it is
no accident that fraternities and
sororities have pledge ”fathers”
and ”mothers”). It is a time in which
the prospective member is taught
what it means to be a Greek, and it
is also the time in which the older
members of an organization impart
to the new people the special
significance of that particular group.
It was the time in which the pledge
was ”molded” to fit into the Greek
way of life, but it is no longer so.

Greeks no longer mold their pledges
because they feel people will not
submit themselves to be molded,
and because there is no agreement
within any group as to what a
pledge should look like, or whether
a process of molding should take
place at all. Every Creek house at
Pitt goes to great lengths to empha-
size the diversity which exists within
each house in an effort to dispel the
image of demanding conformity.
Physical hazing of pledges, the hall-
mark of the college fraternity, has
entirely disappeared within the last
four years, and just about every fra-
ternity has modified its pledging so
as to encourage the integration of
the pledge into the brotherhood as

quickly as possible and with min-
imum restriction. Similarly, formal
pledging requirements, which used
to mark the typical sorority, have
been eliminated in favor of a much
more informal, friendship-encour-
aging environment. There is a dis-
tinct trend towards the abolition of

the pledge period in its entirety, and

the substitution of an ”associate—
member” status, and the object
of this is to bring the pledge into
the group and away from the sub-
servient role as quickly as possible.

This revolution in the form and sub-
stance of pledging has not been

accomplished entirely without strife
within individual groups. Many
older members felt that to eliminate
the rigorous pledging program
would serve to undermine the foun-
dation of group stability, as fewer
and fewer demands were placed
upon the pledge. If pledges were
not forced to sacrifice something to
get into the group, then there would
be a loss of group pride, and a re-
duced willingness to work hard for
group improvement in later years.
The old—sty|e Greek group leaned
heavily on the concept of "pledge-
class unity”, and a definitive pledge-
role was thought necessary to foster
such a group feeling.

The pledge is no longer the one
who cleans up after the brothers
and runs out to get food at night.
There are few formal pledge activi-
ties, and fewer still which a pledge
is required to attend. Groups now
emphasize cooperation between
older and newer people, and mem-

bers are supposed to pitch in and
help with everything that used to be
done by pledges. The fact that such
a larger number of pledges are also
commuting students has much to do
with the shift in the role of the
pledge. Because commuters have a
host of other roles which they must
continue to play, it is especially hard
to bring them all together and to
command their full commitment.

What has happened is that the
Greek ”family” has become a much
more equalitarian group, and much
more conscious of serving the indi-
vidual needs of its members and
pledges. Many groups have also
reacted to the stereotype of the so-
cially un-concerned (or even conser-
vative) Greek, by emphasizing the
social- and community-service proj-
ects that each group carries out,
and the trend is towards group
sponsorship of cultural and social
affairs for the membership to a
much larger extent than before. All

of this is in the direction of offering
more to the Creek member in the
way of individual development.

However, while the Greek system
has been reacting to the pressure of
serving a wide variety of demands,
so has the University been respond-
ing to the same pressures. As the
internal structure of the Greek sys-
tem has loosened up and expanded
to accommodate many differentkinds
of values, so has the University ex-
panded, and the effect has been to
blur the lines separating the Greeks
from the rest of campus life. While
it is true that Greek Week is the sin-
gle most successful social event of
the year, and that it is the Greeks
who set up the booths and make
the floats and cheer the athletic
teams, it is also true that all of these
social activities are only important
to special interest groups and much
less important in the total life of the
school. The Greeks have become,
rather than a dominant influence,

another special interest group. What
is critically important to understand
here is that it has been the social
expansion of the University which
has caused the relative decline in
the importance of being Creek at
Pitt. In addition to it no longer
being necessary to be Creek in or-
der to get involved and lead the
major campus organizations, it is no
longer necessary to join a fraternity
or sorority to get in with a group of
people with similar values — there
are many more such groups on
campus now because there are
many more values (life styles) which
are finding expression. Membership
in a Greek group is now one mem-
bership among many; it is one more
place to go to get out of the college
experience what a student wants.
The fact that pledges no longer are
required to wear a special kind of
uniform to let the campus know
that they are Greeks symbolizes the
decline of a separate group identity,
and the fact that Greek Week can
no longer be held without a large
contribution from the Student Activ-
ities Fee further weakens the
boundary line. Ethnic background,
formerly the singlemost important
qualification for membership, is not
nearly as important as it used to be,
nor can it be in the future.

It is ironic that as the Greek system
has become progressively more
open, it has come to resemble more
closely other campus groups. By
stressing cultural and social activi-
ties, social service projects, and in-
volvement in campus life, the Greek
system places itself in direct compe-
tition with the expanding University.
The result is that it seems to
the student that it is friends that
cost money. Everything else is avail-
able elsewhere, and for free. The
personal meaning of being a Creek
in 1971, however, is exactly the same
as it was in 1967 — it means to be-
long to a group and share a group
identity. What has changed is that
there are many more such groups at
Pitt now than ever before, so that

any one group is less important in
the total scene, and that there are
fewer people who are willing, or
able, to make such an all-inclusive’
commitment to one group as was
formerly true. The fact that pledges
no longer are kidnapped and left
out in Plum Boro, or are made to
pay a fine for not having a date does
not necessarily mean that people
will be any less involved in Greek
life. Rather, it seems that the form
and/or substance of pledging is
largely irrelevant if someone really

wants to remain in the

join or
group. The same may be said of
Greek housing — it is the group it-
self and not the physical container
which is of lasting importance. In

recent years, many houses have
experienced sharp internal conflicts
concerning drug use (drug use in a
Greek house may result in the dis-
banding of a chapter), and how
each house should deal with the
issue. Many members chose to
dis—affiliate during the original clash
between life—.s" “‘ issue has

since been accommodated. In addi-
tion to drug use and the natural
dis—affiliation rate within each group
(usually older people finding other
interests), there is the money in-
volved. It has always been true that
out—of—staters come from families
with higher incomes than do in-
staters, so perhaps there are fewer
people coming to Pitt who can

afford to become Greeks.

The Greek system, contrary to popu-
lar opinion, has not died at the
University of Pittsburgh. Nor should
anyone hold their breath while wait-
ing for its expiration. There will be
people who will want the basic
things that being a Greek has to
offer, and people who will want to

commit themselves to maintaining
the organization. There will also be
a need for the Greek system at Pitt,
though less of a need than in the

past. Greeks, except perhaps for
their pride, have not been severely
wounded. it very simply has, since it
is part of a changing University,
adapted itself to a different environ-
ment.

Panhellenic Council is the unifying force behind the
13 sororities on the Pitt campus. In the past year
Pan—Hel realized the need for the Greek system to
adapt to the changing mood on the college campus,
and implemented this change through greater in-
volvement in University and community service proj-
ects. Within the system itself Pan—Hel made im-
provements on the rushing and pledging procedures
in order to benefit the individual interested in join-
ing a social sorority. It instituted the Rush Coun-
selor program, aimed at aiding freshmen women
having questions concerning the Creek System.

As in the past, Pan—Hel was co-sponsor, with |.F.C.,
of Greek Week, which offers a time for the Pitt so-
rorities and fraternities to relax and have fun while
working together for the various events of the week.

What is ADPi? It is a blending of many persons, their varied
ideas and personalities, united by a common bond of
friendship. It is this friendship that spurs the sisters on to a
myriad of activities. Looking back on the past year ADPi ac-
tivities included participation in campus events, such as
Winter Weekend and Greek Week, working together on
charity projects, and the enjoyment of social events, includ-
ing the annual Black and White Formal. Yes, it can be seen
that Alpha Delta Pi offers something for everyone.

”Keeping active strengthens our bonds”, was AEPhi’s motto
this past ”busy” year. The sisters of AEPhi involved themselves
in campus, community, and social activities. The fall term
found the sisters initiating a charity project with the brothers
of ZBT involving children of the South Oakland Community
Center. Socially the highlight of the fall was the Parents Week-
end affair held at the Bigelow Restaurant. Returning after term
break AEPhi bounded back by repeating their Rent-/—\n—AEPhi
program for the benefit of American lndians, during Winter
Weekend. Greek Week 1971 proved successful for the girls of
green and white as they sang their way to third place in Greek
Sing, and one of the sisters, Patty Brown was named Greek
Week Talent Queen. This year ended with the Spring Affair
which included a dinner and play at the Playhouse.

Pittsburgh Hearing and Speech Society. We had our fun and

good times at our Christmas dinner dance, our Spring Formal

on the Party Liner, at mixers and by just being together. Shar-

ing our activities with each other encouraged many girls to

become active on campus. One sister was Pan Hel President

and next year one sister will be President of AWS. DZ’s were

also active as Mentors, Cwens, in Quo Vadis, and the Pitt

News. Delta Zeta is hard to describe since it’s all of us to-

gether giving something different to make Delta Zeta a whole.

Working together on the Pitt campus for five years, the Deephers
of Eta Chapter, this year, attained the pinnacle of sorority suc-
cess — taking first place in Greek Sing and Greek Week. Our sister-
hood and spirit have become stronger through social events,
community service projects, and sorority goals. We honored our
pledges with an annual semi-formal dinner-dance in the fall and
a formal dinner in the winter. Our mothers and alums were in-
vited to a tea in our suite with a handwriting analyst as entertain-
ment. We also invited a few guys who are particular friends to
membership in a Big Brother Club. We had two cookie sales for
Cystic Fibrosis and a painting party at the Home for Crippled
Children co—sponsored with ZBT as our service projects for the
year.

The Flower is nature’s gift of beauty . . . it grows free . . . It is a
sign of warmth and love.

If one plants the Flower in a garden with other flowers, it does
not lose its beauty — it is still beautiful and can lend its beauty to
the other flowers and they in turn can lend their beauty to it.

In the garden, The Flower does not lose its identity — it still
grows free and individually but it grows with the other flowers
and learns to share nature's elements with them.

The Flower is now viewed as both a single flower and as an im-
portant part of a beautiful garden — it is still a sign of warmth
and love and this sign is intensified by the other surrounding
flowers.

This is what Theta Phi Alpha Sorority is . . . A garden of flowers
. . . A garden of friendship.

The 1970-71 school year was a great year for the sisters of Kappa Alpha
Theta. The sorority was not only productive socially, but also academi-
cally. The year started outwith the usual mixers and the annual Pi Lam
Spaghetti Dinner.

With the help of the brothers of Zeta Beta Tau, the sorority took first
place with their Homecoming Display. The weekend was climaxed by
one of the sisters, Anne Thomas, being crowned Homecoming Queen.
Winter Rush brought nineteen new Thetas, one of the largest pledge
classes the sisters have taken. The new pledges, along with the active
sisters, participated in the annual St. Patrick’s Day Parade,-collecting
money for the Heart Fund. Greek Week also proved to be profitable,
with MaryAnn Gunneslman capturing first runner-rup in the Queen’s
Contest.

As for the academic achievement, the Theta’s president, Cherelyn
Mance was elected to Phi Beta Kappa. Other Thetas were honored by
being chosen for Thyrsa Amos. With these achievements in mind, the
sisters of Kappa Alpha Theta expect continued success in the coming
year

Through activities that reflect the varied interests of the Chapter
members, the Kappas strengthen their own bonds of friendship and
enlarge their total experience at Pitt through meeting people on
campus and in the Community. A friendship group can fulfill the
need for each individual to have her unique identity recognized by
every other member of the group, thus there is greater opportunity
to make use of individual talents and ideas. The most obvious char-
acteristic of Kappa Kappa Gamma is the variety of girls in the chap-
ter. The makes being a Kappa that much more of a learning experi-
ence.

Who are we? What did we do this past year? Blending laughter, silences,
tears, smiles. We join as individuals into a group. Scrambling eggs at
Sunday brunches for parents — friends. Chewing pizzas at a mixer while
watching a movie. Packing eight people into a V.W. to see ”Hair”. Putting
on once-a—year dresses for Final Parties while reciting our lines. Joining
hands at Rush parties to sing goodbye to new—found friends. Standing
on corners shouting ”Balloons — Peanuts! for UNICEF”. Walking back from
a workshop at Delta Phi covered with paint. Stringing crepe paper with
ZBT around our ”First Prize” booth at the carnival. As time flowed, we, as
a group, lived life this past year, only because ”our selfs” contributed to
the whole. '

”Phi Sig Spirit”, was abundant this past year, and was evi-
denced in all Phi Sig activities. Linked with this spirit was
the bond of sisterhood that tied the distinct personalities of
the group together. Phi Sigs were active in several campus
organizations, including Women's Choral and Women’s Ju-
dicial Board, and they participated in campus events, such
as Winter Weekend and Greek Week. All in all it was a
good year for the sisters of Phi Sigma Sigma; one which
gave prophecy of great years to come.

Chi Omega offers many things to many people. Chi O. is hav-
ing fun at parties and mixers. lt is also interested people work-
ing on community service and charity projects. But most of all
Chi Omega is a melting pot of ideas, thoughts, and personali-
ties channeled toward understanding and friendliness to all,
which shines forth in any endeavors undertaken by Chi
Omega.

The men of Delta Tau Delta shared many great experiences to-
gether in the past year. The year started off by the brothers sharing
themselves with interested men in a successful fall rush, which
added new faces and varied personalities to the group. Throughout
the year Delts enjoyed many great parties, mixers, and who could
forget Monday nights at the Luna. They joined forces in participat-
ing in intramural athletic contests, and in working with the sisters of
Kappa Alpha Theta during the events of Greek Week. Perhaps, the

greatest experience of the year was the sharing of friendship with
each other.

Momentum is a very important factor, as any aspiring football com-
mentator will tell you, and tell you, and tell you. So will the broth-
ers of ZBT. Following their success of last year, the Zeebs re-
turned in September to take the largest pledge class on campus.
Through the year, they took first place in Homecoming, Winter
Weekend, and Games People Play competitions. In Greek Week
they took third. The Beta Phi chapter also received an award for
their academic success from the National lnterfraternity Council. It
was given them for placing among the top twenty chapters in the
country with a quality point average that was more than 30%
above the national all-men's average.

With diversity as their keynote, ZBT tries to appeal to as wide a
range ofvindividuals as possible through their social, athletic, and
community service projects.

This year has brought many beneficial changes to Pi Lambda Phi.
Winter Weekend highlighted the activities, along with avid participa-
tion in the intramural sports program, Homecoming, and Greek Week.
The fraternity also boasts a high scholastic average with members of
the Druids, Omicron Delta Kappa, the Pitt News, the William Penn
Debate Union, and several members of the Student Government.
There exists a feeling of transition, that continues to grow and en-
sure the basis of genuine brotherhood.

The past year was quite successful for the brothers of Fiji, not
only while acting as a single unity, but also through individual
activities. While working together the brothers pooled their ath-
letic abilities and earned the l.F.C. all sports trophy for accumulating
the highest number of points among the 16 fraternities in intra-
mural competition. The brothers scored again this year by win-
ning the over-all Greek Week Trophy, while working with the
sisters of Chi Omega. Socially the group enjoyed many great par-
ties and mixers throughout the year.

Individually, members were represented in many campus activities
and also were elected to Druids, ODK, and Order of Omega
honoraries.

Success for a fraternity cannot be measured by trophies and honors

alone and Fiji’s success was best shown through its fraternalism
and brotherhood which extends to all its members.

he 7977 Owl is, as is every other
yearbook a direct reflection of the
personal style of its Editor. Chip’s
desire to make this Yearbook rep-
resent much more of Pitt than just
his particular viewpoint is both the
heart and soul of the Owl approach,
and the theme of all the innovations
introduced in the writing, photo-
graphing, and financing of this years
work. Chip’s style brought together
a very large and very active staff,
with many individuals making im-
portant contributions.

Sy Adler, the Associate Editor, earned
the respect of many people through
his work, advice, insight, sleepless
nights, and great energies. Perhaps
his most important contribution was
his 25-page computerized market
research report. As a result of it,
The Owl learned that yearbooks, in
a form such as this one is, may still
have some value. But, to list all of
Sy’s accomplishments would take up
too much space. Cindy Currens and
Alan Siegal accomplished a most

‘l
l

difficult task — they created a busi-
ness office and staff that brought
The Owl from a large debt back to
being a profitable publication. Their
sales campaigns, money raising tech-
niques, and budget streamlinings
served to solidify the financial future
of the Yearbook. Paul Salva had
three important achievements: he
demonstrated his ability to take
quality photographs, both color and
black—and—white; he processed all
the color photography in this volume;

lF.f’IiI

and, he restructured the Photo Office,
a source of financial waste, into an
efficiently running program with
happier photographers. David Bal-
dovski was responsible for many of
the layouts which appear in this
book, and his technical knowledge
was extremely helpfulthroughoutthe
production process. Karen Smith,
whose knowledge of yearbook af-
fairs ranged from business to editing,
performed many vital functions for
The Owl during 1971.

Two people from the American Year-
book Company, Sylvan Pinto, sales
representative, and Mark R. Stewart,
plant artist, helped in many ways.
Sylvan, in response to The Owl's
need to cut costs, arranged for the
production of this book at a rate we
could afford. Mark possessed an in-
sight into The Owl concept which
enabled him to create on paper that
which were vague thoughts in our
minds. Bernie Koperak, of the Uni-
versity's Office of Development and
Alumni Affairs, was responsible for
allowing us to make the Yearbook
available to many of Pitt’s former
graduates.

These are some of the individuals
who have contributed, but there are
many more who worked hard to
make this book what it is. We deeply
regret that these people will remain
nameless, but this should not detract
from their efforts.

Throughout all this, Chip Berger
served as coordinator in bringing
together all these diverse activities,
to make The 7977 Owl the com-
prehensive Yearbook we hope it is.
If this book gains the approval of the
people of the University of Pitts-
burgh, then we will all of us, the
’l97“l staff, share the credit.

The Owl, 1971, is printed
on 80# True White Enamel
paper. The type face is
Optima. It was printed by
the offset lithographic
process of the American
Yearbook Company, Cam-
bridge, Md. All halftone

& color reproduction is

in 150 line screen. Senior
pictures were taken by
Delma Studios of New York
City. Art work was supplied
by Mark Stewart of American
Yearbook and by Peoples
Oakland. The black—and-
white photographs in the
book are the work of under-
graduates of the University.
The color reproduction in
this volume are from prints
on Eastman Ektacolor pro-
fessional paper prepared by
Paul F. Salva, a Junior at the
University of Pittsburgh, "
from Eastman Ektacolor
negatives and from Eastman
Ektacolor internegatives.
