CHES OFBRILLIANCE

C olor can be seen in almost every as-
pect of the University of Pittsburgh.
Even the buildings help lend a certain
brightness to the campus.

Heinz Chapel, with it’s Gothic arches,
brings a sense of antiquity to the Uni-
versity. On a sunny day, its stained glass
windows emblazon the chapel with
warmth and color.

                While football and basketball continue
                     to be the centers of attention, the
               athletic teams in general continue in their
               pursuit of excellence.
                 The athletic program constitutes a major
               portion of the Pitt experience. Pitt has
               founded a tradition of establishing quality
               teams in every sport. Pitt has continued to
               recruit top players, as athletes from across
               the country come to realize the great poJon Wells photo tentials which Pitt athletics offer.
                 The quality of programs such as women's
               volleyball, swimming and track has in,9m     creased over the years, and continued to do
               so this year. Intramural sports programs
               have also grown and expanded, giving Pitt
               students the opportunity to achieve person               al excellence.
                 For participants and spectators alike, ath               letics add a touch of color to the overall
               experience at the University of Pittsburgh.

T    he University of Pittsburgh offers a
     wide spectrum of organizations in
which the students may take part. These
groups, some political, some social, some
musical, academic or athletic, enable the
students to supplement their educators with
valuable skills and experience.
  Organizations provide opportunity for
students to become more involved in the
workings of the University. They also serve
for the much needed release of academic
tension, and allow students to focus their
attention to something other than the classroom. In addition, organizations alow students to meet others with similar interests.
Many organizations, such as Army
R.O.T.C. and the Pitt News help in preparing students for their careers.
  Involvement in student organizations
can be a valuable part of the Pitt experience. It allows for a splash of color in the
tedium of every day college life.
There are a number of organizations open to the Pitt
student. Many are service related, such as the Amnesty
International letter writing campaigns. Others service
the Pitt community directly, such as the Resident Student Association.

CHEERLEADERS
  It all begins with grueling tryouts in February. By March,
about 22 men and women will be
chosen to be the Pitt cheerleading squad. Seen at football and
basketball games, the cheerleaders are always in top form.
  Practices are four days a week
for 2-3 hours, except during competition, when the practice time
becomes much more intense. The
cheerleaders also attend a camp
for 3 days at the end of the winter
term and 3 days before fall term.

T he Greek system at the University of
     Pittsburgh has been thriving since the
turn of the century. The strength of the
Greeks continues to grow as they take an
increasingly important role in the University.
  Annual Greek Week festivities, held each
spring, provide an opportunity for the
Greeks to raise funds for local and national
charities. In recent years, however, the
Greeks have extended their services to include the Pitt community, with the installation of night escort services, and a haunted house for students and members of the
Oakland community.
  The importance of the Greeks to the University can also be seen in that many hold
important positions on campus. Greeks
hold active positions in organizations such
as Student Government Board, athletics,
The Pitt Band and many other campus organizations. With all this going for them, it
is easy to see why they urge fellow students
to "Go Greek!"
The Greeks hold a visible position on the Pitt campus.
At football and basketball games, they support their
teams and proudly display their letters. Greek Week
festivities and social activity are both important parts
of the Greek life also.
The annual watermelon picnic,
sponsored by the Greeks, begins the
fall pledge season, long before any
thought to the spring Greek Week
Activities.

T his year, the fraternities and so    rorities of Pitt decided to help
20,000 Special Olympians of Pennsylvania in their athletic endeavors with
the funds raised during Greek Week.
While the week's itinerary was filled
with a lot of contests, dances and parties, it actually served as a united
Greek effort to raise money for the
chosen charities.
  The actual Greek Week events went
as followed: March 31 was the opening
ceremonies. Sunday, April 2 was the
Olympics. Monday was the water competition; Tuesday, the chariot race;
Wednesday, the mystery event; Thursday, the Greek God and Goddess competition; Friday, Greek Sing; and Saturday through Sunday, 24-hour dance
marathon. On April 14, there was an
all-Greek mixer. And, finally, on
April 15, there was a Greek formal at
the Westin William Penn downtown,
and it was a big success.
  "Greek Week is a time for Greeks to
pull together and work for a chosen
charity. It's (not only a time) to raise
money for the charity, but also for
Greeks to have fun and enjoy the
events," said Chairwoman Kristen
Puntureri.

his year's Greek Week officially
    began Friday night, March 31,
with the opening ceremonies and concluded April 14 with the Greek Week
formal. The goals were to raise money
for the Western Pennsylvania Special
Olympics and donation of blood to the
Central Blood Bank.
  The Greeks at Pitt are very proud of
their annual fundraising drive. "We
want to show everybody that we aren't
(just) here for social gatherings. We do
a lot of other things. In the past three
years, we've raised over $250,000 for
charities in the Pittsburgh area," said
Greek Week Chairman Ron Bizick.
  The opening ceremonies began with
a proclamation from Pittsburgh Mayor Sophie Masloff declaring the week
of March 31 to April 9 as Greek Week
in the city of Pittsburgh. The proclamation, which was read by Neloo
Georgetti, praised the sororities and
fraternities of Pitt for "their on-going
charitable community services." And
Pennyslvania Gov. Bob Casey also
sent a proclamation in which he
thanked the Pitt Greeks for "giving of
themselves to benefit their neighbors
and the public good."

milk, eggs, flour and whipped cream.
But don't worry, the Greeks at Pitt
haven't gone crazy. They were participating in the Greek Olympiad.
  Although many of the Greek Week
events strive to raise money for Special Olympics, enjoyment is the main
purpose of the Greek Olympiad. "This
event is a spirit booster to get people
excited about Greek Week. It's for
everyone to just get together and have
fun," said Greek Week Chairwoman
Kristen Puntureri. "We wanted to see
the Greeks come together, make some
friends, and just have a general good

  The cake relay marked the conclusion of the field events. In the relay,

participants raced to turn them into

Bigelow
       Blvd.
 Chariot
     Race
n ancient Greece, men of courage
   raced chariots through the Circus
 Maximus to test their will. In Oak land, Pitt's Greeks raced down
 Bigelow Boulevard in makeshift char iots to capture the annual Greek Week
 chariot-race championship.
 "Chariot-heads," announcer Steve
 Hansen of WMYG dubbed the crowd.
 "I tell you, they just follow us around
 everywhere, watching the chariot
 races from city to city, sleeping on the
 streets."
 Six chariots competed in the race.
 Each chariot represented a different
 Greek Week match group, which con sisted of six members from different
 Pitt fraternities and sororities. Par ticipants in the race-winning match
 group were fraternities Delta Tau Del ta and Sigma Alpha Mu, and sororities
 Delta Zeta and Sigma Delta Tau.
 The race involved two female mem bers of each group pushing the char iots down Bigelow until they circled a
 cone, where they passed the chariot to
 two of their male teammates. The
 chariots were then raced to the finish
 line, where times were recorded.
 Despite one collision at the finish
 line between racing teams in lane one
 and two, the event went very smooth ly. Pika brother, Ted Freed, of the
 damaged chariot, said that he wasn't
 scared when his chariot crashed.
 Everyone joked that his helmet did a
 lot of good.

they thought the speakers did an excellent job. "It wasn't as if they (the
audience) were being preached to or
talked down to," Jedlica said.
  Farinella agreed. "Few speakers can
captivate an audience, and these
speakers did that," he said.

In celebration of its 75th anniver  sary, Sigma Alpha Epsilon held a
huge banquet in March at the LeMont
restaurant at which over 100 active
members and alumni were present to
honor the fraternity. Included were
William Chapman, the eminent supreme warden of the fraternity, and
Jack Freeman, the executive vice president at Pitt. Freeman helped in getting the fraternity houses built up on
the hill away from the neighborhood
where they would be subject to vandalism.
dAccording to the current SAE president, Dave Vaxmonsky, the brotherhood of SAE is very diverse. "You
can't really place a label on our
house," he states. The fraternity had
the third highest QPA and the second
largest membership this year. SAE is
also involved in many community

their letters and wear them proudly,"
he claims. In addition, SAE is a respected fraternity nationwide,
Vaxmonsky said. "We set precedents
that are followed by other fraternities."
  SAE was originally founded March
9, 1856, at the University of Alabama
by Noble Leslie DeVotie as a social
fraternity. In 1913, Marvin E. Holderness started a chapter at the University of Pittsburgh.

Introduction

                                     A stone's throw from the urban drabness of Fifth Avenue and Forbes Street on
                                         the complacent greenness of the Cathedral lawn rests Pitt's diminutive Heinz
                                     Chapel. As the massive red oak doors of the chapel entrance close behind the
                                     visitor, he escapes from a world of busy noises and changing climates into the
                                     almost ethereal Gothic atmosphere of medieval France - an atmosphere of time
                                     - reversing calm, of lofty idealistic inspiration, of soaring serenity.
                                       The Heinz Chapel, dedicated Sunday, November 20, is a gift to the university
                                     from Henry John Heinz and his children. Originally Henry John Heinz willed a
                                     bequest to the university to erect a building in honor of his mother, Anna
                                     Margaretta Heinz. However, before this plan was carried through, his children,
                                     Howard Heinz, Irene E. Given, and Clifford S. Heinz, decided to
                                     add to the bequest and to build this chapel in memory of both
                                     their father and their grandmother.
                                       The Heinz Memorial Chapel now stands completed - a per                                    manent symbol of spiritual growth.
                                                             No longer is the building merely a nov                                                          elty or an item in the sight-seers guide
                                                          book; it has become a real chapel on the
                                                          university campus. It goes hand in hand
                                                          with all education on that campus, being a
                                                          vital part of that education. The student
                                                          and the teacher retire there after classes to
                                                          find rest, to absorb the beauty of the sur                                                          roundings inspired by soft organ music.

                                      So, now that you're thinking of the cathedral, concentrate for a moment on the Commons Room
                                    Tell the truth: didn't you always wonder why it is so dark in there? "Who can study under that Poor

T     he University of Pittsburgh will contribute approximately $100 million per year to
      its biotechnology research facility, scheduled to open in the spring of 1990, ac      cording to the center's new director, Jerome Schultz. "The university will make an
investment, and hopefully the university will benefit," Schulz said. According to Schultz,
the state of Pennsylvania has contributed $14 million for construction of the building
which will house the Center for Biotechnology and Bioengineering on the former site of
the Jones and Laughlin steel mill along the Monongahela River.
   In addressing Pitt's faculty assembly, Schultz expressed confidence that the center will
succeed despite a lack of similar ventures in the Pittsburgh area. "There is a unique
situation at the University of Pittsburgh between the health sciences and engineering.
                                          There's an awful lot of intellectual power
                                          here that can be tapped... and a lot of money
                                          in Pittsburgh that hasn't been focused here,"
                                          Schultz said.
                                            "These are some strons new fields. You
                                          might have asked Carnegie Mellon Univer                                          sity 20 years ago,'Why are you going into
                                          computers? IBM is already there,' " he con                                          tinued. Schultz said the center will have two
                                          major components: research and industrial
                                          marketing. "We hope to provide services for
                                          the whole university in health resources and
management, and this will be one of the few segments of the university that will be
proactive with industry," he explained.
   Schultz stated the 80,000 square foot building will hold biological, chemical, imaging
and computation laboratories and facilities for small animals needed for research. The
center will house 80 to 90 researchers and scientists at a time, including those involved in
joint projects with other university-supported institutions such as the Pittsburgh Cancer
Institute, the center for Hazardous Materials Research, and the Pittsburgh Supercornputing Center.

P itt's Student Health Service office of    fers AIDS awareness programs
 which not only educate students about
 the disease but is used as a tool to con vince them to change their lifestyles to
 include practicing safe sex.
 "The student body is now relatively
 well-informed on AIDS but most don't
 incorporate this knowledge in their be havior," said Kandy Miller, head nurse
 at SHS. According to Miller, many stu dents disregard the dangers of AIDS be cause they are young and cannot imagine
 themselves dying. "It's a major problem
 with people this age. They feel invin cible," Miller said.
 SHS, which began AIDS education
 over four years ago, teaches about the
 disease through certain academic
 courses. AIDS information is incorpo rated into classes through various
 schools of the university at the invitation
 of the professor or at the urging of stu dents, according to Jan DeVoe, nurse
 health educator at SHS.
 Information about AIDS is taught in
 relation to a specific course of study and
 is worked into the class by its instructor.
 "AIDS education in a business class, for
 example would inform on AIDS in the
workplace, and then we would talk about
the disease itself," Miller said.
  SHS also offers outreach programs

  The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency selected the
  University of Pittsburgh's Applied Research Center in
  Harmarville as the site for the National Environmental
  Technology Application Corporation. The purpose of this
new multi-million dollar effort is to accelerate the commercialization of priority environmental technologies that
are being developed by government and the private sector.
  According to Samuel A. Schulhof, associate vice president of applied research at Pitt and director of NETAC,
the project will attempt to identify environmental technologies being developed or already in existence and determine whether they are feasible for industry.
  Researchers will conduct a risk assessment of each particular technology to determine if that technology is ready
for the marketplace. Said Schulof, "There are a lot of good
technologies out there that aren't being used or developed."
  NETAC will provide a means through which a promising
form of environmental technology can be brought into the
regulatory process. It will be NETAC's job to bridge the
gap between the regulatory requirements of the EPA and
the needs of industry. Schulhof said he is confident that
NETAC will speed up the commercialization of important
forms of environmental technology.
  Pitt was selected for the $9 million cooperative agreewhich provide current information
about the disease to student groups such
as resident hall members, sororities and
fraternities. These lectures focus on issues which specifically relate to college
students such as the effect of alcohol on
making safe sex decisions. "The purpose
of the information is to affect the behavior of students," DeVoe said.
  Originally, AIDS lectures offered by
SHS required students to attend on their
own without group support. Few students attended these classes for fear of
raising the suspicions of peers concerning their interest in AIDS information,
according to Miller.

ment because of its reputation for effective cooperation
with local business and industry. Moreover, the state of
Pennsylvania is centrally located in the nation's northeast
industrial belt and is the fifth largest producer of hazardous waste.
  Finding solutions to the problems of environmental pollution is a major concern of area researchers. Funds for the
project will be matched by a variety of contributions from
public and private sector sources.
  NETAC is an outgrowth of the Federal Technology
Transfer Act of 1986, which Congress passed to encourage
the formation of new information sharing organizations
involving both the government and the private sector.
  The project comes at a time of expected high growth in
the environmental technology market. Last year, U.S. industry and government spent nearly $80 billion for pollution abatement, compliance and control, up 6 percent
from 1986. The cost of cleaning up the nation's hazardous
waste sites is estimated to be more than $200 billion over
the next 20 years.
  EPA Administrator Lee Thomas has praised Pitt and the
city of Pittsburgh, saying that both have "hands-on, can-do
people." He said that NETAC will "develop, create and
faci itate new technology... We can take the best of innovation and help commercialize it and get it into the
marketplace and into our communities."

A n eight-year idea of bringing
     Soviet television to University
of Pittsburgh classrooms culminated this year with a reception to dedicate Pitt's new satellite dish. The
dish, located on top of Forbes Quadrangle, will pick up the signal of the
Molniya Tracking system, which is
broadcast to over 88 million Soviet
homes. From the dish, the signal
can be transmitted to classrooms via
Pitt's "Campus of the Future" fiber
optic network. Funding for the
project came from Pennsylvania's
Ben Franklin Fund for Equipment.
  "The sophisticated tracking
equipment was actually more expensive than the dish itself," said
Oscar Swan, chairman of Pitt's
Slavic languages and literature department. The tracking system is
used to keep the dish in line with
the Soviet satellite, and ensures that
the system will still be usable with
plans to switch satellites sometime
next year.
  Even with the system running,
there are still hurdles to overcome,
according to Swan. One of these is a
problem with class scheduling.
There are only a few large lecture
rooms equipped to receive the signal,
while most of the classes that now incorporate Russian television into their
curriculum are smaller, more advanced Russian language courses.
  Another problem is that there is still
no way for individual students to view
the broadcasts on their own. Swan said
that he would like to set up a center for
viewing Russian television in the Slavic Languages Library on the 14th floor
of Cathedral of Learning, but the fiber
optic network doesn not reach that
high.
  The provost's office is making plans
to extend the network sometime in the
near future.
  Perhaps the biggest problem has to
do with the unpredictable nature of
Soviet television schedules, which
change on a day-to-day basis. No television guides are published in advance in the Soviet Union, where listings are published in the daily papers.
  Because of the difficulty in getting a
hold of Soviet newspapers, there is no
way to determine when specific programs will be aired, according to
Swan. He added that this is especially
frustrating when trying to videotape a
particular show.
  Despite these problems, the system is already a valuable tool, according to Swan. "It's important to
study language in its own context,"
said Swan. "But it is too expensive
to send anyone (to the Soviet Union). Russian television is technologically inferior to that in the
(United States), but there are more
'talking head programs. The emphasis is on discussion and debate.
There aren't very many sit-corns or
game shows. Their television is
much more valuable to us than ours
is to them."
  "It's an invaluable tool for learning about Soviet domestic and international affairs," said Ron Linden, director of Pitt's Center for
Russian and East European Studies.
"Pitt students will be offered a direct window on Soviet society at a
very exciting time in the Soviet Union. Imagine what it would have
been like having the dish during the
Armenian earthquake and the Summits. We'll have it for the forthcoming spring elections in the Soviet Union."

Provost vs.
U niversity of Pittsburgh Prov    ost Rudolph H. Weingartner
announced that he was stepping
down at the end of the winter term
because of a conflict with President
Wesley Posvar over the role of the
provost as a spokesman of the academic community and how centralized that power should be between the two offices.
  Weingartner, the provost since
August of 1987, said
that a disagreement
with the handling of
the budget was at the
heart of the problem.
  "Since everything
costs money and good
words alone don't accomplish all that
much," he said, "it is a
matter of my participation in the budget process that we are in disagreement about, but
we're in disagreement
about this because of a
disagreement about
the centrality of the academic enterprise."
  As provost, Weingartner is the chief academic officer. Posvar
charges that Weingartner tried to overstep his bounds, and
Posvar's refusal to accept this led to the resignation. "He wanted
me to give up the authority of the president," Posvar said.
"He openly, frankly
and in a positive way asserted that
he wanted me to deputize the authority to run the university to
him."
  Posvar added that Weingartner
"had whatever role he wished to
have in the budget at any and all
times."
  In a statement released at the
   Posvar
time of the resignation announcement, Posvar alleged that Weingartner "repeatedly asked for extensions of his own jurisdiction and in
various sectors; he also insisted on a
further and formal delegation and
sharing of authority vested in the president..."
  In the statement, however, Posvar
said that Weingartner had full authority over a budget of $80 million.
  Posvar said, "he made an ultimatum
which I think he knew was unacceptable," adding that the two parted amicably, as friends.
  Weingartner will be taking a oneyear leave and will return to Pitt as a
professor of philosophy. When asked
to comment on Weingartner's performance, Posvar said, "I would say he
was, in terms of his exercise of authority versus openness, in the middle of the road. He invited some
participation, but I think to some
extent he was also not as available
to his deans as some would have
liked, but I'd say that's middle of
the road."
  Donald Henderson, the present
vice provost, will replace Weingartner in May. Weingartner be            lieves that Henderson
            may encounter the
            same troubles with
            centralizing the posi            tion.
            Henderson said,
            however, that the sit            uation between Wein            gartner and Posvar
            was just that, and
            "what transpires in the
            future will be a result
            of the president and I
            coming to a meeting of
    4       the minds."
             Weingartner said
           that while he was prov           ost he had hoped to
           "make serious contri           butions toward the

           teaching undergradu           ates and graduates,
           and to do better in re           search."
             Henderson came to
           the university as an as           sociate provost in
           1970. He has attended
           Kent State and Pitt,
           where he received his
doctorate.
  "He's a tremendous person, a
very strong person intellectually
and morally - a man of courage,"
Posvar said.

236 Leuba Library
A private library valued at $532,000 was willed to the University of Pittsburgh
    libraries by the late Mrs. Martha Leuba. The library contains 20th century fine
press books, woodblock prints, autographed letters and many first editions. It is one
of the most valuable private library collections to be donated to the university since
the Darlington Memorial Library bequest of 1919-1922.
  Originally established by Walter Leuba to be a reading library,
the collection contains many works of interest to the Leubas.
Included are extensive exhibits of books by and about Thomas
Carlyle, John Keats, Ezra Pound, Jonathon Swift, George Santyana, George Saintsbury, Norman Douglass, T. S. Eliot, Louise
Imogen Guiney, Fredrick Clap and others. He ordered many of
these works from catalogs sent to him by dealers in New York
and England.
  Also housed in the library are the drafts and final manuscripts of many of
Leuba's own writings. During his lifetime, Leuba authored or co-authored 10 books.
  More than 50 of collection's autographed letters bear the signatures of writers
such as Rudyard Kipling, Charles Dickens, George Eliot, Sigmund Freud, Thomas
Hardy, Victor Hugo, Sir Walter Scott, James Russell Lowell and William Butler
Yeats.
  Due to its increasing value, the main part of the Leuba Library will be housed in
the Walter and Martha Leuba Collection, established in 1976, in Pitt's Hillman Library

                         Martha Leuba died in February of 1988, and Walter

238 Women's Studies
n 1969, only one college in the Unit  ed States offered a program   of
courses concerning women and related issues. Now there are over 500 similar programs, 26 of which offer doctorates.
  Since its inception in 1972, the
Women's Studies Program at the University of Pittsburgh has grown from
five course offerings and three core
faculty members to nearly 80 courses
taught by over 50 professors from different departments throughout the
university.
  "It's really an exploding area in academics," said Carol McAllister, interim director of the program. The
course offerings of Pitt's WSP range
from history and literature courses to
anthropology and physical education
classes.
  Students can complete an undergraduate certificate or a graduate minor in the program. Many students
also participate in women's study
courses which are cross-listed with
other departments to satisfy general
education or elective requirements.
Approximately 30 students are currently pursuing the program certificate, McAllister said.
In addition to teaching, WSP has
three other functions. McAllister said
the most important is sponsoring programs related to gender, race and nationality issues. And WSP works to

4"     he faculty selects books," said Barbara
    I  Simonoff, textbook buyer for the University
Book Center. "We order the books for the classes." It
sounds simple, but the buying and selling of textbooks at
the book center is actually quite a job.
  The center is a self-sufficient operation. They pay rent
to Pitt and pay their own employees. While trying to sell
textbooks at the lowest possible price, the center must
also avoid losing money.
  The book center first receives book requisition forms
from faculty with the author, title and publisher of the
books needed for their classes, along with an estimate of
how many people will be in each class. They then buy the
books from the publisher.
  The price that the student pays for each textbook
depends mostly on the publisher. The center puts a 1025 percent mark-up on the cost of buying the book from
the publisher. Some publishers give discounts to the
center, which allows the center to sell those textbooks at
close to the regular price.
  The biggest problem concerning textbooks is leftover
books. "Every book that you see down here (in the book
store) has money invested in it," said Simonoff. This
bring speakers, seminars and workshops to the university.
  WSP faculty also engages in re  search in their respective fields. WSP
  sponsors the Research Associate Pro  gram to enable researchers who are
completing work in women's studies
or related fields to use university facilities such as computers and library
materials to complete their projects.
  McAllister said WSP is also interested in improving the status of women as a whole in the university and the
community. A WSP task force has reported to Provost Rudolph Weingartner a plan "to integrate gender,
race and nationality into the university curriculum as a whole."

Book Center
includes books not bought by students. These books
must be sent back to the publisher. It costs up to four
percent of the cost of all the books to ship them back, and
many publishers charge a fee for returned books.
   One of the ways the book center tries to cut cost for
 themselves and the students is through used books.
 Books that are going to be used again the next school
 year are bought back at half the original price. These
 books are then sold at a 25 percent discount from the
 price of the new books. The students get the discount
 and the money made is reinvested into new books and
 into maintaining the book store.
   Problems arise when the faculty is unsure of whether
 a particular book will be used for next year's classes.
 Often, when students are selling their books, the book
 center hasn't been informed of the status of many text books. Then they can't afford to offer the 50 percent
 price. Simonoff said she "got burned" when she bought
 used books and then found out they were no longer
 going to be used.

    ou enter a classroom the first day of the term, take a seat beside an older gentleman or
        lady and they politely smile and ask, "Is this the Presidential Rhetoric class?" As the
        term goes on, you gradually become friends - sharing notes, questions about the
 lectures, even why you missed class on Friday. Then, dreaded mid-term time
 rolls around and your little friend relaxes, casually taking notes, while you
 plan your exit from planet earth. Exam day comes and you feel the strange
 empty seat beside you - "Hey, where is he?" - and realize you're in this
 one alone.
   Who are these people coming into the classroom? These special in dividuals are retired physicians, professors, business professionals and
 homemakers with special qualities that motivate them to trod the hills of
 Oakland each day. The wisdom in being wise to a good thing, they
 capture the ultimate dream of every student, young and old - the
 class with no exam and no paper due. Knowledgeable people, they've
 been there, they've experienced what the students around them are
 preparing for and can only record in a notebook for now.
   The curious and comforting eyes of an elderly person transforms
 the 1980's college classroom into a "silver mine." The university
 discovered this treasure in 1974, looking for community involve ment projects, not knowing then what a profitable investment
 they made for the Pitt campus public relations and benefit to the
 Pittsburgh elderly community.
   The College of General Studies "Over Sixty's Program"
 offers interested 55 years and older persons the opportunity to
 audit about 175 classes, with no credit, from a course list
 provided by cgs, and other classes not listed with instructor
 approval. A $10 fee reserves a seat in available class space.
   The popularity of the program, with an enrollment of 60
 students in 1974, blossomed to 400 participating students for the
 88-89 school year, with little publicity by CGS. According to the
 admissions director, Jan White, the demand grows with the word
 passing among friends and relatives who enjoy the experience.
   Understandably, the appeal offers the retired person the stimulating
atmosphere of the college environment, a chance to learn a new language or
study events they lived through and often participated in with a current
perspective. They like school and enjoy having an academic edge in life and most
important, understand what keeps them alive - change, and what a better place
than a university campus.

                                Helena Hella, Over-Sixty's student in Presidential Rhetoric,
                             one of the most popular class choices, finds the students

  Professors enjoy the responses and admire the dedication of these energizing mature students. In
this election year, Over-Sixty's students filled their quota of 50 seats for Ted Windt's Presidential
Rhetoric class. Lectures on the campaign debates and the presidential election were complemented with
comparisons to past political campaigns by the Over-Sixty's group.
  Nathan Davis' Jazz 084, political science courses and fine art classes draw popular attention in the
program along with the special events like the weekend devoted to the Kennedy assassination and the
university trip to Fallingwater.
  The undergraduates respond to having
elderly classmates with, "Hey, they're fine,"
and they are fine because these people are
the ones who make life happen, for themselves and for the people whose lives they
touch.
  The University of Pittsburgh, recognized
as a uniquely diverse campus academically
and culturally, blends a new dimension for
the 90's - a quality touch of life and the
flavor of superior wisdom. The Over-Sixty's
College blends to a perfect fit, to the Cathedral's theme and a campus moving to the future.
  With a dedication and courage, these students stand for the learning process itself - the very reason why
the rest of us are "in this one alone" on exam day.

D orm life. Exams. Deadlines. All of these are examples of situations that
     can lead to stress. But how can a student deal with them? Help is
available in the area of stress management. According to Nadine Snyder, a

                                     Pitt students have another option
                                   open to them on campus for stress
management. Bonnie Sullivan, a stress management instructor, stated, "Here
at Pitt, we offer a regular stress management program through the Student
Health Service. It is a voluntary, four-week group session for an hour per
week. The student becomes aware of what stress is and how to handle it."
  Sullivan explained, "The program involves a regular progression of skills.
For example, we start with deep breathing."
242 Stress
The times... They're a-changin'...
T he college class of 1993: They're start     ing to smoke more. They may be losing
interest in business careers. And they overwhelmingly favor mandatory AIDS and drug
testing. These were some of the findings in
the 23rd annual survey of incoming freshmen
by the American Council on Education and
the Higher Education Research Institute at
the University of California at Los Angeles.
  The wide-ranging survey also found that
entering college freshmen are getting less aid
from the federal government and are increasingly interested in college as a means to land
a high-paying job.
  And the proportion of freshmen who identified their political views as conservative or
far right was a record 21.8 percent. But large
majorities of students took traditionally liberal positions when asked about specific issues ranging from pollution and disarmament to abortion and consumer protection.
"It's because of the beating of the word
'liberal' has taken," said Kenneth C. Green of UCLA, associate director of the survey. "A
lot of them think liberal means
impotent."
  On the other hand, the survey found students becoming
increasingly conservative on
matters related to crime and
the death penalty. And twothirds of incoming 1988 freshmen agreed that
"the best way to control AIDS is through
widespread, mandatory testing," while 71
percent agreed that "employers should be allowed to require drug testing of employees or
job applicants."
  The findings are based on questionnaires
filled out by 308,007 freshmen entering 585
two and four-year colleges and universities.
The results were adjusted to reflect the total
population of 1.64 million first-time, fulltime entering students, and have a margin of
error of plus or minus 2 percent.
  One of the most dramatic findings was a
rise in the number of students who said they
were frequent smokers, reversing a 22-year
decline. In 1966, 16.6 percent of the freshmen
said they were frequent smokers. That fell
steadily to 8.9 percent in 1987, but rose to
10.1 percent among those entering college
nelp to relieve stress."
  The program also involves time management and decision making skills. "It
deals with the physical and mental aspects of stress," she
added. "It's a comprehensive course."
  Snyder noted, "By looking at your lifestyle and deciding how much time you need and finding ways to
manage your time, you can relieve stress."
  She said, "Often the cafeteria food is not the most
last fall. In addition, a record high percentage of freshmen (10.5 percent) said
they frequently felt depressed, while a declining proportion rated their emotional
health as above average (56.1 percent, as
opposed to 56.8 percent in 1987).
  Survey director Alexander Astin, also of
UCLA, said the three findings indicate increased stress on the students. He said the
survey also revealed potential sources of
that stress: concern about paying for college, increased interest in advanced degrees and tougher competition for admission to selective institutions.
  A record proportion of freshmen said
they were interested in pursuing advanced
degrees - 58.7 percent, compared to 48.3
percent in 1980. And a record 72.6 percent
indicated "making more money" was a
very important factor in their decision to
attend college. On the career front, the
survey found that freshman interest in en             tering the business world
             declined from 24.6 percent
             in 1987 to 23.6 percent in
             1988 after two decades of
             steady gains. The results
             "suggest that student inter             est in business careers may
             have reached a plateau after
             the dramatic increases of the
             1970's and 1980's," survey
officials said.
  The survey also found that federal financial aid programs for college had eroded. For example, only 15.6 percent of
freshmen entering school last fall received
Pell grants, the government's major aid
program for low and middle income students. That was the lowest level since the
survey began and less than half the 31.5
percent who received Pell grants in 1980.
Students reported greater reliance on family contributions, savings, loans and college-sponsored grants - with the last rising from 12.8 percent in 1980 to 20 percent
in 1988.

willing to work at the stress management program," said
Snyder. Sullivan stated, "It's sometimes difficult to measure the successfulness of our program. However, because it is voluntary and students return week after

joyed "at the Ukrainian effort to raise funds for the new room. The Ukrainians
don't have an angel, or large sum contributor, and (have) to raise the estimated
$250,000 project cost through bake sales and radiothons."
  Until 1975, university policy specified that only officially recognized coun.
tries, not ethnic groups, could be represented by a room in the cathedral. Since
the policy was changed, there have been two other Soviet republic ethnic
groups, the Lithuanians and the Armenians, who have erected rooms.

have been irate for centuries when identified as Russians. Ukrainians are
distinctly different in language and culture from the other 18 Soviet republics."

expression of our love and sacrifice for the culture and history of Ukrainia, and
of our wish to pass on this love to future generations."

Struggles for
or graduate foreign students at Pitt,
     studying abroad can be more than an
     extended vacation. Pressures to adjust financially, academically and socially
can make their experiences less than easy.
  "Foreign students are confronted with
many challenges from the start," said Geoffrey Wood, director of the Office of
International Student Services. "Not only
do they have to acclimate themselves to
the environment and blend in with the
culture of the people, but they have to
master their studies as well."
  "The hardest part about being a foreign
student is the financial part," said Xiaolin
Xing, a graduate student of economics.
"The very reason why I chose to come to
Pitt is because I got a government scholarship for my first year and a fellowship."
  "I was considering other schools in Japan, China, Western Europe, Canada and
Australia. But even though (American
schools) are more expensive, they offer a
greater chance for financial support."
  "One reason why many foreign students would like to study in the United
States more than in other countries is because the United States is more flexible
and offers much (more) assistance," said
Emeka Meke, a doctoral student in vocational and technical education.
  "Another reason is that America offers
many technical programs," said Meke.
"Third World countries are especially interested in technical programs, and America is doing more vocational programs
now than other places are."
  "The chances of gaining admissions
and scholarships are also greater than
Help for fore
I n a cultural center such as the University
   of Pittsburgh, foreign names and faces
   are commonplace in front of the classroom. Often comes the difficulty of deciphering the lecture through a thick foreign
accent.
  "I needed help with a computer program
last term," said Stephen McGanty, a mechanical engineering student, "and when I went
to the T.A., his accent was so thick that I
couldn't understand his explanation."
  Not understanding a foreign T.A. is a
frustrating situation encountered by many
Pitt students, but there is a program available that works to alleviate the problem.
Pitt's English Language Institute requires all
foreign T.A.s in the College of Arts and
Sciences and business and engineering departments to be tested for English speaking
and comprehensive skills.
  Poor performance on the test will result in
the T.A. being placed in a three-credit course
to help improve his command of the English
language. While enrolled in this class, the
T.A.s are assigned non-teaching assignments
such as grading.
  Instructor Joe Sukenik teaches a class on
pronunciation skills and includes idioms
that the T.A.s may run into, such as "to blow
off a class," "to ace an exam" or "to flunk
out."
foreign studei
anywhere else. And because America is so
flexible, you can get jobs while schooling to
help pay for your education," Meke said.
   "One of the biggest misconceptions about
 foreign students," said Wood, "is that they
 are all sponsored by their or our government.
 Traditionally, one-third of our foreign stu dents have been self-paying, another third
 are sponsored by outside agencies and the
 final third are supported by Pitt through
 T.A.ships and graduate student research."
   "Before going overseas, students must
 demonstrate that they have enough money to
 support themselves and to pay their school
 fees for the first year of school," said Meke.
 "After that year, the family usually continues
 to sponsor the student until they can get
 assistance."
   Academic adjustments can be both trying
 and pleasant for foreign students. "In Third
 World cultures," said Meke, "we deal with
 subjective test questions in school. Here, in
 the United States, learning is mostly objec tive. And it's often difficult for students to
 adjust to this."
   "I am really enjoying studying here. It's
 very easy with the use of computers, and the
 libraries have many books, all quite easy to
 reference," noted Xing.
   "Professors here are more open and ac cessible than in any other part of the world,
 which is superb because it helps make the
 learning process easier," observed Meke. "In
 Nigeria, going to see the professor is like
 going to see God."
   "If I wanted to see my professor," said Aas
 Shofyani, "in our culture, it would be im polite to call him on the phone. But, here, it is
 common."
ign T.A.s
  According to Marie Eichler of the department
of linguistics, this course helps the foreign
T.A.s "understand the cultural differences in
America as well as improve their speaking
skills."
  Undergraduates are invited to attend this
class so the T.A.s can see what American students are really like. They are involved in roleplaying to simulate classroom situations.
Eichler said, "It should be fun. It's like impromptu acting." There are situations involving
a student asking for more time on a project or
for a grade change. Eichler adds that the students also get the chance to be disruptive. "We
have people singing, talking, telling jokes, jingling their keys to see how the T.A.s deal with
problems like these."
  If any students are interested in participating
in the class, they can contact the linguistics
department.
  After the T.A.s complete the class, they are
evaluated again. If they still have some difficulty speaking they can receive tutoring from
the department.
  The T.A.s who pass the class, as well as those
who received intermediate scores on the initial
test, are permitted to teach. However, they are
required to attend four non-credit tutoring sessions. The tutor may videotape presentations
from a T.A. and may visit the classroom to
check on the progress made.
   Social adjustments for foreign students
can also vary, ranging from acclimatizing
to the weather to organizing recreational
events for weekends and holidays.
   "Many things surprised me when I first
came here to do my master's degree," said
Shofyani. "There were no forests, just
buildings everywhere. And in Indonesia,
there is no spring, no fall or winter. Day
after day is summer."
   "Social outlets are not so clear for foreign students," said Meke. "Our families
are paying for us to go to school here, and
they're all depending on us to learn as
much as we can so we can go back and help
our governments. We have to use a lot of
self-discipline to know when to go and see
films and attend parties and when we have
to be in the library studying."
   "To help foreign students adjust to
their environment more smoothly, we
conduct a week-long orientation session at
the end of August, another shorter one in
January and a final one in the spring,"
said Linda Gentile, and adviser for foreign students and scholars.
   "In these sessions, we feature everything from immigration matters, registration procedures, health service fees, to the
learning skills program available and
classroom behavior."
   "We also want to make their social adjustment better," said Gentile. "So we
schedule social affairs like a Gateway
Clipper cruise, a tour of the city, or if the
Pirates are in town, a baseball game during orientation."

The Pitt News
  Also helpful in spotting problems with
foreign T.A.s are the surveys passed out each
term by the Office for the Evaluation of
Teaching.
  These surveys are given to each student in
an undergraduate class, with two extra questions concerning speaking and comprehension skills for foreign T.A.s. This calls attention to deficiencies that may have been
previously missed.
  The input of the undergrads is very important. Though students complain, most
recognize when their T.A.s have improved.
Sophomore Robyn Smigel said, "I had a Chinese T.A. who taught my English class last
year. It was awkward at first, but as the year
went on, she got better."
  This is the goal of the English Language
Institute: to improve the T.A.'s speaking and
teaching skills. It is a difficult job, but each
department also helps. Eichler recommends
that anyone experiencing difficulty with a
T.A. can contact the department offering the
class. Most departments have a faculty member in charge of the T.A.s who will help with
the problem.

Introduction 21

I
T here is no such thing as the "typical"
     Pitt senior. Each graduate of the Uni versity of Pittsburgh is a unique and in dividual person. The one factor that bonds
 them together is the quality of their re spective degrees.
   Pitt students have demonstrated their de sire for achievement and their commitment
 to excellence. Each graduating class is a
 fruition of these qualities.
   Upon commencement, students have
worked hard for a significant portion of
their lives in pursuit of the knowledge
which will ultimately lead to a diploma.
Graduation signifies the end of this effort.
Their work, along with that of their instructors and administrators, has paid off
in the form of a tangible indication of success.
  However, graduation does not signify the
end of the cycle of education for the Pitt
senior. Whether entering the work field or
pursuing graduate degrees, their education
will continue for the rest of their lives.
Graduation, which was held at the Civic Arena, is a celebration not only for the students,
but for the entire faculty and administration.
The commencement exercises are a celebration of commitment, dedication and persistence and patience on the part of all involved.

he University of Pittsburgh is
comprised of a number of diverse
individuals. Residents and commut-

well as it’s surrounding community,
consists of many unique people,
places, and events.

Bars like Zelda’s, C_]’s, and Calico’s
give students a chance to relax and
unwind. Hemingway’s, Simply

offer quality dining for students. The
Carnegie and the Pittsburgh Play-

COMMU ERS AN][]
     RESIDEN T ma
AF/
I
E    very year, Pitt students must face the
    problem of where to live. Residence
 halls, apartment or commuting - these are
 the options for living arrangements that
 each student chooses from. And there are a
 number of pros and cons that go along with
 each choice.
   The residence halls are certainly most
convenient. Residents have the easiest access to university resources such as the
Hillman Library, laundry facilities and the
cafeterias. But residents must also deal with
crowded elevators, signing in visitors, and
thirty "next door" neighbors.
  A commuter's life consists of dodging
meter-maids, crowded buses and hanging
out in the Commons Room between classes.
But, then again, commuters benefit from
being able to go home at the end of a day
and home cooked meals.
  Apartment dwellers can have the comforts of home and the convenience of living
nearby. However, landlord problems and
unwanted creatures can invade the lives of
those that opt to live in apartments.
  But to each his own. Each Pitt student
chooses the living condition that is best for
them -   and adds to it their own unique
splash of color.
Other Page: To avoid the blandness of the residence
halls, students find their own ways to make them
exciting and personal. This Page: Laundry lines can be
a problem, but students seem to manage; sharing a
bathroom with other residents can always be interesting.

Apartment
perils
at Pitt
I have always been one to try to
  exert my independence. I like to
do things for myself. So when I
came to Pitt, 3 years ago, moving
into my own apartment seemed to
be the logical first venture into a
life on my own.
  But little did I know that the road
to independence had been paved
with so many potholes. Allow me to
explain.
  My first apartment experience
was, in short, a nightmare. Now
needless to say, I didn't realize that
it would be so when I moved in, or I
would have stayed at home. But it
turned out to be a veritable plethora
of disasters. When my roommate
and I first moved in, our landlord
(whose name journalistic ethics prohibits me from printing) promised
us a remodeled apartment.
"Remodeled," I soon found out,
meant that we would at least have
new carpeting. And that was about
it. When we moved in in September,
the bathroom was being worked on.
When we moved out (the following
August) the bathroom still had no
ceiling and no door. At this point, I
would like to stop and ask you to
imagine for a moment the numerous compromising positions that
could and did occur due to this inconvenience.
  Anyway, that was the least of our
problems. We soon discovered several uninvited creatures that had inhabited our home. Now I've seen
roaches before. Almost everyone
has. But not like these. Our roaches
were big, mean, NASTY roaches.
They came in herds. And they came
to stay. Each day, I was forced to
confront them. I would tiptoe into
my apartment, with one shoe in
hand, flick on the lights, and smash
as many of the beasts that I could
catch. It was sort of a game.
  We also had a mouse. His name
was Pete.
  Now right around the time when
I didn't think this place could get
any worse, it inevitably did. We
were robbed. The first time
(implying that there was a second
time) was the worst. I returned to
my apartment to find furniture
overturned, clothes everywhere,
dresser drawers emptied. I couldn't
believe it. Not much was taken, but
that's hardly the point. The point is,
my privacy had been violently invaded.
  The road to independence was becoming more and more twisted.
  The next year, I moved into a
lovely house with three other women. It was big and spacious, with its
4 bedrooms, laundry facilities,
backyard, front porch, etc. And best
of all, it had a built in security system. However, it was not without its
problems. First of all, with four
women and one shower, mornings
were exceptionally difficult. But
nothing that a little patience could
not resolve. It wasn't until the summer came, when we discovered the
worst part of living in that house.
This place could retain heat better
than a styrofoam cup. It was a microwave. Positively unbearable.
And, I'm     sorry, but airconditioning is not a luxury that
this college student could afford.
  So I moved again. This time to a
cute 2 bedroom. Actually, it wasn't
too bad. I mean, of course, it had its
problems. The bathroom was the
size of a very small closet, it was
very expensive, and our landlady
spoke close to no English. But by
this time I had become accustomed
to these little inconveniences.
  Well, I'm a senior now, and once
again, I'm moving. But by now, in
my old age, and with my infinite
wisdom, I'm actually starting to understand this apartment thing. I
mean, at least I know what to look
for. A big apartment, a safe neighborhood, a landlord with whom I
can converse with ease. You know
what I mean - the little things that
make apartment life a little easier.
  Finally, the road to independence
is getting a little smoother. But then
again, its a new year, a new apartment. Who knows what treachery is
yet to come.

Cafeteria
Committee
handles
complaints
f you've ever eaten in the Towers'
  Cafeteria, you have probably no  ticed how people look oddly at their
  plates, push around the food a little,
  maybe even sniff it, and then push
  the plate away. Then it begins; complaints, complaints and more COMPLAINTS! But these people are the
late starters. Some people complain
while waiting in line before they've
even seen the food.
  Does this sound familiar? Or perhaps, you are guilty of these actions.
Well, what do you do about it? Do
you just sit back and have a negative
attitude or do you go to the Food
Committee meetings to voice your
opinions? "What is the Food committee?" you might ask? The Food
Committee is a group made up of
the cafeteria manager, dormitory
representatives and motivated students, who meet once a month to
discuss improvements in the cafeteria. If a student can not attend
these meetings he may talk to one of
the managers, Peter Rix, George
Johnson, or Al Barthen, personally.
The office is located on the right
side of the hallway leading to the
Tower C cafeteria. Residents may
speak to their dorm representatives
who will relay their problems and
suggestions at the meetings. The
management can not read minds
across the cafeteria, but they will
listen to and respond to suggestions.
  People requested something other than soda to drink. There are
now machines with HI-C, lemonade
and fresh spring water. Lisa Coe
had a complaint about the salad bar
not having enough vegetables.
About a week after she attended the
Food Committee meeting, Lisa was
happy to see there were more fresh
veggies added. Plain scrambled
eggs get kind of boring, so at the
meeting it was suggested that cheese
be put out for breakfast. Chip containers have been added also. There
are now approximately 4 to 6 different chips to accompany your
meal. One would be surprised how
little extras can make a meal taste so
much better. But the management
cannot think of everything.
  That is where the students come
in. They are the ones who eat in the
cafeteria and know what needs improvement. Or maybe a student has
a favorite meal that he'd like to have
served in the cafeteria. New menu
ideas are always welcome with the
food committee.
  So if something irks you about the
cafeteria or the food, don't just be
apathetic. If there is an idea on how
to improve the cafeteria, share it.
The Food Committee may be able to
help.

Commuting
is
chaos
for
students
Most of us have heard the sta     tistics - Pitt is a predominately commuter school. On any given
day approximately 70% of us are
driving, biking, walking, and, in m.y
case busing to Oakland. And it is
busing, in my opinion, which is the
ultimate test of commuters.
  Many of us bus from our homes
into downtown Pittsburgh and then
take any 61 or 71 bus to Pitt. Commuters and resident students alike
have favorite stories of riding an
Oakland-bound bus, fondly known
to some as the Bus from Hell. Generally, these rides amount to fending off people with, uh, poor personal hygiene, who want to forge a
relationship with you. Last term, a
man sat next to me and announced
that his former girlfriend was
"Nona, the harlot of Babylon;" he
seemed affronted when I wasn't interested in being her successor.
  Although those living on-campus
sometimes foray into the exciting
world of bus transportation, they
lack the day-in/day-out experience
of commuting, and the resulting
vertigo from gas fumes and bad
shock absorbers that are the hallmarks of a hard core buser. Depending on where you live and what time
you leave your home, getting to Pitt
can take up to two hours. For example, my apartment is in Mt. Lebanon. To be at a 9 a.m. class, I can
take a 7:00 bus to town. Allowing at
least an hour for rush hour traffic.
Then I wait around for a bus to
Oakland, which at that time of the
morning is always crowded and
takes a good half-hour. Usually, I
can make it to class with about 8
minutes to spare. Those of us in the
South Hills also have the option of
taking the T Train to town, which
in my case involves busing to the
trolley station, then getting on the
T, and then taking a bus to Oakland.
At that point you're already tired
and the day hasn't even begun.
  That amounts to a lot of time
spent on Neoplan's finest and, let's
face it, what can you do on a bus?
Study (sounds a lot better in theory
than in practice), sleep (someone
usually ends up using you for an
armrest or worse), or gaze blankly
out of the window and fantasize
(usually wins hands down). Plus the
first two options aren't available
when you have to stand all of the
way.
  This has been a litany of complaints thus far, but there is actually
something good about commuting
from the South Hills. It's the 44U
Bus that runs directly from Mt. Lebanon to Oakland, and the 44U bus
gang. We are a group of five men
and women, ranging in age from 24
to 34. Some of us have children,
some are single. We always occupy
the back seat of the bus. On occasion, a stranger will innocently
occupy line of "our" seats. When
this happens we are totally disoriented and so are the other passengers. Regular riders on the bus
have become accustomed to seeing
our group so that if we are forced to
relocate due to one of the hapless
intruders, other people comment on
our temporary seating arrangements.
  Occasionally, when bored, we
come up with suggestions for the
Port Authority, such as: sell coffee
to commuters, charge half-price for
those who must stand on the bus,
utilize the poster/advertisement
space for dating notices and personal ads, and pipe in music and
play musical chairs to rotate seaters
and standers. Something tells me
these ideas, if submitted, wouldn't
win us a Chairman's Pass. But, oh
well, such is the life of a commuter.

Towers'
Trials and
Tribulations
How often do you walk into a
     building with twenty-two
floors, but the elevator only stops
on every third floor? Would you
want to live where you have to sign
visitors in and out continuously?
How about sharing the same bathroom with forty other people?
These are only a few of the many
"joys" of living on campus at the
University of Pittsburgh.
  Currently, Pitt houses 4200 students each semester in ten dormitories. Each dorm offers advantages
and disadvantages in attempts to
suit the student's needs.
  Anyone who has either lived in B
dorm or stayed on campus has probably shared similar bizarre experiences. At Pitt, this includes roommate problems, communal
bathrooms, and the living area itself, along with the noise that forty
people on one floor can create.
  The University tries their best to
match people with similar interests
in the same room. Unfortunately,
all they have to base their decisions
on is a questionnaire. This is often
filled out by the student's parents.
Imagine walking into a room, sometimes comparable to the size of a
     Matt uarson pnoto
walk-in-closet, and seeing your exact opposite sitting on the other
side. Not only would you normally
not talk to this person, but you are
told that this is your roommate.
Roommate can be a scary word in
such situations. Thinking positively, you might be assigned someone
who will become your best friend.
But, there is a fifty-fifty chance and
eight months of a school year can
seem like an eternity when you are
in an unhappy home.
  The majority of students, before
living in a dorm, come from either a
home or an apartment with an average number of bathrooms per
person. Would you consider one
bathroom for forty people to be a
comfortable situation? The normal
person does not enjoy having a
restroom as their only bathroom.
But the resident is not offered any
alternatives. In addition, five showers and forty people is not a good
ratio for having hot water in the
morning.
  Studying in the dorms? No. This
is one of the biggest myths that
dorm life has to offer. It is your
room, you have paid good money to
live there and you should be able to
study there if you so choose. It is
easier to study in the middle of a
construction site than to study in
the dorms. Sleeping can also become an optional activity. People
scream in hallways, listen to music,
talk on the phone - there is no
privacy.
  With all of these wonderful experiences to endure each day, why
would anyone live on campus?
  Convenience is one reason. How
much closer to your classrooms
could you possibly hope to be? All
of the disadvantages of commuting,
such as parking, what to do between
classes, are non-existent.
  Meeting people is also very easy
in the dorms. Elevators, cafeterias,
lobbies, laundry rooms and even
bathrooms are crowded with familiar faces. The friendships which are
formed in the dormitories can not
be replaced. You truly grow to
know and love these people. You
will eat, study, fight and laugh together. Unfortunately, you will
never know again the intense
friendships as when you live in the
dorms.

Searching for
edibles
in Oakland
As an apartment dweller, I have
many concerns which plague me on
a daily basis. Laundry, bills, my crazy
landlady - you know what I mean.
   But everyday, there is one concern
 that every student must face, whether
 resident or commuter. And that is
 FOOD. Where does one eat here at the
 University?
   The two big meals of concern for me
are lunch and dinner. I'm not a breakfast person for two reasons. Number
one, I don't believe in getting out of bed
before 10:00 am, and two, ifI am up at
that hour for some ghastly reason, I
think food would sort of repulse me.
   So anyway, over the course of the day,
as I rush around campus, I have a tendency to develop somewhat of a serious
hunger. Now of course there are many
options for dealing with this pang in my
stomach. For one thing, I could beg for
a weekly care package from home. Or I
could grab a Snickers, as the commercials suggest, but my hips could not handle this on a daily basis.
  Then there is the cafeteria. Now I'm
not going to go into a long dissertation
about what the food tastes like, but let's
put it this way. I will not pay hundreds
of dollars for a meal plan, in order to
consume something which is occasionally unidentifiable. And there is something about the "ambiance" of the Towers' cafeteria that does not entice me to
eat. Enough said. But I suppose for
some, especially the Freshman residents who must purchase a meal plan,
the cafeteria is pretty much the only
choice. And to those people, I offer my
condolences, and a few helpful hints.
  There are plenty of establishments
throughout Oakland and Shadyside,
where tasty edibles can be located.
Hemingway's, C.J. Barney's and the
Balcony to name a few. But if that is too
much of a strain on the collegiate budget, there is fast food at every turn.
Wendy's, Rax, McDonalds, Roy's - all
within 2 blocks of each other. Why,
Forbes Avenue is a fast food lovers
dream.
   And then there is pizza. Everywhere.
 Little Italy's Ardolinos, Larry &amp; Carol's
 are all here to serve the hungry Pitt
 student.
   Now I must mention the landmark
 eating establishment, The Original. I
 have never exactly understood the mag netism that the "O" seems to have over
 Pitt students. But no matter what time,
 or what day, there will always be some one in the "O," grabbing hot dogs,
 burgers, or the infamous "O fries." The
 "O' also serves pizza. Now I have had
 many debates over the quality of this
 dish. Personally, I'm not into it at all.
 But my friend Tom could live on it.
 Many a time I've watched Tom stroll up
 to the counter, order this creation
 which he loves so much, salivate in an ticipation, and then consume the whole
 thing. It's unbelievable. I mean the fact
 that he can eat an entire pizza, from the
 "O" at that, is more than I can fathom.
 To each his own, I suppose.
 Now I must tell you about my very
 favorite eating establishment. Pamela's
 Country Kitchen on Forbes Ave. is the
 absolute greatest. As I have already
 mentioned, I am not a morning person,
 and therefore not a big breakfast person
 either. But Pamela's serves breakfast all
day, which for me, is the best possible
deal. Every Sunday, my roommate
Rhonda and I crawl out of our rooms at
about 1 pm, saunter up to Pamela's for a
late brunch. It's truly wonderful. In
short, Pamela's rules.
   But eating out all the time is rela tively unhealthy, and it tends to wreak
 havoc on my miniscule budget. And so,
 I have come to learn, that an occasional
 trip to the grocery store is a much easier
 way to survive. Pitt students have been
 blessed with an extremely convenient
 grocery store - Giant Eagle. Well, I
 say it is a blessing because of the close
 location. But anyone who has actually
 shopped there, knows that it isn't much
 to brag about.
 Allow me to explain. Last summer,
 Giant Eagle closed down for remodel ing. This was a smart move, because it
 was sort of a shambles beforehand. I
 anxiously awaited the opening of the
 new Giant Eagle.
 But when it reopened - well maybe I
 was in a time warp or something - but
 it was exactly the same. Nothing had
 changed, except that some of the aisles
 had been switched around, which only
 caused confusion. But basically, there
 were the same long lines, picked over
 produce, and frost- itten frozen foods.
 I don't understand. But as I said, it is
 convenient, and for that alone, I sup pose I shouldn't complain.
 So, there it is. Every option for find ing edibles in Oakland. Hmm. Maybe
    better keep looking for that care
package from mom.

A mon the many concerts held in the Pitts-

burg area this year, the Pitt Program
Council had a hand in bringing many of these
artists to the City.

Michelle Shocked, who describes herself as a
“feminist, anarchist, poet, skateboard punk
rocker, hitchhiker, ps chiatric hospital inmate,
jailbird, runaway, col ege graduate, storyteller
and rape Victim,” opened for Billy Bragg at the
Carnegie in October. Shocked, 25, released
her latest album, Short, Sharp, Shocked in Au-

ust.
g Racy, semi-hardcore band, Fishbone per-
formed at the Syria Mosque in October. The
energy of members “Fish” and Angelo Moore,
pictured far right, led to a spectacular per-
formance.

Both concerts were sponsored by the Pitt

Program Council.

Bringing jazz to Pittsburgh

L ooking around the office ﬁlled with

several instruments, musical scores
and plaques, one would be amazed that
one person could accomplish so much,
until they realize who the person is —
Nathan T. Davis. The credentials of Na-
than T. Davis are not only in the realm of
his office, but they are in writing on his
Ph.D. from Wesleyan University, in his
musical performance and last but not
least, his eighteen years of teaching here
at the University of Pittsburgh.

His unique teaching style is based on a
never ending story, the life ofjazz and its
participants. His ability to bring alive with
vivid detail each figure and era in the
history ofjazz, stems from his passion for
educating, as well as for music.
“Education is something in the musical
ﬁeld that is not necessary, but I strongly
recommend it. What if you get out there
and things don’t go the way that you per-
ceive? Where would you be? That’s why
education is important, because it rounds
the total person, making it easy to apply
other skills to get what you want,” says
Dr. Davis. He uses his education in the
field of sociology when he travels to dif-
ferent countries to enhance his knowl-
edge of their culture. He feels, however,
that the mastery of some things do not

always take place within a learning in-
stitution. Often the learning process takes
place by practice and participation,
whether it be speaking a foreign language
or playing an instrument. In his case he
does both quite well.

Nathan Davis can be heard not only in
the U.S., but all over Europe. He was
introduced to Europe as a student at the
University of Kansas, where he was in a
tour group working in the USO for the
troops in France, Monaco and Germany.
He vowed to return to Germany or
France where he found the people to be
most respectful of jazz music. That
chance came when he was drafted into the
armed services and stationed in West Ber-
lin. While in Berlin he played at various
night clubs which gave him recognition.
His talent was witnessed by a man who
played in a famous night club who later,
when the star saxophone player couldn’t
make it, gave his name as a fill-in.

While playing with the band he was
introduced to the legendary Kenny
Clarke, from Pittsburgh. Clarke enjoyed
Dr. Davis’ playing style so much that he
told him he would send for him. Clarke
did send for him, two weeks later with a
plane ticket to Paris where he would re-
side for ten years. The ten years in Paris

brought nothing but pure success to
Dr. Davis.

His success was world wide. Europe
loved him so much that he became a
familiar face to television and movies.
Dr. Davis was in great demand at sev-
eral universities including the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh, which wanted him to
bring his great talents to the classroom.

When Dr. Davis came to Pittsburgh,
other aspects of his career remained
unchanged. He was still touring, mak-
ing records, and founding new proj-
ects. Major contributions to Pitt made
by Dr. Davis include: The jazz Hall of
Fame located in the student union, the
initiation of the Ph.D. program in Eth-
nomusicology, the Undergraduatejazz
Studies Program, and finally, the An-
nualjazz Seminar and Concert.

Dr. Davis is a major contributor to
the University of Pittsburgh's culture.
When he left Europe he brought with
him not only his credentials and talent,
he brought finesse and sophistication.
Dr. Nathan T. Davis is a man deserving
of respect and can easily be thought of
as the man who brought the meaning
ofjazz to Pittsburgh.

Jazz Seminar ends on high note

T he 18th Annualjazz Seminar con-
cluded with a concert at Carnegie
Music Hall. According to Nathan Davis,
chairman of the 1988 jazz Seminar
Committee, it was one of the best jazz
Seminar Concerts ever held.

“I had a ball,” Davis said, attributing
much of the concert’s success to the
energetic response of the audience
throughout the concert.

The jazz Concert featured Grover
Washington, Jr. (pictured above) and
Davis on saxophone, Freddie Hubbard
and Terrence Blanchard on trumpet,
Bllly Cobham on drums, Monty Alex-
ander on piano and Abraham Laboriel
on bass. After the intermission, Hub-
bard received a plaque for his achieve-
ments as a musician which was
presented by Dr. Donald Henderson,
the vice provost at Pitt and the eve-

If

ning’s master of ceremonies.

“Whenever you’re recognized in
your own country, it makes you feel
proud,” said Hubbard of his award. He
added that because of the fact thatjazz
is not well recognized throughout the
world, many musicians turn to drugs
and alcohol.

“Awards like this will help me to help
other guys stay straight,” he continued.
“I should continue to play the best I
can.”

Davis agreed with Hubbard, stating
that “in the United States, people won’t
give money to jazz” as opposed to the
symphony.

Hubbard thanked Pitt and Davis for
“helping to perpetuate the field of
jazz.” Although the musicians played
together throughout most of the con-
cert, each was given the opportunity to

display his individual talents with nu-
merous solo pieces.

In addition, several artists, including
Washington, performed individually
songs such as “Georgia On My Mind”
(played by Davis), “When I Fall in
Love" (Blanchard), “Embraceable
You” (Hubbard), and “Regulator”
(Alexander), all backed by Laboriel,
Cobham and Alexander.

Other selections including “Down
and Under,” “Resolution,” “Time-
Out," and “Stacks Full” featured the
entire ensembles.

Thejazz Seminar, exclusive to Pitt, is
a series of workshops held by each artist
before the concert. This way, Davis
said, people can get first-hand knowl-
edge ofjazz.

SPRING BREAK '

Jon Anderson photo

36 Spring Break

stepped off my bus back into Pitt ter-
I ritory. I had survived spring break at

Daytona Beach. But I didn't feel too
well. Lack of sleep and an 18 hour bus
trip made my body hate me. I was craving
alcohol at noon, and I wondered about
the possibilities of detox.

I cannot deny that it was a dream as-
signment. My trip was paid for, and my
food would be covered by The Pitt News.
All I had to do was cover spring break as
a participant, something I did my best to
do.

Now I couldn't help feeling like I
needed a vacation.

I can‘t really complaittabout the bus
trip down to Florida. Th e is really no
way to make it fully engoyiabtle, but the
Pitt Program Council did its best. Our
buses were all 1988 or ‘89 models, as
op osed to the relics from the early
19 0'5 used on other trips, and were all
equipped with VCRS. They were also the
widest buses available.

However, there is no wa ' to avoid dis-
comfort on such a long ride. Being able
to drink on the bus was a comforting
factor, and was the only way that I could
fall asleep. Some eople didn’t seem to
need sleep thoug . PIKA brother jay
Reid was able to drink for the full 18
hours, an accomplishment that even out-
shined his victory in the surﬁng contest.

Ironically, the sun did not come out
until we were 15 minut s from Daytona.

I didn‘t realize that this was a sign of
things to come.

We arrived in Daytona around I:00
pm, _just in time to catch some of the
contests on the back deck of the hotel.
Miraculously, my roommate was able to
check in before most of the guests
swarmed on the check-in table, and I was
able to reach poolsidejust in time for the
bikini contest. As I drank my first beer in
Daytona, I couldn't help but wonder
about the things to come.

judging the state of Florida by the city
of Daytona Beach is like judging Pitts-
burgh by Schenley Park. Prior to my
vacation, visions of modern-day Sodom
and Gomorrah often cagmeyyto my mind
when someone mentiorted Florida. I
didn't know how wrong I was.

On Saturday night, I traveled north to
_]acksonville to visit my older brother.
While we were driving through town, I
commented about a sign outside a church
that said, “Life with Jesus is an endless
hope. Life without Jesus is a hopeless
end." I wouldn’t have said anything. but
it was about the hundredth religious-
oriented sign I had seen in Jacksonville.
My brother, who has lived in Florida for
only two years, told me that he was
amazed by the influence fundamentalist
Christians had on the city.

“That was one of the first things I
noticed when 1 moved here," he told me,
rolling his eyes. “The chuich people are

always on the news, and they seem able to
affect the local and state governments."
Yeah, but this is Jacksonville, I thought
to myself. Nothing like that happens in
Daytona Beach. Little did I know.

It is difficult to attribute this to the
religious influence, but when I returned
to Daytona, I found a more conservative
attitude than I expected. The bars and
liquor stores were stricter about under-
age drinking, but I had heard they were
going to crack down on the spring break-
ers. My true surprise came when I saw
the “wet T-shirt" contest.

Everyone who has ever seen a spring
break movie knows that many ofthe girls
in the movie take off theirfshirts during
the competition. The people whowent to
Daytona last year told me that this ac-
tually happens, too. However, it doesn‘t
happen anymore. According to an em-
ployee of I’enrod's bar, a girl was ar-
rested for indecent exposure after she
bared her breasts during the contest.
Now, with the police standing nearby,
the Penrod’s people tell the girls not to
take off their shirts.

My brother's words about the influ-
ence of the church came back to me.

After three days of beautiful weather,
the gods must have feared we were
homesick, because we were blessed with
Pittsburgh weather from Tuesday on. I
couldn’t believe I was facing 40 degree
weather. 3 .

Students balance college with family

babysitters.” Unfortunately, a hired
babysitter would be the only person
who would be able to care for Brit-
tany. Nicolle and Michael are both
from Syracuse, N.Y., and have no
famil in Pittsburgh at all. They also
say-t at they have no close friends
with whom they would feel comfort-
able leaving Brittany.

There are other sacriﬁces that the
two have to make. The cost of Brit-
tany-’s clothes,5:food, andilmedicine

revents Michael and Nicolle from

uying new clothes and luxuries for
themselves. Since Michael and Nicolle
are not eligible to receive any welfare

The marvel of Maazel

ne would not expect that a man with the

genius and prestige of Lorin Maazel would
be so understated. Considering that he is one of
the most highly acclaimed and eagerly sought af-
ter conductors today, one might think that he
would be a man of extremes. But instead, he is
warm, humorous and refined. Even his office at
the Pittsburgh Symphony reflects these traits.
The walls are white, and a brown wood Steinway
8c Sons piano sits off to the side. Ifone cairjudge a
man by his surroundings, let it be said that Maazel
is a man of sophistication and class,

This year, Pittsburgh was able to gain the bril-
liance of his character, when Lorin Maazel ac-
cepted the position of Music Director for the
Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra. But Maazel,
who was born in Paris, is no stranger to this city.
He grew up in Pittsburgh, and even studied here,
at the University of Pittsburgh, from which he
received an honorary doctorate.

Maestro Maazel, a child prodigy, studied con-
ducting in Pittsburgh, and, at age nine, appeared
as conductor at the New York World’s Fair. It was
at age sixteen when he entered the University of
Pittsburgh, where he studied philosophy and lit-
erature.

I “I was keen about Pitt for what it offered out-
side of the fields of my immediate interest
(music),” Maazel said in a personal interview. “I
was trying to get ready for the big world, the real
world, if there is such a thing.“

Obviously, the Maestro found the real world,
with a lot to contribute to it. He has conducted
over 3,500 operas and concert performances
around the globe. He is a conductor, composer,
concert violinist, television director and enter-
tainer, administrator and writer. He has held
posts in countries across the globe including Ber-
lin, London and France. For a man who is so well

traveled, schooled, and experienced, some may
wonder how it is that he returned to Pittsburgh.

“When I grew up in Pittsburgh," said Maalel,
“the city was the industrial capital ofthe east. The
steel mills, and all the unpleasant by-products ofa
heavy industry were set up right in the city. I was
certainly culturally oriented, if there is such an
orientation. That is, I like music, I like painting, I
like literature.

“I figured that when I grew up, graduated or
whatever, I would go abroad, which I did. And
then I didn‘t come back here for 25 years until
the University of Pittsburgh offered me a doc-
torate. And I said, ‘okay, I‘ll fly in, in the morn-
ing, take my doctorate and leave, because I never
want to see another steel mill.‘ And on the way to
the airport, much to my stupification, it was all
gone. The city was beautiful. The Golden Tri-
angle had become the Golden Triangle, and the
Cathedral of Learning looked more imposing
than ever.

“But, there were still some holdovers from the
old Pittsburgh, the good old Pittsburgh, because it
wasn’t all negative. For example, the Pittsburgh
Symphony which, under the direction of Fritz
Reiner, had achieved international status. The
University of Pittsburgh had always had a great
reputation. Salk worked there and developed a
vaccine for polio. They were making their con-
tributions regularly."

Maazel, who grew up during WWII, said that
the city had flourished beautifully by the time
that he came to work at the Pittsburgh Sym-
phony. He was an artistic advisor to the orchestra,
but did not want the title of music director.
Maazel had worked for almost 20 years in ad-
ministrative posts, and did not want to continue.
“I just wanted to guest conduct, put my feet up
and watch television, play with the kids," he said.

But over the course of about 2% years, he
began to take on more responsibilities, in-
cluding music advisor and principal guest con-
ductor, until finally, Maazel accepted the title
and post of Music Director. “I was more than
happy to because by that time, I had really
come to love the orchestra and the people
here. I was really getting fond of this place."

Today, Maestro Maarel is lending his talents
not only to Pittsburgh, but to several char-
itable causes around the world. He is currently
involved in Classic Aid concerts in conjunction
with the United Nations. He is also involved in
organizing benefit concerts for UNICEF.
Maazcl feels that in associating classical music
with causes of social concern, it will help to
heighten awareness to problems around the
world. For his efforts, Maazel was named the
United Nations Ambassador of Good Will.

Despite all of his time consuming projects,
Maaxel does get a chalice to return to his alma
mater every now and then. For the Bicen-
tennial, in 1987, he composed and conducted
a piece entitled “Fanfare." He was also pre-
sented the Bicentennial Medallion of Honor.
And, occasionally, he slips back to campus, for
a visit.

“I went back and visited the Nationality
Rooms, sort of incognito. They're still beau-
tiful. It's all the same. nothing's changed.
Which is good."

Lorin Maazel is a man of passion, concern,
and insurmountable talent. The city of Pitts-
burgh, as well as the University will continue
to be graced with his presence and lasting
influence. Which is also good.

D uring his acceptance speech, Re-
publican President—F.lect George
Bush pledged to “keep the conver-
sation going” between himself and
the American people. Assured his vic-
tory, the Vice President stood before
a cheering Houston crowd, informing
the audience Democratic candidate
Michael Dukakis had conceded the
election. Dukakis conceded his defeat
to Bush over the telephone from Bos-
ton and said to a nationally televised
rally that the nation would have to
work together to solve America’s
problems. “I want you to know
(Dukakis) was most gracious. His call
was genuinely friendly and it was in
the great tradition of American pol-
itics,” Bush said.

“We can now speak the most ma-
jestic words a democracy has to of-
fer,” Bush said. “The people have
spoken." Bush said, “It’s occurred to
me that what we were having, the
people of America and I, was a con-
versation. A back and forth. A mutual
dialogue. And it cannot go away, not
now, not when I need it most.” Bush
thanked the American people, as well
he made special mention of Ronald
Reagan who he thanked for “turning
our country around and for being my
friend and for going the extra mile.”
This, he said, wasjust like Reagan to
do. He added that the President was
“simply one of the most decent men I
have ever met."

“This is a moving night for all of
us,” Bush said, “and you can’t help
but be moved when your country en-
dorses your hopes and your candidacy
and the feelings are so personal that
the decision is larger than that, and
now we will again, form an America
that is strong and resolute in the
world. Strong and big hearted at
home, and when I said I want a
kinder, gentler nation I meant it, and
I mean it."

Bush tried to separate his election
from the negative campaign that en-
sued between him and Dukakis. The
Vice President said, “A campaign is a
disagreement, and disagreements di-
vide. But an election is a decision, and

decisi()ns clear the way for harmony
and peace. And I mean to be a Pres-
ident of all the people and I want to
work for the hopes and interests, not
only ofmy supfporters, but ofthe Gov-
ernor’s and () those who didn’t vote
at all. To those who supported me, I
will try to be worthy of your trust and
to those who did not, I will try to earn
it and m hand is out to you, and I
want to e your President, too,” he
said.

He thanked his running mate, Dan
Quayle, who did not attend the ac-
ceptance speech, rather he was in
Washington, D.C., accepting his elec-
tion as Vice President. “The only
thing I can say is that you did it, we
did it and George Bush did it,” said
Quayle. “Thank you very much. You
have truly made this the most mem-
orable night of our lives and believe
me . . . we will never forget this night.
We won’t forget what you did for me
and what you have done for George
Bush." Quayle was very thankful to
the people who helped behind the
scenes of the Bush-Quayle ticket. He
said, “For nearly three months since
our convention in August, we have
witnessed firsthand the dedication

and professionalism of literally thou-
sands of supporters, volunteers and
staff members everywhere, through
38 states and for more than 235 sep-
arate appearances." Quayle’s seat in
the senate will now be up for appoint-
ment.

Bush spoke of Michael Dukakis
during his speech. He said that he
knew how Dukakis felt, having lost
elections himself along the way. “We
both went into the arena, and we
fought long and hard and the G()v-
ernor can feel great satisfaction that
his valiant family . . . did him proud,”
he said.

“And now I know that we’ll come
together as we always have, 200 years
of harmony in the oldest, greatest de-
mocracy in man’s time on earth. I
mean to keep the conversation going,
to keep walking towards you, talking
with you and reaching for the hands,
and another thing, I’ll do my level
best to reach out and work construc-
tively with the United States Con-
gress,” he continued.

esse Jackson Jr., son of the former
J presidential candidate warned stu-
dents that their civil rights would
be in danger if the Vice President
were to be elected, and encouraged
them to vote for Michael Dukakis at
the William Pitt Union in October.

“The generation of the ’80’s must
accept our challenge,” ackson said.
“You owe it to those w o fought for
your right to vote.”

Jackson defended liberals, calling
19th century slave owners men of
“traditional values with a superiority
complex.” He also called the men who
wrote the Constitution conservative
because they denied women and blacks
the right to vote.

“In New York Harbor stands not
the statue of conservatism,” Jackson
said. “It took them (liberals) years of
winning and losing struggles, but they
never lost sight of what side they were
on.”

He said that conservatives mislead
the public through their use of lan-
guage. Jackson said that “poor people

SPEAKERS

steal, rich people embezzle. Just big
words meaning the same thing.”

Jackson added the “states’ rights”
movement as an example of using lan-
guage to cover up conservative move-
ments. He said that people like former
Sen. Barry Goldwater tried to use
states’ rights to avoid following civil
rights legislation.

“Those who liberate invest in peo-
ple. That’s why we defeated Judge
Bork, and that’s why we must defeat
Geor e Bush,” he said.

Jac son said that the candidates’ tel-
evision commercials did not answer
the questions of the public. He called
the Vice President’s commercials
“Bush Lite commercials. High on cal-
ories, low on substance.”

He also attacked Bush for support-
ing apartheid in South Africa, run-
ning pictures of a black man in anti-
Dukakis commercials and for calling
his father “a Chicago hustler.”

“Pm not even sure that Dan Quayle
knows that Nelson Mandela is in jail,”
Jackson said of the senator’s qualiﬁ-

cations for vice president.

Jackson echoed Sen. Bentsen’s com-J
ment that Sen. Quayle was “no Jack,

Kennedy,” because Kennedy was a

war veteran who ran unsuccessfully.

for the presidency in 1956.

“Quayle inherited from the top/2;

down w at Kennedy worked for from
the bottom up. Dan Quayle ducked the
Viet Nam War, which coming from a

hawk sounds pretty chicken to me,”:%f

Jackson said.

Jackson defended Dukakis’ lack of .

hen Congressman Louis Stokes was grow-

ing up in Ohio, it was his mother’s dream

that he graduate from high school, Stokes
said in a speech about motivation in education
in November. Stokes’ speech was a part of the
Black Action Society’s Black Week, held No-
vember 7-12.

‘_‘It was her greatest dream that her boys ac-
quire. not college degrees, but high school di-
plomas,” Stokes said of his mother. “At that
time, for a black youngster, a high school di-
ploma was the key to open up the door to a
relatively good job.”

Stokes volunteered for the Army after high
school. When he was discharged, he took ad-
Vantage of the GI Bill and went to college. His
mother, however, encouraged him to get a job
mf*teads_80 that he could help her.

‘She Just couldn’t wait for me to go through
811 this additional education.” Stokes got a job
and went to college at night. This included law
school. which took him four years.

Stokes’ brother Carl saw what he was doing
and went back to high school to earn his own

diploma, and later went to college. Stokes said
that as a result, Carl was later elected to the
Ohio state legislature. In 1967, Carl became the
first black mayor of Cleveland, which was the
eighth largest city in the United States.

In 1968, Stokes was elected to the U.S. House
of Representatives, becoming the first black
congressman from Ohio. According to him, his
mother was the motivation for his accomplish-
ments.

“Had it not been for her imploring and beg-
ging and urging us to acquire an education, Carl
and I probably would have gone the way of most
of the young men with whom we associated with
at the time,” Stokes said of his mother. He also
stated in his speech that most of the peers he had
when he was growing up are either dead or in
prison.

“We were fortunate in our family to have this
type of a mother,” Stokes continued, “even
though we were not fortunate enough to have a
father at home.”

During his 12 terms in Congress, Stokes
served on many committees, including acting as

chair on the Intelligence Committee, the Ethics
Committee and the House Select Committee on
Assassinations in 1976, which investigated the
deaths of John F. Kennedy and Martin Luther
King Jr. In addition, Stokes served two terms as
chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus.

Stokes also served on such committees as the
House Appropriations Committee, the House
Un-American Activities Committee and the
Iran-Contra Panel.

Stokes pointed out that his inauguration in
1969, in addition to that of Shirley Chisholm
and William Clay, marked the first time since
1875 that more than eight blacks served in the
House of Representatives.

Stokes concluded his speech by commenting
on the small audience present. “With the num-
ber of black students you have on this campus,
this room should be full tonight. It’s sort of like
church: You’re preaching to the ones who are
there, but you need to be preaching to the ones
who are not there.”

he Software Engineering In-

I stitute was once again the tar-
get of rotesters seeking to

expose “Star ars” research.

A vigil for peace, followed by a
press conference, was held at War-
ner Hall on Carnegie Mellon’s cam-
pus. Vince Eirene, one of the protest
organizers, stated that he was
“morally outraged that it (Carnegie
Mellon) was originally an art
school” but has been “turned into a
war colle e.” According to research
conducte for the protesters by Ed
Pervin, “SEI has been caught in the
act of supplying software products
for the planning of nuclear war.”

Accordin to the Council on Eco-

nomic Priorities, “Between 1983 and
1986, Carnegie Mellon accepted no
less than six ‘Star Wars’ research
contracts.” It still has not been de-
termined if any of the contracts are
connected to research done by the

SEI. According to Pervin, the SEI is
writing software for an inertial nav-
igation system in which information
is ‘gathered about a ship’s position
an relative motion. “SEI is writing
the parts up to, but not including, the
part that actually fires these mis-
siles,” said Pervin.

Eirene said that Provost Angel
Jordan promised to give copies of six
SEI contracts to Carnegie Mellon’s
underground newspaper The Student
Union, but has not et done so.
Eirene said that Carnegie Mellon
and SEI are teaming up to become a
vital part of the U.S. military. Eirene
feels that CMU should not be in-
volved because “academia should be
about preserving lives, not destroy-
ing them.”

56 Smoking

Hon-Smokers . . 

was in a small, confined waiting

room one day, and some guy I
don’t even know lit a cigar and prac-
tically blew smoke in my face. I
turned my attention from my book to
this guy and told him that I thought it
was very rude of him to light a cigar
without asking me if I minded. He
replied, “I’ll smoke dis cigar if I want
to. I don’t need your approval.”

This comment didn’t go over big
with me. I rose,.stepped‘ out of the
room, went to the nearest drug store
and bought a tin of Skoal chewin’
tobacco. I loaded up my cheek and
gum full of this pollutant’ stuff, came
back to the room and sat down right
next to this rude hog. After a minute
of heavy salivation, I got right up in
his face and said, “This is what it is
like when your foul cigar smoke
comes into my air.” I leaned forward
and spit a stream of dark, brown to-

bacco juice at his ugly face.

After I ran like hell, I thought that
it was the rudest thing in the world
for that toilet merchant to sit next to
me and blow his combination bad
breath /second hand smoke in my face
and space. Yeah, sure, even though
it’s a ﬁlthy habit, iris hlS,COnStltI.l.-
tional right to smoke. But more im-
portantly, it is my constitutional right
to breathe the cleanest air possible.

It is not fair to those who delib-I-I“
erately chose not to breathe cigarette
smoke and risk not being super-cool
by avoiding smoking to have someone

else force you to breathe smoke. This

threatens the health of a non-smoker
who, in turn, is an innocent victim.

I talked to a few non-smoking Pitt
students who have ‘made some good“

points. The most important message
that students convey is that they are

laid back about the issue but just want“

- -V 

to see more courtesy on the part of
smokers. One non-smoker who is very
firm about his opinion cracked my
lid. They call him Big Jim. He is a

L ocal chapters of Amnesty Inter-
national focused their efforts on
fighting human rights violations in
South Africa. By addressing this par-
ticular country, the local groups are
following the lead of Amnesty’s head-
quarters in London, England.

“We typically do country campaigns
upon request from London. It isn’t
that one country is worse than anoth-
er, it’s just that we usually decide to
concentrate our efforts on one coun-

try at a time,” said Pittsburgh Am-S

nesty Group 39 leader Geraldine

S i Malmberg.

There are two local groups, three
local campus groups and five local
high school Amnesty groups in Pitts-

i burgh, which are partgof 3,600 chap-
ters world-wide. Through letter-

Amnesty International

writing campaigns directed at govern-
ment officials and other public-
informing activities, Amnesty Inter-
national seeks the release of prisoners
held unjustly throughout the world
and the abolishment of torture.

Amnesty International was awarded
the Nobel Peace Prize in 1977 for its
efforts.

Amnesty hopes to end the violence
spurred by racial tension in South Af-
rica. The events this year included a
“South African Film Night,” spon-
sored by Group 39; a letter writing
campaign for South African prisoners
of conscience, a Covered Dish Dinner
and Folk Dance, and an outdoor

Write-a-Thon for the South African

prisoners.
Are these activities effective in

 

 

achieving the release of political pris
oners?

“Our success rate is probably be-*4}
tween 30 percent and 35 percent,” 7
Malmberg said. “Local groups have
aided in the release of 14 prisoners
throughout the world over the past 13
years.”

Amnesty’s effectiveness is due to its
publicizing of instances of torture. It
is this publicity which often coercesly.

Oakland 61

S he calls it a game of cat-and-mouse.
She is City Parking Patrol Officer
Lorraine Turner, and the game she is
talking about is avoiding parking me-
ter violations. And this game is be-
coming increasingly popular in Oak-
land.

Turner is one of six city parking
patrol officers who stalks the streets of
Oakland issuing parking tickets and
hunting for people who intentionally
jam meters — people like Roseanne.

Roseanne, a recent Pitt graduate, re-
quested that her real name not be used
because she knows how to play the
parking meter game, perhaps too well.
She has quite an extensive list of ways
to “beat the meters,” as she aptly put
it. “It is like a game. And I know just
about every trick there is and I’ve used
them all,” she claimed.

Among Roseanne’s ploys to beat the
meters is to remove a parking ticket
from somebody else’s windshield and

then place it on her own. “I only do
this when I feel exceptionally mean,”
she said.

Roseanne said she has jammed me-
ters with paperclips — the big ones --
broken in half. “F latten.-. bottlecaps
and nickels work (well) too,” she said.
If Roseanne or anyone else is caught
jamming a meter, he or she could face
a $300 fine, according to Turner.

But Roseanne certainly isn’t the
only one who knows how to jam a
meter. Between 200 and 300 meters
are purposely jammed every day in
Oakland, according to repairman Matt
Dukovich. A crew of six repairmen
work full-time to repair the city’s
jammed and broken meters. Dukovich
said that Oakland meters are, by far,
the most vandalized in the city. “Every
month we repair over 500 meters in
the parking lot between (Hillman) Li-
brary and the Carnegie Library
alone.”

“They stick broken popsicle sticks
in them, beer tabs, bottle caps, paper,
gum, glue, bark from trees, bingo
chips, even pigeon feathers! Guitar,
picks are popular in Oakland. I see
meters with the handles hammered
off. Sometimes they paint the dome
completely black. Once in a while on
Schenley Drive, we’ll find a meter
ripped out of the ground and thrown
over the hill,” Dukovich said.

The parking patrol is fighting back
against meter-jamming by enforcing
violations that most motorists prob-
ably do not realize even exist. Turner i
said that police are now issuing ci-g

E

tations for exceeding the meter’s al-

lotted time limit. This means that if;
you are parked at a two-hour meter %
and return after two hours to “feed the i
meter,” you are actually violating a '*
parking statute and could be ticketed. 

F

J-

On an average day, Turner said that
between 300 and 450 tickets are issued in
Oakland. Roseanne said she had accu-
mulated over 60 parking tickets during
her two years as a Pitt student. She has
fought many of these tickets in city traf-
f_ic court. “If you’re going to fight your
ticket, be prepared to spend at least two
h<_)urs there. And you should go down at
night, with at least five tickets to make it
worth your while. Most of the time you
can get out of at least three of them,” she
said. Roseanne tells the magistrate, “I
Swear to God I put money in it. The
tlmer must be fast.” Or, she says, “It was
Jammed, I swear to God it wasjammed!”

On two occasions, Roseanne sold her

um

car to a family member so she could get
new license plates for it. “By getting
new plates, my car’s record is wiped
clean, more-or-less, because of a hole in
the s stem,” she said, laughing. “It’s
only 24 for new plates, and I owed over
$100 in parking fines. I didn’t want to
get The Boot,” she added.

The boot refers to the Denver Boot, a
device officials attach to one wheel of a
vehicle that immobilizes it until unpaid
tickets are paid in full. Turner said that
violators are put on the “boot list” if
they have four or more unpaid parking
tickets on file. Two officers patrol the
city with minicomputers to catch scof-
flaws (people with unpaid parking vi-

olations.)

Turner and Dukovich said they are
tired of getting bad raps for just doing
their jobs. “Not a day goes by that I’m
not called a four-letter word by some-
body. And I only fix the meters!”
Dukovich said.

Turner said, “In an article in The Pitt
News, they called us ‘Meter Maids from
Hell.’ We are just enforcing the law.
They shouldn’t take it out on us.” Tur-
ner also added that “meter maid” is now
an obsolete, sexist title.

hen it was announced that

Playboy Magazine would be

searching the University of
Pittsburgh for models to feature in
their April issue, Delta Zeta pledge
“Leigh Ann Pratte” said no one from
the sorority ever informed her that she
could be “depledged” if she agreed to
pose.

Pratte, who is using a pseudonym to
avoid excess phone calls from admir-
ers, will face disciplinary charges at a
Delta Zeta meeting this evening for
the photographs appearing in the
“Women of the Big East” issue of
Playboy, featuring undergraduate
women from Pitt as well as Syracuse,
Villanova and other universities in the
Big East conference.

According to Pratte, she received a
phone call Monday night from the
president of her sorority, Maria
Pekich, informing her that she was no
longer a pledge of Delta Zeta. Pekich
refuted the allegation, saying, “I in-
formed her that we will be taking dis-
ciplinary action, but that is the meet-
ing tomorrow. I told her she may no
longer be a pledge [following the
meeting]”. Pratte was instructed that
the possibility of her being depledged
was apparent, but that it would not be
decided until a later meeting.

Collegiate Chapter Director Robin
Bedwell explained that when news of
Pratte’s posing surfaced, she contact-
ed the Delta Zeta regional headquar-
ters. At that time, Bedwell was in-
structed to take appropriate actions. “I
can see if I would have worn my let-
ters in the picture, or used my real
name but I didn’t,” said Pratte. “Every
time I did publicity, I never said any-
thing about the sorority. Some people

knew that I was in a sorority, but now
everybody knows.” Pratte contends
the pledges were not told that posing
for the magazine could jeopardize
their standing in the sorority.

Delta Zeta Vice-President Pledge
Trainer Andrea Mercurio explained,
“At the first meeting [during the fall
of 1989] the entire group of pledges
were read our sorority’s code of reg-
ulations and each pledge understood
that their actions represent the entire
sorority.” Perkich would not quote the
exact text that Pratte reportedly vi-
olated, citing the material as a
“secrecy of the sorority.” Pratte said
she was warned not to say anything
“bad” to the media about the sorority
or charges could be brought against
her. Pekich again disputed Pratte’s al-
legations, “The word, charges, or legal
whatever, was not brought up. I told
her if slander was done there may be
repercussions.”

Pratte appeared on WTAE-TV’s
Pittsburgh’s Talking where she talked
about her experiences with Playboy
with host Ann Devlin. When asked
whether or not posing had had a bad
effect on her life, Pratte revealed her
sorority’s reaction. “If they had not
called me,” Pratte said, “I would not
have said a word about the sorority.
Even though I knew they were upset
[with her posing], I still wasn’t going
to say anything [until Pekich’s phone
call].” Bedwell said in a prepared
statement that she was “disappointed”
Pratte had talked to the media before
the sorority had a chance to consult
her about the disciplinary charges.

P si Chi is the National Honor
     Society in Psychology found     ed in 1929 for the purpose of
encouraging, stimulating, and
maintaining scholarship in the science of Psychology.
  Psi Chi serves two major goals: to
provide academic recognition to its
initiates through membership; and
to nurture the spark of that accomplishment by offering a climate
congenial to its creative development. A Psi Chi National Council
governs the Society which is one of
the four largest honor societies in
the Association of College Honor
societies.
  The intrinsic value of membership is rewarding not only to the
achiever but to others and to the
field of psychology. The achievement and recognition of excellence
leads to self-fulfillment and thus to
self-realization. By recognizing that
what we do does make a difference, we
are stimulated to higher productivity.
Accomplishments are enjoyed more
through sharing. In addition, the contacts made through Psi Chi will be
valuable throughout educational and
professional careers.
  Opportunities are made available to
the members of Psi Chi for promoting
their research; for national and international recognition; for contact
and interaction with the leaders in
their field and to meet Psi Chi members of other chapters. Meetings also
become a forum for exchange of information between students and faculty members.
  The University of Pittsburgh Chapter is operated by student officers and
faculty advisors. Together they select
Psi Clhi
and induct members and carry out the
goals of the society. Membership in
this prestigious organization is earned
and is for life. Membership rolls are
preserved at the Psi Chi national office and can be called upon for reference purposes such as applications
for graduate school and jobs.
