Emgltt O354 CM/onds (Ml Images

What does Pitt 101
mean? Well, it means
just what you think it
means . .. the introduc-
tory course on Pitt!!

ing 320 pa es, you will
see many acets of the
University of Pittsburgh.
From classes to sports,
from student life to or-
ganizations, and much,
much more are all in-
cluded here in this year-

photographs. In essence,
the earbook is the text-
boo for a course on Pitt

incorporated this theme
throughout the book by
way of listing actual Pitt
courses as our sub-
headlines, where appro-

riate. So ull up a com-

ortable c air, sit back
and relax, because this is
one textbook that won't
put you to sleep‘.

1994. Beyond lectures
and community service,
ASL gives out cha ter
and national scho ar-
ships. Finally, ASL gives
its members experience
in management and an-
alytical and organiza-
tional skills.

All members of ASL
are students of CGS and
have atleast 30 credits
with no previous degree,
but what sets ASL mem-

ASL October inductees.

bers apart is their high5

degree of scholarship.
All members must be in
the top 10% of the class
and have a minimum
QPA of 3.25!

The ASL cha ter here
at Pitt is the A pha Chi
Chapter. It has been a
part of CGS for 21 years.

Dutton

Senior Spotlight

Laurie A. Dutton was
involved in many activ-
ities, including the elec-
tions committee, the
Asian Studies Club, the
Emerging Leader pro-
gram, the Undergradu-
ate Economics Society,
and Hand-in-Hand.
One highlight of her
Pitt career was being
picked in her junior
year with others to
have dinner with the
Chancellor. She also
interned at the Canadi-
an Consulate her senior
year.

Laurie's favorite quote is
Groucho Marx's line,
”One night down in deep
dark Africa, I shot an el-
ephant in my pajamas.
How he got into my pa-
jamas, I'll never know!”

Laurie majored in eco-
nomics &: political science
with an Asian studies cer-
tificate. In a year, she
plans to return for her
master's in International
Economic Policy. She
would like to dedicate her
degree to her father who
died in 1993.

The Cathedral

<l>l/[5/l lvttno to ./llIC9\i’(€ClUIL€

There it is . . . the
Cathedral of Learn-
ing. Ri ht smack in
the mi dle of the Pitt
campus. With its 42
stories and Gothic ar-
chitecture, the Cathe-
dral is a symbol of
the University of
Pittsburgh and prob-
ably the first image to
come to mind when
someone mentions
Pitt.

If ou’re a regular
old AS student like
me, dyou probably
spen most of your
time in this mono-
lithic tribute to Goth-
ic architecture. Fresh-
men, get used to it-
unless you lan to

declare a rea major.
Then, you may only

need to take a few
classes here. If not,
you'll prett much
spend the ulk of
your college exist-
ence hikin up the
stairs to t e third
floor (since only one
of the elevators stops
there and who has
time to wait for it?)
Or you'll wait forever
for an elevator to one
of the u per ﬂoors,
just watc which one
you get on. Other-
wise, you'll end up
somewhere beyond
the 18th floor.

The Cathedral
holds a special place
in my heart, as well
as in those of many
other Pitt students.
Being a senior, I've

spent many, many
hours in this im-
mense ’o"uilding.
From working in Roy
Rogers on the ground
floor to s ending
many a niglit in the
dim Commons Area
studying for finals.
Well, not really
studying- more like
socializing, but as far
as mom and dad are
concerned-studying!

The Cathedral isn't
just studyfest '94. It is
also a host for many
campus functions.
Everything from the
annual stair climb to
tours of the building
and the Slovak Her-
itage Festival. The
Cathedral is not only
a site for university

functions. It has a
rich history and some
fascinating facts that
many people don't
know about. Were
ou aware of the fol-

owing facts?

Senior Spotlight

Senior Steven Walker
is quite an accomplished
young man. He is very
much involved in every-
thing he does. His activ-
ities here on campus in-
clude: President of the
Pre—Medical Organiza-
tion for Minorit Stu-
dents, Vice-Presi ent of
the Blue and Gold So-
ciety, Mentor, Black Ac-
tion Society, Who's Who
in American Universities
and Colleges, and
Homecoming Court
1993.

Steve is also a very
busy man as you can see,

for he is not only very
active on campus but a
honor student as well!
Gaining his degree
in Neuroscience is cer-
tainly not the end of
the academic road for
this scholar, for Steve
plans on attending
medical school in the
fall after graduation
this year.
-Best of luck
in medical school!

Brotherhood, sister-
hood, friendship, sup-
port, fun, stress, love,
work, parties, pledging,
loyalty, trust. . . What ex-
actl does it mean to be
”G EEK”?

When you first
come to college ”greek”
sounds like an out of
reach thing that you'll
never figure out. In re-
ali , it is very tangible,
an at the same time, it is
all of the thin s that I
just mentione . Some-
times people laugh at it
and ask if it's like the
KEG or the ALPHA
house on the television
show ”90210”. Well, I

uess it could be, but
ere it isn't, Thank God.

The fraternities
and sororities at the Uni-

164 ﬂ Greeks

Versity of Pittsburgh are
always present as they
proudlg wear their let-
ters. ut when they
aren't oing to class the
are ho ding positions al
over the campus.

There are greeks
on the Student Govern-
ment Board, the Judicial
Board, in the honor and
service fraternities, Pitt
News and Panther
Prints, Pitt mentoring
and Pathfinders, Project
Tutor, various sports
teams and student or-
ganizations, and much,
much more. When they
aren't seen in their cam-
pus positions, they can

e seen in the streets.
No, not loitering in a
drunken stupor but can-
ning for their chosen

charities. There were
many charity based com-
petitions this year like Pi
Ka pa Phi’s
PU Hathon, Phi Kappa
Theta’s Miles for Pen-
nies, Sigma Chi’s Derby
Days, and the largest,
Greek Week, this year
for Special Olympics.
What could be better
than a competions where
everyone wins?

When they aren't
collecting for charity,
they are volunteering to
benefit the community
b taking part in things
like the Oakland Clean-
up, Greek 101, the Tel-
ethon for United Cere-
bral Palsey, and the Fra-
ternity Brother Auction
for Make-a-Wish Foun-
dation. Moreover, they

 

are taking care of ov-
erning their own c ap-
ters and the whole greek
system through the Inner
Fraternity Council and
the National Panhellenic
Association.

In that list did I mention
hardwork and dedica-
tion. . .didn’t I?

Then after all of
these things are done
and the their studying
too, they can be seen do-
ing the well deserved
thing, partying. So to be
”GREEK” is enjo ment
and sometimes su fering
as with most things. But
to be ”GREEK”, espe-
cially at the University of
Pittsburgh, is something
to be proud of.

Rush? Yea, I do it con-
tantly, most college stu-
dents do? No, no, no -
Not that rush- sorority
and fraternity rush 
what's that you ask. . .

Sorority and fraternity
rush is one of the most
important events on the
Greek calender. It is a
time when they open up
their houses to every stu-
dent on the university
campus. It allows the
students to meet the sis-
ters or brothers and de-
cide which house is right
for them. It gives new
students a chance to feel
not so overwhelmed by
our huge Pitt campus. It

 

166 k Greeks

greeelg flmnﬁ

provides everyone a
chance to become a part
of one of the most in-
ﬂuential, rewarding and
recognized communities
not only on the Pitt cam-
pus but all over the
world.

The main rush for the so-
rorities takes lace in the
fall, while raternities
rush in both fall and
sprin semesters. There
are p anned events in the
fall that allow students to
find out what this
”rushing” is all about.
These events include the
Water Melon Picnic,
”Meet the Greeks” and
the Ice Cream social.

  
 
  
  
 
  

Then the fraternities all
make their own schedule
of events that the group
can choose from to do.
On the other hand, the
sororities begin with
twelve rounds where the
girls see ever house.
They then brea it down
to eight rounds, then to
four, then finally comes
Preference Night where
the girls have hopefully
been invited back to their
house of choice. Finally,
after all of that they can
acce t a bid that is of-
fere to them from a spe-
cific house. This time of
rush is an exciting and
exhausting one for both

   
 
 

the rushees and the
brothers and sisters. But

they both come away
from it with something
new and wonderful in
their lives. New pledges
get the chance to form
some of the strongest,
most meaningful friend-
ships they will ever
have, while the fraterni-
ties and sororities get to
pass on their history, tra-
ditions, and friendships
to a great group of new
e

peop .

OOMMPO1148 Kvlowledge, Powelt 5 Desire,

This year's Panhellenic
Association has con-
quered many goals, usu-
ally through stacks of pa-
perwork and mounds of
red tape, but they did it.
This 1993 Executive
Board was awarded the
NorthEast Panhellenic
Overall Excellence
Award for everything
they accomplished this
year. This successful
Board was made up of
Kelly Anne Reddy, Pres-
ident; Heidi Silberstein,
Internal Vice-president;
Jennifer Grupp, External
Vice- resident; Deanne
Ange o, Treasurer and
Secretary Silvia Angelini.
The Panhellenic Associ-
ation didn't run the
Greek system alone,
though. They had help
from the group that
keeps the fraternities ”in
order,” the Inter Frater-
nit Council. The 1993
IF Executive Board con-
sisted of President Brian
Rifkin, Vice-president
for Administration Matt
Friedman, Vice-
president for Recruit-

and Vice- resident for
Programs ee Makiel.
Together these two
groups with their exec-
utive boards, house rep-
resentatives, and chair-
person kept the Greek
system and community
running smoothly.

The governing bodies,
designed for the purpose
of promoting greater
communication within
the system and the Uni-
Versity, created a bond
for the fraternities and
sororities where it was
easy to support each oth-
er while roviding sup-

ort for t eir individual

ouses. They have a job
that is never finished,
and they always take
their work home with
them. But they never fail
to do amazing things for
the Greeks and the com-
munity.

Since being established at Pitt
on May 5, 1920, Alpha Epsilon
Phi has been an active force on
campus. They strongly encourage
sisters to participate in campus ac-
tivities, and they take pride in the
number of leaders who are or
have been members of AEPhi.

Sisterhood is a unique bond
shared by a select few that makes
them especially close. The friend-
ships formed in this sorority are
the kind that last a lifetime. Alpha
Epsilon Phi is proud to be con-
sistently recognized on campus
for their closeness and unity
which comes about b having
events such as pledge s eepovers,
Big/Little activities, community
service, and holiday parties, a fac-
ulty tea, crush party, spontaneous
date arty, and many, man more!
AEP i’s members are aso in-
volved in volunteering at
Riverview Center, the Mentor
Program, Order of Omega, Rho
Lambda, and the Pitt News.

AEPhi gives young women the
opportunity to get to know and
live with a group of individuals
with diverse backgrounds who
share similar goals, ideas, and in-
terests. AEPhi romotes leader-
ship and sister ood, while also
recognizing that the are at Pitt to
receive a strong e ucation. One
way that they romote academics
is through in ividualized study
plans with study sessions at the

ibrary for their pledge program.

The sisters of Alpha Delta boast the title ”The First and the
Finest” as they were the first secret society for women established
in 1851. Although these women are a close sisterhood, they are
also seen in various organizations. They are members of business
and service fraternities, the Pitt band, mentors, resident assistants,
Pitt Program Council, and much more. This sisterhood is also no
stranger to community service, for they are very involved in
helping The Ronald McDonald House. Even though they are busy
on campus, they still have time for an active social calendar. Along
with fraternity mixers, Greek Week events, crush parties and
chapter retreats, the most anticipated event is their Black Diamond
Ball. These women know when it's time to work and when it's
time to have fun, but their most important motto is ”We live for

Moving Into Pitt

Tue/1 2127 }\/lollewlevttl

It happens every year
in September and again
in April. What is it, you
ask? It's moving in and
out of Pitt's dorms (or
residence halls, depend-
ing on your level of po-
litical correctness). Mov-
ing in and out of the
dorms is a tedious and
sometimes aggravating
process that we all must
go through if we want to
reside for eight months
on campus.

Everyone from fresh-
men to fifth-year seniors
sta in these hallowed
ha s. Seniors, like my-
self, who have four
years’ experience under
their belts are practically
experts on the art of or-
ganizin , packing and
totin . I you live in the
Pitts urgh area, moving
can be a lot easier if you
bring thin s down or
send them ome a little

 

at a time . . . less stress on
the old mobile.

What you usually find
on moving day in the
Quad are a bunch of an-
gig and annoyed people
w 0 just want to get the
heck out of there. It's
sheer chaos! Sutherland
Hall is a bit more relax-
ing with its large parking
lot in the rear and easy
access back entrances
which are only open for
moving.

Moving anywhere is
rough and stressful for
most people. Moving
back and forth from
home to college and back
again is just a pain in the
butt. Freshmen, now that
you've had your first ex-
perience with it, learn to
get used to it because it
doesn't get any better
than this.

At Pitt, Kap a Alpha
Theta has a ric tradition
of strong sisterhood
based on bonds of
friendship that last a life-
time. These friendships
grow through the many
different sister activities,
such as sister sleepovers,
big/little week, ice-
skating parties, or the Pi-
rates home opener party.
In addition to sister ac-
tivities, their social cal-
endar is always very
busy with fraternity mix-
ers, crush parties, grab-a-
date arties, informals,
and t eir formal. They
are also proud to be one
of only two sororities at
Pitt to have a house. The
Alpha Omega chapter is
also known for its mem-
bers being high
achievers, since they
strive to their best in
everything from aca-
demics to community
service. Scholarshi and
academics have a ways
been very important to
their sisters. By using

course files, Kite sister
study programs, and cre-
ativity, their scholarship

they are very active
where the community is
concerned. Their sisters
enjoy hel ing their na-

their numbers jumped three
hundred ercent.

Delta Sigma Phi is interested in the college male that can bring something uni ue into
their house, yourself. They pride themselves in the fact that every brother is an in 'vidual
-person. They don't believe in ”molding” their pledges. They believe it is that freedom to be

° yourself that keeps them as stron ly bonded as they are.

The fact that they own their own ouse is one of the many benefits that the offer. A place
to do what you like, take your shoes off, put your feet on the table, etc. The ouse is always
going to be there. As long as it stands, they ave a lace to call home.

The only other piece of information they would li e to tell you about is this. They are a
house of around 40 brothers. With a house that size, they are proud of their accom-
plishments that keep them in competition with the University's larger fraternities.

fraternity as a fully intiate brother. Pledges are not
tested on fraternity history, its workings, or the
Greek system. This fraternity has won many awards

It's that time of year again.
You know, when all the

and fallen to the ground and
the temperature is starting to
dip into the realm of frigid.
It s October 31st- Halloween!
Alri ht all you creative little

on and desi the costume of
the year. otta look awe-
some, I might win a rize!

But where am I going to go
this year? Haven't heard of
any parties on the hill I could
crash. Nope, none in South
Oakland either- at least that I
know of but I'm sure there
are. I know, I can go to
Zelda's! After all, they do take
your picture at the door if you
come incognito. Gee, my
dream, to be on the wall in
Zelda's!

Now that I have a desti-
nation, all I need is a killer
costume. I got it: VAMPIRE! I
did say killer, remember? Call
up my best friend Gin. She
has to come with me. She
thinks she'll be cool and dress
up as Ace Frehley from Kiss.
Actually, now that I see the
costume, it does look cool.
But wait, the makeup. Re-
member old Kiss Videos?
Gene Simmons used to spit
blood and the all wore that
crazy (yet neat goop on their
faces. Yes folks, Gin has ever
so ainstakingly applied a
per ect Ace—mask, just by
co ying a picture. Good job!

but not before we have my

That done, we go down to

happenin and there's even a
few goo costumes ﬂoating
around. Let's see, what do we
have here: 2 prisoners
chained together, a few other
vampires, and Beavis! Hey,
where's Butthead? Oh, he
couldn't make it. Too bad!
And now for the costume
contest. Beavis won, of
course. What normal crazy

for Beavis? He's only part of
the most popular duo on tel-
evision today. At least our
generation thinks so. Who
won for the girls? Oh yeah,
those two jailbirds I men-
tioned earlier. So I didn't win
a prize this year. That's okay,
I ot a semester left and guess
w%1at? Halloween falls right

this time, I'll be ready for it!

16 & Student Life

Greek Week is a string of events committed to helping the S ecial Olym ics of
Pennsylvania. It started with a formal ceremony in the illiam Pitt nion
Ballroom. According to Formal Opening Ceremonies Chairs, Jennifer Scott and

Robert Watson, the event marks a time to strengthen the bonds between all ,

Greeks.

This ear’s events included: Greek God and Goddess, a blood drive, a spring
carniva , a five kilometer run/walk, a dance marathon, a Greek sing, and a
formal.

["IC‘1his stcpr was taken from a Pitt News article written by Mark Gordon and was
a a te or Panther Prints by Beverley Brown.

A in all, the fraternities and sororities raise over $102,000. This surpassed
both their original goal of $100,000 and last year's total of $94,600. The money
came from events includin cannin , the Dance Marathon, the 5K run / walk, a
benefit concert at Metropo , Greek od and Goddess sponsors, and ticket sales
and donations from Greek Week sponsors. Cassi Berarducci, overall chair of
Greek Wfeek, ﬁomrrﬁnted tlirlat evehn ﬂoﬁe money cofuld have bgen raised if it
weren't or t e co weat er w ic ept many raternities rom canning.
However, the problem fixed itself through competition between the houses.

Throughout the week, fraternities and sororities built up points through
participating in different events. Pi Kappa Alpha and Delta Delta Delta took top

onors for overall fraternity and sorority winners, respectively. Delta Tau Delta
and Delta Zeta were awar ed second p ace, while Phi Kappa Theta and Alpha
Epsilon Phi received third. _
Other than just donating time, the Greeks and other students donated blood

as part of three week—long blood drives. According to one of the four chairs of
the Blood Drive Committee, Chris Meier, 2,584 pints of blood were collected
which is equivalent to 7,500 lives being saved.
Congratulations Greeks on raising so much for a great cause!

ROTC stands for Re-

signed to train and ed-
ucate students for the
militar .ROTC is mainly
create as a nationwide
scholarship; however,
ROTC does recruit stu-
dents who are already
attending Pitt. Along
with maintaining a 2.5
overall academic grade
point average, they must
pass a fitness test. Just
some of the ROTC’s ac-
tivities include: raising
the Cathedral Flag, com-
munity service, and vis-
iting vets, but that's not
all they do! Just read
on....
In today's army, the
officers are expected to
be the top of the line,
leading by example in an
ever changing world.
The Army ROTC’s mis-
sion is to train colle e
students to become t e
officers of tomorrow.
Leadership / Excellence is
their motto in which
ROTC cadets strive for
the highest goals in order
to become the best of-

ficers possible. The train-
ing is tough but reward-
ing because those that
accept the challenge are
in store for more adven-
ture and excitement than
the can handle.

gadets train with state
of the art equipment and
have many opportunities
to attend various training
schools such as: Air-
borne School, Air As-
sault School, and North-
ern Warfare School to
name just a few. In the
third year (Junior) of
training, cadets are re-
quired to attend a sum-
mer trainin camp called
Camp Al -American.
Here they have a chance
to hone their skills with
equipment man people
just see on te evision.
Cadets test fire Dragoons
(anti-tank weapons),
drive the abrams M-1,
and get to catch a ride in
a UH-60 Blackhawk hel-
icopter. This is only a
small part of the training
that is provided at Camp
All—American.

The Panther Battalion
here at Pitt has had a

 

204 ﬁ Organizations

long tradition of excel-
lence both here and
abroad. Many of our
graduates participated in
Desert Storm and in the
relief mission in Somalia.
The Ranger Team, a
group of highly motivat-
ed cadets, finished sec-
ond overall in the Ranger
Competition. The Ranger
Competition is held
every ear with schools
from a ong the East coast
participating in various
competitions such as
weapons assembly, basic
riﬂe markmanship, and
others.

Throughout the year,
cadets learn a variety of
subjects ranging from
leadership to platoon
tactics and stategies.
During the week, cadets
participate in physical
training in order to stay
in shape, and twice a se-
mester on weekends the
battalion conducts field
training exercises in or-
der to a ply the the skills
the cadgts have learned
in the classroom. How-
ever, ROTC is not the
only thing cadets do.

They are also involved in
many of the social as-
pects on the Pitt campus.
Man belong to fraterni-
ties /sororities, student
government, hold jobs,
and various sports. The
ROTC at Pitt offers the
student a chance to gain
leadershi , discipline,
new frien s, and a sense
of accomplishment that
is not found anywhere
else.

Panther Prints

Panther Prints, as you should know from read-
ing this book thus far, is the University of Pitts-
burgh's yearbook. We are the organization that
captures the most memorable moments of the year
here at Pitt.

We are a small group consisting of an editor,
two assistant editors, two section editors, four
photographers, and a few others who do all they
can just to get this tremendous job done!

We have had some problems this ear. Our
editor, Bev, wasn't named to the position until
almost October. This made us get a slow start on
the year's events. Then we had to switch gears and
change our original theme,Li'Ue Right Here Right
Now, because after much tiiyin we couldn't get
the rights to the son s. It too a Em night, a lot of
coffee, and a lot of rainstorrning, ut Bev Brow
and Paige Zeitz came up with the idea of Pitt 101.
At first we were only goin to write actual courses

down for the sections of t e book, but when Bev i
saw how man courses actually fit the stories as ,

well, she deci ed to put them with all the stories.

She challenged the staff writers to write any story; A

she could find an ap ropriate subtitle / course for
it. Our staff writers: aige Zeitz, Danelle Marra,
Ste hanie Mescall, and I put her to the test.
other problem was that we have some true
procrastinatiors on the staff! Seniors section editor,
Cecelia didn't get her section done until three da s
before the whole book was turned into the u —
lisher. Pai e’s section, academics, didn't et gone
until the fa the book was handed in. ane11e’s
section, stu ent life didn't et done by its deadline
which was a few months efore the book had to
be finished, and Ste hanie never did finish either
of her two sections, Ereeks and Sports. In the end,
all of this backed up Bev who is also a pro-
crastinator! The only thin we can't figure out is
how we ot this book off aster than any others in
the last ew ears!
. All of us ere at Panther Prints have enjoyed
creating the 1994 Panther Prints Yearbook ’ itt
101’? for you.

gold for the first time in Pitt history

It was the first time this season
that the novice boat consistin of Ed

Matt McGowan, Rob Micheals, Jeff
Maurin, Mark Rhody, Jon Shank,
and Coxwain Michele Brodoski won
a medal, let alone the oldest cup

The novice eight wasn't the onl

gold medal by seven tenths of a

The women's boats were not as
successful as the men, however.

The novice eight boat made it to |

Homecoming 1993

5991032 Sujtistics

Homecoming 1993 started
like many other Pitt
Homecomings  over-cast
with the threat of rain loom-
ing behind the dark clouds
over Pitt Stadium. Unfortu-
nately, the whole day would
turn out to be a dreary one
except for the newly elected
Homecoming Queen, Cassi
Berarducci, and the King,
Matt Brady. The Homecom-
ing game played by the Pitt
Panthers was to be the best
Saturday game they played
this season; however, the
Panthers still lost to Syracuse
in the ﬁnal few minutes by a
field-goal. Naturally the
rain would hold off only so
long and by the start of the
Homecoming procession at
the half, it had begun.

This year’ s court was com-
prised of: Matt Brady, Cassi
Berarducci, Steve Walker,
Lane Christine Homfeck, Da-
vid Ott, Jen Mazzuca, Kelli
Wilmoth, Gerard Benecki,
Nakeea Travis, and Tom
Muscatello. Before the an-

20 “ Student Life

nouncement of the King and
Queen, I had the opportunity
to briefly interview each
member of the court to get a
quote. Some quotes were
short  some were serious
. . . and some were funny, but
here's what everyone had to
say:

Matt Brady on his thoughts
while getting ready ”I
thought I was late(I had
swimming practice.) I also
thought I lost my ticket!”

Cassi Berarducci on her
goals and plans ”I just want
to make Delta Delta Delta
proud.”

Steve Walker on how a
King should look in the year-
book ”A King should look
strong and proud!”

Lane Homfeck on why she
ran for Queen ”I ran to show
that anyone can do it and in
loving memory of my late
brother.”

Erﬁgct on just saying
what came to mind ”I am
happy to be here, and thanks
to everyone for their sup-

port.

Ien Mazzuca on just saying
what came to mind ”It’s an
honor to be on court, and I'm
grateful for KKT’s support.”

Kelli Wilmoth on the last
thing about Homecoming
that she cares to remember
”The score of the game!”

Gerard Benecki on just say-
ing what came to mind ”It’s
an honor to be here repre-
senting Kappa Sigma, and
thanks for their support.”

Nakeea Travis on the first
thing she'll do if she wins ”I’ll
go to Disneyland!”

Tom Muscatello on have
you practiced your wave ”No,
should I have?!”

Finally after interviewing
all ten wonderful court mem-
bers, it was time for a few
pictures and the big an-
nouncement. When the
names of the new King and
Queen were announced, the
smiles of Cassi Berarducci and
Matt Brady brightened up Pitt
Stadium almost as if the
sun,itself, were shining!

But the Homecoming game
is not the only thing to re-
member. Homecoming week-
end is ﬁlled with an array of
activities for all Pitt students
to partake in. For instance,
there is the annual Keg Roll
on the Cathedral lawn. The
laser show and Zambelli
Brothers’ fireworks display
had everyone watching with
awe. But if you missed any of
the events this year, I guar-
antee they will be back for
another exciting Homecom-
ing at Pitt.

This year Pitt baseball clinched its
first Big East regular season Cham-
pionship. They had their best season
ever with a 15 and 5 record in con-
ference games and a record of 28-
13-1 overall in the Big East. Head
Coach Jackson, Big East Coach of
the Year, credits this year's success
to the cohesiveness of the team.

This year's bright star was Josh
Tyler who not only won Pla er of
the Year but also was named t e Big
East batting champ and was also
named as a GTE Academic All-
American with his 3.4 QPA. He had
a .474 battin average which led the
Big East, an Tyler tied for the con-
ference lead in home runs with
eight. On top of that he led the con-
ference in base hits with 37, slug 'ng
ﬁercentage with .782 as wel as

ome runs and hits per game. Tyler,
a junior, also became Pitt's leader in
career steals with 53. However, Ty-
ler was not the only shining star.
Craig Crawley broke the former Big
East mark of 20 steals in a season.
Along with those of Tyler, Pitt set a
Big East (Story continues on next

Page-)

 

 

record with 88 stolen bases while opponents combined for 25.
Crawley then went on to tie for the most scored runs, 29, with
teammate Danny Gonzalez. Crawley and Gonzalez also were in the
top ten in the conference for average, while Tyler Shantz and Scott
Etsell finished in a tie for third in the conference for home runs with
4 and tied for second in the Big East for RBIs.

Pitt baseball wasn't all stick, though. This year pitcher Mrochko set
a new Pitt team record with nine wins in a season. He also tied for
the conference lead in wins with five, and teammate Campbell
placed fifth in strikeouts with 32. Clayton Beirne tied for second in
conference saves with two. Now it was on to the Big East Playoffs.
(Story by Matt Groff, and edited for Panther Prints by Beverley
Brown.)

Unfortunately, the top-seeded Panthers(31-16-1) would not 0
much further this season. They lost their first two games to tlgie
University of Connecticut and Providence which dashed their hopes
of a berth in the NCAA regionals.

At 5:00 PM Friday,

The temperature was
in Florida's normal range
of 75 to 80 degrees. Un-

In the first two rounds of the Big
East Volleyball Tournament, Pitt
stuck to a winning script for a sixth
straight conference title, easil run-
ning Boston Colle e and Vil anova
out of Jake Nevin ield House in
Philadelphia.

Seton Hall tried to manufacture a
late rewrite in the championship
match, pounding the Panthers in the
first two games.

”[The Pirates] were crushing
ba11s,” said Pitt Coach Cindy Brazie .
”After losing that second ame, the
girls thou ht we were stil in this
thing. Be ore the game we said,
’whatever happens, we can come
back because of the things we do

well.’’’

The Panthers (23-9) did enou h
thin s well to crush Seton Hall in the
thir game. This lead the way to a
five game win, Big East title number
six, and an automatic bid to the Na-
tional Collegiate Athletic Associa-
tion tournament. Unfortunately, the
Panthers would lose in the first
round of National competion and
finish their superb season at 23-10.

Continuing Pitt's volleyball Victo-

ries was Pitt outside hitter Ann Ma-
rie Lucanie who collected another
award. The senior from Don Mills,
Ontario became the first Athlete in
Big East history to win Conference
Player of the Year three times in any
sport. Congratulations Ann Marie
and the rest of the Panthers on your
Victorious volleyball year!

As the final buzzer
sounded, ending the
game and the 1993 sea-
son, the seniors on the
Pitt soccor team wished
it was just a bad dream.

The Panthers had de-
feated intra-city rival
Robert Morris, 1-0 in
overtime, but the mem-
ory of the loss to Geor e-
town a few days ear 'er
still remained. Pitt was
not going to the Big East
tournament this season,
ending the hopes of
Pitt's departing class.

”Nothing can make up
for not going to Big
East,” senior ca tain Te
Noething said. We were
really close and we

s(\0CCO’0
P830 OO56 SOCCQIL

didn't get it.”
Erik Duff , who lead
Pitt with 1 goals, said

he wishes things had
turned out differently.

”I had tears in my eyes
after Georgetown, I
couldn't look at any-
one,” Duffy said.

Teammate Micheal
Basca also said that the
loss to Georgetown with
a playoff berth on the
line will not be easily for-

otten.

”It hurt bad, our backs
were against the wall
three games ago, then
we came away with two
big wins,” Basca said. ”It
just seemed like we were
meant to win against

Georgetown, but we
couldn't come up with a
win.”

For Andy Tsouris, who
missed all of last season
with an injury, being so
close and then losing
was tou h to take.

Hea coach Joe
Luxbacher said the seni-
ors had a major impact
during their years at Pitt.

”Our success the last
two or three years has
been a direct result of
their leadership,”
Luxbacher said.

It is clear to see what
the seniors have meant
to the program, with Pitt
setting school record
wins and advancing as

the second seed to the
conference tournament a
year ago. This year, Pitt
rebounded from a 1-3-1
start in conference play
to come within one game
of earning a postseason
berth for the second
straight year.

Thank You Pitt Soccor
for your superb soccor
games!

The days were filled
with lots of people in
bathing suits eating and
drinking and having fun
— what S ring Break is
all about! h, and we al-
most forgot the Venus
Bikini-Dream Team that
entertained the students
every single afternoon
with their Bikini Fashion
Show. The women were
able to view the bathing
suits for prospective pur-
chases and the men were
able to just . . . view.

All in all, the festivities
were done quite tasteful-
ly . . . surprising for
Spring Break, huh? Hon-
estly though, the director
of PPC, Tom Misuraca,
went out of his wa to
make sure that all 0 the
fun was clean and inof-
fensive. It was Very
much appreciated, ac-
cording to most of the
women on the trip.
Thank you, Tom.

The success of the trip
was most definitely due
to the hard work of the
students and staff of the
Pitt Program Council
and the staff of the H01-
iday Inn. The trip pack-
age, the people, and the
lodging were absolutely
superb. At all times the
students were treated
with the utmost respect,
wherever they went.

The ICP Tours livened
up the nights a little with
a ”club-pass” tour they
s/ponsored, called the
’ Panamaniac Card”. It
allowed any Spring
Break student to experi-
ence a variety of the
night life of Panama City
at reasonable prices.
Some of the clubs on the
menu were Club La Vela,
Spinnaker, the U-Turn
Sunburn Saloon, and
Harpoon Harry's.

For a rather tiny strip
of beach, the people and
merchants of Panama
City Beach certainly
know how to let their
hair down and party.
The two biggest clubs on
the strip were Club La

Vela and Spinnaker;
both dance clubs, and
they had several differ-
ent rooms filled with all
types of music. Anyone
could find either of these
clubs enjoyable with the
alternative, rap, rock, or
reggae. The whole week
there were rumors of
MTV taping at both
clubs, but no one so
much as caught a
glimpse of a camera or a
V.].

For those of you
who sta ed in Oakland,

ou ha to see it to be-
ieve it. The tour had a
club that, if one closed
their eyes and retended
hard enough, t ey mi ht
think they were in J.
Barney's, exce t it was
right on the each in-
stead of on Forbes Ave.
Harpoon Harry's was a
down-to-earth, extreme-
I packed club with stu-
dents who were looking
for the same thing peo-
ple look for in C.].’s . . .
wings? Well, sort of.
There was free pizza and
drink for Panamaniac
Card-holders. Yeah,

 

yeah, that's what they
were looking for, I
swear.

All in all, the week
was a blast. The city pro-
vided a safe and enjoy-
able environment for all
700 students at the H01-
iday Inn. The week
ended as fast-paced as it
began. The mere word
vacation was too short.

Maybe that's wh
Spring Break tri s a-
ways seem to ﬂy y. All
250 Pitt students climbed
aboard the five motor
coaches, a little sun-
burned, yet safe, and a
little less-than-ready to
slowly crawl up that
northern route back to
the winter wonderland
of Oakland — back to
snow, work, class, and of
course, the responsibili-

ty.

  At the eighth Pitt Invitational, the men's
swimming and diving
team was the host with
the most. Swimming
without Aaron Fortner
for the weekend, Matt
Brady for two days and
head coach Chuck
Knoles- who all were at
the United States Swimming Open- Pitt breezed
past the competition.
W'e have so much depth
as a team. We have so
many talented swimmers, that we knew that
we would come out on
top," newly in-charge
assistant coach David
Amato said. "Our guys
really got up for this.
This is our pool. They
didn't want anyone to
beat them in our pool."
  Junior Gary Mule
started off the domination on the right foot
when he took first in the
1,650 freestyle and Sam
Dommel finished third.
Pitt proceeded to win the
800-relay freestyle and
the 200-relay freestyle.
  Pitt's David Williams
was involved in two of
the most exciting races of
the meet when he came
from behind to steal first
from fellow teammate
Sami Vartianen by.44 of
a second in the 200 freestyle. Williams also won
the 500 freestyle. Pitt
overpowered opponents
in the 100 freestyle. David Williams, Zach
Economos, and Sami
Vartianen finished one,
two, three respectively.
  Pitt's divers picked up
the onslaught where the
swimmers left off. Rookie John Soulakis, who
finished first in the onemeter diving, led the
team in winning, and
Jeremy McClean finished
second in the one-meter
diving.
  As if Pitt needed any
more momentum, Matt
Brady came back straight
from the U.S. Open and
made his presence felt
immediately.
  In his first race, Brady
won the 200 backstroke.
Then, he proceeded to
dominate the 200individual medley (IM)
winning by a comfortable three seconds. In
national competition,
Brady placed fourth in
the 200 IM, sixth in the
100 backstroke, eighth in
the 400 IM, and twelveth
in the 200 backstroke.
  The battle of speedthe 50 freestyle- was all
Pitt. Economos finished
first with Vartianen second and Williams fourth.
Sophomore Chris Perry
finished second in the
278      Sports
I I
100 backstroke and 400
IM, and Chris Balke finished second in the 100
backstroke. Pitt put the
exclamation point on the
meet in the final race.
Swimming the 400-relay
freestyle, Economos,
Vartianen, Williams, and
Brady breezed to the easiest victory of the meet,
winning by 3.2 seconds.
  The men's swimming
and diving team sent a
message to all of their
oppponents that they
were going to be number
one, and number one is
what they were in the
Big East. For the 11th
time in 12 years the Pitt
men's swimming and
diving team captured:he
Big East Championsip
which was held the ast
weekend in February
here at Pitt.
  The Panther's 1994 title was won in an impressive fashion: They
finished with 673 points,
73 points higher than
second place.
The diving team started
off the meet with a
boom, giving Pitt a 100
point cushion before the
swimmers even hopped
in the pool. Rookie John
Soulakis placed second
with Sean Braud right
behind him in third in
the three meter dive. On
the one meter board it
was more of the same.
Braud finished second
and Soulakis was third.
"Our diving was clearly
a big help,' head diving
coach Julian Krug said.
"We put the points on
the board in the beginning of the the meet and
we never trailed...."
  Now, it was up to the
swimmers to pick up
where the divers left off.
Matt Brady won the 400yard IM with a NCAA
consideration time. David Williams won the
200-yard Freestyle with
a NCAA consideration
time and also finished
second in the 100-yard
freestyle. Chris Perry
was involved in one of
the most exciting races
when he finished second
in the 200-yard breastroke.
  Congratulations Panther swimmers on your
Big East championship
and your spectacular
swimming and diving
season!

The women's gymnas-
tics team had a disappoint-
ing season that was
plagued by injuries to end
up the season with a record
of 3-17. However, the in-
dividual team members
were all gems with the dia-
mond in the rough being
Sophomore Brenda Ste-
vens.

Brenda Stevens had a
strong season and had per-
sonal high scores with a
9.65 on the balance beam
and 9.50 on the uneven
bars. In a11—around compe-
tition she posted a 37.925
which was enough to place
her on Pitt's all-time top
ten list. Stevens was also
the only one from her team
to go to both ECACS and
regionals and was named
to the Al1—Conference
team.

Thank You women's
gymnastics on the great
gymnastics moments
you've given us!

The Men's Basketball
team didn't fare so well
this year, losing its final
nine games after starti
13-5 enroute to a 13-1
record and no post-
season tournament. Pitt
which many thought
was on its way to an
NCAA tourney bid, lost
its head coach due to
contract difficulties.

tuc y was then hired to
replace Paul Evans.

In winning 13 games,
the Panthers won a pair
of tough road ames --
St. ]ohn’s and CAA en-
try Boston College —
and beat to ey team
Providence at home.
However, N rt 1 Caroli-
na, Seton Hall, and Con-
necticut all gave the Pan-
thers nationally-
televised home losses,
and aside from the oc-
casional Eric Moble
monster slam, not muc
happened on the hard-
wood. Mobley was the
only Panther on the Big
East post-season team
(he took t i d-team hon-
ors at cent )

Thank you men's bas-
ketball on some brilliant
basketball moments
through out the year!

PEDO 0185 lgasleetballl 1-00-81)

The Pitt women's bas-
ketball team compiled a
19-9 record with an ad-
ditional 2 wins and a loss
coming from post-season
play to finish their sea-
son at 21-10.

The Lady Panthers’
chase of the first NCAA
tournament bid in team
history did not come
down to the Big East
Tournament, where a
second-round loss to the
16th ranked Seton Hall
Pirates (25-4) left Pitt on
the bubble.

Small forward Jill Co-
labrese turned away and
her teammates watched
in disbelief as the final
bids were revealed and
Pitt was left out.

However, the Lady
Panthers awoke the next
day to bright sunshine as
they soon discovered
that they had been in-
vited to the National
Women's Invitational
Tournament in Amarillo,
Texas. The Lady Pan-
thers showed their
strength‘ and determina-
tion as they went on to
take third in the tourna-
ment. Thank You Lad
Panthers for our bri -
liant basketbal season!

The Flip Side

Spnivug Eneole in ﬂout Laudeﬁdale

Spring Break, it's the
time of year that thou-
sands of college kids
everywhere live for. If
you've ever gone any-
where fun for Spring
Break, you'll know why
this long-awaited holi-
day is planned some-
times months in advance
by anxious, stressed-out,
sick-to-death-of-school
college kids. It's the time
for sun, fun, friends, and
drainin the old bank ac-
count. ut it's worth it-
believe me!

I went to Panama City
Beach last ‘year with my
good frien s Gin, Evon,
and Monica. It was a
blast. But this year I de-
cided to do something
different. In January, my
friend Karen asked me if
I would want to o to
Fort Lauderdale wit her
and her roomie,
Michelle. I had been
planning a return tri to

anama City (since I ad
the time of my life), but I

thought, hey, this would
be cool! Fort Lauderdale,
way in the south, near
Miami and the Keys, it's
uaranteed to be hot,
ot, hot!! So the plans
were in motion.

I asked my friend Lisa
to go too, and of course
she said yes. Her sister
Jill also a eed. Besides,
it would e cheaper for
five of us to split costs
instead of four. So Lisa
made the hotel reserva-
tions at the Ramada on
the beach and Karen
rented a car for us to
drive down. Excellent!
Now all we had to do
was wait for March to ar-
rive.

Adrenaline was
um ing and excitement
illecll the air in the early

morning of March 4th.
We left on Friday
(skiplping classes!) so we
wou d be in Florida by
early Saturday. By 9:30

AM, we had the trunk
packed— in every sense of

the word. Hey, when
you got five girls .

hen we were on our
way, leaving behind a
foot of snow and 30 de-
gree weather.

We arrived in Florida
in the wee morning
hours, and stopped over-
night at a friend's who
said it would be okay for
us to crash. Then we
were on I-95 south to-
ward Lauderdale! We ar-
rived and checked into
the Ramada. This place is
so cool- nice rooms, bal-
conies, and a great pool
deck with a Tiki Bar right
next to the pool. Good
for us earl drinkers.
And every a they had
Ha py Hour rom 5 to 7
P with free food and 2-
for-1 drinks!

The beach was beau-
tiful, and the water was
absolutely breathtaking.
Ever see pictures of the
Caribbean? Well, Fort
Lauderdale’s shoreline is
pretty darn close. We

walked out into the wa-
ter up to our necks, and
we could still see our feet
when we looked down!
This was a first-time ex-
perience for me!

We also met dozens of
other college kids from
all over. We met people
from Notre Dame, Mich-
i an, New Jersey, Boston

., Penn State, Mary-
land, and peo le from
Pitt who we di ’t even
know! Talk about a small
world.

Aside from the daily
ritual of basking in the
sun until it went down at
night, Fort Lauderdale
really comes to life. This
is a bigger party town
than Pittsburgh could
ever dream of bein ! The
man clubs of ered
night y specials, and it
was Ladies’ Night some-
where every single night.

Fun in the Sun

Free drinks for us! Croc-
co’s, The Store, The
Edge, Yesterday's, and
the Baja Beach Club are
just a few. Our ersonal
favorite was t e Baja
Beach Club. This place
rocks! With six bars on
two levels and a kicking
dance floor fully ac-
comodated with a stage
for nightly lip-s c per-
formances, the aja was
the lace to be. I don't
thin any of us ever had
so much fun as we did
there . . . from what we
can remember!

We had planned on
road tripping down to
Key West, but we never
actually made it there.
Why spend an afternoon
in the car? That would
mean losing a da in the
glorious sun. An let me
tell you, the best tan I

ever got was right there.
We never saw anything
but sunshine during the
day, unlike Panama City,
where we heard that

chuckled as we soaked

We were very sad to
leave on Sunday the
13th. Yes, we stayed as
long as humanly ossi-
ble, milking that orida
sun for all it was worth,
since we already knew
that it was cold and rainy
back home. But we had
to leave, even though we
called home and said we
didn't want to.

 

So we started off on
the euling trip home,
whic took longer than
anticipated due to some
problems with the car.
But all that aside, it was
one of the best trips I
have ever taken in In
life, and I plan to go back
next year. Only this time
I'm going to ﬂy.

The Student Union

Well, let's see. I have
an hour between now
and my next class, so
what am I ever going to
do to kill some time.
”Ahh . . . Iknow. I'll just
bop on over to the Union
and see what's shakin’.”

There's a buzz of ac-
tivity on the front steps.
You know, all the Greeks
are hanging out chatting,
along with random stu-
dents sittin on the
benches talléing and
smoking. Let's take a
gander at what's goin
on downstairs. I wal
through the door .
wait something’s differ-
ent. This isn’t the
Schenley Cafe I remem-
ber. I see glass walls and
lots of neon. So this is
why this place was sec-
tioned off over the sum-
mer. It’s the new and im-
proved Schenley Cafe!

This new food haven

includes a mini version
of Pizza Hut for those
who don't feel like or-
dering from Domino's
(though the wait might
be as long), The Pitt
Stop, which has the
same burger menu from
the old Schenley, but it
also has an ala carte bar
with pasta and sauce,
baked potatoes and top-
pin s, and a different
daiy special. Try the
London Broil, I highly
recommend it. There's a
Manchu Wok, if you
have a hankering for
Chinese, and a sub shop
too.

Another new and in-
novative idea they came
up with was acce ting
not only Choice Do lars,
but between 4 and 7PM,
they take cash equiva-
lency, meaning you can
use your meal plan

equivalent up to $5.

Anything over that, sor-
ry, it comes out of your
own pocket.

After you eat and have
some time, head over to
the Recreation Room
(aka the Pool Room) and
shoot some stick. Or play
some video games if
you're in that mindset. If
not, you can relax in the
TV room and catch up on
your favorite soaps.

If you just want to take
a load off for a while,
there's always the Blue
and Red Rooms, with
their plush, comfy furni-
ture. You can study
(while trying to stay
awake) or nap for a spel .
These rooms are very
conducive to relaxation,
so check it out sometime.

The William Pitt Un-
ion also houses many
campus organizations,
including Student Gov-
ernment Board, The Pitt

News, the Counseling
Center, and yours truly,
Panther Prints.

Wherever in the Union
you decide to go, it's al-
ways a good lace to
stop in and chec out the
scene.

Parking in Oakland

ISSP 2170 Peammg, Ptobﬂem SOQUU/Lg, 8 Sedﬂﬂgt

There's nothing like driving
into Oakland and ﬁnding a
place to park the old ’mobile.

or Pitt commuters, it's a dai-
ly event looked at with much
chagrin.

Many a mom’ you can see
cars circling the blocks be-
tween Forbes and Fifth Av-
enues in search of that choice

arkin spot. Preferably in

ront o the Cathedral, where
you can park for up to four

ours at a time. Other meters
have two hour limits and are
difficult to et. Commuters
arrive aroun 8:00 AM to get
the spots by the Cathedral,
and by 9:00 AM, everything
else is retty much taken. Un-
less, ofp course, you can find a
place up near Chevron Sci-
ence Center.

There are alternative op-
tions, however. If you don't
want to chance leaving our
car unattended and vu ner-
able on the streets of Oak-
land, there is a parking garage
under the lawn of Soldiers
and Sailors Memorial and a
parkin lot across the way

rom illman Library. Rates
are reasonable, and your car
is safer, since there are usu-

Look! There's actually a few
spots left.

ally security attendants. For
an affordable price, you can
obtain a errnit to ark in the
Forbes Suadran l)e garage,
and the Panther I-lollow lot is
just a hop, skip, and a jump
from campus.

Be careful, though, if you
happen across a spot at a me-
ter on the street. Parking Pa-
trol Officers roaming Oakland
in search of ex ired meters
and illegally parked cars just
might s ap you with a ticket.
Fines have gone up and ex-
pired meters are $15 instead
of $5 as they were a few years
ago. Parking illegally, say on
Atwood Street, results in a
$25 ticket. For both tickets
you have 10 days to pa the

ittsburgh Citcy raffic Clourt.
It's a good i ea to pay the
ﬁne; otherwise, you can get

our car booted should ou

appen to get another tic et.
Then it not only costs you the

arking ticket, but an extra
£85 to get the boot removed.
Be a smart cookie and pay
that fine right away. Drop it
in the mail and be done with
it.

Wherever you choose to
park at Pitt, remember it isn't

always easy going. Hey, find-
ing a spot within your first
circle around the block is no
small feat. So to all ou com-
muters, I wish you t e best of
luck in your search.

When in doubt, there's al-
ways the Quad, if you can

Pitt Shuttles

/‘HDMJ 8245 TQJULOMSM

You've all seen them.
Most of you, myself in-
cluded, have probably
ridden them at some
point or another. And
isn't it such a joy trying
to figure out just exactly
when they're going to
show up? What are they,
you ask? Well, the Pitt
shuttles of course.

There has always been
campus transport via the
Campus Bus, which is
still in operation. How-
ever, with the erection of
Sutherland Hall, another
bus was necessary to ac-
commodate the extra
700+ students going up
and down the hill. Thus,
we have the Sutherland

Bus.

Then, Pitt decided to
make it convenient for
students living off-
camous to get to their
classes. With the intro-
duction of the North and
South Oakland shuttles,
plus one for Squirrel Hill
and one for Shadyside,
off-campus students no
longer have to weather
the elements as they at-
tempt to attend their
classes.

Pitt first introduced
these new shuttles two
years ago, as crime in the
Oakland area began to
increase at a frightening
rate. The buses are here
not only to transport stu-

dents from point A to
point B, but they also in-
sure students’ safe arriv-
al at their destinations.
The only problem this
past year was the
changes in schedule
times due to route
changes. The buses don't
follow the schedule that
we were used to. Now
we check the schedules
at the Union Information
Desk and hope that a bus
comes reasonably close
to what is printed . . . es-
pecially in bad weather,
which just about sums
up this entire year.
Though there have
been a plethora of com-
plaints from students liv-

ing up on the hill, the
shuttle system is one of
Pitt's better ideas. They
provide safety as well as
transportation for all stu-
dents who can produce a
university ID, and the
drivers are friendly for
the most part. They also
make living up on the
hill a lot less strenuous
on us.

So let's stop complain-
ing about erratic sched-
ules and the not-so-
punctual arrivals of the
buses and take advan-
tage of them. After all,
that's what we're paying
for.

that you've dialed wrong number, and instead of get-
ting Mom you got Billy-Io-Bob in Idaho.

hour later because you knew last night you weren't
going to make it to that Sam class anyway.

17. Watch Saturday morning cartoons. ,
18. Start studying for that test you have tomorrow.
19. Lie to your Mom when she calls you at 9am on

Holland Hall

CWO)\/WST OO:-20 Cl/\/Owtem (Mi Socjetg

Holland Hall, as most everyone knows, is an all female Residence Hall. Remember, all girls dorm is
not politically correct! Holland Hall is a great place to live. . . I have lived there for three years in a row
and will live there next year as well. Holland has a kitchen on every ﬂoor which comes with an oven
that can be used by everyone 24 hours a day. This is eat for the late night munchies. It is also nice to
know that the elevator stops on ever ﬂoor. Hollan ’s rooms are also much larger than those of the
other Residence Halls except for Sut erland (the are the same size). Holland, however, does have
some draw backs. It does not have central air con 'tioning nor does it have central heat. It has radiator
heat that never turns off in the winter. This means that it is hot all year long. This winter I slept with my
window 0 en four inches even-though the temperature was only twenty-five degrees! Although, I must
say that t e night in January when the temperature dipped to an all time low of -22 degrees with a
wind—chill factor less than of -60 degrees, I was nice and warm, but my windows were shut.

Be ond these pros and cons of the building are the real benefits of Holland. . . friendshi and female
bon 'ng. As the sixth ﬂoor of Holland wrote in their top ten reasons to live in Holland Ha , if you're in
a bad mood we'll just assume it's PMS and your really a nice Iperson and don't worry if you run out of
anlyi fernine products ou have 700 other women to borrow t em from!

olland Hall also ad a strong RSA (Resident Student Association) this ear. They came in third
place in the Lothrop Challenge which is a program where all Residence Halls com ete to collect the
most money for their favorite charity. This ear Holland's charity was the Make A ish Foundation,
but this was not all the RSA did for their c arity. Holland's RSA along with help from the Resident
Assistants of Holland sponsored their annual Haunted House. The Make A Wish Foundation was
invited to go through specially designed tours. After these tours had concluded, the Haunted House
was open to all Pitt students with a valid ID. The Haunted House stayed open past 11pm. All in all, over
750 students went through the Haunted House. Iust a hint though, come early because the line is pret
long and after 1 1pm no more tours are started, and some people unfortunately don't get to go throug
it.

Holland is a great lace to live, no doubt about it. The Resident Assistants and the Resident Director
made Holland the p ace to live with their innovative and fun programs.

The Towers

O€€j\lC\/8 Oomciete S’UuACtUvLeS I

The rooms are pie
shaped and small. The
elevators only stop on
every third ﬂoor, and it's
constantly noisy. Yes
folks, I'm talking about
Towers A, B, and C. If
you're claustrophobic,
you might want to con-
sider alternative housing.

There are some pluses,
however. The have the
luxury of a ca eteria right
downstairs, even if
everything is gravy cov-
ered so that you can't tell

what it is. There's also
Towers Express. It's a lit-
tle overpriced, but
that's why the

hey. . .

parents pay so much for
our choice dollars.

Being in the Towers is
also a great source of en-
tertainment. Just sitting
on a bench in the lobby
is a treat in itself. People
watching can be so much
fun, especially for upper-
classmen who like to
point out to their friends
who the freshmen are.
Of course, they're all
coming in and out of
Tower B, Freshman ha-
ven.

Another advantage to
living in the Towers is
the convenience of hav-
ing the mailroom right

there. So if you feel the
need to check our mail
10 times a day ( ike when
you're waiting for that
care package from
home), go right ahead.

Hey, the Towers aren't
all that bad. You get to
know your roornie really
well since you constantly
run into each other- lit-
erally. Also, ou get to
know your loormates
when you live so close to
each other.

The Towers are retty
convenient for fres men
in particular. Since
they're right smack in
the middle of campus,

they have a better
chance of learning their
way around quickly.
Plus, they can't miss
their building since they
all look like cleanser bot-
tles! So have fun, and en-
joy waiting for those el-
evators!

Over the past few years the University
of Pittsburgh computer labs have taken a
technological leap forward. The computers
are now easier to access, rocess infor-
mation faster, and have a vanced soft-
ware. The University has now implement-
ed the use of authorization codes and pass
words, which have made the use of start-
up disks obsolete.

Twenty-four hours a day, seven days a
week, students can use the computers. In
the past, students have waited u to two
hours for access to a com uter in t e lab. In
recent years the wait has een shortened, if
students even have to wait. This is no relief
to the procrastinator due to the delay from
the printing department!

A broad spectrum of software is avail-
able through the University of Pittsburgh's
com uter center. Students can either go to
the abs or have their comlputer connected
to tliie University system. he most widely

software is obviously the word processing packages. Since computers are the wave of the future,
students can now get tutoring in many areas, such as mathematics and biology, in the labs.

The Book Center is every student's
worst nightmare! Incoming freshman
cannot wait to get their hands on their
first semester's text books. Upper class-
man have a much different View of this
hellish experience.

Have you ever tried to figure out
when the book center would be the least
crowded? Maybe on a Saturday morn-
ing. Who is even awake at eight o'clock
on a Saturday morning. Well, if this idea
ever came to your mind, ou now know
that the entire campus igures that the
book center will be empty on Saturday
morning.

What do they mean by ”Required
Text?” Every semester students pur-
chase text books which are useless to
them. These texts are not returnable due
to the lable of ”Required Text.” Stu-
dents soon come to realize that required
textbooks are not always required b the
professor. Who are the infamous ”t ey”
who decide what textbooks are re-
quired? It’s a mystery.

At the end of each semester, everyone
desperately wants to rid themselves of

 

the rememberance of classes that had
torchered them all semester. The fastest
way to do this is to sell back your text-
books. This is not always the solution,
though. All of a sudden your seventy-
five dollar text book price has been
slashed. It is now worth twenty-three
dollars and ninety-five cents. What a
sale!! Deduct a bit more if you are 21
hi hlighting freak.
he book center accepts major credit
cards. While your waiting in line for an
hour, you might want to pick up a nov-
el, calander, or even the most popular
M.C. Esher poster. Ever thing you
could possibly want or nee is in stock.
Security at the book center is excel-
lent! There are lockers which will hold
your belongings while you shop. This is
a great idea unless your belongings do
not quite fit. And remember: Do not
loose the key while ou brouse! This can
be a big hassle. To t e commuters, these
free lockers are only for book center
customers.

University Honors College (UHC) courses are
designed to challenge and stimulate academ-
ically motivated students. The courses in the
College are offered to a select number of people,

a promoting intense interaction between faculty

and students. Due to the small size of these
classes, college students are required to have a
minimum QPA of a 3.25 in order to enrole in the
College. Incoming freshman are required to have
an SAT score of 1200 and to have been in the top
ten percent of their highschool class. If a student
is motivated and does not fill this requirement,
he /she can seek; special epermissiont through the
UHC advisors.

(continued on next page.)

Courses offered by the UHC include Human-
ities, Social Science, and Natural Sciences. Many
of the courses combine an extra UHC recitation
with the course. Others are strictly UHC courses.

Many special priviledges are available for
these students. Among these options are in-
dividualized academic advising, the academic
community of the Honors Center, scholarships
and awards. UHC students are also encouraged
to take graduate courses which can earn credit
toward their undergraduate degree. This fine
program has been an important part of many
motivated, intelligent, and enthusiastic students
for many years.

very two seconds a crime is committed on
campuses across the nation according to the
FBI Uniform Crime Report. Students at the
University of Pittsburgh know all about
crime. Through the ears we have heard
about ﬂashers in the li rary, rape on campus,
and drive b shootings on Forbes Avenue.
With all of t ‘s crime, students need to learn
a new type of academics, personal defense.

Mr.Curtis Smith, a University olice officer
and martial arts instructor, of ers a course
which teaches people how to avoid incidents
before the occur. Mr. Curtis Smith calls this
method ” uy Yourself A Minute” (BYAM).
BYAM represents the small amount of time
that a person needs to analyze situations by
being alert and aware of their environment.

Personal Defense is offered every spring
and fall term. This course is designed to make
students realize their comfortability levels, to
teach students what to watch for in common
situations, and also to prepare themselves for
attack. This hands—on course combines men-
tal technique with 100% physical power.
When a person is being attacked, they may
only have one chance to get away, so they
better give it their best shot.
(continued on next page)

Rape, car theft, sexual assault, and phys-
ical assault are onl a few of the topics cov-
ered throughout t e semester. Other topics
include the use of civilian chemical aerosol
containing Oleoresin Capsicum which causes
an inflamatory response in mucus mem—
branes. This response is involuntary and
works well on assailants who are on drugs.

Mr. Curtis Smith prepares his class for a
hands-on final examination which occurs on
the streets of Oakland. Students walk the
streets not knowing what may occur. If you
have learned the BYAM method well, you
will be safe, if not watch out!

Finals are stress ul. At the end of the
year, it's no time to procrastinate because
there's not any time left. Even if you
haven't procrastinated all year (yes, there
are a few who haven’t!), there are still
lines everywhere. Try finishing that 30

jammed packed, and on top of that the
printer breaks! The blood pressure cer-

are, owever, ways to prevent or to re-

duce this stress. Pitt offers many courses
on stress management, and Student

Studying what can I say about studying? For some it's rough,
tedious, and unbareable. For others, it's easy and not so bad
and maybe even en'oyable.

I know; I know. ou think I must be joking. Some eople
really don't mind stud ing, and I'm one of them. My E-iend,
however, isn't. We're 1i e night and da when it comes to this.
She, who ‘ou all know as the Editor 0 this book, is allergic to
studying. t makes her upset and anxious. She's a true pro-
crastinator. But this probably isn't a surprise to any of fyou
because you're most likely just like her. Do you do some 0 the
things she does?

1. Wait until a night or two before the test to read the
textbook for the first time.

2. Never finish reading the assigned chapters because there's
too much.

3. Talk to others on the phone all night before the big test.

4. Fall asleep reading.

5. Find something e se to do like clean your room.

6. Go to the library with friends to study but wind up talking
to them all night.

7. Wing it. You went to a few classes!

8. Answer the door to everyone who knocks and invite them
in 9fo1{A:;1 fer hours. d b f d

Well if you do any of these, you are seriously oing to not do
good on our tests unless you're psychic an know all the
answers! don't understand why she can't sit still for an hour
or so and study every night. She, on the other hand, cannot see
how I can sit down and ignore everything else to study!

I guess you've got to do what you've got to do.

Wednesday, January 19, 1994 at one o’clock
Chancellor J. Dennis 0’Conner decided to close the
University to help conserve energy. The frigid tem-
perature of 22 degrees below 0 drained the state of
most of its energy causing an emergency power
shortage. This was a record breaking low.

Some students went to class that morning. Many
stayed inside and enjoyed their day off. Anyone who
ventured outdoors were bundled up in layers upon
layers of clothing. in this weather clothing did not
keep students warm.

Wednesday night 0’Conner cancelled class for
Thursday, January 20, 1994 although meteorolo-
gists said that the temperature was rising. Three
cheers for O'Connor!

All government offices were closed also. Tele-
vision stations across the state were requesting that
households use the least amount of electricity pos-
sible.

Many students and faculty feel that it was highly

irresponsible of Pitt not to be closed earlier. How-
ever, this isn’t the first time this has happened. Pitt
has only been closed four times in the past 21 years!
Three of these times came this year. Two came on
Jan. 19 & 2.0, and the other came a few weeks later.
The other one came last year during the March
Blizzard of 1993. Pitt only then gave students off
one day, Mar. 15. Many students had no way to
travel back to Pitt because they were away on Spring
Break. Cities and all transportation on the East
Coast were shut down, even the Turnpike. 250 Pitt
students who were on the PPC trip to Panama City
were stranded, and didn’t get back until Mar. 17.
Well, here’s to better winter weather next year!

The University library s stem is large and
complex for many stu ents. Information
about Pitt's eighteen libraries is contained
within PITT CAT. Hillman librar is the main
libra on the Pitt cam us. Ot ers include
Lang ey Library, Frick Fine Arts Libra , the
Ph sics library, Chemistry Librar in A umni

Ha I, the Music Library, the Me ‘cal Library
in Scaife Hall, just to name a few (yes, there
are more!). These libraries contain everything
from leisure reading to research and refer-
ence books.

Unfortunately, many students forget that
there are libraries other than Pitt's own. The
Carnegie Library and Museum are just a hop,
skip, and jump awa . Many students never
even use this won erful resource of infor-
mation.

Hillman library can become confusin for
the any student in search of a book. Stac s of
books from the floor to the ceiling on four
different ﬂoors can be confusing to anyone.
The information desk comes in quite handy
at these times.

from the floor to the ceiling on four different
ﬂoors can be confusing to anyone. The infor-

There are many places for students to sit in
total silence. The ground floor, however, is not
one of these places. Group study sessions and
people waiting for their friends occupy this area.
When the wait for friends becomes a hinder-
ance, just write a huge note to your friend and
put it on the front door. They might see it!

A1l—in—a11 Pitt has an excellent library with
hundreds of thousands of books and periodicals,
and if you know the Dewey Decimal System and
how to use PITT CAT it's even better.

Cheating certainly is artiﬁcial intelligence. Many
students at the Universigr reall do study a feel no
need to at cheat. Others on’t c eat because they're
afraid of being caught and the consequences that fol-
low. However, there are students who aren't afraid to
cheat and figure why study. J J
Man professors try to combat cheating by various
metho s. You know them. . .seatin two seats apart,
different tests, no baseball caps, boo s on the ﬂoor, no
talking, roaming,TAs, and so on. All of these help to
minimize cheating, but they certainly don't stop it. As

Here at Pitt many students have come up with in-
novative ways to cheat. ”Once I wrote on my thighs and
wore a miniskirt,” a Pitt junior said. ”I ﬁgured that if the
teacher or proctor saw me, he would be too embarrassed

to ask me to lift my skirt to prove that I actually had
something written on my legs. If he did ask, I would just
refuse. It worked!”

This is just one example of many of the creative stories
students told about cheating. During follow-up inter-
views of the cheating surveys conducted by a Pitt jour-
nalism class, students and professors explained what they
have seen and actually done. J J

A CAS senior explained another technique of cheating.
”My roommates and a few of their friends all had the
same class, but never went to it.... So they paid someone
to go to the first testing of the final—there were three times
you could take it-and steal a copy for them. The kid they
hired took the test using a fake name and social security
number. He then brought a copy back with him, they
figured out all the answers and proceeded to take the
exam the next day without any problems.”

Not only have students paid people to get exams for
them, but they have brought in exams from previous
semesters while taking a test. s i J i

There are many reasons and many ways to cheat at

long as there's a will there's a way, so students come

up with new and improved ways to cheat everyday.
(see article that follows.)

Here at Pitt the consequences of cheating are largely

up to the professor. For the most part, professors fall
the cheater for the test and sometimes for the course as

well. Don't do it. You're only hurting yourself, and the

price is too high.

«Lane Hornfeck

Pitt. Michelle, a CAS sophomore, cheated because she

had a class that she didn't want to take but had to. So she.

stole a test copy when she went in to speak with the
professor.

An elaborate case of cheating was described by an

assistant professor in CA8. Julie calledthe teacher and:

said she didn't get a grade on her test. Julie asked Sara, a
student in her class, to see her test. Julie then erased

Sara's name and replaced it with her own and turned this ;
into the professor. The professor gave Julie the J grade ~

which was actually Sara's grade, and didn't realize this
wasn't Julie's test. Julie then erased her name and put

Sara's back on the test. It was questioned when Sara saw 

that her name wasn't written in her own handwriting.
She told the professor, and Julie was asked to bring in the
original copy of her test. She had gotten a blank test,

ﬁlled in the the answers and marked it with different :

colored pens because she knew the TA's marked tests this
way. When the rofessor showed the test to the TA's,

they all said the andwriting was not theirs. Julie didn't .
actually admit to doing all this, but she did sign a paper 

that said shelwould fail the class. Well, there you have
it. . .Pitt’s 101 course in cheating.

-Tawnya Adams

  

More than 81% of Pitt undergrads surveyed said they have
witnessed cheating; and 53% have personally cheated. The
survey, conducted y a Pitt News aper I journalism class, was
distributed to 300 students from a 1 schools and class levels.
Students said they saw cheating on in~class uizzes, tests,
and ﬁnal exams. Respondents said they were a so aware of
other students bu in or reusing papers, copying homework,
and plagiarizing. tu ents said parental and competitive res-
sure contributed to their cheating; 66°/o said they consi er it
eas to cheat at Pitt. l l
espondents disagreed about whether or not certain cam-
pus organizations and athletic teams have an unfair advantage

on exams and classwork. One student said that fraternities and .

sororities help each other, and athletes are only here to play.
Several students mentioned files containing old exams and
papers kept by fraternities and sororities. Others said felt tutors
gave athletes help unavailable to other students. 7 in

Large classrooms and lecture halls, which can seat up to 400 so

students, are a factor behind cheating, according to the survey.
The class also distributed surveys to apiproximately 1,000 fac-
ulty members; 65 professors respon ed. Those professors

agreed that large classrooms facilitate cheating; 43 rnentioned 5

this as a factor that made cheating more likely. Faculty also
noted that overcrowded small classrooms make it difficultto
prevent cheating- One CAS professor said he dis airswhen
teaching a class of 100 or more in small lecture hal s. ”There’s

no way I can separate them sufficiently,” the professor said. 

”Even if [students] have no intention, it's very difficult not to

see papers of others....’’ Other professors mentioned careless 
proctoring or test preparation as factors. Most agreed that .

certain types of exams, particularly multiple choice and scan-

tron, make cheating easier. Three faculty members cited in- .

structors’ attitudes as an inﬂuence in cheating. Thirty—five
respondents said they had witnessed cheating during

through an academic integrity hearing.

It's no wonder faculty don't report cheating. Many have been
the ones put on trial at academic hearings not t e cheaters.
There's a growing number who are reluctant to spend time

pursuing a cheater in a system which many feel too often L

results in little or no action.

Each colle e or school has its own academic integrity board
and its own earin s. The interim dean of CGS said t at one
academic integrity Elvearing is held about every two years at
CGS. Whereas, the associate dean of CAS who is the academic
integrity officer said CAS has about two cases each semester.

Pitt's system is designed to encourage professors to deal with
cheatin on their own, using the hearing process as a last
resort. itt’ s ”Guidelines on Academic Integrity" state that the
gineral intent is to resolve cheating issues at the lowest level.

e guidelines suggest that a professor first attempt to make an it

a written

the accused accept a speciﬁc resolution and si
procedure

agreement to that effect. Many facul find tlus

inadequate. Many students simply wit draw from the class

before they fail it, and others refuse to sign the statement. With

all of this and the difficulty to dprove someone of cheating, it’ s i
o it. i

no wonder so many students

and the Seniors of the Year
were announced. This year
there were several candi-
dates for this honor,
amongst them was Panther
Prints’ own Lane

they picked two. Congrat-

The International Studies program here at Pitt
offers students a chance to ”see" the world. The
International Studies Department is comprised
of the Study Abroad program, Semester at Sea,
Asian Studies, International Security Studies,

Latin American Studies, Pennsylvania Ethnic S

Heritage Studies Center, Russian and East Eu-
ropean Studies, and West European Studies.
Hew, what a list!

International Studies hopes to teach students

the history, customs, and-contemporary public ,

and international policies of the region they
study. Therefore, students get to see and ex-
perience a whole new way of life without leav-
ing the campus.

However, International Studies goes beyond
the textbook. They take students to these coun-
tries by such programs as Study Abroad and
Semester at Sea.

Semester at Sea is a highly regarded program i

here at Pitt. One of there slogans is ”The World
is Your Classroom”! Semester at Sea is held
aboard the S.S. Universe, which carries about
500 college students around the world in 100
days. The program is expensive, about $10,000)
compared toregular tuition, $4,500. However,
the cruise is a bargain because no other ship will
take you around the world in 100 days for any-
where near this price. Moreover, you get college

credit too! Most of the courses on the ship are the A

primary undergraduate courses which are
geared to expanding a student's liberal arts cur-
riculum.

The International Studies program takes you
out of the Pittsburgh concrete jungle and shows
you the world!
