MESSAGE

from the Chancellor

Congratulations on your graduation from the
University of Pittsburgh! Your Student Government
Board and the Office of the Chancellor have
partnered to produce Panther Prints, a keepsake

of impressions for the Class of 2010. This collection

of essays and photos by your fellow students will
keep memories of your Pitt experiences alive for
years to come.

As you look to the future, remember you are
entering a world that needs the knowledge,
talents, and skills you developed at the University
of Pittsburgh. Your formal credentials will attest
to some of your achievements. But many of the
truly significant talents you nurtured here will

not be apparent from your transcript: the ability
to analyze problems and think critically, to gather
and synthesize information using an array of tools,
to work in teams, to “walk in another’s shoes,”
and to continue to learn and to grow—every day
in every way. These lasting benefits of your Pitt
education will remain with you throughout your
life and will pay lasting dividends, both to you

and to society.

As you meet new challenges and pursue new
opportunities, please remember that you always
will be a part of the University of Pittsburgh. Our
extended family of former students—Pitt alumni
——can be found throughout the United States and
around the globe. We invite you to stay connected
and continue to be involved in your University by
participating in Pitt alumni programs and events.

UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH 2010 1

It is rewarding and fun, and it is one of the best
ways to continue building the talents and skills
that are the product of your Pitt education.

Your alma mater forever will be a part of your life,
and we hope you will join us as we build further
on the proud legacy that belongs to the University
of Pittsburgh—and to you. Best of luck in all

that you do, and hail to Pitt!

Mark A. Nordenberg

It's almost hard to believe thatjust four
years ago, the same confident seniors

If we have anything to learn from our
graduating seniors—besides where

the best place to go is when you're craving
pizza at 3 a.m.—it’s how valuable these
four years at the University of Pittsburgh
are and how, like most good things,

they go by way too quickly.

Let this book be a memento of your
experiences at the University of Pittsburgh,
of all the wonderful things you learned,

of all the amazing people you met, and

of the fantastic opportunities provided

to you by being a Pitt alumnus.

Good luck, 2010 graduates! Like the

CENTURIES OF EXCELLENCE

History of Pitt

Celebrating its 223rd birthday in 2010, the
University of Pittsburgh sits as one of the oldest
institutions of higher education in the United
States. in those years, the University and its
graduates have received countless awards and
honors, each one a testament to an enduring
standard of excellence fostered more than

two centuries ago.

Founded by Hugh Henry Brackenridge in 1787
as the Pittsburgh Academy, Pitt began in a
modest log cabin. Over the years, it went through
name and location changes to accommodate

its growing student body. The final move
occurred in 1908, when the cornerstone of

the first University of Pittsburgh building was
laid in Oakland.

 

Pitt has graduated some of the most notable
members of our society, many of whom have
distinguished themselves in academia,

the arts, sports, and politics. Among this

crowd of extraordinary alumni are Academy
Award—winning entertainer Gene Kelly; Pulitzer
Prize—winning novelist Michael Chabon; and
Roscoe Robinson Jr., the first African American
four-star general in the U.S. Army. Their efforts,
combined with those of countless others
dedicated to their craft, have forged a reputation
of excellence among those who hold a University
of Pittsburgh diploma.

The City Is Our Campus

University of Pittsburgh students often don't
know where the University ends and the city
of Pittsburgh begins. With so many wonderful
things to do and see on and off campus,
many students find themselves raving about
Pittsburgh the same way they rave about

the University.

There's something for every interest in
Pittsburgh—everything from sports to politics
in a variety of venues. Mellon Arena is known
for hosting both sports and cultural events.
Because it's only a short bus ride from campus,
many Pitt students go there to attend hockey
games, concerts, and even speeches by such
notables as Vice President Joe Biden and

First Lady Michelle Obama.

The William Pitt Union is the
center of student life on campus.

AN ALL-PURPOSE PLACE

Once known to Pittsburgh residents as the
Schenley Hotel, the William Pitt Union has been
a fixture in the Oakland area since its opening.
In 1956, the University of Pittsburgh bought
the building, and following a major renovation
in 1980, the union became a premier spot for
student activities on campus.

The building houses an array of comforts and
services for students. There are meeting rooms
for student gatherings, offices for student
organizations, and decorated dining rooms for
formal events. The lower level houses a
student eatery plus the famous campus lounge,
Nordy’s Place.

On the second floor of the building is the Career
Development Office, where coordinators and highly
trained counselors help students to plan for life
after college. At the ticket office on the main floor,
students can pick up tickets for events in and
around the area, some for a discount and some
even for free.

The William Pitt Union provides an ideal balance
of hospitality and functionality, giving students
the perfect environment to congregate and share
as a collective body.

The University of Pittsburgh is known for
academic achievement, but don't expect only
to find students in Hillman Library, hunched
over textbooks and computers. There are many
spots around campus where students go to
socialize, relax, and study.

Oakland’s beautiful lawns attract many
students. It’s not out of the ordinary to see

a quick game of football being played on the
front lawn of Soldiers and Sailors Military
Museum and Memorial, a group of students
relaxing on the lawn of the Cathedral of Learning,
or someone taking a quick nap under the sun
between classes in Schenley Plaza.

When students need a change of scenery and
lots of caffeine, whether they’re organizing

a study group orjust catching up with friends,
they can take their pick of some of Oakland’s
coffee shops, many of which are student
favorites, including Starbucks and Caribou
Coffee on Forbes Avenue and Starbucks on
South Craig Street.

With so many Pitt students to call regulars,
these places are bona fide student landmarks.

Student Volunteer Outreach

 The Student Volunteer Outreach (SVO) begins
each academic year with a volunteer fair that
hosts different organizations trying to recruit
new members for their community service efforts.
As the year progresses, SVO sponsors annual
events like blood drives; Pitt Partnership for
Food, which has students collecting food for local
food banks; and Pitt Project Oakland, an event
that gets students up early on a Saturday morning
to clean the streets around campus.

Alternative Break is a major SVO program.
Students who sign up dedicate the week of their
spring vacation to participating in various
community service projects across the United
States. There’s also the America Reads Challenge

 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
  

@ Pitt and Jumpstart Pittsburgh, programs aimed
at providing children in preschool, kindergarten,
and elementary school with the literacy skills
they need to succeed.

By having SVO offer them the tools they need
to better their communities and the lives of
others, students learn the true value of lending
a helping hand while earning a sense of pride
that can come only from dedicating their time
to a good cause.

SCHOOL SPIRIT

Band and Cheerleaders

An essential part of any Pitt football game

is the spirit and excitement that fill the air.
The Pitt marching band and cheerleaders are
responsible for much of that, pumping up the
crowd with every cheer and song.

With nine instrumental sections, a color guard,
the Golden Girls baton twirlers, and a drum line,
the University of Pittsburgh Varsity Marching Band
steps onto the field during halftime to perform
the famous Pitt fight song, and Pitt students
can't help but cheer them on and sing along.
Band Director Jack R. Anderson works in
conjunction with Drum Major Tyler McGaughey

 

to create the sights and sounds students love.
The Pitt cheerleaders, a vital part of every football
game, have been recognized nationally for their
impressive routines. A dedicated group of students
works under the instruction of Theresa Nuzzo to
keep spirits high at every game.

An invaluable asset to Pitt athletics, the marching
band and cheerleaders keep Panther pride flowing

MOVING ON UP

Apartment Living

The University of Pittsburgh does a good job

of making students comfortable in on—campus
housing, but byjunior or senior year, most
students are itching to make shower shoes and
floor meetings things of the past.

Though looking for one’s own place can be

very exciting, it also can be quite stressful.

Pitt’s Off—Campus Living office alleviates some
of that stress by providing apartment listings,
roommate matching services, and sublet
services. Even after students have signed a
lease, Off—Campus Living continues to offer aid
with other issues that may arise, including giving
advice on dealing with landlords and helping
students to sublet their apartments.

Although living off campus can be a lot of fun,
students must approach this transition
responsibly. Most students go from their parents’
house to the dorms, and this is the first time

they have to pay their own bills, furnish their own
rooms, and live with other people without the
buffer of a resident assistant or parent, making
this step even more crucial.

Ultimately, moving off campus is part of the

natural progression in gaining independence,
maturity, and life experience——which is what
college is all about.

TRAINING FOR SUCCESS

Internships

Earning a high GPA and participating in
extracurricular activities are all indicators of
intelligence, but when it comes to getting a job,
experience is just as important as raw intellect.
Luckily, Pitt students have no problems shining
in the work environment, because many of them
have already spent time in an internship.

The city of Pittsburgh has many opportunities
for garnering an interesting internship. Students
can find positions in a variety of fields and
locations, including radio stations, political
offices, and nonprofit organizations.

There also are many internship opportunities
available through the University. By visiting their
school's Web site, students can find listings

for internships in a wide range of fields. One of
the more popular programs, the Institute of
Politics Internship Program, gives undergraduates
interested in politics the opportunity to intern
with elected officials at the local, state, and
federal levels.

With so many options and resources for finding
internships, Pitt students have a head start when
it's time to jump into the real job market.

MAKING DISCOVERIES

Student Research

Student learning at the University of Pittsburgh
isn't always confined to the classroom.

The Office of Experiential Learning, located in
B-4 Thaw Hall, is a fantastic resource for students
wanting to pursue experiences in research.
Students are given opportunities to intern or
conduct supervised research in a field of their
choice and even showcase their findings at the
annual Springboard to Insight and Discovery event,
hosted every April by the University. There,
undergraduates get to show off their newly
acquired knowledge and the results of their
research projects.

Those wishing to expand their research skills even
more can look into University fellowships. The
Chancellor's Undergraduate Research Fellowship

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  

72

is one of the more competitive; only 10 students
are chosen each term to participate. Students
also can apply for the Brackenridge Undergraduate
Fellowship. Those chosen receive a stipend

of $3,500 to conduct independent research
projects over the summer.

Whether students’ interests lie in biology, history,
art, or something else, Pitt's experiential learning
and research programs are perfect for those who
need a more hands—on approach to education.

floor of the William Pitt Union since 2007. Geared
toward fostering cultural awareness among
students, CCLD has been especially appreciated

by the student organizations whose offices it hosts.

With a new and comfortable meeting place,
CCLD students find it easy to come together for

meaningful dialogue and exciting interactive events.

CCLD also offers leadership development services
to more than 20 different student organizations,
including graduate student groups. The office
works closely with each, helping students to put
together campuswide events, workshops, and
guest speakers. In November 2009, CCLD brought

with the Saudi Students House in Pittsburgh to
organize the annual Saudi Open House, an exhibition
of Saudi Arabian art, customs, and traditions.

As shown by its efforts, CCLD exists to combat
cultural ignorance and help students gain a sense
of appreciation for both their own culture and
the cultures of their peers.

HIGH HONORS
Scholarship

While University of Pittsburgh students regularly
excel in the classroom, they are increasingly
gaining recognition at the University, state, and
national level.

Students doing independent research under

the guidance of a faculty mentor can apply for the

Chancellor’s Undergraduate Research Fellowship,
which gives participants a stipend for furthering
their research projects in their chosen field.

The Chancellor's Undergraduate Teaching Fellow-
ship requires a collaborative project between the
selected student and a faculty member.

This kind of firsthand research experience is
invaluable to students looking not only to
professionalize their research, but also to

 

apply for major national scholarships, such as the
Barry M. Goldwater Scholarship. In 2009, Pitt
students Elizabeth Oczypok and Andrew Savinov
received this prestigious award for their
independent research in the natural sciences.

Known for demonstrating excellence in a variety
of fields, Pitt students have been awarded many
revered scholarships over the years, including
the Rhodes, Marshall, and Harry S. Truman
scholarships.

With the amazing academic resources and
support the University of Pittsburgh provides for
its students, it's no wonder that they continue
to exemplify excellence in every field of study.

TOUCHDOWN!
Football

By starting off their 121st season with three
consecutive wins for the first time since 2000,
the Pitt Panthers showed their fans that they
were headed for success in 2009.

With the support and dynamic direction of Head
Coach Dave Wannstedt and Assistant Head
Coach Greg Gattuso, the Pitt Panthers have
become increasingly more competitive and
stronger on the field. Their determination and
skill led to their Brut Sun Bowl appearance in

2008, which was their first bowl appearance since
2004. As senior players like quarterback Bill Stull,
wide receiver Greg Cross, and linebackers Adam
Gunn and Shane Murray got more confident in their
roles on the field, they became inspirations for
talented freshman players like Fernando Diaz and
Tyrone Ezell.

With hordes of students flocking to support the
Pitt Panthers at every game and proudly sporting
their Pitt gear, this fantastic Pitt team continues
to overcome the obstacles that come their way,
thrilling their fans in the process.

Volleyball

Between 1988 and 1994, the University of
Pittsburgh women's volleyball team won the Big
East title an amazing seven times in a row in
addition to four other times in the years before
and after.

Off the court, the team ranked high in academic
achievement -as well. The American Volleyball
Coaches Association (AVCA) honored Pitt’s
volleyball team by naming it an AVCA Team
Academic Award recipient in 2009.

Under the guidance of four fantastic coaches,
this Panther volleyball squad continues to develop
and reach new levels of success.

For the 2009 season, the team was ready to
regain that energy and success and started

off well with wins against Belmont, Wichita State,
Kent State, and Robert Morris universities early
on. Senior Michelle Rossi was named MVP of
the Blue and Gold Tournament, and fellow team
member Meagan Dooley was named Big East

It certainly seems that the University of Pittsburgh

are most comfortable in the pool. The teams

ultimately call the pool in Trees Hall home.
Sometimes called the most popular pool in the
Big East, it's used for many tournaments and
events throughout the year.

Many swim team members recently took their
talents outside the Trees Hall pool, though,
including Laura Barnes and Tamara Lelli, who both
placed in the 2009 Canadian World Championship
Trials, and Alex Volovetski, who, as the only
diver representing the Big East, placed in the

GRACE IN MOTION

Gymnastics

With three members’ having competed in the
2009 NCAA Northeast Regional championships
in Tuscaloosa, Ala., the members of the University
of Pittsburgh women’s gymnastics team have
proved that they have as much grit as they

do grace.

Alicia Talucci and cocaptain Dani Bryan tied

for 18th place on the vault, while cocaptain Alix
Croop took fifth place after registering an impres-
sive 9.85 on the balance beam. Croop dazzled
again later in the year when she, along with five
other Pitt gymnasts, received special honors for
having a GPA higher than 3.5, earning a spot on
the National Association of Collegiate Gymnastics

Coaches/Women’s 2009 Scholastic Al|—America
team. The entire squad was recognized for placing
among the top 50 for a team GPA of 3.0 or higher.

With a succession of successful seasons under
their belts; a recently renovated gymnastics
training facility in Trees Hall at their disposal;
and the support of their veteran head coach,
Debbie Yohman, these gymnasts were poised
for victory in 2009-10.

GETTING IN THE GAME

Club Sports

Even if you don't have any interest in basketball
or football or if you’re not particularly passionate
about soccer or volleyball, it doesn’t mean you
can’t play a sport at the University of Pittsburgh.

By simply attending the annual Student
Activities Fair, potential players get to choose
from a multitude of club sports options. For
water lovers, there’s water polo and crew. For
those who like to play outside but on land,
there’s lacrosse, ultimate Frisbee, rugby, and
field hockey. And for those who like to work up
a sweat indoors, there’s bowling, squash, and
indoor track.

  
 
 

Students stay in charge of their schedules by
joining a club sport. They can participate in
as many clubs as they can pencil in during
the week.

Meeting new people with similar interests and
staying active and involved in campus

activities is as easy as participating in a club
sport for some students—and they have the
added bonus of staying nice and trim during the

A FIT STUDENT BODY

Fitness and Recreation

Pitt students could never be accused of being
lazy—trekking up and down Oak|and’s steep hills
takes a certain level of athleticism—but with such
a wide variety of great restaurants on campus,

it can be difficult to stay in shape. Luckily, the
University of Pittsburgh has many fun ways for
students to get the exercise they need to avoid
packing on unwanted pounds.

At the Petersen Events Center, students can take
advantage of the Baierl Student Recreation
Center, which is equipped with a state-of-the—art
aerobics area that has treadmills, exercise bikes,
and stair—climbers. For more sports—re|ated
exercise, students can go to Trees Hall to play

racquetball or handball, lift weights, or practice
martial arts. The facility also has a gymnastics
area and dance studio, five basketball and
volleyball courts, and a rock—climbing wall.

Students looking for a more structured approach
can meet with a fitness center staff member
to devise a specialized exercise and nutrition
regimen tailored to their needs.

With so many outlets to be active, it's no wonder
students have no trouble staying fit at Pitt.

SHINY AND NEW

The University of Pittsburgh is known for its
dedication to providing students with the best
resources and access to well—equipped facilities
for all their academic and extracurricular needs.

To give student organizations an area in which

to meet and plan events, the University renovated
the William Pitt Union’s fifth floor in 2009 to add
more meeting rooms, a lounge space, a dance
studio, and Wii equipment for some between-work
fun. There’s also a whiteboard wall where students
can advertise information about their clubs or
display their drawing skills.

PITT EATS
Taste of Pitt

Pizza may be a universal college favorite, but Pitt
students like a little variety, and they definitely
get it in Oakland.

On Forbes Avenue, students can try a new flavor
of wings at Quaker Steak & Lube or visit Veracruz
Restaurant, which offers a delicious array of
Mexican dishes. A quick walk to South Craig
Street gives students even more choices.

The Italian spot Lucca Ristorante is perfect

for a dressy dinner outing, and Lu Lu’s Noodles
is always a favorite for Asian dishes.

Consistently a Pitt favorite,

Primanti Bros. is known
for serving some of the
city’s best sandwiches.

 

For lunch or an early dinner, students can pick up
a burger from Five Guys Burgers and Fries or a
burrito from Chipotle Mexican Grill. Afterward,
they can swing by Dave & Andy’s for some
homemade ice cream. Several local restaurants
have late-night specials for students on tight
budgets, including Fuel & Fuddle, Joe Mama’s
Italian Deluxe, and Hemingway's Cafe.

Whether they are looking to dine out at a new
restaurant or just grab something quick between
classes, Pitt students never get bored with
Oakland's fantastic cuisine options.

' The Pittsburgh Ski and
Snowboard Club makes
- the most of the snow with
some fun outdoor events.

ALL BUNDLED UP

Winter at Pitt

The city of Pittsburgh has a lot of things to offer
Pitt students, but a mild winter isn't one of them.
The harsh winds and frigid temperatures can be
intimidating, but with all the activities organized
specifically to make the most of the winter cold,
Pitt ensures that students’ social lives don’t drop
with the temperature.

For one, the winter months are among the best
for sports fans. Football, hockey, and basketball
games draw students in droves to the William Pitt
Union, where they can shed their protective
winter gear, warm up with hot chocolate, and
cheer on their favorite teams at Nordy’s Place.

116

 

Those who scoff in the face of cold can be found
in Schenley Park, having snowball fights or at
the Schenley Park Skating Rink. Sledding down
“Cardiac Hill” or going on trips with the Pittsburgh
Ski and Snowboard Club are other perks to
Pittsburgh winters.

Pitt students never take for granted the fun
opportunities available to them by going to school
in Pittsburgh, even when the temperature is
below freezing.

Olivia Garber

Far left: Despite the blister-
ing cold, Pittsburgh ’s winter
months are some of the
most popular among Pitt
students. Playing in the
snow and celebrating the
holidays are some favorite
winter pastimes.

Left: The Nationality Rooms
in the Cathedral of
Learning are decorated

to represent that

culture's winter traditions.

Students enjoy the snowy scenery o
Pitt’s campus on their way to class.

Christmas tree in Scheney Park is a
great way to take advantage of the
cold temperatures in Pittsburgh.

HANGING OUT

Downtime is a treasured commodity for busy
Pitt students, whether it's a quick break between
classes or a stress—free weekend, and they know
how to make the most of it.

Pitt students are no strangers to Nordy’s Place,
which offers two things often crucial to relaxation:
food and games. Located on the lower level of
the William Pitt Union, this popular hangout has
pool tables, televisions, and a wide variety of food
and drinks for students to enjoy.

The Litchfield Towers patio provides benches and
tables perfect for students in search of fresh air
while they socialize with friends or work on their
homework. When they’re in need of more physical
activity, students have to look no further than the

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

   

Market Central is a great place
for students to relax and catch up
with friends.

Soldiers and Sailors Military Museum and Memorial
lawn or Schenley Park for a casual game of football
or Frisbee.

For most Pitt students, academics are their first
priority, but when it’s time for a much—needed break,
they don’t have to do much searching to find the
perfect spot to spend their downtime.

A FAREWELL TO PITT

Seniors celebrate their graduation from the
University of Pittsburgh in May. A ceremony
at the Petersen Events Center marks the
completion of their undergraduate careers at
Pitt and the beginning of the next phase of
their lives.

Despite the excitement of their last days on
campus, graduates still have to contend with
finals, packing, and saying good—bye to friends
in addition to looking for full—time positions or
preparing for graduate school.

Even for returning students, the end of the spring
term signals an important transition to the next

 
 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 

120

level of their education. Some stay in Pittsburgh
for the summer, while others return home, travel,
or explore a new city through internships and
summerjobs, but they all return to Pitt more mature
and ready to face the next collegiate challenge.

The end of the school year provides an opportunity
to explore new areas, make new connections, and
begin new careers. No matter what the next year
brings, experiences from the University of Pittsburgh
will stay with students and graduates forever.

University of Pittsburgh

Alma Mater, wise and glorious,
Child of Light and Bride of Truth,
Over fate and foe victorious,
Dower’d with eternal youth.
Crowned with love of son and daughter,
Thou shalt conquer as of yore.
Dear Old Pittsburgh, Alma Mater,
God preserve Thee ever more.

First beyond the mountains founded,

T here the West road opens free,
Where twin rivers, forest bounded
Merge and journey t’ward the sea,

O» In the dawning of the nation

Ere the clouds of strife had cleared,
’Rose thy rough—hewn habitation,

By our prophet fathers reared.

Close thy mother love embraces
All who gather at thy knee,
Castes and classes, creeds and races,
Mother, are as one to Thee;

Thou who unto knowledge bore us,
In the good old days long gone,
Raise thy Gold and Blue high o'er us,

‘ Lead and we will follow on.
Dear Old Pittsburgh, Alma Mater,

God preserve Thee ever more.

PRES|DENT’S LETTER

2009 Student Government Board

Fellow Students,

Four years ago, we entered the University of
Pittsburgh as freshmen, armed with academic
curiosity, adolescent awkwardness, and instructions
from our mothers on how to do our own laundry.

Since then, we have developed individually,
shaping our personalities, interests, and skills
through our collegiate experiences. But we’ve
also grown together as a class and built lifelong
friendships. Our fondest memories at Pitt,

like celebrating the endless stream of victories
captured by the Pittsburgh Steelers and watching
in awe as some of the world’s greatest leaders
arrived in our humble city to discuss global policy,
wouldn’t be as great as they are if we hadn’t
experienced them together.

Though we've already changed so much, in the
years to come, we, as well as our University, will
undoubtedly continue to evolve. But when we
reflect on our time here, whether it’s while flipping
through the pages of this yearbook or dropping
our own children off at Pitt, we will always be able
to take comfort in some certain constants:

The Cathedral of Learning will always be there to
guide us back home, and we will always be sons
and daughters of the University of Pittsburgh.

Good luck to the Class of 2010, and hall to Pitt!
