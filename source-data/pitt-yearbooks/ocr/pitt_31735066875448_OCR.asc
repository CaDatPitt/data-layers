A Message from the Chancellor

As members of the class of 2001, you are entering a

world that is eager for the knowledge, talents, and skills
you developed at the University of Pittsburgh. Some of
what you have achieved will be apparent from your

formal credentials, announcing that you have successfully

completed the course of study in your chosen disciplines. P

But many of the truly important talents you nurtured
here——the ability to analyze problems and think critically,
to use an array of tools to gather information, to put
yourself in the other person's shoes, to work in teams and
to continue learning—are not formally recorded on your
diplomas. These attributes, which will help you to grow
and lead throughout your professional life, are the “added
value” that you take away as part of your University of
Pittsburgh education. They will pay dividends, for you

and for society, throughout your lifetime.

This book, filled with essays by your peers and
photos of your experiences, is meant to keep the
memories of your Pitt experiences alive. It is produced
through a partnership among the Student Government,
the Alumni Association, and the University
Administration as a keepsake for the class of 2001.

As you now move on to pursue new opportunities
and meet new challenges, we ask you to remember that
you will always remain part of the University of
Pittsburgh. Our extended family of alumni can be found
in every state in the United States and in most of the
nations of the world. One of the most rewarding ways to
nurture this relationship is through active participation in
our alumni programs, which are rich in mutual benefits
for Pitt and Pitt's alumni. Participation in these programs
also is one of the best ways to continue building those
intangible talents and skills that are the foundation of your
Pitt education.

We hope your alma mater will forever play a part in
your life and that you. will continue to take part in the
exciting enterprise that is the University of Pittsburgh in

the 21st Century.

A Rough Draft

It’s all about the journey, isn’t it? Making
choices, making decisions. Loyal to some,
abandoning others for What We think is better or for
the hope of what may come along. Building a
foundation for our future, constructing a profile for
What we Want from life. How have We filled that
profile? What outlines have been satisfied by
everything We’d ever hoped? What unexpected
charms have become the most amazing experiences
which we Wouldn’t trade for all the success in the
World? How have our lives changed?

We passed under the Cathedral arches believing
certain things and automatically distrusting others.
Maybe We believed in ourselves, or perhaps that self
confidence was yet to come. Then the most
incredible things began to enter our lives. People,
love, tears, thrills, ideas, inspiration, spirit. . . all
flooded our minds and sketched out a rough draft of
how our lives may turn out. New Ways of thinking,
behaving, acting, and feeling lent themselves to a self-

drawn silhouette.

As We look back, What do We remember about
these fast changing years? That awesome football
game? Those sordid parties? The classes that seemed
to drag on into the Wee hours of the morning?
Perhaps, but What do you remember most? What
experience changed the Way you live your life?

Was there one person who reshaped the Way you
think, be it a friend, professor, lover, or employer?
Was there a class that so moved you and filled you
with inspiration that it became the very reason to
step onto campus every day? Did you find a group
of people so in tune to What you Were feeling that it
scared you to think of your life Without them? What
fleshed out your life over your time at Pitt?
Anything?

We thought so.

Do you remember the first time you walked into the

close to a professional team. " if 2  I admit it, searching endlessly for the

\ college of my dreams, my main concern
was  do they have a Division I football
team? Of course, the purpose of college is
to prepare for a career and what-have-you,
but I had more in mind. I wanted
pompoms and face paint, fight songs and
endless chants, adrenaline rushes and field
rushes. At the final Panther Stadium game

when we crushed the Fighting Irish, I had

all of this. However, as I looked around, I
remember feeling like my Division I school dream was over; no one would paint various PSU insults on
their shirts and trek to Three Rivers next fall! I was very wrong.

On September 2, 2000, the day of our season opener against Kent State, my dream came true once again.
Walking across Fort Pitt bridge, I received a vision of the soon-to-be Steeler stadium and our new Panther
home, but for now, all I could see of it were cranes, bulldozers, 12,000 tons of steel, and massive amounts of
dirt. The smell of grilled kielbasa and hamburgers was in the air, as our 2000 home, Three Rivers Stadium,
was surrounded with blue-and-gold colored tailgaters. The rousing song began to play over the
loudspeakers, our cue to look up at Panther Vision. I felt the Panther pride once again. Fireworks jolted the
crowd as the Panthers rushed out. A wave of goose-bumps and adrenaline moved over me as the student
section started the screams and chants I feared would be missing. The Panthers began the 2000 season

Victoriously, destroying Kent, 30-7,

and while the student section may
have had a few empty seats, the

ones there were still rowdy as hell.

Na|anda’s C ialkboard

Walking into the Indian classroom, I am immediately struck by it’s jaw-
dropping beauty. How can I concentrate on the lecture when I canbarely
absorb my surroundings? Looking around the warm, welcoming room, I feel
as if I’ve been time-warped to a Buddhist Monastery in the 7th century. I am
in a classroom at the University of Nalanda, the room radiating a rose hue.
The floors and walls are constructed with custom-made brick. The bench style
desks are made of a smooth, deep colored wood. The lighting is arranged
artistically to soften the glow, and covering the windows are cast steel grilles,
specifically designed to mask the reality of Pittsburgh.

Taking my seat, I continue my daydream through time. The replica of a
bronze charter on the wall baffles me, as it is written in a foreign script. The
bold, glass-fiber reinforced columns throughout the room are etched with
swags and tassels, rosettes and fruits, bringing the aura of the outside

courtyards into the class. At one end of the room is a cherry—wood

chalkboard, while the opposite end of the room displays a replica of the _ _ _

there are a few glass—covered, inner-lit cases

The next time you’re feeling

overwhelmed by the post—collegiate
experience, come back to Pitt and visit the

mind, its magnificence will place you in a
bubble, blowing you far away from

Oakland and into the splendor of India.

No, it's not the Cathedral. These massive
cranes are rising to the task of bringing Pitt

the Multi—Purpose Academic Center.

Urban Renewal

Opening in March 2001, the Jewish University

Cf Center promises to be a place of activity and fun.

Sarah, a sophomore majoring
in business, rushes to her 4 p.m. class.
Coming from Forbes Hall,
she crosses the street at Forbes

Avenue and Bouquet Street to reach

 

her destination, the tan and white,
six-story Multi-Purpose Academic
Complex (MPAC).

This scenario will become real

sometime in 2002. Until then,

 

students Walking by the construction site on their way to class or waiting outside Fuel 86 Fuddle
on a Saturday night will be simply staring at a big hole in the ground. The framework is finally
starting to go up as the bulldozers and cranes create all kinds of noise.

When this project is finished, Pitt will have a new home for the Undergraduate School of
Business as well as the psychology and computer science departments. The MPAC is also
planning to help with the lingering problem of parking on campus. Commuters will have over
90 new places to park. For now, however, the only things ready are the underground drainage
system and some plumbing and electric.

After Sarah’s class ends, she heads down Forbes Avenue to the corner of Craig Street. Her
destination is The Jewish University Center. She strolls into the three-story building and heads
towards the student lounge to meet a few friends for Shabbat dinner.

Students will have to anxiously wait until March of
2001 to explore this new building. A large, multi-purpose
room, a chapel, high-speed digital access, and computers
are just some of the features. It will also be the home
for social, educational, and cultural activities for students.
Both of these buildings will add even more opportunities

to the Pitt community.

maximum capacity. Vehicles lining the left lane of Forbes

Avenue bumper to bumper. Battling the confusion of such a

huge campus, overwhelmed families searched for the quickest
ways to unload. Lines of impatient people could be found at the
elevators, the line to rent carts, and anywhere one would look.
While young men and women became college students, their
parents drove away with tears in their eyes after letting their
babies go.

The rush began at 7:30 a.m. around campus, and the race
was on. Early risers were luckier than most as the yellow
unloading carts soon became unavailable. Signs directing families
around campus went undetected, forcing them to ask other
clueless newcomers for directions.

questions were answered, freshmen had a chance to really enjoy
the experience their new lives held in store for them.

Orientation Week welcomed students as the campus
transformed into something students had not expected. Cell
phones were being sold on the union walkway. Everyone was
asking students to apply for credit cards, and HBO came to visit
with great student offers.

With a plethora of opportunities, the day had come for
Panther inductees to honor their fate. Closing one chapter of
their lives and opening another, a new class swallowed the

overwhelming fears and frustrations of college life and welcomed

their new home into their hearts.

Tall Tales  

We eat pizza every night, calling Papa John’s
for pineapple and extra garlic butter sauce. We stay
up until 3 a.m., sitting in the hallway laughing so
hard that we have to make an emergency run to the
bathroom. We have class at 9 a.m., but all we care
about is the next laugh. We take full advantage of
the Ethernet connections in our rooms, checking
our e-mail at least 50 times a day, and of course only
using the Internet for “school-related purposes.” We
make web pages detailing our personal jokes. We
nickname the people on our floor who we don’t like
so we can talk about them and they’ll never know.

We play Monopoly during finals’ week, taking a
break from the monotonous studying, stifling our
giggles during 24-hour quiet time. We wake up
Saturday at noon to go to the caf for breakfast,
specifically for the scrambled eggs, and help each
other pick what foods look the most edible. We sit

at our regular table, have food fights, and dare each

other to eat combinations of melted frozen yogurt,
pickles, and grape jam. We put salt in each other’s
drinks when we leave the table for a moment,
waiting for the face of disgust. Essentially, we have
become eight years old again, this time in the
absence of our parents.

This is the eighth floor of Tower C, but it
could have been anywhere in the dorms and
probably was. Our best friends and worst enemies
are our neighbors. We get used to sharing a
bathroom with 30 other people, used to shaving
our legs in the sink, and used to dragging our
laundry down eight floors once a month to wash
it. We’re used to signing friends in and forgetting
to sign them out. We’re used to the noise of
Oakland outside our windows and the sound of
alarm clocks that aren’t our own. We’re used to
getting in trouble with the R.A.’s for being too
noisy, and used to cramming into a friend’s room
to pile onto the bed and watch prime time
television. We’re used to coming home and
checking if our friends’ doors are open.

Mainly, we’re used to sharing our lives with
each other, by choice or not. You can tell a lot
about a person by the way they brush their teeth,
walk down the hallway, and by how long they
take in their morning shower when everyone is
waiting. The dorm means lots of laughs and lots of

tears, and inevitably, stories for a lifetime.

The phone bill is resting on the kitchen table
beside some crumbs, where it has been serving as a
coaster. The electric bill is lying next to that, and
the mailman kindly just dropped off the cable bill.
Unfortunately, its also the first of the month,
which means the rent is due. It feels like all the
money you stashed away last summer is leaking
out of your checking account as fast as the water
from the broken pipes in the bathroom! You solve
all the problems perfectly by sacrificing your
weekly trip to Giant Eagle for groceries; you’ve
survived just fine on Ramen noodles before, so you
can do it again.

You write out your checks, haul your books
to the bus stop, ﬂash your Pitt ID and board the
oh—so—exciting PAT bus. If you’re lucky, you
might actually snag a window seat and catch up on
some reading or watch the city scenery roll by.
Even if you have to stand, PAT gets you to class
safely and on time (usually).

There were many responsibilities on the
shoulders of those who shipped out of the dorms
on campus and headed into the world of off-
campus living. At first, the responsibilities of living
on your own might have been overwhelming; after
all, it was so easy when all you had to do was walk
downstairs to Eddie’s and grab a pasta dinner,
complete with garlic bread, and money was never a
concern. But with these responsibilities came
incredible independence and finally, you could do

things the way you wanted. You could leave your

    

  ksThat Do n’t B 0 u    

clothes all over the floor. You could get a satellite
and watch every station imaginable. You could buy
any kind of food you wanted and cook it yourself.
It was finally a place to call your own, and learning
to copeﬁyvith those bills and responsibilities was a
part of it. You learned to love it, and you always

gave thanks when your check didn’t bounce!

The distinct smell of french fries that Pitt students know so well fills the
air and seems to lure people into The Original Hot Dog Shop. Better known
as “The O,” it is the local fast food restaurant on
Forbes Avenue that draws college students. The
painted windows, flashing lights, and neon signs on
the outside all add to its unique appearance. The O is always busy and filled
with action as college students pack into the small two—story restaurant to
laugh, talk, stuff their faces with food, or just relax and hang out with friends.

Constantly bouncing with hungry people and excitement, The O is
where familiar faces are seen. Customers line up in front of a long counter to
place their order or wait for their food. The seating areas are usually filled to
capacity. One table is surrounded by starving students indulging in loads of
shrimp baskets and hot dogs, while another table is full of people too busy to
talk as they devour the deliciously large but inexpensive pizzas. All the table
tops are crowded with sodas or mounds of golden crisp french fries. Near the
entrance, arcade games line the wall with students engrossed in a game or two
as they wait for their order.

The O is the place that students can count on to be open all weekend,
every weekend. Students can go there before a party to pick up some 40s, or
go there after a party has ended to cure those early morning munchies. In fact,
The O appears to be the busiest during the early morning hours on a Friday
or Saturday. The O is ready and willing to serve
starving college students almost until dawn, when
every other food restaurant is closed. It’s the only
place around that is open till 5 a.m. on the weekends.

The O has become such a familiar and daily
part of Pitt students’ lives that sometimes the smell
of the food doesn't even seem noticeable anymore.

It is a place that most students will remember and
definitely visit as they become alumni. The crackle
of food being fried, the loud chatter of students, and
the sounds of arcade games late at night is what
makes The 0 so special  that and the enormous

amount of food served for the low prices!

Hillman is as packed as the Pitt vs. Penn State game. It’s difficult to
find an empty table. Study groups are gathered everywhere, chattering
away about weekend parties, making concentration nearly impossible.
Books and papers are spread out over the table, notes are taken, pages are
highlighted, and the outline is (sort of) complete. It is 10 p.m. The
dreaded paper is due at nine the next morning. The pressure is on!

This is probably a common experience with many of us here at the
university, sometimes known as “procrastination-nation,” a place we like
to reside. Who knows what causes the procrastination from which we
suffer? Maybe it’s because a class is about as exciting as dust, or maybe
the prof for that class doesn’t realize that you do have work in four
other classes. Whatever the reason, we’ve all been there, and we all know
what it’s like to cram. The night before the paper is due or the exam is
scheduled, the pressure pounds down like hail, making it impossible to
think about anything else. You spend the night
in the library or in the peace of the Cathedral,
wired on enough coffee to keep you going until
the next day. It’s so stressful that your hands
might shake, your brain feels numb, and you
crack up over words like ‘Australopithecus’ with
your study partner, laughing until you cry. It’s
the hysteria of cramming, for sure, and there’s
nothing like it. Maybe you work best under
pressure, and there’s certainly no pressure like
something due in three hours. At the Very least,
cramming teaches you to appreciate sleep more

than life itself.

Brain Pain

Some classes at the University of Pittsburgh are
legendary for being “cake courses.” They cause zero stress
and we only have to study for a couple of hours in order to
pass with ﬂying colors.

Unfortunately, there are also many classes out there
waiting in the course description book to attack us like
sharks. Having one or more of these classes during a
semester causes more than a fair share of brain pain.
Imagine organic chemistry at the same time as animal
physiology, or a philosophy class the same day as one of
those four hour labs.

Oh, yes, we know the type. These classes consist of
hours of lectures that leave us grinding our teeth and
attempting to understand our own notes, often more
difficult to read than the professor’s handwriting. The
books weigh more than we do. They provide no exciting
company when we lug them to the library and settle down
for an all-nighter, just to understand the first chapter.
Coffee doesn’t help. Study partners don’t help. Forget
about taking a night off from studying; passing those classes
is the main priority, mainly so we don’t have to think
about them ever again!

The exams are the worst. Days before the dreaded test,
we can be found locked away in the library, making flash
cards and taking antacids. But afterwards, there is always a
sense of relief as we leave the room and take a moment to
realize it’s over. We feel a rush of accomplishment when we
get the exam back a few days later to see a nice grade
splashed across the top. We know our hard work was for
something, and we suddenly have bragging rights to our

friends. Well, at least until the next exam!

Climbing to Mount Washington at six miles an hour,
students enjoy a calm ride up the incline, ready for

the unique view.

I see Pittsburgh every day, but unfortunately, I always
see it from my Vertically challenged five-foot, two-inch
stature. The buildings are tall, the people are tall (well, taller
than me, at least) and going about their business. The traffic
is forever backed up. Pittsburgh is a city like any other. But
how about seeing Pittsburgh from 367.39 feet in the air?

The Monongahela Incline moves up Mount Washington
at a speed of only six miles an hour, making it easy to soak
in all of the sights. This incline, complete with wooden
bench seats and warmly painted walls, is more modern than
Pittsburgh’s other incline, the Dusquene. A small crowd
gathers into the space inside, chattering away about the best
sights; many people have cameras pressed against the glass,
snapping photos of the view. The ride is smooth; it feels like
we’re gliding on a mini roller coaster. The tallest buildings
suddenly look little, like Legos arranged across the river.
The vehicles appear to be tiny Matchbox cars, moving
slower than bugs across the streets and bridges. It’s
impossible to spot any actual human beings from this point.
I kick back and enjoy the scenery. The beautiful skyline
stretches out to all corners.

The ride lasts only a few minutes, and in the distance I
spot the Cathedral of Learning standing proudly. The most
unique thing about being up here is that it is so peaceful.
Pittsburgh lies below, moving along in silence. There are no
car horns blaring or buses roaring. The rush is invisible.
From the incline, I see Pittsburgh in a different way (a not-

so—short way) and enjoy a fun ride while I’m at it.

Ruckus & Roar

Screams of victory cascaded through the air on Sept. 16, 2000 at Three
Rivers Stadium. The Homecoming spirit was higher than ever when Pitt
defeated Penn State 12-0 on that sunny afternoon. The game was just one of
the Homecoming festivities that took place at Pitt.

Rainy weather did not stop the bonfire crowd on the night of September
14th. School spirit was in the air as the flames burned high and students
chanted the sounds of victory for their football team. Lasers and fireworks lit
the sky and the Cathedral of Learning in shades of blues, pinks and purples
while students cheered, danced, and cherished good times with close friends.

People began tailgating early the next morning to celebrate in helping
their Pitt Panthers to victory. By kickoff time, Three Rivers was filled to

capacity with cheering fans, students and alumni. The band played, the

crowds screamed endlessly and the Good Year blimp circled the stadium as

Pitt did not allow

The party was just beginning as the crowd
returned to Oakland. Forbes Avenue was a
parade of cars, buses, and crazed people.

The final event to Homecoming was the
cruise on the majestic Gateway Clipper.
Students danced, laughed, and had a magical
night on the river as the moon lit the sky on
that starry night. Homecoming will always be
in the memories of the students, the crackling
of the fireworks, the burning of the fire and the
happy cries of a football win that was

years in the making!

Pink Cows and Silver

I was intrigued by the cans of soup. I had a blast with the mylar balloons.

Clouds

I was a little confused by the pink cows. But most of all, I thought the Andy
Warhol Museum was a great way to spend a Saturday afternoon. Getting out
of Oakland and away from the pressures of studying and mid-terms was excuse
enough for the trip to the North Side’s most eclectic collection of art, free to

soon as the door opens.

We moved through the museum, absorbing every nuance of eccentric art.

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

Surrounding us in one room were a series of drawings, all with the theme of a
snake’s life. Snakes as shoes, snakes sleeping, snakes in kindergarten. In another,
dozens upon dozens of purple Mao Tse-tungs stared while we ﬂopped down

on the famously comfortable parachute couches.

As nylon, foam, and my body meshed together to make me sleepy, I
thought about the immense impact Andy Warhol had on modern art. Who
hasn’t seen the famed pieces of Marilyn Monroe or Jackie Kennedy? His five
hour film of a man sleeping is known worldwide. My friends roused me
from the artistic comfort, and we made our way past two
hundred pink cows grazing in a neon green field to the
Silver Clouds exhibit.

Imagine, a room full of mylar balloons, half air and
half helium, being propelled around the room by fans,
you and your friends. Hurling them from one corner of
the room to another, you catch distorted glimpses of
yourself flying over your head and in front of your face.
A grown-up pillow fight, the Silver Clouds allow our not-
so-inner child to have a few moments of old school fun.

As we left the museum, I took a quick glance over
my shoulder and looked at the often seen photo of Andy
Warhol. The spiky hair, narrow eyes, and expressionless
expression almost dare me to come back and experience
his art again. In the Silver Clouds exhibit,
Pitt students can spend a few hours launching

The Sutherland Express departs from the Cathedral
of Learning filled to capacity, as usual. One student is
typing on his laptop. Although I have never seen one on
the bus, it does not surprise me. Rounding a sharp bend,
a cell phone rings making the balancing act more
interesting as nearly the entire bus, driver included,
reaches into pockets and bags in search of a phone.

Not only has technology altered the way the world
communicates but the way we live as well. National
Record Mart is no longer a stop at the mall. Students
need not pay for expensive music thanks to Napster.

The Internet not only made trading music easier, but
it also enhanced research and study significantly through
the ready availability of a huge body of knowledge and
the fast services of the Ethernet.

The Internet even made it easier to communicate.
When looking for someone in the "old days,” one would
take a walk to the neighbor's house down the road.

Later, one would make a call. Today, the first option is

the home phone number, then the work
number, followed by a call to the cell phone,
leaving a voice mail message of course, and
ending with an e—mail. And e-mail rapidly
became the first resort communication for
students. Dorm residents usually stayed online
day and night, leaving an appropriate "Away
Message" when they are unavailable.
As young people, if we have heard it once,

we have heard it a thousand times. "When I
was younger, I had to walk four miles uphill
both ways just to see my friends after I
finished all of the household chores. You kids
just don't appreciate how good you have it.”

They may be right, but we won’t complain.

Whether its in the Commons Room in the Cathedral or an

The steps of Hillman Library always offer the perfect munching spot.

The first time I saw a group of students sitting on
the steps of Hillman eating out of Styrofoam containers,
I was grossed out. I remember thinking, “Ugh, how can
you eat something that came out of the back of a truck?”
I scoffed and headed over to Eddie’s to use up my blocks
before I went back to my dorm room to study.

After three years, I was one of those people. I’d
stroll down Thackeray after class, past the inviting smells
of Indian food, and over towards Hillman to grab a
quick bite of fried rice. As I’d stand on the corner of
Bigelow and Forbes, mixed aromas of barbecue, hot dogs
and fresh Veggies enticed me into every line, but my
three dollars would only take me so far. Parking myself
on the steps, I would take time to enjoy my half hour
break before work. Around me, others were munching
on curry chicken, hot dogs, or falafel.

From the steps of Hillman to the hill of Thackeray,
truck Vendors dotted the Pitt campus with some of the
best restaurants around. Setting up every day for the late
mdrning rush, these sideline chefs prepared the quick
and \ineXpensive food that we’d all crave around
lunchtime. With loyal followers who would gush to
friends over egg rolls with duck sauce or Scottie’s hot
dogs, the trucks always had long lines twisting up and
down the busy streets of Oakland; truly a staple of the
Pitt experience.

No matter how many business dinners, exotic
luncheons, or evenings spent eating the finest cuisine I
may have, sitting on the Cathedral lawn or in front of
Frick Fine Arts downing some truck food will always

remain one of my most treasured dining experiences.

Be it spicy curry or veggie fried rice, nothing compared to the inexpensive

vendors that served hundreds of students, faculty and staff each day.

Steel Silly Comedy Jam

It was a night to remember.The David Lawrence auditorium
radiated energy and burst with talent as performers showed their
stuff on stage for the Black Action Society’s (BAS) talent show.

Part of Black Action Week, the night included poetry
readings, hilarious stand—up comedy performances, and R8513 and
rap remixes scratched out on twin turntables by D] Nate the
Phat Barber.

Host and comedian Jimmy Fast held the night together,
introducing such acts as the two—man crew Hot Commodity,
who rap along with D] Nate, and an
a cappella performance from 14-year-old Kerry

‘ llen, who belted out Sisqo’s hit “Incomplete.”

The open mic followed with a wide range of poets. From
dramatic internal dialogue to a comparison of fruit to a
woman’s body, the fresh and talented words captivated the
audience. Keeping alive the message and purpose of Black
Action Week, poet Tarish Pipkins recited pieces about famous
blacks throughout history and the need for continuity in the
black community.

The comedians came next. Roasting college life, the
audience, and the trials and tribulations of being a fat man kept
the crowd roaring through the final part of the show.

The Steel Silly Comedy Jam was part of Black Action
Week, an annual event produced by BAS. The continuing goals
of BAS are not only to offer a Voice to the African-American
student body, but to promote the message of the importance

cultural diversity in today’s society.

From Port to Port

My eyes scanned the massive crowd gathered around the dock.
There were so many people, and I was stuck in the middle of the
commotion. Finally, I saw the familiar faces of my parents. I was
overcome with joy to finally be back with my family, but then, as
I looked around, I realized I was leaving another family I had come
to know and love. I was surrounded by people who had gone from
being strangers to being some of the closest friends I'd ever had. As
the past three months traveling the seas and visiting exotic places
worldwide came to an end, I could only take one last look around
and reminisce about my experiences.

I wandered about in attempts to say good-bye, knowing I
wasn't ready to leave. I was reminded of all the times I'd had with
them. As I gave a good—bye hug to Anthony, I remembered the
time in Egypt when we toured the great pyramids and almost got
lost inside the maze of tunnels and tombs. In the distance, I saw
my roommate with her boyfriend and remembered the fun we had
dancing to makeshift rock bands during deck parties. Jamie walked
by and I smiled, remembering the time I dared him to
eat weird foreign food like fried elephant fish ears and
he got sick. He got me back by forcing me to eat
cheesesicles (cheese popsicles) in Vietnam.

I slowly made my way through the sea of faces.
Gina surprised me from behind and I thought of the
time we stayed up all night cramming for our courses.
If it hadn't been for her, I might have failed my finals.
It was hilarious how Alyssa could barely breathe when
we finally climbed all 2,100 stairs to the top of the
Great Wall.

For me, Semester at Sea was the first time that I

took a hike up a mountain, shopped in a street marketplace, visited

actual temples, and interacted with so many different cultures. My life-

Hammocks are conducive to catching up on required reading.

Connecting with the native community

as only a Pitt student can.

moment I boarded the ship, and will last forever.

 A Million Miles From Home

Living in a city where the cars are tiny and
drive on the wrong side of the road. Walking
around Piccadilly Circus in the middle of the night,
surrounded by club-hoppers, neon signs and the
smell of incense. Hearing different languages,
accents, and the words loo, queue, and snogging
sprinkled through conversation. Riding the tube to
get to the inner city where pubs are on every
corner, or the outer city were the botanical gardens
grow lush ﬂowers. Getting lost in ornate museums

with artwork I've only ever seen in books.

Wandering through castles with passageways and

 

crowns. Living in a city where beer is the coffee of
the day and red is the color of the year, painted on
every bus and phone box. Living with five
strangers in a flat and watching BBC. Living a
million miles from home. Living in London,
England, and learning an ancient history, a modern
art, another culture.

All of this is a fraction of what I remember
from my semester of study abroad. Pitt in London
hooked me up with a scrapbook of memories I
won't ever forget. Spending a semester, a year, or
even a summer in another country means being
totally immersed in that culture, learning things
never to be learned in a classroom in the
Cathedral. A semester abroad means eventually
losing the title tourist and becoming a resident. I
grocery shopped for different ethnic foods, ate fish
and chips, learned the history of the monarchy,
and even went to school, like a normal British
college student. And although England is an
English-speaking country, the words and accents
take on a language of their own. I ate, drank and
slept the city, and soaked up as much of the
lifestyle as I could. Not only did time studying
abroad make me fall in love with traveling and
learning another culture, but it made me appreciate

home, and our own city of Pittsburgh.

The Greek community is a proponent of many important causes during

the year, including the urgent need for blood donations.

Giving Your Best Shot

It's for a good cause, it's for a good cause, I kept telling myself as I reclined on the chair,
listening to the instructions from the blue uniformed woman standing next to me. She was
preparing the plastic tubing and small bags. And the needles.

“My name's Jeannie. Is this your first time?”

“Uhh. . . yeah. It is.”

“Well, you're doing fine.”

I was actually pretty nervous. My palms were sweating as I held a small, rubber ball in the
hand of my fully extended right arm. Of course I'd had shots with needles and blood taken
before, but never voluntarily and certainly never on the first floor of the William Pitt Union.
But a few weeks before, a friend had kindly asked if I would donate in the name of her sorori-
ty. The Greeks had organized a blood drive, and every pint would help dozens of people get-
ting operations or visiting emergency rooms. The main floor of the Union was now filled
with similar chairs standing upon plastic mats. The smells of iodine and plastic wafted about
as ]eannie's colleagues crossed the mats, attending to other students. Most people were joking,
laughing, and talking with each other, but some were fully reclined with cool rags on their
foreheads. All had little red tubes connecting their arms to the small bags hanging on the sides
of the chairs. It dawned on me that they were actually clear tubes. I gulped.

Looking around, I noticed how many of the donors were wearing sorority sweatshirts or
caps declaring their fraternities. I had been asked by a friend to donate, but the Greek commu-
nity had arrived of their own accord, providing a selfless service that was compensated only
with the personal satisfaction of knowing
that each unit of blood would make a
true difference.

Well, that and a cookie.

“Okay, I'm going to put the line in
now,” Jeannie prepared me. “Then I need
you to give the rubber ball a good
squeeze every five seconds, or so. It
might burn a little at first, but that's nor-
mal. You ready?” It's for a good cause.

“Yup,” I smiled.

Greek Life

Amid chanting and cheering, nearly 250 women
rush out of the Union eager to join a sorority. A parade
of claps, singing and hugs triumphs to Amos Hall,
McCormick Hall or Bellefield Avenue to celebrate the
newest members of the sorority.

Over the random shouts and pool balls clashing,
the Pitt football game can be heard on the television in
the background. The pizza was just ordered and the
new men will be coming in any minute. During the
party, the brothers offer you a bid — your new
membership to their house.

After that, it's all fun and games.

Greeks make up nearly 15 percent of the student
body. Involvement guarantees you a friend in every
class, someone to call on a Friday night, and someone
who can appreciate waking up at 7:30 on a Saturday to
run a 5K.

The years of membership guarantee long-lasting

friendships, millions of embarrassing stories and

countless sleepless nights.

After seeing what benefits you can reap from
being Greek, it gives everything you do more
meaning. When looking for a job, an alumnus might
work there. When searching for an internship, your
recently graduated sister is looking for an intern. It's
all about establishing a new network of job
connections and letters of recommendation, but
most importantly, friends.

Greek Week gives you a whole new
appreciation of what a week actually can be. Rush
gives new meaning to stress, and off-campus mixers
give a dollar more Value.

But recruiting the next members — the next
generation — gives a whole new meaning to being a
friend, a mentor and a teacher. Because without

your brothers or sisters, where would you be today?

promote friendship and bring its members closer together.

One Week

Think about spring break. Think about beaches and parties and the fun
of staying out all night and sleeping in all day. Think about the car trips
and cruises and spending every waking moment with your best friends.

Now think about another spring break. You were still with your best
friends, still going on a trip, and still on a beach, but the fun was not in
partying until dawn, but in helping to make a difference in the world, be it
the environment or the world of one family. Think about the differences
one week can make in the lives of so many people. The Alternative Spring

Break, sponsored by Student Volunteer Outreach, sends dozens of eager

students all over the country each year to help with community and
environmental programs.

Think about traveling to help a poverty stricken Appalachian family
build a house in rural Kentucky. Think about how you and your friends
helped move that family into their first real home. Think about how the
poverty level struck you as unimaginable, but how the family was just too

overjoyed to have their home built. Jean Park, now a Volunteer

Coordinator at Pitt, still thinks about these things almost five years after
her first trip to Kentucky. it’s all part of the job as students help to provide a safe,

Think about the sense of accomplishment when you gazed out over the
makeshift dune of over 100 old Christmas trees, collected
and donated for this specific purpose. Think about how
you helped make the world last a little longer. Vanessa
Papalazaro still thinks about these moments as she
embarks on a new trip each year.

Think about how you made differences. Think about
new perspectives on life and the world. Think about that
feeling that swelled inside when you took a step back and
looked at your deeds.

Think about it.

Be careful! You better watch your step or otherwise their menacing

Pitt’s women of the ice speed across the rink administering
checks, making slapshots, and scoring hat tricks with the
precision, dedication and skill that has become second nature

to all athletes at the university.

SO

SCORE!

The crowd anxiously files into Neville Rink in the South Side
to get ready for another exciting Panther women’s ice hockey game.
While spectators find their seats and get some food, the players get
ready upstairs. “It’s my favorite rink because it’s not imposing and
formal like the new rinks,” said Emily Rice, a member of the team.

The game starts with six players from each team. Starting in a
certain position, they switch about every minute. Penalties add more
intensity and roughness to the game. A Panther takes a slap shot,
gets a penalty, and the opposing team has a power play.

The crowd has moments where they act crazier than the
players. Parents, friends, and significant others come out to show
their great amount of support for the ladies. The impressive
performance that the Panthers give at every game is due to their
rigorous hockey practices.

Practices are basically for keeping in shape and maintaining

muscle strength in their legs. Most practice sessions usually last for

an hour and will consist of activities like
stretching, sprinting, running, and playing
basketball. Practices are hard, but it certainly has
its rewards at the games.

“Hockey is a really intense sport,” says Rice.
“You know that you’re only going to be on the ice
for maybe a minute and a half at a time and you

want to make your shift count.”

Megan Harrison

The team’s sense of determination and pursuit of victory never

get in the way of having fun on the ice and keeping cool heads.

A ﬂash of gilded pompom. A sharp

tumbling sequence. A host of voices blazed
into one inspiring battle cry, rising above the
thunder of the stands. Bedazzling us with their
brilliance and motivating us with their energy,
the University
of Pittsburgh
cheerleaders
are certainly
the heart and
soul of the
sidelines.

The vivacity of the squad reaches every
corner of the stadium, from the frenzied fans
to the motivated players and coaches.
Pounding their feet in unified rhythm, they
encourage us to stomp our Nikes in response.
Soaring through the air in ﬂawlessly executed
basket-tosses, they make us wish we knew how

to fly, too.

“Soaring through the air in

flawlessly executed basket-

tosses, they make us wish
we knew how to fly too.”

With a pair of pompoms and an encouraging
smile, the peppy cheerleaders and the
accompanying dance team bring a splash of

sparkle to every game.

When the first strains of “Hit Me with
Your Best Shot” fill the stands, the throngs of
students leap to their feet in anticipation of
catching a coveted Pitt t-shirt.

When they’re not flinging Panther
paraphernalia amongst the fans or being
propelled heavenward by their teammates,
these athletes perform tumbling passes worthy
of Olympic gold. Stunning dance routines and
invigorating cheers complete an athletically
brilliant sideline performance.

Most noteworthy, these cheerleaders have
respect and enthusiasm for their sport and for
the game. Smiles never leaving their faces, the
Pitt cheerleaders are Panthers from the
clapping hands above their heads right down
to the soles of their feet.
Because of the passion
they infuse into the
crowds, we walk out of
the stadium each
Saturday with cheeks
that ache from grinning,
throats raw from screaming, and limbs tingling
with energy. Thank you, Pitt cheerleaders;

you love what you do and so do we!

The smell of the freshly cut green grass, the lights
of the stadium, and the competitive aura in the air
excited me as I awaited kickoff. It Was time once again
for the Pitt men's soccer team to take the field and
play against the best of the Big East and the country.
Two thousand’s men's soccer team was out to prove
that they could play and do it in grand style.

It was game time and everyone Was hyped up and
ready to play. Within minutes the midfield dropped a
pass through the middle of the opposing defense and
the attack finished the goal beautifully With an upper
90 shot. The sideline went nuts and the crowd chimed
in with its own hoorays. The magic of the game of
soccer is What ignites these people to come to their
feet and jump for joy. With every touch of the ball,

the soccer player in me came alive more and more.

     

In 1999 they were just squeaking by, but in 2000 I
loved to see the Pitt team handle the field With ease.
By the end of the game the Panthers had come out on
top and were rejoicing their Victory with their fans. It
appeared that all of those 6 a.m. practices up at the
Cost Center with the endless amounts of running and
the hard fought scrimmages had paid off and the
results were very promising for a strong post—season
performance. While every ounce of me Wished I could
be on the field playing with the guys, their success is a

true credit to the past and future of the program.

Full Court

Numerous blue and gold banners hang from the ceiling of the aged
Fitzgerald Fieldhouse. The bleachers are full of enthusiastic basketball
supporters. Roaring fans are on their feet cheering during the last few seconds
of the game. Down by two, the Panthers put on a full court press attempting
to steal the ball. Successfully, Pitt comes away with a steal and charges
toward the home hoop. With perfect form, right, left, up, he releases the ball
softly into the air.

Although the game hasn't changed, the location where Pitt plays has. To
be completed late 2001 or early 2002, the John M. and Gertrude E. Petersen
Events Center is the new home for both the men and women's basketball
teams. The new playing court is highly anticipated among players and
students. Not only will the games be played in the Events Center, but the
popular Midnight

Madness will as well.

Despite the change of scenery, Panther fans will continue to attend exciting
games for entertainment. There is nothing like a cliffhanging game at Pitt.
The ball glides through the air with ease. If only for a moment, the
crowd reverts to complete silence. The players, coaches, and fans suck in
their breath and hope for victory. In slow motion, the spinning orange
sphere nears the hoop, and gently bounces from the backboard. It touches
the rim and rolls around as if defying the inevitable. Finally, the ball falls
through the net allowing a solid, "whoosh" to be heard in the stands.

Instantly, the Events Center is occupied with thousands of screaming fans.

All other teams beware! If you don’t get out of the way, the

powerful Pittsburgh Panthers will trample you.

With the rising of the sun, the Pitt football
players jump on a bus to the South Side for
morning practice. It is a struggle in itself to keep
their droopy eyes open as the bus bumps through
the city streets of Pittsburgh. The men hurry out
of the locker room and onto the field hoping they
are not late. Offense runs routes while defense

practices their blocks. During field breaks, the

team is usually catching a very quick and healthy
bite to eat or holding meetings.

Exhausted from catching, throwing, and
conditioning drills, the players have time and
energy only for resting during preseason camp.
Forced to run timed sprints, the upperclassmen
become examples to the newcomers. Failure in
the tests results in extra early morning
conditioning and retests, followed by team
practice. Weight training is yet another factor of
these athletes’ lifestyle. Before camp, it is merely a
group of men, but after camp, it becomes a team.

Blue and gold paint saturated the faces and bodies of the roaring Panther fans that

packed the 12th Man section. While chants of "P-E-N-N-S-T SUCKS" overpowered

the Voice of the announcer, blue and gold swung throughout the crowd in a rage of Pitt
pride. The players on the sideline turned to the crowd, raising their arms to urge the fans
to cheer louder. They were answered with a chant of "DEFENSE" as the rowdy

crowd encouraged the Panthers to refuse the Lions a single score. As the sun
sporadically peaked out from behind the clouds to warm the cool river air,

the Panther football team obeyed their fans and shut out the Nittany Lions. A king

as well as a queen was crowned, a game was played, a record was broken, and a

statement was made.

You Wake up extra early. It’s your first day and
you Want to be on time to make a good impression.
There’s no Worry about What to Wear since you
already spent hours the night before choosing the
perfect outfit. It needed to make you look like a
responsible adult, yet fun to be with. You take one last
look in the mirror and head out, your heart pounding
as you Wonder if you’ll do okay. Who ever knew a
non-paying job would make you so nervous?

Standing in front of the main door, you take a

deep breath, and knock. A little girl slightly opens the

door, sheepishly peering through the crack. “Hi! You

must be Sara. I'm your new Big Sister!” She smiles and There are many ways to get out into the community
you forget your jitters. She grabs your hand and asks and volunteer, including keeping our parks litter free
you to take her to the park. The rest of the day goes and the popular Big Brother, Big Sister program.

smoothly as the two of you laugh, play, and become
friends. You learn about her likes, her dislikes, her
fears, and her joys. As the day ends, she
looks up to you, Wraps her tiny arms
around your waist, and says thank you
for being there and for helping her have

so much fun.

It was a sunny Saturday morning in mid-November when a friend
and I decided to jump into his car and head down to the South Side for
some window shopping on Carson Street. The South Side was quite the
historic district as well as a great bar and club scene. For lunch, we
enjoyed some gyros at a tiny Greek restaurant as we watched a vast array
of people stroll by, from a trendy couple to a mother with her baby.

We returned to the car and kept going down Carson Street to end up
at Station Square. We browsed through the mall, deciding it was too
expensive to actually buy anything. Then, we checked out the Gateway
Clipper and then took in some breathtaking sights of Pittsburgh from
atop Mount Washington.

Next, we ended up in the North Side to see how the construction was
coming along on the new stadium. We both agreed that the stadium
would be a new excitement for Pitt game days. We drove past the Andy
Warhol Museum and I decided instantly that I wanted to go there
sometime and check out his art.

We decided to head to the Strip District for dinner at the Spaghetti
Warehouse. As we drove through the Strip, I remembered the time that
we ventured down here on a Sunday morning
to buy some fresh fruit and bagels and check
out Wholey's, the fish market. After a
delicious dinner of fettuccine and lasagna, we
walked around and observed the glamorous
club crowd finding their spots for the evening. M

As we headed back to Oakland, I
remembered that I needed a new pair of jeans.
Maybe I’d go over to Shadyside tomorrow to

shop for a while.

Window shopping is all the shopping many poor
Students can afford to do on highend Wamut Street. The next morning, my roommate and I headed off to

Shadyside to search for those jeans. On our Way, We passed
WQED Pittsburgh and realized that Mr. Rogers
Neighbor/aood, a television show that We grew up With,

was right here in Pittsburgh. Maybe I would run into Mr.
Rogers sometime!

When we arrived in Shadyside, Walnut Street Was

bustling with busy shoppers trying to do some early
Christmas shopping. We picked up cappuccinos at Starbucks
and strolled down Walnut. We browsed in The Pet Pad,
Banana Republic, Prantl’s Bakery, and finally to Express,
Where I found my jeans. All of the shops were expensive
and the whole area had a trendy appeal to it, definitely
different from Oakland.

Bloomfield was our next stop. My roommate
wanted to stop by this Italian bakery to get some
cannolis. I had never been here before, and she told
me that it was home to large Polish and Italian
communities. As we drove through, I noticed two
large hospitals and plenty of little Italian eateries,
making a mental note to visit one sometime.

While we were in the area, we decided to check
out Squirrel Hill. We walked down Murray Avenue
and made a quick stop at Barnes and Noble, followed

by dinner at Gullifty’s, which has the best desserts

by far. Murray Avenue has a more casual appeal
than Walnut Street. There were many teenagers
walking down the street, and I also recognized some

Many fun activities, including ice skating, are offered in Schenley Park.

Ah, Schenley Park. A colorful alternative
to the library, you go there to escape the
skyscrapers and stone of the city. And there
is even grass! This is most green you've seen
since you've been here. You and your
buddies make your way through the maze
of blankets and dodge the Various games to
find the perfect study spot. Study? Ha! You
were coming here to plow through that -

eight chapters of Biology that you so

conveniently let build up. You swear the
class was on the second chapter last week! As soon as you get situated on your blanket to do some major
cramming, suddenly your really, really heavy bio book combined with the warm sunshine puts you into an
instant yet guilty slumber.

As you dream, which of course includes a moonlit beach and Brad Pitt, other college students are
“studying” also. All around you are couples staring adoringly into each other’s eyes instead of into Hamlet and
sunbathers who are trying desperately to keep up their tan so that white tank top will look just right at the
club on Friday night. Ultimate Frisbee games and football catches, music blaring, the occasional wedding to
gawk at, and a saunter through Phipps Conservatory are more choices for you. It is quite rare to actually
witness someone studying. So many distractions, so little time! The beautiful colors of t e park put you at ease
and make you forget all of the tests, friends, lovers, papers, roommate quarrels, and money problems. Well, for

a little while at least.

You awaken to dogs barking and
your Biology book untouched at your
side. In reality, it was a wasted study
venture, but of course you know you will
be back tomorrow. Now it's off to the

library to actually get some work done!

I Invented Pants

Wow! Finally, I beat the crowd of lollipop pushers outside of
the fire hall, signed my John Hancock, and now stand waiting
patiently in line for one of those little box things. My first time
voting and all, I debate Gore, Bush, or even Nader. As I step into
the box and pull across the big red lever, I realize that I had not
quite decided exactly who I would choose. I want my vote to count
in the long run. Logically speaking, this election could easily be
declared by a few voters or even a small county like mine. Then
again, that has never happened before so probably not.

To my amazement, at that very moment, a little donkey
materialized on my right shoulder. While closely watching his
every move, I heard a snorting noise. I looked to my left only to
find an elephant sitting on my other shoulder. Instantly, I am taken
aback by these events, not to mention the incredible back pain I
was enduring at that Very moment. Suddenly, the donkey
began to speak.

“Young lady, you should vote for me. I promise to give
women equal rights everywhere, including their bodies.”

“Don't listen to him,” said the elephant. “He lies just like that
buddy of his in the Oval Office.”

“What does he know?! Listen. I came to visit Carnegie Mellon
and spoke to the students. You can plainly see that I care!”

“Shut that hole in your face!” The elephant was becoming
irate. “Young lady, even though I really didn't care to see the
students at all, at least I came to Pitt!”

Then the donkey calmly looked at me with a twinkle in his
eye and whispered, “It's much simpler to do all of your research
from a little computer on your desk isn't it, young lady?

Well let me tell you a secret, I invented the Internet.” Recalling all
of the times that I had surfed the net and played Napster in my
dorm, that was the deciding factor. I reached out and pulled Al

Gore's lever while the elephant clung to my arm in protest.

Many students gave their support to Ralph Nader in the
2000 presidential election because of his firm stance on

environmental issues.

I
Vice President Al Gore came to Pittsburgh in hopes of earning

Pennsy|vania’s much needed swing votes.

Chills

I first heard the Heinz Chapel Choir perform
at one of their annual Christmas Concerts in 1994.
Fifteen and sitting between my parents, I glanced
around in anticipation and marvelled at the
enormous height of the stone room and the
beautiful stained-glass windows that dwarfed the
members of the packed-in crowd. Their chatter
hushed and the conductor gave the sections their
starting notes. He sang to the women in their own
octave and, as a chill of excitement raced down my

back, I knew instantly I was going to listen to

something wonderfully unique.

The group still gives me chills, only now I get
them as a member, singing. These chills don’t occur
very often, though. They don’t come during our
Bellefield Hall rehearsals, when, in the course of 125
minutes, twice a week, we go over one phrase at a
time, one word at a time.

No, those moments come during concerts.
After months of sweating over those details until
you get them down, and when you can finally put
all of those details together, all of the effort goes
away, and you concentrate only on singing.
Looking around, you see your best friends standing
next to you, dressed in a tuxedo or a black concert
dress. We are all singing together, as one. In front of
you, the conductor is done working. He, too, is
simply feeling the music, simply along for the ride.

I smile. I’m proud of the group, and humbled to

be a member of it. And a chill races down my back.

David Turner

Left: The Heinz Chapel Choir tours abroad every
three years. Here, they share "Music of the
Americas” in 1998 with residents of the Abbaye Ies

Bains, a small town in France’s Loire Valley.

Right: Having purchased tickets months in
advance, audience members fill the pews of the
chapel for one of the annual holiday concerts,

seeking chills of their own.

tudents gather (and participate) in the '

of the most popular weekly events on

Right, Top: The Wang Chung Rule in action:

“Everybody have fun tonight!”

The unorganized mass of students stretched
the length of the Cathedral basement hallway as I

snuck into the middle of the haphazard line.

Mock brawls ensued as anxious students vied to
be the first ones into the Studio Theatre. Luckily,
I was able to snag a chair and I sat back in my
seat contentedly while the remainder of the
audience spilled onto the floor. My eyes fluttered

shut as 11 o’clock approached, and the stress of a

completed midterm week was just about to put
me to sleep when Ben Mayer, the current host of

As if dragging myself to
statistics after a tiresome day of
lectures and meetings wasn’t
difficult enough, I’m faced with
having to dodge ﬂying objects while
traipsing through Posvar Hall!
Shimmying bowling pins, soaring

rings, swaying unicyclists. They are

the Campus Fools, the people who

The mood is always light, fun, and focused

creatively and visibly express the on throwing large Objects at your friends-
chaos we all feel day-to-day. Enter-

taining throughout campus and the

local community, their goal is to bring a little bit of fun to even the most dreary of days.

Besides providing a lighthearted amusement for students around campus, the Fools have
been involved in a number of university activities including the Hand-in-Hand Festival,
Towerspalooza, Sutherland Springfest, and the University Alcohol Awareness Campaign. Aside
from campus functions, these talented entertainers are found performing throughout Pittsburgh.
They’ve performed halftime shows for Panther Football games, hospital benefits, Light—the-
Night Walk at Three Rivers Stadium, the Crohn’s Walk at Schenley Park, and much more.

“So you want to be a fool, do ya?” I was asked. “No juggling paraphernalia required, no
experience necessary.” The organization claims that in
just one meeting they’ll have you juggling to amaze
your friends, and after a few weeks you’ll be juggling
like a pro. Many of the current members came to the
first meeting not knowing how to juggle. I took the
challenge, putting stats on hold for a day. Whipping
Schenley fruit through the air has become my new

form of procrastination!

 nkl e in Tim e

In 50 years, a group of University of Pittsburgh
students will open up a time capsule which had up
to that point been encased inside the Panther statue.
Inside this capsule they will see Pitt memorabilia
that we hope will give them insight to what we
were like back in the day of 2000. The Pitt Program
Council is in charge of the futuristic project as well
as the many other events that occur each year at
the campus.

Most of us will be in our seventies fifty years
from now. That means these students opening up
the capsule will be our grandchildren. Inside the
capsule there will be a whole other world that they
probably only heard about in history class or on
the television.

One of the numerous items they will see is a
Pitt Program Council T-shirt and numerous "Rush"

T—shirts for different fraternities and sororities. One

wonders if they will laugh at our style of dress and

our fashion fauX—pas and proclaim, "I'd never be
caught dead wearing that," as we said about our
parents and grandparents’ clothing.

The students will also look at some pictures,
some which are scanned and others still in regular
photograph format. In these pictures there are
friends hugging each other and smiling broadly for
the camera. Will these students fifty years from
now know all about the movies that we were able
to see Wednesday or Friday nights at the William
Pitt Union, how it felt to be jam packed inside the
ballroom with all those other students? What
would they think of all the travel opportunities
students had in 2000, such as Cedar Point or
Panama City Beach, Florida? Will they know of
all the numerous speakers that visited Pitt this
year, like Newt Gingrich or Susan Hawk, a
former "Survivor” cast member? Will there be a
"Survivor" fifty years from now? Let us all wish

for a better future than that.

Lara Huffman

Along with the time capsule, the PPC offers a wide
variety of student activities every week, ranging from
nightly movies, to the annual Bigelow Bash, where
students gather on the sectioned off Bigelow
Boulevard to make T—shirts and browse through the

calvalcade of interesting booths.

All students owe a great big “Thanks" to“

the PPC for the opportunities to create:
memories over their years at Pitt. This
time capsule is sure to keep those fond

memories alive.

Guiding campus tours gives Pathfinders a great
personal satisfaction because they are conveying

their love for Pitt to incoming freshman.

Ask me how many windows are in the
Cathedral of Learning. Ask me the number of
volumes located in the Hillman Library.
Would you like to know the SAT requirement
for the Honors College or how many pounds
of fries from The O are sold a week? I am
capable of answering an indefinite number of
questions about the University of Pittsburgh
(2,529, 1.9 million, 1270, and 15 tons). I am a
wealth of Panther knowledge and quite
possibly love this campus just as much, if not
more, than any other student who ever walked
the streets of Oakland. I am a Pathfinder.

As Pathfinders, we are a student-run
organization that serves as the official tour
guides and ambassadors of the university. You
may see us walking backwards through the
Towers Lobby, guiding a group of prospective
students on a campus tour. Perhaps you met

me during a recruitment program such as

Panther Prints 2001

Introducing prospective students to the university is only one of

the many tasks that Pitt Pathfinders take on each days.

Honors Days, Pitt Pride Days, or a
Scholarship Program. Maybe you received a
phone call from one of my Pathfinder friends
as potential freshman, congratulating you on
your acceptance to Pitt. We are involved in
nearly every single aspect of the university,
especially those dealing with student
recruitment and Pitt Pride.

You’ll see us everywhere and anywhere on
campus, not only giving tours and running
programs for prospective students, but
involved in any and all aspects of
university life. We love each other, we
love our college, and we’d love to show

YOU our campus.

A Day in the Life of a Fellow

Her morning is no different than anyone else's. She wakes
up and showers just like a normal college student. As she
wonders about what the day will hold, she packs her bag full of
notebooks and pens. Leaving her house, she makes her way to
the Hillman Library. She can spend hours at a time just
researching one topic. If the results are plentiful, then she will
stay even longer. Her research covers the Modernist Period.
Lasting from the 1890s to the 1930s, this time period includes the
Industrial Revolution.

Cara Puff researched different theories of Modernist art and
literature the summer before her senior year. Five topics in
particular were the basis of her studies for the summer. By
researching clothing photographs, she was able to design her own
line. Without the Brackenridge Fellowship Program, she could

to do something I could only dream of doing," said Puff.

Although she was a literature major, her passion is sewing.

She never saw herself becoming a designer, but she thought

it would be fun. Cara then proposed an idea to
research and sew clothes. Her proposal was
accepted, and she was allotted a generous
amount of money for her research.

During the summer months of her
research, every Wednesday included a three-
hour meeting with the students involved in the
program. "It was very interesting to hear what
other students were doing, like neuroscience.
The program is a good way to learn about

different things," said Puff.

During Discovery Weekend, students were given the unique opportunity to hear from

Free Culture

Sitting near the front row, we are close enough
to see the sweat dripping from the foreheads of the
thinly clad dancers on stage. Their bodies contort,
wrapping around each others’ skins, the fluid
movements telling a story about their past. Jazz
music streams from the speakers on the ornate
walls of the Benedum Center into the ears of the
captivated audience, our eyes like magnets on the
enormous stage. Strong, expensive perfumes drift
into our noses. This is inspiration. This is art in its
purest form. This is the Martha Graham Dance

Company (Martha Graham being the “mother” of

modern dance).

This is not only an evening of art, it’s a true
escape from the streets of Oakland, from the
crowded Cathedral halls, from cramming for
exams. It’s a surprisingly refreshing change to wear
a little black dress or a suit jacket instead of jeans
and a sweatshirt. Of course, that strong perfume
smell is much better than the overwhelming bus
exhaust cologne of Oakland. It’s a free evening
dressed up, downtown, among fellow art lovers,
on a full stomach (meal provided by the program).
Pitt Arts passes out evenings like this one almost
every weekend, whether it be a popular musical, a
spicy play, a visit to a cool modern museum, or a
ticket to an outrageous foreign film. There is
always a mad scramble, as we write a quick e—mail
requesting tickets and then cross our fingers that
we’ll be the lucky ones to land them. After all,
these free tickets provide poor college students
with a great excuse to relax and take in the culture

of Pittsburgh.

Many Pitt alumni return to Pittsburgh annually for Jazz at Pitt.

I step out of the bitter cold air into what might be a
Joe Camel commercial. The lights are dimmed and I can
barely make out the outlines of the people strewn about
the room through the thick, smoky haze. As I gingerly
step around vintage couches and chairs filled with a
mixture of listeners, both college age and older, the beat
gets to me. The deep, clear sounds seem to vibrate
through my body and envelop me. Being an inclusive
hard rock fan, I am astonished that the sounds with a
title like jazz have so much entranced me. As I sip my
drink, I think, “Boy was I wrong about this! Forget
about Metallica and AC/ DC. Electric violins and
saxophones are the only way to go!”

This atmosphere, combined with the throaty shrills
of a saxophonist, can not only be found in a magazine ad
with a camel taking a drag from a cig leaning against a
piano. No, these jazz scenes are everywhere.
Pittsburgh's love for this music was especially found in
the University of Pittsburgh Jazz Concert held at the
Carnegie Music Hall in November. That night, sweet
melodies of a number of prodigy musicians combined
with the audience's pure joy made it an excellent
performance. If you missed that showing, there are
places in Pittsburgh to witness this craze, especially in
the South Side with clubs and bars such as Margaritaville
and the Lava Lounge. 50, if you want to delve into a
new cultural experience, hop the 54C Port Authority
bus and be led into an uplifting world that has nothing

to do with the blues.

The Infectious Variet

I trudge through the rain down Forbes Ave. toward the castle facade of
the Beehive. The bouncer inspects my license then stamps the whole top of
my hand with the word “UNDER.” When my eyes adjust to the bluish light
of the not—really—renovated movie theater, the sight is a peculiar one. The
walls are red velvety wallpaper, the ceiling purple and painted with eyes,
white and glowing in the dimly lit room. Sectioning off the bar from those of
us with UNDER stamps are wire fences, like those used at prisons yards but
without the barbed wire. My friend and I take seats in the folding‘ chair"
facing the stage, a makeshift wooden platform painted a dirty mauve color.

After a time, a scruffy guy with a stuffed animal lobster tied to his arm
climbs onto the stage. He announces the Infectious Variety Show, organized
to occur once a month, which includes but is not limited to live music,
poetry, short film, and performance art. Before all this begins, he urges
everyone to go over to “The Cage,” a small compartment
with a video camera where participants can do anything
they like for one minute. The resulting film will be
posted on the Internet, so he warns as well as dares the
audience to bare what they will.

As the performance continues, artsy people walk
around greeting their other artsy friends, including the
girl painting a large piece of paper stuck to the wall
with duct tape. A pink-haired girl ashes her cigarette on
the floor and kisses her boyfriend. The poets huddle in
one corner with beer in hand. Someone in drag walks
in front of the stage, and it’s hard not to notice that
she’s wearing Minnie Mouse ears adorned with bullets.

A few hours later, I step out into the rain again,
knowing I've left the Beehive with a taste of the eclectic

and sometimes strange Oakland culture.

General Motors. Ford. Chrysler. The Department
of Mechanical Engineering at the University of

Pittsburgh. What do they all have in common?

Zoom zoom.

With the smell of high octane in their noses and the
thunder of the speedway in their ears, Pitt’s talented
team of engineers beamed with pride as their race car
received ninth place overall at the national Formula

Society of Automotive Engineers International competi-

tion in May of 2000, held in Pontiac, Michigan.

In a series of intense and sometimes precarious races,
Pitt’s machine made them proud as it finished in the higher percentile in almost every performance category, includ-
ing design, endurance, and fuel economy. A tremendous accomplishment, the high ranking demonstrates the incredi-
ble dedication and commitment of the Pitt crew as their drive for excellence.

Each of the 118 cars from all over the country had to compete in the heated endurance race where extra gas could
not be added, nor could the tires be changed as the car zipped around the threateningly tight course. Stopping only
to switch drivers, No. 32 plowed through the 22 kilometer course to complete the race in prestigious fourth place,
adding another notch to the tally that eventually led to their impressive national ranking of ninth.

In its 12th year of competing, the Pitt team never finished this high. Coming in under budget and boasting a list
of devoted sponsors eager to see their hometown vehicle do well, the car was constructed with tough steel alloy

tubing, a powerful Honda motorcycle engine, and muscled racing fuel.

Though the oil stains will dry and
the smell of burning rubber may fade,
the thrill of twisting through the speed-
way and crossing the finish line will
drive the team’s ambitions for years

Holding a plastic miniature of the real thing,

the brain is the focus of Jacob Nadler’s research.

Goldwater

Jacob Nadler, in between juggling his final semester’s classes
and his graduate school interviews all over the country, works in
the lab of Dr. Carol Colby. Jacob and Colby, an associate
professor of neuroscience, study things like working memory and
the way that your eyes actually see. The work in Colby’s lab tries
to determine how the brain functions normally. Her lab isn’t
trying to find cures to diseases, although knowledge of normal
functioning can lead to understanding of how and why things go
wrong when they do. Her lab tries to determine how brains do
the things that most of us take for granted, like identifying a
friend’s face or committing a person’s name to memory.

Jacob is one of Pitt’s four recipients of the Goldwater Award, tW“"‘
which recognizes undergraduates with outstanding academic Kathleen Schaefer spends another
achievement who are engaged in research. The other recipients are afternoon in her chemistry lab.
Kathleen Schaefer, Chris Farrell, and Brian
Ruskin. In addition to their full schedule,
including Inorganic Chemistry, Functional
Neuroanatomy, or Vertebrate Morphology, these
students dedicate their free time to the discovery
of something undiscovered. When undergraduates
do research, they have the chance to add to the
knowledge base of science. They have the chance
to answer a question that has never been
answered before. They have the chance to add a

Valuable skill to their resume and the chance to

prepare for a rewarding and challenging career.

Remember sitting on the puffy couch in Starbucks.
Remember being surrounded with friends, all chattering
away about the movies they've seen, the books they've read,
and the places they've traveled. Remember helping each
other with homework and complaining about roommate
dramas. It isn't hard to remember, is it? We all did this kind
of stuff in our normal routine at Pitt. Now try
remembering it
all in Spanish!  t h e 

To the
Brazil Nuts Portuguese Club and the Spanish Club, this was
all part of their college reality. Every Week the groups met
and let their tongues loose, practicing Portuguese and
Spanish While learning more about the Brazilian and Spanish
cultures. Being involved in the Latin American student
organizations provided comfy atmospheres to sink into
another set of customs and learn all about them. Think
about honoring Dia de los Muertos (Day of the Dead) every

November. Imagine setting up an altar and celebrating the

life of someone who recently passed on. Or how about
sampling yummy ethnic foods at La Fiesta on Friday nights,
and having a chance to gab in Spanish while you’re at it?
Imagine dancing the night away at the Latin American and
Caribbean Festival, executing the samba moves perfectly.
Watching foreign films, eating foreign food and speaking in
foreign languages all aid in the quest to understand these

lifestyles.

Gina Acquavita

Not all Latin American organizations are just

about language — they also celebrate various

cultures with fashion shows, dance

workshops, and other fundraising events.

I settle down with a granola bar mocha, a
cacophonous mixture of coconut, espresso, and
cinnamon. Sleep, the dream of any college
student, is Warded off by the mystical substance
known as caffeine. Hopefully this will be
enough to keep me awake as I suffer through
my human physiology notes, but I will
probably have to invest in a caramel macchiato
with, of course, lots of whipped cream. Some

nights I start at Cafe-Au-Lait on the South Side

then need a change of scenery and head over to

Dancing Goats in Shadyside, 61C Cafe in Squirrel Hill, or Kiva Han in Oakland. Some nights I study at home,
picking up a latte from the Starbucks right around the corner from my apartment. Poor days lead me to the
cappuccino machines of 7-11, but no matter where I am, the nearest location of coffee is etched in memory.

Also ingrained in memory are Breugger’s, SchWartz’s, and Einstein’s. Bagels hold the same exalted position as
coffee. The only problem with bagels is deciding Where to get them. Most people seem to have very strong opinions
of Where the best bagels and best prices can be found, but there is one thing for sure. Who doesn’t get a smile on their
face when they Walk in for some breakfast and a fresh batch of their favorite bagels has just come out of the oven?
Bagels for breakfast or dinner. Coffee for early morning classes and- late study nights. Both of them taking a seemingly
insignificant amount of the college student’s budget. Think about it for a minute. Suppose you routinely drank the
cheap $1 coffee at 7-11 for five days a week, 15 weeks a semester, 30 Weeks a year (more during finals). That came out
to $150 a year. If you spent $3 a day on a
mocha from the Beehive or Craig Street Coffee,
then you were facing $450 a year, probably
more than a month’s rent, but absolutely Well

worth it.

Little Bit of Faith

A kl‘ N Y ’ I b t‘ ! .
Spar mg ew ears Gee ra Ion The basement to the Cornerstone church on Fifth

Avenue is brimming with activity as many people chat in
groups on the green and brown tiled floor. So many
students have come together to gather in this one place for
a specific purpose: to praise God. Folding chairs are lined
up in a row facing the stage and as soon as the music
begins, the crowds disperse and find a seat. There's a band
up on stage along with a male and female singer. The
guitarist slowly nods his head in rhythm as the couple sing
from their lyric sheet. The students stand up while the
music plays. Some enthusiastically clap along while others
quietly sing along with the words projected overhead on a
screen. Some close their eyes and sway back and forth with

their hands up in reverence. Different voices in the crowd

104 Panther Prints 2001

can be heard belting out the upbeat contemporary
Christian songs along with the singers onstage.

This is only one example of how religion takes place
on a college campus. The Chi Alpha Campus ministries
held a Coffee Circle where discussions like Evolution
versus Creationism or Moral and Situational Ethics Were
held. The CrossSeekers, a Baptist Campus Ministry, began
its fourth year at Pitt and also held joint worship services
with students from CMU. Students could attend mass
amidst their school schedule at the Ryan Catholic Newman
Center Pittsburgh Oratory. PSALM, a student
organization based at the Lutheran University Center on
Forbes Avenue, had breakfast together on Sundays before
they held services in the morning. There are still many
other religious organizations on campus and part
of the journey is to find one that is right for the

individual student.

Lara Huffman

Hillel sends students to Israel each year to explore

their religious heritage .

Some students need a simple moment of prayer to help them get

through their hectic lives.

Teamwork and discipline, the cornerstones of any

working environment, are prominent and essential

in the Air Force.

Faﬁgued

"Two weeks down, two more to go," thought the
cadet as he overlooked the calm glistening ocean. The sun's
strong rays beat upon his forehead and he could feel the
beads of sweat forming on his   entire body ached
and he could feel his black leather combat boots causing
new blisters on his feet. The rip-stop nylon camouﬂage
fatigues seemed a thousand times thicker under the i90-

degree sun. He looked longingly at the sandy white

   
  

beach and wished he could just relax, but
he knew he couldn't. After
all, he hadn’t left Pitt
for Panama City,
Florida to relax, he was there
for the Air Force ROTC field training.

As he continued to run, he thought about how the strict
mandatory rules had changed him. Each day, he needed to
make his bed with perfect hospital corners and he had to
arrange all his possessions in his locker. Even his socks
were neatly placed in the drawer, rolled in a specific way so
they were "smiles up." He was always required to be clean
cut and shaven. He never thought the day would come
when he would be organized and tidy.

He felt a sharp pain in his side so he worked harder to

keep up the pace with the rest of the cadets. Running

wasn't his favorite activity; he preferred the written tests
about military knowledge from one of his academic classes,
or going through marching drills. He then compared

running with basic training and decided it was a toss up. He

  
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 

never seemed to be able to crawl through the mud and
barbed wire without getting snagged and hurting himself.
It was getting harder to stay positive and not let the
yelling and orders get him down, especially when he only
slept six hours each night. He never had much time to rest;
even his meals were timed. The pain in his
side slowly spread and his leg was getting a
cramp. He wanted to collapse, but his
determination wouldn't let him as he thought,

"Only two more weeks."

Paulina Huang

Despite the demanding drills and early mornings,

these men and women are still able to find time

to just hang out.

The Wild Outdoors

My bags are packed, and I am ready for the long drive.

My friends and I pile into my small car and escape the city traffic.

Occasionally, I take my eyes off of the road to admire the
diverse beauty of the autumn trees. The sight is breathtaking and
relaxing. Finally, the highway transforms into dark, windy back
roads. Upon reaching South Scenic Drive, we roll down the
windows allowing the cool fall air into the car. The smell of nature
creeps inside right along with the country air and the sounds of the
creek water and small animals. My friend who owns the camp
fumbles through his pocket for the key as we stand behind him
with armfuls of sleeping bags and munchies.

While the guys are warming up the grill, the girls are preparing
the house for the weekend. With the radio blaring,

we eat a dinner of hamburgers and hot dogs outside by the

campfire. The sun begins hiding behind the tall trees, and a sky of
stars materializes as we sit chatting in the cool evening air not

. . . Esca in cam us forada ora
noticing the time. We roast marshmallows and play spades under p g p y

the porch light. The guys decide it will be fun to watch bats dive at weekend lets the Stress me" away"
the water, so they begin throwing rocks. As the
bats determine the position of the airborne pieces
of earth, they begin diving through the trees to
catch the movement.

Whether the event is camping or picnicking,
the weekend quickly comes to a close, and the
laughing and fishing become a memory until
next time. Too soon, it is Sunday evening, and

we're forced to head back to school to prepare

for the daily grind.

Tamara Simpson

With the tent finally up, dinner can now be started!

It has just turned 10 a.m. on Monday

Another hour flies by. Another class passes quickly.

when you drag your body, coffee in hand,
into the large lecture hall slowly filling with
other sleepy students. You’re an English
major, or a history major, or a studio arts
major. You are not a science person, never
have been and never will be, and yet you
find yourself in this class called “The
Natural Sciences.” You can’t quite figure
out how you got here, but vaguely

remember the day you picked up the course

selection guide and arbitrarily picked a class
with the dreaded NAT symbol next to it. Now, syllabus in hand, you’re looking at words such as chemical
bonding and radioactivity and thinking that add/ drop period isn’t over yet.

The professor comes in, pulling behind him equipment that is as foreign as the words on the page in
front of you. As you yawn and prepare for an hour of vocabulary that has eluded you since eighth grade, he
begins to demonstrate the inner workings of a doorbell. Your curiosity is surprisingly sparked, and your
yawns fade away as you strain to see his next demonstration. The class goes by quickly, and as you walk
out, you wonder what demonstration awaits on Wednesday.

lt’s tough to find fun gen ed classes, but sometimes you unwittingly stumble into one that catches your
attention. It might be history of jazz, taught by a man who speaks like jazz sounds, with a slow laid-back
quality that lulls the mind. It might be sculpture class, requiring that you manipulate a block of Styrofoam
into a work of art. It could be intro
to performance, where you get a
better grade the more you “act
out.” Whatever class it is, enjoy it,
and learn from it, because you
never know when the knowledge

might come in handy.

I am actually standing on my head. I haven’t even attempted
this move since I was ten years old, but then again, neither has
anyone else in the dance studio. Bodies clad in boxer shorts, t-shirts,
and flowy jazz pants fall onto the colorful mats spread over the
floor. As we listen to the slow, soothing music on the stereo, we
follow our instructor’s movements (well, we try, at least). Legs
wrap around waists, arms reach to the sky, and breathing follows a
pattern. This is harder than it looks. This is yoga.

We leave the class after a long meditation, relaxed and centered.
As I wait for theshuttle, my friend joins me. She suddenly grabs
my arm and deftly twists it around my back, triumphant as she
forces me into the hold. She has just come from the popular
personal defense class.

Students pour from the doors of Trees Hall, full of energy and
chattering away. Girls leaving water aerobics with wet hair and
armfuls of towels. Those coming from volleyball class are still
sweating. The crowd from step aerobics is talking without regret
about how sore their legs will be tomorrow.

The choices of physical education classes at the University of
Pittsburgh were endless. For stressed-out students who needed to
blow off steam, there were classes like fitness kickboxing, Tae
Kwon Do, and judo. Ballet, modern, jazz, and musical theater dance
were great for those who had artistic abilities and the desire to get
down and boogie. We could even take a dip in the pool and earn a
lifeguarding or scuba diving certificate while we were at it. As for
the students who couldn't get enough of the cold weather, Pitt
offers classes in snowboarding and skiing.

Most of us remember how the freshman fifteen felt, those foreign
pounds quietly latching onto our stomachs and thighs without our
knowledge. The physical education classes at Pitt offered the

solution. The perfect way to have some fun and move that body!

“ACTION!”

My instructor stops, mid—sentence, at the shout from the
hallway. She glances at the door, a smile spreads over her face, and
a chuckle escapes her throat.

“Boy,” she says, “that’s why I love this place. That’s how you

cables or running through someone’s scene. I
love it.”

We get back to class. I’m there for
Screenwriting, but there are dozens of other
classes going on, all week at Pittsburgh
Filmmakers. A non-profit organization,
Filmmakers is an equipment and space access
center for independent media artists. The
school offers professional training in
filmmaking, photography, and many other
aspects of media arts.

Pitt students majoring in Film Studies
take many classes at Filmmakers due to the
fantastic relationship between the schools.
Pitt students are given many opportunities to
explore and create artistic endeavors,
opportunities not available at many other
universities.

My instructor continues with the
nuances of script form as a loud “CUT!”
slices through her words. She glances again at
the door.

“Yup, gotta love it.” She pauses.

“Someone close the door.”

Headlines & Dea lines

They say newspapers are the rough draft of
history. I guess you could say college is the rough
draft of your adult life.

7796 Pitt News is a place where both come
together. Every day, it circulates 14,000 copies of the
University’s unfolding story. But it’s also central to
the lives of the people who work there. And for
those of us who started at 7796 Pitt News and have
now moved on, the memories are central to the way
we defined our college years‘ and how we define
ourselves now.

The Pitt News stands for many things. It’s about
journalism, long hours, and making friends. It’s
about teamwork and growth. But most of all, it’s
about history.

I have a copy of every Pitt News in which I

published a story. Sometimes I think ahead to the

days when, long after I’ve graduated, I’ll get them

out, read them, and reminisce.

I’ll thinli about the lump in my throat when I — I  jl «
l filed my Very: first story, and how thrilled I was the I if
next morning to see it on the front page. I’ll think

about the fir ;t byline I ever had as a staff writer.

One Weekend a Month

Some students earned their college
tuition by blowing things up.
Once a month, Pitt students
enlisted in the Army National
Guard attended weekend—long

training sessions at military bases.

Students loans, grants, and
scholarships were pretty much the standard, but many college students joined the
Guard to earn money for school. Besides the investment in their college life, these i
students also earned an experience unlike any other.

Teamwork, discipline, and organizational thinking are skills that are learned, used,
and remembered once graduation has come and gone. There are many alternative ways
to pay for tuition, but only the Guard provides these life and career oriented

abilities—and the chance to blow things up.

The September return to a new semester was
never welcome, when the long hot days were still in
full swing and it doesn't seem time to be hitting the
books again. The first few days of fall were always
welcome. The hot city pavement was tolerable at
first, but it was nice to have a break from the humid
nights without air conditioning.

The beautiful fall days and cool nights suddenly
turned into Pittsburgh rain. Rain poured down for
days. Raincoats and umbrellas replaced shorts and
tank tops. Eventually, the winter coats, hats, scarves,
and gloves replaced the raincoats. It snowed for 20
days in a row. As students, we braved the elements
every day, every hour in transit from class to class.
We tried to schedule all our classes in the same
building, but it couldn't always be done. Pittsburgh
winter seemed like it was going to go on forever.
The smokers huddled outside the revolving door of
the Cathedral's ground floor hunched over with
lighters that wouldn't light because the cold wind is

too strong. We complained about the weather

snack outside the Union.

all the time. We waited at bus stops, huddled -
under awnings, hid under our hoods trying to

keep the rain and snow out of our frostbitten

faces. The winter months clouded the sky, and

we were glad that exams kept us occupied in

the warm heat of the library.

The snow and rain finally stopped. The
trees on campus started to show a little green
and the Cathedral lawn was the reason to skip
your next class. Every Pitt student, no matter
how much they loved snow, looked forward to
this first warm afternoon, perfect for
lunch with friends and people
watching. Throughout our years
here, we got used to the cycle, the
blistering heat and the chilling cold
and all the conditions in between.
It's part of our day, part of our year,

and part of our campus.

Classes, jobs, parties, friends,

memories. It is hard to say goodbye to it

all in just one day.

April 29, 2001. This used to be just another date
in the future, another empty space on the calendar.
But for the seniors at Pitt this year, it means a lot
more these days. It means we will receive a piece of
paper telling us we are free to go where life will take
us. It means it's Graduation Day.

At first, the thought of this day was so frightening
I considered staying an undergrad just a little longer.
Staying in the safety of an arranged schedule, loans
paying my rent, and discounts to events with my
Panther Card didn't sound so bad. The thought of
putting together a resume and job—hunting was
enough to make me laugh. After all, what could I do?
I might be graduating, but I couldn't tell you what
my future holds.

But then it hit me. I've earned this day, my
graduation. Suddenly, I felt proud. I have survived
four years of studying almost every night, writing
huge research papers, reading thick textbooks and
long novels, not to mention going to class every day.

I have learned something. I have made

accomplishments, as have every one of my
fellow seniors. As we embrace the future with
our education in hand, we leave behind the
struggle to fit classes into our schedules at
registration. We forget the search every
semester through the course description book.
We sacrifice the fight to fit into the
overcrowded elevators in the Cathedral and
the workout from marching up Cardiac Hill.
We say goodbye to midterms and crashing
computers with our term papers stuck inside.
We might be a little afraid of life
after Pitt, but we have conquered
college life and we are armed with
knowledge. We are proud to have
the University of Pittsburgh on
our resumes. So April 29, 2001,

bring it on!

A successful four years is reason enough to celebrate.

Farewell

Congratulations Class of 2001! It is hard to believe that graduation has arrived when I can still 1
remember my first day on campus so clearly. What makes the transition much easier for me, and I hope
for you too, is my many fond memories of Pitt. I look back on all the exciting events that happened
around us 

Our final celebration at Pitt Stadium, motivational lectures led by accomplished leaders like Maya
Angelou and Mike Ditka, our victory against Penn State for the 2000 Homecoming, and the launch of
Pitt’s Capital Campaign and Discovery Weekend. It is a great time to be here as the university and the
city of Pittsburgh make history by beautifying and enhancing the resources in our community. I am
proud of the progress our university has made as well as the accomplishments of the exceptional students
Who make this university one of the best.

In my years at Pitt I chose to get involved on our campus through Student Government among other
student organizations. The opportunities this involvement afforded me also brought about many changes.
My attitude, perceptions, patterns, and habits have been greatly impacted from my interactions with my
peers, faculty, staff, administration and the members of the Pittsburgh community. I have learned to
appreciate our many differences and have been inspired by the education of experience. The relationships
you Will build in your journeys will ultimately influence the path of your life more than anything else. If
you value these relationships your life will be much more fulfilling and successful.

You have all made my experiences at Pitt unforgettable and my memories irreplaceable. I Wish you
all the best of luck in your future and hope all of your hard work pays off and your dreams come true.

No matter Where you travel, you should know you will always belong and be a part of this community.
Hail to Pitt!

Joan Snyder
2000 President, SGB

From the Executive Director

 

Dear Class of 2001:

I would like to extend to you both my congratulations and a hearty
welcome to the Pitt alumni association. As you can see on page 137,
membership in the alumni association benefits both you
and the University of Pittsburgh. One of the most
important things we do is help keep you connected to
your Alma Mater.

You probably think of the association in connection

    

with Homecoming and perhaps Lantern Night or Night

R . of the Panther. We are much more than that. The
Leleand D. Patouillet

leadership of this organization is a vibrant, successful,

dedicated group of volunteers. We have become a partner with the University

to pursue five strategic directions in concert with the plans of Chancellor Mark

Distinguished alumni such as Professor Derrick

. . , . .
A. Nordenberg and the University s Board of Trustees. Communications, Be“ Often Speak at alumni association functiona
Governmental Relations, Membership, Outreach and Fundraising, and Student
Recruitment. In many ways, we have been raising the standard at Pitt and can
boast of significant strides in all five areas.

The Pitt Alumni Association is extremely proud of its new home in the

Masonic Temple, across Fifth Avenue from the Cathedral of Learning. Stop in

when you are in Oakland. We would love to show you your home on campus.

If you find yourself far removed from Pittsburgh, }O11’1 us virtually The alumm assoclanon hosts alumm at bow

games and other athletic events.
by going to www.azlumm.pztt.edu and registering for the Pitt i ~

Alumni Online Community.
One Way or another, keep in touch. Remember, you are a

student for a limited period of time but you are an alum forever.

Alma Mater, wise and glorious,

Child of Light and Bride of Truth

Over fate and foe victorious,

Dowered with eternal youth,

Crowned with love of son and daughter,
Thou shalt conquer as of yore,

Dear Old Pittsburgh, Alma Mater,

God preserve Thee ever more!

First beyond the mountains founded,
Where the west-road opens free,
Where twin river, forest bounded,
Merge and journey t’ward the sea;

In the dawning of the nation,

Ere the clouds of strife had cleared
‘Rose thy rough-hewn habitation

By our prophet fathers reared.

Alma Mater, wise and glorious,

Child of Light and Bride of Truth

Over fate and foe victorious,

Dowered with eternal youth,

Crowned with love of son and daughter,
Thou shalt conquer as of yore,

Dear Old Pittsburgh, Alma Mater,

God preserve Thee ever more!
