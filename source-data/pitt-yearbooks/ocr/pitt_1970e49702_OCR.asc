When one looks at Pitt, he looks at Oakland. They are one entity and imﬁossible to

separate. As you enter the area, attention is drawn toward the Towers. T ey’re big,

majestic, and stately. T y’re impressive, but unfortunately the entire university is
not like this. The Quad and Union are among the oldest and ugliest buildings

 

in Oakland. They do, however, form a contrast to our main cam us; that is, our one
block of grass around two other unique structures: Heinz Chape and the Cathedral,

with the forboding Commons Room within. This is the nucleus of our university. It
is here that We spend most of our time. This is the Pitt that We shall never forget.

Also standin among the landmarks of Oakland is Forbes Field, ancestral home of
the Pittsburg Pirates. As the Three Rivers Stadium now replaces Forbes, an era

of Pittsburgh tradition has also ended. No longer will there be the opening day
crowds or the World Series hopefuls ﬁlling the streets each summer. No more will

the Pirates beat a foe. Forbes Field will soon be just another vacant lot.

 

“In the year twenty—ﬁve twenty—ﬁve. If man is still alive. If woman can survive,”
they probably did not live in Pittsbur h. It may seem odd to say this, but to live
in Pittsburgh is to live in pollution. T e air appears clearer but it IS no cleaner.

Steel mills continue to blow their sulfur dioxide into our lungs; our rivers grow
ﬁlthier day by day; streets become littered; and slum areas increase. “In the year

When we returned to campus last September nothing really had changed. Oakland
“was as dirty as ever; one could see the same old men in bars and stores and on the

street corners. Life was to carry on as usual. The essentials of life were to be
accumulated: an extra case of beer for the refrigerator and some rah-rah football

term, with that carefree college life. The police looked cautiously at us and
wondered what was to occur. Would the students riot against the Vietnam War or
protest the tuition increases? No one knew, but we soon found out. The Pennsylvania

Legislature and Governor Shaffer had refused to settle the budget question. A lack
of money would cause the University to curtail many of its projects and services,

or even close if the problem was not solved. It was not until March — nine months
later — that a budget did pass, and we knew at least for the time being, we were safe.

Dr. David Brown
Mathematics

Unfortunately, I do believe that this past year was the
ﬁrst of many years of ﬁnancial problems for Pitt. Until
the entire tax program of Pennsylvania is overhauled, I
see no hope for a long range ﬁnancial solution for this
university and for higher education in general. (If my
ﬁgures are correct, the commonwealth has over 150 sep-
arate and unrelated taxes). In my estimation, the key in-

gredient for such a tax reform is a personal income tax.

I believe the ﬁnancial future of the university will be
austere at least for a couple of years. We will see no new
expansion in terms of either personnel or facilities.

I hope, as a result of this dilemma, that the university
community will take an active role in the elections for
state legislators.

It was during this period that our traditional six Great Professors were selected

and asked to comment concerning “the University and its past ﬁnancial crisis . . .

Dr. Myron T aube
English

The University has just gone through another ﬁnancial
crisis. Soon it will go through another. The only uncer-
tainty is when. The reason for the inevitability of the
crisis is obvious: money. Pitt needs money.

The problem is not so much economics as philosophy;
not procedures but priorities. If it were a question of in-
com etent management, we could throw out the rascals
an bring in competent men. If it were simply a question
of maximum utilization of space, we could maintain Forbes
Field as an outdoor lecture hall. The problem is more com-
plex. Given the mish-mash quilt-work pattern of Penn-
sylvania politics, it is almost impossible for Harrisburg

to work toward established goals.

If it is only incidentally important that this university is
vital to the economic life of Pittsburgh; politicians, busi-
nessmen and those who work here understand this kind of
dollars and cents talk. More important is that the Uni-
versity is one of the few institutions in the country still
sensitive to the needs of the peo le. But will society sup-
port an institution whose beneﬁfts to the community are
vast, but often not immediately visible? Will Pitt alumni
support nancially the institution that has been the spring-
board or much of their success? It is all a question of
values.

will this be a recurring situation, and if so where does the future of the University lie?”

19

Dr. Harry J. Werner
Earth and Planetary Sciences

Since I don’t know much about the details of the Uni-
versity’s ﬁnancial problems, I suppose that I ’m qualiﬁed
to speak as an expert. It seems to me that many of our
present day experts, on both sides of the so—called genera-
tion gap, who speak with a great deal of authority on
various subjects really don’t have much ﬁrst-hand experi-
ence in matters in which they prcjifess to be experts. I ’m
better qualiﬁed to talk about roc s than about ﬁnancial
crises. Nevertheless, I suspect that the University is here
to stay, and I suspect until the day of a complete tax-
payers revolt the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania will
continue to help defray the expenses of the University.

University education is becoming more and more on a
par with high school education — probably in more ways
than one, but I ’ll attempt to stick to the subject. Every-

body, or almost everybody, goes to high school. We are at
the age where ever body, or almost everybody, will be go-
ing to college, an the responsibility of paying rests on the
State, or more precisely on the taxpayer. However, it seems
to me that the run-of-the-mill taxpayer who is putting the
money into the pot is becoming more and more unhappy
with the manner in which that money is being spilled out
of the pot.

Education is one of the better ﬁnancial investments that
we, as taxpayers, can make. The return on educational
dollars comes back many fold by way of uture taxes and
the development of a greater number 0 responsible citi-
zens. The real crisis is not ﬁnancial, but rather the need
of development of a greater percentage of responsible
citizens.

Question: “the University and its past ﬁnancial crisis . . . will this be a recurring

20

   

Robert L. Donaldson
Political Science

Of late it has become increasingly apparent that the
American university is far from being politically sacred;
for several years this has been demonstrated in other sec-
tions of the country, and it has now been brought home
to us. T he future of the University of Pittsburgh may de-
pend, in part, on the recognition of and the reaction to
this loss of privilege — but it has to be emphasized that
we know little concerning the magnitude or nature of the
problem at present.

The [970 response 0 the University community should
not serve as a mode. The behavior of many individuals
and sectors in the University ranged from undirected panic

to focused paranoia. The problem was compounded by
the fact that students, faculty, and administrators re-
vealed a rather low level of acquaintance with political
institutions and ractices in their own state, and we cannot
aﬂord to regar this as nothing more than a comment on
t e machinations of some power elite. We were, most of
us, pathetically baﬂled and unaware and, what is far
more serious, not much ingenuity was evident in our
search for remedies. This commentary is a plea for an
eﬂort on the part of the University communit to ser-
iously ponder our relationship with our politica environ-
ment — the 1970 eﬂort cannot be regarded as a serious
one.

situation, and if so where does the future of the University lie?”

21

Dr. James H. Hartsock
Petroleum Engineering

It would take an extreme optimist to believe that the past
ﬁancial crisis will be other than a recurring event. The
problem will arise continually until both the public and
their legislative representatives recognize the need for a
long-term planning and budgeting system for higher ed-
ucation in the state.

The impact of these recurring crises on the future of the
University will depend on their frequency. If they occur
yearly the adverse publicity will discourage the better high
school students from attending Pitt. These are the students

whom we are currently seeking to attract. I can also
envision a continual turnover of junior faculty members for
lack of research support. If the crisis occur every four
years, each graduating class will experience the problem
only once and the adverse publicity would discourage
fewer students. In either case the University could not
implement new programs and existing programs could be
drastically curtailed. Either alternative is undesirable
andl am hoping that the state will soon improve itspolicy
toward higher education.

Question: “the University and its past ﬁnancial crisis . . . will this be a recurring

22

Dr. John G. Wagner
Mechanical Engineering

There seems to be few outward indications that the
University’s ﬁnancial crisis will not be a recurrent
problem. While possibly of lesser magnitude the situation
will be no less signiﬁcant in its eﬂects. Many possible
solutions have been pondered running the gamut from
reversion to a private institution to participation in a
fully state related university system. In any case, it is
the responsibility of the University to actively seek an
acceptable solution concomitant with its goals or ob-
jectives.

   

The concept of a partially state supported budget may
well be the best compromise, provided the basis of that
relatedness is itself well founded. Realistically, it is most
diﬂicult to put [forth and maintain an image approved by
the votin pub ic. Such an ima e is, however, most neces-
sary wit in the ramework of our present system. The
compatibility off such a requisite with the pursuit of
knowledge and excellence in higher education remains
to be seriously examined.

When you consider the past year and all that has occurred, it’s really diﬂicult

to comprehend where this University is headed. We have seen much; some we
are proud of, but much is disgusting. It has been a year of transition, of change,
of revolution. It is a year this University will never forget.

There were the normal things, things that any other year would have really
excited us — a 4&6 football season; a .500 basketball team. This year these seem
so unimportant compared to everything else that has occurred. Everyone waited
to hear the draft lottery: to know once and for all what his number would be.
The lows were depressed; the highs, ecstatic; the middles, well, as uncertain as
ever. When Nixon came out favoring the elimination of all future occupational
deferments, even those presuming themselves safe, gave up hope. Then, the
November Moratorium tried to tell our feelings against war — someone else’s
war — but still it goes on, not just in Viet Nam but Cambodia, too. Cambodia,
another major crisis; students throughout the nation felt that all their work for
peace had been in vain. For all those marches and speeches and pleas for peace,
What did we get? More killing — more American soldiers ﬁghting in now another
area of Southeast Asia. Campuses revolted, more buildings were taken and then
came Kent. Kent State, an unknown college in Ohio became the focal point of
campus demonstration. Trigger happy National Guard troops killed four students.
It wasn’t important who these students were, just the fact that they were students,
like us, demonstrating on their own campus against a war many of them would
soon be ﬁghting in. If they could be killed there and then at Jackson State, where
would be next? True, things were peaceful here at Pitt — but probably only
because the Winter term had ended and few students were here in the Spring. If
this disaster had occurred at any other time in the year, Oakland would have been
jammed with students — students who might also have demonstrated and also
have been killed. Bruce S. Barr

What is the OWL Hall of Fame?

It is not an honorary where past members
select present ones.

It has no meetings, no initiation fee, and

no obligations for its members.

It is seniors selected by juniors —

seniors who have made a notable contribution
to this Universitiv. They are chosen

for what they have done and

not the titles that they have held.

When the members are selected, they are

not asked ("filter desire this recognition,‘

began the year with a series of innovations.
The biggest was the formation of their ﬁrst
varsity basketball team, equipped with a mar-
velous cheerleading squad. A new bookstore
was instituted with lower prices and, believe it
or not, more books. Innovation was one of the
key words for the Little Theatre’s productions:
audiences had to be accommodated oﬂ" campus,
costumes were used, scripts were updated. It
appeared to be a good year for these students,
so far, yet so close, to Pittsburgh.

The year I970 saw the University of Pitts-
burgh at Johnstown achieve another long
sought goal in its development as the largest
regional campus of the University of Pitts-
burgh. After lengthy planning and prepara-
tion, academic requirements were met and
approval was granted by the School of Educa-
tion to establish a four—year curriculum in
both elementary and secondary education
ﬁelds. It marked the ﬁrst time in the history of
this forty three year old institution that a full,
four year degree program was offered
olf the main campus. Similar expansion for
other! programs is now under discussion.

Winter enrollment was just over 1400 full-
time students. Another 400 were on part—time
study status and 55 were enrolled in graduate
study. Physical plant growth also continued. A
$2 million library, with a capacity of 200,000
volumes, is under construction and due for
completion in Spring 1971. A fourth dormi-
tory is in operation and a ﬁfth one is nearing
completion.

Titusville campus of the University of Pittsburgh
is presently in a massive expansion, improvement,
and reﬁnement program. The present dormitory
houses 156 men, but a new women’s residence will
open this Fall. It will be the latest concept in dorm
living, containing twelve townhouse apartments,
lounges, snack areas, study rooms, and extra bed-
rooms and baths. The dining room in the men’s
dorm will accommodate both residence halls. Em-
phasis is currently placed on Engineering and Lib-
eral Arts, however, new programs are being insti-
tuted and others discussed.

To belong to something is as vital a part of
college life as study itself. It really isn’t impor-.
tant whether it’s a publication or a fraternity.
an honorary or a club; organizations are a
necessary part of learning.

The Owl

When one thinks of a yearbook, what is visualized? Is it
a one volume book of sports, seniors, and clubs? Is it an
extremely idealized View of your university? If these are
your ideas, we disagree. The stall of the 1970 OWL feels
that yearbooks should be a true reflection of the pre-
ceeding year. A year such as we have just experienced,
necessitates a yearbook revolutionary in nature; a book
expressing our reactions to the events of a very
“un—traditional” phase in our lives.

The Pitt News

Perhaps the major criticism of daily newspapers throughout
the nation is the charge that they are “establishment”, i.e.,
supporters and promoters of the status quo. But a growing
trend in the ﬁeld is the advocacy of journalism, an orientation

to social change. The student newspaper has an important _

role to play — a role that combines representation with lead-
ership. Change always germinates with the small and grows
into the large, as the pioneer breaks the ground for the road
or the school. The Pitt News staff recognizes this need . . .
its obligation to inform, its right to advocate, and its duty to
reflect. But there is a bigger task, a necessity to take the per-
forated segments of a fragmented society and make sense of
them. He must take the possibility of a closed, ﬁnacially
drowning University and speculate. He must study the expan-
sion plans and then talk to the people who might have to
move. He must demand respect and strike if he has to. So

here’s where we come in — as infallible interpreters, amateur
analysts, and “prime movers.”

The Pitt Capsule, the ofﬁcial magazine of the School of
Pharmacy is published three times each year. As a
professional journal, it supplements the in class training
of pharmacy students by presenting a variety of articles
concerning research and development in drugs as well
as reports from pharmaceutical conventions. The maga-
zine also offers national drug companies the opportunity
to advertise their products and employment opportun-
ities. In addition, The Pitt Capsule devotes special at-
tention to the developments being made here at Pitt
and to the news, class activities and the special programs
that are offered within our excellent School of Pharmacy.

In the year 1807 a concerned group of student reac-
tionaries crossed the Mighty Monongahela to put down
a rebellion conducted by a hostile group of Apache for-
eign students from the Berkely campus. The Indians
were destroyed and as the last one bit the dust he was
heard to cry contemptuously, “Poh—lar—us”l, which is
Apache for “VVe1come to the University" (sure, I just
bet it is). Anyhow, having a nice ring to it, this phrase
was immediately committed to memory by the reac-
tionaries and brought back to the campus of the Pitts-
burgh Academy. When the need arose for a title of a
publication which would carry a message to all mem-
bers of the University community, especially incoming
students, “poh-lar-us” was deemed by all to be the logi-
cal choice. Forthwith the first Pohlarus charter was
drawn up, and through the ages evolved the Polaris.

Today standing upon nearly 165 years of fine tradition,
under the expert direction of Joel Hurwitz and Bob
Tronzo, the Polaris remains humbly dedicated to the
original cause which it has thus far so nobly advanced.

The Skyscraper Engineer is the official publication of
the School of Engineering. Basically, this magazine con-
tains material written by students and professors and is
of technical nature. However, it also contains research
at the University, construction in and around Pitts-
burgh, alumni events, a page of super mathematical
problems (with a reward offered for correct solutions),
and a photographic article about a Pitt coed, known as
the “Technicutie”. Engineerls VVeek is covered in the
ﬁnal issue.

to date on all the national regional, local, and

Om of The fourth floor of Schenley Hall is the center of stu-
Ce dent publications at the University. It houses publica-
. _ tions ranging from the newspaper to the yearbook to
  the literary journal. The place is alive with discussions
from politics to psychiatrists to sex. Late at night or
between classes staffs are running helter-skelter to un-
dermine the University Hierarchy or to meet a day-
before deadline. Mrs. Esther Kitzes, Director of Student
Publications is responsible for guiding these publications
toward honest and responsible journalism.

Alpha Epsilon Delta is a national premedical and pre-
dental honorary society open to both men and women.
It attempts to acquaint the student with the motives
and ideals of medicine and works to advance the stu-
dents’ academic achievement and medical interest.

Our chapter stresses active membership through a full
and rewarding program of prominent speakers and
modern technical ﬁlms open to the entire campus. In-
cluded in our program this year were tours of medical
schools and hospitals, operating room observations, and
various community projects, such as an attempt to inter-
est more black high school students in the ﬁeld of medi-
cine.

Alpha Zeta Omega Pharmaceutical Fraternity was es-
tablished in 1919 at the Philadelphia College of Phar-
macy for the purpose of graduating one-hundred per-
cent of its members. Since then, some sixty chapters
have been established throughout the world to promote
scholarship, professionalism, leadership, and l)rother—
hood. The chapter at the University of Pittsburgh was
established in 1928. Many of the fraters who helped to
form the Pittsburgh chapter have continued to be active
in Alpha Zeta Omega, and five National presidents have
come from Mu chapter. Membership is open to
pharmacy students of outstanding character and leader-
ship ability. Alpha Zeta Omega’s activities have in-
cluded the backing of Synanon, a self-help program for
drug addicts, scholarship programs, continuing educa-
tion seminars in pharmacy, and providing funds for
frathers in times of need and emergency.

20

The purpose of Cwens is to foster leadership, scholar-
ship, and the spirit of service; to promote friendship
among women of the sophomore class; to encourage
leadership among freshmen women by helping them in
their activities; and to serve and promote the interests
of the University in every way.

Cwens have served during the last year as ushers for
Chancellors Receptions; by working with Mortar Board
to distribute “Care” packages to dorm residents during
ﬁnals; by Christmas carolling at the School for Blind
Children; and by hosting a tutoring program. Alpha
Cwens seek “activity of thought, receptivity to beauty
and humane feeling.”

Druids

Established at the University of Pittsburgh in
1916, Druids recognizes and encourages scholar-
ship, leadership, service, and character. Member—
ship is open to all sophomore or junior men who
have had a major leadership role on campus. Also
tapped to Druids are outstanding professors who
have shown a great interest in the students and
the community. Each spring, Druids taps a Sopho-
more and a ]uni0r Man of the Year. This year,
they held a “Draft Symposium” open to all stu-
dents, where the entire community was given a
chance to voice their opinions on the draft and
deferments.

Kappa Nu also honors the most outstanding new profes-
sor in the Electrical Engineering department. The x

abreast of new developments in the Electrical Engineer-
ing ﬁeld.

Mortar Board is the only national Senior Honorary for
Women; this organization has been active on Pittis
campus since 1923 and attempts to select its members
for their scholarship, leadership, and service at the
University. These ideals are put into action through var-
ious programs dealing with current problems and issues.
This years Mortar Board strove to be relevant; thus,
membership has meant more than merely accepting an
honor. The group co-sponsored a series of Career Semi-
nars, where experts from various fields came to the
campus to provide first-hand vocational information.
Another example of Mortar Board’s commitment to the
University community were the “VVhite to \Vhite”
conferences, which were geared to examine racism.

Omicron Delta Kappa, a national honor society, seeks to
recognize outstanding individuals within the university
at both student and faculty levels. Members are tapped
for excellence in any of the following ﬁelds: Scholarship,
Athletics, Social and Religious Affairs, Publications, or
Speech, Music, Radio and Drama. The society has
brought recognition to both junior and senior men who
have made a significant contribution to any of the fore-
mentioned areas of campus life.

Omicron Delta Kappa annually selects a senior “Man of
the Year.” The 1970 award went to Omicron Delta
Kappa president, David Guydan.

The Circle holds luncheons and dinners with university
and community figures in the hopes of bringing a
greater awareness to the group.

Phi Eta Sigma is the national Freshman honor society
which taps those full—time male students who attain a
quality point average of 3.5 or above during their first
term at the University. In addition to recognizing aca-
demic excellence, Phi Eta Sigma sponsors a university
wide tutoring program. This special service is adminis-
tered on a voluntary basis and is designed to meet the
needs of the tutee. Phi Eta Sigma also recognizes mem-
bers who have continually achieved outstanding aver-
ages at Tap Day each year.

Sigma Theta Tau is the national Nursing honorary now
represented at the University of Pittsburgh. This group
works to instill the high levels of responsibility that all
nurses throughout the country must have. Through dis-
cussion groups and speakers, the girls learn not only
what is new in their ﬁeld, nursing, but also in the medi-
cal Held in general.

Army ROTC

The Basic Program of the Army Reserve Ofﬁcers Training
Course is designed to give men a good foundation in military
science as well as an understanding of the role of the military
in national and world affairs. After his second year, a cadet
may elect to continue in the advanced ROTC program for his
remaining years in college. Admission is highly competitive
and is based on his scholastic standing both academically and
military, his estimated potential for leadership and a physical
examination. Upon completion of his four year course, a
cadet is commissioned as a second lieutenant in a branch of
the Army of his choice. VVhile attending the advanced course,
a cadet learns to apply the basic principles of military leader-
ship that he learned in the basic course and he learns the
organization and operation of the modern Army. The military
year is climaxed by the annual awards ceremony recognizing
the outstanding cadets and the Military Ball, the only Univer-
sity—wide formal event.

Beta Chapter of Alpha Phi Omega, a national service
fraternity, sponsors projects to beneﬁt both the Pitt stu-
dent and the surrounding community. The annual Ugly
Man on Campus contest provides funds for several
worthwhile charities. The book exchange affords the
student an opportunity to buy used books at a reduced
rate and also allows him to sell old ones. A bulletin
board and cards for advertisements is another APO ser-
vice. The brothers of Alphi Phi Omega, in all their ac-
tivities, adhere to the high principles of friendship,
leadership and service.

Associated
Women
Students

The advent of women’s liberation and other feminist movements
on campus has brought the plight of today’s woman out into the
open. Highlighting AWS activities for this fiftieth anniversary year
was a symposium in March entitled “Women Do Dare!" The
three-day symposium featured lectures, workshops and panel dis-
cussions on topics ranging from abortion reform to civil rights to
the peace movement. Featured speakers included Congresswoman
Martha W. Griffiths from Michigan, F lorynce R. Kennedy, an at-
torney from New York City affiliated with the Congress to Unite
Women, and Mrs. Dorothy B. ]ones, founder and co—chairman of
Another Mother for Peace. The symposium involved not only stu-
dents, faculty and other University personnel, but also those of the
Pittsburgh community as well. Deemed a success, the symposium is
hopefully a mere beginning for much greater awareness and in-
volvement on the part of women in the University community.

In addition to the symposium, the AWS council, along with fresh-
man council, took an active stand in campus issues and events. The
council sponsored Fred Storaska’s lecture on prevention of assaults
and co—sponsored Freshman Camp. This year marked the ﬁrst year
that Freshman Camp became co—ed. Mentor camp, the mentor
program, activities fair, and lantern night were among the tradi-
tional programs carried on .

Whether in front of a crowd at a football game or a
pep rally, the cheerleaders are the source of enthusiasm
and spirit for the Pitt athletic teams. In blue and gold,
these spunky individuals initiate the cheers at the foot-
ball and basketball games. Aided by the antics of the
costumed Panther, the cheerleaders attempt to intensify
the enthusiasm of the student body and to keep it at a
fever pitch until the ﬁnal seconds of the game. The girls
also participate in Freshman Camp, Orientation Week,
and aid in public relations promotions. The squad is
chosen on the basis of ability, appearance, and poise.

The Engineering Student Cabinet is the student governing body of the School
of Engineering. This organization is responsible for all engineering stu-
dent-related affairs with the University. The Cabinet is comprised of 24 stu-
dents. Each of the eight departments within the school have three representa-
tives, a senior, a junior, and a sophomore. Governing the Cabinet are ﬁve
officers elected from within the Cabinet; for the academic year 1969-70 are
the oflicers, Chairman Richard Edgecombe, vice-chairman Gil Kleinerman,
secretary Dennis Yeskey, treasurer ]ohn Gira and plant director Ed Gergerich.
Included in the E.S.C. are the four Student Government Senators, Chairman
of Engineers Week, and the editors of the Engineering Bulletin and Skyscrap-
er Engineer.

In years past, E.S.C. has maintained excellent relations with the administra-
tion and faculty of the School of Engineering. This cooperation is accom-
plished through the faculty advisor, Professor William Conturo and through
student representation in Dean’s meetings, faculty meetings, and Executive
Committee Meetings. This involvement keeps the cabinet well informed on all
changes which might affect engineering students. The Cabinet, in turn, relays
all pertinent information to the students.

The future of the Engineering Student Cabinet is one of continuing inﬂuence
of students on all issues concerning the University. With the new engineering
building, Bendelum Hall, due for completion, the School of Engineering will
be united under the same roof. The result of this will be more cooperation of
the students in Cabinet and a better student-administration relationship.

Thanks to the girls of Gamma Sigma Sigma, Pitt stu-
dents need not starve during movies at the Common
Facilities. Besides selling candy at movies, the members
of this service sorority initiate numerous small projects
for the improvement of the campus, serve at banquets
and parties given by the Chancellor, help with the an-
nual UMOC dance, and sponsor drives for charities. The
girls often give parties at Children's Hospital and they
devote a little time every week to the elderly at Negley
House. The members of the sorority choose a pet cause
and donate all receipts from their booth at VVinter
VVeekend to that cause.

The notoriety of the Men’s Glee Club, oldest extracur—
ricular organization on campus, soared as the group
completed its 80th season. Led by an energetic Presi-
dent, Gary Cummins, the 40 men experimented with a
lighter and more informal tone.

Under the direction of Phil Cavanaugh, a young musi-
cologist, the Glee Club sang such avant garde numbers
as “The Clam” and Copland’s “Song of the Guerillas”
as well as Poulenc’s difﬁcult “Chanson a Boire” and the
popular “By the Time I Get to Phoenix.”

Throughout the year, the men adhered to a rigorous
concert schedule, performing for alumni and high
school students as a service to the University, in addi-
tion to presenting good—will programs at a church and a
mental institution. At the end of the winter term. Pitt’s
troubadours traveled to Washington, D.C., Detroit, and
the South as part of the Club’s annual ten day spring
tour.

Culminating the season was a landmark performance at
the Miss Pennsylvania Pageant in Hershey, viewed by a
statewide television audience.

Men’s Dorm Council, the representative group of men elected from those living in
the dorms, is the legislative body of the Towers. MDC serves both cultural and
comforting purposes, sponsoring a range of activities like speakers, TGlF’S, and in-
tramural sports coinpetitions between houses. Freedom is the key word for the
dorms, now, with unchaperoned open houses every day and night. Girls have free-
dom in the dorms also, ofﬁcially 12 to 12, unofficially much longer.

In the past year, the Housing Board has worked long and hard to acquire more free-
dom for Pitt women. As of last fall, the individual womens dorms were permitted to
determine their own open house hours. In the spring, all curfews for upper class
women were abolished and freshmen were introduced to the Self Regulatory Cur-
few System. In the future, Freshmen women will have curfews only until Lantern
Night, then will switch to SRCS for the remainder of the year.

It is the duty of the ]udicial Board to review any infractions of the housing rules. A
Resident woman is given the option of accepting penalties imposed by the head res-
ident of her dorm, or of appealing her case to the Judicial Board and'_abiding by
the decision of her peers. "I

According to the Quaz by—laws, the purpose of the
organization is to “promote interest in science in the
student body as a whole and to promote a spirit of
comradeship among girls in the ﬁeld of science.” The
initials stand for “the Quest for Unity in Advance to-
ward the Unknown”, 21 name which the girls feel states
their purpose very clearly.

During the past two yearsn the group has been inactive,
but when faced with disbanding the girls decided to
reorganize. This year they revised the tapping proce-
dures. Now anyone who is interested in working for
Quax and is eligible is taken in. This procedure elimi-
nates the snobbery usually attached to honorary soci-
eties.

The girls work on projects to improve the facilities for
women in the science buildings. They also bring a series
of lecturers to the University to discuss various current
advances in the ﬁeld of science. Next year a lecture on
“The Prevention of Cancer in Women” is planned.

Over one hundred members of Quo Vadis serve as host-
esses for the eighteen nationality rooms and Heinz
Chapel. Tours are given throughout the year which
center around historical and cultural facts concerning
the room and its country. During the year the hostesses
meet with the representatives of each room to help
decorate it in its ethnic colors for the Christmas holi-
days. To promote interest in international affairs, the
organization offers scholarships for outstanding mem-
bers to study abroad. Besides their regular duties, the
members serve as hostesses at the annual Commence-
ment exercises in the spring.

It is the job of Pitt Hosts and Hostesses to give campus
tours to prospective students. It is through this first
meeting with a Pitt student that the high school seniors
form their most lasting impressions of the university. It
is up to the Hosts and Hostesses to describe life at Pitt,
keeping in mind that often their answers help the pro-
spective student decide whether or not to come to Pitt.

The William Pitt Debate Union, under the direction of
Dr. Thomas Kane, participates in traditional, parlia-
mentary, and public series debates tournaments as well
as individual forensic programs.

WPDU operates an outstanding public debating pro-
gram in its high school assembly series. Opponents for
this series are selected from most of the leading univer-
sities, including the Ivy League and Big Ten.

A typical debate year includes 45-50 trips throughout
the United States, Canada, and Jamaica. As well as en-
joying other schools’ hospitality, WPDU annually hosts
the Collegiate Cross-Examination Tournament and the
Invitational High School Tournament as well as guests
from the United States, Canada, ]amaica, and ]apan.

VVPDU members have won honors as state debate
champions, and in recent years have won nation recog-
nition in individual oratory.

The Student Union Board is composed of students who
assume the planning function for all activities con-
nected with the Student Union. As a programming or-
ganization, the Board relies on the creativity and effort
of its student staff and members.

SUB is composed of four committees, each with a chair-
man. The Public Affairs Committee under chairman
Kathy McKo0l presents distinguished speakers of inter-
est to the university community. The committee also
presents forums, debates, panels and documentary films.
Under chairman Cindy Alesaini, the Social Committee
offers dances, movies fashion shows, the Pit Coffee
House and the Miss University of Pittsburgh Pageant.
There is also a concert each term sponsored by the SU.
The Committee On The Arts, better known as COTA,
under the chairmanship of Bruce Hadburg sponsors
programs in the performing arts, including concerts, for-
eign film series, art exhibits, dance programs and multi-
media workshops. The Public Realtions committee,
chairmaned by Robert Leap provides publicity and
advertises for the committees. It also provides represen-
tation for the SUB at University wide functions.

Locally, Delta Tau Delta has remained one of the strongest fraternities at Pitt with
over seventy members. The brothers function around as scholarship, community
service, athletics, and social events. Over the past year, the Delts have raised their
house average considerably. They sold bottles of shampoo to raise funds for the
Children’s Hospital during Creek VVeek, thus helping them take a second place in
overall Greek Week. Dominating league “A” fraternity sports, they collected over
500 points more than the second place fraternity. First place trophies were awarded
for softball, football, basketball, volleyball, swimming, and track. Along with numer-
ous parties at the house Delta Tau Delta collaborated with AEPhi for a spaghetti
dinner, held mixers with other sororities at Pitt, and had a winter weekend with
dates at Mont Chateau. The path for a bright future will continue to unfold when
one becomes a member of Delta Tau Delta.

Phi Kappa Theta, with approximately sixty brothers, strives for
the goals of friendship, relevancy, and brotherhood. Through
participation in intramural sports, Homecoming, Winter Week-
end, and Greek Week, the Phi Kaps build lasting friendships
with the brothers and sisters of other fraternities and sororities.

Involvement in campus organizations not only broadens our re-
lations with others, but contributes to the University commu-
nity; over the past year we have tried to become relevant within
the Pittsburgh community as well through service projects. A
car smash before the Notre Dame game and a “Bounce for
Hearts” drive raised over $1000 for Children’s Hospital and the
United Heart Fund.

Brotherhood, intangible and invaluable, is built over a period of
time, through pledging and during membership. Lifetime bonds
are developed by an active pledge program, active participation
in campus activities, and active house functions.

VVe believe Mu chapter of Phi Kappa Theta strives, through
diversiﬁcation, contribution, and sincere dedication, to attain
our goals of RELEVANCY, FRIENDSHIP, and most important,
BROTHERHOOD.

This year has brought many beneﬁcial changes to Pi Lambda Phi. Winter
VVeekend highlighted the activities, along with avid participation in the
intramural sports program, Homecoming and Greek VVeel<. The fraternity
also boasts a high scholastic average with members of the Druids, Omicron
Delta Kappa, the Pitt News, the VVilliam Penn Debate Union, and several
members of the Student Government. There exists a feeling of transition,
that continues to grow and ensure the basis of genuine brotherhood.

The brothers of Sigma Alpha Epsilon are identiﬁed by three distinct qualities:
fraternity spirit, academic awareness, and participation in student affairs.
Spirit is an integral part of every brother, all succeeding in winning 1970
VVinter VVeekend and placing high in Homecoming and Greek V\/eek. Aca-
demic excellence and achievement are encouraged, ascribing to the theory
that a man can neither improve himself nor his fraternity if he cannot main-
tain a respectable average in his studies; thus, scholarship is the key to success.

The brothers of Sigma Chi feel that fraternity is based on the
brotherhood of men with all temperaments, talents, and con-
victions; and this has resulted in one of their most successful
years at Pitt. Their Derby Day was praised by all Greeks and
the general University community. They prospered in Home-
coming, Winter Weekend, and especially in Greek V\/eek in
which they won a first place in fun Night and a second in the
chariot race competitions. The Sigs continued to show their
athletic ability not only in intramurals, winning a first in “A"
wrestling and a second in “A” football, but also in varsity
sports. The year was highlighted by a Laurel Mountain
ski—winter weekend at Green Gables.

This past year was one to be remembered for Zeta Beta Tau. It was a year that
began with experimentation and ended with success. ZBT took the first step toward
abolishing the pledging system by instituting a neophyte policy whereby those who
were seeking initiation and those who were already brothers maintained a relation-
ship of equality.

Socially the Zeebs were as active as ever, with roller skating, all night bowling,
track, and cocktail parties supplementing the standard booze and band affairs.

The brothers of ZBT distinguished themselves during the past year. Among them,
Michael Zagorc was named Mr. Pitt, the third year in a row that a Zeeb has re-
ceived the award.

Greek Week, however, was the high—point of the year of the fraternity. ZBT was
awarded the Interfraternity Scholarship Plaque, which goes to the fraternity with
the highest quality point average. At the concert, the fraternity was honored with
the Chancellors Cup, designating Zeta Beta Tau as the best overall fraternity on
campus. Finally, ZBT was proclaimed winner of 1970 Greek Week.

Panhellenic Council, the governing body of sororities, is
composed of two representatives plus the president of
each sorority. The maintenance of good relations among
the groups, encouragement of scholarship, maintenance
of high social standards, and regulation are a few of its
purposes. Under president Liz Zicherman, a new set of
rush rules was instituted shortening the rush period,
thus leaving more time for individual activities. Other
Panhel activities include Panhel preview for freshman,
a scavenger hunt for the winter pledges and a picnic for
the fall pledges. Together with IFC, Panhel sponsored
the Chancellor’s Dinner in October, a dollar a plate
spaghetti dinner for charity, a Greek dinner in the SU
ballroom, and a successful Greek V’Veel<.

“No girl is an island, no girl stands alone.” Such is the belief
of Alpha Delta Pi — a belief which is put into practice as the
ADPi’s joined together to participate in University events
such as Homecoming, Winter Weekend, and Greek Week.

This year Alpha Iota Chapter celebrated its ﬁftieth anniver-
sary during which the sisters entertained both alumnae and
other guests. Other social events included a formal dinner
dance, a Christmas party, and a senior dinner. Scholastic
achievements included receiving the Scholarship Trophy pre-
sented to the sorority having the highest overall quality point
average. The ADPi’s have also joined together in providing
service to the Pittsburgh community by making “touch—me”
books for the children at the School for the Blind. Along with
their involvement in sorority, many Alpha Delta Pi’s were ac-
tive in University organizations including AWS, Pan—Hel,
Quo Vadis, Student Government, and Mentor groups.

The sisters of Alpha Delta Pi enjoy doing things together and
enjoy new friendships which broaden their own lives — for no
girl is an island.

The sisters of Alpha Epsilon Phi have channeled the widest
variety of talents and interests into a force which has been
felt by every part of the University community and the Pitts-
burgh area. Feeling the pangs of the plight of the American
Indian, the sorors sold themselves to the community in a
“Rent-an—AEPhi” program to raise the much needed funds
for these people. They all participated in the Leisure Learn
program and helped at the local community center. The div-
ersity of the group can be seen from the fact that they won
first place in Sigma Chi’s Derby games and in the homeco1n—
ing banner competition. Through mixers, a dinner—dance at
the LeMont, parents weekend activities, and undying spirit
during Homecoming, Winter Weekend, and Greek Week, the
sisters of Alpha Epsilon Phi have grown together in a bond of
friendship and understanding.

Chi Omega is a group of individuals whose talents interweave for
the success of the sorority. Scholastically the sorority has a high
average: one member attained Phi Beta Kappa, two were tapped
to Omicron Sigma Rho, the Panhellenic honorary. Sisters were
sweethearts of Phi Gamma Delta, Delta Sigma Phi, Delta Tau Del-
ta, and Sigma Alpha Epsilon. Chi Omegas were Homecoming and
Greek Week Queens. Chi Omega received the third place award in
the Winter VVeekend Carnival Booth and received first place for
over-all Greek Week. The sisters worked with the Fijis to give a
party for some needy children of the area as their service project.
All the sisters enjoyed Ski Weekend at Laurel Mountain and the
many mixers with fraternities at Pitt and Carnegie-Mellon. This
year was a very rewarding one for the Chi Omegas. A lot of hard
work and enjoyment made the year a success.

The sisterhood of Delta Delta Delta provides its members with the
opportunity to grow and learn in an atmosphere of friendship and
understanding. The fresh and lively spirit of the group thrives on
the ideas and opinions of individuals which are shared and appre-
ciated. Tri—Deltas participate in a wide range of campus activities
— Cwens, Thrysa Amos, Student Government, and Freshmen
Orientation. Many hold oﬂices in such groups as AWS, Panhellenic
Council, and Mortar Board, while others participate in Greek
Week committees, dorm activities, and theatre. The sisters ﬁnd lei-
sure time for swimming, archery, dancing and painting while work-
ing to take third place in Greek Week and second place in Home-
coming banners. Diversiﬁed interests and talents can be found at
work in Tri—Delta in every activity. In Tri—Delta the enjoyment of
sorority activities such as the winter formal, hayrides, dances, ser-
vice projects, and overnights in the suite is something to always be
remembered. Sisterhood in Delta Delta Delta is sharing, learning,
and growing, and the members are proud of their sisters and of
their sorority.

For Delta Phi Epsilon this year has been one of sincerity and
closeness entwined with the enthusiasm of involvement. The
sorority sponsored informal discussions with professors, cookie
sales for cystic fibrosis and Children’s Hospital, lunches for par-
ents and alumni, and dinners at The Edge and The Bigelow. The
big events of the year — Homecoming, Winter Weekend, and
Greek Week — revealed the spirit and hardworking nature of
each sister. Individual members participated in Quo Vadis, Stu-
dent Union Board, Pitt Hosts, The Pitt News, and the mentor
program. In recognition for their scholastic achievements, sisters
were tapped into Cwens, Quax, Mortar Board, and Phi Beta
Kappa. With the tremendous momentum of a great year behind
them, the sisters of Delta Phi Epsilon anticipate a very success-
ful coming year.

79

 

The object of this sorority shall be to unite its members in
the bonds of sincere and lasting friendship, and to stimulate
one another in the pursuit of knowledge, to promote the
moral and social culture of its members and to develop plans
for guidance and unity in action . . . ” These high ideals of
Delta Zeta’s founders are embodied in our participation in
campus events, philanthropies, and just plain old good times.
The sisters participated in Homecoming, Winter Weekend,
and Greek Week, winning Greek Sing, and held a brunch
during Parent’s Weekend. DZ also helped with the Christmas
and Easter parties at the Pittsburgh Hearing and Speech So-
ciety. We had our fun and good times at overnight parties,
our Christmas dinner-dance, and our Spring Formal. In every
respect, Delta Zeta is an adventure in friendship.

Kappa Alpha Theta as a beneﬁcial group to the University of Pittsburgh stresses
three important attributes: enthusiasm, individuality, and awareness. Thetas have
always taken a deep interest and shown much enthusiasm in all phases of activity,
Pan Hel, AWS, Cwens, Mortar Board, Freshmen Orientation, Homecoming, and
Greek Week. Besides taking part in the activities at Pitt, the Thetas have tried to
bring other groups closer to the University, such as the foreign students who are
studying at the English Institute of the University. These services have also ex-
tended to the community. This includes voluntary assistance to the Blind School,
entertaining and collecting toys for needy children during the holidays, and assisting
with the collection for the various blood drives. Thetas feel that by working through
the true bonds of sisterhood and friendship, they can broaden each individual per~
sonality. Kappa Alpha Theta has been beneficial as an organization and it has made
each life fun and a worthwhile experience during the memorable years at Pitt.

The Keys to Kappa Kappa Gamma are unity yet individuality. The individuality
of each sister brings a variety of interests to the group and provides the spirit,
strength, and friendship which unites us. The Kappas enjoyed participating in
University events this past year such as Homecoming, Winter VVeekend, and
Greek Week. Also Kappa sponsored several community activities such as “adopt-
ing” a family at Christmas, Christmas caroling at Children’s Hospital, and hold-
ing a party for the blind school with the Delta Sigs.

Active is a word which can describe a Kappa. The activities of some of the sisters
range from Student Government to PanHellenic to cheerleaders to Cwens and
Mortar Board and Miss University of Pittsburgh herself. The versatility within
the group combined with a pursuit of loveliness makes Kappa Kappa Gamma a
warm, shining place that shines as the Kappa key each sister wears.

Now that the 1970 OWL is almost ﬁnished, it’s hard to
believe that after four years in this office, I must say
good-bye to 400 Schenley Hall. There are a lot of me-
mories in these walls: a lot of good times and a lot of
grief. I can remember my first year here, tracing layouts
for the ’67 OWL and then all of a sudden I jumped into
being Layout and Associate Editor for the ’68. That was
quite a year — tempers raged and rum flowed, but some-
how we did get a book done. Pat a11d Earl, I owe
yo11 a great deal for those years of experience. Then
there was the ’69 — that was my book — my first year
as Editor—in—Chief. Many say it was a revolutionary
yearbook; many don’t believe it even was a yearbook.
Maybe those past years were just training. Maybe all
that time and energy has culminated in a new form of
yearbook production. Who knows? All I know is I’m
proud of the ’70 OWL; whether anyone else likes it, Tm
pleased with it and I think my staff will also be pleased
when they see the product of their labors.

Last year my staff criticized me for doing too much, so
this year I tried to keep everyone informed of what was
happening. It’s true I probably did more than they
wished; but every Editor tries to do as much as possible,
and then complains because of a lack of help. Al-
though at times we seemed to be understaffed, I can’t
complain about those I’ve had to work with. First, and
foremost, there is Mona, officially she was my Associate
Editor, but she was so much more than that. Although
she began the year as just a sounding board for ideas
and a shoulder to cry on, she is now my ﬁance. She is
the most important of many things that I must thank
The OWL for. If she approves of this book, no one
else’s opinion will really matter.

Next must come Bob, my faithful Photo Editor. Al-
though I bitched about our photography, it’s the best
I’ve seen since coming to Pitt and I know he deserves
most of the credit. Carol, as usual, came through when
The OWL really needed her help. Her last minute so-
cial copy and continued work throughout the past few
years will never be forgotten. \Vendy, too, one of my
newest staff members, was a blessing during last Spring’s
deadline period. It seemed that she and Karen were
kept busy typing as fast as I could write.

Two additional photographers that I feel I have to
thank are Biff and Paul. \Vithout Biff most of the organ-
izations would still be unshot and without Paul those
last minute shots just wouldn‘t have been taken. Mike
too, 1m1st be mentioned; his capable management left
little to be desired. Also in the line of business, Chip,
Cindy, Harry, and Ira deserve much thanks for their
assistance. Martha Hartle must also be noted for the
excellent sports copy that she wrote.

My ﬁnal two ‘thanks’ go to Larry Pirnie and Sylvan
Pinto — both of the American Yearbook Company.
Larry has been a constant friend and great aid in pro-
ducing the past two yearbooks. I wonder what they
would look like without his guidance. Syl, too — a new
friend, was very helpful. Good luck with Pitt next year.

I think I’ve mentioned just about everyone of impor-
tance. If I’ve missed anyone, well, I’m really sorry. It
feels so strange to be ﬁnishing this book. It’s now two
months after graduation and I already feel different.
Although I'll be here at Dental School for four years,
I’ll never be an undergraduate again and I’ll never ex-
perience the things I’ve experienced again. Now that I
think back about this year, it has really been the grea—
test ever. I wrote in the beginning of the “Pitt???” book
that this was a year few would forget. I know that I
shall never forget this one, or the preceeding three
either.

Chip, now I come to you. All I can say is “Good Luck”
and do the very best you can. The OWL is a great insti-
tution so always remember: Don’t just edit your book,
live it" .

Pitt and Oakland are one entity in the same.
The presence of one part inﬂuencing the
other. The area is one of old and new. Build-
ings that stood before the existance of the
university juxtaposed to modern sandstone
and glass. Forbes Field, soon to be a relic,
provides the character and life of the area.
From April 'til October, the Pirates die hards
cheer on their team, then engulf Oakland
when the game is over. Like bees swarming
from a hive, theirs is the hustle and bustle
typical of visitors to Oakland.

Oakland's inhabitents consist of area chil-
dren, dirty old men and students. Grade
school boys selling newspapers contrast to
the older men hanging around on street cor-
ners, making it known that they saw the
pretty girl who just walked by. In front of
every bar stands a group of men slightly
staggering from the spirits they have been
consuming since the bar opened at 8 AM. A
few other men may be found at the corner
of Atwood and Forbes, fraternizing with the
grub at the paper stand.

  

Here to obtain a degree, the students wander
aimlessly looking for kicks, action and mean-
ing in their lives. And after they graduate,
what does it all mean?

Spare time is divided between classes and stu-
dy, bullshitting, movies and eating, and finally,
barhopping. Every student in the university
has seen at least one or both of this year's
movies at the King's Court, Bob and Carol and
Ted and Alice or Easy River. Then, he has a
choice of about 5 identical places to take his
date for a hamburger afterward. Or to a bar.
Each bar is frequented by mostly the same
people, who may even have their own stools.
Quite the same in their dark, dingy drunken
atmosphere, patrons of each constitute a
family, the bar being its home. This social life
is open to any student, since no one is ever
carded. The raids are few and far between, and
hardly ever taken seriously. The smell of beer
is overwhelming, and soon is acquired by the
patrons.

Homecoming has changed with the
times, as has the university. Years
ago, alumni returned en mass to
school to see old friends, rehash old
times and go back to the old frater-
nity house for a few drinks. It was a
time for not only reminiscing but
bragging about present accomplish-
ments. It was a time for the alums.
The school now is not the same as the
school they knew. No one returns for
homecoming anymore, except for
maybe the first year after graduation.
It has become another undergraduate
social event, a time for a special game,
a concert and a good drunk.

HOMECOMING

Homecoming this year could better be de-
scribed as wet and disappointing. The loss to
Notre Dame was no surprise, but the weather
at least could have been nice for the slaughter.
Spirit ran high as FI]I's Patty Zepfel was
crowned Homecoming Queen. Banners replac-
ing the traditional ﬂoats in the parade added to
the disappointment. The tragedy culminated
with an unsatisfactory Vanilla Fudge concert.
Instead of songs, the group played with their
instruments. Homecoming ended with the
audience thinning out before the concert was
over.

When entertainment is selected for a
university, many things must be consid-
ered. There is nothing worse than an ex-
pensive group putting on a shitty,
non-professional performance. A few of
the artists were good, but there was not
much diversity.

Pete Seeger, one of the mainstays of folk
music, and possibly its guiding light was
his usual brilliant self. His humor and
distinctive sound blended for a delightful
evening. Peter, Paul and Mary, around for
their annual Pittsburgh visit, gave their
usual professional, lively performance.
Ian and Sylvia, along with Tom Paxton

performed a barely acceptable show, the

former a little worse than the latter. Final-
ly, the Vogues, local boys from Turtle
Creek, produced a poor Lettermen immita-
tion.

The two good concerts available to the Pitt
student were not even sponsored by the
university. If it weren't for some outside
promoters, our mediocre entertainment
would be worse.

Amateur students pooled their talents to
turn out professional productions of R0-
sertcrantz and Guildenstern, We Bombed
in New Haven and other equally excellent
ones.

 

 

\ .

among the best live drama in Pittsburgh.

 

Although the university musical
entertainment can be branded as
poor, its illustrious list of speakers
more than compensates for the de-
fecit. Both entertaining and infor-
mational, experts in their respective
fields fascinate the audience with
their knowledge, humor, insights
and biases. Speakers are drawn
from all areas of society and there
is surely to be at least one speaker
to interest every individual.

The most colorful speaker by far,
and possibly the most controversial
was William Buckley. The rubber
faced and multi-gestured host of
the TV talk show Firing Line fasci-
nated the audience with his quips
and sarcasm. A noted conservative,
Buckley is editor of the National
Review, an ultra-conservative pub-
lication.

Other speakers, though not so illustrious,
include Congressman William S. Moorhead,
Pa. Democrat who spoke on the Military
Industrial Complex; and biting ﬁlm critic
Iudith Crist, presented as part of Flicks and
Flickmakers Week, who defended her high
standards and generally uncompromising
positions. Arthur Schlesinger, ]r., Special
Assistant to President Iohn Kennedy and
noted author and historian, presented the
audience with his frank views and brilliant
analyses. The first Negro to integrate the
University of Mississippi, Iames Meredith
presented his views on Racial Peace in Ame-
rica. Author and attempted athlete, Goerge
Plimpton fascinated all who heard with his
zany experiences. Stewart Udall, ex-Secretary
of the Interior, described his concept of the
"New Conservation.” As the watchdog of
the consumer, Ralph Nadar presented the
audience with his crusade for higher indus-
trial standards.

Mr. ESP, The
Amazing Kreskin,
astonished all present
with feats of mental
telepathy. Iohn Tabor,
unsuccessful Pgh.
mayorality candidate
discussed his views as
did Abbie Hoffman of
the Chicago 7 trial.
Nate Smith,
Pittsburgh Black
leader also spoke.

When one envisions a Winter Weekend, one
imagines sledding, skiing, snowball ﬁghts,
skating — lmaybe renting a winter- resort.
Pitt's Winter Weekend includes none of
these. There is not even the inclusion of a
snowﬂake in the festivities. It's only claim to
winter is that it is held during winter term.
Maybe the weekend should be renamed car-
nival weekend.

As it now stands, it is one of the various
special weekends sponsored by Student
Government, but proved no better than any
other special event. It all began Friday night
with a mediocre concert by the little known
Butterfield Blues. Breaking tradition, the
Winter Weekend committee decided to hold
the carnival Saturday night instead of Friday
night, and in the more spacious Commons
room instead of the Union ballroom. Al-
though it provided much more space,

whoever drew up the floor plan ignored cor-
ners and utilized only part of the available
area. Thus, the otherwise colorful and enter-
taining circus-like atmosphere became a
push and shove inferno, detracting from the
joviality of the evening. Another break in
tradition was the method used to judge
booths. Prizes were offered from the total
gamut, instead of breaking them up accord-
ing to sororities, fraternities, dorms and
other organizations. The quality of the
booths was also better than usual, applying
that much more meaning to the awards, if it
is all worthwhile. Better yet, get rid of the
carnival. Groups participate grudgingly,
afraid not to build a booth for fear of being
labeled unschool spirited. Maybe all the
money wasted on booths and prizes could
better be channelled into a charitable cause.

28

Sunday night was a concert by the Rascals.
With an excellent repetoire and reputation,
the audience had ﬁred up enthusiasm for
the concert. Attention spans shortened as
everyone waited and waited and waited and
waited. In the course of two hours, programs
were transformed into paper planes and the
Syria Mosque began to look like Times
Square after New Year's Eve. No one would
have minded the wait if the concert had
proved worth waiting for. The group put on
a poor performance for an audience so used
to mediocrity, that even a fairly good per-
formance would have been rated excellent.

The theme of the weekend, "The Age of
Aquarius" connotes peace, love and psycho-
delics. The numerous possibilities of the
theme were for the most part wasted. Hope-
fully the weekend bearing the name of
Aquarius is not an example of what the age
is to be.

GREEK WEEK

Probably the most festive event of the school
year is "Greek Week.” It is a time for fun
and games and good times for all — all the
Greeks, that is. This could be the one time
of the year when a staunch Independent
may feel envious of the fraternity man, and

the Greeks do their best to capitalize upon
this feeling.

Greek Week may seem like a one shot deal,
but this really isn't so. Fraternities and soror-
ities spend months of time and hundreds of
dollars in preparation for the various events.
The entire week is molded around a central
theme: this year it was "Reflections on the
Sixties.” All the chariots had a "Sixties"
motiff and all the songs from Greek Sing
were ones popular during that decade.



When one thinks of "Greek Week" it
usually brings excitement to mind. There
is the thrill of watching your brothers beat-
ing a rival in the Chariot Race. There is
Fun Night, with its silly games and races,
and all the screaming and yelling that the
fraternities and sororities do. There is
Greek Sing. It's really strange to see
ﬁfteen or twenty guys up on stage trying
to harmonize, yet barely being able to
carry a tune. The sororities are different
however; they are refined and costumed —
and traditionally bring excellent song to
the Carnegie Hall Stage.

The Charity and Blood Drives are not
really fun, but they do show the commu-
nity that fraternities and sororities are
capable of performing a worthwhile ser-
vice.

This year's concert was
adequate, but little more.
When compared with the
5th Dimension of '69,
neither Richie Havens nor
the Brooklyn Bridge were
of the type or quality that
Pitt audiences expect. The
noise of the concert and
the "hash” smoking gal-
lery really didn't thrill
these who had come to
see the show.

The ﬁnale was the tradi-
tional formal ball — tuxe-
dos and gowns at Chat-
ham Center. We found
that ZBT and ChiO had
won Greek Week to end
an enjoyable festival.

For twenty-nine weeks of the school year,
the engineers are quiet, reserved, and gener-
ally busy studying for their many courses;
however, during one week, our typical engi-

neer casts off his white socks, puts away his
slide rule, and enjoys the events. This was
Engineers’ Week, this year, with its parade
and Iaggerz Concert.

40

It may seem to some that we have painted a
very dismal picture of the past social year.
True, we're. not ecstatic about it, but the
year has not been much worse than any
other year. It did provide diversity, and a
break from study. And even the worst was
better than nothing. Our plight would not
be so bad if all universities had the same
problem. The crime is that smaller colleges
manage to book first class entertainment,
while Pitt, a major university, is treated to
second class performers. Whether the prob-
lem lies in coordination, foresight, or
finances, it is necessary for the reputation of
the school and the happiness of the students
to resolve the dilemma.

The losing diet that Pitt sports fans

had been forced to live with

for the past half decade is over.

No longer are Pitt teams rolling over

to play dead. Carl DePasqua and his gridders
‘ won more games than a Panther grid squad
. since 1963. In basketball, Panthers

tripled last season's wins and

reached the .500 mark for the first time

in six years. The wrestling team jumped
from three wins to ten. Both the

track and wrestling squads placed among
the nation's top ten. Individually,

Ierry Richey not only repeated as an

All American in cross-country,

but became Pitt's first national track
champion since 1956 as he won

the national indoor two-mile run in March.
Randy Payne and Bob Kuhn join Richey

in the All American circle

as they placed second and sixth respectively
in the wrestling nationals.

For the third straight year

the gridders opened on the road at UCLA.
Their transfer quarterback Dennis
Dummitt picked apart the Panther secon-
dary, leading the Bruins to their

fourth straight lop-sided win over Pitt.
UCLA 42, PITT 8.

The following Saturday found Pitt up
against one of the nation's preseason
powers, Oklahoma. Sooner tailback
Steve" Owens went on to win the
Heisman Trophy, but it was the tough
Sooner defense that played havoc with
the Panthers. Oklahoma 37, PITT 8.

For the third straight week, the

Panthers hit the road, but

Duke proved more hospitable. Iim Friedl's
passes found the mark and a tremendous
defensive effort held the Blue

Devils to minus one yard rushing.

Carl DePasqua had his first win.
Pitt 14, Duke 12.

Home at last! Denny Ferris romped for four
TD’s and was named the game's most valuable
player. The defense sparkled again,

 

limiting the Middie rush to zero yards.
For the first time in 46 games,

the Panthers put together back-to-back
wins. Pitt 46, Navy 19.

The striking Panthers had a shot for
three straight. DePasqua’s gridders
jumped off to a 20-0 lead in the

first half on the virtue of two scoring
passes to George Medich and the
running of fullback Tony Esposito, who
gained 168 yards. But the

second half saw the Green Wave explode
through the air; a last minute TD
costing the Panthers their most heart-
breaking loss of the year.

Tulane 26, Pitt 22.

The Panthers invaded WVU
but the Mountaineer

rush was too much for the
Panther defense; the only
bright spot was the

kickoff returns artistry

of Dave Garnett. WVU 49,
Pitt 18.

Humiliated, the Panthers
returned to host Syracuse,
who were predicted to
pulverize Pitt. Syracuse
drew first blood, but

‘Pitt tied, and it was

neck and neck until the
end, when the Panthers
had their biggest win
since 1965. Pitt 21,
Syracuse 20.

Notre Dame provided the
opposition for Homecoming,
but the Irish proved too
tough. N.D. 49, Pitt 7.

At Army the Panthers picked
up their fourth win, after
spotting a 6-0 lead. Two
long drives and a spectacu-
lar defense led Pitt to
victory. Pitt 15, Army 6.

Playing host to undefeated

Penn State in the finale,

Pitt held them to a 7-7

tie until fourth quarter; p
then a punt, 2 TD's and -
Penn State 27, Pitt 7.

  

Early in September Iim Banner's cross coun-
try roster read like a hospital ward.
All-American Ierry Richey was one of the
several who had suffered injury or illness
over vacation. But despite the pre-season

woes, the distancemen chalked up victory
after victory in dual competition until the
ﬁnal meet with Penn State, the teams’ only
loss. Richey again repeated as All-American.

1

In a sensational climax to a wrestling season
which saw the grapplers win ten dual meets.
Randy Payne and Bob Kuhn led the matmen to
an eighth place ﬁnish in the nationals at
Northwestern. Both Payne and Kuhn gained
All-American honors as the Pitt team was the
highest placing Eastern contingent. Ironically, in
the Eastern tourney two weeks earlier, Dave
Adams’ squad could do no better than ﬁfth, as
Navy and Penn State walked off with the honors.
Mark Payne, Bob Kuhn and Dave Wylie grabbed
the only places for Adams’ squad as they placed
second, third and fourth respectively in the
national tournament. All-American and Eastern
champion heavyweight Ralph Cindrich sat out
the entire season with a knee injury. Highlights
of the dual meet season included a double win
on the road in December when the matmen
defeated seventh ranked Michigan in the
afternoon and Eastern Michigan in the evening.
In a big rival match with Lehigh (freshmen
ineligible) the matmen put up a valiant effort
but fell short in the upper weight classes. But the
most heartbreaking loss of the

 

' Ir/,+‘;’.‘r‘f.’ ' ,‘ 

 

   
    
   

season was a 17-16 decision at the hands of
undefeated Penn State. Two close matches in the
lightweights provided the margin. An additional
highlight was Randy Payne's performance at the
Navy Pleve Tourney, as he was named the most
‘ outstanding wrestler.

For the third time in four years, Sgt.
Bill Sarver’s riﬂe team finished in
second place in the Western
Pennsylvania Riﬂe League. The
marksmen posted a perfect 9-0 mark
in fall competition, but fell to a 13-4
by the end of the season. The 13-4
mark was good enough for a league
tie with Indiana, but the shooters lost
the championship in the shoot-off.

 

Lowell Meek was the bright spot in son. Meek tied for the Eastern championship
another sub-par season for Warren Neiger’s in the free exercise; Joe Gracik was an out-
gymnasts, who won only two meets all sea- standing performer on the sidehorse.

Buzz Ridl's second season as

head basketball mentor started out much
as the first. After the opening eight

games, the cagers stood 1-7, apparently
destined to repeat the 4-20 season of the
past year. But in early Ianuary, the
Panthers returned home to the friendly
surroundings of the Field House. Winning
eleven of their last sixteen games,

the hoopsters finished with a 12-12 mark.

For the first time in many years, the

cagers had a super-star, a potential All-
American, in sharpshooting sophomore
guard Kent Scott. By the end of the season,

Scott was averagj, g - '3'» 20 points per game
and in  - r high of 39 tallies, led
the Panthers to a stunning upset of arch-
rival West Virginia on the Mountaineers
ﬂoor in the season finale. The win cinched
the .500 season. Teaming up with Scott
in the back court was another new face,
Cleveland Edwards. Cleve’s brilliant passing,
ball handling, and defense made him a favor-
ite with the Pitt fans — fans who were
turning out at least 1000 per game.

In addition to the big win over WVU in the
season ﬁnale, other upset wins

included a record breaking performance
against Syracuse, and victories over Kent
State and George Washington.

Highlighting another outstanding indoor
season, Jerry Richey became Pitt's first
national champion since 1956, winning the
national two-mile run to lead the thin clads
to a ninth place team ﬁnish. Ioining Richey
in the spotlight were speedsters Smittie
Brown and Dorel Watley, high jumper
Bryant Salter, and the mile relay team. Salter
failed to clear the seven foot barriers in the
jump, but upped his varsity record to
6’10%”. Sophomore Don Poretto broke the
varsity mark in the broad jump. In door
season highlights included a dual meet win
over Penn State and outstanding
performances in several Eastern invitational
meets.

  

In the outdoor season, Dan Kuovolo broke the
Eastern record in the javelin, with a toss

of over 251 feet. Kuovolo’s first place ﬁnish
led the Panther's to a tie for sixth in the

IC4A team standings. Salter narrowly missed
setting the Eastern record in the triple jump,
but a foul in his take off cancelled his

jump of over ﬁfty feet. Despite the foul,

he still managed to place fourth in the event.
He also placed fourth in the high jump.
Plagued by a leg injury, Richey failed to place
in the Eastern three-mile.

In regular season competition, Penn State

nipped the thinclads in the annual Big Four Meet
as a disqualification on the baton exchange

cost the tracksters the win.

Disappointing is the

only word to describe

r the performance of

Bill Grant's swimmers.

Pre-season prediction

tabbed the mermen for

a 7-3 season, but the T

swimmers grabbed only a 

three meet wins and L 
ﬁnished far from the

top at Dartmouth finals.

However, star diver

Dave Wessel did continue

to smash his own records.

In his first year as head coach, Fran Webster wins. Senior Tom Stromp again captained
had little depth or experience available and the team and was Webster's most consistent
the netters picked up only a few scattered performer.

 
  

For the first time in recent history, the golfers
entered fall competition and fared exceptionally '
well. Mike Iones was medalist in that tourney.

Narrowly missing a play-off berth in the NCAA tournament,
the Panther mitters finished their season with a 14-7 mark.
George Medich completed another fine season on the mound
for Bobby Lewis. The senior was 4-2. Soph Phil Nochols
was 4-1. The majority of Panther losses were close,
including a 3-2 loss to Bucknell in the final inning, and the
loss to Penn State for the berth in the NCAA tourney.

With 1969-70 marking the return of res-
pectability to Pitt sports, the outlook for the
future must be an optimistic one. Excited,
young coaches have recruited the best high
school talent in the area — and should continue
to do so. The recent addition of synthetic
Astroturf to Pitt Stadium will not only
benefit the varsity sports of football,

soccer and track, but will open up the
stadium for much wider recreational and
intramural use as well. When he took over
as Athletic Director late in 1968, Casmir
Myslinski vowed to bring Pitt back in all
sports. It looks as if he's begun.
