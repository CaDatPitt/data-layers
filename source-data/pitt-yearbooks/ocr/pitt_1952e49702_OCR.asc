Many students live

long distances from the

  
 
  
 

University, yet travel to and from
their homes daily.

For them, trains provide
quick and

comfortable service.

Morning /com": meom trowel

Trolleys

and buses, which reach
far out into suburban areas,
bring many to the campus.
Riders to school

must compete for space
with oﬂice and

factory workers.

  
  
  
  
  
   
 

Pitt, primarily a
commuter’s college,

is bounded by webs of
streetcar tracks

that bring students

from all over

  

the district.

Lucky students

who own cars ride to school
in luXury—only to meet

a gigantic parking problem

when they arrive at Pitt.

The importance of
the city lies in its
tremendous factories-

__ 1 ”'*"5" J ,.....,....... _-_-__,.
factories of steel     . ' _ ~*'

and glass.
whose products are

shipped daily to aid

the nation

and the world.

The noise of

Pittsburgh’s mills is
overpowering; its research
is quietly modest.

Yet, from this research
comes the knowledge
which gives power

to its mills.

Pittsburgh ﬁnds its might
in books as well as

in steel. For intensive study
or easy relaxation,

the city's libraries play

a vital role.

The cry, “Play Ball,”

strikes a deep response
among Pittsburghers.

And Forbes Field,

with its impressive backdrop,
is essential to the heart

of the city.

Whether it is in the music of light opera

or the sparkling lights of downtown theatres,

Although students
have spent the morning
in travel, they have still

another trip to make.

The elevator is an

important part

of life at Pitt.

T 0 the door: of their U n i vemi

From cars, from

Fifth Avenue trolleys,
and Forbes Street buses,
the students come

to take their places

in the classroom.

From test tubes and
Bunsen burners, as well as
from notebook and text,
the chemistry majors

develop their study.

   
  

Up on the hill
away from the Cathedral,
the engineering students
spend long hours working

in their labs.

  
  
  
  
  
  
   

Huge lecture halls,

as well as small classrooms,
play an integral part

in the students’ education.
Modern and brightly lit,
these halls resemble

separate auditoriums.

Men and women together,

side by side, share their learning
in the classroom,

in extra—curricular activities,

in co—ed organizations.

Faculty Club

Away from work and classes, the faculty and admin-
istrators relax in the Faculty Club. In the quiet atmos-
phere of the lounge, our directors meet socially. If they
wish, they listen to music or read, play cards or talk
together. Lunch is served in the dining room and the food
is good.

During the Christmas holidays the Faculty Club holds
a Christmas party for the children of the members.

Students are welcomed in the club as guests of mem-
bers. Membership, however, is restricted to faculty and
administrators.

Alumni Association

Each person who receives a degree from the University
of Pittsburgh automatically becomes a member of the
General Alumni Association. The purpose of this associa-
tion is that of interpreter and representative of the alumni
to the university and of the university to the alumni. It is
made up of eleven constituent associations which represent
every school at Pitt.

The business and policies of the Association are gov-
erned by the Alumni Council; ten members of the Board
of Trustees and two members of the Athletic Policy Com-
mittee are elected by the Alumni Association members.

Fall Homecoming Celebration is an annual event of
the association to welcome graduates back to Pitt for a
week end. The Spring Homecoming and Reunion Celebra-
tion is usually in the form of a Smorgasbord. A Children's
Christmas Party is another of the activities. The organiza-
tion also operates an annual Alumni Giving Fund, the
purpose of which is to promote the progress of the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh through contributions from alumni. The
names ofcontributors are also published in “The Blue Book
of Pitt Alumni,” and also in the Alumni News Review, the
Association’s publication, which is mailed to all alums ﬁve
times per year.

Coming to

Miss Pitt

Contrary to popular belief, Pitt students do study.
V\'e don’t spend all our time in the Tuck Shops and Com-
mons Room. Ask any man or woman at Pitt; he or she will
recognize these pictures. Perhaps a steaming cup of coffee
is needed to give a realistic effect.

Here, then, we commemorate our academic lives with
Mr. and Miss Pitt, symbols of our hours spent in learning.

ﬂ§§ M1:

im



Mr. Pitt

\_Ve, ofthe Ow/, have chosen two ofour better students,
Titica Xerocastas and Dave VVinter, to be the symbols.
But surrounding them are many objects familiar to us all.
A four years’ stack of books, pencils, a typewriter and
notebook~all are part of the educational process. In—
cluded, too, you will see items ofrelaxation—a radio, sports
trophies, pictures of the latest love.

These two pages we dedicate to our days of thought
and work, when we attempt to understand the complexities
of this modern world.

Pitt Fashions
1952

Walk down any of our city's streets—there, mingling
with the denims of the steel—worker and the miner, are the
bright plaids and comfortable skirts and sweaters of the
college students on their way to the University. Pitt may
well be called the center of Pittsburgh’s younger set fash-
ions. Here one can always ﬁnd the basic styles for smart
and practical wardrobes. On these pages we have gathered
campus fashions-—picnic, formal, smoker, tea. Whatever
the occasion, Pitt men and women will always be dressed
for it.

In a typical class Joan Garber wears an oxford
gray jumper and a wool jersey. Andy Wis-
singer is casually dressed in a V-necked
cashmere sweater and white bucks.

Cotton lace over taffeta ﬁts the fashion scene
at an informal dance. Her date blends into
the picture, too, in his navy suit. The models
are Carol Smith and Bob Homer.

42

Going to a picnic Helen Franklin wears the
newest in shorts. Jack McMinn sports blue
jeans and a wool shirt.

At a men's smoker plaid’s the fad with Roger
Bognar in his plaid vest and tie, and Jim
Johnston in his tartan jacket.

Warm clothes and football weather belong
together. Liz Hughes in her fur—trim shortie
is ready to cheer the team. A heavy herring-
bone sport coat and pennant prepare Ed
Jensen for the big game.

Studying needs comfort as well as concentra-
tion. Margie Moellenbrock handles both in a
coolie—collar housecoat and warm slipper-
sox. Joanne Louttit curls up in a striped
rayon duster.

 

43

Paul Rheubottom in a two tone wool jacket
and Bob Lewis in his plaid shirt are typically
dressed for a geology field trip.

44

The Commencement Ball calls for the ultra
in formal fashion. Joan Benjamin wears a
strapless, ﬂoor-length net gown while Paul
Eckstein stands by in his white summer

jacket.
An afternoon tea calls for a smart basic dress

as worn by Betty Douglas (middle) or tai-
lored suits as modelled by Jo Gallagher (left)
and Claire Sullivan (right).

Registration

Students look to registration with mingled emotions-
the anxiety about getting class cards they need, the frus-
tration of long waiting lines and closed classes—and the
reliefof being all registered and ready for another semester.

The process of starting a new semester at Pitt begins
with much checking to see that all are eligible to register,
and in their proper standing—line. Those who are new to
the intricacies of planning courses and obtaining class
cards are often alarmed at the great crowds of people
gathered around the department sections.

They receive reassurance, though, from the comfort-
ing presence of faculty members, who offer patient help
and moral support to confused registrants.

VVhen the last class card has been neatly ﬁled in the
registration envelope, and the last change of course has
been scratched from their schedules, students breathe a
sigh of relief that the hardest part is finished.

A more pleasant aspect of registration begins when
the worry about scheduling classes is over—students who
have not seen many of their friends during the summer
have an opportunity to talk and exchange stories of their
vacation experiences.

xLFSik§ Eﬁiﬁﬂiﬂil

%

Advice! Advice and more advice
until the grades and credits and
schedules are worked out and ap-
proved. The next problem, though,
is even worse. Will the section
chosen still be open? Or will there
be more advising and revising?

The treasurer’s cage is the last
stop at registration. With tuition
paid, and cards all ﬁlled out and
turned in, the Pitt student is ready
to begin a new semester, but first he
has a week end to recover from
Registration Day.

Four Years to Go

Stephen Foster Auditorium was ﬁlled with whispering
and excitement and girls—from frightened freshmen to
sympathetic seniors—for the Green Armband Ceremony.
This program is the freshman girl’s first introduction to
the other women at Pitt, to VV.S.G.A.’s activities, and
ﬁnally to their Senior Mentors, who help to take away
some of the freshmen worries.

In a great big circle in front of the chapel, Senior
Mentors _hold their numbers high over their heads and
wait anxiously for the freshmen to come. The freshmen
match their numbers to the seniors, and from then on,
the building of understanding and friendship makes Pitt
life a happy life.

From the ﬂame before Alma Mater, the ﬂame-
bearers at Lantern Night carry light to the lan-
terns of the freshmen. Together the women of
Pitt pledge to seek, both for themselves and for
those who follow, the inner light of truth, for
who knows “how far that little candle throws his
beams!”

A chance to meet the other half! Freshmen——
men and Women—get acquainted at the mixer
dances in the fall. Dancing,.refreshments, lots of
fun make up the Student Congress mixer dances.
And it can certainly never be said that the
“mixers” are exclusively freshmen affairs!

Women’s Activities

From the magniﬁcent stained—glass windows
of Heinz Chapel, comes another beautiful tradi-
tion for Freshmen women. This is the ceremony
of Caritas, the message of loving kindness from
the great women embodied in the Chapel win-
dows. The Y.W.C.A. chooses upperclass women to
interpret for the Freshman the spirit of faith and
brotherhood represented by these great women of
all races and religions. This traditional message of
the Y.VVC.A. to the Freshman is one of the most
beautiful of all Pitt traditions.

The Panhellenic Reception is another tradi-
tion at Pitt—this is the particular contribution
of all the sorority women on campus. Through it,
the Freshmen are introduced to anothe_r phase
of Pitt life, that of the Greek letter organizations.
The formal reception is divided into two parts-
the ﬁrst part is held in the Commons Room, and
the second part, a social hour, takes place in the
specially decorated Tuck Shop. The most impres-
sive part of this program is the Greek chorus,
which presents in harmony, songs of all the so-
rorities.

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   

Blood Donor Drive

Pitt in fall, caught in its special rush ofclasses
and activities, was, nevertheless, not isolated
from the fast—moving world around it. The out-
break of another war left a deep impression on
the campus—senior men changed their post-
graduation plans from those of wearing business
suits to the wearing of khaki or navy blues;women
students wrote letters and sent packages to their
relatives and ﬁances in the armed services; an
eﬂicient plan for’ civil defense at the University
became a pressing need. And all of Pitt’s popula-
tion looked around for something more that they
might do to help—the most vital “something
more” that they happened upon was the blood
donor drive.

 

     

The call for blood donations received a tre-
mendous response from Pitt students. Both men
and women waited patiently in line when the
Red Cross mobile unit visited the Cathedral.
Tiny coeds who had given blood without diﬂiculty
smiled indulgently at the brawny males sinking
weakly into their chairs.

o. s. U. Rally

Fall at Pitt would never be complete without a strong
epidemic of football fever. Both faculty and students were
strong supporters of the team, not only at the stadium,
but also at the pre— and post—game rallies.

The band, the cheerleaders, the Panther, and faculty
and student masters of ceremony worked together to lead
student enthusiasm at the rallies. Community leaders
added their support to the home team, too.

Highlight of the pre—game celebrations was the night
rally before the Ohio State battle, when Pitt high priests
“met to bury the coﬂin of O.S.U.” '

Homecoming

Pitt’s alumni feel that fall is a special time
on the campus, too, for this is the season of home-
coming, when graduates of the past return to see
their Alma Mater.

The campus is all dressed up to receive the
alums, too—sororities and fraternities open their
houses to Visitors, Various alumni groups hold
banquets and parties, special tours of the Cathe-
dral are arranged. Current Pitt students act as
guides and hosts for the Alumni.

One of the highlights of the program is the
alumni banquet prior to the homecoming football
game—prominent members of the community as
well as faculty and administrators are invited to
attend.

Open receptions at the fraternity and sorority
houses are an important part of the homecoming
celebration. Each of the houses is decorated in
honor of the alums, around a central homecoming
theme. House parties, dances, and teas are
planned, with special skits designed to entertain
returning alumni.

104

Chancellor’s Reception

Parents have an opportunity
to visit Pitt in the fall, too. The
Chancellor holds a special reception
for the families of Freshmen—at
this time they get to really see the
Cathedral, and meet members of
the faculty and administration.
Student guides, senior mentors, and
upperclass counsellors are on hand
to meet the parents and introduce
them to the University. The entire
Cathedral, from the ground floor,
and the Nationality Rooms on the
ﬁrst floor, to the labs high up in the
building, were open to visitors.

 

  

Although Pitt's dances are not conﬁned to the fall
season alone, they begin very early in the semester. Out-
standing among these is the annual one held by the Engi-
neering and Mines Association in November.

The engineers take time out from their slide rules and
T squares for some dancing and friendly talk at the West
View Park ballroom.

Pitt Chest Drive

Pitt students, very much aware of the desperate need
of so many of the world’s peoples, ﬁnd that fall is a time
for helping others. To do this, they give their full support
to the Pitt Chest Fund, a drive which aids many individual
charities. Although most of the charities are national and
international in scope, a portion of the money helps men
and women students right here on campus who need
ﬁnancial assistance.

Another facet was added to the Fund Drive this year
—all students who made a contribution of two dollars or
more were eligible to attend a special Pitt Chest Fund
Dance at the Y.M. and W.H.A.

106

       

First Win of Season

Hooray . . . The ﬁrst victory of the season. For seven
straight weeks the Pitt Panthers played the best in the
nation only to lose by the barest margin. But on the eighth
week, the Panthers ﬁnally hit their stride and ran over
West Virginia at will to the score of 32-12. The amazing
spirit of the team and the ‘students was shown by the few
thousand loyal fans who sat thru a blinding snow storm in
zero weather to watch their team slaughter our neighbors
from the hills of West Virginia. Hats off to the heroes of
the day . . . the ﬁghting team and the frozen fans. ‘

 

107

The fall season at Pitt ended with Pitt’s smashing victory over its traditional
arch rival Penn State, I3—7. This game gave Pitt the possession of the Tri—State Cham-
pionship. It was only a year ago that we lost it to Penn State in the “Snow Bowl” 20.21.
This year’s victory called for some special celebration. Students, faculty, and adminis-
tration joined with team in a victory rally.

On these preceding pages are just a few of the scenes of Pitt In Fall, but they are
not nearly enough to show the full, rich life of this urban university. Beneath the class-
room activities, the dances and rallies, the football games and parties is the spirit of
Pitt people——a deep spirit of loyalty that adds strength and beauty to their life at
the University.

   

     

Dentistry
  W w,:* 

 

Open up wide, please. This won’t hurt a bit.

Dean L. E. Van Kirk

From thousands of applications each year, the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh School of Dentistry selects only the
most capable men to enroll in their school, one of the ﬁnest
in the country. Building from a ﬁrm base of.the sciences,
the student is given thorough training in the most modern
techniques of scientiﬁc dentistry. His ﬁrst two years are
spent studying anatomy, prosthesis, histology, and many
other related sciences. But in his junior and senior years,
the dent student has an opportunity to put theory into
practice as he works in the inﬁrmary.

Pitt’s school of Dentistry has always had the objective
of training students in the diagnosis, treatment and pre-
vention of oral diseases, and the enabling of the student
to meet effectively the responsibilities of dental practice.
To this end the social, economic and ethical relationships
of the profession are stressed.

The University of Pittsburgh School of Dentistry
came into existence April 20, 1896, as the Pittsburgh
Dental College. Since 1896, it has grown considerably.
The ﬁrst building on the present campus has been thor-
oughly ﬁtted with the modern and improved equipment
and teaching apparatus. Outside clinics, such‘ as Falk,
have been established for the beneﬁt of student and the
public. The Dental Library and Museum has an extensive
collection of books and periodicals. These are excellent
supplementary guides to students in the School of Den-
tistry.

Dean C. B. Nutting

On the fourteenth ﬂoor of the Cathedral one
may hear legal arguments being conducted with
intensity and interest. This is the University of
Pittsburgh School of Law in the midst of its Case
Method of Study. Students may ﬁnd all the ma-
terial needed in the Law Library which contains
approximately 34,000 available volumes. Founded
in 1895 by Dean John D. Shafer, this school has
been in continuous function for ﬁfty-seven years.
Until 1936, the School of Law had its quarters in
downtown Pittsburgh, but at that time they
moved to the Cathedral in keeping with the Uni-
versity policy of integration. Originally the faculty
was composed of members of the Bench and Bar
who gave some of the valuable time to teach eager
students. Now the faculty is a combination of
members of the Bar and full-time legal scholars
and teachers.

116

Test Week coming up? ? ? ?

Contrary to popular belief, admittance to the
School is not based on a prelegal course as an
undergraduate. Habits of close, critical and sus-
tained study are much more highly regarded than
any particular course. When a student at Law
School, the neophyte is automatically a member of
the Student Bar Association, which coordinates
student extra-curricular activities. The Associa-
tion sponsors social and athletic affairs and Re-
gional Conferences.

Regarded as one of the ﬁnest law schools in
the country, the University of Pittsburgh Law
School can credit much of its reputation to their
capable administrator, Dean Charles B. Nutting.
Under his direction, this school has made great
advances in the field of law. Each of the students
who graduates from Pitt’s Law School is worthy
and eligible for membership to the Bar.

Experimenting on rats is all a part of a doctor’s training.

A strong sense of their responsibility to the public is developed
in the students ofthe School ofMedicine. The one hundred students
who enter the school each year are drawn primarily from the Tri-
State area. Here, for the ﬁrst two years, they participate in a cur-
riculum devoted primarily to training in the basic medical sciences.
The third and fourth year training is largely clinical, and is con-
ducted in the wards and clinics of the University Medical Center.

First chartered in 1886 as the VVestern Pennsylvania Medical
College, the school became the medical department of the VVestern
University of Pennsylvania in 1892. When this institution became
the University of Pittsburgh, the medical school was already an
integral part of it.

To achieve an even closer unity among the students of the
school, a Students’ Medical Society was formed in 1925. It holds
quarterly scientiﬁc meetings at which student—written papers of
medical interest are read.

Most recent point of the school’s dynamic program is the
rapidly advancing plan for a new medical school building. Dean
VV. S. McEllroy has planned and worked hard on this expansion.
Connected with the Presbyterian Hospital, it will accommodate
laboratories, equipment, and classrooms, and allow for increased
student enrollment. This will add even more importance to the
School of Medicine’s vital role in the community and in the state.

An ideal student—teacher relationship has been
achieved by the faculty and students of Pitt’s School of
Nursing——here both groups meet together, through the
Student-Faculty Nursing Association, to consider com-
mon problems and professional goals. The Association
works through special committees, again composed of
both faculty and undergraduates, which act ‘upon eco-
nomic, ﬁnancial, and social matters for the mutual
understanding does much to enrich the lives of the
student nurses.

Dean R. P. Kuehn provides many other enriching
experiences for her students, too. At the end of the pre-
clinical period, beginning students receive their ﬁrst honor
of recognition at the Capping ceremony. The Black Band-
ing ceremony at the beginning of the senior year, is the
second stepping—stone to a career in nursing. A ﬁnal recog-
nition for the student nurses comes with the Pinning
ceremony at the end of the basic professional program.
The spiritual meaning of their chosen ﬁeld is shown the
prospective nurses, too, at the beautiful Florence Night-
ingale Service, held in the Heinz Chapel.

At the end of their training program the nurses may
begin their professional work and still go on to further
specialization in the school. This year’s graduates may
give serious consideration to a military career, also. But,
whatever their choice, these women will enter their jobs
with a sense of security in the excellent nursing education
they have received.

Microbiology is one of the more fascinating subjects studied
by Nursing students.

A pictorial display of the History of Pharmacy interests

these students.

One Very important part of the University of Pitts-
burgh is not within immediate range of the Cathedral, and
yet an integral part of it. This is the School of Pharmacy,
located in a big, red brick building on the Boulevard of
Allies.

The school was established in 1896, and became an
actual part of the University in 1948, though it had worked
in close conjunction with Pitt for many years before that.

Pharmacy school students are an especially close,
well-knit group, with a wonderfully strong spirit of fellow-
ship and cooperation. The group has its own newspaper,
the popular Pitt Capsule, and its own active student
council. Besides this, visiting speakers prominent in
pharmacy and its allied ﬁelds, stimulating seminars, and
busy classroom work, provide a full schedule for these
students. A student branch of the American Pharma-
ceutical Association provides an excellent link with the
practicing pharmacists, too. Dean E. C. Reif and his ﬁne
staff believe in a well—rounded education, also and ac-
cordingly have encouraged many, many social events
each year. And the new equipment and research laboratory
provided added incentive for high scholastic achievement.

Men and women who attend the School of Pharmacy
find, too, a promising array of career opportunities, based
on the solid foundation of their training at Pitt.

1952 Class in Retail Training.

In stores from Montreal to Miami, from Seattle to
San Antonio, from the Golden Triangle to the Golden Gate,
graduates of the University of Pittsburgh’s Retail Bureau
hold important executive jobs. This is no accident. Pitts-
burgh is unexcelled as a city of department stores, perfect
laboratory for ambitious young men and women who
choose retailing as a career Founded in 1918 and encour-
aged by Pittsburgh merchants, the Retail Bureau has
grown and kept pace with the development of retailing.
The graduate school of retailing trains a selected group of
students, and the research divisions studied cover a wide
variety of retail merchandising and operating problems.
The Bureau’s one—year graduate course prepares students
for responsible executive positions in buying, advertising,
fashion and personnel. In addition to classroom work, the
students get experience doing practical work in the down—
town department stores and get paid for it. The Director
of the Research Bureau is Professor Bishop Brown.
Director Brown has been associated with the Bureau since
1929, and has been its Director since 1936.

Basic merchandise facts are learned by study-
ing actual materials.

Good reading habits are encouraged by the
Bureau's well-stocked and comfortable li-
brary.

Frequent informal conferences are held with
staff members.

The Bureau class is limited to approx-
imately 100 graduate students with a keen
interest in retailing. For this reason, and
because its oﬂices and classrooms are all
located on the 19th and 20th floors of the
Cathedral of Learning, the Bureau is in
effect a small school within a very large
one. Consequently, students get well
acquainted with each other and talk shop
not only in the classroom but in the
spacious lounge between and after classes.

An important focal point of the
Bureau’s indoor campus is the library.
This beautifully panelled room contains
the most complete collection of books and
periodicals dealing with retail subjects
in the world. It is in almost constant use
during the day and several evenings at
week. The tempo of life at the Bureau
reaches its peak in mid-April when an
entire week is set aside for placement in-
terviews. Representatives from 35 to 40
retail organizations visit the school at this
time to interview the students for jobs.
As a result, most of the class are placed
before graduation.

Director of Athletics

Captain Tom Hamilton

Rear Admiral Torn Hamilton (Ret.) played a remarkable dual role in the Pitt
picture this year. Selected as Director of Athletics two years ago to help straighten out
the confused athletic situation, Captain Tom (as he is popularly called) has gone far to
rehabilitate Pitt as an athletic power while avoiding the pitfalls of overemphasis by
building a well rounded program of intercollegiate and intramural sports. But last
summer he found himself without a football coach and with his team facing the tough-
est schedule in the country. At the timely urging of the Athletic Committee, Director
Hamilton became Coach Hamilton, for one season only. Most Pitt fans will agree that
here we have an interim coach who was more successful than most permanent ones:

“The best—looking team turr 6,} out at Pitt for many a
year,” they said after the ﬁrst game. After the last game a
Pittsburgh sportswriter said, “VVith material and spirit
at an all—time high, the new coach will step into a soft
berth.” In between,the Panthers bumped into some mighty
rough breaks, and seven defeats, but a more spirited team
would be hard to ﬁnd. Never discouraged, they bounced
back from their bitterest defeat to scare mighty Michigan

State. After six defeats, they played one of their greatest
games in losing to Ohio State. Three straight wins wound
up the season. As Rudy Andabaker, co-captain of the
team, remarked, “Too bad we don’t play every team
twice—then we’d show some of those burns a thing or
two.” Actually, even in losing, Pitt showed every opponent
more than a thing or two: some real hard—blocking, hard-
tackling football, smooth running and sensational passing.

The game lasted too long, as Iowa poured it
on in the fourth quarter to win 34-17. Pitt’s pass
defense suddenly wilted before a sensational Iowa
aerial attack. Bad news for Pitt was Bestwick’s
injury on his only defensive play of the year. Also

Low point of the season was reached as Notre
Dame smashed us 33-0. Without Bestwick the
Panther attack sputtered and died. Pitt spent
most of its time in its own territory, hampered by
fumbles and interceptions, while Notre Dame

and a tough second-half ground game. The oﬂicials
earned many boos, but Notre Dame just as clearly
earned its victory.

.Undoubtedly the key to Pitt's constant im-
provement in the face of adversity was the passing
combination‘ of Bestwick to Warriner. Working
out of the “T” Bestwick was second in the East
in passing yardage, and Warriner ranked third
in yards gained receiving. To emphasize their
importance~still further, Bestwick ranked third
in total yards gained, rushing and passing. Be-
tween them, the duo smashed ﬁfteen all—time
Pitt records, and they did it almost completely
in only two seasons of play. Bestwick now holds
the Pitt records in yards gained passing for a
career, for a season and for a single game.

Down goes Cimarolli after a ten-yard gain.

He threw more passes in his two years of
playing than any previous back had in his career.
More important, he holds the records for passes
completed in career, season and single game and
for touchdown passes in one season. Bobby also
holds the total offense mark for a single game, 331
yards. This is 14. yards under his record for pass-
ing yardage, 345, scored in the Michigan State
game, because he had a minus rushing score as
a result of being caught in his backﬁeld by the
Spartan line. VVarriner owns the dual records for
career and season in passes caught, yards gained,
passes received, and touchdown passes.

dominated that play throughout,
but four marches deep into Rice

A team that couldn't be dis-

For a change, the game wasn't quite
long enough, as Pitt came from be-
hind, 16-0, to score twice in the
second half. Four times the Panthers
drove into Ohio territory before
they scored on the ﬁfth. Then
VVarriner’s long run was called
back and it took all remaining time
to go down the hard way. Janowicz’

Bestwick hit Warriner and Glagola

ing for two more, with the “Rock,"

Best game of the year for spec-
tators saw Penn State go down to
defeat, 13-7, as blocking and tack-
ling mixed with great passing and
great receiving in a show of real
football. VVarriner’s spectacular
punting kept the Lions penned up,
while Bestwick added key yardage
on sneaks_ or escaping traps. Rey-
nolds intercepted a last minute
pass to kill the Lion’s last hopes.

Beautiful blocking by Bill Reynolds enables Bobby Epps to gain valuable yardage

against Penn State.

 

   

“Upset of the year,” Miami
sportswriters said as the Panthers
rolled over the bowl-bound Hurri-
canes, 21-7. In Pitt’s best game of
the year, Bestwick disdained his
record-breaking air attack in favor
of a devastating ground game. The
spirited Panthers pushed Miami out
ofits own stadium as Sichko, Cima-
rolli, Reynolds and Epps ground
out yardage and three touchdowns
between the Miami tackles. 159

Promoting a high tradition of athletics at the Uni-
versity is the aim of the newly formed Panther Club, a
group made up of varsity lettermen from all ﬁelds of
sports. A

The club answers the need for a campus athletic host-
ing group by welcoming visiting varsity teams, and enter-
taining high school students who are prospective Pitt
athletes. .

The reactivating of the Varsity Day program is an-
other big job undertaken by the lettermen. On this day
awards are given to deserving athletes. Outstanding among
these is the Dr. Hartwig award, given by the Athletic
committee to the student who has done the most to further
the interest of athletics at the University. '

Another new idea introduced by the Panther Club is
the establishment of a Varsity Walk. On this walk will be
carved the names of outstanding Pitt athletes in all ﬁelds
of sports.

Social activities haven't been neglected by the mem-
bers, either. The dances in the Stadium pavilion following
the home basketball games have been very successful.

Pitt’s matmen rapidly moved into the national picture, with
an exciting 9—won, 2—lost season. Lady luck played a part in the
season’s records, as the Panthers edged Michigan when a Michigan
heavyweight got a dislocated shoulder. A week later, the ﬁnal
Pitt entry, leading at the time,-got a dislocated shoulder, to lose
the match. The toughest lost of the season was against Penn State.

West Virginia and Penn State continued to be Pitt’s

top of the scorers early and stayed there, but ’on his off
nights the team found good shooting in Kendrick, Virostek,
Burch and Dietrick.

While this wasn't Carlson's worst team, it was far
from his best, too. At times the new memorial Field House
seemed a pretty lonely place. But, when the fans would
start to despair, the Panthers came back to stage several
shows that equaled any in the 26-year history of the old
Stadium court. At any rate, the Field House floor and its
capacity attracted many new schools to Pittsburgh and
the Pitt home schedule, and promises continued good
basketball games.

Eastern Collegiate Championship

Coach Ben Grady

The Panther swimmers ended a ﬁne season with a smashing
victory in the Eastern Collegiate championship. The Pittites
scored 99 points, with runner-up Rutgers netting only 59. Sopho-
more Ronnie Gainsford paced the Panthers with wins in the I00
and 200-yard breaststroke, and was a member of the winning med-
ley relay team.

The season's record showed IO won, 3 lost and one tie in regu-
lar season competition, with several pool records broken by the
Pitt mermen. The medley relay team of Fannin, Gainsford and
Melograne won consistently, with Bill Corr starring in the 100-
yard free style. Both Corr and the relay team broke records at
Wayne University’s pool, breaking the records set by Michigan
State, one of the three teams which later defeated the Panthers.
The YMHA pool record for the 300-yard relay fell to the Panthers
this year, too, with Corr, Zentgraf, Piwowarske, and Weiss splash-
ing to one of their victories. Additional ﬁrsts were won for Pitt by
diver Tom Blosser, who took a first and a second in the Eastern
Collegiate.

Bob Arthurs

The 1951 track team had only one home appearance. That was
a disappointing loss to Penn State at the home grounds, and was
the Panther’s second loss, balancing a like number of victories.
Following the end of the local season, six members of the team
went on to the IC4A meet, only to be lost in the dust of many
others. i

The slim schedule oﬂrered few bright spots. Kuzma set a new
track record at Miami of Ohio, taking the mile in 4:21. Kountz set
a new record in Pitt—Notre Dame competition with a 1/2-mile win in
I :54.4. Captain Dick Firsching was promising plenty of Pitt points
in the 440 when he pulled a muscle, While John Patellos showed
some sparkle in the 100- and 22o—yard sprints and the running
broad jump.

Happiest day of the season was marked by a terriﬁc come-
back drive in the win over Notre Dame.

Cross Country

With only one loss in regular meets, Pitt’s cross country team
had the best record of any outdoor team last season. Pitt took all
ﬁve places against Slippery Rock and Geneva in a dual meet,
against Yale, Dartmouth and Columbia in a triangular, against
West Virginia, against Case, and against Delaware. Only loss was
to Penn State.

The harriers did well in the Allegheny Mountain Association
meets, taking first place in both junior and senior competition,
but they were seventh in the IC4A meet and 10th in the NCAA.

Five returning lettermen helped Coach Olson, led by Captain
Frank Kuzma, Ken Mahanna, and Bernie Luterancik. Several
freshmen, eligible this season, also turned in good work and got
some valuable training for next season.

About the winningest Pitt team in 1951 was the golf team
coached by Dave McCormack, Shannopin Country Club pro. On
the links the Panthers sported a record of eight wins against three
losses, including a sparkling 7% to I % victory over West Virginia.
This came after starting the season with two defeats.

Individual records paralleled the team standing, with Norm
Figura topping the list on the strength of his nine wins against
only ‘one loss. Close behind was Mike Swartz with a record of

with nine wins against two defeats.

Harry Campney set the best record with nine wins and two losses,

Pitt's I951 baseball team spent a large part of the

enough to rack up a record of nine wins against ten losses.
Catcher Ollie Niemela had a dislocated thumb, Chuck

ﬁelder Bobby Lewis was beaned, while shortstop Steve

Pitt pitchers were led by Roy Hollis with 3 and 2, and

time with the smaller foes, but the big ones, particularly
West Virginia and Penn State, were too. tough. Pitt upset
Navy, but was upset by Thiel College.

In -addition to the ﬂood of injuries, Coach Mitter-

Coeds who participate in the Women’s Athletic Asso-

no play” adage. A full, varied program of both individual
and group sports is set up early in the fall; the program
includes both seasonal and year—round sports. Especially
popular among these are archery, badminton, basketball
and softball.

WAA provides an opportunity for women who are
interested in active physical recreation to utilize the Uni-
versity’s gym facilities. It also sponsors a busy activities’
calendar, so that these women who share similar recrea-
tional interests may also meet together for parties, dinners,
and numerous other social get-togethers.

Intramurals

 

“More Intramurals for Independents,” was the slogan for the year at
Schenley Oval and in the Stadium courts as Director Leo Bemis added five
new sports to the already busy “non-professional” calendar.

Wrestling, skiing, ping-pong, squash, and handball attracted one of
the busiest throngs intramural sports has known, when added to the always
popular touch football, softball, and basketball slate.

When the Varsity basketballers moved to the Field House, the 26-year
old Stadium court was left to league play. Softball and football facilities
are still tight considering the long hike to Schenley Oval.

In last Spring’s softball play—offs, the Psi O’s came out on top, with the
Buzzards runner—up. Psi O’s continued their winning ways into the Fall,
copping the touch football league and adding the ‘ﬁnal touch by licki-ng the
Carnegie Tech intramural champs.

Christmas Formal

Pitt in winter is always exciting
with its campus that looks soft and
white from the Cathedral windows;
its days packed full of class assign-
ments and papers due. This winter
was all these things—and more—for
December 1951 witnessed the birth
of a Commons Room Christmas
Dance.

Many students on campus had
been thinking of such a dance. They
had talked of the ideal way in which
the Commons Room, with its splen-
did arches and huge ﬂoor would
lend itself to a Christmas Ball set-
ting. But it wasn’t until this winter
that the speculation became a real-
ity. When the men and women who
had talked about having this dance
actually saw the transformed Com-
mons Room they found it even more
beautiful than they had imagined
it would be. The Christmas greens
and glowing ﬂames in the ﬁreplaces
were a perfect background. The
orchestra sounded rich and full in
the high room. And all those who
had worked and planned to make
this new tradition a success were
very proud, indeed.

 

 

The Commons Room Christmas Dance was just as thrilling an experience for
the viewers as it was for the dancers. The Ball committee had worked with great
care in planning decorations—they wanted to utilize the beauty of the Commons
Room itself, without hampering it by too many trimmings. This idea worked out to
the complete satisfaction of everyone present. Couples viewing the dance floor from
the balcony archways found that the most attractive decorations were provided by
the dancers themselves—the girls’ bright gowns gave a wonderful warmth to the
sober colors of the Commons Room. Even the snow and ice out-of—d0ors didn't
dampen the holiday spirit of the dance. The Tuck Shop provided a convenient place
for resting dancers to have some refreshments and talk with friends. This convinced
them that the Commons Room was not only a beautiful place for a Christmas
Dance, but a practical one as well.

  
  

Stadium Review

Although the cold weather forces the famous Varsity Marching Band to move
indoors, it certainly doesn’t stop the men from playing ﬁne music. One of the high-
lights ofwinter at Pitt is the annual Stadium Review, given by the University Band.
Large crowds of students, as well as many community admirers turn out to see the
Band. Besides doing many oftheir popular half—time numbers, the student musicians
perform several special instrumental arrangements. At the Stadium Review, too,
the name of the Outstanding Bandsman of the Year is revealed. Bud Leech won
the award this year. He was chosen by all the members of the Band, and presented
with a special trophy. The trophy in a sense signiﬁes the tight bond of comradeship
and spirit of the Band—the spirit which is such a vital factor in its success.

Opening of the
Field House

This has been a winter of dreams that have
become realities for Pitt—and probably the great-
est of these realized dreams was the opening of
the new ﬁeld house. A big modern ﬁeld house for
athletic events had for so long seemed like a far-off
plan, a part of the gigantic building program
which must, of necessity, materialize slowly. But,
all over campus there was building this winter—
and, on the hill above the Cathedral, a huge,
streamlined ﬁeld house stands as proud proof.

The ﬁrst basketball game in the new ﬁeld
house was an important event not only in the
lives ofPittAstudents, but for all Pittsburgh as well.

Alumni returned in large numbers to attend
the opening game at the ﬁeld house. City and
county oﬂicials expressed their pleasure in the
newest University building. And everyone at
the opening remembered happily that this was just
the beginning of a whole area of varied sports
highlights in the ﬁeld house.

Heart Hop

A “woman—asks—the-man” dance is a traditional part
of the Pitt-in~Winter program. Each February the women's
classes combine in planning and organizaing the Heart
Hop.

February, 1952, provided an added incentive—leap
year. But, though Pitt’s male inhabitants were a little
wary ofwhat might happen on February 29th, they hearti-
ly approved the feminine initiative in extending invitations
to the Schenley Ball Room. Music was by Bill LeRoy and
his orchestra. Coeds enjoyed the opportunity for turn-
about, too. Everyone, from the engaged man whose ﬁancee
footed the bill, to the bashful boy who had been too shy
to ask for a date, found Heart Hop to his liking.

Interclass Sing

A bit of friendly competition among the
women's classes is an important part of the winter
scene at Pitt. This competition takes place at In-
terclass Sing when the classes vie with each other
in tunes and skits planned around a central theme.
The best skit each year, though is the one given
by the judges—faculty and administrators perform
in costume, to the delight of the assembly. And
no matter which class wins, the women have a
great deal of fun in staging their entertainment.

Assemblies Committee

Student Congress

The long range plan of Student Congress this year
has been to build an awareness and understanding of the
place of student government on Pitt’s campus. A Student
Government Clinic was arranged to acquaint all students
with this plan. For the opening session of the Clinic,
student leaders, faculty, and administration discussed the
question, “VVhat is the role of student government in the
life of a university?” That afternoon an open meeting of

Congress members. The culmination of the Congress plan
came in the spring when a student-faculty administration
week-end conference was held.

The four major Congress committees developed full
campus programs of their own, too. The social committee
purchased a much-needed public address system, and
established a workable renting program so that it could
be used by all organizations. Rental fees covered the origi-
nal cost of the unit.

The appointments committee had the responsibility
of selecting capable leaders for various social events and
campus programs. Besides choosing Spring Festival
directors, and chairmen for the High School Day and Dads
Day programs, this committee had a new appointment to
make—a responsible chairman for the Commons Room
Christmas Ball, the first dance of its kind in the history
of the University.

Chapel services, one of the most beautiful of Pitt’s
traditions under the sponsorship of another Congress
committee once each month. The traditions committee of
WSGA worked closely with Student Congress in this
activity.

' The successful organization of pep rallies -was one
result of the work of the assemblies committee of Congress.
Besides the regular pre-game rallies, this - committee
planned the special bonfire rally on the night before the
Ohio State game.

Temporary committees, chosen internally, also do a
large portion of Congress’ work. Outstanding among these
special groups was the committee that conducted the Red
Cross Donors Campaign. Through extensiye publicity
and ﬁne organization the committee enlisted over three
hundred donors, and brought the Red Cross Bloodmobile
to Pitt’s campus for two full days. Another special com-
mittee handled the Pitt Chest Drive, the combined chari-
ties plan which raises money for bo‘th Community Chest
organizations and for the m_en’s and women’s loan funds
right here on campus. The Chest Drive committee organ-
ized the campaign on a two—semester basis.

The closely—uniﬁed organization and strong spirit of
cooperation among Student Congress Members this year
has made the campus government group one of the most
powerful and effective organizations at Pitt.

WSGA

The Women’s Self Government Association is
certainly true to its name, for it is a democratic govern-
ment encompassing evrey woman at Pitt. Unique among
other similar campus organization, WSGA is the women’s
method of fostering loyalty, fellowship and activities on
campus. The cooperation found in this group is but one
evidence of the ‘success it has achieved in enriching the
campus life of women.

To give balance and unity to the actual administra-
tion of its goals, WSGA is divided into three parts: Com-
mission, Senior Court, and Executive.

Commission is the legislature, with the duties of
formulating and determining the policies of WSGA.
Composed of the elected oﬂicers, chairmen of standing
committees, representatives of every women’s organization
on campus, and Guild Advisers for the freshmen. Com-
mission also acts as the coordinating agency for all
women’s activities.

Senior Court, made up of seven delegated senior
women, interprets the spirit of WSGA. Also within
Court’s realm is the responsibility of supervising elections
in the Spring, regulating the point scale evaluation of
activities, aiding in the freshman program, and sponsoring
the Chancellor's Open House each year.

The Executive body has charge of transacting the
business of the Association in the interimsbetween Com-
mission meetings. _

WSGA’s calendar of events is wide and varied.
Starting with an opening conference at White Sulphur
Springs in September, the Commission formulated its
year’s policy and laid basic plans for 1951-52. The first
all-campus project tackled was the “Books for Berlin”
drive in October. Headed by the Public Relations chair-
man, the drive resulted in over 1200 textbooks sent to the
University ofFree Berlin to ward off the threat of Com-
munism »in Germany. The annual meeting of all the
women of the University took the form ofa fashion show.

The main bulk of work accomplished by WSGA took
place in its twelve standing committees: Activities, Cus-
toms, High School Relations, Housing, Johnstown Ad-
visory, Scholastic Honors, Social Traditions, Transfer,
Twelfth Floor, Vade Mecum, and Vocational Conference.
The Johnstown Advisory Committee was an addition to
the list this past year. It was created to fill the need of
acquainting Johnstown transfers to the life on campus.

Particularly active this year was VVSGA’s guild sys-
tem for freshman women. Under this plan the girls serve
an apprenticeship period in some campus activity, learning
the purpose and function of that activity at Pitt. When
they finished this practical training period, the freshmen
were ready to participate freely and capably in campus
activities.

Men’s Council

The year 1952 was truly an outstanding one for Men’s
Council, the men’s student government organization. For
today, on the eighth floor, is a realized dream of this hard-
working group——the Men's Lounge. Since 1948 Men's
Council had been striving for a place where men could
listen to music, play ping—pong, cards, and generally
relax in the busy life at Pitt. The proﬁt from the Used
Book Store project was set aside to fulﬁll their goal -and
this past year enough money was collected to purchase
the furniture and equipment which is now in active use,
thanks to the energy and careful thought of these men.
The upkeep and improvement of the Lounge is but oneiof
the responsibilities of Council, though.

Perhaps their biggest and most important work is the
organizing and supervision of the Freshman Orientation
Program. Within this extensive program is included the
actual orienting of freshmen by upperclass lﬁpunselors,
administering of the customs test, and the Panllher‘Key
Ceremony, which recognizes those freshmen who have
proved themselves worthy of honor.

Successful Mixer Dances were still another product of
Men’s Council, in conjunction with the Social Committee
of WSGA. The dances provided an opportunity for fresh-
man men and women to meet and enjoy themselves.
Popular music and refreshments added to their fun.

The senior class of the University had a full year of
fun and cooperation in 1952. These girls included in their
busy schedule many events that will be looked back on
in their alumnal years as some of the best hours spent in
Pitt’s activities.

A Hallowe’en theme was used for the initial mass
meeting. Early in December the women gathered again for
a Taﬂy Pull on the 12th ﬂoor. They learned the funda-
mentals of candy—making and kitchen use. With the theme
of “Labor Day at Pitt,” the seniors worked on Inter—class
Sing with the hope of recapturing the cup won in their
freshman year. '

In conjunction with the junior class, a barn dance was
held in January at North Park. Square dancing and coffee
kept them warm. In March a different type of entertain-
ment was enjoyed. The class trouped to Juvenile Court
and provided skits and games for the children.

The climax of four years together came in April when
the senior class united for its Farewell Banquet.

If an amateur photographer, or just anyone who had
a picture taken last summer entered, she may have won
the prize in the junior class photo contest in September.
Or if any junior had a birthday within the last year, prob-
ably she came to the junior class birthday party. Every
junior girl was invited to the great big party in honor of
all the birthdays in the class of 1953.

And that was only the beginning of the activities of
the junior class. The secretary’s minutes proved that this
year kept the girls busy from September till June. A visit
to a home for aged women gave all of the juniors a chance
to join in and not only have fun themselves, but also to
help someone else have a little fun.

These girls climaxed the year with a hearty dinner on
the twelfth ﬂoor, prepared by, eaten by, and enjoyed by
the women of the junior class.

The year added up to a ﬁne success and showed that
all of the learning isn’t in the books.

Looks like another successful project completed.

Time out from work, with a big smile.

The gold and blue scrapbook opened, and the sopho-
more women looked back to the story of a wonderful
second year, told through pictures and souvenirs. As the
pages are turned, one by one, the sophomore class re-
membered.

The class paper helped to keep each girl up to date
the whole year on the happenings around Pitt and carried
specks of gossip, too, about what the rest of the 1954 girls
were doing and thinking.

On another page of the scrapbook, November 20 was
lﬁted as an important day for these active girls. On that
day a “get—acquainted” dance for all sophomores—men
and women—brought many new faces and names to be
added to the long list of interested and interesting ’54’s.

The book is filled with memories of work and good
times—big class meetings for business only; more class
meetings just for socials, sometimes featuring prominent
speakers; interclass sing practices and at last the show;
and ﬁnally late in the spring, the annual class picnic.

Freshman Council

Freshman women are introduced to University Self-
Government through Freshman Council. This group is
composed of one elected’ delegate from each orientation
class and is presided over by the Vice - President of
WSGA. .

Council does not have any officers, but in order to keep
a record of the proceedings, Barbara Ann Douglas was
elected Secretary to be helped by Marlene Blumenthal and
Jean Falbo.

To facilitate the work of Council, the group divided
into a By—Laws Committee and a Social Committee each
having separate meetings. Council, then acting as a body,
acted upon each group's recommendations. In these
meetings the Class of I955’s Constitution was drawn up
as well associal functions for the entire class.

Through these activities and participating in Inter-
Class Sing, Council became the organizers of the freshman
women into an integrated body-The Class of I95 5.

Alpha Tau Delta

Pres. Nina Mack

Sec. Edna Garner
Treas. Peggy VValls
Adv. Florence Erickson

Alpha Tau Delta, a professional sorority for nursing
students, was formed at Pitt on May 12, 1945. Its aim is
to foster friendship among college women studying nursing.
The qualiﬁcations for membership are that a woman be a
junior in either the basic or advanced nursing program,
and that she maintain a {.5 quality point average.

Pledging on December 6 followed a busy rushing
period. The eligible women were entertained at a Circus
Party and later, a Heaven Party. In January the new
members were honored at an initiation banquet.

Two formal dances, one in January and another in
May, were the chief social affairs of the year.

Alpha Tau Delta does much to further its aims of
friendship among the women at Pitt who have chosen the
nursing profession. The organization is under the direction
of the Misses Florence Erickson, Marie Gnus, and Dorothy
Mereness.

Through stimulating discussion centering around
their careers in medicine and the progress and changes in
that ﬁeld, the women who belong to Alpha Tau Delta
receive an excellent preparation for their profession. And,
because of the close spirit of comradeship in the group,
they ﬁnd membership in it -to be a rich and satisfying ex-
perience.

Arnold Air Society

The Arnold Air Society was organized in the spring of
1949. Previously it was known as Prop and \\'ing and
functioned as a local group on the campus. The organiza-
tion now belongs to a national honorary Air Force fra-
ternity with chapters throughout the country. It strives
to advance the military preparedness and protection of
our country, to increase our knowledge of the scope and
mission of the U. S. Air Force, and to maintain the spirit
of the R.O.T.C.

Pitt's chapter of the society organized several social
functions throughout the year. The Christmas party,
pledge smokers and picnics were held for the members and
personnel of the military department. One of the_high-
lights of the year was a trip to an Air Force Base in which
members were conducted through the base to see it in
operation.

The Arnold Air Society taps for members twice a
year—at the beginning of the fall and spring semesters.
Qualiﬁcations for membership are a 2.0 average in R.O.T.C.
and a 1.5 overall average in the University.

Organized to meet a relatively new need and function
on campus, the society has developed with amazing ra-
pidity. This may be attributed largely to the spirit of its
members. Future Air Force men seen after class with Sergeant Bucklew.

With the approval from the Dean of the School of
Pharmacy the men who are studying to be pharmacists
are invited to membership in Alpha Zeta Omega. This
professional fraternity was founded at the Pittsburgh
College of Pharmacy in 1926 as a national organization.
The active chapters now number 23, with the Mu chapter
at Pitt ranking as one of the largest, most active, and most
enthusiastic in the country. And the Chapter is proud of
Mr. Oscar Roth who represents them nationally on the
Board of Directors of the fraternity.

Two of the major projects of the Mu chapter ‘help to
encourage pharmacy students. One of these is the presenta-
tion of a yearly award to the pharmacy student who has
attained the highest scholastic achievement in all courses
through his freshman and sophomore years. The second
big project is the support of the Bernard L. Cohen Me-
morial Fund, a student loan fund established by Mu
chapter.

The men contribute to progress in their ﬁeld also
through the AZO National Culture Fund.

Their meetings throughout the year bring together
graduate pharmacists and undergraduate students of
pharmacy for relaxation and stimulating discussions of
national, as well as pharmaceutical, topics.

Alpha Kappa Psi, the oldest professional commerce
fraternity in existence, has some 80 chapters in leading
colleges and universitites all over the United States.
Founded at New York University in 1904, the fraternity’s
main goal is to promote better understanding of our busi_
ness world.

Pitt’s chapter believes in a blending of practical edu-
cation and good fellowship. To further the first aim,
prominent speakers from various business ﬁelds gave the
members an advantageous slanton actual procedures used
in industry.

Members worked together to foster scientiﬁc research
in the ﬁelds of ﬁnance, commerce, and accounts, as well
as to educate the public in the ideals of these fields.

A spirit of good fellowship grew from such successful
events as the fall smoker, the pledge dance at South Park,
the Christmas party at Children’s Hospital, and as a
climax, the annual spring formal and a farewell picnic.
The picnic was held at the Grove City farm of Charlie
Sheppard, founder of the Alpha Kappa Psi chapter at Pitt.

Membership in the fraternity is open to any Business
Administration student who meets the scholastic and
personal requirements.

The Student Aﬂiliate of the American Chemical So-
ciety has made rapid strides in the past year in promoting
the aims of its parent organization, the American Chemical
Society. Beginning with a reorganization plan in mind, the
Pitt chapter has recruited new members-—men who are
taking up chemistry at the University of Pittsburgh or
interested in chemistry. Progress has included the first
A.C.S. newspaper ever written at Pitt.

“Bring out the cards, boys!”

To become a full—fledged member of A.C.S. a college
degree is necessary, but nevertheless students can take
advantage of the facilities open to the graduate members.
Events have included movies, talks——the students par-
ticularly enjoyed the speakers on job opportunities in
chemistry——and tours through plants.

A highlight of this year’s activity was the regional
meeting at Pennsylvania College for Women. Conducted
on the basis of meetings of the parent organization, this
session had representatives from all student A.C.S.
chapters in the area. These student chemists read original
research papers to the other delegates.

With more interest and more members, Pitt chapter
of A.C.S. has gone a long way in promoting chemistry
among students.

Alpha Omega, national dental fraternity, has been on
the University of Pittsburgh’s campus for thirty-one
years. In this time, it has carried out to the fullest the
purpose of furthering the professional aims and bearing
of the brothers. A comprehensive program of extra-cur—
ricular clinics were given by men outstanding in the var-
ous ﬁelds of dentistry—prosthodontia, exodontia, ortho-
dontia, periodontia, etc. These clinics have been supple-

mented with sound movies on technique and other data
along dental lines.

A full social program was also integrated with the
professional—clinical schedule. Annual events such as the
Barn Dance, held in October, and the Senior Banquet, in
the spring, gave the brothers a time for relaxation. At
the Banquet, the graduating seniors were honored with
awards for fraternalism, and scholarship. All the affairs
ofAlpha Omega were held in conjunction with the alumni,
so that their close ties could be preserved.

As in the past, Alpha Omega again sponsored an
award to the highest scholastic senior in the School of
Dentistry. This cup is in keeping with the fraternity’s
emphasis on scholastic attainment and devotion to career.

A Christmas collection of toys was only one of the
many services of the Alpha Phi Omega’s this year. The
toy collection was made in cooperation with Pittsburgh
Boy Scout troops, for Alpha Phi Omega is an honorary
scouting service fraternity. The chapter here at Pitt was
the second of its kind to be formed. Now there are 9.42
chapters throughout the United States. One of the chief
projects in 1951 was working at summer scout camps.

The men of this honorary are in continuous service to
Pitt. Some of these services include ushering at commence-
ment exercises, proctoring at Freshman Week events
and also for the men’s custom exams; and Pitt Chest Fund
speakers and workers.

But it is not only work for the men, but also fun and
plenty of spirit. As Spring Carnival, the Alpha Phi
Omega’s operated a food concession booth. In December
many of the members attended a regional convention in
Washington, D. C. The Panther campaign to buy a live
Panther as Pitt’s mascot was one of the biggest drives
of the year at Pitt.

A real introduction to a career in medicine is available
to members of Alpha Epsilon Delta, national pre-medical
fraternity. The organization binds together undergradu-
ates with similar professional goals and promotes their
interest in outstanding scholarship and achievement.

Leading educators and physicians are frequent guests
at the monthly meetings of the AED’s. Fraternity mem-
bers and professional men talk together about recent
developments in the ﬁeld of medicine.

Highlight of the fraternity’s 1951 calendar was the
national convention at Tuscaloosa, Alabama, in March.
Local representatives exchanged ideas with pre-medical
students from all over the United States.

Members of the Fraternity have a chance, too, to
see a practical application of their career plans. Trips to
the University’s School of Medicine, Western Psychiatric
Hospital, and the Pittsburgh Mortuary School are a
regular part of the agenda. AED’s also spend several of
their free hours observing operations at Presbyterian
Hospital.

The pre-med group doesn’t neglect the social aspects
of its calendar, either. A dinner dance was successfully
planned for January, and several picnics were held in the

spring.

The largest membership in the history of Alpha Beta
Gamma——over one hundred active members—sparked
Pitt’s chapter of the professional elementary education
sorority on to an exceptionally active year. The purpose
of the sorority is to promote unity among the students of
elementary education, to foster a wider social and cultural
life, and to promote fellowship between faculty and
administration.

Through monthly meetings, outstanding speakers,
and socials, Alpha Beta Gamma helps to accomplish its
purpose. The annual picnic and square dance plus a Christ-
mas party provided ample entertainment for the members.
Many noted speakers such as George W. Hoffman, and
G. A. Yoakum spoke to the formal meetings.

Junior and senior women registered in the ﬁeld of
elementary education are eligible for membership in this
organization——membership that will help to develop and
stimulate interest in higher professional standards in their
chosen ﬁelds.

Alpha Beta Gamma was founded on Pitt’s campus in
1904.. From the small nucleus of women who then planned
to teach in elementary schools, it has steadily grown to its
present capacity membership. This is indicative of the
sorority’s ability to recognize the changing needs of its
campus, and to successfully meet those needs.

School, entered the field as professionals, many ﬁnding
major positions in the armed forces.

Delegates from the fraternity were elected as repre-
sentatives to the annual conclave at Cleveland, where all
chapters swapped ideas and future plans. Also, clinics,
featuring Various honored members of the dental profes-
sion, were presented to give their views on current dental
material. As a sign of progress, Delta Sigma Delta partici-
pated in the annual VVestern Pennsylvania Odontological
Society meeting in December.

On the social scene, pledge parties were held for the
incoming freshmen. The formal at the South Hills Country
Club was unforgettably beautiful. House parties, picnics,
and stags rounded out the year. In sports, Delta Sig was
highly active in intramurals, such as soccer and softball.

An awareness of the rapidly changing career ﬁelds
open to its members has kept Delta Sigma Delta very
much alive and active on campus. Discussions of oppor-

Delta Delta Lambda, honorary business education
fraternity, is named in honor of Dr. Daniel Lessenberry,
professor in business education. The organization had its
origin in November of 1934. Junior and senior students in
the department recognized the need of a club to further
the principles for which they stood.

The fraternity has completed another year of fruitful
activities. At the regular business meetings, outstanding
business leaders spoke on percent progress in the ﬁeld of
business education. An Open House for department stu-
dents in October, and an initiation banquet for new members
at the Fairfax in November, rounded out the busy social
season, which also included parties and picnics.

All of Delta Delta Lambda’s activities have been built
on the premise of encouraging and honoring outstanding
scholarship in the ﬁeld of business education. In keeping
with this premise, a 2.0. average or better for at least one
semester is necessary for membership in the fraternity.
Men and women who are invited to join are challenged to
consistently maintain their high scholastic standing. With
a foundation as solid as this, Delta Delta Lambda has had

As the Alpha Chapter of Cwens, Founders’ Day is a
little extra-special for the Pitt Cwens. This year‘ the
Carnegie Tech chapter was invited for the celebration on
November 7. It was a ﬁne tribute to honor the founder,
Thyrsa Amos.

But Cwens, a sophomore scholastic honorary, are
known about Pitt not only because of their founding here.
The Cwen Directory, a publication containing the names,
addresses, and phone numbers of all Pitt women, is a
valuable book to every Pitt student and was published by
the active chapter.

The girls served as hostesses at many university
functions, such as: commencement, coronation, Freshman
Tea, Chancellor’s reception, and Chapel services. Most
of the Cwens have taken Nationality Room hostess train-
ing, too. And to help freshmen get acquainted with activi-
ties, the chapter acted as guild advisors.

With all of this work, Cwens found time to relax at
socials with last year’s Cwens, at the actives’ Christmas
dinner, and at the Cwen Rainbow, a party for all Cwens
still attending Pitt.

Cwens spend only their sophomore years as active
members, but membership is for life.

VVith the purpose ofstimulating interest in scholarship

State in 1907. Delta chapter at Pitt was formed in 1920
and joined this‘ busy group of six activities fraternities.

Membership is open to sophomore and junior men
who have done outstanding work in campus activities.
In addition to active members, Druids tap, as honorary
members, faculty men who stimulate-student participa-
tion in activities. Two faculty men and ﬁfteen students
were thus tapped and initiated on January 4, 1952, at
Jackie Heller’s Spotlight Room in Pittsburgh.

In 1949 this fraternity was activated for the ﬁrst time
in three years. It quickly regained the prominent position
that it had formerly held on campus. In 1951-52, Druids
kept to a busy schedule which included participation in
Tap Day, Spring Festival, and freshman smokers. Other
projects were ushering at University functions, upper—class
counselors, freshman camp counselors, and Pitt Chest
Fund speakers. The coin-changer near the telephone booths
on the ground floor is a 1952 Druid presentation to Uni-
versity life.

Under the capable leadership of Ludwig Lippert, this
activities fraternity acted as a real nucleus for many Pitt
activities.

Cypress Avenue Tech, a name completely unfamiliar
to the Pitt student body, is the home of the largest non-
resident group on campus. As Johnstown Center transfers,
the Johnstown Association members bridge the gap be-
tween those Flood-Free City students who take their
ﬁrst two years at the Johnstown school and complete
their undergraduate work at the Cathedral of Learning.

Organized three years ago with its main purpose that
of making the Johnstown Centerites feel at home among

the thousands of students at Pitt, its members can be seen
meeting in the Commons Room. VVhen not there, the
members hold their meetings in the Panther room.
There, they discuss all sorts of business—from that of
making a 1oo% blood contribution to standardizing the
week-end commuters’ fee.

On the Pittsburgh campus, the Association lends a
helping hand by giving transfers information on activities,
registration, courses, dating, and sorority and fraternity
rushing. As results, they look with pride to those Asso-
ciation members who have made good in their short stay
on campus. Joanne Sheehan, Senior Mentor and a member
of Mortar Board, is an example.

Above all, the Association prides itself on making
transfers feel that, not only the Johnstown Center, but
also the Cathedral of Learning, is “their” school.

A long time ago—in 1879, to be eXact—a group of
students in pharmacy organized Kappa Psi as a profes-
sional pharmacy fraternity. The Beta Kappa chapter of
Kappa Psi, since its inception at Pitt in 1913, has endeav-
ored to advance professionalism and fraternalism in the
ﬁeld of pharmacy.

Kappa Psi, one of the largest professional fraternities
in the United States, boasts of forty-one active collegiate
chapters.

Highlight of the Beta Kappa Chapter is the Alvin 
Vavro award. This honor is intended for the outstanding
sophomore student of the School of Pharmacy. The Beta
Kappa Chapter established this award in memory of a
deceased brother. The student who earns the annual
award is chosen by a committee of the Dean, faculty
members, and chapter members.

Highlights of Kappa Psi’s social year are the Province
Convention and the annual Senior banquet. Numerous
informal and social affairs plus an active pledging period
crowded the social program.

By adhering closely to fraternity aims and participat-
ing in an interesting social program, members have main-

Kappa Kappa Psi is the service organization behind
the University marching band. VVhen a visiting band is
served hot coﬂee at a Saturday game, it is Kappa Kappa
Psi members who are responsible. The organizing of the
band shows is one of the major jobs of the honorary, along
with assisting in the direction of the performances.

But the band is not all marching and music because
Kappa Kappa Psi includes in its plans for the year lots of
social af¥airs—some stag, but more often date parties. And
the band members are kept informed, too, by the special
newspaper that this service group publishes.

One of the Bands main events was the annual Sta-
dium Review. Review night is particularly important to
the band, for on that night Kappa Kappa Psi presents a
trophy to the Outstanding Bandsman of the year. This
awardee is chosen by the members of the band and the
directors.

Although the fraternity is still quite new—this is its
ﬁfth year on campus—the initiation banquet and the ﬁre-
light pledging ceremony have already become well-estab-
lished traditions.

Through the help and service of Kappa Kappa Psi,
the bandsmen’s honorary, the Pitt Varsity Marching
Band is a high—stepping, high-ranking band.

Since its founding in 1926 Tau chapter of Kappa Phi
Kappa, national professional fraternity for men in educa-
tion, has been active on Pitt’s campus. From its beginning
as a national organization in 1922, it has grown into a
group of over 50 chapters, which work toward common
goals—social activities, scholastic attainment, and pro-
fessional ideals.

It is the purpose of Kappa Phi Kappa to discover and
bring into its fraternal association, early in the professional
training, those who will prepare for and accept the re-
sponsibilities of leadership in the ﬁeld ofeducation. Kappa
Phi Kappa provides mutual encouragement and inspira-
tion through a fraternity brotherhood.

The organization is unique in that it is both honorary
and professional. All of its members are in the ﬁeld of
education and all must maintain a high scholastic rating.

The fraternity strives toward sending forth men who
will conscientiously and intelligently train the youth of
today to understand the problems of mankind. At the
present time, under the leadership of Mr. George W.
Hoffman, the faculty adviser, the chapter has 57 pros-
pective leaders in all ﬁelds of education.

Lambda Kappa Sigma

Adv. Mrs. Jeanne S. Capelli

A preoccupation with pills and powder didn’t prevent

the women of Lambda Kappa Sigma, honorary pharma-
?ceutical fraternity, from having a busy, active year.

Their broad social calendar included an alumni ban-
quet, a party at South Park's Totem Pole Lodge, and a
Christmas dinner dance.

Besides all the planning for rushing parties and pledge
periods, Lambda Kappa Sigma members found time to
sell Christmas cards and run a successful bake sale. Pro-
ceeds from these sales were used to extend the fraternity’s
scientiﬁc and social program.

Pitt’s undergraduate chapter was particularly proud
of its close bond with the Delta Graduate chapter of the
fraternity in the School of Pharmacy.

Unique in its field, the fraternity allows an oppor-
tunity for similarly interested students to become ac-
quainted, and enjoy their common interest in pharmacy.

Organized at the end of the ﬁrst world war—in I91 8—
the organization fulﬁlled the needs of a small group of
women pharmacy students. Since then it has grown rapidly
adopting itself to the large increase in the number of these
women students. There are now twenty—seven national
chapters of Lambda Kappa Sigma, and the additional
responsibility of membership in the professional Pan—Hel—
lenic Association—a responsibility merited by the high
quality of the fraternity.

Mortar Board, the national honorary for outstanding
senior women, has a busy group on the Pitt campus. Rep-
resenting the nucleus of extra-curricular activities this
organization strives to render service, honor learning and
foster worthy leadership for the University. Through the
sharing of group thinking on University, national and life
problems, Mortar Board hopes to provide personal enrich-
ment for each member, each organization the members
represent, and ultimately, enrichment in whatever future
life these women may participate.

Following dinner every two weeks, Mortar Board had
discussions with such prominent people as Dr. Finney on
music. When Dr. Hovey spoke on French art, the girls
really set the mood with a Parisienne-cooked dinner and
menus in French! Parties with ODK and Tech’s "chapter of
Mortar Board were also part of the year’s agenda of inte-
grated social and intellectual enlightenment.

Spring brought with it the traditional events of hon-
oring freshman women for scholastic achievement at
Scholar’s Day, and the tapping of outstanding junior
women on Tap Day. On May twenty-fourth these tappees
were initiated in the Commons Room. Thus the 1951-52
Mortar Board passed on its ideals and traditions to another
worthy group of women.

After a week-end trip, ﬁlled with ﬁshing, hunting, and
hiking at Tionesta Camp, Tionesta, Pennsylvania, the
Non-Nomens came back to Pitt to begin their third year
on campus. Although still called a “young” organization,
the Non-Nomens are well known about Pitt. Athletics
made up an important part of this year’s program because
of the organization’s basketball, football, and softball
teams, which participated in all intramural sports. And
more about sports came at their stag parties where movies
of the Pitt football games played away from home were
often shown.

Picnics, and weiner roasts at North Park, parties at
the homes of some of the members, and a mid-term semi-
formal dance at the Fort Pitt Hotel made up the social cal-
endar for the year for the Non-Nomens. And, as a climax,
in the spring the members went, en masse, to Visit the
Appalachian Mountain area. At school or away on week-
end trips, the Non-Nomens enjoyed their third year of
organization and look forward to an even busier future.

Outstanding undergraduates in the ﬁeld of biological
sciences are recognized by Nu Sigma Sigma, honorary
science fraternity. The organization annually plans sum-
mer ﬁeld trips, lectures by men prominent in some phase
of biological science, and individual research projects.

High point in the fraternity agenda is the awarding of
the Warren R. Witz Memorial scholarship, given to an
undergraduate biological science major who has demon-
strated his worth both in his academic record and in his
interest in his major ﬁeld. Presented each year on Scholar's
Day, the award is ﬁfty dollars to be applied toward the
recipient’s tuition fees. The scholarship is a memorial to
Dr. W. Witz, late professor of biology and adviser to Nu
Sigma Sigma.

The fraternity has a full social calendar, too, including
an initiation and senior banquet in the spring. A Christ-
mas party with Alpha Epsilon Delta, an open house for
biology majors, and a series of technical movies completed
Nu Sigma Sigma’s busy program.

To junior and senior students who have maintained
outstanding scholastic records at Pitt, Pi Tau Phi awards
membership. The honorary scholastic fraternity, whose
membership is principally made _up of undergraduate
students, has also included in recent years graduate stu-
dents who meet the active membership requirements.

Twice annually, during the fall and spring semesters,
the group welcomes new members at its traditional initia-
tion banquet. Pi Tau Phi members conduct bi‘-monthly
business meetings. These meetings and their informal social
gatherings give the members an opportunity to build
group spirit and group participation.

The purpose of the organization which recognizes
intellectual leadership is fully stated in this excerpt from
its constitution: “We, the members of Pi Tau Phi, do here-
by band together to conserve and spread scholarship, cul-
ture, and idealism . . . always striving by all sound methods
to stimulate serious thought and true intellectual stand-
ards.” Membership in this fraternity is an honor and a

at Washingon and Lee University in 1914 in the tradition
of the idealism and leadership of George Washington and
Robert Lee. The founders believed that an honorary soci-

dents an opportunity for leadership and co—operative
service. The Pitt chapter was begun in 1916 and has fa-
thered the ideals of its founders and Pitt campus. Every
year in December and May the ceremony awarding mem-
bership is held. The awardees must meet these ﬁne qualiﬁ-
cations: character, leadership, scholarship, fellowship, and
democratic ideals. With members chosen on a foundation
as solid as this, the fraternity has a proud record of success

Phi Chi Theta, national commerce fraternity for

higher business education and training for all women, to
foster high ideals for women in business, and to encourage
cooperation among women preparing for such careers.” Ep-
silon chapter at Pitt welcomes students in day and evening
classes of the Business Administration school who main-
tain high scholarship, high character, and active participa-
tion in activities.

This year, Phi Chi Theta had an active schedule of
combined education-social alfairs. To start the year, they
went to Oglebey Park for a weekend of funiand acquaint-
ance. Monthly dinners with well-known speakers at down-
town hotels gave the women a view into the business world.
In October this organization sponsored a beneﬁt at the
Playhouse to replenish its scholarship fund. The scholar-
ships were awarded to two outstanding women in Business
Administration on Scholar’s Day in the Spring.

The only honorary for freshman men at Pitt is Phi
Eta Sigma. Men who have completed one semester with a
quality point average of 2.5 or above or have an over-all
average of 2. 5 for their ﬁrst two semesters are eligible for
tapping in this honorary. Tapping is done twice yearly, in
the spring and in the fall; and their initiation banquets
are held at these times also. One feature of Phi Eta Sigma
that is not common to most honoraries is that members
are active all four years at Pitt.

For a number of years the main activity of this group
has been the tutoring of students who are having diHicul-
ties with their courses. Another project for this year will
be the establishment of a chapter of the honorary at Pitt’s
Johnstown Center.

Last year Phi Eta Sigma made its ﬁrst freshman
award to the man who had maintained the highest scho-
lastic average and contributed most to Pitt life.This award

In 1892 Psi Omega was founded nationally for dental
students, and more than ﬁfty years ago, the Nu Chapter at
Pitt was begun. Since the founding here, the Psi O’s have
raised their membership to 85 actives and have had a good
inﬂuence in both social and scholastic ﬁelds. These den-
tistry students, along with their full schedules of classes
and study, have time out for sports with their trophy-
winning football, basketball, and softball teams. Their
social life is not neglected at their house on North Belle-
ﬁeld, which the actives are at work remodeling.

Psi Omega was founded for two main purposes, both
of equal importance to the members. These two purposes
are: ﬁrst, to give its members the assistance, beneﬁts, and
advantages beyond the scope of individual attainment in
both academic and social life; and second, for the advance-
ment of the dental profession through its membership here
in school and in practice. The successful pursuance of
these aims has been achieved through the unselﬁsh efforts
of its thirty—three active chapters and numerous alumni
chapters throughout the country’s dentistry schools, their
Supreme Council, and a national publication, The Frater.

Outstanding workers on campus publications are
recognized by Pi Delta Epsilon, national honorary journal-
ism fraternity.

Besides fostering an interest in better college jour-
nalism, the fraternity provides an opportunity for the
members of various publications to meet and discuss com-
mon problems and interests.

This year’s Pi Delt’s have taken on a new project—-
that of establishing an eighth ﬂoor publication lounge. One
wall of the lounge will feature a large plaque listing the
annual Pi Delt awardees.

The award, presented last spring for the ﬁrst time, is
based on leadership, character, and campus service in pub-
lications.

One of the highlights of the fraternity’s program is a
national convention, held every two years. The last one,
held in the spring of 1951, took place at the Virginia Poly-
technic Institute, Blacksburg, Virginia.

The largest delegation attending the convention came
from Pitt, in a special bus hired for the occasion.

Other plans on this year’s agenda include, besides
regular dinner meetings, an intercollegiate dance, a Found-
er’s Day dinner dance, and the regular Pi Delta Epsilon
spring banquet.

Quo Vadis, honorary sorority for Nationality Room
hostesses, enjoyed a busy, successful season in endeavoring
to fulﬁll its goal of interpreting to visitors the true meaning
and the spirit of the rooms.

Programs for the year emphasized the relationship be-
tween all countries and peoples. Students who had visited
abroad during the summer told of their trips; Pitt's Inter-
national Club took part in the Quo Vadis Christmas cele-
bration, and foreign members of the faculty spoke on the
customs of their lands.

A new phase of hostessing included training groups of
freshman men about the Nationality Rooms. Also, during
United Nations weekend, the rooms were open to all visi-
tors, particularly the high school students in the Pitts-
burgh area.

In addition to regular tour activities, Quo Vadis
members each “adopted” one particular room, and worked
along with the room's committee in commemorating any
national holidays. Highlight of this “adoption” was the
Christmas celebration in the rooms. Each Quo Vadis
member worked to decorate the room according to the
customs of the country, under the guidance of the com-
mittee.

organization, which is to foster friendship between women
science majors, and develop interest in varied ﬁelds of
science, was fulﬁlled through working together on various
projects.

Members are chosen from the upperclass women who
have a suﬁicient number of credits to indicate a major in
one of the sciences. A high scholastic rating in the major
and in all other fields is also required.

In February, QuaX’s annual initiation banquet was
held. Before that, open house in November brought Dr.
Mary VVarga of Pitt’s Spectroscopic Laboratory and Dr.
Phyllis Cook Martin, Biology professor at P.C.W., to speak
on woman power in science. Quax visited Mellon Institute,
Heinz plant, and the Phipps Conservatory. General dis-
cussion groups also met continuously throughout the
two semesters. -

while in school and in continuing their work after gradua-
tion.

of '51 were called to duty very shortly after graduation
had a sobering effect upon the entire corps. ‘This year’s
class has every expectation of a call to active duty im—
mediately, on commissioning.

Despite all this, morale of the corps continues as high
as ever. Every activity receives the fullest measure of
cheerful cooperation. The honorary fraternities, Scabbard
and Blade and the Pershing Riﬂes, have ambitious sched-
ules of activities which are very well supported. In addition,
the cadets of the Engineer Corps support a chapter of the
Society of American Military Engineers.

The riﬂe team has continued to add laurels to its
already enviable record.

The years _since 1948 have seen the passing of Pitt's
ROTC Artillery unit. In June of 1950 the last class of

ROTC men take it easy at Fort Lee Summer Camp.

At the present time the Army ROTC consists on the
undergraduate level of two units, the Engineers and the
Quartermasters. Both units offer a four—year course leading
to a second lieutenant’s commission. The Engineers re-
cruit their personnel almost exclusively from the School
of Engineering and Mines. The Quartermaster unit is
recruited largely from the School of Business Administra-
tion and from the College. In each case an effort is made to
recruit those students who have acquired a technical
specialty which will be of particular Value to one or other
of the technical services.

At the end of the Junior year the Engineer cadets go
to Fort Be'lvoir for six weeks of practical training. At the
same time the Quartermaster cadets go to Fort Lee. For
most, this is their first real experience with army life.

In addition to the undergraduate units the ROTC'de-
partment has two units for graduate students in the fields
of medicine and dentistry. In the case of the Medical
Corps unit, cadets are recruited exclusively from the School
of Medicine. The Dental Corps unit is similarly restricted
to students in the Dental School.

The mission of the Air Force ROTC is to develop in
prospective college graduates the qualities of leadership
and other attributes essential to their progressive advance-
ment as commissioned ofﬁcers and prepare them for im-
mediate assignment to speciﬁc duties in the Regular Air
Force, Air Force Reserve, and the Air National Guard
units.

This mission is accomplished by teaching such basic
subjects as VVorld Political Geography, Leadership, Drill,
Exercise of Command, Aerodynamics and Propulsion,
Navigation, Meteorology, and Applied Air Power during
the first two years of the student's college course.

Selected students who successfully complete the basic
course are permitted to enroll in the Advanced Course,
normally carried during the last two college years. At the
present time, specialized advanced courses are being of-
fered in Administration and Logistics, Flight Operations,

Basic AF ROTC instruction was inaugurated at
Johnstown Center this year. While the advanced course
is not conducted at Johnstown, students may complete
ROTC at the University of Pittsburgh.

The AF ROTC curriculum is designed to provide the
student with a balanced course of officer-development
training and oﬂicer-career training, both theoretical and
practical, which in conjunction with his academic curric-
ulum will qualify him to discharge all duties and responsi-
bilities which may be required of him as a junior oﬂicer of
any component of the Air Force, without further formal
schooling.

Extra-curricular activities sponsored or supported by
the AF ROTC are the Arnold Air Society, Pershing Riﬂes,
and various university and military riﬂe teams.

departments of the armed forces, is the only national un-
dergraduate honorary society of its kind. Organized on
the Pittsburgh campus in 1927, Company D ofthe Seventh
regiment has lived up to the high ideals set by its founders.
The major purpose of Scabbard and Blade is to promote
and reward eﬂiciency in the training of Reserve Oﬂicers
and to assist and support the Military Department.

This year the Company held a dance in cooperation
with the Duquesne University Company of Scabbard and
Blade. Besides sponsoring the annual Military Ball, the
men of Company D had various social smokers with mili-
tary leaders of the Pittsburgh district, at which military
subjects were reviewed by movies. The group also had in-
terfraternity events with the Pershing Riﬂes and the Ar-
nold Air Society. These included smokers, Korean war
movies and athletic competitions. In addition to its other
activities, the Company participated in the national inter-
company riﬂe marksmanship matches, which kept them
busy practicing all year ’round.

A strong spirit of comradeship and deep respect for
fraternity ideals make membership in Scabbard and Blade
a very satisfying experience.

Sigma Beta Sigma, professional engineering fraternity
was founded at the University of Pittsburgh. It was the
ﬁrst fraternity of this type to have a university affiliation,
and is now a first class corporation, incorporated under the
laws of Pennsylvania on May 8, 1938. Their purpose as
stated is to foster professional engineering and all that
the term implies.

Professional engineers and engineering undergradu-
ates with proper scholarship are considered for member-

ship. Pitt’s Alpha chapter now has approximately two
hundred and seventy—ﬁve members, most of whom are
executives or technical specialists of leading corporations.
Some members of the Pitt engineering faculty are also
included in its enrollment.

Sigma Beta Sigma meets the third Friday of every
school month. At these meetings outstanding engineers or
specialists in related ﬁelds give technical lectures of interest
to the members. Visitations to the plants in the district
supplement these lectures.

Social activities such as corn roasts, bowling parties,
picnics and dances are included in the year's agenda, also.
This year the fraternity again sponsored the fall formal for
the Evening School Association. With the theme of winter,
the Snowﬂake Ball was a big success for all concerned.

Sigma Kappa Phi, national honorary language fra-
ternity, admits to membership students of modern and
ancient languages who have shown marked ability in their
ﬁelds. Beta chapter of the organization was founded on
the University campus in 1921. Its purposes are to promote
high standards of scholarship among students in the de-
partment of foreign languages and to create a spirit of
cooperation among those students.

Sigma Kappa Phi’s program of the year was a com-
bination ofstudy and sociability. At their dinner meetings
the members heard speakers on such topics as Mexico,
Switzerland, and occupational opportunities for foreign
language students. Through the knowledge of culture,
geography and history of these foreign countries, the mem-
bers hope to improve their understanding of the language.
An Open House in the Spring gave the language organiza-
tions on campus an opportunity to entertain high school
students and the Pitt student body. Sponsored by Sigma
Kappa Phi, this evening was devoted to plays, speeches,
and dance and song recitals, all presented in a foreign
language.

Initiation of new tappees took place at the annual
Spring Banquet, where the new members entertained the
old by presenting skits in their qualifying language. With
this banquet, another successful year was complete.

The original chapter of Sigma Theta Tau was estab-
lished at Indiana School of Nursing in 1929.. Eta chapter,
founded at the University of Pittsburgh on June 3, 1946,
is now one of six existing chapters of the only national
scholarship society of nursing. a

One of the basic requirements of Sigma Theta Tau
is that the student has maintained at least a B average.
Not more than one ﬁfth of the total number of any one
graduation class may be elected to membership. One tenth
may be elected in the year preceding graduation and one
tenth in the year of graduation. Selected students who are
enrolled in the programs which lead to the Bachelor of
Science degree in Nursing, Bachelor of Science degree in
Nursing Education and Master’s or Doctorate degrees with
a major in Nursing Education are eligible to be tapped.

Members of the administrative and teaching staﬂ" of
the school of Nursing who have demonstrated marked
achievement in the ﬁeld of nursing and who have shown
special interest in Sigma Theta Tau may be elected as
associate members.

The purposes of this organization are high and aim to:
foster high professional standards, encourage research and
promote the maximum development of the nurse and thus
increase her capacity to serve her profession and through
it, society.

!!!!!!!!l

The Student Christian Federation is a council
composed of representatives from the different
religious groups on campus. The Lutheran Student
Association, the YMCA, the YWCA, the Pitkin
Club, and the VVestminster Foundation contribute
members. The organization’s purpose is to achieve
better cooperation among the member church
groups and to promote religious activity on the
campus. Once each month the,council gets to-
gether to make plans and to discuss the various
problems of the respective groups.

During the past summer the SCF organized
a Summer Religious Program. Each Tuesday
evening throughout July and August an outstand-
speaker was presented to the assembled people.
Various topics of great interest were discussed—
“Psychology and Religion,” “United Nations,”
“World Student Service Fund,” and “The Old
Testament."

During the past year, the group undertook
many activities. Two of the most important of
these activities were the Freshman Reception
held in the Stephen Foster Social Room last
September and the bus trip to the SVM Con-
ference held this year at Kansas University. This
trip was made possible largely through the efforts
of the SCF and Martha Dixon, president of the
YVVCA.

Another of the major activities of the group
was the publication of a brochure, presented to
the Pitt students for the beneﬁt of bringing to
them a better knowledge and understanding of
the Student Christian Federation.

Throughout the year the group strived to
bring a closer relationship between the school and
three of the national organizations it was aﬂiliated
with, the VVorld Student Service Fund, the World
Student Christian Federation, and the United
Students Christian Conference. It is the hope of
the group that the future councils will carry on
the work so ably started.

Adv. John D. Dinker

Sigma Tau, the only member of the Association of
College Honor Societies to have a chapter on the Pitt
campus, is a national honorary fraternity for engineers.
Its purposes are: to recognize the achievements of engi-
neering students, and to encourage fellowship among en-
gineering students. Men who have reached the level of
juniors are eligible on the basis ofscholarship, practicality,
and sociability.

The 1951-52 schedule for Sigma Tau was an even
blending of professional guidance and social aﬁcairs. The
oﬂicers felt that the social program planned would aid in
the development of character and professional pride for
which the fraternity stands. Included in their agenda was a
smoker in Stephen Foster on November 27 and Initiation
Banquet in the Faculty Club on December 17. At the
banquet, Dean Fitterer, Dean of Engineering and Mines
School was the guest speaker. In January the brothers
and their dates enjoyed a dance.

As an incentive to develop scholarship, Sigma Tau
gives two awards every year. A sophomore in the School of
Engineering who has achieved the highest scholastic rec-
ord during his freshman year receives a medal of recogni-
tion. As a contribution to the advancement of engineering
education, a scholarship for graduate study is given each
year to an outstanding senior.

Theatron, the honorary dramatic fraternity, enjoyed
a successful school year, in working closely with all Pitt
Players productions.

Using as their symbol the traditional Greek mask of
tragedy, a sign meaning “theater” throughout the world,
the group helps to stimulate and keep growing the appreci-
ation of “good theater" within their own ranks as well as
throughout the entire student body.

As rewards for outstanding acting and technical work,
Theatron honored deserving members with awards of
plaques and books. This kind of recognition for achieve-
ment has become an important tradition to the group.

The fraternity was organized on Pitt’s campus in
1938 to provide recognition for those students and faculty
members whose work in or with campus theatrical pro-
ductions was of superior quality.

Requirements for membership to Theatron are that
the candidate be a Pitt Player, and that he demonstrates
sustained talent, ability, and initiative in the accomplish-
ment of his duties. _

The hard work and patience of these theater-loving
students has paid OH in the continuous high quality and
professional calibre of Pitt Player productions.

With the aid of adviser Al Payne, the YMCA started the year
oﬂ” with a Leadership recognition program and Freshman smoker
at the Stephen Foster, where various Y projects were displayed.
Before that, however, the Freshmen had spent a weekend at Camp
Kon-O—Kwee, which is sponsored annually by the Y.

Religion-in-Life, one of the most stirring and worthwhile
of all Pitt projects, took place in March, and featured religious
and cultural leaders from all parts of the country speaking to the
student body in various formal groups°and informal discussions.

Regular Y events continued on throughout the year. Chapel
services were held every VVednesday, with all students invited to
attend. Lunches and the Great Books Conferences on Mondays
were also enjoyed by all members. In addition to all other activities,
the fellows all contributed to the management of the “Y News”
under the editor, Elmer Shuster.

The members of the YMCA found time to continue an annual
sports program, too. All IM sports were played, but most outstand-
ing was the soccer tournament, in which the Y won the Pitt
championship.

Founded at Pitt in 1910, the Young Women’s Christian Asso-
ciation has always been noted for its three-fold aid to members in
providing fun, personal development and spiritual guidance. This
year was no exception. Headed by Martha Jane Dixon, just back
from a 10-week seminar in Government Action in Washington,
D.C., the YVV approached 1952 with an unrestrained enthusiasm.

The Commission of Christian Faith and Heritage, in conjunc-
tion with the YMCA, gave Pitt the invaluable Religion-in-Life
Week. The second commission, planned the beautiful Caritas
ceremony, YW’s welcome to the freshman women at Pitt. Such
institutions as the Juvenile Detention Home, the Children's Hos-
pital and the Y-Teen groups of the city received aid from YVVCA’s
third commission, Social Responsibility.

The fourth commission, World Relatedness, sponsored a new
event this year, Pitt’s two day U.N. Under its direction, the Uni-
versity had its own United Nations meeting in the Stephen Foster
and discussed the question, “Should Red China be Admitted to
the United Nations?” A real Security Council was simulated and
rousing debates filled the room. Following the debates, an Inter-
national Dinner taught the students something of the culture of
the world’s' nations.

Pitt students think simultaneously of the E & M’ers
and their famous jalopy seen at so many football games.

In reality, the Engineering and Mining Cabinet is an
important and serious activity on campus. Every fall, each
seminar at the University of Pittsburgh, plus the freshman
and sophomore class, send two members to form the
cabinet. This brings a sort of student congress to those
students who spend so much of their time on the hill. All
seminar members are grateful to the past E 81 M cabinets
for helping to install many conveniences for them. The
candy and coke machines, the well-furnished lounge, and
other “extras” provide special conveniences for the stu-
dents.

On their social agenda, the members of the Associa-
tion held a Freshman Smoker, featuring interesting ex-
hibits. Picnics, bowling parties, and the beautiful E & M
Cinderella Ball, were main events in the active social life
of the E & M’ers.

Through good times and hard work, the E & M Associ-
ation “engineered” another successful year, upholding its
purposes of promoting fellowship among its members,
closer relations between engineering students and the prac-
ticing ﬁeld, and the promotion of an active social life for
its members.

On March 8, 1951, the American Institute ofChemical
Engineers’ student membership section celebrated its
first birthday. Pitt's student chapter, in spite of its rather
short time on campus, upheld the purposes of A.I.Ch.E.-
that of furthering the professional organization and of
promoting interest in the chemical engineering field.

A highlight of A.I.Ch.E.’s program this year was the
presentation of an award to the outstanding sophomore
in chemical engineering. Charles Frew won the honor of

Chemical Engineers in the Commons Room.

being the Institute’s annual award winner.

Key aids in the Seminar’s program were the use of
visual education and of professional speakers. Dr. H. C.
Carlson of the University faculty and Mr. W. M. Gersen
of E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company Inc., were the
main speakers. Plant trips to the Schenley Distillery and
to the Duquesne Brewery plus ﬁlms pertinent to the
chemical engineering profession rounded out this year’s
program. Also stimulating was the National Institutes’
magazine, “Chemical Engineering Progress.”

From its start under the supervision of Drs. Heiss
and Coull last year, the A.I.Ch.E. chapter at Pitt pro-
gressed rapidly. A.I.Ch.E. achieved its goals of keeping
chemical engineering students up on the movements in
their ﬁeld and of orienting the student chapter into Pitt
life.

The Seminar of Industrial Engineering celebrates its
birthday simultaneously with the School of Industrial
Engineering. Both date back to the inception of industrial
engineering at Pitt. Actually, the Seminar is a combina-
tion of two organizat-ions—the Mechanical Engineers and
the Institute of Industrial Engineers. Merged as such, the
organization has two purposes, to keep the members up
on the advancements in the engineering ﬁeld, and to help
the students get the feel of industry. This is achieved
through the use, not only of textbooks, but also through

using visual education.

Enrollment in the Industrial Seminar is mandatory,
with the meetings held once each week. Lectures, movies
and professional speakers round out the Seminar’s work
program.

On their social agenda, the members of the Industrial
Seminar attend numerous smokers where everything
from industry to “who will win the next football game?”
is discussed. In the spring, senior Seminar members turn
out in full force for the Senior Banquet. This is followed,
later in the month, by a picnic sponsored annually by the
association for the members and their dates. Topping the
social year is the Cinderella Ball, whose sponsorship falls
on the Industrial Seminar as well as the Engineering and
Mine Association.

The Petroleum Seminar at Pitt is a credited course
inaugurated by the Petroleum department to promote
interest in the industry. This year the seminar includes
sophomores, juniors and seniors in a combined student
body which meets every week either for a department or
joint seminar. The students receive a half-credit if a pass-
ing grade is acquired.

Main speaker this year was Mr. Richard, researcher,
of the People’s Natural Gas Company. Working closely
with allied ﬁelds, the petroleum seminar members at-
tended the sixth annual meeting of The American Insti-
tute of Mining and Metallurgical Engineers, meetings of
the Society of Geologists and Geophysicists, and an open
house given by the Gulf Research Laboratories.

In addition to regular seminar sessions, the members
attended A.I.M.E. meetings, for this year the petroleum
seminar merged with the mining and metalurgical groups.

Orienting itself into life at Pitt, the petroleum sem-
inar, in addition to its sessions, had an active intramural
sports program with football, basketball and softball
teams represented.

The Seminar closed the school year with a picnic in
the spring. Its last meeting featured Dr. Elmer, head of
the sociology department at Pitt, who spoke to the group
on “Social Problems in Industrial Activities."

A.I.C.E. Seminar

Adv. A. C. Ackenheil

The Civil Engineering Seminar at Pitt does not stick
to the theory of all work and no relaxation. Aside from the
regular curriculum, the members of A.I.C.E. sponsor
picnics for association members and their dates, plus
numerous parties. These social events help the Seminar
members become well-acquainted with each other, making
for a spirit of comradeship among these future civil engi—
neers.

Every Thursday ﬁnds A.I.C.E. members attending
the weekly meetings. Here, a member can hear questions
and discuss problems pertinent to the ﬁeld of civil engi-
neering. To answer those questions and to aid in solving
problems, are leading men in the civil engineering ﬁeld.
At the various ﬁeld trips held during the school year,
Seminar members had the opportunity to actually
observe civil engineers at work.

The American Institute of" Civil Engineering Seminar
at Pitt is not only important in subject matter, but inter-
esting and fun, too, in its active social calendar. Through
its closely integrated program of study and relaxation, the
engineers achieve both an adequate scholastic background,
and a strong spirit of fellowship that are excellent prepara-
tions for their future careers.

Rather crowded, isn’t it?

Way back in 1915, ﬁve seniors, representing the en-
tire senior class of the School of Electrical Engineering
at Pitt, attended the A.I.E.E.’s ﬁrst Seminar meeting. The
association has steadily grown into one of the most ac-
tive of its kind at the University of Pittsburgh. Now the
student chapter has one-hunderecl sixty members who
are juniors and seniors. The interest has developed because
of the programs held by the Seminar and because of its

. purpose. The chapter’s goals are to encourage young elec-
trical engineers, to keep them in close contact with the
practicing ﬁeld, and to keep them abreast of the latest
developments and happenings in the field.

Because the Seminar has much to offer the student, all
those enrolled in the School ofElectrical Engineering main-
tain a membership in the student chapter. The members
attend weekly meetings, being granted one—half credit
toward graduation. At these meetings, lectures, movies,
and professional speakers are featured.

Continuing a custom begun on April 24, 199.1, Senior
members of A.I.E.E. hold their annual banquet at the
Fort Pitt Hotel.

Well now, a short circuit.

At least one engineer can laugh about his homework.

The Pitt News

Looks like they're all set to go.

 

How do you rate a picture all by yourself?

260

 

Just as the life of a great city is mirrored in its news-
papers so is the world of the University reflected on the
pages of The Pitt News. Seven—time winner of the coveted
Associated Collegiate Press All-American Award, the
News hit the halls at 11:30 every VVednesday and Friday.
Circulation ﬁgures show that over 7000 students and
alumni turned to The Pitt News for the latest news of
Pitt.

VVith an eye cocked for the signiﬁcant and the lively,
a veteran staff of editors and reporters moved onto the
campus early in September to put out the registration
week edition. Big story in that issue was enrollment; it
dropped. From there on in, the editorial staff spent every
Monday night and Wednesday night pounding on ancient
typewriters in 825 CL. More than a few News staffers
watched the sun come up from the eighth ﬂoor. On Tues-
days and Thursdays, the Copy Desk staﬂ’ under John
Kulamer trolleyed into the printers in Pittsburgh, to put
the News to bed.

1951-52 was a lively year for the News. First issue to
involve disagreement between the News and its readers
grew out of a column by Sports Editor Don Murdock who
hinted that a student train to the Michigan game might

fail. Student Congress charged him and the News with
“degrading” school spirit. The failure of the train led to
more disagreement between the News and Congress. Inter-
fraternity Council took issue with a column on the frat
system and answered it with a mimeograph letter, which
lead to a spate of mimeographing by other groups. One
student was so unhappy about the News that he asked
Congress to support a rival newspaper.

Editorially the News attacked the cafeteria food
prices, the policy of closing the University on Sundays, the
Loyalty Oath and other issues. A campaign against dis-
crimination by columnist, Gene VVeinstein led to _the for-
mation of a Student Congress‘ Committee. to investigate
the problem. In backing the Blood Drive and the Pitt
Chest campaign the News aided materially in the success
of these projects.

A lively and varied editorial page built up by a large
following for columnists Lois Foight, Ed Jensen, John
Kulamer, Bob Thomas and Dave VVinter. They wrote
on suchtopics as “birth control, European education,
Communism and the Tuck Shop.”

In an effort to serve its readers better the News in-
troduced a regular review of the local legitimate theaters
by Dick Snyder. A series of articles on the different campus
schools by Clark Sutton drew high praise. The regular
feature, the Pitt Poll, by Isabelle Lubovsky and Dee Mor-
gret helped determine the importance of current events. A
special series of articles by Elinore Stone showed the stu-
dent body the. working of top organizations on campus.
Boris Weinstein became familiar to readers through his
coverage of varsity sports.

The Panther

The Panther is Pitt’s All-American entry in an old
college tradition——the humor magazine. Charting a rocky
course between oﬂicial disapprobation and student apathy,
the Panther stays in the black, amuses many, and won
highest honors in the Associated Collegiate Press Contests.

Not too many schools still have magazines. Some of
them are jokebooks, some picture magazines, some literary
museums. The Panﬂzer after years of experiment seems to
have found a formula which pleases, at least, the students.

Meeting the demand for campus stories, Editor Paul
Schwarz assigned the Panther’: little “hirthquake,” Doris
Hirth, as Campus Editor to feed a regular line of features
and pictures on campus life.

The Panther is a humor magazine by courtesy of
Chuck Vaughn, Humor Editor. Chuck’s staff is liberally
supplied with scissors and paste, can clip another magazine
dry in 9 seconds ﬂat. Of course, Pitt’s own jokers and

cartoonists do their share, too. but the “Campus Candids”
clips with Pitt captions rate one of the prime attractions
to make Circulation Manager C. F. Purdy's job a little
easier.

Purdy is a member of Business Manager Don Horo-
witz’s staPf. Horowitz is a horrible example of one year’s
editor becoming next year’s business manager. His staff has
to keep the magazine in the black, because the Panther
gets no University appropriation. Don (no longer “Dirty
Don”) keeps Advertising Manager Dick Bergad selling
ads, and more important, collecting from the advertisers.

Scrutinizing the ﬁgures and trying to keep books for
the madcap staff is George Frazier, comptroller. George’s
hair is turning_grey in the service. His ﬁgures show that
circulation pays the way for Pant/zer punning.

Circulation is aided by the continuous sorority sales
contest. Most Pitt sororities assign girls to sell Pant/zen,
and the one selling most wins a nice cup for the trophy
room. This year sales hit a new high for the magazine.
Partly because of Purdy’s girls, partly because the P472!/167
had what the students seemed to want.

Fiction by Schwarz and Dick Snyder, art by Sparky
Pricer, pictures under the direction of John Bush, humor
by Vaughn and Eddie Stone all laid out by Jim Marks,

Jack Greenberg and Ruth Stein—proved the right recipe

to pep up Pittites and keep the Panther roaring.

I Skyscraper Engineer

264

According to this slide rule-

And this wasn't only posed, they have a deadline to meet.

The newest publication at Pitt is the S/ryreraper
Engineer. Welcomed into the journalistic fold last April,
this magazine is now in full production on the upper cam-
pus. A technical magazine for engineering students and
alumni, it has the high purpose of instilling interest in
engineering research. The originators hope that it will
also help spread knowledge of Pitt’s engineering activities
and information on the latest scientiﬁc feats in industry.

Published four times a year, circulation has been
on a steady increase—there are zoo alumni on the mailing
list! Advertising is handled by the national advertising
agency, Littell—Murray-Barhill, Inc. of New York and
revenue from this also insures success for the student pub-
lishers.

Skyscraper Engineer contains many interesting articles
directed toward the engineer. In cooperation with VVesting-
house, a series of new technical developments were in-
cluded in its four issues. Another feature was “Pitt Stu-
dents in Industry.” In these articles, Pitt students’ sum-
mer experiences in their chosen ﬁelds were related and ex-
plained. Incorporated into each publication has been 3.
humor page to give a little of the lighter side to an other-
wise scientiﬁc book.

With the success received in 1952, Skyscraper Engi-
neer is looking toward a permanent place in Pitt’s publi-
cations row.

If someone were to ask you, “what is the" Pitt Cup-
sule?", don't make the mistake that a little freshman girl
made during registration week—she answered the ques-
tion in this way. “The Pitt Capsule is a pill to keep you
awake so that you’ll make good grades on tests."

No, the Pitt Capsule is not a “pill.” It is the monthly
publication of the Pitt student branch of the American
Pharmaceutical Association at the School of Pharmacy.
The publication reports professional news as well as school

, life and activities.

Highlights of the Pitt Capsule are its features. In
the “Greeks' Corner," fraternity and sorority life at the
Pharmacy school are featured. To help the pharmacy
student in his work at school, the Capsule prints excerpts
from the leading current pharmaceutical magazines. Also
in this “aid to the student” vein, is the “Question Box.”
Here, can be found published questions and answers to any
problems in the pharmacy line.

The Pitt Cupsule deals not only with those students
currently enrolled in the Pitt School of Pharmacy. It ex-
tends to its graduates—-the “Alumni Column” records the
activities of former graduates of the school.

Do you mean to say you have time to study?

The Owl

Hoot! Hoot! VVhat is the OWL? The OWL is the oﬂicial
University of Pittsburgh student yearbook. To record the
life at Pitt from September to June is the purpose of the
yearbook and this is accomplished by the use of photo-
graphs which when used as a record-, tell a lasting story.
Thus the 1952 OWL is a picture story of the students at
Pitt, their problems and their adjustments, their activities
and their long hours, and the thrill and relief of ﬁnally
graduating.

One year ago when Leizer Balk was re-appointed Edi-
tor and Marvin Jacobson was appointed Business Man-
ager, the OWL had completed one of its most successful
years. The OWL came out on time for the first time in
four years. Again this year the 1952 OWL set a precedent
by coming out again on time. Yes, two years in a row.
Thanks to a small staff of students coming from all parts
of the university, working for the entire student body
without financial reward, this event came about.

During the summer of 1951, the Editor and Business
Manager began to lay plans for the 1952 edition. The
theme, overall design, cover design, entire book layout, and
theme styles were set up by the Editor, Leizer Balk and
the staff positions were decided upon. The entire circula-
tion, , advertising and publicity campaigns were planned
by the Business Manager Marvin Jacobson, together with
his Associate Business Manager Harry Scharf.

As soon as school started, the business staff swung into
operation. Howard Megehan under the direct supervision
ofHarry Scharf took care of the circulation problems. Karl
Meyers, Advertising Manager began the long campaign
for advertisements from the Pittsburgh business ﬁrms. The
OWL and its sales value were kept in the students’ eye by
Bob Barner, Publicity Manager, thru use of the Pitt Néwx,
direct mail pieces and publicity stunts.

Meanwhile the Editor handed down the staff assign-
ments and work began on the editorial side. The Board of
Editors was divided into ﬁve, Managing, Classes, Literary,
Oﬂice and Photo editors. Peggy Meyers, Managing Editor,
had the headaches of the large Activities Division. How-
ever she was ably assisted by Gloria Heneghan and Marion
Isaac who worked hard and late on the Fraternity and
Sorority Sections. Also working a long ten-hour day were
Danny Berger and Frank McWright, who had the re-
sponsibility of gathering the Organizations Section. The
Student Government, Fine Arts, and Publications were
again assembled in good fashion, by Mary Ann Babinsky.
For the first time in OWL history a girl, Joan Garber, who
performed better than many a male, was named Sports
Editor. All the group pictures for these sections were
scheduled with Joan Stigers, Office Editor.

This is our Business Staff ? ?

 

When all the pictures, copy, and identiﬁcation were
ﬁnished, all the section staffs really went to work. Joan
Kramer, Audrey Recht, Helen Franklin, Polly Leather-
man, Astrid Breivold, Dalia Katz, Nancy Rupp and Nancy
Baker worked hard assisting their editors.

Barbara Millen, Assistant to the Editor, was the
handy girl of the office as she worked and worked on all the
special sections. Doris Secor produced some very good
art work, plus designing the Sweetheart Section.

Working until the early hours of the morning, this
small staff plodded on. Finally through patience and lots
of hard work, the 1959. OWL went to press. Yes, the 1952
OWL again came out on time, Bigger, Better than before,
just as promised in our advertisements.

All the informal pictures, and there were many, were
taken by Irv Greenberg, and his small hard-working staff,
Jack Caldwell, Chuck Seaton, Bob Pasekoff, and George
Stokes.

All the copy questionnaires that were gathered by the
section staffs were handed to Anne Gussin, who did a
wonderfuljob as Literary Editor. Mary McFarland, Carol
Smith, Bea Paul and Helene Morrow all contributed some
of the writing.

The Classes Section began to work under Bob Fulton,
as soon as the portrait photographer left. After ﬁling and
drawing the layouts, the pictures arrived, and the pasting
up began. After the Christmas vacation, the classes staff
comprised of Phyllis Kephart, Dottie Hudson, Dolly
Kahn, and Fred Hall worked very tediously on this section.

Pitt Players

Pitt Players, student dramatics group at the Univer-
sity goes on the theme of “the play’s the thing”—the play
and a lot of hard work plus talent. Competing with Car-
negie Tech’s drama department, Pitt Players, as an extra-
curricular activity, has as its purpose the production of
good theatre and the provision of an organization which
will give its members experience in the techniques of
theatre art.

Eligibility rules for membership in Pitt Players are
that the student must be a full—time undergraduate and
must have satisfactory participation in two ﬁelds. Field
A includes acting, business, publicity, make-up and sound.
In Field B, there are scenery, costumes, lights, stage and
property. To retain active membership, a Player must be
active in at least two productions during the school year.

Plays this fall included 7anuar_y Thaw and Oedipus
Rex. The Heiress and Our Tawn were produced in the spring.
After the opening night of each show, Pitt Players holds
a reception featuring a drama skit.

Perhaps the most “awaited for time” in the dramatics
group is the June banquet where new members are re-
ceived into Players and old members receive keys for out-
standing participation, proving once again, that for Pitt
Players, “the play’s the thing."

territory every Sunday on television. Just turn on the
set on Sundays at 2:00; “Music and Meditation” featuring
our Choir will appear before your eyes. This new addition
to the members’ busy schedule began in January, 1951,
when WDTV requested their music for a religious part
of the day’s program. Now a regular feature, the presenta-
tion has received much favorable comment.

Heinz Chapel Choir

But the TV_show is just a small part of the Heinz
Chapel Choir’s agenda. In September the choir met for a
week on Lake Erie where they acquired a working knowl-
edge of the year’s music. Between practices, the members
took full advantage of the time and enjoyed swimming,
beach parties, dances and generally got acquainted. Re-
hearsals every day at 4:30 on the thirty-ﬁrst ﬂoor con-
tinued from September ’til June, where the main core of
Choir’s work took place. A banquet at the Faculty Club in
December found the choir enjoying each other in a social
relationship. The annual Spring tour climaxed their series
of concerts when the group boarded buses and headed for
Ohio and Indiana.

To belong to the Choir is to gain ﬁfty close friends.
Because they work together so closely for a common pur-
pose, the choir has long been noted for its deep, lasting
friendships. A strong Alumni Choir is evidence of this.
T. M. “Pop” Finney, the choir’s director, hasjokingly been
referred to as Cupid, because so many marriages have
resulted from choir friendships. One of the nicest traditions
of this group is to sing at these weddings.

At a picnic at “Pop’s” farm in the Ligonier Valley,
the choir assembled for the last time in the 1951-52 season.
Volleyball, swimming and baseball ﬁlled the afternoon
hours. But as the sun was setting, the members drew
together and sang ’til they could sing no more. As their
voices echoed through the mountains, Dr. Finney again
could say “We have made music.”

Hard at Work!

The Varsity Marching

Presenting the University of Pittsburgh Varsity Marching Band: with these words
and reverberating drum beat, a small blue block followed by four blue lines‘ surges"
forth from the south end of the stadium. Instruments gleaming and legs pumping in
piston—like motion, the University of Pittsburgh band sweeps onto the ﬁeld at 180-
plus steps a minute to perform their ipre-game formations each season during the foot;
ball season. i ‘

At halfltime the crowd watches in amazement as the band unceasingly “explodes”
from one formation into another. From the maze of blue, gold and white, an animated
trombone appears only to disappear and be replaced by a giganticsaxaphone. As .the
band plays and sings, it forms a surrey or a covered wagon with moving wheels.:T_hey
dance to the Pennsylvania Polka. Most important, though, it the fact that they are
doing what they have practiced so hard to do and that is entertaining the ‘public. When
it is all over the marching musicians receive their only award‘ for their work‘—'—the‘ cheers
and applause from the people in the stands. » '  ti '

This was a good season for the Varsity Marching
Band. They made some old formations and some new for-
mations and most important continued to please the
crowd at every game.

The band enjoyed its trip to Michigan State as much
as the people of MSC enjoyed watching and listening to
them. Comments and letters, all praising the band, poured
in long after the band returned to its Vertical campus.

Here are some pictorial remembrances of ‘the band
from the past season. In the upper left is the traditional
keystone used to salute our home state during the Notre
Dame half—time. For this show the band danced, sang and
pranced in imitation of the horses drawing the old-fash-
ioned surreys. The middle picture on the left is the line-up
of the ten men who are ﬁrst down the field on the pre-game
enti-ance—the trombone section.

Next to them on the right is a shot of the baritone
section that adds a great deal of depth to the tonal qualty

of the band.
At the bottom of the page are the men who are the

ﬁrst to burst onto the football field at every game, the men
who set and maintain the 180 plus tempo for which the
VMB is famous—the drum section.

  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

The “Gold” picture at the top of the page was snapped
at the ﬁnal home game of the season. It was the wind-up
of a routine that portrayed America’s pioneer days. The
word “gold” represented one of the reasons for the west-
ward movement and they marched into the formation
playing “California, Here I Come.”

The band opened the season with a salute to all the
college and high school musicians taking part in football
bands across the country. Two of the local high school
bands were on hand to watch the show, part of which was
this formation of a sousaphone in which the band played
“Them Basses.”

The band had originally planned its story of pioneer
days for the West Virginia game, but inclement weather
kept them from practicing their formations. At half—time,
with the field a veritable sea of mud and only 9,000 hardy
souls in the stands, the band battled the elements to en-
tertain the ‘crowd’ with a musical resume of the show they
had planned.

Pitt Singers

Here at Pitt, where there are so many people who
enjoy singing, there is a deﬁnite need for choral groups. To
help fulﬁll this need and to find vocal talent in the Uni-
versity is the task which the Pitt Singers have chosen. The
Pitt Singers is the youngest group in the school. Organized
in 1946, the group is open to any undergraduate carrying
twelve credits or more who can qualify in tryouts held
twice a year.

Concerts were among the most important events in
the schedule of the Pitt Singers, most of these falling in the
spring term. At the Choral Jubilee the Singers gave a
performance, along with the other musical organizations
at Pitt. This mixed group also gave its own concert at
Carnegie Music Hall in the spring, and followed it up with
a concert tour which covered some of the neighboring
cities. Programs for social events in the Commons Room
and a few community parties were also included this year.
To give the proper climax to their busy season, the Pitt
Singers held their annual banquet. It is at this aﬂair that
the keys are awarded to those singers who have been most
active in the organization during the year.

Under the direction of David G. Weiss, the group
sings a great variety of musical selections, ranging from
modern musical bits to the semi—classical works.

“Without a song the day will never end”——this is one
worry Men's Glee Club did not have this past year. David
G. VVeiss, director, and the members of Men’s Glee Club
worked on the theme of "all I want is having you and
Music, Music, Music.” And music is what the entire Pitt
student body got. Remember the ﬁreplace and Commons
Room Singing at Christmas time?

Men’s Glee Club’s reputation as a top singing group
was not limited to only the Pitt campus. In February,
during the semester vacation, the boys toured Northern
Pennsylvania and New York. March found them singing
in Eastern Pennsylvania and New Jersey.

The choral group continued its tradition of entertain-
ing at the Chancellor’s Reception in the fall. They finished
the year with the annual concert and the banquet—top
feature at this event was the presentation of keys to
worthy Glee Club members.

Adding sparkle to Men's Glee Club this year was the
Varsity Quartet, its prize baritone, Paul Anderson, and
accompanist Robert Reese.

From the first weeks of competitive tryouts to the
end of the school year, Men’s Glee Club, the oldest activity
on campus, upheld their motto of “Music, Music, Music.”

Women’s Choral

A trip to Eric for a concert at the Veterans’ Hospital
there was the highlight of VVomen's Choral this year.
And since this trip to a vets’ hospital was such a success,
the group, under the direction of Mr. Colin Stern, enter-
tained another hospital right at home, the Aspinwall
Veterans’ Hospital. Once again the program was fun for
the men and for the choral group.

The schedule for the year also included the Choral
Jubilee, which is an annual affair for all the singing organ-
izations on campus. Another event was singing for the
Brookline Presbyterian Church.

People at Pitt had an opportunity to enjoy the ﬁne
singing at Christmas when the choral added much to the
holiday spirit at Pitt by caroling in the Commons Room.
At the Easter season, too, the women sang in Heinz Chapel
for the special Easter service.

For the university's traditional Beaux Arts program,
Women’s Choral cooperated with the other singing and
speech groups and presented selections from musical com-
edies.

Women who are interested in speech training have an
opportunity for many kinds of expression through the
Women’s Speech Association. This group plans a varied
program of speech activities, including debate, oral read-
ing, radio discussion groups, and methods of parliamentary
procedure.

Outstanding on this year's agenda was the Beaux
Arts program, sponsored by Women's Speech and W0-
men’s Choral. Planned as an event to welcorfle Freshman
women, this year's program was attended by a large, all-
campus audience, more than two hundred and ﬁfty stu-
dents and faculty members, who enthusiastically received
the presentations of American art, music, literature and
dancing. The Fine Arts Department provided American
paintings and photographs for display during the program.

Debates with the other city colleges and visiting
teams were an important part of the Women's Speech
activities, too. Highlight of these debates was the one
with Temple University in the state tourney.

The Freshman speech guild came under the guidance
of the Association, also. The Freshman women were in-
cluded in the radio discussion of WPGH and prepared oral
readings for the Penn State Reading Festival in the spring.
Members of the parent organization believe that by intro-
ducing these Freshmen to an active and interesting speech
program, the success of their Association will continue
into the future.

Men’s Debatel .

The year 1951-52 found the Men’s Debate Association
of the University of Pittsburgh with avery heavy schedule.
Starting early in October, Pitt sent teams to Oxford Uni-
versity and Western Reserve, where they debated before
fourteen high schools in Cleveland and Pittsburgh. The
Pitt Cross—Examination Tournament was held in Decem-
ber. At this tournament, sponsored by Pitt, college de-
baters from all over the country departed from the usual
train of debating and added a little variety to the normal
procedure. Also in December was the High School Tourna-
ment Clinic, where Men’s Debate illustrated to high school
groups how debating should be done.

The Pennsylvania State Debaters Convention was in
March. The organization was particularly proud that its
president, Bob Gardner, was the ﬁrst Pittpresident to
reign at this convention in the Association’s seventeen-
year history. The State Convention was quickly followed
by a Brooklyn Tourney, a Northwestern Tourney, and
ﬁnally the Grand National Tournament in Fredricksburg,
Virginia. At the Grand Convention, top debaters from Cali-
fornia to Maine vied for the honored position of “Best
Debating Team” in the United States. ‘“

Holding ﬁrm to the policy of cooperation rather than
competition among sororities, the Panhellenic Association
carried out another successful year. Council, the executive
body of Panhellenic Association is composed of two rep-
resentatives from each of the sixteen sororities on campus.
This group, the over-all governing body of sororities,strives
to increase each group’s appreciation of the others and
helps the Greek women function as an integral part of the
extra-curricular program at Pitt.

The first event sponsored by Council was the Panhel
Reception for Freshmen in the Commons Room. With a
chorus of 48 voices, this party was received very favorably
by the freshmen and Panhel was encouraged to continue
the custom. Anxious to put into practicality its motto of
“cooperation,” Council urged intersorority teas and parties
throughout the school year.

During the second semester, many affairs were held.
The formal Ball, for all sorority women, was held at the
VVilliam Penn in March. April found this organization
busy with its annual VVork Shop, Panhel—IF Sing, and a
new project on Pitt’s campus—Greek Week.

Alpha Delta Pi

At the Alpha Delta Pi traditional Black and White
formal on December 20, the Penn—Shady ballroom was
decorated in the ADPi colors of light blue and white. As
the sisters sang “Sweetheart of ADPi,” the memories of
the past semester, and thoughts for the coming season
were in the minds of all.

The Alpha Iotas, this past year as always, contributed
to the Alpha Delta Pi 1851 Memorial Fellowship Fund,
commemorating the founding date of the national group.
Grants exceeding $160,000 are made to worthy students,
members or non—members, in America and Canada, who
wish to continue their graduate studies in this country or
abroad, particularly in the ﬁelds of child welfare and nurs-
ing. It is through projects such as this that Alpha Delta
Pi progresses continually.

The year 1952 saw Pitt chapter’s accomplishments
ﬂourish. School activities featured Lorraine Gottschall as
chairman of the 12th ﬂoor guild, Alice Hughes and Oma
Thompson as Cwens, Edith Hughes as publicity chair-
man of the class of 1953, and Ann Burns and Elsie Locher
prominent in Pitt Players—all examples of the ADPi
spirit of achievement.

Alpha Epsilon Phi

A little ﬂaxen—haired Dutch boy is the adopted ward
of Nu Chapter of Alpha Epsilon Phi. Under the Foster
Parents’ Plan, the girls send food and clothing to little
Jonas Huisman in exchange for letters and pictures about
the nine—year-old boy. The A.E. Phi’s are very proud of
Jonas and are hoping that at some future date they can
bring him over to the United States where he might some
day be a student at Pitt.

Busy ‘on the campus, the A.E. Phi’s claim Anne
Gussin and Audrey Recht as members of Mortar Board.
Anne Gussin also belongs to Senior Court, Pi Delta Epsi-
lon, and Quo Vadis. A. E. Phis also claim members in
Alpha Beta Gamma, Quax, the John Marshall Pre—Law
Fraternity, the Panther, Owl, Pitt News, Pitt Players, and
Heinz Chapel Choir.

On the social side, the A.E. Phi’s held their annual
barn dance in North Park in November, and had a dance
in February. Doris Hart was selected sweetheart of Phi
Epsilon Pi, and Elayne Recht was Pi Lambda Phi’s sweet-
heart. The year ended with the annual spring formal hon-
oring the graduating seniors.

This year, in the spring, Chi Omega awarded the out-

Service Award. Along with this, the Chi O’s have main-
tained their high position both on and oﬂ” the Pitt campus.
At the University, ﬁve Chi O’s were senior mentors, Marie
Homisak was vice president of W.S.G.A. and a member of
Senior Court, and Adele Marraccini was busy with the
correspondence of W.S.G.A. In Student Congress, Pat
Clohessy was recording secretary, Maggie Dowling, cor-
responding secretary, and Ann Curran, a student-at-large.

But the Chi O’s also devote time to civic and social
activities. They sent baskets to the needy on the holidays,
and had their annual Christmas party for the orphans.
Socially, the Chi O’s had a get—together with the Delta
Zetas, and held two affairs for their mothers. The climax
to the year was a spring formal at Churchill Valley Country
Club, which gave the ﬁnishing touch to a year the Chapter
could look back on with pride.

From 1888, at Boston University, to 1952, at 95
American colleges, the sisterhood of Delta Delta Delta has
grown and ﬂourished. Pitt’s chapter, started in 1916, en-
deavors to maintain the high standards set up by the
earliest groups.

During the past school year, the Tri-Delta’s have
accomplished much in the way of sorority interests and
scholastic activities. To start off the social season, the
girls had their usual pledge banquets at the house. Open
house for Homecoming was a great success, and the Christ-
mas and spring formals were looked forward to and re-
membered eagerly. On Charter Day, Delta Delta Delta
alumnae were entertained, and birthday gifts were given
to the house. The Founder's Day banquet at the University
Club featured entertainment by the Tech and Pitt chap-
ters.

Many Delta Delta Delta sisters participated in ac-
tivities in 1951-52. Mortar Board listed as members Mar-
jorie Grubbs and Joanne Sheehan, who also served as
secretary. Cwens were Loretta Bedont, Shirley Funk, and
Nancy Storer, and Rosemarie Feil held the chairmanship
of the Traditions Committee. Jane Elliott served as secre-
tary of the Customs Committee.

Delta Zeta

The war orphans of Northern Greece beneﬁted once
again this past year from the philanthropic projects of the
Delta Zeta sorority. The chapters throughout the country
worked hard to make their campaign to take care of the
needy children a success.

The Omicron chapter here received a national honor
by having a sister, Claire Brackmann, awarded for her
scholarship and activities to the Florence Hood Honor
Court, an honor given to only three girls throughout the
year of the DZ chapterhood.

VVith the words of “Delta Zeta Lamps Are Burning,”
and other anthems to lead them, Omicron spent a busy
year, full of service to school and sisterhood. Many Pitt
activities included DZ's, such as Cwen and President of
the class of 1954, Pat Ritz; Customs Committee chairman,
Donna Parks; Vocational Guidance chairman, Betty
Pickering; Mortar Board and Quo Vadis member and
Senior mentor, Claire Brackmann; class of 1954 treasurer,
Nancy Creasy; and Owl staffers, Gloria Heneghan, Agnes
Bruun, Marian Isaac, and Joan Stigers.

The colors of old rose and vieux green, along with the
Killarney Rose, were the decorations at the Delta Zeta
social gatherings. The open house in honor of the pledges,
the dessert party at the house before the Pan-Hel Ball,
and the Christmas party for orphans were part of the
crowded DZ calendar.

Kappa Alpha Theta

The next stop for the Kappa Alpha Theta’s is Sun
Valley, Idaho, and another national convention. Lots of
actives and alums from Pitt have planned to go to Sun
Valley and hope to come home with many ideas for the
next year.

But they are taking ideas with them, too, and more
important, they’ll take all the enthusiasm from this past
year, enthusiasm that grows just from working together.

 

Whether it was cooking dinners together each Monday, or P1'e5- MMY McFarland
planning a “Whale of a Homecoming,” preparing the sur— V' Pres’ Janet O’H3gan
prise party for the alums or decorating for the Christmas S39 Paula Kaflﬁ
formal at the house, the girls had a wonderful time. Their Trea5- D0YiS MCCUHC

Christmas party for orphans with the Phi Gam’s, and
their caroling in Oakland gave all the Theta’s a real
Christmas feeling. Tea dances, house parties, and ﬁnally
the spring dinner dance as a farewell to the seniors made
the year worth remembering.
In school activities Theta’s were proud this year of
their Chief Justice of Senior Court, their senior mentors,
Mortar Boards, Cwens, Owl workers, and Student Con-
gress committee members.

Kappa Kappa Gamma

VVhen former members of Kappa Kappa Gamma, in— #9
cluding such well-known personalities as Frances Parkin-
son Keyes, Mrs. Alben Barkley, and Nancy Chalfee, look
back on their college days, their memories can be no fuller
than those of the Pitt chapter, Gamma Epsilon.

With plans to make 1951-52 one of their busiest sea-
sons, the Kappa’s of Pitt delved into all forms of school
activities early in the semester. Josephine Gallagher and PreS_ Marilyn Brey
Carol Hinds, in addition to their duties as president of V_ Pres_ Catherine Herron
Mortar Board and Panhellenic Council, respectively, also Rea Sec. Dorothy Hastings
Worked as Senior Mentors, along with Marilyn Brey and Twas. Roberta Shearer
Jean Bassler. No Pitt Player devotee will forget Joan
Lisotto’s sparkling lead in “January Thaw”; Joan worked
just as zealously as chairman of the Transfer committee. .
Beth McNeil and Roberta Shearer, as member of the Cus-
toms committee and treasurer of the W.A.A., set good
examples of workmanship, also.

The ﬂeur—de—lis, symbol of Kappa.sisterhood, pro-
vided a ﬁtting touch to the national project of supporting
the French province of Bas-Meudon, where the Dorothy
Canﬁeld Fisher Relief Fund, named after another famous

alumna, supports and educates needy children. Jean Campbell, Jo Gallagher, Carol Hinds’

A serenade in “Two Shades of Blue.”

This year marked the Centennial for Phi Mu, and on
March 4 at their Founders’ Day banquet, a ﬁne celebration
commemorated the day one hundred years ago when Phi
Mu was founded at Wesleyan College in Macon, Georgia.
Through this century of success, Phi Mu has chartered 68
chapters throughout the country. The Pitt chapter dates
back to 1921.

The girls proved that after 100 ‘years Phi Mu’s still
have the enthusiasm and ideals of the first Phi Mu’s. They
proudly list in the membership the president of the
Y.W.C.A., three Mortar Boards, four senior mentors,
clerk of senior court, and many more active girls.

Their social life was not omitted, though. A costume
party for Halloween at the Phi Mu apartment in the
Belleﬁeld Dwellings was the ﬁrst event. Tea dances with
a number of fraternities, bridge parties for their alumnae,
and a Christmas party for orphans were special highlights
of the year.

And, of course, their traditional formals at Christmas
season and in the spring were held this year, too. Both of
these formals, in honor of the seniors and the pledges, were
a great success, just as their century of organization has
been.

The Rheumatic Fever Fund once again this year re-
ceived the proceeds of the Phi Sig beneﬁt. The fund is the
national philanthropic project of the Phi Sigma Sigma
Sorority, and every year many little children are helped
because of the charity.

This year started off with a Founders’ Day celebra-
tion and a wonderful winter formal. Mothers’ and Fathers’
Day Dinners came around to add family fun to the group.
Tea dances with various fraternities and lots of parties
kept the girls busy socially all through the year until their
annual spring formal.

They were busy, too, working for Phi Sig. Rushing,
with all of the work of decorating and preparing skits,
took up everyone’s time. In the spring semester the singers
were hard at work getting ready for the Panhel Sing in
Greek VVeek. And soon it was Spring Festival time again.

Many of the girls were in school activities. Isabel
Lubovsky, Elinore Syna, Ruth Ann Isaacs and others held
positions as Senior Mentors, and guild chairmen, were
active in the customs committee, Cwens, and Mortar
Board.

Sigma Sigma Sigma

When the Tri Sig members returned to school this
year, they found a beautiful addition in their apartment—
a silver service set given to them by the Mothers’ Club.
Although their chapter is comparatively new at Pitt,
founded in April, 1949, Tri Sig is proud of its record. Last
year, they placed first both in the Float contest at Spring
Carnival and in Pam‘/zer sales.

Starting off the school year with a hayride at Pine
Valley, the Tri Sigs continued their social activities with a
Christmas party held before vacation, the Spring Formal
in April, and a picnic, closing the year.

A national organization, Sigma Sigma Sigma has
forty—eight chapters. Pitt’s chapter holds its meetings at
the sorority apartment on Fifth Avenue, where the fire-
place gab session is a “must”.

Tri Sig members hold many important positions on

‘campus. Among them are: Panther art editor, Ann Pricer;

Student Hostess and a member of Cwens, Janine Sprague;
Secretary of Panhellenic Association, Marion Post; Vice
President of Junior class, Anna Lou Alex; President of
Alpha Epsilon Delta and Sweetheart of Sigma Alpha Epsi-
lon, Mary Ann Babinsky; Vice President of Senior Class
and a member of Mortar Board, Josephine Mustari.

Theta Phi Alpha

Theta Phi Alpha held its annual V\'hite Rose Formal
in the spring this year at the University Club. The dance
brought to an end an active, happy year. All the girls,
particularly the seniors, were sorry to see it end. They re-
membered the house party for Halloween, which brought
everyone to the house in costume and the theater'party
when they had a chance to see the alums again.

All the holidays were fun, too—Thanksgiving Dinner
Party at one of the active’s homes; Caroling with the Phi
Kaps a few evenings before Christmas; the Valentine
house party with “hearts” for all.

Theta Phi Alpha was founded at Ann Arbor, Michi-
gan, in 1912 and has grown now to an active list of 27
chapters. The Pitt chapter, begun in 1922, has carried
out the traditions and ideals of its founders.

The members not only are active in their sorority life
but the girls participate in many school activities. Just a
few include Student Congress committee work, Pitt

Players, Nationality Room Hostessing, and the Newman
Club.

Zeta Tau Alpha

Ask a ZTA girl “what’s on the twelfth ﬂoor?” and
you’ll get the proud answer, “The Pearl Ried Memorial
Room.” Pearl Ried was one of the charter members of
the Pittsburgh Zeta Tau Alpha chapter. In her commem-
oration, all ZTA chapters contributed to make this con-
ference room the ﬁrst and only one of its kind at Pitt.

Zeta Tau Alpha also looks with pride at its alumni
chapter. Working in close union with it, ZTA sponsored
“A Night at the Pittsburgh Playhouse." That night found
the ZTA girls selling candy, the proﬁts going to the Cere-
bral Palsy Fund, key charity of the national chapter.

In keeping with its tradition for leaders in the com-
munity as well as in the school, Zeta Tau Alpha has to
its credit a well-known alumna, Joy Liken, who for the
past several years has been the winner of all women's
tennis championships in Western Pennsylvania.

At Pitt, the ZTA’s look with pride to their two Cwen
members, June Riddle and Edith Totzke, and to Nancy
Tear, president of W.S.G.A., who last year was awarded
the honor of a trip abroad as the worthiest nationality
room hostess.

When the Pitt chapter of Alpha Kappa Alpha enter-
tained the children at the Davis Home this year, it was
another good example of how the sorority endeavors and
achieves ﬁne accomplishments.

The past year has been a busy one indeed for the
AKA’S.In addition to their philanthropic duties,they also
managed to produce one of the most active social seasons
ever, a season during which the colors of salmon pink and
apple green stood for the mutual enjoyment of all the sis-
ters. A rustic party at the Music Center, a casual affair to
start OH the season, was followed soon after by the annual
Christmas dance, where the girls sang the “Ivy Leaf
Hymn,” written by Laura Cooper. Other get-togethers,
such as bowling parties, pajama parties, and the Sunday
morning church services and banquets led into the Found-
er’s Day Dinner and the Mother’s Day Tea.

Activities, too, saw many sisters bringing honor to
Alpha Kappa Alpha through outstanding service. Jessie
Goode, president of the Junior class, Eleanor Bowles,
member of Delta Delta Lambda, and Connie Swain and
Laura Cooper, members of Alpha Beta Gamma, are just
a few of the busy girls.

Delta Sigma Theta

An international chapter in the free state of Liberia
is the proud accomplishment of Delta Sigma Theta, na-
tional social sorority for Negro women. Since its founding
in 1913, the group has expanded to 12,000 members
in 183 chapters, with inter—racial as well as inter-
national aﬂiliations.

Mu, founded at Pitt in 1929, has provided a full sched-
ule of social affairs for its members. A Pigskin Punt after
the Notre Dame game, and a Sweetheart Ball at the Fort
Pitt Hotel where the selection of sorority sweetheart was
announced were the highlights of the fall season. A Candle-
light Soiree and the Founders’ Day luncheon rounded out
the first semester.

Spring brought with it two traditional events, the
Symposium which was held on Easter Sunday, and the
“Jabberwock,” held in conjunction with the three other
Pittsburgh chapters of Delta Sigma Theta. This event
helps replenish the sorority scholarship fund. The annual
formal brought the spring semester to a close.

Sigma Delta Tau

Sigma Delta Tau, the youngest sorority on Pitt’s
campus, was founded here in February, 1950. It has risen
rapidly to a place of prominence in both school and philan-
thropic affairs.

As proof of the SDT spirit of good accomplishment,
the Alpha Zeta chapter helped out in many charitable
causes. Notable among these were the hours spent reading
to the blind, entertaining at the Jewish Home for the Aged,
and giving parties for the children at the Jewish Baby
Home.

The girls had a full social calendar, too, including
dances, a hayride, an open house after the Ohio State
game, and the traditional spring formal.

SDT’s devoted a great deal of time to school activities,
also. Some of the particularly active members are Bernice
Sirota, who served as vice president of Cwens, Rosalyn
Brenner as activities chairman for the class of 1954, and
Gilda Krosney, a member of the executive board of Pan-
hellenic Council.

Besides looking forward to an even busier year to
come, the chapter is planning to devote more time to
working on their newly decorated and modernized apart-
ment.

Interfraternity

Council

Inter—Fraternity Council, the centralized representa-
tive governing body of all of Pitt’s fraternities, this year
participated wholeheartedly in campus projects and for-
warded many organization programs. _

In supporting University campaigns, IF gave en
masse to the Blood Drive, contributed to the drive for
Alpha Phi Omega’s panthers, and gave real backing to
Pitt’s participation in National Brotherhood VVeek. As
contribution to the betterment of Pittsburgh, IF last year
conducted a scrap paper drive and gave all the proceedings
to the Hill City project.

In a more social vein, the annual Inter-Fraternity Ball
was again held at the VVil]iam Penn Hotel. At that time,
IF celebrated the one hundred and sixty—ﬁfth anniversary
ofthe founding ofour University. The IF Debate in March,
the IF Handbook and IF's sports program were highlights
in their successful year.

The newest innovation on the Pitt campus and in the
IF Council's program was Greek VVeek. In joint coopera-
tion with Panhellenic Council, IF presented a week ofedu-
cation for the student body on education, leadership,
and cooperation. This week in April included a leadership
conference, joint meeting of IF and Panhellenic Councils,
a progressive fraternity house dance, an outstanding
speaker at Soldier’s and Sailor’s Memorial, the IF—Pan-
hellenic Sing, and concluded with IF Awards Banquet.

The time and effort put forth in preparation for this
week resulted in a great success and IF hopes that Greek
VVeek may become a tradition on the University campus.

Ah! At last exams are over.

One of the youngest fraternities on Pitt’s
campus, Alpha Phi Delta has proven itself also
to be one of the most active. An accent on a high
scholastic average, and outstanding attainments
in the ﬁeld of athletics keep the members busy all
year ’round. Yet the Alpha Phi Delts ﬁnd time for
a formal dance each semester, picnics, smokers,
and several informal dances.

The fraternity was founded at Syracuse
University in 1914, for men of Italo-American
descent. Nu chapter at Pitt, has always main-
tained a place of leadership among the many
branches throughout the country.

Of particular prominence this year was the
Alpha Phi Delt record in athletics. The brothers
are especially proud of Jules Melograme and Al
Sioca, who attained high honors in swimming
competitions, and Paul Mino, who was the
fraternity’s representative on the gridiron.

Members of the fraternity have chosen di-
versiﬁed career goals. Military men or teachers,
engineers or dentists, all of them have helped to
further the aim of Alpha Phi Delta—that of build-
ing better and more capable students who will
assume responsible positions in the ﬁelds of their
choice.

The brothers of Delta Sigma Phi followed the
advice of Horace Greeley and went West last
summer to a very successful and proﬁtable na-
tional convention. Oﬂicers came back with a
wealth of new ideas for making Pitt’s Delta Sig
chapter even more uniﬁed and active than it has
been before. And their plans reached full fruition
in campus activities, in athletics, and in a strong
fraternity spirit.

Highlights of the social calendar were the
annual Sailors’ Ball, and the Spring Carnation
formal.The Sailors’ Ball is a costume dance, and
has become one of the fraternity’s outstanding
traditions. Informal parties, smokers, and discus-
sion meetings completed the Delta Sig social
schedule.

The fraternity celebrated its ﬁfty-third birth-
day in 1959., also. The ﬁrst Delta Sig chapter was
founded at the City College of New York in
1889. Since then it has been established on many
campuses throughout the country. Omega chapter
at Pitt was started in 1916, and though it was
weakened considerably by the depression, came
back to full strength in 1946. Now it has -reached
a position of leadership on campus, and has
achieved an enviable record of success in all its
undertakings.

When the Gamma Sigma chapter of Delta
Tau Delta looks back on 1952, they will remember
one of their most active and enjoyable seasons.
The Delt spirit of brotherhood made for unforget-
table good times and worthy achievements.

Founded nationally at Bethany College in
1859, Delta Tau Delta's Gamma Sigma was
organized at Pitt in 1864. Today, 83 groups com-
prise the fraternity. ‘

Social gatherings all bore the gala DTD
touch. The Bowery Brawl started the season, and
was followed soon after by the annual Delt Din-
ner Formal. The Kappa—Delt reception for the
faculty and the Branch Rickey Baseball Banquet
were but two of the new social affairs. The annual
service at the Trinity Cathedral was a stirring and
memorable occasion.

Gamma Sigma also remembers 1952 as the
year when many Delt brothers served their school
and fraternity through noteworthy service. Joe
Edmundson, as president of IF Council; Leo
Kairys, as vice president of Druids; Don Bravin,
as Assistant Editor of the IF Handbook, and Bill

McKinley, as president of Omicron Delta Kappa.

all worked, along with many others, for the suc-
cess of school activities.

Kappa Nu’s bonds of scholarship, brother-
hood, fellowship and loyalty produced another
ﬁne year for the‘ members of this fraternity. The
brothers strived for. high goals, both in work and
in play. No one will forget the big spring formal
weekend, or the many other dances and social
activities. Another kind of pleasure was experi-
enced as they aided in housing a DP student.
Remodelling the basement of their chapter house
on Craig Street took lots of energy and time, but
the ﬁnal result of a modern, well-equipped play-
room was well worth it.

Founded nationally at Rochester, New York
on February 12, I911, Kappa Nu established the
Xi Chapter at Pitt in 1921. Due to the depression,
the chapter was forced to‘relinquish its charter,
but in 1947 an active Graduate Club brought Xi
back to Pitt. Now in its fifth year, Kappa Nu has
regained its former prestige and has one of the
ﬁnest fraternities on campus. Many of its members
praticipate in school activities, including Men’s
Council, Student Congress, Druids, Pitt Players,
cheerleading, and the Marching Band.

Last year, Kappa Nu distinguished itself by
copping second place in the IF Scholarship race.
A rise from nineteenth to eighth place in competi-
tion for the IF All—Point Trophy is indicative that
Kappa Nu will continue to be one of Pitt's great
fraternities.

The Cross and Crescent men of Lambda Chi
Alpha look back with pride to a fraternity history
that started in November, 1909, at Boston Uni-
versity. The Pitt chapter, one of the strongest
of the one hundred and thirty seven branches,
has an outstanding record of its own. Members
have been active participants in student govern-
ment, in honorary and professional organizations,
on publications, and in campus musical groups.

Lambda Chi’s are proud, too, of their com-
pletely redecorated chapter house at 3515 Fifth
Avenue. A television set, new furniture, and a
pleasing color combination help make the house
a center for relaxation and successful parties. The
Mother's Club, established in 1948, has helped
immensely in the redecoration of the house.

The alumni of Lambda Chi Alpha have given
solid support to the active chapter, too. The alums
were reactivated in 1946, just as the active chap-
ter was. They have grown steadily since that time
and are now larger and stronger than ever before
in their history.

With its high aims and the close fellowship of
its members, Lambda Chi Alpha may look for-
ward to a future that is even brighter than its past.

Goodbye, my Coney Island baby . . . Will Fearless Fosdick live?

A foundation of loyalty, unity, and fellow-

Phi Delta Theta. And grown the fraternity has,
from its inception at Miami University, Oxford,
Ohio, in 1848, to its establishment on more than
one hundred and ten college campuses all over the
United States.

Emphasis on high scholarship didn’t prevent
the Phi Delts from participating actively in IF
athletics, campus organizations, and a full social
calendar. Highlight of this social calendar was
the traditional Phi Delt Spring Formal. Another
outstanding event is the famous Miami Triad
Formal. The Triad is composed of Beta Theta Pi,
Sigma Chi, and Phi Delta Theta, all of which
originated at Miami University. Tea dances, pic-
nics and house parties were on the social calendar,
also.

The fraternity house at 255 North Dithridge
Street resounds with the names of some famous
alumni, too. Benjamin Harrison, Fred M. Vinson,
and Doak Walker all were the badge of Phi Delta
Theta.

With an illustrious history behind it, and a
continual striving toward friendship, culture, and
sound learning, the future of this fraternity should
be a very bright one.

At its National Convention in September at Miami
Beach, Zeta chapter of Phi Epsilon Pi received the highest
of honors—it was ‘named the outstanding Phi Ep chapter
in the country today. Cyril Wecht, the chapter president,
was chosen outstanding Phi Epsilon Phi undergraduate
in the United States. Zeta chapter captured other honors,
too. A Pitt chapter alumnus was elected Grand National
President and their alumnus adviser was elected to
Grand Council.

But Zeta didn’t rest on its laurels. Phi Eps continued
to be outstanding in school activities. Sam Shapiro was a
ﬁne leader as president of the Letterman's Club and a
member of Student Congress. Ronald Ecker held the name
of Phi Ep high as vice president of Men’s Council and
chairman of the Pitt Chest Drive. As cheerleader, Jay
Garber aided Pitt spirit.

The oH'icial opening of Pitt’s social season began for
Phi Ep at Homecoming weekend. Using a Parisienne
theme, the chapter entertained alums and visitors at an
Open House and buffet luncheon. Theatre parties, a Father
and Son Banquet and a Valentine formal at Baldoc Coun-
try Club added still more to the fun and festivity of 1951-
1952. The long—to-be-remembered spring weekend of a
house dance, formal and picnic climaxed the year’s whirl.

At the Senior Banquet in May, when keys were
awarded to the seniors, another truly outstanding chapter
of history was drawn to a close for the Zeta chapter of
Phi Epsilon Pi.

The year 1952 marks the 104th anniversary
of Phi Gamma Delta's founding at Jefferson Col-
lege, now a part of Washington and Jefferson.
Since that ﬁrst date, 81 chapters have been
formed, with Pitt’s Pi Sigma group dating back to
1916.

Phi Gams at Pitt have continually maintained
the spirit and ideals of fraternity life, under the
standards of loyalty, unity, and brotherhood. The
Pi Sigma chapter is proud of its contributors to
the activities of the school, brothers such as Roger
Bognar, member of Omicron Delta Kappa, Stu-
dent Congress, and treasurer of IF Council, and
Robert Teasdale, president of Pershing Riﬂes.

In the line of social affairs, Fijis can always be
counted on to give a well-rounded schedule.
Formal rushing included a swimming party at the
P.A.A., and a formal house dance, followed by a
November formal at the South Hills Country
Club. Homecoming found the Phi Gam open house
a great success.

In 1889 at Brown University, the brother-
hood of Phi Kappa began. Since its founding, 39.
chapters and 2 colonies have been added, all of
which typify the loyalty and friendship of the
original group.

Pitt’s Mu chapter of Phi Kappa, founded in
1923, stresses evenly social and scholastic'partici—
pation. The 1952 social calendar lined up such
events as the traditional fall and spring formal
dinner dances, and the Hallowe’en and Christmas
parties for children. Special occasions include the
honoring of the Phi Kap Sweetheart and the Mu
housemother, Mrs. Camille MacElwee. Summer
house parties, hayrides, and barn dances, along
with sorority and fraternity get—togethers round
out the busy social season.

In the way of activities, Mu is proud of its
many service—minded brothers. Joe Connors, IF
secretary, Member of Druids, Phi Eta Sigma, and
Alpha Phi Omega; Jack Burwinkel, president of
Men’s Council; Don Ligman, IF social chairman;
and Les Valitutti, secretary of the Panther Club
are just a few of the school leaders Phi Kappa can
claim.

The record committee attempts to come to a decision.

Isn’t there a more comfortable place to study?

From its beginnings below the Mason-Dixon
line Pi Kappa Alpha has extended not only
throughout the United States, but also beyond its
borders into Canada. This is just one of the many
indications of the fraternity’s growth and prog-
ress—a growth that has developed steadily since
the ﬁrst chapter was chartered at the University
of Virginia in 1868.

PiKA’s at Pitt have many reasons for being
particularly proud of their own Gamma Sigma
chapter. Not only is it one of the largest on cam-
pus, but also one of the most active. Even the
chapter’s fraternity house lays claim to a Univer-
sity ﬁrst—it was opened on November 9, 1949, at
the first post-war fraternity house—opening on
campus. The ceremony was also the first of its
kind ever televised at Pitt. A higher number of
men named to ODK walk than any other frater-
nity at the University is another proud claim of
Pi Kappa Alpha. And, as a ﬁnal rounding out of
their very diversiﬁed program, PKA’S maintain
a consistently high rank in all intramural sports.

With all these accomplishments, Pitt’s Pi
Kappa Alpha has justification for its fraternity
pride and spirit.

We’re rushing a new type of freshman this semester.

Mention football to a Pi Lam and you’ll im-
mediately bring to him fraternity memories of
195r—52. A six-foot goalpost at the entrance to the
Pi Lam house started off the football season; that
and a party called “Campus Daze,” featuring for
decorations the pennants of all the fraternity
houses at Pitt. Michigan State, very much alive
on the football ﬁeld, found death at the hands of
Pi Lambda Phi. At: their annual Halloween affair,
the “Haunted House" party, the Pi Lam's cap-
tured a coﬂin holding the spirit of Michigan State.
Ohio State found its twenty—ﬁve foot buckeye and
a ten foot paper mache football player guarding
the Pi Lam house entrance. Even the Pittsburgh
papers featured this one—the Sun Telegraph ran
it in a Sunday edition. “Harvest Hop” was the
aﬁair welcoming brother fraternity members from
Penn State.

Sigma Alpha Epsilon, one of the oldest col-
legiate fraternities in the United States, can be
rightfully proud of its Chi\Qmicron chapter at
Pitt. With ﬁfty active brothers, .a modern chapter
house and a helpful alumni association, Pitt’s
SAE is always outstanding in campus activities
and projects. Members can be found in such var-
ied organizations as YMCA, Men’s Council,
Student Congress, IF, and various sport teams
such as track and golf.

The 1951-52 social season was ﬁlled with fun
and fellowship for SAE’s brothers. Football cele-
brations were faithfully observed with brunch be-
fore each game. When Pitt battled Michigan State,
this fraternity followed their team across the
country to Michigan State’s campus. With the
help of a chartered bus, Pitt’s SAE had a grand
time cheering at the game and being entertained
by the State brothers. Christmas found them at
the Chartiers Country Club for the annual formal.
Parties for the orphans at the holidays, house
parties, the spring formal weekend all helped to
round out a successful year.

Founded nationally at the University of Ala-
bama in 1856, SAE now has the largest member-
ship of any national fraternity. Perhaps this can
be accounted for by its deep belief that a college
student can best equip himself for life by the
development of honor, loyalty, and friendship,
and that the bonds of fraternal organizations can
help in this development.

The biggest project for the brothers of Sigma
Alpha Mu in 19 5 1- 52 was the complete remodelling
of their house on Craig Avenue. Using knotty
pine, modern furniture and tiling for all the bed-
rooms, the Sammies now have one of the most up-
to-date fraternity houses on the campus.

Founded in 1909 at City College of New York,
this group joined Pitt’s InterFraternity in 1919,
just ten years after its initial organizing. Their
intensive expansion program has resulted in more
than one new chapter for each year of its existence.

With a newly decorated house, social affairs
took on added attraction for the brothers. Cos-
tume parties, barn dances and two get—togethers
for the orphans at the Jewish Home for Babies
were included in the social season. In the winter
their formal at the Fort Pitt Hotel and a night at
the Playhouse added to the fun. The highlight

Crowded into three days were a picnic, house
dance and a dinner formal at the Baldoc Country

Sigma Chi opened the fall semester of 1951
with a bang—they have a modernized,completely
redecorated house at 3510 Fifth Avenue! With
such a great improvement over their previous
apartment, the Sigma Chi’s year really began as a
success.

Founded in 18 5 5 at Oxford, Ohio, this group
has grown to be the second largest national social
fraternity in the country, with 122 active chap-
ters. Their sweetheart song is famous, and their
alumni include such outstanding people as Milt
CaniPf, Booth Tarkington, Hervey Allen and
Pitt's own “Jock” Sutherland. Sigma Chi also
has been unique in the founding of an employment
bureau which beneﬁts its members by placing
them in the business world.

Sigma Chi is not only outstanding nationally;
the Pitt chapter has many leaders of campus ac-
tivities, including Bob Lyles, chairman of the 1951
Spring Festival, Jim Bragg, president of Alpha
Phi Omega, and Hugh Peery, who holds the Pan-
American Olympic wrestling champion title.
Among the IF trophies decrating their mantle are
the 1951 football championship and swimming
championship for the past two years.

Sigma Phi Epsilon is not a new name at Pitt.
After the fraternity founding in 1901 at William
and Mary in Richmond, Virginia, the chapter was
organized at Pitt in 1903. In 1911 this chapter
became inactive and was not re-organized until
1949 when Jack Adams and Phil Zoeller, two
transfer undergraduates, reactivated the chapter.
Now they have forty-ﬁve active members and
look forward to many more successful years at
Pitt.

One of the favorite projects of the actives is
their Christmas part-y for orphans. This year with
their own “unpadded” Santa Claus, the members
and their dates entertained thirty boys and girls
from an orphanage in Perrysville.

Other important dates on their social calendar
are the Founders’ Day banquet and their two an-
nual dinner dances, usually held at the Jacktown
Hotel.

Norwich University in Vermont was the first
home of Theta Chi, one of the largest and most
active of men's fraternities. Since its founding in
1919, the brotherhood has spread to one hundred
and ﬁve campuses throughout the country.

Theta Chi’s at Pitt devoted a great deal of
time to campus activities this year. Druids and
ODK, the Varsity band, and the Glee Club as
well as publications and,student government bene-
ﬁted from their participation.

The fraternity’s social calendar was a very
busy one, too. Highlight of the year was an Apache
Party where Pitt’s chapter played host to West
Virginia Theta Chi’s. The men dressed as French
sailors and entertained their apache girl dates
with songs and skits. Another successful social
was the Polynesian Party, featuring a palm—tree
decorated house, and complete with South Sea
Islander costumes.

Children of the St. Paul Orphanage in Car-
negie benefited from the Theta Chi brotherhood,
too. The children were entertained at a Christmas
party sponsored by the fraternity, which presented
them with gifts, and led them in songs and games.

Seven men at Cornell University who wanted a closer
bond of friendship and a more uniﬁed exchange oflearning
than they found in classroom contacts were the founders of
Alpha Phi Alpha, a national fraternity established in 1906.
Since its beginning the brotherhood has spread to 212
campuses with two overseas chapters, including one at
Oxford, England.

The goals of the fraternity, as they are expressed in
the Alpha hymn, are high ones—“manly deeds, scholarship
and love for all mankind.” To further these aims a policy
of interracial membership is included in the organization's
constitution.

A busy calendar, based on the plan of doing things
with many deep and lasting friendships. Built on such a

A real spirit of brotherhood has been attained by the
members of Kappa Beta Phi, the youngest social fraternity
on Pitt's campus. Men of all faiths belong to the group,
which constantly practices its goals of good fellowship
and close unity.

The fraternity has experienced a rapid growth since
its founding on Pitt’s campus—one of the very few fra-
ternities founded locally, incidentally. Its list of alumni
now includes men in graduate schools throughout the
country, as well as those who hold responsible positions in
the business world.

Kappa Beta Phi men have made an enviable record
for themselves both scholastically and in extra—curricular
activities. One of the highlights of the fraternity program
is its annual Spring Festival show, which always draws
large crowds. This is just one indication of the over-all
success of the organization.

The men of Sigma Pi can claim membership
in the second oldest national fraternity east of
the Ohio River. They can claim justiﬁable pride,
too, in the accomplishments.of their own Chi chap-
ter at Pitt.

Pitt’s chapter was chartered in 1923. During
the war, when so many members of the group
went into the armed services, it was forced to go
inactive. Despite this severe setback, Sigma Pi
managed to keep its unity, so that in 1948, with
the help of the Penn State chapter, it regained its
former place on campus. Since then the fraternity
has had a steady record of progress and growth.
The record includes outstanding participation in
school activities and in sports, as well as a high
scholastic rating.

Stray Greeks is unique at Pitt. Founded in
1947, the organization provides fraternity aﬂilia-
tion for those male transfer students who are
members of Greek letter fraternities which do not
have chapters on campus. This is the only Stray
Greek “chapter.”

As members of Interfraternity Council, the
Stray Greeks support and participate in all of the
IF projects and activities, social, as well as scho-
lastic.They are active in all of the sports compe-
titions, even though their membership is limited.
They are high-ranking in scholarship and have
held the IF scholarship trophy. These “stays” are
energetic workers for Interfraternity Council,
helping to keep a good fraternity spirit at Pitt.

Although they have no chapter house, their
social life is not neglected. Once again they back
IF with full strength and are ﬁne party planners
for their group.

The Stray Greeks are happy to have as a
member and an advisor Doctor Ferguson of that
Economics Department, who is a member of Phi

I-F Formal

In the spring, Pitt fraternity men's fancies
turn to thoughts of Inter—Fraternity Ball, one of
the biggest dances on campus. Every fraternity is
represented in the planning and organization of
the ball, so that it is really a co—operative effort.
This year's dance centered around a colonial
theme, complete with a white-wigged, satin-
trousered honor guard. The guard formed a ﬁtting
background for this year’s I-F queen, pretty
senior, Jean Ann Sunderman. Jean Ann, chosen
from a group of four finalists nominated by the
fraternities, was crowned by Clare Lippert, this
year's Miss Pennsylvania, in a special ‘ceremony
held in the ballroom.

 

  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

A name band for the LF Ball is always one of
the big attractions. This year Ray Anthony, “The
young man with the horn” provided the music for
the large crowd of dancers, who often gathered
around the bandstand to watch him play. Crowds
gathered around the bandstand at intermission,
too, to watch the cavortings of Bud, a trained seal.
This year’s fa.vors—-miniature picture frames-—
were also a nice addition to the program.

  
  
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
  
  

Faculty, administration, stu-
dents, and campus visitors all shared
together their ideas on “What does
God require of me?”, this year’s
Religion-in—Life theme. Dr. T. Z.
Koo, special visitor to the campus
from the University of Iowa, opened
the week at a convocation held in
Carnegie Music Hall. Other speak-
ers, clergy from the community as
well as those who came from allover
the United States, helped Pitt
students to understand not only the
tenets of each established religion,
but also the universally shared beau-
ty of all of them. This in itself is the
essence of the wonderful success of
this special week at Pitt.

Religion-in-Life
Week

Spring at Pitt is a time for re-
evaluation, an opprtunity to think
about the things which are impor-
tant in the lives of all of us; a time,
too, for looking around and counting
our blessings. It is with these things
in mind that the campus dedicates
one week each Spring to Religion-
in-Life. During this week students
hear class room speakers who repre-
sent every religious denomination;
participate in many discussions on
faith and worship; and try to express
verbally those goals of growth and
understanding toward which they
work all year ’round.

Spring at Pitt has always been synonymous with two
other words—Spring Festival. Tents and shows, booths
and float parades have made that combination of fun and
work and worry that comprise Festival week on campus.

This year Pitt men and women looked to the ancients
for inspiration—“Pitty-y the Romans,” complete with a
toga—draped panther, was the theme for Festival, 1952.
Jack Greenburg, chairman of the program worked with
Robert" Lyles, business manager, and Bert Sichelstiel,
publicity chairman, to plan a ﬂoat parade based on Roman
myths, a Roman festival for the carnival on the lawn, and
a big Ball to climax the week.

Spring Festival at Pitt is a cooperative effort. All
organizations on campus have an opportunity to partici-
pate, and to compete in all the contests and the carnival
program.

azl, )\

Spring Festival committees
start their work early in the sec-
ond semester, long before the
campus begins to think about
that busy week in May. Com-
mittee heads plan the theme, then
build the speciﬁc events of Festi-
val-ﬂoat parade, a fair on the
lawn, and Festival Ball—around
that theme. This year’s planners
found that the Roman theme
could be very nicely integrated
into a ﬂoat parade based on
mythology, and a fair modeled
after a Roman carnival. A new
idea, built around a “Roam ’n
Around” theme was also planned
for this year——each sorority and
fraternity on campus planned in-
side and outside house decora-
tions to ﬁt in with the theme.
Each house was judged, and the
winning groups received a special
trophy. The committee planned
an extra—spectacular opening for
Festival, too—a Vestal Fire was
lit at the opening ceremony, with
a torch that had been carried by
relay runners from a “Roman
galley” docked on the Mononga-
hela River.

  
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
   

Spring Festival - 1951

They told us to “Go West” and so
we went. And what did we ﬁnd—guns and
horses and purty gals. Then there was
shootin’ and gamblin’ and more purty
gals. Don Eagle came to “Western” Pitt
in grand old Indian style, feathers and all.
Pitt cowpokes grew beards for weeks be-
fore Carnival started and the Cowgirls
wore their ridin’ togs to class every Thurs-
day.

The first day of Festival brought the
ﬂoat parade to the tune of Range
Rhythms. All through Oakland the ﬂoats
carried the themes of “Big Rock Candy
Mountain,” “Chinese Mule Train,” “Red
Silk Stockings and Green Perfume.” A
“Gal and Calico" and "Jack of Diamonds”
took the two ﬁrst—place trophys for the
Tri Sigs and the Pi Lams.

Partners in show business opened
their wild west shows with Indian war
dances, can—can girls, and gun-totin’ guys.
“Prairie Pandemonium” invaded the
Carnival at the Zeta—Sigma Chi tent and
featured “Annie Oakley” with “You
Can’t Get a Man with a Gun.” “Pande-
monium” stayed and won the cup for the
best show.

The old Medicine man came, too, and
gave us the “Wild West Medicine Show.”
The medicine Was fully guaranteed and
won the concession booth award for the
Newman Club.

And that’s how Pitt went West in
May!

Fast Travelin’ went West during the Sweeptstake Races. From up near the
Stadium on down to Bayard Street the “timer” was cleared and the trail was blazed.
The Phi Gam travelers lassoed the ﬁrst prize.

There were no blazing guns at the presentation of the Athletic awards on Varsity
Day. The Hartwig trophy was presented to the outstanding senior athlete.

In the real spirit of western competition a new tradition was started during Carni-
val week. The Pitt Varsity Football team played against the Old—Timers. And without
drawin’ their guns the Varsity won the ﬁrst game 13-0.

The climax of our Western Week was the Gold Rush Ball at West View dance
land. Harry James provided the music for the dancers, and the main event of the
evening was the naming of Pitt’s Calamity Jane. The title went to Carol Frownfelter.
She was named Queen of Spring Festival and presented with a trophy and a bouquet
of roses by Harry James and Ronnie Ecker, Ball Chairman. Carol was chosen by
Cecil B. De Mille from the ﬁve ﬁnalists who had been picked by Hopalong Cassidy.

When the ball was over, the Pitt westerners came back east to complete another
festival season.

Commons Room Ball

Spring at Pitt has a Very special meaning to the Seniors on campus—-for them it
is both an end and a beginning; for them spring is a time for leave—taking, for a last
look at things long—familiar. A culmination of this leave—taking is the Senior dance
held in the Commons Room. Last spring marked the beginning of the Commons Room
Ball. Seniors found the location and idea so much to their liking that the 1951 Ball
was the beginning of another Pitt tradition. And, there to welcome a new tradition
was another well—established one—Fergy, one of the campus’ favorite professors was
there to entertain and to mingle with the students he likes so much.

Congmtulatiomf

Our congratulations to you, the young men and women graduates
of the University of Pittsburgh. You have completed your prescribed
courses; but more importantly, you are ready to begin your careers in
the world.

We take it for granted that you have acquired the foundation for
the skills and knowledge that will be required of you.

What is of far more concern is whether you have been able to
«acquire the habits and the attitudes of mind and of spirit that your
community, your country and the world need so sorely.

In the two decades during which you have come to maturity, you
have seen one crisis after another. These crises have been only the out-
ward manifestations of the inner ills that afflict us and the inevitable
results of our past failures to live and act by those principles we all know
but often violate as individuals, as groups, and as a nation.

And so I urge upon you that you give thought to so shaping your
personal lives and conduct, in every moment of each daily stint, that
honesty and truth and devotion to your God will pervade our national
life. Only in this way can your lives and the lives of men everywhere be
blessed by peace and happiness.

We are conﬁdent that you will direct your lives to that end.

In the very beginning, when Pittsburgh was only a cluster of cabins at the
Point, two dreams stirred its soul—a splendid, surging materialism, and a yearning
for cultural growth. That these two have achieved a happy symbiosis is brilliantly
expressed today in the Cathedral of Learning.

0 It could have been a temptation, in this town of teeming potentialities,
to concentrate solely on the practical. Wealth always burgeoned here—in farm
products, coal, iron, glass, oil, and steel. Any man with horse-sense and a right
good will to work, could wrest a fortune from the wilderness, seemingly overnight.

0 This city was singularly blessed though, by the quality of the people who
came here in search of a fuller life. They recognized early a need for the specialized
type of training our industries would require. But they wished, for their sons and
daughters, much more than this. With William Penn they believed that “good
and commendable learning is to be preferred before wealth.”

O A succession of such great men——founders, trustees, chancellors, teachers,
and alumni—have steered our university’s destiny from the log cabin Academy
of 1787 to the Cathedral of today. Under their vigil has grown up a special type of
university that marries, in its wide curriculum, both the cultural and the practical.
The Cathedral of Learning, itself a uniquely American architectural expression,
is a symbol of a uniquely American type of education.

0 Also uniquely American was the early development of the food manu-
facturing business. For more than three generations we have been preparing
ready-to-serve delicacies to save the time and elfort of America's housewives.

A Career
with a Future

  

0 With 55 plants in 25 states, Koppers activities are so many and
so varied that every day you come in direct contact with some
product or service made ossible b Koppers that helps to in-
crease your comfort, guard) your hea th, enrich your life.

HISTORY

Origin of Koppers Company, Inc., dates back to june 10, 1907
when Heinrich Koppers, a young German engineer who had de-
vised a better way of heating chemical-recovery coke ovens, es-
tablished engineering ofﬁces at Joliet, Ill.

Koppers set about building a battery of his coke ovens for the
Illinois Steel Company. The budding young steel industry of the
United States watched with interest, recognizing that the Koppers
ovens made better coke, and at the same time recovered the gas,
tar and other products which the old bee-hive ovens burned off.

GROWTH

From a small engineering ﬁrm, later purchased by American
interests and moved to Pittsburgh, Ko pers grew rapidly, enter-
ing new ﬁelds opened by the chemical-recovery coke ovens. To
supply cities with gas and coke, it built for itself and operated
several batteries of the coke ovens. It built lants for the recovery
of benzene and toluene which were so badlly needed for produc-
tion of explosives during World War I. It be an to make tar
products such as road and rooﬁng materials, to End ways of et-
ting more of the chemical derivatives from tar, and to utilize
certain chemicals that could be recovered from the coking process.

Experience at building complicated coke oven batteries led
Koppers into other ﬁelds of metallurgical engineering and con-
struction. Today Koppers and its Freyn En ineering Department
are known throughout the world as buil ers of superior blast
furnaces, sintering plants, rolling mills and entire integrated steel
plants.

 

Koppers is a world leader in design-
ing and constructing coke oven plants

World War II saw a need for s nthetic rubber, and the govern-
ment, recognizing Koppers ability in constructing specialized
chemical plants, asked it to build a plant at Kobuta, Pa., to make
styrene and butadiene, primary ingredients of synthetic rubber.

After the war, Koppers urchased art of the Kobuta plant and
converted it to the manu acture of t e versatile plastic molding
material—polystyrene. With four other chemical lants in opera-
tion, and a sixth under construction, Koppers has become a grow-
ing unit of America’s rapidly expanding chemical industry.

RESEARCH

Recognizing that continued growth demands unceasing efforts
to better serve industry and the public, Koppers places great em-
phasis on scientiﬁc research . . . research t at’ makes many prod-
ucts better and many better products possible.

In addition to extensive participation at Mellon Institute,
Koppers is preparing to open a Research Center at Verona, Pa.

CAREER OPPORTUNITIES

A career with Koppers offers the qualiﬁed college graduate in-
teresting work, at good pay and with a high degree of job security.
Comprehensive training programs have been developed to pre-
pare you for an initial position and for future advancement. Ex-
ecutive positions are, with few exceptions, ﬁlled by those who

thanks again to the deserving few

Irv Greenberg

March 15, I952 . . . The 1952 Owl went to press. 339 days had gone by since Leizer Balk and
Marvin Jacobson were appointed on April 11, 1951 to the positions of Editor and Busiess Man-
ager. Yes, 339 days of hard, concentrated work that was done almost entirely by students. The
staff that was gathered from all schools in the University worked those long tedious hours while
keeping up in classes. The entire Owl staff totaled 49 members. All 49 played an important part in
getting the Owl out on time for the second consecutive year. Of these 49 staffers, there are some
who deserve an extra—special thank you for their parts in making the 1952 Owl a better and more
complete record of the school life at Pitt during 1952-52.

Leading the list of “Night Owls” was IRV GREENBERG, who did an outstanding job as
Photography Editor. IRV worked many 30-hour weeks, while going to class, in scheduling, taking,
and developing most of the pictures in the yearbook. Despite this heavy responsibility, IRV
Anne Gussin found time to help out on layout and design and also keep the office in good spirits.

Next, MARVIN JACOBSON, Business Manager, put in many hours planning and carrying
out the ﬁnancial side of the Owl. To MARV belongs the credit for the sound ﬁnancial basis of
the Owl this year.

In charge of writing all the copy was ANNE GUSSIN, who with her small but able staﬂ‘,
fulﬁlled the position of Literary Editor most capably by writing copy that was complete and to
the point and ﬁnished on time.

HARRY SCHARF, as Assistant Business Manager, acted as a liason oﬂicer between the
editorial and business staffs. Jovial HARRY always took the yearbook troubles and crises with a
smile and offered a ready solution.

For the ﬁrst time in Owl history, a girl was named Sports Editor. JOAN GARBER performed
this job very well; in fact, better than most any male might do. This was another sign that women
are moving up in the world.

.IQan Garber The Classes Section, the largest single section in the book, was handled almost entirely by
BOB FULTON. The Christmas and mid-semester vacations found BOB in room 829 cutting and
pasting the senior portraits.

The “Two Trouble Shooters,” GLORIA HENEGHAN and MARIAN ISSAC, planned,
produced, and edited the most trying of all sections, the Fraternity and Sorority Section. The
“Sisters” managed to assemble the Greeks in a way that pleased everybody.

PEGGY MYERS, Activities Editor, kept things running smoothly as the Editor's assistant.
No job Was. too small or too large for little PEGGY to do.

Last but not least of the deserving 10 was BARBARA MILLEN, who was in charge of
Special Sections. BARBARA spent week after week designing Pitt in Fall, Pitt in Winter, and
Pitt in Spring in order to get a concise and accurate record of the events and happenings of the
school year at Pitt.

Bob Fulton Along with the students who worked to produce this book, valuable advice and help were
given by DR. DENTON BEAL, Director of Student Publication, PROFESSOR ROBERT X.

 GfRAI-IAM, Head of the Journalism Department, and DEAN THEODORE W. BIDDLE, Dean
0 Men. ‘

Thanks to MR. TOM JARRET, University Photographer, who spent considerable time
Itaeackhing and helping our student photographers and who also took some special pictures for the

oo .

The Pittsburgh Newspapers, POST GAZETTE, SUN TELEGRAPH, and PRESS, fur-
nished quite a few pictures for out introductory section and the sports section.

MR. CY HUNGERFORD of the POST GAZETTE drew the Owl caricatures that are on
the division pages and the cover. A better symbol could not have been drawn.

Despite all the work that the staﬂ" did with the help of all these people, the book would not
have been completed on time had it not been for the close co—operation of RALPH BENZ of the
Marian Isaac S. K. Smith Co. . . . Covers; DON MESSINGER ofWm.  Keller Inc. . . . Printers; and FRANK
O’NEILL of the Chidnoff Studios . . . Photographers.

May 7, I952 . . . The 1952 Owl came out on Tap Day. A ﬁnal tribute to the hardworking crew
of “49” on the Eighth Floor.
