EUGENE CECIL BEAM, <I>AE

Moundsville High School.

The last germ of a vanishing race. A good listener. The
apple of the class's eye. Fortune certainly smiled on us when
Beam joined us last fall.

CHARLES DANA BIERER, 2<I»E

Uniontown High School.

Please don’t call me Fink. VVillie thinks the world and all

WILEIAM LESTER BODKIN, NEN

Ingram High School.

Here we have the frowning man. Foghorn for the Dissect-

gust,” but after all, 21 good friend and an able man.

STEPHEN ‘AUGUSTINE DAWSON, <I>X

and despises formality.

ANDREW PETER DZMARA,

SAUL HYMAN FRANKS,
Pittsburgh High School.

Franks, with his resounding Oi, Oi, Oi, is our Yiddish Glad-
iator. Uses his teeth and nails Very effectively, but is really
not so hard as he looks. Doesn't believe in studying till just
before exams, but then he “grinds.”

ALBERT J. BRUECKEN,

The human interrogation point. Lives on the North Side, and,

naturally, specializes in “Suicides.” Has a wonderful hirsute

appendage, and takes good care of it. Full of energy, and great
aid to the less energetic.

JOHN HUGHES GALBRAITH, <I>BII

Pittsburgh Academy.

Handsome Jack, the only true imitation of Pediatrican El-
terich. A high—class fusser, and the “Chief Heart Breaking
Boy” of his local town. A merry optimist with a smile all his
own, and a sporter of an original “teddy" hair-cut.

CHARLES ELLSWORTH HARRIS, <I>BH

Pittsburgh High School.
Glee Club.
Class President.

Charles Ellsworth certainly does look cute in a high—hat and
a spike—tail. Has forsaken his position as dramatic critic at
the Gayety, and is now doing research work in Ferninology.
The relation of his anterior posterior diameter to the Congitu~
dinal is inﬁnite.

EDWIN BLAIR HENRY, (DP)?

Mercersburg Academy.
. & J. College.

The human cyclone. A dapper befreckled youth who pos-
sesses a serious outlook on his chosen life. Likable, light
hearted, manly—Hen is a man to whom to stick.

HOMER LEROY HILL, 2<I>E

Ohio Northern University.

A stern-faced, dreamy—eyed, strong—armed mountaineer who
photographs his nightmare, and by mental telepathy wakes up
Bierer in the middle of the night. Someone tells that Homer
once stepped from “the straight and narrow," but we can't
believe it, for he stuck to his principles for three years in a place
where principles usually last about three minutes.

JOHN M. JACKSON, q>x

Slippery Rock Normal.

Languid jack from Beaver. His musical career was fractured
when Harmony and Time became “the" thing, so Jack turned
towards pilldom. He is now dad's chief diagnostician.

ALFRED HARTMAN KRAFT, <I>X

Pittsburgh High School.

This good old craft has weathered many a storm. Habitually
late and getting later. A bold, bad man with no conﬁdence in
the fair sex; this lack of conﬁdence is the logical result, perhaps,
of his more or less intimate acquaintance with Eva Tanguay.

A JOHN CLEON KERR, rI>BH

McKeesp0rt High School.

v

The original “Sunny Jim.’ Very funny, using Verbal wit and
facial gymnastics a la Eddie Foy. VVe imagine John's char«
acter was superﬁne till we found out his dream——to be Mayor of
McKeesport. But, as his dream fades, his character advances,
and Kerr's future is settled as a pill prescriber.

FREDERICK VICTOR LICHTENFIELDS, «PPS

Pitcairn High School.

Red is shrewd, silent, and boyishly masterful. No doubt he
aims to excel as a Mum, Mum doctor, but no matter what he
aims to do he certainly has us believing that he knows more than
most of us.

RUSSEL CLEVELAND LICHTENFELS, <1>PE

LAWRENCE R. LINHART, <1>BH

firmly believes that all things come to him who waits. Does
well what he has to do, but with the least possible exertion.
An irrepressible tease, but a joyful, 1ight—heartcd boy.

MILTON F. MANNING, <I>AE
Waynesburg College.

A Waynesburg Local Optionist, methodical and versatile.
Milton gets the maximum results from the minimum amount of
study. Occasionally hc mingles with our suburban girls, but
beware, Milt, every rose has its thorn.

JOHN LADA MILLER, <i>B1I
McKeesport High School.

Our large—bodied friend whose brain is still in embryo. A
star rough»houscr and special tantalizer of Kerr. Milt’s large
smile is. winning, however, and will make for him many friends.

WILLIAM H. MONAGAN,
Wilcox High School.

Bill has a limited amount of knowledge plus common sense.
A good combination that. Chemically speaking, Monagan’s case
is diagnosed as Thoracic Villosum. He would surely raise a
rumpus in Kane's politics, if he were Abel.

EDWARD  MCCAGUE,
Braddock High School and Pittsburgh Pharmacy

Thinks he can discuss everybody and everything from Adam
and creation to Dr. Ehrlich and the present time. Desires to
inquire into psychological and ethical mysteries, but aside from
these little peculiarities, Ed. is alright.

JOSEPH WILLIAM MCMEANS, <i>X
Cleveland South High School.

The color of a man's hair is often a key to his temperament.
What hair Mac has is ﬁne. Puzzle: ﬁnd parliamentarian, but
that lets him out.

SAMUEL BEMIS PEARCE, 2<I>E

Pittsburgh High School.
Owl Board.
Athletic Representative.

The Friend—making kid. Our ever-smiling S. B. has achieved
some reputation both as a student and a good fellow. Claims
that as a child he possessed a beautiful mop of hair, but his
studies and researches have reduced this mop to nothingncss,
and his top-knot glares like the midday sun.

E. M. SMITH, NEN

Mr. Smith of Bellevue has been trying to cultivate cilia on
his labia susperioris; if his efforts are successful the “Pride” is
going to start a rope factory. Of course we shall patronize
home industry, so keep it up E. M., keep it up. The boy’s
thoughts may come instantly, but his speech is always late.

J. HOWARD SEIPEL, <I>X
Allegheny High School.

Howard has a brilliant future ahead of him—if he practices
where no one lives. Always gets in wrong and then smiles.
Here’s to better luck, kid.

GEORGE CULLISON SEITZ, <i>X

Grove City Clllege.

A good fellow. Always has a smile like a drummer. Bases
his hope of future fortune on a visionary string of ponies. George
takes his exercise at night, and its verbal exercise, at that.

CLARENCE CARLTON CAMPMAN, <I>BII

Staunton Military Academy.

Camp can declaim for an hour, with a nucleus of one word.
His chief pleasure is in blowing off surplus steam.

CARL J. SCHEFFER, 2<I>E

Pittsburg Academy.

The immortal Pythias. Carl takes life easy. never bones,
except the night before “exams,” and then, just as a matter of
form, don’t you know. SehelTer’s idea of an ideal night is a
poeketful of money, an angora hat, a Winsome nurse, and a long,
long walk.

THOMAS M. SHAFFER, 21<I>E
Mt. Jackson High School.

A tremendous frame, blue eyes, and a pate nude as Venus
de Milo serve as symptoms to indicate a mental hernia and a
proneness for Tom to prescribe forty calibre capsules. A bene-
dict of many years.

JAMES WYLIE STEVENSON, NEN

Chester High School.

Stens, the old gridiron warhorse, who assists at all our Comedies
of Error, and whose bulk threatens to demolish all our fur-
niture. Delights to debate daily with Laughlin.

VITE E. VAN KIRK, NEN
Braddock High School.

Wants to be high—minded, so he wears a high, tight collar and
a. tightly tied tie. An aﬂinity expert who has ﬁnally settled his
affections on one poor girl. Always leaves clinics early, pre-
sumably because he can learn no more.

CHARLES WILLIAM VATES, <I>PE
Union High School.

Charlie is the class's little opposer. Does not know the
meaning of the word compromised, and earnestly contends for
his way, and his way only. Someone told him vates means
seer, and he certainly thinks he possesses a prophetic vision.

DAVID EARL VOGAN,

Sandy Lake High School.
Sandy Lake Institute.

A high1y—developed product, both mentally and morally,
of his own little town. Dave absorbs what knowledge he can,
and wanders off to his room, innocent of the pleasures of a
great city.

EDWARD WILLIAM ZURHORST, <I>X

Pittsburgh High School.
Class Treasurer.

The shadowless man. Ed. has to wear an overcoat to cast
a shadow, but slenderness, in his case, is made up for by ﬂawless
brain work. His saintliness is to be patterned after, and his
conversation comes in short pieces, far apart.

IRA CLIFFORD DUNCAN,

Grecnsburg Academy.
Geneva College.

Eldest son of Foxy Grandpa. Quiet and non-assertive.
Has something on Job in patience. Dun is an expert manipu-
lator of castor oil, paregoric and teething beads. Our best wish
is that he may have as many patients as he has patience.

LESTER HOLLANDER,

Lester is the “student of students.” His specialty is how to

Curly, black hair; a nose like leape Harm; a combination
Critic and perpetual motion Wa1k—that’s Kusimin. Great
rider of ponies, very s1ick—t0o slick.

ARTHUR ELLWOOD WHITTAKER,
Ellwood High School.

An oddity, physically,—he has a moon face, but an eagle eye.
Has driven himself to keep up with his class, and will return to
that dear Ellwood a full ﬂedged M. D.

NATHAN ASHINSKEY,
Pittsburgh High School

Sneeze, sneeze, sneeze. Inherited the eyes and nose
of his father, but the cheek of his uncle who was an
insurance agent. Holds the record for non-change of
covering of his pedal externities. Does a facial con-
tortion act when he recites.

WILLIAM CLINTON BURCHFIELD, <I>BH

Ashland High School. '
Philadelphia College of Pharmacy.

Foxy Grandpa. Loves our fair co—ed, but since he is
married, he presses his suit by reading to her Bud
Fisher's classic works during clinic hours. Calls her
his “Pulchra rosa” and holds for her a place in his
large heart.

CLARENCE CARLTON CAMPMAN, <I>BH

Staunton Military Academy.

Camp can declaim for an hour, with a nucleus of
one word. His chief pleasure is in blowing off surplus
steam.

JOHN RICHARD CAROTHERS, ECIDE
Charleroi High School.

“Look at my chest expansion.” Very chesty,
indeed, and an exponent of checkers and poker. Has
a happy disposition which rather counterbalances his
mental and physical chestiness.

WILLIAM BROWN CLOWES, <i>X

Pittsburgh High School.
Varsity Base-ball.

Theatrical shark, with a cosmopolitan taste.
Believes the world owes him a living, and considers
study entirely out of place. A good fellow, but he'll
have to work up. '

HENRY JAMES GILES, NZN

Allegheny College.
Glee Club.

The gentleman possessing the tenor voice which is.

sadly in need of oil. A would—be Caruso, but he combs
his hair like John Drew, and strives to be a Midnight
Son. Though a minister’s son, he is secretary of the
Frappe Club, and is a gay bird.

HARRY L. GRAZIER, NZN
Rowe College.

Blondie’s chief aim is to be a renowned doctor.
During his “soph" year, he developed a septicemia of
Spirillum Blasphemous, and he still has it. Practised
last vacation—Lord, the nerve!

THEODORE LYLE HAZELETT, NEN
Grove City College.

Ted has glittering silvery hair and a much used grin.
Originated the sentence, “Let’s cut.” A splendid
student not wise, but otherwise. He uses tobacco in
all the forms in which his friends possess it; a great
grafter, and in his logical place, class treasurer.

HOWARD HERMAN HEINRICH, <I>PE
State College.
Class President ’08.

Heinrich, a stumpy, little German, is ‘chief “hot air
merchant” of the “Medical Department," and has
the job cinched. Held some office at State College
(emphasis on the some). jolly and reliable.

PERRY LAUGHLIN,
Adrian College.
“Pid" suits him better that his parent-given name.

His whole existence was formerly bound up in tobacco,
but Lady Laughlin now shares honors with Lady

_Nicotine. “Is Matrimony a Failure?” Ask Pid.

EDWARD B. MALLOY, <I>BH

Niagara University.

A care-free, cheery Irishman who specializes in dope
on college athletics. Ed has a side—arm motion like
Christy Mathewson. Has kissed the Blarney stone,
and from it seems to have gathered his medical know-
ledge.

RALPH SUMNER MARTIN, <i>PE
California Normal.

Ralph and Study are not exactly pals, but Ralph
is never an “also ran” at “exams" time. He is
otherwise known as “Fatty" Grub and sports a
motto, “Multum ex parvo."

CHARLES C. MOORE,
Edenburgh High School.

Perpetually smiling. Emits remarks as sharp as a
scalpel. Moore is a maker of really original jokes, and
delights in working them on Steve. He is a good-
natured, hard-working “Med.”

HOWARD HENRY PERMAR, <i>PE
Union High School.

Winsome, little Permar, the Gibson girl. Past
twenty, but looks as guileless as though she were
sixteen. Her sign will be “Flossie” Permar, M. D.;
no rowdies admitted.

SIMON PATNER,
Pittsburgh High School.
“Si” alias Rip Van Winkle. Has that popular and

spreading disease politely called the Hookworm. His
head gearingvhas never been ascertained—too many

wheels. Will, no doubt, prescribe patent medicines

and Humphrey’s speciﬁcs.

ZACCHEUS ROSCAS SCOTT,

Westminster College.

The squirmy mercurial Zac., the rapid change
thought artist. One moment gloomy, the next cheer-
ful. The last hope of the white race. “Where’s your
collar. Zac?”

THOMAS M. SHAFFER, EQE
Mt. Jackson High School.

A tremendous frame, blue eyes, and a pate nude as
Venus de Milo serve as symptoms to indicate a mental
hernia and a proneness for Tom to prescribe forty cali-
bre capsules. A benedict of many years. Tom is wise.

CHARLES WESLEY SHIREY, NEN
Pittsburgh High School.

The class chip gatherer. Little Wizened old looking,
fellow who can tell funny stories with an air of comic
gravity. Card shark whose lucky card is the King of
Spades, but who once played the King of Hearts and
won.

Page
One hundred eighteen

HENRY MORRIS SNITZER,
Pittsburgh High School.

Quite a dark horse. He certainly surprised some
people by his outpouring of medicine lore. Snitzer
is a hard man to convince, perhaps that is why he chums
with Ashinskey.

ROSE E. STANLEY,

Oil City High School.
Class Secretary.

The ﬁrst and last rose in medicine. She is a little
temptress, this angelic-faced girl with her cupid bow
lips, but Rose is a diligent student, and excels in rapid
note taking.

PAUL HARDTMAYER WALTER, <I>’lA

Mercersburg Academy.
Lafayette College.

Paul is the Beau Brummel of the class. Sartorially,
he is in a class by himself. His vests are dreams, his
scarfs are creations, and his hats are the envy of all
would-be sports. He is well stocked with pointed and
aristocratic phrases, and may, ultimately be a real
physician.

CARL H. STEIN, q>p2
N. A. G. W. Normal School, Milwaukee.

“Every Day is Ladies Day with Me." Strictly a
ladies man, with side lines of oratory and athletics.

ALVIN c. STONER,

Doane Academy.

Very serious person this; smiles rarely, and then only
at Rose. An ideal, serious lover. Very philoso-
phical, but- undemonstrative and quiet. Rose will
probably change the man somewhat.

CLARENCE M. STRAESSLEY, 2<I>E

Pittsburgh College.
St. Vincents College.

Another staid, serious boy. Started on a career of
engineering, but thought better of it, because “Dad's
an M. D., you know." Clarence’s name is a synonym
for quiet endeavor.

WILLIAM HAROLD THOMPSON, <i>PE
W. & J. Academy.

Laughs like a imule brays. Works with all his
strength, and roots hard for Pitt. Good work, boy,
good work. ‘

DAVID EARL VOGAN,

Sandy Lake High School.
Sandy Lake Institute.

A highly-developed product, both mentally and
morally, of his own little town. Dave absorbs what
knowledge he can, and Wanders off to his room, in-
nocent of the pleasures of a great city.

MAX WEINBERG,

The burner of midnight oil. The murderer of the
English language. Max is a second Ichabod Crane,
but some day he will probably take Dr. Guthrie's
advice, and really ﬁnd out what he is talking about.

HARRY WHITE,

Fredonia Institute.

Harry is the only white man in the class. Firmly
believes that a man is never too old to learn. His
favorite diversion is “ Old Maids,” though we sometimes
believe he switches to the great American game.
White is studious but “exams” fuss him.

LEYDEN FREDERICK WILSON, <I>X
Tarentum High School.

Wilson wishes it emphasized that he does not live
in the country, nor does he keep a cow. Has a power-
ful voice and his surgical ability is commensurate with
his voice, that is, he can perform delicate operations
like overturning tables and breaking chandeliers.

HOMER A. WILSON, <I>P2

Ohio State University.
Glee Club.

Another benedict. The possessor of a liquid eye
and an olive skin. Homer has a decided taste for
study, but we imagine that wifey’s presence has a
decided inﬂuence on this taste.

PHILLIP ZINK,

German University.

Phillip has been refined by distillation. A German
with German expressions. His German may be
ﬂawless, but his English~Ach, Gott; Zink wanted
to be a minister, but reached the conclusion that he
ought to minister to the sick as an allopath rather than
as a sky pilot.

ROBERT BINI-IAM BLACK, ~14?

Slippery Rock State Normal.
Class Treasurer.

Black says the hardest thing about getting married is eating
your wife's cooking. There may be more truth than fiction in
his statement, but how does he know? Explanation due.
Displays good sense in class meetings and believes in having a
system in everything. Inclined to be ambitious and can get
very active when asked to describe anything in connection with
the Oral Cavity.

CARL CLIFFORD BOARTS, ‘I42
Emleton High School.

The most important member of the class and the pride of
Kittanning. Always willing to help a Freshie and has a ten-
dency to pick up other people’s work and correct (.9) it. Some-
times he “ﬁxes" things to such an extent that you feel more
than thankful toward him. That's alright, Boarts, we know
your heart is in the right place. Are there any more at home
like you?

MELVIN FROST BROADWATER, \II(2

St. John's College.
Cap and Gown Club.
Varsity Foot-ball '09.

This tall, stately, comely young fellow comes from Maryland.
Walks with a military stride due to having spent two years at
St. John's Military College. Broddie devotes his time to study
when there is nothing more important to be attended to.

RODERICK ROBERT BRYAN, \IIS2

Shadyside Academy.
Captain and Manager Class Foot-ball.

Known among the fair sex as “Roddie." It is understood
that he is some fusser and no one knows how many hearts he
has dangling from his belt. Is a star performer on the Olympic
Foot-ball team and sparring partner of Jack Abbott. Honest,
he is better looking than this picture. Comes from Duquesne,
but his many good points more than balances this one fault.

S. ERNEST T. CALHOUN, \II(2

Westminster College.

Class President.

Athletic representative from Dent. Department.
Class Foot-ball.

A direct descendent of John C. Calhoun and like his ancestor,
is noted for his forcible logic and earnest manner. That is why
we all like him. Is the president of our class and athletic repre-
sentative from our Dept. Decided blonde and responds to
“ Coonic.” Has only one fault, he don’t like the Dutch.

PAUL NATHAN CARLISLE, \I/Q

Allegheny High School.
Cap and Gown Club.

“ A wise son maketh a glad father.” Paul is a quiet fellow and
well liked by all who know him. Is bound to make good as a
dentist and has an idea that he won't be a single man all his life.
We hope not.

JOSEPH AUGUSTUS CHRISTY,

Secretary Freshman Class '09, '10.
Class Foot—ba11.

A good student who is in school for business, but likes to have

disposition, likes a joke, also the ladies. If there is any place
Joe likes better than Irwin, it is Indiana. She lives there.
More power to you, may you live long and be happy.

SHERMAN OSCAR HUFFMAN, ‘I'D
Class Foot-ball.

A very studious fellow who answers to the name of "Artie.”
Always present when the roll is taken and wears a decided pro-
fessional air. Makes frequent trips to Duquesne but says he
don't like the town. Why does he go? We know, but we won't
tell. Has only one fault. He hates the Irish.

ROSS RICHARD FEIGHTNER, \IIﬂ

Greensburg High School.
Cap and Gown Club.
Varsity Foot-ball '09, '10.

“Don't ﬂinch, don't foul, but hit the line hard.” That's
Teddy.’ We always knew he was good man, but State didn't
ﬁnd it out till last Thanksgiving Afternoon. They know it
now. Married and happy. Has a brand new “benzine buggy”
and when he gets out in it he makes them all sit up and take
notice. Oh you Teddy! How could we get along without you.

WILLIAM ALONZO FREDERICK,

Indiana Normal.

Comes from Parnassus (where ever that is) and can't eat
peas, ’cause they roll off his knife. A bosom friend of Hunkers
and has hopes of being the leading man in Parnassus a few
years hence. Made one trip to the Expo Skating Rink and put
a pair of those “ding busted” roller skates on. Never again!
They are too much for William Alonzo.

RALPI-I MAURICE GALVIN,

New Brighton High School.
Cap and Gown Clu .
Foot-ball and Track Varsity.

Honorable‘ mention for “Po1ly.” Not only a star football
player but an active member of the track team, a leading man
in the Cap and Gown Club and a good student. As an athlete
he has proven his worth in every contest and brought many
honors to our University. Is big enough to take Care of himself.

HAROLD WALTER GAMBLE, AEA

McKeesport High School.
Cap and Gown Club.
Class Foot-ball.

A healthy, well groomed, good looking son of McKeesport.
Always blushes when he comes into class late and blushes again
when called on in class. A general favorite among the ladies
and would rather go to a dance than study Anatomy. Who
wouldn’t? Made a solemn vow never again to be caught talking
in class.

JAMES D. GERNON. \IIS2
Mansﬁeld State Normal.

Joined our class last fall and has proven to be a good square
fellow. Is destined to die with delirium tremors in a drug
store in Kansas City. Too bad, Gernon, we believe you were
hastily judged and feel that the class would be much improved
if we had more like you.

WALTER WRIGHT HINCHMAN, ASA

President Freshman Class '09, '10.
Football, '09, '10

“The best part of beauty is that which a picture cannot
express." Hinchman is one of our foot-ball players and wears a
“P” on his chest, of which he is justly proud. Is not quite as
large as “Polly” but can cast a good size shadow. Takes
numerous short vacations, but always reports once a week.

GEORGE EDGAR HUNKER,

Greensburg Seminary

The one shining light from Hunkerville, that town in West-
moreland Co., where dogs don't bark at strangers. Dr. McCurdy
once said “hopeless case,” but George Edgar has made rapid
strides since then and expects to some day be the leading dentist
of his home town.

CHARLES McKEE JAMESON, ‘I10

North Washington Institute.
Class Vice President.
Dental Business Manager of Owl.

“Chuck" is truly a friend of all the boys. Always in a good
humor and ever ready to do a good turn for a fellow student.
Says it is better to have studied and “ﬂunked " than not to have
studied at all. No danger of him ﬂunking, he didn't come here
to do that, he is here for business and is not idling away any of
his valuable time.

LEWIS STANLEY MARKELL, \II(Z

Monongahela High School '04.
Cap and Gown Club.
Class Foot-ball.

The only man in the University who has never been in a “hot
air" contest. Is staying in Wilkinsburg this year so he won’t
have to travel on the train with “Roddie and Pierce.” (Can't
blame him.) No rough-house complete without “Stack," but
he is always on hand at his classes and right up to the minute

in the Exams. Wish we had more like him.

SADIE N. MARKOWITZ,

The only girl in the class. Always pleasant, ready to smile,
and commanding the respect of all. Miss Markowitz is indeed
a credit to the class. A hard worker and with her winning ways
is certainly destined to make a grand success in dentistry. I

MICHAEL ROBERT MANDELSTEIN,
South Fork High School.

A Hebrew detective disguised as a Jew. Spends his summers
in South Fork, Pa., where he some day hopes to be a real dentist.
Always in a good humor and has a red headed girl. Very fond
of chicken, but don't care much for pork.

CLARENCE MISHAEL MORGAN,
Cadiz, Ohio, High School.

A younger member of the class and a real shining light from
Ohio. Has Visions of being a real dentist, some day, with a real
oﬂice and real patients to work on. Says one patient in the office
is worth two on the street. Very fond of the ladies and some day
hopes to have a girl of his own. We hope so, Morgan, and wish
youall the luck in the world.

HOWARD ALEX MCKENSIE, AEA
Woodward High School.

The pride of Houtsdale. During his Freshman year we had
hopes of Alex being a great dentist some day in the distant
future. But we lost faith in him this fall when we saw him
using blue-pipe. Is slowly drifting toward the bald headed row.
Don't worry, Alex, she will wait. Too bad she lives so far
away.

BERT W. POLLIM,
Class Foot—ball.

“It is better to get wisdom than a wife." Bert is a big fellow
with a quiet disposition and liked by all who know him. Is
continually putting knowledge in his well supplied store house.
A first class workman in anything except where a blowpipe
must be used, but under the careful direction of McKenzie is
rapidly becoming an expert with it.

PERCY DIGBY POLLOCK,

Charleroi High School.

Cap and Gown Club.

Secretary of Junior Class.

Class Foot-ball and Fresh Base—ball.

Percy is a star base-ball player and the one great ground
gainer on the class foot-ball team. We're proud of you. Comes
from Charleroi, but so does Tener. Associates with Bryan, but
so does Christy. Tells large stories, but so does Markell. Good
looking but so is Boarts. Has a girl, but so has Tibbott. Hard
worker, but so is Washabaugh. Otherwise. he is a pretty good
fellow.

JOHN HASSLER PRUGH, JR., ~14?

Mercersburg Academy.

The original village cut-up. If you know him you like him,
if you don't know him you like him better. Enjoys a little fun
in the smoking-room now and then—most1y now. Can look
very serious on necessary occasions but at all other times Jack
wears a smile that just won’t come off.

EDWARD C. SHRYOCK, ‘I10

Indiana State Normal.
Cap and Gown Club.
Dental Editor 1912 Owl.
Class Foot-ball.

Here we have him, Edward the Editor. On him you can
blame all mistakes, all ﬁzzles, all everything that’s wrong. But
don't blame him too hard. « Remember you never were an
editor yourself. The writer of this you don't know, but he knows
Shryock and he knows him to be a man in every sense of the
word; and a man whose word can be believed. If all the editors
were like Shryock, the Editor-in-Chief would have an easy
time.

CARL G. SORGEN,

Kenton High School.
Cap and Gown Club.

One man who does not bother his head about the fair sex.
Right up to the minute in his classes and will no doubt make a
grand success as a dentist. We all like him because he is fat.

JOHN THOMAS STOCKDALE,

Waynesburg Business College '04.
Waynesburg College.

A man who studies hard and neglects the girls, is therefore
making good in his studies. Expects to some day be a great
dentist and one of the leading men in Greene County. May he
live long and stay single.

JOHN ALTON TIBBOT, \II9

Indiana Normal.
Class Foot-ball.

Lives in Wilkinsburg, but has a tender spot in his heart for
Verona. Why?—Guess. John Alton makes his regular week
end trip to Verona regardless of the weather conditions. It
would take more than the weather man to stop him. Goes to
the Family Theatre when he wants to have a good laugh and,
believe me, he is an artist when it comes to laughing.

ELMER WEGER, AEA

Allegheny High School.
Varsity Base-ball, Basket-ball, Track.

Known to his friends and classmates as “Lefty.” Is a fast
man (on cinder path). Shines in base-ball, basket-ball and on
the track team. Studied medicine a couple of years and then
decided to be a dentist. Here's hoping he proves as much of a
success in dentistry as he has in Athletic Sports.

RAYMOND P. WHITE, AEA
Edinboro State Normal.

Married and happy. May his troubles all be little ones?
Expects to some day be a D. D. S. and have a nice large brass
cuspidor placed in close proximity to his operating chair. Always
has a chew in his oral cavity. That's what makes him fat.

FRANCIS D. TYLER, we

Jamestown High School.

Cap and Gown Club.

Pitt Weekly.

Vice President Freshman Class ‘O9, '10.

A man of many accomplishments. Very fond of music and
dancing. but pleads “Not Guilty” when accused of being a
ladies’ man. Has an assortment of high voltage adjectives and
is an earnest student with no bad habits. He will undoubedtly
make good.

CHARLES BENTON PIPES, \1I9

Waynesburg Academy.
Class Foot-ball.

A mighty good fellow, but a little backward. Much to his
credit he has a tendency to shy at the fair sex, but under the
careful teaching of certain of his class mates he is gradually
growing bolder and at the present writing is doing very nicely.
“Bud" is a good student and will, no doubt, be a great dentist
some day.

JAMES ALONZO REESE,

Waynesburg High School, '07.
Waynesburg College.

James Alonzo comes from Waynesburg and if he continues to
ask questions and progress as rapidly in his Senior year as he
has in his Freshman and Junior years we shall expect great
things from him when he ﬁnally hangs out his shingle. Says
the only way to learn is by studying and asking questions.
Oh such simple questions! Question No. 1: What is black
coffee? N o. 2: Do they get musk from musk rats, etc.? Solid
Ivory.

SAMUEL COUGER BROWN,

A cute little fellow who thinks good goods are put up in small
packages. We believe the rule don’t hold good in his case.
Very active in the smoking room and can throw anything from
a pea to a doughnut with unerring accuracy. Very fond of
the ladies, and an active member of the Y. M. C. A.

BERTHIL M. LINDLE, \IIQ

A skinny little fellow who left home, friends, and the Uni-
versity of Illinois to come to Pitt. 7 We are glad he did for he
is good fellow and liked by all who_know him. Likes Pittsburgh
better every day and admits that he prefers girls to study.
Guaranteed under the Pure Food and Drug Act, Serial 23.
“Come on fellows, I'm wid you.”

KELLEY HOLMES PRICE, AEA
Class Foot-ball.

Blowed in on us from Ohio and immediately attained a danger-
ous reputation due to his eﬁciency asa rough-house artist, but
he is a good steady reliable fellow and we are glad we have him.
Morgan says he has a girl back in Ohio some place. Come on,
“Red,” fess up.

GEORGE ALBIN WASHABAUGH,

Grove City High School.
Grove City College.
Class Foot-ball.

Responds to a number of aliases, “Washie,” “Wabash,"
“Washtub," etc. Is a very bright fellow but gets home—sick
when he goes in the Prothetic—Laboratory. Probably he can't
stand the smell of the plaster. A ﬁrm believer in the freedom
of speech. Very gallant in the presence of ladies and hopes to
some day be a captain in the Salvation Army. Very handsome
and attractive. Nuf Ced.

FRANK HUSTON ECKLES.

Frankie’s abilities border closely on the miraculous:
He is the only man known to be able to perform the
duties incident to daily employment in the evening
while taking an Evening University Course.

C. EDWARD MOOL.

Yes, we saw Edward at the smoker. When asked
if he were at the smoker, he replied~Yes, very much.
Eddie is another of the fortunate ones who says:
“Now, life's greatest task is accomplished and I’m
ready.”

CHARLES DANIEL WETTACH,
President E. S. A., 1911).

The best Toastmaster yet. And the best President
we have had this year. It is with regret that we
think of him as a Senior. All would like to have
more of Wettach. But, good things come high and
don't last long.

CLARENCE THOMAS SLOAN.

Now watch the Pennsy grow. Clarence has always
had a too poor opinion of himself. Insists that honors
should come unsought and voluntarily. Tried to
serve his class too well, which deprived him of useful
time for regular study.

ROBERT PARKER SIMONS,

Chairman Executive Committee, '10.

One more numbered with the fortunate. It is
certainly gratifying to see the conﬁdent air and stride
of the Senior. Robert goes out with a fund of know-
ledge and information that few attain in so short :1
time. May blessings attend him.

HAROLD ALBERT BOSSART.

A typical delinquent, but back in the ring. Says he has been
busy auditing and systematizing and that his subordinates will
be able to carry out for the remainder of the school term the
work he has begun. His accuracy of speech, his gentle manner
and long shining locks of black hair, make him a welcome addi-
tion. Has a beautiful baritone voice for which he receives a
fat salary. His only bad feature is his facial expression when
taking notes.

IRVIN A. BRINKMAN.

Baltimore Polytechnic Institute.
Chairman Membership Committee E. S. A.

Always conspicuous by his absence. Never came to class
unnoticed. Is like a thunderstorm—a1ways comes with a loud
noise. Always sees the point and takes exception to same.
His highest ambition is a Receiving Clerk. It is hoped that
college inspiration will attack him and elevate his ideals to
something attainable. “Brink" has ability and only needs a
steady nerve. Will some one kindly contribute?

ARTHUR LAWRENCE BROCKWAY.
Pittsburgh High School.

Arthur has great oratorical ability. He has delivered some
of the greatest labor speeches ever heard in Pittsburgh. Public
recognition of his talent came late in life, and any one may see
without a microscope that he is a ful1—ﬂe.dged member of the
Front Row Club. He-.has a reputation among his friends for
being a safe repository for jewelry, and has never been known
to sleep with his shoes on. Has never ﬂunked in school, as he
always cuts the exams.

JAMES EDWARD CLUNE.

This fellow is one of the greatest of present-day magicians.
He might well be called Hermann. The only living man who
ever removed his waistcoat without first removing his coat.
Aside from this “stunt" of his, he cares nothing for Vaudeville,
as he has been known to fall asleep at the Grand, having to be
awakened by the attendants. _]im’s one ambition is to be a
coal baron, but, if he is as barren of coal as he is of cash, all of
us are liable to freeze to death. But, with all his faults, we love
him still.

JOHN STANTON FLECK.

A man of wide experience in the Railroad business. Knows
the exact freight rate and passenger rate between any two points
in the U. S., Canada and South America. John wears a hand-
some smile, and is a genuine good fellow. Felt highly exalted
when he learned that the University could not teach him any-
thing about Transportation. (The University is not giving the
course this year.)

ALEXANDER DICKSON FRASER.

Park Institute.

Of course, he is a good scout, even though he has political
ambition and wants to be Justice of the Peace in Bellevue.
While preparing for this, he is eking out an existence as Pitts-
burg Manager for the Salt Lake & San Pedro R. R. Co. He is
a great traveler, having been to nearly all the suburbs of Pitts-
burg. An assiduous student of Law and Economics, but has
no use for money except to spend it for Pollock Experts.

GRIFFITH LLOYD.

Grifﬁe has a ﬁne tenor voice for calling cows. Made a big
hit with it at the smoker. Is usually a peaceful citizen, but oc-
casionally becomes enmeshed in the toils of law. Just the same,
we like the cigars he passes around. We strongly suspect that
he will join the ranks of the benedicts in the near future. Very
particular about his personal appearance, which is evidenced by
his well manicured nails.

JOSEPH MOORE.

Having found his vocation, we think he must have also an
interesting avocation, as he seems to have but a limited time to
apply to his studies here. Thinks twice and speaks once always.
A friend of Orr, and must be a pretty hard proposition. Does
most of his talking at home. Never was seen out after dark,
and is thought to be in all a very good boy. Distinguished him-
self last year as the only thorough master of the Negotiable
Instruments Act.

RICHARD OWEN.

A man of many trades——Auditor, Systematizer, Plumber.
Tinner—a talented bass singer, and is a scientiﬁc authority on
all branches of Accountancy and Investments. The man who
wrote the “Knocker” at the smoker. Doesn’t attend very
regularly, but always knows the “dope" and gets there just the
same. Writes a beautiful hand when he doesn’t have to think.
Always returns his Accounting papers in “classy" form. Dick
has the bearing and would make a good Boss.

JOHN MICHAEL SCANLON.
Mt. St. Joseph's College.

A lady‘s man from start to finish, his preference being nurses.
A great dancer, but ﬁnds it hard to hang on to his personal
belongings while so engaged. He is a writer of after-dinner
speeches and a prominent member of several clubs, being prone
to boast of his social position on all occasions. Is a good mixer
but rather careless of where he mixes. Information on invest-
ment securities cheerfully furnished.

ARTHUR EGERTON SIXSMITH.

A year in school has convinced Arthur that the only way to
get rich quick is to raise alligators. Has purchased a swamp in
Florida and will soon answer the call of Back to the Soil. It is
certain that all of his alligators will like Arthur's genial dis-
position and constant smile. Will shortly move his family in to
a house—boat on his farm. He is a law student of the ﬁrst order.
A n authority on journal entries in opening books of corporations

CHARLES CYRUS SHEPPARD.‘

Editor Owl, 1912.
Pittsburgh High School.
Park Institute. '05.

A stove merchant and a warm one at that. He has VVebster
backed off the boards when it comes to using the English language.
It has been stated upon authority that a liquid smoke is the
foundation of his inspirations. He never misses a night and is
always on deck. He ﬁgures that he will not let the University
beat him out of anything he has paid for. He thinks he gets
his money's worth.

ERICH A. THIELE.

Business Manager Owl, 1912.
Wanwatosa High School, Wanwatosa, Wis.
Carnegie Technical School.

Erich (better known as Thiele), is always “Johnnie on the
Spot.” An enthusiastic hustler who always makes good in any
line, especially electric lines. He wears the smile that won't
come off. Is known somewhat for radicalism, but he always
brings out the point, great or small. He never had any book-
keeping in his life, but can do Accounting just the same. Says
Accounting I is easy, and is sorry that he didn't take Accounting
11 at the same time. Has out—1ived his Freshman sobriquet.

ROBERT W. MATTHEWS.

Allegheny High School, '03.
Secretary E. S. A.. ’10.

Almost too nice to say “darn." A ladies’ man for fair. He
has been a devotee of dancing since his early childhood days.
This explains why he is not tall, as he has danced off as much
below as he grew on top. He has worn his hair short with much
brushing, and soon it will be a thing of the past altogether.
Takes long notes in shorthand and has a vocabulary greater than
Webster's, and never misuses a word.

HENRY HOLDSHIP MARTINDALE.
Pittsburgh High School.

Recently heard the call back to the soil, and bought an orange
grove in Florida——a dollar down and a dollar a week. Has
moved to the rural districts in order to take a practical course
in soil-tilling. Is now in the market for a blue cow, some guinea
pigs and mules. We cannot understand how a man of his per-
sonal appearance, social standing and ﬁnancial ability could
content himself on a farm. A few of his accomplishments are
playing a mandolin, singing with his mouth, wearing his hair
pompadour and paddling a canoe.

WILLIAM M. BAECHTEL

john D's right-hand man in Pittsburgh. Father
Time dealt only a kindly blow, as evidenced by his
snowy—white locks yet youthful expression. William
has his ﬂock of Sabbath School children, who greatly
enjoy his story telling. He speaks in class only
when pressed. Economics is his/hobby, but cannot
see why we should suffer from having too much gold.
Is thought to be compiling information for a book;
says it is never too late to learn.

NORMAN BANKS.

Always late but never can tell why. Leaves early
and unceremoniously. Is thought to have some dark
secret in his life. Has often been approached on the
subject, but each attempt proved futile. His great-
est accomplishments are his superior knowledge of
Economics and Law. Studied economics to know how
to buy necessary commodities cheapest, and law to
know to legally evade payment.

JAMES LEROY COX.

A genuinely qualiﬁed Accountant. Frequently re-
fuses audits for the Standard Oil Company. His
specialty is Nominal and Effective Rates. Reputed
to be negotiating with Pennsylvania Railroad Com-
pany. Has a pink complexion. His wife says he is
the prettiest boy she ever saw. Once started a revolu-
tion, but his recruits did not “ﬁgure long enough”
for him. Has amania for stocks and bonds. Always
knows more than he can tell. Returns his accounting
papers in book form. Has an exalted opinion of
himself, like all other experts.

LEWIS PAUL COLLINS

A perfect gentleman all the way through, and knows
how to play the part. The only Assistant Professor
of the class; an expert in logarithms, he uses them
for all simple problems in multiplication, addition and
subtraction, doesn’t know how to use them in ﬁgur-
ing Bond valuations yet, but thinks he will soon.
Never was approached on a subject that he was not
able to quote authoritative decisions upon. Has one
original idea, but has never made it known.

AUGUST HILLER.

Neither space nor time will permit of suﬂicient
description. Was once known to execute an order given
by one of our largest Audit Companies for the auditing
of all coal companies in Pennsylvania, Ohio, West
Virginia, Michigan and Illinois. Has a reputation
for exposing grafters. His specialty is Systematizing;
Installed a system for retail shoe dealer. Is a
thorough Accountant, but has a mania for imposing

I the fact. Aside from the foregoing, August is a good

scout.

ALLAN BURT MASON.

A genuine blue-eyed blonde. He says he believes
in having more than one trade, which accounts for his
hard and untiring study. Says there are not many
Masons who are able to foretell Financial and Eco-
nomic Crises and Depressions, to plead their own law
suits and keep and audit their own books, and know
where to invest their surplus earnings in securities
to yield a net proﬁt of 10 to 12 per cent. Not very
loquacious but has an answer.

JOSEPH THOMAS MURRAY.

The man who makes things come his way. Is an
inﬂuential member of many Clubs and Society Circles.
Needs no introduction, as he has attained great fame
as a writer. He writes short stories and editorials
for the leading Newspapers and Magazines. Watch
for the next issue of Nick Carter. Has a weakness
for late hours, and this practice sometimes incapaci-
tates him for his highest eﬁiciency. Joe was away
for a year, but like the cat, “he came back.”

WILBUR WALTER NOBLE.

Of course it would be bad form and show disrespect
and poor culture to say anything igNoble. But, Walt,
we must say, has a weakness for the Gaiety this year.
It is indeed a shame that a young man with his intel-
lectual possibilities, his handsome hair (so well kept),
his rosy cheeks, and velvet complexion, should not
take advantage of the golden hours of opportunity.
This is all about the Accounting Course. In Money
and Banking he is better than the best. Always gets
AA or 200 per cent.

HAROLD RAYMOND ORR.

A handsome boy with fair skin and large, brown
soft-boiled eyes. Orr is too modest and has not yet
found his real worth. We predict great things for
him, if he isn’t led more (Moore) astray than he has
been. The only fault we ﬁnd with him is that he
comes from Braddock, where he received his early edu-
cation in the tube works.

FRED. OTTMAN.

Doesn’t care if he is old. Knows he knows It, and
that is gratiﬁcation enough for any possible deﬁ-
ciency. Never was asked but one question he couldn’t
answer. However, he is not affected, as one might
think. Time and experience has done its work in
moulding a kind, thoughtful and gentle disposition.
Smiles rarely, but always one near the surface.
Knows all about Stocks and Bonds; also Fiduciary
Accounts and Sinking Funds. He really should have
been a Rural Minister.

HENRY WARREN RANO.

Knows a little bit of everything, but not a great
deal of anything. His erect carriage and ultra-
dignity comes from a compulsory force of habit of
long standing. Is gifted with an overdose of sarcasm,
which comes to the surface greatly modiﬁed because
of its having to pass through a strictly cultured
process. Never tackled but one proposition that he
was unable to master; That was Article 171. Smiled
once.

H. IVAN SLOAN.

Ivan says it is well worth all it costs to receive a
University education, but says it's hard to remember it
all at once. Doesn't say much but keeps “plugging.”
He will only have one study next year and he says
that looks good to him.

WILLIAM STANBOROUGH SUTTON.
Shadyside Academy.

Oh, what beautiful hair he has. One can only
imagine what he will look like when it is gone. Is a
fellow of great learning. Worked in a bank but left
it shortly before the graft investigation to enter the
ﬁeld of Real Estate. Is not known to be socially
inclined, but then he doesn't believe in blowing his
head off every time he opens his mouth.

WILLIAM WRIGHT.
Gordon's College, Aberdeen, Scotland.

Wright here is the bonnie lad from the Scotch High-
lands, who wore kilties in his youth and bravely
marched with bared limbs through the streets of Aber-
deen, shivering in the cold blasts for the love of good
Queen Vic. He has become thoroughly domesticated
and is quite harmless now, but he must have been
a ﬁghter in his boyhood days. Billy has the stuff, and
we welcome him to our shores.

HISTORY  

HE sturdy pioneers who crossed the Allegheny Mountains and settled with their families

in the wilderness at the forks of the Ohio had all the characteristics which have made

the Anglo—Saxon people a race of conquerors. Chief among these characteristics was
the knowledge that “the education of the youth ought to be a primary object of every govern-
ment.” As early as 1770 a school was established, which in 1787 was formally incorporated as
Pittsburgh Academy.

Under able instructors the Academy ﬂourished, and by 1819 had grown to such an extent as
to justify the application for a new charter. This was granted and the name was changed to “The
Western University of Pennsylvania.” The curriculum was enlarged and the school entered upon
its career as an institution of higher learning.

The ﬁrst faculty consisted of Dr. Robert Bruce, Dr. John Black, Dr. E. P. Swift, Dr. Joseph
McElroy, and Rev. Charles B. Maguire. Here were Romanist, Presbyterian, Reformed and
Associate Presbyterian, working together at a time when feeling between the rival denomination
was intense. As to the student body the same generosity of sentiment prevailed; there was to
be no respect of creed or color.

During the administration of Dr. Bruce, the University attained a place for itself among
the institutions of higher learning.

The administration of Rev. Herman Dyer, from 1843 to 1849, was marked by two disas-
trous ﬁres, one in r 84 5 and one in 1 849. This double loss resulted in the suspension of work until 1 8 5 5.

SENIOR CLASS OF THE SCHOOL OF ENGINEERING

ATHLETICS

ATHLETIC HISTORY

HE remarkable success attained by the representatives of the University of Pittsburgh on the athletic ﬁeld
during the year of 1910 marks the high-tide of athletic activity at this institution. Until a few years ago
athletics in Pittsburgh were unorganized and the teams were unworthy to represent an institution of higher

learning. Now and then some team would have a brilliant season, as did the base-ball teams from 1888 to 1894. B11t
these successes were the result either of one man's ability as an organizer or of the use of methods which would be
frowned upon in College circles today.

During these years the only organization was that maintained by student enthusiasm. The period of 1892-
1896 was known as the “Golden Age” of our athletics. But the success was due to an unusual number of good
athletes in school at that time, and not to any system or support. When the stars graduated the standard of our
teams fell, until in 1897 the varsity teams would have hardly brought credit to a prep school.

It was at this time that Chancellor Holland recognized the need of organization and faculty supervision
and advice. The advisory board comprised James E. McKirdy, Walther Riddle, Harry S. Calvert, Edward E-
Mayer and Clifford C. Connelly. Hoskins of State, and Trenchard of Princeton served as foot—ball coachers. In
1904 a number of enthusiastic Alumni took up the General Athletic Committee and arranged for a foot-ball coach
and training table, and a schedule that put Pitt on the athletic map. Since that time the organization has been per-
fect, the student enthusiasm has been enlisted, and steady progress has been the result.

The latest improvement has been the installation of the graduate coaching system. Joseph H. Thompson
has proved to be the right man in the right place, as championships in foot—ball and track go to prove. Joe has de-
veloped a "Pitt system," one that will place the University of Pittsburg among the great names in intercollegiate
sports.

HAT foot—ball in the University of Pittsburgh in 1910 was an unqualiﬁed success is everywhere recognized.

I But how could it have been otherwise when the team had Joe Thompson as coach, Tex Richards as

captain, ten of last year's letter men, and an abundance of new material? With these men Joe set to work

to build up a team worthy of the hearty support of the student body. That he succeeded cannot be denied.

However, it was not to the ability of any one individual that this success was due, but rather to the team as a

whole. There was not a quitter on the squad, every man throughout the entire season displaying a vim and daring
seldom witnessed in any sport.

This was a team of brain as well as brawn. In consequence it was able to win nine straight victories, scoring
in all 282 points, and yet keeping its own goal line uncrossed. At that Pitt did not have to exert herself to any great
degree. Had it been necessary, many more points could have been scored.

The Penn State game also gladdened the hearts of all loyal Pitt followers. This victory, 11 to 0, which was
cleaner than the one of Old Penn against State 10-0. has urged some enthusiasts to lay claim to the Championship
of the state. This claim seems all the more reasonable when it is considered that Pitt defeated West Virginia by a
larger score than did Penn.

Early practise was started upon Schenley Oval. From a mere handful of men the squad grew daily till there
were about 40 candidates. Of last year's letter men there were Captain Tex Richards, Galvin, Lindsey, Dewar,
Budd, Bailey, Quaily, Stevenson, Blair, and Peacock. Also from last year were Butler, Hichman, Gehlert, Dave

Richards, and Feightner. Among the new material appeared Dallenbach, Hittner, Brown, Wagner, Rosenbloom,
Reid, Ashe, Cummings, etc.

   -::::::With the establishment of training quarters at 3307 Fifth Avenue, work began in earnest. Gradually order
came out of chaos. Every man, both old and new, had to be broken of habits of play no longer allowable under
the new rules. In the great task of rounding the team into shape “Joe ” was aided by Ralph Rose, Alex. Stevenson,
and Doc Van Doren.

The ﬁrst two games, those with Ohio Northern and Westminster, were played at D. C. & A. C. park, Wilkins-
burg. The Ohio Northern game was quite an interesting one since it was the ﬁrst trial of the new rules in Pittsburgh.
No plays of particular interest were pulled off.‘ Pitt won, 36 to 0. ‘

“JOE” THOMPSON

Ashton and Mansell by their great defensive work were mainly responsible for the low score of 18 to 0 in the
Westminster game. The New Wilmington boys fought every inch of the ground but were entirely out-classed.

The following Saturday Waynesburg fell an easy victim to the Blue and Gold in a listless and onesided game.
The scrubs did most of the playing, the varsity merely taking their daily exercise. Wagner scored in about two
and one-half minutes after play started and about ﬁve minutes later Galvin followed, crossing the line for the second

 

touchdown. Lindsey played a good fast game and succeeded in throwing Lippenscot for a safety. Clean, clever work‘

had its reward in a score of 42 to 0.

Georgetown, the ﬁrst large team to meet Pitt, proved no match for Thompson's powerful foot-ball machine
and was defeated by a score of 17 to 0. Fury was the star for the visitors and at one time made a heroic but

unsuccessful attempt to score. lntercepting a forward pass, he started toward the goal with a clear ﬁeld. The Pitt
rooters were speechless. Suddenly a mighty shout burst from the student bleachers. Fury had been tackled by Tex
Richards, had fumbled the ball and now Tex was going down the ﬁeld with the pig-skin safely tucked under his
arm. This was the only time that Georgetown had a chance to score, in fact, it represented practically all the
ground gained by the visitors.

Galvin played a brilliant game scoring two ﬁeld goals from the 27 and 33 yard lines respectively. Hittner
was good on the defense, but it was Dewar who completely bafﬂed the visitors with his heady and aggressive style
of play. Richards was his old self and made good gains through the hole opened in the line by Dallenbach and Blair
and Stevenson, and on several occasions worked clever forward passes with Lindsey. Bailey played a star game,
blocking kicks and tackling being his specialty.

October 29th~To be remembered as the day a team from Athens, Ohio, tried to play foot-ball. The so
called Ohio University squad was completely smothered beneath the weight of 71 points. The scrubs played bril-
liantly. The one result of this game was to boost the total points scored.

One week later West Virginia was given a severe drubbing by a score of 28 to 0. Capt. Tex stepped once more
in the limelight and capped the climax of a strenuous exhibition of foot-ball ability by a phenomenal tackle of Thomp-
son of West Virginia. The little quarter in some manner eluding the ends sped toward the goal, closely guarded
by three husky team mates. It seemed impossible for him to be stopped. Captain Richards did stop him, though,
and stopped him hard. A mighty shout of relief greeted the play. This, with a subsequent try for a ﬁeld goal,
were the only chances the mountaineers had to score. The game was highly spectacular, even though the visitors
were out—classed. They fought gamely from start to ﬁnish in a futile attempt to stop the ﬁerce onslaught and

In 18 55 work was resumed in the new building erected at the corner of Ross and Diamond
streets. Rev. John F. McLaren, D. D., was inducted into office as principal, the student body
increased rapidly, and the prospects of the University were never brighter.

Under‘ Dr. George Woods, who was made principal in 18 58, the University progressed rap-
idly. During his administration a period of material expansion was enjoyed. In 1871 the ﬁrst
permanent endowment, a sum of $100,000, was received through the generosity of William Thaw.
The people of Pittsburg contributed a like sum. In 1872 the powers of the University were
enlarged by the Legislature. It was given the right to take and administer property.

During Dr. Woods’ administration the character and extent of the work was greatly en-
larged. A Preparatory Department was established, but later discontinued. In 1862, instruction
in military tactics was added to the course. This was continued until 1882. Eminent men were
added to the faculty, among them being Professor Francis C. Phillips, who at present occupies
the chair of chemistry.

The administration of Dr. Henry M. McCracken, who succeeded Dr. Woods in 1880, was a
period of discouraging conditions. The University buildings were sold to Allegheny County for
use as a court house while a new ediﬁce was being built. The College was moved into rented quar¥
ters on North Avenue, where work was carried on amid many disadvantages. Prof. Daniel Carhart,
who became a member of the faculty at this time, reorganized and greatly enlarged the courses in
engineering.

From 1884 to 1890, Milton B. Goff was Chancellor. During his incumbency, the buildings
on Observatory Hill were completed and occupied. A new and advanced curriculum was adopted,
which provided for larger labratories for the departments of Chemistry and Engineering.

whirlwind dashes of their stronger opponents. Coach Morrow of W. & J. and the entire Red and Black squad, and
Coach Hollenbach and a delegation from Penn State, were at the game, but failed to see a single new play
uncovered.

The following week was full of activities for the squad. Secret practice was instituted in order to work out
a few plays “Joe ” had up his sleeve. Although certain of a victory over W. & ]., nothing was to be left to chance.
It is true the Red and Black were very weak in the opening of the season but they had gradually gained strength
until it is safe to say they met Pitt with as strong an aggregation as ever represented the institution.

The day dawned raw and wet. At intervals throughout the morning and afternoon it rained and snowed
transforming the ﬁeld into a sea of mud. The extreme inclemency of the weather, however, did not allay the en-
thusiasm. Almost the entire student bodies of the two schools were present, each with a brass band and an assort-
ment of specially composed yells. “ Doty” Storey, the W. & J. contortionist. was on the ﬁring line for the visitors,
while George Kirk led the Blue and Gold enthusiasts, assisted by Scott and Campbell. As the two teams advanced
upon the ﬁeld, cheer after cheer ﬁlled the air; rival bands struck up familiar tunes, and soon the buoyant strains of
“Hail to Pitt" were sent across the ﬁeld, sung by a thousand students.

Galvin started the game by kicking to Whitehill, who was downed almost before he could move. Then
followed a 15 minute kicking contest between Richards and Forsythe, in which Tex took the honors. Pitt started
at the whistle in the second quarter and succeeded in piercing the opposing line in a series of plunges. The ball

was carried to the 5 yard line where it was lost on downs. W. & J. punted out to Dewar, who made a free catch.
Then Galvin tried for a placement kick but missed by a narrow margin. Play was resumed on the visitors’ 25 yard
line. Shortly after, Dewar made a 30 yard run; Tex carried it to the 3 yard line, and “Tillie" made the touchdown.
Galvin failed to kick the goal and in a few minutes the quarter ended, Pitt 5. W. & J. O. ‘

Galvin kicked the ball to Wallace, who was stopped by Hittner. Brown and Richards tore through large
holes made in the line by Pitt's husky linemen and succeeded in carrying the ball far into W. & J. territory, giving
Galvin a chance for a successful ﬁeld goal. This sort of stunned the Red and Black eleven, but they came back
in the last period with increased determination. Gchlert and Grim had been substituted for Bailey and Forsythe,

who had been retired for embracing each other too strenuously. After about 10 minutes of punting and plunging,
Budd, who was playing a good game at quarter, placed the ball upon the 3 yard line, Tex hit center for another touch-
down and Galvin added the extra point, raising the ﬁnal score to Pitt 14, W. & J. 0.

The following Saturday, Pitt, minus the services of Captain Richards, Hittner and Dallenbach, easily shut
out Carnegie Tech in an interesting game. Wagner, Quailey and Gehlert were substituted, and played in excellent
style. In the ﬁrst quarter the Plaid held together fairly well and at one time it looked as though an accident was
about to spoil the Gold and Blue's clean score tablet. The calamity, however, was avoided and in the last three
quarters the Plaid warriors fought stubbornly, with the resulting score of 24 to 0.

November 24th, Thanksgiving day, the University of Pittsburg closed the most successful foot-ball season

in its history, by defeating Penn State College 11 to 0. Fully 25,000 people were present, ﬁlling the immense grand
stand almost to its capacity, and giving to it the appearance of one mass of ﬂoating banners. Two bands and

thousands of golden chrysanthemums lent gayety to the scene. Five times,,the tension of feeling rose to the bursting
point;—three times when Pitt carried the ball over, and twice when it seemed inevitable that State would make a
touch-down. Time and again the two teams see—sawed back and forth within their own 25-yard lines; time and again
they were pushed back with 15 and 25-yard penalties. Richards’ ankle was hurt early in the game and although
he stuck pluckily to his place he was unable to do the kicking. Galvin took his place and his exhibition of accurate
high spirals was remarkable. In the ﬁrst period Galvin kicked to Verry and after an exchange of punts State fumbled
the ball on the 15-yard line. Pitt was penalized 15 yards and Galvin failed at a try from placement. The ball was
put in place in the 25-yard line and from there Richards and Hittner carried it to the 1—yard line. With set faces
State waited for the rush, but almost before they were down Tex had gained thc coveted yard.

Pandemonium broke loose. The Pitt panther had a taste of blood, and for the time was the raging animal
of the wilds. Their ecstasy, however, was soon changed to a groan of apprehension. Miller, State's wonderful quar-

GALVIN AND RICHARDS

ter, made a pass to Verry who started toward the goal like a man inspired; the suspense was not long however, for
before he reached the 10-yard line he was tackled. No touch-down ever brought forth such enthusiasm as this tackle,
which meant so much to Pitt.

In the last period with the score 5 to 0, the visitors tried in desperation, every trick they knew. Wagner
starred in this quarter, catching an onside kick and out-distancing all pursuers. Galvin kicked goal, making the
score 11 to 0. On a 55-yard run a few minutes later Budd duplicated this feat but was unfortunately called back
on account of a penalty. Galvin then kicked, and Barret returned, ending the game. FINAL SCORE PITT 11,
PENN STATE 0.

The foot—ball banquet was a scene of intense excitement, when it was announced that J. C. Trees, '93, had
made a donation, for the building of the world's ﬁnest college stadium. This magniﬁcent gift came in recognition
of the wonderful record made by the Pitt team this season. The new ﬁeld will be situated upon the campus in an
almost natural ampitheater and will contain a base—ball diamond, a foot-ball ﬁeld, and a running track. In con-
nection with the ﬁeld will be a perfectly equipped gymnasium. In honor of Mr. Trees, who, by the way, was one
of the greatest foot—ball players of old Wup, the ﬁeld will be called “The Trees Memorial Stadium."

Jack Lindsey was unanimously chosen to succeed Tex Richards, Pitt’s greatest foot-ball captain; and while
we have lost a great Captain in Richards, we feel sure we have gained a great captain in Lindsey.

Letters were granted to men participating in the four big games; viz., Georgetown, West Virginia, W. & J.,
and Penn State. Seventeen men received the coveted insignia:—Captain Richards, Lindsey, Galvin, Dewar, Budd,
Peacock, Blair, Bailey, Brown, Quailey, Dallenbach, Hittner, Stevenson, Wagner, Gahlert, Butler and Dave Richards.

The administration of Chancellor William J. Holland, which began in 1891, marked the
expansion from a college into a university. Prof. James E. Keeler succeeded Prof. Langley at
the observatory. The Engineering school was strengthened by the addition of courses in mining
and electricity. In 1892 the Western Pennsylvania Medical College was amalgamated with the
University. In 189 5 departments in Law and Pharmacy were established. In 1896 the depart-
ment of Dentistry was added. The University now had seven distinct departments—it was a
university in fact as well as in name.

Dr. John A. Brashear, than whom the University has no truer friend, acted as chancellor
from I901 to 1904. Although pressed by private business, he sacriﬁced personal interests and
gave his best service to the upbuilding of the University. The splendid new Observatory in River-
view Park stands as a monument of his loyalty and activity.

The coming of Rev. Samuel Black McCormick, D. D., LLD., chancellor, in 1904, marked an
epoch in the history of the University. His ability and energy at once began to assert themselves.
A period of wonderful expansion and improvement began. In 1908 the name of the institution
was changed to “The University of Pittsburgh.” The new site of forty-three acres on the beauti-
ful Schenley Farms was secured, and plans were drawn up for a group of buildings that will surpass
in beauty and completeness anything of the kind in the world. These plans are being rapidly
carried out. Three beautiful buildings, State Hall, Thaw Hall, and Pennsylvania Hall, are
already occupied, and work on the others will be started in the near future.

Dr. McCormick has‘ also greatly improved the-work being done in the University. The
Medical School has been completely reorganized and placed upon a much higher plane. The
engineering courses have been broadened and improved and a co-operative system adopted under
which engineering students are given three months of practical work each year. Schools of Finance,
Education, and a Graduate College have been established. The addition of many able men to the
faculty and increased facilities in the way of room and apparatus in all departments have added
much to the efﬁciency of the school.

The history of the University has been one of perseverence and triumph—a struggle lasting
over a century. It is a history of which we may feel justly proud. Still, we do not consider the
University of Pittsburg an old institution. We prefer to conceive it as a lusty infant, untrammeled
by musty traditions and obsolete customs. All that has gone before is but the foundation, the
embryonic development. The University of Pittsburg is now entering upon a healthy young
life, and its future expectations and possibilities cannot be measured by past events.

CAPTAIN RICHARDS

on the cinder path were never brighter. Practically all the members of the team that won the Western

Pennsylvania track championship for Pitt in 1909 were back in school, and there was an abundance of new
material. Besides Captain Ross, the following Letter—men were available: Knotts, Van Doren, Robinson, Halferty,
Bryson, Weger, Richards, Lindsey, Wooten, Mackrell, Blackburn and Henry. Among the new comers were such
promising men as Lambing, Galvin, Proper, Downey, Tinsley and Wicks, the former W. & J. captain.

WHEN Captain Tony Ross called for track candidates in February, 1910, prospects for a successful season

The early training was done in the gymnasium of the Fort Pitt Athletic Club on Duquesne Way. Bob Maxwell,
the old Swarthmore star, took charge of the weight men, while Coach Thompson looked after the runners.

The ﬁrst test of strength was the indoor meet held at Duquesne Garden in the evening of March 12, under
the auspices of the Fort Pitt Athletic Club. Although this was an open meet, and Pitt was opposed to the two
big athletic clubs of the city, the team took second place in the number of points scored, being beaten out by the
Pittsburg Athletic Association. “Lefty” Weger was the star of the evening, winning the gold watch offered for
the individual scoring the greatest number of points. “Lefty" scored nine points, taking second in the 400-yard
dash, the 200-yard dash, and the obstacle race. “Ham” Wooten took second in the 60-yard dash, Galvin and
Richards landed second and third, respectively, in the shot putt; Knotts got second place in the 1,600-yard run and
Bryson ﬁnished third in the 800—yard run, making a total of twenty points.

In the Pittsburg Athletic Association’s indoor meet held at the Garden on April 10, the Blue and Gold relay
teams made an excellent showing. In the mile and three—ﬁfths relay race for Western Pennsylvania Colleges the
Pitt team, composed of Bryson, Henry, Lambing, and Wicks, was an easy winner, with Indiana Normal a poor
second. The one mile relay team made up of Halferty, Weger, Wicks and Robinson, ran second to the fast P.
A. A. quartet in a race that belonged to anybody up to the last yard.

Closely following these two indoor meets came the regular spring work-out for the track team. About
thirty-ﬁve men responded to Coach Thompson's call for candidates for the relay team to represent Pitt at the Na-
tional Relay Carnival held at Franklin Field, Philadelphia, April 30, under the auspices of the University of Penn-
sylvania. The winning men were Ross, Robinson, Bryson, and Lambing, Wicks landing the place of alternate.

Manager Zieg had been forced by the ofﬁcials of the meet to accept the placing of Pitt in the class with the
Carlisle Indians, New York University, and other fast Eastern teams. Protests, however, were of no avail, so the
relay team entered the race with the determination to do or die. It was a race between Pitt and the Indians from
start to ﬁnish. The great Two-Hearts ran ﬁrst for Carlisle, but he was unable to gain an advantage over Robinson.
Bryson and Lambing continued the race going against Dupuis and Friday. Moore started the last lap for the red-
skins with a slight advantage over Ross and in a heart-breaking ﬁnish he broke the tape a few feet ahead of our Tony.
The exceedingly fast time of 3:282-5 was made.

On the following Saturday, May 7th, the Annual Interclass meet was held on the Oval. The Seniors, through
the ability of Zieg, Knotts and Richards were able to take first place, scoring 42 points. The Juniors followed a
close second with 41 points, kept in the running by the work of Captain Ross, who easily took the 100 and 200-yard
dashes. The class of 1912, with the woeful lack of representation, were very fortunate in annexing 15 points, leaving
the Freshman the “cellar championship” with 5 points.

May 21st, the University held its Fifth Annual Intercollegiate and Interscholastic Track and Field Meet
on Schenley Oval. The contest was witnessed by one of the largest and most appreciative audiences in the annals
of these tournaments, and was by far the most exciting and interesting event of its kind ever held in Pittsburgh.
Many records, both of the University and of Western Pennsylvania, were broken in the College events, along with
several in the scholastic events. The honors of the meet were carried oﬁ" by Pitt, which scored in 13 out of 15
events, amassing a total score of 62 1-5 points. Wooster was a poor second with 31 11-15 points. In the inter-
scholastic, Pittsburgh High School swept everything before it, completely out-classing its rivals.

CAPTAIN ELECT BRYSON

In the College events Captain Ross did remarkably well in the dashes. Robinson and Bryson in the quarter
mile had everything their own way. Tinsley and Richards did remarkably well in the jumps. As an added at-
traction “Fresh” Knotts fairly surpassed himself and broke his own record for the two-mile. Doc Van Doren
broke two records and Galvin set a new mark in the shot putt. Wiggens of Westminster broke the Western Penn-
sylvania discus record. The Westminster relaying team sprung the surprise of the afternoon when they defeated
Pitt.

In the scholastic events Pittsburgh High School lowered the relay time to 3:37 4-5 and Gains of Cleveland
added 1 3-4 inch to the Pole vault record.

The following men were awarded a letter at the close of the track season :—Captain Ross,iBryson, Lambing,
Robinson, Downey, Wicks, Halferty, Weger, Tinsley, Proper, Richards, Knotts, Henry, Galvin, Van Doren.

pionship in both singles and doubles coming to the representatives of the Blue and the Gold. The annual
intercollegiate tournament was held in this city under the auspices of the Tennis association of the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh, and the entire conduct of the games reflected great credit upon the men in charge.

Early in May a meeting was called to elect officers for the year and the following choice was made: A. S. John-
ston, president; W. R. Stern, vice president; and J. E. Sloan, secretary and treasurer. At a meeting held two
weeks later, J. C. Mackrell was chosen manager of the team, with instructions to proceed with the arrangements for
the tournament.

As a result of preliminary trials, Wright, Wilbert, J. Sloan and Mackrell were entitled to represent the Uni-
versity on the courts.

The standing of the teams and the individual players for the tournament were as follows:

BASKET-BALL

.§2~.§s~

game had been popular it had not received adequate support, and had proved a ﬁnancial drain upon the

University. Be that as it may, this measure was not heartily received by the students, who for the next
two years sent periodic petitions to the Athletic committee in vain attempts to have the game reinstated. Finally,
as they had about given up all hope, their prayers were answered, with the result of the 1910-11 basket-ball team.

When the call was sent out for candidates about 30 husky lads responded for practice, which was begun in
Duquesne Garden, in the latter part of December. The ﬁnal squad was composed of Lindsay, the foot-ball captain-
elect; McDowell of Pittsburgh High, Campbell and Bane, of Homestead High, Bonine of Duquesne, Calhoun of
Apollo and Weger, Budd and Farmer of the 1908 squad. «

Of Captain Weger's ability as a coach and player nothing need to be said. Budd and Farmer each gave a
good account of himself, and Campbell played a heady and consistent game throughout the season. Lindsay and
McDowell, the centers, gave a good exhibition of goal shooting. ‘

The season opened January 13, with Waynesburg College as the ﬁrst opponent. The game was a good one
but somewhat slow, Pitt failing to show good team work. This weakness, however, was overcome by the time of
their next appearance at the Garden when they defeated Tech.

At home Pitt remained invincible, easily winning all her games, but when on the road the tables were re-
versed. Away from home the accuracy and quickness of shooting and passing seemed to be lost and it was only at
intervals that the true ability of the team ﬂashed out.

The varsity positions were ﬁlled by Weger and Farmer at forwards, McDowell and Lindsay at center, and
Budd and Campbell guards.

Very early in the season Dutch Wohlfarth of the Homstead Central league team, was secured as coach. The
position was too arduous, however, and Dutch soon turned to something more proﬁtable.

In the series with Carnegie Tech for the City championship the Plaid passers failed to live up to their agree-
ment, insisting that the deciding game be played on their own ﬂoor instead of on neutral boards. They were at the
time in a weakened condition and possibly this had something to do with the position which they took. There is
little doubt but that the Gold and Blue would have walked away with the ﬁnal game, had it been played, and so the
refusal makes little or no difference.

Immediately after the Mt. Union game, Walter F. Campbell was elected to lead next year's team. Captain-
elect Campbell comes from Homestead, and has been playing varsity guard throughout the season.

BASKET-BALL, the only winter sport supported by the University, was dropped in 1908. Although the

The University of Pittsburgh offers instruction in eleven thoroughly
organized schools.

The courses in the College are organized according to the group system,
which provides broad general culture as well as the Opportunity for specializa-
tion in the latter part of the course.

A full college course for the training of teachers is offered in the School
of Education. Educational theory based on the newest conceptions of science
and professional skill developed by unusual facilities at the command of the
University, serve as the basis of this course.

The co-Operative plan by which the students are given practical work in
manufacturing plants is now in operation in the School of Engineering and
the School of Mines.

New buildings in the new location in Oakland are now occupied by the
College, School of Education, School of Economics, School of Engineering,
School of Mines and School of Medicine.

A new Gymnasium and Athletic Field will be constructed during the
present year and will be ready for use in the Fall of I91 I.

A GOOD LUCK GAS RANGE

makes the kitchen a delightful place to be. Why? Because it
is made right. The perfection of the work it is called upon to
do was our primary object in constructing and carrying out the
details in its mechanism.

Our absolute guarantee goes with each range.

Thousands of the Good Luck Range have been sold each
year for 16 years.

Ask your neighbor how she likes the Good Luck Range.

We also have a complete line of home and office heaters.

To scratch well is an art. The editor is an artist and expects to scratch you very well, where it hurts most.
Where that may be is a question; but, anyhow, he expects it to hurt, and he expects you to howl. We count on
facing a howling mob, but our ofﬁce will be well-guarded, and we shall continue to publish regularly our sacred little
book of student opinion, which is for certain reasons, withheld by the individuals. We ﬁrmly believe, in the freedom
of the press; and if we should say, for instance, about Dr. Chambers, “God made him, and therefore let him pass
for a man," we should expect him to howl in vain, while we continue writing admiration-evoking, high-sounding
truth.

(6  D! or H N0_!)

Men often address us in chapel and declare, “Teach the boys to say ‘no’ when they are young.” “The
Scratch” suggests a variation in the program: Why not tell the co-eds “teach the girls to say ‘yes’ when they are

young. They may not get a chance later."

FOUNDED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY, 1825 NORTH SIDE, PITTSBURGH, PA

HE Faculty consists of six professors and four instructors. Modern methods of study
are employed in all departments. The course of study is thorough and practical,
and is intended to train men as pastors and preachers. Committees of the Faculty
and the Board of Directors are co—operating in the revision of the curriculum. It
is expected that the revised curriculum will be put in operation next September. A
complete description of the new courses will be published after they are adopted by
the Board of Directors. A special course is offered in Practical Christian Ethics,
in which students investigate the problems of city missions, settlement work, and
other forms of Christian activity. The City of Pittsburgh affords unusual opportun-
ities for the study of social problems.

The students have exceptional library facilities. The Seminary Library of 34,000
Volumes contains valuable collections of works in all departments of Theology, but is especially rich in
Exegesis and Church History; the students also have access to Carnegie Library, which is situated
within five minutes’ walk of the Seminary buildings.

A post—graduate scholarship of $400 is annually awarded to the member of the graduating class
who has the highest rank and who has spent three years in the institution. A gymnasium and grounds
aﬁ’ord ample opportunity for recreation. ,

All the buildings are located on the West Park, one of the most beautiful residence districts of
Greater Pittsburgh.

“ KNOCKS ” OR WHAT’S WRONG WITH PITT.
By Arthur E. Fish of Wisconsin.

A story comparing God's school, Wisconsin, with Pitt, to the detriment of the latter. Still—distance lends
enchantment, so we must take with a grain of salt the learned writer's Utopian view of his own school, and his pes-
simistic utterances concerning Pitt. “PITT WEEKLY.”

“PRACTICAL CITIZENSHIP ” OR HOW TO STUFF A BALLOT-BOX.”
By Robert McKown.

Not to be read by juveniles. How to win, tho’ your side has less votes, is ably discussed by the author, who
has practical experience in such affairs. “ECONOMIC GAZETTE.”

‘‘HOW WE MADE THE CONQUEST AT LAKE GEORGE.”
By four skilled Professors.

A very interesting book revealing the arts of world wise men in their successful conquest of maidens’ hearts.
The book is especially adapted for the use of bachelors and mollycoddles. Price 30c if you buy it, but gratutious if you
can stand the line handed to you by any of the authors.

DR. B’S “SOLILOQUY” OR “WHY SO MANY

STUDENTS REPEAT THE UPPER CLASSES.”

“To promote or not to promote these ‘Medical
Jokes,‘ is the question.

Whether it would be better to cover up these il-
literates with Sheep's Clothing.

Or lending a helping hand to them or let them ramble
among the laiety totally ignorant.

’Tis extremely difficult to tell which one knows more
and which one less.

Or else to be a real Emancipator and try

To save the public from their——awful fate,

Of being doped and physiced by a gang of “Know
Knothings."

Who can hardly differentiate a Headache from a
Cough,

I have it; in my hand I have two dice,

Whose value, doth much exceed, a million times,

Their Knowledge of the Branch of S .

If I throw and seven comes forth,

Much mercy will I show. If the reverse,

My, what a number will ﬂunk. Eleven! Eleven!

So help you merry gentlemen,

To repeat the year again.”

So brother students, those who have been left at the
post this year, must soon start a recruiting station of
the “Cells of Golgi” and “Martinotti” and open a
dancing class on “The ﬂoor of the Third Ventricle”
as “Vicq D’ Azyr’s Band” has been rehearsing on the
“Island of Laungerhan" since the last examinations.

“DOC ANTI-IONY’S AUTOPSY OVER CAESAR’S
CADAVER.”

Friends, Romans, Countrymen, lend me your ears,

I come to incise Caesar, not to bury him.

The evil that men do gets after them;

The goods are oft interred with their bones;

So let it be with Caesar. The Noble Brutus

Hath told you Caesar was a Lunatic, '

If it were so it was a grievous fault,

And grieviously hath Caesar answered for it.

Herewith the Carte Blanche of Brutus and the Clique;
For Brutus is an honorable man;

So are they all, all honorable men—

Came I to incise Caesar's Cadaver.

He was patient, faithful and just to me

But Brutus says he was Nuts

And Brutus is a wise guy.

With a skin full of booze he came to Rome,

And formed adhesions with a spigot:

Did this in Caesar wet his whistle?

Yet we are told, he wept when they passed a sound.
Ambition should be made of sterner stuﬁ’:

Yet Brutus says he was ambitious

And Brutus has a N iserian infection,

You all did see that in the labratory

I thrice tested him a la Gouche,

And thrice he was positive: was this ambition?

Yet Brutus says he has Eczema:

And sure he is a wise guy.

I speak not to knock Brutus’s policies

But rather here to “Shoot the Bull: ”

Darned if I ain't sore on the rough house

Did I not pry a marble from his gall bladder,

And play Annie Laurie on the Antrium (Horn)?

We have seen him in the Senate with the Gout,

And have rejoiced that it has not Lewe’s:

But yesterday the body of Caesar was

Worth ten dead men: Now he lies there V

And none so educated to incise him but me.

O, audience, if I were disposed to open his Calveria
And ﬁnd an intracranial clot,

I should do Brutus wrong and Cassius wrong

Who you all know are wise guys:

I will now incise into the Carotid and there I ﬁnd an

emboli,
I rather choose to say this caused his death; I may be
wrong,

But this will vindicate such honorable men.

But here’s his lungs which indeed are much Anthracosed
I found them in his Thorax; see how congested they are:
Let but the labratory assistants do a microscopal ex-

amination
And they will say that Caesar had Pneumonia;
I now will examine his third intention wounds

Page
Two hundred eighty-six

And wipe the sacred blood with my sponge,

Yea, I will open up his joints:

And there I ﬁnd some Tophi,

Bequeathing it a most important sign

That Caesar had the Gout.

Have patience, gentle audience, I must still incise;
You all did know that Caesar loved his booze.

You are not wood, you are not stones, but men;

And being men, you know that Alcohol,

Causes atrophy of connective tissue resulting in Cir-

rohosis of the Liver (Laenneg’s).

'Tis good there is not Gall Bladder disease;

For I had long ago removed his Gall Stones

Will you be patient? will you stay awhile?

Until I see if Caesar had an Aneurism of the Aorta
For I do not want to wrong the honorable men

Whose hypodermic needles have pierced Caesar.

You will compel me then to incise the whole body?
Then make a ring around Caesar’s cadaver

And let me show that Caesar had the Measles,

Shall I proceed? And later will you give me leave?
Nay, press not in upon me: stand afar off.

If you have tears, prepare to shed them now.

You all do know that Caesar had a Gastric Ulcer, I

remember

The first time he ever had those pains;

’Twas on a Summer’s evening, three hours after his meal,
That day he was compelled to use Morphine:

Look, in this place a Cancer has started to progress:
See how the Plyorus shows Hypertrophic Stenosis
Through this the food could not pass, and look at his

Dilated Stomach.

And here see how the Appendix has atrophied,

Mark how the Adhesions had surrounded the Bowel,
As if he wished to strangulate it.

If this Typhoid Ulcer had only perforated:

Why Caesar would have died of Peritonitis.

Judge, 0 you people, what Caesar had to suffer.

For this Pancreas shows the absence of Langerhauns

Islands
And this in fact caused his Diabetic symptons,
But look you the Haemopericardium, which indeed
helped to vanish him.

See how the heart is dilated and Hypertrophied,

Even at the base, the Appendices are abnormal.

Just see the button hole opening and look at the mitral

valves,
Does this not show that Caesar had Mitral Stenosis
and Regurgitation

But here's a Paracentesis of the Heart

0, what a fall there was, gentlemen,

When Brutus’s dagger had caused so much damage!
Kind souls, what weep you when you but behold

Our Caesar’s wounded heart? Look you here,

Here is himself death the cause by the hands of traitors.

THE COMEDY OF ERRORS

Behold, after a run of 23 years at the Brereton Avenue Theatre, the Medical Faculty Company, now star-
ring in the “Comedy of Errors," are making a great success at the New “ Goblers Knob ” Theatre. The new theatre
is under the personal direction of Thomas Shaw Arbuthnot.

Program subject to change before each and every act. With the newly acquired Arena, which is beautifully
and artistically arranged, it is expected the World will soon sit up and take notice. Some of the greatest acts ever
presented will be produced on “Goblers Knob," which is easily accessible in air ships, balloons or other kinds of
ﬂying conveyances, which can be supplied on short notice.

The main opening was a beneﬁt performance for the upper class men, which consisted of a beautifully ar-
ranged program and banquet. In room 106, the banquet was served to the Juniors, there being covers laid for 72.
The color eﬂect was black and white. The banquet was served in Blue Books, while each student received a souvenir
with each course (a black look from the one or more of the many watchers). After the Banquet was served, High
Class Continuous Vaudeville entertainment was presented, in which more than ordinary talent was shown. The
curtain rose on January 9th at 9 o'clock and the performances continued for one week. The ﬁrst performance was by

PROFESSOR I-IECKEL.

For sixty minutes “ Optitis " Heckel presented some rapid ﬁre works in Black Art Second Sight (Presbyopia);
Optical parallel rays; “How Mr. Gono played tiddlie winks with the conjunctiva.” “What happened when Silver
Nitrate rang the bell in Supra—orbital Notch and the result when Blepharitis tried to wink at Miss Cornea.” The
audience was awed and the ﬁnger stiff at the end of this act.

The next act

EDWARDS LILLIPUTIANS.

Owing to the length of the program this act too was very rapidly given. The Lilliputians are wonderful,
most of them having been under the personal direction of “Dutchy" Elterich. They had been trained since birth
and fed on “Orange Juice,” “Fairchilds Essence of Pepsin," Zmuss” and “Ramogen.” The Lilliputians are now
chaperoned by “Fresh Air” Edwards, who indeed instructed us on the wee wee ones’ future welfare. The elongated
convict looking gentlemen presented lightning like works on “How to charge a Croup Kettle and How to ﬁre it,"
“When should a Shoe Buttoner catch hold of a foreign body; ” “ How the laryngeal muscle seized the Canalis laryn-
xis during its spasm and nearly squeezes it to death; ” and “When, why, and What time Fresh Air is needed."

LICHTY AND FENALLOSA.

The dare devil tamers. Patients eat from their hands. The most daring event was the feeding of a patient
by stomach tube.

During this act the Hippocratic looking Lichty amused us with the never tiring little tragedy of “ How Trick,
the string test discovered that Pyloric ulcer had moved and that Cancer now occupied Ulcer’s former residence.”
Also the amusing remarks on “The safe passage of Bismuth Subcarbonate through the dark tunnel, the duel he
fought with Mister Protein and how he came forth carrying the shield of victory;” “When Oschner’s treatment was
applied to Appendicitis, how the Appendix did laugh when he knew he was not going to be amputated,” and “The
playing of the tune of “I’ll get you yet, by Peritonitis on the adhesions which Inﬂammation had formed.” A
little later in the act the sissiﬁed Fenallosa presented some snail like talk on “The reason why so many students are
puppets.”

Ther. an intermission while the stage hands were changing scenes for that heart rendering tragedy “The
doings in the Pathological laboratory;" with professor Horsecar Klotz and company.

The ever pleasant Professor Klotz appears with his well chosen address of “How to pick Hobnails from a
Hobnail liver;" “Why the Spirochette in the germ cell, manufactured gum and laid it down in the liver as focal
necrosis, in order that it might photograph (focus) the surrounding organs;” “How the Keratinizing Epitheloma
pushed the cells together, then ruptured the intercellular bridges and Rodent ulcer was formed,” followed by a little
ballad entitled “The Mysterious Lung or Why it refuses to crepitate."

Then the noble Heythorne presented some rare drawings on “Why the liver lobule resembles a city block: "
and of “How an infant looks like a pig pen.” Heythorne has trained the laboratory animals to such a degree that he
was able to present to the audience of “How the Lardiceous Spleen manufactured lard" and “Why a Poly eats so
much Eosin in that he can produce three or more heads.”

Later in the act, McLaughlin presented a pathetic little ballad entitled “You may talk about your Heart
Lesion but never let Typhoid present you with a ‘Milk Leg.’”

This act is one of the best of the bill an indeed the actors deserved all the curtain calls and applause that were
given them.

OTTO GAUB.

The well known American Billy Bounce assisted by “Fatty Grubs” Meredith. Billy Bounce presented
imitations of disintegration polymorpho nuclear neutrophites traveling through Hunter’s canal to hear the Ileo Tibal
land play, while the Polyblast waltzed on the ﬂoor of the Fourth Ventricle; “Sir Every Burn discussing with him-
self whether he should be skin grafted or be fed on Antiphlogistine; " and “What happened when Mr. Strep fought
Poly for ten long rounds." Later in the act Meredith presented a little sketch on “Tell me please, is this a ﬁrst,
second or third intention Wound.”

As an extra added attraction, Carroll, the sweet voiced obstetrician rendered ten verses of that sacred ballad
entitled “Labor and Presentation,” followed by a few jokes as “Pull tight on the cords and hear the beautiful music; ”
“Twins may come and twins may go; but I am one of the twins and I live on forever; ” followed by another funny
ballad entitled “Oh where! Oh where! has my ﬂunky (McKibben) gone.” This act was well rendered and I think
that Good Lord will meet great opposition on his next tour to Pittsburgh.

BUCK BUCHANAN & CO,

During the ﬁrstpart of this act the pseudo cyetic looking little gentleman with the lawn tennis pants presented
some pathetic remarks on “Why the fracture of Humerus strangled the Brachial artery;” “How the Recurrent
Laryngeal nerve squeaked when it was touched;” “When the so called Tubercular joint was opened, the Crucial
Ligaments popped their heads out and with their mouths full of chewing gum, muttered “We are right,Buck, we are
all right;” “The plastic splint playing a tune on the Radius and “The Bucks extension doing gymnastic stunts."

As the company is very successful, they produce a beneﬁt performance semi-annually, in the form of a clever
little double barreled farce entitled “The mysterious quarter of a per cent. or why so many students repeat the
upper classes." The scene is laid in the examining room of the University.

Detectives, police, guards and ﬂoor walkers.

We sit and sit until we develop Fibromas; then the direct cause (Buck Buchanan) effects us and the result
is that we suffer from inﬂammation. The result of the inﬂammation is that our vitality is lowered at examination
time. Then the Guard, Chief of Police and Detectives, get on the trail and ferret out the guilty parties. Then, the
marks are given out and the cry is “I must repeat the upper classes.” This little farce seems amusing to all but the
students. It should result in the Honor system in the large colleges. As Professor Buchanan is a great teacher, he
is just as good a mathematician as can be found. His marks are just, each man being marked on his merits (? the
students about this).

STEWART FAMILY.

The Irish Keen Cutters present a novel act of why Spina Bifidia rang down the curtain and became a dead
one; “How Contusion opened the doors of the Scalp and let in Mr. Strep who walked over the Subaponeurotic layer
and had a free ride through the arterial stream, giving the Mastoid the laugh, and making the patient feel that he
was taking a life long voyage through the straight and heavenly path; “What became of Peritoneum when he traveled
through the Inguinal canal and was later guilotined;” How the Cholestrin stone punched the Bile pigment stone
under the chin, knocking him against the wall of the Gall Bladder, and thus ending his existence; ” and lastly a little
sketch entitled, “Spoons are queer things to ﬁnd in the Caecum.”

JAMES D. HEARD.

The worlds greatest Monologist now starring in a life long sketch “Is Matrimony a failure." It is rumored
that James Heard will next year star in “A Woman’s Way.” He will be remembered by his never tiring mono-
logues on, “L0 and behold the sign appeared, when Little Elsie through the Power of Prayer left her home on the
Mountain top and on the plains found the English Glowworm which later in life uttered Sweet Oaths of a Foreign
Nation;” also “When Digitalis was King how he knocked on the door of Mitral Stenosis and bade him leave his
residence;” “What might occur when the phantom rythmatic metallic tinkling apex beat is heard down in the
Stomach;” and “How Rheumatism not only gave a patient pain but also sucked the juice from the Mitral valve
and made it wither.” The wee cachectic looking Frody later in the act imitated how Palpitation won the ﬁrst heart
and left Stokes Adams disease at the post.

Thus the performance is ended and if Keith and Proctor, Harry Davis or Hyde and Behman can in a hundred

years from now produce a “Comedy of Errors" with as much extraordinary talent, the world will take 05 their hats
to the Past Master, Thomas Arbuthnot.

LOVITIS.

Inﬂammation of the whole anatomical structure is the most important of acute bodily disorders. Formerly
this disease was thought to be either a functional or neurotic condition, but of late years, through the bacteriological
researches of Pearce and Linhart, they have discovered a Diplobacillus which shows Lovitis to be an organic disease.

Deﬁnition—Lovitis is an acute speciﬁc infectious disease caused by the Love Diplobacillus, the lesions which
are characterized by palpitation of the heart, tachycardia, myocardial degeneration, dilation and hypertrophy of
the heart, hypertrophy of the praecordium, active hyperaemia (Local Plethoria or Blush), atrophy of the muscles
of the thigh and legs; hypertrophy of muscles of arms and lips; contracted pupils during day and dilated at night;
rambling monologues and epileptiform seizures, all the above lesions having a tendency to become chronic.

Etiology—The infection is widespread extending from Buffalo Wallo to Horizonton, very rare in cold blooded
and neurotic people. Entire population of the world succumbs to this disease sometime during life.

Ratio of Lovitis to associated diseases has been propounded by Wasserman in the laboratories of the Gretna
Greens. Of his 279 cases the following shows Lovitis to be very malignant:

Lovitis . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ..l47 cases.

Pschyo Neuroses . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 67 “

Hammer Toe . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .. 2 “

Pediculosis . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .. 10 “

Stellate Fracture . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .. 53 “

Mormans, polygamists, descendants of Henry VIII, Kings Emanuel and Alphonso, seem especially predisposed.
Lovitis (although its identity has just lately been known) is older than the walls of Jericho, has an attraction greater
than an electric magnet and is more common than squash bugs. Lovitis occurs at all ages but especially prevalent
in those persons whose cortical thoughts are still like the ﬂuttering of a bird.

Symptoms—In the acute cases the symptoms may be spontaneous. In chronic cases there is a tendency for the
symptoms to last to time immemorial. The patient has palpitation of the heart due to the mental excitement af-
fecting the irritable heart. Tachycardia (fast heart) is always present in the early stage, even in the mildest forms,
and is one of the most important symptoms. This symptom is caused by the Dart striking the Vagus Nerve, thus
paralyzing it and the stimulation of the Sympathetic (Accelerator) Nerve by the toxins of the Love Bacillus. There
is a feeling of ﬂuttering and goneness of the heart which makes the patient feel as if he was taking a trip through the
“Flowery Heavenly Path.” Bi—weekly nocturnal epileptiform seizures are prevalent. These seizures are mani-
fested when the patient is disturbed by a visitor. The exclamations resulting from these seizures are “Smack,
Smack, Smack” goes the vermillion border on the cheek and “Squeeze, Squeeze, Squeze.” The Myocardium
(Heart muscle) is very much affected and as a result of this Myocardial degeneration, the heart is very easily pierced
by a scalpel. The physical signs present are as follows:

Inspection—The face shows signs of active hyperaemia which is caused by stimulation of vaso motor nerves
by the Love Bacillus. This hyperaemia (Blush) indeed is sufficient to make Carmine powder take a back seat.
The lips and muscles of the arm are seen to be hypertrophied while the muscles of the thigh and legs are atrophied
due to the continuous pressure. ’

The pupils are contracted during the day and dilated during the night.

Palpitation—Conﬁrms some of the signs seen on the inspection.

Percussion—There is an increased area of Cardiac dullness and ﬂatness. This shows that the heart is dilated
and hypertrophy is present, since there is an increased arterial tension.

Auscultation—During the day and night it is possible to hear a rambling crescendo murmur (monologue) of a
Devil-like nature which is “I wonder if the Love Bacillus will stick to its duty and when will its exudate become
resolved.” This murmur is heard during both systole and diastole of the heart.

Diagnosis—Made from patients’ history, etiology, symptoms and differential diagnosis from that pruritus disease,
Pediculosis, and that heart rendering complication, Stellate Fracture.

Of some minor symptoms, which are indeed important and are almost positive proof that Lovitis is present, we
have the following: The patient’s teeth should be examined for evidences of violence, as in most cases during the
paroxysmal attacks the dentine is fractured and the lips are hypertrophied, showing evidence of overwork. X-ray
pictures should be taken of males to locate the portions of hair and hairpins which are swallowed during one of the
epileptiform attacks.

The following muscles should be examined for pressure atrophy: Sartorius, Pectineus, Vastus, Internus, and
Crureus.

During severe attacks there may be a dislocation of the joints of either or both arms, Osler reports many cases
of fractures due to direct violence as in missiles being hurled from short distances, such as shoes in which the hurler
has neglected to remove the pedical extremity.

Prognosis:—As to the life, depends on the amount of violence and duration of attacks. Over long continued cases
patients become thin, emaciated and show all symptoms of failing. E. Pluribus Unum. This is one of the diseases
that after a number of attacks continued over along period (several years) illustrates the scientiﬁc relation between
heart and stomach through Meissner and Auerbauch plexus, which was illustrated by Juniors to Dr. Heard in first
examination.

The male patient usually succumbs easier than the female.

Treatment:—Depends on etiology, seasons of the year, virulence of organism, resistance of patient and diet.

During attacks, applications of Two—lip salve with each seizure, which should be preceded by breath hearts.

Patients are advised not to use garlic, onions or any odoriferous foods when they notice an attack approaching.

Up until the present no Anti-Love serum has been discovered and nothing seems to lessen the virulence of the
organisms, once they have reached the blood stream. That the Love Bacillus travels by the blood cannot be doubted
for in severe cases there is an anemic condition which does not respond to treatment with the Syrup of Iodide of Iron
or Bland’s Pills. Widows and young girls seem most prone to this infection, while maiden ladies past forty are immune.
In the chronic or long continued cases we are advised by many writers to administer one dose of Diamond from one to
ﬁve carats, according to the amount of failure of E. Pluribus Unum, to be followed by a change of scenery. In this
case do not advise change of altitude or trips to the seashore, as this sudden change may end by crisis, but advise a
long walk, sitting in dark corners, soft music, ﬂowers and candy and on return of E. Pluribus Unum, a visit to the
minister and immediate marriage.

' CONSTITUTION
. ‘ NAME. .
This Organization shall be. known as the “OWL BOARD or THE UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH."_

OBJECT.

The object of this organization shall be the publication of a University Annual to be_ known as the “OWL” of
the nature and character as heretofore.
ORGANIZATION.

The Owl Board shall be composed of a President, a President-elect, an Editorial Staff and a Body of Buiness
Managers. . ‘ A -

The President—elect shall be chosen by the Sophoniore Class-at-large, on Wednesday immediately preceding
the last Monday of the Fall Term, and he shall by virtue of such election be the President of the Board during the
Junior year of the Class so electing him. (In the year 1911, the Sophomore Class shall proceed to elect a President-
elect on the second Monday of May and the one so elected shall become President of the Board in the year 1912,
as above provided.) .

The Editorial Staﬁ‘ shall be composed of representatives chosen, one from each department of the University,
on the ﬁrst Monday of November each year by the students of his respective department.‘

The Body of Managers shall be composed of representatives chosen, one from each department of the Uni-
versity, on the ﬁrst Monday of November each year by the students of his respective department.

On the . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ..of . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ..immediately following the elections, the Editorial Staff
shall meet and from their number elect an Editor-in-chief.

On the same date the Body of Business Managers shall meet and from their number elect a Business Manager-
in-chief.

The Editorial Staff shall constitute a separate branch of the Board and be presided over by the Editor-in—chief,
and shall make such rules and regulations as shall be deemed necessary, not in contravention of this constitution.

The Body of Managers shall constitute a separate branch of the Board and be presided over by the Business
Manager-in—chief, and shall make such rules and regulations for the eonduct of the business of the Body as shall
be in accordance with this constitution.

POWERS AND DUTIES.

The President, Editor-in-chief and Business Manager-in-chief shall constitute the Executive Committee, which
shall ﬁnally decide all questions of policy which shall involve the co-operation and co-ordination of the two Branches
of the Board; any two of whom shall decide a question or controversy.

The President-elect shall be admitted to all meetings of the Executive Committee. all meetings of the Editorial
Staff, and all meetings of the Business Managers, but have no voice. He shall be present for the purpose of becoming
acquainted with methods of publishing the Annual.

The Editorial Staff, under the direction of the Editor—in-chief shall prepare all the subject matter which shall
be the contents of the OWL, exclusive of the advertising matter. 1

The Body of Business Managers, under the direction of the Business Manager—in-chief, shall attend to the
ﬁnancial matters connected with the publication of the OWL, and provide ways and means for publishing the sub-
ject matter which shall be the contents of the same.

The Editor-in-chief shall be ex—oﬁicio Secretary of the Board.

The Business Manager-in-chief shall be ex-ofﬁcio Treasurer of the Board and shall keep an open account of all
moneys received.

All disbursements shall be made only on order drawn by the Treasurer and countersigned by the President
of the Board. V g

The Board, by a two-thirds vote of all members, shall have power to adopt appropriate rules and regulations
in addition to the foregoing, which shall be deemed essential for carrying out the purpose of its existence.

To the honorable and worthy gentlemen, our successors, we herewith above submit a tentative plan, for the
express purpose of having a deﬁnite course, and in some degree, proper methods for pursuing the necessary work
incidental to the publishing of the University Annual of a type and character that shall be second to none.

It is an admitted and lamentable truth among the “Owl” Boards of the past that they have gone into the work
of publishing the annual without any deﬁnite plan of procedure and with but a vague conception of the numerous
requirements and details that are essential to the production of a book that would do credit to its authors and pos-

' sessors. The primary object of the above outlined organization is, however, not the standard or class of material

 

which may compose the “ Owl ” but a means for providing the material with the least resistance by those upon whom

deﬁnite and explicit responsibilities are placed.
Respectfully submitted, THE COMMITTEE.

marks are deceptive and he may yet capture a degree. He has
the speed, at least, for the Sophs tried to get him in his Freshman
year, and Demmey out-distanced his fellow—countryman, “ Ham ”
who can go some.

JUSTUS HOWARD DICE,

Pittsburgh High School.
Science Club.

. M. C. A.
Department Editor of the Pitt Weekly.

Frenchy looks like a scholar. Very agreeable but “stags it"
to all the classicals’ parties. An able historian and quite expert
in pronouncing those sneezable French words. Dice is a member
of the French Alliance, and deserves a gold medal from Dr.
Harry. Attends all formal functions, and is an image of formal
correctness. Will make a great French instructor. A perfect
gentleman.

KARL JENNINGS I-IOLLIDAY, AA

Butler High School.

Student Assistant in Chemistry (2), (3).
Class Foot-ball (1).

Athletic Representative.

Business Manager 1912 Owl.

A ladies’ man, but not a lady's man. A1ec’s chief assistant,
and collector-in-chief of yellow stamps. Very graceful dancer,
and a prominent ﬁgure at all hops. Karl is some business man,
very aggressive, Very positive, very precise. Assumed a worried
look when he became business manager of the Owl.

RALPH EVERETT GEORGE,
Carnegie High School.
Y. M. C. A.

Vice President Pitt Forensic Society.
Intercollegiate Debate (2). (3).

The debater par excellence. He is good; he knows it, and lets
everybody else know it. George's Nemesis is Greek and Scribby,
which combination proved too much for George's aesthetic
temperament, so he switched to German under “Der Kaiser.”
Always willing to argue for the sake of argument, and always
insists that his memorized introduction is extemporaneous.
Usually like is attracted by unlike, but here like and like combine.
Fish and George are great friends.

IDA WILHELMINA HATTMAN,
Coraopolis High School.

A buxom blonde from a busy suburb. Ida is developing into
a rather positive, outspoken young miss, and possesses a clear
knowledge of what she wants to say. Will probably give herself
up to teaching and think she has made a sacriﬁce. May, how-
ever, devote herself to the lecture platform as a militant sulf-
ragette or a “new” woman not in a harem skirt.

GLEN DANIEL KAMMER,
Allegheny High School.

One of those who had the nerve to get_married during his col-
lege course. Never known to act without pondering well,
but-—when a man is in love you never can tell. Dan is a Chemis-
try shark, and Woo1y’s chief assistant in research work and Dutch.
A crack poo1—player, but hereafter Dan will have to forsake the
clicking ivories and stick to wifey.

HENRY TITUS KOENIG,
Tarentum High School.

Henry is a rough-houser, but yet a gentleman. Came from a
somewhere up in Pennsylvania we never heard of before. Is a
man of distinction in Chemistry and beloved by Alec. A
townsman of Stewarts and yet sober and industrious. Never
seen with a skirt.

WILLIAM ZELLERS LUTHER,

Wilkinsburg High School.
Cap and Gown Club (2) (3).
Y. M. C. A.

Our only original! One of the famous “57.” A half cousin
to the Seven Sutherland Sisters and father of Ella Wheeler
Pillbox. The daintiest, darlingist, dumplingist, little bit of
Dresden china or Edam cheese ever made. Has only the
failing~too good natured. Will do anything for anybody any-
time. Would like to play with the co-eds, but he is too shy.
Has a great sense of humor and a great laugh. In a word he
is the greatest little chap that ever was a son of Pitt. Lies
awake at nights thinking of something to do for the Cap and
Gown Club. Believed by some to be the future T om Thumb
of the American stage. If you don't believe us see for yourself.

HOWARD STEPHEN MILLER, <I>Z<i>

Beaver High School.
Science Club.
Assistantship—Biology (3).

A product of the Ohio Valley and all to the good. Came to
Pitt in 1908 and has been here ever since. Has medical as-
pirations of the very highest type. We hope that they may
materialize. At present these surgical ambitions are conﬁned
to operations on cats, frogs, pups and snakes. “Baldy" is
particularly fond of snakes but prefers live ones to ﬁre-water
kind. Is sometimes forced to sleep with the latter. He'll
reform though when he is a full ‘ﬂedged M. D. and has also a
“Mrs. M. D.” -

NELLIE DONALDSON MCBRIDE,

Pittsburgh High School.
Classical Club.

One of our three fair Co-eds. She certainly is a peach. Her
specialty is showing up nonc0—eds when they are not in condition
to recite. Blushes at times but not on account of the men.
Not a suffragette.

EDGAR CHARLES NIEBAUM,

East Liberty Academy.
Pittsburgh Academy.
Science Club.

Classical Club.

A typical German who like Alter never ventures out on wet
days without his heavy rubbers. Stars in Linhart’s classes
because he can say “yes” so well. Always managed to get his
Latin twisted and twisted it worse in trying to untangle his mess.
Not exactly a shark in “Math.", but he tried hard. A well-
meaning fellow who occasionally gets in wrong but doesn't
know it, so what's the difference.

EMILY MAE THOMSON,
Sewickley High School.

Our willowy co-ed, who in some faint way reminds us of Mrs.
Eddy. Occasionally dons nose glasses to enhance her slender
beauty, and to aid her in detecting germs in Bugology. A good
hand at tea serving, and will probably eke out a superlatively
happy existence, drinking tea, with Tabby sunning herself some-
where while Miss Thomson ponders on the psychology of a
dreamy soul.

CHARLES KNAPP W'I-IITE,
Curry College.

Originator of the Graphite Method of Analysis in Doc. Vogt’s
class. His personal appearance is directly opposite to his
character. Quite strenuous, and argues with the aid of a chair,
which he throws skillfully. Possessed with the idea that he is
one of Wooly Horse's colts, and acts accordingly.

LAURETTA MAY YOHN,
Avalon High School.

The maid who hates to part with her conversation, _and when
she does so, her tones are almost apologetic. A late edition of a
Quaker maid, a female member of the affinity agency, and a
friend of “Ruby” Marshall. Too innocent to appreciate Davis’
class jokes, too shy to speak above a whisper, how ever will she
be able to teach?

CHARLES BENNETT FISHER,

Washington, D. C., High School.
Debating Club.
Class Foot-ball (1) (2).

The original Bert Williams and Joe Gans combined. Now
you see him and now you don't. Came from the city of
Senators. A “capito1" fellow. Studies by ﬁts and starts,
principally starts. Never heard of a poker game and doesn't
know what a crap game is. Is pompous and terrible good
looking when dressed up. We haVen’t found out yet whether
he is to be a preacher or a doctor. We think preaching would
give him more satisfaction. Owns a bad bull that kicks.

JOSEPH LLOYD CANNON,

Intercollegiate Debate 1910.

Joe is some ﬁnancier; he tries all of Doc. Holdsworth’s theories
and some of his own, and consequently, can get more money and
use less than any other fellow in college. A debater under
Alan Davis,‘ and quite an admirer of that young dramatist.
Aspires to become a great lawyer, just like “Uncle Joe.”

SAUL CHERSKY,

Pittsburgh High School.
Pitt Forensic Society.

McCrady’s better half and the hero of Wylie Avenue. Is a
socialist, an anarchist, a nihilist and everything else “ist.”
Hates money and is exceedingly generous. Is an attorney in
embryo with Abe Ruff as his ideal. By hard study and other
means he will be in this year's graduating class.

ALBERT D. FROST, EX

Pittsburgh High School.
Glee Club (1) (2) (3).
President Class (1).

Mother’s own son, but unlike mother, Ab was not made to be
an engineer. He knew it, and wisely switched to Economics.
Commercial German is his forte, and some day he will probably
be our business representative at Berlin. Albert was our
freshman king and managed pretty nearly everything during
his “fresh” year. Club dances and school hops keep him
"Broke.” It isn't always good to be too popular.

HARRY WHITE LEONARD, <1>Z<1»

East Liverpool High School.

Class Secretary and Treasurer (1).

Treasurer of Class Memorial Fund.
Editor in Chief of 1912 Owl.

Called Purity by those who know him. He would be good
looking if it were not for his face, which was bad enough before
Christmas, but which is the worst ever since Santa Claus brought
that misﬁt hair—cut. For proof see picture opposite this write~up.
Came from somewhere down in Ohio, spends his time at the theatre
and writing letters even a little further than Ohio. Has periodic
reforms which never last very long at a time. Believes in dry
towns and with Stewart thinks himself special missionary to
Wylie Avenue. Was a gentleman till he became editor of the
Owl.

ROLAND ALLEN MCCRADY, <I>Z<I>

Edgewood High School.
Secretary and Treasurer Pitt Forensic Society.

The three quickest ways to transmit news are:~telephone,
telegraph and——tel McCrady. The last way named is much the
quickest, and better still, is absolutely gratuitous. A good
boy at home, but a dead one with the women. VVants to be a
lawyer and wear dirty shoes all his life. Got the sociological
hammer from Rufus D. about a year ago, and has been using it
on everything sociological and unsociological. If you want to
know your faults, how to overcome them, and how to become
great—ask McCrady.

ADAM EDWIN PAFF, EX

Beaver Falls High School.

Captain Freshmen Basket«l)all Team.

The fashion—plate of the college. Ad. believes in mixing
plenty of social life with his college course, and Very frequently
goes to Beaver Falls besides. Paff started as an engineer,
but after two years work, decided to enter the School of Eco-
nomics where he would have more time to read popular novels.
An omnivorous reader and an interesting chap, who will shortly
realize that he has a good share of gray matter and will use it.

RICHARD SHARP PATERSON, q>Ao

Conway Hall.
Dickinson College.
Owl Boai-d~Economics.

Became a son of Pitt at the opening of the fall term. Came
from Dickinson, where as far as we can learn, he was a part
of “It” at least. Brought with him Mrs. Paterson. No, not
his mother—his wife. We who know his personality and charms
can readily understand this. Has the honor and distinction of
being the first Owl Editor of the School of Economics. In all
other respects he is a student and a gentleman.

Jack is a slow-going, big-hearted fellow who shows a staunch
loyalty to his frat. Almost a victim of McKown’s practical
political methods, but managed to come out on top by a_ safe
margin. The only thorns in ]ack's freshman bed of roses were
theme-writing and P. S. He managed to get rid of his thorns
and blossomed forth as an energetic chairman of the “Prom”
committee, and a good business manager. Large, good-looking,
and not so slow with certain belles.

This unassuming looking chap is Frank Calvin Stewart,
(known to some as Stewart Calvin), the Editor in Chief of the
Pitt Weekly. Besides all this he is oﬂicial executioner of the
Queen's English and the cause of all weekly editorials. Has
brains at times and wants brains at other times. He used to
have a failing for Yiddish queens but since he got wisdom at
Minerva (0.), he has cut out everything rough. For a hot
reply to this opinion of ours, see the Pitt Weekly—$1.5O per year.

AMOS HAROLD BANNISTER, A211

Beaver Falls High School.
Glee Club (1) (2).
E 19

C. .— ..
Class Foot-ball (1) (2).

The possessor of a remarkable voice; sounds like a boiler
factory. A real soldier under Joe Thompson, and a special
friend of Alec, the late Doc. Marshall, and of the Dean. A
preacher’s son, which is his only recommendation. He loves
to attend picnics, especially on the North Side.

WALTER AIKEN BELL, A2211
Y. M. C. A.

To those who don't know him Bell is a good fellow. To those
who do know him he is a better fellow. Quiet, industrious,
and conservative, Bell makes one of the balance wheels on the
more riotous elements in the class. When anything is to be
done Bell is “Johnny on the spot.” When anything goes wrong
Bell is the man who ﬁxes it up. We Can’t say enough for him.
Why? Well—get acquainted with him, then you will know.

GEORGE LOVE COYLE, ATA
Shady Side Academy.

Another hard working over-worked engineer. Has a fondness
for Presbyterian preachers, hard mathematics and P. C. W.
If you want to see him blush (and by the way he blushes beauti—
fully) twit him about P. C. W. You see “he has known her since
she was about so high.” This is about all we know as he never
says anything himself and we don’t know anyone who knows him.

LESTER D. ELLIS,
Sheraden High School.

Ellis is this year's recruit. Says little but likes rough-house.
We think he would go lady fussing if he were coaxed. Has a
merry twinkle in his eye and a terrible grip with his hand. Gets
excited every now and then and dances around the smoking
room like a bear-cat. We are waiting till he gets “sore" to
learn whether or no he uses profanity. We hope that he doesn’t
because in all other respects he is such a nice boy.

JOHN WILSON WISHART HALLOCK,

Vice President Y. M. C. A. (3).
Glee Club (1) (2).

Debating Team (2).

Manager Courant (2).

Junior Prom. Com.

Assistant Manager Glee Club (2).
Class Foot-ball (2).

John Wilson Wishart Hallock. If any fond parent in Penn-
sylvania wishes to honor a distant relative but does not wish to
burden his new born babe, he can honor the aforesaid distant
relative by getting into communication with John, who will
gladly and gratuitously accept any and all extra names. Not-
withstanding his name he is a pretty good fellow. Is the big
noise in all S. S. and Y. M. C. A. meetings and the driest of the
drugs at Temperance conferences. Besides being a Sunday
School singer he is also a Glee club warbler and a member of
Berger's Choir. Next to Leonard the purest man in school.

TAKEO Hmoxr,

Tokio University.

This gentleman is not German. No! Neither is he French.
No~He’s Irish as one can plainly deduce from his picture and
his name. Is studying engineering and intends to go back to
his native country as a boxer engineer. Is moral—never swears
(P) Is conscientious—never gambles (?) and always goes to
Chapel (P) From these last remarks you see what a jewel we
have in Hiroki.

EARNEST A. MILLER, AEII
Traverse City High School.

Of Traverse City we know little, and of Traverse High School
we know less, but of Miller we know much more than we ought
to. If we would tell all we knew we’d be foolish and Miller
would feel worse. Just a little though to let you know what
kind of a boy he is. Spooch is a runner and will run from every-
thing except a co-ed; in the case of co-eds, however, he proves
himself a man ready to ﬁght and not to run. He is a poet, and
newspaper man, a gentleman, a scholar, and a judge of good
whiskey. Aside from this he is Campbell's right hand man and
Oscar's star on the track. If all the West is as good as Miller
we would like to import several hundred of the “wild and wooleys”
to our section of the country.

RICHARD MUNTZ, AA
Butler High School.

The fellow townsman of Karl J. Holliday and yet a gentleman.
Came from Butler and eternally going back to Butler. For this
we never knew the reason till the Junior Prom, but since we have
seen her we can readily understand. Muntz is a good fellow
and taking into consideration the fact that heis an engineer he is
an exceptionally good fellow, would that he were of the College.
Never too busy to help a friend, never too bright to make a
dumb one feel bad, never too poor to pay his debts. Muntz
is one of our best.

WILLIAM LYLE MCDANIEL, EX

Wilkinsburg High School.

Pitt Weekly.
Assistantship—Surveying.

Class Foot-ball Team.
Class Basket-ball Team.

One of those engineers who has accomplished the seemingly
impossible, he has gone three years without a ﬂunk. Mac is a
hard student, but is able to take a large part in our little attempts
at society, and sings in the Glee Club. A sort of student fore-
man of his little engineering corps, and dispenser of Chicago
“parlor” stories. May frequently be seen in the locker room
explaining some intricate problem to a hard—pated classmate.

WILLIAM OLIVER McCLUS_KY, JR., A211

Wheeling High School.
Glee Club (1) (2).
Student Senate.

Sports a smile that won’t come off and has golden hair. Real
cherubic, and imagines that his cuteness makes a hit with the
ladies, whom he continually bothers. Domiciled with Berger
last year, and assimilated all “Der Kaiser's” German, becoming
quite a shark. An adept at ﬁxing up his room to receive “ Dad."

LEWIS WEDSEL MCINTYRE,

Pittsburg High School.
Y. M. C. A.

Class Baseball (1).
Track-Team (3).

Hoot‘ Mon! Th’ uncanny Scot. Has the prettiest lips, the
reddest cheeks and the babiest blue eyes in school. An en-
gineer Who studies. Can do any problem that Bankson can.
Eats geology and drinks hydraulics. Has spirit but no spirits.
Goes to every athletic contest with two arm-bands and a pennant
and goes home afterwards. Curses at times but never violently.
Always good natured but seldom effusive. In short~a credit
to Pittsburgh High and a getter of credits at Pitt.

ROBERT POST, A2 H

W. & J. Academy.
W. & J. College.

Of Post we are not well posted. If you will look at his picture
you will see that he is good looking, but you will not be able to
see his sparkling brown eyes,his cupid—like curling ringlets or his
valentine day smile. Is a Delta Sig and like the other Delta Sigs
is a hustler. Of his past we know nothing, but we imagine that
he had one, can be found at odd times in the locker room and can
be heard at noon time eating his lunch. Is author of the famous
treat easy, “Would She or Why She didn’t.” Seems to be
bright but never studies, looks as though he were a ladies’ man,
but was never seen with anything like a skirt hanging on him.
We stop for lack of space.

JOSEPH GEORGE RICHARDSON, AEII

Allegheny High School.

Class Treasurer (3).
Associate Editor of 1912 Owl.
Class Foot~ball (1) (2).

The most mercurious individual in the School of Engineering
A rough—houser from the beginning to the end. Ought to be
a Sophomore all his life. Pitt's champion Freshman trainer.
Guarantees to make the wildest specimen eat out of his hand
in three days’ time. Chews plug, smokes Wheelings and Wears
rough—neck shirts. Has a gentle side, though, and when the
occasion demands, can be a Beau Brummel with the skirts.
Has a good sense of humor and a laugh that advertises itself.

RALPH HAROLD SMITH,

Pittsburg Academy.
Civil Engineering Society.

If silence is golden, Ralph is a rich man. He is absolutely the
quietest fellow in school. Never makes a noise, never talks,
and recites only occasionally. Rooted at the Carlisle game
last year, but was almost arrested. so Smith again relapsed into
a silence which has yet to be broken.

WALTER RAYMOND STERN, EX

Allegheny High School.
Pittsburg Academy.

Civil Engineering Society.
Student Senate (3).

Class Foot-ball (1) (2).
Class Basketball (1).

Another good-looking athletic engineer.

Walt has developed a mania for work, and is really doing a
tremendous amount of studying. Has the unique faculty of
making the Prof. believe by his looks that he knows something
and hence pulls easily many A's that other fellows strive in
vain to get. Promoter of chaperonless hops; unwittingly
of course. Wears a worried look at exam. time, but is never
an “also ran.” Bosom friend of McDaniels, and chum of Les
Taylor’s.

DAVID EDWIN TAYLOR, AA

Freeport High School.
Civil Engineering Society.
Class Vice President (3).

The only engineer who does not dance. Formerly was a
devoted admirer of Lady Nicotine, but since a pretty girl has
come into his life, Dave has given up his little “Nic”. For
two years Taylor rested, but he has lately developed an un-
looked for spurt of energy, and has shown the “stuff.”

LESTER MILTON TAYLOR, EX

Pittsburg Academy.

Cap and Gown Club.

Glee Club.

Secretary of Cap and Gown Club.

The life of the party, wherever he may be, Les would rather
tell a joke than eat,~and he has a large appetite. A budding
Victor Herbert whose “Hail to Pitt” will live long. His only
enemy is Chemistry, which he ﬁnally vanquished after three
rounds. Loves to talk about “my car.” Ardent admirer of
musical comedy and eomediennes from Blanche Ring up, or
down.

HOMER GLEN WILCOX,
Zanesville High School.
Y. M C A

Assist'ant.ship—-Physics Laboratory.
Track Team (2).

Yost’s running mate. Has a ﬁnely developed set of jaw
muscles acquired from biting pennies in half to make the exact
change. Is an amateur photographer of no mean ability. His
specialty is portrait work of females whose hearts he has broken.
Was once reported to have spent a quarter but we have our
doubts. In his Freshman year he was the star patron of the
Sophomore barber shop. Will go out of his way to do a deed
and all in all is a Very good fellow.

SAMUEL DUNLAP EVERHART, JR.,

Pittsburgh High School.
Glee Club.

A quiet youth with an Apollo like bearing. Says little and
eats much. Knows all about P. C. W. and is on intimate terms
with everyone there including the principal, the cook and the
cat. Is a Quaker in tastes and prefers Gray to anything else.
In spite of his retiring disposition and general Coyness he is
quite a favorite with the ladies. Too bad for them though, as
Sam is already a “near family man." Has musical aspirations

, which spend themselves in Glee Club Harmony. Is fond of

Glee Club trips, but does not approve of some practices in-
dulged in upon such vacations. Was once caught teaching Fresh-
men the Sunday School lesson.

Wilkinsburg High School.

In the same class with Murray.

EDGAR R. I-IILL,

Edgar has a poetic name, but we have missed our

poetry even in the work of an engineer if we know
where to ﬁnd it.

“ Mike” hails from “ N'Yawk” but we shall overlook
that fact.

JOHN BYRON McCANN,

GEORGE M. BEVIER,
Carnegie Technical Schools.

The handsome blushing young man opposite this gem of rhe-
toric is Mr. Bevier, who went to Carnegie Tech when he was
young and did not know any better, but when he got to be a
man he put away childish things and came to Pitt. Of his
habits we know nothing except that he is quite modest, bashful
and unassuming. Studies hard at times and not quite so hard
at other times, has an ambition to be a mining engineer, knows
all about mines and to some girl say—Mine. As to when this
time shall come it is nearly a matter of speculation. From
present indications it will not be very soon. Has no bad habits,
except going to the Gayety and wanting to take Gayety girls to
dinner, were it not for this he might be a preacher.

JAMES CLARENCE MACKRELL, JR., <I>Z<I>

Pittsburgh High School.

Mandolin Club (1) (2) (3)

Class Base~ball.

Varsity Track Team.

Captain and Manager Varsity Tennis Team (2).

Member Tennis Association.

Intercollegiate Single Tennis Champion of Western Penna.

Rich men own ﬂats. Blondy’s father owns ﬂats. Therefore,
Blondy’s father is rich. Rich men's sons raise
Blondy is a rich man’s son. Therefore, Blondy raises————~.
There you have it in a nut-shell. The only true sport, social
climber and jolly gambler in the class. Plays tennis and throws
rouglets by nature. Can out dance anything in Pittsburg
except a Bell telephone girl. Knows the social columns in the
newspaper for ten years back and can describe any dress that
any “ladies " wore on any occasion. Spends money like a drum-
mer and sometimes pays his bills. Is also some ﬁddler.

UPENDRA NATH ROY,

Barisal High Scho0l—Bengal, India.
Dacca School of Engineering.

A son of India and hot one. Was never short enough to wear
short trousers. Is so tall that he has to use a block and tackle
to control his feet. His great height is due to his early training
on an Indian farm picking fruit off rubber trees. Is now peti-
tioning the U. S. Senate to pass a law making the minimum
height of mine chambers eleven feet. One of the features at
the annual Track meet will be a 220 yard run between Roy and
Luther. Is also sueing the City of Pittsburgh for building the
sidewalks so far away from him.

IRA HAROLD WYNNE,

Cvlennwillard.
Class Foot-ball '08, '09.

Ira is a nice boy, but he has “a awful temper." Hits ﬁrst
and thinks later. Never known to hunt a scrap, but also never
known to get out of the way of one. Smiles and swears, but
never swears and smiles. Looks like a lady's man but is de-
cidedly not one. We predict a great future for him as a mining
boss beating Dagoes and breaking Slavish heads. Is also a man
of some heart, a statesman and a politician, and recently came
within one vote of being elected to The Student Senate.

RAYMOND G. YOST,
Pittsburgh High School.

The Fortune Hunter. Quite a fusser, but always has the
materialistic side in view. Friend of the Freshmen co-eds for
about a month every year, and then he searches for new victims.
Once treated a maid to a lunch. Yost exceeded the limit in
Mother's Mechanics class, and knows more German than Berger.
A good hearted fellow, at that, and he'll learn a few things from
the world that he can't learn in college.
