Elmer A. Holbrook

To a man who has spent
over half a century in his
chosen field, forty of those
years being in the realm of
Engineering Education, the
1950-1951 Owl is most re-
spectfully dedicated.

It is fitting that tl1e Mid-
century Uwl be dedicated
to Dr. Elmer Allen Hol-
brook, former_Dea11 of the
School of Engineering and
hlines, for it is at the half-
ceiitury mark that Dr. Hol-
brook retires from active
service with the llniversity
after 33 years as Dean. His
departure is, however, a
physical one only, for the
elfer-/t of Dean Holbrook’s
friendly smile and his stable,
progressive leadership can
not be erased from the
minds of his s‘tude1e1ts and
colleagues.

It was a fortunate acci—
dent that brought the [Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh the
beneﬁts of Dr. Holbrook’s
educational philosophies.
After a period of engineering
work in l\Iexico a11d Nova
Scotia, l)r. Holbrook was
asked to ﬁll in for an ab-
sentee professor of mining
engineering at the Nova
Scotia Technical College.
This was in 1910, and Dr.

THOSE
BIG
DAYS

STUDENTS CELEBRATE
0H|0 STATE VICTORY

Dear Senior:

The following three pages were torn from the
1948, ’49, and ’50 Owls. They should represent
to the seniors their four years at Pitt. Page 107
shows part of the great celebration when we
beat Ohio State back in 1948. The celebration
started at a big Victory rally at Soldiers and
Sailors Memorial Hall, and ended up down-
town by the Way of Tech, P.C.VV. and Du-
quesne. For page 108 we tore a spring festival
page from the 19419 Owl. This was the ﬁrst
time that the carnival was held on the Campus.
It was a lot of hard work setting up those
tents and booths, but the fun everyone had
was worth it. Page 109 we borrowed from the
1950 book. It is the Pitt players page of the
play Julius Caesar. The play toured some of
the High Schools in Western Penna. It was one
of the most successful productions that the
players have enjoyed in their history. The
Owl always stops one year of life for you, but
this year the ’51 Owl wanted to flash back on
these pages to show you some of your life at
Pitt in the last four years.

Leizer Balk
Editor, 1951 Owl

The Cathedral Lawn becomes a carnival lot as tents and booths take the place of ‘Keep off the Grass’ signs.

Carnival . . . Float Parade . . . Tap Day

Spring F estiVal—climaX of months of planning,
weeks of preparation, and days and nights spent in con-
structing booths and ﬂoats, collecting equipment, and
adding the last-minute touches that made Spring F es-
tival 1949 a really extra-special one. Campus organiza-
tions had put months into the planning of ﬂoat themes,
sideshows, and concessions; fraternity and sorority
house backyards bloomed with crepe paper creations
that were soon transplanted to the campus to compete
for ﬂoat honors and cash customers. By day the campus
rang with the sounds of hammers and saws; at night it
rocked to the hoarse cries of barkers and the laughter
of the crowds. Mayor Lawrence and Pa Pitt helped
review and judge the Float Parade andatrio of cartoonist

ists showed up to add to the fun of the Carnival. Tap
Day saw another name added to ODK Walk as Frank-
lin Blackstone topped four years of campus leadership
with the coveted honorary award. Months of suspense
ended as Barbara Schropp and Lenore Mussoﬂ’ were an-
nounced as Senior Queen and Alma Mater. The Owl
Hall of Fame opened its doors to another group of
honored students, while the Dipping of the Spoon
marked the choice of Junior and Senior Worthies. Cam-
pus honoraries tapped new members as Tap Day came
to a close. Rounding out the week, Pitt Players packed
Stephen Foster Hall with ‘Dark of the Moon,’ then
ended its successful season with awards to its leading
members.

 

Franklin Blackstone, Barbara Schropp, and Lenore Mussoff share
Pitt’s highest awards as ODK Awardee, Senior Queen, and Alma
Mater.

JULIUS CAESAR

At rehearsal, the conspirators, Victor Vallecorsa, Robert S. Whitman, The ghost of Caesar (John Ingrim) appears before Brutus
Melvin Silver, Richard Costanza, Ben Tatar, John Sturgeon, and (Richard Costanza) while Lucius (Gloria Brodie) sleeps.
Walter Kruse, “stoop and wash in the blood of Caesar.”

The citizens Watch spellbound as the conspirators, led by Brutus (Richard Costanza)
carry out their plan of murdering Caesar.

The dental clinic is constantly busy.

The University of Pittsburgh School of Dentistry
came into existence April 90, 1896 as the Pittsburgh
Dental College, with 118 matriculants. The ﬁrst
building on the present campus was dedicated in
1912. It has been renovated for preclinical dental
instruction and has been thoroughly ﬁtted with the
most modern and improved equipment and teaching
apparatus. The school is a member of the American
Association of Dental Schools. Each year thousands
of patients are treated in the Inﬁrmary. In addition,
outside clinics have been established at various insti-
tutions of the county, such as the F alk Clinic Senior
students who show marked ability are assigned to
this special work. The Dental Library and Museum,
with their extensive collections of periodicals and
books, occupy spacious quarters in the Old Mellon
Institute Building. The main objectives of the School
of Dentistry are to train students in the diagnosis,
treatment and prevention of oral diseases, and to
enable them to meet eﬁectively the responsibilities
of dental practice. The School also aims to provide
extra-curricular relationships for the students. Four
national dental fraternities have chapters at Pitt.
Psi Omega, Delta Sigma Delta, Xi Psi Phi, and
Alpha Omega. Representatives of these groups make
up the Dental Inter-Fraternity Council, which serves
as a vital part in maintaining harmonious relations
between their respective fraternities. Faculty ad-
visers of the fraternities also serve as advisers to the
council. The Dental Alumni Association is composed
of graduates of the University of Pittsburgh Dental
School. Social and instructional functions are given
by the organization. The School of Dentistry is
headed by Dean Lawrence E. Van Kirk.

LAW
The University of Pittsburgh School of Law
has been in continuous function since 1895,
when Dean John D. Shafer organized a de-
partment of legal instruction, known originally
as the Pittsburgh Law School. The Faculty
was composed entirely of members of the Bench
and Bar who gave a part of their time to legal
instruction. The present faculty represents a
combination of members of the practicing Bar
with a group of legal scholars and teachers. The
School of Law had its quarters in downtown
Pittsburgh until 1936, when, in keeping with
the policy of integrating the School was pro-
vided with spacious quarters in the Cathedral,
and a Law Library of approximately 34,000
volumes. Contrary to popular belief, a prelegal
course is not prescribed. In the choice of courses,
the students are guided by their aptitudes and
interests. Habits of close, critical and sustained
study are the important factors, no matter
what the subjects taken are. All students of the
Law School are members of a Student Bar
Association,which, through an elected executive
council, coordinates student extra-curricular
activities. It sponsors social and athletic affairs
and Regional Conferences of law students.
Through the Student Bar Association, in co-
operation With the Faculty, legal arguments
are conducted in which all students are given
opportunities to participate. Such work is re—
quired for ﬁrst year students. The year 1950-
1951 found close to 300 students attending the

University of Pittsburgh School of Law. Under
the direction of Dean Charles B. Nutting, the
School has passed another year in proflucing
lawyers Worthy of membership to the Bar.

First year law School Students are initiated into Uiidergrads don't even know what the inside of :1
library looks like!

The basic aim of the University of Pittsburgh
School of Medicine is to properly prepare the
student for the practice of scientiﬁc medicine;
that is, to help him learn and carry out his
‘obligations toward his patient and his profes-
sion. Two buildings, situated on the University
campus, house the various leading departments
of the School of Medicine. Here the student
receives his ﬁrst two years of instruction.
Training in the last two years of the medical
course is entirely of a clinical nature and is
conducted in various Oakland hospitals com-
prising the University Medical Center. Stu-
dents at the School of Medicine have the fa-
cilities of a general medical library and various
departmental libraries. Also, medical students
are permitted to enjoy the University’s thor-
oughly equipped gym and athletic ﬁeld, both of
which are situated very near the School of
Medicine building. In order to make student
bonds stronger, a Students’ Medical Society
was formed in 1925, “to stimulate an active in-
terest in the educational aspect of medicine,
and to promote fellowship by providing a
common meeting place for all the students.”
The Society holds quarterly scientiﬁc meetings
at which papers of medical interest written by
the students are read. In addition, the organi-
zation is the sponsor for various social activ-
ities. This year the Medical School has engaged
in an extensive program in the ﬁeld of psychi-
atry, conducted under William S. McEllroy.
The School continues to look forward to greater
advances in medical research, especially with
the demands being made upon medical men in
the present emergency. The School of Medicine
will fulﬁll its obligations to its community, not
only in this troubled mid-century, but in the
peaceful years to come.

The Student-Faculty Nursing Association is
organized on the basis of close cooperation of
the student body and faculty. It is the organi-
zation through Which the students have an
opportunity to share in the consideration of
common problems. Nominations for various
special committees are made from the Student-
Faculty group to discuss and act upon affairs of
an economic, social, and ﬁnancial nature. Tra-
ditional functions of the School are the Capping
Ceremony, held at the end of the preclinical
period, Black Banding at the beginning of the
senior year, the Florence Nightingale Service
which is a religious ceremony for the nursing
school of the Medical Center held at Heinz
Chapel, and Pinning which marks the comple-
tion of the basic professional program. In
addition to these traditional functions, a wide
Variety of social affairs is held. Officers for the
year of 1950 were: Joan Hill, president; Nancy
Glazier, Vice president; Sylvia Trumpeter,
secretary-treasurer; Gladys Cowdne, Nancy
Gould, and Janet Pattison, Nursing Council.

Student nurses agree cat anatomy can
be a fascinating subject.

Down on the Boulevard of Allies is a red
brick building bearing University of Pittsburgh
School of Pharmacy. In these times of unrest
the School of Pharmacy is moving along to-
wards the goal of providing more and better
trained Pharmacists. Under the tutelage of
Dean Edward C. Rief the school saw many
new improvements during 1950-51. The new
dispensing laboratory, the new drug com-
pounding department and a new research lab-
oratory for pharmacy work were set up. Large
shipments of new equipment arrived to aug-
ment the new departments already set up. For
the people already graduated from the school,
new graduate courses have been set up for their
help in earning masters degrees in three de-
partments of Pharmacy The American Phar-
maceutical Association’s student branch at
Pitt again provided the pharmacy students
with their necessary link with the practicing
ﬁeld. Many interesting seminars, speakers and
social events ﬁlled needs of pharmacy students.
The Pitt Capsule with Stan Swartz and Dom
Parlavecchio as co-editors and Dr. E. P. Claus
as adviser turned out the monthly edition of a
publication presenting various items about the
pharmacy ﬁeld, and the activities and the stu-
dent life of the campus. Even though the phar-
macy school is located so far from the immediate
Pitt campus the students have been taking
some of their courses on the campus proper.
Owing to this fact they are represented on both
the Student Congress and Men’s Council
governing boards. They also have their own
student council with Eli Rebich as president
this year. Gradually the School of Pharmacy
has been moving towards its rightful position
on the campus. Established in 1896 in conjunc-
tion with the University, it has progressed
rapidly since becoming an actual part of the
school in 1948. Perhaps the new half-century
will ﬁnd the School of Pharmacy acquiring its
place on the Oakland campus.

Their remedies are more eﬂ’ective than Hadacol.

Mortar and pestle mark the pharmacy student.

BUREAU RETAIL TRAINING  

Bishop Brown

1951 Class in Retail Training

134

In stores from Montreal to Miami, from Seattle to
San Antonio, from the Golden Triangle to the Golden
Gate, graduates of the University of Pittsburgh’s
Retail Bureau hold important executive jobs. This is
no accident. Pittsburgh is unexcelled as a city of
department stores, perfect laboratory for ambitious
young men and women who choose retailing as a
career Founded in 1918 and encouraged by Pitts-
burgh merchants, the retail Bureau has grown and
kept pace with the development of retailing. The
graduate school of retailing trains a selected group
of students, and the research division’s studies cover
a wide Variety of retail merchandising and operating
problems. The Bureau’s one—year graduate course
prepares students for responsible executive positions
in buying, advertising, fashion and personnel. In
addition to classroom work, the students get experi-
ence doing practical work in the downtown depart-
ment stores and get paid for it. The Director of the
Research Bureau is Professor Bishop Brown. Direc-
tor Brown has been associated with the Bureau since
1929, and has been its Director since 1936.

Murals provide a colorful background
for relaxation in the 19th floor lounge.

The Bureau class is limited to approxi-
mately 100 graduate students with a keen
interest in retailing. For this reason, and
because its offices and classrooms are
all located on the 19th and 20th ﬂoors of
the Cathedral of Learning, the Bureau is
in effect a small school within a very large
one. Consequently, students get well ac-
quainted with each other and talk shop
not only in the classroom but in the spa-
cious student lounge between and after
classes. An important focal point of the
Bureau’s indoor campus is the library.
This beautifully panelled room contains
the most complete collection of books and
periodicals dealing with retail subjects in
the world. It is in almost constant use
during the day and several evenings a
week. The tempo of life at the Bureau
reaches its peak in mid-April when an en-
tire week is set aside for placement inter-
views. Representatives from 35 to 40 re-
tail organizations visit the school at this
time to interview the students for jobs.
As a result, most of the class are placed
before graduation.

1_& future business executive, ﬁnds the
library a source of useful information.

Retail Bureau students exchange pleasantries
with amiable Mrs. Clark, the librarian.

Captain Thomas Hamilton

Frank Carver

ATHLETIC
DEPARTMENT

In his three years as Director of Athletics, Thomas J.
Hamilton has done a great deal to further Pitt sports, but
the one-time Navy officer is still hopefully eyeing the future
for a successful Pitt sports year.

This past season was not a bright one for the energetic
Hamilton, with his football and basketball teams record-
ing dismal seasons. With his major attractions failing,
however, Hamilton can turn with pride to his “minor”
interests which he has been building up since the beginning
of his administration. All of these Pitt teams performed
creditably against highly-rated competitors.

Among other things, the big, six-foot athletic director
has also been busy on the national football scene. He was
appointed chairman of the NCAA Television Committee,
which made a study of TV effect on football attendance.

With the advent of the Korean War, Hamilton, always
a great believer in physical conditioning, has proposed a
program to Chancellor Fitzgerald which calls for an every
day gym program for all male students.

    

William Heyman

Still in the same seat that he has occupied for the last
seventeen years, sits Frank Carver, genial Graduate
l\Ianager of Athletics. Through his efforts, Pitt sports
have always been well represented on the sports pages.
VVithout the smiling Carver batting out publicity releases,
Pitt sports would be lost. 3

Aiding Carver in his growing pile of work, is an eX—news-
paper reporter, Bill Heyman. VVilly has eased Carver’s
burden which has grown with the increase of interest and
popularity of the so-called “minor” sports—wrestling,
swimming, track, etc. Even with terrible records compiled
by the football and basketball teams, Pitt was never
berated on the sports pages of local newspapers, mainly
because Carver and Heyman refused to make excuses or
moan to reporters. Information, when available, was
never withheld, or made hard to get.

The work of the duo is greatly appreciated by the
administration, student body, and publications.

VARSITY
FOOTBALL

Everyone was optimistic in the spring. Even though
nineteen lettermen from last year’s varsity squad were
lost through graduation, there was a promising group of
freshmen coming up. And wasn’t the majority of the great
line back from a great season which had given Pitt a ﬁne
6 and 3 record against some of the best teams in the
country?

Yes, the Pitt line would almost be intact. The only
trouble, the coaches moaned, would be lack of depth and
experience in the backﬁeld. The probable backﬁeld starting
lineup during the spring training program appeared to be
an all-junior quintet. Of course, there was an added handi-
cap of a new system. When Len Casanova came from Santa
Clara in sunny California he brought with him his T-for-
mation that had made him so successful there. This meant,
of course, a switch from the deep-rooted single wing that
had so long been part of the Panther gridiron history.

But it was spring, and everything looked rosy, even with
the murderous schedule to look forward to. Some skeptics

three of their games, but the enthusiasts that watched
practice had that "just-you-wait-and-see” attitude.

When the Panther squad reported for fall practice at
Meadville, Pa. the gridders settled down to work with the
realization of a bigger battle starting out in the Paciﬁc.
Almost immediately, the Korean situation took effect
on the Pitt squad, when the Marines put reservist Mike
Omatick on active duty. Coach Casanova lost a ﬁrst rate
defense man and a fullback.

It wasn’t long before the Leathernecks hit again, and
this time it really hurt. Paul Chese, appearing set for the
ﬁrst-string offensive fullback slot, after a ﬁne showing
during the latter part of the previous season and during
spring training, was called to active duty. Chess, one of

J. V. FOOTBALL

Although coach Steve Peto’s Jay Vee squad failed to
turn in a perfect record as did the F rosh, its 1950 season
must be considered a success. The team’s record of two
wins and one loss was almost. a complete reversal of its
1949 mark when it lost all of its games. Early in the
season, while at full strength, the Jay Vees defeated
Ohio State and Geneva. Against a truly great Army
team though, Pitt had very lit.tle chance. Playing with
only 22 men, coach Petro was forced to use several
linemen in the backﬁeld when two of four backs were
injured. “Army was really terriﬁc.” Petro was quick
to add, “They were easily the best “B” team we saw
all year. Their boys were too big and strong and we
just couldn’t take the punishment they dealt out.”

During the course of the season several boys were
promoted to the Varsity. These boys were: Jim Jen-
nings, Fred Osterhout, Frank Guadagnino, Bill Ewing,
and Sam DeFede.

Standout ball players for the Jay Vees all season
before being promoted were: Joe Kurtik, a 6-0, a
190 pound sophomore halfback; Joe O’Bara, a 5-8, 1'75
pound senior halfback; Gene Dolﬁ, a 6-1, 190 pound
tackle.

FROSH FOOTBALL

Judging from the record of last year’s undefeated
Freshman football team, this year’s Varsity should
once again be among the national leaders. However,
the critical international situation makes any deﬁnite
planning by the coaches practically impossible. It is
quite possible that the athletes most heavily counted
on will be the armed forces come football season. Then
too, Athletic Publicity Director Frank Carver reminds,
“The jump from Freshman ball to the Varsity is mighty
big—a lot bigger than most people realize. Some of the
boys just don’t make it.”

Constant standout performers for coaches Johnny
Chickerneo and Web Forsyth were: Dick Dietricks, a
6-4, 210 pound end who catches passes with the aid of
contact lenses; halfback Lou Cimarolli, 5-9, 170 pound
breakaway runner from nearby Bridgeville; Bobby
Epps, a powerful, quick-starting fullback who stands
5-10 and weighs 190 pounds; and Art DiGiovanni, also
a back, but whose specialty is place—kicking. His ﬁeld h Ch. k
goal against Army provided the winning margin. J0 11 1° emeo

CROSS COUNTRY

The Pitt Cross-Country - team, coached by Carl
Olson, had their ups and downs during a most grueling
season.

The harriers got off to a good start by capturing a
triangular meet with VVestrninster and Geneva and
then outran Slippery Rock.

After losing to Penn State on the Schenley Park course,
they easily_beat Case at Case. But from there on in the
going was rough. The “Cindermen” lost to Ohio State,
Notre Dame, and came in second in a triangular meet
with Army and Pennsylvania.

close one to Geneva 76

TENNIS

Pitt’s 1950 tennis edition failed to accomplish last
season’s mark of eleven wins and two losses as they
compiled a disappointing six and four record.

The loss of two regulars may have caused this
downward trend in tennis, but the return of lettermen
John Lohstoeter, Bob Silberstein, and Al Margus gave
the Panthers a strong foundation upon which to build.

Sophomores Harry Campney and Jim Boyd moved
into varsity roles. Campney compiled a near perfect
record, his lone loss coming in the Navy match. Loh—
stoeter proved another consistent winner for the Pan-
thers as he only dropped two of his ten matches.

Top doubles combination in the squad was the all-
victorious Lohstoeter-Campney duo.

TRACK

Pitt in 1950 was well represented in track; the oldest
of sports. Coach Carl Olson’s tracksters were charac-
terized by a readiness to work and a will to win.

The Pitt team copped all three of its dual meets,
downing lVIiami, Ohio University, and Notre Dame.
In the latter meet the “cindermen” helped to prove
the old adage “every little bit helps” by upsetting
Notre Dame 652/3 to 65%. This consummated the
ﬁrst victory for Pitt over N otre Dame in any sport in
the past 13 years.

Pitt’s only loss was to Penn State in a triangular
meet with the Staters and West Virginia University.

Pitt was also represented in several invitational
meets, among them the Penn Relays and the IC4sA
meet. An always impressive mile relay team captured a
fourth place at the Relays and John Wilson took a
second at the IC4A meet.

BASEBALL

Coach Ralph Mitterling has one problem other col-
lege baseball mentors happily avoid. That problem is a
suitable practice ﬁeld.

Ordinarily Mitterling would have his charges work out
at Pitt Stadium. However, the advent of the Civic
Light Opera series in Pittsburgh and their subsequent
use of the Stadium forced “Old Sarge” to hike out to
Schenley Oval for his game site.

Plagued with this difﬁculty, Pitt usually gets off to a
slow start in its baseball campaign. This was the case
once again during the 1950 season.

Following a short southern trip, the Panthers swung
into their short season and ﬁnished with a record of
ten wins and six losses.

Pitt’s slugging outﬁeld paced the Panther attack.
Newcomer George Lowe led the stickmen with a robust
.473 average while Bobby Lewis and Pat Murphy
averaged .377 and .361 respectively to give the Panthers
an overall .404 mark.

Leading hurler for the squad was Larry Brent who
hung up a ﬁve and three mark. He totaled 55 strikeouts
in 60 innings.

Department to carry on its program.

An intramural player of the Raiders comes in for a

Besides bruising ankles, it works up a good appetite.

INTRAMURALS

While Athletic Director Tom Hamilton dreams of
the day when Pitt will have an expanded athletic setup,
another director—intramural director Leo Bemis—is
dreaming of the day when his IM program can be run
OH’ on adequate playing areas.

During touch football season, Bemis has to take his
teams to Schenley Oval, as the Trees Fields have be-
come the site for the new Veteran’s hospital and the
ﬁeld house.

“Hey! This is touch football, remember?”

184

Same game, but a little tireder.

“It’s sure to be a strike.”

Basketball season found Bemis with only a slight
headache which disappeared when ancient Trees Gym
was okayed by the city engineers. The structure had
cracked up when water from the hospital foundation
had seeped into the foundation of the gym building.

Softball season still poses another problem for the
IM head. Spring football has taken all available ﬁelds
and the Oval is used by the baseball tam.

Bemis, who has had four years of headaches, is not
dismayed at the prospect. He, like the remaining mem-
bers of the athletic family, is awaiting that golden day
of the future when Pitt will have the area and facilities
demanded by such a large university.

('oncentrati11g on getting those all important Win-
ning pins.

WOMEN’S

ATHLETIC
ASSOCIATION

The VVomen’s Athletic Association’s enthusiastic
members found 1950-51 a proﬁtable year. Some of the
highlights were a spaghetti dinner held at South Park
in real Italian style, fun frolic nights which were held
twice a month in the evenings, and an annual Christ-
mas party. Some members attended a playday at
Indiana State Teachers College, while the party for
the graduating senior members of our organization was
a ﬁtting climax to the year.

This year, for the ﬁrst time, the Women’s Athletic
Association contributed its share, in the form of folk
dances, to the annual Beaux Arts Program for freshman
Women.

Front Row: B. Kathy, D. Carlisano, M. Schafiner, L. Mallinger, C. Von Bremen, G. Moran. Second Roux‘ P. VVagner, R. Shearer, H. Greschner,
Mrs. Nicely, T. Weaver, H. Mervosh, J. Schenkel. Third Row: L. Kitt, L. Dobscha, S. VVilson.

 

Archery is just one of the many skills that the girls master.

The purpose of the Women’s Athletic Association is
to foster among the women of the ‘University a spirit of
play; to extend to all women students the opportunity
of enjoying individual or group sports; and to assist
the Medical Adviser to Women and the Physical Edu-
cation Department in the realization of health ideals.

Executive Board Members for the mid-century year
were: Carol Van Bremen; president, Marion Shoffner;
vice-president, Louise Malinger; secretary, Lillian Hun-
ter; treasurer, Polly Buchanan; W.S.G.A. Representa-
tive, Mrs. Nicely; adviser.

Front Row: Delo Carlisano, treasurer; Carol \'onBremen, president.
Back Row: Marian Shaflner, vice president; l\«Irs. Nicely, faculty
adviser; Louise Mallinger, secretary.

STUDENT CONGRESS

Howard Greenberger

The mid-century year meant more to Student
Congress than ordinary legislation, for the many in-
novations introduced during the year were projects
intended for long range results.

For example, groundwork was laid at the Michigan
State game for a football game‘ and luncheon to be
held annually honoring Pitt Dads by a committee
directed by Herman Levy. Other legislation regard-
ing football and stadium practices fell under the
jurisdiction of Andrew Schurman’s Stadium policy
commission which recommended certain rules of
decorum for spectators in the Pitt bowl. By far one
of the most successful instances of student spirit and
cooperation seen at Pitt in a long time was the Alum-
ni—student train trip to the N otre Dame game spon-
sored jointly by Student Congress, the Pitt News,
and the Alumni Association. Planning for the future
was the keynote of the mid-century Student Congress
as evidenced by the ﬁne convocation of high school
students interested in student government. Forums,
discussions, and social get—togethers highlighted the
meeting which will have its major effect in the years
to come. Furthermore, revision of the social program
at Pitt indicates a new era in University social func-
tions, while Dale Hooper’s committee on Honoraries
and Professional Fraternities started a new regime
in cooperation between those loosely connected
organizations.

First Row: Roy Titchworth, Marjorie Bell, Anne Curran, Grace Salzman, J_ane Dobrosielski, Bren<la_McCauley. Second Row:

Howard Greenberger, Dale Hooper, Andy Schurmann, Richard Richards, William Green.

All in all, President Howard Green-
berger and the members of Congress
demonstrated the far-reaching effects of
cooperation. Other ofﬁcers were William
l\TcKinley, vice-president; Grace Salz-
man, corresponding secretary; Marjorie
Bell, recording secretary; and VVilliam
Green, treasurer. Chairmen of various
committees were Publicity, Don Caroth-
ers; Pitt Chest, Earl Jacobs; Representa-
tive to the Athletic Committee, Don
Ewart; Activities Committee, William
McKinley. The three standing commit-
tees of Student Congress carried on
business in their usual exemplary fashion
throughout 1950-1951.

The Social Committee under the lead-
ership of Dick Shallenberger, junior
congress member, inaugurated a new
social system this year. Designed to di-
vide ﬁnancial and promotional responsi-
bilities, W.S.G.A., and Men’s Council
joined with Student Congress in manag-
ing the successful Homecoming Dance
following the Miami game. The revision
of the social set-up at Pitt is intended to
meet and deal with all problems concern-
ing dances and other all-school functions
with a higher degree of efficiency and suc-
cess than has been accomplished before
this time.

lVIore students were enabled to take
an active part in student functions
through the efforts of Earl Jacob and his
Appointments committee. Student ap-
plications for dance committees, Spring
Festival, and other traditional events
were sifted to select the best qualiﬁed
students for the positions open.

A new peak in student enthusiasm was
reached in Student Congress sponsored
pep rallies staged during football season.
Dick Richards’ Assemblies committee
passed the Spring semester in planning
movie and speaker programs, utilizing
more modern and more intelligent selec-
ion of motion pictures and attempting
to present the ﬁnest speakers possible for
the enjoyment and enlightenment of the
student body.

Ellsworth Center has defeated all the disadvantages of
being a small division away from the main body. Under
the leadership of the Ellsworth Center Student Council
this group of 700 male students keeps up “school spirit”
on a grand scale. Social events are the order of the day.
Outstanding events this year were the Thanksgiving and
Christmas dances, and the spring picnic. The Student
Council has devised a social plan whereby all those who
wish to can purchase a book of invitations to all social
events for the year. This saves the Centerite a good deal
of money, and also encourages attendance at the affairs.
So as not to lose touch with the University, the Stu-
dent Congress sends representatives to both Student Con~
gress and Men’s Council at the Cathedral. The Student
Council is also very active in supporting University pro-
grams. Proof of this is the avid support the Freshman Ori-
entation Program always receives at the Center.

Student Council elections are always real “barn-storm-
ing” affairs with all candidates campaigning industriously.
Everything from posters to free cigars is the order of
election day. This is proof of the spirit which emanates
from “Boys’ Town.”

The Women’s Self Government Association is the
Women’s method of fostering loyalty, fellowship,
and activities throughout the campus. WSGA is a
well organized democratic government, true to its
name and the ideals it upholds, and unique among
other similar campus organizations. It is unique in
the spirit of friendship and cooperation symbolized
by WSGA’s success in enriching the campus life of
Women students at Pitt.

Something entirely new was started during the
year of the mid-century when the Commission of
WSGA, composed of the elected officers, chairmen
of the standing committees, Senior Court, and the
representatives elected by other women’s organiza-
tions on campus, met at Seven Springs before the
year began to formulate policy for 1950-1951. Com-
mission coordinates women’s activities and deter-

mines organization policy for WSGA.
Under President Jane Dobrosielski, WSGA worked

208

toward many goals at one time. The organization has
as its disposal eleven standing committees of about
one hundred women to direct specialized student
activities.

The Activities committee headed by Cora Pan-
cereve studied activities and attempted to place
women on committees paralleling their interests;
the Customs Committee under the direction of Nancy
Tear made freshmen feel at home at Pitt, incorpo-
rating into this year’s programs many ﬁne innova-
tions and improvements; Elinor Syna’s High School
Relations Committee cooperated with Student Con-
gress and Men’s Council in interpreting college life to
high school students with its Student government
forum, and also made a survey to determine which
high schools were most represented at Pitt; Mary
Grace Munn and the Scholastic Honors Committee
continued its encouragement of high scholastic rec-
ords with its tutoring service.

GOVERNMENT ASSOCIATION

The Social Committee, with Alberta Ignelzi’ as
chairman, worked with Men’s Council this year to
hold freshman mixer dances and promoted the new
social system at Pitt; Housing Board, headed by
Kathy Theiss studied housing conditions on campus
and attempted to create a friendly spirit for girls
living on campus and Gerry Pendro’s Traditions
Committee sponsored the traditional events of Lan-
tern Night and Coronation, trying always to enrich
these traditions; Transfer Committee, under Dolly
Martin, welcomed transfer women to life at Pitt
with a dinner, a dance, and some Very helpful forums.

This past year Men’s Council, the men’s student govern-
ing organization, broadened their extensive program.
Freshman orientation, one of the Council’s main activities,
was completely revamped. Deﬁnite requirements for the
receiving of a Panther Key by the freshmen were estab-
lished. Also a program of having the permanent orienta-
tion aided by roving counselors was set up. Headed by Len
Baker, the program also included the establishment of
Freshman Council, a new body at Pitt.

Other phases of Men’s Council’s program included
operating the Used Book Store. Under Ronald Ecker’s
management, the store continued to supply students with
used books at a low cost. Charles Wendell took over the
Football Movies Committee. Under his direction movies of
Pitt’s football games were shown the Thursday after the

ame.
g Council widened its activities to include working with
Commons Room Council on a Christmas program. This
action Council hopes will be the forerunner of greater male
participation in the administration of the Commons Room.

This, their last year at the University of Pittsburgh,
was a proﬁtable one for the women of the Class of 1951.
Spurred on by a hard working Executive and Cabinet,
many senior women who had not taken an active part in
class activities, were drawn into the tight circle of activi-
ties.

Turkey Talk was the theme of the ﬁrst. mass meeting
held on November 15._ Approval of the social calendar for
the year was followed by charades and refreshments.

Seniors worked long and hard on the Interclass Sing in
an attempt to recapture the Sing Cup which they won as
juniors. Foreign movies were shown at the Theater Party
which opened the second and ﬁnal semester of their senior
year.

“Return to Childhood” might very well caption the
Easter»Egg Hunt staged for orphans at Eastertime. The
orphans found dyed Easter Eggs, but the members of the
Class of ’51 present found that rare joy in bringing happi-
ness to those less fortunate than ourselves.

The Senior Commencement Ball was the perfect cul-
mination of four years spent in the University. The soli-
darity and warmth of feeling brought about by class ac-
tivities promises not to be broken in the Alumnal years
ahead.

Ofﬁcers for the year were the «following: Tema Seidman,
president; Reva Parish, vice-president; Georgia Smoley,
secretary; Rita Roth, treasurer, and Brenda l\IcCauley,
VV.S.G.A. Representative.

Women governing the Junior Class this year lived
up to the old adage of “All work and no play makes
Jane a dull girl.”

A well-balanced program emphasizing social and
academic interests was welcomed by the Class of
1952 at the first mass meeting held on the twelfth
ﬂoor on October 25. November 18 saw junior women
playing host to junior men at a Tea Dance in M28.

Juniors caught the Christmas spirit early at an
afternoon party in Stephen Foster Social Room
which featured bridge and canasta in addition to a
“white elephant” grab bag. In conjunction with
Juvenile Court authorities talent from the Class of
’52 entertained underprivileged children with a
variety show early in March.

A Lodge Party at South Park a few days before
Easter helped junior women and their dates forget
about school worries and enjoy an evening in old
clothes. Cotton dresses and picnic lunches spelled

' fun and a close of a proﬁtable year when juniors

gathered together to end the year on April 25 at
Panther Hollow. _

Officers for the year were: president, Mary
McFarland; vice president, Carol Smith; secretary,
Thelma Evans; and treasurer, Barbara McGahan.

Class. spirit and Pitt Spirit characterize the Class of
1953. The sophomore girls came together for the ﬁrst
time as a body on October 4 in a mass meeting at which
time the Activities Program was approved. Andy (Pan-
ther) Sherman led Pitt cheers and songs to launch the
Class of ’53 in a ﬂood of enthusiasm.

This enthusiasm did not peter out, and was evidenced
again at the Class Birthday Party in November at which
each girl’s admission was a can of food for CARE. On
January 12 the Frosty Frolic Dance was held at McSorley’s
Colonial in Avalon.

Special interest activities were planned in addition to
the major events. Symphony Day at the Mosque, swim—
ming and riding parties were well-attended. Both the Inter-
class Sing and Education for Elections found many sopho-
mores in attendance. As a nightcap and toast to a great
year, the girls met for the last time together as sopho-
mores in Panther Hollow for a picnic in May.

The planning and coordinating group of the Class of
1953 is as follows: president, Betty McKay; vice—president,
Fay Bortz; secretary, Jane Elliott; treasurer, Adele Marac-
cini; and W.S.G.A. Representative, Mollie Purdy.

The introduction of Freshman women to
University self-government is through Fresh-
man Council. This body is composed of one
delegate from each orientation class, and is
chairmanned by the vice-president of the
Women’s Self Government Association.

There are no elected oﬂicers in Council;
however, the girls did choose Lois Pounds as
permanent secretary with a business committee
consisting of Hazel Hallam, Alice Hughes,
Adele Moritz, Patricia Ritz, and Mary Jane
Ruminsky. Council further divided into two
workable groups: the by—laws committee and
the social committee. Separate meetings were

held by each in which the Class of 1954 Con-
stitution was drawn up and social functions
were planned.

Each delegate took back to her own group
the proceedings of Council for that week.
Through this sole source of government, the
Freshman Class became a workable whole
that demonstrated itself in its participation in
the Interclass Sing and other University Activ-
ities throughout the school year.

The close of the Freshman year found eager
Freshmen capable of the step-up to the posi-
tion of sophomores.

The University organizational program is designed
to expand to include societies based on active interest
and need. Among the new organizations is the Pitt
Chapter of the Arnold Air Society organized in the
latter part of the Spring semester of 1949, which has
grown to an active membership of forty-ﬁve. Arnold
Air Society strives to advance the military prepared-
ness and protection of our country, to increase our
knowledge of the scope and mission of the U. S. Air
Force and to maintain the “esprit—de-corps” of the
R.O.T.C.

The unit is now a national member of the Arnold

Air Society, a recognition which has been compara-
tively only recent. The social functions for the year
included pledge smokers, picnics, ‘and a Christmas
party which were held for the members and officers
of the Military Department.
_ Membership in the organization is open to ad-
vanced Air R.O.T.C. students who have a two point
average in military sciences, a one point ﬁve overall
average in the University, and who show high quali-
ties of military leadership, subject to the approval
of the active members.

Alpha Beta Gamma, organized in 1904, is a professional
fraternity for women in elementary education. It strives
to promote unity among the students of education, to
foster wider social and cultural life for these students of
the department. In addition, Alpha Beta Gamma develops
and stimulates interest in higher professional standards
for teachers in elementary education.

The ﬁrst meeting in October was devoted to welcoming
new members, renewing old acquaintances, and discussing
the coming year’s events.

In subsequent meetings, speakers from the education
department spoke on the various aspects of education.
Taking time off for some social life, the girls gathered dur-
ing the year for bowling, bridge, and canasta. At Christmas
time a holiday party was‘ held. Caroling proved that the

- girls could sing as well as teach. The next social event was
a picnic in May when everyone got together and had a
good time. The closing activity for the year was the annual
banquet in May. At that time the graduating seniors were
honored and the alumnae were greeted.

Alpha Epsilon Delta is a national honorary fraternity
for premedical students. Its objects are to encourage ex-
cellence in premedical scholarship, to promote the general
Welfare of the members by advocating the following of the
highest ideals in obtaining their goal, and to bind together
similarly interested students.

The University of Pittsburgh -branch of Alpha Epsilon
Delta is known as the Pennsylvania Gamma Chapter.
Originating in 19922 as the Chiron Club, it became, in
1930, the Chi Rho Nu. Being inactive during the war,
Chi Rho Nu was reorganized in l\Iarch 1947 and was
opened to all premedical students who have attained a 2.0
average at least in their combined courses, and a 2.0 aver-
age in the sciences. In January 1948 Chi Rho Nu was
granted a charter by Alpha Epsilon Delta, the national
honorary premedical fraternity, and became the organiza-
tion’s Pennsylvania Gamma Chapter. The Gamma Chap-
ter has become one of the strongest groups of the organiza-
tion.

In this year as in years past, University social and sport
events beneﬁted immensely through the efforts of Alpha
Phi Omega, service fraternity. Their record of cooperation
is unparalleled in University organizations.

The ﬁrst chapter of Alpha Phi Omega was founded at
Lafayette College in Easton, Pennsylvania, in 1925.
The second chapter, Beta, was organized at the University
of Pittsburgh in 1927.

Since then this national service fraternity, which is
composed of former boy scouts, has served Pitt diligently
and industriously, except for a brief period during World
War II. Among its activities are ushering and proctoring
during freshman Week, conducting men’s elections, con-
ducting the demonstration block at the football games, and
running the food concession at Spring Carnival.

Several social events are held for the members during
the year. A spring formal tops off the social calendar. 1950-
1951 saw an enlarged social program including a hayride,
dances, and the traditional formal. Members ‘represent
those men who were or are at the present time registered
with the Boy Scouts of America.

Alpha Kappa Psi, professional commerce fraternity, is
the oldest and largest_ national professional fraternity in
the United States. The objects of Alpha Kappa Psi are to
further the individual welfare of its members, to foster
scientiﬁc research in the ﬁelds of commerce, accounts and
ﬁnance, and to educate the public to demand higher ideals
therein.

Delta Chapter combined professional and social activ-
ities to give its members a well rounded program during
the year. Every month businessmen came to the A K Psi
Apartment to present their business experiences to the
fraternity. l\Iembers had use of the fraternity librarywhich
subscribes to most of the important business magazines.
l\Iike Kvoka edited the fraternity newspaper; Dick Smith
headed the research committee; Cliff Roberts, the profes-
sional committee; George Kramer, the social committee—
all did their part to make the activities of the fraternity
successful. *

Oﬂicers for the year were: president, Bob Osborn; vice
president, Jack O’Brien; secretary, J ini Simpson; treasurer,

Alpha Kappa Psi is officially a professional fra-
ternity. But this does not mean it cannot have an
active social life and take part in Spring Festival,
dances, formals and other Pitt activities.

Early last summer the chapter started its social
activities with picnics at South Park. A large number
of alumni brothers renewed old acquaintances and
made new friends at the picnics.

The annual picnic at Charlie Sheppard’s farm near
Grove City brought the summer to an end with
over 100 brothers attending the all day get-together
climaxed by the banquet at the Penn—Grove Hotel.
In the evening for the ﬁrst time in many years, the
actives defeated the alumni in softball.

Those were cold nights when the pledge dances
were held in the lodge at South Park. But the fellow-
ship was warm, the music danceable and a good time
was had by all. As we look back on the carnival, ﬂoat
parade, spring formal, pledge dances, picnics and the
sessions at the “Greeks” we ﬁnd a year that will long
remain in ourmemories.

Q21

The Anglo-Saxon word “cwen” means “queen” and
“bread—giver_,” but it has come to mean honor, scholarship,
and above all—unselﬁsh service to the University. Cwens
taps to membership sophomore women who are outstand-
ing in scholarship and activities. The organization strives
for leadership and fellowship, as exhibited in freshmen ac-
tivities such as customs, guild programs, and mentor
groups, and for scholarship.

This year, the Cwens had many service projects. They
were aides at University functions, Nationality Room host-
esses, ushers at chapel services", assistants to the advisers
of freshmen guilds, and publishers of the Cwen Directory,
which lists the names, addresses, and phone numbers of
all women students at the University.

Social aﬁairs are not neglected by the group. Through-
out the year such affairs as teas, a Christmas party, pic-
nics, and parties with other groups and other chapters are
the agenda of the social calendar.

Delta Delta Lambda, honorary business education fra-
ternity is named in honor of Dr. Daniel Lessenberry, pro-
fessor and instructor of courses in business education. Its
purpose is the recognition and encouragement of outstand-
ing scholarship in business education. Any business educa-
tion student attaining a 20 average or better for at least
one semester is eligible for invitation to membership into
the fraternity. Delta Delta Lambda had its origin as an
honorary business education fraternity in November of
1934. The junior and senior students in the department of
business education recognized the need, because of the
tremendous growth that was taking place in this depart-
ment at the University of Pittsburgh, for an organization
which would bring them closer together and further the
principles for which they stood.

The fraternity carried out this purpose during the year
by serving the business education students with a varied
program of activities. At their regular monthly meetings,
problems in the social-business ﬁeld Were discussed by
capable and outstanding leaders in the ﬁeld of business
education. During both the fall and spring semesters,
rushing parties and initiating banquets were held and an
annual picnic rounded out the school year.

In 1907 a group of prominent upperclassmen at Penn
State organized the ﬁrst chapter of Druids to honor fresh-
men who had distinguished themselves on campus. In
1920 Pitt’s Delta Chapter was organized and joined a
group of siir activities fraternities throughout the nation
which had adopted the name of Druids

Activated two years ago for the ﬁrst time since 1946,
Druids successfully regained the prominent position that
it formerly held on campus. Its main purpose is to stimu-
late interests in campus scholarship and activities and to
foster and recognize outstanding contributions in these
ﬁelds. '

Membership is open to sophomore and junior men out-
standing in activities. In addition to active members,
Druids taps to honorary membership faculty men who
“stimulate student participation in activities.”

Druids took an active part in Tap Day, Spring Festival,
and The Freshman smoker. Members served as ushers,
upper—class counselors, freshman camp counselors, and
Community Chest Fund speakers.

Eta Kappa Nu, honorary Electrical Engineering fra-

With approximately 250 Johnstown students attending
classes at Pitt, this group comprises the largest non-resi-
dent group in the student body. Nearly every sorority
house on campus includes one or more Johnstown girls in
its house list, and Oakland rooming houses and apartments
swarm with the Flood City males. The Association’s pur-
pose is to give this large but scattered group an opportun-
ity to preserve hometown ties and bridge the gap between
the Johnstown Center and the Cathedral campus.

One of Pitt’s most active organizations is made up of
students who never went to a class in Oakland before their
junior year. Growing out of the informal group of Johns-
town natives who congregate around the thrones in the
Commons Room, the Johnstown Students Association ob-
served its second year of official recognition by broadening
its scope and activities to make a “little Johnstown” on

The big event of the year was the Snow Ball, a semi-
formal dance held with the Johnstown Center during the
Christmas vacation. Square dances, a Christmas party,
and business-social meetings comprised the 1950-51 cal-
endar. A progressive step taken this year was the founding
of the Association a semi-monthly newspaper circulated

Since its founding in 1926 Tau Chapter of Kappa
Phi Kappa, national honorary education fraternity
for men, had been active on Pitt’s campus. This
chapter followed on the heels of the ﬁrst chapter,
Alpha, founded in 1922 at Dartmouth. From this
beginning has grown a national fraternity of over 50
chapters which work toward common goals——social
activities, scholastic attainment, and professional
ideals.

The organization is unique in that it is both hon-
orary and professional. All of its members are in the
ﬁeld of education and all must maintain a high scho-
lastic rating. Under the leadership of Mr. George W.
Hoffman, the chapter’s sponsor, the group has pro-
moted in the ﬁeld of education men of strong moral
character and recognized ability.

Five happy people.

Because the fraternity believes that the problems of
mankind can best be solved through conscientious and
intelligent training of today’s youth, it has striven toward
sending forth enthusiastic leaders in all ﬁelds of education.
Officers for the year were: president, Samuel Reitz; Vice-
president, George Larnprinakos; secretary, Karry Mc-
Ardle; treasurer, Roy Nelson.

KAPPA KAPPA PSI

Kappa Kappa Psi is a national honorary fraternity for
college bandsmen. Its purpose is to promote the best in-
terests of the college band, to foster a closer relationship
between college bands, to honor outstanding bandsmen
through privileges of membership extended as a reward for
technical achievement, and to encourage the performance
of a better type of music.

This is the fourth year for Alpha Omega Chapter of
Kappa Kappa Psi on campus. Numerous traditional events
including the initiation banquet and the ﬁrelight pledging
ceremony, have already taken a prominent place in the
organization’s social calendar.

On the strictly social side of band Life, several affairs
were arranged. During the football season, the local chap-
ter played host to the various bands visiting with their
teams. With the end of the formal fall band season, instru-
ments were put away. At the beginning of the winter
months come pleasant hours of relaxation in the Concert
Band.

Oﬂicers for the year were: George Witkovich, president;

Since its founding in 187 9, Kappa Psi has endeavored to
advance professionalism and fraternalism in the ﬁeld of
Pharmacy. A professional fraternity limited to Pharma-
cists only, Kappa Psi is one of the largest professional
fraternities in the United States, with 41 active collegiate
chapters. Beta Kappa Chapter of the University of Pitts-
burgh has taken an active part in the School of Pharmacy
since 1913.

Various informal and formal affairs, plus an active
pledging period comprised the social calendar for our chap-
ter this year. Two of the most enjoyable were the Province
Convention at Philadelphia and the annual Senior Ban-
quet. For the ﬁrst time, the Alvin J. Vavro award was
made to an outstanding Sophomore of the School of Phar-
macy. This award, established by Beta Kappa Chapter in
memory of a deceased brother, is to be given each year to a
member of the Sophomore Class selected by a committee
of the Dean, faculty members, and Chapter members.

The officers for the year were: Henry P. Perciballi,
Regent, Albert L. Fauss, Vice-regent; Albert W. Kossler,
secretary; Don E. Stewart, treasurer; John B. McCollough,
historian; Robert B. Brennan, chaplain; Edward E. Col-
lins, reporter; and Dominic J. Parlavecchio, Sgt. at Arms.
Dr. Edward P. Claus again served ably as Grand Coun-
cil Deputy and Adviser to Beta Kappa Chapter.

Representing the nucleus of extra-curricular activity
Women on campus is Mortar Board. The group is hastily
reaching its goal as an exemplary inﬂuence in promoting
high standards in studies and activities at Pitt, and to
render service, to honor learning, and to foster a quality
of leadership worthy of the University. Each member has
served individually in various Pitt activities while the
members, as a group, served at University affairs.

Freshmen Women outstanding in scholastic achievements
are honored by Mortar Board at Scholars’ Day, and then
on Tap Day outstanding juniors are tapped to form the
1949-1950 chapter. To further encourage scholarship and
culture in the University Mortar Board this year inau-
gurated a new service to the school in its reading list and
forums.

Among the less-academic activities were the alumni get-
together, social affairs held in conjunction with the Tech
chapter, and a social held with the members of Omicron
Delta Kappa. The year’s activity closed with the solemn
initiation of tapees.

NON-NOMEN

Since the last writing of this book, another men’s organ-
ization has made its appearance on the University cam-
pus. The N on Nomen Club under the supervision of Dr.
Denton Beal was organized last May. On May 18, 1950
the group was admitted to the campus on probation. The
purpose of the club is to provide a low cost social organiza-
tion for the men who do not have the necessary money to
belong to a fraternity. Upon applying for adminssion to
the campus as a fraternity this Fall, they were told by the
Fraternity Council that due to the critical world situation
and to the lack of men entering the University that they
could not be admitted as a fraternity. The Fraternity
Council recommended that they should not disband but
that they should continue as a club.

The Non Nomens took the suggestion and decided to
remain as a club on the campus. This September they
elected officers. The men who were elected to the offices
were John Besser as president, Howard Frey, vice-presi-
dent, Matt Yelle, secretary, and Bill Sabina, treasurer.

Since they have not been on the campus very long they
have not had a chance to get into many of the University
activities. Since last Fall they have participated in all the
intramural sports league activities including football,
basketball, and baseball. This Fall they had a weiner roast
and a hayride. At the end of the Fall semester they had a
party at the Fort Pitt Hotel to climax their activities for
the semester. Hats oﬂ’ to the active and energetic 22 mem-
bers of the Non Nomen Club.

Nu Sigma Sigma, the honorary Undergraduate Biologi-
cal Fraternity at Pitt, was founded during the early years
of the last war. In a few years because many of its mem-
bers went into service, it became inactive. Mr. A. S. Heil-
man, an interested member, took over the task of reorgan-
izing the Fraternity. The Constitution was revised, new
members tapped, and an active group got under way. The
purpose of this organization is to advance and develop
Biological knowledges essential to successful living, and
through its services assist others in acquiring a scientiﬁc
attitude, a personal interest in Biology, and a wholesome
philosophy of life. The membership is divided into four
classes: active, alumni, associate, and honorary. To be an
active member the student must have completed a mini-
mum of forty-ﬁve credits, maintain a general quality point
average of 92.0 and a quality point average of 2.0 in the
Biological sciences. There are lower qualiﬁcations for asso-
ciate members. Dr.W. R. Witz and Dr. C. A. Tryon are the
faculty advisers.

Nu.Sigma’s year usually begins with an open house to
introduce prospective members to its activities. During
the school year the Fraternity has guest speakers and ﬁeld
trips. The year is climaxed by the spring banquet at
which the new officers are installed and new members
receive their certiﬁcates. This.year the Fraternity has
established a ﬁfty dollar scholarship to help a Junior
attend the Summer Field Station at Pymatuning.

Phi Chi Theta, national commerce fraternity for women,
has been serving since 1924 “to foster high ideals for women
in business careers.” The Pitt Chapter welcomes students
in the day and evening classes of the School of Business
Administration who maintain high scholarship, high char-
acter, and active participation in activities. Before school
started, the girls had a weekend of relaxation and fun at
Ogleboy Park. With the resumption of classes, a Beneﬁt
Theater Party was held at the Playhouse. The money made
was contributed to the scholarship fund.

Installation and rushing parties kept the chapter busy
until Christmas. Then during the holidays the annual
Christmas Party was held at the Faculty Club.

With the new year came more rushing and then the
result——the pledge dinner at the Roosevelt Hotel.

Founders’ Day was celebrated in March at the Faculty
Club. The grand ﬁnale of the year came at the farewell
party at the president’s home where the new oﬂicers were
welcomed.

PI DELTA EPSILON

Pi Delta Epsilon is a national honorary journalism fra-
ternity organized to provide recognition for members of
campus publications.

Pi Delta Epsilon is composed of all outstanding workers
in campus publications. In addition to encouraging an
interest in better journalism, it provides a group situation
where editors and writers in all ﬁelds could meet for the
exchange of ideas and information.

At Tap Day this year an outstanding member of the
three publications was honored by Pi Delt with a medal.
It is based on leadership, character, and campus service
in publications. The award will be an annual presentation
after this year.

An original service project was started this year under
the guidance of Historian Vic Kasmierski. Under the proj-
ect an exchange program was started with other schools
in the United States to cover guidebooks published for
freshmen at the various schools.

Copies of the Pitt Handbook, the “Compass,” were
sent to these schools and their versions of similar books
were received back. Information in the books was compiled
under such headings as items included, size, pictures, fra-
ternity coverage, and school history.

Pi Tau Phi, honorary scholastic fraternity, honors the
junior or senior student who has made an outstanding
scholastic record. The organization is made up principally
of undergraduate students, but in recent years graduate
students who fulﬁll the requirements of Pi Tau Phi have
geen granted active membership.

The object of the bi-monthly meetings of Pi Tau Phi
can best be explained by the following excerpt from the
preamble to its constitution: “We, the members of Pi Tau
Phi, do hereby band together to conserve and spread schol-
arship, culture, and idealism . . always striving by all
sound methods to stimulate serious thought and true intel-
lectual standards.”

The outstanding social events of the year were the fall
and spring semester initiation banquets, at which new
members were welcomed to Pi Tau Phi. In addition, there
were various informal social gatherings which gave mem-
bers an opportunity to build up a group spirit. Ofﬁcers
for this year were: president, Phyllis Fingerett; vice-presi-
dent, George C. Harrison; secretary, Esther Waldron;
and treasurer, Phyllis Alspach.

Pi Tau Sigma, the Honorary Mechanical Engineering
Fraternity, was organized in 1940 under the guidance of
Professor J. A. Dent. Its purpose is ‘To foster the high
ideals of the engineering profession, to stimulate interest in
coordinate departmental activities, to promote the mutual
professional welfare of its members, and to develop in
students of mechanical engineering the attributes necessary
for effective leadership and the assumption of the responsi-
bilities of a citizen in a democracy!

A familiar sight on campus are the Pi Tau Sigma pledges
with their large wooden wrenches and white caps and
gloves. A formal initiation banquet ends pledging and at
this time an honorary member is initiated. Mr. R. J. S.
Piggott, Chief Engineer for Gulf Research, was initiated
in the Spring of 1950.

Pi Tau Sigma Award is presented in the Spring to the
outstanding Sophomore Mechanical Engineer who is
elected by his class. He gets an individual plaque which is
presented at a joint seminar in Foster Memorial. Irwin
Baker received the award in 1950.

The ofﬁcers for the Fall of 1950 are: president, Maynard
K.‘Wright; vice-president, Warren McClure; treasurer,
John Kozlowaki; recording secretary, Blain Leidy; cor-
responding secretary, George Saliba. The faculty adviser
is Assistant Professor William Rudoy.

Sigma Beta Sigma, whose Alpha Chapter is located at
the University of Pittsburgh, was the ﬁrst professional
engineering fraternity in the United States to have a uni-
versity affiliation. It is a ﬁrst class corporation, incor-
porated on May 8, 1938, under the corporation laws of
Pennsylvania.

The University chapter has approximately two hundred
and seventy-ﬁve members, most of whom are executives
or technical specialists of leading corporations. Some are
members of the Pitt engineering faculty. Professional en-
gineers and engineering undergraduates with proper
scholarship are considered for membership. The purpose
of Sigma Beta Sigma is to foster professional engineering
and all that the term implies.

Stated meetings are held on the third Friday of each‘

month except during July and August. At these meetings
outstanding engineers or specialists in related ﬁelds give
technical lectures. Plant visitations are made frequently.

Social activities of the fraternity included corn roasts,
bowling parties, picnics and dances. This year the fra-
ternity acted as host for the Evening Student Association’s
Fall Formal Dance.

SIGMA GAMMA EPSILON

The purpose of Sigma Gamma Epsilon fraternity is the
scientiﬁc, scholastic and social advancement of its mem-
bers, the extension of relations of friendship and assistance
between universities and scientiﬁc schools, and the build-
ing of a national college society for the advancement of
the earth sciences.

Sigma Gamma Epsilon is a national professional hono-
rary-engineering and mines fraternity and now has thirty-
three chapters. The Pitt chapter was the ﬁrst formed
after the founding of the fraternity at the University of
Kansas in 1915.

Students in mining, metallurgy, petroleum and geologi-
cal engineering, and geology, having a cumulative two
point average are eligible for membership.

A formal initiation and banquet is held each semester
for the pledges, other activities include smokers, picnics,
ﬁeld trips and conferences with national professional soci-
eties in which most members of Sigma Gamma Epsilon
are enrolled as student associates.

Officers for the year were: president, Fred O’Leary; vice-
president, Alfred Omelchuk; secretary, John R. Martin;
treasurer, Robert Vitale; faculty adviser, Professor H. G.
Botset.

Sigma Tau, national honorary fraternity for engi-
neers, celebrated its twentieth year at Pitt this year.
Psi chapter is one of the twenty—seven chapters in
schools throughout the country who recognize and
encourage scholastic and professional achievement in
its more than 17,000 members.

Sigma Tau has made a contribution to the ad-
vancement of engineering education through the
annual award of a‘ scholarship for graduate study at
the university of the student’s choice.

As an incentive to develop excellence in scholar-
ship, Sigma Tau awards a medal to the sophomore
in the School of Engineering and Mines who has
achieved the highest scholastic record during the
freshman year.

This year, under president Dale Hooper, was a
Very active one. The social program was planned to
aid in the development of character and professional
pride for which Sigma Tau stands. Included in the
social calendar were smokers, dinner meetings, and
banquets. These were attended not only by the un-
dergraduate members, but by faculty members,
alumni, and industrial leaders.

Theatron, honorary dramatic fraternity, was or-
ganized in 1938 for the purposeyof providing recogni-
tion for those students and faculty members whose
work in or with campus theatrical productions was of
superior quality. Qualiﬁcation for nomination is that
the candidate be a member of Pitt Players and that
he demonstrate sustained talent, ability, and initia-
tive in the accomplishment of his duties.

Using as their symbol the traditional Greek Mask
of tragedy, members of T heatron hope to stimulate
and perpetuate an appreciation of “good theatre”
within their own ranks as well as among the entire
student body of the University. It was to this end
that the members worked throughout the year.

Theatron oﬂ"ers its own awards: an Acting Award
and a Technical Award. Books and plaques are also
presented to other deserving persons.

The officers for this year were: president, Mel Sil-
ver; vice-president, Ruth Ann Stauff; secretary-
treasurer, Irene Yourgas.

PSI OMEGA

Psi Omega, national dental fraternity, was founded
in 1892 for two purposes, each of equal importance.
The ﬁrst of these was to afford its members the ad-
vantages, assistance and beneﬁts, both academic and
social, beyond the scope of individual attainment.
The second was for the advancement of the dental
profession through its membership here in school and
in practice. The successful pursuance of these aims
has been achieved through the unselﬁsh efforts of its
thirty-three active and numerous alumni chapters,
the Supreme Council, and a national publication,
The F rater.

Nu, local chapter of Psi Omega, was founded over
ﬁfty years ago and at present boasts a membership
of 85. The chapter has always been an active inﬂu-
ence here at Pitt, particularly in the ﬁeld of sports.
Last year’s football team captured the intramural
championship of the University and went on to de-
feat Carnegie Tech. The chapter also won the Inter-
fraternity Combined Sports Trophy with the aid of
its ﬁne basketball and softball teams.

The Pitt YMCA, as a fellowship of students and
faculty at the University, concerned with the all-
around growth of individuals and their responsibil-
ities in a changing society, must pause occasionally
to evaluate its role in the University and consider
various plans for the immediate future.

The philosophy of the student YMCA continues
to place emphasis upon value-centered activities as
a means to a greater end-vthat ‘of training responsible
leadership for a democratic society. Its concern, then,
should be upon quality of program rather than mere
quantity of activities. Its focus is upon the person as
a child of God whose potential for service to society
must be cultivated by making available opportunities
in which he can grow spiritually. It recognizes that
program participation must be voluntary and that
students can not be poured into a particular mould.
It endeavors to develop a position concern for the
World Church by encouraging a responsible attitude
to a particular section of that Church.

A large metropolitan campus like the University
of Pittsburgh continually faces the challenge of
helping “anonymous” students to become strong
and positive personalities of good will. The YMCA
with its religious heritage, democratic organization,
and varied program, strives to offer an effective chan-
nel and a wholesome environment for the extracur-
ricular education of its members in the University
community.

Among the varied programs offered by the YMCA
are intramural sports, discussion groups, social
affairs, and religious activities. Each member has
ample opportunity to participate in any number of
fruitful activities.

For the fellow with athletic interests the YMCA
has teams in intramural football, softball, and basket-
ball. Students with an interest in personal develop-
ment and social consciousness can participate in
discussion groups such as the Bible student group,
Pitt Town Meeting, Pre-Med Forum, and Pre-Dent
Forum.

Oﬂicers were: president, Andrew Schurman; vice-
president, Gilbert Gillespie; secretary, Arnold Wil-

The Young Women’s Christian Association pro-
Vided lots of fun for its members this year as well as
spiritual guidance and personal development.

In these tasks, the four commissions worked dili-
gently the year through. Personal and Campus Af-
fairs Commission planned the monthly YW nights
which included discussions of religion, the United
Nations, and a workshop about summer jobs and
projects. Association Nights for the YM-YW in-
cluded dances, trolley parties, and picnics. The Com-
mission also planned Caritas as a means of intro-
ducing freshmen women to the Heinz Chapel and
spiritual life at Pitt.

The Christian Faith and Heritage Commission
helped to bring Religion-in-Life Week to {lthe student
body as Well as sponsoring weekly Bible Study
groups. Through the Social Responsibility Commis-
sion, the girls worked with social agencies such as the
Juvenile Detention Home, Children’s Hospital, and
Y Teen groups throughout the city.

The commission on VVorld Relationships spon-
sored a trip by air to New York to visit the U. N.
Headquarters in the fall. In the spring a similar trip
was made to Washington D.C. Between semesters
the YW combined with the YM to hold a joint re-
treat at Somerset. Another joint project were the
afternoon movies for the entire student body. The
ﬁlms covered such varied subjects as the atom bomb,
creation of the universe, the language of ﬁsh, and
courtship and marriage.

Officers for the year were: president, Edith Davis;
vice-president, Isabel Daniels; secretary, Martha

One of the most impressive sights in this year of emer-
gency is the exhibition of preparednessiand armed strength
presented on the University lawn during Fall and Spring
when the ranks of the Reserve Ofﬁcers Training Corps
march in perfect formation across the smooth green
campus.

At these R.O.T.C. dress parades, as the men march in
review, inspections are conducted by Colonel Holland
Robb, head of the R.O.T.C. division of the curriculum,
and Major Joseph Hoffman, Assistant head.

The purpose of the inclusion of R.O.T.C. in the curric-
ulum is the teaching of military science including courses
in riﬂe practice and military strategy. Besides providing a
foundation in the techniques of war, Reserve Officers
Training Corps provides its students with two years of
basic training, after which they can apply for two years of
advanced R.O.T.C. With four years of training behind
them, men can apply for commissions in the regular armed
services. The invaluable program of defensive and offen-
sive tactics can not be underrated in critical times such as
the Mid-century year.

Colonel Robb

R.O.T.C., Reserve Ofﬁcer’s Training Corps,
prepares college men for reserve commissions
in the various branches of the United States
Army and Air Force. R.O.T.C. realizes that
college trains the future leaders of tomorrow,
that the academic curriculum provides the
background of knowledge essential to effective
leadership. But actual experience in leadership
is of inestimable value. R.O.T.C. supplies this
leadership. It is a ready-made course, designed
and perfected to develop those qualities of
leadership required in both military and civilian
enterprise. Students in R.O.T.C. will be leaders
in the Armed Forces should the national de-
fense situation require the services of the na-
tion’s youth.

The R.O.T.C. Cadet has available to him
many military fraternities and organizations,
including Scabbard and Blade, Society of
American Military Engineers, Arnold Air So-
ciety, and Pershing Riﬂes. The ﬁnal parade
tops the cadet7s drilling activities and the an-
nual Military Ball is his big social event.

The E & DI Cabinet has again completed a year of out-
standing work in its purpose of promoting fellowship
among its members, closer relations between the engineer-
ing students and the practicing ﬁeld, and the promotion of
an active social life for its members who must spend so
much of their time on the hill.

Each Fall after the various seminars have been set up,
a cabinet composed of two members from each of the semi-
nars and two members from both the Sophomore, and
Freshmen join together to form a body who act similarly
to the Student Congress in the Cathedral.

This year, thanks to the past cabinets, many conven-
iences were at the disposal of the future engineers. The
candy and coke machines, the well-equipped lounge, and
the many other extras provided the students with some of
the things which they miss by staying on the hill.

This year the E & M Cabinet had a Very full social life
arranged for the students. In the Fall they had one of the
most interesting exhibits at the Freshman Smoker. A
very successful bowling party was held last December.
Other activities which were widely acclaimed were the
picnic and the E & M Dance. N 0 article about the
E & lV[’ers could be complete without mentioning that
again this year they had their famous jalopy on hand for
the football games and other events.

The credit for such an outstanding Cabinet must be
attributed to the leadership and interest shown by the
officers of the Cabinet. The president this year was Joe
Lagnese. Assisting him were Gordon Hall vice-president,
George McClesky, secretary, Jack Reihing, corresponding
secretary, and Paul McQuillan, treasurer.

The Chancellor’s Message

Again the University, the students and the teachers,
are called to defend the life we believe is good—in war
or peace. Our people and the people of ﬁfty-nine associ-
ated countries stand together against the forces which
would destroy this life. Again the University and the
Nation need your youth—your strength, your hope-
fulness, your laughter, your willingness and power to
take on whatever needs to be done in this defense. The
University holds for you in its teaching and in its learn-
ing the practical skills and the idealism to make your
hand and your spirit strong. We hope this war will be

22

short, but it may be long. The deans in every school
are working with their faculties to organize all the re-
sources of the University for special training in civil
and military defense. While we do this we try to make
real for ourselves and for you the values and the beliefs
which the United Nations war defends. VVhat I am
saying is that whether we are at war or at peace we
want you students to join the strength of your youth to
the ageless strength of the University—which together
are the invincible power by which alone free men can
live. '

The Seminar of Electrical Engineering has been a part
of the University since 1915. On October 6th of that year
the Seminar held its ﬁrst meeting with ﬁve students pres-
ent. These ﬁve were Seniors, and they represented the
entire senior class of the school. The purpose of the organi-
zation was to encourage the young engineers, to keep them
in close contact with the practicing ﬁeld, and to keep them
abreast of the latest developments and happenings in the
ﬁeld. This same purpose has come down through‘ the years
with the seminar still being maintained to keep the stu-
dent’s interests alive in the ﬁeld by means of speaker,
movies, and lecturers. Although the Seminar is considered
an activity, it is compulsory for all the students in the
School of Electrical Engineering to maintain a membership
in it. Attendance at the weekly meetings is also compulsory
and as a reward to those who have perfect attendance roll
at the end of the semester they are granted one half of a
credit towards graduation. From its ﬁrst humble enroll-
ment of ﬁve, it has grown to membership of approximately
160, counting the Juniors and Seniors only.

On April 24, 1991, the Seminar held a banquet for its
Senior members at the Fort Pitt Hotel. This year the
Seminar held its banquet on January 11th again at the
Fort Pitt Hotel.

In closing may we not forget the officers who worked so
hard to make the Seminar and all its activities a success.
They were R. L. Radus, E. J. Monoriti, andW. K. Ander-
son, president, vice-president, and secretary respectively.

259

On March 8, 1950, the American Institute of Chemical
Engineers established a Student Membership section in
the Institute. In keeping with the University’s policy of
having the latest and the best at Pitt, a chapter was set
up on the campus under the supervision of Drs. Heiss and
Coull. The seminar met every Thursday for an hour, and
at each meeting some interesting program was presented
through the efforts of the seminar ofﬁcers, Ray Asti, Dick
Lunn, and Bob Graham. Movies were shown when possible
and many speakers were heard. Amongst these were our
Drs. Carlson and Ferguson. The seminar also made ﬁeld
trips to such places as the Schenley Distillery and the Fort
Pitt Brewery. The seminarians were well informed of the
latest happening in the ﬁeld through their subscriptions
to the National Institute’s magazine, “Chemical Engineer-
ing Progress” and by also receiving the Institute’s news-

paper. This year our chapter was represented at the N a- I

tional Institute’s annual meeting which was held at Buck-
nell University by the ofﬁcers of the seminar.

The students in Chemical Engineering did not maintain
the policy of all work and no play. They participated very
actively in the Intramural football, basketball, and base-
ball leagues.

The seminar was completely ﬁnanced by the dues col-
lected from the members. All in all it proved to be a very
good way of both keeping the Chemical Engineering stu-
dents up on the movements in the ﬁeld and providing to
them some way of showing how they participated as an
individual group in the University life.

A rare moment of relaxation for I. E.’s.

5260

Dating back as far as the history of the School of In-
dustrial Engineering itself, the Seminar of Industrial
Engineering is actually composed of two associations
blended into one. It is comprised of the American Society
of Mechanical Engineers and the Institute of Industrial
Engineers. The prime purpose of the organization is to
keep the membership up on all the advancements and de-
velopments in the ﬁeld. Sub-heading this purpose is the
secondary motive of helping the students in the school get
the feel of industry. This means not only to know what is in
the books but to study the ﬁeld through a type of Vicarious
experience in it. These purposes are carried out by the
student’s discussing the problems in the ﬁeld today, by
Viewing various movies dealing with the technologies of
the ﬁeld. As in most of the other seminars enrollment is
mandatory with the meetings being held on a weekly basis.
The Seminar does not stick to the theory of all study and
no relaxation. This year theyhad many extra—curricular
activities. Among some of these social events were the
smokers held for the members, the banquet for the Seniors
.who are expecting to graduate this year, the picnic for
the members and their‘ dates, and the Engineering and
Mines Association Cinderella Ball which they helped to
sponsor.

This year the officers for the Seminar were Frank
Medisti as president and George Abel as vice—president.

All Work and no play, and all books and no prac-
tical experience make for a poor Civil Engineer.
This is the principle upon which the Civil Engi-
neering Seminar operates. In addition to the stu-
dent’s curriculum, he can hear questions and dis-
cuss problems in his ﬁeld with some outstanding
leaders at the meetings of the seminar. The meet-
ings, held every Thursday always consist of in-
teresting programs, sometimes speakers and
sometimes movies. Field trips were also part of
the year’s program. These gave the student the
opportunity to actually observe civil engineers at
work. In the line of play the Civil Engineering
Seminar sponsored picnics and numerous parties
throughout the year. Through these activities
the members of the Seminar became well-
acquainted with each other and a spirit of com-
radeship was developed.

Oﬂicers for the year were William Sarver, pres-
ident; John Duff, vice-president; Joseph Limpert,
secretary; and Herbert Harger, treasurer.

Omicron Delta Kappa, national honorary men’s ac-
tivities fraternity, has grown constantly in prestige and
importance. It recognizes those men who have had the
most successful participation in college activities, and thus
inspired others to strive for attainments in similar lines.
This policy has brought together the most representative
men from all phases of college life.

These student activities are grouped into ﬁve major
phases of college life: scholarship, athletics, social and re-
ligious activities, arts and publications. Members are se-
lected from junior and senior men, faculty and alumni on
the basis of character, scholarship, distinguished attain-
ments and college and community life. The ceremony
awarding membership is held in December and May.
Gamma Circle of ODK was founded at the Univers"ty of
Pittsburgh when Alpha Circle at Washington and Lee
University decided to expand in 1914. The man who most
fully exempliﬁes the standards and ideals of Omicron Delta
Kappa is named Senior Awardee and has his name placed
on ODK walk. This is the highest non-academic award
that the University can bestow.

Officers for this year Were: Howard Greenberger, presi-
dent; Don Ewart, vice-president; Robert Graham, secre-
tary; Endicott Batchelder, treasurer; Fred S. Robie,
Faculty Adviser.

member of the Supreme Board of Directors of the fra-
ternity.

Meetings throughout the year bring together pharma-
cists and pharmacy students. to see movies, hear speakers,
and to discuss subjects of pharmaceutical or national in-
terest. Contributions to pharmaceutical progress are made
through the A.Z.O. National Cultural Fund, and by giving
books to the Pharmacy School Library. Mu Chapter has
established a yearly award to be given to that sophomore
pharmacy student who has ‘attained the highest scholastic
achievement in all courses covered in the freshman and
sophomore years. The award consists of the latest edition

Dr. John Weber

The Registrar

Whatever problems may arise in the future concern-
ing enrollment will ﬁnd Dr. J. G. Quick, University
Registrar, willing and able to deal with them; for at
Mid-Century Dr. Quick has handled efficiently the
high enrollments presented after World War II when
veterans crowded the Universities and Colleges of this
country. As the tremendous increase was felt at Pitt,
Dr. Quick found himself faced with a shortage of teach-
ers, insufficient space, and the problems that naturally
arose from the sudden rise in attendance. In 1946 Dr.
Quick met the question of lack of space by holding
registration in Syria Mosque. The following year found
the special Pre-Registration plan inaugurated which
further decreased confusion and time needed to register.
Another innovation suggested by E. A. Batchelder,
assistant registrar, was the installation of the Interna-
tional Business Machine system, which also quickened
the registration process. The I.B.M. machines turn out
graded reports and address pre-registration kits speedily
and efficiently.

In the future streamlined procedures will handle the
enrollment with more proﬁciency than was possible in
the pre-war days when the enrollment was only 12,000
students.

The Secretary

Mid-century ﬁnds Dr. John Weber, University Sec-
retary, still playing a forceful role in the University. A
Pitt graduate, Dr. Weber started his career at the Uni-
versity as an instructor in the Mechanical Engineering
department after having served as a captain in World
War I. After a time as head of the M. E. department,
he became business manager of the University in 1926.
His other services to Pitt include membership on the
board of Trustees and supervising engineer in the con-
struction of the Cathedral and Heinz Chapel. In this
latter capacity Dr. Weber achieved one of his greatest
accomplishments—the selection of the famous stained
glass windows in the Chapel after an extensive trip
through the United States and Europe. Although today
Dr. Weber is responsible for the physical needs of the
University and is active in many outside interests in-
cluding serving on the Board of Managers for Juvenile
Court and the City Planning Commission, he has still
applied himself zealously to the needs of the UniVersity’s
expansion program. He looks forward to the time when
the campus will be covered with a new science building,
better sport’s facilities, student buildings, and libraries.

The Pitt Capsule is the monthly publication
of the Pitt student branch of the American
Pharmaceutical Association at the School of
Pharmacy. Reporting professional news, school
life and activities, the Capsule is of interest to
both students and alumni.

features. The Greek’s Corner tells of fraternity
and sorority life at the Pharmacy school. The
alumni column is a record of activities of pre-
vious graduates of the school. The Capsule also
prints excerpts from current pharmaceutical
magazines which may help the pharmacy stu-
dent in his work at the school. Another part
of the publication has a question box in which
are published queries from confused students.
In the following issue the answers are published,
thus rendering a service to all the readers.

Bernard Lefkowitz and Bernard Ivanshultz
are the co-editors of the Pitt Capsule. Jean
Littlewook is the business manager and Jo
Toch is the circulation manager. Dr. E. P.

Dr. Theodore M. Finney

The voices of ﬁfty strong ﬁlled the elevator as it shot
down from the thirtieth ﬂoor of the cathedral; Heinz
Chapel Choir had just ﬁnished another rehearsal under the
leadership of Dr. Theodore M. Finney, head of the Music
Appreciation department of the University, and were
going home, still singing.

This was a common occurence during the Mid-century
year. In fact it has always been known that the members
of Heinz Chapel Choir would rather sing than eat; and
their songs ﬁll not only the elevator, but the Tuck Shops,
the Ground Floor, or wherever they happen to be.

Under the twelve year directorship of Dr. Finney who
organized the choir in 1938 the group has developed into
one of the best-known sacred music choirs in this region.
Although the choir was originally formed for singing at
services in Heinz Memorial Chapel, their activities have
increased to include concerts at district churches, an annual
spring concert tour, caroling in Oakland hospitals at Christ-
mas, and singing at special University functions. They are
still regarded most highly, when clad in purple velvet, they
sing at Chapel services.

In addition to their regular activities, the members have
an annual Christmas banquet, a spring picnic, a rehearsal
camp in Laurel Mountain Park each fall, and many other
social events.

Officers for the 1950-51 school year were: president,
Marion Baeslack; secretary-treasurer, Shirley Harrold;
librarian, Sue Baer; business manager, Thomas Auchter—

onie.

Any sophomore, junior, or senior woman undergraduate
in the University who is carrying twelve quality points or
more is eligible for membership in one of Pitt’s ﬁnest
musical organizations, Women’s Choral.

This activity is one of the busiest on campus from the
standpoint of social events as well as the View of their par-
ticipation in Pitt’s extra-curricular program. Women’s
Choral cooperates fully in Open House, the annual Christ-
mas Party in the Commons Room, Heinz Chapel services,
and Choral Jubilee.

As for its social events, Women’s Choral holds a Christ-
mas Party each year as well as an annual weekend trip
to l\It. Alto for a joint concert with the Pennsylvania State
School of Forestry Glee Club. There are many local con-
certs scheduled each year which bring to Pitt the honor and
admiration of outside groups. The social events of the
year are brought to a close every season with the VVomen’s
Choral Dinner in which feelings of friendship and goodwill
are molded that last throughout the years.

Officers for the year were: president, Audrey Laird;
vice president, LaRue Hillegas; secretary, Margaret

In a university where almost everyone likes
to sing, many groups have been established to
meet the need of choral singing. One of the
comparatively new organizations which pre-
sents an opportunity for every man and woman
in the University of Pittsburgh to exhibit vocal
talent is the Pitt Singers. Formed in 1946, Pitt
singers is open to any undergraduates carrying
twelve credits or more who can qualify in
tryouts held twice a year.

Pitt Singers give concerts in and around the
Pittsburgh area, ﬁnishing off their season with a
tour to other cities. Under the direction of
David G. Weiss of the Music Appreication De-
partment, Pitt Singers not only entertain by
themselves, but also cooperate to the fullest
extent with other musical groups on campus.

With the Mid-century year being one of
national emergency, the oldest activity on
campus, Men’s Glee Club, is faced with the
task of recruiting a great many new members.
Because of graduation and the draft board, the
membership had been reduced to approximately
one-third its usual size of about sixty members.
After several weeks of competitive tryouts, the
addition of new members brought the club up
to full strength although the future is still
fraught with‘ conditions ‘liable to cause a drop
in the group.

Despite many. factors reducing the strength
of Men’s Glee Club, its effectiveness and effi-
ciency under the direction of David G. Weiss
was not impaired. The Glee club took its usual
prominent place in school activities with ap-
pearances at the Annual University Open House
on October 22, and at_ the Chancellor’s Recep-
tion for parents of freshmen. Numerous eon-
certs were presented in Pittsburgh and mid-

VVomen dearly love to talk, the learned sages say; and
for women of the University who do love to talk and have
something of importance to say, the Women’s Speech
Association is the answer to their prayer.

VVith Women playing an ever-increasing part in making
the decision of the day, VV SA had a busy year with a varied
program of debate, poetry reading, discussion, and radio.
hlembers of the Women’s Debate team took part in tour-
naments at l\Iount l\Iercy and Kent State University. In
addition, they attended the Penn State Debater’s Con-
vention and the state tourney in Philadelphia.

During the year, discussion groups from the association
took part in radio programs over station WPGH. Within
the association panel discussions made up several meetings.
Several Pitt Women interested in poetry reading attended
the annual Penn State reading festival held at State Col-
lege‘ in May.

An annual project of the Association is the Beaux Arts
Day program to which freshman girls especially are in-
Vited. This year’s program was presented in conjunction
with Women’s Choral and the VVOmen’s Athletic Associa-

In 1950-51 the University of Pittsburgh’s Men’s De-
bating Association enjoyed a most successful year. In
the Annual Western Reserve Series early in October, Pitt
Debaters gained victories before high school audiences in
Cleveland and in Pittsburgh. Men’s Debate also sent teams
to the Temple Tourney, held annually in Philadelphia for
ﬁrst-year men, and to Bowling Green, University of Vir-
ginia, W. and J ., and Northwestern Tourneys for experi-
enced members. The debate question at these tourneys
was, “Resolved that the non-communist nations of the
world should form a new international organization.”

Climaxing a busy year, Pitt debaters went to the Delta
Sigma Rho Convention in Chicago, and to the Pennsyl-
vania State Convention in Lewiston. Pitt teams also at-
tempted to regain the State Championship Honors they
won in 1948-49. To orientate new members, Men’s Debate
started a system of “Big Brothers,” wherein experienced
members were counselors to the ﬁrst-year men. The break-
down of members into three groups; Varsity, Junior Var-
sity, and Novice was also started.

Ofﬁcers for the year were: Bernard McGowan, manager;
Ed Burtell, assistant manager; Bob Gardner, audience

and Cyril Wecht, publicity manager. Fred S. Robie, Assist-
ant Professor of Speech, continued as a ﬁne Director of
the Men’s Debating Association. Miss Mary Jane Boyle

THE VARSITY MARCHING

It is a sunny day with just cnough chill in the air
to make it good football weather. A crisp drumbeat
reverberates from one end of the stadium and blue
uniformed ﬁgures step smartly onto the gridiron as
the public address system announces, “Presenting
the University of Pittsburgh Marching Band.”

Below you see one of the ﬁnest college bands in the
country performing. Beside the usual amount of work
that goes into such a complicated but perfected show,
there is a terriﬁc amount of spirit in this organization.

The marching musicians receive no remuneration
of any sort nor do they get credit toward graduation
for their participation in the band. Their only reward
is the knowledge of a job well done. Heading the staff
which helps perfect the marching and music for the
band’s presentations is Robert L. Arthur. He is
aided by Assistant Directors Ben E. Benack and
Albert Zimmer, Graduate l\Ianager Thomas Bond,
and Drill Coach John Reynolds.

The excellent example set by bands of the past has
much to do with the quality of the present band. The
bandsmen’s pride in his organization makes him want
to outdo anything that has ever been seen in the
Pitt Stadium. This means hard work.

Next year’s band will really have to work to sur-
pass the “Marching Magic” and musicianship of the
1950-1951 Varsity l\”Iarching Band.

BAND

The 1950 football season was a good one for
the Varsity Marching Band. The band’s season
got underway the week before classes began for
the fall semester. Approximately 150 men
boarded buses and traveled to Camp Kon-O-
kwee. For ﬁve days, they ate, slept, and drank
band, here the weather gave the band some
trouble. Of the ﬁve days at camp, four were
rainy and miserable. In spite of this the band
developed a new style of marching. They left
camp Saturday morning and made their ﬁrst
public appearance of the season at Deshon
Veterans’ Hospital. The VMB traveled to Ohio
State to meet their chief rivals. For the opening
home game with Rice, they prepared a tribute
to Pennsylvania. The 150 musicians traveled
all the way to Chicago for the game with North-
western. At half time they told the citizens of
the Hub City about Pennsylvania. The band
returned to their home grounds the following
week for the homecoming game with l\Iiami
and honored the alumni by playing the school
songs with appropriate formations. The fol-
lowing week our blue-uniformed men took the
ﬁeld and performed their regular ‘pre-game rou-
tine in a sea of mud.

IN REVIEW

Armistice Day found the VMB in South
Bend, Indiana, home of the “Fighting Irish”
of Notre Dame. The band made the trip by
means of generous contributions on the part of
the student body, IF Council, and many others.
The band’s half-time show saluted the armed
services by forming the hats peculiar to that
service. The next game brought to the stadium
l\Ir. Grandelius and friends, playing under the
colors of ;\Iichigan State. The game with Penn
State was played on very soggy turf. The band
wasn’t permitted on the ﬁeld. They played
several swing numbers from the stands.

The Varsity Band ﬁnished the season off
with the most successful Stadium Review it has
ever presented. A record crowd of 1300 attended
the indoor show to hear the band replay the
music from its half-time shows plus some popu-
lar marches and swing numbers.

Despite muddy ﬁelds, deep snow, rained out
drills and generally bad weather conditions the
whole season, the band put on some sterling
performances and was acclaimed across the
country.

Having ﬁnished one of its most successful years since
its inception, Pitt Players looks forward to next year for
even greater achievements in the ﬁeld of Theatre. At a
school where there is no curricular dramatic group, Pitt
Players has given amateur Thespians a chance to show that
a lot of talent goesa long way. l\Iany of the Mid-century
year’s production competed on a par with the productions
put on by Carnegie Tech’s Drama Department. The pur-
pose of Players as an extra-curricular activitiy is the pro-
duction of good theatre and the provision of an organiza-
tion which will give its members experience in the tech-
niques of theatre art. To be eligible for membership in
Pitt Players, the applicant must be a full-time under-
graduate student at Pitt and must acquire a satisfactory
rating in each of two ﬁelds. Field A consists of acting,
business, publicity, make-up, and sound. Field B includes
scenery, costumes, lights, stage, and property. After ac-
quiring membership, a Player must participate in at least
two shows during the school year to retain active mem-
bership.

Four ﬁne productions were presented during the year,
the ﬁrst two, “l\Iy Sister Eileen,” and “Beggar on Horse-
back,” being directed by Barry Farnol in the temporary
absence of Harvey J. Pope. The last two shows, “Suspect,”
and the annual musical presentation were under the direc-
tion of Mr. Pope and Robert Prendeville, Technical
Director of Pitt Players. Ofﬁcers for the year were: presi-
dent, Stephen J. Skirpan; vice-president, Irene G. Your-
gas; secretary, Edith Finegold; business manager, Leonard
Briskin and publicity director, Harry Kimball.

The College

The College makes up the greatest proportion of courses in the over-
all curricula of the University of Pittsburgh with twenty-three sep-
arate departments and divisions. From Astronomy through Psychol-
ogy, from Philosophy through Physical Education, and from Music
Appreciation through Chemistry, if you want it the College has it.
Under the leadership of Dean Stanton C. Crawford, the College
functions smoothly in all departments despite its great size. As a
liberal arts school, its many required courses and its electives make
the College one of the ﬁnest schools of its kind in the country.

The department of ASTRONOMY is headed by Dr. N. E. Wag-
man who is also Director of Allegheny Observatory. In the depart-
ment of BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES, Dr. Peter Gray, whose softly-
clipped accent betrays his English origin, acts as head of the depart-
ment. Dr. Alexander Silverman, head of the department of CHEM-
ISTRY since 1918, is well-known for his penchant for glass of all
types and is recognized as an authority on the subject. Students all
agree that Robert X. Graham, JOURNALISM, has one of the ﬁnest

senses of humor in the University. Mr. Graham is much in demand as

toastmaster for various banquets and dinners because of his pleasant
personality. MATHEMATICS and magic are the twin interest of
Dr. James S. Taylor, head of the department. Many students wonder
if it requires the latter to pass a test in the former of Dr. Taylor’s two
interests. Heinz Chapel services on Wednesday afternoons are made
doubly satisfying when Dr. Raymond F. Brittain delivers the sermon.
Dr. Brittain is -also head of the History of Religion division of the
College.

MY SISTER EILEEN

Pitt Player’s ﬁrst production of the 1950-51 season
was the comedy “My Sister Eileen” by Joseph Fields
and Jerome Chodorov, ﬁrst produced in New York
in 1941. It is the story of two sisters from Columbus,
Ohio who come to New York, hoping to try their
luck in the big city, Ruth believing herself to be a
writer and Eileen an actress. Upon reaching the city,
they take a basement apartment in Greenwich Vil-
lage, where they encounter some complicated cir-
cumstances which result in hilarious situations.

Q86

  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
   
 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 

To the consternation of her sister Ruth
(Joan Reichman) and Bob Baker (Duke
Fowler), Eileen leads a conga line of
Brazilian ambassadors through their
basement apartment while Oﬂicer Lonigan
tries to calm the excitement.

Ruth and Eileen and their visitor
Chick Clark (John Sturgeon) try not
to laugh as Frank Lippencott (Ben
Tatar), in his typical manner, trips
over the card table as he is being
introduced.

Because of her “good will” toward the
Brazilian government, Eileen receives
from the Brazilian consul (Gilbert
Simons) the Medal of the Order of Saint
Christopher, Second Class.

SUSPECT

“Suspect,” by Edward Percy and Reginald
Denham, Players’ third production of the season,
was a psychological mystery about a suspected
ax-murderess who sees her secret, suspected crime
about to be revealed and visited upon the head of
her son. Forty years ago she had been accused of
killing her father and stepmother; she had been
neither acquitted nor indicted, as the jury brought
back the verdict of “not proven.” Thus, as Mrs.
Smith says, she was saved from the punishment
of such a crime, but not from the stigma attached
to it. Because of a series of strange incidents, two
visitors in her home suspect Mrs. Smith of this
crime, and by a carefully laid scheme, lay a trap
and ﬁnally accuse her. After hearing the defense,
the audience must decide for themselves her inno-
cence or guilt.

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
   

Mrs.Smith (Ruth Schwartz), at-
tended by her guest Sir Hugo
(Melvin Silver) and her son
(James Hoobler), collapses upon
realizing that she is again suspected
of murdering her parents.

As Sir Hugo (Melvin Silver) seeks
to establish Mrs. Smith’s guilt or
innocence, her faithful servant
Gouldie (Sue Delphey) is ques-
tioned by her mistress as to how
the ax, used for chopping wood,
came to be inside the house.

BEGGAR ON HORSEBACK

“Beggar on horseback,” an expressionistic drama
by George S. Kaufman and Marc Connelly, was the
second production of Pitt Players. In expressionistic
drama, the playwright tries to probe beneath the
surface of “outer reality” in an attempt to reveal the
inner workings of life. “Beggar on Horseback” con-
tains all of the social criticism that was characteristic
of expressionism, but it is treated more in the spirit
of musical-comedy-satire than straight argumenta-
tion. Most of the scenes were written in the expres-
sionistic style, and represent dream fragments oc-
curring within Neil McRae’s mind.

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
  
   
   

In his dream, the wedding guests
converge upon Neil McRae

Neil seems puzzled as Miss You

(Sue Delphey) direct him to the
office of the president, his father-
in-law, Mr. Cady (Ben Tatar).

  
 
 

Angered because of the Cadys’
refusal to let him complete his
symphony, Neil decides to kill
them; he cuts Mrs. Cady’s throat,

happily, still singing her favorite
hymn, “Rock of Ages.”

The overall governing body of sororities at the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh is Panhellenic Council. Its membership
is made up of two representatives from each of the sixteen
national sorority chapters on campus.

Continuing with its former policy of cooperation rather
than competition among sororities, Panhel instituted many
new measures during the mid-century year to enable
groups to realize their interdependence upon one another.

A well-ﬁlled year is evidenced by Panhellenic’s activities
throughout the past year. Once more Panhel held its popu-
lar Workshop which is composed of roundtables, seminars,
and guest speakers. In the \Vorkshop various sorority and
campus problems are presented and thoroughly discussed
with an eye to solution and improvement.

Another innovation this year was the addition of the
presence of sorority presidents at the regular social meet-
ings. This inclusion of presidents was hoped to cement ﬁne
feelings among the groups represented on Council.

Also on the social calendar was the traditional Pan-
hellenic-Interfraternity Sing on January 18, the winners
being Kappa Kappa Gamma, Chi Omega, and Kappa
Alpha Theta. This event is annually scheduled for the
evening preceding the IF \Vinter Ball.

Sorority women and their escorts earned an eve-
ning of relaxation at the annual Panhellenic Council
Ball on April 13. The Ball was held at the Hotel
Schenley and featured Charlie Spivak; sorority
pledges were also honored in a beautiful ﬂower
ceremony.

Panhellenic Council is by no means merely a
social organization. The Council supports European
war orphans through its national fund. On campus,
Panhel puts out a Panhellenic Guidebook for freshmen
and sorority women at its annual Freshman educa-
tion forum. This book clearly outlines the sorority
customs, regulations, and purposes of the University
of Pittsburgh, and is designed to promote better
understandings of the female Greeks. This year the
handbook has been revised to include some of the
ﬁndings of the VVorkshop.

Panhellenic Council functions as a body under the
administration of an Executive council. It is also .

ALPHA DELTA PI

 

Just one hundred years ago, Wesleyan Female
College Welcomed among its students nineteen girls
who were to become the Adelpheans, founders of
Alpha Delta Pi sorority. Thus began the ﬁrst secret
sisterhood for college women. This year, a special
centennial observance took place in the town where
Alpha Delta Pi was founded. It was our Biggest
national event of the year.

At Pitt, 1950 was a busy year for the ADP’s. Be-
sides holding campus offices and Working in many
school organizations, Alpha Iota chapter girls en-
joyed a full schedule of social activities. A big rush-
ing season started the year. Then there was fun at
the open house after the Pitt~Miami Homecoming
game. Our next outstanding event following a suc-
cessful November Alumnae Beneﬁt Was the Black
and White formal in December at the Jacktown
Hotel. The evening after this dance, we helped the

SAE’s entertain at a Christmas party for a group of
orphan children. Of course, spring rushing kept us all
busy. After initiation there was the F ounder’s Day
Banquet——our own little centennial celebration.
Our Spring Formal, held shortly before graduation,
ended our year successfully.

Since the day of its founding, Alpha Delta Pi
has been bound by the covenant that no girl could
be taken into membership save “such as may com-
mend themselves for their intellectual and moral
worth, dignity of character, and propriety of de-
portment.” On these foundations, Alpha Delta Pi
looks forward to the future. The officers were: Lou
McDonald, president; Joan Schewe, vice-president;
Sue Phillips, recording secretary; Margy Taylor, cor-
responding secretary; Judy Ruddell, social chairman;
Marty Jo Ryan, rushing chairman; and Mrs. E. R.
Maclntosh, faculty sponsor.

ALPHA EPSILON PHI

Alpha Epsilon Phi started 03 the social sea-
son to the tune of a ﬁddle. At their annual barn
dance in South Park, the girls and their dates
had a frolic trying to follow the “Do si do’s”
and “Allemande left’s” of the square dance
caller.

The A E Phi’s proved their athletic ability
when their football team came up with a 17-0
victory over the Phi Mu’s in the opening game.
A dance at the VVilliam Penn Hotel set off the
holiday spirit.

All year the A E Phi’s worked hard keeping
up their busy schedule—practicing for Panhel-
lenic Sing in November, making luncheon dates
and planning for the rushing parties in l\Iarch,
attending tea dances, and entertaining the men

Theodore M. Finney D1“ W- H- She1t0H

One of the most fascinating sectors of the Liberal education as
prescribed by important educators is a good foundation in the de-
partment of CLASSICS. Dr. Arthur M. Young, head of this depart-
ment, stresses the satisfaction of the well-rounded, cultured individual.
The chairman of the ENGLISH department, Dr. Putnam F. Jones
practices his profession in his spare time, for his leisure hours are
spent most proﬁtably in reading good books and writing short stories.
The head of the department of FINE ARTS, VValter R. Hovey, is
active in community circles as well as educational circles. He occupies
the position of president of the Craftsmen’s Guild of the Arts and
Crafts center and is a member of the Pittsburgh Playhouse.

The head of the department of GEOGRAPHY, Dr. J. Warren
Nystrom has not just learned his ﬁeld from books; instead he has
visited many of the countries about which he lectures in his geography
classes. Although many people confuse geography and GEOLOGY.
the latter is a separate department under the able direction of Dr.
R. E. Sherrill.

There are no double F’s in the HISTORY department, although
Dr. John W. Oliver, head of the department, claims ﬁshing and farm-
ing as his double hobby. MODERN LANGUAGES and stamps have
something in common, for Dr. W. H. Shelton ﬁnds both his depart-
ment and the collection of foreign stamps to be fascinating occupa-
tions. Theodore M. Finney, better known as “Pops” to hundreds
of admiring students, handles the position of Director of Musical
Activities along with a full-time job as head of the department of

The ﬁve Beta Sigs who attended their national
convention at Swampscott, Massachusetts, returned
to school last fall with some wonderful ideas, de-
termined to make this a big year for Beta Sigma
Omicron. The social calendar began with a big
splash—a swimming party held in October. The
next month the alum group treated the active chap-
ter and their dates to a square dance at the Penn-
Hebron Garden Club. The annual round of fraternity
tea dances began in November when the Beta Sigs
entertained the Sig Eps.

In December the sixty-second birthday of Beta
Sigma Omicron was celebrated with the Founders’
Day Tea. The busy holiday season began with the
traditional Christmas formal. the highlight of the
semester. The Kiddies Kapers costume party which

was the ﬁrst social event of 1951.

With the beginning of a new semester the Beta
Sigs devoted most of their time and energy getting
ready for the rushing parties in March. In no time at
all it was Spring Festival Week with all the frenzy
and excitement of the ﬂoat parade and spring carni-
val. The girls honored their mothers at the Mothers’
Banquet and said good-bye to old friends at the
Farewell Banquet for seniors. After the hectic cram-
ming for ﬁnal exams, the spring formal at the Uni-
versity Club was a ﬁtting climax to a wonderful
year.

The officers for the year were: Janet Klein, presi-
dent; Rosan Habegger, vice—president; Betty Hay-
den, treasurer; Lois Custer, recording secretary; Nan-
cy Purucker, corresponding secretary.

at Pitt are eager to uphold the ideal and pur-

desirable campus and community projects. This year
found Margie Bell as a member of Mortar Board,
and recording secretary of Student Congress, and
Marty McMichae1, Working hard as Circulation
Manager of the Panther.

To start the year off on a strong note of friendship,
the Chi O’s joined with the Tech chapter for a social
meeting. Football season kept us in a whirl with an
open house and Alumni Tea after the Miami game,

game. A mother—daughter ﬂapper dinner also proved
a great success. Christmas festivities, such as enter-
taining orphans at a party, holding an Alumni bene-
ﬁt at the Playhouse, and dancing at the traditional
Christmas formal, kept the bonds of comradeship
strong for Phi Beta.

The climax of the year was the Spring Formal in
June after exams. The Formal was the undergrad-

“Remember that Delta Zeta can mean so much to
you.” These words from one of Omicron Chapter’s
favorite songs recall a host of memories of a wonder-
ful year. The trophies for scholarship and member-
ship that the sorority won at national convention
were an inspiration for all the Delta Zetas to strive
for even higher achievements.

The DZ’s got their ﬁrst look at their remodeled
sorority house at a party the Week before school
began. From that time on, the girls invaded the house
for Monday night meetings and the fraternity tea
dances that followed, for Panhel Sing practices and
open house after the football games, and for slumber
parties that always ended in all-night gab fests.

The Founders’ Day dinner at the Royal York gave
the college chapter a chance to hear about “the good
old days” from DZ alums. It will be a long time before

the Delta Zetas forget the Halloween hayride in the
rain or the Christmas formal at the pine-decked

tree to exchange gifts. The end of school year found
the DZ’s rushing to get ready for State Day, laugh-
ing about. tales of the choir trip with their eight
Heinz Chapel Choir members, and donning jeans
every weekend to rehearse dances and paint signs
in preparation for Spring Festival. At the beautiful
spring formal at the country club, favorite fellows
were initiated as “DZ Men.”

Delta Zeta in 1950-1951 really did mean much to

underprivileged children to camp last summer.

Theta is especially proud of her members who were
active in campus organizations. Seven girls were
senior mentors; Peggie Cochrane served as Chief
Justice of Senior Court; Sue Jackson, Senior Court
Member; Peggy Ann Cohen, vice-president of Cwens;
lVIary lVIcParland and Carol Smith, president and
vice-president of the Junior Class.

A philosophy of life is one of the principal features of a Well-educated
man or woman, and Dr. M. R. Gabbart, head of the department of
PHILOSOPHY, strives to give his students an idea on how to form
a philosophy of life. Moving from the mind to the well-being of the
body, the College has a ﬁne program of PHYSICAL EDUCATION
FOR MEN under Carl Olson supplemented by a good required course
in PHYSICAL EDUCATION FOR WOMEN directed by Margaret
E. Covert.

The sciences are a major part of education in a liberal arts college.
Dr. David Halliday is chairman of the executive committee of the
department of PHYSICS, while PSYCHOLOGY has Dr. Wayne
Dennis as its mentor. The head of the department of POLITICAL
SCIENCE, Dr. Elmer Graper also holds the position of Director of
the Institute of Local Government. Closely allied to Political Science
is the department of MILITARY SCIENCE, headed by Col. Holland
L. Robb. This department is especially important in these days of
national crisis, and now as the Mid-century year passes, the next fifty
years will be greatly influenced by the military and tactical geniuses
of the world.

Buell B. Whitehill, Jr., head of the department of SPEECH,
possesses a special brand of humor which pleases his students consid-
erably. His Wisconsin farm and horses share the attention of Dr. M.
C. Elmer, head of the department of SOCIOLOGY.

In the future, the twenty-three departments of the College under
the leadership of Dr. Crawford and its faculty, will continue in its
efforts to turn out Well-rounded college men and Women.

The eighty years in which Kappa Kappa Gamma,
international women’s fraternity, has existed have
been years of progress, of close bonds of sisterhood,
and of that special feeling of pride which is shared
by all wearers of the golden key. Gamma Epsilon
chapter began its twenty—ﬁrst year on campus on the
enthusiastic note which President Mary Ellen Mil-
ler brought us from the Kappa convention last sum-
mer at Murray Bay, Quebec.

Pitt Kappas are proud of every member, and es-
pecially of the ones who have brought high honor to
the chapter. Jane Dobrosielski, W.S.G.A. president,
wore the pin of Mortar Board, as did Mary Ellen
Miller. Our two secretaries, J o Gallagher for VV.S.G.A.
and Carol Hinds for Panhellenic, worked hard all
year. Dolly Martin, Dream girl of SAE, was chair-
man of the Transfer Committee. In addition, other
Kappas worked on publications, dances, and
W.S.G.A. committees.

There’s nothing like a cup of tea.

C’mon kids, sing it out!

306

Gamma Epsilon enjoyed a full social season. Tea
Dances, open houses, coffee hours, and bridge parties
continued through the year. We held our traditional
Orphan’s Party with SAE, and our Faculty Recep-
tion with DTD. Something new in dances was started
at our “Juke Box Saturday Night” party at the
house. We will long remember our beautiful winter
and spring formals. Between semesters we vacationed
together in the mountains near Ligonier. The Social
whirl kept us busy from September to June.

Another year is over, but each’Kappa had mem-
ories which will not fade with time. Gamma Epsilons
of 1950-51 will forever feel that “It’s Great to be a
Kappa.” _

The oﬂicers were: president, Mary Ellen Miller;
vice-president, Kas_h Herron; recording secretary, J.
Gallagher; corresponding secretary, Anne Adams;
treasurer, Betty Gourley.

PHI MU

It’s spring cleaning time again! At the end of
spring semester, the Phi Mu’s get together for a ﬁnal
workday to have the apartment in shape before
summer. When they are working in a group, the
Phi Mu’s are at their best. The huddle in the corner
isn’t a scrubwomen’s convention; it’s just Mary
Grace Munn and Lois Foight still teaching Sue
Delphey and Erda Gottlieb how to play “Lemmis-
ticks,” a Nova Scotian game. Over the din of the
vacuum sweeper, you can hear Gerry Seman singing
“Mammy” as she dusts the floor. Gloria Sunderland
is wondering “Did anyone ﬁnd my bobbie pins in a
brown plastic case?” She lost them last October. The
girl on the top of the ladder using sign language is
Fran “laryngitis” Gibson. Little noticing the con-
fusion, Gerry Pendro, our social chairman, pages

through the scrapbook, proudly recalling each affair.
The pictures of Betty Dunlap’s cottage and Phi
Mu’s splashing in the creek are reminders of the corn
roast and Phi Mu weekend. Bits of purple, green, and
gold ribbon from the first tea dance; a patch from
someone’s jeans at the “Hard Times Party”; a
snatch of holly, a souvenir of our winter formal;
photos from the mothers’ banquet and the alumnae
party; favors and programs of the rushing parties;
a Wheaties box top from the box given as booby prize
to Dottie Harr after the bowling party; scraps of
papier mache from a ﬂoat; and a pressed rose from
spring formal, our farewell event with our seniors.

The officers were: president, Varvara Federoff;
vice-president, Frances Gibson; secretary, Alberta

Ignelzi; treasurer, Geraldine Seman.

PHI SIGMA SIGMA

Hey! that’s your picture.

With the Panhellenic Scholarship Cup for 1950
decorating their mantlepiece, the Phi Sigs proudly
started out the new school year determined to keep
up the good work. Their social schedule started off
with tea dances to entertain the fraternities, a party
to celebrate Founders’ Day, and a Wonderful formal
dinner dance at the Baldoc Country Club. In Novem-
ber the songsters of the group put in many hours of
rehearsal practicing for the Panhel Sing.

A dance at the house opened the spring semester’s
activities. Although the rushing parties in March
were a lot of Work, the girls had plenty of laughs and
good times while they were planning and decorating

for them’. The digniﬁed Phi Sigs who came to the

mals could hardly be recognized as the same girls
who had been square dancing in blue jeans and plaid
shirts at their barn dance. The parents of the sorority
girls were treated at Mothers’ and Fathers’ Day Din-
ners. The proceeds of a beneﬁt were given to the
Rheumatic Fever Fund—the national philanthropic
project of Phi Sigma Sigma. A dinner dance in June
ended the year’s social events.

The sorority was well represented in school activ-
ities. There were three Mortar Board members‘, three
class ofﬁcers, one Cwen, ﬁve Senior Mentors, and
Vice-presidents of WSGA.

The chapter ofﬁcers this year were: archon, Dolores
Lux; vice-archon, Florence Korn; scribe, Sara Fogel;
and bursar, Arlene Levinson.

Tri Sigmas can always ﬁnd a cheerful home in their
apartment at 4634 Fifth Avenue. That soft rug in
front of the living room ﬁreplace has listened to many
conversations ranging from operations to—you
guessed it—men! !

The girls, looking back through the year, will
remember the joy of donating their services to the
children at the Juvenile Court, and organizing the
Christmas party with the Theta Chi’s for a group of
orphans. They will also remember the piggy bank
donations for CARE and the Christmas Seal drive.

The year was highlighted by a well-planned social
program. First came open house at Homecoming, tea
dances after meetings, parties for the girls, and the
beauty and closeness of Harmony Hours each month.
The winter formal, held at the Roosevelt Hotel,

312

will be remembered for its beauty. The social calen-
dar could not be considered complete without the
decorations planned by the social chairman, Barbara
Warren. Closing a successful year of fun and work,
Tri Sigmas went formal to their traditional Violet
Ball held in honor of the June graduates and the
new actives.

No statements can praise enough the work of the
following officers: Shirley Kanaan, president; Anna-
mae Skrak, Vice~president; Ann Robb, recording
secretary; Cora Pancereve, corresponding secretary;
and Josie hlustari, treasurer. Through their guidance
Tri Sigma can look back to their second year at Pitt
with pride because of the efforts of their housemother,
Z\Irs. Edna Lee Sprowls.

THETA PHI ALPHA

In the fall of the year, Theta Phi Alpha was
busy making plans for its apartment. When
moving day came at last, our decorating ideas
on paper came to life with pleasing results. A
“Kiddie Land” party gave us a chance to
show our dates the results of the days we had
spent with color charts and paint brushes. Invi-
tations for tea dances were sent at once, and
plans for apartment parties were made.

The reactivation of Theta Phi Alpha Moth-
er’s Club started with a mother-daughter
luncheon. The mothers immediately made
plans for future meetings and card parties.

Dominating the year was our annual “Sap—
phire Ball” at the University Club. The
Christmas season was a perfect setting for its
candle-light dinner, traditional entertainment,
and formal atmosphere. Descending from the
clouds, we packed away our formals, sponsored

a Christmas party for orphans. Time for elec-
tions reminded us how successfully our 1950
officers had served. Pat Devlin as president,
Mary Bragg as vice president, Jeanne Striegle
as secretary and Sylvia Steinbach as treasurer
had capably officiated at meetings all year.

Spring was packed with events. Between
rushing and Spring Festival, we squeezed in a
picnic and a barn dance at South Park.

This was a good year for Theta Phi Alpha,
and we regret losing our nine seniors. The
school will miss them too, for they not only
worked for the sorority, but for the good of the
whole student body.

Theta Phi Alpha will remember its seniors
and the happy times the sorority had in the
mid-century year furthering their national
traditions.

Take two, they're small.

ZETA TAU ALPHA

The girls of Zeta Tau Alpha got off to a new start
this year with a welcome party in honor of their new
house mother. We all think l\Irs. Werle is just like a
real mother to us.

When classes got underway we began planning our
program for the year. Janet Sopher and Lorraine
Flowers, Chi’s delegates to National Convention,
told us about the experiences they had at Mackinaw
Island.

Then came the annual Founders’ day banquet at
the College Club, with Dean Rush as guest speaker.
We remember the look on Nancy Tear’s face when
she heard that her name was to appear on the schol-
arship plaque for the second time, and how surprised
Gerry Yonakas was when she was awarded the Alum-
nae Honor Ring.

During the year the Zetas held a Halloween party

on the lawn, a Christmas party for the orphans, a
mother-daughter banquet, winter and spring for-
mals, and many other social events. We enjoyed our
Monday night tea dances with some of the other
fraternities and sororities on campus.

The Zeta girls are proud of the many friendships
they have formed within the chapter; they are also
proud of the following Zetas, who are leaders in ac-
tivities: Nancy Tear, customs chairman of W.S.G.A.;
Thelma Evans, Junior class secretary; Mary Pat
Mulvaney, Senior Mentor; and Betty Graham, the
Sweetheart of Sigma Chi.

Officers for the year were: president, Betty
Graham; vice-president, Mary Pat Mulvaney; re-
cording secretary, Geraldine Yonakas; correspond-
ing secretary, Jacqueline Creighton; treasurer, Joann
Weitzel; historian, Thelma Evans.

At the newly decorated and furnished Sigma Delta Tau
apartment in Belleﬁeld Dwellings, the sorority started off
its social season with a Thanksgiving Dance.

December was a busy month for the SDT’s, First the
girls held a dance at the Roosevelt Hotel. A few weeks
later the sorority turned out in full force to see one of the

Here’s a new 0116. “Sweet Adeline”! Pittsburgh Playhouse productions.

The new year found the ambitious Sigma Delta Tau’s
hounding their friends to buy tickets for their annual
fashion show. The girls had just as much fun planning and
working on the rushing parties that they held in March,
as the freshmen who came to the parties. In April the new
pledges were honored at a barn dance.

To keep up their Spring Festival record was a real chal-
lenge to the SDT’s who last year had won ﬁrst place in the
Carnival booth awards and whose sweetheart Irving Fai-
gin was crowned King of the Festival.

The grand ﬁnale on the social calendar was a Weekend
celebration. A formal dinner dance at the Highland Coun-
try Club followed up an all-day picnic at North Park.
The officers of Sigma Delta Tau for this year were: presi-
dent, Marcia Sachs; vice-president, Edith Finegold; re-
cording secretary, Valorie Jonas; corresponding secretary,
Nessa Green; treasurer, Frada Rosenberg.

Mu, the University of Pittsburgh chapter of Delta
Sigma Theta Sorority, takes its position of a social
sorority seriously; for it has provided its members
with a full social calendar throughout this Mid-cen-
tury year. »

Beginning with its Brittle Breaker Dance during
the West Virginia football weekend, the Delta Sigs
combined dancing, cardplaying, and miniature bowl-
ing to produce an evening of enjoyment for them-
selves and their guests, members of other campus
fraternities and sororities. At Christmas, Mu chap-
ter had a Candlelight Soiree followed in close succes-
sion by its annual Founder’s Day Celebration.

Another annual affair, the Symposium, presented
a musical theme. Easter Sunday is the day for this
traditional event each year. The Jabberwock pre-
sented an interesting contrast to the Symposium, for
this social, given during March, was a program of
skits in which other sororities, fraternities, compete
for prizes.

An umbrella formal ended the series of Delta Sigma
Theta social activities, closing the school term with
color and beauty.

Oﬂicers of Delta Sigma Theta, Mu Chapter, for
the 1950-1951 year were: Dorothy Powell, president;
Dorothy Lance, vice-president; Florence Davis,
secretary; Janet Mackee, treasurer and Imogene
Perrin, Panhellenic representative.

ALPHA KAPPA ALPHA

This year marks the end of thirty-two years of
Alpha Kappa Alpha’s chapter at Pitt. Once more the
record books have been tucked away and meetings
have become something of the past, but we still
remember all the good times we had during the year.
Our ﬁrst outstanding social affair was Christmas
caroling at the Children’s Hospital. After that came
our grand Founder’s Day Program on January 27.
The arrival of Spring found the AKA’s entertaining
for the Easter Party at the Davis Home and honor-
ing our mothers at the annual Mothers’ Day affair.
Following this event, we held our beneﬁt ball, the
proceeds of which went to a charitable organization.
Our social calendar closed with a pajama party for
the graduates. As the semester closes, Alpha Kappa
Alpha looks forward to another bright, active, new
season. The ofﬁcers for the year were: l\Iary Sid-
berry, president; Doris Garrett, vice-president;
Octavia Perkins, secretary and Lillian Hunter, treas-
urer.

Howard E. Dyche

Engr. and Mines

The School of Engineering and Mines starts out its Mid-
century semester with Howard Ed. Dyche as Acting Dean.
Mr. Dyche, however, still maintains his position as head of
the department of ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING. The
other seven departments of the school maintain their high
standards with the same individual heads of departments as
last year. In the department of CHEMICAL ENGINEER-
ING, Dr. James Coull remains as head, while at the helm of
the department of CIVIL ENGINEERING, Robert F.
Edgar directs the future surveyors and builders of the nation.
Edward A. Dines, Acting head of the department of MIN-
ING ENGINEERING, steers the policy of the diggers, and
in charge of the department of PETROLEUM ENGI-
NEERING is Holbrook G. Botset.

Moving. on in the broad ﬁeld of the School of Engineering
and Mines, we ﬁnd Walter R. Turkes heading two depart-
ments, that of INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING and that
of GENERAL ENGINEERING. Making sure that the
Wheels turn and the gears grind is the head of the depart-
ment of MECHANICAL ENGINEERING, Nelson Lewis
Buck, while the department of METALLURGICAL ENGI-
NEERING is under the able direction of Dr. G. R. Fitterer.

The School of Engineering and Mines is proud of its
faculty and department heads, for it is under the supervision
of these men that Engineering and Mines has bcome one of
the ﬁnest, most complete schools of its kind in the country.
The School of Engineering and Mines has a great deal to
look forward to in this, the year of Mid-century.

Dr. G. R. Fitterer

1.11 COUNCIL

I.F. Council . . . comprised of two delegates and one alternate from each fraternity.

Jim Morton, president of I.Fp‘.pCouncil

334

Inter-Fraternity Council, the centralized

representative governing body of Pitt’s fra-'

ternities, has progressed rapidly in all ﬁelds of
endeavor.

In sports, The IF football, softball, basket-
ball, and other leagues were run with a high
degree of efﬁciency. Competition was the key-
note of all athletics as each fraternity fought
and played to accumulate points toward the
IF All-Point Trophy.

Socially, the Winter and Spring Inter-Fra-
ternity Balls were huge successes. The com-
bined Panhellenic and Fraternity Sing, held
just before the Winter IF Ball, showed all
fraternities to great advantage.

Delta Tau Delta Sing Team, Winner of the I.F. Sing.

Of great service to the entire University was
the IF conducted band drive. Finding that the
funds to send the Varsity Marching Band to
the “big game” against N otre Dame at South
Bend were lacking, IF Council voted to sponsor
a fund-raising drive. After many days of hard
plugging a large contribution by IF Council
itself put the “send the Band to Notre Dame”
drive over the top.

A Leadership Conference, Debate season
and IF Blood Day also were high lights in the
IF year.

As a service to all fraternity men, IF Council
published an IF Handbook and IF Directory.

Guiding IF Council the past year were
president, Jim Morton; vice-president, Earl
Jacob; secretary Bill Ferguson; treasurer, Jack

Grodin; and Fifth Member, Bob Rossell.

ALPHA PHI DELTA

Alpha Phi Delta fraternity was founded in 1914 for
students of Italian-American extraction who wished to
further their social and academic life at college. Nu
Chapter at the University of Pittsburgh has long been a
mainstay among the many chapters spreading across
the country.

The fraternity carries out the willingness of its mem-
bers to stay physically ﬁt by engaging in various sports
on campus. On the social side Alpha Phi Delts lean
toward stag parties, picnics, and two formal dances
during the school year. In addition to a well-rounded
sports and social calendar members still ﬁnd time to

 

336

maintain a high scholastic average.

Members include future teachers, engineers, doctors,
dentists, lawyers, businessmen, and R.O.T.C. candi-
dates who will eventually strengthen our national se-
curity. This is in keeping with Alpha Phi Delta’s aim
to build better students to emerge as able men for the
jobs that await them upon graduation.

This year Nu Chapter was host to twenty-nine other
chapters during the annual convention.

Officers for the year were Anthony Latona, president;
Pat Avolio, vice president; Louis Borello, secretary;
and Joseph De Julia, treasurer.

DELTA SIGMA PHI

Another active, successful year has passed for one
of the busiest frats on the Pitt Campus . . . Delta Sigma
Phi. Sports, dances, and organizations . . . Omega had
its fun in all. Bud Trunick, the versatile Social Chair-
man whose committee always made a Delta Sig aﬂair
a memorable event, planned the Spring Carnation
Formal at the University Club, the Sailor’s Ball, and
the Christmas party. By the efforts of Jack Boulton

YMCA president and Student Congress member along
with being Pitt Panther; Arnie Wilczynski, Y secretary;
and Ralph Thorne, Men’s Council secretary. On the
literary side, Ken Schwartz is the Owl Art Editor and
member of the Pantherstaﬂ’, and Frank Hornak is
the Owl’s Advertising Manager. Chuck Yost, though in-
jured for the greater part of the 1951 season, has per-
formed most creditably for the Pitt Panthers in Foot-

ball.

Omega chapter officers for the year were president,
Andy Schurman; vice president, Ken Schwartz; secre-
tary, Ronald Cost; treasurer, Frank Hornak.

and Frank Dunn, the Delta Sig’s have copped the best
show award at Spring Carnival for the past few years
now.

DELTA TAU DELTA

Rather than stressing any one ﬁeld of interfraternity
and campus life, the members of Delta Tau Delta have
tried to maintain a balance of interests that would in-
clude school activities, scholarship, athletics, and social
events. Activities of the past year and those planned
for the future seem to bear out the wisdom of this
policy, for the men of Gamma Sigma chapter can
never be overlooked in any of these ﬁelds.

Delts are not only in the foreground in many activ-
ities, but they are providing much of the background
strength in others. They are well represented on Student
Congress, Men’s Council, IF Council, the Panther, the
Pitt News, the varsity football, basketball, track, and
swimming teams, as well as in many honorary frater-
nities. In IF competition, teams wearing the purple,
white, and gold of Delta Tau Delta are always respected

340

and feared.

The Shelter at 4712 Bayard Street is an even more
popular social center since the extensive improvements
of the past year. It is the scene of many a ﬁne time—
house dance, tea dance, faculty reception, buffet lunch,
or plain old fellowship gathering at Monday meeting.

The Delts branched out this year with the Winter
Formal at South Hills Country Club; the Annual
Christmas service at Trinity Cathedral conducted by
Dean High Moor; and attendance at all University and
IF social events, to say nothing of the famous Bowery
Brawl given by the pledges.

The oﬂicers were president, Bill McKinley; vice-
president, Jack Fulton; recording secretary, George
Aitcheson; corresponding secretary, Joe Edmunson;
treasurer, Jim Anderson.

Kappa Nu has successfully gone through its three
years of growth and is now putting all its emphasis on
recognition as one of Pitt’s top fraternities. The white-
pillaredg Craig Street home now boasts 41 actives and a
pledge class of 27.

Xi chapter of Kappa Nu was established at the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh in 1921. Due to the depression it
was forced to relinquish its charter, but in 1947 the
Kappa Nu Graduate Club, which was still active,
brought Xi back to campus. Now with 68 members KN
is able to have men in high offices in many university
activities. The fraternity is represented by officers in
Men’s Council, in Student Congress, and in the Pitt
Chess Club. Fourteen men live in the 15-room house at

at Xi’s house.

KN ’s athletic teams have come into their own the last
three years, and they are giving every fraternity in
every sport a run for their athletic money. Last year
the fraternity won ﬁrst prize for decorations in open
house competition during Spring Festival Week.

Kappa Nu was third on campus scholastically last
year, keeping up with the tradition of scholarship as
well as brotherhood, fellowship, and loyalty.

The oﬂicers are president, Norton Berman; vice
president, Alfred Ash; secretary, Eugene F ram; treas-
urer, Paul Crown.

LAMBDA CHI ALPHA

At home in their newly redecorated house.

 
 
 
 

In 1919 Omega Alpha Pi, a local fraternity at the
University of Pittsburgh, became the Gamma-Epsilon
Zeta Chapter of Lambda Chi Alpha. The national fra-
ternity was founded in November of 1909 at Boston
University. Now in its forty-ﬁrst year and numbering
137 chapters and 11 colonies, Lambda Chi Alpha is the
largest of the Greek letter fraternities.

Since its reactivation in 1946, Gamma-Epsilon has
made steady progress. toward becoming one of the top
fraternities on campus. The house, located at 3515 Fifth
Avenue, was completely redecorated over the summer,
and now sports new furniture and a television set.

The Cross and Crescent men are well represented in
all signiﬁcant aspects of campus life. Although the ‘fra-
ternity had lost many men who graduated and others
who were called to service, Lambda Chi, nevertheless,
ﬁelded dangerous teams in all interfraternity sports.
The chapter is particularly well-represented in the Heinz

344

Time out for daydreams—

Chapel Choir with eight members—this is the highest
representation of any fraternity on campus in the choir.
Other Gamma-Epsilon brothers are active on the Ells-
worth Center Student Council, Student Congress, and
committees of IF Council.

The M0ther’s Club, established in 1948, has been
instrumental in helping the fraternity with their many
social affairs and gifts.

Growth characterized the year 1950 for the Gamma-
Epsilon Alumni Association, and now they are larger
and more active than at any other time since reactiva-
tion. With such capable leadership and close relation-
ship it is evident that the Lambda Chi’s at the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh can look forward to an ever brighter
future.

The officers for 1950-51 were: president, Bob Gergins;
vice president, Paul Black; secretary Jim Fazio; treas-
urer, Al Braun; Social Chairman, Chuck Cravatta.

On December 26, 1848, six students of Miami Uni-
versity at Oxford, Ohio, founded Phi Delta Theta fra-
ternity. Its principles are those of fellowship, duty, and
honor. From this beginning and during the intervening
years, Phi Delta Theta has expanded into one of the
largest national fraternities on college campuses. Along
with Beta Theta Pi and Sigma Chi, Plii Delta Theta
forms the Miami Triad. These three fraternities, to-
gether have a common birthplace at Miami University,
band together once a semester to sponsor the Miami
Triad Formal.

Phi Delta Theta has produced its share of famous
personages. Among them are Benjamin Harrison, for-

back. Iota Chapter, here at the University of Pittsburgh
has its home at 255 North Dithridge Street. It was es-
tablished in 1924, having been preceded by a local fra-
ternity, Delta Sigma Pi.

Present ofﬁcers include Dick Maxwell, president;
Lew Pollock, reporter; George Wallace, secretary; and
Harry Ellis, treasurer. Don Pittard handles the social
affairs, which climax in the spring with the Phi Delt

Formal.

PHI EPSILON PI

The Zeta chapter of Phi Epsilon Pi was founded at
the University of Pittsburgh on December 26, 1913.
Thus it became the second national fraternity chapter
established on the Pitt campus and the fourth oldest
Phi Ep chapter in existence. On September 22, 1947,
Zeta chapter experienced the realization of a long
awaited dream. After a lapse of more than ﬁve years
without a house, the chapter celebrated the opening of
its ﬁne new home at 150 North Dithridge Street. This
climaxed Phi Ep’s most successful year in inter-frater-
nity competition at Pitt. The point total compiled by
the frat was one of the highest in Pitt’s history. Many
Phi Ep’s are active in University organizations, such as
Men’s Council, Pitt Players, the Owl Staff, and Men’s
Debate. Oﬁicers for the year were: president, Irving
Faigen; vice president, Jack Ballon; recording secre-
tary, Ronald Ecker; corresponding secretary, Jack
Cohen; treasurer, Morton Bassel.

  PHI GAMMA DELTA

Respected by the Greek fraternal world, the white
star of Phi Gamma Delta, since its founding in 1848,
has united its brothers under bonds of loyalty, unity,
and fellowship. In the past one hundred three years,
Phi Gamma Delta has grown so that now its chapters
are found on seventy-seven American campuses and at
two Canadian universities, with a living membership
of over thirty thousand Fijis.

Here at Pitt the brothers of Pi Sigma chapter have
tried to uphold the ideals of fraternal organizations.
Rather than emphasizing any single phase of campus
life, they have stressed a balance of interests and activ-
ities. The Fijis have the distinction of winning the IF
All Point Trophy seven of the twelve times that it has
been awarded. Also realizing the value of scholastic
achievement, the Phi Gams have been eager to recap-

ture the ﬁrst place position in the IF scholarship race.

The Fiji social calendar presented a well—rounded
program of activities. Highlighted by the Winter For-
mal at the Highland Country Club, the social season
included many house dances, stag affairs, picnics, and
informal Saturday night get-togethers. Such traditional
events as the Orphan’s Christmas party, the Pig Din-
ner, and the Little Brown Jug with the Alpha chapter
at Washington and Jefferson College made a success-
ful year—one that will be remembered by F ijis long
after college days have ended.

Officers for the year were: president, William F.
Lowry; treasurer, John S. Sturgeon; corresponding
secretary, Harry A. Wissinger; recording secretary,
Roger Bognar.

PHI ‘KAPPA

Nineteen ﬁfty-one, the mid-century year, marked
Phi Kappa’s twenty-‘eighth year at Pitt. Mu chapter of
Phi Kappa again proved to be a vital group on the Pitt
campus, showing leadership in sports, activities, and
social events. Inter,-fraternity competition in football,
track, and basketball has always appealed to men of
Phi Kappa. In the face of the present emergency, Phi
Kap’s realized the need for associative thinking so that
school activities, too, had many Phi Kap representa-
tives at their meetings. To the alumni, Phi Kappa is
synonymous with Pitt; they, as well as the active mem-
bers of the fraternity, feel that as Pitt grows and de-
velops, so will Phi Kappa.

Mu chapter also recognizes that social affairs are

352

another important phase of student development so
that the tea parties, house dances, picnics, and formals
that the fraternity sponsored this past year were well-
attended and thoroughly enjoyed by the Phi Kaps and
their guests. Lunches and dinners are considered an
integral part of the social life of the fraternity, too, and
they promote good feelings and fellowship which are
invaluable in these trying days.

PI KAPPA ALPHA

Pi Kappa Alpha, founded in 1868 through the com-
radeship of six students at the University of Virginia
has ﬂourished and grown into a solidly established
brotherhood with chapters in many colleges and uni-
versities. From the original six members of eight dec-
ades past, the PiKA’s has developed to the point where
it is rated in size among the “big ten”, having over
one hundred active chapters in thirty-six states, and is
highly regarded as a member of the fraternity system.

Pitt’s chapter of PiKA was chartered in 1934 and has
enjoyed prosperity ever since. Gamma Sigma Chapter
prides itself in having more men on ODK walk than
any other fraternity, the latest being Don Wilde, Class
of ’50. PiKA’s prominent in extra-curricular activities
during the Mid-century year were Jim Morton, IF

council president; Roy Titchworth, Men’s Council
prexy; Pat Airhart, Vice—president of Ellsworth Center
SC; and Don Milletary, Jim Brown, and Bud Wendill,
members of Men’s Council. Quarterback Jim Jennings
and. Cheerleader Hank Szymanski represented Pi Kappa
Alpha on the football ﬁeld.

Highlights of the year were a very successful rushing
program under Carl Brueck; the continuance of PiKA
ﬁne intramural athletic teams led by Ron Livingstone
and Al Locknikar; a well-rounded social calendar
planned by Jack Pentecost; and many signiﬁcant im-
provements on the new PiKA house supervised by Bruce
King, Jim Dunbar, and George Hitchens.

Pi Kappa Alpha ofﬁcers this year were president, Jim
Morton; vice president, Don Milletary; secretary, Tom
Kelso; secretary, Chuck Peth.

PI LAMBDA PHI

For Pi Lambda Phi the mid-century year 1950-51 un-
der President Jerry Loevner was a great one. Perhaps
the most important achievement was the completion of
a two year remodeling program. A new “Club” porch
was the ﬁnishing touch to the renovation program. The
Pitt Chapter owns the most modern and efﬁcient house
on campus.

Pi Lam’s had a full social program. Sparked by Social
Chairmen George Zeidenstein and Paul Glosser, Pi
Lam’s showed their enthusiasm with a series of gala
parties, dances, and stags. Top on the social list of the
year were the traditional fall and spring weekend’ for-
mals. Joint parties with other campus fraternities and
tea dances with campus sororities helped ﬁll out the
social calendar. The traditional Senior Banquet, the
newly inaugurated Sunday Breakfast with the Fathers,
and the winter and spring pledge parties rounded out a
successful year. The spirit and success shown at the
social aﬂ"airs were carried over onto the ﬁeld of Inter-
fraternity competition. Pi Lam enjoyed one of its
greatest years, ranking at or near the top in all the IF

sponsored events. Rushing, too, was a success. Under
the direction of Rush Chairman Jack Coppersmith
twenty-four pledges were welcomed during 1950-51.

Pi Lam’s lived up to their tradition of being an ac-
tivity minded group and were engaged in many and
varied organizations. Don Horowitz, Panther magazine
Editor-in-Chief, and Compass Editorial Adviser; Len
Baker, member of Men’s Council, and Chairman of‘
Freshman Orientation; Don Sharapan, member of
Student Congress, member of Ellsworth Center Student
Congress, and Publicity Chairman of Men’s Debate,
represented Pi Lambda Phi in activities.

Other Pi Lam’s who were prominent in activities were
Al Leventhal, Advertising Manager of the Owl; Harold
Hass, IF Rushing Chairman; Marv Jacobson, Photo
Editor of the Owl; Jim Sedler, Humor Editor of the
Panther; and Art Lopatin, Public Relations Director
of ‘the Panther. The year 1950-51 saw a strong Pi
Lambda Phi chapter, not only in social, scholastic, and
athletic affairs, but in fraternal spirit as well.

SIGMA ALPHA EPSILON

Founded at the University of Alabama in 1856,
Sigma Alpha Epsilon is one of the oldest collegiate fra-
ternities in the United States. Today, with one hundred
twenty-six chapters in forty-six states, SAE has the
largest membership of any national fraternity. Va

Pennsylvania Chi Omicron chapter was founded at
the University of Pittsburgh in 1913. Since that date
SAE has taken an active part in campus activities. It
has weathered two world wars, and today, with ﬁfty
active brothers, a modern house, and an active alumni
association, Sigma Alpha. Epsilon looks back on a very
successful history. It is the belief of SAE that fraternity
life is conducive to the development of qualities of
honor, loyalty, and friendship, and that with‘ the bonds
of fraternal organization, the college student can best
equip himself for life and later years. With thisin mind
Chi Omicron planned a successful and enjoyable pro-
gram for the year. Rushing during the fall and spring

semesters featured a circus party, a South Seas party,
and a Gay Nineties party. The two high spots of the
social season were the winter and spring formals. Two
Open House parties for SAE parents, a Christmas party
for orphan children, and numerous house parties
rounded out a successful year.

A big part of every fraternity program is its partici-
pation in inter-fraternity athletics. SAE has taken an
active part in sports, for it believes that healthy minds,
good sportsmanship, and active competition are big
essentials in every man’s college life.

SAE’s were also active in such campus activities as
Student Congress, Men’s Council, IF Council, the track
team, and the baseball team.

Ofﬁcers for the year were as follows: president, Dick
Harper; vice president, Ross Snodgrass; secretary, Bob
Sawhill; and treasurer, Bob Gall.

SIGMA CHI

Since the advent of Sigma Chi in 1855, the fraternity
has progressed to third in the nation in number of
members. Its sweetheart song has spread throughout
the nation and its magazine is one of the best known
fraternity publications. The Beta Theta Chapter was
founded at Pitt in 1902. Since that time it has remained
active except during the two world wars.

The present year started with an excellent fall rush-
ing season and continued in full swing with the Miami
Triad formal, the usual number of tea dances, and the
Sweetheart Ball in the early spring. The athletic com-
mittee did a good job in bringing the Sigma Chi IF
teams close to the top. Beta Theta’s scholastic average
continues to be near the top, and its men are to be
found in Student Congress, Men’s Council, YMCA, and
student publications.

Sigma Chi and Beta Theta chapter look forward to a
bright future on Pitt Campus. This year’s officers were
Dick Shallenberger, president; Jack Hardman, vice
president; Bob Lyles, treasurer; and Jim Johnston,
secretary.

SIGMA PHI EPSILON

Sig  Book-of-month Club.

Sigma Phi Epsilon, founded on November 1, 1901 in
Richmond, Virginia, was ﬁrst seen on Pitt’s campus in
1903. The early group was deactivated in 1911 and
changed to a professional fraternity. The present Sig
Ep chapter was reorganized in the spring of 1948 by
two transfer.students—Phil Zoeller and Jack Adams——
who were Sig Eps at Penn State and Worcester Tech,
respectively.

Since then Sigma Phi- Epsilon at Pitt has increased
in membership to ﬁfty—nine. The chapter’s apartment is
located at 358 Meyran Avenue.

Events of the fall semester which were outstanding
included the pledging of 24 men, a Founder’s Day

362

banquet November 4 at the Sheraton Hotel attended
by Grand National President Dr. W. C. Smolenska, the
Sig Ep Winter Formal at the Jacktowh Hotel, and
football trip to the Pitt-Ohio State game, and parties
for Sig Eps from West Virginia U. and Penn State.

At a reorganization in January the following officers
were named; Ed Turek, president; Normal Tulp, vice
president; Lloyd J. Paxton, comptroller; William R.
Noxon, recording secretary; James Leder, correspond-
ing secretary, and Bob Robosson, historian. Jack Adams
and Charles Warne, previous president and recording
secretary respectively, resigned.

THETA CHI

The past year was one of growth and progress for
Theta Chi. Nationally, the fraternity reached and
passed the one hundred mark in number of chapters.
This was a landmark in the ever-expanding chain which
started at Norwich University in 1856. Theta Chi has
linked together thirty-ﬁve thousand men, among whom
are governors and nationally known band leaders. The
last inactive chapter was recently reorganized. In an
unbroken line, all chapters of Theta Chi are now active
and functioning.

Here on campus the fraternity enjoyed a memorable
year, ending with its playing host to members from

thirteen other chapters during the annual “Corral.” On
May 4 and 5, brothers and alumni from schools in Michi-

“Then what did she say ?—”

gan, Ohio, West Virginia, and Pennsylvania gathered
to strengthen the bonds of Sigma Chi. The program in-
cluded a smoker, luncheon, discussion, and banquet,
culminated by the main ball.

Almost one hundred per cent of the actives and
pledges attended the fraternity’s fall and spring formals.
Both gala affairs were acclaimed successful by all.

Among those graduating are many who helped focus
the light back on Theta Chi since the end of the war. It
was these men who restored the fraternity as a leader
in campus in social, political, and athletic affairs.

Officers for the mid-century year were Joe Campbell,
president; Eugene Roch, vice president; Irwin Bach-
mann, secretary; Jim Mullen, pledgemaster; Glen
Schuch, treasurer.

Education

With the Mid-century marking new advances along the line of 3
public instruction, the place of the School of Education in the scheme
of national interest is of increasing importance, The School of Educa-
tion under Dean Samuel P. Franklin is prepared to furnish up-to-date
instruction in nine separate divisions of the ﬁeld through the direc-
tion of faculty and heads of departments.

At the head of the department of BUSINESS EDUCATION is S De Kar1C- 11- Oermann
Dr. D. D. Lessenberry, who has lent both his genial friendliness and
his initials to Delta Delta Lambda Honorary Fraternity. Dr. G. A.
Yoakam, head of the department of ELEMENTARY EDUCATION,
is faced at Mid-century point with a shortage of elementary teachers,
while Dr. William A. Yeager is involved in supplying school officials
from his department of SCHOOL ADMINISTRATION. At the
helm of the department of SECONDARY EDUCATION is capable
Dr. George Gould, and Dr. W. W. D. Sones directs the courses of
GENERAL EDUCATION. As respective heads of _the departments
of PHYSICAL EDUCATION FOR MEN AND WOMEN are Dr.
Karl’ C. H. Oermann and Dr. Minnie L. Lynn. I

Moving on to the ﬁeld of RELIGIOUS EDUCATION, students
ﬁnd helpful guidance in Dr. Lawrence C. Little, head of the depart-
ment. In the important region of vocational advisors, Charles P.

ALPHA PHI ALPHA

Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity, like many fraternities
and organizations has been hit hard by the Korean
emergency. Many of the brothers have left school,
some for the second time, to ﬁght for freedom and de-
mocracy. Despite Uncle Sam, however, the Alpha’s
have a pledge club of eighteen. They also have a very
active Mothers’ Club, which is giving the house that
certain touch. Alpha Phi Alpha was started in 1906
by seven Negroes at Cornell University who were
desirous of more friendly and literary contact with
each other than the classroom afforded them. From the
founding of Alpha chapter at Cornell to the present,
Alpha Phi Alpha has developed into a corporation of
21% chapters with two overseas chapters, one being at
Oxford, England. As the Alpha Hymn states, “Manly
deeds, scholarship, and love for all mankind are the
aims of our dear fraternity.” Although Omicron is
composed of Negroes only at present, Alpha Phi Alpha
is the only inter-racial fraternity on campus. The pres-
ent officers are: president, William E. Green; vice pres-
ident, D. Hervert Wallace; secretary, Henry L. Heins,

Kappa Beta Phi, the youngest social fraternity on
campus, was founded on the principles of good-fellow-
ship, reasonable ﬁnance, and a small membership to
insure complete social cohesion. Today its members,
composed of the various denominations of the Catholic,
Jewish, and Protestant faiths, enjoy a full program of
social events without the high dues that go with national
afﬁliation.

The social calendar consists of two planned aﬂairs
each month in addition to the weekly impromptu dates
and stags. Mixer dances are held with Various academic
and nursing schools. The highlights of the social calen-
darare the two formal balls, one of which is the tradi-
tional President’s Ball held each spring at the Hill Crest
Country Club. The fraternity takes an active part in
all student and Interfraternity affairs, but it is known
best to the student body for its participation in the an-
nual Spring Festival with its “Coconut Grove,” com-
plete with hula dancers.

Kappa Beta Phi also holds the distinction of being one
of the few fraternities on campus that was founded at
the University. Its small but growing list of alums al-
ready includes men in the various graduate schools
throughout the country aside from those who now hold
promising positions in industry and commerce.

SIGMA ALPHA MU

In the 41 years since its founding at City College in
New York, Sigma Alpha Mu has averaged more than
one new chapter for each year of its existence.

Psi chapter is well known on the Pitt campus for its
outstanding social functions and the enthusiasm of its
members. The fraternity always takes part in Spring
Carnival festivities and IF sports events.

The Sammies have many men in campus activities.
They are represented by members in ODK and the
Druids, on the Owl staff, and a manager of the varsity
basketball team.

A three day spring affair highlighted by a formal din-
ner dance at the Highland Country Club and a Winter
Founders Day Formal at the Fort Pitt Hotel topped
off the social calendar for the year.

Psi chapter has grown and will continue to grow at
Pitt because the men of Sigma Alpha Mu plan a bigger
better future for the fraternity.

The officers are president, Robert Forman; vice
president, Harold Smolar; treasurer, Harold Levinson;
secretary, Harvey Krevolin.

Sigma Pi fraternity was founded at Vincennes tlni-
versity in 1897. Since then it has grown both in num-
bers and chapters until today it numbers 45 active
chapters. Chi Chapter of the I'niversity of Pittsburgh
was chartered in 1923. During the war, due to extensive
drafting, Chi Chapter went inactive. In l\Iarch, 1948,
with the help of Theta Chapter at Penn State, Sigma
Pi came back onto Pitt’s campus with its first pledge
class of 14 Inembers. The new chapter quickly gained
popularity on campus in the ﬁelds of academic work,
interfraternity activities, events, and sports. Today
Chi numbers 30 men and 10 pledges.

Chi took pride this year in its fall trips to out-of-
town football games where Pitt members not onl_v sup-
ported their team but also met brothers from other
colleges and universities. At the same time Chi extended
invitations, as it does each fall, to its brothers on Pitt’s
home schedule. In this way the chapter has made many
lasting friendships with its brothers from other schools.
At present Chi is fifth in scholastic averages of all
Sigma Pi chapters.

The officers for 1950-51 were president, Robert Davis;
councilors, Lawrence Loeffler, \Villiam VVest, Robert
Wilson, and Kenneth Linnaman; herald, William Leach.

Pitt’s Stray Greek Fraternity is the only organiza-
tion of its kind on any college campus. It is composed
of transfer fraternity men who do not have a chapter
of their group on campus. The Stray Greek Fraternity
was founded at the University of Pittsburgh in 1947.

As members of IF Council the Stray Greek cousins
participate in welfare and social activities sponsored by
IF. The 1949-50 school year saw the Strays achieve the
highest scholastic standing among Pitt social frater-
nities. All work and no play is not its standard, how-
ever, because Stray Greek functions provide hearty
fun and strong fellowship.

The outstanding member of the Stray Greeks is Dr.
Ferguson, a Phi Kappa Psi from Columbia University,
who is also faculty adviser for the Strays. The Stray
Greeks are also grateful to and proud of their other
faculty adviser, Dr. Ted Parker.

The Stray Greek Fraternity looks forward to another
enjoyable and successful year at Pitt.

Officers for the year were president, George Edinger;
vice president, Robert Leigh; secretary-treasurer,
F elton Pinner.

On October 28, 1950, the Freshman Class held
their annual dance at the Schenley Hotel in the
main ballroom. This all-student dance sponsored
each year by the Freshmen was attended by both
the students and the alumni. A very enjoyable
evening was had by all who attended. The theme
for the dance was a homecoming and the alumni
were the guests. A pigeon was used to signify the
alumni returning. The decorations consisted of
footballs and banners in the Pitt Blue and gold
colors.

Benny Benack and his orchestra provided the
music. During the intermission entertainment
was provided by the Freshmen. The chairmen for
the dance were Bob McGuire, general chairman.
Bill Duffy, business chairman, Irv Rubin, enter-
tainment, and Dick Bergad decoration.

On February 16, 1951, the Schenley Hotel was
the scene of Cupid’s Dance, the Heart Hop. This
annual dance sponsored by the women’s classes
was a gala aﬁair enjoyed by the 600 people who
attended. The decorations were very appropriately
taken care of by the decoration committee under
the capable leadership of Liz Murphy. Big cards
were displayed around the ballroom with pictures
of the different cards in the suite of Hearts. The
entertainment at intermission was provided by a
group of girls from the Heinz Chapel Choir. The
music was furnished by our own Benny Benack
and his orchestra. The other chairmen for the
dance were Reva Parish, general chairman, Mary
McParland, business chairman, Betty McKay,
publicity chairman, Dolores Bernstein and Tema
Seidman, ticket chairmen, Claire Brackmann,
program chairman, and Adele Maraccini, hostess
chairman.

INTERFRATERNITY BALL

I.F. Social Committee

Winning Delta Tau Delta sing team. To the dreamy music of Hal McIntyre.

On January 19, 1951 after being postponed from
December 1, the Inter-Fraternity Ball was held
in the Schenley Hotel. The aﬁair was held on the
theme of a Greek Ball. Favors were given to the
dates of the fraternity men. They were miniature
paddles embossed with the crest of the Inter-
Fraternity Council. Dancing was held in two
ballrooms to the music of Baron Elliot and Hal
McIntyre and their orchestras. During the inter-
mission the winner of the Inter-Fraternity Sing
was presented with the award for the contest.
After the award the winner sang for the couples.
This year Delta Tau Delta had the pleasure of be-
ing the selected ones. After the singing, the award
for the all-point trophy went to Phi Epsilon
Pi, this year’s winner. Following that award was
the presentation of the Scholarship award and this
was given to the Stray Greeks. The Social Chair-
man for the affair was Joe Edmundson. The associ-
ate chairmen were Jack Beerman, programs;
Cammillo Carrolli, tickets; Tom Alexander, pub-
licity; Fred Nicely, decorations; Bob Robosson,
invita.tions;.and Bud Trunick, favors.

MILITARY BALL

On March 16, 1951, the annual Reserve Ofﬁcers Training Corps
Military Ball was held at West View Park’s Danceland. The dance
was attended by approximately 2000 people. Most of those who
attended were ROTC Cadets and their dates, but the Navy,
Marines, and the Royal Canadian Air Force were represented. The
highlight of the evening was held at intermission. Colonel Holland
Robb, PMS & T of the University of Pittsburgh announced the
name of the candidate which had been voted the Queen of the
Military Ball. This was the ﬁrst year that a queen was chosen, and
this year’s honor went to Miss Pegge Wallick, the candidate of
the Arnold Air Society. The queen was attended by the other two
candidates Miss Arlene Cohen and Miss Barbara Bunting. All
three of the lovely ladies were presented with beautiful bouquets
of ﬂowers. After the intermission, the dancing continued to the
music of Charlie Barnett and his orchestra with Adele Frances and
Bill Derry handling the vocals. The credit for making the dance
such a success goes to Bill Sullivan, General Chairman, Leo
Kaireys, Business Chairman, Bob Kurey, Publicity Chairman, and
Don Barrett, Ticket Chairman.

SPRING FESTIVAL

Bob Lyles
Chairman

The Spring Festival of ’51 was literally a “bang
up” affair. Weeks before the actual festival, stu-
dents were building up the true western spirit.
The “cowboy panther” was seen on bulletin
boards, notebooks, and car windows. A beard
growing contest brought forth stubble both long
and unusual, for there were prizes offered for the
best of each. On “Howdy Day” students dropped
the formality introductions and greeted each other
with “Howdy Pall” Last but not least we enthus-
iastically welcomed the western boost of Don
Eagle, who strolled through our tuckshops and
cafeteria.

Levi’s and ten gallon hats were the order of the
week. Festival opened on Saturday, May 12, with
the /[host unusual football game in Pitt history.
Pitt students were convinced that spring football,
especially the intra-squad variety, is a terriﬁc
idea, and the Pitt band helped make the day un
forgettable. P

Classes were dismissed on Monday afternoon,
May 14, for Tap Day and Varsity Day. This was
followed by the traditional ﬂoat parade. The
theme, “Range Rhythms” inspired clever and
original ﬂoats based on western songs, old and
new. Students wound up the afternoon at the
“Last Chance Dance,” held in the social room at
Foster Memorial.

Carnival, held on Tuesday, Wednesday and
Thursday nights, was dubbed “Red Eye Gulch.”
The cathedral lawn became an inhabited ghost-
town with saloons, medicine shows and throngs
of whoopin’ cowboys and injins.

Wednesday was the day of the sweepstakes,
held this year at the stadium, and untraditionally
run on a relay basis, and on Thursday afternoon,
Pitt students took over the stadium once more to
view the inter-fraternity track meet. The partici-
pants may have been exhausted from the gay week
but they kept things moving.

Friday night was the carnival roundup to end
all roundups. The Main Ball, the Gold Rush that
is. was something extra special. Cowboys and gals
crowded West View’s Danceland to hear none
other than Harry James.

Calamity Jane, the lovely Main Ball queen,
chosen appropriately enough by Hopalong Cassidy
was there crowned with cowboy hat and six—guns.

Maybe it was a hangover of our double—feature
western days or maybe it was the feeling that this
might be the last big festival for a long time
whatever the reason, the Spring Festival of 1951
was the biggest in history.

Congratulations

QUR congratulations and good wishes to the young men and women who are graduating

from the University of Pittsburgh.
You face a disturbed world.

A powerful and godless regime seeks to impose its pagan ways upon the rest of the
world either by open warfare or subversive and secret methods designed to undermine and

sap the strength of all who are strong enough to oppose.

Our strength rests upon our capacity for individual liberty and our ability to retain and
‘enjoy this liberty is determined by our moral and spiritual fibre. You cannot have one
without the other. They are interdependent and inseparable. The extent to which we have
had both is the secret of our great material power and productive strength. The extent to
which we grow in individual moral and spiritual strength will measure the extent we remain

individually free and materially strong.

Your future and the future of all free men and women will depend on how we in America

measure up in this test of our capacity for liberty.

THE GREAT Pittsburgh Exposition
at the Point was a gala annual
fall festival. There was a massive
Main Hall, all towers and turrets,
with ﬂying ﬂags and bunting swags
festooned across the archways.

O NEARBY WAS Mechanical Hall,
an engineering marvel of iron and
glass that glittered like a thousand
diamonds in the new incandescent
lamps. Here the industries of West-
ern Pennsylvania exhibited their
wares—steel, glass, coal, and food.

0 ALWAYS a landmark, the Heinz
exhibit drew Pittsburghers like a
magnet. The show varied every
year. Sometimes pretty girls, pack-
ing pickles or wrapping packages,
were featured . . . again it might be
foreign imports, or our plant culti-
vation program. But the hometown
folks could always be sure of gen-
erous samples of the 57 Varieties.

0 GREAT MUSIC hovered in the air
—Sousa, Damrosch, Paur, and Vic-
tor Herbert, with forty-ﬁve piece
orchestras and a chorus of three

hundred. The switchback railway
took bold blades on a roller-coaster
“aerial ﬂight through spacei’ The
new cinematograph offered a "per-
fect illusion of lifei’

O BOAT RIDES, an illumined foun-
tain playing in the river, paintings
from Paris in the art gallery, cider,
popcorn, and 1emonade—it was an
exciting mixture of razzmatazz, cul-
ture, and industrial prowess. It was
a young giant ﬂexing his muscles at
work and play.

VVVVVVVVV

0 THE GIANT has matured today.
And a new life has begun along the
Allegheny. Point Park and Gateway
Center are a dream beginning to
come true.

0 ON OUR SIDE of the river we,
too, have dreamed of progress. Some
of our early buildings have recently
been razed. And in their place will
soon rise modern steel and glass
factories, a warehouse, and a science
center . . . the better to serve you.

Office of

Mid-century ﬁnds Miss Helen Pool Rush,
University of Pittsburgh Dean of Women,
celebrating her thirtieth year in the Dean of
Women’s Office. A Pitt graduate, Dean Rush
rose from an Assistant to the Dean to Assistant
Dean of VVomen and subsequently on the
death of Pitt’s ﬁrst Dean of VVomen, Thrysa
W. Amos, l\Iiss Rush accepted her present post
in 1941. She was instrumental in the Mentor
system since its inception and despite her
pressing work, still spends a full week helping
Mentors prepare for the work of making Fresh-
man women feel at home in the University.
This year marked the crystallization of one of
the Dean of VVomen’s fondest plans. With the
opening of the twelfth ﬂoor kitchen in Novem-
ber, Miss Rush saw the possibilities of a com-
plete women’s ﬂoor coming nearer to comple-
tion. The women of the University showed their
interest in future plans by cooperating to the
fullest extent in furnishing the kitchen. Dean
Rush also saw the inclusion of a Twelfth Floor
Guild in the present Guild system as a step
forward in teaching women what there is to
know about nutrition and other problems of
home economy. Miss Rush is looking ahead to
greater improvements in the material setup of
the Dean of Women’s office. But realizing the
need for a deﬁnite philosophy for complete
college and post college life, Miss Rush con-
tinues to inspire the women of the University
in the ﬁne way of life.

THE DEAN OF WOMEN

Since the establishment of the Office of the Dean of
VVomen in 1919, the office has grown to include not only
ﬁve assistants to the Dean of Women, but also a secretarial
staff of three women. Serving as official hostesses of the
University, as well as guides and administrators interested
in the welfare of the woman student, the Dean of Women’s
staff is composed of young, interested, cultured women.
Mid-century as a turning point ﬁnds that with the excep-
tion of Miss Adrienne Aldisert, Assistant in charge of
Nationality Classrooms, all the members of the staff are
new this year. In charge of the Information Room is Miss
Mary Elizabeth Van Kirk, a Pitt graduate, with another
Pitt alumna, l\Irs. Marjorie Zulauf Cox in the Heinz
Chapel. Housing and Placement Services for women are
under the direction of Mrs. Patricia Byers. On the Twelfth
Floor is Miss Jean Risser who is Women’s Activities ad-
Viser.

The Office of the Dean of Women carries out its individ-
ual business and also aids in the broad Freshman Orienta-
tion program for women. At any University function the
members of the staff serve as advisors, hostesses, and
faculty aides. The staff of the Office of the Dean of Women
has as its major long range plan for the future, the expan-
sion of the Freshman program and the increased develop-
ment of the women of the University along educated,
cultured lines. There is also the hope that at some time in
the future there will be a major material boost in dormi-
tory facilities, student union space, and a completed, well-
equipped Twelfth Floor for the women students of the
University of Pittsburgh. Until then they will continue
to furnish fresh life to Pitt.

Office of

Few Pitt students, if any, could complete
four years of college without coming in con-
tact with Theodore W. Biddle, Dean of Men.
From 8 30 in the morning until 5 o’clock or
later Dean Biddle spends his time in meetings,
appointments, and committees in an attempt
“to provide spiritual assistance, moral strength,
and especially to try to make the University a
comfortable place in which to live.” As a result
his 8th ﬂoor ofﬁce is one of the busiest places in
the cathedral. A familiar ﬁgure at campus
events, the Dean is chairman of numerous
committees among which are freshman week,
University housing, publications board. He is
also treasurer for Religion in Life Week. Despite
his busy schedule at Pitt, Dean Biddle still
can ﬁnd plenty of time to spend at home with
his wife, Ruby Anne, and his two children,
Susanna and Theodore. As his tenth year as
Dean of l\Ien draws to a close, Dean Biddle
can look back over a very busy time indeed.

THE OWL

This is your Owl; it is a record of your four years at Pitt. This is our
Owl, too; it is the accumulation of our talent, our sweat, and our spirit.
We have put everything we’ve got into this book in the hope that you
will ﬁnd pleasure in remembering. We ﬁnd pleasure remembering, too~—
remembering the beginning, the long hours of work, and the end.

The 1951 Owl had its beginning in the spring of 1950 when the staff
was chosen and subsequently acquainted with the overall program of
producing the book. Call it advantage . . . call it disadvantage but there
were few, very few, experienced staﬂ members back from the ’50 Owl.
The majority of the staff was new to the problems, of producing a book
such as the Owl. During the spring term, preliminary plans were worked
out so that when school let out for the summer, Editor Leizer Balk and
a few trusted associates started the planning. The “Big Three,” Bob
Fuhr, Managing Editor; Ken Schwartz, Art Editor; and Leizer, Editor-
in-chief aided by Rosemary Squillante, Publications Assistant, and Renee
Friedman Skirboll, 1950 Owl Editor; made the preliminary design for the
1951 baby. The basic plans included overall design, theme, cover, division
pages, layouts for the larger sections, type of types, and use of color.

During this time, Jerry Simon, Business Manager, plotted the adver-
tising, publicity, circulation campaigns, placing a manager in charge of
each division. It fell to Jerry to devise ways and means for ﬁnancing the
book. As far as the Owl was concerned, Jerry didn’t care a “hoot” for
expenses, but ends must meet.

When school reconvened, the Business staﬂ’ swung into action. Con-
tracts were sent out to organizations and prospective advertisers. Circu-
lation staff under the Sheriff, Harry Scharf, started out with a booming
sales campaign. Al Levanthal and Frank Hornak began their intensive
advertising campaign to raise their portion of staﬁ budget.

On the editorial side, various staffs were laying the foundations of the
book by gathering fractions of the page. Len Baker and Clair Brackmann
had their share of headaches gathering copy for the Honorary and Pro-
fessional organizations. Brenda McCauley gathered Student Government
copy. Pat Clohessy and Steve Kostic took care of sororities and fraterni-
ties respectively and respectably. The scheduling of group pictures and
identiﬁcation, headed by Peggy Myers, Ellen Weisband and Agnes
Bruun, moved smoothly on toward deadline time.

Soon the Schenley roomwas taken over by theportrait photographer
from Delma Studios. While this went on, copy that had been gathered
was dumped into the lap of Grace Salzman, Literary Editor, and her
staff to be written and rewritten. This rewritten copy found its way to

~ MAKES HISTORY IN 1951

the overloaded desk of Typing Chief, Roz Hirsh, and her staff to be
typed according to printer’s speciﬁcations.

Layouts were due on certain sections under the supervision of the
editor—Ed Murphy, Athletic Section; Chuck Solof, Sweetheart; Joan
Stigers, Sorority and Fraternity. Informal sections were done by Barbara
Tex and Beverly Muir.

The Senior Activities Index was typed under the supervision of Roz
Hirsh. Marv Jacobson, Photo Editor and his small staﬁ took all the pic-
tures needed for the layouts. Greek informals by Briskin and Moltz,
Sports by Stokes, Jacobson and Greenberg. Much difficulty was encoun-
tered in scheduling these pictures due to the “big snow” and lost time due ‘
to faulty equipment.

With the layout, pictures, copy and Id. gathered, they were turned
over to the production staff. This time the stall’ went on a six day work
week with the innovation of a Saturday Work Shop. At these workshops
Gloria Heneghan and Marian Isaac started to put the pages together in
the Fraternity and Sorority sections. Dan Berger and Bob Fulton pasted
up the informal sections. Ed Murphy put the Sports section together.
Peg Myers and Mary Ann Babinsky arranged the Fine Arts and Student
Government section.

Most of the pages were ﬁnally assembled during the mid-semester
vacation. Long twelve hour days were common but the long hard hours
paid oﬂ’.

In preparing this book, innumerable details were taken care of by the
Oﬂice Editor, Sally Schloss, in carrying out the Editor’s orders which
are hard to enforce at times. I

All in all, this resume seems as though everything went smoothly but
it was much the opposite. Diﬂiculties were encountered from every
source. Lack of student interest in Pitt was the cause of decreased sales.
Photography equipment was old and few in parts. The inexperienced
staff which proved willing to work and did but didn’t start out as much.
Lack of cooperation from organizations and students also presented
serious repercussions. University cooperation was not too cordial. But
due to a few spirited students who gave their time, thought, and grades
because of the desire for a better book for you, the student of Pitt and for a
better Pitt, this book was given out to outstanding seniors on Tap Day.
For the ﬁrst time in four years it was produced on time. I‘ hope you like
the book, and in doing so realize the hard work, and the long hours, put
into it and thank those students who made this book possible by doing
’ the virtually impossible under poor conditions here today. Thank God!

 
  

thanks to the deserving few . . .

Another school year draws to a close and the 1951 Owl comes out on time. With it are many mem-
ories, some pleasant, and others that best stay forgotten. But now is a good time to stop and think
and thank the many people who contributed to the production of your yearbook . . . people who helped
make this edition of the Owl come out on time, yet giving you a four color cover, a larger Senior
Section, and more photographs for you to remember your life at Pitt.

First of all many thanks are in order for one of the hardest working staffs ever to honor the Eighth
Floor by their presence. Everyone carried out their assignments, some sooner, some later but still
doing the work well. Managing Editor BOB FUHR heads the list for his layouts and ideas and gen-
eral guidance of the staff. Literary Editor GRACE SALZMAN wrote the clever captions and edited
all of the copy to meet her deadlines and yet make the copy interesting.

ROZ HIRSH and SALLY SCHLOSS, Typing and Oﬁice Editors respectively, helped meet the
deadlines by the typing, organizing, and taking care of the little details that help slow up the pro-
duction of a yearbook.

MARV JACOBSON, Photography Editor, did an excellent job on the carrying out of his photo
assignments, with the help of a small but willing staff consisting of LEN BRISKIN, GEORGE
STOKES, and IRV GREENBERG.

ED MURPHY, ﬁlled the position of Sports Editor most capably, by drawing the layouts, sizing
the pictures, and the writing of captions.

KEN SCHWARTZ, Art Editor, drew the layouts for the Division pages and the other clever

cartoons that helped to carry out the theme.
MARY ANN BABINSKY, PEGGY MYERS, GLORIA HENEGHAN, and MARIAN ISAAC

combined their talents and willingness to work to form the backbone of the production staff. The
Fine Arts, Student Government, Sorority and Fraternity Sections can be chalked to their credit. i

First Year staﬂ’ members who worked beyond the call of duty were GEORGE STOKES—Photog—
raphy, CLAIRE BRACKMAN and LEN BAKER—Organizations, FRANK MCWRIGHT——
Literary, and BOB FULTON and DAN BERGER——~Layout.

MR. GEORGE HACKENBERG, the present Publications Adviser, and MR. PAUL LOH-
MEYER his predecessor, gave innumerable help with timely suggestions and advice. MRS. RENEE
SKIRBOLL, the 1950 Editor who helped us along this year, constantly cheering up the staff, mainly
the Editor, that all was not hopeless.

JERRY SIMON, this year’s Business Manager, who did a ﬁne job of ﬁnancing the 1951 Owl,
and helped the Editor in many a way.

MR. THOMAS JARRET, University Photographer, for his advice and kind assistance.

Thanks, too, must be extended to RALPH BENZ, DON MESSINGER, and FRANK O’NEILL
of S. K. Smith, William J . Keller and Delma Studios respectively, for their close cooperation and
cheerful advice.

And many thanks are due to William J . Keller Inc., our printers, for their special care of our book
and to all the personnel there connected with printing our book, each taking a personal interest in
giving us a better book. MRS. JEWELL M. GATES of William J . Keller deserves an extra pat on
the back for her help with this book.

To the CHEM. ENGINEERS of 1952, loud cheers are in order for their help in keeping the Editor
up in his classes as you know the Editor must attend school while producing the Owl.

I am also indebted to JIM BROWN of the Michigan State Wolverine for his helpful suggestions
and MISS SALLY FLETCHER of Stephen’s College for her valuable advice and cheering up of
the Editor.

Thus you have seen the names of those people responsible for producing the 1951 Owl, together
with the Editor. I hope you like it. ‘

HE DEAN OF MEN

Student rallies, publications, fraternities, senior place-
ment—all a part of life at Pitt—are under the guidance of
the Office of the Dean of l\Ien. Seven Assistants aid Dean
Biddle in achieving his goal of a well rounded student life
for every man at Pitt. Fraternities are the chief concern of
Lester B. Brailey, who is also the director of scholarships.
Job placement for male students is handled by Charles
Ebert, Jr. J. Edward Ricart directs Men’s Housing as well
as being adviser to student activities. Student publica-
tions go to George R. Hackenberg, a newcomer this year,
for advice and direction. Another newcomer, Richard
Cunningham, is adviser to l\Ien’s council and director of
orientation. Veteran affairs are in the hands of “"illiam F.
Saalbach who also advises student activities. Student mar-
shalls are the domain of Joseph Hedges, Campus Proctor.
l\Ir. Hedges is the only member of the staﬂ who is not to
be found on the 8th floor. The ﬁrst ﬂoor Information Room
is his headquarters.

ALUMNI
  ASSOCIATION

Appetites were ﬁlled as
alumni ate in the smorgas-

bord style.

The General Alumni Association of the University
of Pittsburgh is the organization which represents all
alumni of the University. It is comprised of eleven
constituent associations representing each school of
the University and the Alumni. The governing
body is the Alumni Council. Each person who re-
ceives a degree is automatically considered a mem-
ber and enjoys voting privileges in the association.
The members of the association elect a total of ten
members of the Board of Trustees and the Council
elects two members to the Athletic Policy Com-
mittee. The general purpose of the association is to
represent the alumni of the University and to inter-
pret the University to the alumni. Activities include
a Fall Homecoming Celebration, a Children’s Christ-
mas Party and the Spring Homecoming and Reunion

 

Celebration including the World-Famous Smorgas-
bord. In addition, the association publishes the
“Alumni News Review” which is mailed ﬁve times
per year without charge to every alumnus whose
correct address is on ﬁle. The association also oper-
ates an Annual Alumni Giving Fund, the purpose
of which is to promote the progress of the University
of Pittsburgh by securing annual contributions
from the University’s alumni for the development
and support of better and broader educational serv-
ices to the students, alumni, and community in
general. The names of the contributors are published
in the current issue of the “Alumni News Review”
by the school and class and are again shown in the
annual report—“The Blue Book of Pitt Alumni.”

The Owl gives its blocks a deeper meaning with steps
leading to a plateau upon which new blocks may be
added . . . a new library or a new science building . . . a
new aid to the backbone of our University life, the
classes: a broadening of the conception of life, new
philosophies and information to guide the leaders of
the new half—century.

19504951 MID/—CENfI‘URY

A time for counting past blessings

And looking forward; T

A time for recalling past glories,

And for anticipating glories to come:

The recollection of the building of the Cathedral

And the actuality of our dreams for the new Building
Program.

A time for taking account of the mistakes of the past,
And a time for avoiding mistakes in the future;

A time for solving old problems,

And facing problems to come.

This is the time when Twentieth Century Americans
Take stock and second wind;

This is the time for a new beginning, a new era
\/Vhen, armed with knowledge, a sense of beauty,
And a desire for truth, i

Our graduates gird themselves for life in the

Fifty years to come, and forever after

VVhen, with concrete and mortar arid hope and faith
They build new monuments to the”

Greater Glory of their Alma lVIater.
