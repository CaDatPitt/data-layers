ersity of

During the span ofmore than two centuries,

the University of Pittsburgh has grown and evolved
into a nationally recognized institution of higher
education, establishing a name that is equated with
excellence and achievement.

Founded in 1787 by Hugh Henry Brackenridge,

the Pittsburgh Academy began its humble begin-
nings in a log cabin. Thirty—two years later, it gained
university status and was renamed the Western
University of Pennsylvania. In 1908, Pitt underwent
a ﬁnal name change, becoming the University of
Pittsburgh, a school that has forged the way in the
ﬁelds of science, sports, medicine, and more.

Pitt’s real legacy, however, is in the accomplishments
of its alumni. Among Pitt's many notable graduates
are Nobel laureates Paul Lauterbur and Wangari
Maathai, Shaw Prize recipient Herb Boyer, and
Pulitzer Prize-winning author Michael Chabon.
Athletes like Pro Football Hall of Famer Dan
Marino and John Woodruff, who won the gold
medal in the 800-meter run at the 1936 Olympics,
began their careers at Pitt.

In the 222 years since it was founded, the University
of Pittsburgh has risen in prominence and become
known across the country and around the world
for its distinguished alumni.

Recreation and Fitness

 

The “freshman 15” are dreaded words to many
college students, but the University of Pittsburgh
makes life easier by offering many ways for students
to work out and get in great shape.

In 2002, the University opened its largest athletic
facility, the John M. and Gertrude E. Petersen
Events Center, which is home to the Baierl Student
Recreation Center. The complex provides students
with weight lifting and cardio equipment. Trees
Hall is another facility where students can work
out. This building includes basketball, volleyball,
handball, and racquetball courts, along with a
gymnastics area, two swimming pools, a dance
studio, and a rock—climbing wall to accompany

its gym.

Belleﬁeld Hall is another option, as it houses a gym
and a swimming pool. Dormitory buildings such as
the Litchﬁeld Towers and Amos, Lothrop, Panther,

ALL THAT JAZZ

When people think of the University of Pittsburgh,
they usually think of the opportunity to receive

a great education, engage in the latest research in
various ﬁelds, or watch some of the ﬁnest athletics in
the country. What some people don’t know about is
Pitt’s role in creating one of the best institutions at
which to learn about and listen to jazz music.

For the past 38 years, the University of Pittsburgh
has hosted jazz musicians from around the world
at the annualjazz Seminar and Concert. This

year’s concert featured the music of trumpeter
Mike Mossman, drummer Leon Ndugu Chancler,

   

and alto saxophonist Antonio Hart. These and other
jazz musicians conducted lectures, demonstrations,
and clinics at area schools leading up to the night

of the concert.

Pitt also houses the International Academy of
Jazz Hall of Fame, which recognizes the great jazz
musicians of the past and present. And Pitt’s]azz
Ensemble is considered to be one of the best
collegiate jazz groups today and has performed
its music worldwide.

studying on hold to enjoy winter in Pittsburgh.
University clubs also participate in the winter fun,
providing students with skiing, snowboarding,
and snow tubing trips sponsored by the Pitt Ski
and Snowboard Club. When students need a place
to study, they turn to the Cathedral Commons
Room, where warm ﬁres are lit and decorations
set the mood for the holidays.

As the holidays approach, the Commons Room and
Nationality Rooms are adorned with decorations,
like this Christmas tree in the Norwegian Classroom.

UNCOMMON GROUNDS

Upon entering the Cathedral of Learning Commons
Room, with its neo-Gothic archways and dramatic
chandeliers, it’s easy to think you’ve hopped on a
broom and ﬂown to Hogwarts. But, despite its
magical undertone, the Commons Room is a real
place where students can ﬁnd a quiet place to study
or take a break between classes.

Covering more than 22,000 square feet, the
Commons Room draws visitors from around

the world with its magniﬁcent architecture. The
walls, which stretch to a staggering height of three
stories, lure awestruck eyes to the vaulted ceilings
that overlook the gray stone ﬂoor; such decor
creates an ambience appropriate for studying

and quiet thinking.

The Commons Room contains many distinguishing
architecturalfeatures, such as the vaulted ceiling,
neo-Gothic columns, and distinctive lightﬁxtures.

.

E. I

D
.s_ ,

Open 24 hours a day and offering wireless
Internet service, the Commons Room is not only
architecturally beautiful but also is a useful
facility. Equipped with wooden tables and chairs,
the Commons Rooms is the perfect place for
students to study between classes or to meet with
both professors and fellow classmates.

to the Commons Room displays

”Here is eternal spring,-foryou
the very stars ofheaven are new."

PRESIDENT'S LETTER

2008 Student Government Board

Fellow Pitt Students,

A time that has always seemed far away is suddenly
upon us: We are graduating from college. Over the
past four years, we have lived and grown together
as Pitt students, and that time is now coming to an
end. What used to be discussions of what classes we
were taking next term have turned into discussions

about our next steps in life.

Personally, I do not know what the future has in
store for me. When I came here, I had no idea what
I wanted to do with my life, and now, four years
later, I am still unsure. Like all of you, I have been
applying both for jobs and graduate schools, and
I am excited and nervous, and even a little scared
at times, about the decisions I must make. I am
conﬁdent, though, that Pitt has prepared me for
life after college, both professionally and socially.

 Bcm R.

My time here at Pitt has been the greatest of my life.
Even though there have been highs and lows, I have
cherished every moment, and I’m sure you all feel

the same way. I am proud to have been a Pitt student

and will never forget this wonderful place.

Congratulations, and hail to Pitt!

ARo;iN

Diversity is not an idea taken lightly at the
University of Pittsburgh; it is an essential part of

the school’s mission and philosophy. The Nationality

Rooms in the Cathedral of Learning are among
the most interesting and deﬁning manifestations
of Pitt’s commitment to diversity.

Begun following a suggestion by former Chancellor
John Bowman, 26 Nationality Rooms encircling
the Cathedral Commons Room on the ﬁrst and
third ﬂoors were completed between 1938 and
2000. With chairs, desks, and artifacts brought

in from around the world, the Nationality Rooms
emulate historical settings and captivate thousands
of visitors each year.

Injune 2008, the Welsh Room joined the world-
renowned collection. Designed to resemble the
Penrhiw Chapel at St. Fagans National History
Museum in Cardiff, Wales, the Welsh Room
showcases an oak long case clock, box pews, and
a carved stone dragon over the door that represents
the red dragon of Wales.

The Nationality Rooms, symbols of diversity and
cultural awareness, will continue to grow as the
Cathedral of Learning awaits new additions,
including the Danish, Finnish, Latin American,
Philippine, Swiss, Thai, and Turkish rooms.

As a student at the University of Pittsburgh, it is very
hard to go all four years without setting foot inside
the William Pitt Union. Originally opened in 1898
as the Schenley Hotel, the William Pitt Union has
undergone multiple renovations over the past
century that have converted this beautiful building
into the student union that so many have come

to know and love.

Recent renovations have provided students with
club oﬂices upgraded for functionality and appeal
as well as lounges like Nordy’s Place, designed for
recreation and leisure. Home to hundreds of student
organizations and the site of many student events,
the William Pitt Union provides a haven for
students to come together and share their interests
with fellow classmates.

Ihe Tansky Family Lounge welcomes students to study,
relax, and converse withfellow classmates.

A ticket booth located next to the information desk
allows students to use their student IDs to purchase
discounted tickets for movies and theatrical
productions. Occupying the second ﬂoor, the Career
Development Oﬂice helps students prepare for life
after graduation.

Strategically located at the heart of campus, the
William Pitt Union gives students the opportunity
to relax, have fun, and have a place they can call
their own.

look more like well-kept gardens to the general
public, they hold much more potential to passing

see the lawns as the perfect sunny place to work

As high school graduates, incoming freshmen cannot

Luckily for its newest students, the University

and staff members on the Arrival Survival and New
Student Orientation teams feverishly prepare for
the arrival of thousands of students to the Oakland

Arrival Survival volunteers eagerly greet students

Many movies cast a negative light on Greek
organizations, portraying them as communities
full of raucous parties and outrageous behavior.
But Greek life at Pitt has shattered the stereotypes
and has proved to be a great way to become involved
in the community and the campus.

With three governing councils and 38 individual
chapters, the Greek system makes academics its
foremost priority and philanthropy the cornerstone
ofits existence. Becoming Greek at Pitt is an
opportunity to broaden one’s social networks,
develop one's leadership skills, and take part in
charitable causes. Organizing blood drives,
participating in city cleanups, and coordinating
mentoring programs are just some of the ways in
which Pitt Greeks have contributed to the campus
and Pittsburgh communities.

At Pitt, going Greek is a great way to become
surrounded by a caring community focused on

education and giving back.

the Pitt Outdoors Club later became an ofﬁcial

of activities. From backpacking and hiking

to skydiving and Snowshoeing, the club’s

from several hours on a Sunday afternoon

to an entire weekend getaway to places like

around only once every four years: the chance to
vote in a presidential election. Pitt students played a
role in shaping the course of the country by casting
their votes on Election Day.

Every vote mattered in the race between Democrat
Barack Obama and Republican John McCain.
Students around campus promoted their favorite
candidate with the use of stickers, pins, shirts, and
signs. Candidates visited the area and students
showed their enthusiasm by waiting in line for
more than two hours to get in the door.

Apartmen

As much fun as it may be to live in a dorm freshman
year, many students are eager to move off campus
after sharing communal bathrooms and studying,
eating, and sleeping all in one room.

A newfound appreciation for personal space
develops with a move off campus. Having a kitchen
and a private bathroom are some of the perks that
students look forward to when considering
off—campus living. Limitations on the number of

 

people who can visit or the amount of clothing you
can bring back to school are now a thing of the past.

Living in an apartment helps to mold students into
responsible individuals. Unlike dorm life, where
many concerns are taken care of, off—campus living

    

requires students to be proactive. Bills need to be
paid monthly, problems with the apartment need  I

While most students wake up wondering whether
they have any free time to cram for an exam,
commuters wake up asking questions like “What
time is the bus supposed to come?” or “Where will
I ﬁnd parking on campus?” Every day, students
commute to campus with the help of the many
transportation options available in Pittsburgh.

With a ﬂash of a student ID, students can board
Port Authority buses for free. Some students choose
to forego waiting for the bus by driving to campus
instead. Driving a car provides a faster means of
transportation, but ﬁnding a parking spot requires

a lot of patience and a whole lot of change.

Other students prefer the more environmentally

friendly commute offered by hopping on their bikes.

Unlike students who live on campus, commuters don’t
have the luxury of retreating back to their rooms

for a snack or quick nap after class. The University
took care of this problem with the new Commuter
Student Lounge, which is equipped with a study area,

THEN

Congratulations, Class of2009! You did it!
The time ﬁnally has come to graduate and begin
a new chapter of your lives.

Although the University of Pittsburgh seemed
large and perhaps intimidating when you first
arrived on campus, you soon learned the quickest
routes to class and the best places to cram before
exams. The once unfamiliar bus schedules and
library hours became ingrained in your head.
Acquaintances turned to friendships, and
friendships became lifelong relationships.

During these past four years, the University has
come to mean much more than a place to earn
your college diploma. It has become a place where
you developed a sense of spirit and pride in your
accomplishments. It has become a place where
you learned from your mistakes and matured
with each passing year. Most importantly, it has
become a place where you discovered yourself
through the experiences you shared with your
professors and friends——experiences that will
prepare you as one door closes and another opens.

As you page through this book, the photographs
and narratives will help you to remember the
times you spent with your fellow classmates.
Whether it was from a particular class that
interested you or a sporting event that got you
on your feet, the University of Pittsburgh has left
a mark that will stay with you forever.

Congratulations, Class of 2009, and best of luck
in your future endeavors!

a soccer ﬁeld, Schenley Park is where many
students may be found on a sunny day in Oakland.

Since its opening in 2006, Schenley Plaza and its
slice of greenery have gained immense popularity
among students. The free wireless Internet and
many tables that dot the plaza provide a nice
alternative to Hillman Library as a place to get
some schoolwork done, while the benches that
weave through the beautiful gardens are quiet
places to relax or read.

Students take advantage ofthe track and tennis

The spring and summer months bring live musical
acts and ﬂea markets to Schenley Park and Plaza.

In the plaza, the four dining kiosks open for business
and bring a different taste of Pittsburgh to Oakland.
Beginning injune, students grab a blanket and
head to Flagstaff Hill to watch the biweekly

Students graduating from the University of
Pittsburgh can share their GPAS, transcripts, and
lists of extracurricular activities with potential
employers to prove that they are smart, hardwork-
ing, and well rounded. But how can students
demonstrate that they have the real—world skills
for which employers are searching?

The answer is internships. The options are
almost unlimited; positions with radio stations,
local companies, and even political campaigns are

just a few of the options available to Pitt undergrad-

uates. There also are many opportunities available
to students at the University, including teaching
internships with faculty members and study
abroad internships.

To assist students in ﬁnding an internship, the
University offers a wide range of resources,
including the Career Development Oﬂice and the
School of Arts and Sciences’ Ofﬁce of Experiential

Pitt senior Stacie Safritt and Pitt alumnijason Miller

Trials. All three set new personal records, and
Safritt was just eight-hundredths of a second shy

of the qualifying standard for the meet.

While these Panther swimmers have shown how
far hard work and dedication can lead, other team
members have displayed their excellence both in
and out of the pool. All-America diver Jeremy Stultz
was one of 21 Big East athletes to be awarded
the 2007-08 Big East Scholar—Athlete Sport
Excellence Award for his accomplishments in the

team has fused its talent and internal drive with the
opportunities provided by the new facility to look
more promising than ever.

Directed by highly qualiﬁed Head Coach Debbie
Yohman, the women of Pitt’s gymnastics team
are no strangers to the NCAA Northeast Regional
Championships. The 2007 season marked the
third year in a row that the Panthers were invited

as a team to the competition. Gymnasts Molly Moyer
and Shannon Vaﬁadou also participated individually
in the NCAA Northeast Regional meet in the spring
of 2008, leaving with impressive, hard-earned scores.

As Pitt gymnasts entered the 2009 season, they
were expecting a competitive and challenging year,
with an end result of nothing less than success.
With the team’s drive for victory and Yohman’s

21 years of exceptional leadership, Pitt gymnastics
fans expected another exciting year of artistry
