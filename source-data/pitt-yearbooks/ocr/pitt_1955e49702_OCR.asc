g SCHOOL   DENTISTRY

      

 

Dr. William F.
Acting De

In 1896 the Pittsburgh Dental College of the
University ofPittsburgh, with a limited amount
of material and equipment, made its ﬁrst at-
tempt to instruct and guide a handful of willing
students into the profession of dental surgery.
At that time few people saw far enough ahead
to visualize the school as it now stands—one of
the best equipped, most modern dental schools
in the country, eachyear turning out the ﬁnest
and ablest doctors in the ﬁeld of dentistry.

Every year the Dental School accepts ninety-
six capable students and instructs them in the
diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of oral
diseases. The first two years at the school are
chieﬂy a period of training and book learning,
whereas the last two are spent in the clinic, ac-
tually practicing dentistry.

A highlight each year at the Dental School
is the Student Award Day. On this day, out-
standing and well—dese,rying students are
awarded and commended on their ﬁne scholar-
ship and leadership for the past year. The en~
tire program stands as an incentive for all
students to work their best at the most diﬂicult
tasks.

In March the student branch of the American
Dental Association holds a meeting. On that
day the students attend a clinic instead of go-
ing to classes.

A featured event on the calendar ofthe future
dentists is the Winter Formal held at the Wil-
liam Penn Hotel.

CHANCELLOR’S MESSAGE

Your contribution to humanity, whatever it may be, will be

1

determined in a large measure by what you are. Into ‘what
you are” goes something of all your University experience: an
inspiring teacher, a cup of coffee in the Tuck Shop, a crackling
ﬁre in the Commons Room, classrooms that teach, enduring
friendships, beauty in Gothic arches, cherry blossoms on the
lawn, a University prom, a Stephen Foster melody, a character
which you have lived in a play, an anthem you sang in the
Choir, competition in sports, Christmas carols with the scent
of pine trees. Throughout your life these memories will always
be a part of you, shaping your character, and getting somehow
into the lives of your children and of all those with whom you
associate.

My hope for each of you is that through your University

experience you may discover your latent power and be thor-

oughly prepared to use it for a better world.

SCHOOL OF NURSI

Dr. Ruth Perkins
Dean

      

The University of Pittsburgh offers a ﬁve year
course in the School of Nursing. The first two
years consist chieﬂy of classes and pre—requisite
courses. During the remaining three, the future
nurse is trained in a hospital actually caring
for patients. While going through training,
nursing students are housed in modern eﬂ-i-
ciently maintained quarters, receiving the finest
food, care and guidance. At the end of training,
the graduate nurse can either enter a profes-
sional career or specialize further in a chosen
ﬁeld.

After completing the ﬁrst six months of
training, the student receives her nurse’s cap at
the “capping ceremony.” Then she continues
her diﬂicult studies for the next two and one-
half years. Their endeavors, however, lead to
a very satisfying end——a promise of a rich
full life helping and caring for the sick.

At last, the day every student nurse has
worked for arrives,—the day of the “pinning
ceremonies” when students are graduated.

A comprehensive statement of the meaning of the Nationality
Rooms has been expressed by Dr. John G. Bowman, President
I-Ionorarius of the University of Pittsburgh:

“Warmth of heart, recognition of nobility in character
and of beauty in homely, useful objects, respect for order and
ﬁne craftsmanship, reverence for the true and lovely, intense
feeling, and an extraordinary zest for doing are recaptured
in their original energy throughout the materials and design
of these rooms. Each room, itself an articulate expression of
nobility by a people, speaks to faculty and to students:
‘There isjoy in books, in art, in ideas, in friends, and in com-
mon things. Education is learning to live in a world illumi-
nated with kindness, wonder, and gladness. The joy in these
is yours to understand, to perfect within yourself, to live by,
and to pass on.’ ”

These pages show nineteen classrooms, each one devoted to a
particular people’s ideals. When the Cathedral of Learning was
erected, the people who made possible the city of Pittsburgh
and the University created the Nationality Rooms, arranging
them in beauty around the Commons Room. Dedicated to the
ideal of preserving national heritages, the rooms are a lasting
monument to Pittsburghers of all origins. At the University
of Pittsburgh we may see at close hand the work of those who

developed the principles by which we live.

IIO

Only ﬁve years ago the School of Pharmacy be-
came an integrated part of the University. Un«
til 1948, when the merger with Pitt Was com-
pleted, the school functioned independently.

The School of Pharmacy still has many ac-
tivities going on within itself. The Interfra—
ternity council holds meetings to promote so-
cial, religious and intellectual activities for the
students. This council is made up of representa-
tives from the various pharmaceutical fra-
ternities. The Pharmacy Alumni Association is
also active, sponsoring meetings, lectures and
social functions.

In addition to classes, the future pharmacist
hears many guest speakers during the year,
each an expert in a specialized ﬁeld. Annually
the senior class is given opportunities to Visit
laboratories of large drug manufacturers. These
trips give the student the advantage of keeping
up with modern procedures.

VVith its extensive training program, Pitt’s
School of Pharmacy is now accredited as a
Class A school by the American Council of
Pharmaceutical Education.

rSCHOOL OF RETAILING

   
 

Albert B. Smith
Acting Dean

    

The School of Retail Training oﬂiers to graduate
students a year’s study, concentrating on re-
tailing problems in various types of stores.

For thirty-seven years the school has pre-
pared students for such retailing careers as ad-
vertising management, buying, controlling and
personnel work. From its founding in 1918,
the Retail Training Bureau has been a co-
operative Venture between large Pittsburgh
retail stores and the University to develop
future store executives. By becoming an exten-
sion of the classroom, the retail stores cooperate
with the School of Retailing. Store executives
give students the beneﬁt of their experiences by
becoming part of the teaching staﬁ and sharing
with them the solutions of problems facing the
retailer.

Students work under a program combining
classroom instruction with actual working con-
ditions; classroom theories are tested in work-
ing situations in which the students are paid
for their work in the stores.

A Master of Retailing Degree is conferred
upon all those who, by their individual perform-
ance and grades earned, have met the require-
ments of the school.

These are the men that have more ups and downs than anyone else at Pitt.

The following pages of the Owl are devoted to
the most active group at Pitt—the undergrad-
uates. Somewhat outnumbered by the graduate
and professional students, the undergraduates
make their presence felt at the University, for
they are the core ofschool activities.

‘ Apart from pursuing their scholastic endeav-
ors, the undergraduates put out the student
publications. School government is under their
direction. They enjoy social affairs, especially
school dances. Students work on Educational
Television WQED. Spring Carnival, sponsored

‘by Student Congress, is planned by the under-

graduates. The festival has become an out-
standing event of the school year and is en-
joyed, not only by the students, but by many
Pittsburghers who attend. ‘

A Pitt’s undergraduates go all out for sports.
Besides the many pep rallies held during the
year, the students make up a large part of the
spectators at the games, and from their section
come the loudest cheers and, sometimes, the
saddest groans.

THE CATHEDRAL OF LEARNING

A spearhead of truth and knowledge, the jutting Cathedral springs
heavenward with the enthusiastic impetus of a people’s search for a
more fulﬁlling life. These striving people representing many creeds
and cultures, united with one another in the desire to improve them-
selves and to further the advantages of their children with the learn-
ing so vitally necessary to a city as rich in resource and as typical of
world progress as Pittsburgh.

Their dream over the last one hundred and siXty—eight years has
grown in step with the great metropolis that it serves to advance. This
towering forty—two story skyscraper in Gothic design—the tallest
college building in the world—epitomizes in its inﬂuence and prestige
the world at Pitt. Technical research laboratories, clinics, hospitals,
and the myriad schools and institutions are also an integral part of
the University campus in the cultural and recreational center of Pitts-
burgh, the health and industrial capital of the world.

Symbolizing our Alma Mater in the purpose of its existence and
sweep of scope, the Cathedral, consecrated to the highest aspirations
of reasoning man, remains a constant bulwark of international co-
operation and understanding, an instrument of increasing beneﬁt to

the misfortunes of mankind, and a universal refuge for the freedom of

 

thought and expression from which man reaches the fountainhead of

I 7 8 1 eternal wisdom.

ALUMNI ASSOCIATION

An Alumni Association dinner held at Hotel Webster Hall

To the Graduating Class of 1955:

We of the General Alumni Association of the University of
Pittsburgh are happy to extend our congratulations to YOU
and to all the members of the Graduating Class of 1955.

You, the individual, are the most important person in the
class. You are of God, have been blessed with many talents,
and have acquired knowledge. You have spent one third of
your proverbial three score years and ten in gaining the
degree with which you will earn your living and help to make
your world a better place in which to live.

Your mother and father were the ﬁrst to encourage you to
seek knowledge. They are proud of you and of your degree.
Remember them always and thank them for their sacriﬁces.
Your Alma Mater, the University of Pittsburgh, provided
the wherewithal to foster you in your quest for an education.

You are now an alumnus and we welcome you into our
Alumni Association. We hope you will become an active
member; then you will have the opportunity of keeping in
touch with your fellow graduates and will help form the
policy which will develop your school further and through
which a greater University will evolve. Your love for your
Alma Mater, by helping her to extend to the youth ofAmerica
the opportunity of acquiring knowledge, will enhance the
degree which you worked so hard to earn.

You are entering the middle third of your span of life, about
to go out into your world—to meet success we hope. We can
oﬂfer you the opportunity of associating with the alumni of
Pitt, from which we are sure you will gain many beneﬁts.
From time to time visit our friendly secretary, Clyde Barton,
in the Alumni House located at 4302 Begelow Boulevard.

Sincerely yours,

Qmﬂﬁaa

Five minutes ’til lunch.

The American Institute of Chemical Engineers, com-
posed of chemical engineering students, attempts to
orientate the students to future professional practice
and the high standards expected of them.

Every Thursday, fourth hour, the chemical engineers
seminar met in the Cathedral of Learning for detailed
talks on the ﬁne points of chemical advancements. Dur-
ing these meetings, discussions were held on the different
aspects and developments of chemical engineering tech-
niques consisting of topics such as, “Future Opportuni-
ties in the Field of Chemical Engineering” and the “Type
of Security the Profession Offers.”

The A.I.Ch.E. held a picnic in the spring and also
worked on a special display for “Engineers’ Week.”

Each year the Institute gives special recognition to
the outstanding sophomore in chemical engineering by
presenting him with a merit pin and a subscription to
“Chemical Engineering Progress.”

Aiding the development of the latent abilities of stu-
dents is the principal purpose of the student branch of
the American Institute of Electrical Engineers. Any
person registered as a student in electrical engineering
is eligible for membership in this organization.

Each Thursday, fourth hour, the A.I.E.E. Seminar
is held for which the students receive one—half credit
toward graduation. At these meetings, movies on some
particular subject in electrical engineering, or speakers
who are closely related to electrical engineering in in-
dustry, put forth the latest developments in electrical
engineering. This enabled the students to keep abreast
of the latest developments in the profession.

The organization boasts a membership of almost two
hundred, with nearly every prominent electrical engi-
neer included.

The student branch of the American Institute of Indus-
trial Engineers is comprised of students from the in-
dustrial engineering department.

This year the A.I.I.E.’s took an active part in “Engi-
neers’ Week,” which was held in April, by acquiring
displays from various industries. Two banquets, smok-
ers and a spring picnic made up the social calendar for
the year. The engineers also found time to support char-
itable drives at the University.

The members participated in intramural basketball
and other sports sponsored by Pitt.

The purpose of this organization is to acquaint the
industrial engineering students with others in their field
and to give the student a diversiﬁed look at what is
happening in the ﬁeld of industrial engineering and other
pertinent ﬁelds by having speakers, movies and ﬁeld
trips.

A.I.I.E. helps to give its members a more realistic
View of what the boys will encounter when they gradu-
ate from Pitt.

The primary mission of the Air Force ROTC is to

U.S. Air Force through a program of air instruction. Of
equal importance is a second emphasis, the offering of
special knowledge in air age citizenship to a large seg-
ment of the University population.

At Pitt strong support is given by the faculty and
cadet organizations such as the Arnold Air Society, the
Air Force ROTC Rifle and Drill Teams, Pershing
Riﬂes . . . in connection with the Army ROTC . . . to
worthy activities including the American Red Cross

through annual blood donation drives for local veterans
hospitals. Civil Air Patrol, Explorer Scouts, orphans’
parties, and Armed Forces Day celebrations as Well as

During the past year, Pitt’s Air Force ROTC was
rated among the highest in overall accomplishment dur-
ing the annual federal inspection of colleges and uni-
versities in Pennsylvania, Virginia, and North Carolina,
and was cited as the outstanding air cadet corps from
an educational standpoint.

Sponsoring the improvement of professional aims and
objectives, Alpha Omega, national dental fraternity,
honors outstanding students in dentistry and partici-
pates in a local program of comprehensive dental clinics.

It holds its meetings in the YM and YWHA, Belle-
ﬁeld Avenue, and gives a rushing stag party in Septem-
ber, an alumni-undergraduate barn dance, a pledge din-
ner dance, a senior banquet to honor graduating men,
and a lively spring picnic.

Alpha Omega was founded nationally in 1907 at the
Pennsylvania College of Dental Surgery in Philadelphia.
The Pitt chapter was established in 1921. It has helped
greatly to stimulate the development of high standards
in scholarship, leadership and character in the profes-
sion of dentistry and has forged a bond of lasting fel-
lowship among its members that does not end with the
termination of college life.

The fraternity has won the Interfraternity Dental
Scholarship Award for the last ﬁve years. It has also
contributed to the establishment of a dental school in
the state of Israel.

Alpha Tau Delta, a social nursing sorority, is dedicated
to the purpose of fostering friendship and fellowship
among college women in the nursing ﬁeld.

Once a year the sorority holds a reception for students
entering the School of Nursing in order to welcome
and become acquainted with new students. After each
meeting, the members have entertainment, both amus-
ing and educational. In addition to the meetings and
the reception tea, the sorority held two forrnals, had a
formal initiation dinner to honor the pledges and held a
card party to raise funds for the sorority’s use.

This year the girls in the student program of the
Visiting Nurses Association picked out a number of
needy families with children to whom the girls in Alpha
Tau Delta distributed baskets with clothing and toys.

Any student who is a candidate for both a nursing
certiﬁcate and a college degree is eligible for member-
ship in Alpha Tau Delta.

A tea was held for the potential pledges.

Our American heritage is closely allied with England. The spirit
of this land is found in the large English Room. It recreates the
Shakespearian Age with an atmosphere of poetic and parlia-

mentary distinction.

The room is designed to be harmonious with the House of
Commons. Gifts from Commons to Pitt of original materials
from the old House form the heart of the room. Their crafts-
manship and obvious historical value make this room one of

the most authentic of English culture on any campus in America.

Two portraits are pictured. One is of William Pitt, “the
Great Commoner” and First Earl of Chatham. “Friend of the
colonists. His name the City and the University share.” The
other portrait is of Andrew W. Mellon, Class of 1873; Secretary
of the Treasury, 1921-1932; U. S. Ambassador to the Court of

St. James, 19324933; and benefactor of the University.

One outstanding feature is the window bay. Set in moulded
limestone, ancient tinted windowglass encased in lead is em-
blazonedwith six crests of Oxford, Cambridge, and the Houses
of Lords and Commons, adding a digniﬁed richness to the

honey—colored Woodwork.

In 1882, seven men from the University incorporated
the first Greek letter dental society, Delta Sigma Delta.
Today the fraternity is the only international Dental
fraternity in existence. The membership is restricted to
students and practitioners of the profession of dentistry.

Since the social events for the fall semester were
primarily for rushing prospective members, the fra-
ternity usually had two rushing affairs a month. The
ﬁnal rush affair was held in the Spring semester. The
fraternity also had two formals during the year. This
year the members of the fraternity were hosts to six
neighboring dental schools which met here for the Mid-
Eastern Conclave.

Delta Sigma Delta has great regard for their objective
to keep the standards of Dentistry high by instilling in
the minds of dental students and practitioners a spirit
of fraternal cooperation towards scientiﬁc, ethical and
professional progress.

WORK CLUB

The Pre-Social VVork Club endeavors to serve two
groups of undergraduate students. Not only is the club
designed to further the knowledge of those interested
in social work as a career; but it also gives a broad out-
look of the profession to those students who are unde-
cided as to whether they Want social Work as their
future vocation, or not.

The meetings, planned by Dr. M. B. Conover, con-
sisted mostly of speakers from the faculty and from the
student body of the School of Social V\7ork. VVhenever
possible, a speaker from outside of the University spoke
to the students about the practical experiences of this
profession. Also, the members visited various agencies
surrounding the University. Here the students saw,
first-hand, the actual Work of the social worker.

This spring, the School of Social VVork invited about
20 surrounding schools to participate in a conference
here. The undergraduate students in the Pre—Social
VVork Club helped to make this conference a success.

Dr. M. B. Conover discusses the possibilities
of social work as a career.

The Psi Omega house, 230 N. Belleﬁeld Avenue was a home away
from home for many of the boys.

\Vhether they were playing billiards or singing around the piano,
when a couple fellows got together they could always have a good time.

Psi Omega, :1 professional dental fraternity, offers mem-
bership to all students in certiﬁed dental schools. The
fraternity endeavors to cultivate the social qualities of
its members, exert its inﬂuences for the advancement of
the dental profession and secure, by cooperation, bene~
ﬁts and advantages out of the individual reach.

In the true Christmas spirit, members of Psi Omega
gave a party for thirty orphans at their chapter house.

Playing cards is as good a way to pass the time as any.

    

The orphans were from the immediate vicinity, and
ranged from six to eight years of age.

The social affairs consisted of a get—together at the
fraternity house after every home football game, two
parties a month and a picnic in the spring. The frater-
nity also held two formals, one in the winter and the
other in the spring. Psi Omega supported intramural
sports by participating in football, softball and basket-
ball.

The Christmas tree showed the yuletide spirit of the fraternity.

Planning the next hospital tour is an interesting project.

Alpha Epsilon Delta is an honorary pre—medical fra-
ternity which encourages excellence in scholarship in
that ﬁeld. Through an adequate program of pre—med
education, it binds together interested students and
promotes cooperation between them and medical stu-
dents.

The fraternity is national and requires that students
have three semesters completed with a 2.0 average.
Fraternity meetings, held monthly, were followed by
social hours.

This past spring the fraternity held a dance called
the “CadaVer’s Crawl,” which despite its name was a
lively affair. Their most successful project was a booklet
published for all pre—meds. It is called The Pre—mea'im/
Student and explains how to go about preparing for
medical school, listing the courses that the student
should take. The fraternity also sponsored tours through
medical school and hospitals in the area. And in that
way perpetuates itself by interesting high school stu-
dents in the medical profession. Thus Alpha Epsilon
Delta aids the nation.

year the potato chips and popcorn that were not sold at
the carnival concessions were sent to the Children’s Hos-
pital. Among its other activities were a Christmas dance
for members and a Christmas party for the children in
the local hospitals.

 

Checking cards for the Student Directory was one of the biggest jobs of the year.

is national in scope. In order to qualify for this Society,
one must be an advanced cadet with a 1.5 scholastic
average and a 2.0 AFROTC average. If the cadet quali-
ﬁes, he is interviewed and then embarks upon a con-
structive pledge period. The advisor of the Society was

born.

The purpose of Arnold Air Society is to raise the mili-
tary standards of the cadets by increasing their military
preparedness, by furthering their knowledge of the
scope and mission of the Air Force and by increasing
their esprit—de-corps. Moreover, worthwhile projects
are another attribute of the Society. They sponsored

age and recognize scholarship in the ﬁeld of commercial
education and also to recognize the outstanding achieve-
ments of teachers already in service.

The fraternity held monthly meetings. At these
meetings plans were made for the social events and proj-
ects for the year. One of their most successful-projects
was a High School Day for business students in the
vicinity of Pittsburgh which was held at the Cathedral
with the fraternity as host.

An initiation luncheon held each semester to honor
new members was an enjoyable social. An annual bowl-

The fraternity has done a great deal in both the pro-
fessional and the social ﬁelds of Commercial education.

pation in campus activities.

For this year’s program its members held an initia-

spring. Its first semester project was the sponsorship of
the popular Pitt Blazer, while the second semester
service was the establishment of the University Activi-
ties Board.

With a keen awareness of the classical past, the French Room

portrays the Empire Period of the early nineteenth century.

As enthusiasm grew from the prizes that Napoleon brought
home from his campaigns in Italy, Greece and Egypt, the
newly found classic designs began to appear in French furni-
ture and architecture. In perfect French taste these ancient
motifs embellish the painted Walls and the rich mahogany

furniture of the French Room with a gilded opulence.

Slender wall pilasters are crowned with ornate carvings
rubbed with gold leaf. Griﬂ-ins, small rosettes and acanthus
leaves accentuate the translucent grey monotone witha golden

brilliance.

Specially designed as a French interior of the period, the
paneling exactly frames the blackboards of satiny black glass.
A wall cabinet in the room, containing medallions, statuettes

and other objets d’art, matches the entrance in size and shape.

Student armchairs with gracefully curving backs and up-

holstered blue leather are each a work of inspired art.

The focal interest is the Gobelin tapestry, its style originat-
ing in the ﬁfteenth century. Its golden beauty characterizes an

art form recognized throughout the world as unparalleled.

A parquet ﬂoor of highly polished oak is patterned after
ﬂoors at Versailles. The crystal chandeliers and damask dra-

Another year and another ‘man’ added to ODK walk.
That statement, though true, cannot possibly sum up
the year’s accomplishments for this ﬁne organization.
For through its three main aims; to recognize the out—
standing men, to bring them together, and to bring
the faculty in closer Contact with the students through
mutual interest, the fraternity has accomplished much
more. But who can tabulate and itemize the help and
inﬂuence of the older members, who are among the
most successful in their ﬁelds, on the minds, ambitions
and energies of these young men? No one could, but
when one brings together young men who have been
chosen for their accomplishments in college life with
men who have been tempered and sharpened by ex-
perience, the result will surely be good if not great.

The honorary held semi—monthly luncheon meetings
in order to discuss the business of the fraternity. On
December 7th, ODK held an initiation banquet. The
banquet was held in honor of Chancellor Rufus H.
Fitzgerald who was the ﬁnal speaker of the evening.

first two semesters are eligible for membership. This
year smokers for the new members were held in the
Panther Room, and the initiation banquets, in Decem-
ber and April, were held at the Faculty Club.

A free tutoring service for underclassmen was co-

scholastic fraternity, Pi Tau Phi receives to member-
ship College juniors and seniors who have attained a
QPA of 2.5 or better. As deﬁned in its constitution, this
organization’s purpose is the “conserving and spreading
of scholarship, culture, and idealism . . . always striving
to stimulate sound thought and to establish high intel-
lectual standards.” Another aim of the honorary is to
encourage its members to maintain these high standards
throughout life.

Although primarily concerned with scholarship, Pi
Tau Phi carried out a social program during the year
which included bi-monthly meetings at which out-
standing speakers were invited. The social calendar was
climaxed by traditional fall and spring initiation ban-
quets at which time new members were welcomed and
worthy members of the University’s faculty or of the
community Were tapped as honorary Pi Tau Phi’s.

Sigma Tau is the foremost national honorary engi-

dents in engineering. The fraternity binds these students
together into a cooperative group interested in the same
profession and working toward the same goal.

Qualiﬁcations for membership . require a junior or
senior standing and a 2.0 quality point average. But
the fraternity does not only stress scholarship; good
fellowship and a certain judgement must be shown by
all prospective members.

The fraternity holds, along with the regular business
meetings at State Hall, a pledge smoker and an initia-
tion banquet each semester. The pledge smoker marked
the beginning of the initiation period for new members,
and the banquet closed the period.

This year the fraternity has started plans for the
building of a pyramid which is to be placed in front of
the new engineering building. The pyramid is the sym-
bol of Sigma Tau.

program and holds informal gatherings with the mem-
bers of other religious organizations.

The VVesley Fellowship was founded in the spring of
1951 to provide Christian fellowship for students of the
Methodist faith at Pitt, Tech and P.C.VV. through a
well—rounded social and worship program.

The Fellowship provides many social activities for
its members. The group sponsors regular events includ-
ing bowling parties, corn roasts and swimming parties.
Each semester a retreat is held for the members at
Epworth VVoods.

As one of the primary functions of the group, the

Fellowship sends delegations of its members to various
church congregations throughout the Pittsburgh dis-
trict to explain their interpretation of the role young
people should assume in church life.

As part of their charitable activities, the members
gather old toys, fix and paint them and then distribute
them to various charitable organizations.

Through such activities, the VVesley Foundation has
become a growing part of University life and a contribu-
ting factor in the Pittsburgh district.

Nordic strength heightens the friendliness and warmth that are
a part of this room. It represents the folk style of the eighteenth
century, one of Norway’s greatest eras of artistic craftsman-
ship.

Unusual effects are achieved by using two ceiling levels
which are reminiscent of native cottages. The large room is
paneled in natural pine, waxed and aged to the color of bur-
nished amber. The high ceiling slants upward to an insignia of
the midnight sun. The room’s front shows a strong Renaissance
inﬂuence on the blue panels decorated with intertwining ﬂoral
patterns.

A sloping stone ﬁreplace juts into the main room. Across
from it a tall Norwegian clock ticks silently. Nearby the win-
dow bay of leaded opalescent glass illuminates the room with
the haze of northern light.

Worked with carvings and painted in light reds and blues,
the professor’s heavy oak table and stand reflect the tones of
the room. The great master chair is carved in the technique of
the historic Vikings, splendidly hewn with dragon—headed
arms and legs and a wide sweeping back crowned with ﬁerce
eagles’ heads. The deep—seated student chairs repeat its force-
ful curving lines.

Balancing the blackboard a tapestry enlivens the rear wall
with a Biblical scene.

Truly Scandinavian; the Norwegian Room contains the
quiet sincerity and vital control that bolster ambition and give

constructive strength to character.

Establishing unity of spirit and action among the frater-

Council.

Along with Panhellenic Council, IF Council sponsored
their annual Greek Week, during which discussion groups,
dances, dinners and teas were held jointly between fra-
ternities and sororities. Another goal of Greek Week was
to give the independent students a chance to become ac-
quainted with the Workings and people connected with
the Greek organizations.

Other projects of Interfraternity Council were: sponsor-
ing a scholarship for a male student to study and travel
abroad; conducting an intense program of interfraternity
activities in such ﬁelds as athletics, debating and singing;
issuing a handbook concerning fraternities, and collecting
canned foods for underprivileged persons.

By noting the work accomplished this year, one can see
that the trip was a great success.

New this year was the administration of 3. Men’s
Conference program. This one-semester non-credit
course for Freshmen men was taught by members of the
faculty and upperclassmen. It was designed to help the
men overcome typical ﬁrst-year stumbling blocks.

Sponsoring mixer dances with WSGA and showing
movies of Pitt Football games for those who were un-
able to attend were a few of the other projects that kept
MC busy. The council also took over sales of the Pitt
blazer and bought a new record player which it rented
to other groups. It also leased a public address system
and a movie projector.

A special Men’s Council committee investigated the
potentialities of a political party system for men’s elec-
tions at Pitt which would be supervised by MC in con-
junction with Alpha Phi Omega.

In addition to everything else, Men’s Council worked

“Well girls, I was on a diet, but . . .”

Girls arrive at Stephen Foster social hall for
refreshments after the Panhellenic reception.

This year the members of Panhellenic Council continued
to foster good relations among sorority women at Pitt,
and they also saw that all sororities took an active part
in the extra—curricular program of the University.

The Council, which consists of three representatives
from each sorority, immediately began work in the Fall
to prepare for the Panhellenic reception for freshmen
women which was held in Stephen Foster Memorial.

In November, Panhellenic council joined with Inter-
fraternity Council to take part in Greek Week activi-
ties. There was a canned goods drive, the Greek Sing,
exchange dinners at the fraternity houses and a Greek
Dance at which a scholarship cup was presented to the
Sorority with the highest quality Point aVerage- Voices sing out in the Commons Room during Greek Week.

At the close of rushing season, when all groups had
received their new pledges, a tea was held for all mem-
bers of Junior Panhellenic council and their pledge
mothers. In March the traditional Panhellenic Ball was
held in the Georgian Room of the Hotel Webster Hall
in honor of all new pledges and senior members of Pan-
hellenic council.

This year Panhellenic council again contributed to
the support of the Dutch war orphan whom they
adopted through the Foster Parents Plan for War
Orphans. Each year the sororities through Panhellenic
send 180 dollars to the Foster Parents Plan for the care
of their orphan. During the year they write her letters,
and they send gifts at Christmas and on her birthday.

Two major aims of Student Congress this year were
stimulating school spirit and strengthening political
parties at Pitt.

Student Congress got the year started with several
large football rallies for home games at Soldiers’ and
Sailors’ Memorial Hall, peppy team send—offs and vic-
tory celebrations after Pitt beat Navy and VVest Vir-
ginia.

An intensive Pitt Chest drive brought in funds. As a
gentle hint, candy money was placed in every contribu-
tion envelope. True to form, Pittites ate up the choco-
late coins but dug down deep to replace them with real
currency.

A special committee attempted to strengthen the
class dances. Class oﬂicers planned the Christmas Ball,
directed by seniors, and other Commons Room dances
headed by lower classmen.

The letters B. E. P. O. P. popped up on bulletin
boards all over campus. Little—known facts about the
University and faculty were posted each week to justify
the catchy slogan—~Be Proud of Pitt.

Congress printed a student government handbook to
revitalize public interest in Pitt student government.
Representatives made speeches before campus and high
school groups.

This spring Student Government Day gave a mean-
ingful emphasis to the student elections, impressing
candidates and class officers alike With their duties of
serving faithfully the wishes of the student body and

is an annual high—light of Pitt’s social year.

One humorous event this year was the Old Fashioned
School Days party for the seniors. Here everyone
brought a box lunch and reviewed her life at Pitt start-
ing with the freshman year.

Planning a spring fashion show which was open to all
women and promoting the Women’s Placement Bureau
were other activities that kept the seniors occupied.

The ﬁnish of the senior social activities, and in a way
the end of their school days, was the class dinner on
Tap Day. This was one event that every student looked
forward to.

The work of the class was divided among four committees:

ing organization until the end of the freshmen year
when the girls nominate their sophomore class oﬁicers
and to plan social affairs for freshmen women.

Lois Grosz guided Freshmen Council and oﬂiciated

The freshmen bade their mentors farewell through their spokesman,
Gloria Kohl.

The purpose of the \Voman’s Self Government Associa-
tion is to help every woman become self-governing
through intelligent choices, and to make possible for
every woman the kinds of group experiences which help
her to test her ideas and build friendships. All under-
graduate women students registered in the University
who are carrying a minimum of twelve credits, are
automatically members.

The women started off this year with meetings amid
the piles of sand and scaﬁolding on the floor; at last
one of “the big rooms” was being ﬁnished. The years’
inspiration lay in watching the progress from brick
walls to lovely panelling. The change in the appear-
ance of Room 1228 was reflected in a renovated WSGA
program.

As a practical approach to the problem of counseling,
the Vocational Information Committee planned with
representatives of many University departments to
spend a day on the floor talking individually about their
academic programs.

Also, the freshmen guild system was revamped. In
previous years, the freshmen women, upon entering the
guild phase of their orientation, formed small groups
patterned after various organized campus activities.
This year, the freshmen were actually integrated into
the campus organizations under the guidance of various
student advisors.

FINE ARTS

Old Russian spirit recaptures in this room the many artistic
forms of religious faith and homey philosophy close to Russian
temperament. Details of carving throughout the room are de-
signs handed down from a distant past. A solid feeling of sense
and order is apparent in the geometric diamond shapes around
the frame which holds the banner of St. George and the Dragon,
the ﬁtted patterns on the students’ chairs and the table apron.
These basic forms date back to extremely old sources un-
touched by the creative evolution in Western Europe during

the Middle Ages and the Renaissance.

Sunﬂower patterns enrich the corner cabinet—they denote
the force of life in the world and suggest the fanciful imagery
inherited from medieval Persian art. The jewel—encrusted icon
of Our Lady of Vladimir above the cabinet is an original mas-
terpiece of the seventeenth century, showing great regard for
religious fervor and dedicated workmanship learned from By-

zantine artisans.

The great oaken entrance door is arched in a half—octagon
and has hinges of wrought—iron. The deep door jambs are fur-
ther ornamented with ﬂoral and geometric patterns repeated
in the Wainscot and the oak furniture. The rising sun at the
top of the Russian—styled door is a symbol of the vastness of
the motherland and also implies the hope of a richer future for

every Russian.

Interested students attend a chapel service in the Heinz Chapel.

In September, the week before classes began, members
of the Heinz Chapel Choir spent a week at Camp
Lutherlyn. During this week they ate, danced, swam,
went hiking and played volleyball; but, most important,
they sang ﬁve hours every day, and they had fun
doing it.

Every ‘Wednesday at one o’clock, the Heinz Chapel
Choir put on their royal—purple vestments,-and when
they marched down the aisle, everyone knew that this
singing group was a ﬁnished product. “Pop” Finney,
their able director, was instrumental in bringing about
this appearance. The choir had to work hard to attain

219

their perfect harmony and certain melody, rehearsing
four days a week from 4:30 to 5:30 p. m. The choir loved
to sing; at 5:30, as the elevators carried the students to
the Ground Floor, they still sang,——their voices echoing
through the building.

The choir’s program included much more than just
singing at University functions. The choir gave concerts
at various churches in the area, and they toured for a
week in the Spring. This year they gave concerts in New
England and eastern Pennsylvania. The year ended
with the choir’s annual spring picnic at “Pop’s” farm
and, again, the members of the choir could say, "We
have made music.”

MEN’S DEBATE
ASSOCIATION

Pres. Joseph Trattner
V. Pres. Thomas Rutter
Sec. Stanley Greenﬁeld
Treas. Robert Sedler
Adv. Robert Newman

The members of Men’s Debate Association had a stren-
uous year with its sponsoring of television shows, tour-
naments, local debates and journeys to various inter-
collegiate competitions in eastern United States.

Dartmouth, Notre Dame and Cornell came to Pitts-
burgh to participate in cross—examination debates be-
fore local audiences. About 25,000 witnessed some part
of this series excluding the radio and television audi-
ence.

The association expanded into TV this year with two
series of weekly half-hour shows on VNQED entitled
CAMPUS. They consisted mainly of informal discus-
sions featuring campus leaders and guests from other
colleges.

High point of the year was the Seventh Annual Cross-
examination Tournament held in December. Teams
from twenty—four colleges participated in ﬁve rounds of
rated debate with the Crucible Steel Trophy awarded
to Ohio Wesleyan as the champion Visiting team. The
Pitt debaters tied with the Ohio school for top honors.
Climaxing the tournament was a public debate in
Stephen Foster Memorial where Oxford defeated Yale.

Pitt teams took third place at the Purdue Varsity
conference, second at the Wake Forest novice tourna-
ment and at the Temple novice competition Pitt’s team
remained undefeated to tie Dartmouth for first place.
The debaters travelled to more than ﬁfteen other col-
legiate tournaments in the eastern states.

MEN’S GLEE CLUB

The Men’s Glee Club was started in 1890 when twelve
students formed the “Mandolin and Banjo Club” under
the leadership of John Nigh. After 60 years of successful
growth, the club boosted its membership to 50 voices
while retaining its original fellowship and spirit. The
only change in the club was the addition of the Pitt
blazer which is now worn for informal appearances.

All of the men, while preparing for professional
careers, pursued singing only as an enjoyable pastime.
They rehearsed every Monday, VVednesday and Friday
during the seventh hour in preparation for a season of
school programs, two extensive tours, numerous con-
certs in nearby communities and their annual Spring
Concert in Carnegie Music Hall.

The men closed the season with a banquet at which
awards were presented and oﬂicers were elected for the
next year.

With fantasy, mystery, suspense, and the magic ofillusion,
the Pitt Players have presented a wonderful year of dra-
matic expression at Pitt.

From Elwood Dowd and his big invisible Harvey, from
the homey southern family in the Grazf Big Door Slap, the
students working in Stephen Foster Memorial have done
much to show the whimsy and humor of the American
theater.

With the second semester came a change of pace. Actors
donned their old ﬂowing Victorian robes and wove eery and
fascinating chills and shivers with their version of The
Innocm/5, adapted from the short story by Henry James.
The haunting theme of the last showing, D617‘/6 of the
Moon, was colorfully performed and made an interesting
conclusion to a well—planned year.

Along with technicians, business and production staffs
and the student and faculty administrators, the members
of Theatron, honorary dramatic fraternity, were honored
for outstanding work and cooperation at the fraternity’s
annual banquet at the end of Pitt's dramatic season.

THE YRIA-LEBANON ROOM

I2

Lee Banjamin receives “Bandsman of the Year” trophy.

Mr. Arthur shows the way to the stage before the band concert.

The Annual Stadium Review was held at Carnegie Music Hall.

For sheer color and sparkle, nothing matched the thrill
of watching the University of Pittsburgh’s Varsity
Marching Band tramping onto the ﬁeld—~at 180 steps
per minute—playing “Hail to Pitt!”

Later, there was a sudden upsurge of spirit in the Pitt
section of the stadium as the band began the strains of
the “Alma Mater,” then stepping quickly into Pitt's
traditional emblem, the Panther Head.

Everyone who had heard of the Varsity Marching
Band was aware of the exceptional precision that made
the band famous as an excellent musical organization.
Pitt is immensely proud of this national recognition.

Band members are not professional musicians but
men studying in every school of the University.

At all the home games and at several of the away
games, the band was there, pepping up the players and
spectators alike with the stirring music of Sousa’s im-
mortal marches as well as Pitt’s great battle songs and

228

the bouncy tempos of “The Johnson Rag” and “Mr.
Touchdown, U. S. A.”

Along with playing at all the games on chilly autumn
Saturdays, band members practiced weekdays after
classes for performances at local high schools. The band
ended the season with a Stadium Review at Carnegie
Music Hall. There songs and numbers played at the
games were highlighted. There was also a special med-
ley of opponent colleges’ music and a salute to Pitt. It
was a ﬁtting ﬁnale for the graduating bandsmen.

This year at the Review, C. Lee Banjamin was named
the outstanding bandsman of the year. He was elected
in a secret ballot by the entire band. He represented on
campus the deserving men who, planning someday to
become doctors, engineers, lawyers and businessmen,
make the Pitt Varsity Marching Band one of the most
outstanding marching bands in the United States.

Kniseley, these gals have really done a great job. Be-
sides singing three Madrigals for Beaux Arts, they sang
during Greek Week and Christmas Week and gave a
recital with Mr. Lotz, singing portions of “A Ceremony
of Carols.”

Women's Choral welcomed its new members with a
fall social and had informal get-togethers and special
holiday parties both at school and at the home of their
director.

Besides being musically inclined, the girls entered the
“Beat West Virginia” cheer and the “Beat Penn State”
poster contest. They also played in the basketball tour-
nament sponsored by the Women’s Recreation Associa-
tion.

PUBLICATIONS

John T. Caldwell, Jr.
Editor

With an All—American yearbook as their goal, the 195 5
Owl staff worked hard to produce a book that might de-
serve that honor.

The general planning of the work was done during the
summer by Editor Jack Caldwell and Associate Editor
Paul Gilliland. The staff as a whole got together for their
ﬁrst meeting at a picnic at South Park between registration
and the ﬁrst day of school. T—bone steaks were on the
menu, and although they got a little crisp, they made de-
licious eating.

The picnic didn’t last long, however, because the staff
faced their ﬁrst deadline only ﬁve days after school started.
The ﬁrst ﬁnished work consisted of the book’s first 48 pages

including the color section. Jack and Tom Vrana, the
photo editor, took these pictures of the Nationality Rooms
in full color just before school started. Don Miller did an
excellent job of writing the room descriptions. With suc-
cessful completion of the opening section, the staff surged
ahead with added incentive and worked long hours to meet
the succeeding deadline commitments with the printer.
Another boost to the morale of the staﬁ‘ was the.re-
decorating of the oﬂ-ice during the summer. The old desks
were replaced with new grey metal ones complete with
swivel chairs. The windows became some of the best-
dressed in the Cathedral with bamboo blinds and tailored
draperies. Interesting Toulouse—Lautrec paintings bright-

Deadline nights on the Owl meant a lot of work, laughs and fun.

  
  

ened the walls and the warm red tile ﬂoor added the ﬁnish-
ing touches to the “new” oﬂice.

The Owl for 1955 was centered around the theme, “The
World At Pitt." The staff worked out this theme by using
the unique inﬂuence of the Nationality Rooms, world
maps on division pages, pictures of Pitt’s U.N. and other
international events—plus the cathedral-globe motif which
is displayed throughout the book’s design.

The Calendar and Owlette sections were combined this
year. The owlette portraits of beautiful Pitt women were
turned this year into monthly Calendar girls whose pic-
tures served as sub-division pages for the Calendar section.

Besides the yearbook proper and the summer supple-
ment, the Owl contracted to have printed 3500 separate

Brought intact from Damascus, the Syria—Lebanon Room—
built originally in I782—was once the actual library of a
wealthy merchant. Smallest of the Nationality Rooms it shows
a mixture of European and Oriental art forms. Persian, Phoe-
nician and Italian Renaissance designs are effectively muted
by the ﬂowing Arabic patterns.

Unusual painted gesso decoration on the walls developed
from the Byzantine inﬂuence in the Near East. The relief ef-
fect is achieved by applying a special chalk—paste to wood.
When dry, the raised design is carved and skillfully painted
with rich oranges, pinks and greens on a background of bronze
and gold leaf accented with black.

The vaulted niche is called the Mi/zrozé. Of typical Moslem
construction, this family altar points toward Mecca where
Mohammed was born.

Embossed wall—cabinets hold books, ceramics and brass-
ware from Syria. The closed linden wood doors are shutters
which in Syria keep out the intense heat of the sun but let in
cool night air.

The marble ﬂoor beneath the coffee table meets the marble
of the built—in divans with their thick satin cushions. Lighting
the room, a great chandelier holds cups once ﬁlled with Leb-
anon oil.

In its color and exotic delicacy, the room is much like the
luxurious interiors of centuries ago when knowledge was for
the few and Europe was just awakening to the wonders of the

East.

THE PITT NEWS

The world at Pitt would be incomplete without a Voice for
student opinion and a means by which the news within the
University could be made known. These aims were accom-
plished twice each week when the Pill News hit the stands.

The pressure was on from the first issue as only three
senior staff members returned to school and faced a string
of twelve All-American ratings from the Associated Col-
legiate Press. But what the staff lacked in experience was
balanced by/an enthusiasm which kept the lights in the
news room burning until early morning to meet deadlines.

Fast and accurate reporting resulted in a number of
scoops for the News, stories which broke simultaneously or
ahead of the downtown papers. The first of these breaks
occurred when Joan Thomas, associate editor, got a lead on
the new Engineering and Mines building. This was fol-
lowed by a complete story on dormatories and a student
union along with a breakdown of other building projects
throughout the campus.

Sports Editor Dave Mazer came up with the story of
Red Dawson’s illness just hours before the presses were to
roll, and Bill Rimmel, editor of the Skyscraper Engineer,
stepped in a week later as a pinch hitter and wrote a story
on the coach’s retirement.

Meanwhile a new addition to the staff appeared in the
form of Janice, a cat who claimed relation to Mehitabel
and the friendship of Archy, a cockroach who wrote for a
New York daily many years ago. Janice wrote long letters
to the editor and caused considerable comment in such
places as the English department and oﬂice of the Dean of
Women.

Managing Editor Judy Gotterer and News Editor Irv
Rothman did a series of articles on the Core—Curriculum
which the News ﬁnally broke late in February.

The long standing guild system came up for revision
shortly after a column by Joan Thomas which pointed up
the inadequacies of the system as it had been.

The News gave a good account of itself as it was at-
tacked by several of the Pittsburgh dailies. The ﬁrst blow
came as a result of the debate topic for the year which dealt
with Red China. The second came as a result of a rumor
regarding the formation of a girls’ twirling corps. The
downtown papers literally tried to start a civil war at Pitt
but the editorial page of the Newx bristled with counter
punches.

Credit must go to all the people who kept the high
standards which have become synonamous with the Pitt
News. . . . “One of America’s Great Student Newspapers.”

With four full years of publication behind it, The Skyscraper
Engineer, a semi—technical publication, has become one of
the leading engineering magazines in the country.

This year the engineers have for the first time used four
color work on their cover and on one issue they even used
a ﬁve color process. They also started a section of informal
pictures taken around the engineering buildings. This was
done so that the engineers would feel that they were all a
part of the magazine. In the 1955-56 season of publication,
The Skyscraper will move their headquarters to the new
engineering building. This move will aid the staff in co-
ordinating their activities more with those of the majority
of engineers. During the past Engineer's Week in March,
the Skyscraper Engineer was one of the most active organ-
izations that participated in the event. They put out a
special edition and they also sold green derbys and gave
away Engineer’s VVeek buttons. The staﬁf also had its
members working on almost every other committee that
worked on the week’s festivities.

The staff, this year, was made up of Editor in Chief
Bill Rimmel, Associate Editors Paul Thomas and James
McKalip, Layout Editor Thomas Bundorf, Story Editor
Chuck Hadﬁeld, Features Editor Mitch Kozikowski, Art
Editors Cecil Townsend and Paul McKelvy and Photo
Editor Bob Fleischman.

Nick Sirianni was the capable business manager this
year and he was ably assisted by Don Rooney, advertising
manager and assistant business manager. Tom Tarolli and
Hank Zentgraf were the circulation managers. Although it
is impossible to list all the people that were of great help
during the year we think that they deserve a vote of
thanks.

THE PITT

The Pitt Capsule is a publication sponsored by the student
branch of the American Pharmaceutical Association. All
editorial and administrative work is conducted by the
students of the Pharmacy School with the aid of a faculty
advisory committee. The Pin‘ Capsule is now in its tenth
year of publication. It goes to press ﬁve times during the
academic year and enjoys a circulation not -only to the
Pharmacy School students and faculty but to many of the
alumni as well. It is also mailed to each of the other phar-
macy schools in the country.

The aims of the Pill Capsule are several-fold. As a publi-
cation of the student A.Ph.A. branch, it publicizes all

branch activities with particular emphasis on recruiting
new branch members. As a publication representing the
University of Pittsburgh, it gives adequate space to all
matters concerning the college and pharmacy. It also car-
ries news of the Alumni, so as to further relationships be-
tween the school and its graduates. As a publication for
the students of the School of Pharmacy, it carries articles
of interest to the students; and by use of editorials, com-
ments on certain conditions that may arise in the ﬁeld
from time to time. Finally, the Pitt Capsule also prints
excerpts from current publications so as to keep the stu-
dent body abreast of the advancement of Pharmacy.

PUBLICATIONS ADVISOR, DR. DONALD E. SWARTS

The publications here at Pitt have long enjoyed a. freedom of writing which is
beneﬁcial to students as well as being the best possible training for future
journalistic careers. A backlog of experience in this ﬁeld has shown that a
guiding hand is a Very welcome thing to have when problems get too big or
complex for harrassed students. Such a guide is found at Pitt in the person of
Dr. Donald E. Swarts, director of student publications.

The long list of accomplishments with which Dr. Swarts must be credited
would appear to be a limiting factor in the time he devotes to publications,
but such is not the case. His sure grasp of student problems and his diplomacy
and sincerity have done much more than to impress us with his ability to
advise. He has given more time and thought to the entire student body than
was ours to expect. Dr. Swarts is a man to whom not only publications, but
all the students owe much. We give our sincere and heartfelt thanks to him
for the many jobs that he has helped us with so completely and tirelessly.

ALPHA IOTA CHAPTER

Alpha Delta Pi is the oldest social sorority on Pitt’s
campus. These girls work together to promote a har-
monious group and to develop many happy lasting
friendships. Their motto, “VVe Live For Each Other,”
sums up this statement.

Alpha Delta Pi had many unusual social affairs during
the year. Among them were a bake sale, a black and
white Christmas formal, a Spring formal, a Founders

Day Dinner, the annual open—house after the Pitt-Navy
football game, a tea given for the students living in the
sorority house, and a “Cinerama Party.” The girls
hardly had time to recover from these affairs, before
their alumnae gave a “brunch” in the actives’ honor.

The Alpha Delta Pi’s also believe in fostering joy for
others. This year they made and repaired toys for chil-
dren who had none. The girls combined with the Sigma
Alpha Epsilon fraternity to give a Christmas party for
orphans. Each member of the sorority donated money
for a national equipment pool which would provide,
in cooperation with the National Society for Crippled
Children and Adults, equipment for treatment centers,
clinics and schools for handicapped children.

Alpha Delta Pi also placed second in last year’s
Spring Carnival ﬂoat parade. They won third place in
Pan—hellenic Sing.

The Alpha Epsilon Phi’s certainly have done an excel-
lent job of living up to their primary ideal of fostering
everlasting friendship among their members. Their
fall season began with a regional conclave; Alpha
Epsilon Phi’s from Penn State, Carnegie Tech and
Maryland were present. The conclave consisted of a
picnic, two luncheons, business meetings and a dinner-
dance which was attended by alumnae.

Nu Chapter President Cynthia Aberman met the
AEPhi war orphan, Jonas Huisman, while in Holland.
The sorority helps support Jonas and carries on active
correspondence with him. The chapter also held a
Christmas party for orphans.

Promoting friendliness among their members also
extended to the Carnegie Tech campus. Pitt Alpha Ep-

silon Phi’s celebrated the annual Founder’s Day with
their Tech sisters at a luncheon.

The AEPhi’s honored their mothers with a Mothers’
Day Luncheon. Fathers and alumns were invited to
other various social events during the year. Thanks-
giving time was barn dance time for these girls, and
with the spring came their formal dinner-dance.

Last year, Nu Chapter, which was founded in 1920,
received the third prize Pan—Hellenic scholarship award.
AEPhi Fonda Goldman was also president of Cwens,
and Marlene Cohen was Phi Ep’s sweetheart.

VVith all of these activities, one would think these
inhabitants of the Belleﬁeld Dwellings would be busy
enough, but they found time to aid their national soror-
ity project, which is to aid UNESCO.

Chi Omegas returned from a busy summer ready for
another year of work and fun. As always, Chi Omegas
were participating in campus activities. They could
boast of three senior mentors, Margie Toth, Vivian
Thayer and Bobbi Douglas. On the musical side, Barb
Pancoast, Barbara Rupp, Vivian Thayer and Janet
Grenfell all sang in the Heinz Chapel Choir. In women’s
activities Barbara Rupp served as Housing Board
Chairman, Barb Pancoast was Transfer Committee
Chairman and Bobbi Douglas was vice-president of her
class. Betty Ann Young was a member of Student Con-
gress and Bea Pellegrino was Social Chairman of the
same organization.

Social life was also important to Chi Omegas. Tea
dances were fun, but high spots of the year were the
two formals—one at Christmas and the other in the
spring. Homecoming featured prize—winning house
decorations and a tea for the alums after the game.

Three of the Chi O’s are ready for a meeting.

Chi O’s, though, thought of other people besides
themselves. Celebrating Christmas with the annual
orphan’s party was just one of the things they did for
others. A Chi Omega award for an outstanding stu-
dent in political science is given each year. Any student
is eligible for this award.

As a reward for hard work in the 1954 Spring Festival,
the Chi Omega show, “Tongo,” won third place and the
front was awarded the first place trophy.

ALPHA THETA CHAPTER

Since it was first founded on the University campus on
April 16, 1916, Delta Delta Delta Sorority has tried to
establish a perpetual bond of friendship among its
members. The organization attains this purpose by
developing a stronger and more womanly character and
by broadening the moral and intellectual life of its
members.

The spirit of co—operation and willingness to work in
Tri—Delt can well be seen by the cups that grace their
mantel. They have won the first place cup for the best
Spring Carnival Show three years in a row. At the 1954
Pan Hel Sing, they walked away with another first
place trophy.

ideals by contributing their time and services to certain
charitable organizations. Last year they held the annual
Christmas orphans’ party and the $150 scholarship was
ofTered to any woman on the university campus deserv-
ing of such an award.

The sorority also boasts of members that have proven
themselves outstanding leaders on the campus. Pat
Baird was an awardee of a trip to Europe last year and
was also president of the Senior class. LaVerne Dunten
was corresponding secretary of WSGA and Audrey
Longridge was a member of Senior Court. The sorority
was also very proud of Pauline Markess, Ginny An-
thony, and Dorothy Tear who made up part of the
first co-ed cheerleading group at Pitt.

As a social group on Pitt’s campus, Delta Sigma Phi has
rapidly risen in recognition among the fraternities.
Founded here at the University in 1916, it has in the
last few years made itself a worthy competitor to the
more established groups.

Primary among its aims and purposes are scholarship,
brotherhood and service to their University and coun-
try. As chapter projects, the boys gave an orphans
party and supported several charitable drives.

Their social program last year included three im-
pressive affairs: the Sailors’ Ball, the Carnation ball,
and the fall Green VVave Weekend. VVeekly parties‘ also
ﬁgured largely in the social plan.

The list of honors that Delta Sigma Phi accumulated
last year makes it easy to understand the group’s newly
acquired importance as a Greek letter fraternity. In
the Spring, they took first place in the IF sing, third
place in the fall homecoming display and third place
in the bowling league. “Tongo,” last year’s Carnival
show, which through their combined efforts with the
Chi Omega Sorority, won third place and the show front
took a first place trophy.

The men of Delta Sigma Phi have made their mark
at the University of Pittsburgh. Don Kettering was
elected Interfraternity president; Bob Dickinson was
president of Omicron Delta Kappa, senior VVorthy and
Men’s Debate, and Paul Petro was the head of Student
Congress Assemblies Committee and President of
Pi Tau Phi.

“And, furthermore, the Delta Sig's have better organization.”

GAMMA SIGMA CHAPTER

Founded at Bethany College in 1857, Delta Tau Delta
constantly strives to practice the aims of the fraternity:
positive growth in personality, force of character, and
individuality. These aims are reflected in the actions of
the fraternity. Delta Tau Delta had a well rounded list
of activities, both social and scholastic. Last fall the
Delts celebrated their 50th anniversary at a banquet-
formal held in the William Penn Hotel. Since that big
event, the Delts have had many tea dances, house par-
ties and the annual spring formal at the Jacktown Ho-
tel. Christmas time brought many activities for the
fraternity, but the fellows found time to give a Christ-
mas party for the orphans with a Santa Claus distribu-
ting presents to all the children. Spring Carnival time
introduced the campus to “French Fried,” a gay show
revolving around the choosing of a French prime minis-

ter. On the scholastic side, the Delts.had many mem-
bers who were leaders on campus. Jarvis Cotton served
as President of Men’s Glee Club, and was also a member
of Omicron Delta Kappa. Taking his place beside Jar-
vis in O.D.K. was Bud Hodgin, who was also very
active in Alpha Epsilon Delta, an honorary medical
fraternity. Henry Lange, a member of A.E.D., belonged
to Beta Beta Beta, an honorary fraternity in the college
while Lynn Watson was known as “the orator” around
the fraternity house, as he was a member of Men's
Debate. The Delts were well represented in athletics by
Jim Palmer, Jim Zercher and Ralph Gaetano, members
of the Pitt swimming team.

Delta Tau Delta can well be proud of their many
prominent members and of the various activities in
which the fraternity participated.

Freedom and truth are the two great ideals of the Czechoslovak
peoples. Dominating their cheerful room is a bronze relief of
Thomas G. Masaryk, greatest personality of the Czechs and
Slovaks. It is embedded in the front wall between the words
“Pravda Vi/t\efzi/,” “Truth Conquers.” Cast for its exact posi-
tion the portrait suggests with the nation’s motto that here
nothing unworthy can be learned or taught, that the poison of

prejudice is neutralized.

Flowers of botanical accuracy are painted on the larch rafters
as in Slovak country churches. Other designs are creations of
fantasy. Miraculous trees, delightful concepts of the love of
life where bright birds and insects perch and buzz among oddly
mixed leaves, fruits and ﬂowers, are deftly painted on the
window wall. The unusual ceiling has six panels portraying

famous men in Czechoslovak history.

Further beauty is added by the use of wood inlay. The desk
is ornamented with panels symbolizing higher knowledge. A
spray of linden appears on the reading stand as an emblem of

homelife.

Upholstered in red leather, oak furniture with heart—shaped

apertures contrast strikingly with mellow white walls.

Opposite the entrance at wrought—iron shrine encases a hand-
written letter from President Masaryk to Pitt students, pro-
claiming education the workshop of the world. The whole room

is- a shrine recognizing Czechoslovakia’s inspirational ideals.

among Pitt sororities.

But all was not work for the Delta Zetas. Numerous
social events were held including a Halloween party, a
Christmas party, a senior picnic and a Spring formal.
Nationally, the Pitt Delta Zetas rank near the top. They
were awarded the national Delta Zeta scholarship,
rushing and activities awards.

On Easter, the Delta Zetas gave a party for cerebral
palsy children. At Christmas they brought a little
more happiness and cheer to others by giving an or-
phans party.

Their outstanding scholastic record and many social
activities really surpassed the commendable purposes
of Delta Zeta. This purpose is uniting members in
bonds of lasting friendship, promoting their moral and
social culture and developing plans for guidance and
unity in action.

Kappa Alpha Theta received many honors last spring.
Among them were first place in the Mcznurcripts poster
contest, second place with the Phi Gamma Delta Fra-
ternity for the Carnival Show and third place for their
Carnival front.

This year the chapter was especially proud of the
many sisters who were quite prominent in extra—curricu—
lar activities. Janet Fiorucci was president of Panhel—
lenic Council and a member of Mortar Board; Irene
Marsico was president of Mortar Board, and Nancy
Zentgraf was treasurer of the same organization. Dolly
Consolo was vice president of Alpha Beta Gamma;
Dolly McCabe was secretary of Cwens, and Peggy

The Kappa Kappa Gamma’s began the school year with
a spirit of friendship as they joined with the Tri Delts
for a Halloween party. In October the Kappas cele-
brated their Founder’s Day with a dinner at the Gate-
way Center dining room. December, too, was a busy
month for the Kappa Kappa Gammas. They held their
annual Christmas formal in the Blue Room at their
sorority house. They invited the house girls to a
Christmas party and held a Christmas party for under-
privileged orphans.

In addition to these social events, parents, actives
and alumnae were invited to a reception in honor of the
sorority’s new pledges. The girls also joined with Delta

XI CHAPTER

1954-55 was a year ﬁlled with honors for the Kappa Nu
fraternity. The brothers started the year by winning
the Interfraternity Scholarship Cup for the second con-
secutive year and by placing ﬁrst in the Greek Sing.
The Kappa Nu brothers who take an active part in
Men’s Debate helped to capture ﬁrst place in the Inter-
fraternity Debate. In keeping with their purpose of
cultivating a spirit of harmony and brotherhood, each
pledge class plans a project for the fraternity house; this
year’s pledges built a patio for their backyard. Although
the Kappa Nu’s are constantly in a Whirl of activity in
school events, they still ﬁnd time to enjoy their social
calendar. Among their social events for this year were a
\Vinter formal at Churchill Valley Country Club, a

Spring formal at Baldoc Country Club, barn dances,

provided the entertainment. At Christmas time they
held their annual Christmas party for orphan children.

The Kappa Nu’s are very proud of their outstanding
men on campus: Emil Herman, president of Kappa Nu,
is also president of Student Congress, former president
of Phi Eta Sigma, a member of Druids, Pitt Glee Club,
and Omicron Delta Kappa; Stanley Greenﬁeld is the
vice president of Interfraternity Council, Secretary of

As the Phi Delta Thetas view the past school year, they
see one of their most successful seasons.

In activities the Phi Delts took top honors in intra-
mural football, winning twenty-three straight games
and capturing not only inter-fraternity and intramural
awards but also the city title for the second consecutive
year. Honors copped last spring included ﬁrst place in
I. F. basketball and ﬁrst in the sweepstakes contest.

The Phi Delts were outstanding in other activities as
well. Proof of this success was the third place tie award
in the I. F. Sing and first place trophy in the Sling.

The social season started off with the typically gala
VVhite Carnation Dance which ended the rushing sea-
son. After that came a series of festive activities includ-
ing house dances, buffet dinners, grove parties, the
featured Triad Dance and the Spring Formal.

Phi Delta places high with members participating in
school political activities. Milt Emery, Omicron Delta
Kappa, Druid and Men’s Council executive; Art
Vogel, vice president of Men’s Council, and Donald
Shanafelt, Phi Beta Kappa, and Men’s Council, were
outstanding as were the seven other members in school
governing bodies.

One of the Phi Delt’s biggest projects last year was
the redecorating of their basement to provide new pine-

they have also kept themselves busy in many campus
activities. The brothers are proud of the men who
have attempted to further these aims: Harvey Klein is
publicity director of the Pitt Players and has been
tapped by Omicron Delta Kappa; Don Gartner, a
member of Men’s Council and vice—president of the
Druids; Neal Zweig, who is Advertising Editor of the
Owl; Howie Berman, Interfraternity Scholarship Chair-
man; and Boyd Swartz, a member of Kappa Kappa
Psi, national honorary band fraternity. Besides the
brothers’ many campus activities, they still found time
for a well rounded social life. The Phi Ep’s held an
annual Christmas party each year for orphans. They

had a winter formal honoring the sweetheart of the
fraternity at the Baldoc Country Club. In the spring
there was a big weekend at which a formal dinner dance
was given, and the fraternity awards were given out.
Other highlights were the tea dances with girls from
Carnegie Tech and P.C.VV., the barn dances, Penn
State VVeekend and the joint lodge party with the
Delts. In December the pledges gave the active broth-
ers a party and provided their own entertainment. Be-
sides landscaping around the house and working on
some civic projects, the pledges went to visit other
chapters of Phi Epsilon Pi to get ideas on how to im-
prove their own chapter. To ﬁnish the year the brothers
had a Mother’s Day luncheon. All this helps to further
the fraternal spirit of Phi Epsilon Pi.

This year the Phi Gamma Delta men had a well-rounded
year of social, academic and athletic activities. The
fraternity boasts of being one of the more outstanding
fraternities on campus. ‘

As fall came to Pitt this year, the Phi Gam’s held
their first formal at Churchill Valley Country Club.
Throughout the ’54 to '55 year, the fraternity held
pledge parties, tea dances, picnics and the annual
Figi Island party at the house. In the springtime, their
other formal serves two purposes: to give their mem-

bers one ﬁnal remembrance of the year and to crown
their sweetheart.

The Phi Gam brothers boast of the athletic honors
they received. Last year they won the all—school trophy
in softball and track'and the interfraternity trophy in
volleyball. Besides this theyreceived a brown jug from
the Phi Gam chapter at W & J by defeating them in
softball, and they took second place in interfraternity
wrestling and swimming.

The Phi Gams are particularly proud of their men
in activities. Roger Jennings, their president, was an
upper class counselor; Walt Becker was a member of
Men's Council, Druids, and a Sophomore class officer
in Engineering; Bo Wilkins was president of Men’s
Council, vice president of Omicron Delta Kappa, an
upper class counselor, Junior class president in the Col-
lege, and a member of the swimming team; Joe Lamar-
tine spent his time swinging from goal posts as the Pitt
panther, and Al Gunderson was an outstanding Pitt
track star.

Brothers and dates relax and enjoy a cup of punch.

BETA THETA CHAPTER

Founded at Wesleyan College for Women in 1852 by
three women whose immediate plan was to band to-
gether in friendship, Phi Mu satisﬁes this same purpose
for its present members at Pitt.

These girls enjoyed many social activities during the
school term. The annual picnic was held at which the
sorority sisters gathered together for a day of fun. Be-
sides their tea dances, the Phi Mu’s held two formals,
one at Christmas and one in the spring. This year the
group initiated a “secret ambitions” party at which
each sister dressed in a manner corresponding to her
secret ambition. -

On a more serious side, Phi Mu emphasized scholar-
ship, friendly relations with fellow students and faculty
participation in activities.

At all their meetings, held in the Belleﬁeld Dwellings,
one of the members gave a short informative talk on
some subject of interest to the group. At least once dur-

ing the month, they held the ‘Philomathian Hour’ dur-
ing which one girl spoke for an hour on an educational
topic.

The girls contributed to their national pledge proj-
ect which was to care for the Indian children of the
Navajo tribe, by gathering food, clothing and money.
For their own chapter project, Phi Mu gave an Easter

IOTA CHAPTER

Perhaps the busiest and most energetic girls on campus
were the Phi Sigma Sigmas. At their new sorority apart-
ment on Bigelow Boulevard, they were forever thinking
up new and exciting ideas for both social and scholastic
activities. One very beneﬁcial activity which the girls
are noted for is their whole—hearted participation in
charitable organizations. Again this year, they spent
one Sunday afternoon washing cars in order to raise
money for the Rheumatic Fever Fund. In addition they
aided in the support of war orphans.

Their endeavors were not all serious, however, for
they had quite a heavy social schedule. Their spring
formal, held each year to welcome new members, was

a very important event. besides house parties, barn
dances and an open house held after the Panhellenic
party for rushees.

The Phi Sig’s can also be proud of their scholastic
achievements. They placed second on campus for
sorority average. They won the scholarship cup at the
Phi Sigma Sigma national convention last June and
received honorable mention for Best Chapter Award
at_the same convention.

In 1868, a few college students joined together in a fra-
ternal bond on the University of Virginia campus. From
this beginning, the Pi Kappa Alpha Fraternity spread
until in 1934 the fraternity was ﬁrst established at Pitt.
The fraternity tries to establish friendship on a lasting
basis.

From early fall to late spring, the PiKA’s social life
was a constant whirl of parties and dances. During rush-
ing week, social events were a regular part of the week.
Pledge parties and tea dances followed after rushing
was over. The Dream Girl Formal was held during
January. At this dance, the sweetheart of the fraternity
was announced. In the month of June, the formal
weekend took its place on the social calendar. Three
days of parties were climaxed by a dinner—dance.

The fraternity added a host of trophies to the mantle-
piece both this year and last. During Spring Carnival
Week festivities, the PiKA’s took two second place
trophies, in carnival front and the ﬂoat parade and
third place in the racer sweepstakes. The fraternity
took a ﬁrst place award for the best Greek Week hat,
third place in the Greek Sing and second place in the
fraternity football league.

The PiKA’s had many men active in school affairs.
Bill VVallhausser was a member of Sigma Tau and
ODK; he was V. pres. of the Heinz Chapel Choir. Ed
Christner was a member of Men’s Council and Druids.
Three members of the group played on the football
team and one performed for the wrestling team.

The boys take good care of their fraternity mascot.

Replica of a ﬁfteenth century Tuscan convent, the Italian
Room has the studied air of Renaissance beauty.

The vivid ceiling attracts immediate attention with tur-
quoise cazettas separated by mouldings of terra cotta, each
set with a carved and gilded rosette. Under such a ceiling, nuns
of the San Dominico Convent, Pesaro, copied holy manuscripts
centuries ago.

Modeled after Italian choir stalls, the tops of the walnut
backs are inlaid with the names in olive wood of men who cre-
ated Italy’s cultural rebirth—Petrarca, Da Vinci, Galileo and
others of unsurpassed genius.

Plastered walls of dove gray complement the Romanesque
entrance and sandstone ﬁreplace from an old Florentine home
and provide the background for a fresco commemorating the
ﬁrst woman graduate of a college.

Six windows in the alcove are made of old blown glass in
tints of yellow, turquoise and light pink. Each window has
shutters oddly reminiscent of the Old World. Sunshine gleams
through these southern windows onto the velvet cushions, add-
ing a touch of Italian warmth.

Student seats simulate the benches of a monastery chapel.
They are excellent examples of ecclesiastic furniture made
suitable for classroom purposes by the addition of tablet arms.

Each seat has the name and founding date of an Italian uni-
versity carved on its back, reminding students and visitors
alike that the ﬁrst university in the world originated at Bologna

in 1088.

GAMMA SIGMA CHAPTER

Pi Lambda Phi fraternity is a non—sectarian national
social fraternity devoted to producing upright American
citizens through brotherhood, fellowship and mutual
assistance. The fraternity, originally founded at Yale
in 1895, was chartered on the Pitt campus in I914.

At homecoming this year, the Pi Lam’s welcomed
their old grads with a party at their house located at
225 N. Dithridge St. The fall and winter seasons were
filled with numerous tea—dances, parties and social
events that kept all the members busy. Two formal
dances in the Winter and summer gave the fraternity
members a chance to give their tuxedos quite a bit of
wear. During the year, the Pi Lam’s had a masquerade
party at Which the members and their dates had their

own Mardi Gras. One of the crowning events in the
Pi Lam’s social calendar was the naming of the fra—
ternity queen at their annual queen affair.

During Pitt’s annual spring carnival the Pi Lam’s
were quite active. This past year they sponsored the
“Dunk a Pi Lam” booth where the object was to toss a
member into a large tank of water. Both the fraternity
members and those who visited the carnival enjoyed
this booth to the utmost!

Pi Lambda Phi has produced many outstanding men
on the Pitt campus: Joseph Trattner, a member of
Men’s Debate, Student Congress, Druids and Chair-
man of Greek Week, was a Well-known student politi-
cian; Alan Skirboll was outstanding as business manager

of the 1955 OWL.

Starting off their social season this year, the SAE’s held
a South Sea Island party with the girls in sarongs and
the boys in sailor and south sea island Qostumes. At the
sweetheart dance this fall, Sherry Grahame was chosen
the new sweetheart. Since then, the SAE’s have had
parties with the Tech chapter, tea dances and an open
house after the Penn State game. The children of the
School for the Blind were entertained at a Christmas
party by the fraternity. One of the brothers dressed as
Santa Claus and handed out presents to the children.
The highlight of their well—rounded social activities Was

the annual fraternity formal held at the Field Club last
spring.

The fraternity also took part in many campus ac-
tivities, coming out on top in many of them. The boys
of SAE won the “chain” which was awarded for the
most original homecoming decoration. They also took
part in the kick—off poster contest and float parade and
copped the ﬁrst place trophies in both.

Many of the SAE’s have also taken part in campus
activities outside of the fraternity: Bob Timmons, jun-
ior class president; John Bellas, sophomore class secre-
tary and a member of the wrestling team; Don Huff, a
member of both the wrestling and football teams, and
Tom Stock, interfraternity rushing chairman.

Through their participation in social and campus ac-
tivities, the members have tried to prove that their fra-
ternity is a part of Pitt. The fraternity has proven that
it stands behind its charter’s aims of “scholastic
achievements, social activities and brotherhood.”

One brother started the party early.

BETA THETA CHAPTER

The year 1954-55 was a big one for the Sigma Chi’s
at Pitt as they began their year by dedicating their
newly decorated house on Bayard Street. Then came a
whirl of social activity as the Sigs joined with the Phi
Delta Theta chapter at Pitt and the Beta Theta Pi’s
at Tech for their annual Miami Triad at the Baldoc
Country Club. Tea dances were held throughout the
year each month, a pledge's party for the actives in
December, several house dances and a sweetheart
dance in the Spring. The brothers also held a Christmas
party and an Easter party for orphans. Following the
initiation of their pledges a formal initiation banquet
was held.

Honors are another specialty with the Sigma Chi’s.

ALPHA ZETA CHAPTER

Although Sigma Delta Tau was established just a short
time ago at Pitt, the chapter has taken great strides to
become one of the most active groups on the campus.
Last spring the SDT’s were very proud of the awards
they received during Spring Carnival. They placed
second with their Carnival booth, “Loop a Lassie,” and
they placed third for their ﬂoat, “Cortez Entering the
City of Gold.” The spirit of the actives was passed on
to the pledge class when they took ﬁrst place in the
Junior Panhellenic Sing. There were many SDT’s in
school activities: Carol Helioif was president of Delta
Delta Lambda; Esther Sperling, secretary of Panhel-
lenic and member of Mortar Board; Sonya Shepman,
rush chairman of Panhellenic; Ravenna Palkovitz,
speech guild advisor, and Phyllis Marcus, Leila Lopen
and Selma White did their best to aid freshmen women
as senior mentors.

In spite of all these activities, the Sigma Delta Tau’s

still found time to donate to blood research, to read to
hospital patients and to entertain orphans at a Christ-
mas party.

Socially, the girls took time out for a Spring dinner
dance, a barn dance, a Mother’s Day luncheon and a
father—daughter party.

It goes without saying that with a record like this
Sigma Delta Tau is no longer the “baby” sorority on
the Pitt campus.

ALPHA BETA CHAPTER

Dating from the year 1856, the Theta Chi fraternity
was founded on the campus of the University of Nor-
wich in Vermont. The Alpha Beta chapter of Theta
Chi was chartered at Pitt in the year 1919.

As the Theta Chi’s planned their social calendar this
year, they were happy with the knowledge that each
member of the fraternity would be given the chance to
enjoy the social aspect of fraternity life. In early fall,
a rash of rushing parties brought new potential mem-
bers ﬂocking to the fraternity doors. After rushing was
over for the semester, the Theta Chi’s followed through
with pledge parties and tea dances for its members.
The fraternity’s homecoming decoration won a second
place award this year, losing “ﬁrst” by only the narrow-
est of margins. The social life of Theta Chi was also

shared with orphans at Christmas time. The Christmas
party for the orphans was held at the house this year. In
January, the winter formal was held while in June the
spring formal was held. At Spring Carnival last year,
the Theta Chi’s had both a booth and a show. Combin-
ing with the Zeta Tau Alpha sorority and Kappa Nu
fraternity, the Theta Chi’s produced “Yukon Take
It VVith You.”

The Theta Chi’s have taken their place on the Pitt
campus beside other outstanding fraternities. It is the
aim of the fraternity to inspire true friendship among
its brothers. The fraternity tries to teach truth, tem-
perance, tolerance and lends a helping hand to those
who need it.

A carefree congenial group, Kappa of Theta Phi Alpha,
found itself quite busy with social activities this year.

A pledge dinner and a fashion show at the University
Club started the Theta Phi Alpha social season olfjust
right. The fashion show in particular was a big success.
Alumnae of Theta Phi Alpha served as models. Two
formals are held each year. The White Rose Formal
took place around Christmas, and another formal fell
in the Spring.

The girls entertained their alumnae with a Founder’s
Day breakfast at which the Senior Service Award was
given to an outstanding senior sister. The alumnae, in
turn, held a Senior Tea at the end of the year to honor
all graduating members. An annual Day of Recollection
was also observed.

In the real yule-tide spirit of giving, Theta Phi Alpha
held a party for orphans. They made dolls for children
and made contributions to various charities. One of the
main charities is the Glenmary Mission in Glendale,
Ohio.

At last year’s Spring Carnival, Theta Phi Alpha
joined with Alpha Phi Delta fraternity to produce their
show “Come Back Little Pisan.”

These girls work continuously toward their two—fold
purpose of promoting a Catholic atmosphere among
themselves and maintaining a high scholastic standing
on campus.

CHI CHAPTER

The Zeta’s started their year full of suggestions and pep
brought from their national convention in Miami,
Florida, by President Arlene Rehak. Homecoming
found the girls busy putting up decorations and wel-
coming everyone to their open house. They celebrated
Christmas with a party for their mothers, the annual
party for orphans and a formal.

Rushing was partly carried out with a dessert party
before Panhellenic Ball and various pledge parties.
In the spring, along with working on Spring Carnival,
the Zeta Tau Alpha’s found time for their spring formal
and a senior banquet.

During the year they had tea dances with the Theta
Chi’s, Pi Kappa Alpha’s, and Phi Gamma Delta’s. Yet
they still found time for service to their national charity,

A scholarship fund, the National Health Project, and
the Foreign Fellowship Award are just a few of the
projects that kept the Alpha Kappa Alpha’s busy. Be-
sides working on these projects the girls spent a lot of
time working for various charitable organizations.

They gave a party at the Terman Avenue Home for
Orphans. They contributed to many charities such as:
The Ethel Hedgeman Lyle Fund, The American Coun-
cil of Human Rights, Hill City, The Red Cross, The
Community Chest and The National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People.

The girls also managed to take an active part in
Pitt’s campus life by maintaining high standards. The
sorority endeavored to cultivate and encourage high
scholastic and ethical standards, to promote unity and
fellowship among college women and to keep alive
within the alumnae an interest in college life and the
progressive movements emanating from them.

A Turkey Trot, a Founder’s Day Celebration and a

OMICRON CHAPTER

The Omicron chapter of Alpha Phi Alpha was founded
at Pitt to foster brotherhood among the members with
social gatherings and by community service.

The brothers work toward community service by
not only participating in charitable drives themselves,
but also instructing their pledges to perform various
tasks throughout the year.

They also ﬁnd time for plenty of social events. Each
year they plan a Christmas party for underprivileged
children. The highlight of the social calendar comes
with the Coronation Ball when all the members turn
out to crown the fraternity queen.

They manage to participate in many school activi-
ties. Last year their booth in spring carnival was “Der
Blitzkrieg.” Their president, Leon L. Haley, is a mem-
ber of Omicron Delta Kappa.

Alpha Phi Alpha has the distinction of being the first
intercollegiate Greek-letter fraternity established for
Negro men. Recently, however, its doors have been
opened for men of all races and religion. The Pitt
chapter was founded in 1913.

One of the boys “maneuvers the crazy ten over eighty—eight."

MU CHAPTER

Last year in spring carnival the Alpha Phi Delta Fra-
ternity Was one of the few to have both a spring carnival
show, “Come Back Little Paisan,” and a booth, “For-
tunes.” Much Work was put into both, and through their
elfort they won the first place trophy for the booth.

Alpha Phi Delta at Pitt is a social fraternity which
aims at providing a social life for those students of
Italian descent. It is one of twenty-three such chapters
in the United States. The qualiﬁcations for membership
are to be full, half, or one-quarter Italian descent and
to conform with the University stipulation of having a
1.0 scholastic average.

Each year the fraternity includes in its social activ-
ities hayrides, barn dances and two major events, the
Christmas and spring formals.

The fraternity’s two charitable objectives are donat-
ing blood and contributing to the Red Cross.

During the past year, Alpha Phi Delta has met in the
Cathedral. Its most important aim of the future is to
obtain a house.

The Beta Sigma Omicron girls started off the past school
year in their newly remodeled apartment on Bigelow
Boulevard.

Although this sorority had one of the highest scholas-
tic ratings on campus, the girls still found time to take
an active part at Pitt and planned many social affairs
during the year.

Again the sorority celebrated Founder’s Day with a
dinner. The Christmas season brought the annual win-
ter formal as well as the yearly party for orphans. Barn
dances, costume parties and the traditional spring
formal were other affairs that kept the Beta Sigma
Omicron’s socially busy.

Beta Sigma Omicron was founded nationally in 1888.
The chapter at the University of Pittsburgh was added
in 1930, only twenty—ﬁVe years ago.

Maintaining an active part in Pitt’s social life, donating
time and elfort to charities and keeping up a high scho—
lastic standing takes up much of the time of the Delta
Sigma Theta’s. ‘

Last year Delta Sigma Theta girls spurted across the
ﬁnish line to win second place in the women’s races, held
for the ﬁrst time at Spring Carnival. The girls also
entered a ﬂoat depicting Joan of Arc being burned at
the stake.

Each year this sorority offers two $500 scholarships
to students who are deserving of such an honor. The
girls also contributed to such charitable organizations
as the Red Cross, the Community Chest and many
orphanages throughout the city. In addition to
these contributions, the sorority had a very unusual
project. The girls helped sponsor a bookmobile which
carries literature to areas where books would be other-
wise unobtainable. Again the Delta Sig’s have shown
their true worthiness to the Pitt Campus.

GAMMA EPSILON ZETA CHAPTER

Lambda Chi Alpha national was founded at Boston
University in 1909. Since then it has become one of the
fastest growing fraternities among the Greek letter
societies, Gamma Epsilon Zeta chapter being one of the
one hundred and thirty—seven Chapters in the United
States.

This year’s Lambda Chi Alpha calendar was ﬁlled
with hayrides, barn parties and other affairs with the
purpose of building a better fraternal brotherhood.

The Lambda Chi’s supported a considerable number
of charities. At Christmas they held a Christmas party
for an orphan’s home—Santa, gifts, tree and all the
trimmings. And not only did they contribute annually
to the Community Chest and the Red Cross, but also
urged its members to donate blood each month.

During their busy year they also found time for their
socials which included the annual formals, participa-
tion in school politics in which John Perri was a leading
member and for activities such as the Spring Carnival
show. Last year the fraternity presented a hilarious
show, “Soviet Capers.”

And then I called a point of order in Student Congress meeting.

Full of rich burgher gusto, the atmosphere of this room tells of
German love for the good life and knowledge. The genius of
the German mind is brought out by the many great names
carved in a band about the room. Furnishings of the room are
made up of the materials and spirit of the German Renaissance
in the sixteenth century when German craftsmanship in archi-
tecture and woodcarving were beautifully distinctive. Many
features of the classroom were inspired by the great hall at
the University of Heidelberg, oldest German seat of higher
education.

Walnut paneling in walls and ceiling contrast with the oak
ﬂooring. WindoW—seats, student armchairs and the doors with
columns decorated in stenciled arabesques are also of walnut.

Exquisite stained-glass windows picture the world-famous
Grimm fairy tales With iridescent colors, while darkening the
room with medieval poignancy that contrasts with the somber
setting.

Rear picture—panels are made of careful wood inlay. They
picture the pursued I-Ieiden—Ro°slein, heroine of Heine’s love
poem, and the golden—haired siren Lorelei, enchantress of the
Rhine.

The imposing bookcase contains a collection of German
books on literature and other subjects donated by the German
Ministry of Education. The quotation from Goethe in the
shield characterizes German strength. Translated, it reads:
“Great mastery results from wise restraint, and law alone

points out the Way to liberty!”

MU CHAPTER

Phi Kappa fraternity had an outstanding year in 1954.-
1955. The brothers were kept busy with numerous
events, both on campus and in the fraternity. They had
two formal dinner dances, in the winter at the Colonial
Manor Hotel and in the spring at the Greensburgh
Country Club. A Christmas party for the orphans was
held jointly with the Newman Club. Other social ac-
tivities included a pledge party each semester, house
parties, tea dances, barn dances and dinners. Phi
Kappa is proud of having received the Outstanding
House Award for the past three years from the Dean
of Men’s ofﬁce.

The president, Chuck Fritz, is a member of the
track team, treasurer of the Newman Club, a member
of the Druids and on Men’s Council. Tony Arabia is
the publicity chairman for both the Newman Club and
the P.I.F.S.C.O. and is also on Student Congress.
Other outstanding members of the fraternity are
Fred Wegly, a member of the Society of Military Engi-
neers and Tom Geist who is a member of Sigma Tau and

PSI CHAPTER

On campus for thirty—five years, Sigma Alpha Mu
fraternity celebrated its anniversary with an annual
founder’s day formal on December fourth, commemo-
rating the aims set forth by the group to foster a spirit
of fraternity, loyalty to the alma mater and the ideals
of manhood, democracy and humanity.

In the past school year they have worked hard toward
that purpose with considerable accomplishments. In
school activities they participated in school interfra—
ternity athletics and won several awards. They took
first place in badminton, ﬁrst in softball and third in
basketball. On the side they managed to work for the
Red Cross, a Jewish children’s home and for the United
Jewish Fund which was under the direction of one of the
alumni, Mr. Nathaniel P. Kann.

The social functions which the fraternity offered in-
cluded hilarious “jail parties” in which the house was
decorated like a jail and everyone dressed as high class
criminals, and other dances when the house was deco-
rated with hay, and as a French cabaret, but the high-
light of the year came with the annual spring formal.

The Sammies whoop it up as Pitt scores a goal.

PENNSYLVANIA GAMMA CHAPTER

Sigma Phi Epsilon Fraternity was one of the ﬁrst fra-
ternities on the Pitt Campus to change “Hell Week”
into a “Help Week.” The brothers make their pledges
do something constructive during this week to build a
stronger brotherhood within the fraternity and to keep
their purpose of furthering the ideals of Pitt.

For Sigma Phi Epsilon members, “Help Week” car-
ries its signiﬁcance throughout the year. A special fund
helps to send about 400 underprivileged boys and girls
to summer camp each year.

Social fraternities must have their social events, and
Sig Ep’s had their share of them this year. In Novem-
ber, the brothers celebrated the Pitt-Penn State Week- I
end with a house dance, and during the rest of the year,
they had a series of events including tea dances, a
hayride, an Alumni-Active dance, a barn dance and
other social affairs. In February, all Sig Ep brothers
gathered for their annual Founder’s Day banquet. Two
of the major social functions were the Sweetheart dance
and the Southern Ball, both held in the spring.

“We should have tried that sorority house in the ﬁrst place.”

Next to the Miami Triad, Sigma Pi enjoys the distinc-
tion of being the oldest fraternity to originate west of
the Ohio River. The Chi Chapter at Pitt, founded in
1920, can also be proud of being a growing part of that
fraternity.

During the past year, the Sigma Pi’s enjoyed a full
schedule of social events. Between the periodic house
dances and the other parties, the members had a Christ-
mas party at the house on Mellwood Street and an
Alumni banquet to commemorate Founder’s Day. In
the spring, the Sigma Pi’s had a long to be remembered
weekend when they had not only the annual Orchid Ball
but also an outing at one of the county parks. Last
year’s Sigma Pi Carnival booth was unique in selling
pizza pie.

From 1932 to 1948 the Chi chapter at Pitt had been
inactive, but since being reactivated, it has built up its
membership and obtained a chapter house. It aims at
establishing a brotherhood among students, developing
character and promoting civic righteousness among
college men.

BETA THETA CHAPTER

Helping others is the main purpose of the Sigma Sigma
Sigma sorority. Tri Sigma girls are continually endeav-
oring to fulﬁll this purpose. This year the chapter took
part in volunteer Red Cross work; they contributed to
the Robbie Page Memorial Fund for underprivileged
children in the mountains of West Virginia, and they
held their annual orphan’s party with a fraternity dur-
ing the Christmas season.

Besides helping others, the Tri Sig’s still found time
to socialize. They had many tea dances with fraterni-
ties, a spring formal, a Christmas formal and a tea in
honor of their mothers.

This year on April 21, the Sigma Sigma Sigma ac-
tives and alumnae gathered at the PAA to celebrate
their national founding at Farmille, Virginia.

Each year the actives take a general knowledge test
about the fraternity’s history. This test was given to all
chapters of Sigma Sigma Sigma throughout the country
by the national organization. The Pitt chapter received
an honorable mention for their average of 97.

The current school happenings are important to these Tri Sig’s
who are reading the Pitt News to see what’s what.

ZITHLETLES

A people of brilliant imagination and sincere faith, the Hun-
garians have made their room a practical place for creative
thought. Its great simplicity, accented by an ornamental beau-
ty, is symbolic of the traits of the legendary descendants of
Nimrod, the Persian hunter.

Completely paneled walls are stained to a rich tobacco
brown. The Woods are matched in symmetrical patterns, high-
lighting an effect of massiveness and warm restraint.

The vivid contrasting ceiling is a frame of seventy squares
painted in gay folk motifs. Done in Budapest, they capture
the beauty of life treasured in the homes of Hungarian peas-
ants. A frieze contains two stanzas of Hymmzs, the national
anthem. Stern words describe the Magyar: “Fate, of old, has
rent him sore; may it now bring healing! By—gone sins are
all atoned, ev’n the future sealing.” Strength of purpose is an
unshakable part of his ultimate destiny. The Hungarian Room
is a memorial to his distinctive genius.

The door is a superb piece of woodcarving. Panels of tulips
and pomegranate leaves alternating with wheat-sheaves give
intense vitality to the room. Floor squares illustrate a skill at
contrasting decorated with simple construction materials. The
lectern is dramatically modern in its severe lines.

Mementos in the tulip chest—cabinet and the carved arms of
the famous University of Buda surmounting the blackboard

remind all of the Magyar’s love of learning.

ATHLETIC DEPARTMENT

The Athletic Department of the University of Pitts-
burgh, with oﬂices in Pitt Memorial Field House above
Pitt Stadium, is separate from the Physical Education
Department although the two work hand-in-glove.

Head of the Department is zit/zletic Director TOM
HAMILTON. Mr. Hamilton in ﬁve short years at Pitt
has done a great deal towards building up the Uni-
Versity’s athletic program, not only in the ﬁeld of inter-
collegiate sports but in capturing the interest of the
average student in athletics and physical education.

A former United States Naval Academy All—American
football player and also a former coach there, Mr.
Hamilton has on two occasions coached the Panthers.
He took over the football squad in 1951 after the
departure of Len Casanova, and again last fall, on the

destinies of the Blue and Gold through the ﬁnal six
games of the season. Under his direction, the team won
four of those six contests.

FRANK CARVER, dssismm‘, zit/L/etic: Dept. Right-
hand man to the athletic director is Frank Carver,
graduate manager of athletics. Mr. Carver came to
work at Pitt in 1929, just a couple of years after his
graduation, and in point of service is the senior member
of the athletic department.

LOWELL “RED” DAWSON, Footoczll Coach. Mr.
Dawson was in his third year at Pitt when a mid—season
illness forced him to give up football during the 1954
campaign. He came to Pittsburgh in 1952, winning six
and losing three his ﬁrst year. In 1953, his record here
was three wins, ﬁve losses and a tie, and the 1954 record
showed three losses.

ROBERT TIMMONS, Bmkctbczll Coach. Bob Tim—
mons was appointed head coach in 1953 to succeed Dr.
H. C. Carlson, who had held the job for 31 years. A
star football end under the late Jock Sutherland in the
early 3o’s, Mr. Timmons returned to his alma mater as
an assistant football coach in 1946. He still doubles as a
grid aide until basketball practice opens each Novem-
ber I.

LEO BEMIS, Soccer Coach, Intramural: C046/1. Leo
Bemis has been director of men’s intramural athletics
since 194.7 and last year became Pitt’s ﬁrst soccer
coach. His ﬁrst varsity squad won eight and lost only
one. He graduated from Edinboro College and took his
physical education degree at Pitt.

DON MINIHAN, /fxsislcznt Track Com/2. Youthful
Don Minihan became assistant Pitt track coach last
fall, succeeding Lloyd Duff who moved on to the head
coaching job at Connecticut. Mr. Minihan was co-
captain of the Pitt track team in 1954., participating in
the high jump and pole vault.

BEN GRADY, Swimming Coach. Ben Grady came to
Pitt in 1939 and has been producing ﬁne swimming
teams since that time with the exception of ﬁve years
in the Navy during World VVar II. A former All-
American diver at Michigan, Mr. Grady piloted his
boys to consecutive Eastern Collegiate Swimming As-
sociation titles in 1952, 1953 and 1954.

REX PEERY, Wrestling Coach. A three—time NCAA
champion at Oklahoma A & M, Rex Peery brought the
Blue and Gold from a winless campaign in 1950, his
ﬁrst year, to the 1954. Eastern Collegiate championship
and runnerup position nationally to climax a season
that showed nine wins in ten meets.

WARREN NEIGER, Gymnastics Coach. Warren Neiger
came to Pitt in 1951 to put together a gymnastics team.
The sport achieved varsity status for the ﬁrst time in
1955. Mr. Neiger, a Philadelphia native, graduated
from Penn State in 1947 and was assistant gymnastics
coach at Georgia Tech for ﬁve years before coming to
Pittsburgh.

JOSEPH GROMKO, Riﬂe Coach. Sgt. Gromko was
appointed last fall to succeed Sgt. Robert Davidson as
coach of the Pitt riﬁe team. The new coach, whose home
is in McKees Rocks, is a veteran of more than 15 years
in the army. At present he is attached to the Reserve
Oﬂicers Training Corps at the University.

JAMES TULLY, Tcnnir Coach, Squash Coach. Jim
Tully has been Pitt’s tennis coach for four years, and
last year also assumed the job of coaching the squash
team. He is a former National Professional Squash

Trojans Rap Pitt, 27-7,
In Night Opener at LA

F0m"5 P5155 Score:

TD; Last Ha/j” Fatal

Opening with Southern California in a night game
at Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, the Panthers
stayed on even terms with the Trojans for three
periods but ﬁnally lost out in the last quarter,
27-7.

Pitt scored on a 49-yard pass play from Henry
Ford to Dick Scherer in the second period after
Southern Cal had opened the scoring a few min-
utes earlier.

Soph fullback Tom Jenkins was doing the
brunt of the running for the Panthers until he
was hurt midway through the third stanza. Shortly
after this, the Trojans started to move and broke
the deadlock in the ﬁnal quarter with three touch-
downs.

Jon Arnett was the big gun for the victors as he
continually tore through the Panther line for big
gains and wound up with three touchdowns.

Penalties cost the Panthers quite heavily in this
tilt as many drives were halted by offside and
other infractions.

Minnesota. opened the home card at Pitt Stadium
and as far as the Panthers were concerned, the
Gophers should have never been invited.

The ﬁnal score was 4.6-7 with Minnesota on the
tall end, and this end was sure far from the other
end.

At halftime the Gophers only had 14 compared
to Pitt's 7, and the battle looked like it might be
close all the way. In the second half, though, the
Big Ten team took advantage of ﬁve fumbles and
three interceptions to ring up ﬁve TD’s and wrap
up the contest.

The turning point was a 64-yard punt return
by Gopher star halfback Bob McNamara in the
third period and the Panthers never recovered.

The fabulous Irish from South Bend, Notre Dame, were the second visitors to Pitt
Stadium and they packed the bowl with 60,144 people as they knocked oﬂf Pitt,
33-0-

This was the largest crowd here since 1938.

The Irish were coached by youthful Terry Brennan who took over this year for
Frank Leahy.

taking down—and-out pass,

Brennan showed the fans that he too knew how to
coach as his charges played outstanding on offense
as well as defense.

Pitt stayed with the Irish until a controversial
play in the Panther end zone gave Notre Dame a
lead late in the second period.

This was the game that soph Corny Salvaterra
was switched to quarterback and although it
didn’t result in Blue and Gold scores, the move
proved quite valuable in later games.

Athletic Director Tom Hamilton, stepping into
the head coaching position just ﬁve days previous,
directed the Panthers to a nation-wide shocker
over his former alma mater, Navy, 21-19.

Since Coach Red Dawson had to go to the hos-
pital with a heart ailment, Hamilton took over as
Interim Coach for the remainder of the season.

On the ﬁeld the Panthers had many stars but
two that especially shone were Quarterback Corny
Salvaterra and End Freddy Glatz. For their per-
formances, Salvaterra was selected for the back-
ﬁeld of the week and Glatz as lineman of the week
in national polls.

The Middies had been unbeaten before this
game, but the Panthers stopped this while also
garnering their ﬁrst win. The game was close all
the way with Navy pressing hard to come back;
however, the Panthers were strong that afternoon.

Salvaterra powers his way through big gap in Navy line for winning touchdown.

Playing before a Homecoming crowd at the
Stadium, the Pitts pulled their second straight
upset by scoring with 39 seconds remaining.

Corny Salvaterra scored the dramatic touch-
down on an end sweep. Although the Panthers
had the Wildcats on the ropes throughout most
of the game, they had to put on a theatrical ﬁnish
to gain the Victory.

The triumph evened the all—time series record
between the schools at two apiece. The contest
was also televised nationally as the Game of the

Playing in Morgantown before a record crowd,
the Blue and Gold of Pitt emerged triumphant
over West Virginia, 13-10.

The game was sweet revenge for the Panthers
who had been defeated the past two years by the
Mounties. It also knocked WVU out of conten-
tion for a post—season bowl game.

It was the third straight Pitt win and put the
seasonal mark at 3-3. Stars of the contest included
Halfback Henry Ford, Tackle Eldred Kraemer
and Quarterback Corny Salvaterra.

Credit, however, went to the Panther forward
wall which easily played its best game of the
season.

Salvaterra threw to Bugs Bagamery and Freddy
Glatz for touchdowns. Ford was the big ground
gainer especially in the ﬁnal touchdown drive, and
Kraemer played superbly at his tackle position.

Ends Pitt Streak, 26-0

Ohio State, the nation’s top team, showed the
Panthers exactly why they were rated so high by
blanking Pitt 26-0 at Columbus.

Trying for their fourth win, the Panthers
couldn’t match the faster, hard—charging Buck-
eyes and instead took a fourth loss.

Many Pittites thought the locals had a good
chance for another upset and traveled to Colum-
bus for the game, but the Big Ten champs were
too much.

It was the ﬁrst defeat for the Panthers under
Interim Coach Tom Hamilton.

OSU scored once in each quarter with Quarter-
back Dave Leggett and Halfback Bobby Watkins
being the leaders in all the Buckeye upri5ingS~ Tom Jenkins, Pitt fullback, slams in from side to down Dave Leggett, OSU quarterback.

A sellout crowd of 82,000, largest to watch the
Panthers this season, looked on as Coach Woody
Hayes’ charges swept through their seventh con-
test.

The Pitt loss was the 13th in the all—time series
with the Panthers having won four times, tied
once.

 

Bobby Watkins, hard running OSU back, sails over Pitt
defenders to score from one—yard line.

Bouncing back from the Ohio State loss, the Pitt
Panthers went out to Lincoln, Nebraska to defeat
the Huskers, 21-7.

Coach Hamilton pulled a surprise in this game
by starting the second team with six sophs among
them, and the shock troops responded ably by
scoring two of the TD’s.

The first team also got into the act as center
Bob Ballock intercepted a pass and rambled over
for a six-pointer. Other scorers were Bugs Baga—
mery and Fullback Bob Grier.

Pitt was again the underdog in this tilt but
came out with their fourth win by dumping the
Big SeVen’s Orange Bowl candidate.

This left the all—time slate at 13-3-3 in favor of
the Panthers.

Laurels on the line in this game went to Tackle
Lou Palatella, End Bob McQuaide and End John
Paluck while playing well in the backﬁeld was
Corky Cost.

In the season ﬁnale at the Stadium, the Penn
State Lions invaded the Panther’s den for the
annual backyard scramble and as in the past two
years, Pitt went down, this time by 20-0.

The game was played in rain and mud that
made both running and passing hard. The Lions,
however, led by Don Bailey, plowed through for
three markers and held the Panther attack Well

In their last games for the Blue and.Gold were
14 seniors. Included were Co—captains Henry Ford

B. Brautigam, D. Duessel, B. Lazor, J. Riser, E. Pavlick.

If the third time is the charm, then Panther hoop coach
Bob Timmons should be wearing a grin right about now
even though he just experienced a disappointing season in
his second year as head basketball coach.

VVhen Timmons took over Pitt’s basketball fortunes in
the 1953-54 campaign, he was faced with a major rebuild-
ing job. That year ran fairly true to form with the Blue
and Gold winning nine while dropping 14.

At the start of this past season, Timmons was keeping
his ﬁngers crossed and hoping for the best. After a poor
start which saw them losing their ﬁrst four games, the
Panthers caught ﬁre and notched ﬁve of their next six
contests.

Just when it looked like they might make a real season
of it, the Timmonsmen slacked off and were never quite
able to regain their winning form. As a result, they posted
a just—fair season log of 10-16.

Faced with this, Timmons has begun looking forward to
next season when he will have the pick of a freshman squad
which nailed up a 14-2 chart~0ne of the best frosh records
for many years.

To go along with the coming frosh, the Panthers will
have some good talent among the present sophomores~

year. Thus, it looks like Timmons may ﬁnally begin to

Fenwick makes a beautiful lay—up in Tech game.

Of course, one happy note for the Panther fans all season
was the record—breaking performances of Captain Ed Pav-
lick who smashed four Pitt scoring records during the
course of the campaign.

The 6-3 Johnstown Catholic hoopster reached his peak
when he crumpled Charley Hyatt’s career mark of 913
points in the ﬁnal contest of the season against Penn State.
Going into that game, Pavlick needed 15 points to eclipse
Hyatt’s mark and before the ﬁnal tally was in he had
garnered 31 to set the new standard at 929.

Another highlight of the Blue and Gold campaign,
though not winning—wise, was when they-went on a 4000-
mile trip which took them to Army, Navy, Tampa, Vliami
(Florida), and Puerto Rico.

The jaunt to Puerto Rico marked the first time a Pitt
basketball team has traveled outside the continental
United States. While there, the Jungle Cats split even in
two contests with the Islanders.

Also scoring well for the Panthers were the two soph
starters, Riser and Lazor. Riser, the 6-4 \Vasl1ington prod-
uct, was second in scoring for the locals with just less than
a 14 points per game average. He also teamed with Lazor
and Pavlick to give the Panthers their rebound strength.

Lazor, the 5-5 center from Canonsburg High was the
third leading point-maker with an average of just under
twelve tallies per game.

Besides Pavlick, the only other graduating cagers were
starter Joe Resutek, also from Johnstown Catholic, and
reserve center Dave Duessel of Peabody Higl .

Appearing for the ﬁrst time as a Varsity sport, Coach Leo
Bemis’ booters amazed the soccer world by turning in a
spectacular 8-1 record.

Upset only by Grove City, the Bemismen routed such
name soccer schools as Franklin and Marshall, Denison,
and Slippery Rock (twice), as well as Ohio State, a Big
Ten power.

As a testimony to the ﬁne showing the booters made,
ﬁve of them made the All—PennsylVania, Delaware, and
New Jersey soccer team. Placed on the ﬁrst team was star
goalie Don Clark, while high—scoring center John D’Amato
and defensive bulwark Mike Culhane were placed on the
second team. Fullbacks Norm Zanardelli and Phil Rogers,
and lineman Ted Phillips made honorable mention.

Only three members of this year’s squad will be lost
through graduation and with several ﬁne prospects com-
ing up from the freshman squad, another winning season
looms for the booters next autumn‘ Franklin—Marshall goalie prevents Pitt score.

Done in the style of the country’s greatest era, this room of
Polish sentiment points out Poland’s contribution to world
culture. Like the Polish castle of Wawel above the valley of
the Vistula, this room is the product of Polish artistry com-
bined With Italian Renaissance inﬂuences.

Also from this age of the ﬁfteen—hundreds is the large Jagiel-
lonian Globe, made to function as a globe, clock and calendar.
Presented to Pitt by the Polish National Alliance, it is an en-
largement of the ﬁrst globe showing the American continent
after its discovery.

To the left of the globe and embedded in the wall is the cor-
nerstone from a Gothic collection at the Jagiellonian University
in Krakow, reminding the observer that for ages education has
been important to constructive thought.

The large oil portrait is of the famous astronomer Coperni-
cus, shown as a young man observing the night sky. His faith
in the Solar Theory demonstrates one man's dedication to an
idea in spite of public scorn.

Windows of blown glass rondels like those in ancient Wawel
Castle are set with the coats of arms from Polish technical
schools and universities. Light bluegreen and yellow tints
bring color to the oak woodwork and the walnut furniture. The
diffused light brightens the beams overhead painted with the
verve of Polish spirit, a spirit that has made the story of Poland

an e ic of coura e thou ht and action.

Coach Carl Olson’s cross—country team had another ban-
ner year in 1954 as they ran their dual meet win streak to
17 in recording their second straight unbeaten season.

Paced by the great running of Arnie Sowell, who failed
to ﬁnish in ﬁrst place only once, the Olsonmen ran to vic-
tories over such highly—regarded schools as Army, Villa-
nova, Penn State and Manhattan.

They also ﬁnished second in the IC4A’s at New York
and were in the top ten at the NCAA’s in East Lansing,
Michigan.

Captained by Allan Gunderson, Coach Olson referred
to his runners as one of the most spirited and determined
teams he had ever coached.

Four of the starting seven were sophomores. They were
Jim Moore, Jack Schubert, Tom Jessup, and Thorton
Smith. The other starter was veteran Bob Cherry.

Sowell, former Schenley High School great, added an-
other laurel to his running feats in the Penn State meet
when he covered the Schenley Park trail in 26:43.7, the
fastest ever run over the ﬁve—rnile course.

The Olsonmen never faltered during the season although
the inexperience of the Blue and Gold was expected to be a
telling factor when they met the eastern powers.

The 1954-55 edition of Coach Ben Grady’s swimming team
climaxed a brilliant 7—4 dual meet season by scoring a
sweeping victory in the Eastern Intercollegiate swimming
championships.

Routed by Colgate in their opener, the Blue and Gold
mermen ﬁnished strong, winning their last three meets and
beating such powers as Rutgers, Lehigh, and City College
of New York in scoring their fourth consecutive eastern
triumph.

The ﬁne season was a result of team effort as evidenced
in the Easterns. Everyone of the Panther’s eightman squad
took home at least one medal. Jim Zurcher won both the
220 and 44o—yard freestyles while Skip Monsein captured
the IOO and 2oo—yard backstroke events. Warne White
took ﬁrst in the individual medley to cap oﬂ’ the individual
performances.

These winners then combined with Bill Furrer, Roy
Kaupe, and Hank Zentgraf to win both the medley and
freestyle relay events.

Divers Ralph Gaetano and Bert Marks also added
points for the Panthers and an unprecedented fourth tri-
umph was in the bag.

Although they split even in their first four encounters,
Coach Rex Peery’s grapplers posted another banner year
in 1955 as they swept past the remaining seven opponents
on the schedule to record a 9-2 dual meet slate.

Generally, 1955 was lookedon as a rebuilding year for
the Panther matmen who lost four stalwarts from the pre-
vious campaign.

But with determination and hard practice to augment
the ﬁne coaching of Peery, the sophomore—laden wrestlers
garnered wins over such powers as Michigan State, Lock
Haven, Illinois‘, and Penn State. The two losses came at
the hands of Lehigh and Michigan.

In addition to their ﬁne seasonal chart, the Blue and
Gold finished first in the Eastern Intercollegiate VVrestling
Association tournament for the second successive year and
third in the grueling National Collegiate Athletic Asso-
ciation classic.

Competing oﬂicially in intercollegiate gymnastics for the
first time this year, Pitt compiled a record of one win and
ﬁve losses.

Lacking the poise so vital in the sport and which can be
gained only through experience, the Panthers nevertheless
were good enough to put up good showings against such
veteran teams as Navy and Penn State and to defeat Notre
Dame.

Coach Warren Neiger’s proteges opened the campaign with
four straight away meets, traveling to Navy, West Virginia,

Notre Dame, and the Chicago Extension of the University
of Illinois.

ing, ﬁnishing just ahead of Kennedy and Don Shima.

WOMEN’S
RECREATION

ASSOCIATION

An active campus group, the Women’s Recreational Asso-
ciation is composed of girls eager for fun and fellowship
through individual and group sports.

The program of WRA provides for a‘ variety of activi-
ties for the enjoyment of its members. The group jour-
neyed to Oglebay Park for a weekend of camping and.cook-
outs. A co—recreational night was held at the Field House
where boys and girls got together for games of volleyball
and badminton. Such events as hockey games and swim-
ming parties were also enjoyed by the members.

In the fall, a party for freshman women was held in the
Cathedral gym where the freshmen came together for fun
through participation in various games. WRA also spon-
sored many tournaments throughout the freshman phys-
ical education classes.

There were two innovations added to the WRA program
this year. The group sponsored a basketball tournament
among the various women’s organizations on campus.
Sororities and interest groups alike joined in the competi-
tion for the basketball trophy. Fencing was introduced to
“AW Come °“ in; “,5 "°‘ Very Cold", the program to give a more well—rounded background of
physical activities to the members.

Through active participation in WRA, any woman en-
rolled in the University has the opportunity for fun, frolic
and the improvement of her abilities in sports.

INTRAMURALS

By providing a program of athletics, the Intramural Divi-
sion of the Athletic Department maintains the finest form
of wholesome recreation throughout the school year.

The Intramural program, under the direction of Leo C.
Bemis, covered a ﬁeld of 19 different sports.

Pitt retained the city IM crown in football as Phi Delta
Theta beat Duquesne’s champion, 6-0, for the second year
in a row. The Newman Club was the runner-up in touch—
football.

In team competition Theta Chi fraternity took the
wrestling crown. Delta Tau Delta came in ﬁrst in bowling,
and in badminton it was Sigma Chi that copped the
honors.

Basketball began in the Field House in December, 1954
with 56 teams entered in the Various leagues—frat, pro-
fessional, independent, engineering, club, and all-star. The
Johnstown Jets, who were in the runner-up position last
year, again were in the competition for top laurels.

Because of intra—school interest, fencing became a part
of the sports calendar when a fencing club was formed.

The Intramural program at Pitt afforded competition
for all and was an opportunity offered to those students
who lacked time to participate in inter-collegiate athletics.

Is holding hands a new rule for playing basketball?

CHEERLEADERS

This year for the first time in Pitt’s one hundred and
siXty—eight years, the provocative forms of women cheer-
leaders joined the male line of excited pep—rousers. The
boys have always worked hard before and did much to
keep the school spirit of Pitt football fans—win or lose.

Nevertheless, the introduction of women cheerleaders
did much to spark enthusiasm in the Pitt cheering section.

Although there were mixed emotions about having co-
eds do their bit for Pitt, ﬁnal approval was granted and the
girls began practicing the time—honored songs and chants
that have carried Pitt football heroes to countless Victories
and have made the Pitt Panthers a great team to be
reckoned with—and now the women have added to Pitt
football color and sparkle.

According to Chet Zukowski, head cheerleader, “co-
operation during the year was beautiful.” The co—eds
worked Very hard to justify the majority of the student
body who decided in a popularity poll that Pitt should
have women cheerleaders.

Cheerleaders during the football season included: Chet
Zukowski, Bus. Ad., ’56; Herb Rebhun, Bus. Ad., ’55; Al
Katz, Col., ’56; Ron Rothaus, Col., ’57; Dorothy Tear,
Col., ’57; Thelma Ackerman, Col., ’56; Ginny Anthony,
Ed., ’55; and Pauline Markess, Col., ’56.

Members of the Pitt gymnastic team, Jim Mulvihill,
VVill Stanz, Joe Ray, Don Shima, and Joe Lamartine
worked with the leaders and performed between cheers.

Most prominent feature of the room is the fresco of a Lith-
uanian painting interpreted by the Ciurlionis Art Gallery’s

director:

“The trees are Lithuanian forests, which cover a dark and
uncertain past. Among the branches are stars, points of hope.
Against this uncertain background stand two kings. One
holds something very bright, ajewel, which the other guards
with his sword. In comparison with the glimmer of the stars
the light which this object gives off is very beautiful. In the
center of the light is a Lithuanian village—thatched cot-
tages, white birches, willows—the most precious possessions

of Lithuania.”

Within the serene and picturesque surrounding of the Commons Room,

Everyone joins together for a group
dance at the Freshmen Ball.

      
 

The Freshmen held their annual dance in Carnegie Music Hall.

“My isn’t that music smooth to dance to.”

At intermission the half time entertainment is livened by a chorus of “Mr. Sandman.”

The gymnasts from Sweden performed before a packed Pitt Field House.

A perfect full turn is executed on the horizontal
bar by one of the Swedish gymnasts.

These students ﬁnd time to catch a quick snack while studying for ﬁnals.

      
     

Pitt students moved slowly through most
pre—1-egistration lines.

Radiating a sensitive but solid beauty, the Romanian Room
shows the subtle fusion of the Byzantine with the culture of
Rome. It is dominated by many details of the two Christian
churches which are very close to the faithful Romanian.

The entrance is through an archway of monumental propor-
tions. The words of the poet Vasile Alecsandri are chiseled
above the door: “The Romanian is like the mighty rock which
amidst the waves of the stormy and majestic sea, forever re—
mains unmoved.” This evaluation is a sympathetic tribute to a
people whose greatest attribute is the power of indomitable
resistance.

Created in vibrant glazes, a magniﬁcent mosaic brightens
the wall with brilliantly contrasting colors. It was made by a
Bucharest ceramist and depicts a Romanian prince refusing to
recant Christianity even to save his family.

Dark oak furniture contrasts with smooth walls and the pink
marble floor. Chair backs are the results of meticulous carving
by peasant artists using small knives to achieve the intricate
effects.

A Romanesque arch divides the window from the room with
a folding gate designed in delicate—looking wrought—iron. The
alcove suggests an icon shrine, common to Romanian homes.

Handmade translucent glass softens the sunlight which
bathes the room in a quiet glow. The total effect is dramatic

beauty intensiﬁed by a wisdom dedicated to the glory of God.

In the very beginning, when Pittsburgh was only a cluster of cabins at the
Point, two dreams stirred its soul—a splendid, surging materialism, and a yearning
for cultural growth. That these two have achieved a happy symbiosis is brilliantly
expressed today in the Cathedral of Learning.

0 It could have been a temptation, in this town of teeming potentialities,
to concentrate solely on the practical. Wealth always burgeoned here—in farm
products, coal, iron, glass, oil, and steel. Any man with horse—sense and a right
good will to work, could wrest a fortune from the wilderness, seemingly overnight.

0 This city was singularly blessed though, by the quality of the people who
came here in search of a fuller life. They recognized early a need for the specialized
type of training our industries would require. But they wished, for their sons and
daughters, much more than this. With William Penn they believed that "good
and commendable learning is to be preferred before wealth.”

O A succession of such great inen———founders, trustees, chancellors, teachers,
and alumni——have steered our university’s destiny from the log cabin Academy
of 1787 to the Cathedral of today. Under their vigil has grown up a special type of
university that marries, in its wide curriculum, both the cultural and the practical.
The Cathedral of Learning, itself a uniquely American architectural expression,
is a symbol of a uniquely American type of education.

0 Also uniquely American was the early development of the food manu-
facturing business. For more than three generations we have been preparing
ready-to—serve delicacies to save the time and eﬂfort of America’s housewives.

Characteristic of the people who created it, the Swedish Room
is charming and inviting. Styles common to Sweden before
America’s foundation make this room as homey as a northern

cottage.

The walls are constructed of handmade bricks two hundred
years old and covered with twenty coats of whitewash. The
whiteness adds a richness of texture and becomes a base for

the painted decorations which are the room’s ﬁnest features.

On the sloping ceiling are painted ﬁgures representing Jur-
tice, Judgment, and the ﬂngel Gabriel. The architect describes
the signiﬁcance of the room’s rear mural: “Three of the four
panels, framed in rich ﬂoral ornament of the style, depict three
gay cavaliers riding out into the world. St. Catherine occupies
the fourth panel. No ordinary horsemen, these! They are the
Three Wise Men riding down to Bethlehem to see the Baby

Jesus.”

A projecting ﬁreplace dominates one wall. A Pittsburgh
blacksmith modeled the wrought—iron ﬁre tools from the pair

he remembered from his Swedish childhood.

Of oak stained to a dark slate, the furniture blends harmoni-
ously with the paintings. A small cabinet inserted in the wall
contains the classroom committee’s bound archives and a col-
lection of interesting books on Sweden. Complementing the
benches is a ﬂoor of red brick. All together, the Swedish Room
is a place where goodfeeling and friendship naturally seem to

belong.

the servant of industry

Refractories conﬁne and control the productive ﬁres of indus-
try—the furnace ﬁres that separate iron, copper and other
metals from their ores, that melt the batch for making glass,
that turn water into superheated steam for power generation
and that make possible virtually all manufacturing operations.

The refractory brick of many kinds from which industry’s
furnaces are built must fulﬁll exacting service requirements
that vary widely in different app1ications—for example, the
conditions which refractories must withstand in iron blast fur-
naces are entirely different from those in glass melting furnaces
or in cement kilns. Through engineering and research, Har-
bison-Walker continues to develop refractories that meet the
widely different furnace needs and has kept abreast of con-
tinually changing demands of industry.

Whatever the furnace conditions may be, Harbison-Walker
can furnish the types and classes of refractories that will prove
most economical and give longest service.

Here the serenity of Old China informs all who are struck with
the room’s expression of wisdom that “Humility of Mind goes
with Loftiness of Character.”

Infused with the culture of Old Peiping, the tasteful blend-
ing of vivid colors with ornate designs of Chinese art make an
exotic contrast to the rich ﬁnish of the teakwood chairs and the
skillfully carved “Moon Table.” Directly above the seminar
table a golden dragon, symbol of nature and the universe, is
recessed in a ceiling of dazzling gold and blue squares, each sig-
nifying one ideal of a scholar’s life.

On the large slate Wall—tablet is the ﬁgure of the great teacher
Confucius, Whose principles epitomize Chinese philosophy and
contemplative thought.

Leaded Windows of frosted glass exclude the Western World,
strengthening the meditative spirit of this eastern civilization.
The radiator is masked with a grille of teakwood set with rose-
colored marble. Choice porcelains from China are placed in
front of the Windows.

Inscriptions in Chinese characters on the stonework and
overhead beams enhance the room’s oriental quality. They
signify ancient virtues that the Chinese have strived to develop
through Work and study. Sincerity, courtesy, integrity and
modesty are idealistic goals exemplifying man’s need for self-
improvement.

Totaled, these symbols of wisdom and prosperity wish those
who enter the Chinese Room for knowledge only happiness

and success.

INTERESTING FACTS

The 1955 Owl was started in June of 1954.. Editor Jack
Caldwell, Associate Editor Paul Gilliland, Tom Vrana,
photo editor, Business Manager Alan Skirboll, and Publi-
cations advisor Dr. Donald E. Swarts journeyed to the
printers in Buffalo, New York, to “talk yearbook.”

At this first meeting, the theme of the book was dis-
cussed and decided upon as “The World At Pitt.” A motif
and artwork were decided upon which would compliment
this theme. The type face that was picked was Caslon,
10 point for body type, 8 point for the captions and
twenty—four point capitals for the heads. Also chosen was
the paper stock which was -100 pound Celekote for the
body of the book and IOO pound Saxony for the Nation-
ality Rooms.

These rooms are used as class rooms 14, hours each day,
and are the only rooms of their kind in existence.

The four-color pictures of the Nationality Rooms were
taken by Jack Caldwell and Tom Vrana in September. The
copy was written by Don Miller. The pictures were taken
with a Speed Graphic and shot on Eastman’s daylight
ektachrome color ﬁlm. The printing was done by Wm. 
Keller’s offset lithography process known as Velvatone.

421

This yearbook contains the ﬁrst color—photography re-
productions of these rooms ever to be printed. Commer-
cially, the original ﬁlm transparencies of the rooms are
valued at 5000 dollars.

The book met heavy deadlines in December, January,
and February. Finally the last deadline was sent to the
printer on March 25.

The photography was done entirely by students with
the exception of the senior and underclassmen portraits
and a few of the formal group shots.

This is the second year that the Owl is including a sum-
mer supplement. This i6—page addition is prepared by the
new editor and his staﬂf in the spring of the year. It covers
all of the spring events and also gives the new staff a
chance “to get their feet wet” before the graduating mem-
bers leave the school.

The end—pages of the book are a photograph of the main
Pitt campus taken from the roof of the Ruskin apartments.

The sale of the book was raised from 1200 sales last year
to 1500 sales this year. The book was completely sold out
by the middle of March. The total number of printed
pages in the book amounted to 448, the largest Pitt year-
book to date.

THANKS . . .

An editor with an idea is nothing Without the support of his staff. The 1955 Owl has
been a success, and you, the staff, have made it so. Without your encouragement,
help and advice, my senior year would surely have been a headache. I’d like to
thank all of you.

Long hours of effort went into the formulation of the book. Al did a tremendous
job of ﬁnancing the Owl and running the business staff. Paul, my right hand man,
kept the humor high in the oﬂice with wit and joking, helped lay out the book, and
seemed to know the right answers and how to raise my spirits when they got a
little low. Mark was Al’s number one assistant and did a good job of smoothing
things out. Tom did such a terriﬁc job of taking pictures that I can hardly thank
him enough. Bobbi did such a ﬁne job of organizing that I needed only to ask her
when she would have her work ﬁnished; she did the rest. Georgia put a lot of time
into organizing the literary staff. Don wrote the Nationality Room copy along with
other parts of the book, truly, the ﬁnest Writing I have ever seen from a student.

Joe did his usual top—ﬁight job on his fraternities section and managed to make
me crack a smile no matter what happened. Paul Masoner found the going a little
rough at ﬁrst, but did a good job and came through with a ﬁne section. Lois also
asked few questions and went ahead and put her section together with comparative
ease. Betty tackled the sorority section and did a really eﬂicient job; she always
had a smile for everyone. Ginny, too, did such an exceptional job of organizing
that her pages seemed to come in right and left almost by themselves. Barbara took
hold of the classes section and did such a terriﬁc job that I know whoever takes her
place is going to have a hard time trying to surpass her. Addie practically lived with
a typewriter in front of her, truly one of the most faithful staff members. Betty
Ann wrote, typed, organized, proofed and did whatever needed immediate atten-
tion, always doing better than that which could be asked for. Leo went out and con-
tracted organizations until I wondered if the book would burst at the seams with
pages. Mazie teamed up with Eleanor Wiggins, not pictured, and chased down all
the events that took place at school and made sure a photo-assignment was made.
They did a good job of compiling a very interesting section.

Help within the University came not only from students. Iwould like to thank
Dean Theodore Biddle, Mrs. Agnes Starrett, Mr. Fran Prey, Mrs. Ruth Crawford
Mitchell, and Mr. Thomas Jarrett. Mr. Jarrett on more than one occasion advised
Tom and myself on photography and was always willing to help us.

I would like to extend my gratitude and thanks to the book’s printer, Wm. 
Keller Inc. Mr. Donald Messinger, Mrs. Jewell M. Gates, and the rest of the staff
did a beautifully interpretive job on the book, making it say what we Wanted it to
say. They were also quick with tremendous suggestions and easily understood my
occasional unconventional practices in editing a yearbook.

The beautiful cover on this book is the work of the S. K. Smith Co. Ralph Benz
was eager and helpful in helping me plan the cover.

I would like to thank Mr. Sam Fields from Delma Studios for his ﬁne service to
the yearbook, and Johnny Gaudiosi and Whit Delaplane who took the pictures.

The man who was always there to turn to and who always had the right answer
was Dr. Donald Swarts, my adviser. I’ll never be able to thank him enough for his
kindness, help, and instructions which have enabled me to complete the ’55 Owl
and to better prepare myself for eventualities after graduation.

I'd now like to thank my parents for putting up with their son who came home
at almost any hour during the night. They saw me occasionally at breakfast and
on weekends.

To the many I have not named, I would like to thank you all for your loyal help.

I sincerely hope that whoever succeeds me will be fortunate enough to ﬁnd as
cooperative a staff as the one that not only made the ’55 Owl a success, but that
gave something of themselves to insure a ﬁtting tribute to their University.

AMLE REEK ROOM

w:

Greece’s ancient past is reborn with classic splendor in this
seminar room. The ﬂuted purity of the two Ionic columns
carved in Athens is identical with the marble of the Acropolis.
They characterize the nobility of a people whose zeal for per-
fection and democracy formed the destiny of the Western

World.

Floor and wall siding are of two varieties of Greek marble.
Their cool color contrasts with the warm rose terra cotta of the
plastered walls. The frieze is decorated with blue and red ro-
settes touched with gold leaf, a red fret and a lustrous egg and
dart band which join the coffered ceiling of eighty recessed
squares. Each is painted deep blue and emblazoned with a
sunburst and bordered with a moulding of white and poly-

chrome.

The glorious color typiﬁes the tones used by the ancients to
decorate homes and temples. Here the Age of Pericles is seen
as it was over two thousand years ago when Greek art, litera-

ture, hiloso h and statesmanshi were su remef
P P Y P P

White oak furniture decorated with graceful gilded carvings
is designed from ancient manuscripts. The chairs bear names
close to Greek hearts—names of islands in the Aegean, of

Socrates, Plato and Aristotle.

Pastiand present meet in the columns’ portico effect, sof-
tened by the sunlight from curtained windows. In its perfect
arrangement the Greek Room demonstrates Man’s pure no-

bility of purpose.

E COTTISH ROOM

34

A natural dignity and reverence for learning strengthen the
humor and poetry in this room of seVenteenth—century Scot-
land. In this period of the first Scottish settlement in Pennsyl-
vania, great emphasis was placed on religion, freedom and com-
mon sense for the disciplined individual. This solid philosophy
of Scottish education gives the room a down—to—earth stability,
relieved by the quiet inﬂuence of Scottish candor.

All the woodwork is imported and, like the furniture, is
specially carved with time—honored details. The folding doors
of the blackboard and the overmantle are carved with the
names of well—known Scotsmenz Boswell, Livingstone, Steven-
son, Watt and others.

From Edinburgh comes the pithy saying above the black-
board: “Gif ye did as ye sould ye might haif as ye Would.”

Designed from an iron coronet dropped on the battleﬁeld
of Bannockburn in 1314, the chandeliers add rustic attractive-
ness to the stout nobility of the impressive room.

The sandstone ﬁreplace with the oil portrait of Robert Burns
is surmounted with the cross of St. Andrew. Bronze statuettes
of Sir William Wallace and Robert the Bruce, famed national
heroes, ﬂank the portrait.

Circling the room is a frieze utilizing the many symbols of
Scottish clans. The frieze and the thistle moulding on the ceil-
ing——emblem of Scottish unity—signify the pageant of strong

Scottish Wills and wit joined for mutual betterment.

THE GOSLAV ROOM

Picturing a wealth of past heritage, the Yugoslav Room ex-
presses the Vital unity of different people having something
in common. A digniﬁed atmosphere ﬁlls the room with a sense

of earthy serenity.

Ceiling and Walls are paneled with coﬂfee—colored Slavonian
oak. Slavonic heart designs are carved into the panels, bordered
with geometric motifs. Called “notch” carving, the Work was
done by peasants using penknives alone. The oak ceiling is in-
cised with folk patterns. Knobbed chandeliers are modeled on

those in the Belgrade palace.

A special panel on one wall displays the crest of three state
universities——-the double—headed eagle signifying the union of

the East and West in Yugoslavia.

A large case and closed cabinets contain an exquisite lace
Madonna handmade by two Slovenian women and works on
science and literature, as well as a ﬁne collection of many kinds
of stylized needlework. In the foreground are the cleft—backed

student chairs, designed in Zagreb.

Six portraits of historical ﬁgures hang above the wall pan-
eling. Each man’s life reveals a force that strengthened the na-

tion, making it a union of varied differences.

This mixed culture makes Europe southeast of the Danube a
colorful blending of various dialects, Writing styles and re-
ligious inﬂuences. Alive today these mingling streams have
coalesced into a nation searching its crossroads for a better

future.

ROOM

3%

Rough—hewn, but obviously strong and serviceable, the Early
American Room reproduces in authentic detail a home in New

England about 1650.

Pine beams, all over a hundred years old, over the ﬁreplace
and in the ceiling show that the room was a good shelter against
the weather as well as hostile Indians, great problems of seven-
teenth century Americans. The woodwork, table and benches

are also of century—old pine.

The ﬁreplace is constructed of old handmade bricks and has
a baking oven deep in one wall. Cooking utensils hang from
iron cranes: a trivet, wal-He iron, skewers, ladles, and to one
side, an old-fashioned bellows. Above the hearth the long

wooden arm was used for drying clothes in colonial times.

Near the bellows is a secret panel. VVhen touched at a cer-
tain spot, the panel springs back showing a narrow staircase
that winds above the ﬁreplace to a loft upstairs used as an

early protection against Indian marauders.

A sampler by the door tells of the room’s presentation by
George Hubbard Clapp to Pitt “in recognition of the austere
dignity of Roger Clap,” who came to Massachusetts in 1630.
Dr. Clapp, president of the Board of Trustees at Pitt for more

than ﬁfty years, was a direct descendant of the early settler.

The heroic beginning of United States history is reflected

in this humble room of homey strength.

THE

RISH ROOM

4.0

Unfurnished at time of printing, the Irish Room revives Ire-
land’s “Golden Age,” 6oo to 1200 A.D. Like the small chapels
of early missionaries, the room is typically Irish—Romanesque.

Traditionally, the ceilings of these ancient chapels were
beamed With rough—hewn oak. Walls Were made of oddly
carved limestone. This small seminar room recaptures these
features with Gaelic whimsy.

Rich ornamental carving is used in running motifs~mostly
down—pointing chevrons and intricate beading. Corner pilas—
ters, creating the door’s archway, have capitals of fanciful
faces projecting from a border of unusual plants and animals.
This low relief stonework is also found bordering the arches
above the windows, blackboard and wall bench.

Student seats of oak andrawhide will be placed around a
great central table.

Most signiﬁcant object in the room is the cornerstone. Earth
from north and south of Ireland is sealed Within this relic from

the ruins of the old lrish abbey Clonmacnoise.

Medieval wisdom is revitalized in this room of Gaelic charm.

The inspiration for the Nationality Rooms
developed from the dynamic personality of
Dr. John Gabbert Bowman, who as chancel-
lor conceived the brilliant plan of showing
the world what the impact of the peoples of
Pittsburgh meant in creating a great uni-

Versity.
In further adding to the startling ingenu-
ity of the plan for the Nationality Rooms, Dr. Rufus H. Fitzgerald

Dr. Rufus H. Fitzgerald has recognized the ’
great beneﬁt the rooms’ message can bring
to students by increasing their knowledge of
others, that they might become more toler-
ant Americans.

Constructive momentum for selecting and
supervising the ideals embodied in the Na-
tionality Rooms is tirelessly radiated by the
dedicated work of Mrs. Ruth Crawford Mit-
chell, who not only created works of surpass-
ing beauty, but established bonds uniting
Pittsburgh with the nations represented. Mrs. Ruth Crawford Mitchell

Special mention goes to Mr. Albert A.

Klimcheck, University architect, who ac-
tually built the Nationality Rooms to the
exact speciﬁcations of each national artist,
insuring the best representation of national
cultures. His wish for authentic materials
and original masterpieces incorporated in
the designs has made the rooms genuinely
magniﬁcent.

VVithout support from Nationality Class-
room Committees in Pittsburgh and through— ML Albert A_ Klimcheck
out the world the rooms could never have be-
come a reality. These people, erecting monu-
ments to the ideals of their homelands, con-
tributed the inestimable effort and wealth
necessary for their ambitious gift to Pitt.

Their purpose ﬁlls each room with treasure
richer than wood or stone.

HE WORLD ZIT

A TRIBUTE To A UNIVERSITY DEDICATED
To TRAINING STUDENTS NOT ONLY

FOR A NATION, BUT FOR A WORLD

“VVe all realize that communications, transportation, and
war have brought the world closer together. Some have
had optimistic faith that closer relations might mean
better relations. There is now a growing conviction

that proximity will become an increasing menace to
humanity unless we can in some way bring about a
better cultural understanding between the citizens

S of different nations.”

—DR. RUFUS H. FITZGERALD, commencement

addreys at Westminxter College, 1954

MR. PITT AND MISS PITT

 

Now it is we who are graduating seniors. VVe leave Pitt,
the center of our lives and thoughts, and four fasci-
nating, wonderful years.

We of the Owl Staff have chosen ‘to honor a gradu-
ating man and woman as Mister and Miss Pitt. These
two students typify the ideals that a person may de-
velop who finds a keen interest in working for his school
and fellow students.

To be a part of Pitt is to be a part of the challenge of
difficult classes, the excitement of campus organi-
zations and athletics, and the fun and experience of
making and keeping friendships.

VVe may forget names of friends, but their hearty
spirit blends with Pitt sentiments to become a part of
us forever.

This deep feeling that we call being a part of the
“VVorld At Pitt” will generate in us the power to create
our own future in the unforeseen years ahead.

Of those among us, we have singled out Donald F.
Shanafelt and Barbara A. Douglas, who through their
abilities and development have shown themselves wor-
thy of the title Mister and Miss Pitt. They exemplify
what we believe Pitt has generated in us——personality,
leadership, and humanity.

THE COLLEGE

      

  

l)r. Stanton C.
Dezm

Largest of the schools and divisions at Pitt,
The College, founded in 1787, is one of the most
modern up—to—date liberal arts schools in the
United States.

Under the direction of Dean Stanton C.
Crawford, The College’s more than twenty-
three departments provide an extensive curric-
ulum, giving the student a general education in
many ﬁelds of interest.

In the exciting atmosphere of The College,
emphasized by the large student body and the
urban location of the Cathedral ofLearning, the
student has an excellent opportunity of learn-
ing what most interests him while developing
his interests in other ﬁelds of lasting value.

Individual selection may include major sub-
jects in the humanities, social sciences or nat-
ural sciences. Along with the customary sub-
jects of history, ﬁne arts and chemistry, The
College offers study in Chinese, creative writ-
ing, television and other unusual courses.

The student, with the aid of expert advisers,
may ﬁnd for himself the knowledge for be-
coming a citizen more fully aware of the world
about him.

DR. RUFUS H. FITZGERALD, CHANCELLOR

DEDICZITION

The Owl Staff of 1955 dedicates this record of the academic and
social world at the University of Pittsburgh to Dr. Rufus H.
Fitzgerald in grateful recognition of his leadership and wisdom.

During his ten years as chancellor, Dr. Fitzgerald initiated
many vital advances to the University’s reputation in national
affairs. Besides his great task of improving every segment of
the University’s world, Dr. Fitzgerald has maintained a direct
contact with students and has made their welfare his primary
interest.

In providing his students with the most progressive methods
of obtaining a better education, Dr. Fitzgerald has strength-
ened their capabilities for creating a better place for themselves
in the future.

His retirement ﬁlls us with a deeply—felt regret which is
hardly expressive of the University’s great loss. A phrase origi-
nating at the University of Iowa, Where Chancellor Fitzgerald
taught for many years before coming to Pitt in 1938, expresses
our feeling: “It is diﬂicult to realize that he isleaving. Even so,
what can be said except, ‘Thanks, Rufus H. Fitzgerald, for a
job Well done.’ ”

We of the Owl Staff wish Dr. Fitzgerald many happy years
in his retirement—years happy in a measure equal to the suc-
cess he acquired so modestly as a great chancellor for our Unié

versity.

A typical school scene is the students studying in the sixth ﬂoor library.

The basic purpose of Pitt’s School of Education
is the preparation of workers for the profession
of teaching and educational administration.
The school has many means to obtain this end.

The School offers four specialized courses of
study to the prospective teacher: Secondary
Education, Physical Education, Elementary
Education and Business Education. Not only
does the education student specialize in one of
the above ﬁelds, but he must also have two
years or 62 credits in liberal arts. This liberal
education gives the teacher a general back-
ground which is necessary in modern educa-
tional methods.

The school is careful in its selection of stu-
dents. It tries to choose students with the type
of personality and character that is necessary
in the guidance of youth.

Encouraging students to participate in extra-
curricular activities is another activity of the
School of Education. If a student is active in
school activities, it is probable that in his future
life he will be a good worker in the community.

The School of Engineering and Mines con— p

sists of eight departments and ofTers ten degrees .

two degree co-operative course is offered. Stu-  
dents spend three years in The College and
two in either the School of Engineering or the
School of Mines, thus allowing more time in the
ﬁelds of humanities and business.

The new building, completed this spring, is 
the latest improvement in the school’s long— i‘ 
range expansion program. The seven—story
building connects Thaw Hall and the old Mel-
lon Institute. Its engineering library and study
area have already proven both helpful and
convenient to students.
