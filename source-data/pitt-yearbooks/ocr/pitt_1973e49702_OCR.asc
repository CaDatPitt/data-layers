RESEARCH, a noun, taken from the French word
recherche. Webster defines the word as a “careful
search, or a studious inquiry; unusually critical
and exhaustive investigation having for it’s aim the
revision of accepted conclusions.” Ask any student
at Pitt today, and that is the type of answer that
you would expect. But when you mention research
at Pitt, after a little head scratching, most students
would draw a blank. The only possible contact a
student may have with any type of research would
be through an introductory course in Physics or
Chemistry. But sometimes that’s like trying to get a
drink of water out of a fire hose.

Despite the general lack of information about
research activities at Pitt, it does go on; to the tune
of several million dollars a year. This money is
obtained from such sources as the National Sci-
ence Foundation, private corporations, and the
University itself.

In December 1972, while students were busy stud-
ying for final exams, the Apollo program was rap-
idly coming to a close. On that Apollo 17 mission, a
solar wind experiment was deployed to detect the
presence of an atmosphere on the moon. What
Walter Cronkite didn’t tell you on television, was

that this particular experiment was developed in
part by Pitt’s Department of Atomic and Upper-
Atmosphere Physics, under the direction of Pro-
fessor Thomas M. Donahue. This study was done
in conjunction with the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration, NASA. As a result of their
work, it was discovered that there is no detectable
atmosphere on the moon.

For a more down to Earth example, another pro-
ject in this same department is studying the SST
(Super-Sonic Transport). This very relevant pro-
ject, sponsored in part by the Department 01
Transportation, is studying the effects of the SST
without building the plane. At present, the project
is in it’s third year, and will take another two years
to complete.

Physics and Engineering have had a tremendous
inﬂuence on man’s modern world. Work in these
two fields has contributed to man’s ability to con-
trol nature to an extent hardly imaginable fiftg
years ago. The idea behind this special researcl
section was to seek out the research activities cur-
rently under way at Pitt, and present them in a W113
in which the ordinary student without a PhD ir
Nuclear Physics could understand.

The principal facility of the Department of

Nuclear Physics is the two million dollar Van

der Graaff Accelerator. This device, which occu-

pies an entire building, shoots a stream of parti-

cles at a high rate of speed — about 20% the‘
speed of light. This “beam” of particles is then

aimed at a spectrometer, where the particles are ,
studied.

The Van der Graff project, which became opera-
tional in 1967, is headed by Dr. Bernard L.
Cohen. The project tries to make applications of ’
Nuclear Physics for technological uses. This is
done by a study of nuclear reactions — striking a
nucleus with particles, such as protons. Many-
other universities carry out similar types of
research, but each one operates on an independ-
ent basis.

Another basic aim of the Van der
Graaff project is the writing of papers
and research journals. This also
includes giving lectures and talks on
the subject of Nuclear Physics to var-
ious industries and universities.

The National Science Foundation
contributes about one-half million
dollars per year to the project, which
is staffed by Pitt faculty and graduate
students. Although operated by the
Physics Department, experiments are
also conducted by other departments
within the university.

One single experiment requires
twenty-four hours to be run, and
takes two weeks to analyze the
results. The experiments are con-
trolled by extensive associated hard-
ware, such as a PDP 15/40 computer
system with various input/output
devices. The actual control room
resembles a scene from mission con-
trol at Cape Kennedy.

In contrast to the research carried out in other
departments that seek practical applications
from their work, the Department of High Energy
Physics carries on research for the sake of
research. In other words, not much practical
knowledge is obtained. V\/hat is being done in
this department header by Dr. Wilfred E. Clel-
land, is to try and solve the puzzle of particles
from the E = mo? equation.

Many types of experiments and tests are
designed within the department, and then sent to
the Brookhaven Laboratory in New York. At the
proton aynchrotron located there, a beam of
protons is created and then observed. The basic
apparatus used by the group is a PDP-15 com-
puter, which detects the reaction products of
particle decay or high energy collisions.

The project is funded by a grant that lasts for
another two years, and partially by the federal
government.

For Dr. Myron P. Garfunkel, research at Pitt means dedica-
tion. Upon obtaining his PhD from Rutgers, Dr. Garfunkel
worked for eight years at the Westinghouse Research Lab.
He came to Pitt in 1959 to set up the Department of Low
Temperature Physics.

To the average person, the words “low temperature” mean
a chilly winter night, or at most a food freezer. In Dr. Gar-
funkel’s work, low temperature means within about one-
half of a degree from absolute zero. The absolute zero of
temperature has defied all attempts to reach it experimen-
tally, although it is possible to come arbitrarily close with
the use of liquid Helium. Although large quantities of liquid
Helium are used in experiments, at ten cents a liter,- it’s
cheaper than milk.

I22

VOLTAGEi 

Research in progress includes stud-
ies of absortion of microwaves in
superconductors, and the scatter-
ing of laser light in liquid Helium.
Superconductors are a special
class of metals with a very low
resistance at low temperatures.
Some of the more common metals
include Aluminum, Tin, and Zinc.

The major objective of Dr. Gar-
funkel’s work is to gain more
knowledge about superconductors,
that will eventually lead to practi-
cal applications. Work is also done
in conjunction with several Rus-
sian scientists, who meet with
members of the Physics depart-
ment at international conferences
to compare notes.

The project is funded by the
National Science Foundation and
the university. The actual work is
done by Pitt faculty members, PhD
students, and other graduate stu-
dents at Pitt.

In the field of Engineering
Research, work of a more practical
nature that is directly beneficial to
man can be found. In the Chemical
Engineering Department at Pitt,
work is being done on the develop-
ment and evaluation of implanta-
ble sensors. These sensors are
implanted in the human body for
continuous monitoring of dissolved
oxygen, hydrogen ions, and carbon
dioxide.

The project is headed by Dr. C. C.
Liu, and work is done with the
Cleveland Metropolitan General
Hospital. The basic objectives of
the project are the design, develop-
ment, construction, and testing of
the implantable sensors. Two prob-
lems that the group is working on is
the reactions between the biologi-
cal host and the sensor, and the
smallness that is required of the
sensor.

At present, Pitt is the only school
doing this type of work. The pro-
ject is funded in part by NASA,
and the Chemical Engineering
Department.

125

126

The human mind is still the common
denominator of any research effort,
despite the vast amounts of compli-
cated machinery that is used. N o matter
what new ingenious type of machinery
is used, the individual will still be the
initiator of new ideas, and the solver of
problems. Oftentimes, the name of the
individual is unknown, but he is there
and his contribution is evident.

Only a very small part of the research
activities at Pitt have been shown in
this section. Other types of research are
constantly going on in other areas of
Physics, Chemistry, Engineering, Math,
and Biological Sciences. Despite the
work that has been done and will con-
tinue to be done, the average person
will be unaware of the progress being
made in research at Pitt.

Another whole segment of research at
Pitt still has to be written — that of the
social and sociological implications and
impact upon man resulting from this
investment of time, money, and materi-
als. New history is being written almost
daily of research activities. This is quite
different from the impact that will be
felt from this new knowledge of the
cosmos, as well as the new knowledge
gained of man, himself.

The goal of the 1972 Homecoming was to involve as many students and interests as possible in the festivi-
ties. The events of Homecoming were expanded to include a barrel rolling competition, a banner and ﬂoat
contest and parade, a Howdy Doody Revival featuring Buffalo Bob, and a dance in the Towers which was
open to all students. A new tradition was started — The Blue and Gold Merit Award. Every year an under:
graduate student who has contributed the most to the University through their activities will be honored
and given a monetary award. Along with the new events, some old ones still remained. There was the tra-
ditional bonfire and pep rally, a concert featuring The Edgar Winter Group, Malo, and Nils Lofgren and
Grin. As a part of the tradition theme the title of Homecoming Queen replaced the Pitt Woman title from
the year before.

Doctor Albert Ellis, noted psychol-
ogist and author of over thirty
books and a native of Pittsburgh,
led off a three day conference on
alternative life styles. He discussed
the syndrome of sexual guilt and
frustration as applied to the Ameri-
can marriages today and intro-
duced some alternative to the
accepted life styles.

Homosexuality, communal living,
and celibacy were discussed dur-
ing the three day conference. Also
there were films, discussions, and
workshops dealing with related
subjects to the conference.

Engineer's Week!

162

If one were to search for a single word to
describe Engineer’s Week, it would have to
TRADITION. Good old Saint Patrick, the soap
box derby, the opening parade, all added up to a
week of fun and relaxation for the engineers at
Pitt.

V\/hat one doesn’t see behind all of the fun and

smiling faces, is the many hours of work and
planning that went into making the week even
happen at all.

Aside from the usual activities, “Airport” and
“Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid” were
shown to aid the engineer’s service project, that
raises money for the Western Pennsylvania
School for the Blind. The busy week of activities
concluded with the Shamrock Ball semi-formal
held at Churchill Valley Country Club, and the
joint Greek-Engineer’s Concert.

This year the Student Government Board’s main
emphasis was to centralize operations. By mak-
ing all purchases of equipment and supplies, it
_found that it could save the students money. The
Board also worked to coordinate the campus’
fnany programming groups, so that the cycle of
either too much or too little to do would not con-
tinue for another year. Now, because of the plan,
there is always something to do — something
good on campus.

The Student Government Board also managed to
have the $5 add-drop fee removed before it went
into effect. This, done in conjunction with meas-
ures to streamline registration, should go a long
way toward easing the problems faced by all
students during registration.

The board is also trying to improve intramurals
‘and athletics in general at Pitt. By working to see
that facilities are well-maintained and that intra-
_murals are given the high priority that they
_deserve, the Student Government Board is mak-
ing it possible — more than ever — for a student
to participate in a sport and have some fun.

It is also working to get a new Student Union.
Starting with its own Student Union Task Force,
the effort has blossomed into a new University
Committee mandated by the Chancellor. The
new Union is a high priority item at Pitt — and
the Board is working to help make the new
‘Union a reality.

Another activity of the Student Government is
to work toward better campus security and
brighten safely lit walkways around campus.
Security is fundamental and Student Govern-

ument is working to improve it.

Members of the Student Government and its
various committees are as follows:

LEGAL AWARENESS: Steve Baer, Diane
Reichwein, Chairpersons

‘For the Engineering Student
‘Cabinet, 1973 was a very busy
‘year. Although the year started
with a lot of new faces, this
‘brought about innovative
qdeas that enhanced the ability
of the Cabinet to succeed.

neer’s Week activities, such as

1FThefa Chi

We, the brothers of Theta Chi,
look back on our sixty-four
years at Pitt with a sense of
pride and accomplishment.

The chapter has kept up the
fine tradition of being prog-
ressive in all facets of frater-
nity life. Many of the recent
changes include: a Little Sister
program by which interested
girls can become an integral
part of the chapter’s social life,
a new shortened pledge pro-

gram which stresses under-
standing and involvement
rather than the traditional haz-
ing, and an increased empha-
sis on house improvement.

We feel the upcoming year
will be very promising
socially, athletically, and aca-
demically. We fully expect our
sixty-fifth year at Pitt to be as
rewarding as the past sixty-
four have been.

The sisters of Alpha Delta Pi don’t just “live for each other.” They also “live for”
or rather care about the rest of the world too. The sisters, both as individuals
and as a group, have demonstrated this caring by their active participation in
campus organizations and various charitable organizations. Again this year,
they showed friendship and concern through their Halloween Party for the Kids
at Iuvenile Court. And the proceeds from the two bake sales held in the Student
Union went to the school for the blind.

Individually, sisters are also involved in various campus activities such as, Pan-
hel, Magic Bus, Quo Vadis, Rush Counselors, and Women’s Choral.

We’re involved, we care — but we like to have fun too! The 50’s Party held in
the suite, 1001 Amos Hall, was a smashing success. A formal, held at Churchill
Valley Country Club was a very elegant and delightful affair.

Greek Week saw the AAH’s winning 1st place in the Chugging Contest (thanks
to HKA and A43) and in Pinochle; 2nd place in Greek Sing (thanks to I. P.); and
3rd place in the Tug-of-War. Our float wasn’t bad either!

We care, we have fun, we're involved — everything to plant some seeds of
friendship in the world.

Alpha Epsilon Pi offers
much to the commuter as

- well as the dorm resident.

We participated, this year,
in all intramural sports,
including a very success-
ful soccer season. AE Pi
held various parties and
social events, including
our annual Senior-Alumni
Banquet held this year at
The Top of the Towers.

We participated in all
Greek Week activities,
while placing second in
Pitt's version of the Indi-
anapolis 500 — the chariot
race. We also out thought
most Greeks with a mind
shattering third place in
the College Bowl.

Our fraternity offers the
Pitt student an active
social life, athletic compe-
tition, a chance to serve
the community, and the
satisfaction of having
more than thirty brothers.

Pitt Tri-Deltas have grown considerably in the past
year. We have doubled in size and have become even
more active in campus life. This year our Homecom-
ing Queen was a Tri-Delta, as were the Homecoming
Chairman and the Parents’ Weekend Chairman.

We served spaghetti dinners to raise money for our
scholarship Fund and joined Phi Kappa Theta in a
thirty-six mile Walk-a-Thon for the Kidney Founda-

tion. We also teamed with Delta Zeta to carve pump-
kins for the F alk Eye Clinic.

Our social functions included mixers, Christmas car-
oling; a hayride, the Barn Dance, and our annual
Winter Weekend. We’re proud to be one of the larg-
est, most active groups on campus.

“A whole is nothing more than the sum of many parts and so are
we . . . in Delta Zeta.”

To be united as individuals, to strengthen the bonds of
friendship, to strive for higher ideals which accompany
learning, and to seek for social understanding and enjoy-
ment are what Delta Zeta hopes to achieve throughout
every year.

This year, the sisters participated in a revived Homecoming
with the Phi Kap’s, a Christmas Dinner Dance at the Park-
way Pavilion, a successful Greek Week with the F iji’s, and
our Spring Formal at the Marriott. In an effort to promote
Greek harmony, we painted a football banner with the Chi
O’s, danced polkas with the HKA’s, carved pumpkins and
shared a standards meeting with the Tri-Delts, played foot-
ball with the Phi Delts, battled the Phi Kap’s in the snow,
and baked a Valentine’s Day cake for the Fiji’s.

Between upperclass and freshman rush, Delta Zeta gained
thirty new pledges to fill maximum quota. We kidnapped
the first group at 6:00 a.m. to serve them breakfast in the
suite and the second group was taken by surprise in the sen-
ior skit. Now, they are sisters too — ready to reach out to
new friends.

“To be, to live, to give . . . Delta Zeta.”

The sisters of Delta Phi Epsilon are bound together with love and
true sisterhood. This year we extended this feeling to the commu-
nity at large, working year round for our national philanthropy —
Cystic Fibrosis. We sold candles,-" collected for UNICEF during
Halloween, visited the School for the Blind, and collected for the
Greek Week Kidney Foundation Drive.

The feeling of love we have within our sisterhood was shared in
our Parents’-Alum Luncheon, Fall Dinner Dance, Homecoming
Weekend, and the highlight of the year — Greek Week. We are an
active part not only of the Greek system, but other groups as well.
Our sisters participate in CWENS, Quo Vadis, The Owl, and many
other organizations on campus. Scholarship is important to D Phi
E ,as can be seen by the high standards set by the girls in the soror-
ity. But fun is a priority as well. Our mixers, hot dog dinner, and
ice skating parties are what give Delta Phi Epsilon its life, love,
and warmth. To know a Deepher is to love one. This year has been
one full of excitement and activity for us of the Eta Chapter.

society is a primary goal of any university. A unique and desirable way of
achieving this goal is Zeta Beta Tau Fraternity.

ZBT has been a major fraternity on campus since 1962. Our house is
located at 4716 Bayard St. ZBT is well known for its scholastic achieve-
ment. In 1971 we were awarded the Chancellor’s Cup. This year, ZBT took
first place in Greek Sing and third place in Talent and Chariot competition.
A consistently strong showing in Greek Week has displayed our steady,
solid growth.

The principles that ZBT has dedicated itself to are social responsibility, fra-
ternalism, and integrity. There are many fraternities on campus but few
fulfill the goals of a true fraternity as ZBT does.

A fraternity is what you make of it just as your education is. We here at Kappa
Sigma realize our obligation to obtain an education, however, we make the
most out of our fraternity.

Our fraternity has a great social life consisting of numerous mixers, parties and
brother get-togethers. We have had a pig roast, wiener roasts, toga parties,
bowling tournaments, and visits to local entertainment spots. Through all the
fun, we never lose sight of our main goal which is to obtain the best education
we can. So, if you’re thinking about going Greek, think about us.

"Nof Four Years, Buf a Lifefime"

School year 1972-1973 was a very successful year for the Lemmels in all phases of
fraternity life. In sports, Pi Lam captured the softball championship and finished
third in IFC basketball. Socially, Pi Lam had a wide scope calender which was top-
ped off by our annual Winter Weekend at Lakeview Country Club. Pi Lams were

Brofherhood

Each of us

is different from the other.
One man’s weakness

may be your strength
while his strength

may be your weakness.
Thus

we need one‘ another.

The lonely need friendship
the sick need care

the feeble need support
the frightened, comfort

for man has many weaknesses
and many strengths.

It is this constant giving

of one’s self

and receiving from others

that brings happiness,

nothing more.

Iust as the pitcher which is emptied
and refilled

many times a day

remains sparkling

and gives the sweetest water.

Give then each day

a little of your time

your friendship

your sympathy

your understanding

even of your physical assistance
and what you get in return

. will brighten your life

a thousand ways.

And when you have done
all these things

you will have discovered
the true meaning

of Brotherhood.

The Brothers of Sigma Alpha Epsilon had
another outstanding year. We started in the Fall
taking a third place in Homecoming and posting
winning seasons in softball and football.

The winter term commenced with a very suc-
cessful rush, capped with an eleven-man pledge
class.

Another year of successful social events was
highlighted by our 60th Anniversary at Pitt. We
hosted an All-Greek mixer to celebrate this most
prestigious event.

As always the Sig Alphas continued their tradi-
tion of close-knit brotherhood.

EAE’s ability to excel showed again as we cap-
tured a first place in the College Bowl during
Greek Week and had two brothers, Stan Dupell
and Vic Wicburn inducted into the Order of
Omega which accepts only men of proven cali-
ber with outstanding devotion to fraternity.

Sigma Delta Tau represents sincerity, devotion, and true friendship.
Each girl finds herself and broadens her understanding of people

‘through Alpha Zeta chapter.

This year, the Sisters participated in various activities such as Home-
coming, Games People Play, and Greek Week, where we won two tro-
phies. Another facet of our chapter is helping others by collecting for

“the Kidney Foundation and visiting the Old Age Home.

Each year holds something new and exciting for the SDT’s!

The Oakland Zoo

On the fifth day, God said,

“Let the earth produce every kind
of living creature: cattle, reptiles,
and every kind of wild beast.”

And so it was.

God made every kind of wild
beast, every kind of cattle and
every kind of land reptile.

God saw that it was good.

PHI SIG is a challenge. Our goal is to build a true sisterhood where the needs of each person are
important. We’ve been on the Pitt campus since 1926 and we’ve always tried to be the kind of group
where people really count.

~Phi Sig is unique in that it is a small group of girls where each sister has the chance to be an important
part of everything we do. We can truly share in all the joys and sorrows that come our way, and
THAT’S what makes PHI SIG different from all the rest.

We come from different backgrounds, but we work well together as one unit, and our accomplish-

.ments during the past year show it! Not only did we win first place in the Greek Week Charity Drive, ‘

but we were awarded first place for a Cystic Fibrosis Charity Drive as well. More important than win-
ning was knowing we had worked together to benefit someone else.

Yearbooks are starting to die out in many
schools, both high schools and colleges. But why
they are dying out remains a mystery. Where
will one turn twenty or thirty years from now to
see what was happening in his or her school
years? How will one remember the styles of
dress, old buildings being torn down to make
way for new ones being erected, rock groups
that were once popular, their brothers and sis-
ters in fraternities and sororities? How will any-
one remember any of this plus anything else that
has special meaning to them if it were not for
yearbooks?

But at Pitt the answer is THE OVVL, and to
answer these questions and others is precisely
the purpose of this book. It has tried to show the
different sides of Pitt and its students in as many
pictures as possible. There is very little copy and
no particular theme. It is merely a record of
events, people and happenings that have occur-
red throughout this past year. With this book
one will be able to look back and see how life
styles have changed and whether the changes
have been good or bad.

This book was not done overnight, nor was it
done by any one person. It was the combined
effort of many people who not only worked
together but laughed and joked together. During
the Spring Session several persons had to work
on the book at home or travel some distance to
come and work at Pitt. Many members of the
staff had outside jobs and classes to attend, but
still the job was done. Let me now take some
time out to thank those who have helped me
throughout the year.

Paul Wasilko served as my Layout Editor and
right hand man. He made a forty-five minute
ride into Pitt one night every week to show me
the work he had done at home. He helped with
the Senior Section, typed the list of Parent
Patrons (which is pretty good for not knowing
how to type), checked over the work of all the
other editors, laid out the opening section and
research section, and above all, stayed with me
throughout the summer when practically every-
one else had gone. I couldn’t have finished the
book without his moral support and creative
ideas.

Thanks for everything, Paul, and I promise you
. . next year will be even more organized!

Sue Iarrett was my Associate Layout Editor.
Even though she wasn’t able to stay here and
work during the summer, she worked at home,
some two hundred fifty miles away. The divi-
ders for the various sections are Sue’s, as well as
part of the Senior Section.

Thanks Sue. I’ll see you in September when you
come back. Don’t forget to bring your legs.

Claudia Pelliccioni was my Associate Editor,
secretary and just about the cutest “Ms.” I’ve
ever seen. She typed countless letters of corre-
spondence for me and helped with many impor-
tant decisions. Most of all she had a smile that
just wouldn’t quit.

Thanks for everything, Claud, and I’ll be seeing
you next year too. Maybe you’ll get your Ferrari
by then.

Louise Lutian was Events Editor. Having only
started in Ianuary she had a hard time tracking
down events from first term. She stayed
throughout the summer and went to classes too,
but somehow she gother section done.

Thanks Louise. I won't be seeing you next year,
so good luck in the future, H.Y.B.?

Iay Sher was my Organizations Editor. His big:
gest job was the scheduling of all the organiza-
tions for their pictures. He must have a sore ear
by now from all the telephone calls he made.

Thanks for all your help, Iay. When you come
back next year I’ll buy you a hot dog.

Ieff Hoffman was my Business Manager. His job
was probably the most difficult since he started
in January and had to learn all the procedures on
his own. How he managed to do it, I’ll never
know.

I hope to see you again next year too, Ieff. I’ll
buy you a a corned beef sandwich. If you don't
like that you can Hava Nagilah.

Dave Sheluga was my Photo Editor. He took
many of the pictures in the book, including the
Greeks and Organizations.

Thanks for all your work, Dave. Without your
pictures we wouldn’t have been able to put out a
yearbook.

Paula Shuma was my eager Sports Editor. She
started her job early in August and worked until
the following Iuly. During the Summer she
worked at home and came once or twice a week
with her finished layouts. She’s probably the
best Sports Editor the OWL ever had. When she
was done with her section, she helped out on
others.

Paula, you’re leaving too and I want to wish you
all the luck in Grad School. Thanks for all that
you've done. You really worked hard.

Angyne Schock was Greek Editor. She had to
spend much time drawing diagrams for the
Greek section. She also had an outside job dur-
ing the summer but nevertheless she got her job
done.

Since you’re Graduating I won’t be seeing you
next year. Good luck in Grad School and thanks
for all the work you did.

Mary Schwarz did many of the layouts for the
Organizations Section. She also worked during
the summer and even came in from Erie to help
out. Many thanks goes to Mary.

Many thanks and credit also goes to Bobbie
Camp for her help in the Sports section; to Doro-
thy Domis for her help in typing the Senior
Index; to phptographers Mark Lieberman, Iohn
Matera, Rich Tylor, Marv Morris, Keith Dickey,
Hank Hunziker, Stephanie Szymanowski, and
Jack Clarke for the many pictures which they
supplied us with; to Iudy Lawniczak for her help
in typing and mostly in delivering our color
slides and pictures.

I would also like to thank Barb Benson for secre-
tarial help during the photographing of seniors;
to Kris Bodner, Mary Svegel, Nancy Miller, Iim
Merski, Wes Ayers, Bob DelGreco, Tom Car-
ruso, and Terry Rhines for their help in Senior
picture sign-ups; Andrea Auyash, Barb Mari-
mow, Iay Fleischauer for their help on business
staff; Shellie Specter for her help in Parent
Patrons; and finally, Ala11 Segal who served as
part-time Business Manager.

Special thanks goes to R. David Tive, Director of
Student Publications for his never ending help
in the many problems of publishing a yearbook.
His advice certainly made my job much easier.
A thank you also goes to Chris Chergi, secretary
to Student Publications for her help in typing
and good humor; and to Karen Kenny for her
moral support.

~ I 5740243835

Bob Albright was the representative from Taylor
Publishing Company. His help with the book
was invaluable, especially during final deadline
time. Many thanks, Bob, for all the work you did
for us. Many thanks to the entire Taylor Publish-
ing staff for all their help.

Dick Ware was the Photographer from Root Stu-
dios who had to put up with a hectic schedule.
Thank you, Dick.

Finally a note of thanks goes to Barbara Repasi
for all her help in getting various address labels
sent to us; to Ken, whose last name I don’t know,
for all the duplicating services he performed for
us; to Vice-Chancellor Moye for his understand-
ing in the subject of Remunerations; to Paul and
Harry, two men who helped to keep our office
clean and looking somewhat lived in.

And so the list of thank you’s comes to an end. If
there was anyone I omitted, I apologize now. It
was all of these people who helped to put out a
truly great yearbook. With people like this will-
ing to work, it is not likely that the Yearbook will
die out at Pitt.

Throughout my comments I have referred to
some people as seeing them next year. That’s
simply because I will be back next year as a Sen-
ior and Editor once again.

Thank you, all of you, once again. If this book
brings happiness to even one person, then our
work achieved it’s mission.
