DR. E. ALLEN HOLBROOK

Because of the increased demand by war
industries for college trained men with tech-
nical training, the School of Engineering and
Mines continues to be the University’s most
important aid to the war effort. Dr. Elmer
Allen Holbrook heads the School of Engineer-
ing and Mines which is composed of the seven
main departments of aeronautical, chemical,
civil, electrical, industrial, mechanical and
general engineering. Registration in the
School of Engineering and Mines has increased
steadily since the outbreak of war with the

DEAN RUTH PERKINS KUEHN

SENIORS
SCHOOL OF
NURSING

Ruth Perkins Kuehn is comparatively new
among Pitt deans, but she has already gained
an enviable reputation. Under her guidance,
the School of Nursing has made perhaps the
most astounding advances of any school in the
University as it prepares students to take
their places as “angels of mercy” both on the
home front and as Red Cross Nurses in the
Army and Navy. It is unfortunate indeed
that Dean Kuehn is of necessity off campus
so much, for she is a worthy friend.

DEANS OF OTHER SCHOOLS

DR. H. EDMUND FRIESSELL

Dentistry occupies a prominent place in
the programs of the armed services.
Under the capable leadership of Dean H.
Edmund Friessell, Pitt’s Dental School
has been recognized as class “A” since
1918. Due to Dr. Friesse1l’s work, it is
doing all in its power to further the war
effort.

DEAN JUDSON A. CRANE

Registration in the Law School has
suffered considerably because of the draft.
However, Dean Judson A. Crane, teach-
ing member of the faculty since 1917, is
taking war problems in his stride and
still ﬁnds time to do research work and
to serve with the fAllegheny:County_Bar
Association.

DEAN WILBUR I. NEWSTETTER

With the entrance of our country into
war, the School of Social Sciences has
gained added popularity and importance.
Although registration has dropped,
students are greatly interested in Dean
Wilbur I. Newstetter’s program for train-
ing workers in Government Service.

In a year replete with changes and inova-
tions, the Pitt Evening News has had its
share of changes in staff. Marriages, the
armed forces, and defense plants have taken
their toll. Yet, the policy of the Evening
News, that of giving to the students a paper
which expresses the opinions of students in
the evening school, has remained unchanged.

There has been no tightening of regula-
tions; the Evening News continues to print
its views whether in favor or in opposition to
current changes. Its purpose is to promote
freedom of speech since only in this way can

it take its true place among the organizations
of a democratic University in a democratic
nation.

The writers of the Pitt Evening News feel
that if they have made the readers of their
publication more appreciative of the privilege
of living in a country where such a paper as
this is possible, if they have installed in even
a handful of students a deeper regard and a
ﬁrmer belief in the American ideals which
the University fosters, then this changing
year of 1942-1943 has been a successful one.

1943

During the past year one of the busiest and
hardest working organizations in the Uni-
versity was the Owl. Clicking typewriters,
ringing phones, and mingling voicesﬂthese
were the daily sounds one could hear from the
office on the eighth ﬂoor and later, after the
cadets took over, from the new ofﬁce on the
thirtieth ﬂoor. August Trovaioli, now in the
U. S. Army, spent many long hours during his
summer vacation planning this book, and
throughout it there are many evidences of his
artistic ability. When Augie was called to
the army, Viola, Arline and Ed took over
where he left off and endeavored to carry out
the policy and plans he had established.
Many stories had to be written, pictures taken
and identiﬁed, prints sent to the engraver,

copy checked, and ﬁnal plans made with the
printer. The staff realized then that publish-
ing a book is a continual ﬁght against time.

Don Lingenfelter and his business staff
paid for what the editorial staff spent, kept
the books balanced, and contacted the
students when necessary. The advertising
staff, under the managership of John White-
man, smashed all previous records for adver-
tisements, helping to reduce the ultimate cost
of the Owl to the students. This year the
Owl boasts of the largest circulation ever
attained at the University.

It was all hard work, but it was fun, too,
and the staff presents with pride the record
of an eventful and unusual year in the lives
of the students and faculty of the University.

THE 1943

The staff of the wartime Panther this year
worked hard to make it a campus magazine
of interest and originality that would answer
the morale-building demand for jokes and
cartoons. The September and October issues
were Welcomed for their lovely freshman
cover girls and for clever, individualized
feature articles. A novel photocrime, an
action picture story of Pitt’s football team,
personal sketches of B.M.O.C.’s, and several
Saroyanistic stories helped put the Panther
on Pitt’s best seller list. They also made it a
favorite of the many Pitt men in the service
to whom it was mailed.

PANTHER

After the ﬁrst two issues, which were ably
edited by Jim Glasgow and Chuck Brossman
and expertly controlled ﬁnancially by Chuck
Page, the Panther suspended publication for
the duration. The University administration
thought that during wartime the energies and
time of the staff could be more useful else-
where. Economically, it was the only prac-
tical and patriotic thing to do. But the ad—
ministration believes that there is a place at
Pitt for such a magazine. The Panther is
not dead; when peace comes it will live again.

PITT

This year’s Pitt News carried through in
determined fashion editor Irwin Rosen’s policy
of expanding the editorial scope of the public-
ation far beyond the conﬁnes of the campus.
Editorials appeared which concerned them-
selves with India, Russia, Manpower, the
National Association of Manufacturers, Vice-
President Wallace, International Student’s
Day, the United Nations.

The News proved to be one of the major
aids to all win—the-war activities at the Uni-
versity. It supported: the victory book drive,
the blood bank, the bond and stamp drive,
W.S.G.A.’s war-time resolutions for women’s
activities. It opposed: big time dances during
the war years, unethical student politics in

MILITARY DEPARTMENT

George Washington, with his incom-
parable foresight, once said, “In time of
peace, prepare for war”. However, it
was not until the close of World War I
that the American people acted on his
advice. Intervening years and wars had
proved the necessity of preparedness and
consequently, the Reserve Officers Train-
ing Corps was founded.

The University of Pittsburgh is proud
that in years of peace, her Reserve
Ofﬁcers Training Corps has been known
as one of America’s largest units and that
today her men go forth prepared to serve
our country.

MILITARY BALL

Music by Frankie Masters, Bernie Cummings and Bill LeRoy

Big names in music were the featured at-
tractions at the annual Military Ball of the
University of Pittsburgh; Frankie Masters
ﬁlled the band stand in the Silver Ball Room,
Bill LeRoy took over the Urban Room, and
Bernie Cummins “swung out” in the Cardinal
Room on the seventeenth floor of the William
Penn Hotel. For the first time in Pitt’s
history, the “Military”, chairmened by George
L. Illig and Richard C. Stein, was held late in
the Fall, November 20, in order that the great
number of senior men graduating in February
might have a last chance to attend a Pitt
formal affair. In addition to the traditional
uniforms of the R.O.T.C., Army, Navy, and

Marine uniforms ﬁlled the dance ﬂoors, giving
evidence of the number of our boys already
in the services. As usual, the floors were
jammed with people enjoying themselves at
this, the last formal dance for the duration of
the war. The highlight of the evening came
when seven R.O.T.C. men marched down a
military corridor of crossed sabers and were
tapped into Scabbard and Blade. After the
ceremony, with the last note of the bugle,
dancing was resumed until one o’clock.
Women at the dance received favors—lapel
pins fashioned in the shape of crossed cannons
of the coast artillery.

In the words of their corps song, and in
their activities throughout the year, Pitt
Riﬂes pledged themselves to their school and
country. Gearing plans to ﬁt wartime needs,
Pitt Riﬂes, honorary military fraternity, did
its share in perfecting officers for the future.
Weather did not stop these boys from practic-
ing close order drill formations to gain ex-
perience in giving orders and army discipline.
Still more practical were the Workouts on the
anti—aircraft guns, and the various lectures on
gas mask drill and seacoast guns. War games

were no plaything this year as dead seriousness
prevailed in each endeavor.

Traditional hell week took in a large group
of freshmen candidates aspiring to wear the
tri-color bar, symbol of the organization.
Captain Husband, faculty advisor, turned his
position over to Captain Pack on being called
to more active service. Trim, well drilled,
soldier-like . . Pitt Riﬂes passed in review
this year with ﬂying colors, looking forward
to greater exploits in the service of the armed
forces of our country.

First in war and ﬁrst in peaceﬁthese are
Scabbard and Blademen. With true soldierly
foresight, Scabbard and Blade, honorary mili-
tary fraternity for advanced R. O. T. C.
students, adjusted its program this year to
meet wartime needs. The new 50 mm.
Boﬁus director and machine guns became
their center of attention and study, and they

learned to clean and assemble them in quick

order. Give these boys a gun they can shoot,
and clear the decks for action.

Social events were cut to a minimum, yet
the impressive fall tapping conducted at the
Military Ball retained its precision and color
as the new candidates paraded through the
arch of shining steel. Seven new members
from the advanced corp of the University

R. O. T. C. were tapped on November 20.

New members were William Saalbach, Donald
Desaulniers, Paul Kuzmick, Donald Melaney,
Jack Rowland, Harold Stickel, and Richard
Kramer. Even traditional “Hell Week” was
modiﬁed to teach the pledges useful military
knowledge, as well as to toughen them for
greater battles. Officers for the year 1943
were elected in February. Albert McCoy
was elected Captain; Richard Kramer, ﬁrst

lieutenant; William Moffat, second lieutenant;
and John McCormick, ﬁrst sergeant.

The war did not affect the good nature of
the Boys in Blue as they argued over long-
range plans to win the Russian or African
campaigns. Special meetings with lectures by
military ofﬁcers and motion pictures on war
problems kept the Pitt Scabbard and Blade

from becoming rusty. They are ready for

action.

“Fanfare up!” is the familiar watchword to the members of the Pitt military marching
band. Immediately 120 cadets snap to attention and an instant later step smartly out
between the goal posts onto the striped turf of the stadium gridiron to thrill Saturday after-
noon football fans. One of the largest in the country, the University band owes its fame to
the skillful execution of its intricate and novel formations. The organization has a reputa-
tion for proﬁciency in marching that is unsurpassed by any other unit of its kind. The
ten rows of twelve men each, clad in the regulation blue cadet uniform, move in perfect
alignment down the ﬁeld. All movements are executed with military precision. This
appeal together with the superior instrumentation of the group presents to the spectators
a show unique in style and adeptness.

Pitt’s Male Glee Club has always held the
reputation of being one of the ﬁnest choruses
in the country, and this past year was no
exception. Although the annual singing tour
had to be cancelled because of wartime re-
strictions, the Gold and Blue singers pre-
sented—and magniﬁcently—a minstrel show,
Friday, January 22. The curtain went up on
a patriotic theme . . . Jimmy Dunn performed
as interlocutor . . . Curt Greenburg displayed
his clever dancing feet . . . and of course
Professor Theodore “Pop” F inney supplied
the harmony with his b1ack—faced harmonizers.

Admission to the show was gained easily
enough~al1 the student had to do to get a
ticket was purchase two twenty—ﬁve cent
war—savings stamps before the performance.
The Glee Club took the show around the
Pittsburgh district for the beneﬁt of other
institutions.

Within the Glee Club itself is a small
group known as the Varsity Quartet which
blends its voices at various performances.
Jerome Kleinerman, Mark Crum, Thomas
Bole, and Robert Harvey make up the
quartet.

One of the ﬁrst of man’s arts, and today
certainly one of the most important, is music.
In all great universities, music is recognized
as an approach to and a means of understand-
ing of higher conceptualism. Here at Pitt,
Women’s Choral is fostering among the
women of the University an appreciation for
good music. With June Cockley as president,
the girls have organized for choral singing and
fellowship. They help to bolster each other’s
hopes and spirits as well as their own, whether
it’s by singing “America”, “F inlandia”, or

“The Marseillaise” for fun, or whether it’s by
practicing for hours to present a good Beaux
Arts program for the freshmen. The Choral
also entertains for outside organizations and
churches, and gives concerts here at school.
Its members believe that where there is song,
there is hope, and they know that as long as
we can join in singing songs, we need have no
fear for the future; our domestic tranquility
will not only be regained, but it will also mean
more to us because We have fought for it and
won.

PITT PLAYERS

Pitt Players’ greatest and last season for
the duration began and ended with morale as
the keynote. During the summer semester
last year they presented their ﬁrst summer
show “Morale For Victory” featuring a dance
chorus of ten Pitt lovelies, a one act play
“Miracle on the Danube”, the Lincoln-
Douglas debate scene from “Abe Lincoln In
Illinois,” and an original round-table poetry
and prose reading session of American
patriotic writings. No admission was charged
to this or the next four productions. Only
the last play of the season, “Knickerbocker
Holiday,” had an admission charge. In
October, “Till the Day I Die,” an anti-Nazi
play by Clifford Odets, was presented on
campus and then taken on a tour of the
community centers of the city for one night
stands. November found Players presenting
“Abe Lincoln In Illinois’’ for campus and off-

campus audiences. In December, Players
produced the Russian Christmas play “Where
Love Is” under the direction of Miss Ruth
Haun.

For the 69th commemoration of Stephen
C. Foster’s death, Players produced a short-
ened version of “Uncle Tom’s Cabin” which
featured the celebration in the Foster Mem-
orial auditorium. In March the musical
comedy “Knickerbocker Holiday” by Max-
well Anderson had a ﬁve night run in Foster
Memorial auditorium, the last night of which
was for the air cadet Candidates stationed
here at the University. In all, Pitt Players
presented six shows, giving a total of 22 per-
formances with admission charged to only
three performances. All other performances
were presented under the auspices of the
University Key Center of War Information
program for building public morale through
entertainment.

Theatron, a select group of Pitt actors and
stage technicians, is the honorary dramatic
fraternity on campus. It recognizes Pitt
Players of outstanding ability and taps to
membership twice each year. The ﬁrst tap-
ping occurred in the Stephen Collins Foster
Memorial Auditorium at an informal reception
held after the last performance of the anti-
Nazi play “Till The Day I Die”. At the con-
clusion of the musical comedy “Knicker-
bocker Holiday” the second tapping cere-
mony was held. The outstanding event of
the Theatron year centered around the initia-
tion ceremonies held in the Greek Room,
followed by a banquet at the College club and
a trip to the Nixon theatre where they saw
how the professionals did their work.
Theatron works in close cooperation with the
Pitt Players to encourage interest in dramatics
at the University. Members accomplish their
purpose by stirring up student interest in Pitt
Player productions and by actually participat-
ing in all Pitt Player activities. This year,
with Pitt Players presenting all shows except
“Kinckerbocker Holiday” free of charge in
addition to taking all these shows on a tour of
the recreational centers of the city, Theatron
members had a busy season. To the members
of Theatron all of Pitt is a stage and they are
the actors on it.

Just as the thirteen original states were
convinced that any really strong nation must
have a powerful centralization, so did the
thirteen women’s fraternities feel the need for
a council “to form a more perfect Union and
to insure domestic tranquility.” Panhellenic
Council operates under basic principles that
are so like our own Constitution: the Council
is composed of two representatives from each
of the women’s fraternities; it handles all
fraternity matters through intelligent dis-
cussions and with a spirit of cooperation, for
only by venturing to express opinions freely
can democracy in any enterprise endure; the
Council stresses the many ﬁne things that all
groups have in common; it handles fraternity

procedures and makes only a few rules for all
fraternities for the common good. Panhel-
lenic Council fosters a social program and an
educational program for freshmen. It renders
service whenever possible to the University
and to the life of women.

The ﬁnal test of a nation is its ability to
unite in a common effort when the national
defense is in question. Panhellenic Council
has met this test. Now, in time of war,
Panhellenic Council has taken over the War
Activities Committee. Although each frater-
nity has been active in itself in the war pro-
gram, Panhellenic Council has realized that
there is power in numbers and has amended
its program to ﬁt world conditions of today.

Zeta Tau Alpha has the distinction of being
the ﬁrst national women’s fraternity on the
campus of the University of Pittsburgh. Zeta
Tau Alpha came to Pitt in October of 1915.

The fall social season this year was a
varied one, beginning with the traditional
pre-school luncheon held at the Royal York.
Later, a tea was held for members of the Pitt
faculty. Every Wednesday during the school
year, the Zeta girls grouped together at the
fraternity house for luncheon, which was
followed by an afternoon of bridge.

In keeping with the times, the ZTA’s were

busier than ever doing all they could for
victory. They combined work with pleasure
and held a bridge party for the beneﬁt of the
armed forces. Similarly, they did their bit to
advance the sale of war bonds and stamps.
Throughout the year, various parties were held
to entertain service men who were stationed
in Pittsburgh.

Besides taking care of their various social
and war-time activities, Zetas also held im-
portant campus positions, including such
posts as president of Mortar Board, treasurer
of W. S. G. A., president of Y. W. C. A. and
vice president of the Junior class.

The Theta Kite has been ﬂying high for a
great many years, as this group was the second
national women’s fraternity to be established
on the University of Pittsburgh campus and
has been one of the leading women’s organiza-
tion ever since.

In former years, dances, coke parties,
slumber parties, and football week-ends took
up all of the Thetas’ spare time, but this year
the advent of war brought about a change.
Alice Conick devoted her spare time during
the summer to acting in the Morale Institute
plays, and Alma Nicholas took an active part
on the United War Fund Committee. The

nickname “patriotic pa1eface” could have been
adopted by all of the Theta girls, for they were
the ﬁrst women’s organization to donate their
blood en masse to the blood bank. The local
chapter also has aided the national organiza-
tion in investing $150,000 in war bonds. The
girls raised part of the money for this invest-
ment by bringing lunch boxes to school on
Wednesdays and Thursdays and donating the
money that they would ordinarily have spent
for lunches to the war fund. Along with all
their war work, the girls still had time for
school activities and held numerous offices in
W. S. G. A.

Keeping up morale on the home front is
one of the many jobs at which the Tri Delts
rank high. One could plainly see this in the
smiling faces of the many uniformed men at
the Saturday night house dances, and especi-
ally at the Christmas dance at the Hotel
Schenley. The shrieks of a dozen excited
children when Santa handed out gifts and
popcorn at the annual Orphans’ Party showed
sufficient proof that at least these few children
were made happy.

Warbling their faithfulness to their

“Dream Man”, the Tri Delts once more
placed in the Panhellenic Sing contest with

the help of the ﬁne coaching of Unit Advisor
Janet Jenkins.

It was to a very proud group of girls
that Mary Jeanne Olander handed the
proceeds from their rummage sale-the funds
being sufﬁcient to buy a sizeable war bond,
with still enough left over so that the girls
might contribute to the China Relief Fund,
which is a national Tri Delt Project.

At the traditional six o’clock Pansy Break-
fast after graduation, thirty very sleepy girls
bid farewell to seniors Betty Jamison, Alice
McKee, Rhea Krisco, and Senior Court mem-
bers Mabel Moore and Lois Blotter.

Delta Zeta looks back upon another suc-
cessful year in its history on Pitt Campus.
The fourth national women’s fraternity to
come to Pitt, it was founded in 1916. Under
the leadership of President Pauline Graham,
Omicron chapter decided, in the light of
present conditions, to modify its activities, and
and moved into the University Club for the
duration of the war. Although social life had
to be somewhat adjusted, social functions,
under the chairmanship of W.A.A. president
Ruth Yardumium, still played an important
part in fraternity life. The year’s activities
were begun with an informal hayride followed

by a weiner roast, and climaxed in the spring
with a senior farewell dance. Several of the
traditional affairs held during the year include
the Founder’s Day Banquet and the New
Year’s dance at Hotel Schenley.

Delta Zeta has also contributed its share
to the war effort by buying stamps and bonds
from the Pitt War Stamp booth, headed by
chairman Ruth Becker. And by encouraging
a spirit of friendship and wholehearted co-
operation among the girls, Delta Zeta has
contributed to making women’s fraternities
an active part of school life.

Since 1919, the members of Kappa Kappa
Gamma have been taking an active part in
the activities of the University. This year,
under the guidance of president Ruth Sample,
the Kappas are doing their part for victory.
By sponsoring such events as informal bridge
parties, a skirt and sweater party at South
Park Lodge for the T hetas, and a Christmas
dance at Hotel Schenley, they have helped
greatly in the keeping up of the necessary
normalities of social life at Pitt. The fra-
ternity has charge of an information booth for
the W. A. A. C. in the downtown Pennsyl-

vania station, and is also helping nationally
to establish recreational centers for women in
the service. Many of the girls of Kappa
Kappa Gamma have civilian defense jobs,
while others are doing their part by buying
War bonds, giving their blood to the Red
Cross blood bank, and by doing volunteer war
service work for the University. K. K. G.
has rolled up its sleeves and pitched in en-
thusiastically, ﬁlling more than ever the grow-
ing need for friendship and fraternity in a
University at war.

Chi Omega was the sixth national women’s
fraternity to be organized on the University
of Pittsburgh campus, having begun its
activity immediately after the end of the ﬁrst
world war. Today Chi O’s new generation is
still doing its part to keep Panhellenic Associ-
ation functioning normally in wartime. The
members of this new generation have con-
tributed considerably with their parties and
their pre-Christmas Open House tea dance at
the new Chi Omega headquarters, 245 N.
Dithridge Street. They have helped socially,
to keep things running smoothly.

Under the leadership of President Joan
Bielau, Chi Omegas periodically entertain
soldiers, send boxes of cookies, candy and
cigarettes to friends in the service, donate their
blood to the Red Cross, take part in the bond
and stamp drive, and buy war stamps weekly.

Several of the Chi O’s have important
positions in school activities such as the chair-
manship of the Transfer Committee, held by
Joan Bielau; editor of the Vade Mecum, the
women’s handbook, Harriet Bauer; and W. S.
G. A. representative of the class of ’44 and
Associate Editor of the Owl, Viola Boydjieff.

The seventh women’s fraternity on the Pitt
campus was Alpha Delta Pi. This year, in
addition to their usual activities, the girls,
realizing the need for medical materials for
the men in service, have adopted a project of
making and ﬁlling Red Cross kits. With the
money raised in the A.D.Pi’s “Victory Cam-
paign” held this year, they have already
supplied over 750 of these Red Cross kits to
men at their various ports of embarkation.
An ambulance, now in service in T unbridge
Wells, England, which carried the wounded
to nearby hospitals during heavy bombing
raids, was donated through the funds received

in last year’s “Thumbs Up” campaign also
held by the girls.

As for social activities during this past year,
many luncheons, dinners, and dances have
been held at various clubs in the city and at
the Alpha Delta Pi apartment in the Belleﬁeld
Dwellings.

These projects accompanied with their
customary scholastic and social activities have
kept the girls busy and happy on the home
front. They can be proud of doing their
share to further the war effort both at home
and abroad.

In order to insure domestic tranquility,
the women’s fraternities of the University of
Pittsburgh have functioned and grown up
until now they occupy a vital and essential
part of campus life. Alpha Epsilon Phi came
to the Pitt campus in the boom year of 1928.
A social fraternity with its home located in
the Belleﬁeld Dwellings on Center Avenue,
Alpha Epsilon Phi now has an active member-
ship of twenty—seven girls, all of whom are
bound together, not only by the same pin,
but by common interests and by a common
religious backgroud. Reva Rosenberg, Dean

of Nu chapter at Pitt, plus the entire member-
ship of the fraternity, recognizing the necessity
for all organizations to participate actively in
this war, have taken part in a number of
activities this year, having sponsored a bridge
to raise enough money to provide a Mobile
Canteen for the use of the Red Cross. In
working hard together throughout the year,
struggling over various obstacles the A E
Phi’s have established lifelong ties of friend-
ship built on a solid foundation which shall
grow in strength and endure as long as
democracy itself.

Although Phi Mu was the ninth fraternity
to enter the Pitt campus, it can boast a much
earlier birthday, nationally. This year there
were 91 candles on the Phi Mu birthday
cake—the second oldest women’s fraternity
in the United States.

Here at Pitt, Beta Theta chapter cele-
brated its twenty-third year on campus by
moving into an ultra—modernistic apartment.
The alumni members contributed new furni-
ture and the Mother’s Club added new
curtains and drapes so that the only old
articles in the apartment are the books and
the cups which Beta Theta has won. Natu-
rally, the girls wanted to “show-off” their new

home, so they have done a lot of entertaining.
Monthly bridges, teas, house dances, and
novel parties are no longer special occasions
for the Phi Mus. As their contribution to the
war effort, Phi Mu girls have entertained
soldiers and are proud to say that each mem-
ber is enrolled in some sort of civilian defense
Work.

Although no prizes were offered, the
different girls in the fraternity have been
competing among themselves to see who can
write the best Phi Mu song; every Monday
night someone introduces her “masterpiece.”

This past year has been a year-round
housewarming for the Phi Mu girls.

Theta Phi Alpha has just completed its
twentieth year on campus in high standing,
both scholastically and socially. During the
past year, the girls supported the numerous
war drives, including the purchase of war
bonds and stamps, blood donations and the
victory book drive. During the past summer
they also held several events, one of the most
outstanding of which was a dance given in
honor of the men stationed at the Keystone
Radio School. The fall semester was climaxed
by a Christmas dance and their annual doll-

party for underpriveleged children. Their
social calendar for the Spring semester in-
cluded a service men’s dance and a Spring
Formal. The TPA’S awarded the Margaret
Enright Memorial Scholarship of seventy-ﬁve
dollars a semester to the most promising
Sophomore girl student. Amid their many
activities, the girls found time to redecorate
their house, give their time to downtown
service centers and take an active part in
student organizations.

Phi Sigma Sigma which was the eleventh
woman’s fraternity to make a place for itself
on the Pitt Campus was organized in 1923.
Each year since then, they have devoted
themselves to helping some worthwhile organ-
ization, and this year they have given all their
efforts to war activities. While plans were
still being formulated for the new year, the
girls began to bring knitting to the meetings
and this developed into one of their largest
war projects.

The ﬁrst big project to be adopted was
that of rolling bandages for the Red Cross.
The girls have gone individually and in groups

to the Red Cross Headquarters where they
have helped to do this work and have learned
ﬁrst aid methods.

On the social side, many Phi Sig members
helped out at the Variety Club Canteen, for
they took whole-hearted interest in helping to
cheer the service men traveling through our
city.

This and all the other activities throughout
the past year have helped to bring Phi Sigma
Sigma members closer together in their real-
ization that ideals of friendship and nation are
worth ﬁghting for.

Delta Phi Epsilon, the twelfth organization
to enter the women’s fraternity roster at Pitt
was established on the campus in 1925. From
that time on it has tried to fulﬁll its purpose
of fostering good will and enriching the lives
of students through a closer, more intimate
group life, and it has been successful in attain-
ing this goal. Delta Phi Epsilon members are
very active in school activities and organiza-
tions, but they also ﬁnd sufﬁcient time to get
together socially in order to preserve that
spirit of friendly cooperation and the feeling

of comradeship which is prevalent in this
fraternal group.

Over and above their participation in war
activities, the girls are preparing for a victor-
ious future and a return to peace and tran-
quility by carrying on the ideals and customs
of our nation, such as group songs, friendships
and a common bond. They realize the need
of a stabilizing inﬂuence to counterbalance the
tendency towards a shift of perspective in this
rapidly changing world. D. Phi E’s intend to
use their fraternity as this steadying factor.

Since 1888 Beta Sigma Omicron has aided
in the maintainance of American tranquility.
Organized ﬁrst in the South, midst the tur-
moil of Civil War Reconstruction, the frater-
nity has stood for gentility, culture, and
service. Today the Beta Sigs at Pitt still
stand for these same high ideals, and endeavor
to carry on these traditional policies in both
their social and scholastic activities.

During World War I the national organ-
ization sent six hundred hospital beds to
hospitals in France, and in addition adopted
ten war orphans. The girls at Pitt also take

great pride in the fact that after the Armistice
was signed, Beta Sigma Omicron established a
national philanthropy, the Pine Mountain
Settlement School. Situated in Harlan
County, Kentucky, this organization was
established to educate underprivileged chil-
dren of the Kentucky hills, who would other-
wise not enjoy such a privilege.

Not content to rest on their World War I
laurels, the fraternity decided to donate
station wagons to the American Red Cross and
to take a prominent part in volunteer services
in addition to their regular school activities.

Alpha Phi Delta has successfully com-
pleted its ﬁrst year as a fraternity on the Pitt
campus. During its probational period, Alpha
Phi Delta functioned as the A.P.D. club.
Throughout the year the fraternity had to
overcome the problems which beset every
young organization and in addition to pass
the obstacles imposed by a war-strained
campus. A member of Inter—fraternity coun-
cil, Alpha Phi Delta participated in all council
activities, scholastic, social and athletic. Re-
presentatives to I. F. Council were Albert
Marrangoni, Frank DiCenzo, and Louis
Ferretti, alternate.

Wartime restrictions—gas and food ration-
ing—curtailed the fraternity’s social program

although a few parties and smokers were
held. In the spring their ﬁrst banquet com-
memorated one year of activity on campus.
The fraternity sent ten of its members to
the services during the school year. Members
in service are Lawrence Cerossimo, Samuel
Ianni, Joseph T omasino, August Trovaioli,
John Berlese, Joseph Bellissimo, Vincent
Fazio, John Chaffo, Carmen Capone, and
George Sirriani. The close of the school year
found twenty—two members remaining with
the majority of them facing imminent induc-
tion. At the fraternity’s last meeting the
members resolved to remain active at Pitt as
long as the fraternity was able to carry on
without conflicting with the war effort.

With 149 active members and alumni
serving in the armed forces, Delta Tau Delta
can truly be said to have gone to war. Mem-
bers of the fraternity on campus served the
University with distinction. Don Lingen-
felter, house manager, was elected to ODK
and was business manager of this year’s Owl.
A1 Minno, active both in the Y.M.C.A. and
the Red Cross drive, was named Junior
Worthy at tap day ceremonies in Soldiers
and Sailors Memorial Hall. Many of the
other men were also tapped to the various
honorary fraternities on campus.

Longvue Country Club was the scene of
the annual fall formal held in November.
During the same month, pledges held the
traditional “Bowery Brawl” for the active
members. Shortly before Christmas, the

Delts attended their annual Candlelight
Supper. The annual church service was held
at Trinity Cathedral under the sponsorship
of Dean Moor. Because of wartime con-
ditions, the Spring Formal was not held this
year; a picnic at South Park replaced the
affair.

Ken Alexander, Ral Merchant, and Ted
Bloomer represented the Delts on the basket-
ball squad; Les Botkin, Bergie Steytler and
Tom Carr were on the track team; and Jim
Clowes played with coach Bowser’s foot-
ballers; all these brothers helped to give Delta
Tau Delta recognition in the ﬁeld of sports.

Carl Bauer succeeded Jack Hagan to the
presidency of Delta Tau Delta at the spring
elections. Ted Bloomer became house-
manager.

Because twenty-three of the twenty-eight
active members of the fraternity were in
active service with the United States armed
forces, Lambda Chi Alpha was faced with
the prospect of closing its doors for the
duration, this summer. Under the new plan
approved by Interfraternity Council last
year, Lambda Chi Alpha was able to close
the house with its charter intact ready to
resume operation with the end of hostilities.

Based on democratic and progressive
principles, Lambda Chi Alpha seeks to further
Christianity through the intimate bond of
friendship. The Pittsburgh chapter, one of

136 national chapters, was founded here at
the University in 1919.

This year, the social activity of the
fraternity was limited to house dances and
parties held once or twice each month. No
elaborate social functions took place but the
boys could say that they enjoyed themselves
as well at their more intimate house parties.
After the Inter-fraternity Ball members of
the fraternity gathered at the house for an
after midnight breakfast. The Pitt campus
looks forward to the return of Lambda Chi
Alpha after the war.

Phi Delta Theta strengthened its fraternal
ties during the past year with a more temper-
ate, serious attitude, replacing the lighter
aspects of fraternity life that existed before
the war. The enlisting of ﬁfteen brothers into
the various branches of the armed forces and
the death of two of these members within the
past year brought the war closer to the men at
home. Now that the University is concen-
trating on mental development, leaving social
development which is fundamentally a group
endeavor up to the individual campus organ-
izations, Phi Delta Theta has become a center

for this ever important social development.
The natural result is a closer-knit house.
Friendships have come to mean more than
ever before, and a realization of a sounder and
truer meaning of brotherhood and fellowship
has been developed. These intangible assets
will become more strongly entrenched within
these men as they become older and their
afﬁliations spread, for fraternity brotherhood
is world-wide brotherhood. It is the feeling of
the individual for the group that prevails now,
stronger than ever before.

This year the spirit of Phi Epdom was in
the name. Phi Ep Pi—PEP! Vim and
vigor reached a new height on the corner of
Neville and Bayard as the brothers briskly
rushed through another year. First and last
it was all out for the war effort. The scrap
drive found the fraters whisking down their
iron back fence as their contribution. It was
a spirited group that marched as a unit to
give blood at the University Red Cross blood
bank. And when it came to bond buying
the whole house pitched in.

Of course, the rounded Phi Ep social
calendar kept tempo with other house activ-
ities, for the members realized that a high

morale is necessary for wartime students.
Li’l Abners and their Daisy May dates went
“mountaineer” at the Sadie Hawkins dance.
The Phi Ep house was transformed into a
dingy cabaret for the December pledge dance.
The boys also banded together to help Alex
Zelenski manage the business end of the
Christmas I-F Ball, and to aid Chairman
“Howdy” York in planning the Junior Prom.
The rest of the time, the upholders of Zeta
chapter worked earnestly to keep their yearly
high scholastic average. But, whether it was
the war effort, social activity, or sports, the
boys always managed to give their best with
a united “Phi Ep for Aye.”

Pi Sigma chapter of Phi Gamma Delta
still has its doors open on Wellingford street
and the brothers are working hard to keep
them open. Approximately forty of the
brothers left for the armed forces in the past
year and ﬁfteen more will have departed by
July ﬁrst. Robert Campbell did a ﬁne job
as president this year leading the Phi Gam’s
to their fourth straight Interfraternity cham-
pionship. The All-Point trophy now has had
“Phi Gamma Delta” inscribed upon it four
times since it was originated six years ago.
John Sheppard, treasurer, Lee McFadden, Jr.,
secretary, were the other ofﬁcers this year.

Among the events that contributed to the
Phi Gam Inter-fraternity championship were

a ﬁrst place in the sweepstakes, the seventh
consecutive volleyball championship, a second
place in scholarship, the I. F. Sing. basketball,
bowling, swimming, and last spring’s victory
in the I. F. track meet, golf and a tie for ﬁrst
in tennis.

After the last rush week in February,
seventeen men wore the white star of Phi
Gamma Delta, the largest pledge group of
any fraternity. Taking everything into con-
sideration, Phi Gamma Delta has cause to be
proud of their brothers and of their accomp-
lishments in school and in the service of their
country. The white star of Phi Gamma
Delta will continue to shine both in war and
in peace. '

A well rounded program of activities high-
lighted the fraternity year of Phi Kappa,
national social fraternity for Catholic men,
with special emphasis placed on athletic com-
petitions and social affairs. In the line of
sports, Phi Kappa annexed second place
crowns in the touch football and softball com-
petitions of the Interfraternity league. In
addition to these awards, Phi Kappa distin-
guished itself in basketball, badminton, horse
shoes, and volley ball. Jack Durishan and
Mike Sotack represented the fraternity con-
tribution to the varsity football team.

Socials were not neglected but combined
with the athletics produced a comfortable

schedule. House parties and dances, a New
Year’s Eve party, and a colorful ﬁsh fry were
some of the social events. Dance suggestions
came from the individual brothers with Hugh
Chavern acting in the capacity of social chair-
man. Frank Dax captained the athletic
teams and, in general, was the house athletic
director and representative to the Intramural
Athletics council.

Matthias McDonough was chairman of the
lively rush week which followed the fall initia-
tions during which week motion pictures of
the 1941 football games were shown with com-
mentaries by Durishan, Sotack, and Dutton.

The vote was unanimous—the work begun.
Thirty—ﬁVe brothers forfeited their summer
vacations to paint, plaster, decorate and re-
furnish their house. Rush week showed the
results: a new house plus a friendship to
share—the spirit of Pi Kappa Alpha—and
ﬁfty-two boys who wore the pledge shield.
Things continued to hum. The Intramural
Football Trophy found its resting place on
the Pi K A mant1e—a ﬁrst in swimming and
“highs” in all other sports showed Pi Kappa
Alpha’s athletic power. Druids . . . O.D.K.
. . . Scabbard and Blade and Pitt Riﬂes
ofﬁcers . . . Key publications men . . . Varsity
lettermen . . . Interfraternity and Soph Hop

chairmen all wore the Shield and Diamond.
House dances, hayrides and parties were
climaxed by the annual Winter Formal Dance.
At the same time as these honors came, a
greater obligation was felt by the fraternity
men. At the annual Founders’ Day Banquet,
Brother Lynn VVa1dorf keynoted this obliga-
tion when he said, “To every Pi K A, nothing
matters now but Victory”. A realization of
these words became more forceful as each
brother left for military training. For the
continuance of fellowship in a common bond,
the Pi K A’s are ﬁghting for their country and
the future of Pi Kappa Alpha.

First in studies; ﬁrst on campus. That is
the sign the Pi Lam’s hang on their doorknob
the year around. Again this year they up-
held their scholarship, achieving the highest
quality point average ever attained by a
men’s fraternity at the University of Pitts-
burgh. Last year they won permanent pos-
session of the Interfraternity Scholarship
award. Their national fraternity’s scholastic
award was again given to the Pi Lam’s. Their
slogan might well be “Where there is scholar-
ship, there is a Pi Lam.”

Led by Alex Endy, social chairman, the
Pi Lam’s continued the unique series of
dances the campus has always associated with
them. Among their dances this year were
war stamp dances where admission was gained

by the purchase of war stamps at the door.
In this manner, the Pi Lam’s keep in step with
the current trend of events. Members of the
fraternity cooperated with the University air
raid defense system, some of them serving as
wardens and door guardians during alerts.
Members donated their blood to the blood
plasma bank when it appeared on campus.

Pitt’s only summer dance held last August
found Pi Lam Leonard Bortz as chairman,
and the boys helped him make the affair a
great success. Bortz also was business
manager of the Pitt News this year, succeed-
ing Pi Lam Armond Bree. The Pi Lam’s
are continuing the excellent work which their
brothers, now in the armed forces, have done
while at the University.

Tomorrow might ﬁnd many of the SAE boys
substituting for house-party weekends, duty
in camps or, if they are lucky, USO dances.
During the past year, Pitt Campus still
recognized many prominent SAE leaders.
Robert Davis, former president of College
Association, came through with ODK and
did some high stepping besides as drum major
of the band. To Varsity athletics the Sigs
contributed footballer Bill Dillon and the

baseball rocket, Jimmy McCullough. Jimmy
Dunn, the Clark Gable without the big ears,
did his part in the Pitt Players. But not all
activities were carried on outside the class-
room. The fellows were justly proud of their
scholastic average and they could not help
bragging about the new face and new trim-
mings that they procured for their fraternity
house, which is now ﬁlled with the symbolic
atmosphere of “thumbs up, fellow”.

“ . . . To foster and maintain among its sons a spirit of fraternity, a spirit of mutual
moral aid and support; to install and maintain in the hearts of its sons love for and loyalty to
Alma Mater and its ideals; to inculcate among its sons such ideals as will result in actions
Worthy of the highest precepts of true manhood, democracy, and humanity.”

With the outbreak of war this preamble of
Sigma Alpha Mu took on a new and added
signiﬁcance. All of Sammy’s activities were
directed towards war work. The Red Cross
Blood Bank was its ﬁrst objective, and a
highly successful one at that, for every mem-
ber contributed a pint of blood at least once.
The fraternity also acted as a unit in the
University Civilian Defense air raid system.
And meatless days and dessertless meals were

taken as a matter of course.

Great social changes were wrought. Gone
were the paddling pledge programs, sleepless
“Hell Weeks”, and fraternity pranks. Lavish
house parties and formal country club dinner
dances were replaced by simple, inexpensive
house dances which proved to be highly suc-
cessful. Truly, it can be said that the
Sammy’s took to heart the precepts of their
constitution.

In step with the war program, Sigma Chi
operated its house at full schedule this summer
in accordance with the trimester plan. The
majority of the members graduated last year
are now serving in the armed forces. In
February, 1943, the following brothers were
scheduled for service: W. Machesney; B.
Kimberling; A. Lesker; C. Becraft; J. Loh-
man; R. Zerby; G. Kline; and R. Wagner.
Early in the fall, the fraternity inaugurated a
“meatless day” in conformance with the
government’s request. The fraternity is also
a part of the Pittsburgh Civilian Defense

Program, the members serving in the capacity
of air-raid wardens.

In August, the chapter entertained the
national president of the fraternity, Grand
Consul Dr. W. B. Ricks, at a alumni banquet
held in his honor. Outstanding social affairs
for the year were a formal dinner-dance held
during the Christmas season, and the Miami
Triad Ball, the latter arranged in conjunction
with the Phi Delta Theta and the Beta Theta
Pi fraternities. On December 5, the annual
Father and Son Banquet was held. Other
social events included monthly house dances,
hay rides, and occasional skating parties.

In activities both social and scholastic,
Theta Chi has gone to war. Members of
Theta Chi this year strove to maintain their
high scholastic ratings while they were pre-
paring for an imminent call to duty with the
armed forces. Financial Supervisor E. A.
Batchelder was recommissioned as a lieutenant
and left for Fort Eustis, Virginia early in the
year. Before he left, the fraternity held a
small informal dinner for him. Several
alumni and the men of the fraternity attended
and a pen and pencil set were presented to
him with the sincere good wishes that he would
be back with them soon. Lieutenant Donald

Campbell, faculty advisor, assumed Mr.
Batchelder’s duties for the duration. During
the year many of the members also left for
service.

The social committee headed by William
Russell, Joseph Bonidy and Grant McCoy
together with prexy Robert Vetter led the
boys in making lasting friendships. Two out-
standing social affairs were held. In October
the men and their dates gathered for a
Halloween dance which was followed by a
barn dance in December. So serious or gay,
studious or at play, the Theta Chi boys
promise to come out ﬁghting.

Gamma chapter of Alpha Omega Alpha
was founded in 1916 through the efforts of
Dr. Charles C. Guthrie, the fraternity’s
faculty advisor.

Membership in A.O.A. is one of the highest
honors to which a medical student can aspire,
for it is equivalent to Phi Beta Kappa for
academic students and to Sigma Xi for
students of science. Its aim is toward high
ideas in thought and action in both Medical
School and in practice, toward the promotion
of the best in medical practice, and toward

raising the standards of scholarship and pro-
fessional ethics among the students. Fellow
students and teachers judge the candidates
for membership on the following points:
scholarship, moral character, and future
promise of attainment in their chosen pro-
fession. Those judged worthy are tapped in
the spring of their junior year in school.

It is at A.O.A.’s monthly meetings that
the real service of the fraternity to its members
is rendered, for here all are inspired to work
harder toward perfection in their profession.

ORDER OF ARTUS

Order of the Artus, the only national
honorary Economics fraternity in the United
States, installed a chapter on the Pitt campus
in May 1937. Since that date, outstanding
students in Economics who were tapped to
membership have met to gain a better under-
standing of the fundamental concepts of
economics and to establish a more just regula-
tion of economic intercourse through the
education of the general public.

At the fraternity meetings, discussions of

current economic problems are led by experts
in the ﬁeld. Among this year’s guest speakers
were faculty members Dr. Boer, Dr. Isaacs,
and Dr. McKay who led discussions on present
and post—war problems. In order to further
a deeper insight into economic problems, each
year an award is given by the Order to the
student Who, in the judgement of the faculty
committee, has submitted the most outstand-
ing essay on a current economic problem.

This is the only fraternity on campus
which has as ofﬁcers faculty members. The
only election to ofﬁce is for the position of
vice—president, an ofﬁce held by a student.
This set of circumstances is speciﬁcally pro-
vided for in the charter granted Beta Gamma
Sigma. Approximately ten per cent of the
senior class in the school of Business Adminis-
tration are elected to membership each year
and tappees must have at least a cumulative
quality point average of 2.5 before they are
considered for membership. At the annual
spring initiation banquet in the Hotel Schenley,

tappees have the opportunity to talk for ﬁve
minutes on any business topic in which they
have done research work. For the ordeal of
lecturing, the tapee is rewarded with a ﬁne
dinner and an evening of fun. Each year,
Beta Gamma Sigma rewards a student in the
School of Business Administration for doing
outstanding work in the ﬁeld of business.
This year’s award to the Business Administra-
tion student who received the highest cumu-
lative quality point average went to Clara
Ruttenberg.

CHI RHO NU

Chi Rho Nu, Pitt’s honorary pre-medical
fraternity, exists to inspire the followers of
Hippocrates with a love of medicine and a
knowledge of medical ethics. It is the goal
of every pre-med freshman and it opens the
door of medicine to him. The future leaders
in the world of medicine who aspire to mem-
bership must earn at least a 2.2 quality point
average to be eligible.

Members of Chi Rho Nu make many trips
each year to hospitals, sanitoriums, and
clinics, to Watch surgical operations and to
observe medical procedure. This past year
Chi Rho Nu was fortunate in obtaining
motion pictures of operations which were

shown to the fraternity men. So successful
did the motion pictures prove to be, their con-
tinuation is planned for the future.

To form brotherhood among the members,
Chi Rho Nu encouraged the men to go out
together, pal about school together, study
together. In December members relaxed from
their strenuous program of studies and
gathered for the annual smoker amid good
food and friendly conversation. Its ideal of
friendship and scholarship among pre-med
students strengthened by the ties formed
during the past year, Chi Rho Nu’s light
shines brighter than ever.

Alpha Chapter of Cwens is fostering the
general welfare of the University with an eye
to the future by promoting leadership, scholar-
ship, and fellowship among sophomore women.
This year, aside from their regular duties of
aiding at teas and receptions and publishing
a student directory, the “two-pointers” are
each giving two hours a week to hostess work
in the Nationality rooms. For the ﬁrst time
since the Nationality Rooms have been open
to the public, students rather than paid guides
explain the history of the rooms to visitors. The
girls are working under the guidance of Miss
Rush and the Dean of Women’s Ofﬁce, whose

belief it is that the rooms will come to mean
much more to both the girls who serve as
guides and the student body at large. Presi-
dent Jean Swope reports that the Cwens are
whole-heartedly giving the rest of their spare
time to the University War Activities. This
year they are especially proud of an Alpha
alumna, Miss Betty Teal, who was elected
Secretary—Treasurer of the national organiza-
tion at the eleventh annual National Conven-
tion. Cwens at Pitt are building future
leaders, future stability and fellowship, and
traditions that a war can’t destroy.

DRUIDS

Service is the keynote to a Druid’s vocabu-
lary . . . service to school and country. From
the ﬁrst day of school when incoming fresh-
men are welcomed, to the last day when
Druids usher for senior graduation, this sopho-
more honorary activities fraternity is on call
for duty.

The annual fall smoker introducing fresh-
men to all campus activities succeeded in
starting new men off on the right track. Big
brother Druids passed the cigs, entertained a
little, gabbed a great deal, doing all they could
to put the freshmen at ease.

Going all out in the war effort, the boys
totaled a huge sale of bonds and stamps during

the summer semester. They ﬁtted them-
selves into the air raid protection system by
serving as door guardians during alerts, and
when the blood bank appeared on campus,
Druids aided by signing the volunteer blood
donors and donating their own blood as well.

On the lighter side, their weekly meetings
were slightly less than formal, despite prexy
Newstetter’s continual plea for order. Neither
will any Druid forget the stag spaghetti dinner
held in November. This, coupled with
their annual banquet, cemented that feeling
of friendship that should last longer than
college days.

It was the belief in freedom of speech and
discussion which gave pre-legal students the
initiative to form this extra-curricular organ-
ization for undergraduates. Organized in
1921, the John Marshall Club was named in
honor of the famed chief justice of the U. S.
Supreme Court. The club aims “to promote
closer union between pre-legal students and
to broaden the outlook which these students
may have, by presenting before them men
worthy of acclaim in their respective ca1lings.”

This year’s activities began with a smoker

held on November 17 at which guest speaker
Dr. Elmer D. Graper spoke on “Recent
Developments In Constitutional Law.” To
acquaint the members with actual legal pro-
cedure, trips to district courts to witness trials
were planned. Judson A. Crane, new Dean
of the School of Law, was tapped to member-
ship at the ﬁrst summer tapping ceremony in
the history of the club. John Marshall
actives are chosen from the students of
political science and economics who evince a
liking for the legal profession.

MORTAR BOARD

Today, with women playing an increas-
ingly important role in the affairs of the world,
there is a new vista of opportunity for college-
educated women. Those at the University
realize the urgent need for a group of women,
capable of leading and governing groups and
of taking responsibility, to be trained to take
an active part in public life, today and in the
future. In Mortar Board these end objectives
are recognized and measures are taken to
accomplish them.

Mortar Board is a national honorary ac-
tivities society for senior women in which
second semester junior women, who during

their ﬁve previous semesters at the University
“have rendered service without hope of re-
ward, have fostered leadership without selﬁsh
vainglory, and have honored learning without
display” are chosen for membership.

On Tap Day, twenty new girls were tapped
into membership and welcomed into the group
by President Melva Werlinich. At their ﬁrst
meeting, the ideals of the society, the progress
that has been made in the past, and the plans
outlined for the future were explained fully
and in detail to the new wearers of the black
and gold mortar board pins.

In times of stress a country looks to its
leaders. The University strives to turn out
such men, many of whom will be members of
Omicron Delta Kappa, national honorary
activities fraternity. Men outstanding for
their scholastic records and their participa-
tion in campus activity comprise its member-
ship. The goal of every male student, Omi-
cron Delta Kappa has become doubly im-
portant now for these men will help win the
war and establish the peace to follow.

Usually Omicron Delta Kappa holds two
tapping ceremonies each year. The past year
tradition was broken with the ﬁrst summer
tapping ceremony in the twenty-six years that
Omicron Delta Kappa has been on campus.

PI TAU PHI

Pi Tau Phi, senior honorary scholastic
fraternity in the College, is a local organiza-
tion open to second semester juniors who have
attained a quality point average of 2.5 or
better. With Dr. James Stinchcomb as its
advisor and with its highly select member-
ship, this organization’s purpose is the spread
of the aims of scholarship, culture, and
idealism, the stimulation of serious thought,
and the establishment of true intellectual
standards. Through its regular monthly
meeting the organization provides a means of
social fellowship and opportunity of exchange
of ideas.

The social high-light of the season was the
initiation ceremony held in the Tuck Shop at
which the topics of discussion were subjects
of vital everyday interest. Though tappees
are formally initiated into the fraternity at a
banquet in April, they are also named at
Scholar’s Day exercises. Membership in the
organization is limited. On Scholar’s Day,
Pi Tau Phi gives the annual award to the
senior student in the college showing the
greatest scholastic improvement. At a meet-
ing in January, Lois Blotter was reelected as
President, and Bill Pankuch was elected as
Secretary-Treasurer.

Quax, honorary science fraternity for
women, was formed to inspire and develop
interest in the science among its members and
the student body as a whole. Membership
includes those Women who by the end of their
sophomore year have indicated a science as
their major subject and who have shown
promising ability in their chosen ﬁelds. A
high honor average in their general school
work as well as in their major subject is neces-
sary to qualify for membership.

At present, their are sixteen active mem-
bers whose majors include the ﬁelds of

psychology, mathematics, biology, physics,
chemistry, geology and engineering.

During these days of war the demand for
women to ﬁll positions in the ﬁelds of science
and industry have increased tremendously
and to such a point that the federal govern-
ment urges college women to continue their
studies in the scientiﬁc subjects.

Quax women are doing their part by train-
ing and preparing to replace men in science
and industry, training so that the men may
be released to join the armed forces of the
United States.

SIGMA GAMMA EPSILON

Helping “to provide for the common de-
fense” are the members of Sigma Gamma
Epsilon, honorary mining and metallurgical
society. These men are learning the prin-
ciples and methods for perfecting guns, armor
plate and the other weapons of warfare. The
members of Sigma Gamma Epsilon come from
the ﬁelds of mining, geology, petroleum engin-
eering and metallurgy. Because of the ac-
celerated program of studies these men limited
their program of extra-curricular activities to
the minimum.

Sigma Gamma Epsilon taps its members
from among the outstanding students who are

inclined toward a career in metallurgy. Mem-
bers might describe the fraternity initiation in
terms of “heat treatment, quench, and
temper” for these have signiﬁcant meaning
to these students.

Discussions among members would deal
with such typical metallurgical subjects as
ferrite, austenite, martensite, pearlite, eu-
tectic composition, phase diagram — terms
familiar only to those in this particular ﬁeld of
engineering. The annual freshman award of
associate membership status and A.I.M.M.E.
publication subscriptions, instituted last year,
was continued.

The Beta Chapter of Sigma Kappa Phi,
national honorary foreign languages fratern-
ity, has existed on campus since 1921. The
purpose of the organization, as deﬁned in the
constitution, is for “the recognition of out-
standing ability and attainments in the
foreign languages, the stimulation of advanced
work and individual research in the language
ﬁeld, the creation of a spirit of unity and co-
operation among the students of foreign
languages.”

Sigma Kappa Phi is a miniature Tower of
Babel, for among its members you may hear
French, German, Greek, Latin, Portuguese,
and Spanish, as well as a few other languages
not taught at the University. Meetings pro-
vide excellent opportunities for students to
twist their tongues in foreign conversations,
for the members are vitally aware of the value

of their linguistic studies . . . . as much or
more so in wartime than in peacetime.

The chief events of the year are always the
pinning of the yellow and white ribbons on the
new initiates at the fall and spring banquets.
Open House, usually the climaxing event of
the year for Sigma Kappa Phi when each
language group presents a colorful program,
has been suspended, but only for “the dura-
tion”, after which the tradition shall be
renewed with increased vigor. On Scholar’s
Day one outstanding senior student in each
ﬁeld is awarded the Sigma Kappa Phi medal;
recipients of this year’s honor awards were:

French—Norman Winkler
German—Gisella Linder
Latin~Dorothy Perkins
Spanish—Helen Levy

SIGMA TAU

For a fraternity whose every effort is bent
toward preparing its members for a part in
the war effort, Sigma Tau managed to be one
of the largest socially minded fraternities of
its kind. Since its members are above average
junior and senior engineers who are participat-
ing in the University speed up program, this
is not surprising. The relaxation that these
students gained in their social affairs aided in
relieving the pressure of studying through the
three semesters last year.

Among the larger events of their social
season, the boys held a formal dance at the
Alcoma Country Club and a gala Monte Carlo
smoker. Every other Monday they held a
luncheon at which some prominent speaker or
a movie on some phase of engineering was
presented.

To encourage freshmen in the School of
Engineering, Sigma Tau presents, each year,
a bronze and a silver medal to the two top
scholastic freshmen.

Xylon, honorary journalism fraternity for
women, elects each year to membership
certain of those undergraduates who have
done outstanding writing on campus publica-
tions or those who have been recommended
for their work in courses in writing. Since
Journalism courses have been dropped by the
University for the duration of the war, Xylon
has become more than ever important in its
work of encouraging interest in commercial
writing.

This year members met twice a month.
The meetings were highlighted by the appear-
ances of outstanding people from the ﬁelds of
radio, newspapers, magazines, advertising and
publicity. Further to promote interest in

journalism, Xylon sponsored a writing contest
at Pitt. The fraternity also met for dinners
and bowling during vacations. Among the
group this year were such prominent pub-
lications personages as Viola Boydjieff, act-
ing editor of the Owl; Arline Chakmak, as-
sociate editor of the Owl; Elaine Kahn, sports
editor of the News; Alara Russell, editor of
the Oakland News; Lois Rowbottom, feature
editor of the News; Harriet Bauer, editor of
the Vade Mecum; Barbara Crouse, advisor to
the Publications Unit; and Rhea Mallinger,
winner of ﬁrst prize in Story magazine’s na-
tional contest. Julia Waida, who works in
the University News Service, was faculty
advisor to the organization.

CIVIL ENGINEERS

Recognizing the importance of engineers in
the war effort and the post-war world, the
Civil Engineers directed the activities of their
organization toward the war effort. Men
prominent in the engineering ﬁeld spoke before
the weekly seminars on topics dealing with
their ﬁeld as well as current and post-war
problems. Most of the students participated
in the University speed up program, foregoing
the usual vacation to attend the summer
semester classes held last year.

Snapping into the war effort with a vigor
that indicated their realization of the import-
ance of engineers today, the Mechanical
Engineers took the added work of the ac-
celerated program in easy stride. Some of
these engineers are now serving with the
armed forces and the present seniors have had
interviews with numerous ﬁrms with all of
them ready to step into industry and handle
important war work.

Constituting the largest engineering group
on campus, the Mechanical Engineers divide

......]AMEs REES

into two separate seminars the second semester
of each yearathe Mechanical Engineers and
the Aeronautical Engineers. The upper and
lower classmen have separate seminars.

Despite the increased tempo of activities,
social life was not overlooked. The A.E.’s
and M.E.’s did ﬁnd time to get together and
hold a dance. Not too much time was
devoted to social activity, though, for these
men concentrated on doing their share in the
home front defense of our nation.

Indicative of the urgent need by the armed
forces of the United States for trained pharma-
cists is the condition of Alpha Zeta Omega,
professional Jewish pharmaceutical fraternity.
The fraternity has suspended its activities
for the duration. Only one member of the
fraternity remains on campus, senior Marvin
Snyderman. No social events of any sort
were carried out by the fraternity. The last
event, and a signiﬁcant one at that, was held
in July 1942 when the national convention of

Alpha Zeta Omega was held in the Hotel
Roosevelt here in Pittsburgh. Lasting three
days, the convention was honored with an
address by Dean O’Conne1l. The conven-
tion concluded with a banquet and a dance.

Organized to promote the advancement of
pharmaceutical study, Alpha Zeta Omega
held twice monthly meetings until the call to
service depleted the ranks of the fraternity to
a few men. Members of the fraternity met
with the alumni chapter which is still active.

friend and adviser, Mr. D. D. Lessenberry,
Director of Courses in Commercial Education,
the fraternity recognizes scholarship in the

commercial ﬁeld and provides an opportunity

for students and faculty to meet in profes-
sional and social functions.

Activities were curtailed during the past
year to meet the war situation. There was
the fall rushing party and the initiation
banquet at the greystone manor, the spring
rushing party and initiation banquet at the
Arlington Apartments, and the annual get-
together held at Mr. Lessenberry’s farm.

The highest recognition which any mechan-
ical engineer at the University can receive is
to be tapped to Pi Tau Sigma. War-time
Pi Tau Sigma’s standards proved to be higher
than ever as new tappees attacked their
studies with renewed vigor. The boys didn’t
wait to get activities rolling. They took
advantage of the Summer Session to hold
some of their meetings at North Park. The
war did not effect the normal activities as

Pi Tau Sigma’s advanced engineers are de-
ferred until graduation. The Stoker, Me-
chanical Engineer’s newspaper, inaugurated in
1941, was continued by the fraternity. John
Fleissar and Maylor Miller represented the
Pitt chapter at the annual national conven-
tion this year. In addition to tapping to
membership deserving ME students, Pro-
fessor Berkwith was made an honorary
member.

The Delta chapter of Nu Sigma Nu,
national fraternity for medical students and
physicians, has joined the war effort in earnest.
Most of its members are now either in service
with the armed forces, in hospitals completing
their training or in the army reserve here
while they complete their studies. The
students of this fraternity are aware of the
importance of their profession in these war
days and their efforts are directed completely
toward preparing for service with the military
or on the home front.

Chapters of Nu Sigma Nu are established
only in class A medical schools. The Pitt

Delta chapter, one of the oldest fraternities on
campus, was established here in 1891. At
present, Nu Sigma Nu has 41 active chapters,
one inactive chapter and a membership well
over the 18,000 mark. Approximately 90
students here at the University are active in
the local chapter. In the past year, president
William Smale has directed the activity of
the local chapter toward increasing the tech-
nical proﬁciency of the students through
comradeship and good fellowship. The
services of these men are needed by our
country and when the time comes for them to
serve, the men of Nu Sigma Nu will be ready.

Phi Beta Pi, founded in Pittsburgh by a
group of 13 tolerance-minded medical students,
celebrated this year its ﬁftieth anniversary.
Begun as a protest against medico-political
abuse, the fraternity is, at present, one of the
largest professional medical fraternities in the
country. With 40 active chapters and a
membership of over 14,000, Phi Beta Pi
provides opportunity for non-technical
medical discussion in a friendly, open—minded
atmosphere.

To attain this end, members meet once a
month with doctors, professors of medicine,
and other leaders of the profession, to talk

over and consider with them practical
problems of medicine. Difficult points are
often explained with the aid of motion
pictures. Not neglecting the social side of
life, Phi Beta Pi members met throughout the
year at picnics, dances, and banquets. Phi
Beta Pi men, in common with other students
in the School of Medicine, are recognized as
being indispensible to the war effort. Conse-
quently, they have been granted deferments
which allow them to complete their studies.
In war or in peace, these men of medicine do
their part.

intervals.

The national membership of Phi Delta
Epsilon is over 7,000 men. There are 54
active chapters and four inactive chapters in
the fraternity roster. The Pitt Nu chapter
was established here at the University in
1911. With our country engaged in a global
war, the services of the men of Phi Delta
Epsilon will be needed for the duration of the
war and long afterwards. They are ready to
serve.

The Chi chapter of Phi Rho Sigma was
established here at the University in 1908.
It is one of 46 national chapters with a mem-
bership of over 14,000. Phi Rho Sigma exists
to promote the study of medicine and pro-
fessional ideals, to encourage friendly relation-
ships among men interested in the study of
medicine. Meetings are held each month at
which prominent members of the medical
profession speak to the membership about
newest developments in the profession.
Medical motion pictures are often used to
illustrate the talks. All members of Phi Rho
Sigma here at the University are enlisted in
the Army Specialized Training Program. In

addition to their regular program of studies
the men must participate in army drills and
studies.

Socially, Phi Rho Sigma holds occassional
parties and dances. The highlight of their
social season is the annual dance and Initiation
Banquet held this year at the Mayfair Hotel.

At the present time Phi Rho Sigma is
cooperating with the social fraternities on
campus and living at fraternity houses. If
the social fraternities should disband for the
duration it is likely that Phi Rho Sigma and
other medical fraternities will take over the
houses.

In the two years that Zeta Phi, women’s
professional medical fraternity, has been a
member of the medical school Interfraternity
Council, it has twice won the Scholars Plaque.
The Scholars Plaque is awarded annually to
the fraternity with the highest cumulative
grades of its members. Zeta Phi is the only
women’s fraternity in the School of Medicine.
All the women in the school are members
of the fraternity.

Zeta Phi was founded for the purpose of
affording the women in the School of Medicine
a social and educational society where the
women could get together. In the past year

prominent women in medicine addressed the
monthly dinner meetings, speaking about the
different branches of medicine which women
can enter.

The highlight of the fraternity’s social
season is the annual pledge dinner held to
honor the freshman women members. An
initiation banquet is held too. For the
coming year the women are planning a series
of bridge parties. Dr. Zoe Allison Johnson
one of the alumni sponsors of the fraternity
is the newly elected president of the County
Medical Society.

True scientists, the brothers of Kappa Psi
strive to increase their knowledge and to
beneﬁt their chosen profession—pharmacy.
Active in pharmacy already, they apply the
theory and observations learned in school to
their outside projects. At present, many
members of the fraternity are serving our
country in the Medical Administrative Corps
as well as at many ﬁeld and base hospitals.
Many graduate members of Kappa Psi hold
important offices in organizations which are
closely associated with pharmacy. The Pitts-
burgh chapter of Kappa Psi, founded here at
the University in 1913, is one of ﬁfty-one
collegiate chapters and thirty-ﬁve graduate

chapters of this national professional fra-
ternity.

The collegiate chapters have banded to-
gether to obtain endorsement of a blll in
Congress which would permit organization of
a Pharmacy Corps in the armed services.
Kappa Psi’s annual formal dance this year
climaxed a series of social events which in-
cluded a smoker held last semester, an in-
formal dance for graduating members, a
dinner dance, and a theatre party. Only
those men who rank in the upper third of the
School of Pharmacy are considered for mem-
bership in Kappa Psi. It is in an organization
like this one that our future leaders of science
are born.

In 1939 a group of girls in the pre-nursing
department organized Idaka, the honorary
pre-nursing sorority on campus, with the
object of becoming better acquainted with
each other and with their instructors before
entering the hospitals. The name Idaka, an
Indian Word meaning “to serve”, was chosen
because it is symbolic of and embodies the
ideals of the future profession of these women.
The members of Idaka visit the hospitals in
the medical center where they will get their

future training, and in the meantime, they are
helping in any way they can by rolling
bandages and making other supplies.

The accelerated program has greatly
affected Idaka and other pre-nursing students
by shortening the length of time that these
students will spend at Pitt. Instead of the
two full years, the work is completed in four
consecutive semesters including a summer
term. The result is that the much needed
nurses ﬁnish their training in less time.

Freedom of enterprise will always be a part
of the American way of life. It is with this
spirit of mind that future business men of the
Pitt day and evening school meet every Tues-
day evening at Alpha Kappa Psi meetings.
Alpha Kappa Psi, the only professional
business administration fraternity at the
University, is open to students with a 1.5
quality point average who show special ability
along business lines. At their meetings, held
at the Fort Pitt Hotel, there are presented
speakers, discussions, and movies. This year,
members of several of the downtown account-
ing ﬁrms, and a representative from the

Research Division of the Pittsburgh Press,
provided great interest.

Business men enjoy their social life, and
Alpha Kappa Psi does not slight this side of its
program. In September, Mr. C. Shepard, one
of the founders of the Pittsburgh chapter,
entertained the fraternity at his farm in New
Alexander. December 12, the chapter held
its annual fall banquet in conjunction with the
alumnae chapter of Pittsburgh. There,
formal initiation was held for new tappees.

Although Alpha Kappa Psi has given many
of its members to the armed forces it has
ﬁrmly resolved to continue training men to
run industry during and after the war.

While other organizations on campus
helped students to appreciate the material
aspects of a free American life, the Y.M.C.A.
helped students to develop a different freedom
. . . . freedom of spirit. The Y, in accomplish-
ing its purpose of “providing spiritual and
intellectual balance in campus life”, has
developed one of the largest and most active
organizations at the University.

This year, as in the past, the Y sponsored
the Pitt Town Meetings, the Freshman Club,
Monday Luncheon Forum, and social inquiry

groups.

Pitt students contributed their share
to the city—wide drive to collect athletic
equipment and musical instruments. A
booth was set up in the Commons Room
where the goods were turned in and a
special certiﬁcate of appreciation was pre-
pared for all those making contributions.

Sponsored by the International
Y.M.C.A. and with the co-operation of
the Red Cross, the equipment was col-
lected to provide the prisoners of war
with ways of occupying their minds and
their time. Previous arrangements were
made with the Red Cross for space on
supply ships to carry the goods to the
prison camps.

In keeping with the times, the Y kept its
attention on Christianity and its relationship
to the war. News-letters were sent regularly
to the camps; and the pamphlet “The Chris-
tian As A Soldier” was distributed on campus

not, however, eclipse the social season of

dances, parties, and hayrides.

The Young Women’s Christian Association
of the University of Pittsburgh has a place on
Pitt’s campus more important than ever
before. In this time of war, there is an in-
creased need of recognizing and practicing
those principles for which we are ﬁghting—
the principles of liberty and equality. The
Y. W. C. A., through its various activities is
helping a great deal in fostering and furthering
these ideals.

There is no distinction made in the Y. W.
C. A. as to race, color or creed; representatives
of all groups are cooperating in the Y’s ac-
tivities. The Y. W. C‘. A. was one of the ﬁrst
organizations on campus actively to take part

in the war effort by selling war bonds and
stamps. Along with their many other ac-
tivities the girls have found time to knit
mittens and. stockings, layettes and afghans,
which were given to the American Friends’
Service. The girls also cooperated with the
Y. M. C. A. in a number of joint activities the
purpose of which was to help inform the
student body of pertinent subjects and to
help keep up morale at home. The work of
these college women is an outstanding example
of the way in which Christians should live—
all races and creeds working together for true
democracy and for the peace after the war.

Music belongs to the steel framework of
morale, and the voices that sing of belief in the
good of man have a ﬁrm grip on the freedom
that embodies this good, the freedom of ex-
pression. The Choir sings every Sunday at
Heinz Chapel, an architectural expression of
the best that education can mean in material
and spirit. This has been the custom for
many years, but this music is more appreciated
at this time than ever before when the spirit
of the people needs relief from war time de-
pression. The Choir also sings for special
student services such as Freshman week,
Thanksgiving, Christmas, and Easter per-

formances. During the annual presentation
of Caritas they provide the musical back-
ground, adding much to the impressiveness
of the ceremony.

The innovation of Choir Camp, held at
Camp Pitt from September 17 to September
22, was a successful substitution for their

SPORTS

With our nation in the midst of a gigantic
war, Sports, not only at Pitt but at all other
colleges and universities, received a severe
blow in practically every department—trans-
portation, equipment and material, attend-
ance, and personnel, that is, players and
coaches. However, Pitt, along with many
other institutions, has managed to “weather
the storm” during the past school semesters.

On the gridiron we did not score as many
victories as we would have liked, but our team
displayed magniﬁcent spirit, that which is
typically American.

On the hardwood, though, we saw our
cagers come through with a most successful
campaign.

Most of the other sports here were forced
to be withdrawn, but only for the duration.

On the battle fronts many of these lads who
fought for the glory of the Blue and Gold will
combine their efforts with millions of other
valiant men to achieve the greatest victory of
them a1l—-PEACE and FREEDOM for the
Red, White, and Blue and the rest of
the world.

ON THE GRIDIRON

Glancing at the record, Coach Charles
Bowser’s last season at Pitt was neither
pleasant nor good. The Golden Panthers
opened the campaign with a pitiful perform-
ance against Minnesota, losing by 50-7. One
week later the Bowsermen bounced back,
whipping Southern Methodist, 20-7. Then
they reached their best form of the season in
the third game, holding the powerful Great
Lakes Naval School to a 6-7 win. The
Panthers came within a few minutes of up-
setting the Sailors but weakened in the dying
moments. After that game the boys never
again attained the form they displayed. They
lost to Indiana, Duke, and Ohio State on
successive Saturdays, the latter by a 59-19
count. In the two traditional-rivalry battles
Pitt split, beating Carnegie Tech and losing
to Penn State.

In losing six and winning three Bowser
equaled his 1941 record, except his boys did
not include among their wins anything quite
like the Fordham upset of 1941. The win
over Fordham was the most glorious achieve-
ment of Bowser’s four—year reign at Pitt.

Prior to his coming here, Bowser had been
coaching at several little colleges. Before
that he had served as an assistant coach here
under Jock Sutherland. At the close of the

 

COACH CHARLES BOWSER

1942 season Bowser resigned and enlisted in
the Navy. Although his reign here was not
too successful when judged solely in the light
of football victories, it is generally conceded
that he had had a difficult job and that he
had done the best he could under the circum-
stances and with the material at hand.

MINNESOTA 50 —— PITT 7

On September 26, 1942, C h a r 1 e y
B o w s e r took his Panther gridders to
Minneapolis where a Gopher juggernaut
steamrolled them with lightning precision.
The only ray of sunshine in this game
was Tony Di Matteo, who galloped 98
yards on a kickoff return for Pitt’s only
score. This was one of the worst drub-
bings ever handed a Pitt team.

PITT 20—SO. METHODIST 7

One week later, October 3, the battle-
bruised Panthers returned to their home
Stadium turf and amazingly bounced
back to trim the Mustangs. The locals
played sound, heads-up football for the
entire four quarters and won easily, with
Bill Dutton leading the attack. i The
season looked hopeful now.

GREAT LAKES 7 —PITT 6

October 10 found the once-victorious,
once-defeated Pittmen in Cleveland,
facing the Great Lakes Naval Training
Station eleven, which was sprinkled with
former collegiate stars. After holding
the powerful Sailors scoreless for 53
minutes and holding a 6-0 lead, the
Panthers succumbed to a late rush which
netted the Gobs a touchdown and the
extra point which gave them the victory.
The Gold and Blue was brilliant in defeat.

[248]

INDIANA 19 —PITT 7

A week following their magniﬁcent
stand against the. Great Lakes team,
October 17, the Jungle Cats came home
again to absorb another defeat. The
Panthers, badly battered, committed
some costly mistakes and the Hoosiers
immediately capitalized on them. Led
by Bill Hillenbrand, the Hoosiers passed
to victory.

DUKE 28 —— PITT 0

The Duke Blue Devils came to'Pitts-
burgh, October 24, and plastered the

rapidly-sinking Bowsermen with another.

licking. Although Bill Dutton played
his usual bang-up brand of ball, the team,
as a whole, displayed its poorest form ——
slip-shod tackling, shoddy blocking,
numerous fumbles, and lack of spirit.

PITT. 13 —— TECH 6

Carnegie Tech also experiencing one of
its poorest grid seasons in history, visited
the Stadium, October 31, and helped the
Panthers regain their winning ways.
The hapless Tartans put up a better
battle than most fans expected, but the
Pitt reserves plus a tougher schedule
grind paved the way for the win——an
unimpressive one.

[249]

OHIO STATE 59 —— PITT 19

On November 7, the Panthers, now
with another vistory to lift up their
morale, journeyed to Columbus to meet
another Western Conference nemesis,
Ohio State. The Buckeyes, who were
judged as the National Champions by
most football polls at the end of the
season, simply ran roughshod over the
Smokytown gridders. Piling up a 40-0
lead in one—half, the Bucks coasted in
easily, even though the Panthers staged
a mild rally in the last half .

PITT 6 — NEBRASKA O

For the second time during the season
the Panthers showed that they could
bounce back from a humiliating defeat*
this time against Nebraska on November
14. The Cornhuskers came to town with
a deﬂated eleven, too. Pitt, with Dutton
again spearheading the offensive, was the
superior club in what was a dull, dragging
exhibition.

PENN STATE 14—PITT 6

The ﬁnale found the Panthers at State
College on November 21. Although the
Lions were heavy favorites over the Cats,
they knew they were in a ball game.
With a break here or there the Panthers
might have won; regardless, they played
one of their best games. This concluded
the football season with only three wins
as against six losses.

[250]

CLARK D. SHAUGHNESSY

One of the biggest stories of the Pitts-
burgh sports year came with the an-
nouncement that Pitt has signed Clark
D. Shaughnessy to direct its football
fortunes. He succeeded Charles Bowser
who resigned following another dismal
grid season. Shaughnessy becomes the
ﬁrst non—Pitt graduate to take over the
head coaching reins here, breaking the
tradition for the ﬁrst time.

Shaughnessy came to Pitt with thirty
years of coaching experience behind him.
After graduating from Minnesota, he held
coaching berths at Tulane, Loyola.
Chicago, Stanford, and the University
of Maryland. It was at Stanford that
he achieved his most remarkable record,
leading his team to ten straight victories
in his ﬁrst season on the Coast. His
Stanford Indians also copped the Rose
Bowl game that year.

The new coach comes to Pitt at a time
most critical for all sports. Many
athletes have been called into the Armed
Services . . . many more expect to go
before the next season opens. However,
Shaughnessy has pledged himself to give
Pitt a football team as long as he can put
eleven men in uniform. And the student
body is going to back him up all the way.

BASKETBALL

In all his twenty years of coaching
basketball at Pitt, “Doc” Carlson stated
that he had never had the pleasure of
handling a ﬁner bunch of boys than the
past season’s squad. These cagers, who
compiled one of the best records here in
recent years, were merely “kids” who
loved to play the game. They did not
know the meaning of defeat—certain1y
emblematic of America.

Out of this crop blossomed diminutive
Bobby Artman, who, along with Clair
“Tay” Malarkey, captained the team.
Both boys proved to be two of the
smoothest sharpshooters in Pitt history.
Malarkey paced his teammates in scoring,
while Artman came a close second. Paul
Lohmeyer, John Swacus, and Walter
Jones rounded out the other three posi-
tions on the classy Panther quintet which
bettered the record of last year’s team
with victories to spare.

Call them “kids”, or “ice-cream
eaters”, or even “rinky dinks”, if you
wish, but Uncle Sam will make them he-
men Americans if and when he casts his
priorities on them.

Last Row—Vaiksnor, Palanzo, Nabors, Ranii, McKee, Jacobs, Coach Mitterling, Brown.

Planning ahead despite today’s un-
certainties is Pitt’s baseball mentor Ralph
Mitterling. Beginning in early March Mitter-
ling is calling his diamondeers together to begin
practice sessions for the coming season.
Expected to be back in the fold this season
are lefthanded-pitcher Bill McKee, the main-
stay of last season’s mound staff, and second-
baseman Ed Fisher, who hit well over .300.

Mitterling must build a team from few
returning performers who saw little or no
action last year. Those who have been lost,

either through graduation or call to service,
include Brown, Jacobs, Ranii, Vaiksnor, Mc-
Cullough, Kostenbauder, Wilk, Zukas, Wil-
liams, and Feldstein.

Last season the Panthers won only four
games while dropping eight. With that record
in mind and the fact that few are back to play
this season, it looks rather gloomy for Mitter-
ling and the Pitt baseballers. However,
Americans have never viewed tough assign-
ments pessimisticly . . . and Mitterling is no
exception.

As in every other organization, the war has
made some important changes in the function-
ing of Women’s Athletic Association. This
year the athletic association opened its social
calendar by substituting an informal picnic
party. given for freshman women in the
Cathedral gym, for the traditional Bal
Mistique. Also included in the social itiner-
ary were a “Hard Times dance”, a “Farewell
Afternoon dance” for the Pitt men that were

being inducted into the services, and a skating
party.

Because of the war, physical ﬁtness was
emphasized to a greater extent than ever
before. A new program was introduced con-
sisting of active sports and calisthentics,
recommended under the government’s plan
for physical ﬁtness. A schedule of competi-
tive activities for women which included
bowling, basketball, and volleyball was drawn

As a
part of the “health for living” program, hikes,

OTHER SPORTS

Athletic events at Pitt this past semester
have suffered severely due to the war. Most
of the boys who jogged cross—country and
executed backhand drives over the net last
year are now in uniform; the coaches who
trained our boys are giving their time, energy,
and talents towards a victorious termination
of the war; and transportation is almost im-
possible. These obstacles, when combined
with the Army’s arrival here, stymied any
plans that had been made for this spring and
summer. There was only one alternative
open to the Athletic Department—to drop
most of the minor sports.

With Coach Carl Olson’s departure to serve
as a Lieutenant-Commander in the Navy and
with only a few boys turning out for track,
Pitt could hardly hope to compete in inter-
collegiate meets, i.e., Penn State, Army, and
Penn Relays. Indoor track was dropped

altogether.

The swimming team found itself in exactly
the same predicament. Coach Ben Grady
was commissioned as a Lieutenant Junior-
Grade in the Navy, and although Captain
Gus Wilde was appointed to coach in Grady’s
place, the lack of transportation, material to
work with, and opponents to meet ruled out
any chance of building a good team this
season. However, the mermen will attempt
to carry on in a smaller way.

The Varsity and R.O.T.C. riﬂe teams
started another season under the direction of
Major Wills and his two assistants, Captain
Havlak and Sergeant Daehnke. Bruno
Cengia, veteran senior, is the captain of the
Varsity shooters.

Tennis and Golf were placed on the in-
deﬁnite list because of the possibility that the
Army may take over exclusive rights to the
courts, ﬁelds, and equipment.

nine ’til one A. M. Following out a Halloween theme, the panels
about the ballroom were hung with large skeletons and musical
instruments.

Hugh Chavern and Tee Nash, publicity agents of the dance,
and business manager, William Brown were in large measure re-
sponsible for the huge turnout at the dance. The day before the
big event, the Soph Hop committee held a tea dance to publicize
it. Most of the students who came to the dance, came by street
car or taxi, saving gasoline for the war effort. Following the Uni-
versity ruling, the dance was informal with Corsages and extravagent

favors banned. These limitations added to the enjoyment of the

dance. The success of the Soph Hop showed the way to the dances
that followed.

“Anchors Aweigh” was the countersign at the Junior Prom as
couples passed over the gangplank into the crowded Silver Ball-
room of the Hotel William Penn. The date was January ﬁfteenth,
and the orchestra providing the music for the evening was Jan
Savitt’s. To carry out the nautical theme, the decorations com-
mittee constructed a huge gangplank at the ballroom entrance,
strung blue and white life preservers around the balcony, and manu-
factured silver smoke funnels to adorn the band platform. From
the balcony fluttered the many banners of the Allied Nations. The
dance committee, headed by chairman Howard York, business
manager Lee McFadden, and publicity manager Al Minno, sent
complimentary invitations to commissioned officers in the United
States Navy and the Waves, who were stationed in the Pittsburgh
area. Cooperating with the Office of Price Administration, the
dancers came by streetcar and taxi. Howard York and Marion
Harris led the dance, which was one of the most successful of the
year. In fact, there was such an over—capacity crowd that the

committee was concerned with the possibility of violating the ﬁre

rules and regulations.

“Babes In Arms” was an appropriate title for the freshman
dance in this war year when so many of the freshmen are interrupt-
ing their educational pursuits to join the armed services. Hugh
Clemmer, chairman of the affair, and Virginia King led the Ball
which was held April 2 in the Schenley Hotel. Following out the
theme, the ballroom was decorated with pastel streamers like baby
ribbons and illustrated Mother Goose Nursery Rhymes that adorned
the walls. Brad Hunt and his orchestra supplied the music for a
capacity crowd that jitterbugged and glided across the jammed
dance floor all evening from 9 ’til 1 o’clock. Soft drinks were
available at the soda bar in the room adjoining the ballroom. The
dance, planned and carried out by committees headed by Hugh

Clemmer and Bob Lazar, business manager, was one of the most

successful of the school year.

To the music of the Tech Scotch and Soda Band, the Inter-

The dance, led by chairman William Greenblatt and Shirley Shefﬂer,
was held in the Hotel Schenley Continental Room, April 16. In
line with the University ruling against formal affairs, the dance was
informal. No decorations were used and no favors distributed.
Next to the dancing the main event of the evening was the award-
ing of the Interfraternity Sweepstakes Prizes. The Phi Gams,
for the third consecutive year, were awarded the Interfraternity
Trophy making them the possessors for the duration. The interest
of the fraternities in the awards and the desire to participate in
this last large social function of the school year made the Inter-

fraternity Ball a well attended function. Business manager Howard

Coburn had cause to be pleased with the results.

The members of Panhellenic Council were determined to have
their annual dance this spring in spite of the gas rationing, the
decrease in the number of men, and the university temporary
ruling of no formals for the duration of the war.

This year, on May 1, Panhel broke traditions by having the
dance informal, and by banning all corsages. There were no dec-
orations other than those of the impressive black, white, and gold of
the Urban Room at the William Penn Hotel. Here, to the strains
of “Black Magic”, Bill Leroy and his orchestra began the evening’s
dancing which was led by chairman Lois Miller and her date
Jim DeGarmo. Another difference noted was the large percentage
of cadet candidates present, their khaki uniforms adding to the
wartime atmosphere. In the lobby and the elevators at the close
of the dance at 12:00, many Panhel escorts expressed their admir-

ation for the efforts of the fraternity women to make the Pan-

hellenic Dance of 1943 a great success.

ment that Westinghouse has designed
and built especially to make American
carriers outstanding engines of de-
struction:

* Steam turbines, compact in size,
yet so powerful they drive our new
carriers fzzster than any enemy
carrier aﬂoat.

* Elevators big enough to hold a
bomber, fast enough to deliver a
plane to the deck with minimum
delay.

* Intricate radio equipment spe-
cially designed to stand up under
the shock of battle.

Westinghouse “know how” is being
applied—not only to aircraft carriers
-—but to nearly every type of ship in
our Navy.

In this, as in all phases of Westing-
house wartime activity, the long-range
work of our Research and Engineer-
ing Laboratories has played a signi-
ﬁcant part. Discoveries in many ﬁelds
are now bearing fruit in the pro-
duction of better and more powerful
weapons of war.

Many of these discoveries, we be-
lieve, will someday help to make a
better peacetime world.

DOLLARS FOR SECURITY

The dollars which are being sent ahead today through life insurance are serving
a two-fold purpose . . .

They are providing protection and security for individual policyholders and
at the same time‘ are working toward ﬁnancing the War in which we are now
engaged.

The Pan—American Life Insurance Company, during 1942 alone, invested
$2,000,000.00 in bonds of the United States Government, representing more
than twice the amount received in premiums on new life insurance written.

A LETTER TO THE VALVE AND FITTING INDUSTRY

January 14, 1943.

The valves and steel ﬁttings which you produce are needed more than
almost any other single component in the production of ships, and for the
construction of plants to manufacture synthetic rubber and high octane gasoline
—all essential to a successful prosecution of the war. The strategic plans that
have been made by this Nation call for the maximum war effort, and this
applies with special emphasis to the valve and steel ﬁttings industries.

Sincerely yours,
C. E. WILSON,

Production Vice Chairman,
War Production Board.

RINKING WATER IS SCARCE in North
Africa. And what there is, is likely to
be bad.

So before our soldiers landed there, they
were weaned away from water. A dash of
iodine in their drinking water served the
double purpose of disinfecting it, and making
it taste awful.

By the time the boys landed in Africa, they’d
lost all taste for water except in safe, prepared
drinks.

The favorite prepared drink is lemonade.
Field Ration K provides it—along with veal,

SAVE WITH U.S. WAR BONDS

EVERYBODY...EVERY PAYDAY. . .

This man was taught not 1'0 drink wafer

pork, sausage, coffee, bouillon, malted milk
tablets, biscuits, chocolate, and chewing gum-
all in a 53-ounce pack.

Sounds like somebody was taking pretty
good care of our boys, doesn't it? And that’s
right. American soldiers are the best-fed,
best-equipped, best-cared-for in the world.

But keeping them that way takes money.
So much money, that, to help pay for it, every
one of us must [mm at least 10% of his income
to Uncle Sam through War Bonds.

War Bonds are a swell investment. They
pay you back $4 for every 353. Save at least
10% of every paycheck with U. S. War Bonds.

“How you safeguard Estate

and Trust Funds in your care?”

E, like most farsighted citi-

zens these days, is more in-
terested in protecting the capital
he leaves than in preﬁguring fu-
ture interest rates.

To assure safety of principal,
estate funds should be kept under
constant review by a competent
organization. The executor and
trustee should be given authority
to sell or re-invest as and when
conditions change.

When to buy and when to sell
calls for experienced judgment.

Many individuals lack it. Trust In-
stitutions are in a position to give
it. Speaking for ourselves, eternal
watchfulness is the watchword of
our trust business.

Is the future protection of your
property uppermost in your mind?

If so, we invite you to investi-
gate our methods of investing and
handling the estate funds left in
our care as executor and trustee.
It goes without saying that this
invitation implies no commitment
on your part.

Industry Faces Forward

 

Research Program No. I 30 resulted in de-
signing and constructing these motor driven
machines to test steel for resistance to corrosion
fatigue. A development of our research labor-
atories, the fatigue machines are an example of '
engineering skill solving today’s problems with
an eye on tomorrow.

We’re fighting a war and building for peace
| on a foundationkof technical knowledge.

Each improved piece of equipment, each
operation increased in efficiency is a step for-
ward towards victory and a new world at
peace.

Keeping abreast in this forward march, our
tube mills have converted from the production
of oil country goods to the production of war A
goods——bombs, shells, gun parts, tank axles,
airplane propeller blades. Of course, we still
make pipe to keep the oil flowing to our war
machine.

We offer mechanical, metallurgical and re-
search engineers the opportunity to devote their
abilities to the war effort and at the same time
establish themselves in an industry which looks
forward to peacetime expansion.

CHAN CELLOR BOWMAN

Through the planning and effort of a man who commands the
respect of all who know and admire him, the Cathedral of Learning,
the heart of our University, was made possible. But, the realiza-
tion of Chancellor Bowman’s dreams was not ﬁnished when the
skyscraper was completed, for the administration of this building
hadpto be efﬁcient. In addition to the normal problems he must
face, the Chancellor launched in 1942 a tremendous war—effort pro-
gram—accelerated schedules, defense courses, university defense,
and many school drives relating to this effort. Everything is being
done to place the University at the fullest possible service to the
country. Dr. Bowman’s philosophy is that students are inﬂuenced
by their surroundings, and with that thought in mind, he planned
the Cathedral of Learning, including the popular Commons Room.
However, he believes that just as important as the building are the
lights of character in the faces of both students and teachers.
Because of his high ideals and understanding of people and their
problems, students and faculty alike respect the man who has made
the University just what it is.

Dr. Bowman, who came here in 1921, succeeding Samuel
Black McCormack, immediately met and defeated two ready—made
problems: (1) the school’s heavy debt-load, and (2) the need to
ﬁnd room for the school’s tripled post-war population. Acting
as his own salesman, he pleaded, argued, demanded funds of Pitts-
burgh’s civic leaders. They were impressed. Since then the
University has had no deﬁcit, and has not suffered from over-
crowding.

To those who know Chancellor Bowman, the ﬁreside chats
are the key to his character, the Cathedral of Learning the key to
his dreamings. The Cathedral is a reflection of the man himself;
it is tall, lean, straight, and digniﬁed, symbolizing life and education
at a zenith. Neither the Cathedral nor Chancellor Bowman is the
Past; both are the Future.

ADMINISTRATION

DR. JOHN WEBER

A Pitt graduate, Dr. Weber has been
here to see many new developments
progress. Since 1910 he has advanced
from instructor, professor, head of the
engineering department to his present
position as secretary of the University.
As supervising engineer, he helped to
build the Cathedral of Learning, and
traveled widely over Europe to select the
stained glass windows which have made
Pitt’s Heinz Chapel world famous.

 

MR. RUFUS FITZGERALD

“He is always willing to chat with you.”
That one sentence may explain why our
vice—chancellor is so well liked. At the
farewell party given for the reserves who
left for military service in March of this
year, Mr. Fitzgerald was there to shake
each boy’s hand. It is not hard for Pitt
students to understand why his former
students at Iowa State purchased his
chair when he left them and sent it to
our University. No one else can ﬁll
Mr. Fitzgerald’s chair at Iowa, Pitt or
anywhere.

MR. J. GILBERT QUICK

Twice every year, Mr. Quick, registrar
to the University, is recognized as the
busiest man on campus. His job, how-
ever, does not stop when the Commons
Room lights are dimmed after registra-
tion and he returns to the eighteenth
floor. Efﬁcient “J. G.” compiles enroll-
ment ﬁgures, arranges schedules, inter-
views applicants for scholarships to the
University, and “edits” those popular
blueprints.

A
IN APPRECIATION

Between the covers of this 1943 Owl is a record of a year of
many changeswa record made possible by the invaluable coopera-
tion and suggestions of friends both in and outside the University.
It is to these friends who have faithfully helped to ﬁll this thirty-
eighth volume with lasting memories that the staff expresses its
sincerest appreciation and gratitude.

OFFICE OF THE DEAN OF MEN

As the men of the University are related to
the war, so is the office of the Dean of Men.
The college objective of our men today is to
discipline their minds and bodies in order to
better execute their obligations to their
country. In addition to other duties, includ-
ing the supervision of activities, housing,
employment and social fraternities, Dean
Theodore W. Biddle and his assistants Mr.
Lawrence E. Irwin and Mr. Roy H. Umble
are helping to prepare Pitt men to face these
military and civilian responsibilities. A
former assistant, Mr. Robert L. Arthur, is
now serving our country as a lieutenant in

Senior Court, the judiciary body of the
Women’s Self Government Association, was
organized to act as a court, to establish and
interpret just laws, and to be a general “clear-
ing house” for all women’s activities. It aids
W. S. G. A. in fostering a spirit of loyalty to
the University, in creating a public opinion
sympathetic with the University ideal for
women students, and in promoting fellowship
between faculty, administration and the
students, and in co-ordinating the organized
activities of women into a uniﬁed whole.

Chief Justice Ruth Cox and her six justices
have met once a week throughout the year and
have worked conscientiously to keep on Pitt
campus that same justice for which the whole
world is ﬁghting. Besides serving as the
nominating committee of W. S. G. A. and
having charge of campus selections for women,
Senior Court has served as hostess for the
Chancellor’s ﬁre side chats and teas which
have been popular with the university
students.

EVENING SCHOOL ASSOCIATION

A call to service or a full-time work program
in one of the district’s war industries caused
many evening school students to temporarily
discontinue their studies. Hundreds of eager
and ambitious young men and women who
had labored after dusk in Cathedral classrooms
did not return. Despite the missing faces,
a loyal body of evening school students, many
of whom were taking war essential courses, sup-
ported the Evening School Association in
carrying out a full schedule of activities. In
keeping with their avowed purpose, “to ad-

vance social interests and promote the general
welfare of the student body,” the association
held open house in the Commons Room at the
beginning of the fall and spring semesters.
Beneath the calm arches, old and newly
acquainted friends discussed current problems.
Thanksgiving and Spring dances highlighted
the social calendar with a farewell dance and
dinner party closing the social season. E.S.A.
this year continued to publish the Pitt
Evening News which was eagerly awaited by
all the students.

Our Democracy is founded on the principle
of government by the people, and we at Pitt
govern ourselves. Our agency is the Student
Faculty Association, consisting of 32 students
popularly elected by the student body and
10 faculty men and women. With Gus
Wilde and Aldo Icardi guiding the law body
this year, S. F. A. maintained student morale
through its sponsored projects. Rallying
around the “Jeep A Week” slogan, the sale of
stamps and bonds every Wednesday became
S.F.A.’s most ambitious setup~one that
netted large returns to the federal govern-
ment.

In an effort to bring the war closer to
campus, S.F.A. staged three important pro-
grams. October 7 found ﬁve young war
heros visiting the school and addressing the
student body. In cooperation with Pitt
Town Meeting, an International Students’
Day was held in November, and the eventful
Pearl Harbor commemoration climaxed the
season a month later. In keeping with the
times, S.F.A. had fewer dances, less preten-
tious pep rallies, but the spirit was there, the
old college spirit prevailed. Petty political
squabbling forgotten, S.F.A. made sure that
government for the people shall not perish . . .

Emergency Student Government Committee

 

PRESIDENT BERLAND

The newest combination of letters to be-
come familiar to Pitt students this year was
ESGC known by its full title as the Emergency
Student Government Committee. ESG was
organized when the Student—Facu1ty Associa-
tion was disbanded, in order that it might
devote more time to and take better care of
student activities for the duration of the war.

It was decided to discontinue S. F. A. because
the tenure of the men students who were
members of this organization was uncertain,
so many were leaving for military services.
During the year, ESGC met at least once a
week to discuss problems of student govern-
ment.

The biggest event of the year which ESGC
sponsored was the Farewell Party held in the
Commons Room for the Reservists. The
army reservists who were to leave in March
were the guests of honor of the faculty and
student body.

Later a Book Drive was sponsored in order
to make a collection of contemporary books
to send to the boys in the armed forces both
at home and abroad. Next came the Red
Cross Drive climaxed by a dance, the pro-
ceeds of which were given to the Red Cross.
After the arrival of the cadets, a clothes
hanger drive was introduced by ESGC to help
cut down pressing bills for the Cadet Candi-
dates quartered at the University.

Finally, ESGC helped Spring Festival and
its varied activities bring the school’s social
year to a successful close.

S1'tting—Esther Berland.
Standing—Mavrinac, Sullivan, McFadden, and Wilde.

“Hear Ye.’ Hear Ye! Hear Ye!”

“Ye Pitt men are summoned to exhibit your
activities on ye oId campus before this body.
Ye shall be judged for merit and thy judgment
shalt be in our hands.”

If Men’s Council Prexy, Art Thompson,
were chief justice of a little colonial court in
the colony of Pennsylvania, he would have
used these words to express the duties of his
organization for the Men’s Council reserves
ﬁnal authority in the administration of most
men’s activities on campus. It is Men’s
Council which annually holds Honor Court
in Foster Memorial to award golden panther
keys to freshmen with a high average and
several activities. To seasoned upper class-
men, Men’s Council has meant a fair deal in
securing second hand books at the Book
Exchange. It was this organization which
helped the war effort by organizing a “35
Mile per Hour” Club and enrolling over two
thousand members to help conserve rubber
and gas. The council took over the sale of
war bonds and stamps for several weeks.

COLLEGE ASSOCIATION

Under the able direction of Harriet Harris,
College Association this year continued its
wide program of coordinating college activities
so that each student in the college would feel
that he was a part of the Association and its
work. The Student Loan Fund, whereby any
student enrolled in the College may borrow
money for tuition through a non—interest
bearing, short term loan, continued to be the
outstanding work carried on by College As-
sociation.

Social activities of College Association
began with a “Bar For A Tar” tea dance held
on October 7 and chairmaned by Al Minno.
Admission to the dance was thirty—ﬁve cents
and each person was required to bring a candy
bar. The candy was collected and given to
the Red Cross to be shipped to naval bases
throughout the world where it was distributed
to our sailor boys. Shortly before the Christ-
mas holidays, College Association held its last
tea dance for the duration of the war.

College Association functioned until April
13 when the cabinet voted to suspend ac-
tivities until the University again was on a
peacetime program. This move was taken
because the members felt that their work was
not important enough to a University gearing
itself for wartime education; their duties
could be performed by the newly established
ESGA.

V Professor of English, Dr. W. George
Crouch was faculty advisor to College Asso-
ciation.

PRESIDENT I-IALDEMAN

Organized at Pitt in 1920, Women’s Self
Government Association fulﬁlls the real mean-
ing of its name and gives the women an active
part in university life over and above their
education. Its real function is to take a
vital part in the governing of women of the
school, to unite them in true friendships, and
to increase their knowledge of human relation-
ships.

This year W. S. G. A. was confronted with
a new problem, that of aiding women students
to continue their regular work in a world at
war. In order to facilitate the work of W. S.
G. A., the War Activities committee was
established to ﬁnd what women could do to
help the war effort and then to organize groups
to carry out this work.

Under the presidency of Betty Haldeman,
the executive committee of W. S. G. A. met
every Tuesday to discuss both new and old
business, and to make changes or establish
new policies when necessary.

An important change this year was the estab-
lishment of Women’s Day to take the place of
the customary Inter-Class Sing. Countess
Zamojska, head of the women’s division of
the Inter-Allied Information Service, spoke on
“Women in the United Nations”, after which
all women attended small conference groups
on war jobs for college women and the train-
ing necessary for such work.

Changes were also made in the functioning
of freshman women’s activities units. The
units, as they had been organized previously,
were abolished, and a newer, more efficient
form was substituted. The ten upperclass
advisors to the women’s groups are to be
chosen by University organizations instead

of being appointed by Senior Court as they
had been formerly, i.e., the publications’ ad-
visor being selected by the publications’
board. In addition to this revision, a new
system is being formulated by which fresh-
man women will be able to participate in the
activities of a number of units rather than a
single unit during the semester. The latter
change was made in an effort to give freshman
women an opportunity to understand better
the organizations of all University extra-
curricular activities and thereby help them to
determine where their interests lay. Alto-
gether, the plan proves to be much sounder
and more efﬁcient than the former one.

Panhellenic Council operates under basic
principles that are much like our own Con-
stitution. It is composed of two representa-
tives from each of the women’s fraternities.
These members handle all fraternity matters
through intelligent discussion and with a
spirit of cooperation, for only by expressing
opinion freely can democracy and justice
endure. The council directs fraternity pro-
cedures and makes a few rules for the common
good of all fraternities. Not only do the
fraternities as a Whole beneﬁt from the council
government, but also the individual fraternity

women. They come to understand the funda-
mentals of law, and through a better under-
standing of them, they become better citizens.

Justice is often cold and impersonal and
too harshly applied; justice should be ad-
ministered with a deep understnading and
tempered with warmth. Through Pan-
hellenic Council, the women of the University
are schooling themselves in the ways of
justice; they are sustaining and preserving
this inherent right of ours, and by upholding
it are making sure that it shall never perish
in our land.

Interfraternity Council during the ﬁrst
semester of the year was under nearly normal
condition with fraternity membership showing
the greatest increase since 1937. Later, the
problems began to mount up. VVith reserve
and R.O.T.C. students called up for service,
the members going directly into the armed
forces, fraternities had to adjust their program
to meet the situation. Interfraternity Council
led the way by presenting answers to these
problems. Plans were made, and are in the
process of being carried out, to help fraternities

leave the campus during the next semester
with their charters intact, books clear, and a
program ready to aid their return to the
campus. Socially, Interfraternity Council re-
mained active. The highlight of the social
season was the annual IF Ball held at the
Hotel William Penn. It was at this function
that fraternity men displayed their patriotism
by bringing their dates to the dance on street
cars and buses. In the IF intramural All-
Point trophy race, the Phi Gams led the ﬁeld,
at the time of this writing.

“To create a closer fellowship among
Engineering and Mines students of the Uni-
versity, to provide opportunities for contact
with professional and non—professional men,
and to add to the social life of the Engineering
and Mines school” are the aims of this cabinet.
Each department in the Enginnering and
Mines school is represented in the cabinet.
One Junior and one Senior from each of these
departments is named to the cabinet which is

the governing body of the Engineering and
Mines school.

A lounge where Engineering and Mines
students can relax between classes was opened
last year. A previous cabinet had established
a sinking fund for the creation of the lounge
and the present cabinet completed the work.
After the war, the cabinet hopes to expand
the facilities of the lounge.

The cabinet was active in promoting
social events. Two smokers and two dances
were held. The ﬁrst dance this year was held
at the popular Grotto. The second dance,
held on April 30 in the Hotel Schenley, drew
a large attendance. The music was provided

departmental smoker was a highlight this

Both in the Bill of Rights of the Constitu-
tion of the United States and President
Roosevelt’s statement of the Four Freedoms,
the freedom of speech is speciﬁcally men-
tioned.

It is to the preservation of the Freedom of
Speech and to the development of intelligent
discussion, both of which are basic in the fight
for freedom, that Women’s Speech Associa-
tion is dedicated.

This year’s program evolved about this
end: by discussion within the University
among Pitt students; through the Inter-City
Discussion League whose membership in-
cludes college students in the Pittsburgh
vicinity; by presenting programs for com-
munity organizations. Thus the Association
is endeavoring to develop within the Uni-
versity and community alert and progressive
thinking.

Organized as an integral part of the Key
Center of War Information sponsored by the
United States government, Women’s Speech
Association is reaching into the community
through civic and religious groups and through
high schools, presenting programs with special
emphasis on What We Are Fighting For,
Cicil Liberties, Elements Of The Good
Neighbor Policy, and Problems OfA Post-
War World.

Presenting Caritas with the YWCA and
the Beaux Arts program, My Country, with
the Women’s Choral and the Modern Dance
group, the value and beauty of the Freedom
of Speech has been further realized. The
Women’s Speech Association sponsored a
Women’s assembly in cooperation with other
Women’s organization on campus presenting
an opportunity for them to revaluate their
aims in a nation at War.

Freedom of speech has long been given a
liberal interpretation by Pitt’s energetic de-
baters. In the past those who laid down a
barrage of words on the 16th ﬂoor of the
Cathedral never suffered from lack of ammu-
nition. This year, however, new signiﬁcance
has been added to the words upon which
debaters thrive. Men’s Debate arranged a
schedule of close cooperation with the newly
formed War Information Center at the Uni-
versity. Speeches were planned, symposiums
arranged, and debates prepared for the pur-
pose of encouraging intelligent thought and
discussion about our war effort and the post-
war world. Pitt’s future orators made these
available to churches, Rotary clubs, schools,

and other organizations throughout the
district.

The greater amount of work and the add-
ed importance of its Work did not stop the
debate group from successfully planning their
annual competitive events. Thirty high
schools from the vicinity attended the High
School Tournament which featured this year,
beside the numerous debates, a competitive
discussion contest with prizes awarded to the
winners. In January, numerous district col-
leges were invited to participate in a deci-
sion tournament at Pitt on the subject-Re-
solved, the United Nations shall establish a
federal union at the close of this war.

FEAR

Even though the Business Administration ofﬁces have been
moved from the thirteenth to the twenty—sixth ﬂoor to accommodate
the army, students are riding up the added ﬂights to talk over their
problems or to have a friendly chat with Dean Vincent W. Lanfear,
who efﬁciently heads the department.

He realizes how important it is that trained people be prepared
to go into the ﬁeld of Business Administration, especially in war
time, and he does his utmost to help students plan careers in this
ﬁeld. Since many of the male students have left the department
to join the armed forces, an increased number of coeds have taken
their places to study commerce, accounting and the many other
courses offered by the department.

SENIORS

THE COLLEGE

Many students in the College this year are
really walking to get an education. They are
seen hurrying up to State and Alumni Halls
to new classrooms, due to Army occupation
of most of the Cathedral of Learning. The
College, headed by Dean Stanton C. Craw-
ford, has seen no drastic changes in the war-
time curriculum. However, many more
students are now taking courses in govern-

DR. STANTON C. CRAWFORD

ment services and even the coeds are taking
their chances with mathematics.

Dean Crawford believes that young people
must be given every opportunity for working
out their own careers. During the present
uncertain times, however, he is capably
directing their efforts toward useful war—time
and post-war pursuits, with the ultimate hope
that they will ﬁt smoothly into existing
tumultuous world affairs.

SCHOOL OF

EDUCATION

The School of Education, with Dean Elinar
W. Jacobson at its head, is an important part
of the University. Most of the studies given
in the school have remained the same for this
year, but the department has added a new
course in pre—aeronautics which many students
have found interesting as well as helpful. It
has been especially so for those boys who will

DR. ELINAR W. JACOBSON

soon take their places in our country’s Air
Corps.

Dean Jacobson is a ﬁrm believer in the Am-
erican educational ideals and has incorporated
these in his many writings. Through his
friendly informal ways with the students, Dean
Jacobson has made many friends and has
been extremely helpful to these future teachers.
