The Cmnmons Room Gates

THROUGH
THE PORTALS

ACH DAY AT PITT we have passed through many portals into
the many worlds that, gathered together, are the University.
Because we have gone in and out of these doorways so many
times, we have come to look at them without seeing; yet each
doorway has come to have for us a meaning. When we return
to Pitt in years to come, the sight of a familiar doorway will recall
experiences we knew on the other side of thatdoor. The carved door
of a Nationality Room, the heavy, iron-studded door of the Chapel,
the glass-panelled door of a dean's ofﬁce, a noble Gothic arch in the
Commons Room, the ugly, black door to an unﬁnished classroom-
each has come to have an association with the world it opens into.

And so to tie together our story of the year '47-’48 we have used
the doorways of Pitt as our theme.

For our frontispiece we have chosen the wrought—iron gates of
the Commons Room, gates “to the love of wisdom, and to days rich
in living.” In their craftsmanship and their delicacy of design, they
signify the beauty, the inspiration, and the high purpose that we found
in the University. Often, as we have walked through these gates, our
eyes have been drawn upward by the subtle rhythms of the framing
arch to the inscription that crowns the gates and completes the har-
mony of hammered iron -and written word. Surely,as the inscription
reads, “Here is eternal Spring. For you the very stars of Heaven are

7!

new.

Between the covers of this book, then, we have tried to capture
the spirit that is beyond the doors, the spirit that is Pitt. If we have
succeeded only a little, then we will have accomplished the purpose
of our year’s work. i

We hope that on these pages you, the student, will ﬁnd a re-
‘minder of the joys, the problems, and the friendships of your own
college life; we hope, too, that in this voluine others who are not stu-
dents will find an appreciation and understanding of the love which
we, the students, have for Pitt.

Dr. John Cabbert Bowman

LTHOUGH EACH DAY in a Pitt student's

life was spent as a part of Dr. John G.

Bowman’s dream come true, few students

in 1948 remembered the man whose

_ faith raised the Cathedral of Learning.

President Honorarius he is now, living in retirement at

VVater Brook Farm in Bedford County. From the

farm, which he planned as a retreat from days crowded

with activity in the embodying of ideals in stone and

iron, come growing pines for the Commons Room at

Christmas and hopes always that the University

continues to grow in the shadow of the 42-story
Cathedral.

A Gothic building he wanted, simple and un-

-17

adorned, but with each parallel line reaching upward
toward the Heavens, forever elusive as a goal. A
symbol of education he wanted in which there could be
no ending. The building grew until, when he retired
from active work in 1944 after 23 years at Pitt, the
Cathedral of Learning had become a showplace of a
proud city. Dr. Bowman planned a building which a
man, whatever his station in life, might look up to
and say, “My son shall be a part of that.” And any
man’s son who becomes a part of Pitt spends his
collegiate years with a part of Dr. Bowman who lives
quietly among rolling hills, trout streams, his pottery,
and his books, who lives now with the satisfaction of a
dream fulﬁlled.

OU WHO ARE GRADUATING will join more
than 40,000 other alumni who are just as
much a part of this University as students
and faculty. You will be the University
then as really as you have been while you
were students. You will use what you have learned
here to be doctors, engineers, lawyers, teachers,
homemakers, and many other kinds of citizens.

Your work, whatever it may be, will be deter-
mined in large measure by what you are. Into the
“what you are” goes something of all your University
experience: an inspiring teacher, a cup of coffee in the
Tuck Shop, a crackling ﬁre in the Commons Room,
classrooms that teach, enduring friendships, beauty
in Gothic arches, cherry blossoms on the lawn, a
University prom, a Stephen Foster melody, a char-
acter which you have lived in a play, an anthem you
sang in the Choir, Christmas carols with the scent of
pine trees. Throughout your life these memories will
always be a part of you, shaping your character, and
getting somehow into the lives of your children and of
all those with whom you associate.

VVe want you to take from all of your experiences
as students to your work as alumni the ability to
think, values by which you will live, and courage to
act. Above all, we hope that you in the great adventure
of life will have the satisfaction of being your best self.

THE SECRETARY

Dr. John Webster

ITH TWENTY-FIVE THOUSAND STU-

DENTS attending University of

Pittsburgh courses during the 1947-

48 school year, I. G. Quick faced

some of the hardest problems in
his 32 years as Registrar. And in the minds of the
thousands of students who ﬁled through Syria Mosque
registration in as little as thirty minutes, there was
little doubt that the efﬁcient Dr. Quick had gone far
toward solving the problems of registration. Dr. Quick
modestly credits much of the achievements to the
new IBM machines that eliminate thousands of hours
of hand recording on grade sheets and course cards.
But it was largely the new pre—registration system,
devised by Dr. Quick and put into effect in December,
that so sharplyreduced the time required for registra-
tion. Under the new system eleven thousand students
received class schedule booklets and several registra-
tion forms early in December. Class cards for students
enrolled in year-long courses were distributed by their
instructors prior to Christmas vacation. Thus the
need for advisory service and extensive writing at
Syria Mosque was eliminated for most students.
Despite the complex problems involved in registering
the largest number of students ever to attend Pitt,
Dr. Quick still ﬁnds time to make personal visits to
high schools and maintain cordial relations between
the schools and the University. Aiding Dr. Quick this
yearwas assistant registrar, Endicott Batchelder, whose
help has been invaluable in administering Pitt’s new
streamlined pre—registration system.

ITT SECRETARY, DR. JOHN WEBER, is a man

who has played a signiﬁcant role in the

growth of the University. After his gradua-

tion in 1910 Dr. Weber became an instructor

in Mechanical Engineering and following his
service as a captain in World War 1, Dr. Weber
became head of the Mechanical Engineering Depart-
ment. In 1926 Dr. Weber became business manager of
the University. A member of the Board of Trustees, he
has been Secretary of the University since 1936. As
supervising engineer Dr. Weber played an important
role in the construction of the Cathedral and the
Heinz Chapel. One of Dr. Weber's greatest accomplish-
ments was his selection of the famous stained glass
windows in the Chapel. To prepare himself for the
task, he traveled in the United States and in Europe
studying and examining this type of window. But Dr.
Weber's interests are not conﬁned to University
affairs. He has been a member of the City Planning
Committee and of the Board of Managers of the
Juvenile Court. For the future Dr. Weber sees more
adequate sports facilities, student dormitories, and a
new science building.

DEAN OF WOMEN

 

Miss Barbara Shirk; Miss Ruth Becker; Miss Betty Jane Wood; Mrs. Harriet Kohberger; Miss Helen Poole Rush; Miss Jean Robinson;
Miss Helen Van Dyke; Mrs. Melrose Weitzel.

HE VVELFARE of the woman student as a
person is the primary responsibility of the
Dean of Women, Miss Helen Pool Rush.
Aiding Miss Rush is an able staff of
assistants and secretaries. Mrs. Harriet
Koh erger aids Pitt women in extra-curricular activ-
ities and offers aid to the various women's organiza-
tions. Student housing and vocational guidance are in
the care of Miss Jean Robinson. The Dean of Women's
office aids in administration of the Commons and
Nationality Rooms through Miss Betty Woods. Miss

Helen Van Dyke cooperates with Mr. Daufenbaugh
and the University marshalls in the operation of the
Information Room. The management of Heinz Chapel
is the special Charge of Mrs. Melrose Weitzel. The
Chancellorls Reception, Spring Coronation, the VVom-
en's floor, the mentor program for freshman women,
and the VADE MECUM are projects of the Dean of
VVomen's ofﬁce. Miss Rush and her staff help plan and
carry out Dear1’s Conference, a program to acquaint
freshmen women with Pitt life.

DEAN OF MEN

HE YEAR 1948 brought another increase in
registration at Pitt and every increase in
enrollment adds to the task of Pitt's Dean
of Men, Theodore W. Biddle. Every man
applying for admission to the University
is in erviewed by Dean Biddle or one of his assistants.
The new freshman is then given orientation in Pitt
history and traditions. Assisting the Dean in the
supervision of extra—curricular activities is Edwin J.
Mclntosh, whose special responsibilities include frater-

nities and Men’s Council. William F. Saalbach advises
Cap and Gown and Student Congress Activities.
William E. McElwain supervises the student publica-
tions. The Pitt band is under the supervision of
Robert R. Arthur. J. Edward Ricart helps iron out
veterans’ problems. Charles H. Ebert assists prospec-
tive graduates in obtaining employment through the
Placement Bureau. Dean Biddle, his assistants, and
efficient secretarial staff spare no efforts to assist Pitt
men in attaining a fully rounded college life.

FACULTY HALL OF FAME

This year we are introducing a new feature in an representation. We believe, however, that those
effort to recall to the minds of graduates and alums mentioned here have consistently displayed qualities
some of the outstanding faculty personalities here at which will assure them a place in the memories and
Pitt. Limited space and the staff’s limited knowledge hearts of their students.

of faculty members have made impossible a complete

AKE A CAPTIVATING APTNESS OF EXPRESSION, a gesture to match the

phrase, a love of the beautiful and best in life, a tall, spare man and

blend them into your memory of Dr. Percival Hunt. Professor at Large

of English, Dr. Hunt has for many years been the spirit of English

scholarship and appreciation at Pitt. Into his classes he weaves his
philosophy of simplicity and integrity. For in literature that has charmed hu-
manity since Chaucer and in sketches of student experience Dr. Hunt ﬁnds in the
word and phrase the communication of feeling. To ﬁnd this feeling in poetry,
drama, and prose, students enter Dr. Hunt’s classes from every school in the
University and from many of Pittsburgh’s varied ways of life. Life is what he
teaches and the joy in the living. To have known this modest, contemplative pro-
fessor is to have learned of the pleasure in expression; in enjoying the experience
of another through reading and reliving a personal experience through writing.
Twenty-ﬁve years of inspiration Dr. Hunt has given Pitt. After several years as
head of ‘the Department of English at the University of Iowa, he became the head
of Pitt’s Department of English in 1922. Under his direction the department grew
in stature until Pitt English students were recognized for their appreciative liter-
ary backgrounds and for their ability to write both factually and creatively. Be-
sides writing several English texts Dr. Hunt has for many years contributed to
writing magazines. A Phi Beta Kappa, he is also a member of the Modern Lan-
guage Association, and the English Speaking Union. Dr. Hunt is a teacher, pa-
tient, helpful, and kind; there can be nothing more ﬁne.

Dr. Hunt

HE FIRST WEEK OF SCHOOL Is USUALLY THE WORST for ‘Bill’ Daufen-

baugh, senior member of the Dean of Men’s staff. His headquarters

on the ﬁrst ﬂoor takes on the look of a bargain counter on the day

after Christmas. “There are too many people in my ﬁfth hour class”~

“There's no one in 132 C1 and I have a class there”.-“Everybody
except me is in the wrong room"——and “My class has disappeared.” are some of
the comments heard as hundreds of stray freshmen, stray upperclassmen, and
even an occasional stray professor, pour into the Information room for aid. Even
the ‘dull’ middle part of the term holds problems aplenty for Mr. D. Local public
school juveniles racing through the Commons room; complaints from innocent and
irate citizens left in the wake of a Pitt victory march; and stench bombs from
Carnegie Tech well-wishers are a few of the headaches that plague the Information
ofﬁce. Perhaps the most painful, but necessary, duty that falls upon Mr. Daufen-
baugh is to locate and notify students and faculty members when death or
emergency strikes their families or homes. -In addition to these services to the
students, Mr. Daufenbaugh directs the staff of University marshals. Under
‘Bill’s' supervision, the boys with badges roam the halls, enforce the no-smoking
regulations, remove unauthorized posters, break up card games and otherwise
help maintain the order and dignity of the cathedral.

Dr. Jones

UST CALL HIM “POP.” To everyone at Pitt that name denotes just one personﬁ
Theodore W. Finney, head of the music appreciation department. Being a
department head is no sinecure. In Music apprec. it means teaching several
sections each day in addition to administrative chores. Even with that double
burden, Pop Finney ﬁnds time for extra-curricular activities. Since his arrival

E wAs HERE AFTER the ﬁrst world war, and he’s still here; in fact,

Professor Montfort Jones has been teaching money and banking at

Pitt for the past 33 years. Early this term, he almost disrupted his

long term by sustaining an elongated dose of pneumonia. Students can

still enjoy his classes though. The professor couldn’t stay ill in the face
of that myriad of invitations to get well. Montfort Jones isn’t too fond of ﬁckle
young women, it is rumored—probably because he’s on the inside of the money
game and knows what trouble the “young things” can cause in the ﬁnancial
world. There is one other personality trait which must have grown out of the
professors knowledge of money: he loves farm life. With food prices streaking up-
ward, Professor Jones has changed the old slogan to “How can you keep ‘em
AWAY from the farm.”

here in 1936, he has handled, at one time or another, the band, orchestra, glee
club, and the chapel choir, which he still directs. Sandwiched in among all this, he
has composed ﬁve anthems based on the chapel windows. Spare time? Oh, yes, as
a hobby, Pop writes books about music. Members of the choir can tell you that
he’s one of those rarities, a real artist with deep sensitivity and an even temper.

 

The richness of their singing is a tribute to his skill as a conductor. Dr. Finney

 

HEN A MAN WHO HAS FOUGHT in both World Wars, engaged in
successful business ventures in a dozen states, and is currently
the owner of a large wholesale concern, declares that he
teaches because he likes to teach, it really sounds convincing.
Such is the case with Dr. Theodore Parker, popular history
professor who is best remembered for his virile philosophy of “Life is to live, kids,
so let’s make the most of it.” A veteran of the Canadian and American expedi~
tionary forces in 1917-18, Dr. Parker attended Pitt in 1920 and became a professor
in 1934. Having served 34 months overseas as an executive ofﬁcer and deputy
historian of the Eighth air force in World War II, Dr. Parker returned in 1945
to his favorite job—teaching. Despite the swollen enrollment, accentuated by the
popularity of this wide awake prof, Dr. and Mrs. Parker hold their traditional

Dr. Parker open house for students every semester at their Iowa street home.

HE FRESHMAN WHO FIRST ENTERS Dr. Isaacs’ Economics 3 class may
be over-awed at the size of the room, the weight of the textbook, and
the number of students, but any fears he may have for a boring three
hours a week are usually wiped out the ﬁrst day. For in addition to
being an authority on economic matters, author of a new advanced
text, International Trade, and secretary of the department of Economics, Dr.
Isaacs is endowed with a Versatile sense of humor. His “lectures" delivered in
mock seriousness, on subjects such as “the proper method of ﬁnagling a higher
grade from an experienced professor” or “how to subtly insult the Registrar’s
Office” send students into spasms of laughter. Capable of brightening the most
academic topic with humorous anecdotes Without losing the signiﬁcance of the
material covered, Dr. Isaacs makes his classes enjoyable as well as instructive.

22

 

Dr. Isaacs

HIS FISHIN’ AND wR1T1N’ associate professor of English hides out in his
quarters in the Early American room when he isn’t teaching, advis-
ing, or telling about the “big one that got away.” Mr. Peterson is a
real Pitt citizen this year for he has just completed 21 years as a
member of the faculty. Students appreciate “Pete s pleasant sense
of humor and his non—indulgence in sarcasm. To this professor students are real
people-—not just people. The creative writing department is Mr. Peterson’s
greatest contribution to the University. To aid in the development of this pro-
gram, “Pete” gathers the best student writings and publishes them in STUDENT
WRITING—another of his inovations. Mr. Peterson practices the same writing
principles that he teaches to his students. His full length, idyllic, NO LIFE SO

77!

 

HAPPY, vividly portrays the delights of ﬁshing. Dr. Peterson

 

Capt. Hunter

ORE THAN Two DECADES of Pitt students have studied philo-
sophy under tall red-haired Dr. Mont R. Gabbert. Dr. Gabbert
landed on the University faculty in 1921 fresh from Graduate
School of Chicago University. Since that time the big man with
the quiet voice has spent his days calmly explaining philosophy
and gently dispelling popular misconceptions and prejudices concerning his
ﬁeld. Philosophy, he will tell you, is the business of every thinking person. As
head of the philosophy department, Dr. Gabbert is burdened with many ad-
ministrative duties, but he can always ﬁnd time to give individual help to his
students. He also makes it his duty to help the new professor in his depart-
ment become a part of Pitt. Outside school Dr. Gabbert devotes his leisure
moments to music, the movies, and a family that furnishes many of his classroom

illustrations.

 

Dr. Ferguson

HE AIR FORCE AND THE PITT BAND have shared most of Captain

James D. Hunter’s time since he ﬁrst came to Pitt as a freshman in

1938. Drum major and student director of the band, Jim Hunter still

found time to complete four years of ROTC and accept a commission

when he graduated in 1942. After service overseas with the Twelfth
Air Force, Jim returned to Pitt in 1945 a ﬁrst lieutenant and became an instructor
in the military department. Now a captain, Jim Hunter is a familiar ﬁgure as the
friendly adjutant of the military department and instructor in air ROTC and also
as the joke-cracking drill master of the high stepping 150 piece Pitt band. When
June comes bringing recess for some students and summer school for others,
Jim Hunter leaves to help train the Pitt air ROTC cadets for the day when
they don the shiny new gold bars.

 

Dr. Gabbert

OME STUDENTS MAY SPEND four years at College and meet very few people,

but if there is any student at Pitt who doesn't know Dr. Ferguson, we'd

like to meet him or her. “John Maxwell Ferguson PhD, Jur. D., professor

of economics” is the way the faculty directory lists him, but to the entire

student body this colorful and beloved prof is just plain “Fergie.” Cig-
arette holder in hand, Fergie rarely misses a school event despite a heavy schedule
of classes and research work for a new economics text. Fraternity and sorority
houses are always open to him, and ancient is the piano that Fergie can't coax a
tune out of at the Greek affairs. Taplday, Scholars day, Spring Festival,—all
ﬁnd the good doctor doing his bit to help students get the most of college life. A
professor in learning but a student at heart is Pitt’s Doc Ferguson.

THE COLLEGE

HROUGH THE COLLEGE CURRICULUM, and
guided by Dean Stanton C. Crawford, the
student is given an opportunity to study
and thus achieve the highest level of learn-
ing, judgment and creative skill. As early
as t e time of the Pittsburgh Academy, the school has
lead students in their study of liberal arts and sciences.
Later the school took over the pre-professional stu-
dents, allowing them to gain groundwork for their
graduate work by a year’s study in the college.

Campus activities, fraternities, and faculty con-
ferences are all ﬁtted into the College program with
the assistance of Dean Crawford and his staff.

The College is the largest of the undergraduate
schools and for over a century and a half has directed
University students in their study of the liberal arts
and sciences.

THE SCHOOL OF
BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION

NDER THE GUIDANCE of Dean Vincent

Lanfear, the School of Business Adminis—

tration kept its reputation of being one of

the highest rated schools of Business

Administration in the country. The
school uses the Pittsburgh district as a great laboratory
in which the students can obtain a wealth of valuable
practical knowledge. Also emphasized is the policy of
close association between the University and business
in the community. The Business Administration stu-
dent is not only taught the basic curriculum, but also
the problems which business faces and the changes
which it undergoes. With other University schools, the
School of Business Administration is expanding in
order to offer the broad opportunities which the ﬁeld
holds, and it is the belief of the faculty that the school
will train young men and women to understand the
business world and so lead them to a successful career.

SSISTING AND DIRECTING the potential

teachers of the nation is Dean Samuel P.

Franklin, member of the University

administration since December of 1943.

Along with his work as head of the School

of Education, Dean Franklin represents the University

as a member of the National Education Conference.

E Recognizing the importance of sincere and earnest

workers in the development of the character and educa-

tion of youth, the School of Education stresses scholar-

ship, capability, and personality as admittance to the

school. Included in their course of study, students take

various teaching technique courses which aid in train-
ing the student in teaching method.

The University's School of Education is one of the
most extensive in the country because of its wide
variety of teacher training, ranging from elementary
and kindergarten to vocational and nurses training.

THE SCHOOL OF
ENGINEERING AND MINES

ACING DEAN E. A. HOLBROOK this year was the

stupendous problem of how to adequately

accommodate an oversized class of engineering

students. It was not an easy job to see that

each student was properly placed and instructed,
but Dean Holbrook, with many years of such ex-
perience behind him, was successful in doing just this.
With the aid of a highly competent staff of instructors,
the Dean was able to guide those University students
under his supervision. The School of Engineering and
Mines is not conﬁned to any one type of engineering.
Included in the School are the divisions of chemical,
electrical, and mechanical engineering, all of which
were ﬁlled to a capacity this year. With an ever-
growing staff of new teachers and with many new
additions and improvements of buildings and equip-
ment, the School of Engineering and Mines looks for-
ward to even greater days.

SCHOOL OF NURSING

EAN RUTH PERKINS KUEHN leads the

women in white of the School of Nursing.

Having served the University for years,

Dean Kuehn's present desire is to see

the long dreamed of nursing homes
become a reality. Grants and beneﬁts are constantly
being given to expand and hasten the construction of
the building.

Women in the Nursing School gain actual ex-
perience with patients in hospitals as a part of their
daily study. This work, combined with a certain
number of hours of study, completes their nursing
education. Practical education in nursing science and
nursing education is open to the student. Following
this training nursing students may go on for degrees in
specialized ﬁelds of nursing such as pediatrics, obstet-
rics, and operating room technique.

Now after only ten years of existence the Nursing
School is one of the best in the country.

SCHOOL OF PHARMACY

ED BY DEAN EDWARD C. REIF, the Pharmacy

School has completed one of its most success-

ful years. In their “off campus college” the

students work, experiment, and perfect their

knowledge of remedial solvents. They are
people eing equipped with the proper background for
successful careers in the profession of pharmacy. In
this building, there are laboratories for practical train-
ing and ﬁrst—hand research and a library of about
3,875 volumes which contain instructional material of
special interest to pharmacists. Here too, the students
have an association that brings them in contact with
the problems of the pharmacist in the outside world.
The American Pharmaceutical Association has a local
student branch, directed entirely by students, which
sponsors social affairs which relieve the burden of long
hours of intensive study and laboratory work.

MORTAR BOARD RECOGNIZES SENIOR WOMEN FOR LEADERSHIP AND SERVICE

ORTAR BOARD, national senior honorary

for women, searches out its members

from under class honorary and scho-

lastic fraternities and from each Pitt

activity. The 1948 chapter members of

Mortar Board were active in the senior mentor pro-
gram, served as aids at graduation in January, and
hostesses for Chancellor's Reception, the Commons
Room Teas, and as hostesses in the Nationality Rooms.
Each member served individually in various Pitt
activities4the Women’s Self-Government Associa-
tion, on Senior Court, in the YWCA, in the Women's
Speech Association, and on University publications.
Mortar Board, recognizing scholarship, honored
those freshmen women having high scholastic attain-
ments for their ﬁrst semester with scrolls on Scholar’s
Day. The freshmen woman having the highest quality
point was awarded a key. In an effort to serve all Pitt
women, Mortar Board members carried out plans for the
improvement of the Twelfth Floor in the University.
February 28, members of Mortar Boards from

109

1909 to 1948 met in a grand reunion planned by the
active chapter. A Leap Year theme was followed
throughout the social program and the speeches at the
reunion luncheon held in the Faculty Club. Plans
were made at this active-alumnae meeting for a Pitt
Mortar Board Alumnae group. To promote friend-
liness in a few hours of fun, Mortar Board members of
Pitt and Tech held a joint social meeting at the
Carnegie Union. Other events on the social calendar
were holiday parties, guest speakers, and get-together
breakfasts and luncheons. In all its activities, Mortar
Board attempted to meet its high standards of belief
in campus leadership, scholarship, and service. The
faculty advisors chosen for the year were Miss Rush,
Mrs. Batz, and Miss Irvine, who counseled the girls
in all their activities.

The officers for the year were
as follows: President, Betty Shore;
Vice-President, Sally Joy Oleon; t
Secretary, Pat Heneghan; Treas-
urer, Nancy Brumbaugh.

O D K HONORS UNIVERSITY MEN WI-IO LEAD IN ACTIVITIES AND SERVICE

MICRON DELTA KAPPA, national leader-

ship society for men, recognizes outstand-

ing leadership on college campuses. Mem-

bers are tapped for their outstanding

leadership as evidenced by their participa-

tion in student activities. These student activities are
grouped into ﬁve major phases of college life: scholar-
ship, athletics, social and religious activities, publica-
tions, and arts. Omicron Delta Kappa believes that
participation in worthwhile campus activities outside
the classroom aids in the development of social in-
terests and a sense of responsibility. These, therefore,
as well as intellectual development, are important
goals in education. Membership is awarded twice each
year, in December and May, to junior and senior men
and to faculty and alumni on the basis of character,
scholarship, distinguished attainments in college and
community life, and consecration to a great purpose.
Gamma chapter of Omicron Delta Kappa, third

oldest chapter in the country, was founded at the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh in 1914. Omicron Delta Kappa
was founded originally at Washington and Lee Univer-
sity. Gamma chapter has originated Omicron Delta
Kappa walk to perpetuate the names of the senior
awardees. The senior awardee is selected through pref-
erential balloting by male members of the senior
class. In this manner the man is selected for the
highest non-academic honor the University can bestow.
Each year the name of the senior awardee is cut into
the stones of ODK walk where it will be a permanent
testimony to his selection. The organization is looking
forward to a continuation of its ideals.

The officers for the year were as
follows: President, VVilliam Veenis;
Vice-President, John McKinley;
Secretary-treasurer, Reid Hastie;
Faculty advisor, E. A. Batchelder.

ALPHA BETA GAMMA PROJECTS CREATE INTEREST IN ELEMENTARY TEACHING

LPHA BETA GAMMA, the professional

elementary education fraternity. was

founded by a few girls in 1940 as a means

of communication of ideas between

students and faculty in the teaching
ﬁeld. From this small beginning Alpha Beta Gamma
has grown to an organization which now has well over
ﬁfty members. During its life at Pitt, Alpha Beta
Gamma has endeavored to create interest in the ﬁeld
of elementary education. The purposes of the organ-
ization are not wholly professional, however, for the
girls believe that Alpha Beta Gamma offers them a
chance for social life and activity as well. Throughout
the year Alpha Beta Gamma held get-together teas.
Various speakers from the teaching profession came
to guide the girls in the discussions. At these teas
those problems which concern the ﬁeld of education
were discussed and the girls carried away many sug-
gestions which will prove of much help to the girls
when they in turn take an active part in this profession.

111

To spread cheer at Christmas time the girls
packed boxes for the children in the Ward Home. This
project which was started last year is the social service
project for Alpha Beta Gamma. To further spread the
Christmas spirit the girls served as aides at the popular
Christmas party in the Commons Room for the children
of the Pitt faculty members. Then in a more solemn
vein the fraternity held their initiation for those mem-
bers who had entered in the fall. A party was held
immediately after this at which the new members
became better acquainted with one another and with
those members from the preceeding year. Then as an
appropriate ending for the year the annual banquet
was held in May. At this time the girls became
acquainted with the alums with whom they will work
in the years to come.

The ofﬁcers for the year were as follows: President,
Bette Frost; Vice-President, Marjorie Heinlein;
Secretary, Joan James; Treasurer, Sherma Feldman.

ALPHA EPSILON DELTA ENCOURAGES HIGH SCHOLARSHIP AMONG PRE-MEDS

LPHA EPSILON DELTA, incorporating in

its name the motto “Truth I Pursue," is

the national honorary fraternity for pre-

medical students. The object of the fra-

ternity is to encourage excellence in pre-
medical scholarship, to promote the general welfare of
the members by advocating the following of the
highest ideals in obtaining their goal and to bind to-
gether similarly interested students.

The University of Pittsburgh branch of Alpha
Epsilon Delta is known as the Pennsylvania Gamma
Chapter. It had its origin in 1922 as the Chiron Club,
men’s honorary pre—medical fraternity. In January
1930, the name of the organization was changed to
Chi Rho Nu. Being inactive during the war, Chi Rho
Nu was reorganized in March 1947 and was opened to
all pre-medical students who have attained at least a
2.0 average in their combined courses, and a 2.0 aver-
age in the sciences. In January 1948 Chi Rho Nu was
granted a charter by Alpha Epsilon Delta, the national

honorary pre-medical fraternity, and became the
organization’s Pennsylvania Gamma chapter. This
chapter, numbering some one hundred students, is one
of the strongest groups of the organizations.

Membership in Alpha Epsilon Delta is a recog-
nition of superior scholastic achievement of a pre-
medical student and it affords him an opportunity to
develop a well-rounded personality and qualities of
initiative, leadership, and self-education by participat-
ing in the activities of his chapter and the fraternity.
To provide this opportunity, the Pennsylvania
Gamma Chapter holds two meetings a month. Chapter
activities in the past have included meetings where
subjects of interest to pre-medical students were
discussed by faculty members and physicians from the
neighboring hospitals.

The ofﬁcers for the year were as follows: Presi-
dent, A. Rovnanck; Vice-President, Rawden Rambo;
Secretary, Ruth Ra(uP13§ Corresponding Secretary,
Don Gobel; Treasurer, Robert Hepner.

ALPHA KAPPA PSI LEADS SCIENTIFIC STUDY IN COMMERCE AND FINANCE

LPHA KAPPA P51, the ﬁrst commerce fra-

ternity, was founded at Pitt in 1910 by

James L. Cox, Charles C. Sheppard,

Arthur L. Brockway, Henry H. Martin-

ale, Frank H. Eckles, and Charles D.

Wettach. The aims of Alpha Kappa Psi are “to further

the individual welfare of its members; to foster scien-

tiﬁc research in the ﬁelds of commerce, accounts, and

ﬁnance; to educate the public to appreciate and

demand higher ideals therein; and to promote and

advance in institutions of college rank, courses leading
to degrees in business administration.”

Each chapter of Alpha Kappa Psi is required to
conduct a deﬁnite program of professional activity
each year. Such activity includes prominent speakers
on economic, business, and educational subjects, tours
of the important industrial plants in Pittsburgh,
promotion of special commerce school events, forums
on career planning and job ﬁnding techniques, occupa-
tional conferences, research projects, service to the

112

school, and discussions and debates on political and
business subjects of current interest to the members of
Alpha Kappa Psi. In addition to these activities, the
conduct of a reasonable number of social and fraternal
activities is encouraged. Dances, picnics, smokers,
dinners, and joint meetings with alumni members are
among those featured by the Delta Chapter of Alpha
Kappa Psi.

Through the medium of its various alumni groups
and members located throughout the country, Alpha
Kappa Psi offers a permanent professional association
with a selected group of college trained men, many of
whom have attained unusual business success. Such
associations in Alpha Kappa Psi are of real value in a
professional, as well as social, sense.

ALPHA OMEGA ALPHA ENCOURAGES THE SPIRIT OF MEDICAL RESEARCH

OLLOWING THE TEACHINGS OF Hippocrates,

Percival, and others, the medical profession has

always encouraged high standards among its

members. In order to promote similar high

ideals of thought and action in students of
Medicine, Alpha Omega Alpha was founded in 1902
at the University of Illinois, College of Medicine, by
VVilliam W. Root. Alpha Omega Alpha is a non-secret
Medical College Honor Society, membership to which
is based entirely upon scholarship, moral qualiﬁcation
being satisfactory. Election to this Society is not only
a recognition of accomplishment as a student, but also
an insignia of both promise and expectancy of leader-
ship in some phase of medicine after graduation. Alpha
Omega Alpha is the only order of its kind in medical
schools on this continent. It is not a social organiza-
tion. Its deﬁnite mission is to encourage personal
honesty and the spirit of medical research.

114

At the present time, Alpha Omega Alpha has
active chapters in all of the leading medical schools of
this nation. The chapter at the University of Pitts-
burgh School of Medicine, Gamma of Pennsylvania,
was chartered by invitation in 1916. The activity of
the Gamma chapter is primarily centered about semi-
annual dinner meetings at which the newly elected
members are honored by the active members, the
alumni members, and also the faculty members.

The purposes of the fraternity, in keeping with
its ideals, are the promotion of high educational stand-
ards and research in medical schools, the encourage-
ment of a ﬁne standard of character, and the recogni-
tion of outstanding scholastic achievement.

The officers for the year were as follows: Pres-
ident, Robert Challinor; Vice-President, Carl Lewin;
Secretary, Dave Huber; Treasurer, John Cochran.

CWENS TAPS PROMISING LEADERS FROM AMONG ACTIVE FRESHMAN WOMEN

O CWENS, TAP DAY symbolizes the begin-
ning of many happy experiences. On this
day the freshmen women who showed
friendly cooperation in their customs,
mentor, and guild programs; participated
actively in other freshmen activities; and attained at
least a 2.0 average, are tapped to Cwens. As members
of this group they strive for leadership, scholarship,
and fellowship among the sophomore women. This
year the Cwens’ main project was to serve as aides to
the guild advisors of the Freshmen Guild Program.
This was in keeping with the Cwens’ desire to make
friends with the freshmen women, to orient them in
the ideals and customs of Pitt women, and to encour-
age their participation in activities. Cwens also put
out the Cwen Directory containing the names, addresses,

115

and telephone numbers of the women students. Serv-
ing as ushers at Heinz Chapel and as student hostesses
for university functions were other duties of Cwens.
However, the Cwens also mixed many good social
events in with their work. Their social calendar got
off to a successful start with a summer picnic in
Schenley Park. Other events on the lighter side in-
cluded a bowling party, a Rustic Rumpus party, a
Christmas party, a Mother—Daughter Luncheon, and
a Farewell party. The frequent meetings on the twelfth
ﬂoor afforded the Cwens another opportunity to get
better acquainted with one another. Thus each Cwen
experienced a year of service to others and herself.

The ofﬁcers for the year were as follows: Presi-
dent, Flora Diemert; Vice-President, Ruth Tindell;
Secretary, Shirley Anstandig ;Treasurer, Martha Duffy.

DELTA DELTA LAMBDA AFFAIRS WERE SOCIAL, CULTURAL, EDUCATIONAL

ELTA DELTA LAMBDA, honorary com-

mercial education fraternity, named for

Dr. Daniel D. Lessenberry, had as its

aim this year the honoring and encourag-

ing of active scholarship in the ﬁeld of
commercial education. This aim, therefore, guided
Delta Delta Lambda during this year both socially
and culturally.

Delta Delta Lambda had its beginning as an
honorary commercial education fraternity in Novem-
ber of 1934. The junior and senior students in the
department of commercial education recognized the
need, because of the increased growth of the com-
mercial education department at the University of
Pittsburgh, for an organization which would bring
them closer together and further the principles for
which they stood. Delta Delta Lambda fraternity
carried out this purpose during the year by serving all
the commercial students, but especially those on the
campus of the University of Pittsburgh, by providing
a medium through which the social-business problems
could be discussed. This was accomplished by introduc-

ing outstanding leaders in the ﬁeld of commercial
education and by fostering a social spirit among the
members of Delta Delta Lambda. By meeting and
talking to the leaders of each ﬁeld in commercial
education, students learned what is to be gained from
University courses and activities corresponding with
these ﬁelds.

During the ﬁrst semester Delta Delta Lambda
held a “Get Acquainted” party to give pre-commercial
and commercial students the opportunity to meet the
members of the University of Pittsburgh’s commercial
Education faculty. These informal meetings between
faculty and student members create a friendly atmos-
phere between the two groups and help all concerned
to better understand each other and their mutual in-
terests and problems. Another event of interest was
the annual rushing tea held in December. Later in the
spring the members got together at the initiation
banquet.

The ofﬁcers for the year were as follows: Presi-
dent, Paul R. Leary; Vice-President, Dorothy Perlis;
Secretary, Lila Terry; Treasurer, Phyllis Fields.

First Row: P. Rose; Dr. Lessenberry; P. Leary, Pres.; E. Lataghata; G. Martin. Second Row: R. Boxenbaum; P. Fields; M. J. Johnston;

ETA KAPPA NU, ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING FRATERNITY, IS ACTIVE AGAIN!

ECOGNIZING that the Electrical Engineering
Department of the School of Engineering
was returning to its own with new strength
following the war, the faculty, including
rofessors H. E. Dyche, R. C. Gorham, and
P. E. Rush assisted by instructors G. H. Didinger and
R. L. Lucas, reactivated the honorary electrical engi-
neering fraternity, Eta Kappa Nu. This association
had been quite prominent in campus activities before
the war, but with the wartime reduction in the engi-
neering student body it was felt by the advisor, Pro-
fessor Philip E. Rush, that the organization should be
inactive.

Membership in Eta Kappa Nu is reserved to
those men who have demonstrated that they have
marked ability as evidenced by scholarship and
individual attainments and who possess qualities
which indicate they will be leaders in their chosen
profession. While the qualiﬁcations for members

distinctly stimulate and reward high scholarship, Eta
Kappa Nu has a far broader purpose than merely to
award a badge of distinction. As conceived by founders
and as carried forward by its membership, its aim is to
assist the members throughout their lives in becoming
better men in their chosen profession. There is also
another purpose of the organization, that is, that its
membership be a constructive force helping fellow
members and nonmembers alike in improving the
standards of the profession, the course of instruction,
and the institutions with which the chapteris associated.

The ofﬁcial reactivation came with the election
of officers following the initiation banquet. The
ofﬁcers for the year were as follows: President, Ralph
W. Simmons; Vice—President, John C. Studebaker;
Corresponding secretary, William Korynoski; Publica-
tions secretary, Harold L. Russo; Secretary, John C.
Studebaker; Treasurer, Melvin E. Koglin; Faculty
advisor, Professor Philip E. Rush.

KAPPA PHI KAPPA ENCOURAGES MEN TO ENTER THE FIELD OF EDUCATION

APPA PHI KAPPA is a professional education

fraternity, the purpose of which is to promote

the cause of education by encouraging men of

strong moral character and recognized

ability to engage in the study of its principles
and problems. For the furtherance of the above pur-
pose the fraternity emphasizes among its members
social intercourse, scholarly attainments and pro-
fessional ideals.

The Kappa Phi Kappa fraternity is both a pro-
fessional and an honorary fraternity, professional in
that all of its members are men in the ﬁeld of educa-
tion, honorary because it accepts only those with a
high scholastic standing.

The national fraternity was formed in 1922, and
since that time the organization has attempted to
coordinate the interests and activities of men in
education to beneﬁt both themselves and the Univer-
sity. For its members the goal of Tau chapter has been
to create the desire for social contact, scholastic

118

achievement, professional attainment. For the Univer-
sity, Kappa Phi Kappa has planned and effected
projects to foster and improve educational activities.
The present campus membership of thirty-one, one of
the largest in the history of the local chapter, is work-
ing with Mr. Hoffman of the School of Education on a

J program of orientation for students doing pre-educa-

tional work at the University. This and other projects
are planned and discussed at the regular monthly
meetings of the fraternity. Discussions are also the
key-note of the biannual smoker to which potential
new members are invited for ﬁnal selection by the
fraternity. The Pitt chapter of Kappa Phi Kappa keeps
in personal contact with the national organization by
sendingrepresentativestotheannualGeneralAssembly.

The ofﬁcers for the year were as follows: Presi-
dent, Paul R. Leary; Vice-President, Edward J.
Welsh; Secretary, Edward A. Latagliata; Treasurer,
Robert V. Gabriel.

KAPPA KAPPA PSI BOASTS MEMBERSHIP OF CRACK UNIVERSITY BANDSMEN

LPHA OMEGA CHAPTER of Kappa Kappa
Psi, National Band fraternity, was estab-
lished on campus in January 1948.
Kappa Kappa Psi is a national honorary
band fraternity for college bandsmen and

represents the ﬁnest college bands in the country.
The University of Pittsburgh Band became in-
terested in Kappa Kappa Psi largely through the Ohio
State Band members during the visit of the University
of Pittsburgh Band to Ohio in 1946. Consequently, in
December 1946 the plans were made to petition the
National Headquarters at Stillwater, Oklahoma for
admittance into membership. Twenty-four men from
the Band Association who expressed interest in the
fraternity formed a petitioning group which included
the officers of the Band Association. A petition com-
mittee was appointed in January 1947, the members of
which were VVilliam VV. Focer, Petition Editor; Elmer
M.Trautman,Assistant Petition Editor; and RobertG.

Anderson, the Secretary of the Band Association, who
maintained the correspondence with the National
Headquarters. By the spring of 1947, the ﬁrst draft of
the petition was submitted to the Men’s Fraternity
Council for approval. Their investigation was com-
plete by June and the Petition then went to the printer
for ﬁnal assembly. The activities of the petitioning
group were revived in the fall of 1947 and the ﬁnished
petition was submitted to the National Headquarters.

In January of 1948 the petitioning group was
initiated into membership of Kappa Kappa Psi. Thus,
the youngest honorary fraternity on campus is leaping
ahead to further the interest of Kappa Kappa Psi and
make the University of Pittsburgh Marching Band the
best band the University has ever known.

The officers for the year were as follows: Pres-
ident, Calvin C. Williams; Vice-President. James A.
Scannell; Secretary, Robert G. Anderson; Treasurer,
Norbert Shanblatt.

1947, of opening their meetings to the

general student body and faculty. To
become a member students must have a 2.0 in natural
sciences and a 1.7 average in all ﬁelds. In addition to
this quality point average the student must have an
interest and ability in natural sciences.

Previously the meetings of Nu Sigma Sigma were
closed to the public, but now as their service to the
University these meetings are open to the students
and faculty members. At these meetings once a month
a speaker from different ﬁelds in natural science
speaks on the problems of current interest in the
natural science. The ﬁrst program was held in Octo-
ber with Dr. E. R. Weidlein, director of Mellon In-
stitute, as speaker. Dr. Weidlein, past president of
the American Chemical Society, spoke with authority
on the ﬁeld of research. Robert Levine, a member of
the organic chemistry staff at Pitt, spoke next on a

121

ﬁeld in which he is doing active research—that of
plastics and resins. Psychology was the subject of the
lecture given by Dr. Robert Patton of the psychology
staff here at Pitt. Dr. Kenneth VVertman, well—known
both in civilian and army research, spoke on research
in public health. Mr. M. Graham Netting, a member
of the research staff at Carnegie Museum, spoke later
in the semester on zoology. Anti-malarial drugs were
discussed by Dr. Robert S. Tipson, a senior research
fellow in pure chemistry and a national authority in
the ﬁeld of anti—malarial drugs. At the initiation ban-
quet in the spring Dr. Peter Gray, chairman of the
department of biology at the University, spoke on the
origin of man. There was, therefore, a year of well-
rounded natural science lectures. The purpose of these
programs, to stimulate and widen the interests of
those students interested in the natural sciences, was
accomplished.

The officers for the year were as follows: Presi-
dent, Elizabeth Hall; Vice-President, Louis Baroff;
Secretary, Mary Cavasina ; Treasurer, Eugene Hensler.

PHI CHI THETA PROMOTES HIGHER BUSINESS EDUCATION FOR ALL WOMEN

HI CHI THETA, national professional fra-

ternity for women in business administration,

promotes the cause of higher business educa-

tion and training for all women, fosters high

ideals for women in business careers, and
encourages fraternity and cooperation among women
preparing for such careers.

Scholarship is of primary interest. The Phi Chi
Theta key is awarded annually to the outstanding
woman in business administration on the basis of
scholarship, character, and activities. Two business
scholarships are awarded each year to a day school
and an evening school junior or senior woman who
have attained high scholastic standing and who take
an active interest in campus activities.

Activities are both social and professional, in-
cluding monthly business meetings, ‘forums, parties,
banquets, and teas. The social calendar for this year
included covered dish suppers, a beneﬁt bridge and
dinner, and “Get Acquainted" parties for all women
in business administration. -The fraternity extended

invitations‘ to outstanding speakers who came and
discussed their particular ﬁeld. One of the most prom-
inent was Judge Lois McBride, who spoke at the
initiation banquet in October.

Each year the various chapters of Phi Chi Theta
center their aims and purposes around one theme. This
year, Epsilon chapter centered its activities around
three ﬁelds of endeavor which were represented by the
rivers of Pittsburgh. Epsilon’s Rivers of Knowledge
were Appreciation of Fine Arts represented by the
Allegheny River, Mastery of Social Graces represented
by the Monongahela River, and Opportunities in
Business represented by the Ohio River. Under
these headings were subdivisions of personality,
etiquette for campus and business, and color in
fashions and in the home. In this way, Epsilon pro-
moted its aims and interests.

Officers for the year were as follows: President,
Lois Dolhopf; Vice-President, Angeline Wasel; Secre-
tary, Alma Lechner; Treasurer, Mary Margaret Gailis.

PHI CHI THETA

THE “MISSIONARIES OF SCHOLARSHIP” TUTOR AND INSPIRE FRESHM ' N

HI ETA SIGMA has national recognition as one

of a very limited number of purely scholastic

honor societies, as distinct from a number of

honoraries and recognition societies of Ameri-

can College Fraternities. There are now
ﬁfty-seven chapters representing the leading univer-
sities in the country. Though organized nationally in
1923, Phi Eta Sigma was not brought to our campus
until 1937 when Dr. Vincent Lanfear, then Dean of
Men, seeing the need of fostering a high degree of
scholarship among freshmen, organized the University
of Pittsburgh chapter. In spite of the rigid standard of
scholarship required of pledges, the chapter has grown
to nearly two hundred active members with the sup-
port of Dean of Men Theodore W. Biddle.

Phi Eta Sigma are “missionaries of scholarship,”
aiding and inspiring others, but seeking no selﬁsh ends.
Their activities, therefore, are designed with those
purposes in view. A small manual, “How to Study”,is
distributed free to freshmen, and in many instances it

can be found still being used to advantage by seniors.
During the 1947 spring semester seventy-ﬁve freshmen
who were in imminent danger of failing the June ﬁnals
were given free coaching by Phi Eta Sigma members
with the result that only two of the seventy-ﬁve
failed. The fall and winter semester found forty-seven
Phi Eta Sigma members giving free tutoring to nearly
two hundred freshmen. Phi Eta Sigma will also co-
sponsor studies by the department of psychology on
Best Methods of Study. Finally, the fraternity sup-
ports the memorial fund established in honor of its
founder, Thomas Arkle Clark, the income from which
is used to grant one or more scholarships of three
hundred dollars annually for graduate work.

The officers for the year were as follows: Presi-
dent, Winston R, Ames; Vice-President, Edward
Blanchard; Co-secretary-treasurer, Stanley Ratner;
Co-secretary-treasurer, Edward Thorne; Senior ad-
visor, Gerard Obert; Faculty advisor, E. J. Mclntosh.

PI TAU PHI HONORS COLLEGE JUNIORS WITH HIGH SCHOLASTIC STANDING

OCAL HONORARY SCHOLASTIC FRATERNITY, Pi
Tau Phi, honors students in the College who
have reached the junior year or its equivalent
with outstanding records. The organization
invites to membership second semester juniors
who ha e attained a quality point average of 2.5 or
better. The fraternity has a long history at the Univer-
sity. Founded on campus in 1925 it was, from the
beginning, designed to honor only those students
whose intellectual achievements had placed them
first in their class. For some years those from all the
schools of the University were tapped to membership,
but since 1932 only students in the College have been
accepted. This makes it possible to form a more homo-
geneous group and one where there is a chance for real
fellowship among the members. Pi Tau Phi owes much
to the late Dr. James Stinchcomb for his unselﬁsh aid
and guidance in the early years of the fraternity's
existence.
Like many organizations, Pi Tau-Phi was inactive
during the war, but returned to the campus last year.
The program for this year included speakers as well

124

as frequent social gatherings. Through its regular
monthly meetings, the organization provides a means
of social fellowship and opportunity for exchange of
ideas. Pi Tau Phi tries to spread the aims of scholar-
ship, culture, and idealism, to stimulate serious
thought, and to establish high intellectual standards.
The ultimate purpose of Pi Tau Phi can perhaps best
be explained by the following excerpt from the pre-
amble to its constitution: “Believing that scholarship,
culture, and idealism are the chief aim of university
life, we the members of Pi Tau Phi fraternity do here-
by band together to conserve and spread those aims; to
provide a means of social fellowship and interchange
of ideas among the students, the honor graduates, and
interested faculty members of the College of the
University of Pittsburgh; always avoiding snobbish-
ness or pedantry, but always striving by all sound
methods to stimulate serious thought and true in-
tellectual standards”.

The officers for the year were as follows: Presi-
dent, Lucy Braider; Vice-President, Leroy Sachs;
Secretary, Marilyn Lipp; Treasurer, James Winn.

PI TAU SIGMA IS WELL ON THE ROAD TO SUCCESSFUL REORGANIZATION

I TAU SIGMA, honorary Mechanical Engi-

neering fraternity, was organized in 1915 by

a group of upperclassmen in the Mechanical

Engineering School at the University of

Illinois. The aims of this honorary fraternity

for mechanical engineers are to stimulate interest in

departmental activities, and to promote the mutual

professional welfare of its members. Members are

selected on the basis of their scholastic standing,

faculty rating, and the opinions of the active members.

The Tau chapter at the University of Pittsburgh

was formally installed on April 22, 1940 through the

efforts of Professor J. A. Dent and a group of active

juniors and seniors. Professor F. H. Stiening was

initiated as an honorary member along with twenty-

four active members. During the war, Pi Tau Sigma

was inactive, but in the fall of 1946 the honorary

group was reactivated with the installation of thirteen

new members. At the present time there are twenty-
one active members.

The fraternity requires a scholastic standard of a

2.0 average to become eligible for membership in the

125

organization. Previously a quality point average of 1.8
was needed to be eligible for membership. The stand-
ards were raised to make it an honorary fraternity as
well as a professional fraternity. Only juniors and
seniors in the department of mechanical engineering
are considered eligible for membership.

In the past the fraternity has given a prize to the
outstanding sophomore in the mechanical engineering
school. Since Pi Tau Sigma has reorganized on campus,
this prize has not been given, but the members hope to
continue this practice in the near future. The Tau
chapter intends to have at least one social function
during each semester. Meetings are held once every
two weeks, then activities are planned and social
functions are discussed. Pi Tau Sigma is well on the
way to successful reorganization.

The officers for the year were as follows: Presi-
dent, Alan B. Alter; Vice-President, Truman O.
Andrews; Recording Secretary, E. Duane Stuart;
Treasurer, Robert W. Jackson; Historian, Albert N.

QUAX SUSTAINS AN INTEREST AMONG PITT WOMEN IN FIELDS OF SCIENCE

UAX IS THE women’s science society which
taps members in recognition of high schol-
arship in the ﬁeld of science. The purpose
of Quax is to inspire and develop interest
in science among its members.

Members are chosen from upperclass women with
a sincere interest in science who have attained not only
a high scholastic standing in their major subject but
who also have attained a high scholastic average in all
of their studies.

This year Quax sponsored a series of lectures in
all ﬁelds of science as their service to the women
science students of the University. The calendar for
the year included social events as well as educa-
tional meetings. Dr. Russell from Pitt’s own depart-
ment of psychology spoke on psychology at one of the
ﬁrst Quax meetings of the school year. Next in the
series of lectures was a lecture on biology given by Mr.
Cribbens. Then Dr. Mary C. VVarga, associate pro-
fessor of physics at Pitt, discussed the ﬁeld of physics.

On the social side the annual tea was held at Stephen
Foster Memorial. During this tea the active members
became acquainted with women students majoring in
all ﬁelds of science; biology, chemistry, mathematics,
physics, and psychology. To this meeting in the social
room of Stephen Foster the alumnae members of Quax
were also invited. At the annual social meeting Dr.
Mary E. Warga, Quax advisor, showed colored slides
of her recent tour of France and England. Following
this meeting the Heinz Chapel Choir gave a program
of sacred and secular music. The members of Quax
also had a chance to test their athletic ability at a
bowling party, one of their ﬁrst social events. A picnic
was one of the more important Quax social events in
the Spring. Final activity for the year was the annual
initiation banquet in the spring for all of the
members and the new tappees.

The ofﬁcers for the year were as follows: Presi-
dent, Vilma Tarasi; Vice—President, Jean Irwin;
Secretary, Mary Jane Wall{o; Treasurer, Ann Stitt.

QUO VADIS WORKS TO SPREAD KNOWLEDGE OF PITT NATIONALITY ROOMS

U0 VADIS is an honorary Organization at
the University of Pittsburgh composed of
Nationality Room Hostesses. The purpose
underlying all the principles and activities
of this group is threefold: to create public
opinion and student participation sympathetic with
the ideals symbolized in the Nationality Rooms at the
University; to instill an understanding of the inter-
dependency of nationalities of the world. The Nation-
ality Rooms are an important part of Pitt, not only in
beauty alone, but also in what they represent. They
are gifts to the University from various countries.
Committees which are made up of men and women
who have come from the speciﬁc countries represented
have worked diligently and industriously so that we
may learn something about the culture of the country
and learn more about the people who are living in the
country represented. .
Each year on Tap Day, Quo Vadis taps to mem-
bership those girls judged deserving. At the time of
their entrance into Quo Vadis, they are to be carrying

127

no less than twelve credits on campus. They must have
served a total of twenty-seven hours or more of active
duty as a Student Hostess, four hours of which shall
have been completed during special occasions. This
special duty consists of acting as a Nationality Room
Hostess at such events as°the Chancellor’s Reception
for parents of freshmen, acommencement ceremony,
or a special convention of visitors to the Nationality
Rooms. Among such visitors this year were the
Pennsylvania Congress of Parents and Teachers; Lord
Inverchapel, the British ambassador; Vambery,
Hungary’s foreign minister, and the wives of members
of the Kiwanis Club.

The Quo Vadis symbol is that of the iris. The pin
is a gold Cathedral of Learning surrounded by a blue
and gold world.

The ofﬁcers for the year were as follows: Presi-
dent, Betty Pickholtz ;Vice—President, Betty Flanagan;
Secretary, Marie Adele Reagan; Treasurer, Arline
Rawlings; Faculty Advisor, Miss Elizabeth Jane Wood.

TO ADVANCE THE EARTH SCIENCES IS THE AIM OF SIGMA GAMMA EPSILON

HE PURPOSE or THE Sigma Gamma

Epsilon fraternity is the scientiﬁc, schol-

astic, and social advancement of its

members, and the extension of the relations

of friendship and assistance between the
universities and scientiﬁc schools with recognized
standings in the United States and Canada, and the
upbuilding of a national college society devoted to the
advancement of the Earth Sciences.

Sigma Gamma Epsilon, a national professional
honorary fraternity, is represented at twenty-eight
schools throughout the United States. The chapter at
the University of Pittsburgh and the chapter at the
University of Kansas are the two oldest chapters in
the national Sigma Gamma Epsilon fraternity. Today
at Pitt the Beta chapter has an active membership of
thirty-four with its alumni members numbering into
the hundreds. Inactive during the war, the Beta chapter
was reactivated in the fall of 1945. The spring and fall
semesters have found the fraternity the most active in
its history here. Sigma Gamma Epsilon held its

128

national convention in October 1947 at St. Louis,
Missouri. The Pitt chapter sent as its delegate the
chapter's president, Frederick W. Hassett. Fred
returned from the convention with a report showing
that the fraternity was looking forward to'a more
active and progressive future. This progressive, wide-
awake attitude was reﬂected in the activities of the
many Sigma Gamma Epsilon fraternity chapters.
These activities included initiation banquets, picnics,
smokers, and dances on the social side. This wide
social program was secondary, however, to the more
important educational side. Talks by men of industry
and education, movies, and inspection trips appealed
to the more intellectual nature of the members. These
activities have helped to make the Beta chapter one
of the best in the national organization.

The officers for the year were as follows: Presi-
dent, Frederick W. Hassett; Vice—President, Paul
Land; Secretary, Jack Mason; Corresponding Secre-
tary, William Crawford.

SIGMA KAPPA PHI UNITES LANGUAGE MAJORS IN THEIR COMMON INTERESTS

IGMA KAPPA PHI, national honorary foreign

language fraternity, provides a mutual bond

of language interest for its members and has

as its motto, “Scholarship, knowledge and

fellowship". Its chief aspirations are to pro-
mote a high standard of scholarship among students
of foreign languages, to study the languages, history,
geography, literature, and customs of foreign lands,
and to create a spirit of unity and cooperation among
students who are vitally interested in other languages.
Sigma Kappa Phi also stresses recognition of outstand-
ing ability and attainment in the foreign languages
and the stimulation of advanced work and individual
research in the language ﬁeld.

Chief prerequisites for membership in Sigma
Kappa Phi are the completion of course nine in French,
Spanish, or German, or of comparable courses in
Greek or Latin, plus a general average of 2.0 and not
less than 2.2 in the language in which the student is
qualiﬁed. Participation in fraternity activities does
not cease upon graduation, for after initiation students

129

become active for life, remaining in the group as
alumni members.

Sigma Kappa Phi, national honorary foreign
language fraternity, received its charter in 1921. Since
then its history at Pitt has been marked by such
annual events as the giving of keys on Tap Day to
outstanding foreign language students and the tapping
of members on Scholar's Day. Beside these, the
fraternity has sponsored public language programs
and parties planned according to the customs of other
countries. In the monthly meetings this year, Sigma
Kappa Phi's general objective has been developed
through varied program material, centered not only
on the languages and related topics of foreign countries,
but also on the important role of language in the world
of today.

The ofﬁcers for the year were as follows: Presi-
dent, Ruth Tomasik; Vice-President, William Grant;
Secretary-treasurer, Natalie Young; Corresponding
Secretary, Janet Neesham; Alumni-secretary, Patricia
Brown.

SIGMA TAU RECOGNIZES AND FOSTERS ACHIEVMENT AMONG THE ENGINEERS

HEN DEAN E. A. HOLBROOK came

to the University in 1927, there

was a local engineering honorary

by the name of Alpha Omicron. In

May 1930, at a dinner and ceremony

in the old Faculty Club, Alpha
Omicron became a part of the national engineering
society of Sigma Tau. That was the beginning. The
chapter prospered and grew until today active mem-
bership consists of over one-hundred juniors and
seniors in the School of Engineering and Mines. On
engineering hill, Sigma Tau numbers among its
alumni Dean Holbrook and over one-third of the
engineering faculty.

Qualiﬁcations for men who have attained the
status of juniors are on the basis of scholarship,
practicality, and sociability—the qualities which
seem to indicate promise of future professional success.

Sigma Tau, sometimes referred to as the Phi Beta
Kappa of engineering, began this year with a long

SIGMA TAU

range program designed to best carry out the ideals
of its founders: to recognize the achievements of
engineering students, promote the interests of the
engineering school, and encourage fellowship among
congenial colleagues.

Among the year’s activities were a hard-times
dance at South Park and a get-acquainted smoker for
pledges. The University Club was the scene of the
initiation and banquet in January when thirty pledges
were initiated. At this time honorary membership was
conferredupon Dr.J.A. Allen, Westinghouse Graduate
Professor of Engineering.

To encourage freshmen, Sigma Tau presents each
year two medals to the top scholastic freshmen.

The officers for the year were as follows: Presi-
dent, John G. Koenig; Vice-President, Frank M.

SIGMA THETA TAU ENCOURAGES CREATIVE WORK IN THE NURSING FIELD

IGMA THETA TAU is the only scholarship
society of nursing. The purposes of this organ-
ization are to foster high professional stand-
ards; encourage creative work in nursing; to
promote the maximum development of the
nurse and thus increase her capacity to serve her
profession and, through it, society; to promote the
spirit of fellowship among members of the profession
of nursing; to develop an abiding interest in the ad-
vancement of nursing, and to promote continuous
participation as responsible members of the pro-
fession. The organization is comparatively young.
having been established at the University of Indiana
School for Nurses in 1922. Eta Chapter, University of
Pittsburgh, was organized on June 3, 1946. The
National President is Miss Frances George, a member
of our own faculty.
To be eligible for membership, a basic professional
student must have completed one half of the program

leading to the degree of Bachelor of Science in Nursing.
In addition these students must be in the top one-
third of their class, shall have demonstrated qualities
of leadership and a capacity for professional growth
and shall possess desirable personal qualiﬁcations.

Graduate students who have completed one half
of the program leading to the Masters or Doctors
degrees with a major in Nursing Education may also
be eligible for consideration to membership. The
General Chapter has provided that persons who have
gained wide recognition for original research or
administration in nursing, or persons who have
gained unusual distinction in any ﬁeld contributing
to human welfare may be recommended to General
Council for honorary membership.

The officers for the year were as follows: Presi-
dent, Virginia Braley ; Vice-President, Kathryn Patter-
son ; Secretary, Elaine Tyrie ; Treasurer, Roma Kossler;
Archivist, Margery Avery.

THEATRON AWARDS GO TO STUDENTS MOST OUTSTANDING IN DRAMATICS

HEATRON, HONORARY DRAMATIC FRATER-

NITY, was organized in 1938 for the pur‘

pose of providing recognition for those

students and faculty members whose

work in or with campus theatrical pro-
ductions was of superior quality. Qualiﬁcation for
nomination for membership is that the candidate be
a member of Pitt Players and that he demonstrate
sustained talent, ability, and initiative in the accom-
plishment of his duties.

Paralleling Hollywood’s and Broadway's present-
ations of their famous “Oscar" and Drama Critics’
Awards, Theatron, also, offers its own awards. A vital
portion of the program of the society is the presenta-
tion, at the end of each school year, of the Theatron
Award. Recipients are two students who need not
necessarily be members of the group but who have
done outstanding work in their respective ﬁelds
during the current school year. One award is given
to the ﬁnest student-actor; another award is given to
the student whose accomplishments in the technical
aspect of the theatre have been most notable. The

First Row: M. Harris; C. M. Robinson; M. E. Hershberger; R. \Vallace.

Acting Awardee is chosen by a board of ﬁve judges
who are members of the faculty and are selected at the
beginning of each school year by Theatron members.
Members of Theatron act as their own judges for the
choice of the Technical Awardee because they have
many more opportunities to observe and record the
work which is achieved backstage than would the
faculty critics. In addition to the two highest awards,
books and plaques are presented to other deserving
persons for their exemplary work. Using as their
symbol the traditional Greek Mask of tragedy, mem-
bers of Theatron hope to stimulate and perpetuate an
appreciation of “good thei1tre” within their own ranks,
as well as among the entire student body of the Uni-
versity. It was for this end that the members worked
throughout the year.

to progress and grow through work and

a service; and in.turn make his University

THE STUDENTS’ GOVERNING BODY WINS THE APPLAUSE OF SCHOOL

0 STUDENT CONGRESS falls the dual re-

sponsibility of planning the eXtra-curricu-

lar life at Pitt and regulating the rela-

tions between the individual student, his

fellow students, and the University. In ad-
dition to these functions as planner and regulator,
this fourteen man undergraduate legislative body must
perform the always monotonous and usually thankless
tasks of administrator and executive. In one or more of
its phases Congress continually touches the college life
of each student, from the time of his admission to the
day of his graduation. \Norking quietly through
President George Lynn or its committees, the Congress
obtains for the student the extra trimmings which
raise college life above the level of mere classroom
learning.

Of Congress’s many committees perhaps the best
known is the Social Committee, headed by Bob
Dickey. No (lance or social function can be held at
the University without this committee’s sanction. It

serves as trafﬁc manager and legislator, allotting
space on the social calendar and sponsoring dances of
its own; it reviews all petitions from campus organiza-
tions seeking permission to conduct social affairs; it
passes and enforces the code of social regulations.
During the past year the committee sponsored such
notably successful affairs as the Soph Hop, the Junior
Prom, the Freshman Dance and a series of afternoon
tea dances.

Bob Ingrim and his Assemblies Committee ﬁll a
spot comparable to that of the Social Committee. In-
grim and his assistants plan and sponsor all Univer-
sity-wide gatherings. These may take the form of pep
rallies (there were four such rallies this year) or
lectures. The lectures bring to the University speakers
of national reknown such as E. Stanley Jones, who
spoke on world-wide religion, Hal Lehrman, and
Kernit Roosevelt, an authority on the Middle East,
who appeared here this year.

Possibly the least-known of the Congress com-
mittees is the Appointments Committee of which
Janet Neesham is chairman. This body must sift
through student applications, interview candidates,
and ﬁnally appoint the men and women who ﬁll the
myriad posts of responsibility for school dances and
for such occasions as Spring Festival and Scholars
Day. On the degree of wisdom and insight with
which they carry out their job depends, in a large
measure, the success or failure of student functions.

The work of these committees constitutes the
year after year routine tasks that each new Student
Congress must tackle. But this year’s Congress, led
by President Lynn, refused to content itself with
merely doing the ordinary. It sought out and grappled
with some vexing problems which have faced the Uni-

versity for some time.

Most notable example of Congress’s offensive
tactics was the athletic probe. The crushing 69-0
defeat at Michigan, which brought Pitt to the nadir of
its 10 year athletic decline, caused Congress members
to demand a full investigation into the University’s
athletic policy—a demand that became a reality
when a committee composed of three undergraduates
and three alumni members was appointed to study the
athletic situation and recommend changes in policy.

Congress grasped another nettle in the Henry
Wallace affair. Though it did not succeed in obtaining
University permission for Mr. Wallace's speech, it did
manage to prod administrative ofﬁcials into granting
hearings—hearings aimed at a revision, or at least a
clariﬁcation, of the University's present policy toward
political speakers.

Though these two events brought it into the
spotlight, other examples of Congress's new found will
to act dotted the year. A representative list of these
accomplishments might include the establishment of
the Pitt Chest, moves toward afﬁliation with the
National Student Association, passage of an amend-
ment that partially rectiﬁed the representation quotas
in Congress, setting up a Demonstration Block for
football games. And there were a host of minor achieve-
ments that ranged from the procurement of a check
room to an investigation of the lack of cold drinking
water.

By the time the books closed on the current year,
even its severest critics conceded that, taken as a
whole, the year was one which not only Congress
members, but the student body as well, could review
with a great deal of pride and satisfaction.

MEN’S COUNCIL SERVED THE NEEDS OF EVERY SCHOOL IN THE UNIVERSITY

GROWTH OF 250% over the previous year’s

Council was one of the outstanding

features of the 1947-48 Men’s Council.

The College was represented by 15 men,

the School of Engineering and Mines by
8 men, and the School of Business Administration by
7 men. This representation of 30 men was the largest
in University history for Men’s Council.

Beginning in the Spring of ’47, Men’s Council
again began serving the needs of the school. The ﬁrst
thing brought up for consideration was a request to the
Athletic Department for more seats in the student
section for the football games. This request was acted
upon favorably, giving the students more seats than in
any previous year. During the summer session men’s
Council opened the Men's Council Bookstore for the
ﬁrst two weeks of school. This bookstore was also
open for two weeks during the fall and spring semesters
enabling all students to buy their books at a lower

cost than at the University Bookstore. The Council
carried on the freshman orientation program and
awarded the Panther Keys. With the assistance of
VV.S.G.A. the Council sponsored freshmen mixer
dances.

The members of Men's Council were prominent in
their service as camp counselors at the 17th Annual
Freshmen Camp, as upperclass counselors, and as
leaders in important positions on publications and in
other University activities. The members, as repre-
sentative of men in the College, in the School of Engi-
neering and Mines, and in the School of Business
Administration, did a ﬁne job in ’47-’48.

The officers for the year were as follows: Presi-
dent, Chuck Davis; Vice-President, Gene Thrasher;
Secretary, Bob Kauffman; Treasurer, Jack Barto;
Student Congress Representative, Bill Fisher; Publica-
tions Board Representative, Ray Killeen.

Women’s Self- Government Association

WSGA AND SENIOR COURT COMPLETE YEAR OF GUIDANCE AMONG FRESHMEN

NITING ALL THE VVOMEN of the University

in an ideal friendship through a well-

organized democratic government is the

aim of W.S.G.A. The Women's Self-

Government Association. representing a
unique governing organization among college cam-
puses of the country, fulﬁlls the real meaning of its
name and gives the women an active part in university
life over and above their formal education.

The Commission of W.S.G.A., composed of the
elected officers, the chairmen of the standing com-
mittees, Senior Court, and the representatives elected
by the various other women’s organizations on the
campus serves as a unifying force as it decides the
program for the year.

The purpose of VV.S.G.A. is all-inclusive yet
highly specialized and requires the services of a
great many standing committees. To guide the fresh-
men through their ﬁrst difﬁcult months the Customs
Committee teaches them about Pitt Customs, and the

Social Committee and Men’s Council give freshmen
.Mixer Dances. Much of the work of W.S.G.A. is
effectively done through these standing committees.
Other committees are the Activities Committee which
makes a study of the number of women who are taking
part in various activities; the Customs Committee
which strives to make freshmen women an integral
part of the University as quickly as possible; the High
School Relations Committee which attempts to inter-
pret college and university life to the high school
student by inviting groups to visit the campus; the
Housing Committee which studies the housing of both
individual students and organized groups of women
on campus; the Red Cross Committee, newest commit-
tee on campus, which correlated National Red Cross
Activities with collegiate interests in the organiza-
tion; the Scholastic Honors Committee which encour-
ages high scholastic records among women students;
the Social Committee which works with other social
chairmen on campus to promote high social standards

SENIOR CLASS CABINET

THE SENIORS MADE THEIR LAST YEAR A GOOD ONE, A YEAR TO REMEMBER

NITING SENIOR WOMEN in extracurricular

activities to add feeling and friendliness

to their academic interests was the aim of

the Class of 1948. What could have been a

ore ideal name for the Senior Class’ ﬁrst

social affair than “The First of the Last"? October 31

was the ﬁrst time the women got together, and from

the results of the skit each girl presented, many

humorous incidents were remembered about their

college life. To inject enthusiasm and spirit into the

girls, the Senior Rally, under the direction of Betsy

Briant, was held November 25. Class cheers were

rehearsed, and a few senior girls full of the old 1948

class spirit were chosen as cheer leaders for the big

sing which came on December 10. Senior women,

usually thought of as “quiet” and “reserved,” let their

hair down and screamed and yelled with the under-
classmen.

150

By the time the senior women became oriented
to school again after their Christmas vacation, the
Sophomore Party was held in honor of the Senior
Class. The last big senior activity before graduation
was the banquet held March 17. This affair climaxed
the women's four years at Pitt. And then as the last of
the last was the Mothers Tea in May. With the quiet
atmosphere of the Commons Room, the soft music of
the organ, senior women chatting to the mothers of all
Pitt women, the tea was a pleasant affair and acted as
a close to the social program of the Class of 1948.
Under the guidance and advice of the class advisors,
Mrs. McIntosh and Mrs. Wheeler, the senior class had
a well-planned and interesting year.

The officers for the year were as follows: Presi-
dent, Miriam Seiner; Vice-President, Dolores Stumpff;
Secretary, Doris Kalet; Treasurer, Dolores Hartman;
W.S.G.A. Representative, Ruth Barton.

JU INOR CLASS CABINET

JUNIORS DIVIDE TIME BETWEEN BOOKS, CLASS, AND SOCIAL FESTIVITIES

HE JUNIOR YEAR AT PITT for the Class of

1949 was not all toil, tears, and trouble.

It was liberally sprinkled with social

functions. Early in the fall, the members

of the Class of ’49 decided to make this a
year of congenial gatherings featuring original themes
for each. From the warm friendliness created at all of
the parties this plan was a tremendous success. Soon
after the enactment of the Pageant of Light at the
inspiring Lantern Night services, the ﬁrst social event,
“The Junior Frolic,” got under way on the twelfth
ﬂoor. The unique Halloween decorations and the
delight in the surprise program of square dances made
the ﬁrst event of the year a success. The “Junior
Salute" was marked by a demonstration of the “new
look” in fashions. With the approach of the Christmas
holidays, the Class of ’49 decided to join in the celebra~
tion. At “Santa’s Surprise” party the Juniors, radiat-

ing holiday cheer, chatted amid the traditional holly
and mistletoe decorations.

After mid—term Vacation the Class of '49 relaxed
and renewed acquaintances at the “Junior Coke
Caper.” Almost everyone bemoaned their quality point
average and parted with the determination to break
all scholastic records during the spring semester.

VVith the approach of Spring, the Junior women
turned their thoughts to the coming year which would
climax their life at college. An appropriate “April
Shower” party closed the social calendar for the year.
And so this talented class of ’49, after the completion
of their third year at the University, looked forward to
returning as Seniors in the fall.

The ofﬁcers for the year were as follows: Presi-
dent, Barbara Schropp;Vice-President, Ruth Raupp;
Secretary, Joanne Johnston; Treasurer, Abby Clark.

SOPHOMORE WOMEN REMEMBER WINNING TOP HONORS AT INTER-CLASS SING

ROMOTING FELLOVVSHIP among sophomore

women and successfully combining extra-

curricular activities with scholastic achieve-

ment was the aim of the Class of 1950. Just

a quick look at their social calendar will
explain why the sophomore girls were always busy.
W'ith tacks and pins and last minute preparations the
Class of 1950 got off to a “bang—up" start on November
4 with a “Coke—tail" party on the twelfth ﬂoor. The
next event on the girls’ program was a picnic to which
the girls brought their dates, who were put to work
toasting marshmallows and chestnuts over a huge
bonﬁre for their hungry companions. In December the
main excitement was over the traditional Inter-Class
Sing, at which each class presented an interesting
program with the theme being “Pitt of Tomorrow”.
The sophomores walked off with top honors from this
vocal contest with their skit of “Station ATOM—izer,”

originally represented with a perfume bottle. One of
the biggest events on the agenda after the new year
was under way was a fashion show sponsored by
Gimbels in which the sophomores paid tribute to their
sister class, the seniors. After this successful event the
girls polished up on their “p’s and q's" and escorted
their “favorite dates" to the Father—Daughter banquet
held in the University cafeteria. Then came the Saint
Valentine’s day “Heart Hop" to which the girls had a
chance to ask their “big moments” to one of the largest
dances of the season. The last event in which the
sophomores participated during the year of 1947-48
was the Mothers’ Tea in the Commons Room.

The officers for the year were as follows: Presi-
dent, Mildred Egge; Vice—President, Patricia Leix;
Secretary, Lois Hager; Treasurer, Betty Bolger;

ENGINEERING AND MINES CABINET

THE MEN WITH SLIDE RULE TECHNIQUE HAVE GROWN IN SIZE AND UNITY

HE YEAR 1947-48 brought to the School of

Engineering and Mines the largest enroll-

ment in the School's history. These men

brought not only a desire for knowledge,

but also a new “esprit de corps” to the
classrooms of the Engineering School. The E and M
Cabinet, representing the students of their school,
endeavored to encourage this spirit by presenting an
attractive social program and by coping with the
problems of crowded conditions. Problems such as
inadequate facilities of the Student Lounge were met
and remedied. Through reports made in the depart-
mental seminars, the Cabinet also aimed at better
support from the Engineering school for the Univer-
sity dances, assemblies, and other social functions.
The Cabinet worked hard at building up a closer rela-
tionship between the School of Engineering and Mines
and the other schools of the University, a relationship

154

which had been weakened by the sudden overpopula-
tion of all the University schools after the war. A big
feature of the year was the separation of the aeronau-
tical students from the mechanical engineering
seminar, enabling each group to be individually repre-
sented on the Cabinet. Realizing, also, the need for a
balanced social program, the Cabinet sponsored a
year round program of events. A summer picnic at
South Park, a smoker for the E and M freshmen, the
annual Thanksgiving dance, the Feudin’ Frolic in the
ballroom of the William Penn Hotel, and a Spring
dance were the highlights of a varied social schedule.

The officers for the year were as follows: Presi-
dent, Myer Rosenthal; Vice-President, Ed Stuart;
Corresponding Secretary, Ralph Simmons; Recording
Secretary, John Kosperlco; Treasurer, Jacob Pantuk-
hoff.

STUDENT-FACULTY NURSING ASSOCIATION PROMOTES HIGH NURSING IDEALS

TUDENT-FACULTY NURSING ASSOCIATION is an

organization comprised of the faculty and all

the students of the School of Nursing. The

group attempts to establish valuable associa-

tions and provide student activities that
promote a happy, balanced school life. The organiza.-
tion also aims to uphold the high ideals of the nursing
profession as well as to promote the well-being of those
attending the school.

In September of the past year, a Senior Mentor
program was instigated as an aid to the student. The
program helped the student contribute to a maximum
to the school and the nursing profession as well. The
girls also derived a greater beneﬁt from the school's
educational and social programs.‘ In addition to serv-
ing these purposes, the Mentor program provided a
friendly atmosphere and fostered many friendships as

155

the girls were oriented to new surroundings.

Among the social affairs provided for the students
were the several monthly social events and annual
banquets. At Halloween, Christmas, and St. Patrick’s
Day special parties were held. The highlight of the
social season was the annual Nursing Ball in January
at the Hotel Schenley. In May, the Florence Night-
ingale Memorial Service took place in the Heinz
Chapel. These affairs, which were memorable ones for
students in the School of Nursing, helped to balance
the social and educational life of these future nurses.
The Florence Nightingale Memorial Service especially
typiﬁed the high ideals of the nursing profession and
presented a challenge and a goal for these students.

The officers for the year were as follows: Presi-
dent, Olive Sabar; Vice-President, Geraldine Barrett;
Secretary-Treasurer, Velma Adams.

1948 SEES REVIVAL OF INDEPENDENT ASSOCIATION ON UNIVERSITY CAMPUS

NEVVCOMER to the Pitt campus this year

was the Pitt Independent Association.

An entirely different organization from

the one which was formed just before the

war, the PIA was ofﬁcially; recognized on

February 20, 1948 and placed on the customary
probation period of one year until it proved itself.

However, during the ﬁrst few weeks after PIA
was recognized it began to prove itself in a big way.
The ﬁrst formal gathering was held in Stephen Foster
Memorial on March 3, where Dr. Peter Gray, head of
the department of biological sciences, spoke to a
meeting of independent students. A tea held in the
Commons Room followed the address.

The next day, March 4, PIA really got under way
by introducing a plan that no campus organization
had previously used. The ﬁrst “Dance A Week” was
held on the twelfth ﬂoor of the Cathedral and was a

156

huge success. Succeeding dances were held on different
days of the week to accommodate students whose class
schedules interfered with a dance that would be held
on the same day each week.

The purpose of the organization as outlined in
the constitution is, “To plan, coordinate, and sponsor
social functions for members; to provide a medium for
expression of student opinion; to encourage school
spirit by fostering loyalty to the University; and to
cooperate with other student organizations to achieve
this aim”.

Following through with a complete social program,
PIA had a plan that included intramural sports in all
phases including participation in volley ball, softball,
swimming, golf, and track. Spring Festival activity
and other events rounded out the social calendar.
Faculty sponsors who aided the organization were
Fred Robie and Dr. Clarence Tryon.

ALPHA PHI OMEGA PROUDY SERVED THE UNIVERSITY FOR ANOTHER YEAR

INCE ALPHA PHI OMEGA has retur11ed to the

campus, there’s been no stopping them. Under

the guidance of the ﬁrst two Presidents,

Bernard Labuskes and Don VVingerd, the

Executive Board once again established a
program which would enable the Beta Chapter to do
the swell job they once did for the University before
they were forced to bow from the scene of campus life.
Shortly after its founding in 1925, the National Inter-
Fraternity Council classiﬁed Alpha Phi Omega as a
service fraternity.

At Pitt the Beta Chapter conducts all student
elections, works under the direction of the Dean of
Men in Freshmen VVeek, ushers at Commencement
and at Graduation, and performs many other services
to the University. But it's not all work for the mem-
bers of Alpha Phi Omega. Not long after the reorgan-
ization of the chapter, they again began sponsoring

157

their annual Snow Ball Dance which is the highlight
of the social program. Needless to say, few ever miss
the Founder's Day Banquet.

The members of Alpha Phi Omega are a genuine
cross-section of students at Pitt for they are non-
fraternity and fraternity men who are members of the
Pitt Band, the Y.M.C.A., numerous honorary and
professional fraternities, Student Government, Stud-
ent Publications, and many other extra-curricular
activities. Only those men who were or are at the pres-
ent time registered with the Boy Scouts of America
are eligible for membership in this fraternity. Then
from these, only those who can forget their own in-
terests while serving others are invited to join.

The officers for the year were as follows: Presi-
dent, Robert Hoon; Vice-President, Lloyd Horwitz;
Secretary, James Say; Treasurer, David Bright; Alum-
ni Secretary, Fred Greger; Historian, David Cowles.

KAPPA PSI’S PROSPECTIVE PHARMACISTS MIX BUSINESS AND PLEASURE

Looking back over four good years in Kappa Psi,
we realize how much we have to remember. Among
those items not to be forgotten are mornings such as
those after initiation and hell week. Dances, dinners,
weiner roasts (which always featured “Shoestrings
Seastead”), bowling parties, and good old-fashioned
bull sessions, usually featuring the question of pricing
prescriptions, always kept things humming. The
prescription question was never settled, but the
public may be getting a break in a few years if some of
the brothers retain their opinions. On the professional
side (yes, we had one), there were many discussions on
our plans for the future and on our ideas of present
day trends in the profession. Of course we had our
“characters" who will always be remembered: Bob “I
so move” Stevens; Caz “Now I think” Ianuzzi;
George “Parliamentary Rules” Hook; Bob “I need
money” Palchak; and many of the others. We wish the
best of luck to the brothers, Malion, Little, Guskea,

and Fischell who graduated in February, and to
Vavro, Testa, Foulk, Ianuzzi, Stevens, Palchak,
Boettner, and Urbani who graduated in June.

Men of Kappa Psi pride themselves on their past A

history. The fraternity was organized at the Medical
College of Virginia in 1897, and became active here
at Pitt in 1913. Today Kappa Psi is a strong national
professional fraternity and will remain so as long as
we have men of the caliber we have had in the past.
Professionally, the members of Kappa Psi strive har-
moniously to broaden their scope of knowledge, not
only in our own pharmaceutical profession, but in
other ﬁelds as well. Members of Kappa Psi are practic-
ing their profession throughout the country and so
upholding the ideals of their fraternity.

The officers for the year were as follows: Presi-
dent, Jack Foulk; Vice-President, Alvin Vavro;
Secretary, Edward Jones; Treasurer, Robert Palchak;
Faculty advisor, Dr. Edward P. Claus.

THE PSI OMEGA’S IN THE TRADITION OF TRUE DENTS, NEGLECTED NEITHER STUDIES
NOR SCHOOL ACTIVITIES IN THEIR PROGRAM FOR 1947-48

SI OMEGA, national professional dental fra-

ternity, claims the honor of being the oldest

dental fraternity in Pittsburgh. Forty-ﬁve

years ago, the ﬁrst Psi Omega chapter was

founded at Baltimore College of Dental
Surgery. Five years after the origin of the fraternity,
Nu, the local chapter, was established on the
University campus. The Psi Omegas have a twofold
aim: to promote and further the social qualities
and abilities of the members and to provide for the
general advancement of the dental profession. This
year, the Psi O’s concentrated on athletics, scholar-
ship, and social affairs. Sixty-ﬁve members met twice a
month in their chapter house at 230 N. Belleﬁeld
Avenue under their colors of blue and white. Beside
the dental advancement aspect, the Psi Omegas
carried on a vigorous sports schedule. This year they
won the H. E. Friesell trophy for their superiority in
the inter—fraternity combined sports program. Social

life at the Chapter house was not neglected either, as
frequent house parties proved. Besides holding three
after-game football dances, the Psi O’s held several
formals. Tommy Carlyn furnished the music for the
Christmas Dance which was held at the Roosevelt
Hotel, and we must not forget the annual Senior
Formal held in May. Two former members of Nu
Chapter, Dr. L. E. Van Kirk and Dr. W. F. Swanson,
now members of the Duquesne Alumni Chapter,
brought fame and honor to the fraternity when they
were chosen to positions of Dean and Associate Dean
of the School of Dentistry respectively. The Dents,
noted for their activity by no means lacked this
quality in 1947-48.

The ofﬁcers for the year were as follows: Grand
Master, Joseph L. Haller; Junior Master, Dalton H.
Deckman; Secretary, Raymond M. Ripp; Treasurer,
Caesar R. Fastiggi.

WOMEN’S ATHLETIC ASSOCIATION

WAA PROGRAMS STRESS PARTICIPATION OF INDIVIDUAL IN GROUP SPORTS

OSTERING AMONG THE WOMEN of the University

a spirit of play and extending to all women

students the opportunity of enjoying individual

or group sports was the purpose of the Women’s

Athletic Association for the year 1947-48. All
undergraduate women carrying twelve or more campus
credits are eligible for membership. Those wishing to
become members must participate in an activity and
show willingness to support the organization.

The Women's Athletic Association really knew
what activity meant this year. The girls started out
with the Freshman Carnival, October 15, at Schenley
Plaza Field, Schenley Park. Here freshmen and their
mentors spent the afternoon having their fortunes
read, throwing darts, and enjoying all the other
features of a carnival. WAA also sponsored archery,
volleyball, bowling and badminton’ tournaments.
Inter-class, fraternity, and independent teams par-

160

ticipated in each event. Sports chairmen for the year
were Jean Younginger, Ann Livingston, Marion
Vokovitch, Ethell Howell, and Marilyn Mahle.
Throughout the year WAA also sponsored mixer
dances on the twelfth ﬂoor. The 1947-48 board con-
cluded the season with a cook-out planned by the
outings chairman, Betty Voltz, at which the ofﬁcers
for the year 1948-49 were installed.

In every way the Women’s Athletic Association
of the University tried to contribute to the enjoyment
and well being of the women at Pitt. It was a job well
done by its ofﬁcers and members.

The officers for the year were as follows: Presi-
dent, June Schwartz; Vice-President, Betty Swadow;
Secretary, Peggy Dauley; Treasurer, Eleanor Berg;
Womer1’s Self-Government Association Representa-
tive, Ruth Descaunets; Faculty Advisor, Gyla Nicely_

PITKIN CLUB INTEGRATES CHRISTIAN IDEALS AND ACTIVE STUDENT LIFE

OW IN ITS THIRTY-FOURTH YEAR, the

Pitkin Club continues to be a religious

discussion group for Pitt students. Meet-

ing every VVednesday evening for dinner,

the group, presided over by Rev. Frank
Hutchison of the Shadyside Presbyterian Church,
attempts to ﬁnd some practical Christian solution for
various problems now faced by young Christians. The
Club was founded by Dr. Hugh Thompson Kerr for a
small gathering of Pitt students, but now has ex-
panded to almost one hundred members from Pitt and
PCVV. Not only are many problems discussed, but the
Club also attempts to foster a friendly atmosphere
among Christian students.

Realizing that a social program is an integral
part of Christian living, a few social events were
scheduled for the school year. Together with the
Teknon Club of Carnegie Tech, the Pitkin group held

a gala social event on Friday, January 16, at Thistle
Hall on the Tech campus. At a Christmas program on
December 17, the Pitkin Club took on the true Christ-
mas spirit by hearing the Christmas story read and
later singing carols. Richard Campbell and his com-
mittee had helped create the Christmas atmosphere by
beautiful decorations of Christmas ﬂowers, pine
branches, and a Christmas tree. In January the Rev.
James Dandridge spoke to the group in commemora-
tion of George Washington Carver Week. Since Mr.
Dandridge had been a personal friend of Dr. Carver,
his talk held an added interest for the club members.

The officers for the year were as follows: Presi-
dent, Robert VV. Dickson; Vice-President, Doris
Bish; Secretary, Virginia Curry (PCW); Treasurer,
Richard Campbell; Social Chairmen, Agnes Johnson
and Lucille McKay; Publicity Chairman, Howard
Smith.

YOUNG MEN’S CHRISTIAN ASSOCIATION PROMOTES INTER-GROUP RELATIONS

ANY CAMPUS ACTIVITIES are sponsored
and promoted by the Pitt YMCA
under the direction of J. Frederick
Miller and his associate, Fred Broad Jr.
The student can ﬁnd a wide ﬁeld for
expression in his “Y" associations.

Discussion clubs and study groups provide an
opportunity for religious expression and spiritual
development. Participation in the school intramural
sports program gives members an opportunity for
physical development and the experience which an
athletic program affords. Popular among students
have been the Social Inquiry trips, Wednesday Morn-
ing Breakfast Club, Pre-Med Forum, Pitkin Club,
Pitt Town Meeting, and Association Nights. The
YMCA encourages its members to participate in as
many other school activities as possible, for it is
through these outside interests that character is
developed.

The Freshmen Club, the Y’s Men Club, conduct-
ing its own program under the leadership of Hugh
Squitier, has grown and expanded its activity. A suc—
cessful Freshmen Camp at the beginning of the year
uncovered a spirited group of individuals whose
enthusiasm and talent will long be felt on campus. The
“Y” was also among the first of campus organizations
to reach students at the Ellsworth Center. They aided
freshmen in forming a Student Cabinet there.

National Student Assembly, Regional YM-YW
Conferences, and a Pitt Conference at Camp Caronda-
wanna have enriched the experiences of many students.

Student officers for the year were as follows:
President, James Cochran; Vice-President, Milan
Govic; Secretary, Rudy Balaban. Members of the
Student Committee of Management included Robert
Reighart, Robert Ingrim, Robert Dickson, Ed
Zadarozny, Jim Gallahger, and Franklin Blackstone.

YOUNG WOMEN’S CHRISTIAN ASSOCIATION BETTERS HUMAN UNDESTANDING

FTER OCCUPYING ﬁve different ofﬁces in
the Cathedral of Learning during the last
three years, the Y.W.C.A. has its perma-
nent home in Room 1204 of the University.
From this office throughout the year the
.VV.C. . goes on offering a planned program of in-
terest groups as a way to better human understanding.

Students who excel in leadership or those who
wish to cultivate that quality may ﬁnd challenges
in the Varied projects of service. This channel may
be through membership assemblies once a month or
Volunteer service in the community under qualiﬁed
supervision.

There is the realization of the necessity of political
understanding through discussion groups of students
and faculty as the “Y” aids in the planning of Break-
fast Club and Pitt Town Meeting. The World Student
Christian Federation is of deep concern to “Y”

   

164

members and they participate in campus conferences,
area conferences and national conferences to sharpen
their knowledge of current issues and to know more
about the world as a common ground of interest in
these days.

Recreation plays an important part in the “Y”
program through barn dances and competition of bowl-
ing groups under the direction of the Women’s Health
Education. Other types of parties are held in the
Pittsburgh branches of the Y.W.C.A. A concern and
spirit of goodwill prompted the entire association tc
go all out for a collection of clothing on campus which
was sent to the needy in Europe.

The officers for the year were as follows: Presi-
dent, Mary Jane Dunsmoor; Vice-President, Marie

THE PITT
VETERAN’S
ASSOCIATION

VETERANS’ ASSOCIATION AGAIN AIDED
STUDENTS IN SOLVING PROBLEMS.

N ITS THIRD YEAR on campus the Veterans Associa-

tion, a comparative newcomer on campus, swung

into action with a completely revamped program.

The purpose of the new set-up was to give the

veteran a highly organized and well-rounded
program of activities at Pitt. In addition to social
functions, the organization assisted the ex-GIs with
problems concerning housing, part-time employment,
and increased subsistence. In cooperation with the
Dean of Men’s ofﬁce, everything possible was done to
ﬁnd living accommodations for single and married
students. The Vet’s Association is the only recognized
veteran’s outﬁt on campus and is a strictly non-
partisan group.

During the gridiron season the organization
sponsored the Goal Post Dance at the Syria Mosque.
The affair was held as an open tea dance a few days
before the Pitt-Penn State game.

An intramural sports program was one of the P.
V.A’s activities outside its regular program. Teams
were organized in intra-mural sports in football and
bowling. The Vets went to a play-off in the independ-
ent league, but were forced to forfeit the ﬁnal touch
football game. The bowling program was highly
successful in providing the Vets with another active
sport, though no high honors were taken by the team.
The entire sports program was received enthusiasti-
cally by the veteran students as well as by the campus
as a whole.

The ofﬁcers for the year were as follows: Presi-
dent, James M. Madden; Vice-President, Al Capozzi;
Recording secretary, James Hersche; Corresponding
secretary, Clark Tomer; Treasurer, Helen Hoffman;
Directors, Tina Caputo, Ed Zadarowski, Sam Hobbs;
Social Chairman, Joe Wolfe; Athletic Chairman, Dave
Raley; Publicity Director, Dario Icardi.

THE PITT PLAYERS ENJOY ENTERTAINING THE STUDENT BODY AT PITT

President, Bill Aul

168

s ONE of the oldest campus organizations,

Pitt Players looks back on thirty seasons

of continuous dramatic activity. This

year saw the Players introduce their ﬁrst

regular director, Mr. Harvey Pope, from
the University of Alabama, who will direct plays and
teach play production. With Mr. Pope’s coming the
Players have embarked on an earnest program to gar-
ner nationwide recognition for their work.

All will agree that they have been successful as
far as they have gone. Last year’s production of “Joan
of Lorraine” received national publicity on Fred
Waring’s program. It was the first presentation of the
play off Broadway and launched Pitt Players on the
road to complete recovery from its wartime doldrums.

Now that they have a permanent director with
lots of ideas, as far as getting Pitt on the dramatic map
of the country is concerned, the group is rising to new
heights. The showing of “George Washington Slept
Here” in conjunction with the observance of the
thirtieth anniversary of Players in the fall entailed
feverish activity by the entire staff of the show.

Publicity in student and city papers told of Pitt
Players as one of the oldest dramatic groups in the
city. They basked in the spotlight with Cecil B. DeMille
when he was in Pittsburgh for the premiere of his
“Unconquered”. Mr. DeMille, along with Billy de
Wolfe, Lizbeth Scott, and Howard da Silva, visited the
campus and directed Pitt Players in a scene from the
picture.

VValter Pidgeon also came through when he at-
tended the Ohio State game. Mr. Pidgeon walked up
and down in front of the stands carrying a large
“George Washington Slept Here" sign. Besides Walter,
the fans also were aware of the show when an airplane
circled the stadium with a long streamer mentioning
the show and its play dates. These “big time’ stunts
were the ﬁrst in Player history. A formal reception
held after the premiere of “George Washington Slept
Here” was another unique ﬁrst. Formal invitations
were sent to representatives of dramatic groups in the Scenery experts Mike DeMarco, Players new technical director,
city, to critics, to ofﬁcers of the University, and to and Frank Petralak Study P13"5f°“1“‘3“’5et-
other civic leaders.

In the Spring Players presented Arthur Miller’s
recent New York hit, “All My Sons", for its ﬁrst
showing in Pittsburgh. This was followed by three one
act plays directed by students in April. The ﬁnal
production, the gay costume piece titled “The Would-
Be Gentleman”, translated from Moliere's French
comedy, was presented during Spring Festival.

The curtain was rung down on the year’s work
with the traditional Pitt Players banquet at the
Webster Hall. At this banquet new members were

tapped into the organization, ofﬁcers elected, and
awards presented to outstanding members for their
work during the season.

Pitt Players feels that the more prestige it can
garner for itself the better it can fulﬁll its aims of
showing desirable plays to the students and providing
opportunities for those who are interested to help in
the different phases of their production. They have a
place for their shows, Stephen Foster Memorial, and a

huge pool of student talent to draw on——even the
technical facilities are being enlarged. The Players own
workshop has added more tools and machines for set
construction and enlarged its storage space.

The officers for the year were as follows: Presi-
dent, William Aul; Vice-President, Eleanor Hersh-
berger; Secretary, Cora Robinson; Business Manager,
Harry Harris; Technical Manager, James Voris;

AP AND GOWN was founded in 1908 at what

was then the old Western University of

Pennsylvania, and appropriately enough the

first show in Cap and Gown's long history

was called “In Wupland”. Since that time
the organization has grown, as did the University itself,
and like the University found lean times during the
past war years. Cap and Gown became inactive in 1942
and remained so until its revival in 1946 with its first
postwar production, “Kilroy Is Here.”

The organization was reactivated on the campus
through the efforts of the Graduate Cap and Gown,
not to further the historical name of Cap and Gown,
but to give the men students at Pitt an opportunity to
participate in an activity that would bring out and
develop any theatrical talent they might possess. The
purposes of Cap and Gown are to foster the growth of
the individual at Pitt and to produce a show annually
that is in keeping with the Cap and Gown tradition.
This year Cap and Gown produced Mabel’s Fable, a
successful musical, typical of great Cap and Gown
shows. Following in the tradition of former years,
Mabel’s Fable was a gala revue climaxed by a grand
ﬁnale of speciality and featured talent.

Plans are already being laid for next year’s pro-
duction. Several Pitt students have worked on books
that will be submitted for consideration to the Grad-
uate Cap and Gown Club. One book will be selected
as the 1948 production.

The Undergraduate Club is made up of Cap and
Gown men who are tapped after each show as out«
standing participants in the production. The Under-
graduate Club is an honorary activity of Cap and
Gown and therefore selection is based on spirit and
cooperation in working with the group rather than on
acting or technical ability.

The officers of the organization are: Robert
Lazar, president; Kenneth Phifer, vice-president; Val
Slava, secretary; Jack Abramson, treasurer.

WOMEN’S SPEECH GIRLS SPEAK UP FOR SOCIAL EVENTS AND ACTIVITES

URING THE PAST YEAR the Women’s

Speech Association has shown an out-

standing increase in membership and

activities. The organization is composed

of women interested in speech, poetry,

discussions, and forums, and its program serves to

\ fulﬁll these interests in a friendly, social atmosphere.

Some of the activities of VVSA during the past year

included poetry reading sessions led by Clester Cook,

discussion forums of topics of current interest, and

numerous social affairs. One of the outstanding

forums presented this year was a discussion of the

UNO with Dolores Kelsey as chairman and Joan

Chronis, Barbara Russell, and Mae Fleming partic-

ipating. Professor Martin of the Political Science

Department, "an authority on the UNO, was guest
speaker at the meeting which followed the forum.

With the return of Beaux Arts Day, WSA and

Women’s Choral co-sponsored a program showing the
cultural side of the University to freshmen women
through tours, music, speeches, and the arts. Women's
Speech and the YWCA welcomed the yuletide at a
Christmas party held at the Stephen Foster Memorial.
In the spring the group held a square dance with the
Men's Debate at the Metropolitan “Y”. This dance
provided both groups with many pleasant memories.
Another traditional social affair was the annual fare-
well dinner for senior members of WSA. During the
program which followed the dinner, the Women's
Speech Guild performed, recreating some of their
guild activities. The senior girls were presented a rose
and each girl gave a short farewell speech.-

The ofﬁcers for the year were as follows: Presi-
dent, Elaine Saupp; Vice-President, Sally Oleon;
Secretary, Harriet Hilsenrath ; WSGA Representative,
Doris Bish; Social Chairman, Lois Sidler.

THE MEN’S DEBATING ASSOCIATION WAS ACTIVE IN CONTESTS AND TOURS

NCOURAGING PARTICIPATION in forensic activi-
ties, particularly debating, is the aim of the
Men’s Debating Association. It has been a
policy of this association to afford each member
every possible opportunity to engage in
forensics. Those who entered this organization without
previous training in such work have been given train-
ing and experience; those who joined to continue their
training and practice have been given the instruction
and the opportunities they sought. For the two-fold
purpose of providing audiences for its speakers and
stimulating civic interest the group founded a Speak-
er Bureau last December. This bureau provides
programs for interested clubs and societies in the
Pittsburgh district.
In late October eight men, engaged in a series of
thirteen debates, visited V\/estern Reserve University
and debated before over ﬁve thousand students in

176

Cleveland and Pittsburgh. The principal trips of the
year were those to the Delta Sigma Rho Tournament
at Madison, Wisconsin in early March, and the
Grand National Forensic Tournament at Fredericks-
burg, Virginia in late March. These activities were
supplemented with numerous individual debates
with visiting college teams, with tournaments at Mt.
Mercy, Penn State, Shippensburg, Kent State, Wash-
ington and Jefferson, and with intra-squad debates.

The Men’s Debating Association was reactivated 7

in the national honorary forensic fraternity, Delta
Sigma Rho. The organization also renewed its affilia-
tion with the Pennsylvania Debating Association.

The ofﬁcers for the year were as follows: Presi-
dent, John D. Rhodes; Secretary, Louis Lederman;
Manager of High School Relations, Fred F. Wolf;
Audience Manager, James C. Medley.

THE ROYAL-ROBED CHOIR IS A SOURCE OF PRIDE TO THE UNIVERSITY

USES PARKED in front of the Forbes Street

entrance of the Cathedral usually mean that

the Heinz Chapel Choir, one of the outstanding

college choirs in the country, is starting out on

another tour. The Choir, composed of approxi-
mately ﬁfty Pitt men and women, is under the direction
of Dr. Theodore M. Finney, head of the Department
of Music Appreciation. The group was organized by
Dr. Finney in 1938 for the primary purpose of singing
at student chapel services and Sunday Vespers in the
newly-built Heinz Chapel. Soon, however, the choir
began to give concerts for various churches and
organizations throughout the Pittsburgh area. In 1939
the singers from Heinz Chapel went on their ﬁrst
concert tour, and since then a similar tour is part of
the annual activities of the choir. Each September
the choir goes to camp for ﬁve days to re—organize
before school starts, and last year the group made

177

their ﬁrst appearance at Chautauqua Lake, New York.
The choir was proclaimed a success by the Chautauqua
music critics and plans are being made to return this
summer. In spite of this active program, the members
of the choir still ﬁnd time for their annual formal
dinner, held this year at the Faculty Club, and a
picnic at “Pop” Finney’s farm in the spring. Any
undergraduate student of the University may try out
for the choir by making an appointment with Dr.
Finney.

After one year of participation in the choir, mem-
bers receive silver keys, and at the end of two years,
they are given gold keys. Association does not stop at
graduation, however, for there is an active alumni
choir that meets every two weeks throughout the
school year. The Heinz Chapel Choir is a group held
together by a strong common bond—that of the love
of music.

i ON THE THIRTY-FIRST, IN THE HALLS, ITS THE PITT SINGERS——BOUND TO BE HEARD!

W0 YEARS AGO, sixteen men and women

who liked to sing met around a piano with

David Weiss, director of Women’s Choral

and Men’s Glee Club. This was the in-

formal beginning of the Pitt Singers.
Secular songs such as Katheri7ie’s Wedding Day, Go
Lovely Rose, Little David Play on your Harp, and The
Ash Grove composed the chief repertoire of the group.
Soon programs of the VVomen’s Choral and the Men’s
Glee Club began to feature the Pitt Singers. During
the year the group was well received at Seton Hill, the
YWCA Christmas party, and the Christmas Assembly
Program.

The enthusiasm of this small group received the
attention of the administration, and this year the
group was provided with a budget. Pitt Singers is now
the only mixed secular singing group on campus,
composed of thirty—ﬁve men and women selected

178

from members of Women’s Choral and Men’s Glee
Club.

In November the Pitt Singers joined the Men's
Glee Club at Seton Hill where a second appearance
had been requested. Further appearances of the year
were at the “Y” Christmas Party held at Stephen
Foster, Aspinwall Veteran’s Hospital, and St. Vincent's
College. At the VVomen's Choral Spring Concert, Pitt
Singers featured hit tunes from current Broadway plays.

So if you’ve been puzzled by the mixed harmony
which at the close of the fourth hour on Thursdays
has descended from the thirtieth ﬂoor with the ele-
vator——relax.' It's only the Pitt Singers bound to be
heard!

The officers for the year were as follows: Presi-
dent, Charles Anderson ;Vice-President, Frank Marvin;
Secretary, Eleanor Ankowski; Librarian John Wilson.

WOMEN OF THE UNIVERSITY CHORAL GROUP HAVE THEIR SAY SO

oMEN's CHORAL, whose purpose is

to foster the love of music among

the women of the University, con-

tributed a musical background to

many of the school’s activities
this year. The Choral, increased to ﬁfty members this
past year, opened its schedule early in the fall by sing-
ing at the annual Beaux Arts Day Program. This
program, co-sponsored with Women’s Speech Associa-
tion, presented the cultural side of the University to
freshmen women.

Late in the fall the Choral sang at a Wednesday
service in the Heinz Chapel. Later the groups pre-
sented a short concert at a Thanksgiving Tea and at a
Christmas program in the Commons Room. Several
short concert trips to other colleges in Western Penn-
sylvania followed these performances. In January the
group performed for the veterans at Aspinwall
Hospital with a concert of light classics and popular
numbers.

VVomen’s Choral is made up of sophomore, junior,
and senior women who are selected by audition. Al-
though freshmen women are not eligible to join the
Choral, they have an intermediate music group, the
VVomen's Choral Guild, which is under the direction
of an appointed member of Choral.

The Choral, under the direction of David VVeiss,
rehearses every Monday and Wlednesday on the twelfth
Floor of the Cathedral. At these rehearsals, as well
as in its programs, the group was accompanied by
Robert Runzo. Miss Mary B.Scanlon, M. A., instructor

THE MEN’S GLEE CLUB COMPLETES A WELL—ROUNDED YEAR.

ONSISTING OF SIXTY selected voices under

the capable direction of Mr. David Weiss,

the Men’s Glee Club has completed another

year in its calendariof top entertainment.

The group made a name for itself in the
Pittsburg district by singing at the various high
schools in addition to public concerts. When good
entertainment was needed, the Men’s Glee Club
could always be relied upon to come through. The
Glee Club began its season by singing at Seton Hill
College in Greensburg, and two days later the group
gave an excellent performance for the parents of
freshmen at the Chancellor's Reception. The local
concerts were all stepping stones to the eagerly
awaited Spring Concert Tour. The Glee Club gave its
first Concert of the tour at State College, Pa., the
second at Reading, Pa., and the third at Bethlehem,
Pa. From there the Glee Club went to VVhite Plains,

180

New York, then on to their ﬁnal performance at the
Chalfonte-Haddon Hall in Atlantic City. They re-
turned knowing they had been a credit to the Univer-

sity.
All members of the group were urged to make

contacts for these concerts, and some of the best and
most appreciative audiences have been found in this
manner. The group had three business managers who
served as co-ordinators after contacts had been made.

Contrast was added to the group this year by the
addition of more solo work and an impromptu quartet
known as the "Hemi-demi—semi-quavers".

The officers for the year were as follows: Presi-
dent, Fred Hassett; Vice-President, Robert Dickson;
Secretary, Joseph Heckel; Business Manager, Frank
Kodman; Assistant Business Managers, Charles
Anderson and Frank Marvin; Librarian, Wilbur
Stanko; Accompanist, Robert Runzo.

PUBLICATIONS

THE PANTHER

 

Aided and abetted by a staff liberally sprinkled
with GI’s, Editor Torn Perkinson threw Panther
magazines to the critical wolves six times the past
year. “T. A.” and his eager group of literati pledged
the Panther to be a magazine of general interest.
Dwight Zeller, managing editor, checked copy. After
passing the tests of this man of taste, the remaining

gems were pieced together for the printer by makeup Editor T_ A_ Perkinson
editor Mary Jo Litzinger. All of this resulted in “The
Panther”.

Two hours after an issue would hit the stand,
business manager Jack Moran and Jim Dowd, circula-
tion chief, would claim a sell out. Two hours later,
buyers would claim they had been sold out. Stu Work-
master, boss publicity man, would merely go around
claiming.

The staff lived up to their policy. Fiction Editors
Bernie Fischman and John Morrissey turned out
some good student writing. Articles by Feature Editor
Tony Glasser and Johnny Schnapp on sports added
spice to the magazine. Bob Gordon and Chuck
McKissock stood by to photograph and illustrate
madly.

Talking over last minute details are Stu Workmaster, Publicity Editor;

Business Manager Jack Moran Jean Elliot, Chick Ackleson, and Ann Boyles, Advertising Manager.

Pounding pavements in Oakland and the triangle,
hustling around the town trying to snare those neces-
sary ads, lifting and toting 100 copy bales of Panthers
was the work of the Panther business staff.

To the student body, Business Manager Moran’s
staff was pretty Panther salesgirls such as Jean Elliott
pestering them to “please buy a copy of the big, new,
improved Panther.”

After Workmaster’s publicity boys had paved the
way with their propaganda extraordinary, and Annie

Boyles had ﬁgured out bigger and better ways to get
advertising revenue, Jim Dowd’s circulation pretties
peddled the issue into the black.

Possesser of the biggest headache was Jim Huber,
the Mag’s comptroller. Trying to separate black ink
from red, and decipher statements, just about spelled
ﬁnis for Jim's sparse head of hair.

If headaches, king size, and hard work, a whole
cathedral—full make for valuable experience, the bus-
iness staff of the Panther has it.

Under Editor Bill Veenis, the News received a thorough face-
lifting that started with the title plate in September and ended with a
completely reﬁnished office in May. The Pittpurri and Frat Facts of
previous years were scrapped, making way for the new Social Light
and the all-inclusive Campus Canvass. The Tuesday edition, increased
to eight pages, got its own managing editor, Bill Catrow, while Harry
Keck managed the Friday paper. Mimi Cooper graduated to the newly-
created Art Editor’s post, and every member of the staff took a
crack at various desks in preparation for the large number of empty
seats left after graduation.

W/eathering a year of last—minute news breaks and controversial
issues may have thinned Don MacCormack’s hair or aged newlywed
Frank Davis, but there was plenty of off-the—record fun to balance the
real work.

The athletics investigation, and Sports Editor John Golightly’s
accompanying comments, added a little excitement. It was a quiet
week when some joker wasn’t threatening the editors with a libel suit
or using the crying towel thoughtfully hung on the wall. Off-moments
were ﬁlled in the ski trips to Seven Springs, athletic encounters with the
Panther Staff, and parties better imagined than printed.

When things really got dull, the Pitt News Apache team of
Catrow and Cooper put on free shows or Jayne Bibby passed around
an exploding can of peanut brittle. As usual, the line between fun and
work grew thin, and April Fool’s Day saw seven pages slapstick
sneaked in behind a sober front page.

Event of the year, however, was when the sheets top cartoonist,
Les Gallagher, came up with a serious literary work in the form of a
poem that ran in the Christmas edition, drawing more comment than
any of his equally-talented cartoons.

A visit to the 47-48 NEWS office found sixteen of the staff
members off in a corner, concerning themselves with dollar signs and
rulers rather than punctuation marks and dictionaries. The tall boy
with the hair and the ruler would have been Jerry Panas; the girl with
the ten pound ledger, Harriet Miller Steinberg, and the arms on the
end of a bundle of papers those of circulation manager Bud Schulberg.
Len VValk’s desk, piled high with ad copy, Chesterfield endorsements
and egg salad sandwiches would still have room for Bob Newcomer busy
designing a new ad for the College Cafe, Ivan Novick and Moe Kahn
tallying up the week’s receipts, and Howie Harris slicing ads out of past
issues. The darkest corner was ﬁlled by Sandy Shine, Irene Marcus,
Dorothy Pearlstone and Florene Kessler, busy with the major minor
jobs. Over all was “Red” Adler, making certain that everything was
being run efﬁciently, honestly, and . . . proﬁtably. If the visitor paused
long enough, he would have been treated to one of Jerry Panas’ special
smiles, one of Bernie Adler's salestalks, and a piece of Moe's candy
bar. Then he would have had just a hint of the goings-on connected
with one issue of the PITT NEVVS as seen from behind the cash
registers of the Business Staff.

EDITORIAL STAFF

Each day this year, between classes, at lunchtime, and long after eighth hour
classes were dismissed, a small group of University students could be found
working spasmodically in the dusty office on the eighth ﬂoor. Leading this little
group was Walt Thompson, the tall, lanky Editor who was never known to be seen
without his “personality" hat and blackened pipe. Associate Editor Mavis Loefﬂer
could usually be found in profound thought over the typewriter while Pat Hene-
ghan, Assistant Editor, played guardian angel to the Owl, doing everything from
writing copy to rescuing ﬁnal proof from the wastebasket. On the night shift was
Lee Karageorge, who spent most of his time hounding Sports Editor Dario Icardi
for deadline copy and pictures. Organization Editor Eileen Ross, spent her 12 :30
lunch hours the ﬁrst two months of school at the telephone making schedules for
group pictures. Bette Frost and Lamont Shuttleworth, Co-Editors on Fraternities,
made arrangements with the talented writers—or anyone eager to bring in the
social write-ups. Contacting the Honoraries for pictures and articles was the job of
Carl Angstrom and F10 Diemert. John Kuliguski and his photography staff,
Jayne Bibby, Marty Gluck, Stu Milliman, and Clem Larkin, were thinking of
signing up for track after all the experience they had in running from frat house to
swim meet to pep rally for action shots. Pat Seger and Bill Raines, Administration
Editors, had a hard time choosing members for the Faculty Personalities section
with so many eligible candidates. Chub Albright, Layout Editor, with his assist-
ants,‘ Jack Arch and Bob Fuhr, spent the midterm vacation on the eighth floor
with rulers and pencils trying to squeeze six pictures and a half page of copy
“neatly” on a page. Feature writers Betty McGuire and Sidney Stark could
always be counted on to write features, type, paste, or write captions and heads.
Rounding out the staff were Clare Starrett, Kitty O’Hagan, Bernice Rivlin, and
Shirley Levine. So went life in the dusty Owl office. Along with a never—ending
maze of confused days and late nights of working for a deadline, the ’48 Owl staff
turned the key over to the staff of ’49 with a wish that by working together they
may ﬁnd the pleasure that has been ours this year.

A well—organized and

BUSINESS STAFF

Salesmen scurrying around the halls selling books,
men sitting behind huge ledgers, and numerous
enterprising young people trying to interest business
concerns in advertising, these are the industrious
members of the Owl business staff. They balance the
books, supply the money, and try to keep us out of
the red. No punctuation marks for them; it’s dollar
signs instead. A visit to theioffice will convince one im-
mediately of the work necessary" to run a publication
such as the Owl. Sitting behind his desk, looking Very
patriarchal to his doting cohorts, is Business Manager
Dick Wallace, the hub of the business wheel. He will
usually be arguing with Harry Lenchner, the super
salesman who doubles as Assistant Business Manager.
The man behind those high powered selling devices
used to entice student support of the book is Scotty
Gardiner, Circulation Manager. If you see salesmen
running up to him with books full of subscriptions,
they’re probably Pat Leix and Frank Langsdale, the
high powered assistants on circulation. They preside
over a staff that combs the campus far and wide for
would be subscribers. No less diligent in the search for
money is Roy Barnes, the Advertising Manager, who
along with Fred Doerﬂer, Fred Obley and Gerald
Aland, combs the far stretches of the city lookingfor
money, contracts, and more money. With all this
money pouring in from all directions, somebody has
to record it and use it for paying bills. This job
falls to the Comptroller, Mel Oravetz. He and his
staff spend their days pouring over huge ledgers in an
attempt to make everything even. Mel and his as-
sistants, Sid Stark and Bill Bobbin, are the assets
and liabilities boys. So you see the Business staff is a
smooth working bureaucracy
where everyone has his job and does it.

PANHELLENIC COUNCIL HAS BANNER YEAR OF INTERSORORITY UNITY

ANHELLENIC COUNCIL is made up of all the
sororities on campus, each sorority repre-
sented by two members. Panhel irons out
the perplexities of rushing and other sorority
problems, but beyond that, sponsors an
educational and social program as a service to all
undergraduate women. It tries to establish unity
among all the women students at the University.
Panhel started off this _vear with the always im-
pressive Panhellenic Reception for Freshmen women
which was held in the Commons Room on November 1.
Next came the bonﬁre and Pep Rally before the Penn
State game where Panhel shared honors with the IF
Council and Student Congress. Panhel Sing, which
gives an opportunity for friendly competition between
the sororities, was again a big success. Kappa Kappa
Gamma walked off with the golden cup. Panhellenic
Ball, the formal dance at the \/Villiam Penn, was better
even than those in the past.
VVith the wholehearted support of the sororities
on campus, Panhellenic Council will always have bigger
and better things to look forward to in years to come.

Good afternoon, ladies, gentlemen, and students
of the University of Pittsburgh. This is Station WAE
Phi broadcasting from its spacious studio on the fourth
ﬂoor of the Belleﬁeld Dwellings. WAE Phi gives you
complete on-the-spot coverage of the events in the
studio, which is also the headquarters of the sorority
of the same name. Before I tell you what is happening
now, let me give you a preview of this evening’s pro-
grams. For your musical entertainment we have songs
by Jackie Oseroff, Renee Schorin, and Bea Schneirov,
accompanied by Ruth Levinson and Adyln Letwin. If
it’s laughter you want, listen to our favorite Come-
diennes, June Schilit and Joan Relchman. Audrey
Westerman is on hand with the second in her series of
lectures, “How To Become a Success and a Big Wheel."
For helpful hints on bigger and better social functions,
we present Iris Rosen; for aides in orientation, tune to
Chari Baker, noted pledge mother. And now back to

the goings—on in the studio. The nosies and laughter
you hear in the background are coming from a huge
party, an official “so long, active, now you’re an alum”
party. Those honored include: Zelma Schmidt, who is
greeting everyone at the door with her big smile; Gloria
Mendelson, who has just completed her farewell talk
on parliamentary procedure and foreign affairs; Jeanne
Hirsch, busily writing the minutes of the last few
months; Betty Rosenﬁeld, pounding the gavel for re-
freshments; Marilyn Mendoza, paying dividends to
the sisters from the excess of the treasury; Arlene Gold-
berg, on the clean-up committee for the last time;
Dicky Bernstein and Betsy Sachs performing one of
their own skits; and Shirley Lyon, your broadcaster,
who thanks all of you for listening.

Timeﬁj ust after dinner and just before meeting. Lois
Etzel, our newly engaged president, is sitting in the
presidential easy chair methodically assembling her
facts before beginning the meeting. Grace Freund,
treasurer for the year, is sitting to her left collecting
money and busily writing out receipts so her weekly
report will be up to date. We see Dolores Hartman,
Senior cabinet member, trying to concentrate on
assembling her minutes with her sister Pat, Panhel
treasurer, looking over her shoulder. Opal Wetzel,
member of Heinz Chapel Choir; Catherine Clayton,

chairman of the Sophomore Activities Committee;
Jean Irwin, vice-president of Quax; and Ruth Johnson
sprawled in the middle of the ﬂoor noisily argue over
the bidding in their game of ﬁve hundred. Fran
Thompson, Women's Choral librarian, already has her
pledges Lois Timmins, Harriet Eisenbeis, Mary
Macko, and Vernie Stanislaw, president of Junior
Panhel, assembled in the dining room. There must be
at least one bridge game somewhere. Yes, there it is.
Jean Daniels and Sylvia Smith, the Planetarium girls,
playing against Jerry Parks and Eleanor Johnson
with Joan James, YWCA secretary, peering over her
shoulder. Eleanor Pavlik is hammering on the piano

keys while Laura King, professional singer, renders her
version of “Temptation" for Naomi Campbell, KDKA
organist. As usual the early comers always get the
couch ﬁrst. Here are Marlyn Davies, Louise Anderson,
Jane Cooney, Caryl Garman, and Marilyn Matthews
talking over last Saturday night and their favorite
men. Its time for meeting to begin. Shall we leave the
girls until next year? VVait a moment! Alice Blattau,

side her looking for something slow and sweet; Dolores
Luppenacci trying out some tricky dance steps to a
fast new arrangement; Mavis Loefﬂer stretched on the
couch smiling while vivacious Margy Maher tries to
get in on the duration of the latest romance; Peggy
Moran appearing in the doorway and beginning her
Monday night ritual of counting heads preparatory to
beating the kids into getting meeting started. A typi-
cal Monday night—one that every Chi O treasures her
four years in college and remembers long after her
sorority days are over.

Officers for the year were as follows: President,
Mary Margaret Moran; Vice-President, Marguerite
Maher; Secretary, Virginia McCullough; Treasurer,
Dorothy Engel.

OUNG AND STRUG-

GLING, DELTA CHI RHO CONTINUES ON WITH HOPES OF A BRIGHT FUTURE, A FUTURE OF

WHICH OUR POSTERITY MAY WELL BE PROUD.

Starting up a new organization from scratch in
the face of strong competition is a difficult task, but
it can be done with a group of staunch charter mem-
bers with loads of gumption and the drive to “go.”
Among the active members of the sorority with these
qualiﬁcations, there are such personalities as Betty
Shore, a woman about campus with her Mortar Board
presidency and Senior Court position; Bernice Nathan-
son, also on Mortar Board; hard working Marilyn
Sparks, who led the sorority through its ﬁrst and tough-
est year; and Ruth Kaplan who took over the reins.
Ruth’s able co-workers were Gladys Hirsch and Estelle

Richest, Delta Chi Rho’s Panhellenic representatives.
Both girls have gained recognition in Panhel, Gladys
as the VVSGA representative from Panhel and Estelle
as the Editor of Who’s Who in Wamen’s Fraternities.
Harriet Bernstein, the treasurer, is an asset to any
group with her spark plug ideas. Dependable Rae Gelb
is ideal for the job of chairman of the sorority beneﬁt
for Child VVelfare. Selma Kalser Mellinger and Jean
Beck Chosky’s marriages did not separate them from
their sisters; they remained cooperative cogs in the
wheel. Lee Pinsker, Phyl Sitner, Tessie Slowne, Mimi
Kornitzer, Rita Finkelstein, Norma Barker, and Ruth

Pechersky have all been indispensable for the chapters
dances and luncheons. The secretary’s post is ﬁlled by
capable and sincere Mac Goodfriend. Rhoda Finn,
Dolly Levine, and Phyllis Linder became prominent
soon after their appearance in the organization. Rhoda
became Panhel Sing chairman for the sorority, Dolly
acted as social chairman, and Phyllis became a mem-
ber of many essential committees. Marilyn Rosenfeld
found herself entering at a time when she could con-
tribute her services to Various committees.

Our trip with Delta Delta Delta this year got off
to a sky rocket start at South Park with a picnic well-
planned by social chairman, Jeanne Elliott. Since then
the Tri Delts, led by president Betty Rogers, have had
their share of fun and service. Song birds, Evie Thomp-
son, Ruth King, B. J. Redman, Bobby Marley, Peg
Patton, Lee Stephenson, and Dotty Clemens, were the
sing team which, led by Rosemary Parlak, took third
place in the Panhel Sing. This singing trend was car-

UST AS ALADDIN’S
WONDERFUL LAMP BROUGHT RICHES TO ITS OWNER, THE GOLDEN LAMP OF DELTA ZETA
CALLS UP A WEALTH OF PLEASANT MEMORIES.

208

It was a day in June—graduation! Beth Hunker,
sitting alone in the living-room, removed her DZ pin
from her blouse, looked at it for a few seconds, then
rubbed its golden lamp softly. Memories began to
come back of days of DZ presidency with Beth trying
to gather thirty Delta Zeta’s together for formal
meeting. She remembered Jo Werner and Jean Leber-
man, February grads, wildly ﬁlling out job appli-
cations, and of the many times she called for room-
mates Engineer Pat Warner and Bus Ad student Mimi
V\/illiams to forget those accounting sheets and come
down for meeting. Memories of Vice-President Betty
Flanagan busily teaching Janie Southerland the pledge
lesson for the week; of Treasurer Nan West writing a
check to Sally Pow for the new phono records while
Secretary Pat Patterson rushed to pass out 3x5 cards
to several DZ’s who had been late for the last meet-
ing; of Parliamentarian Ruth Raupp; of Sophomores
Phil Artuso, Helen VVill, and Lois Hager translating
German on a cooperative basis; of Beth, locating
Heinz Chapel Choir members Marion Urling, Libby

Mclndoe, Edi Worcester, and F10 Walko; of Eileen
Ross, of Women’s Choral and choir members singing
the Heinz Chapel Choir special “There’s a Long White
Robe in the Heavens for Me”; of Ginny Sutch, Diz
Stumpff, and Margie Heinlein, the engagement trio,
surrounded by admirers Carolyn Pierson, Dewey
Davies, and Vina Elder; of Guild Advisors Ruth
Barton and Pat Heneghan talking over plans for the
Guild Fair with Cwen member Betty McGuire; of Lois
Ruff, Rushing Chairman, cornering B. J. Andrews and
Shirley Snyder in the game room to talk over party
plans for spring rushing; of Janie Walko hurrying in
from an evening class just in time for meeting. The
memories receded, and Beth repinned the DZ lamp
over her heart—where there is always room for fond
memories of sisters and friends.

WILL ALWAYS BRING BACK; MEMORIES

HETA SMOKE DREAMS

OF FUN AT PARTIES, FOOTBALL GAMES, AND

DANCES WITH SISTERS OF KAPPA ALPHA THETA

There are parts of this school year of 1947 and
1948 that will come back to every Theta when she
sings the well-known Theta Smoke Dreams. We will
remember Annabelle Montgomery, vice-president of
Panhellenic Council, who was graduated with highest
honor in February. We will remember too, Flora
Diemert, our sophomore president of Cwens. The
Christmas dance We will never forget; the house was
decorated with mistletoe and holly, and we danced by
candlelight. In December we prided ourselves on hav-
ing five Thetas chosen fraternity sweethearts, and
throughout the year we had fun making new friends of

210

our transfers: Monie Buchter, Mary Balph and Ann
Daniels. We became better acquainted with the Theta
chapter at Tech this year too through joint parties
and meetings. We’ll remember Monday night dinners
at the house; our beautiful sloppy Theta jerseys that
we wore everywhere; a spring formal; and a sleepless
slumber party. We’ll remember too the grand pledge
classes and the fun we all had working together to
retain last year's ﬁrst place in a ﬂoat parade. We
won’t forget the seniors of 1948: Jacque Bowers and
her lovely singing Voice, and Jacque with no voice at
all after football games; Betty Shew and Mary Mad-

dox as respective parts of the horse “Hosenpheffer”
during rushing; Haddie Nixonfher lunches at the
Hunt Room, her modern dance, and her new hair
style; Sis Biers—her smooth clothes and Ted; Pat
Irons, our wonderful pledge mother; and our three
engaged seniors, Virginia Reese, Jane Forsyth, and
Mary Caroline Daum. The Theta national convention
this summer will be a Smoke Dream, too.

The ofﬁcers for the year were as follows: Presi-
dent, Jacqueline Bowers; Vice—President, Patricia
Irons; Secretaries, Mary Maddox and Betty Shew;
Treasurer, Mary Jane Cronemeyer.

Kappa says goodbye to nine seniors this year. We
will have a difficult job replacing Betsy Briant,
captain of our ship for the last two years. Every time
a Kappa sings “Two Shades of Blue”, Jeanne Richard-
son's wonderful choral leadership will be remembered
—we lose her this year to Princeton. One of the
happiest memories of 1947-48 was the surprise party
Pattie Gatter held for the Kappas to announce her
engagementwand we lose another. Without Emogene
Strong bustling around, 165 North Dithridge will seem
empty next year. We shall all miss Pat Eldridge and
the spirit that she gave to Kappa. Kappa meetings will
seem strange without the cheerful voice of Pattie
Gillespie reading roll call. Wedding bells in ’48 claimed
Marge Bethune, the girl with the smiling personality.
We have all come to rely on the grand ideas of Helen
Reis, our Panhellenic President. Kappa regrets that
Joanne Kelly, our pep girl, had such a short stay with
KKG. Yes, we’ll miss them all. These girls and all the
actives will always look back to the memories of

213

1947-48. Our Founder's Day Dinner at the College
Club opened the season for Kappa. With meetings, tea
dances, and house dinners Kappas gathered together
for fun and friendship. The sing team, Abby Clark,
Margie Mack, Jeanne Richardson, Pat Eldridge,
Mildred Egge, Betsy Briant, Joan Johnston, and
Marge Bethune, captured the golden cup for Kappa.
In true Yuletide spirit the Kappas danced to “White
Christmas” at their winter formal. KKG and SAE
gave a party for orphans to try to make their Christ-
mas as pleasant as their own. With the Spring Festival,
a pledge dance, and school activities guiding the year
to an end, there were thirty hearts beating under
shining golden keys and looking back to memories
they’ll never forget.

Theofﬁcers for the year were as follows: Pres-
ident, Betsy Briant; Vice—President, Joanne Kelly;
Secretary, Patricia Gillespie; Treasurer, Marjorie
Zulauf.

PHI MU

HI MU, LIKE EVERY

SORORITY ON CAMPUS, HAS ITS SOCIAL BUTTERFLIES, BIG WHEELS- AND PRETTY SCHO-
LARS, BUT PHI MU’S ALONE ARE JOINED UNDER THE ROSE AND WHITE

Local girl makes good . . . maybe Sara Gillingham
isn't a world—beater, but she’s the latest married. And
then we have the other sisters, all in there pitching.
Pardon me, “Peggy Ann” Baird is still holding out for
sheckels. Like everybody else Phi Mu has its wheels.
For instance, we have “Boots” Robbins, our friend
conﬁdent, and above all else, our dictator, who prac-
tically runs Buhl Planetarium. On the other hand is
meek, mild Jeanne Dorﬁeld whose favorite saying is
“Have you seen Ken?” Nancy Mechling and Lois
Hite can be seen any afternoon holding down a racy
bridge game in the Tuck Shop. Speaking of haunts,
the Gold Bar is still swooning over Mary Lou Fitz-
simmons’ tantalizing eyes. Peggy Evans rooms on the

eighth ﬂoor and is forever beating poor Frank David
over the head for an assignment. The strong breeze
just passing looked like B. J. Fitzsimmons happily off
to class. Have you ever had a coke date with Elaine
Caliguire and Ginny Fansler? Strange, they run on
schedule . . . every half hour and doubleups during
rush hours. But we have our intelligentsia also. Jeanne
Patterson’s quite the authority on the A.A.F., and
Lois Swaney becomes a quiz kid when the U. S. Navy
is mentioned. Betty Lou Cox can tell you anything
you’d like to know about the fraternity parties at
Thiel College. The black coffee kid,“I missed my first
class this morning, but it's only a three credit course,
and I’ve been there twice.”, is Toni Wilkinson. The

trio in the corner, Sally Clow, Sara Shaw, and Marion
Ford, must be on their favorite subject again, SAE.
How does Phyllis Fields know so much about Med
School? Eavesdropping is my most delightful pastime:
“Twig" Stickle and Charlotte Clawson exchanging
chatter about fraternity men; Meg Gordon going on
about her two-point average; Mary Batz exclaiming,
“I wish I knew his name!” No, you’re not seeing
double, that’s Virginia and Elizabeth Cooper. Shirley
Von Behren to Russ: “No, dear, I’m not angry, not a
bit.” And there is Phi Mu en mass.

retary, Sara Gillingham ; Treasurer, Peggy Ann Baird.

E SMILE ON THE

SPHINX’S FACE IS FOR THE GALS OF PHI SIGMA SIGMA WHO PARLEYED THE NEW HOUSE AND

THE NEW LOOK INTO A JOB WELL DONE.

The “New Look" and a new house are synonomous
to Phi Sigma Sigma. And the smile on the Sphinx’s
face is the greeting to all who have visited or will visit
the chapter house at 4817 Centre Avenue. The girls
too have capitalized on the new look. Chief authority
on the latest vogues was Audrey Langdon, our student
careerist. Head members of the “smart for college”
group were Zelda Kernis, Lois Sidler, Naomi Gross,
Doris Sakulsky, and Barbara Finegold. Associate
members were Sylvia Peresman, Thelma Kaminsky,
Evie Wolk, and Rita Shonberg. Shirley Bloom, chair-
man of the Junior Prom, carried out the fashion idea
and named the dance “The Ballerina Whirl". Even

216

the newest members caught the fever. Renee Soltz
featured the short bob, and Betty Gitelman staunchly
supported the return of the George Washington hair-
do. The extra newness for Diana Bernstein and Lois
Wanetick was an engagement ringwand frat pins for
Joyce Levinson, Dotty Pearlstone, and Norma Rubin.
On the subject of pins, Miriam Seiner added a gavel as
president of the Senior Class. She also was chairman
of the Heart Hop. Her activities colleague, Cecile
Bruder, tacked the title of Vice—President of WSGA to
her list of accomplishments. In other women’s activities
were Panhel representatives Carol N unes and Jackie
Twig, secretary for the Greek gals’ organization, and

Betty Mae Swartz, ticket Chairman for the Frosh
Dance. The Fourth Estate claimed Harriet Miller
Steinberg as Pitt News Comptroller and Shirley
Glaser as Feature Editor and Pitt News Guild Advisor.
Ruby Feldman and Sandy Shine helped on the busi-
ness staff, and R02 Harris, Jackie Blitz, and Miriam
Canter worked on the news. And ﬁnally, the gals with
the biggest assignments were Archon Shirley Ringel-
heim and Rushing Chairman Audrey Golomb.

The ofﬁcers for the year were as follows: Pres-
ident, Shirley Ringelheim; Vice-President, Diana
Bernstein; Secretary, Zelda Kernis; Treasurer, Harriet
Steinberg.

VARSITY AND DEAR OLD THETA PHI.

218

Now that the time had come to graduate, it sud-
denly dawns upon me what the last year has really
meant. Memories that had slipped back into a corner
of my mind come to the front again. It seems an aw-
fully long time since I was a “greenie” lost and be-
wildered in a maze of halls and elevator shafts. This
fall we returned to school as Seniors-Marge and
Gloria as Senior Mentorseand all that had been new
and strange four years ago was now dear and familiar
to us. Our dreams of crossing a shining dance ﬂoor at
our winter formal were interrupted by the customary
semester exams. Ann ended her dramatic career as a
student when she graduated at mid-term. Margie D.,
sorority treasurer, was wailing, “But accounting and
ﬁnance are my lowest ebb,” and Marie Adele com-
plained, “Mother just doesn’t understand why I must
use her best saucepans for my specimens in zoology."
Cass, known as Madam President, can exercise an in-
ﬂuence of good humor that is practically incalculable.
Then there’s Mac, whose red hair matches her person-

ality in producing a bright ray of sunshine. Climaxing
Spring Rushing was our pledge dance. Corky was on
the job again as “Chief cook and bottle washer” and
saw to it that we were royally entertained, which
proves that blue jeans and Pitt Players aren’t her only
interests. Peg, the vigorousSociology major, has always
busied herself inquiring into our family backgrounds to
get data for her family problems classes. The girl who's
known as Lou was chosen “Lady of the Evening” at a
Lady Be Fit program in the interest of better posture.
Our last affair was the Panhellenic Ball where ‘we
joined with all the other sororities on campus for the
grand sorority ﬁnale. Commencement closed the term
and our senior year was over. It passed so quickly, but
it was great fun.

The officers for the year were as follows: Presi-
dent, Katherine Boyle; Vice—president, Ann Monte-

OUR MEMORIES ROLL BACK THE YEARS.

Yes, we see that in 1947-48 Chi Chapter of Zeta
Tau Alpha had a very successful year. The ﬁrst great
thrill came at the 49th Founders’ Day Banquet when
Miss Helen Donaldson, a charter member, dedicated a
chapter room in the sorority house in honor of her
mother. That was the year that Sally Grotefend did a
bang up job as president, and Nancy Drollinger really
banged up the pledges as pledge mistress. Can’t you
just hear Marge Sopher saying, “Get your dues in or
we can't have that dance”? Activities woman Brum-
baugh managed to make it to class between meetings
and Mary Jane Dunsmoor spent the summer in New
York as president of the “Y". She’s engaged, she's

Lawson. Oh ! and Hey.'—Hey??—Hay.'I Remember the
hayride at Doc Beaber's? I think that was the night
that June Rigdon and Jeanne Gilﬁllan sang the parody
to “A Discrete Zeta.” R. S. V. P. to Mae Flemming
for the Fall Rushing Tea—resu1t—we pinned the car-
penter’s square on Dottie Dwulit, Hanna Macllwrath,
Florence Eisenbeis, Eileen Silman, and Eleanor Stout.

from History II to the Post Gazette Office, and Ruth
Stiff who wore a Phi Gam pin? Remember the Zetas in
White, Sue Erdman, Ginny Divid, and Gloria Squires,
who traipsed the halls of Magee Hospital? The Zeta

Christmas Formal at the University Club would not
have been a success without our social chairman, B. J.
Knox. Remember the time Pitt Players produced
“George VVashington Slept Here” and Rita McDonald
worked behind scenes? Remember June Foss and Dorie
Evans and their limousines? Do you remember the
shy, demure freshman who turned out to be the life of
the senior partyeyou knoweMarg Harvey? AND

HE GALS OF ALPHA

KAPPA ALPHA COMPLETE AN ACTIVE YEAR IN WHICH FRIVOLITY AND FRIENDSHIP MINGLED
WITH THE MORE SERIOUS ASPECTS OF EDUCATION.

Hello there—I promised you a sketch of AKA‘s
activities this past year, so here goes. Starting the
school year with a bang, Iota Chapter celebrated
Home-Coming at its traditional Autumn Nocturne.
Social Chairman “Ollie” Hyatt really knows how to
plan a good time! She hit the jackpot again with our
annual Skate and Dance Party just before Thanks-
giving. I still remember “Von" Jackson’s gracefulness
in the Skater’s Circle Waltz. November also brought
rushing which kept Chairman “Geri” Jones busy, not
to forget “Byrdie” Robinson or “Libby” King, Dean
of Pledges. Those gals really made the pledges step
lively! After that whirl we initiated three new sorors,
Sue Logan, Jeanie Farrish, and Zerbie Dorsey. Now
they're having fun being authoritative Big Sisters.
When Christmas Day rolled around, the sorority
tramped out to the Children's Hospital early in the
morning for our yearly Caroling. It seems we never
sounded better in spite of sore throats and colds. We
hob—knobbed with a celebrity in January when

222

famous AKA soror Marion Anderson gave a concert
in Pittsburgh. Believe it or not, the reception com-
mittee was headed by a Marion Anderson, our sandy-
haired program chairman. February was a busy
month, too. After relaxing from exams at the Big and
Little Sisters Party, we rolled up our sleeves and
worked on our local project, the annual shower for the
Davis Home for Children. In the spring we swung into
our Health Week program as part of the sorority’s
National Health Project. After we celebrated the
closing of school with one ﬁnal burst of frivolity, Jackie
Ford signed the minutes for the last time. Prexy
Helen Lee, with her usual composure and dignity,
wound up all old business. Through all the stress and
strain Mary Jane Mitchell had kept her pleasant
disposition, and Lila Terry, her Mona Lisa Smile. That
accounts for Iota until this time next year.

The ofﬁcers for the year were as follows: President,
Helen Lee; Vice-President, Olivia King; Secretary,
Jacqueline Ford; Treasurer,Yvonne Jackson.

HOUGH OFTEN OFF

CAMPUS AND STILL THE BABY OF THE LOT, ALPHA TAU DELTA TAKES ITS PLACE PROUDLY

AMONG PITT’S PROFESSIONAL SORORITIES.

V\/'hat pin is that? Don't you know? Why it's
ATD, a nursing sorority. Come meet our group.
We welcome into our conﬁnes
Nurses who strike diﬁerent notes,

Fcr they come to us from varied ﬁelds
And on them we pin our hopes.

One group is made of G. I. gals

Back from service in the war,

To take up further studies here

Eager for what's in store.

Then there are still other R. N. ’s
Working for their degree,

Going to school and nursing too

With seldom an evening free.

And we mustn't forget those basic students
In stiﬁly starched white and blue,

Who spent two years in pre-nursing school

And three in the med center too.

We have our fun in many ways

A barn dance pledge party this year,

And with the initiation dinner past

The annual spring formal draws near.
Though we frolic a lot, we're serious too
There's a project in which we share,

Tin sure you've heard of the new nurse's home
We're planning our own room there.

Though we're away from the campus much of the time
Yet the cathedral standing so tall,

Ooerlooks the hospitals clustered about

And we're each a part of it all.

Ofﬁcers for the year were as follows: President,
Marion Schmidt; Vice—President, Katherine Fletcher;
Secretary, Naomi Linsenmeyer; Treasurer, Lillian

IF COUNCIL CORDINATES ACTION IN A YEAR OF INTERFRATERNAL PROGRESS

N’J‘ER1<‘RA’J‘ERN1TY CoUNc1L, composed of repre-

sentatives from every fraternity on campus, has

again ended a year as governing body of fraternity

activities. The Council stressed the keynote of

cooperation which resulted in close alliance
throughout the year with the Panhellenic Council and
Student Congress.

()n the IF calendar were two informal dances,
two formal dances, a Pledge Smoker, at which Fergie
spoke “totally unpreparet ” and got a higher Hooper
rating than most comedians, a year round inter-frater-
nity sports program, and an IF sing where the Phi
Gam “Smoke Dreams" was replaced by the winning
Phi Delt’s rendition of “Dry Bones.” The formation of
a Stray Greek organization was one of the outstanding
features of the year. This group was made up of
fraternity men whose frats were not represented on
Pitt’s campus. By the close of the year these Greeks
were participating fully in IF social affairs.

The interfraternity Council closed the year with
a report to the National IF Conference Session which
reﬂected a spirit of goodwill and cooperation which
will keep interfraternalism growing in the future.

PAUSES AT THE END OF ANOTHER SCHOOL YEAR TO MUSE OVER THE EVEN TFUL PAST AND LAY

BIGGER PLANS FOR DAYS TO COME.

Pitt Delts have come a long way since Gamma
Sigma chapter received its charter in 1914. For thirty
years the Delts have been growing with the Univer-
sity. The Delts were abroad on campus before the
Cathedral rose as a living monument to collegiate edu-
cation, before “Jock” Sutherland’s teams scourged the
nation's gridirons, and before Pitt welcomed the un-
precedented hosts of post-war students. The Delts
have grown with Pitt, and the Delts anticipate a bright
future for their school and their fraternity. For there’s
a lot to this fraternity business, Delt style. The Shelter
at 4712 Bayard Street offers a second home, a popular

228

Delt game room, and a loud-speaker system which
sends music throughout the ﬁrst ﬂoor and basement
for both out-of-town Delts and their Pittsburgh broth—
ers. On November 23, 1947 the Delts alums and actives
honored the memories of brothers killed in World War
II with the dedication of a memorial mantel and bronze
plaque at the Shelter. The same spirit which motivated
the dedication takes the Delts on a December Sunday

— evening each year to Trinity Cathedral for a special

Delt service sponsored by the chapters from Pitt, Tech,
and W. & J. The Christmas Dinner Dance at South
Hills Country Club, the more boisterous Bowery

Brawl, the Spring Formal, and the Gold Bar sessions
highlight the social calendar. In sports the Delts are
always listed in the first division, not always on top,
but always playing the game, and adding a few tro-
phies each year to the Delt collection. The Delts have
grown stronger and more mature over the years4
they’ve survived two wars that have depleted frater-
nity ranks. They’re proud of their school and their
frat, and they are working for the best future for both.
The officers for the year were as follows: Presi-
dent, William Riddle; Vice—President, John Moran;
Secretary, James Huber; Treasurer, James Pullen.

THE BROTHERS OF IOTA CHAPTER THE RAMBLING HOUSE ON DITHRIDGE STREET WILL
EVER REMIND THEM’ OF UNDERGRAD DAYS

Here come some of the brothers now. George
Lynn’s back from presiding over another Student
Congress meeting. From where I sit on the porch of
good-ole 225 I can hear Blair Douglas, Jack Grifﬁn,
and house-manager Jim Wagner discussing the pit-
falls of their last engineering lab. Bill Hagelin’s at the
piano working out a Swedish version of “Bongo-
Bongo,” and “Pinball Machine” Hartman is hunting
for nickels again. No, Manon’s not up at the G.B.
with Bud Smith, he's digging holes in a dental plate
downtown. Bob Gregsby hasn’t been seen since he
went to see Bemis at Trees Gym. Behind that pipe
smoke you'll find Ted Harrington and Rudy Schreiber
arguing about pipe—cleaners and Briar Root. Tom

Wheel hasn’t been around since that last “Oakland
Water-Wings Association” blowout; he’s probably
lost on the buFfalo reserve in South Park. “Chub”
Albright has deﬁed Horace Greeley and gone east to
Greensburg for the weekend. Bob Drummond is pro-
rating the national debt among the brothers “just to
get even”, but Bill Fiand and Dick Doon aren’t
interested. Bill James is trying to sell Walt Trough a
wicked looking blade guaranteed to get him through
cat anatomy. Don Kuntz is trying to get three bells
on the Coke machine while Jack Lersch is taking side
bets with Grogan that he’ll never do it. Harry Schaer’s
down at the “Y”; probably “out to lunch". Those
fumes you smell are from the basement where Jim

Secord is conjuring up another thermos of “Old

Thompson has sprouted feathers and hoots after dark
since he started to edit the Owl. Prexy Ray Funk is
still nursing the ﬁnger he whacked with the gavel.
Bob Nixon was last seen promoting a soap that “just
keeps you company in the tub.” Dave Dickenson
just purred up in his Oldsmobile; “Ho” Jarrett and
Roger Jorgenson are still talking about their respective

What makes the Wheel go round at 150 N. Dith-
ridge Street? Could it be that one of the "Cavaliers”
ﬁnally got himself a date? There’s Eddie “Dixieland”
Levine still driving the bridge ﬁends mad with his
“Muggsy” records. What's that awful tooting noise
coming from “Phage" Stein’s room on the second floor?
The “Phi Ep Pipes” just refuse to get rusty. D.
“Foren” Kamber and “Ramboli” Richards only went
down four tricks on that last three no contract. Look
at those sharpshooters swishing them through the hoop
out in the back yard! Let’s see—there's “three (not
two) point" Silverblatt, “Oh, she’s okay, I guess”
Pearlman, “Finesse" Pincus, and “Shrewdie” Seewald
looking like real pros. Somebody said that they saw
Vig Kavaler at the toy counter in Murphy’s again
yesterdayﬁprobably picking out something for a new
pig~tailed girl friend. Say, will somebody please wake
Phil Ransky before he misses all of his classes today?
Gee, Pitt's and Phi Ep’s biggest ASS (that’s Alpha
Sigma Sigma) just dropped in to say hello. He’s none

other than Paul “Dr. Pray" Steinlauf. My, what
pretty pictures “Fly” Fineberg plasters all over his
walls! No wonder poor Herby Marjolis isn’t getting
enough sleep lately. What's this—here comes Dave
“Walter Pidgeon" Hirsch all decked out in his shirt,
tie, and matching bathrobe about to settle down for
the evening with his pipe, slippers, and “Lil Abner”.
Looks like we don’t have any detailed reports to the
chapter todayé-Lee Block isn’t around. We better
help pick Bud Schulberg off the kitchen floor and put
him to bed. “Itchie” Sandson just never gets tired of
those “Carousel” records. You’d better put that clean
towel back, boy, before Herb “Sunshine” Maneloveg
ﬁnds out about it. We better shove off now, buddy;
here comes “Muff” Sheinberg looking for a new angle.

Hello! You're the first of the rushees to arrive
for the smoker tonight. Cigarette? This is the first
time you’ve been to the house, isn’t it? I don’t suppose
you know many of the actives so I’ll give you a run-
ning account. There goes Jack Armstrong; everybody
kids him about “Wheaties.” Over there is Bill Bean,
the one playing the Phi Gam songs on the phonograph.
He did a good job shaping up our sing team. With
him is Bill Coulter; keeps telling us we bachelors have
a rough life. There's the inevitable bridge game going
on. Al Motter, the one dealing, never fails to get one
started. Ed Garrett always uses a slide rule to keep
score. His partner here is Ed Quick. Whatcha say?

234

Any relation? Yeah, but even he had trouble register-
ing. The “fourth” is John Lango, the Hawkshaw of the
Blue Tuck Shop. Would ya like to play some ping
pong? It’s' this way to the game room. Over there’s
the phone booth ; and as usual Harry Wilson waiting for
Ruthie to call, and Don Wingerd expecting a call
from Kuwewanik. Oh, somebody’s beat us to the table.
The one with the strong left arm is Ira “don’t get over-
conﬁdent” Marshall. At the receiving end is Hal
Sellers, broken rib and all. Coming out of the coal
cellar is our hard—hearted treasurer, Russ Klob. Prob-
ably counting the lumps of coal. Care for another
cigarette? Courtesy of Rog Davidheiser’s cigarette

machine. The fellow who just dropped the ﬁfteen ball
in the corner pocket is Bob Calvin. ’Course he had lots
of moral support from George Hoffman and Big Bob
Hayhurst, “Mike’s Boy”. VVho’s making all the noise
at the piano? Just as I thought. Fran Marley, Scotty
Martin, and Sam Verner “harmonizing." No wonder
they weren't on the sing team. Look out! There goes
Bob Cornell rushing to take Marsha to town. Oh,
and come on over and meet John McMorris, our
president. He’ll tell you about the rest of the fellows,
and I'll see you later.

Phi Kappa started its year in a big way. Sep-
tember found brothers from all over the country meet-
ing in Pittsburgh for the National Interim Meeting.
As hosts, Pitt Chapter had its hands full preparing
and executing the meetings and festivities for the
three day session. National ofﬁcers and chapter repre-
sentatives hashed out problems and difﬁculties as well
as passing beneﬁcial resolutions that made the Interim
Meeting an interesting affair.

Highlighting the social session, the Winter For-
mal was held January 30 at the Jacktown Hotel with
music by Clyde Knight and his orchestra. Throughout
the year, numerous tea and dessert dances at the
house and at various sorority houses helped to brighten
the long school weeks. House dances and parties made
the weekends something to look forward to. To ﬁll
in a well rounded program of activities, Phi Kappa
reactivated its Mother’s Club, made the weekend
retreat an annual affair, sponsored a series of open

237

houses, participated in monthly Communion break-
fasts, decorated the house with large banners, posters,
and masques for each of the home football games,
and participated wholeheartedly in school affairs.

With the close of the year, Phi Kappa completed
its ﬁrst year in the new house at 152 N. Dithridge
Street. Entirely redecorated inside and out, the house
is a welcome abode for meetings, meals, and sack-
time. The eighteen house men, with Mrs. Mac as
housemother and Jack Henkle as house manager, ﬁnd
the house a perfect home-away-from-home. All of the
present ﬁfty actives take full advantage of its con-
Venient location by dropping in daily to participate in
bridge games, pingpong, or bull sessions.

The ofﬁcers for the year were as follows: Presi-
dent, Raymond Killeen; Vice—President, George
Schumacher; Secretary, Edward Rawlings; Treasurer,
Gerard Obert.

“Why, Hello Ralph. Say, come with me into the
Tuck Shoppe, and I'll introduce you to some of the
PiKA’s. It’s nearly noon and most of them will be
stopping by for a short while. Here, let’s sit down next
to George Hawker, the social chairman. He’s quite a
popular guy around here, being sort of a Daniel Web-
ster with a Henry Morgan script. The fellows sipping
coffee there are our two newspapermen, Bill Veenis,
the Editor, and Harry Keck, the Managing Editor.

Mild, with his cabinet, Knobby Dobrowolski, Len
Matonak, and Chuck Hurley. Those three “Men of

Dickey, Bill Schoﬁeld, and Joe Muller. Joe, the Ath-

PiKA’s champion interfraternity teams in basketball,
football, swimming, bridge, softball, and sweepstakes.
All the boys worked hard and certainly- deserved win-

In Pi Lambda Phi we try to keep alive a spirit of
friendship. It is easy to predict now that we will in
years to come look back on these days with consider-
able nostalgia. We will remember Herb Franklin, the
great paciﬁer; the “organization” composed of third
ﬂoor men who battled for progressive principles against
“Tiny” Frank and the traditionalists; Jock Siegel
pacing nervously along the side lines as our football
team battled for a victory that was sometimes forth-
coming and sometimes not; Dave Laufe and Floyd
Berky battling over seniority; Berky’s speech nominat-
ing Laufe for pledgemaster—“He uses big words";
Jack Schwartz calling, “House Manager! The hot
water doesn't work”; Dave Goodman cutting in on
someone’s date; Marty Lubovsky pushing his “Car”
when he wasn’t promoting culture and progress; Vic
Schwartz waiting up until all hours of the morning to
deliberately catch a mistake on some disk jockey’s

program, then spending as much on a rush telegram
to win two tickets to a local movie house as it would
have cost him to buy the tickets; Bill Katz who always
has some “Terriﬁc deal" on the ﬁre; Hershel Solomon
who has jokingly been accused of being “insincere";
Frank Rubin “making oot” in the blue room; Mark
Levant running his ﬁnger along your lapel as he stresses
some long since forgotten point; “Smiley” Samar Ro-
senson, the man who laughs only when it is politically
expedient to do so; Mel Fiedler who “has the spirit”;
Bob Silberstein and that pork pie hat which has now
gone the way of all good hats. And the others too.

hood of Pi Lambda Phi.

LON’S LIONS, BOTH SOCIAL AND STONE, RECALL A BIG YEAR IN WHICH STUDIES AND ATH-

LETICS PLAY STRONG SUPPORTING ROLES.

Even the lions at the SAE house have that new
look. In their fresh coat of blue paint they sit solidly
in front of a redecorated and refurnished frat house
that exempliﬁes the progress made since the war.

SAE’s spirits rose to great heights, that is, to the
top of the porch roof where we had some of the best
decorations on campus for the Ohio State game. The
day was climaxed with our return with the goal posts
from Pitt's only win of the season.

Our athletic teams have started to regain some of
the glory of past years, winning the IF bowling tour-
nament last year and with good chances of repeating
again this year. This year’s football picture was an im-

242

provement, thanks to Dick Johns and Pete Homich
who are the hustlers in football, ping-pong, basketball,
and bowling.

Socially the chapter has always been on the ball.
Who else had a winter formal centered around the
Louis—Walcott ﬁght? Rushing dances were more than
just the run of the mill kind, thanks to Howard Davies,
social chairman, as were our informal tea dances. At
Christmas SAE joined with the Kappa’s in throwing

7 a party for orphan children, reviving an old local tra-

dition. Bob Richardson, Bob White, Frank Davis, and
Jay Baily are among the latest of the brothers who
have jumped to the upper $90 a month bracket. To

call a few people some names, let's not overlook Jack
Barto, president, and Jack Mannsmann, who is always
appearing with Barto, social chairman of IF; Lanny
Govic, newly tapped into ODK; Jim Sweeney, book-
ing for the East Liberty syndicate; Jack Culley and
Jack Marshall who are alternately drilling through
miles of concrete as they struggle to ﬁx up the base-
ment to include a coke bar, ping pong room, and a
pool room. So life goes on at 244 North Belleﬁeld

OOKING BACK OVER

ITS PROGRESS FROM THE SCANT BEGINNINGS OF REACTIVATION IN 1945, ALPHA PHI DELTA
IS PROUD OF THE PRESENT, HOPEFUL FOR THE FUTURE.

I walked up to a table in the Commons Room
yesterday afternoon and noticed two of my frat broth-
ers arguing heatedly between spasms of highly concen-
trated attention on some papers before them. “Ah," I
mused, “it’s fellows like these that keep our frat high
in academic points.” Upon closer observation, how-
ever, I noticed it was just Bertoni and Salvetti work-
ing out a football pool—each arguing with that “I’m
not always right, but I’m never wrong" tone. Speaking
of athletics, Alpha Phi Delta is far from limited to the
above mentioned type of athletic interest. I'm proud
of the fact that I can say our boys have taken part in
every IF sports event. Our small counterpart of the
Touchdown Twins, Cavancate and Ianni, really give
the opposing teams plenty to worry about, and try to
ﬁnd a more consistently good bowler than “Dad"
Tomasino. At the time of the IF sing, the only thing
you had to do to hear lusty imitations of anything
from Caruso to Como was to bring up the subject

251

while John, Floyd, and Mike were around. But, be-
lieve me, they were good. Even though Johnny, the
prez, that is, was kept in a dither by Butch about fu-
ture wedding plans, he still found time to carry sixteen
credits. Hats off and congrats, John! Although Joe and
Don are married men now, they are still active and
ardent members, plus being swell officers. There is a
new name out for one of the brothers, it's “The Count,”
not Monte Cristo or Gasie, but “Me-Out." I can’t
understand him, he’s not even around when every-
thing is free. Getting back to those pools, have you
any suggestions for a winning ten-teamer? I’ve got to
catch up on my dues somehow, or Ralph Yannuzzi,
our high pressure treasurer, will be giving me night-
mares soon.

EET THE LAMBDA

CHI’S. THERE AREN’T TOO MANY OF THEM, BUT THEY ARE A LOYAL, CLOSELY KNIT CROWD

WHO WILL GET TO THE TOP TOGETHER.

In 1927 the Lambda Chi’s made their ﬁrst appear-
ance at the University of Pittsburgh. It was the ﬁfty-
ﬁrst chapter of Lambda Chi Alpha. Since then, the
fraternity has grown until now it has one hundred and
twenty-three chapters. But why should I talk about
the Lambda Chi’s? Come on down to the Tuck Shop
and meet a few of them. There aren't many of them
right now, but they’re an “on-the-ball” crowd. The big
fellow there is Elmer Metz, and the serious looking
one with him is Pete Guardino. Pete was the presi-
dent when the frat reactivated less than a year ago.
Here comes “Slim” Sam Simpson—he holds the purse
strings of Lambda Chi. The tall, good-looking boy
with him is Jack Magee. The quiet fellow? Oh, that's
Dick Elicker. He’s always quiet—he’s married. The
Lambda Chi’s had their troubles when they ﬁrst re-

252

activated, but fellows like the ones I’ve mentioned and
like our present president, Chuck DeMoske, are ﬁne
trouble—shooters. Due to the efforts of men like them,
Lambda Chi is taking a prominent place in campus
activities. Watch it! Here comes Marion Kranc. He’s
the joker. He'll probably give Bob Rossel a hot foot or
put salt in Mike Girman’s coffee. They’re a jovial
bunch and they like a good time, but when the occasion
calls for it, they can settle down and do some ﬁne
work. It’s too bad John Steel isn't here. You should see
himéthe most bewildered secretary in captivity.
Well, I’ll have to go now, but if you’re going to be at
Pitt, you’ll see the Lambda Chi’s around.

The ofﬁcers for the year were as follows: Pres-
ident, Charles DeMoske; Secretary, Jack Steel; Treas-
urer, Sam Simpson.

learned the stimulus of keen athletic com-

with physical exertion. Watching varsity

that victory is not the only teacher.

MOST VALUABLE PLAYER AWARDS

In an effort to accord Pitt’s outstanding athletes
a measure of the recognition that comes to leaders in
other ﬁelds of campus activity, the Owl this year
inaugurates a new feature, the Most Valuable Player

Awards.

The deserving men whose pictures appear on this
page have been elected to the honor by their team-
mates in a secret, mailed—in ballot conducted by the

Sports staff of the Owl.

Unfortunately, our deadlines have made it im-
possible to include any sport which has its season
after March, but we hope these others will be included

in future issues.

football season was the unusual and totally unexpected
spirit shown by the Pitt students. Through a greater
part of the home games and even two of the away
contests, the mystiﬁed rooters kept their pre-season
promises of complete loyalty.

The student cheering section, led by Ben Grady’s
able cheerleaders, produced shreiks of glee when the
Panthers would momentarily display their offensive
abilities, and smiled approvingly at the antics of their
ﬁnely clad Panther. The most sincere and most loudly
exclaimed feelings pronounced during those Saturday

direction of Robert Arthur the band's half time forma-
tions and music provided such a varied and colorful
program that they were acclaimed among the top
organizations in the nation. The return of a success-
fully operated demonstration block brought to an
official end the war time restrictions of conservation at
Pitt. The blue and gold capes once again added color
and atmosphere to the stadium’s gray walls. These
three factions, school spirit, the Marching Band,
and the demonstration block, were responsible for the
moral success of the campaign.

Ready for the big push.

Patterson of Illinois heads for open territory.

Mike Milligan's youthful Panthers opened their defensive season by surpris-
ing Illinois’ Rose Bowl Champions, holding them to an unimpressive 14-0
victory.

The Illini drove deep into Panther territory twice in the ﬁrst quarter, but
were stopped both times on fumbles by Paul Patterson on the 24 and Russ Steger
on the 8.

The eager Pitt line, sparked by an end zone interception by Jimmy Joe
Robinson, held ﬁrmly during the second and third quarters. Two minutes before
the end of the third period the Panther backﬁeld came to life for the ﬁrst time and
pushed the Illinois defense back to their own 37, but lost the ball on downs.

Dwight Eddelman initiated the afternoons’ scoring in the ﬁnal stanza,
catching a 25 yard pass from Perry Moss. Three plays later Eddelman ran Leo
Skladany’s punt 40 yards for the ﬁnal points.

Notre Dame’s Livingston is tackled after receiving punt.

The mighty Irish of Notre Dame, touted as the National Champions and
possibly the greatest team of all time, were outplayed the entire ﬁrst half before
ﬁnally overpowering the Panthers 40-6.

Midway in the ﬁrst period Terry Brennan scooted 12 yards around left end for
the initial score of the game. The Panthers came right back and gave the capacity
crowd a thrill when Tony DiMatteo ran Tony Oracko's kickoff 55 yards to the
Irish 30 before being pulled down by the Notre Dame safety man. A pass, Jack
Smodic to Bill McPeak, placed the ball on the 8. With third down and a foot to go
DiMatteo fumbled a low pass from center and Notre Dame recovered.

Pitt struck back in the second quarter when McPeak recovered Frank
Tripucka's fumble on the Irish 20. Carl DePasqua scored, plunging seven yards
through the center of the line. Notre Dame ended the ﬁrst half scoring with a
Johnny Lujack to Doug Waybright pass.

The second half looked as though it would be a repetition of the ﬁrst, but
after an exchange of punts the Irish, with Emil Sitko and Lujack spearheading the
attack, marched from their 20 to the Pitt 85. Lujack ﬁred a pass to Martin for the
tally. This set off a spark as Notre Dame’s reserve backs, Coy McGee and Lan
Smith, took advantage of a fumble by Paul Rickards and an intercepted Bobby
Lee pass to score the last Irish touchdowns.

Look out below!

For the third straight week, the Panthers marched on the gridiron against a
far superior foe. The Pitt men held Michigan scoreless through an evenly fought
ﬁrst quarter, but Fritz Crisler’s VVolverines went on to give Pitt the worst beating
of its football history. ‘

The Michigan eleven started its scoring spree in the second quarter, Bob
Chappius passing to Bob Mann for a 71 yard touchdown play. A little later
Michigan came 55 yards to score as lack Weisenburger plunged over from the 3.
The third tally resulted when Bump Elliot intercepted Carl DePasqua's wobbly
pass and dashed 36 yards for a touchdown.

The third quarter was barely underway when Gene Derricotte took Bill
Hardisty's punt and ran 78 yards for the score. The ﬁfth T. D. was a result of a
53 yard march culminated by a pass, Weisenburger to Mann. Walt Teninga
accounted for the last score of the period, driving off tackle from the Pitt 2.

The Wolverines were off again in the fourth quarter with Teninga snatching
an aerial from Bill Peterson to rack up another tally. A drive of 48 yards ended in
the scoring lanes. Again Peterson spelled “ﬁnis"~ to the afternoon's scoring.

Sorry, this is as far as you go.

Despite their customary ﬁrst quarter stubbornness, the Panthers’ were un-
able to stave off a powerful Indiana team, bowing 41-6.

The Panthers opened the game as if determined to register an upset. Follow-
ing the kickoff, Jack Smodic passed into the waiting arms of Bill McPeak for a 41
yard gain to the Hoosier 47. Two plays failed to gain and on the third Tony
DiMatteo fumbled and Indiana recovered.

The second quarter was eight minutes old before the Hoosiers could break
into the scoring column. Dick Deranek tallied on a reverse from Chick Jagade, the
play covering 20 yards. After recovering a fumble by VValt Cummins, George
Taliaferro and Mel Groomes worked a screen pass from the Pitt 31 for a touchdown.
Before the half was completed, Indiana moved 90 yards to score again on a pass,
Taliaferro to Jagade.

The Hoosiers hit the scoring trail again in the third quarter when Lou
Mijalovich intercepted Carl DePasqua’s pass and raced the remaining 20 yards
for a touchdown. The Panthers then began a sustained drive of 90 yards. Lindy
Lauro charged through the-Indiana line for three ﬁrst downs and the ball rested on
the Pitt 42. A long pass, Lou Cecconi to McPeak, accounted for the tally.

Where oh where are our blockers?

In the fourth stanza, Taliaferro circled left end from the Pitt 1 to score
Indiana’s ﬁfth touchdown. A brilliant 60 yard run again by Taliaferro climaxed
the Hoosier's last scoring drive.

After eight years and twenty-four consecutive defeats at the hands of West-
ern Conference teams, the vengeful Panthers clawed their way to an upset 12-0
victory over Ohio State to break the jinx; the pre-game cry of “Mess Wes”
became a reality.

The Pitt men capitalized on four Buckeye fumbles and the trusty kicking of
Bill Hardisty to register their ﬁrst mark in the win column.

Neither team threatened seriously in the ﬁrst or the early part of the second
quarter with Pete Perini and Hardisty engaging in a battle of the toes. With only
a few minutes remaining in the half, Perini’s kick from his own 15 went out of
bounds on the Buckeye 29. From that point Pitt took to the air waves. A pass,
Paul Rickards to Carl DePasqua, netted 9 yards. Then DePasqua stepped back
and ﬂipped a short one to Walt Cummins for 2 yards, and Smodic moved the sticks
to the 5 on an aerial to DePasqua. Tony DiMatteo crashed through right guard for

the ﬁrst score of the game.

Early in the third quarter, the Bucks took over on their own 35 and marched
to the Panther 2. With fourth and goal to go, the hard—charging Pitt line broke
through and set Alex Verdova down for a 3 yard loss.

In the ﬁnal period, Jimmy Joe Robinson took Perini’s punt on the Ohio State
34 and raced to the 30. Lindy Lauro passed to Bill McPeak for eight yards and
Lou Cecconi slipped through tackle to the 15. DePasqua passed to Cecconi for 7
more, yards and DiMatteo carried for another ﬁrst down on the 5. Three line
attempts failed, but DePasqua aerialed to Cecconi on the goal line who stepped
over for the second touchdown.

The action during the regulation 60 minutes of play was completely over-
shadowed by the celebrations, planned and unplanned, engineered by the victory-
starved Panther rooters. Carnegie Tech, Duquesne, and even P. C. VV. felt the
brunt of the victory celebration as emancipated Pitt students took a day off to
make merry.

This play netted nine yards.

For three grueling quarters, the Panthers held the Gophers to a lone touch-
down before the weight and depth of Minnesota transformed an otherwise tight

, ball game into Pitt's ﬁfth notch in the negative side of the win-and-loss column.

The Gopher's ﬁrst touchdown came in the initial quarter. Bill Hardisty,
booting hurriedly from his own 25, angled his kick and the ball went out of bounds
on the Pitt 42. On eight plays Minnesota hit pay dirt, Bill Elliot, going over from
the 1 foot line.

An eventless third quarter proved to be the calm before the storm as Minne-
sota’s 210-pound line cleared the way for their second T. D., Marv Hein scoring.

Another Gopher drive was stopped on the Pitt 4, but the Jungle Cats gave up
two more points when Paul Rickards, back to pass, was tackled in the end zone.
Hardisty punted out from the 20 to Everrett Faunce who ran back to the Pitt 37.
Ralph McAllister, on three plays, sped the remaining distance for another touch-
down.

In the Closing minutes of the game, the Gophers took the ball on the Pitt 23.
Three plays later, Frank Brown scored from the 15.

It was the same cast that had played in last year’s thrilling 10-8 game, but
the script was different as the Purdue men trampled reserveless and demoralized
Panthers 28-O.

Purdue drew ﬁrst blood in the second quarter when Clyde Grimensteine
intercepted Paul Rickard's pass on the Panther 43 and galloped down the side-
lines into the Pitt end zone.

In the second half, the Boilermakers scored in six plays from their own 10,
Bob DeMoss going over on a quarterback sneak. In the ﬁnal minutes of the period,
Jim Gorgal intercepted a Jack Smodic pass on the Pitt 43 and weaved his way
back to 3. Stormy Phohl shot through tackle for the score. ‘

The ﬁnal Purdue tally was set up by Bill Canﬁeld who lugged Hardisty's 45
yard punt from his own 39 to the Panther 32. Two plays following, Bob Hartman
riﬂed a pass into the end zone. Carl DePasqua deﬂected the ball, but Canﬁeld
made a great circus catch for the score.

The $64 question — VVhere’s the ball?

Penn State roared into Pittsburgh for their season ﬁnale determined to
break the “stadium jinx”. This determination plus a powerful line and a galaxy of
ﬂeet-footed backs are ample explanation for the ﬁnal score, 29-0.

The Lions hit the scoring column after six minutes of the ﬁrst quarter. Start-
ing from their own 45, they moved steadily down ﬁeld, concentrating on running
plays only. Joe Colone, on a double reverse, carried to the Pitt 44, and Jeff Durkota
picked up 12 yards around right end. Bobby Williams took over from there and in
three line plunges hauled the ball into pay dirt.

After several punt exchanges, the Staters began another march when Bill
Hardisty’s kick went out of bounds on the Pitt 29. Colone and Larry Joe sparked
the drive towards the Panther goal. Williams scored from the 5.

The Pitt rooters had a chance to cheer in the third quarter when Bill McPeak
intercepted Colone’s pass on the Penn State 25 and returned to the Pitt 49. Carl
DePasqua skirted left end for 4 yards, but two passes by DePasqua failed and
Hardisty was sent in to kick.

The ﬁnal three scoring plays were of unusual nature. Francis Rogel managed
to lateral to Elwood Petchel before being tackled and the latter sped 22 yards
into the end zone; Dennie Hoggard snagged the ball as it bounced off Bobby Lee's
chest and ran the remaining 25 yards for another score; and Ed Czekaj kicked a

ﬁeld goal from the Pitt 21.

Out to end a 19-year Pitt win streak, the Mountaineers helped the Panthers
close their 1947 suicide campaign by defeating the jinx 17-2.

West Virginia’s men scored their ﬁrst touchdown in the opening
quarter. A pass, Tom Keane to Frank Reno, advanced the ball to the Pitt 24.
Rex Baumgardner’s 21 yard run advanced the ball to the 3 where Keane on the
second play slipped over on a quarter back sneak.

Early in the second quarter, Gene Corum blocked Bill Hardisty’s punt and
recovered on the Panther 5. Three rushes provided a minus ﬁve yards, but Dick
Hoffman added three points kicking a ﬁeld goal at a difﬁcult angle from the Pitt
20.

The Mountaineers scored their ﬁnal points with only two minutes left in the
half. Chuck Schrader intercepted Lou Cecconi’s pass on the Pitt 30, and ran to the
25. Keane’s pass to Schrader was tapped by Jack Smodic into the arms of Fred
Morecraft for a touchdown.

Late in the fourth quarter a combination of Bobby Lee and Carl DePasqua
passes carried 41 yards to the West Virginia 4, but the attack was stymied.
Keane's end zone punt was partially blocked and Gene Remenar fell on it for a
safety, accounting for Pitt's only points of the day.

Latagliata jumps high in Tech thriller.

Dr. H. C. Carlson began his twenty-sixth season
as basketball coach with four veteran ﬁrst stringers,
one newcomer and a few experienced replacements.
The unpredictable “Doc” led his mighty midgets
against some of the tallest and most offensive—minded
teams in the nation and turned in a very respectable
record. By stressing control of the ball the Panthers
managed to completely confuse a majority of their
opponents to such a degree that in many cases, the
game would be held up until the opposition could
regain its wits. Although this type of basketball proved
unpleasant to the action-craving fans, many of the

nations’ top authorities praised the Carlson method.

The Panthers quickly forgot their optimistic
coach's cry of Win 'Em All when they dropped the
first six games of the season, three to VVestern Con-
ference teams and three to opponents from the south.
The initial victory of the campaign was gained at
Loyola in New Orleans by a two point margin. This
was the beginning of a very welcome ﬁve game win
streak. Penn State, Carnegie Tech, Army, and
Bethany were the victims of this long awaited streak
with the 42-41 triumph over the VVest Pointers the
most impressive. The lce Cream Kids then traveled to

 

Cecconi ready to dribble down the floor.

ﬂicted a humiliating 74-56 defeat on the surprised
home quintet. Next step on the schedule was a trip
through the Ivy League where Cornell and Colgate
administered decisive defeats of 52-40 and 63-46
respectively. One week of rest followed the trip to the
east with the members of the varsity forgetting their
basketball strategies in favor of fall semester examina-
tions. They resumed their regular activities entirely
exonerated from their classroom woes and celebrated
by outscoring the Nittany Lions 42-34. This started a
four game victory streak which enabled the Pitt team

to pull their season won and lost record to an even .500
percentage. VVestminster was the ninth foe to fall
before the Carlsonites. The pleasures of a balanced
record were short lived as West Virginia’s Mountain-
eers teamed enormous height with unbelievable
shooting accuracy to defeat the local ﬁve 70-59. The
final games of the year were a repetition of the results
achieved in the previous engagements with VVest-
minster and VVest Virginia. The Titans were defeated
57-54, and the Mountaineers ended the Panther
schedule, winning their forty-third straight home
game 52-36.

TRACK AND CROSS COUNTRY

The fact that the 1947 track season was not a
booming success cannot be blamed on lack of material,
but rather on lack of usable facilities. The antiquated
track house behind Trees Gym was entirely outmoded
and as a result the track squad remained in submission
until the weather man raised the white ﬂag. Despite
this overwhelming handicap, the thinclads managed
to record a partially successful campaign.

Among the more outstanding track and ﬁeld men

Coach Olsen was able to develop were Herb Douglas in
the broad jump, Ed Sudzina in the two mile run and
Bill Parrish in javelin. Parrish and Sudzina were
especially successful in the Penn Relays, with the
former ﬁnishing fourth in the javelin, while galloping
Ed was coming in ﬁfth in the two mile. The two home
meets were divided as the Pitt squad outclassed Ohio
U. after bowing to a strong Penn State crew.

New York two of the Pitt representatives managed to

SWIMMING

Coach Ben Grady

For the first time in the present decade a Pitt
team went through a season undefeated. This long
forgotten honor befell Ben Grady’s hustling swim
squad. During the regular seasonis six meets the
tankers were able to mass 323 points while their
opponents were held to mere 129. Grady’s proteges
greatly outclassed all, save one, of its opponents. The
one was Fenn who managed to garner 31 points
against the Pitt squad’s 44.

The season opened at home against Allegheny.
In this match the Panthers showed promise of a
successful year by outswimming the team from Mead-
ville 45-21. The next and most threatening contest of
the season with Fenn was easily overcome. Then the
natators faced Slippery Rock, the only team that had
beaten them the year before. The Pitt men came out
on top 59-16. This score was duplicated in the succeed-
ing meet with Edinboro bowing before the superior
squad. VVith an unbeaten season in sight the tank
crew worked harder than ever in order to realize their
dream. They were rewarded with easy wins over Penn
State, 56-19 and Davis-Elkins, 59-16.

BASEBALL

Chalking up their best seasonal record since 1941,
the Pitt baseball team wound up the 1947 card with
ﬁve victories and three defeats. Originally scheduled
for twenty games, the Panthers had their season
curtailed so that the Pittsburgh Civic Light Opera
Company could use the stadium making it impossible
for the squad to play after May 6.

Coach Ralph V\'itterling

278

Spring rains hampered practices considerably, but
on opening day with California State Teachers, Ralph
Mitterling’s boys proved that they were on the up-
ward swing in collegiate baseball, by winning 13-8. The
Panthers then traveled to Salem where they defeated
the Salemites 9-5, with Dodo Canterna claiming
the batting honors with a homer, double and a single.
Moving back to the stadium, they made it three in a
row by setting down West Virginia, 7-5. Pitt’s three
game winning streak was snapped by Juniata when
the Indians throttled the Panthers 8-2. California
again proved easy prey as the Jungle Cats had a ﬁeld
day at the batting cage. The ﬁnal score, 9-1. The next
stadium attraction was halted by rain after ﬁve full
innings of play with the Pitt men leading Clarion
Teachers 5-3. The last two games of the year were
played at home against Penn State on successive days.
In the ﬁrst game the Lion strategy proved superior to
that of the home team as they emerged victors by a
7-1 score. The closing tilt was marred by errors and
shoddy pitching. The Staters took full advantage of
these mistakes to come out on top of a 7-2 score.

The hitting and pitching honors for the season
were taken by John VVasiecko and Deryl Calder.
\Vasiecko posted a .415 batting average, collecting ten
hits at twenty—four times at bat. Calder led the

‘pitchers with three wins and one loss, hurling three

complete contests.

JTENNIS

Coached by Dr. David O’Loughlin, the Pitt tennis
team handicapped by lack of suitable facilities and
inclement weather, failed to win a match in the 1947
season. In the opening match with Army, the Cadets
walked off the court victorious, despite the fact that
the Panthers took two of the three double’s games.
Bald-Harmuth and Clinton—Campbell were the win-
ning pairs. The next opponent, Ohio State, handed the
Pitt boys their second defeat with the doubles team of
Bald and Weil providing the only local points of the

_afternoon. In losing the last match of the season with

Penn State the Panthers won their first single match
besides taking their fourth doubles game of the year.
The outlook of the 1948 season cannot be brightened
because the same inadequate facilities will be used.
The only possible consolation will be the experience
gained during the past year.

The Pitt golf team was held to a winless season by
seven Eastern teams. Outstanding among the chippers
were Kunkle, Mohr and Martin who won seven, tied
two and lost ten contests. The most successful doubles
team was that of Martin and Mohr which won two of
its four matches. The Panther squad scored a total of
12 points with the opposition totalling 54 points. The
most embarrassing defeats of the season were the two
to West Virginia and the three to Penn State. The
more experienced Mountaineers and Lions took the
Pitt representatives with apparent ease, running up 37
points against 11. The most consoling factor of these
defeats was the comparative closeness of the second
Penn State match, in which there was only a three
point difference in scores.

RIFLE

Running true to form, the Pitt riﬂe team turned
in a highly successful record for the 1947-48 season.
For the last three years the Panthers have taken all
comers and given no quarter. This year, with all but
three meets scored, the riﬂemen can boast of better
than ninety per-cent victories over some of the tough-
est competition the nation can offer.

Doubly sweet to the boys behind the guns was the
fact that they have defeated all of the VVestern Con-

ference teams. In intersectional competition the Big
Nine represents the toughest opponents the Panthers
face and they fell before the accurate ﬁre of the Pitt
men.

match and the Second Army competition. If past
records are any criteria, the Blue and Gold can make
room in the trophy case for the prizes offered at these
meets.

year were Lieutenant Siegal and Sergeant Shablowski,

INTRAMURALS

 

The directors look over their schedules

Topped off by a thrilling football season the
Intramural program at Pitt reached a heretofore un-
touched height. The 1947 intramural plans included
football, basketball, bowling, Volleyball, ping pong
and softball.

The football race was the most exciting and most
observed in the history of intramurals at the Univer-
sity. Both the Locals and Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity
emerged undefeated in their respective leagues. The
first playoff resulted in a 6-6 tie. The following game,

played before close to a thousand spectators, was won
by PiKA 7-2. The Greeks then went on to defeat the
Carnegie Tech intramural champions in the second
annual inter-school playoff.

VVith the bruises acquired during the six man
football season barely healed the basketball campaign
swung into full operation. This too was a heated race
with the Educators of the Cosmopolitan League, the
most prominent squad. They consisted of members of
the Varsity football team and displayed their basket-

ball talents exceedingly well. Top team in the frater-
nity loop was the Phi Epsilon Pi Aggregation. The Phi
Eps came through the scheduled contests with only
one setback and then went on undefeated in the round
robin playoffs to be crowned champions of the frat
group.

In bowling the Locals and the PiKA’s repeated
as leaders in their own sections. The fraternity men
showed exceptional form in losing only seven matches
to the rest of the Greek pin men.

A nail in his shoe?

 

Director Leo Bemis hoped for equal success in the
results of the remaining two winter competitions of
volleyball and ping pong and also in the springtime
sport, softball. In contrast to the problems of the
Varsity sports, intramurals have been blessed with
adequate facilities for two of the three major com-
petitions, football and softball. The acquisition of
Ellsworth Center provided a supplement to the ﬁeld
atop Trees Gym thus enabling a well planned and well
carried out intra-faction program.

Hey! Something slipped by you.

fourteen of Pitt’s most charming coeds. They Were
selected by Pitt fraternity men as favorites of their
respective fraternities and formally presented at inter-

MISTLETOE BALL

RATERNITY MEN INITIATED the winter social season
Fwith their annual dance, the Mistletoe Ball. The
formal dance highlighted the Christmas season at the
University. Decorations of mistletoe, which was used
to good advantage by frat men, and holly carried out
the theme of the dance and provided an appropriate
beginning for the Christmas holidays. The orchestras of
Jimmy Dorsey, featuring Carol Scott, Bill Lawrence,
and the Sky-Larks, and Randy Brooks provided music
for the Ball. During the intermission the fourteen
lovely fraternity queens were crowned with roses by the
eager Jim Greaney and Jack Mansmann. With the
sweethearts of the frats standing before the bandstand,
the winning fraternity song team, Phi Delta Theta,
sang the same numbers which won them the title at the
Interfraternity sing. As a climax of the intermission
entertainment Jim Creaney presented Bob Mild,
president of Pi Kappa Alpha, with the All-Point
Trophy. Gardenias, favorites with all dance-minded
coeds, were given as favors.

STUDENT CONGRESS DANCES
All-CAMPUS AFFAIRS nrrmn GAY SOCIAL IJIVERSIIJNS

ACH YEAR STUDENT CONGRESS, in addition to keeping
Ethe wheels of the regular Pitt activities in smooth
working condition, sponsors a number of dances to
provide the school with a basic social program. The
dances, one of which this year was an afternoon non-
date affair, were planned to provide a form of social
activity in which all University students could take
part. The afternoon tea dance gave those students from
out of town and those who worked at nights a chance
to enter into the Pitt social life. Working through a
social committee made up of a speciﬁed number of its
members, Student Congress planned carefully dances
that would appeal to the varied tastes and interests of

the thousands of Pitt students. These dances enabled
students to meet their fellow classmen in an atmos-
phere other than the usual classroom type of acquaint-
ance. Three evening dances were sponsored by Student
Congress this year. Each of these affairs was managed
by members of various classes: the freshmen sponsored
the Crammers’ Caper; the sophomores, the Harvest
Moon Ball; and the juniors, the Ballerina Whirl. Al-
though these were called class dances, they were open
to any student of the University, and so the purpose of
the Student Congress, to foster friendship among all
University students, was fulﬁlled.

HARVEST MOON BALL

THE SOPH HOP, the ﬁrst all-school dance of the year,
successfully launched the year’s social program at
Pitt with resounding acclaim. Decorations featuring a
huge harvest moon and numerous bunches of golden
chrysanthemums carried out the fall harvest season
theme. Music for the affair was provided by Brad Hunt
in the Main Ballroom of the William Penn Hotel. The
intermission entertainment attracted the attention of
all who attended the dance. The featured singer was
Muriel Thompson, Pitt songstress. Rounding out the
intermission entertainment were the comedy antics of
Bob Riley and Howard Supowitz. Walt Armstead, Jack
Mansmann, and Don Wilde are to -be congratulated for
the case with which they managed the ﬁrst all-school
dance of the year.

excellent intermission features. Baron Elliot, whose
band furnished the music, led the orchestra in several
Very well-done novelties. The big name in the enter-
tainment was Jerry Terheyden, a young comedian who
did several pantomimes and parodies. His parodies on
ballad singers were particularly effective. Beverley
Snyder, the chairman of the dance as well as her
committees are to be congratulated for a successful
affair. The decorations in particular were among the
most original of the year.

BALLERINA WHIRL

ITT BALLERINAS AND THEIR ESCORTS ﬁlled the Main
Pand Urban Ballrooms of the William Penn on Feb-
ruary 27th. The occasion was the Ballerina Whirl
featuring Ted. Weems, ﬁrst name band at a school
affair this year, and Lee Kelton with their dance
organizations. Dance decorations, too, cleverly re-
ﬂected the new look. The highlights of the evening were
the very professional intermission features. The Weems
outﬁt, equipped with talented musicians, were very
effective. Elmo Tanner, the accomplished whistler,
Shirley Richards, a very effusive singer, and Billy
Blair, a clever imitator and song stylist, provided
stellar relaxation for the dancers. Shirley Bloom and
her committees did a competent job in providing a very
socially successful affair.

SPRING FEsTIvAL—a Week of holidays for all Pitt
students willing to put aside books and studies for a
few days of celebration. And what Pitt student isn’t!
Students from every school of the University join in
making the week one of fun and gaiety. Spring Festival
is a week of bright days, of colorful ﬂoat parades, of
outdoor luncheons, of sweepstakes, of open houses, of
carnivals, and of a crowning spring formal on the last
night of festivities. During Spring Festival week books
are tossed into dusty lockers and forgotten; term papers

been carefully hoarded throughout the semester are
taken freely. An important part of Spring Festival—
and one of a little more serious nature—is Tap Day. At
this time honorary fraternities tap to membership those
students who have fulﬁlled the organization’s require-
ments. At this time also the Senior Queen and Alma
Mater are named. Spring Festival is a week of holidays
for all Pitt students and instructors young enough in
heart to answer the ﬁrst call of spring.

MILITARY BALL DRAWS YEAR'S BIGGEST CROWD

HE MILITARY BALL regained its traditional pre-war
Tstanding this year as the season’s most elaborate
dance. Nationally famous Vaughn Monroe and his
orchestra, collaborated with Pittsburgher Bill LeRoy’s
band and “Sonny” Brenner’s six piece combo to take
over the entire seventeenth ﬂoor of the William Penn
hotel for the evening. The new ROTC uniforms were
mingled with tuxedos and service uniforms as Veterans,
non-Veterans and military personnel joined with the
cadets at intermission to watch the formal tapping
ceremonies of Scabbard and Blade, national honorary
military society. Name bands, three dance floors, re-
freshment lounges and professional decorations assured
a memorable evening for all.

CHRISTMAS WEEK

UNE OF THE LOVELIEST SEASONS at Pitt each year is the
Christmas season. During the week before Christmas
vacation, the Commons Room is the scene of many
traditional parties and informal songfests. Students
gather here between classes to listen to ﬁreside readings
and to sing with their classmates around an organ which
is seldom silent throughout the week. A Christmas
party, at which even Santa Claus Peterson appears,
climaxes the events of the week. Humorous, but
appropriate, gifts are given to all Pitt organizations,
and the students, laden with candy canes and popcorn
balls are sent off to a happy holiday at home.

FINEST IN THE LAND

I H E "THE NATION’s FINEST”, “pride of the University”, Pitt’s 120 piece marching band

this year basked in the glory of one of its most triumphant seasons. Between
halves at football games, both at home and away, its performances gladdened the
hearts of students and alumni and left little doubt in the minds of all spectators

that here was a band second to none. Under the guidance of Director Robert L.
Arthur and Drill Master Capt. Jim Hunter the members worked long and hard to
perfect their remarkable half-time displays. At the Notre Dame game the band,

forming a huge horseshoe centered with the numerals VL7, saluted Mike Milligan
and gave the season a rousing send-off. At the Ohio State game they presented their
tribute to the alumni by forming patterns depicting the phases of college life. Proud

Pittites claim that the band°s demonstrations were matchless.

Of equal importance was the reputation the 65 member Concert Band earned
for itself throughout the eastern part of the country this year as a result of its
annual concert tours. The Concert Band, carrying complete symphonic instru-

mentation, is made up of players from the Marching Band and others whose instru-
mental parts are not used in the Marching Band.

ITT HAD ITS OWN "V-Day” October 27 when the
PPanthers beat Ohio State in the upset of the year.
"V-Day” began Monday morning with Pittites snake
dancing through the cathedral and in classes where
bewildered profs watched their classes vanish. Soldiers
and Sailors Hall became the scene of the celebration.
After cheers and speakers, thousands of students
poured out of the rally more spirited than ever.

The band lead the trek through the streets of
Oakland, but the students yelled, "On to Tech”. Pitt
students in cars and on foot paraded on the Tech
campus heckling Techites. After attempts to storm
Maggie Morrison and buckets of water thrown down
on Pitt’s clan in retaliation, loyal celebrators picked up
the goal posts and were off again down Forbes Street.
When the parade returned to Skyscraper U. it really
looked like a Victory celebration!

For the lucky students with cars, the celebrating
had just begun. They Went to town, Duquesne and
P. C. W. spreading Pitt cheer. But for the majority on
foot, "V-Day” ended with a snack in the Tuck Shop
and a happy feeling that after all—Pitt did have spirit.

TT’s CALLED Neo-Angle. From the mo-
ment you step into it, you’ll agree that
it’s not only the most luxurious bath
you ever knew, but also the most prac-
tical. The Neo-Angle has lower sides for
safety. A broader, ﬂatter interior for
extra security. Two wide corner seats
make it ideal for foot baths, for bathing
children, for showers.

Yet this Neo-Angle Bath, with its
generous roominess, is only four feet
square! That means new freedom in

planning your bathroom—for decorative
beauty, for saving valuable ﬂoor space.
We urge you to see the Neo-Angle Bath,
and the many other smart plumbing
fixtures for bathrooms, kitchens and
laundries now available in the American-
Standard line. All bear the American-
Standard Mark of Merit—yet they cost
you no more.

tributors to your Heating and Plumbing Contractor—are

ACKNOWLEDGMENT

 

Publishing a yearbook like the Owl would be impossible without the work and cooperation of
many people. One of the greatest rewards of guiding the production of this book has been my
association with these people. Most of them receive little recognition for their service and ask none.
VVhile written words do not sufﬁce to express my gratitude, I should like to take this last bit of
space for a brief acknowledgment of my appreciation.

First, a heartfelt “well done” to every member of this year’s editorial and business staffs.
Each of you has made a substantial contribution to the book, and, though space does not permit
mention of your individual parts, I hope that you will ﬁnd a reward in the ﬁnished result of our
combined effort.

In particular, I should like to thank the following people for assistance, willingly given, that
went far beyond anything that was my right to ask:

MAvIs LOEFFLER, Associate Editor and my girl Friday, without whom I might never have got
the book to press. Her contribution is immeasurable. I can only offer one more “Thanks,
‘Mav'," for being ever-willing to do more than could be expected of anyone and for that
wonderful smile that never faded and kept all of us going through the darkest moments’

The photographers, and especially JAYNE BIBBY and Photo Editor JOHN KULIGUSKI, for their
great sacriﬁces of time and sleep, for painstaking work, and for never failing to come
through on the last—minute assignments that came all too often.

PAT HENEGHAN AND LEE KARAGEORGE, our two old stand-bys who were always ready to
tackle the unpleasant jobs, for theirability to put up with anything including the Editor's
bad disposition.

BILL MCELWAIN, our Faculty Advisor, for his friendly prodding when we needed it and for
many helpful suggestions.

MRS. AGNEs LYNCH STARRETT, University Editor, for the conﬁdence in us which often seemed
over-conﬁdence but which kept us going when the job seemed impossible.

MR. WENDELL GULLION for invaluable advice on technical problems.
MR. TED BOWMAN for his excellent lettering on the division pages.

MR. RoLLINs HADDocK, MR. BOB IHRIG, AND MR. BILL SCHLEUTTER of the Jahn and Ollier
Engraving Co. for their advice and assistance with engraving problems.

MR. PAUL MILLER of Ashby Ine., our printer, for his exceptional cooperation, his patience
with our mistakes, and his willingness to put in long hours of unrewarded overtime in the
last—diteh ﬁght to get the book out on time without sacriﬁcing quality.

Sincerely,

—THE EDITOR
