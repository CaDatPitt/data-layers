Chancellor

ongratulations, Class of 2005!

You have come a long way.

You may be dreaming of the
road ahead of you—further education,
a career, family life. And you may also
be reminiscing about the road you have
traveled during your years in college.
Consider the things you have learned.
Think about the students you have met
in your dorm, in the neighborhood,
and in classes. Although you may not
keep in touch with all of those people,
you will always have something in
common with them. Your lives converged
at one remarkable place—the University
of Pittsburgh.

From the day you arrived in Pittsburgh,
eager to meet friends and begin your
education, to the day you walked away
with your diploma, you created countless
memories. These pages are a timeless
tribute to your University years and the
experiences you have had. Whether some
of your time was spent in a research lab,
in a study abroad program, or on a sports
team, this book will remind you of many
aspects of your collegiate life.

The possibilities you have are endless
now that you have graduated from Pitt.
As you go out into the world, the stories
and photographs in this book will help
remind you of the places and activities
at Pitt that shaped the person you have
become. But even more valuable are
the feelings of spirit and pride that will
come alive as you reflect upon your
accomplishments and friendships at Pitt.
Wherever you go to follow your dreams,
you will always be welcome at the
University of Pittsburgh, your alma mater.

CLASS OF 2005

he University of Pittsburgh has been an

exciting place to be. The Class of 2005

will forever be a part of the campus
improvements, notable achievements, and
national events that took place during the first
years of the 21st century.

As freshmen, students in the Class of 2005
experienced the horrific crisis of September 11,
2001. We grieved during this sad chapter in
our nation's history. In the years following 9/11,
Pitt honored the memory of those who died
with candlelight vigils, film presentations about
the tragedy, and the placement of American
flags on the Cathedral of Learning lawn.

Three years after the 9/1 1 attacks, the Class
of 2005 was able to vote in the 2004 presidential
election. The campus was filled for months with
the excitement of being in a battleground state,
and campaign volunteers urged students to
register to vote. The Democratic presidential
nominee, Senator John Kerry, visited Pitt
in spring 2004, drawing crowds of students
to hear him rally supporters.

 

 

Larry Fitzgerald made the Pitt community proud when he
became the runner—up for the 2003 Heisman Trophy.

With the completion of the Petersen Events
Center in 2002, known affectionately as
"the Pete," basketball moved into a world-
class facility. The men's basketball team
continued to be a nationally prominent program,
qualifying for the Big East Tournament
Championship for the fourth consecutive year.
Standouts such as Jaron Brown, Julius Page,
and Toree Morris won the hearts of Pitt fans
with their hard work, dedication, and success.

On the football field, the one name that
will be forever remembered is Larry Fitzgerald.
His 2003 season ended with eight Big East
receiving records, including records for single
season receptions (92) and touchdown catches
(22), as well as a Heisman Trophy nomination,
the Biletnikoff Award, and a third overall
placement in the NFL draft.

Congratulations, Class of 2005! Enjoy the
memories that will last you a lifetime.

P|TT'S PAST P

With a log cabin that sat on the edge of the American frontier
near Pittsburgh's three rivers, the University of Pittsburgh
was first known as the Pittsburgh Academy. The foresight

and vision of Hugh Henry Brackenridge, who was granted
the charter for the school in 1787, started Pitt's tradition

of innovation and excellence.

Since then, the Oakland campus has grown—from Observatory
Hill on the city's North Side, which is used today by faculty and
students in the astronomy and physics department, to four I
regional campuses in Johnstown, Bradford, Greensburg, and‘
Titusville.

The University of Pittsburgh has been the site of internationally
recognized research, scientific discoveries, andmedical break-
throughs. Since the 18th century, it has evolved into a pioneer
in research and education.

 

The Carnegie Science Center on the North Side

UNIQUELY

here are so many ways to be involved
at Pitt that sometimes students don't
realize the possibilities and excitement
that exist just beyond the campus borders.
Pittsburgh's vibrant and distinct neighborhoods
are as diverse as the students themselves.
It is tempting to put off a long afternoon
of studying and instead hop on one of
the Port Authority buses to explore the quaint
stores of Squirrel Hill or the bustling streets
of downtown Pittsburgh. One can take in
a Pirates game at PNC Park, cheer on the
Steelers at Heinz Field, or study the works of
one of Pittsburgh's most famous homegrown
artists at The Andy Warhol Museum.
Countless hours can be spent gazing at
the wonders in the Pittsburgh Zoo & PPG
Aquarium, reigniting a passion for experiments

at the Carnegie Science Center, or examining
the memorabilia at the Hard Rock Café

in Station Square. The more artistically inclined
may take in a performance at the South Side’s
City Theatre or see the Pittsburgh Ballet perform
at the Cultural District's Benedum Center.

To gain a new perspective on the beauty
of Pittsburgh, it is necessary to take a trip on
the Mount Washington Incline, which offers
an amazing view of the city. With the Cathedral
of Learning always in view in the distance,

Pitt students traveling around the city are
reminded that the city is indeed our campus.

THE
ANCHOR

any things set the University of
Pittsburgh apart from other schools,
but the most unusual is the 535—foot
tall neo-Gothic skyscraper at its center. Ninety-
seven thousand children donated their dimes
to each buy a brick, contributing toward the
goal of constructing a building that would unify
the educational efforts of the University.
The Cathedral of Learning has been an integral
part of Pitt's landscape since it was dedicated
in 1937.
Walking into the Cathedral's Commons
Room feels like walking into the Middle Ages.
The room echoes with the sounds of footsteps

10

on marble and students studying quietly at long
wooden tables. Three stories overhead, the
stone walls of the Commons Room merge

into a vaulted ceiling reminiscent of a French-
Gothic church.

The Cathedral also offers a taste of the
nations of the world with its 26 Nationality Rooms
filled with symbols and architecture of a partic-
ular region or ethnicity. Tributes to Pittsburgh's
ethnic groups, the Nationality Rooms lend
a distinctive flair to attending class.

The tiered lawn is one of the most popular
hangouts for students for a variety of activities.
Many students sit on outdoor benches to get
some fresh air while studying. Others play games
such as football and Frisbee between classes.
Still others simply lie on the grass to relax.

The lower lawn is an especially popular place
for exercise on Sundays.

Whether for learning or playing, the Cathedral
of Learning is an everyday part of life at Pitt.

CLASSES IN CULTURE

ith more than 30,000 visitors each

year, the Nationality Rooms in the

Cathedral of Learning are a main
attraction at the University of Pittsburgh campus
in Oakland. And they are more than just
showpieces. Many students find themselves
taking a class in these landmarks at least once
during their years at Pitt.

The Nationality Rooms were conceived in
the mid—l920s during Chancellor John Bowman's
administration. Bowman offered each nationality
within the city of Pittsburgh the opportunity
to build and fund a special room in the Cathedral
that would highlight the nationality’s art, religion,
and culture. The ethnic communities in the city
took advantage of the opportunity, and these
rooms have been hallmarks of the Cathedral
for decades.

The rooms brought more than just their
beauty to campus. "The creation of the
Nationality Rooms marked the first time that

University of Pittsburgh -

any university in the United States recognized
the immigrant groups as bringing something
other than industrial brawn—that they, too,
had a cultural heritage  to share," said the
late Ruth Crawford Mitchell, founding director
of the Nationality Rooms Program.

That legacy continues today. Pitt is planning
to add seven more nationality rooms, one of
which has already been designated the Welsh
classroom. With this ongoing inclusion of various
ethnic rooms, Pitt students will continue to have
unique settings in which to learn not only about
the subject matters of their classes, but also
about the diverse cultures of the world.

RELIGIOU

t is hard not to notice the timeless beauty

of Heinz Memorial Chapel on the Cathedral

of Learning lawn. Nondenominational, the
chapel combines both religious and academic
themes. It is a place where students and alumni
go to find solace, to hear concerts, and to
get married.

Images of almost 400 famous figures

are depicted in the chape|’s 23 stained glass
windows. Some of those illustrated include
such famous people as Leonardo da Vinci,
Emily Dickinson, William Penn, and Joan of Arc.
The 73—foot—tall windows, which were made from
250,000 mosaic pieces of colored glass, show
an equal number of historic men and women.

From concerts to classes, Heinz Chapel's
13th-century Gothic style architecture is also
home to about 1,500 events annually. It is

14

S RESPITE

one of the most popular places in Pittsburgh
for Pitt alumni to get married. It holds as
many as five weddings each Saturday—and
there is still usually a waiting list to reserve

a date and time.

In addition to guided tours and religious
or memorial services, the chapel’s walls are also
often filled with music from the 4,272 pipes
of its organ or the Heinz Chapel Choir. This
harmony and spirituality make Heinz Memorial
Chapel a special part of Pitt.

OAKLAND
LIVING

t the University of Pittsburgh, there is

no boundary between the Pitt

campus and the Pittsburgh community.
As students walk to class in a bustling urban
environment, they are just steps away from
world-class museums, blooming botanical
gardens, and a nationally renowned medical
center. Because of this, learning at Pitt happens
both in and out of traditional classrooms.

Nestled in Oakland, the campus has the

character of a big city and the feel of a small
town. The variety of architecture and ambience

make the neighborhood interesting and fun
to amble around in. It's common to see
students picking up a hot dog and a friendly
greeting from Scotty's Hot Dog Stand outside
Hillman Library or browsing at Jay's Bookstall.
In their free time, students can bide the hours
sipping coffee at Kiva Han, throwing a Frisbee
in Schenley Park, examining the latest exhibit
at the Carnegie Museum of Art, or strolling
around Phipps Conservatory & Botanical Gardens.
Whether students are at Pitt for a day

or a decade, they are likely to find something
new about Oakland that they somehow never
noticed before.

omecoming 2004 was a time for Pitt

traditions to shine. Whether students

decorated the Panther statue outside
the William Pitt Union or spent the evening
before the football game watching the annual
Fireworks & Laser Show, they were sure to be
part of the excitement that accompanies
homecoming.

Remembering Pitt: Homecoming 2004
included festivities such as the school spirit
banner contest, a performance by the Pep Band,
and a pep rally with Pitt cheerleaders and the
dance team. The Pitt Program Council offered
tarot card readings, caricatures, balloon artists,
and free food after the Friday evening fireworks.

The 2004 Homecoming Court reflected
the high standards of students at Pitt, as the
character and academic standings of the
candidates were both displayed. A minimum

18

GPA of 2.5 was required for students to run
for the court, and the winners completed five
hours of their choice of community service
during the fall semester.

Saturday at noon was game time against
the Rutgers Scarlet Knights, and the Panthers
made fans proud with a 41-17 win. The beautiful
fall day turned into a cool, clear night for
the annual Homecoming Dance cruise along
the rivers of Pittsburgh. As Saturday night
became Sunday morning, the ship docked,
and tired students finally left the dance floor
and filed into the darkness.

The weekend of football, friends, and fun
would not soon be forgotten.

Dave & Andy? Homemade Ice Cream

A TASTE OF
PITT

fter hitting the snooze button at least
once, the average Pitt student is pres-
ented with a difficult question: to eat

or not to eat? If the choice is to eat, luckily
there are lots of options! Grabbing coffee at
Starbucks is the way to go if the snooze button
was pressed one too many times. But if there's
time for a leisurely breakfast, Pamela's is known
for its omelets and pancake crepes.

Students in the mood for more ethnic

cuisine have a plethora of Mexican and Indian
restaurants to choose from, including Vera

 

Veracruz

University of Pittsburgh 0

 

The Original Hot Dog Shop, known as the "O"

Cruz, Qdoba, Baja Fresh, India Garden,

and Prince of India. For an afternoon snack,
Dave & Andy's Homemade Ice Cream offers
a variety of rich flavors. College kids on a
budget appreciate the late-night half—priced
menus of restaurants such as Fuel & Fuddle
and Hemingway's. And the hunt for a real
Pittsburgh favorite leads to Primanti Brothers,
where fries and coleslaw are included in the
signature sandwiches.

Students studying late at the library
need not go hungry. A huge bucket of fries
from "The O" or a $5 pizza from Antoons
will quickly fill an empty stomach.

Bon appetite!

NEW BEGINNINGS

o anyone who is not a Pitt student,

Arrival Survival sounds like the latest

reality show. But for new students it is
not a game show——it is the beginning of the
next four years of their lives.

Freshmen (and their parents) line Fifth
and Forbes Avenues with overflowing yellow
and blue carts, making their way to their new
homes through an obstacle course of boxes,
other students, and other parents who are not
quite ready to say goodbye.

Pitt tries to ease the anxiety of leaving
home and beginning college by providing
friendly upperclassmen to give directions to
Panther Central or lift that heavy box that
a student can't get through the door. Many

The 2004 Activities Fair

22

 

students enjoy a free ice cream bar or bottle
of water in Schenley Quad before loading
onto buses provided by Pitt for a trip to Target
to buy the rug or lamp that will make their
dorm room home.

No student can survive Arrival Survival without
passing a test——in patience. Whether trying to
cross the street while juggling boxes or waiting
in line to buy books, many other new students
are trying to do the exact same thing.

Once all the boxes are unpacked, the
computer is set up, and the Activities Fair
closes down, it's not long before the real work
begins: the first week of class. After Arrival
Survival, the first year as an official college
student begins.

Roommate introductions have been

head back home.

It is time for the next rite of passage that
accompanies the beginning of freshman year:
Freshman Convocation. Held at the Petersen
Events Center, the ceremony resembles
the graduation ceremony from high school
that freshmen had gone through just a few
months before. However, this ceremony
symbolizes the beginning rather than the
end of a great journey.

Chancellor Mark A. Nordenberg addresses
the excited faces filling the arena, urging them
to make the most of the countless opportunities
before them. Distinguished Pitt luminaries and
alumni also speak, extolling the virtues of an
education from Pitt and exemplifying how

the University continues to be a source of
enrichment throughout one’s life. The Student
Government Board president is also on hand,
encouraging students to get involved and make
an impact on campus. The jittery nerves of the
audience begin to fade, as students realize that
there are indeed numerous ways for them to
carve out their own niche and make a mark,
even at such a large and impressive university.
By the end of the afternoon, freshmen

are eager to rise to the challenge that has been
presented to them: to make the most of the
opportunity of being a student at the University
of Pittsburgh.

LIGHTING THE
NIGHT

any traditions at Pitt trace their

beginnings to a previous century,

as in the case of the Lantern Night
ceremony. And still new traditions arise, taking
root on campus and shaping the future. This is
the case with the Panther Prowl event, which
debuted in fall 2004 to help freshmen orient
themselves to campus.

On a warm and rainy Sunday night in August,
Student Government Board members decked
out in matching T—shirts and armed themselves
with flashlights in order to fulfill their mission:
to lead walking tours of the campus and give
new students valuable advice on life at Pitt.
Panther Prowl 2004 was a success all around,
as new students gained college insights for
the years to come and began to find their way
around campus.

While some new Pitt students were prowling,
another tradition was being celebrated: the
84th annual Lantern Night. The Lantern Night
ceremony is a special way for the University to
welcome female freshmen into the community.
The University invites Pitt alumnae to light each
student's lantern, passing the torch of knowledge

26

from one generation to the next. The lanterns,

a gift from the Pitt Alumni Association, are actual
replicas of lanterns used in 1787, the University's
founding year.

Through traditions such as Lantern Night
and Panther Prowl, new students are welcomed
and oriented to campus, and they are later given
the opportunity to give back to the Pitt community
when they lead these events as upperclassmen
and alumni.

SECOND HOME

could not see how these blank walls could

ever take the place of my home. Slowly,

the walls grew more inviting as I covered
them with posters and pictures. I began to accept
that the sounds of birds chirping outside my
bedroom window at home would be replaced
with the sounds of helicopters landing on
the roof of a neighboring hospital.

Dinner with my family was replaced by

ordering pizza at 3 a.m. with the guys next door.

As an only child, I had grown up longing for
the company of siblings. Now, I had 30
"brothers" always ready to hang out in front
of the television, play games of hallway hockey,
or complain about professors. Sharing our lives
with each other, we grew as close as a family.

University of Pittsburgh 0

Memories of missed 8 a.m. recitations are
now faded. What I remember is staying up all
night building a fish tank out of a desk drawer
and flooding the room. I recall what it was like
to take down the posters and pictures at the
end of the year and feel a lump in my throat
as I saw the walls turn bare.

Watching my "brothers" go through the
same process, I realized that life would never
be the same for the boys of Lothrop 3. But as
I moved into my new home in Sutherland Hall
the following year and found myself hanging
up more pictures of my friends from Pitt than
from home, I knew that as long as we held
the memories of the dorm in our hearts, we
would always be together.

COMMUTING 101

he University of Pittsburgh attracts

students with diverse backgrounds,

talents, and personalities from across
the United States and all corners of the globe.
But for some students, the University is a mere
bus or car ride away from home.

Commuters may have the benefit of free
laundry and home—cooked meals, yet they go
through ordeals that other students never
contend with, such as planning ahead for traffic
and trying to find a place to take a midday nap.

30

Commuters also know something most other
Pitt students don't know: which parking meters
in Oakland are broken!

Although they may not live on campus,
commuters leave their own distinctive marks
on the Pitt community. Angela Sarkis,

a commuter from the South Hills and president
of Pitt's chapter of Sigma Alpha Lambda,
remains involved in campus activities despite
her daily 20-minute commute.

"All in all, I like commuting," she says.

''I just load all my books in a file tote in my
trunk and go. My advice to commuters is to
plan wisely, condense your schedule, and
get up early! "

In the end, commuters get all the benefits
of a prestigious university while still enjoying
the familiar comforts of home.

GREAT DISCOVERIES

Engineering Professor Reginald Fessenden proved that radio
waves could transmit human speech in 1904. In the 1920s,
alumnus Vladimir Zworykin patented the television camera
tube and the first color television system. Jonas Salk and his
associates developed a polio vaccine in 1952, virtually eliminating
the disease in the United States. In these ways and many more,
the University of Pittsburgh has changed the world as a leader
in research and academia. I

The Conference Board of Associated Research Councils I
named the University's philosophy department among the top five
in the country in 1982. Two years later, Pitt was the only place in
the United States where transplant surgery on all six major organs
had been performed. By 1985, the chemistry department was one
of the country's leaders in external research support per faculty
member. Today, the Graduate School of Health and Rehabilitation
Sciences, the Graduate School of Public Health, the School of
Medicine, and the School of Pharmacy remain national leaders
in research funding from the National Institutes of Health.

Whether in the lab or the classroom, the faculty and students
at Pitt have made lasting contributions to the world.

WHAT AN
HONOR

step into the elevator on the ground floor

of the Cathedral of Learning and press the

top button. The doors close, and I watch
the numbers light up as I ascend.

Thirty—six floors above the high ceiling and
dark, gothic fireplaces of the Commons Room,
the elevator doors open, revealing an area
that looks more like a private library or study
than University property. A wooden staircase
accented with brass connects two floors that
contain offices, walls of bookcases, and a
furnished lounge. This is the University Honors
College (UHC) Honors Center.

Student interaction is a vital part of the University Honors
Co//ege experience.

University of Pittsburgh 0

   

The Honors Center has an idea/ atmosphere for studying.

The goal of UHC is to provide talented and
motivated students with demanding courses
and enriching opportunities. In addition to
offering a Bachelor of Philosophy degree, UHC
sponsors activities that are open to all students
and take place within the Honors Center and
in other locations across campus.

As I walk through the center, half a dozen
students are sitting on the couches discussing
the upcoming presidential election as part of
a weekly lecture series that UHC sponsors.

On the wall are fliers announcing the weekly
film series and literary discussion groups.

In the tapered peak of the Cathedral, the
sun shines through the high windows of the
Honors Center and fills the smaller rooms with
light. The view of Oakland is of the parking
lots, which look like they are filled with little
Matchbox cars. The students smile at me as
I pass by and walk into a room filled with
literature about UHC scholarships, public service,
and teaching or research opportunities. These
and other honors college offerings add much
to the student experience.

SCHOLARLY SUPPORT

ith tuition, room and board,

meal plans, and books, college

is expensive. But Pitt students are
lucky because the University offers hundreds
of scholarships that allow graduating high
school seniors access to higher education at
a lower cost. Also impressive is that Pitt
students’ academic achievements have earned
them scholarship awards that both cut costs
and open doors of opportunity.

In the 2003-04 academic year, Pitt's
University Honors College students received
awards in every prestigious national commem-
orative undergraduate scholarship category.
These included Truman, Udall, and Goldwater
scholarships.

From the Pitt Alumni Association to the
School of Arts and Sciences, Pitt confers merit-
and need-based scholarships. One of the
University's many scholarships is the Nelson
named Mandela Children's Fund Scholarship,

36

named in honor of Mandela, who empower-
ed South Africa’s anti—apartheid movement.
The first recipient of this prestigious award,
Carol Mothupi, originally of South Africa,
was grateful.

"This gives me the opportunity to travel
the world and live among people different
than me," Mothupi said. "Coming [to Pitt] is
going to make my life much more adventurous."

Mothupi plans to become a doctor and return
to her homeland to practice.

Students who receive Pitt scholarships gain
opportunities they may only have dreamed of but
never thought possible. With the help of Pitt's
scholarships, their dreams can become reality.

me and I will learn," illustrates the nature of
undergraduate education at Pitt, because the
University offers an abundance of resources for
students looking to get involved in research
and, therefore, learn.

The Office of Experiential Learning (OEL)
has programs that give undergraduates financial
support for research, either for developing their
own projects or for taking part in an already-
established project. Akshar Abbott is a senior at
Pitt who, through the Brackenridge Scholarship

 

P   rt
A/<shar Abbott worked a/ongside a faculty advisor,
D5 lain Campbe//, on his research project.

University of Pittsburgh 0

 

 

program within OEL, was able to explore an
idea that he had during Commercial
Microbiology class.

Abbott's research centered on creating
a policy that would encourage pharmaceutical
companies to invest in public health development,
instead of the industry's current focus on
quality—of—life drugs. His research essay was
titled "A Feasibility Study of Market—Driven
FDA Approval Reform."

When relating his experience, Abbott
reflected on the significance of "moving from
that moment in class when the question arises
to actually applying it.” Brackenridge scholars
also presented their projects to one another,
and Abbott said it was fascinating to listen to
"a history person asking a physics question."

Through research, students expand on
their area of study, present ideas to the world,
and enter a new level of involvement in the
halls of academe.

BY THE BOOK

ith more than 200 computers, 1.5
million volumes, and study capacity
for some 1,500 students, Hillman
Library is more than just a place to cram for
a major exam.
The $12 million facility, named for J.H. Hillman
Jr., was dedicated in 1968 at the inauguration
of Chancellor Wesley W. Posvar. Hillman Library
is one of more than a dozen libraries on the
Oakland campus. It is the largest, boasting five
floors of resources that are available year—round.
Hillman houses many specialized collections as
well as maps, newspapers from around the world,
and microfilm facilities. Its collections include

40

 

the African—American Collection and the
Eduardo Lozano Latin American Collection.

In 1960, the University of Pittsburgh was
ranked as one of the 20 National Defense
Education Act centers for Chinese studies.
Shortly thereafter, Pitt began a Chinese collection.
Japanese and Korean materials have since
been added, and the collection has expanded
to include a variety of multimedia resources.
Today, the East Asian collection is a library in
its own right and is one of the major East Asian
collections in the United States. Hillman is indeed
a library that can accommodate students with
diverse interests.

Outside Hillman, the Pittsburgh campus
is home to other specialty libraries, including
the Mathematics Library and the Falk Library
of the Health Sciences. In all, Pitt's library
system holds nearly 7 million items.

UTA Jacob Levine discusses students’ papers with coordinator
and lecturer in environmentai studies Mark Co//ins.

Bethany Hofstetter tutors another student at the Writing Center

PEER-TO-PEER

ow can students teach other students?
Look no further than the Office of
Experiential Learning (OEL) to find out.
OEL offers a variety of opportunities for students
who can tutor one another through venues
such as the Writing Center. They can also
serve as University teaching assistants (UTAs)
by getting involved in the Undergraduates
Teaching Undergraduates program. Undergrads
can even become student academic counselors
or peer leaders.
Jacob Levine, a UTA, says his experience
teaching his peers was worthwhile and beneficial.
"|t’s a very satisfying feeling to know that
others are improving their communication skills
with my assistance," he says. " It has also been
a boost for my own academic work; being on

University of Pittsburgh 0

the other side of grading assignments has given
me a sharper sense of what works well on paper
and what doesn't. Overall, the position has
been a fun experience that has complemented
the rest of my undergraduate education."
Levine's experience is typical of what

happens when undergraduates get involved

in teaching and leadership programs—they help
fellow students learn, while reinforcing their
own education. They also improve their own
communication and leadership skills, build their
resumes, and gain confidence and satisfaction
from helping others learn.

rom books to poetry and from nonfiction
to fantasy, hundreds of Pitt faculty and
students have had their writing published.
In fact, the Department of English’s writing
program is one in which faculty publish regularly
—and receive critical acclaim. Many of Pitt's
writing professors have been on The New York
Times’ bestsellers list.
This is just one reason that Pitt's writing
program is one of the best in the country;
it includes tracks in fiction, nonfiction, and
poetry. At the University of Pittsburgh, faculty
members, graduate students, and undergrad-
uates share their work in a variety of venues.
For example, the Master of Fine Arts degree
program has a popular reading series in which
graduate student writers reveal their latest
creations to the campus community.
Furthermore, students are able to listen
to professional writers read their work through
the Pittsburgh Contemporary Writers Series,
which brings nationally renowned writers to
Pitt. Poets, essayists, and writers of short
stories, fiction, and nonfiction come to the
Frick Fine Arts building to deliver excerpts of
their work.
The University of Pittsburgh also has a
variety of on—campus publications displaying
undergraduate work. In addition to online

44

journals and magazines, there are several print-
ed collections. PaperCut and the Three Rivers
Review showcase fiction and poetry along with
student photographs, while Co//ision publishes
nonfiction writings. For those who enjoy
academically oriented writing, the Pittsburgh
Undergraduate Review focuses on original
undergraduate scholarship.

Whether their love is for reading or writing,
literary types can find many ways to express
themselves at Pitt. A

FREEDOM

he FREEDOM Mentoring and Leadership

Development Project (commonly known

simply as FREEDOM) is the minority
honor society at the University of Pittsburgh.
It aims to increase the retention of minorities at
the University by broadening student satisfaction,
involvement, and academic enrichment.
By providing students with information, career
advice, and volunteer opportunities, FREEDOM
hopes to increase the quality of the time its
members spend at Pitt.

FREEDOM offers many programs to enhance
the lives of students and provide social and
professional support. FREEDOM Corner is
a central location where minority students can
access information about current events relevant
to their needs and concerns. There are also
programs that allow students to network and
establish mentor relationships with professionals
from Pittsburgh.

Project Symposium

Ebony L. Tan, manager of FREEDOM, says
the organization opens the eyes of minority
students. "Students who join FREEDOM become
more aware of what goes on around campus
beyond the surface," says Tan. "They see the
reality of the struggles of some of their peers
and are capable of helping them."

Students are not the only people FREEDOM
helps. In addition to participating in the peer-
mentoring system, FREEDOM members also
contribute to the Pittsburgh community at large
by volunteering at places such as the Shuman
Juvenile Detention Center. This is all in an effort
to enrich the Pittsburgh community——and with
its history of service to Pitt students and the city,
there is no question that FREEDOM does just that.

PANTHER PRIDE

Pitt not only develops great minds, but also great sports legends.
John Woodruff was a middle-distance and cross-country runner
who won the 800-meter event at the Olympic Games in Berlin
while a freshman at Pitt in 1936. At the 2004 Olympic Games
in Athens, Pitt alumna Trecia Smith placed fourth in the triple
jump event for Jamaica.

Pitt also scor_es high on the football field. Tony Dorsett was .
a Heisman Trophy winner in. 1976 when the Panthers won the
national championship. All-America quarterback Dan Marino 1
starred at Pitt in the early 1980s; he joined the Miami Dolphins
in 1983 and was named NFL Rookie of the Year after his first
professional season.

In 1978, the Panthers enjoyed an undefeated swim season.
The men's swim team currently holds 19 Big East titles. Regardless

of the sport or event, Pitt Panthers fans can be proud.

 

ounds of shouting voices echo as hundreds
of Pitt students make their way to their
seats in the student section of Heinz Field.
As the students emerge from the dark passages
into the stadium, a familiar trend is observed:
blue and gold T—shirts, colorful signs, and
of course, an excited and encouraging crowd.
Meanwhile, on the field, Pitt students who
had spent all summer training show off what
they worked hard to achieve——a talented,
well-rounded football team ready to take on
the competition.

50

In 2001, playing the first college game at
Heinz Field, the Panthers beat East Tennessee
State 31-0. In 2002, the team did the unthink-
able and defeated the unbeatable Virginia Tech
in the final quarter. In 2003, Larry Fitzgerald
won a claim to Pittsburgh fame as he became
the Heisman Trophy runner—up and winner of
the Big East Offensive Player of the Year award
and the Biletnikoff Award. Fitzgerald has been
featured in Sports ///ustrateo’ magazine and
other national media.

The University of Pittsburgh has always
produced great athletes. Alumni such as
Dan Marino, Mike Ditka, Mark May, Marshall
Goldberg, and Tony Dorsett have been great
assets and prove to today's students that hard
work, dedication, and teamwork lead to great
accomplishments.

As the Panthers began their 2004 season
with a win against Ohio, the lights on the top
tier of the Cathedral of Learning glowed
gold—as with every victory—symbolizing the
University's pride in its beloved Panthers.

t is hard to step into the Petersen Events

Center on the night of a basketball game

and not feel a growing sense of excitement
while approaching the student section, the
Oakland Zoo. The seats lining the court are
always packed with fans sporting signature
yellow Oakland Zoo T-shirts, and groups
of bold student fans paint their stomachs and
don yellow and blue wigs in support of their
Panthers. The crowd's anticipation is palpable.

University of Pittsburgh 0

Better yet, who can forget those hours at
Heinz Field standing by a grill with hundreds
of other Pitt students playing music, throwing
footballs, and cheering for a football game that '
hasn't even started? These experiences are some
of the most defining moments in a Pitt student's
career because they are not only about loving

the Panthers, but also about loving the University.

Whether it means giving constant support
to a team reaching the last minutes of a close
game or joining together to cheer at pep rallies,
Panther pride is abundant. From basketball to
track and field, Pitt boasts some of the best
collegiate athletic programs in the country, which
have the support and allegiance of students
and alumni worldwide.

Hail to Pitt!

Coach Jamie Dixon

 

KINGS OF THE COURT

t is 11:59 a.m. Pitt students are huddled

closely around their computers, hands

clutching the mouse. In one minute they
will all attempt one thing: to purchase
basketball tickets. Despite the harsh first—come,
first—served nature of online ticket distribution,
many find it a relief from previous years, when
students camped out overnight to secure seats
for the games.

The huge success of the men's basketball
team leaves no question about why people want
tickets. The guidance of Coach Jamie Dixon,
who clinched the title of 2004 Big East Coach
of the Year, brought a lot of energy to the
already prospering Pittsburgh program. In his
first year, Dixon led the Panthers to their third
Sweet Sixteen appearance and their fifth all-time
Big East regular season title.

And Panthers basketball just continues
to improve. In the past 13 seasons, the team
has made more NCAA tournament and TV

54

appearances than it had in its entire history
prior to 1982. In the 2003-04 season, the
Panthers won an impressive 87 percent of
their games.

Pitt basketball has been home to a number
of powerhouses such as Brandin Knight,
Jaron Brown, and Julius Page. The program also
is laying the foundation for a great future for
athletes such as Carl Krauser, Mark McCarroll,
and Chris Taft.

The men of the Pittsburgh Panthers
basketball team are continuing a tradition
of excellence, and the bounds of their success
seem limitless. Because of that, competition
for student tickets will continue to be as fierce
as the competition on the court.

leader. With these two standouts and other
exceptional players, the Panthers in 2004
clinched a winning season for the 30th time
in 31 years.

Under the guidance of fourth season Coach
Chris Beerman, the Panthers have become
a powerful women's volleyball team. In 2000,
Coach Beerman’s debut resulted in the Panthers’
best season in six years. In 2002, the team tied
for fourth place in the Big East Conference, and
it won the conference in 2003. Pitt beat Notre
Dame 3-0 on its home court, a feat that no
other team has been able to achieve. /-\s a result
of these accomplishments, Beerman was named
the Big East Co—Coach of the Year in 2003.

With a remarkable record and dedicated
athletes, the University of Pittsburgh's women's
volleyball team continues to be a powerhouse

to the most wins ever by a first—year coach.
Senior Cara Senger led the team in 2003 with
the most points and goals and tied the school
record with her three goals against Robert

good athletes but notable students as well.
In 2004, 10 student athletes earned Big East
All—Star honors, and 10 more had grade point
averages of 3.0 or higher.

The men's team boasts just as many
accomplishments. For 21 years, veteran Coach
Joe Luxbacher has been bringing out the best
in his team, and he has also written 16 books
about soccer and fitness. The athletes undergo
strenuous training and say they almost always
have soccer on their minds. In 2004, standouts
such as seniors Billy Brush as a forward and
Jacob Kring as a defensive player added to
the excellent chemistry of the team.

With successful pasts and bright futures,
both teams demonstrate what fans expect of
Pitt athletics at the University of Pittsburgh.

SPLASHING TO
VICTORY

here is complete silence as each swimmer

gets into position. Suddenly, the athletes

jump into the Olympic—sized swimming
pool in Trees Hall, which has been the home to
the Men's and Women's Swimming and Diving
Teams since 1962. As the swimmers glide across
the water, hard work and dedication are evident,
both in the strong strokes of the individual
athletes and in the strong team records in the
Big East Conference, with wins against some
of the top schools in the nation.

Early in 2004, the men's team won its eighth
consecutive Big East Conference title against
Notre Dame. This win marked the team's
19th Big East title in the past 22 years, the most
of any team in any sport in the conference.

The women's team has also had victories to
commemorate. In 2004 it achieved its first

University of Pittsburgh -

winning dual-meet record since 1999-2000.
The team won nine consecutive titles from
1983-91.

Furthermore, the men and women boast
academic success. In 2004, the College Swim
Coaches Association honored members of
the team for maintaining grade point averages
higher than 3.0. The women were also honored
for earning a cumulative team average of 3.4,
which tied them for the highest average
among Division I schools. Overall, the Men's and
Women's Swimming and Diving Teams continue
to excel and to raise the bar in academic and
athletic excellence.

TUMBLING
TEAM

t not only takes strong muscles to be a
gymnast, but strong commitment——as the

women's gymnastics team at Pitt has shown.

These devoted athletes have created close ties
with one another as they have learned that
perseverance, practice, and passion foster
great rewards.

In 2003, the team gained the highest point
total in Pitt's history in the NCAA Northeast
Regional Championships. Then, in 2004,
the team finished fourth in the East Atlantic
Gymnastics League Championships.

62

Academically, the team ranked nationally in
highest overall grade point average for 2002—O3.
The woman behind it all, Coach Debbie Yohman,
was named NCAA Northeast Region Coach
of the Year in 2002.

The team starts practicing about four months
before its season begins, putting in 20 hours a
week and sometimes more. With a new training
center in Trees Hall, Pitt's gymnastics team trains
at the same level as some of the top programs
in the nation. Seniors Leila Tait and Sarah Gibson
have been on the team since their freshmen
year and are helping the younger members
adjust to competition at the collegiate level.

As the members of the gymnastics team rely
on one another for encouragement, they also
inspire one another to do the best they can.
This team spirit in an individual sport ensures
that all the athletes shine.

BATTER UP!

he men and women of the Pitt baseball

and softball teams get better every year.

The baseball team boasted a 38-18
record and competed in the Big East Champion-
ships for the second time in school history
in 2004. Sophomore Jim Negrych and junior
Ben Copeland were two star players of the
2004 season. Negrych was named co—Most
Valuable Player in the New England Collegiate
Baseball League and the Defensive Player of
the Year. Copeland has broken records for
stolen bases and runs scored. He also led
the team in batting average, homeruns, hits,
and triples. Other outstanding players include
PJ. Hiser, Nick Evangelista, and Bryan Spamer,
all of whom earned honors from the Eastern
Collegiate Athletic Conference.

University of Pittsburgh 0

The softball team is also excelling. In recent
years, Nikki Gasti, Francesca DiMaria, and Casey
Pickard have rewritten the team's record book,
and the Panthers have a new home at Trees
Hall, built in 2003.

The baseball and softball teams begin their
season in February and finish near the end of
May. They give students reasons to cheer in
the cold winter months, showing how their
teamwork leads to victory.

STRETCH YOURSELF

tudents work out not only their minds

at Pitt—they also work out their

bodies! It's easy to stay fit at Pitt because
of the many gyms and sports clubs. The largest
of the gyms on campus is located at the
Petersen Events Center. The new state—of-the-
art facility also offers students an exceptional
space for other recreational activities such as
racquetball. If students prefer to be outdoors,
the Cathedral of Learning lawn is a favorite for
Frisbee and football. To get a break from campus,
students can enjoy miles of scenic trails in
nearby Schenley Park.

The rugby club practices on the Cathedral /awn.

Pitt's club sports are open to both male
and female students—and they can be pretty
competitive. In 2004, the women's lacrosse team
only lost one regular season game. The crew
team rows against teams from Big East and
Big Ten schools along with other universities in
the eastern United States. The ultimate Frisbee
team includes students from both Pitt and
Carnegie Mellon University. And for hockey

players, there are both local and traveling teams.

The teams play their games at various
facilities. For example, the rugby club——which
has a fall and a spring season——plays its home
games at Frick Park. The men's lacrosse team
plays its home games at the Cost Center.

Other intramural sports include indoor
and outdoor soccer, volleyball, touch football,
basketball, racquetball, and squash. Whether
students are looking for a relaxing run or some
friendly competition, there are abundant oppor-
tunities to get out of class and get fit at Pitt.

CULTURE ON CAMPUS

Pitt has international flair! In fact, more than 1,800 students from
more than 120 nations come to one of the University's campuses
each year, attracted by the quality of Pitt's academic and cultural
life. Students often enroll in classes through a variety of language
and literature departments, including Germanic, Slavic, East Asian,
Hispanic, and French and Italian.

Students who come to campus from other countries also find
many resources and programs to promote cultural consciousness.
There is the International Living Community in Bruce Hall, where
international and American students not only share a home with
one another, but also customs, values, and occasional authentic
ethnic meals. There is also the Office of International Services,
whose mission is to help foreign students acclimate and to

, facilitate international exchange.

WORLDLY
WORDS

he University of Pittsburgh prepares
students for the demands of working
in an increasingly global world through
its nine foreign language programs and several
language clubs. The benefits of these clubs
are tremendous. Students can improvetheir
speaking and reading skills and make lifelong
friendships with others who have similar
interests. They also gain knowledge about
the culture of the language they are studying.
The Russian Club, for example, offers Kino
Tuesdays, a series of movies in Russian. The
Italian Club helps students interpret literature

and provides assistance to those enrolled
in Italian classes.

The clubs also infuse some fun into learning '

a new language. The German Language

and Literature Club holds several field trips and
events each year and meets regularly at Kiva
Han on South Craig Street. Members of the
club the Brazil Nuts, focuse on the Portuguese
language, watch Portuguese films and videos
to help them improve their foreign language
listening skills.

All of this spices up the experience of foreign
language majors. While students are building
their language skills, they interact with their
peers, increase their knowledge of another
culture——and have fun.

GLOBAL GROUPS

reated in 1968 as a way to integrate
knowledge and understanding of
international cultures, the University
Center for International Studies (UCIS) is a
world—renowned hub of international education.
Not only does UCIS encompass various academic
programs—such as the Asian Studies Center,
the Center for Latin American Studies, and the
International Business Center—on Pitt's Oakland
campus, it also offers study abroad programs.
One of UCIS’s main goals is to provide

Pitt students and faculty with knowledge of

the world and the forces that shape its future.
This is evident in the many programs it offers.
The popular International Fair, for example,

is a weeklong exhibition of music, food, dance,
and art sponsored by UCIS and the Office

of International Services.

72

This is just one of many events that UCIS
sponsors. In fact, throughout the year there
are programs including music concerts, lectures,
and film screenings showcasing or describing
a certain nation or culture. These, along with
newsletters such as the Asian Studies Center
Monthly Newsletter and occasional published
papers, offer a plethora of information to
faculty and students alike.

For 36 years, UCIS has helped shape
the lives of Pitt students by opening the world
around them and offering a view of life outside
the bounds of campus.

studying and traveling abroad.

Every year, Pitt hosts International Week,
sponsored by the University Center for Inter-

The theme of International Week 2004
was Connecting Cultures; Sharing Communities.
It was a celebration of food, culture, and fun
with events such as an Oakland restaurant
tour—which gave Pitt students, faculty, and staff
the opportunity to sample foods from ethnic
restaurants around campus——and a lesson in
ethnic folk dancing from a professional Bulgarian
dance instructor. The Latin American and Carib-
bean festival celebrated its 25th anniversary as
part of International Week 2004 and featured
the work of Mexican artist Rubén Alfonso
Lopez Nieto.

The University of Pittsburgh works hard to
bring the diversity of the world to campus and
to encourage students to expand their horizons
and embrace new ideas and customs.

A PASSPORT session

  PASSPORT, PLEASE

or foreign students looking to broaden

their horizons on American soil, the Office

of International Services (OIS) is the place
where they can start learning about American
culture and grounding themselves at Pitt.

OIS is the University of Pittsburgh's center
for international students, faculty, and staff.

In addition to assisting with administrative details
and advising, OIS offers a variety of programs
for foreign students. One such program is
Preparing and Assisting Students and Scholars
at Pitt through Orientation, Resources, and
Training (PASSPORT). It is a series of six sessions
on topics that relate to the challenges faced

by international students. Through PASSPORT,
foreign students have the opportunity to interact
with one another while learning to acclimate to
their new home.

Some of O|S's programs are not exclusively
for international students—many seek to create
a setting for interaction between Americans
and foreigners. Not surprisingly, most of these

University of Pittsburgh 0

settings are created around the universal student
favorite: food. The International Coffeehouse
hosts parties organized by international student
groups in an effort to showcase some aspects
of the cultures represented by these groups.
These parties usually include food, costume,
and dance. The International Demonstration
Cooking Series is a monthly event at which
a host cook demonstrates food and cooking
techniques of his/her home country. Weekly
Eat’n’Meet Intercultural Bag Lunches provide
a relaxed atmosphere for students and scholars
from around the world to meet and talk in an
informal setting.

With the variety of high quality programs
offered by OIS, students do not have to navigate
a new culture and a new campus on their own.

F U N FACTS

In 1909, the University of Pittsburgh added a new face to campus
—the face of the panther. Students and alumni chose it as the
mascot because of its ferociousness and nobility and because
it was indigenous to the area. Also, panthers can be naturally
golden, one of Pitt's school colors. No other college or university
had a panther mascot at the time. _

More than 50 major motion pictures have been filmed in
and around Pittsburgh since 1990, including Houseguest, Inspector
Gadget, Wonder Boys, Dogma, and Night of the Living Dead.
Scenes from Silence of the Lambs were filmed in Soldiers & Sailors
Memorial Ha||—Hanniba| Lector was in a "prison" on Pitt's campus
and "guarded" by a Pitt faculty member. /

The Music Building was the first home of WQED, the country's
first community-owned television station. It was also the original

' site for the production of Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood. Wesley W.

Posvar Hall is on the site of legendary Forbes Field, home of the
Pittsburgh Pirates. from 1909-70. Babe Ruth hit his last two home
runs at the ballpark. And one last little tidbit: The Cathedral

of Learning has 2,529 windows.

 

WHAT IS JEOPARDY?

 

et another Panther statue showed
up on campus in October 2004. This
time it was part of a game show set.

For the filming of the 2004 Jeopardy!
Co//ege Championship, the Petersen Events
Center basketball arena was transformed into
a set featuring a three—dimensional replica of
the Cathedral of Learning. The set also included
a replica of "The Thinker" sitting on a stack
of books, toting a graduation cap, and holding
a diploma.

With seating for more than 3,000 at the
Pete, the audience of students and community
members energized the tapings.

" It's fun for us to be in front of enthusiastic
fans," said Jeopardy! host Alex Trebek. Fifteen
students from colleges and universities across
the country competed against one another,
including a native Pittsburgher from Dickinson
College, a Carnegie Mellon University student,
and Amanda Nowotny, a Pitt sophomore.

Nowotny is a music and po|itics—philosophy
major in the University Honors College; she
is also pursuing a minor in French. At the
beginning of the first day of taping, Nowotny
described the experience as "sort of surreal
and exciting."

82

Pitt was proud to host the championship,
and the Jeopardy! crew was pleased with
its choice.

"With over 33 colleges and universities in the
area, the ’College City’ seemed a natural fit to
host the 2004 Jeopardy! College Championship,"
said Executive Producer Harry Friedman.

Trebek also was impressed with Pitt. " It is
one of the friendliest and best environments,
and its facilities are great, especially for sports,"
he said. ''I love it here."

BARREL OF LAUGHS

”And the /ast rule is the Wang Chung ru/e:

riday Night lmprov, or FNI, is Pittsburgh's

only all—audience participation improv

comedy show. Long before Drew Carey
popularized improv games on his show Whose
Line Is it Anyway?, the University of Pittsburgh
was hosting this event weekly in the Cathedral
of Learning’s basement Studio Theatre.

FNI was conceived by graduate students in
Pitt's Department of Theatre Arts in 1989.
While it was initially intended to be an informal
workshop, a place where student actors could
flex their skills, the education was eclipsed by
the entertainment and it was opened to the
entire student body. FNI has since performed
more than 500 shows and has kept students
laughing through the years.

86

In addition to providing laughs, FNI offers
a weekly "showcase," a segment of the show
during which anyone interested can get up and
perform a talent, acting or nonacting related.
Past acts have included musical performances,
poetry readings, and stand—up comedy. As long
as it's entertaining, the floor is open!

FNI is also involved in the community at
large. It has hosted 24-hour improv events as
well as five |mprov—a—Thons, and it has raised
more than $20,000 for local and global charities.
Through FNI, fun times and good works go
hand in hand.

EVENTS FOR ALL

ver wonder who was in charge of bringing
that internationally known speaker to
campus or who decided to get that great
film in widescreen and Dolby surround sound?
The answer is the Pitt Program Council,
which is a group of Pitt students who plan
events for other students. Recreation, travel,
politics, lectures, arts, and entertainment—this
club has it all. In fall 2004, the group planned
a Russian art exhibit, a debate between former
Vermont Governor Howard Dean and Ralph
Reed, and a show by hypnotist Ken Whitener.
The Pitt Program Council also brings Pitt
traditions to life each year, sponsoring Fall Fest
and Bigelow Bash as well as homecoming
activities, including the Fireworks & Laser Show,

90

a cruise on the Gateway Clipper Party Liner, and
the Homecoming Festival in the William Pitt Union.
The Pitt Program Council is also known for
is its low—cost student travel opportunities.
Students have had the chance to visit Canada
just before finals roll around or to spend
spring break in
an exotic locale without breaking the bank.
The council also gives back to Pitt students
by sponsoring a book fund, which provides
outstanding students with funding for textbooks.
The Pitt Program Council is one of the largest
organizations on campus and works hard every
year to provide a little something for every student.

known as the William Pitt Union (WPU)
became the hub of student life at the University
of Pittsburgh in 1956. It is an invaluable
asset to the campus, housing many student
organizations, including the Student Government
Board and the student radio station, WPTS.

The WPU also contains the Schenley Café,
where students are ushered into the wonderful
world of "dining dollars." Students can be
found relaxing and shooting pool or playing
arcade games in the game room adjacent to
the cafeteria. The TV room is always crammed

with sports fans checking the scores of the
latest Pirates or Steelers game. The elegant
main floor is home to the ballroom, which
welcomes a variety of activities each year, from
distinguished speakers to fraternity formal
dances. An art gallery in the lobby displays a
constantly changing menagerie of images,
from world-class artwork to photographs from
students’ study abroad experiences.

On any given day, it's easy to walk through
the building and be energized by the flurry of
activity: students donating blood, Pitt News
reporters scurrying upstairs with the latest scoop,
and friends laughing at each other as they try
the Dance Dance Revolution machine.

The union is like a microcosm of student life.
A quick stroll through the building provides a
snapshot of the studying, the playing, the friends,
and the opportunities that abound at Pitt.

TAKE A BREAK

ach year around the end of February,

students begin to get a little restless.

Tired of the snow and classes, they just
need a break. Thankfully, spring break arrives,
bringing lots of opportunities to travel. Many
students get together with friends and—with
the help of online travel agencies—spend time
on the sunny islands of the Caribbean or on
the coast of Mexico. The Pitt Program Council
offers inexpensive trips to Florida, including
round—trip transportation and accommodations
for groups of two, three, or four students.

Instead of going on a traditional spring break

vacation, some students prefer to volunteer.
Student Volunteer Outreach organizes alternative

94

 

trips that include more than just relaxation.
Students travel to different areas of the country
to take part in community service projects such
as tutoring children, building homes in low-
income communities, or preparing meals

for people with HIV. Students’ trips have
included restoring cabins for the historic ranch
at Yellowstone National Park and working
with researchers on the Yellowstone Ecosystems
Studies.

Whether students go on traditional or
alternative spring breaks, it is a time to be
with friends, explore new environments, and
help important causes. Students return to
Oakland feeling refreshed and ready to embark
on the last weeks of the academic year.

Much Ado About Nothing

CURTAIN CALL

xcellence in theater is a long—standing
tradition at the University of Pittsburgh.
The faculty of Pitt's Department of
Theatre Arts believes it is only through the study,
practice, and experience of the art of theater
that we gain imagination and understanding
of our place in the world. With two theater
groups sharing the spotlight on Pitt's campus,
there are many opportunities for students to
showcase their talents—and for audiences
to learn and grow as they see the shows.
Vernell Lillie and the late Rob Penny founded
the Kuntu Repertory Theatre in 1974. With three
major productions a year, the company focuses
on presenting the work of African American
writers. In the process, they examine Black life
from a social and political perspective, challeng-
ing their audiences to see life from a new angle.
The 2004-05 season, the group's 30th, included

University of Pittsburgh 0

musicals that highlighted New Orleans and
New York jazz.

The Pitt Repertory Theatre, run by the
Department of Theatre Arts, is the other main
source of exposure for student actors. Continuing
the tradition that began in 1982, the 2004-05
season offered an assortment of themes and
styles. Plays ranged from the Japanese folktale
Rashomon to George Bernard Shaw's Arms
and the Man. Working alongside local artists-
in—residence, students learn their craft from
professionals in the field. Always eclectic,
Pitt Rep performances contribute greatly to
cultural life at Pitt.

GETTING INVOLVED

Student life at Pitt is a vital part of the college experience.
Participation in organizations encourages camaraderie, leadership,
and character development. Further, the University community

as a whole benefits from student involvement in such groups. For
example, the Varsity Marching Band demonstrates the musical skills
and school spirit of Pitt students at pep rallies and sporting events.

For the students who are less musically inclined, there are

numerous groups to be involved in, from Greek life to Student
Government Board to Student Volunteer Outreach. The time and
effort of the students who run these organizations is apparent on
campus each day in the form of fundraisers, forums, and volunteer
events, to name a few of the contributions that students make to
campus life. Student commitment to campus organizations ensures
that going to school at Pitt is engaging and exciting, even outside
the classroom.

 

 

STUDENT VOICES

 

he Student Government Board (SGB) is

the umbrella organization for all student

groups at Pitt. Its goal is to promote
the concerns, interests, needs, and welfare of
the undergraduate student body and to fairly
allocate student funds.

SGB elections for its eight members and
president take place in the fall of each year.
They serve a one—year term. On January 5,
2004, Brian Kelly was sworn in as president.

In the November 17, 2004, election, Kelly was
voted in for a second term.

A student interested in running for an
SBG board position must officially apply and be
approved by the University. The student must
then obtain signatures and sponsors for his/her
campaign. After a student has completed these
tasks, he/she may then begin to publicize and
introduce him/herself to campus through fliers
and announcements. Then, on election day,
the student body has the chance to choose
the president and board members whom
it feels will work diligently on its behalf.

One of the most important functions of
SGB is the allocation of student activity fee
funds to deserving organizations. Occasionally,

100

Todd Brandon Morris campaigns for 5 GB presidency in 2004.

SGB will have open—mic opportunities to allow
students to voice their opinions on important
campus issues. Through the involvement

of its members and students across campus,
SGB continues to succeed in its goal of
representing the needs of the undergraduate
student body.

BROTHER

reek life at the University of Pittsburgh

gives students a chance to connect

with one another in a setting unlike
any other on campus. Pitt hosts 16 fraternities,
1 1 sororities, seven African American fraternities,
and one multicultural fraternity. The purpose
of the Greek system is to involve all its members
in the basic principles of leadership, scholarship,
and philanthropy.

Students enjoy social activities and are also
committed to charitable efforts. While individual
chapters have their own charities, the overarching
charity for all the fraternities and sororities on
Pitt's campus is the Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric
AIDS Foundation. Each year, brothers and sisters
attend Greek Week events that raise money for
this foundation. During the Brother/Sister Auction
of 2004, Hall Bernstein from Alpha Epsilon Phi
auctioned off 2005 season basketball tickets
to the brothers of Phi Kappa Theta. Later in the
show, a brother from Pi Kappa Alpha walked
out to the song "Take Me Home Tonight" before
the sisters of Delta Delta Delta placed their bids.

S & SISTERS

Sororities and fraternities at Pitt also coordinate
their own fundraisers for their individual charities.
In October 2004, Chi Omega paired up with
Lambda Chi Alpha to organize a Greek dodgeball
tournament. Eight fraternities and six sororities
came out to show their support, helping to
raise $700 for the Make—A—Wish Foundation.

Greek life is a strong tradition at the
University of Pittsburgh. In 2004, Delta Tau Delta
fraternity celebrated its 100th anniversary
at Pitt. Alpha Epsilon Phi sorority celebrated
the 95th anniversary of its national founding
on October 24, 2004.

Greek life at the University of Pittsburgh is
proud to boast longstanding student involvement,
scholarly achievement, philanthropic activities,
and strong traditions.

The main goal of the organization is to
take action. As 2004-05 Vice President Charis
Jones explained, the action is "polltical, social,
cultural, and academic, on the personal, Pitt,
and planetary level."

The theme for the 2004-05 school year was
Emerging to Empower. In September 2004, the
organization gathered on the William Pitt Union
patio for its l<ick—off event, Sankofa. A rally that
aimed to unite the community, Sankofa was
dedicated to empowering people for change
in the Black community.

It is a tradition for the society to organize a
dating game to promote campus interest in the
University's homecoming. BAS is also credited
with bringing many respectable and well—known
speakers to Pitt, such as rap star Talib Kweli and
former director of the NAACP National Youth,
College, & Young Adult Division Jeffrey Johnson.

BAS has a long legacy at Pitt, and it is
a strong organization that encourages students
to be proud, to be powerful, and most
importantly, to be heard.

and taking tests. It is a place where young

adults develop themselves in a variety
of ways. One of the ways that people can learn
about themselves and also contribute to others
is by volunteering. Student Volunteer Outreach
(SVO) is an organization that helps foster
the desire to volunteer by developing and
supporting community service programs within
the Pittsburgh area.

Students can become involved in one—time

service projects, such as helping the Greater
Pittsburgh Community Food Bank stock its

warehouse or serving a Christmas meal with
the Salvation Army. Students also have helped
decorate houses for those who cannot do it
themselves and have assisted with a Santa's
workshop. Students who can volunteer more
of their time participate in ongoing service,
projects as tutors and mentors or with such
diverse organizations as the Animal Rescue
League or the East End Cooperative Ministry.

SVO also offers international service—learning
programs in which academics and service are
combined. Students can take a course studying
cross—cultural issues and then travel to a foreign
country to see firsthand what they have learned.
Students on these trips also can use their
newfound knowledge to offer services and
assistance to the people in the country
they are visiting.

SVO creates many meaningful experiences
through its projects where students learn about
themselves, discover different people and places,
and meet a need by donating time and energy.

Visiting the local laundromat

 

Students used the extra space in their apartment to play around
a poker table.

LIFE ON THE EDGE

rocery shopping, cooking, cleaning,

paying bills, dealing with landlords,

and trips to the laundromat are some
of the tasks faced by students who live off
campus. Students at the University of Pittsburgh
choose neighborhoods such as North Oakland,
South Oakland, Squirrel Hill, Shadyside, and
the South Side for apartment living because
of their proximity to campus as well as the
different atmosphere they offer.

When students first move out of campus
housing, they face the challenge of acquiring
the necessary skills to live on their own.

Jillian Thornton, a senior currently living on
South Bouquet Street, says, ''I love being able
to come and go as I please and do whatever I
want without an RA or swiping a card. But I do
miss the conveniences of living on campus, like
living right next to a cafeteria and computer lab."

108

One of the exciting parts of moving off
campus is buying furniture. Thanks to popular
shows such as /n a Fix, Trading Spaces, and
While You Were Out, interior decorating has
become an experience that many first—time
apartment dwellers look forward to. Students
creatively find ideas and materials to decorate
on a budget.

While there is greater responsibility that
comes with living in an apartment, there are
many advantages. Pitt students enjoy having
friends over to socialize, sit on porches, or
grill when the weather permits. Apartment
living is another way that being at Pitt prepares
students for life after graduation.

Passing out free hot ’choco/ate

EVERYDAY
KINDNESS

ollege can be a stressful time. Exams,

papers, and schoolwork inevitably take

their toll. However, students do not have
to cope with the challenges of college life alone
because they have each other as a support system
to get through the tough times.

The Random Acts of Kindness (RAK) Club,
formed by two students in 2003, incorporates
good cheer into the daily lives of students on
campus through service work and gestures of
goodwill. This means passing out candy to
students waiting in line to vote, handing out
Smarties in Hillman Library during the rigors of
finals week, and distributing hot chocolate in
the Quad on cold nights. Special events chair

in 2004-05 and club cofounder Jamie Davis
also recalls making good luck charms for students
for Friday the 13th, valentines on Valentine's
Day, and cookies for the dorm security guards.
According to Davis, the goal of the group is

to "promote and spread kindness to the Pitt-
community, including more than just the
students." Accordingly, the club also takes time
to volunteer at soup kitchens, blood drives,
and tutoring programs that help people
beyond the borders of Pitt's campus. The organiz-
ation also plans to hold two Kindness Weeks
every year, with varied activities to promote
goodwill each day.

The Random Acts of Kindness Club
welcomes the participation of any interested
student who wants to get out the message
that all people are deserving of a little kindness
in their everyday lives.

CREATIVITY ON CAMPUS

fyou are a student with a passion for writing
news stories, producing a television series,
or working at a radio station, then the fourth
floor of the William Pitt Union is the place for you.
Pitt's finest journalists can be found in the
offices of The Pitt News. This is where meetings
take place for writers to choose stories to cover
for the week. The newspaper itself can be viewed

student radio station, plays mostly bands from
independent labels that are often unknown or
underground. The working environment is upbeat
and full of energy, with students often bonding
over bands they like or discovering new ones.

Finally, in the office of the Panther Prints
memory book, students work hard to provide
a way for others to look back and reflect on
their years and memories at Pitt.

With all these media outlets, the union's
fourth floor bustles with students’ creativity,
commitment, and contribution to student life
——something that is rewarding for the staffs
of these organizations, as well as the students
who read, hear, and enjoy the fruits of this labor.

a sea of red, white, blue, and gold.

The 2004 presidential election kept the
campus in constant political debate. In the spring
of 2004, the Students for Political Opportunity
and the College Democrats worked with the
Kerry campaign to bring presidential candidate
John F. Kerry, along with various celebrities and
political figures, to Pitt. The Kerry rally was so
well attended that not everyone could fit on

the presidential debates, students sat together
on the William Pitt Union lawn to watch the
televised programs, which were projected onto
a large screen.

The political groups on campus did everything
from distributing campaign posters to protesting,
with the ultimate goal of encouraging students
to register to vote. Their efforts seemed to be
successful on November 2, when hundreds of
students waited in long lines at the polling
places to cast their vote.

JAZZ IT UP!

Osacr Brashear

he University of Pittsburgh Jazz Seminar

& Concert was the first large—sca|e

academic seminar to bring together
internationally known performers from across
the globe to perform in concert. Originally
established in 1970, the Pitt Jazz Seminar
& Concert series celebrated its 34th year of
bringing the brightest stars of jazz onto the
University campus in fall 2004. Part of what
keeps the seminar and concert alive is the
enthusiasm and participation of Pitt students.
Michelle Summers, a senior at Pitt, took Nathan
Davis’ Introduction to Jazz course her freshman
year. ''I enjoyed it, and I've been coming back
to the concert every year since," she said.

The 2004 concert included such renowned
musicians as alto saxophonist Donald Harrison
of the Terence Blanchard/Donald Harrison Duo,
who made his Pitt Jazz Concert debut, and
tenor and soprano saxophonist Nathan Davis,
the founder and director of the jazz program at
Pitt. On piano was Patrice Rushen, who received
the 2004 Jazz Seminar & Concert Committee

Award for her achievements in the jazz industry.

116

Passion for jazz in the Pitt community

is furthered demonstrated by the International
Academy of Jazz Hall of Fame, located in the
William Pitt Union. The Hall of Fame is a tribute
to the greatest jazz musicians of all time,
featuring artifacts from the lives of Clark Terry,
Miles Davis, and Kenny Clarke, among others.
Founded in 1977, the Hall of Fame remains

a valuable asset to the University, containing
original scores and instruments that are American
cultural treasures. The Jazz Seminar & Concert
is one of the many ways that Pitt is a leader

in the world of jazz.

in film or television?" cover the bulletin

boards all over campus, advertising one
of the University's newest student organizations,
Pitt in Hollywood.

Patrick Sutton, founder of Pitt in Hollywood,
along with Jonathan Wayne, a 2002 Pitt
graduate, created the club and Web site in
the summer of 2002 as a vast networking
device for students, alumni from Pitt and
Carnegie Mellon University, and Pittsburgh
natives interested in film studies. The Web site
is a way for members to get in touch with people
in Los Angeles and New York City who have a
connection to Pittsburgh and are involved in film.

Pitt in Hollywood also aims to bring actors,
directors, and producers to speak to students
interested in film studies. The club's first activity
was October 31, 2002: the Night of the Living
Dead Producers Event. After a viewing of the

film, students were given the opportunity to
participate in a discussion with the producers
and the screenwriter.
Not only does the club bring in professionals

but it boasts a renowned faculty advisor,

Carl Kurlander, best known for his screen-
writing abilities. He wrote the television series
Saved by the Be// and the film St. E/mos Fire.

Since Pitt in Hollywood's first event, the club

has featured guests ranging from MTV and
Warner Brothers producers and top Hollywood
managers to writers and actors from NBC and
CBS. This helps students who are interested in
film studies, and it brings some of Hollywood's
glitz and glamour to campus.

GOODBYE
FOR NOW

ven after eight months at school, the end

of the spring semester sneaks up on

students at the University of Pittsburgh.
All of a sudden, it is the last week of classes,
which means that it is time to study for finals
and finish writing papers that have been put
off until now. When the last bubbles on the
scantron sheets are filled in, it is time to sell
back the textbooks and pack to go home for
the summer. For some students, this means
folding clothes neatly and placing them in
suitcases, while other students opt for the less
conventional method of piling everything into

garbage bags and cardboard boxes. After the
packing is done, it is time for the final farewell
to friends.

There are many different things in store for
Pitt students over the summer. Some students
enroll in classes, some get jobs at home, and
others choose to live at the beach with friends.
For seniors, it is time for graduation and taking
that next step in life.

For the first few years of college, the arrival
of summer meant that students might not see
their Pitt friends for four months. With graduation
comes a goodbye that is more final than in
previous years.

Regardless of what their plans for the
summer include, students at the University
of Pittsburgh all share in the same bittersweet
rituals of saying goodbye to friends at the end
of another spring semester.

ON THE JOB

hile attending classes full time,

many students at the University

of Pittsburgh also choose to work
in part—time jobs. Erin Moore, a senior who
works as a house manager for the William Pitt
Union, says that she likes to work on campus
because of the excitement and activity of all
the people within the University.

Pitt has many work—study programs for
students who qualify. Jumpstart, a national
nonprofit early education organization, employs
many work—study students. In the 2004-05
school year, 2,100 college students, known
in Jumpstart as corps members, acted as com-

panions and mentors to 7,875 preschool children.

Some other students find that working
in the retail industry really pays off. Rachael
Hirshenhorn, a sophomore who works at Express
in Shadyside, says ''I do all of my shopping
at Express, so it makes sense to work there,
especially since I get an employee discount!"

122

Still other students prefer to work at restaurants
in areas such as Shadyside, Market Square, and

The Waterfront. "| make more money and work
fewer hours than I would if I worked another job,"
says Dave Douglass, a junior who works as

a waiter at Rock Bottom.

Not only do part—time jobs give students
the chance to improve their time—management
skills, these jobs also provide spending money
that can pay for books or special things like
spring break trips. Working during college
also helps prepare students for their next stage
of life, giving them references for résumés
as well as experience for a future job.

LETTER

FROM THE SGB PRESIDENT

ongratulations to the Class of 2005!

It has been my pleasure to serve you

as Student Government Board (SGB)
president. During the past four years I have been
constantly amazed at the high level of achieve-
ment of Pitt students. If our work over the past
four years is any indication of what our class
will contribute in the future, I have no doubt
that we will exceed all expectations.

This SGB has worked arduously to make
Pitt's campus a better place for all students. We
started a new Traditions Committee, which has
organized programs such as Panther Pride,
Campus Wide, and the Panther Prowl. We
raised the amount of money that SGB is
able to distribute and worked with student
organizations so that they can achieve their
full potential. Along with many other projects,
SGB’s overarching goal has been to promote
the ideals of service, leadership, and Pitt pride.

I feel confident that the board has successfully
reached out to the Pitt community in a multitude
of ways.

University of Pittsburgh 0

The successes in my term could have not
been achieved without the support of Chancellor
Mark A. Nordenberg, Vice Provost and Dean
of Students Jack L. Daniel, SGB Adviser Joyce
Giangarlo, SGB Secretary Donna Mihalik, all eight
board members, and the students who contributed
countless hours of work to the 11 committees
of SGB. l have been honored to work with such
dedicated students, staff, and administration,
and I eagerly await the future accomplishments
of the Class of 2005. The sky truly is the limit.

Hail to Pitt!

2004 Nobel Peace Prize
for her ”holistic
approach to sustain-
able development that
embraces democracy,
human rights, and
women's rights in particular” in her native
Kenya, she reinforced the University's tradition
of excellence. She has elevated the stature
and prestige of every Pitt graduate’s degree.
In fact, as Chancellor Mark A. Nordenberg
has said, "Many of the University's greatest
accomplishments come through the life's
work of our alumni.”

We, the alumni, are really the torchbearers

of the Pitt spirit. Some of our traditions
are well established. The annual ceremony
known as Lantern Night was performed

Other events are new but promise to be

made possible in part by the Pitt Alumni
Association.
