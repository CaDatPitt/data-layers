the Future
A lthough the year was bound by
       aspirations for the future, it was
 by no means static. Perhaps the Univer sity's situation is best stated by Presi dent Wesley Posvar: "We chart the
 future, building upon the past; progress
 is the essence of the University. We are
 the heirs of millennia and the pro genitors of change." In accordance with
 this philosophy, the University of Pitt sburgh is now entering its stage as the
 "Campus of the Future." Progress is ac celerating as Pitt modernizes its ad ministrative and academic computing
 and telecommunications system. This
 network will permit voice, data, and
 video images to be accessible from all
 areas of the campus. Students will be
 able to enter the main computers from
 their dorm rooms and receive informa tion from any system throughout the
 University.
   Also included in the project are plans
 for an integrated voice and data Private
 Branch Exchange. This will modify the
 present phone system, allowing for
 much more flexible services on the
 Touch-tone system. Skeptics may ques tion why Pitt was chosen for such a
 comprehensive undertaking. For one,
 the campus is located in the third
 largest corporate  headquarters in
 America and provides an opportunity
 to experiment with a variety of applica tions. Secondly, nearly every university
 department, ranging from English to
 engineering, will benefit from this
 computer technology.
 Campus life no doubt will experience
 major changes in the immediate future,
 yet for the present, the University of
 Pittsburgh  is patiently   waiting
backstage, behind the scene, for that
curtain guarding the future to open.

I t's one o'clock in the afternoon and
  you've just sat through three hours
  of classes. The temperature in the
Cathedral is somewhere between hot
and miserable and it's taking every bit

on your professors. This is the type of
weather that brings the Cathedral lawn
alive. Give a college student the chance
to take off their clothes and flaunt their

Whether they're studying, tanning or
just enjoying a little bit of mother

  What other organization has brought
more excitement and spirit to Pitt fans
than the Pitt band? Not only do they
provide entertainment on the field but
before the games as well. Small pep
bands are a common sight on the streets
of Oakland before a home game. The
band can also be found exhibiting their
school spirit at the Fitzgerald Field
House during basketball season. With
one week of intensive practice at Pitt's
Johnstown   campus before    football
season, the band prepares pre-game
and halftime entertainment for all of
the Panther fans. Two music fraternities, Iota Beta Kappa, an honorary coed fraternity, and Mu Kappa Upsilon,
an all male fraternity, and one sorority,
Omicron Pi Alpha, are all affiliated
with the band. "Friends made in band,"
according to one IBK pledge, "remain

T he tiny academy lying deep in the
     forests of Western Pennsylvania
opened its doors as an institution of
higher learning in 1787. Called the Pittsburgh Academy, it expanded, moved
and was proceeded by the Western
University of Pennsylvania in 1819. Today in its present home of Oakland, the
University of Pittsburgh is preparing to
celebrate its Bicentennial in 1987. As
Pitt proudly inaugurates its next century, the nation as a whole will also be
celebrating the 200th anniversary of
the ratification of the U.S. Constitution.
President Wesley Posvar hopes to incorporate this fact in the activities planned for the 1986-87 academic year.
  In preparation for the bicentennial
celebration, University  committees
have adopted an official symbol taken
     Celebrating
                       Two
S         Centuries
  of Excellence
  from the design used in the University
  Medal. Working behind the scenes, the
  members of the ad hoc bicentennial
  committee have decided    that the
  celebration theme should be a serious
  one, focusing on the direction of the
  University in its third century. In an ef  fort to attract a nationwide audience to
  this spectacular event, President Posvar
  has announced that the 52-member
Association of American Universities
will hold its annual gathering of its
members' presidents here in Pittsburgh
in 1987.

            ORGANIZATIONS
  The   organization    on  campus
representing every student is the Student Government Board. SGB serves as
a link between students and the administration. Many activities, committees and councils are sponsored by SGB
such as the Freshman Council. This
council is intended to orient freshmen
to the Student government and promote more involvement. Another project sponsored by SGB was the letterwriting   campaign    during   which
students were asked to write to their
Representatives about student aid cuts.
SGB's main responsibility is budgeting
the 360,00 dollars worth of student activity fees to student organizations.
Many other committees work through
SGB that aid students and organizations
in specific areas, and SGB helps coordinate them all.
  The Governmental Relations Board is
a group of students which lobbies for
the basic concerns of students. Time is
spent in Harrisburg and Washington,
D.C. visiting Senators and Representatives to inform them about student
situations. Major issues the board deals
with are quite diverse. Tuition raises
and aid cuts are high on the list but
much time is also devoted to stopping
the closing of the Port Authority Transit busing system. A great number of
Pitt commuters depend on PAT buses
and losing PAT could have a drastic effect on the University as a whole. The
board deals with many important issues
of concern to the student population
and does a great service to us all in voicing   our  opinions   in  matters  of
importance.

  The Allocations Committee is an integral part of Student Government.
They are a group of students who are
selected by SGB to help allocate the
$300,000 worth of student activity fees
to student organizations. Starting in
January, they review each organization's budget, then vote on all things
requested. They have the option to
deny, or approve any requests, or to put
money into an escrow fund. Then the
chairman of the Allocations Committee
presents the budgets to SGB, who have
the final say on what money goes
where. Such is the process of where all
the Pitt student's activities money goes.

S.G.B. ELECTIONS 1984
  Election year 1984: the general consensus was that a wave of patriotism
was sweeping the country when it
came time to elect America's next President. On the whole, Americans entered
the polling places with a sense of national contentment which had been absent for years. There was a renewed
feeling of pride for our country which
was beginning to regain its prominent
world position. As a result, Ronald
Wilson Reagan was elected to a second
term by a history-making majority,
greatly  comprised  of college-aged
Americans.
  This increased   political interest
among students which was stirred by
the national election carried into the
1984 Pitt Student Government Board
elections. The students were, in
general, well-informed and concerned.
The candidates for SGB had to be aware
of this new politically-enlightened student populous in order to put it to their
advantage.
  Consequently, the various SGB candidates began getting organized weeks
before the election. Getting publicized
was the first task at hand. As former
Board President Ken Stram pointed out,
because of the number of unusually
well-qualified candidates, originality
was very important in getting one's
name noticed. Bright posters with
catchy slogans cluttered virtually every
classroom on campus.
  After the posters were hung, the next
step in the campaign was the endorsement hearings. Just as the national
presidential candidates find      it
beneficial to be endorsed by unions and
other national organizations, the SGB
candidates must be interviewed by
various campus organizations for the
purpose of endorsement. Those who
gain an endorsement receive a great
deal of valuable publicity.
  As the elections drew closer, the emphasis for the candidates shifted to "being seen." During this period, the student body was inundated with leaflets
giving brief information about the candidates. The   candidates also  participated in a practice called "dorm
storming" in which they go door to
door throughout the residence halls.
This is very important if the candidates
wish to be recognized by the voting
students.
  However, the most important feature
of the SGB campaign was the Meet the
Candidates evenings. These sessions
were essential for the student to
become more informed about the candidates. The first session was held in
the William    Pitt Ballroom. Here,
students listened to the candidates'
speeches and were permitted to ask
questions. The second   session was
presented over Pitt's new radio station,
WPTS. This broadcast differed from the
first presentation in that the presidential candidates were allowed to ask
questions of each other. Because ol
these Meet the Candidates evenings
the students were able to get a cleaj
perception of each candidate's platforrr
and qualifications.
  After all the intense campaigninF
was over, the polling places wern
established and it was time for the elec
tion. Unlike the land-slide nationa
election, 1984 produced one of Pitt'!
closest SGB elections ever. However
the close security over the ballotinj
assured all candidates that the electior
was indeed a fair one. The final vote
tally pronounced Luke Kluchko the vic
tor in the presidential race by onl!
sixty-nine votes over runner-up Bol
Kramer. The slim margin reflected th,
fact that all candidates seemed to repre
sent the Student Body's desire fo
dedicated and experienced leaders.
  This need for continuity and stabilit.
exemplifies the mood which prevaile(
across the nation at that time. The sam,
down to earth personality and politica
experience  which   enabled   Ronal(
Reagan to be re-elected in 1984 provid
ed the surge Luke Kluchko needed t,
become Pitt's next SGB president.

  Pittsburgh has often been referred to
as a "melting pot" and rightly so. The
variety of ethnic cultures found in Pittsburgh are symbolized in the 19 Nationality Rooms found in the Cathedral
of Learning. Quo Vadis, the Latin
words for "whither goest thou," is an
organization of students trained to
guide tours through      these  rooms.
Members of Quo Vadis interact much
like members of a fraternity with such
events as an annual banquet and initiation ceremony for new members.
One of the highlights of this year
was an excursion to Washington,
D.C. During this trip, the Smithsonian Institute provided Quo Vadis
with a one day class on guiding
techniques. A tour of the Greek embassy and a visit to Chinatown were
also outstanding attractions of the
trip.

BEHIND THE SCENES
  Poised to enter its third century, the
University underwent several academic
reformations this year as designated by
the Five Year Plan. When first introduced, this plan caused quite a
disturbance among students, particularly those belonging to the Pharmacy
School and the Graduate School of International Affairs. However, when the
final recommendations were released,
both schools remained intact in lieu of
a few budget and faculty alterations.
Thus the plans are drawn, the foundations laid and the stage is set for a
momentous third century.

  The organization Pi Sigma Alpha is
an honor society for political science
students. 1984-85 marked the year Pi
Sigma Alpha became active at Pitt again
after an absence of a number of years.
The society encourages intellectual
discussions on current political events
and happenings. Speakers are invited
to meetings to stimulate new topics of
discussion and bring in fresh perspectives. The organization is also a great
supplement to any political science
course.

DORM LIFE MADE
  The Resident Student Association is
an organization which plans activities
and takes actions to improve life in the
residence halls. Many fun and exciting
activities took place this year. Students
spent a fun-filled  evening  at the
Meadows, roller skated the quad, and
had a good scare in the RSA haunted
house. Besides sponsoring entertaining
activities, RSA provided many services
to the student body. Refrigerator rentals and blood drives were included on
the long list of RSA responsibilities.
The RSA acts on behalf of all resident
students in any matter which might affect the quality of residence life.

           PITT'S OLDEST ORGANIZATION
                              The Pitt Men's Glee Club is the oldest
                              extracurricular organization  at the
                              University of Pittsburgh and  was
                              founded in 1890 as the "Mandolin and
                              Bongo Club" by twelve students. The
                            Glee Club soon expanded to over 50
                            members until a few years ago, when
                            the Club was almost extinct.
                              But by hard work and long hours the
                            Glee Club is once again alive and well.
                            The Club includes 20 undergraduates
                            and graduates in law, business, liberal
                            arts, engineering, medicine, dentistry,
                            and others.
                              The Glee Club sings a wide variety of
                            music with several selections arranged
                            specifically for it. The programs vary to
                            fit the tastes of the audience but always
                            consist of the finest music available for
                            men's voices. A typical program would
                            consist of compositions of classical com                            posers such as Bach and Mendelssohn,
                            folk songs, spirituals, and novelties.

                                four Glee Club members who call
                                themselves the Pitt Tunes. This year
                                they were Matt Varhola, Bob Hoover,
                                Gary Jones, and Joe Kuzma. These four
                                endeavor to bring to the audience
                                popular and humorous songs as well as
                                barbershop harmony. Another group of
                                Glee Clubbers is called the Class Act.
                                This talented group sings a wide varie                                ty of music which ranges from folk
                                songs to contemporary music. The

CHAPEL VOICES
   More goes on in the Heinz Chapel
besides Sunday services and weddings.
It is also the home of the Heinz Chapel
Choir. The choir performs a diverse
selection of music, from classical to
spirituals. They practice twice a week
and give three annual concerts - a
spring, fall, and Christmas concert.
They give three performances of their
Christmas concert in the chapel, but are
also found caroling around Pittsburgh
in  such   areas such   as Oakland,
Shadyside, and downtown at Kaufmanns and Gimbels.
  The direction of the choir was taken
over by Herbert Jones, a graduate student currently working on his doctorate, at the beginning of the 1985
winter term. The choir is planning a 6week tour of Europe next year to further establish Pitt's name throughout
the world.

  The Women's Choral Ensemble is
one of Pitt's enduring organizations.
They give a minimum of three concerts
a year on campus, as well as several
concerts throughout the community.
This year, among other projects, W.C.E.
performed in a joint concert with the
Pitt Men's Glee Club   and  gave a
Christmas  concert at St. Francis
Hospital in Oakland.
  The Women's Choral Ensemble has
been relatively small for the last few
years, but they are now starting to grow
again with the addition of several new
members this year.

   Since its inception in the late 1960's,
 the Jazz Ensemble has come to enjoy
 great popularity not only in the Pitts burgh area, but also with jazz fans
 throughout the world. Throughout its
 almost fifteen years of existence, the
 band has cut several albums, given
 numerous concerts at the University,
 and performed with such noted jazz ar tists as Herbie Mann, James Moody, Joe
 Negri, and Donald Byrd. This year the
 Jazz Ensemble plans to go to Jamaica

  The Studio Theater is a creative club

basement of the Cathedral of Learning.
Any Pitt student or member of the community can become a member by being
actively involved in a play. This year
they performed "Jessie and the Bandit
Queen," "The Maids," "Tartuffe," and
"Tommy," an experimental production
performed entirely in American Sign
Language.
  Their plans for next year include
"lawn drama" - one act skits on the

  Can you imagine campus life without
  weekend   movies, homecoming
  festivities, lecturers, and  concerts?
These are just a few of the activities that
the Pitt Program Council is responsible
for, and life at Pitt without them would
be dull indeed. PPC is the central programming organization at Pitt which
designs educational, cultural, recreational, and social events, keeping in
mind all the broad and varied interests
of the university community.
  PPC provided 435 performances of
233 different programs, reaching a total
audience of about 100,000 people this
year. As you can imagine, organizing
all these programs, from selling tickets
to putting up posters, takes a lot of
work and a lot of people. PPC is comprised of 12 programming committees
and has an active membership of 200
people, and is always looking for more
members. So if you've ever wondered
who was behind a lot of the entertainment provided for you throughout the
year, now you know that it is courtesy
of PPC.

   Panther Prints
   The 1985 Panther Prints yearbook
 staff, like any organization on Pitt's
 campus, strives to get the best people
 involved in an activity they can excel at
 and enjoy. This year's staff was made
 up of almost all new recruits. This made
 the first few months rough, but turned
 out rather beneficial in the end.
 Who would have thought way back
 in October as David told us about
 graphics that by April we would be
 screaming through all-nighters in the
 office! Whether the staff was giving
 away posters to vulturous freshmen
 eager to decorate their dorm rooms, or
 trying to get bashful seniors to sign up
 for their portraits, the bulk of the year book staff did their jobs with
 enthusiasm.

  There have been quite a few changes
on the fourth floor of the union since
last year, and one of them was the radio
station, WPTS. Pitt's station, now on
the air for 24 hours a day, can be heard
for an 18 mile radius around Oakland.
It's music format is varied enough to fit
anyone's tastes, from phone-in requests
Monday through Thursday, to a jazz
show every night, to classical music
and oldies every Sunday.
  There are about 50 people on the
staff, and always room for more. An excellent opportunity for any student, he
can pick the field he wants and then be
trained in it. One can choose from
engineering, production, or being a
music or news D.J.
  And if you hang around Oakland in
the evenings for any length of time,
you will be sure to see the WPTS crew
setting up a "remote" in one of the
area's hotspots -    C. J. Barney's,
Thirsty's, and Caleco's are a few.
  Life on a university campus is fastpaced and changing - nothing stays

radio station!

  It is one of the most influential and
controversial publications to be found
on the Pitt campus. Not only on the Pitt
campus, but in the whole western half
of the state - it has the third largest
circulation, behind only the Pittsburgh
Press and the Post-Gazette. Students read
the Pitt News three times a week to find
out all the campus news as well as what
is happening around the world. They
read it for the sports coverage, the
classifieds, and for Showcase, the entertainment magazine found in every Friday's issue.
  Being on the staff of the Pitt News is a
great opportunity for any student majoring  in  journalism, photography,

They showed video tapes about cruelty
to animals and next year plan to get
speakers and have a rally. Friends of

and beautiful surroundings: skiing! Approximately 600 members belong, and
they  make weekly trips to Seven
Springs, to Showshoe the second week
of March, and an annual trip to Vermont. This year they trekked to Sugarbush right after Christmas and spent
New Year's Eve there. The Ski Club is a
perfect opportunity for anyone who
wants to experience the "great outdoors" and have a lot of fun.

         The Student Science Fiction and Fan       tasy Association is one of the Univer       sity's newer organizations, as it was
       begun just last year. It was organized by
       a small group of students with an ap       preciation for science fiction and fan       tasy and a desire to share this apprecia       tion with other students. This year the
       number of members has more than
       doubled and they engaged in many dif       ferent activities with science fiction
       and fantasy as their theme. Among
       them were: showing the movies Things
       to Come and Logans Run in the assembly
       room of the union, having guest lec       turers at their weekly meetings who
       spoke on such topics as physics and
       science fiction, and the possibility of
       life elsewhere in the universe. They
       also took excursions to science fiction
       movies around Oakland, such as 2010
       and the Rocky Horror Picture Show and
       had several parties with science fiction
       and fantasy as their themes.

                                                 SURVIVING COLLEGE
             Survivors - that's what many men           tors commonly refer to themselves as.
           And survive they did - through an ap           plication, two interviews, a training
           course, workshops, advising sessions,
           and  finally, seeing the  group   of
           students first assigned to them   as
           awkward, uncertain freshmen make it
           through their first year of college and
           come back as experienced sophomores.
             Mentors are the University's best - a
          select group of upperclassmen chosen,
          out of hundreds who apply, for their
          skill, poise, energy, and enthusiasm.
          All of those characteristics are needed
          to guide groups of freshmen through
          craziness such as the world's biggest
          Twister game, the "Official Outdoor
          Mayhem" with Jimmy and Steve of
          WDVE, and     the  world's strangest
          scavenger hunt. These were just a few
          of the activities that were part of the
          orientation program this year, as well
          as seminars on Semester at Sea, Interna          tional Studies, and Why Writing is Im          portant, among others.r
            The mentor program has been at Pitt
          for more than 30 years, and it's no
          wonder. The    mentor program    has
          achieved many goals, not the least of;
          which has been the many close friend          ships that have been formed between
          countless mentors and freshmen. One
          mentor, when asked what she would
          miss most about the program when she
          graduated, replied; "Well, I'll miss
          meeting all the new people, helping,
          having the fun that we have, but most          ly, seeing "my kids" when they're
          older and no longer freshmen, and see          ing how they've changed."

'All in all it was a successful
 season, wins and loss wise," Lady
 Panther Assistant Coach Kirk Bruce
 said, "We have five or six games where
 we lost by a total of 10 points."
 One of those close games was the
 first round Big East Tournament game
 with Syracuse, played    on  the
 Orangewoman's home court in
 Syracuse. Pitt lost that game 65-64.
 "That was a game we could have won,"
 Kirk said, "We definitely had our
 chances in that game, but we just didn't
 do it."

  A surprising year-end development
was the resignation of Head Coach
Judy Saurer. Saurer had just completed
her fifth year as Head Coach of the

move around a lot, but all of us here
were shocked by the news."
  The year was highlighted by Jennifer

Coming at Ya
U    navoidably, the   two   teams
bumped into one another within a six
day  frame, serving  notice of the
Panther's 1985 basketball season. After
the home finale, 85-62 mauling of
Villanova (the soon-to-be National
Champs), a coinflip brought the two
together for the Big East Tournament.
  With the Panther's best finish ever in
the league (8, 8, fifth), surprised
observers quickly pushed aside their
reactions to contemplate Pitt and the
NCAA Tournament which, until that
time had not been synonymous.
  For postseason purposes, the nuances
of thought overshot justification. A

  There were none of the slayings of
the league's top teams as occurred two
years before hand. The Panthers came
close in a January contest against
Georgetown at the Civic Arena. The
score was tied at halftime before the national champions pulled out a 65-53

from Boston College twice and the nationally  televised   game   against
Villanova at the end of the year. The
first win over the Eagles came to be the
most gratifying as the Panthers overcame a 14-point deficit in the second
half at Roberts Center to stun the partisans 61-55. In that game Charles
Smith   set conference and    schools
records with 18 points in 21 throws
from the line. He finished with 26
points and 11 rebounds.

marginally. He shared too much time
with another junior, Matt Miklasevich,

never did get the production he wanted
from any one of them as their combined rebounding scores averaged 9.8 per
game.
  The year was good, however, despite
ending in losses. The season ended on a
good note - an NCAA playoff berth.
The prospects for next year appear promising. With three seniors leaving, the
majority of starters and talent will remain at Pitt. Who knows, maybe next
season the Final Four?

a winning record in the 1984-85 season,
compiling a record of 8-7. The season
was highlighted by wins over top -
ranked Lehigh and Kent State.
  "I was pretty pleased with the performance of our guys," said wrestling
Head Coach Rande Stottlemeyer. "We
got a lot of mileage out of our guts."
  Individual standouts for the Panther
grapplers included Gary Bolin and
John Hnath, both of whom went to the
NCAA nationals held at Oklahoma City, OK last March. Bolin went into the
championship seeded 12th, but lost in
the first round. Hnath was unseeded
going into the tournament, but he won
his first round match only to be
defeated in the second round.
  At the Eastern Wrestling League
Championships Pitt saw four of its
competitors finish third or better. At

  Other Panthers who were among the
  league's elite were Doug Haines, who
finished third at 158 lbs., and Ken
Hackman who finished fourth at 177
lbs.
  One other bright spot for the Panthers was the fact that 3 Pitt Wrestlers
finished the season with 20 or more
wins. Those topping the 20 win plateau
were Bolin, Hnath, and Kyle Nellis.
  In the end for Stottlemeyer, it was a
good, but not a great season. "Going 8-7
is a winning record and I'm happy we
were able to do that. I think, looking
back on the season, the one thing I
notice is that we were able to avenge a
lot of our earlier season losses. We
would get beat by people early on, and
then we would see them at the end of
the year and we would win. That says a
lot about this team and about next year.
We get all our wrestlers back next year,
too."

  One thing Deiffenbach had to be surprised about was the exciting play of
the freshmen. Carrie DeVera, Colleen
Driscall, and Stephanie Nelson were a
trio of frosh players who provided the
difference in many of the Lady Panthers' close  wins throughout the
season.
  Added to that was the steady play of
sophomore Jenny Leach in the number
three singles slot to give the Lady Panthers a solid lineup from top to bottom.
  About the only disappointment the
team suffered all season was their last
place at the Big East Tournament in October. But with a strong team coming
back, Deiffenbach hopes the team will
have many more seasons like'84's.

'Set-up' for Respect
                              t was business, or rather success, as
                              usual for the Pitt women's
                          volleyball team last year. In his fifth
                          season as the Lady Panther boss,
                          volleyball coach Shelton Collier guided
                          the squad to an impressive 30-8 season
                          including an appearance in the NCAA
                          tournament.
                            Collier, however, could not admit he
                          was entirely happy with the past
                          season. "Somehow    coaches always
                          seem to want one more win. But I was
                          happy with what we accomplished," he
                          said. "I think it shows our program is
                          nationally respected and again this past
                          season we were able to show the overall
                          strength of our program."
                            On the court it was a record breaking
                          year for senior spiker Ulana Kohutiak,
                          who set an NCAA record with 40 kills
                          in a single match. Kohutia, was also

  "Ulana's was the finest season by a
volleyball player at Pitt I've ever seen,"
Collier said. But don't get the idea the
Lady Panthers were a one woman team.
Players Cathy Rupp and Kris Wexell
also turned in fine seasons for the team.
  One of the year's high points came
on November 3 when Pitt upset heavily
favored and nationally ranked Penn
State 15-11,17-15, 15-13. That victory
over Penn State also clinched the Pitt
Classic Volleyball Tournament.
  Pitt was not so fortunate in the
NCAA     tournament. They      were
defeated  by   national powerhouse
Nebraska in the first round.

    he Pitt Panther soccer team had a
      very respectable season record of
9-6-1 in 1984, Head Coach Luxbacher's
first as soccer boss.
  The biggest problem the team had
was their ability, or lack of ability, to
score goals. The most points the Panthers scored all year was five in one
game. That high water mark came
against IUP during Pitt's 5-2 victory
over the Big Indians in October.
  What kept the Panthers on the good
side of the Wins-Losses column was a
strong defense, where they were led by
a veteran crew of backfield players including Uzoma Chibundu, a senior
from Lagos, Nigeria, and junior Brian
Casey.
  On   offense the Panthers were
powered by Rick Burkholder and Victor
Hugo who did most of the scoring for
the squad in 1984.

Brown.
       Heon Takes
       Her Fourth
 T hings did not turn out exactly as
     Sue Heon had hoped, but her performance in the 1984 Los Angeles
Olympics gives us all much of which to
be proud. Sue finished fourth in the
400 individual medley which is an
achievement in itself.
  Sue, a Clark's Summit, PA native, and
three year All-American here at Pitt,
returned to school this fall with a new
goal in mind: becoming a four year
All-American. This accomplishment
would place her in some pretty impressive company including    Hugh
Green and Tony Dorsett. Well, now her
name can be added to this list.
  In the words of swim coach David
Belowich, "It takes a rare individual to
devote themselves as she has." It's an
individual such as Sue Heon that gives
the University of Pittsburgh sports
their continued success and prestige.

 T   he Pitt men's swimming team was
     8-2 during the 1984-85 season. But
that wasn't the best part of their very successful season.
  The height of last year's campaign was
the victory that took place in Trees Pool
February 27 through March 2 - the Big
East Championship. The Pitt men won the
event convincingly 693-604, and Richard
James was named Outstanding Coach.
  "I think it was a very successful season                                                   "
for us this year," Lewis said. "It was a
rebuilding year, but we were able to have
a successful season mainly because the
freshmen  performed   like seasoned
veterans."
  Freshmen Lewis named as standouts included Charles Lurch, Geoff Rife, and Rob
Reddy.
  "It wasn't the highlight of our season to
win the Big East or Eastern Regionals. I
don't think there was one match that I
could pick out and say that was a
highlight," Lewis commented. "I think
the best part of this season was the attitude of the entire team. The way we all
pulled together and worked hard."                                                               A..

Lady Panthers Just Miss
T he Pitt women's gymnastics team
      finished the season at 10-6 in
      1984-85, including a  second
place finish at the James Madison Invitational in Virginia.
  Head Coach Donna Sanft's club took
a fourth place finish at the Northeast
Regional Championships held at Pitt
on March 30, 1985.
  The Pitt team last season was a mixture of veterans and newcomers, both
working together to give Pitt another
winning team.
  Sophomore Alisa Spector was Pitt's
highest finisher at the Regional Championships, with a 13th place finish.
Katie Monoghan was 16th overall in
that tournament.
  In a November exhibition meet with
a team of Japanese Collegiate All-stars,
the Lady Panthers narrowly missed
upsetting the visitors, losing only
144.45-144.20.
  One of the biggest disappointments
of the'84-'85 campaign was the injury
to team captain and senior Debbie
Dabkowski. She was knocked out of action with a leg injury early in the year
and was unable to return - as a player
that is. Debbie still was around to help
and to cheer her fellow teammates on
throughout the season.

                                        t was a year marked by injury for
                                        the men's gymnastics team    in
                                        1984-85. One wonders how good
                                    coach Frank D'Amico's team could have
                                    been if the gymnasts would have
                                    stayed healthy.
                                      D'Amico guided the squad to an
                                    overall mark of 8-7. Not bad consider                                    ing the team's youth and injuries.
                                      The Panthers' first meet of any kind
                                    was an exhibition meet with a team
                                    from Japan on Nov. 30. The Panthers
                                    lost to the Japanese All-Stars by a score
                                    of 229.20-220.90. The Panthers opened
                                    the regular season with a second place
                                    finish in a tri-team meet in Chicago in

Running for Records
S ix school records were set by the
    men's indoor track team in 1985.
That feat on any team is impressive, but
considering it was accomplished by a
Pitt team with only one senior and one
junior and  the  rest of the  team
freshmen and sophomores... well, it is
amazing.
  "We had a very young team," Head
track Coach John Vasvary said. "Almost
no recruiting was done so we really
were wondering what kind of a year we
would have."
  One thing he was sure of was the
talent in freshman Lee McRae. McRae
was an All-American, a rarity for a
freshman. Not only did he make AllASSISTANT COACH STEVE LEWIS checks and
records a runner's time.
A GRIN AND A GESTURE are the trademark of
George Ifill.
American status, but he finished sixth
against some of the top track talent in
the nation in the 55 meter dash at the
NCAAs.
  "McRae really didn't surprise us; we
knew what he could do coming into the
season, and we have been very pleased
with the way he has performed for us,"
Vasvary said.
  McRae was also one of five Panthers
named to NCAA Conference team. The
others were Tim Maines, Alan Lewis,
Scott Abel, and Bob Weiner. At the
NCAA meet the Panthers finished 12th
out of what Vasvary said were about
100 other schools.

home   opener against Brigham
Young - undefeated and eventual

really didn't matter. With an injured
Congemi on     the sidelines, the
Cougars welcomed the Panthers to a
new season when they waited until
less than two minutes left to win 2014 on a Robbie Bosco-Adam Haysbert
touchdown connection.
  Many will agree the persistent

befell the Panthers, who turned in
such hear-wrenching defeats as 1312  to  Temple, 45-21 to    South
Carolina, 13-7 to Syracuse, and the
28-all tie against Navy, who were
Napoleon McCallum-less that day.
Fazio, injuries and ineffectiveness
forcing his hand, switched quarterbacks at an alarming frequency. With
Congemi out most of the year,
finishing with a 53.4 percent completion rate, and 1,102 yards, Mt.
Lebanon native Chris Jelic filled in,
passing for only 480 yards. Another
passer, John Cummings, had his

  Similarly, the wide outs were affected. Senior Bill Wallace, a split end
coming off a fabulous season, did haul
in 43 passes for a 14.2 yard average, but
his only    big  day  came   against
Oklahoma (42-10 loss) when his nine
catches totaled 135 yards. Sophomore
Chuck Scales did surprisingly well as
flanker, considering he abruptly moved

against South   Carolina in  October.
That, it might be noted, was perhaps

President of the University of Pittsburgh since 1967 and he has come to
identify himself with Pitt. Says Posvar, "I take it personally if we lose a
football game or a basketball game."
His days begin early and include interviews, meetings, business luncheons, and numerous phone calls. He
seldom returns to his home before
7:00 PM, but once there he likes to
relax. However, this does not mean
he stops thinking about his job as
President of the University because
he is "usually engaged in being that."
  Posvar has seen a change in the
student body since the early 70's. He
feels that today's students are more
mature and    serious about their
education and are better prepared for
future jobs. This is an extension of
what Dr. Posvar hopes students have
gained when they graduate from
Pitt, "I would like students to leave
with a sense of appreciation and
achievement.. and better equipped
for life." Despite Pitt's size he feels that
this goal has been successful in that
students can    feel individualized
through   participation  in  student
organizations and clubs.
  As Pitt moves towards celebrating its
bicentennial in 1987, it is also moving
beyond education. The acquisition of
the Harmarville Research Center in
April typifies this. This research complex will solidify Pitt as one of the 40 or
50 research colleges in the United
States. Posvar advocates that the job of
the University is to teach its students
and   conduct research. The     new
research center will enrich the faculty
and this will benefit the students. As
the instructors become involved with
the research they will use this in their
lectures through examples and illustrations, leading students to be more excited about the classroom material.
  The President knows that weights
between research and education must
be in balance. Says Posvar, "The important issue is that the professor not be
distracted by his research mission."
This mission should enrich the lecture
and Posvar reveals that most times this
is the case since the professors are sensitive to this problem.
  President Posvar believes that thei
progress made in 1985 was substantial.
Pitt's role as a hi-tech school continued
to grow as the Campus of the Future got
off the ground and the Information
Age descended upon us. Despite the
rise in hi-tech evident all around us
Posvar maintains the importance of the!
arts and humanities. He argues that the
humanities become the real anchor in
this age of science and technology.
  There are changes in education at
Pitt, but Posvar says, "The    basic
character of learning continues to be
relating to  the  professor in   the
classroom." As long as this is central,
President Posvar and the University
can be confident that they are doing
their jobs.

Planning for the Future
Stage One of the Provost's Five-year Plan Is Completed
A lthough Dr. Roger Benjamin has
been at the University of Pittsburgh for
just a short while he feels that he has
learned a voluminous amount of information and history about Pitt. 1985
represented the planning segment of
the university's five-year plan which,
as Provost, Dr. Benjamin helped create.
Through this intense period Dr. Benjamin studied written documents and
met with numerous people.
  Benjamin finds this job of setting
academic priorities to be challenging.
He has a great love for teaching and
scholarship; he  is a   professor of
political science, and he believes that
this plan will help make Pitt one of the
top 15 schools in the country, bettering
its current ranking of being one of the
top 50 schools.
  The first phase of the plan has concentrated on   establishing academic
priorities. Dr. Benjamin has committed
himself to help to lead this as long as he
feels it is moving in the right direction.
By moving into new areas and building
up some areas that are seen as having
high merit, the university can make
substantial progress in the next few
years.
  This academic priority setting is imDR. BENJAMIN AND HIS SECRETARY, Kathy
Confer discuss his agenda for the day.
portant due to three basic issues according to Benjamin. First, the process
opens up the institution. The Provost
feels that it is important for the Pitt
community to    know   that the administration is accessible. Next, the
planning brings about a better sense of
what the institution is all about. There
are three main functions that Pitt
serves. These are teaching, research,
and  service. Setting priorities also
means making sure these functions are
balanced. Dr. Benjamin stated, "The integration of teaching and research is
what the university is all about." Finally, the fundamental reason why the institution exists is to teach so the quality
of the undergraduate programs must be
raised.
  Dr. Benjamin describes this point that
we are at as a critical junction. The
chance to change does not come about
very often so the current opportunity
must not be lost. However, every time
there is change there will be some
negative results. In Pitt's case, it is the
reductions in many schools. According
to Benjamin, "Nobody wants to cause
anxieties. But professionally, it is a
privilege, not a right to be here." So the
planning asked that certain schools account for their existence. The results
were that schools such as GSPIA, Phar.
macy, and Education underwent cut.
backs and   restructuring. Thus, the
five-year plan was not met with un.
challenged acceptance.
  The Provost admits that the plan is
not without its faults. The concentra.
tion of the program was in evaluating
research  and  scholarship. This is
because these areas are more accessible.
However, in the future Dr. Benjamin
sees another planning cycle that will
concentrate on teaching related issues.
In Pitt's future Benjamin can see mandatory teaching evaluations and an
Honor's College. Without the restructuring going on today, the alternative
of across the board cuts would have to
go into effect.
  By increasing the quality of the programs at Pitt, students also increase the
value of the only true resource they
have - their minds. Dr. Benjamin
hopes this leads to students leaving Pitt
having "internalized a set of structuring principles that will allow them to!
interpret the world they live in." As the
true academician, Dr. Benjamin wishes
upon new Pitt graduates the sense of
self-confidence that they "can be competitive in any arena of life."

Lights! Cameras! Action!
The Film Studies Major Is Now in Production
A t some point in our life we have
all dreamt of becoming a great movie
star and achieving fame and fortune in
front of the world's eyes. As grade
school children  we idolized   Burt
Reynolds. Many more of us envisioned
being Clint Eastwood than Cecil B.
DeMille. But without DeMille's direction names like Reynolds and Eastwood
would not be as well-known to us.
  In reality, acting is just a small part of
the overall picture that leads to a finished  movie. Directors, producers,
camera   people, sound     experts,
photographers, production crews, and
film critics all have major roles. Careers
in these fields are studied by the stillnew film studies major at Pitt. With the
increased attention given to the highly
technical majors it is refreshing and
reassuring that such artistic majors are
still being developed. This major has
been offered in the College of Arts and
Sciences only    since May, 1984.
However, a certificate in film studies
has been offered since 1979.
  The Coordinator of the film studies
program is Dr. Lucy Fischer. Dr. Fischer
is an English professor and earned her
Ph.D. in cinema studies at New York
University. She has been at Pitt since
1979.
  Courses in film studies are taught by
professors in a variety of departments.
These   include  English, Spanish,
French, Italian, Fine Arts, Theatre Arts,
and Psychology. The emphasis at Pitt is
on the theory of film. Film studies is
under the category of humanities as the
program looks at film as an art form.
Attention  is paid  to  the history,
aesthetics, theory, and production of
film.
  Students who choose to fulfill a major in film studies are required to take
three courses. World Film History is an
introductory course which looks at
some techniques of film analysis and
various international works and
movements that made an impact on
past films as well as present cinema.
Topics include the development of narrative films and documentaries. Film
Analysis is a second required course
and majors must also complete a course
designated as an Advanced Seminar in
Film Studies.
  Beyond these classes, courses offered
through the Film Studies Program fall
into three categories. These are National Cinemas and     Film-makers,
Themes, Genres, and    Theory, and

Film   Production. History    of the
American Film is a title of a class which
falls into the first category. It focuses on
the evolution of the American film
style and the relationships between
films and    the  American    society.
Courses in the second category have
such titles as Psychology of the Visual
Arts, Women and Film, Film Musical,
Film Theory, Silent Cinema, Design for
Film, and Literature and Film.
  Many of the courses in the third
category are offered through the Pittsburgh Film Makers. This media arts
center is located    in  Oakland   on
Oakland Avenue so it is convenient for
students to attend production classes
there. These courses give students a
chance to get some practical experience
in filmmaking. There are a variety of
courses in   photography, including
black and white photography. Here,
techniques of photography are taught
as well as an    examination   of the
psychological implications of the work
of well-known photographers. A series
of Film-making courses are also offered. Students view films for followup   discussions. Camera movement,
editing, cinematography, lighting, and
sound are features of film production
which   are  taught. In   addition  to
demonstrations, students also produce
a series of short films.
  These production courses teach the
technical facets of film but the bulk of
the program emphasizes the aesthetic
qualities of cinema     by   studying
American and foreign film. With a
degree in film studies opportunities exist in teaching, film journalism, library
and archive work, film and television
production, screenwriting, and film
editing. With several majors already
declared there may be a future talent
like Cecil B. DeMille currently enrolled
at Pitt.

CAS Requires Students to Taken a Second Language
T he new requirements to obtain a
degree from the College of Arts and
Sciences have been in effect for about a
year now. Changes made are seen in
the distribution of studies and general
education requirements and in the new
writing, quantitative   and   formal
reasoning, and    foreign  language
requirements.
   In the past, studying a foreign
 language was recommended but not re quired. That has now changed. The
 goal of the requirement is for students
 to achieve an elementary knowledge of
 a second language. Students who do
 not have the necessary high school
 background in a language must take
 and pass the first-year courses of a
 language. Basic skills in speaking,
 listening, reading, and writing are
 taught in these two-term  series of
 classes. Although passing other courses
 can also satisfy the foreign language re quirement, this series has become the
 most common.
 For many students this new require ment did not affect their academic
 planning since they intended to major
 in one of the foreign language majors
 offered at Pitt. The majors stress
 language acquisition as well as an
 understanding of the foreign country's
 literature and culture. Some of the ma jors available are in French, Italian,
 German, Spanish, Chinese, Japanese,
 Russian, and Polish.
 In addition to the classroom instruc tion many of the lower-level foreign
 language courses require students to
 spend time weekly at the Language
 Lab. Students can walk in and listen to
 a taped lesson at one of the individual
 carrels. The tape recording is used in
 conjunction with a workbook so the
 students combine hearing and seeing to
 facilitate grasping the language. Often
 the tape requests the participation of
 the student in the lesson by having the
 learner repeat words. Through these
 lessons, the workshop helps students to
acquire the basic skills sought in the
beginning courses. The Language Lab
also handles group instruction in the
center of the room. Here, an entire class
can meet to supplement the lecture.
This is often done for those classes of
students learning English.
  With the variety of programs and the
new requirement, a step forward has
been taken to educate more people in
the use of a second language. As more
students are exposed   to a foreign
language  early  in  their collegiate
careers, a growing number of majors
can be expected. This could lead to
increased popularity of the career fields
of international trade, international
law, international banking, political
science, and foreign service.

Where You Get an Education Matters
This Is the Motto of the College of General Studies
A n often-heard criticism of large
university settings is that students are
not treated as individuals; rather, they
are just identified by their student
number. Perhaps the best example
where this is not the case is in the College  of General Studies. Students
enrolled in this school are treated individually from the moment they apply. This is due to the nature of its student population. Adults attending
part-time, adults seeking a second
degree, housewives taking general interest courses but not working toward a
degree, and students who have just
finished high school all make up a part
of CGS.
  CGS is commonly referred to as Pitt's
evening college. While it is true that
many classes are held at night and on
Saturdays, there are also many courses
conducted during the day. Thus, the
student who works, during the day and
the student who has other evening
commitments can both enroll in classes
which fit into their schedules. CGS
students are also
not limited to just
the Oakland campus. Classes are
also  taught in
Pittsburgh  communities and
suburbs including
the downtown
area, Monroeville,
Oakmont, and the
South Hills.
  Many   of the
majors offered in
the  College  of
Arts and Sciences
are also offered in
the  College  of
General Studies.
The same number
of credits, 120, are
necessary    for
graduation in
each  school but the    degree   requirements vary. CGS students must
pass  courses   divided  into  five
categories. These are communication
skills (9 credits); mathematics, logic, or
foreign  languages   (6-10 credits);
distribution of studies (45 credits divided  into  the science  categories of
humanities, social sciences, and natural
sciences); electives (24 credits); and the
major area of study (36-48 credits).
  A special feeling of unity exists
among CGS students. The fourth floor
of the Cathedral of Learning is home to
the school and special advisors are here
to aid in the registration process. In addition, many mixers and informal gettogethers are held throughout the term
so that students who otherwise may not
spend much time in Oakland can meet
their fellow students.
THESE CGS STUDENTS ARE BUSY taking lecture
notes and defying the belief that the back of the
classroom is for those students needing to catch up on
sleep.

Future Teachers
Education Majors Study to Teach Others
T   here is a certain satisfaction that is             k
gained in a teacher when he sees that
he has gotten his concept through to a
student. A   feeling of unbeatable
pleasure is experienced when a teacher
looks out at his students and sees a
smile or a nod of understanding. The
rewards in a profession do not have to
be complex to be meaningful and this
contributes to the reasons that students
majoring in education choose to enter
the teaching profession.
  Education majors study in the College of Arts and Sciences during their
freshman and sophomore years. They
then transfer to the School of Education
for their final two years. During their
final term of school they may leave the
atmosphere of being a student and
assume the role of a teacher. As student
teachers at area schools the majors are
teachers to the class yet still students as
they are under the supervision of the
regular teacher.
  This year Pitt students taught at
public high    schools including
Oakland's Central Catholic as well as at
area alternative high schools. Many
high school students enrolled at an
alternative school are there because of
disciplinary problems. For a new
teacher this situation can bring about a                                                                   I

Classroom attire is casual for students
and teacher and, in the case of a Pitt
student teacher, students and teacher
are on a first name basis. However, it
would not be uncommon for students
to address the teacher not by her first
name, rather by some unprintable
name. In the words of one 1985 education graduate in such a situation, "I
have been called every name in the
book." Overcoming this situation and
the initial frustration is a challenge. But
when achieved and the respect of the
students is earned nothing can replace
the feeling of achievement and the
sense of accomplishment. The hard

work does pay off.
  The School of Education supports
majors in elementary education and
secondary education. A student also
chooses a field as his or her selected
teaching area and takes a number of
courses to study this area in depth.
Education classes taken cover such
topics as educational psychology,
development of a curriculum, and instructional theory.
  A major in vocational education can
also be studied. Public schools teach
vocational education    to   prepare
'teenagers for the working world. Pitt
supports a vocational education major
that focuses on one of five areas.
Business Education, Distributive Education, Health   Occupations, Home
Economics Education, and Trade and
Industrial Education. To enroll in one
of these programs a technical proficiency in the area must be demonstrated.
This technical training could have been
obtained through working experience
or from classroom study such as at a
community college or technical school.
The  Distributive   Education    and
Business Education programs do not require a previous technical knowledge.
  As one of the proposals resulting
from the University Plan: 1985-1990,
the School of Education was faced with
budget cuts of 25 percent. If these come
it Was expected that health and physical
education would be eliminated. As a
counter-proposal the school's faculty
has suggested restructuring the school
into the three areas: instruction and
learning, administrative and   policy
studies, and psychology in education.
Regardless of the final result of the
planning the school will survive; for
the education of tomorrow's youth is
dependent on the education majors
leaving Pitt today.

BENEDUM HALL is home to the School of

TEAM MEMBERS discuss their strategy before
taking their turn in Ingenuity.
I n 1985 the School of Engineering offered many departments. These were
Chemical and Petroleum, Civil, Electrical, Industrial, Mechanical,
Metallurgical and Materials, and Mining  Engineering. Since   1985 also
marked the year of extensive academic
assessment at the university, the School
of Engineering's administrators did a
study to suggest ways to improve its
curriculum.
  Because it has been experiencing a
decline in enrollment and because it is
not an accredited program, it was suggested  that the major in    mining
engineering should be dropped. Also
candidates for elimination  are the
aerospace   option  in   mechanical
engineering and petroleum engineering's option of nuclear engineering.
The reason cited was the low student
enrollment. New programs were also
outlined. These included   computer
engineering, manufacturing engineering, environmental engineering, and
bioengineering.
  In industry, graduates with degrees
in engineering continue to be in demand. This contributes to engineering's continued popularity as a field of
study. With this popularity comes the
need to continually upgrade the program by bringing in new faculty and
new equipment. This was another goal
stated in the school's recommendations.
Thus, over the next five years the
Engineering School's budget would
have to increase 50 percent to compensate for the new faculty positions and
additional equipment being developed.
  For the   most part, engineering
students supported these changes as
they were recommended to improve
the school. For students majoring in
engineering their identity with the
school is high. This is especially evident during Engineering Week. Many
students participate in this competitive
but fun-filled week where knowledge
acquired    in  the   classroom   is
demonstrated in events that combine
this  learning, creativity, and
originality.
  The Skyscraper Engineer magazine,
published quarterly, is another way for
student engineers to work together outside of lectures. The publication uses
articles, puzzles, photographs, and fictional stories to capture what it is like to
be a Pitt Engineer.

Early Risers
Part of Nursing Student's Weekly Routine Is Attending Clinic
Hairnets and white stockings a
nursing student's wardrobe would not
be missing these items, since a major
part of the student's education is spent
in clinic. A typical day during which a
nursing student had clinic began early
in the morning - sometimes a nursing
student woke before the sun. She dons
the stockings and the rest of her
uniform (a nurse's cap may replace or
join the hairnet) and heads for an area
hospital to spend her day soothing patients and observing registered nurses'
much-practiced techniques.
  This  year only    100   students
graduated from the Nursing School.
Because of this small number, compared with nearly 1,000 graduates in
the College of Arts and Sciences, the
nursing students were a close-knit
group. Over the past four years they
have participated together in Black
Banding ceremonies, the annual Nursing Week, hours of clinic, blood drives,
pinning, and to cap their academic
career - the graduation ceremony.
  An emphasis of the Nursing School's
program has shifted away from the
traditional model of nurses caring for
patients who are already sick. Of course
this will always be a necessary function
of nurses, but she will also be active in
providing health care to prevent illness. Centering the curriculum around
prevention and maintenance and dealing with psychological, sociological,
and physiological aspects of health care
have emerged as important facets of
students' education.
  The future of the Nursing School, as
it existed this year, is in question. A
proposal to combine the school with
Pharmacy and Health Related Professions is being considered. This new
school would be named the College of
Health Sciences. The main purpose of
creating this school would be to bring
together the common elements that are
currently separated, better use of space
could be achieved, parts of the curriculums could   be  combined, and
research projects could be developed
that incorporate more than one of the
disciplines. The effects of these proposed changes on the nursing major
will be seen in the years to come.

Healthy Changes Forecast
SHRP Was a Major Focus of the Academic Evaluation
T   he initial careers that come to mind
when health careers are mentioned are
doctors and nurses. However, if the
employees at any hospital are examined
one would find a variety of other professions that are health related. Preparing students for careers in one of these
professions is the role of Pitt's school of
Health Related Professions. Students
can major in such fields as medical
technology, occupational therapy, and
hospital administration.
  A degree from SHRP can be attained
in two ways. One way is to apply to the
school upon completion of 60 credits at
Pitt. The second way is through SHRP's
interdisciplinary program. Through
this program students who have completed their studies at a two-year college can enroll in SHRP to achieve a
bachelor's degree.
  This year, the programs in the School
of Health Related Professions came
under close scrutiny, as did most programs across the university. This was
part of the academic planning and
evaluation done as the first step of the
Five-Year Plan. Recommendations
were made, and appealed by the SHRP
administration, to close  the inter
disciplinary program and eliminate the

medical technology major. The continuation of medical technology could
result if the area hospitals increase their
support. In   general, a medical
technologist would have such duties as
blood banking, analyzing body fluids,
examining blood for leukemia, studying new techniques and the development of new equipment.
  Besides the elimination of certain
features the university plan has recommended   that SHRP    undertake an
educational program. This plan would
entail SHRP offering programs in
health, physical, and recreation education. Also, research in the fields of exercise and   rehabilitation would  be
studied.
  With the emphasis in education often changing, new    programs are added
and old programs
are discontinued
to  insure that
students are getting the quality
education   they
desire. This year
the School of
Health Related
Professions saw

enrolled in this program have two
paths they can follow. After attending
three terms and passing a state and national board  the students become
qualified as Dental Assistants. A second
choice is to continue with three more
Semesters and pass the required exams
to become registered dental hygienists.
  In general, dental hygienists assist
the dentist. They are qualified to clean
teeth, check for cavities and fill them,
take X-rays, mix cements, and perform
secretarial duties. They are also responsible for patient education which requires a strong theory background. This
theory is part of the routine of the
dental hygiene students' day. Their day
begins at 9:00 and continues until 4:30
and it is filled with lectures and clinic.
Clinic provides the students with practical experience as they assist the dental
students.
  This type of program is offered at
only a few schools in Pennsylvania so
the competition for admission is stiff.
Pitt's School of Dental Assisting and
Oral Hygiene has an enrollment of 110
students who, upon graduation, seek
jobs in private dentists' offices and
clinics. Their specialized education provides these students with the opportunity to attain very rewarding careers
in the dental profession.
PART OF THE DENTAL HYGIENE program includes getting practical experience. Laura Murcko

Discovering New Discoveries
Research Prevents Education From Becoming Static
Research has been going on at the
university for many years. The subject
of research varies and the type of
research changes, but it is always present. In 1953 the Salk polio vaccine was
developed here. Research into organ
transplants has led to Dr. Thomas
Starzl's team of surgeons performing
numerous liver transplants at the
University Health Center. This year
research  into  Alzheimer's Disease
continued.
  Other subject areas have also benefitted from research done at Pitt. In 1975,
anthropologist James Adovasio began
an archeological excavation in an area
south of Pittsburgh. This location is
known as the oldest site of continuous
human   habitation in  the  Western
Hemisphere. In 1977 William Cassidy
discovered the largest meteorite ever
found in Antarctica.
  As one of the fifty largest research
universities in the United States, explorations in many areas will continue
as it did in 1985. Sometimes an important discovery is made as a result of a
professor and a doctoral candidate
working together for the student's
dissertation. The research does not
have to be done at the university. It
could be done "on location" or at a site
operated by the university for the exclusive purpose of research.
  The Pittsburgh University Research
Center was acquired in April. It was
donated by Gulf Oil Corp. and was
previously known as the Hamarville
research center. The university will use
this state-of-the-art research facility for
advanced research and development.
Chevron Corp., which has bought Gulf,
donated $3 million to help Pitt's operation get started.
  Plans for projects at the Center were
drawn up for the announcement of the
acquisition. The Center will provide
"incubator services" to new companies.
Low rent and production help will be
offered, hoping that the companies will
hire an increased number of people
from  Western   Pennsylvania. Other
projects slated were corporate research,
contract research, and scientific collaboration in the areas of coal studies,
biotechnology, and surface science and
magnetics.
  The result of a research project can
take many forms. This year for many
university professors the reward was in
book form. Numerous faculty members
became authors as their months, even
years, of hard work was published.
  The subjects of the books varied as
did the departments and schools that
the professors represented. Often the
books were co-authored, with another
instructor at Pitt or with a professor
from another university. Writing a
book requires a level of expertise and
imagination. This combination resulted
in well over 100 books being written
and edited by Pitt professors.
  Many authors were from the Faculty
of Arts and   Sciences. Dr. Thomas
Dwyer, a professor in the computer
science department, had two books
published. Written    with  Margot
Critchfield, A Bit of IBM Basic and
Structured Program Design With TRS-80
Basic introduce the Basic programming
language to the reader as it applies to
the  specific hardware. Dr. Dwyer
taught Introduction to Microcomputers
and Introduction to Graphics at Pitt this
year.
  Professor Audrey Holland of the
communication department edited two
books. Language Disorders in Adults: ReAS MEDICAL RESEARCH continues to advance,
the University Health Center has expanded.
cent Advances and Language Disorders in
Children: Recent Advances look at current
clinical research findings of language
disorders and the issues surrounding
these disorders.
  Mizoguchi was written   by   Keith
McDonald   from  the Eastern  Asian
Languages and Literatures department.
Mizoguchi is a Japanese director. This
book covers his films by offering a critique of them.
  Two English professors were also
among the university's authors. Professor Robert Gale authored the first
full-length biography of writer Henry
Wilson  Allen. The book    combines
biographical information and a critical
analysis of Allen's works. Lee Gutkind,
the director of the writing progranm,
wrote a book titled The People of Penn's
Woods West. It captures the history and
life of the people of this area of
Pennsylvania.
  Additional books are being written
and some books will have a second or
third  edition  released. As   new
discoveries are made as the result of the
research at Pitt we can look forward to
more and more written works - books,
papers, and essays - being published.

Feeling Like Family
The Honors Center Brings Students Closer Together
The next time you are wandering
around the 35th floor of the Cathedral
of Learning, you might take it upon
yourself to step into the University
Honors Center. Actually, if you are up
that high you will probably stumble
across the center anyway. Or, you may
be compelled to follow the crescendo of
energy which begins about three floors
below. At any rate, you are in for a
pleasant surprise.
  The moment you walk in the door,
you can immediately feel the intense
atmosphere that envelops the five
rooms which make up the center. On
one corner, three students are engaged
in a heated discussion of Nietzsche's
"Beyond Good and Evil." Two others
are seated on the couch reviewing
essays submitted   to The Pittsburgh
Undergraduate Review. In the far hall, an
intense looking man of about 40 nurses
a too-cold cup of coffee. He listens with
apparent pride as two female students
relate tales of their recent academic success. The man is Dr. G. Alec Stewart,
director of the University Honors Program since its inception in the winter
of 1978.
  Upon talking with Dr. Stewart, it is
easy to see just who is the source of the
UHP's energy. He takes a personal interest in virtually every aspect of UHP,
from   the  nationally   acclaimed
Undergraduate Review to the Work Study
Program. He regularly walks around
the center talking with the staff, participating in discussions and offering
advice and encouragement whenever
necessary. He acts as personal host to
each guest of the center, introducing
them to whomever happens by and
making sure no outsider feels like one
for long.
  Stewart initiated the program with
this same sort of enthusiasm in mind.
He saw a large number of highly
motivated students who were bored
with the routine goings-on of traditional campus life. The purpose of UHP
was to get these students excited about
learning. According to Stewart, "The
program gives students with talent and
motivation many opportunities for fun
in the pursuit of high attainment."
  While other students spend their free
time pent up on their dorm rooms
counting the holes in their bulletin
boards or watching re-runs of "Happy
Days," UHP students participate in a
wide range of academic-oriented activities. They can take part in any
number of reading groups, student lectures and poetry readings. They call
tutor fellow Pitt students or actually
work directly with Pittsburgh Public
Schools' students who are experiencing
learning difficulties. They may help
edit essays submitted from around the
country for publication in The Pittsburgh
Undergraduate Review. They can also
participate in UHP's Work     Study
Program.

reward of this program is the personal
satisfaction that comes from hard work.
Completing a class like Humanities 156
- UHP Paths of Inquiry produces a
great sense of achievement. Students
who were often shuffled through a boring high school curriculum are finally
presented with a challenge through the
UHP courses. Upon completing a UHP
course, students can feel thay have
stretched their minds a bit and at last
accomplished something worthwhile
in their educations.
  Most of the nearly 600 students who
participate in UHP do possess exceptional intellect, at least in some particular area. In fact, a 3.25 Q.P.A. is
listed as a requirement for entrance into the program. However, almost any
student who has a high degree of interest and motivation may take courses
through the UHP. According to Dr.
Stewart, "The Hallmark of any major
university is an emphasis on high attainment at all levels. The UHP makes
that point on the undergraduate level
for any interested student."
  In a university where it is often easy
to become lost in the shuffle, the
University Honors Center provides a
24-hour academic community. At the
University of Pittsburgh students can
easily lose their sense of identity and
feel more like a number than a functioning individual. UHP allows them to
actively participate in their education
and interact directly with the people
who make the decisions. It combines an
extremely   enthusiastic  staff and
energetic students with a shared thirst
for knowledge. The result is one of the
most vital, close-knit communities on
the Pitt campus.
DISCUSSING FUTURE COURSE OFFERINGS
AND OPPORTUNITIES is a daily activity for
Honors, advisors and students.
THE FEELING OF CLOSENESS AND FAMILY
that exists at the Honor Center contributes to the
success of the program.

Overcoming Amazing Obstacles
Karen Walkney Overcame Her Deafness to Teach the Sign Language Class
Imagine, if you can, what it would be
like to be the only deaf undergraduate
student at a major university. Think of
the constant frustration which would
result from the communication barrier.
Imagine being treated as an outcast by
fellow-students and teachers alike.
  That is exactly the situation which
Karen Walkney had faced each day by
the time she graduated from Pitt in
1982. Yet, it was precisely this humiliation - this being pushed aside by
teachers and overlooked by peers -
that propelled    Walkney   to  do
something about it.
  Walkney's life is characterized by
set-backs and obstacles which had to be
overcome. During childhood she was
treated as a "slow-learner" and placed
into special classes. Once, she was even
sent to a halfway house for emotionally
troubled children. In high school she
faced teachers with no training in how
to deal with the hearing-impaired and
was forced to keep an interpreter at all
times.
  With such adversity in her past, it is
no surprise that Walkney dreaded going to college. However, her fighting
spirit and amazing drive pushed her to
continue her education and face even
more challenges. Since that time, she
has been pushing herself to the limit
every day.
  After attending Depaul Institute for
the Deaf - an oral school which
teaches speaking  to the deaf and
disallows sign language - Walkney
went on to the National Technical Institute for the Deaf, the only one of its
kind in the world. Here, Walkney
began to become active in projects for
the deaf.
  With   a  new   perspective  and
eagerness to learn, Walkney realized
that she could help other deaf students
so they would not have to experience
the hardships which she had faced. Her
goal was to provide a "social and emotional role model for the deaf community." She wanted to show the deaf
just how much they could accomplish.
  With   this idea in   mind, she
graduated from Pitt with a degree in
social work. She was voted Miss Deaf
Pennsylvania in 1983 which provided
her the opportunity to travel across the
state and work with deaf students. She
also began directing a program for the
deaf through the YMCA called "Camp
Get-Together" which lets deaf children
share experiences.
  However, despite all her work with
the deaf, Walkney's main interest is in
educating the hearing community. She
wants to break down the barriers so
that the hearing no longer feel intimidated by the deaf. This has been
her greatest, but most fulfilling
challenge.
  To accomplish her goal, Walkney
organized the Beautiful Hands, a group

                                      to music. Walkney performs by feeling
                                      the  music's vibration. This group
                                      travels around the area and performs
                                      for both hearing and deaf audiences.
                                        She   also  began  teaching   sign
                                      language classes at Pitt. She looks to a

                                      minority. Through her group, the Sign
                                      Connection, Walkney took this goal a
                                      step further. The group now sponsors
                                      Deaf Awareness Day. This event brings
                                      the hearing and deaf worlds together
                                      and educates both on how to live
                                      together. Corporations are invited to
                                      learn how to incorporate the deaf into
                                      the office. According to Walkney, "It's
                                      for the hearing community from the
                                      deaf."
                                         Walkney's programs are becoming
                                       more popular all the time. Her sign

Coping With School
Learning Skills Center Offers Programs to Deal With Academic Pressures
D o you sometimes feel like calculus
is a foreign language? Does your heart
threaten to jump into your throat
minutes before the professor passes out
an exam? Do you feel as if the harder
you work the farther behind you get? If
you answered yes to any of the above
questions then  the Learning Skills
Center could provide you with that extra bit of confidence needed to succeed
at college.
  The Learning Skills Center incorporates individual counselling and
tutoring and group workshops to help
students cope with    some of the
pressures they experience during a
term. Much of the interaction is between students. Often students feel
more comfortable with a peer as opposed to a professional, so the Center has a
number of Pitt students serving as Student Academic Counselors and math
tutors.
  The student counselors meet with
students in the privacy provided by the
cubicles located in the Learning Skills
Center. Some of the issues that the
counselors go over with a student are
better time  management, lecture
notetaking and textbook reading. Many
students become anxious near examination time. The SACs also address this
fact. They go over preparing for exams
and long term memory.
  In addition, they provide helpful
hints on actually taking an exam. They
cover topics ranging from budgeting
time to ensure most of the test is completed to techniques leading to successful educated guessing.

  In a multiple choice test the verb
tense and whether a or an was used to
lead into the answer selections can be
tip-offs to the right answer. When these
mechanisms do not apply and you still
have no idea what the correct answer is
then you may be interested in knowing
that statistics show that choices B and C
are more commonly used for the correct
answer. And, if you must choose between the two, choosing the longest
answer is a good
strategy. Educated
guessing   is a
technique that all
students have had
to use so it is a
part of the SACs'
presentations.
However, they
impress      on
students    that
these methods
should be used to
answer the last
two or three questions on a test and
not the fifty or so
that made up the
test! The bulk of
the counselling
session is spent
learning techniques to   ensure   STUDENT ACADEMIC
that this is not the case.
  Another program     available  for
students is the math tutoring. The
tutors help students in Math 3A and 3B,
the algebra-trigonometry series, and
the calculus classes. These include PreCalculus, Business Calculus, and Math
22. The tutors have gone through a
two-credit course    learning  math
teaching techniques. The course is
taught by    Learning  Skills Math
Spcialist, Ann Massey. To be effective
the tutors let the student do all of the
writing. This prevents the tutor from
doing all of the work and enables the
student to learn more.
  Besides the one-on-one communications, the Center also offers many
workshops throughout the term. In
1985  these  included   Study   Skill
workshops, seminars to prepare for
final exams, and a workshop on how to
                   study math. These
                   workshops are

Students Helping Students
UTAs Are an Example of Peer Helping
It can be a big step coming from the
security of a high school math program
to the intense college level math
classes. In high school, students are used to smaller classes and a lot of individual help from teachers. Because of
the often overwhelming size of college
math courses a "math phobia" often
results in new students.
  The University of Pittsburgh is attempting  to  remedy  this problem
through the use of undergraduate TAs.
These are students who are proficient
in mathematics and have the desire to
help their fellow students overcome
their difficulties in math. The one-onone level of communication seems to
benefit the students who might feel a
bit more intimidated by graduate TAs.
  Tanya Orr is an undergrduate TA for
Math 3A. She explains that she feels a
little closer to the students than a
graduate TA might. She knows the
problems   the  students are  going
through, whereas a grad student might
take the problems undergrads have as
being rather simplistic. Tanya states, "It
might be easier for a grad student to
make light of the problems because the
work is very simple to them."
  There is, however, a lot involved in
being an   undergraduate TA. Aside
from the two or three recitations per
week, the UTAs must hold office hours,
grade homework, and prepare quizzes
weekly. In addition, those students
who show interest in the program must
take one of two courses in teaching
methods and study skills: "Seminar in
Peer Helping" or "Math Workshop."
Each of these courses is worth two
credits. They must also apply to the
program, attend an   interview, and
finally, the supervisor, Ann Massey
determines   those  who   are  best
qualified. There are currently twentysix UTAs in the Math Department.
  Despite all of the hard work and intense screening, Tanya explains that
the humanistic benefits make it all
worthwhile. UTAs get a great deal of
satisfaction out of knowing that they
have helped   a fellow  student get
through a difficult problem. Students
helping students, that's what makes it
work.

Combatting Writer's Block
The Writing Workshop Helps Students Overcome Their Writing Problems
Sitting with pencil in hand and staring at an empty sheet of paper often
results in writer's block. You do not
need to be an English Writing major to
suffer this ailment; any student with a
written assignment to do can become a
victim. Writer's block can be developed
because of a lack of a thesis statement, a
problem with organization of notes or,
questions about sentence construction,
as well as many other obstacles. Solutions to these questions and problems
can be obtained by stopping in at the
Writing Workshop.
  The Writing Workshop is located on
the fifth floor of the Cathedral of
Learning in the area of the English
department. However, the service is
open to any student and it is not
necessary to be an English major or
enrolled in  a writing  course. By
scheduling an appointment with a professional tutor writing-related problems can be solved. Writing tips are
offered in the area of grammatical
rules, organization, and development.
  At times, when a first draft of a paper
is completed it is met with such a feeling of relief that upon rereading it the
paper appears worthy of an A, if not a
Pulitzer Prize. At times such as these, it
may be worthwhile to let the paper sit
for a day or let someone else read it so
that the critique of the paper is not affected by clouded judgment. The tutors
at the Writing Workshop recognize the
feeling associated with overcoming the
initial writer's block that leads to the
rough draft also becoming the final
draft and they can offer ways to prevent this.
  Like any student service, the instructors at the Writing Workshop will not
write a student's paper for him, that
would help no one; but they can address common writing problems and
suggest ways to combat these. Whether
bothered by when to use who and
when to use whom or armed with a
complex question about the development of a paper a visit to the Writing
Workshop will be beneficial.

vital parts of the construction of a good story.

External Studies Courses Enable Students to Set Their Own Time Schedule
O n those cold January mornings
when somehow, no matter how hard
you try, you cannot crawl out of your
warm bed for your 9:00 class it is easy to
rationalize that nothing important was
going to be covered anyway. If this
happens on too many mornings the
result can be irreparable. But, wouldn't
it be nice if you could sleep in late
every morning and suffer no dire consequences? This can be the case by taking a course offered by the University
External Studies Program.
  Most UESP    courses are offered
through the College of General Studies.
The concept of external studies is to
enable students to study on their own
at home by following a study guide that
was written specifically for the External
Studies Program. The requirements for
grading are like most college courses -
a combination of assignments, papers,
projects, and exams is used. However,
there is a difference. External studies
courses   emphasize   self-pacing.
Although dates are recommended to
complete assignments by, they are not
mandatory.
  With some exceptions, exams are
taken and assignments are completed
when the student feels prepared to
undertake them. On those bitter cold
mornings this program seems to be the
ideal solution but like anything ideal,
there can be a pitfall - procrastination.
To combat this and to provide tips on
self-discipline an assistance group
called the Student Support staff provides a communication link between
the students and the faculty and administrative procedures. In addition
three 3-hour workshops are scheduled
each term so that the professor and
students can come together and meet to
discuss the course material and to compare personal learning experiences.
The University External Studies Program is another example of how the
educational process is constantly
changing. It combines giving students
more responsibility in their own learning and less guidance from university
professors.

More Than a Full Load
Student Athletes Must Fit Classes
and Practices in Their Daily Schedule
T rying to juggle athletic practices
and a full load of classes may be the
toughest game a student athlete at Pitt
ever plays. Take the case of a woman
swimmer. She is at Trees Pool at 7:00
AM for a morning workout and, when
many of us are just waking up, she is
heading into the classroom, only to
return to the pool later in the afternoon. By the time she returns to her
room she has put in more than a full
day, but she still must study. In addition to the practice time, some sports,
especially men's basketball, cause the
athletes to spend much time travelling.
During the Big East Tournament the
team left on Tuesday, March 5, 1985,
and returned Friday afternoon. Thus,
three days of classes were unavoidably
missed. Unfortunately, this becomes
the norm during the basketball season.
Yet, the NCAA requires a student
athlete to complete 12 credits per term.
  This combination of practicing, competing, studying, and attending classes
can become overwhelming. The Office
of Support Services for Student
Athletes offers support and guidance in
successfully juggling these tasks. The
office helps plan the short run and long
term  academic careers of student
athletes. Their goal is for the students
to work and graduate. Toward this end
Support Services provides academic
assessment to judge the reading and

skills development is available to those
students desiring it. They also schedule
and register over 100 freshmen each
fall.
  Many athletes take advantage of the
tutoring  service  provided. Dave
Pistolesi, the Tutorial Coordinator for
the office, points out that many major
colleges have a mandatory study hall at
night that student athletes must attend.
Pitt has no program to parallel this. In
stead, Pitt offers one-on-one tutoring,
recognizing the fact that people learn

differently and have their own unique
study habits. Pistolesi said, "Our goal is
to develop     strong, individual
students." This theory results in the
one-on-one tutoring. The tutors can be
either   graduate     students    or
undergraduates and they often join the
program based on the recommendations of professors.The tutoring sessions can take place in the office or
away from it so the sessions are informal, but they must follow the academic
guidelines. This translates to mean the
tutors cannot do the work for the
athletes.
                      A   special ser               OF   enables student
,  athletes to keep
                    track of their pro                    gress   in  their
                    courses during the
                    term. Support Ser                    vices monitors the
                    status of students
                    following    mid                    terms. The pro                    fessors are asked
                    to fill out a short
          Ami       form  which asks
                    how hard the stu                    dent has been
                    working, what improvements could be made, and what
grade the student has earned to date.
According to Pistolesi this enables the
"kids to see in black and white how
they are doing."
  Many student athletes take advantage of the services provided by the office. How-ever, it is hard to determine
the criteria on which to judge the success of the program. The students'
grades are important but the ultimate
goal in the minds of all counsellors in
the Office of Support Services is to see
the athletes graduate.
  When the NCAA passed their new
guidelines to    determine   athletic
eligibility it made the public more
aware of graduation rates, grade point
averages, and eligibility of athletes.
Universities across     the   country
published figures pointing out the
academic standards of their athletes.
Pistolesi maintains that it is often
misleading to compare these figures at
face value because different methods of
computations are used. For example,
when determining graduation rates do
you include in your calculation the
percentage of athletes who graduate
with those athletes who left school
before they attended for four years?
And, with what class do you figure in
the student athlete who has been redshirted, with his academic class or with
his athletic eligibility standing? These
questions have no simple answers. As a
result, Support Services does not emphasize the numeric figures. On the
other hand, just succeeding in maintaining the athlete's eligibility is also
not enough. For, as Pistolesi expressed,
"That's exploiting kids."
   The graduation   rates for student
athletes at Pitt are high. However, not
every athlete at Pitt graduates. Pistolesi
said, "We are not going to get 100%, but
we want to put the students in a position where they can come back and
finish quickly." If the general population of Pitt students was analyzed, the
athletic population would    probably
fare no worse in terms of graduation
percentages and length of time taken to
earn a degree. Many students decide to
attend an additional term of classes to
prevent overloading a course schedule
or to make up for lost time due to such
factors as changing a major. In the case
of an athlete, not finishing in four years
is seen as a negative factor. Perhaps if it
were looked at in the terms just mentioned, it would not be.
  The student athlete is asked to perform on the field and in the classroom.
Succeeding in both requires dedication,
hard work, and stamina. The Office of
Support Services for Student Athletes is
there to provide an assist when one, or
both become overwhelming.

Where are you going?
The Answer Could Be Found at the Career Seminar
"W        here are you going?" -
This was the question that was being
asked at the Career Seminar Series
held in the William Pitt Union during the first week of October. Many
freshmen and sophomores had no
answer to this question. When asked
their major they answered with
"undecided" or "liberal arts." By
walking around the seminar these
students were given a chance to talk
one-on-one with a member of an industry in which they had an interest.
  The Seminar was sponsored by the
Career Counseling Center with the
primary goal of helping students
make career decisions. Each day
brought a new field to the Assembly
Room. There were over 250 total
representatives. Monday and Thursday was devoted to Business, Industry, and    Communication.
Government and law was covered on
Tuesday, and professionals from the
fields of health, education, and social
service spoke to    students on
Wednesday.
  Although many students had no
idea how to -answer the question,
"Where are you going?" and were
looking for answers to general questions, there were also students with
more specific things on their minds.
Juniors and seniors attending knew
their major but questioned how they
wanted to apply it. With any major
there is a wide variety of positions
that a graduate qualifies for so each
individual must focus on what interests him or her most within that
field. The professionals provided
helpful insight on what a certain job
title requires and the typical duties
of that job holder.
  By midweek the Career Seminar
had helped many students answer
the question "Where are you going?"
but now another question had come
up: "How are you going to get
there?" As a senior approaches
graduation he realizes that the interview for the job is a big step toward
reaching where he would like to be.
To aid in this respect a workshop was
offered on  the last day  of the
seminar. Conducted by Career Consultant Bob Perkowski, "How to Survive a Job Interview" provided those
who atttended with hints on how to
get the most out of the interview -
how to prepare for it, how to present
yourself during it, and how to use
good follow-up procedures. This lecture provided many tips to add to the
many received throughout the week.
When examined all together many
students found that they were much
closer to making that career decision
and this was the goal of the Career
Seminar Series.

To Stay or Not to Stay
Relocation Is a Major Decision for Many Pitt Seniors
The headline reads, "Pittsburgh
is the No. 1 city in the nation." It
would not be uncommon to find an
article in that same newspaper citing
Pittsburgh's    above   average
unemployment. It may appear that
these two items should be mutually
exclusive. Regardless whether this is
the case, a Pitt senior often finds
himself or herself having to choose
between remaining in the Number
One city or pursuing more promising career opportunities outside of
Pittsburgh.
  This decision is harder than at
many schools because of the make up
of Pitt's student population. According to' Robert R. Hopkins, the
Director of Placement, the typical
Pitt   student    has   certain
characteristics. Most students have
their homes within 50 miles of Pitt's
campus and come from a strong
family background. Carrying the
generalities further, the student is
probably a member of the first
generation of his family to attend
college. Often, his father has been
the main breadwinner of the family
and has worked in the Pittsburgh
area during most of his life. Against
this backdrop students have chosen
to come to Pitt to attend classes and
earn their degree. By doing so, the
family ties have been reinforced.
Hopkins sees this as a positive reflection on  Pittsburgh and  its uniqueness. However, this closeness
results in turmoil for many seniors as
they make the adjustment to relocation. Hopkins states, "What we are
going through at Pitt is the end of a
sociological familial era."

THE BULLETIN BOARDS LINING the walls of
the Placement Service hold information ranging
from part time job listings to the weekly interview schedule.
  This necessity   of considering   a
change in residence does not affect all
majors equally, and within majors and
across majors students react to it differently. During the 1984-85 recruiting
season   mechanical and     electrical
engineers and computer science majors
were in the most demand. However,
this demand was often outside of
"What we are going through
at   Pitt   is  the    end    of   a
sociological familial era."
Pittsburgh, and what has come to be
known as "brain-drain" continued to
be experienced locally as the hi-tech
graduates found jobs in other cities.
Students who     had  devoted   their
academic careers to accounting     or
business also found themselves being
heavily recruited. Unlike the technical
majors, these students found many op                      aI m
portunities to remain in the Pittsburgh
area. Local businesses, such as the
department stores and insurance companies, were looking for graduates who
could enter the company and learn.
Liberal arts majors and general business
students fit this mold. Students in the
fields of social work, education, and
nursing have not, as yet, found the
need to address relocation very much.
  There can be many factors determining how someone will react to relocation. Different magnets can be at work,
either drawing a student to adulthood
or drawing him back to the old gang.
Relocation is not for everyone and
some students used the placement service to interview   exclusively with
Pittsburgh-based    companies. But
Hopkins cautions, "A self-limiting candidate will never meet the potential an
employer wants." And seniors have
spent the last four years of their lives
proving that they have the potential.
  It may be the case that leaving the city is the route required to show this
potential, but the move does not have
to be permanent. Hopkins is optimistic
about Pittsburgh's future and cites the
fact that the job market here has improved over the last five years. He expects this trend to continue as the labor
market changes. As April approached
many seniors came to understand this
outlook and were ready to leave the
milieu of academia and begin their professional careers. If this took them outside of Pittsburgh, then so be it. For,
first they fought relocation, then they
accepted it, and finally they welcomed
it.

AFTER CLASSES ARE OVER FOR the day
students head to the library to avoid the noise of
the dorms or the distractions of home.
THE MAGAZINE INDEX PROVIDES a quick
way for this Pitt student to locate the
whereabouts of an article.
Imagine it is about 12 noon and you
are walking through Hillman Library
looking for a table to share with your
friends. You probably have to go to
your third or fourth favorite spot
before you can find an available table.
You may be wondering why everyone
chooses the library to congregate and,
in light of this, how you were able to
find any table. Now imagine it is 1936.
Hillman Library with its 255,000 square
feet and seating capacity for 2,500
students does not exist yet. Thus, you
are walking through     Pitt's central
library located in the Cathedral of
Learning with the same goal in mind.
Now, instead of walking amid the
spacious surroundings and 1,200,000
books we take for granted at Hillman,
you are limited to surroundings that
house up to 140,000 books and 640
students. You quickly find that your
favorite and least favorite study spots
are taken and you can only wish for a
larger library. Luckily, it is no longer
1936. Since 1968 Hillman Library has
been available for use. Thanks to
private study carrels, group   study
rooms, and numerous tablees it is a
place to spend time. Time for studying,
or spending with friends, or making
new friends, or doing research, or...
   Like any library, Hillman has its card
 catalogs, microfilm room, reference
 areas, and bookstacks. But Hillman of fers much more. The second floor holds
 the reserve room which we have all
 used for one class or another. Instruc tors can  hold  materials there for
 students' use. Usually they are lent on a
 two-hour basis. Much of this material
 will follow the same path: from reserve
 room to photocopier, but you can no
 longer "put another nickel in" to get a
 copy; not since the inception of Ven dacard. This little card can be bought
 for 50 cents and at any time a cash
 amount can be read onto the card. You
 can now make unlimited copies until
 the value reads zero without worrying
 about carrying nickels and dimes.
 The    ground   floor is the main
 reference area and information center
 but it also is the location of Hillman's
 map collection. Contained in the collec tion are National Geographic maps and
street and road maps from throughout
the world. A stop here is necessary
before you go biking abroad. The Stark
Listening Center has a variety of tapes
from literature, music, and foreign
languages which     can  be used   for
private  listening, learning, and
enjoying.
   For those people looking for the
 unusual, finding your way to the third
 floor is a must. Hillman's Special Col lections are housed here. Rare books,
 finely bound books, and rare comic
 books are some of the samplings to be
 viewed there. And, for those students
 with spare time on their hands, fiction
 books and recreational readings can be
 found  at the first floor's Alldred
 Collection.
   When    confronted  with  a major
 research paper to do, Hillman would be
 the logical place to begin. Your search
 may start here but before you finish
 you will probably find yourself explor ing Pitt's other libraries. The branch
 libraries total 17 in number and are
 spread throughout Oakland from the
 Chemistry   and  Computer Science
 Library in Alumni Hall to the Music
 Library in the Music Building. These
 libraries offer specialized subject matter
 and  trained  librarians to help in
 specific areas. Many of these libraries
 are designed for graduate research but
 are available for undergraduate use as
 well. The Fine Arts Library is designed
 for art and architecture students and
 contains in-depth     holdings on
 Medieval, Renaissance, and Modern
 Art.
 Libraries are often perceived as cold
 and stuffy, but this does not have to be
 the case. Hillman Library can be warm
 and cozy if you just take the time to go
 beyond the book shelves to discover
 the diverse collections and facts of in terest there - and don't forget to stop

loud stereo nearby to concentrate
would appear to have to study
elsewhere. This is no longer the case.

  Study skill experts also agree that

there may not be. a refrigerator to
head to, but there are many other
possibilities at Hillman to take advantage of until a clear head for studying returns. One can always read
the graffiti on the tables, peruse the
bookshelves, seek out a friend to talk
with for a few minutes, or take a
short nap (many students believe
there is a strong correlation between
studying at Hillman and sleeping).
Even   though   you   can  become
momentarily distracted, it is easier to
get back to studying at the library
since these distractions are temporary. No matter how bizarre you

Registration Begins With Advisors
Advisors Are Links Between Students and Academic Process
Being responsible for the smoothsailing academic careers of 120 students
is no easy task. That is the overwhelming job which advisors must face each
day. The advisor is a very important
link between the individual student
and the entire academic process. They
spend sixteen hours per week at the job,
and only about two of these is spent on
paperwork. For the other fourteen
hours a week the advisors meet with
students one-on-one.
  The most hectic time for advisors is,
of course, during registration. They
may have as many as ten appointments
per day with students. The job of the
advisor is to be able to answer any questions the students might have. The student's job is to have the questions.
  The   whole  registration process
begins with advising appointments.
These informal meetings allow the student and advisor to get to know each
other. They are essential for the advisor
to identify any problems the student
may be encountering. They also give
the student a chance to talk to someone
within the university system who has
genuine   concern    for students'
well-being.
  Advising sessions are followed by
the more formal registration sessions.
Here, the student presents the advisor
with his/her desired course options.
The advisor may then     give some
helpful ideas about which particular
courses and teachers would be in the
student's best interest. After this, is the
trip to Thackeray and the long registration lines.
  Often students take their advisors for
granted. They expect advisors to know
what is best for them and to inform
them. Yet few people ever wonder how
their advisors came to have so much
on-hand information about how Pitt

works. Most advisors have      been
students and/or teachers for quite a
while. They    have  a  very  good
knowledge of the problems students
are facing. In fact, advisors are required
to be graduate students, and    can
therefore take a special interest in
students' concerns.
  Aside from this initial requirement,
there is a lot involved in becoming an
advisor. They must first apply and participate in two interview sessions. The
interviewers look for people who are
intelligent, personable and have some
knowledge of the university. Counselling experience is not a requirement.
Once accepted the prospective advisors
go through an extensive training program. It lasts seven weeks and requires
twenty hours per week. During this
time the advisors go around to the
various departments, meet the faculty
and learn about the courses that are offered. They are able to obtain a great
deal of valuable information to pass on
to students.
  Advisor Cindy Hoffman     explains
that advising students is hard work.
There are so many students to become
familiar with; yet Cindy says, "I was
surprised at how quickly I got to know
them." There are many humanistic
benefits to being an advisor; the individual contact with students is one of
the most important. However, it can
often be difficult to find the "right
combination of personal guidance and
the encouragement that the student
needs to become more independent."
  The advisors are there to guide
students in a suitable direction. They
can contribute a wealth of information
to students. It is the student's responsibility to utilize that information as a
complement to his/her own skills,
needs, and aspirations.

Aim High!
The Air Force ROTC Prepares Students for Military
This year's senior class has seen a
definite improvement in the Air Force
ROTC program at Pitt over the last four
years. As freshman cadets the program
had a detachment rating of 132 out of
151 programs across the country. Today,just four years later, the rating has
risen to a very impressive tenth. This
rise can be attributed to Lt. Colonel
Joseph R. Kolek who was at Pitt for
over two years and Colonel David N.
Thompson who is the present overseer
of the program. Colonel Thompson is a professor of
aerospace
science and
he has been
at Pitt since
August 10,
1984. He is
the current
instructor of
the sophomore class
and brings
22 years of
Air Force experience to
his position.
  The Air
  Force  Reserve Officer
Training
Corps
(AFROTC)
prepares
cadets for active duty. This is achieved
through a combination of classes, labs,
and a four-week summer camp between
a student's sophomore and junior years.
  The classes combine lectures, student
presentations, and films, and the content varies with each academic year.
The freshman and sophomore classes
are each one-credit and deal with the
Air Force organization and history.
When a cadet enters his third year of
the ROTC program he or she enrolls in
a series of three-credit courses. The
junior class deals with management. It
is the most civilian of the classes and
teaches different styles of management
leadership. The title of the senior class
is "National Security  Forces." The
students study   why  alliances are
formed and why they are broken, as
these relate to the Air Force. This
course also examines current events.
  Participation in the AFROTC program offers more than just an academic
environment. Students compete each
term for voluntary assignments. The
top student position is the Group Commander, held in the winter term by
Karen Serafino. As Group Commander,
Karen's duties ranged from training to
making sure all cadets in the Professional Officer Course have a position.
She also was responsible for evaluating
the cadets at the end of the term, which
is one of the criteria on which awards
are based, and    ensuring that appearance regulations are met. As Karen
stated, "The regulations fill a book,"
and it includes such items as how to
wear the uniform and where to place
the rank on it.
  Serafino also wrote the job descriptions for the cadets directly below her.
These serve as an outline of the
organization of Pitt's ROTC. Each
winter a position of Special Advisor is
created. This was filled in the winter
term by David Tobin who acted as the
Group Commander during the fall.
Other AFROTC organizations serve as
planners for activities that occur during
the year. The Arnold    Air Society
Service fraternity donates their time to
community functions such as answering phones during a WQED telethon
and   labeling  cans for Children's
Hospital's charity drives. They also
sponsored three blood drives during
the year and provided the Color Guard
for home football games.
   From March 5, 1985, through the
 ninth the Arnold Air Society National
 Conclave 1985 was held at the Pitts burgh Hilton Hotel. The location of

people from AFROTC programs across
the country were treated to festivities
such as a dinner dance and a trip down

Fleet.
  The largest subdivision of the cadets
is led by the Vice Commander. This
position was the undertaking of senior
Barry Migyanko in the winter. According to Serafino, he is responsible
for the daily, but not routine, running
of the operation, for as Karen said,
"Nothing's really routine here." The
Vice Commander's duties can be divided into four subdivisions, one of which
is the Operations Division. In addition
to other functions, this division is
responsible for training freshmen and
preparing sophomores for the field
training. For a cadet to    become

commisioned   upon   graduation  this

  There is a special spirit and pride
shared  among    members of the
AFROTC. It is demonstrated by Pitt's
Blue Day. Cadets are required to wear
their uniforms to class and the weekly
lab. In addition, the blue uniforms are
visible throughout the campus every
Thursday between 9:00 AM and 5:00
PM. This is Blue Day. The relatively
small number of cadets, there are 110
students in the program at Pitt, enables
this dedication and closeness to exist.
  Another benefit of involvement in a
ROTC program is the job security it
provides upon graduation. In April
Karen graduated with a BS degree in
Computer Science and Math. Unlike
many of her classmates Karen knew for
a long time who her employer would
be - the United States Government.
On April 28, 1985, before Commencement exercises, Karen and her fellow
senior cadets were commissioned into
the Air Force for four years. This opportunity to gain fulfilling experience and
advanced   education   was possible
because of involvement with the Air
Force ROTC.

"The Lecture Syndrome"
Its Symptoms are listlessness and irritability. Do you have it?
For many years, scholars, physicians, humanitarians, and... well,
other important people have been
researching the lifestyles of college
students. Their purpose    -   to
discover the   reasons so   many
students experience listlessness, irritability, and above all, the tendency to nod off at will during class.
Many conclusions have been proposed, including: lack of sleep, poor
eating  habits and   fast living.
However, all of these experts have
failed to uncover one shocking new
find - "The Lecture Syndrome."
This discovery is so revolutionary it
could change the course of learning
for centuries to come.
  Recent studies have shown that,
horror of horrors, many college
students are displeased with their
classroom environment. This is a
result of several factors.
  It seems that students become
frustrated and  disoriented upon
entering a lecture hall which is so
large that a microphone must be
used by the professor and video
monitors must project his or her image to the students in the rear of the
class. This shock and the feeling of
alienation which accompanies it produce   a  strange, but natural,
phenomenon from the students in
the last several rows - they are
often thrust into a fit of slumber
which may often last for the duration of the lecture.
  A second prominent factor which
contributed to the Lecture Syndrome
is the apparent drabness of many
classrooms. The rooms which cause
the most problems are those which
are painted a pale yellow or sea-foam
green shade, have no windows and
no central ventilation. Students attending classes in these areas are frequently given to a type of tantrum
which compels them to write on
anything  from   their desks, to
themselves to the girl in front of
them.
  One final factor involves the actual classroom seats. Many have lefthanded desks; many have no desks at
all; many have desks which cannot
be lifted. After a day of battling such
seats and desks, it is not uncommon to
see students growling on thier way
back to the dorm rooms.
  Much research must still be done on
this new and exciting subject. When
university administators get news of
"The Lecture Syndrome," we can be
certain that they will rush right out to
correct the  problem. Until then,
students may find solace in the fact that
help is on the way.
THE NATIONALITY ROOMS ARE a unique atmosphere to have a class in. In top photo, student

Pitt in 10 years. This particular Conclave included a member of their Grand
Council as well as workshops and
seminars for the attending brothers. As
a philanthropy project, a party for the
children,,at th  Western Pennsylvania

Delta Sigs.

  The brothers of Lambda Chi Alpha
believe in a strong brotherhood where
all the members strive together to
achieve success in the fraternity name.
Academics were a very important part
of this year's program, ad the brothers
helped  by  providing   upport and
motivation  for the n~e   members.
Lambda Chi Alpha pridod itself as being unique because their prospective
brothers "associated"  rather than
pledged. Many brothers preferred this
title because with the idea of associate
membership   gives the   prospective
brothers a better feeling of pride, rather
than   the feeling   of inferiority
associated with the word pledge.
  Knowing that the "American Spirit"
cai not be kept down, the brothers of
Lmbda Chi Alpha presented        an
lUdio-visual show mixed with some
"tchno-dazzle" as a part of their Greek
Sing'85 performane. Their music was
of course "American Pe" by Don
McLean. One brother commented, "We
couldn't get much more traditional
than that."

- Deaf Awareness Day
Silence Explodes Into Music
    Ihe Silent world of the deaf and
the hearing impaired exploded into
music and laughter as Deaf Awareness
Day got into action at the William Pitt
Union. Hearing    impairment and
deafness afflict over 14 million
Americans, and trying to blend in can
be a major obstacle.
  Bruce Nisberg, chairman of Deaf
Awareness Day, said, "We have to get
the hearing community and the deaf
community together so we can be
friends. People look at us as though we
are strange. We have to make it easier
for us to fit in."
  Karen Walkney, along with her signing group Beautiful Hands, signed the
lyrics and danced to the music of many
songs, including the new song "We are
the Children."
  Ken Meese, from television station
KDKA, was the emcee for the day. He
said that he had done public interest
stories on the deaf before but never had
the chance to perform at such an event
before.
  Meese said he had met Walkney
before but hadn't realized she was deef
at first. He since has learned about
Beautiful Hands and the current program at Pitt. "It's quite interesting that
Pitt now offers the (sign) language as a
foreign language. It opens up a whole
new world now for students."
  Christmas Murphy, a Pitt junior, said,
"I saw a poster for the sign club and it
fit into my plans of special education,
so I just went to a meeting. Then I
started taking the classes." Now a
secondary English education major, she
has been signing for about two years.
  Junior Mike Elliot, who is involved
with the YMCA's Camp Get Together
for Deaf Children, said "I just started
taking  the  classes with   Karen
(Walkney). It's her program and it's
interesting."

To Pitt's Greeks - She's Priceless
   Bridget Guernsey is a name that
 every Greek at the University of
 Pittsburgh should   keep  close at
 hand. Bridget is the Assistant Direc tor of Student Activities for Greek
 Organizations and she is working
 hard to promote the Greek system
 and improve its standing.
   Bridget is a graduate of Ball State
 University where she was a member
 of Alpha Chi Omega. After gradua tion she served as a consultant to her
 sorority. After a short stay at the
 University of Cincinnati, where she
 worked   as Greek   Affairs Coor dinator, Bridget made her move to
 Pitt. Her Master's Degree       in
 counselors education, along with her
 experience, has helped Bridget in
 helping others.
   As with any job, Bridget finds ad vantages and disadvantages as the
 Greek advisor. One clear advantage
 is the student enthusiasm which
 makes her job    more   enjoyable.
 Because the Greek system    is so
 strong nationally as well as on cam pus, it is easier to find support with
 their organizations. As Bridget puts
 it, "Greeks are without a doubt the
 most school spirited   group   on
 campus."
 "It's really sad to see that people
 have the same stereotypes of Greeks
 that were present since the 1970's,"
 complains Bridget. She finds this a
 strong disadvantage to   her job.
 "Greeks work    hard  to  achieve
 academic success and many become
 leaders later in life." She cites Presi dent Ronald Reagan as evidence.
 Though stereotypes persist about
 the Greek system, Greeks at Pitt con tinue to raise thousands of dollars
 every year for a good cause. One of
 the problems that let the out-dated
 stereotypes continue is the lack of
 public relations available to the
 Greeks. "I feel that the University of
 Pittsburgh has good resources and is
 committed to Greeks," notes Bridget.
 "However, it's difficult to give them
 all the attention they need because
 there are other priorities which come
 first, and we understand    that."
 Bridget goes on to say, "The Univer sity's intentions are good and they
offer a lot of support; Greeks just
have to learn how to be their own
public relations."
   What's next for Bridget? Well, she is
 now trying to make herself more visi ble to the Greek community. Because of
 the size of Pitt, Bridget feels that many
 of the services and resources available
 go unused. She, in fact, is one of the
 valuable resources that many of the
 Greeks overlook. "A lot of the students
 don't even realize I'm here sometimes,
 so they often spend two hours going
 from office to office trying to find
 something out." With a skillful air
 about her and the slightest touch of
modesty, Bridget continues, "I could
have done it in five minutes."
AT THE DEDICATION of the new fraternity
complex, Bridget had a few words to say.
IN HER OFFICE on the first floor of the student
Union, Bridget makes plans for Pitt's Greeks.
  The brothers of Sigma Chi were a
happy bunch last year, as 1984-85
marked    seventy-five    years of
brotherhood for that fraternit.This
celebration was visited by e Si
Chi National President          t e
brothers had the opportunity to larn a
few facts about their fraternit,, and also
manage to have a great deal of fun.
  This year, as in the c          r,
the brothers of Sigma Chi spo    ed
"Derby Days." Many events were held
to raise money, such as "Derby Scramble" and a banner contest just to name a
couple. The proceeds from this year's
"Derby Days" went to the Rehabilitation Institute to help cover the cost of
treatmet for those who cannot afford
Se     h c ~ of rehabilitation.
   hiear, Sigma Chi was also very
active  fraternity intermurals. In fact,
the   othrs clinched the first place,
All-po    trophy given by the Inter
ternit Concil. The Sigma Chi's are
looking forwd to another good year
in Fall Rush'85, and hope to recruit
some   excellent men     for their
brotherhood.

  As with any group of organizations,
there is always one group of people
assigned or elected to be the governing
force and spokesman for the majority.
In the fraternity system, this organization is known as the Interfraternity
Council (IFC). Pitt currently has 21 national fraternities some of which
established chapters as early as 1904.
  The IFC has a variety of purposes.
Probably the most important purpose is
that the IFC seeks to "enh        he
orgiizatioi promotes     e ideals u
brothrhood   iso, tad   n and formal
ritul empai        taideas that are
uniqe to i     org ni  n. The IFC
als   rives to involve stu ts in serve funtion i-,nefiting th uveri
and the community. Fraternities have
often been stereotyped as a bunch of
beer-sucking, hell raising kids. The IFC
here at Pitt is doing what it can to show
the community that Greeks are hardworking, goal-oriented people. This is
seen every year during Greek Week,
when all the greek organizations work
together to raise thousands of dollars
for a worthwhile charity. This year's
proceeds benefited    Eye  and   Ear
Hospital of Pittsburgh.
  Throughout the 1970's fraternities
came under a lot of fire because of their
pledging activities. Hazing became a
major concern of the IFC. One of the
top priorities of the IFC members here
at Pitt is to standardize, control and
regulate pledging activities to ensure
the safety of the student. In line with
this, they also oversee the social functions of the men's social fraternities to
be certain that all groups are conforming with the University policy.
  The IFC has its own constitution
which every fraternity must abide by.

presidents spent their college days in
the Pitt Greek System. Many of those
who form Pitt's administration have
Greek backgrounds, also; including a
number of vice-chancellors and
members of the Board of Trustees.
  Greeks control most of the leadership
positions throughout campus. Luke
Kluchko, Delta Tau Delta brother, is the
Student Government Board President
and many of the other board members
are also Greeks. The IFC teaches leadership and self-governance which makes
these gentlemen an asset to society.

omen     L   ader         body over the 16 national sororities here at the
                          University of Pittsburgh. The purpose of this
                          organization is "t( develop and maintain
                          sorority life and intrsorority relations at a high
                          level of accomplishment."
                            Panhel is responsible for making certain that
                          cooperation between the social sororities and
                          the University administration is insured. They
                          also encourage the soroities to promote the in                          terests and the reputation of the University of
                          Pittsburgh.
                            With today's women becoming more career
                          oriented than ever befor, Panhel is responsi                          ble for encouraging the sorority women to
                          achieve intellectual superiority. Sorority
                          members serve as a motivating force for each
                          other.
                            Throughout histry soorities have existed;
                          however, it was n, until recently that society
                          noticed these wor,  as nore than "tea-sipping
                          belles." Sorority women today are concerned
                          with political, economic, and social problems,
                          and what they can o it improve such situa                          tions. A new found independence and pride
                          has evolved as maniy emerging leaders were
                          members of sororitie~ in college.
                            As with IFC, Panhel is also very active and
                          concerned with th,, rorities doing a certain
                          amount of service %ork for the community.
                          These women are an instrumental part of Greek
                          Week and are respnsibl for seeing to it that
'    the sororities pull their weight and raise money
                          for charity.

- NURSING WEEK
    With Nurses
          Anything
                     Goes
         Smost anything goes was the
theme of the day as the Pitt nurses took
a break from the books to celebrate this
year's Nursing Week.
  The Victoria Hall lobby never saw so
much commotion as today when our
girls took off their caps to have some
fun. Bedpans, wheelchairs, surgical
gloves and anything else imaginable
became props for the festivities. Relay
races of all kinds became the mode of
competition between members of the
different classes.
  After the long hours of studying
nurses put in, almost anything goes is
just a "fun time to compete."
WHEELCHAIR RACES were but one of the
events our nurses participated in. Lisa Gaulik
shows her skill.
ENJOYING A GAME OF EGG TOSS are Amy
Dukoucic and Patty Gaygoo.
SPOONING HER WAY ALONG, this eager nt

Making a Wish Come True
      N ursing Week'85 was brought
:o a close with a huge semi-formal diner/dance at the Pittsburgh Hilton.
rhe highlight of the evening was a
lide show giving the nurses and their
lates a chance to sit back and enjoy
four years of nursing school.
  After dinner a presentation was made
to the Western Pennsylvania Make-aWish Foundation for $880.40. Proceeds
from this year's nursing week benefited
Make-a-Wish. The foundation    was
established to  aid  terminally  ill
children in  Western  Pennsylvania.
Their primary goal is to help satisfy
these children's wishes while there is
still time. The rest of the evening was
spent dancing and socializing.
MAKE-A-WISH REPRESENTATIVES, Mr. and
Mrs. William Atkins were on hand to receive the
donation.
SOME HEARTY PARTIERS enjoy the evening
of dinner and dancing.
TAKING A MUCH NEEDED REST after a long
week filled with activities.

- Homecoming Week
             Ponthermonia Pride
        omecoming'85 erupted on
Pitt just in time to save us all from the
hassles that come with two months of
classes. Homecoming has long been a
tradition at universities as a time for
parades, parties and an extra special
football game. This year at Pitt was no
exception.
  Panthermania became the theme for
Homecoming'85. With the spirit of the
Blue and Gold following a jagged path
through football season, the boost to
Pitt's morale and pride was a welcome
relief. Panthermania was kicked off on
Monday morning when students voted
HOMECOMING ROYALTY, Karen Eastley and
Mark Masters, this year's King and Queen.
PRESIDENT POSVAR escorts the King and
Queen around the Pitt stadium.

NURSING STUDENT ORGANIZATION members show
off their float in the parade.
BUD MAN joins in on the homecoming festivities.
PHI ETA SIGMA sends a message to Navy before the
game.
for their choice of King and Queen.
This year's winners were Mark Masters
and Karen Eastley. Mark and Karen
were radiant as Pitt's choice for
Homecoming royalty.
  Radiance was abundant at the Panthermania parade as well. Not even the
rain could keep students away from the
annual parade through Oakland. Colorfully decorated floats, designed by the
various student organizations,
weathered their way around campus to
help brighten the spirits of all who attended. The streets were brought to
musical livelihood as the Pitt Marching
Band and bands from various high
schools in   the   Pittsburgh  area
celebrated    the   tradition    of
homecoming.
  Panthermania was a wonderful, and
needed, display of the pride and enthusiasm Pitt students can show for
their school.

A Sploshing Success
         s Homecoming week continued at Pitt, Panthermania activities
continued to dominate the campus
scene. On Thursday night the Cathedral
Lawn was taken over by a circus-like
tent which became home to the Panthermania Carnival. Students crowded
into the tent to take part in the fun. Student organizations sponsored boothes
featuring a variety of activities and
refreshments ranging from caricatures
to funnel cakes. Everyone seemed to
enjoy eating and playing games and
reports were heard around campus that
Foge became the hit of the carnival by
swallowing thongs? The highlight of
the carnival was the dunking machine.
Any anxiety being repressed from
professors to sweethearts was alleviated
by students who took turns downing
their prey. The dunking machine was
sponsored by the Nursing Student
Organization and walked home with
first prize for best booth.

Roll Out the Keg
         n October 26, the Cathedral
Lawn was once again home to the annual Keg Roll. Teams of men and
women, led by our president Wesley
Posvar, competed in many outrageous
tasks. Beginning with  an obstacle
course, Pitt students competed in the
keg roll, and then on to eating bananas,
holding a balloon between their legs
and sliding through oil. Brothers from
the fraternity, Phi Kappa Theta, were
the victors.

                                 THE BRIDGE.
                    A bridge is an act of communication. It becomes the means for
               movement, for exchange, for commerce. Like a strong idea in a well               balanced sentence, it connects people to each other.
                    Pittsburgh is a city of many bridges; a city where much is
               communicated. And the largest communicator in Pittsburgh is
               Ketchum Advertising.
                    We are the bridge for many of Pittsburgh's top corporations: we
               deliver their messages to their audiences, providing sturdy, direct
               passage across the murky waters of markets and trends. We span the
               gap, linking people to people, getting results.
                    Maybe that's why we're so at home in this many-bridged city. We
               can't imagine doing a more important job. Or being in a more important
               place.

Where do we go from here?
                     If you were able to look into the future and see what you might be doing five, ten,
                  fifteen years from now, you might be surprised to find yourself in a career field that is
                  quite distant from your most recent studies or activities.
                     As you develop your career, changes will occur...and you will change and grow
                  with them. And at Delco Electronics, we're structured to help you grow with the
                  changes. We'll place you in a program that will take advantage of your education and
                  your creativity, but you won't stop learning.
                     New technologies, new resources, new demands will require constant learning
                  and sharpening of skills. And while you set your own pace, you'll grow with Delco                  GM, assuming more responsibilities...realizing greater rewards...having more fun.
                     Of course, each career path story is a little different from the next. Every person
                  has his or her own personal goals, ambitions and desires, so your career at Delco
                  Electronics can be completely unique. We're a growing company, so there's room for
                  just about everyone with the knowledge, skills and the professional attitude we're
                  seeking...Let's talk about the future!

OUR TURN
   Though "Behind the Scenes" was an idea of Michele
 McGrogan's (Bob's sister-in-law), it somehow embodied
 the idea we held for our book. The university was done
 "revising" itself and sitting somewhat dormant in lieu
 of major changes to occur during our centennial in
 1987. The plans for drastic policy changes were little
 more than topics at board meetings and aggression
 against these changes had just begun. All the activity
 going on behind closed doors gave us incentive to peer
 more closely away from Pitt's facade.
   Our theme is expressed in many different ways
 throughout the book. Most notably you can see the
 Panther on the cover
 escaping from "behind"
 the  official university
 seal into a world that is
 not-so-official.  Our
 divider pages burst into
 color with some tradi tional shots at the
 university as some not so-traditional scenes
 become visable from
 behind. Within the sec tions themselves, the
 coverage attempts to
 take you behind the
 average to the real.
 Feature stories take you
 into the life of some
 students, each with an
 exciting twist; to the Pro vost's office for an inter view about the 5 year
 plan; a little insight into
 what Pitt might expect in the next few years; and a look
 at some of the individuals who make the Panther
 proud.
 All we have tried to accomplish this year could not
 have been even the least bit imaginable without help.
 We had, this year, a rather small staff, but the few who
 were willing to work hopefully can now look at their
 work with pride, we do.
 There are a few people who deserve some special
 recognition for their assistance was felt the deepest.
 Mr. David Honnold, our Taylor representative, was
 most helpful as our design consultant. Because of him,
our graphics came to life; not to mention the times he
brought us to life with his early morning phone calls.
Dearest Flo Walton, also from Taylor, took over appropriately enough, behind the scenes. She also gave
us inspiration to be more than creative about deadlines,
all the way down to the envelopes. Uncountable thanks
to Lynn from Strem-Varden Studios in Pittsburgh for
listening to pleas of despair and actually being able to
fulfill our needs. Paul Bilgore from Vardens was also
rather heroic in his close save in April. Special thanks
must go to our friends down the hall at The Pitt News
whose work has made the pages of our book more enjoyable with photographs as well as stories.
   Aside from professional assistance we both have a
                            big thank you for some
                            personal favorites. Mom
                            and Dad, we love you.
                            Ellen, we'll be forever in
                            debt to you for your
                            "take charge" attitude
                            that got us through
                            those occasional days
                            we broke into fits of pro                            crastination. Jimmy,
                            thanks for support, it's
                            definitely appreciated.
                            And just a little thank
                            you to Ginny for her
                            guard duties.
                              Now that we've thank                            ed our associates we
                            would like to pat them,
                            as well as ourselves, on
                            the back. The Taylor
                            Publishing Company has
                            selected Panther Prints
'85 as one of their best
university yearbooks. Taylor will be sending samples of
this book around the country to other colleges and
universities. In addition, Taylor has selected portions of
our book to be reproduced in the 1987 Taylor College
and University Design Book, a yearbook comprised of
the best books they publish.
  At this time we realize you will not be receiving your
book as early as originally expected. We hope the extra
time we spent improving the quality of Panther Prints
'85 has been worth your wait.
  The best attribute of a yearbook is that it preserves,
for all time, fond memories; only to return them to you
when you need them the most, in the future. Enjoy!

Homecoming
                     Spirits
          erhaps Pitt's 1984 Home  coming festivities were slightly less
  vibrant than in past years. This was
  evidenced by the less than huge
  turnouts at the various pre-game
  activities. Some die-hard fans would
  argue that the roughly thirty students,
  not counting the band, that showed up
  for the big pep rally was an impressive
  showing for a Thursday night.
  However, these people are few and far
  between. Of course the small turnout
  may well be justified. How wound up
  can thousands of disappointed fans get
  about a football team with a 1-6 record?
    Still, it may not have been school
  spirit, but something was brewing in
  the air throughout those five fine

October days which        comprise
Homecoming week. Yes, the 1984 Pitt
Homecoming certainly had its own
unique "spirit." The main attraction for
students was the mid-week Panther
Prowl through Oakland bars. The emphasis here was not so much in rallying
'round our boys in blue and gold as it
was in rallying'round the bar to down
a few pre-game spirits.
  So the 1984 Panther football team
might have been a bit less than expected. But, if Pitt students found it
tough to get psyched for the big game,
at least they could mourn the team's
losing ways in the spirits of Zelda's,
Danny's, or Peter's.

      n 1921 the University of Pittsburgh inaugurated a Lantern Night
Ceremony    to  welcome    freshman
women to the University. In this
ceremony the freshman women were
given a lantern which symbolized hope
in their search for the light of truth
throughout their college days. The
Panhellenic Association proudly maintains the tradition of this special occasion by recreating the ceremony at the
beginning of each fall term.
  The 1984 Lantern Night was held
Tuesday evening, September 4th in the
Commons Room of the Cathedral of
Learning.
  This fall, once again, the Panhellenic
and Alumnae Associations, in conjunction with the Office of Student Activities and the Student Government
Board, presented    this traditional
ceremony. Sharing in the honor of this
occasion were the Distinguished Alumnae, University Administators, parents

                             Commuter Confusion
           ommute... is defined       in
             Webster's Ninth New Collegiate      TC              (
             Dictionary as: 1) to give in ex-   R   U     C   K
        change for another; 2) to convert (as a
        payment) into another form; and 3) to     R  O    UT     E
        travel back and forth regularly (as bet        ween a suburb and a city). The only ap        plicable definition of commute for the
        Pitt commuter is the latter.
          The disadvantages of commuting
        abound, but to mention only those
        would be unfair. Therefore, the few but
        important advantages must be given an
        honorable mention.
          Disadvantages -  to begin at the
        beginning - include waiting daily for         STOPI                           T
        late buses; waiting in line at the Union       AM.1

        every possible combination of the                H0'UR
        elements of weather; losing precious          Q
        and valuable quarters in the parking          PARKING
        meters; having to put up with mom,              p PN        dad, and the family, and the dog at
        home; having them put up with you;
        and just the all-around hassle.
          Now, the advantages: not having to
        pay room and board to live on or close
        to campus; eating home-cooked meals
        and watching cable TV; living with
        people whom you are accustomed to;
        being able to keep in touch with your
        neighborhood friends; and the "home
        sweet home" atmosphere.
        MULTIPLE ROAD SIGNS are an obstacle'that a
        commuter faces daily.

  Since both sides have been presented
it would be nice to discuss something
helpful such as the "What-to-do-ifyou're-a-commuter-and-you-want-toget-involved" subject.
  Going to an immense school such as
the University of Pittsburgh it is difficult making friends for most commuters. There are frat parties, movies
being shown on campus and sporting
events that a commuter misses simply
because he or she has a bus to catch. It is
imperative that a commuter becomes
involved in clubs and organizations in
order to make friends.
  For those of you who can choose
whether or not to commute, this question should be reviewed and answered:

both shoulders.
  Strange objects can be found in
knap-sacks, some   of which    are:

Making Your Move
LONG LINES AND WAITS for the elevators are
a common occurrence on moving days.
THE FIRST STEPS into residence life begins

B eing a dorm resident meant more
      than just living on campus. For
      the 4,300 students who were
housed in one of the ten resident halls
on campus, it was a way of life. Confined, stressful, and far from private
perhaps, but never boring!
  Adjusting to a strange roommate,
remembering to always carry your I.D.
and room key with you, and developing an appetite for dining hall food are
a few of the initial necessities. Later in
the term you adapt to these frustrations
by investing in a "Walkman," pennying the security doors, and ordering out
for pizza. There was always a way
around the unpleasant or inconvenient.
  Occupied mainly by freshmen, the
co-ed Towers are the most prominent of

you could not find a parking space.
the resident halls on campus. Tower A
and B are all double rooms with 19 and
22 floors respectively, and Tower C, the
smallest of the three, is all single
rooms. Due to the tremendous height
of these buildings, one unavoidable
utility is the elevator. Those unaccustomed to the frequent door jammings, long waits and tasteless graffitti
of the elevators may have second
thoughts before     boarding    one.
Residents, however, grow immune to
the situation soon after their arrival. No
one wants to climb eighteen flights of
stairs with a heavy knapsack unless, of
course, a fire drill demands it. Disregarding their unfavorable appearance, the
elevators are actually one of the most
popular places to     meet people.
Sometimes elevator conversations are
even juicier than the latest soap opera
gossip, and a lot more informative as
well, that is, if you happened to be
clued in as to where the best parties of
the weekend will be!

Dorm Life
ecurity is a main concern of
      residents, and Pitt has an ef      fective system for screening
unwanted guests into its dorms. Each
resident hall is manned by an attendant at a security desk who has control of the entrance. Residents must
show their student I.D. with appropriate housing sticker to be admitted into the building. All others,
including residents of another dorm,
must show proper I.D. and be signed
in as guests. Most consider this
policy a hindrance if nothing else
(especially if you lose your I.D.), but
it's an essential precaution since Pitt
is an entirely urban campus.
  Laundry duty, however, has to be
the worst of the many restrictions
that accompany dorm living. Handicapped with only one laundry room
for all three Towers, it was not an
uncommon sight to find at least a
handful of people in the laundry
room at the wee hours of the morning. But doing laundry was also an
easy way of sprouting friendships as
well.
  Schenley   Quadrangle, or the
Quad, as it is frequently referred to,
is composed of Brackenridge, Bruce,
Holland, McCormick     and  Amos
Halls. These dorms were mostly a
haven for upperclassmen and football players, and Amos Hall is strictly for sorority suites. It was not
unusual to   walk   along  Forbes
Avenue between classes and hear
"Girls Just Wanna Have Fun," blaring from a window above or witness
an  entire  text book   cascading
YOUR DORM ROOM can be as warm and
comfortable as you make it. Students' individuality is shown in their dorm decor.
from a window page by page.
  Lothrop Hall, located on the hill and
adjacent to  Presbyterian University
Hospital, is comprised of all single
rooms. Like all of the other dorms, it
possesses characteristics that are unique
and distinguishable. These include early morning evacuations due to fire
alarms (sometimes even twice a week)
and end-of-the-term food fights which
often resulted in the closing of the
cafeteria.
  Forbes Hall was home for the fortunate few who drew good lottery
numbers. One of the newer dorms,
Forbes is popular for its modern appearance and more spacious living area,
even though it is located away from
central campus.
  With   such  a   concentration  of
students on campus, it was easy to find
a pal willing to join you in a study
break. In order to relieve the frustrations, stress, and solitude of studying,
many students combined forces for a
pick-up  game   of football on   the
Cathedral lawn, frisbee on Flagstaff
Hill, a quick jog through Schenley Park
or a relaxing bicycle ride. And if all else
failed, there was always the late night
trek to the "0" for fries!
  Dorm    living is one    of those
memorable combinations of fun, annoyances, frustration, excitement and
perseverance   that help   to  build
character. We will carry these lasting
impressions and growing experiences
with us for a lifetime.

        Apartment Life - Never a Dull Moment!
        was walking down Forbes Avenue,
        or was it Fifth, the month of my first
        semester at Pitt with a second-year
      student. "I've been looking for the sign
      for a year," she said to me. "And I still
      haven't been able to find it."
        "What sign are you talking about?" I
      asked her.
        "The huge sign that says,'University
        of Pittsburgh' next to an ivy-covered
        stone wall with acres of green grass
      behind it. That is a university."
        No one can deny that Pitt lacks roll        ing lawns and wrought iron fences,
        but, its setting does have nonaesthetic
        positive characteristics. Unless your
        stomach can survive on nine months of
        cafeteria food, and your social life on
        hall parties and movies at David
        Lawrence Auditorium, you will want to
        get to know Oakland.
        Oakland is probably best known to
        students for its array of restaurants and
        bars. You will especially feel right at
        home if you have an affinity for pizza
        and fast food.
        If it's not consumption of food or
        beverage that draws you to Oakland,
        the local museums, theaters and flower
        conservatory offers lots of culture.
        But, for many students Oakland is
        simply a place to live when the dorms
        or commuting from home becomes im        practical or inhibiting. Rental units
        make up 52.8 percent of occupied hous        ing in South Oakland and 76.8 percent
        in North Oakland.
        Living in an apartment can be
        economical and an experience in in        dependence. In the first months of liv        ing in an apartment with two business
        majors I spent hours trying to figure
        out the utility bills. Fortunately, I learn        ed quickly, as it was a job that I assumed
        by default.
        RENTAL UNITS make up 52.8% of occupied

  And, remember all of those winters
that you whined at your father for turning down the thermostat to save
money? Well, there is no doubt that
you will have a roommate that is equally concerned about the "conservation
of natural resources."
  But, if the complaints about who
heard who doing what through their
bedroom wall at three a.m. can be kept
at a minimum, living in an apartment
can be more fun than work.
  No matter who you live with, or
what their lifestyle is, in Oakland you
will never be in poor company because
most of your neighbors will probably
be students, too.
  Living in an apartment in Oakland
does anything but isolate you from
students and friends. Especially, if the
guys upstairs have cable television.

A Day in the Life of...
No matter where you live, each
     place has its advantages and
     disadvantages and living in an
off-campus apartment is no different.
  While you have your independence
from parental and university rules, and
you can come and go as you please, you
have the problem of dealing with
landlords, upkeep, roaches, utility bills,
and roommates (especially the one who
never does any of the dishes).
  Here we show you one happy offcampus resident student -       Jill
Friedman. Jill has lived in her South
Oakland apartment for the three years
she has attended Pitt. Jill loved her
apartment and her roommate of three
years. Says Jill, "He always makes me
feel like a queen." She does admit that
she did have some trouble with a third
roommate during her first term there.
All-in-all, Jill says she could not have
lived in any other housing situation. It
met all her academic and social needs.

Xcellence Without Sacrifice
(X appeared at the Syria Mosque on October 10,
1984. The following article appeared in Showcase
on October 12, 1984.)
C hallenging and simple, a com       bination that seems hardly out
       of reach and yet one that seems
to escape the grasp of most rock'n' roll
bands these days.
  Sure, all they do is play rock'n roll
loud, hard and at the speed of light, but
if you've ever seen X blast their way
through a 25-song set you'd be convinced that's all that need be said.
  Unlike most of the bands that have
emerged  from  L.A.'s seminal club
scene, X has expanded their sound to
include a wide variety of influences.
This has made the band more accessible
while sacrificing little of the band's
challenging stance.
  In all, five new songs were included
in the set, which spread the material
out by choosing almost evenly from the
band's four records. Nothing really
stood out as spectacular, but everything
played with a certain intensity and
sincerity. Exene may, at times, look as if
she's drifting off into
the netherworld and
Billy Zoom often appears more     interested in making
faces at the audience, but
nothing could
overcome the
catalytic effect
of John   Doe
waiting  out
lines from
"White Girl"
or   " Los
Angeles."
  X will never sell many records and
their music will certainly never chang
the world, but if four remarkabl,
albums and    a  challenging  stag,
presence are any indication, this ban
is anything but insignificant.

Every-Song-You-Ever-Wanted-to-Hear
(psychedelic Furs appeared at the Syria Mosque
on Friday, November 2, 1984. The following article appeared in Showcase on November 9, 1984.)
Seven years, four records, three
     producers and  several lineup
     changes   have  brought the
     Psychedelic Furs  full circle.
From a debut record that sounded immediately like an assault on the pop
aesthetic to one of the most pleasantly
listenable Ip's of 1984, the Furs brought
out all the weapons last Friday - none
of which   was  more   armed   and
dangerous than lead singer Richard
Butler.
  Waiting in the wings to ensure a
dramatic entrance, Butler cooly romped
onto the stage to the opening notes of
"Love My Way." Greeting the crowd
with  handshakes  for  those  close
enough to the action and sensual stares
for everybody, Butler transformed the
stage into a personal playground.
  A riveting frontman whose formative
years were obviously influenced by
David Bowie, Butler fed off the Thin
White One
from his
plaid
oversized
kimono
suit to the theatrical body language
which guided every song in what ever
direction he chose to take it.
  The decision to play every-song-youever-wanted-to-hear-from-the-Fursurs
kept the crowd on its feet, but the songs
from Mirror Moves and 1982's Forever
Now seemed the sharpest with John
          Ashton's cacaphonous
                    assault they

If It Ain't Broke, Don't Fixx It!
(The Fixx appeared at the Syria Mosque on
September 6, 1984. The following article appeared in Showcase on September 7, 1984.)
f you've ever listened to a Fixx album
   all the way through, you may have
   gotten the impression that this is a
band struggling to say something very
important. Last night at the Syria Mosque, the struggle continued.
  Before a diminutive crowd, lead
singer   Cy   Curnin's   theatrical
calesthenics coaxed his band through a
set that drew enthusiastic response for
radio-ready numbers like "Red Skies,"
"One Thing Leads To Another" and
their  current single, "Are     We
Ourselves?", yet Curnin's "message"
seemed stronger in   precisely those
songs that the audience was least able
to grab hold of.
  In watching the Fixx work their way
through a generous set of nearly two
dozen songs, there was a striking indifference to those that never made their
way onto the airways. Although many
bands suffer when audiences come only to see hits, the problem for the Fixx is
that they claim to be doing important
things - in spite of being unable to attract much attention to them.
  The Fixx are headlining a tour for the
first time in this country, which will
put them under more
watchful eyes than
ever before. By playing before audiences
that have     come
specifically to  see
them - and not, for
instance, the Police,
who the band opened for last year -
the Fixx may yet
come to appreciate
the vital interaction that goes on bet.
ween a band and its audience. Less time
spent contemplating personal gremlin
that are only of interest under the
direction of a good-looking lead singe,
and a catchy riff might do these
guys a world of good.

       musicians from    around
       the city came together to
help   support the     starving
children in Africa. Pittsburgh Artists for Africa in Concert (PAAC)
was made up of performers from a
variety of different musical tastes,
but all had one cause in mind -
fighting hunger.
  The benefit concert, held at the
Syria Mosque, was an effort to
help not only the USA for Africa
Fund but also the Hunger Action
Coalition of Allegheny County.
All of the musicians donated their
time and energy along with many
local businesses who    donated
everything from refreshments to
the tuning of an acoustic grand
piano.
  With over a dozen musical acts,
as well as the Civic Light Opera
Mini-Stars and the Vann Elementary School Choir, the show provided a nice melting pot of Pittsburgh's musical talents. Radio personalities from  WIXZ, WYEP,
WDSY and others were on hand to
entertain during the short intermissions between acts.
  The only disappointment of the
show was the poor attendance.
The coordinators had hoped to
raise  upwards of $30,000,
however, with an attendance that
may not have reached over 400
they were lucky to cover their
costs.
  Whether the concert was a
financial success or not one thing
is for sure; when it comes to pulling together for a good cause,
Pittsburgh musicians are a fine
PAAC.

Nineteen Hundred Eighty Five.
      The essence of the year lies in the
optimistic prospects it has attributed to
the campus of the future. Having survived the year of the Big Brother and
anxiously awaiting the arrival of our
Bicentennial in 1987, we at the University of Pittsburgh found ourselves midway between two dominating events.
We weren't "caught-in-the middle" so
to speak, yet the year gave us an opportunity to reflect on, our campus as a
whole; its traditions, academics,
resources, and components. As a consequence, this year's Panther Prints staff
went "Behind the Scenes" to capture
the complement of this remarkable
university and give the reader the inside account.
  A University is much more than an
institute of higher learning. It is a
cultural habitat that breeds individuals
with a zest for achievement and provides the environment for fulfillment
of individual goals. For most of us, it is
just as much a social experience and
leaves the graduating senior with a
lifetime of unparalleled memories. Pitt
is no exception, and with an enrollment
of 20,000 students, one can be sure that
each of us has a much more vivid portrait of this university than a faded image of the Cathedral of Learning.
  At present, the mood here at Pitt is
one of healthy confidence; stability.
Even with some unpopular modifications established in the five year plan
and decreases in federal aid to students,
Pitt's enrollment is up from last year
and the University's national stature
and international reputation are both
on the rise.

Fling Into Spring
                 A       pril at Pitt means it's time for
                         the annual spring fling. This
                         year spring fling brought new
                         heights of enjoyment as
                 residents tossed   themselves (and
                 others) around in pudding. The Bar-B                 Que in the Quad gave everyone a
                 chance to break from cafeteria food for
                 the day, and the sports-minded had
                 their hands full with volleyball, soft                 ball, frisbee, hockey, tug-o-war and at
                 least one unofficial game of football.
                 After a long term fighting the harsh
                 winter weather, Pitt's spring   fling
                 promised us all that we were almost
                 finished. Now on to finals.

              Friends Make Life More Bearable
         I t was a day in which friends, fun,
           and smiles abounded, and happiness
           filled the air as the seventh annual
         Hand-in   Hand   festival brought
         together nearly 400 mentally and
         physically handicapped children with
         Pitt student volunteers for a day of
         celebration. The theme for this year's
         festival, "Friends Make Life More
         Bearable," was dramatized by the ob         viously enthusiastic children and their
         captivated audience.
           Traditionally held on the first two
         levels of Forbes Quadrangle, the
         festival consisted of game booths and
         prizes, live entertainment and plenty of
         good food for the children to enjoy
         while being accompanied by a "one-on         one" student volunteer. From 11 a.m. to
         4 p.m. on Saturday, March 30, these
         children were escorted thru a maze of
         people and balloons while they had
         their faces painted, won goldfish, got
         their picture taken and sang along with
         the musical groups present. Not all of
         the children could handle all of this ex         citement so special quiet rooms were
         provided and of course, there were
         plenty of medical staff and trained
         facilitators to help.
           The volunteers themselves had to at         tend an educational session where they                                               /
         learned basic management skills for the
         handicapped such as how to com         municate with the children and what to
         expect when feeding them or what to
         do if someone had a seizure.
           This community service exists to
         break down barriers between the
         handicapped population and the rest of
         the community. It began here in 1979
         with just 75 children but now includes
         over 400 children as well as scores of
         volunteers, facilitators, and sponsors.

Months of work and planning by ambitious Pitt students went into the
festival. The coordinators for this year's
festival were Alan Martello and Rita
Silvestri. They headed a list of ten committees ranging from    computers to
decorations.
  Credit is also due to the many university departments, student groups, and
non-university organizations who contributed to the forty game booths,
prizes, and food for the children. A few
of the booths included: spin art, bean
bag toss, and the petting zoo, provided
by the Brackenridge RSA, Sign Connection, and the Pittsburgh Zoo, respectively. Appearances by Gumby, Chuck
E. Cheese, the Steeler's Terrible Towel,
and our own Pitt Panther, along with
plenty of clowns added more sparkle to
the crowd.
  Trying to generate enough student
interest and participation in the festival
was a major task facing committee
members. Despite the vast amount of
attention that the festival receives, only
about four percent of the student body
are aware and     participate in the
festival. Yet to those who did take part
in the festival, the day couldn't have
been better spent. Joining hands, sharing a hug, and making a friend is what
the festival is all about. Friendship is
one of life's more precious gifts and
those who participated in the festival
had a special opportunity to experience
that miracle.

Working Your Way Through College
W      alk  into  any  Oakland
       restaurant, convenience store,
       or university office and you
will be bound to see a fellow student
working. With the cuts in student aid,
most students could use some extra
cash. Pitt offers a number of jobs for its
students, both during the summer and
through the academic year. For those
not employed by the university, there
are many other jobs available in
Oakland and the surrounding areas.
Some of these jobs are offered through
the Student Employment Office.
  Jobs, while providing well needed
money, take up valuable time from studying and free time. But when you are
putting yourself through school, you
get to learn a valuable lesson: how to
budget your time and money.
