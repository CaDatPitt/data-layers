ing the
Trip Together

As part of the journey through one’s
education at Pitt, a student is faced with

 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
  
 
 

opportunities to join several organizations.
Based on interests and schedules, he chooses
what he wants to be involved in or if he wants
to be involved at all. From special interest
groups, to academic organizations, to sport
clubs, to publications staffs, there is a wide
array of organizations that play an important
role in one’s time at Pitt. What he is involved
in represents his interests and
accomplishments. At the end of his trip, a
student will look back on his involvement and
realize the extent of his education and how
truly important it was.

Joseph Cavalla, the Director of
Student Activities, discusses some
issues that are Vital to the active
student body here at Pitt.

With such a demanding job, Joseph
Cavalla is able to handle the
pressure that he is under.

Student
Actz'z/mes

Student A ctivitie

Oﬂice of Student Actz'm'tz'es boosts campus life

he University of
Pittsburgh is home to many
student organizations that
cover the many different
areas of extra-curricular life.
But have you ever wondered
who is behind all these
student organizations and
what makes them run?

Joe Cavalla is currently the
Director of Student
Activities, with offices in the
William Pitt Union. He
Oversees the operation of
several different areas,
including the operation of
the William Pitt Union,
Greek life, the Black Action
Society, Pitt Program
Council, Student
Government Board,

Emerging Leaders, student
publications, and more than
150 student organizations.

Cavalla is a graduate of
Rider College, where he went
on to become director of
student activities. He came
to Pitt eight years ago. In
addition to 27 years in the
business, Cavalla said, “I
think I have the personality
and the openness to deal
with people. I think I’m fair,
I’m open.”

Cavalla said he sees the
most important part of his
job as being the motivator of
students and staff. “People
have to realize that we as
administrators are open and
accessible to students. People
have to know that they can
come to me or my staff to

ask questions, to work out
concerns, to get involved
with programs, to get advice,
etc. So I think that my
visibility, my support of
people, of programs, covers a
wide range in this area. I
think to be able to balance all
those responsibilities and to
work with a diversity of
students on a day-to-day
basis is a challenge."

The most rewarding aspect
of his job? "I really have to
say, when you see a lot of
programs and a lot of things
be successful. And, not
everything is successful. I
know there are things that
sometimes just fall apart, and
I hope we learn lessons from
that. What I’m really pleased
about is how a lot of people

who, once their days are
done here, they come back
and say what a good time
they had, ‘We learned some
things, we grew.’ I really feel
good about some people who
have gone into the business.
There are some people who
have gone on to graduate
school and now they are
student activities directors.”
He cited the university’s

support for student activities,
such as the renovation of the
Schenley Hotel into today’s
William Pitt Union. “The
University has a
commitment to the extra-
curricular life.”

Activities Office.

Terrence E. Milani,
Ph.D, is an associate
director of student
activities. He is involved
with the management of
financial resources of the
office. He supervises the
business office and the
budgets for the student
organizations. He is also
involved in the
certification process.

Milani said that the
certification process
approves all student
organizations that operate
on campus. It began in
1983, and was essentially
done through student
government. He did
research on court cases
and what found that the
missing ingredient was
what the relationship was
between the group and the

108‘

university. “I found that
the essentials are that you
have to be non-
discriminating in the
nature of your
requirements,” he said.
“You can’t discriminate
against any type of group
once you decide to have it.
You have to treat them
equally.”

The only thing a group
really can’t do is advocate
the violent overthrow of
the government. “They
could not incite imminent
disruption of the campus
and the educational
process. They couldn’t
exist for illegal purposes.
Aside from that, you
pretty much had to allow
groups to exist for
whatever legitimate
purposes, and you had

some rights to create some
standards.”

These minimum
standards include having
at least 10 members and
three officers. There is an
annual renewal process, in
which groups agree to
abide by policy and the
law. This registration
allows groups to have an
exclusive purpose, and to
use the university name.

There are other groups
that get increased funding
and the support of
advisors.

He also runs the new
Center for Public and
Community Service. “It's
really exciting to see it
grow and develop.”

The hardest part? “The
lack of resources available
to do innovative things,”

he replied. “As the budget
crisis unfolds, it causes
shrinking of resources.”

He worked in residence
life at Northern Illinois
University for five years,
and has a master’s in
business administration.
He has been at Pitt for 22
years, and received a Ph.D
in business
administration.

hi Sigma Pi is a co—ed

National Honor Fraternity
that prides itself on three
fundamental concepts:
scholarship, leadership, and
fellowship. The Alpha
Omega Chapter here at the
University of Pittsburgh was
established in September of
1992. We currently have
sixty active members and
through fall and spring
rushes continually expand
our brotherhood. All of our
members have completed at
least one semester as a full-
time student and maintained
a 3.0 QPA. Our brothers
come from diverse fields of
study, yet we all come
together to uphold the

fraternity’s standing tradition
of brotherhood.

As a group, we strive to
make a difference in the
community by carrying out a
variety of service projects.
Our service projects include
anything from the Hand—in—
Hand Festival to Adopting
Streams. Over the course of
the past year, we cleaned
litter from our adopted
highway and stream, worked
on houses in the Habitat for
Humanity, went trick or
treating for canned goods,
Christmas Caroling at
Independence Court, served
lunch at the Ronald
McDonald House, and
visited patients in the VA
Hospital, just to name a few.
While all these projects are
quite social, we have other

events set aside for
fellowship alone.

Each year we attend our
National Convention,
allowing us to socialize with
our brothers from other
chapters, but we do many
other activities with our
chapter alone. These
activities range from all-night
bowling to our annual
formal. We even participate
in university-sponsored
social activities such as the
keg roll, in which teams from
our fraternity placed first,
second and third this year.
All of these events, whether
social or service, bring all of
us closer together and help us
to maintain our balance of
scholarship, leadership, and
fellowship.

the opportunity to build
confidence and become
better citizens with civilian

a stellar academic year filled
with many

accomplishments and

lpha Sigma Lambda is the College of General Studies national honor society. Its
members are dedicated to the advancement of scholarship and leadership while
stressing service to the university and the community.

Students in the College of General Studies are invited to join when they have fulfilled three
requirements: earned a QPA of 3.25, completed at least 30 credits at the University of
Pittsburgh, and earned no previous degree. Initiates are honored annually at Pitt’s Honors
Convocation and the “Excellence in CGS” reception.

ASL members support the CGS Student Government by their participation in the CGS
Open House and submitting articles for the First Degree, the Student Government’s monthly
publication.

ASL members beneﬁt from the social interaction with faculty, advisors and other students
afforded them through two business meetings and a spring banquet, as well as through
committee work. ASL especially appreciates the support given by CGS Interim Dean Robert
Comfort and advisors Dr. Nancy Caplan, Tim Carr and Karrie Valauri.

Another advantage is listening to the speakers chosen to present topics of interest at each
business meeting. In October 1994, Dr. Theodore Windt suggested ways for members to
become better informed voters and urged them to become involved in the political process. In
January 1995, Kevin Collins explained how graduating students can increase their
employment chances by using the many services offered by Pitt’s Placement Service.

For the third year, ASL assisted Big Brothers and Big Sisters with their fund raiser, Bowl-
for-Kids Day, on March 5 by providing lane coordinators.

Student Athletic Trainers Association

n integral aspect of
any athletic team is a good
athletic training staff.
Athletic trainers are involved
in the prevention, evaluation,
management, and
rehabilitation of athletic
injuries. Participation at
every level of athletics is
increasing, and the need for
the specialized heath care for
these individuals is becoming
more evident. Athletic
training education is
providing skilled and
qualified professionals to
attend to the needs of a
fitness-conscious jogger, as
well as the skilled
professional athlete.

Students pursuing the
profession of Athletic
Training at the University of

130‘

Pittsburgh are part of the
Undergraduate Athletic

Training Education Program.

Currently, Pitt is one of only
73 colleges and universities
which offers an
undergraduate education
program approved by the
National Athletic Trainers
Association (NATA).

The athletic training
curriculum prepares students
for a career in the diverse
field of sports medicine. The
program has 35 students
enrolled and is staffed by six
faculty certified athletic
trainers who operate the
University’s Sports Medicine
Program. In addition to the
athletic training curriculum,
the sports medicine program
provides health care services
for the University’s Athletic
Department.

Pitt’s athletic training

curriculum is structured to
provide both academic and
clinical instruction for its
students. The academic
coursework includes such
courses as anatomy, injury,
evaluation and treatment,
human and exercise
physiology, therapeutic
modalities and exercise,
orthopedic problems,
nutrition and health
education. The students’
clinical requirements include
assisting the faculty athletic
trainers and team physicians
in providing sports medicine
services to Pitt’s various
athletic teams, as well as
clinical internships in local
high schools and sports
medicine clinics in he
Pittsburgh area.
The students rotate

through Pitts’ three athletic
training rooms in the football

 

stadium, Fitzgerald
Fieldhouse, and Trees Hall.
Carnegie-Mellon University
is also utilized as a possible
fourth clinical setting to
provide the students with
further athletic training
exposure. In addition to the
athletic training clinical
settings, the students have
the opportunity to observe
both orthopedic surgery and
clinics.

Over the past several
years, Pitt athletic training
students have provided
services to an array of
athletes, including the
Pittsburgh Steelers, the
Pittsburgh marathon runners,
many local high school
athletes, as well as offering
advice to various residents in
the Pittsburgh area. The
increasing exposure of
athletic training has elevated
interest in the profession.
This growing interest in
athletic training, along with
the University’s commitment
to providing optimal care to
its athletes, provides an
excellent opportunity for
continued growth of the
athletic training education
program at the University of
Pittsburgh.

Caribbean and Latin American Student Association

The Caribbeanstudent
Association was founded by
graduate students and faculty
members of the University of
Pittsburgh in 1978. Then, in
1984, undergraduate
students founded the
organization. We have
become increasingly
cognizant of the fact that
CLASA continues to be a
successful organization for
our students and Pitt. This is
more readily apparent
because our organization is
an amalgam of associations
on campus, represented by
individuals of diverse views,
persuasions, and

ambition, and in that respect
continues to work as a
unified body since 1984.

Of paramount importance
is the commitment to
promote educational,
cultural, and social programs
from the Caribbean and
Latin American countries.
These programs emphasize a
broad interdisciplinary
education for strengthening
understandings of world
issues and preparing the
students for membership in
our modern world.

The University of
Pittsburgh’s departments of
political science,

Hispanic languages, and
literature rank among the top
graduate programs in the
United States. This
organization provides the
students the opportunity to
interact with students of
similar heritage. The
organization also provides
information that will
facilitate the transition to the
university and Oakland
community.

There is strong evidence
that suggests that when new
students participate in
cultural organizations, their
chances of transferring to
other schools after the first
year decreases.

he Indian Students

Association is a non-

at the University of
Pittsburgh devoted to the
preservation of Indian
culture. Its aims include,
among others, to educate
those unfamiliar with Indian
culture, with its incredible
diversity, yet underlying
unity. At a time when most
national newscasts portray
the Indian

sub-continent as a land with
constantly bickering religious
factions, we try to prove that
the majority of Indians wish
to exist in harmony with
other faiths. Activities held
throughout the year include
Indian movie/pizza socials,
discussion groups, lectures
from visiting Indian scholars,
and bi-annual cultural
groups, lectures from Visiting
Indian scholars, and biannual
cultural productions to
celebrate two national Indian
holidays that traditionally

bring people of all faiths
together: “Diwali”- the
festival of lights,
celebrated in late October,
and “Holi”— the festival of
colors, celebrated in mid—
March. During these
biannual shows, through
dances, skits, and of
course, cuisine, the Indian

portrays India and its
culture to the entire
Pittsburgh community
without any religious or

Lifetime

When people come to college they see a whole
world in front of them. Yet this whole world
looks similar to Robert Frost’s “The Road Not
Taken,” unknown, empty paths with crowds of
trees everywhere. Freshman year, some choose to
take the road that begins at the Watermelon
Picnic. This particular road was built with
amazing twists and turns of rushing, signing bids,
meeting people, mixers, football games, charity
events, date parties, fundraising, formals, Greek
V‘/eek, sisterhood and brotherhood. Along the
road what they encounter are skills that will serve
them for a lifetime... how to work with people, be
professional, be part of support systems, be
friends. Yet, as they will eventually reach the end
of their road at Pitt, they will never reach the end
of their brotherhood or sisterhood because it is

something that lasts a lifetime.

[My Way, 

The Greek system is as old as our
country and probably as strong.

Some students feel that the Greeks are everywhere and that no matter
what they do, they will not get away from those odd letters. Well, it is
probably true — the Greeks are everywhere and considering the fact that
they are the oldest active student organizations and they date back to the
beginning of our country, it does not seem that they will be going anywhere
too quickly. The first Greek letter society began on the campus of William
and Mary College, Williamsburg, Virginia, in 1776, the year that our
country’s founding fathers signed the Declaration of Independence freeing
the newly formed United States of America from the rule of the British
Monarchy. This group of men named themselves Phi Beta Kappa and today
the members make up the most prestigious national honor society (the
membership has since been opened up to women). Then, in 1870, on the
campus of DePauw University, women took part in the action and began
the first of the familiar Greek letter societies solely for women and named it
Kappa Alpha Theta. These organizations over the centuries have continued
to follow all the traditions of ritual, secrecy, oaths of fidelity, a motto, high
idealism, and the greatest bonds of friendship, that were begun by their
founders. Greeks have stood the test of time in this nation. They have seen
the Revolutionary War, the signing of the Constitution, the Civil War, two
World Wars, the Stock Market Crash of 1929, the Depression, the Korean
War, the Vietnam Conﬂict, the Civil Rights Movement, Communism, the
radical 60’s, the assassinations of Presidents, the death Martin Luther King,
J r., the first man to walk on the moon, the Reagan Era, the fall of
Communism, and the fall of the Berlin Wall. Brothers have stood side by
side; they have fought side by side. Sisters have stood strong and made their
mark on society. One thing always remained . . . sisterhood and
brotherhood. Many famous Americans have been members of fraternities
and sororities. These are people such as, Arthur Ashe, Kevin Costner, Liz
Claiborne, Dr. Suess, John F. Kennedy, Lou Gehrig, Mike Ditka, Lee
Iacocca, Jimmy Buffet and our own Johnny Majors. The Greek system has
been a part of the lives of people spanning from sports to designers to artists
to Presidents and many of these people will attribute much of their success
to the things that they learned from being “Greek.”

So, hop on this ride through history with us and see where Pitt’s Greeks
started and where they’ve been since then.

whizzing through Sorority Rush 1994

It all began way back when an unknowing
student received a little card in the mail from the
University of Pittsburgh. The card was marked,
“Yes, please send me more information about Pitt
Greek Life and Rush.” The unknowing student had
obviously no clue as to what that simple check
mark had begun. It initiated a chain of events that
would continually pique the interest of students
like this one and eventually push them to take part
in Greek Rush. So begins the tale of this particular
Rush Week Veteran and proud member of Pitt’s
Greek System. Before coming to Pitt, my
knowledge of Greeks ranged from misconceptions
of constant toga parties, to the Tri—Delta sisters on
Saturday Night Live. Yet, I made up my mind to
reserve a spot at the Watermelon Picnic, the event
that kicks off the Rush Week festivities. Here
anyone interested receives a vast, but lively
introduction to the twelve sororities and 22
fraternities on Pitt’s campus. I was amazed by the
amount of people; the excitement was intoxicating.
After the initial greetings and “how was your
summers” of the Watermelon Picnic, the pre-rush
events were in full swing. The next rendezvous was
“Meet the Greeks,” an evening that took a more
formal approach to Greek life. It gave interested
students a chance to familiarize themselves with
what each organization is based on in a subdued
setting unlike the circus stunts of the Watermelon
Picnic. The many colors and people, the letters and
symbols, and the various philanthropies were
enough to make anyone’s head spin. Sure, I had
my doubts. Am I “Greek material though?” Do I
have the money for dues? How will I know which
house is the best for me? These are all serious
questions that each person should ask himself or
herself before embarking on the rush journey.

146‘

Yet, no matter how many questions I asked, or
how many times I thought I would not make it
through Rush, one belief prevailed. I knew deep
down there was no getting around the fact that I
wanted to become a link in a strong house.

Then, Rush Week suddenly began. I was on a
roller coaster whizzing through the loops of eating,
talking, listening, and smiling and all with the
utmost sophistication. This concentrated amount
of time consisted of enough commotion and
emotion to fill a lifetime; simply a topsy-turvy
whirl of extremely busy times.

Was it worth it? You had better believe it!
Running through the week, 12 rounds, visiting
each chapter, 8 rounds, learning new things, 4
rounds, meeting great people, preference night,
making decisions. Ugh . . . Finally, Bid Night.
When the last night of Rush Week, Bid Night,
arrived the envelopes silently laid on the tables, as
hearts were loudly pounding in girls’ ears. The Rho
Chis handed out the envelopes as the girls read a
particular sorority’s name. Feelings of happiness,
excitement, anticipation, and relief were
overwhelming. I was convinced that I would not
come down from my high. It is such an honor to be
a member of an inﬂuential, close knit, and
worthwhile organization. The friendships I have
made can help me to overcome any obstacle, big or
small. Right away it is not possible to understand
all of the ins and outs and the goings on of Greek
Life. However, every day I learn something new
and interesting about the uniqueness of it. The best
part is that through all of this hard work, I have
gained some truly great opportunities due to the
Greek System. I have improved my grades,
increased my self confidence, and already made
lasting friendships. The University of Pittsburgh’s
Greek Life is the very symbol of growing in
knowledge, courage, and love.

The Greeks recognize the concerns
presented to them created by today's
sQ(;iety_ Greek 101

This year on October 1, 1994 new members of most of Pitt’s sororities and fraternities attended what is known
as Greek “101.” These anxious groups wondered what Greek “101” was. It took them a long time to find out.

Greek “101” lasted over five hours, which may sound like a fairly long time, but the time went quickly as we
were spending it listening to interesting speakers, learning about the ins and outs of Greek life, and getting to know
one another. Those in charge of the event were well organized and managed to keep the hundreds of new members
under control throughout the event. Cara Appel, Theta Phi Alpha; Matthew Friedman, Delta Tau Delta; and
Joseph Puder, Phi Kappa Theta, were the Over-all Chairpersons for the event. They were in charge of coordinating
the event as well as ﬁnding speakers and handling the registration of all those attending. Also working on their
committees were sisters and brothers from all of the chapters acting as facilitators of the groups arranged, leading
the new members in their schedule that day and answering any questions that they might have had. These
facilitators were lead by Katherine DiPuppo, of Chi Omega, who worked as a chairperson. The keynote speakers
were chosen based on their abilities to tackle issues of college life.

The ﬁrst keynote speaker was Mike Greene, speaking to the audience about alcohol abuse and the consequences
that it could have on a person’s life. He helped students relate by discussing with them his college years and how
alcohol affected his life. His message was able to be heard loud and clear through a interesting, humorous speech
that was based on experience. \

The second keynote speaker present at Greek “101”, Marsha Guenzler, discussed sexual assault, a topic which
should be of concern for everyone, not just women. She spoke about acquaintance rape, and how alcohol is a
common ingredient in many rape cases. She also mentioned the fact that not only do women have to take
precautions when drinking and going out, but men need to take precautions as well, a concept that probably
surprised many of the young men in the audience. “101” was a workshop for new members, introducing them to
Greek life, giving them information on what makes a successful sorority or fraternity and what happens if one does
not act accordingly. Participants were given handouts on fraternal values and ethics, which needed to be followed
in order to succeed. All in all, Greek “101” proved to be a beneficial program instructing us in leadership qualities
and providing us with interesting speakers. Greek “101” was also a time for bonding between new members and a
good chance for getting to know one another. With all these things going for it, Greek “101” was an excellent
introduction to Greek life.

his note—taking while Deanna
Angello listens intently to the
discussion.

Cyrus Zolghadri, Vice President of Phi Sigma Kappa President Dan

the IFC, speaks his mind at the Waters found the President’s
President’s Conference. Conference to be an enlightening
experience.

   

President’s Conference 1995

Each year members of Pitt’s Greek System take time out of their busy schedules to attend the Greek
President’s Conference. The conferences are meant to be both educational and social in nature. Each conference
focuses on issues that are pertinent to the growth and responsibility of the Greek System. When planning of the
current year’s conference begins, the Greek Presidents are asked what topics they feel the Greek System needs to
address and what matters are of concern to the individual chapters. These answers are then the focus in creating
a healthy agenda.

February 18 and 19, the 12 Sorority Presidents, the 19 Fraternity Presidents, 10 Executive Board members,
the 2 Chief Justices of the Judical Boards, the 3 Greek Week Overalls, the IFC Administrative Assistant, the
Chairpersons of New Member Education, the Public Relations Chairperson, and the Advisors of the Greek
System attended the Eleventh Annual President’s Conference. The sessions of this year’s conference were set up
to address both Fraternity and Sorority Rush, Legal Liability, Professional Development, Community Service,
Scholarship, Alcohol and Liablity, Social Policies, New Member Education, and Greek Week. Many of the main
concerns that were focused on were the effects of today’s society on the Greek System; keeping the members safe
and responsible in all of their social and charity events; and the most effective ways to serve the communities of
both the University of Pittsburgh and its surrounding areas.

Some of this year’s more inﬂuencial sessions were IFC Vice-President of Administration George
Raudenbush’s, on the revised IFC social monitering program; Sigma Phi Epsilon Vice-President Jason
Lombardo’s, on the use and abuse of alcohol and the liability which comes with the improper use of alcohol; and
the sessions in which those in attendance were given scenarios dealing with real incidents concerning the Greek
Systems at other schools. They were then asked to tell how they thought the particular university and involved
parties dealt with the situation. The sessions allowed everyone to see that they are not alone in trying to solve the
problems that they face and gave them insight into how to successfully deal with and educate their members on
these problems.

The Greeks strive for excellence in all aspects of
their professional, educational, and social programs.
Now they are rewarded for their efforts.

It is prestigious... It is glamorous... It is an exemplification of excellence... It is the Cathedral Award. Each
year the eligible fraternities and sororities spend hours upon hours putting together a package that screams
success. This package contains everything the fraternity or sorority did in the past year. They are appealing
to a selection committee that have the highest ideals and most excellent programs on Pitt’s campus. After
much deliberation the selection committee chooses the winners of everything from New Member
Education to Alumni Programming. Then, they committee must make an overall consensus as to which
fraternity and which sorority exemplified the highest achievements within the Greek system in the past
year. This year there were many qualified groups up for the many awards, but as we all know so well there
is only one winner. The awards, which were presented at the Greek Week Formal, April 14, 1995, at the
Vista Hotel downtown, were presented to the following groups...

GREEK WEEK 1 995  

Greeks raise $115,000 for Family House, making
Greek Week University's largest charity event

They did it again! The members of the University of Pittsburgh Greek system came together during the eleventh
annual Greek Week in the spirit of competition in order to raise money for the chosen charity, which this year was
Family House.

Family House is a non-profit organization that serves as a “home away from home” for patients and families who
must travel to Pittsburgh hospitals for treatment of life—threatening illness. The Greeks’ donation to Family House is to
be used to help those families who are in need of financial support.

Pitt’s Greeks also make put their commitment in blood, by donating to Central Blood Bank. The blood drive allows
the Greeks a chance to donate three times a year, making the Pitt Greeks the second largest donor, surpassed only by
Westinghouse. To date the Greeks had donated over 23,000 pints of blood, saving an estimated 69,000 lives.

This year’s Greek Week consisted of Greek Sing, where the fraternities and sororities matched up to give the
University of Pittsburgh a spectacular night of singing and dancing. Another event was the 5k/ 3k Run where both
Greeks and independents met at Schenley Park at 9 o’clock in the morning to entertain the people broadcasting live
from the B94 van. Much to their dismay the snow once again decided to come for a brief surprise visit. Then, so that the
Greeks can show off their tug—of—war abilities there was the Fun-n-Games behind the Cathedral of Learning. “Finally,
they danced their feet off, almost literally. Members from many of the houses signed up to dance for 24 hours inthe first
University of Pittsburgh/Family House Dance Marathon. For most it was a grueling event filled with blisters and
exhaustion. Yet, the odds that anyone has easily forgotten the fun, or the “Tootsie Roll,’’ are sure to be very low.

The hard work done by the chapters was recognized at the Formal, where those in attendance danced, ate, and
enjoyed socializing as the winners wer announced and the check for an amazing $113,000 was presented to Family
House. In the honor of that we would like to present to you the winners.

Road to Victory

The Pitt Panthers were on the prowl again
this year, feeling the highs and lows, and
remembering the tears and the cheers. It was

   

a year full of excitement, triumph, and even
some let downs, but more importantly, the
Panthers showed their pride, fighting every
game to the bitter end. Our teams may not
have won every game this year, but they tried
at every battle they faced. A panther is ﬁerce
and powerful, yet wise and calculating. In
victory and in defeat, Pitt sports teams have
lived up to their name in every way. The Pitt
athletes, coaches, trainers, and staff deserve
every bit of respect for themselves and from
all the fans. We are proud to be the
Pittsburgh Panthers.

Being a student at the University of Pittsburgh means different
things to different people. To some, the years here may just be the
beginning of a long academic career, and to others, the time spent
here is an attempt to hold onto the fleeting years of youth. At no
point in the future will you ever be exposed to, and work with such
a diverse group of people. Whether you are about to start paying
rent at the library, or the Union, or whatever place is your second
home, you, like every student, have a life outside the classroom.
That life is influenced by many different people and events, each
of which is unique to every student. Although at times it may seem
that a social life is nonexistent, but it is there. Lurking behind the
books, pizza boxes, and empty soda and beer cans, is a life to which
only students can relate. A life of parties, exams, all—nighters,
friends, and a wide array of activities and commitments. A life in
which priorities are easily changed and rearranged from week to
week.

The years here are hectic, demanding, and at times unbearable,

but for most, it is the best time of their lives.

In moviemaking, the
director is one of the most
integral parts of the process.
This holds true for athletics
as well. When one thinks of
sports at the University of
Pittsburgh, Curtis Martin,
Najuma Fletcher, or Ralph
Willard may be some of the

names which pop into one’s
head. Oval Jaynes, the
Director of Athletics, may
not be the first name which
comes to mind because his
work is primarily behind the
scenes. However, Jaynes,
who takes great pride in

being a part of the University

ﬁor Pittsburgh, is perpetually
working to improve the
university’s athletics.

He is, by no means, a
newcomer to college
campuses. Including his years
as an undergrad, when he
played football and baseball,
as a coach and as an
administrator, Jaynes has
been on a college campus for
almost thirty-seven years.

J aynes’ administration at
Pitt has been a time of
change for the university’s
athletic program. Two of the
most visible decisions of his
program have been the hiring
of Head Football Coach John
Majors and Men’s Head
Basketball Coach Ralph
Willard. Both of these

   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

Those Who Run 3‘t

decisions have brought much
needed change in rebuilding
these athletic programs.

Jaynes’ basic responsibility
is to oversee the entire
intercollegiate athletics
program, monitoring the
activities of each sports
program. The primary goal
of the athletic director,
Jaynes says, is to provide the
coaches with all the support
and resources they need to
do their job. The relationship
between a director and the
coaches is very special. “I
want to be there for them.
The last thing I want to be is
disruptive.”

Oval J aynes is very proud
of Pitt athletics but believes
that the majority of the
teams do not receive the
recognition from the local
paper that they deserve.
Football and men’s
basketball are the two sports
the media tends to focus on,
although there are seventeen
other varsity team sports at
the university. Last year, Pitt
won five Big East
Championship titles in
various sports, and he feels
strongly that most of the
programs are very
competitive.

J aynes will be the first
person to advocate collegiate
athletics, but he also

places a strong emphasis on
academics. He knows that
sports are a lot of fun and
very exciting but realizes that
most of the time, athletic
careers are short lived.

J aynes believes that athletics
and academics go hand in
hand, saying, “We would like
to think that academics are
just as important to them
(players). That the
investment they make in
academics will last them a
lifetime.” J aynes is confident
that through the efforts of
Dr. Ron Brown and
Academic Support Services,
this goal of providing the
athletes with a proper
education is being
accomplished. Last year, 199
out of 436 student athletes
were honored for maintaing
at least a 3.0 GPA. “That’s a
story the media doesn’t tell
but one that we’re proud of,”
explains J aynes.

As for the future, some of

J aynes’ plans for the
university include improving
existing athletic facilities
such as the football stadium
and building new facilities
such as a convocation center
which, he says, will be to the
benefit of the athletes and
the rest of the student body.
J aynes will continue to work
at improving Pitt’s athletics
program, helping to continue
the sports tradition at Pitt.

This football season, the
Pitt Panthers, with the help
of their coach Johnny
Majors, gained some
valuable experience that
helped to rebuild the team
for future success. The home
opener on September 3,
against Texas, proved to be
an exciting game for both
fans and players. The ﬁnal
score after the long battle was
30-28, Texas. On September
10, Pitt hosted Ohio
University. The Panthers
broke a ten-game losing
streak with a 30-16 victory
against the Bobcats. On
September 17, the first away
game took the Panther team
to Ohio State University
where the team, coaches,
students, fans, and
cheerleaders alike felt the
brave 27-3 loss. The
Panthers were home again on
September 24, to welcome
the quality of play that
comes out of the visitor,
Boston College. Although the
team fought hard, Boston
College walked away with a
21-9 win. The Louisville
Cardinals hosted Pitt on
October 1. The Cardinals
gained a 33-29 victory after a
long battle was presented to
them by our Panthers. On
October 8, the football team
was at Syracuse. Pitt walked
away with a 31-7 loss looking
to the future with brighter
hopes. October 15 marked
Pitt’s homecoming and the
87th annual Backyard Brawl
against West Virginia
University. The Panthers
fought hard for a victory, but

the ﬁnal score ended at 47-
41, West Virginia. The
following week on October
22, the Panthers headed for
Virginia Tech. The final
score was 45-7 Virginia
Tech. Although the team was
dismally looking at constant
gray skies, on October 29,
Pitt bounced back with a 45-
19 victory against Temple
University. Pitt’s 45 points
marked the highest game
total in three years, helping
the team to reevaluate their
goals and appreciate their
talents. Then, on November
12, the sun seemed to shine
through as our Panther team
took on the nation’s No. 5-
ranked team at the Orange
Bowl in Miami, Florida. The
team gave the Miami
Hurricanes a run for their
money even though the
Panthers fell in a 17-12
upset. Coach majors was
quoted as saying, “I just

don’t see how I could be any
prouder of a team’s effort . . .
Nobody in our locker room
is happy that we came close.
We thought we could win.”
The players may not have
been happy, but they learned
something from the upset as
they ended the season with
smiles and a 35-21 win over
Rutgers. The team
unfortunately relived the
nightmare of the previous
season’s 3-8 record, but they
made much progress.

The Panthers had a team
mixed with talent,
enthusiasm and heart. They
may have not been able to
pull out every win, but they
certainly were not a team to
scoff at. Standing ovations
are in order for some of
Pitt’s leading players. This
year we watched Curtis
Martin take his place in Pitt
football history as the fifth
all—time leading rusher in
team history, but the
spotlight was cast on another
rusher this season. After
Martin’s injury in the second
game of the season, Billy
West stepped in and ran over
and around defenses all
season long.

West lead the Big East in
rushing with 1358 yards and
earned the Big East most
valuable player of the year
award, honoring him as one
of the nation’s elite. This
sophomore running back
proved his exceptional ability
by rushing for 160 yards
against Miami, one of the
best defenses in college
football, making him the
only running back to pick up
more than 100 yards on
Miami this season. Billy
West came out in the season
to be what Coach Majors
described as, “a whale of a
player.” and he stood his

Let the Good Times Roll

On Friday, October 14, 1994,
Homecoming festivities
began on the Cathedral of
Learning lawn. An obstacle
course for the annual Keg
Roll was ready and waiting.
The contestants, who were
grouped by twos, were at the
starting line ready to

partici ate.

At t e whistle, they were
off. The race began by
gushing an empty keg with a

room followed by a short
tire run. Next, one of the two
people in the groups
proceeded to ”shave” the
other person with a tongue
depressor. To Iproceed to the
next stop on t e course, one
person had to toss two eggs
into a bucket that his
teammate was holding.
Finally, after completing a
short izzy—dizzy, another keg
was rolled across the finish
line.

The honor fraternity, Phi
Sigma Pi, came out the clear
winner with the first three
winning groups being
comprised of its members.
Second place went to the
Alphas and third place went

to the Purple and Gold Posse.

Eric Barr, a sophomore,
exclaimed ”Awesome! I'll do
it every year!" after his team,
the Pi People, were

pronounced the 1994 Keg
Roll Champions.

Later that night, a
fireworks display was
presented by the world
renowned Zambelli
Internationale. Hundred of
s ectators were packed onto
t e William Pitt Union lawn
and Bigelow Boulevard.
Among the spectators was
freshman Stacey Durnell who
exclaimed, ”It’s awesome!" as
she watched the fireworks
light up the sky. Along with
the crowd gathered at the
Union, people were watching
from their dorm rooms,
Forbes Avenue, Schenley
Quad and just about
anywhere. As part of the
unbelievable finale, a
waterfall of fireworks flowed
down from the different
levels of the Cathedral.
Senior Dave Thor exclaimed,
”This is the best I've seen in
years!" Next on the agenda
was Midnight Madness at
Fitzgerald Field House. The
whole first ﬂoor of the
Fieldhouse was anxiously
watching the clock on the
scoreboard in anticipation of
the stroke of midnight. Only
then would both the
women's and men’s
basketball teams be able to
begin practicing, thus

Homecoming 1994  

officially be inning the 1994-
95 basketba 1 season.

To keep the crowd
occupied and interested while
the clock counted down,
many activities took place.
Some of these included
scrimmages between select
men's and women’s
basketball alumni and their
Pitt counterparts, a celebrity
free-throw contest, the Izzy
Dizzy Fraternity Challenge,
Panther Paul Contest,
Shooting for Dollars and the
all new ESPN Dick Vitale
Impersonation contest.

Yancy Thigpen and fellow
Pittsburgh Steeler Eric Green
were among the celebrities at
Midnight Madness. They
readily gave their autographs
to anyone who asked.

Last but not least was the
crownin of the Homecoming
King an Queen during half-
time of the Pitt — West
Virginia football game. The
Homecoming Court
candidates were Frank
LeDonne, Emily Bush, Greg
Simunick, Elizabeth Mania,
Brian Parker, Alison
Ballesteros, Gary Mule,
Laurie Eslinger, George
Ogilvie and Cameron Head.
Crowned as King and Queen
were Greg Simunick and
Elizabeth Mania.

The men’s basketball
team with new Head Coach
Ralph Willard finished the
regular season with the not
so impressive record of 10-
18. However, their record
did not reﬂect the team
overall performance.
Decimated by injuries at the
beginning of the season, the
Panthers fought long and
hard to maintain their
respect. Oval Jaynes, the
Director of Athletics, said,
“This year, basketball was
hurt by injuries but the effort
from the team was
outstanding. We have a new
coach and I think we’re
headed in the right
direction.” Although they
finished with a losing record,
the Panthers lost 6 regular
season games within five
points or less, giving fans an
exciting basketball season.

The Panthers finished their
season on an

 

unexpected high note,
advancing to the quarter
finals of the Big East
Tournament held at Madison
Square Garden. Pitt upset St.
John’s 74-71 and faced the
No. l—seeded Connecticut
Huskies, where the team
played to the bitter end.
When the buzzer sounded,
the scoreboard registered a
loss for Pitt but couldn’t
show the moral victory they
had won. The Panthers gave
UConn all they had and took
them down to the wire.

Pitt will be saying goodbye
to seniors Orlando Antigua,
Chris Gant, and Jaime
Peterson, who all helped in
providing us with an exciting
roller coaster of a season.
With Coach Willard heading
up the team, a strong
recruiting class, and an
enthusiastic and talented
existing team, there are high
hopes for seasons to come.

This season, Jaime
Peterson stepped into the
spotlight on the basketball
court. Taking over for Eric
Mobley at center, Peterson
had some very large shoes to
fill and stepped up to the
challenge. Peterson was
named to the seond team All-
Big East, averaging 13.9
points per game and leading
the team with 9.4 rebounds
per game. Peterson took the
starting position at center
and had to adjust to a new
coaching style. He feels the
arrival of Head Coach Ralph
Willard was a positive
change saying, “Last year we
just went through the
motions. This year he
(Willard) demanded a lot
from you, so we had to come
through.” Last summer,
Peterson worked out hard in
the Dominican Republic

akes down the court.

because he knew he had to
come back ready to do his
thing on the court. After the
summer, he says he just had
a feeling he was going to do
well.

This summer, Peterson
travels to the Dominican
Republic to play in an
international tournament in
trying to get into the
Olympics. He is hopeful for
the future but is taking it all
in stride. Peterson will be
leaving the team this year
and admits he is sad to be
leaving all his boys who will
still be here. “The reason I
basically came to Pitt was
’cause of Jerry McCullough,
but we didn’t get to play our
last year together,” explains
Peterson. For the future,
Peterson will just have to
keep working hard and see if
he can make it to the next
level.

The Team That Went
umeecoquizel)

A team that is worth
watching and talking
about, the Lady
Panthers finished their
94-95 basketball season
in the semi-finals of the
Big East Tournament.
The women’s basketball
team had yet another
reputable season,
registering an overall
record of 17-11. The
Lady Panthers seemed
to be suffering in a way
that the men’s team
was. They lost a couple
of close games which
eventually determined
their post—season play.
Pitt failed to make the
NCAA or the NIT
tournaments, although
Head Coach Kirk Bruce
said the team was not
all that disappointed.
However, the Lady
Panthers were awarded
a spot to compete in the
pre-season NIT
tournament next year.
Coach Bruce and the
rest of the women’s
basketball team is
looking to next year
with high hopes.
Although the squad will
be losing two senior
starters, J enine Joyce
and Carol Morton, five
new recruits have signed
with Pitt, and a talented
core remains.

Carol Morton goygs in for an easy

The Pitt soccer team seemed
overwhelmed with Big East
competition this season,
finishing with a 1-6-1
conference record. Pitt’s only
Big East victory came at the
hands of Providence.

Although the Panthers
ended their season with a
winning record of 9-8-1, the
Big East Games made the
season hard on the fans but,
especially, on the team.

The Panthers underwent a
season of turmoil but played

With five senior players

dealt when Dean Astorino

carry a long and strong tradition at the
University of Pittsburgh. Eleven out of the
past thirteen years, Pitt has claimed the Big
East Championship title. Unfortunately,
this season was one of the two losing years;
although, the team by no means had a

The Panthers finished third in the Big
East Championship as they watched Miami

them. Miami took the title after the men
fell

behind as a result of a false start that costs
them 26 points.

The women’s teams came off a strong
season, placing third in the Big East
Championship. The Lady Panthers’ season
earned Head Coach Mariah Cassidy Kean
the honor of being voted Big East Women’s
Coach of the Year.

The swimming and diving teams are
losing a number of seniors, but there
remains a very talented group of
underclassmen. The teams will be out for
blood next year, ready to reclaim their place
at the top of the conference.

This year, Pitt fans were
exposed to some exciting
gymnastics competition as
the University of Pittsburgh
hosted the ECACS for the
first time. The Lady Panthers
finished fourth and set a
number of new school
records that night, one with
their final overall score and
two on vault. Robyn Senior
led the Panthers at ECACS
with a score which placed
second on Pitt’s All—Time
list. The team then qualified
for the NCAA Regionals,
where they finished sixth
overall. With all of the
members returning next year
and some new freshmen

an even better record.

The men’s gymnastics team
displayed its ability to
compete on a high level this
season. The men finished
their season on a bright note,
winning the North Atlantic
Gymnastics Championships,
then placing fourth at the
ECAC Championships.

The Panthers earned two
of their highest scores of the
year at these meets. The
Panthers have shown they
can consistantly put up the
numbers, and this
consistency was best
exemplified by junior Jason
Lannie, who continually took
the spotlight throughout the
season. At the ECAC’s
Lannie posted a career high
score in all-around
competition.

Unfortunately, although
the team has worked with
great amounts of intensity
and love for the sport, Pitt’s
men’s gymnastic team is one
of the two sports that will be
dropped from next year’s
varsity listing. According to
Title IX, any school that is
federally subsidized much
give equal opportunities to
both men and women. In an
effort to do this, Pitt felt the
need to drop two of the
men’s varsity sports and pick
up a women’s sport. This
included men’s gymnastics
and men’s tennis and
women’s soccer, leaving the
number equal at nine sports
apiece.

We are extremely sorry to
see the team leave, but we
wish the best for those who
competed no matter where
they carry their gymnastics
careers.

The Pitt wrestling teams came off
an excellent season this year, going
where most teams dream of going. At
the end of their season, the Panthers
accomplished a goal which had not
been achieved in 19 years, beating
Penn State.

The team finished their season with
a 14-9 record, setting a single season
record for Pitt Wrestling. Another
record was set by Head Coach Rande
Stottlemyer who became No. 1 on
Pitt’s all-time victory list.

The Panthers sent five wrestlers to
the NCAA tournament, J .J . Fasnacht,
Brett Gould, Bryan Matusic, John
Withrow, and Chad J esko. Fasnacht
and Withrow each earned All-
American honors. The team is
confident that next season will be
even better. With all the players
returning and new recruits coming in,
the Panthers have a good feeling that
next year’s team will be stronger and
more pumped.

The Pitt wrestling team did
something extraordinary this
year as two wrestlers were
named All-Americans. J .J .
Fasnacht and John Withrow
wrestled their way into an
elite class of collegiate
athletes.

Fasnacht, who lives in
Treemont, PA, was a three-
time PIAA state placewinner
in high school. He finished
his high school career at Pine
Grove H.S. with a record of
140-9. Fasnacht admits he
was a worried at the
beginning of this year saying,
“Looking down the schedule,
we had a tough one. I was
looking at January thinkng I
could go winless, but I did
pretty well.” It is not hard to
realize Fasnacht is being
modest. He finished the 94-
95 season with an impressive
record of 33-6 and his Pitt
career record stands at 81-
38-1.

Fasnacht wrestled at the
142-lb. weight class

but decided to drop down to
the 132-lb. weight class for
the NCAA Tournament. He
says this was hard but
thanked God for John
Withrow some days. “When
I didn’t want to do anything,
he’d grab

242 ‘

me and just pound me until I
got a workout,” says J .J .

J .J wants to continue with
wrestling after graduation but
on the other side of the mat.
He plans to be a gym teacher
and coach wrestling at the
high

school level.

John Withrow, who started
wrestling in first grade,
graduated from Elizabeth
Forward H.S., Elizabeth, PA
as a senior, Withrow placed
third in the PIAA state
championship, finishing his
high school career with a
record of

120-25. He graduated with
honors from high school and
has continued to strive for
success at Pitt. Withrow, a
mechanical engineering
major, plans to work with the
medical industry after
college, designing

orthopedic products.
Withrow was happy with
his season this year, but says
he thinks he surprised a lot
of people. “I expected to do
well this year, but I’m not
sure anybody else expected
me to do so well. I don’t
think anyone thought I’d be

an All-American,” he
explains.

The NCAA Tournamnet,
where every match is a big
match, was a incredible
experience for Withrow. “I
just went out thinking, O.K.,
I have just got to win one
match and after that, I just
have to win one more,” he
said of the tournament.
Withrow’s first match was
against a wrestler who had
beaten him twice before in
the season, so after winning
that match he said he rode
an adrenaline high for the
rest of the tournment.

Although it is hard to
continue to compete after
college, Withrow will have an
opportunity to get started in
international competition
this summer. He will be
traveling to Italy with an All-
American team for an
international tournamant.

Withrow, who has two
years of wrestling left at Pitt,
feels very conﬁdent about
next year’s team saying that
they have a good shot at
having the best year any Pitt
wrestling team has ever seen.
As for Fasnacht and
Withrow, we hope they, too,
have their best seasons,
although it will be hard to
top this year.

Pitt's tennis teams work hard despite
heartbreaking news.

The men’s and women’s
tennis teams boasted a solid
season this year. The teams
had their ups and downs but,
overall, should be well
respected for their play.

The Lady Panthers
registered their first ever Big
East win this season after
gunning down Villanova.
The women’s team had a
pleasant surprise with the
addition of freshman Fran
Davis, who played with vigor
and intensity throughout the
long season.

The men’s team, like the
women’s, had trouble with
Big East competition but
showed they have a lot of
talent. Sophomore Braden
Doherty, the No. 1 seed,
shined all season long,
continuing his path of
success and earning the

team-high in singles
competition.

Women’s tennis will
continue to improve as the
team matures in the next few
years. The team and their
fans can look back on this
season as productive as well
as exciting and look
positively towards the future.
Unfortunately, again, the
men’s team has show hard
work and desire; yet, it is
being cut from the fall roster.
The news that both this and
the men’s gymnastics team
are being cut from the fall
varsity roster in order to
follow the demands placed
on the school by Title IX
came through loud and clear
in Oval J aynes’s report
published May 2. We would
like to applaud the men on
the work that they did.

Pitt's baseball team refused to give up. They took
the Big East and went to the NCAA playoffs.

Pitt’s baseball team won
a record 39 games and
advanced to the NCAA
playoffs. The Big East
playoffs began with
pitcher Tedde Campbell
leading the team against
Providence, and playoff
MVP Jon DeBernardis
and Jason Conti getting
key hits.

Trailing 10-3 in the
ninth against Seton Hall,
the Panthers exploded for
eight runs to pull out the

win. A loss to Providence
set up a showdown game.
The Panthers won behind
a complete game from
Kevin Kramer.

In the playoffs at
Nashville, Pitt lost to
Oklahoma State, a
perennial power. The
Panthers battled back to
beat the Citadel and
California.

This set up a re-match
with Oklahoma State.
Down 15-9, the Panthers

continued their season-
long tradition of
comebacks to close the gap
to 15-13, but fell short
there.

“We did better than any
team in the Northeast,”
head Coach Mark Jackson
told The Pitt News. “It
put us on the map as
being a solid baseball
program, and hopefully it
will get us some respect.”

Cowers A, 13, and C

The infamous Towers A,B,
and C are home to many fresh-
men and even some upper-
classmen here at the University
of Pittsburgh. The Towers are
conveniently located in the heart
of Pitt’s campus. Located in be-
tween Fifth and Forbes Ave-
nues, the Towers are a stone’s
throw away from popular hang-
outs such as the Original Hot
Dog Shop, C.J. Barney’s, and
Zelda’s Greenhouse. Also, the
lobby of the Towers is one of the
most popular meeting places for
Pitt students. Located within the
Towers are such places as the
Housing Office, the Meal- Plan
Office, and the Office of Resi-
dence Life. Also, at the conven-
ience of those who live there, the
Tower’s lobby contains the mail-
boxes for the residents of the
Schenley Quadrangle and the
Towers, the Towers Express, a

convenience store, and a laun-
dry room. Underneath Tower
A is located Eddie’s, one of
the most popular eateries on
the Block meal plan, as well as
the C-Side, located under-
neath Tower B.

Those who live in the Tow-
ers reside in pie-shaped
rooms, which conform to the
circular structure of the buil-
dings. Towers A and B con-
tain all double-occupancy
rooms, while Tower C has
only singles. As a result, most-
ly freshmen are subjected to
life in Towers A and B, while
a variety of people — freshmen
and upperclassmen— choose
Tower C. The Towers are gen-
erally considered to be where
people just “end—up” living.
But the Towers aren’t that
bad, are they??

Holland Hall is an all—female dormitory
located in Schenley Quadrangle. It is the
only facility that faces all four of the
other residence halls in the Quad. Hol-
land is divided into two wings: North
and South. It has double accommoda-
tions and common bathrooms and show-
ers. Many of the girls that live there like
the aspect of living in a dorm without
males. It gives them a freedom they don’t
have when they live in the same building
as guys. “I like living with girls. There’s
not a feeling of having to be on display all
the time,” says first-year student Ann
Medico, “I’ve made many good, close
friends that will stay with me my whole
time at Pitt.”

Sutherland Hall, “Home on

dents, is located on upper
campus, away from all the
hustle and bustle. Residents
enjoy the spacious living ac-
commodations and laid-back
atmosphere of this residence
hall, which accommodates
nearly 600 people.

While many non—residents
insist that Sutherland is too
far away from their classes,
residents find no problems
catching a shuttle or simply
walking to lower campus in
the fall and spring months
when the weather is nice.

Many upperclassmen de-
cide to reside at Sutherland
because they can be close to
their classes without being
right in the center of things.

Sutherland also has its own
cafeterias, where during the
week, for just two blocks you
can get a gourmet meal. A
computer lab is another plus
to living in Sutherland. And
for all of you football fans,
some residents say that in-
stead of braving those cold
temperatures on game day,
they open their curtains and
watch the game from the com-
fort of their nice warm rooms.

Forbes ‘Hall

Located among the stores
lining Forbes Avenue in
South Oakland, Forbes Hall is
one of the more unique resi-
dence halls on Pitt’s campus.
It is located approximately
four blocks from Schenley
Quadrangle. The majority of
residents here are upper-
classmen seeking a quieter
place to sleep and study. The
building is divided into two
distinct wings. Kitchenettes
and laundry facilities are lo-
cated in the central areas of all
the floors. It houses approxi-
mately 240 males and females
in four ﬂoors, both lower— and
upperclassmen. Most of the
rooms are double accommo-
dations; however, there are
several triple accommoda-
tions. There are communal

shower facilities in each wing,
as well as study rooms. There
is also a large recreation area
on the second floor.

The third floor of Forbes
Hall is the Wellness Unit for
residents at the University of
Pittsburgh. This area is only
for those students who are in-
terested in not consuming al-
cohol or other substances,
such as nicotine. In the near
future, the University is con-
sidering ideas to put a work-
out area in Lothrop Hall for
those students who either do
not want to battle the crowds
in Trees Hall or are too lazy to
go all the way up the hill, but
then wouldn’t that be a con-
tradiction. These students
choose to live in a chemical
free environment.

Amos

‘Hall

Amos Hall is situated in the heart of Schenley Quad-
rangle. It houses 153 women in sorority suites. Each
ﬂoor has at least one kitchen, one living room,
several bathrooms, and a chapter room. Amos is
almost entirely upperclassmen, but it’s more than
likely you’ll find a freshman “new member” crash-
ing on the couch. Always an added bonus, there are
laundry facilities in the penthouse.

{Bruce ‘Hall

And now, to present the 236-person, co—educational dorm
located in Schenley Quadrangle: Bruce Hall. This dorm is
comprised of either 4-, 5-, 6-, 7-, or 8-person suites.

Each one of the suites has its very own kitchen, and one or
more private bathrooms. Every ﬂoor has its own laundry
facility, and monthly housekeeping services to common suite
areas. As a freshman and a veteran of the Towers, I got jealous
upon hearing this.

Of B1uce’s twelve floors, the first ﬂoor is reserved for a small
lobby, the second a lounge, and the third is all offices. The
seventh ﬂoor is where the Residence Director of Bruce, Mc-
Cormick, and Brackenridge Halls lives.

The eleventh ﬂoor is the International Living Unit “for
students seeking a multicultural living experience.” “The ILU
provides increased interaction with students of various coun-
tries, customs, and beliefs.”

The four RA’s live in the eighth suite on every third ﬂoor. I.
would have to say that the craziest of all the stories I have
heard about Bruce is one particular episode that happened last
fall.

One of the floors had one suite of eight girls while the rest of
the ﬂoor was all guys. Well, the guys chose to participate in a
little battle with these girls, and needless to say there was
always something funny going on.

‘Hall

Brackenridge Hall is a resi-

Quadrangle next to Bruce
Hall. It has three, four, and
five person suites and has
both male and female suites
on each ﬂoor. Each suite has
two room and the four and
five member suites have liv-
ing rooms.

This year, upperclassmen
and a few select freshmen
were able to have the unique
experience of communal liv-
ing in the relative luxury of a

newly renovated building.
The University refurbished
the building during the Sum-
mer of 1994 so that it could
be inhabited in the 1994-95
school year. The students that
lived there seemed to appre-
ciate it. Said sophomore Da-
mon Woods, “The rooms are
absolutely gorgeous! I love the
way the building turned out.
Everything is top—rate and in
great condition.”

the Real World

As you approach the end of college you are
equipped to “Trip out into the Real World!”
Decisions and questions will still remain, but as
a graduate from Pitt you will hold the key to
many of the answers.

As senior year comes to a screeching halt
seniors wonder, “What ’s next?” Will this be
the beginning of yet many more years of
education? Or will you go out into the “Real
World” and find a job? Will you get married
right away or wait a few years?

There are many roads that lie ahead and
each graduate will choose his or her own special
path.

The University of
Pittsburgh / Family House Dance Q
Marathon was held April 7 and 8.
About 500 Students turned out to
dance to raise money for Family
House. Previously, the Dance
Marathon was exclusively a Greek
affair, but this year the option of
participating was open to all
students. Greek participation
however, was successful. Over half
of the dancers and staff that
organized the event were Greek.

Family House was incorporated
in 1986 for patients and their
families who must travel to
Pittsburgh for medical treatment at
hospitals managed or affiliated with
the University of Pittsburgh
Medical Center.

Although, the rates for rooms are
relatively low, Family House will
not turn away anyone who can not
afford a room. That is made
possible by donations and
fundraising efforts such as the
Dance Marathon.

Who is Pitt’s most dedicated supporter? The Pitt
mascot, Richard N. Dodge. Not only does this
individual support the Pitt Panther’s at every game.
he also attends and cheers on every sporting event
that Pitt has to offer. This devoted, enthusiastic
individual will stop at nothing to raise the spirits of
the anxious Pitt fans. A football game just would not
be the same without this individual. Richard’s most
unique experience while being the Pitt Panther was
kicking a field goal at Three Rivers Stadium. The Pitt
Panther also led a “Steeler Pep Rally” at the Civic
Arena with his terrible towel. Not only does Richard
put his heart and soul into supporting Pittsburgh
sporting events as the Pitt Panther, he also is an avid
collector of Steeler memorabilia. Surprisingly, this
Steelers’ fan is from Houston, Texas.

In the past few years Richard also was on the
tennis team for the 1992-1993 season, participated in
RSA in 1992 and worked for WPTS Radio from
1990-1991. Currently, Richard is now employed at
Greater Pittsburgh Convention and Visitors Bureau.
Richard will graduate from Pitt with a major in
English Writing. After graduation he plans to work to
promote the city of Pittsburgh by working in the
tourism business. Richard was also just interviewed
by the Pittsburgh Penguins to be a future mascot.
This individual has shown Pitt true persistence and
dedication from the moment he walked into the
doors as a freshman.

Do you know anyone who was brave
enough to take on 21 credits? Kim
Roarabaugh is a fourth year senior who is
that brave, and took on such a tough load
in order to graduate with two degrees. Her
major is Communication Science Disorders
with a minor in Psychology and if her
schedule was not busy enough, Kim found
time to be on the Pitt Program Council
Travel Committee and also serve as a
Lothrop Hall RA. Kim has also spent time
volunteering at the Eye and Ear Institute,
Veterans Hospital, and the Pittsburgh
Hearing, Speech and Deaf Services. She
was employed by the Student Government
Board for three years, and also participated
in the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast
and Bowel project led by Dr. Fischer that
has been going on for the past 30 years!
Kim’s future aspiration is to attend
graduate school in order to become a
speech pathologist.

Who would have ever imagined that you
could travel abroad to many different
countries and receive credit towards
graduation? Jason Dorfman, originally
from Richboro, PA with a double major in
Japanese and English Writing, spent his
Spring semester, 1993, on the S.S.
Universe. He sailed to the Bahamas,
Venezuela, Brazil, South Africa, Kenya,
India, Malaysia, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and
Japan.

The Semester at Sea trip was only the
beginning of many trips yet to come for
Jason. After he came back he studied in
Kyoto, Japan. After graduation, Jason will
be moving to Japan to work for the Jet
Program. He aspires to someday write a
novel or attend graduate school.

Not only is Jason a world traveler, he is
also very active in his fraternity, Pi
Lambda Phi. He has been a dedicated
member for four years and has served as
archivist and keeper of the stereo. Jason is
also a member of the Golden Key National
Honor Society.

Meet Scott Mahdik, who vividly
remembers the first day of classes his
freshman year as the day he got splashed
by a bus. Needless to say, that experience
did not dampen Scott’s spirits. Scott went
on to join the Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity
where he has held the positions of vice-
president, secretary and pledge educator. In
addition, Scott served as a Greek Week
Blood Drive Chairperson. Scott was also a
member of the Golden Key Honor Society,
Lambda Sigma, Phi Eta Sigma, and Order
of Omega. He played intramural sports and
he has an interest in politics. Scott will be
graduating with a degree in
Economics/Business and is currently
seeking employment.

Who would have thought that an education at
Pitt could take you to far away lands. Danielle
Roe, originally from Crownsville, MD, with a
major of Political Science, was one of the
students selected to attend Semester at Sea in the
fall semester of 1993. While on her voyage
overseas Danielle explored countries including:
Japan, China, Malaysia, India, Egypt, Turkey,
Ukraine, Russia, Greece, and Morocco.

Most people, in their lifetimes, will never travel
to even a few of these countries, but she didn’t
stop there, Danielle spent last summer abroad in
the fascinating Netherlands as a camp counselor.

Danielle was also very active here an the Pitt
homefront. She is a sister of Delta Phi Epsilon
sorority and she served in the positions of Junior
Panhellenic Rep., Panhellenic Chief Justice and
Rho Chi.

Danielle was very active on the Democratic
Woman’s Committee. She served as president of
the Freshman Council. She was involved with the
Government Relations Committee and served on
the Carnegie Museum Advisory board.

Currently, she is serving an internship in the
Study Abroad Ofﬁce. Danielle would like to see
herself in the field of International Relations after
school.

Some have worked their whole life for this day.... Some have
barely worked. But for every graduate, it is the end of a Chapter.

O.K. This is it... You have done it. On April 30, 1995, you
are going to do something that you never have done and
never will do again. You are going to put on a hat that will
slide down the back of your head and a drape with a striking
resemblance to the headgear of the Flying Nun. It will be very
close to the temperature of the Sun’s core in the Civic Arena
and it is funny how you will suddenly start to think of the
Dial commercial. (“Hey man, any closer and you will be on
my lap!”) You are imagining there will be objects being
tossed about, like beach balls (“If that thing spins around me
one more time it is going to look like the bar did last night in
here.”) and hopefully that Organic Chemistry professor with
the help of whom you almost never made it here. Then, as
you walk down the aisle, you have nightmares that you will
trip over the end of your gown and go rocketing through the
air, landing head first in the bass drum, just as your mother
stands up and shrieks, “My Baby!” But, as you lay there in
total embarrassment, we want to congratulate you. Not
because you landed perfectly centered in the bass drum, but
because this is your day. Although we have just made it seem
like the day straight out of hell, it is actually a day for you to
shine. You are the star in many of your parents’ eyes and
they are proud of you. As well they should be, they gave up
nearly their entire life saving and one-fifth of their incomes to
put you through your last four (or six) years of college and

they did not even kill you when you got that underage
drinking citation freshman year. So, let them be proud, and
just put your head down quietly when Aunt Rita’s teeth fall
out during dinner again. Because you have challenged
yourself and the world that had to deal with you as you
learned to walk on your own two feet out in this cold city of
Pittsburgh. You have accomplished so many things during
your times here at the University of Pittsburgh. No one else
is as intelligent, witty, traveled, and ready—to—go as you are at
this moment. On this day, you will be a college graduate.
That is not something that just everyone has the privilege of
doing.

So, as you daydream between the Gas and the McCs think
about all of the things you have done and all the times that
you have had because most likely there is no where else in the
world you will go in your lifetime that you will spend all of
you money and all of your parent’s money, meet more
people, or curse more exam review sessions and all—nighters
in your entire life. And just think . . . this nightmare has only
been an introduction in your rites-of—initiation into the real
world. So, in a final farewell to each and every one of you . . .
you have made your mark and helped to shape this
University; we hope that you come back to tell us what it is
like out there; and we raise our glasses to you . . .
Congratulations to the graduating class of 1995!

From the Editor...

 
 
   
   
    
   
  
   
     
  

with it two messages. The first meaning of
“What A Long, Strange Trip It’s Been,” was .
referring to one’s career at Pitt from their first A’
glimpse of the Cathedral of Learning to that ﬁn
walk through the Civic Arena at graduation.
College is a time for growing, changing, and A ,
learning, not just in the classroom, but in life as
well. It can be quite a ride for many. The secon
meaning of this book’s theme was more person ,
It described the yearbook program; where it 
and where we wanted it to be. Even more ‘
importantly, how we were going to get it there.

I would be lying to saw that I expected everything that I found in my path ‘
or that I was totally prepared for the little problems that always seem to rear f
their ugly heads. In the past year I have experienced love, hate, pride, ‘
admiration, disgust, and utter confusion; sometimes all at the same time. ,
What I have learned along the way and the way that I have seen the member‘
of the staff grow over the_past year though is something that can not be taug
anywhere. We seem to be sort of a miracle in the works. We started with one
small computer and two people on staff and grew to a fullscale desktop ‘
publishing program and twenty staff members. We drove ourselves to the .
limit and made it home from an almost eternal existence on Washington
D.C.’s Massachusetts Avenue. Then, desperate to market the book, the g
Pittsburgh Post-Gazette decided to help by throwing us on the front page wit ‘
an article about the Senior Poll. In the midst of all of this and not getting the
publishing program until February, somehow we managed to put out a
yearbook. Despite all this, we will continue along our path, moving step by _
step towards those goals which we have set. Sometimes slowly, sometimes at
the speed of light. Since I am not jumping from this train yet, I’d like to tha 
those along the way. a

To my parents, Mom, Dad, you have taught me about pursuing my dream
reaching my goals, and remaining a lady while doing it. My family, who else 
has four mothers and three fathers? My sisters, you taught me about desire. g
My staff, you all came on board not knowing what to expect. Hey, either did
1. Yet, you stuck with it. You are all beautiful and talented. Jim Rainey, our 3
rep, our tour guide, you always know how to be honest and still pleasantly .
complimentary. Bob Albright, do not lie. You had your doubts. I did. Jim I
Tynen, without you our office would have turned into storage space or even j
worse, become the Pitt News’s. To Cathy, you taught me that all things are '
possible with a little hard work and a lot of love. To Edward, my gloriﬁed
water boy, my sunshine, my true companion, you taught me about setting
your mind on something and not stopping until it’s yours; and what to do
when your stomach is in your toes. Finally, Moiya, we may be hundreds of ;.
miles apart, but you always seem to know when I need to talk. You’ve taught .
me about respecting yourself and others. Where would I have been the past i
ﬁve years without you? Thank you and God Bless you. I love you all. You at.
certainly the wind beneath my wings. 5

All of you who have travelled the wellworn paths of Pitt. This school has
something about it that makes it like no other and brings us all together. In
this book, I wanted to capture that something for you, through your eyes. I
hope that I did your school justice and you enjoy it, as much as I have
enjoyed creating it for you, as you pass through its pages and the memories
for years to come.

During the school year, Oakland was
a home away from home for many
students. Over the years, Oakland has
been the home of Forbes Field and the
Original Hot Dog Shop. While all that
remains of Forbes Field is homeplate,
the O is still in operation.

Besides the O, there are a wide
variety of places and eateries that are
unique to Oakland. Where else could
you get a big sandwich topped with fries
and cole slaw other than Primanti’s and
whoever heard of McDonald’s
Townhouse?

If food is what you craved, then you
couldn’t be too far away from the bars
during happy hour. Free pizza at
Zelda’s and free wings at C.J.’s.

If all else failed, you could have
always ordered a pizza from the many
restaurants that delivered, but only one
gave you special garlic sauce, that would
be Papa John’s.

C.J. Barney’s has everything from
dinner, to a bar, to a downstairs party
room. You can enjoy all types of
social atmosphere.

Not All Fun and Games

When a Hobby Turns Into Reality

To many students, extra-
curricular activities means a
pick-up game of volleyball, a
little two—on—two basketball,
or planning a big party, but
to Andy Wright, Justin
Geever and Pat Bowlinger,
extra—curricular means a
paycheck. These three
young men, who are all Pitt
students, are also members of
the punk~rock band Anti-
Flag. Andy, 19, plays bass
and shares vocals with Justin,
22, who also plays guitar.
Pat, also 22, plays the drums.

The guys in the band are
great friends and roommates.
The neighbors need not
worry just yet, because the
band rarely practices
regularly during the months
its members are in school.
But in the summer, it is a
different story. The guys
practice nearly every day!

Although Anti-Flag has
played on Pitt's campus as
well as the campuses of
Duquesne and Carnegie
Mellon, they do not have any
groupies just

yet, but they do have some
loyal fans. And even though
the band has a couple of 7”
recordings out, and will be
touring both the east and
west coasts, the members are
not really worried about
getting their big break. They
are playing ”for fun and the
fans.” They are just worried
about making enough to keep
going.

If you have not yet
experienced Anti-Flag, you
can catch them in a number
of local bars or in the
neighboring states of Ohio
and New York. Anti—Flag’s
music is also on the recording
”Iron City Punk” in addition
to their own recordings.

THE JOB HUNT GAME

384

Careers have changed in the past
couple of years, and the options that
are open to students have increased
significantly.

While it is true that anyone can
theoretically choose any job and be
successful, there are certain careers
that are in higher demand.

Certain careers will always be in the
lead as far as their importance to the
general population. These careers
include medicine, nursing, law, and
engineering. These professions are
traditional, broad categories, yet
there is room for specialization and
advancement.

For example, those who seek to
pursue a career in medicine can also
explore alternative means by which
to use their knowledge. Physician
executives are physicians who have
had training in economics to some
considerable extent. Physician
executives are concerned with ﬁnding
efficient ways of treating patients
with improving relations between
physicians and the management.

Another external specialty of

medicine is medical law. As a result of
increasing malpractice suits which
sometimes are frivolous and time
consuming, more and more physicians
are going to law school to fight the suits
themselves.

A derivative of medicine, physical
therapy, is also making a profound
impression on young students. Physical
therapy owes its success to the fitness
movement. With more people
exercising, the rate of injury increases.

Law is also a broad category which
recently has been narrowed into two
fields consistant with the 90s. The first
is the rise of lawyers specializing in
computer law. The recent breakthrough
in high technology has made computer
law a fast-growing field. Almost as
rapidly growing is the concept of
immigration law. As a result of an Act
passed in 1986, many companies need
the services for immigration lawyers to
oversee their hiring procedures and the
like.

Just as law and medicine have

changed, so has the field of engineering.

Industrial engineering is rising as a

prominent field because of the
complexity of different business
systems. Electrical and electronic
engineering has become the cornerstone
of the profession because of recent
technological breakthroughs.

In the field of business, accounting
has grown to be one of the fastest
growing professions. Their growth is
due to the fact that many firms and
businesses offer more services, and as a
result, more accountants are needed.

Also, because people are traveling
more, an occupation in the travel
industry would also prove to be
beneficial. One of the fastest growing
careers is that of hospitality
management.

The above are just a few options and
these could easily change within a
couple of years. In choosing a career,
just remember that what should be the
ultimate determining factor is personal
happiness.

Are You Street Smart?
Don't Be A Victim

Not everyone is as prepared against violence as
they should be. Your first defence against violence
is knowledge. You should know that every week in
the United States, a student is murdered on or near
a campus, and that 30 percent of students will be
victims of felonies. More importantly, 80 percent of
student felonies are committed by students on
students, so do not think it could not happen to
you.

Your second defense is to take precautions. If you
are on the street, do not walk alone after dark. Be
alert and stay on populated, well-lighted streets.
Know the location of phones and call boxes and
take self—defense classes.

If you are out after dark, walk on a well-lighted
path and walk with a group if possible. If you have
to walk alone, call the University Police for an
escort or Van-Call for a ride.

If you live at home or in an apartment, ask the
local police to conduct a safety check of your home.
This is a free service. You should also install good
locks in doors and windows (chain are not
considered safe). Do not mention aloud when you
will not be home and likewise, do not advertise that
you will be alone. Make sure to pull your shades or
curtains after dark, and do not give out information
about yourself or make appointments with a
stranger over the phone.

When you are away from home and expect to
return after dark, leave an interior light on. If
someone is at your door, do not open it without
checking to see who it is first. Ask to see

42‘

identification of repair persons, salespeople and
police.

If you live in the dormitories, be careful whom
you speak with. Many attacks start with casual
conversation. Do not be afraid of being rude if
someone or the situation makes you feel
uncomfortable.

If you have a car on campus, walk to it with your
key ready. Always check beneath your car and in
the backseat to make sure no one is hiding there,
and keep the doors locked while driving. You
should also have enough gas in case of an
emergency.

If you are followed by another car, drive to a
police station or other public place — do not drive
home. If your car breaks down far away from help,
stay in the car with the doors locked and windows
closed. Ask people who stop to call the police, your
automobile club, or a friend or family member. Do
not accept a ride if it is offered.

Police officers and tow truck drivers carry
identification. Do not unlock your door or exit the
vehicle until they show you their I.D. through the
glass of your closed window.

If you follow these guidelines, you will not be as
susceptible to violence as you would be if you were

ignorant of them. Above all, trust your gut instincts.

The Facts of Sexual Assault

Sexual Assault is real and it could happen to
anyone. The most frequent form of sexual assault is
rape, and on a college campus, the most frequent
form of rape is acquaintance rape.

Rape occurrs when sexual intercourse is forced
and against the will of the victim. To be classified
as an acquaintance rape, the attacker is someone
that the victim knows — they do not have to be
friends. Acquaintance rape is not considered a
lighter form of rape. The attacker faces the same
criminal charges as in stranger rape. Many
acquaintance rapes on college campuses occur at
fraternity parties or in the dormitories. Usually,
drugs and alcohol play a major role in most
acquaintance rapes.

Although rape is the most frequent of the sexual
crimes, there are others which are equally
punishable. If one person violates another in any
sexual way without consent, it is considered a
crime.

Sexual assault can also occur with no penetration
of the victim. Tearing off a person's clothes against
their will and touching an intimate part of his or
her body is deemed ”sexual battery.”

Sexual harassment, which is usually verbal abuse
of the victim, is also considered sexual assault.

Whenever a person's ability to perform at work or
study is hindered by verbal or physical conduct, it is
sexual harassment and it is wrong.

In any case of sexual assault, the victim tends not to
report the crime. This occurs for various reasons,
some of which include the victim being afraid that her
attacker will harm her again or that she will face
humiliation if the case goes to trial. Not reporting the
incident will then leave a tendency for her assailant
and others to continue to assault other students.

Reporting the crime would be, in fact, beneficial for
the victim. She would receive medical attention and
other services, and it would give her a feeling of
control. Reporting the incident would also speed up
the victim’s recovery. Sexual assault takes on many
forms and is far more common than the statistics
show. With knowledge and support, incidents of
acquaintance rape as well as other sexual assault
crimes can be diminished and the assailants punished.

Reduce, Reuse,
and Recycle

Do you do your share?

Do you recycle? If you do,
do you recycle almost
everything every day or just
when you remember? Do you
buy recycled products? Of
course the answer to the
above questions about
recycling and buying recycled
products should be yes, but
do you know why?

First, you should recycle all
possible materials such as
glass, aluminum, steel

(commonly ”tin" cans),
plastic and paper. These
materials, if not recycled, end
up in a landfill and will
biodegrade slowly if at all.
The second step in the
recycling process is
reprocessing of the material.
This is handled by the
manufacturers which buy
back the materials and make
new products.
The last step of the cycle is

the purchasing of the
recycled products by the
consumer. This final step is
what makes recycling a
success.

In addition to recycling,
one should also make an
effort to reduce and reuse. To
reduce means to not buy
products with unnecessary
packaging or sing1e—use
products. To reuse implies
that you should use an item
over and over instead of just
once.

But why recycle? The
obvious reason to recycle is
America has a growing waste
problem. With the inventions
of disposable products, we
have more trash than we can
handle. Landfills are not the
answer because they do not
expose garbage to light and
air and therefore do not serve
as a biodegrading ground.
The only obvious answer is
to reduce, reuse, and most
importantly recycle our trash.

Some other reasons for
recycling follow:

Recycling aluminum scrap
saves 95 percent of the
energy that would have been
required to make new
aluminum from ore.

Recycling aluminum
reduces associated air
pollution by 95 percent.

Aluminum can recycling
is a closed-loop process, and
used cans can be recycled
and back on store shelves as
new beverage containers in
as little as 90 days.

The average person in the

United States throws away
six pounds of steel cans each
month.

By recycling one ton of
glass, we save the energy
equivalent of nine gallons of
fuel oil.

Each person in the United
States uses about 85 pounds
of glass each year. American
still throw away enough
bottles and jars to fill the
twin towers of New York’s
World Trade Center every
two weeks.

Glass is 100 percent
recyclabe in a true closed-
loop system.

Plastics comprise
approximately 19.9 percent of
the volume in U.S. landfills.

If only 10 percent of
Americans bought products
with less plastic packaging
only 10 percent of the time,
approximately 144 million
pounds of plastic could be
eliminated from our landfills.

Americans use about 5
million tons of plastic wrap
each year, very little of which
is recycled.

Five recycled soft drink
bottles will make enough
fiberfill for a man’s ski jacket.

American throw away 2.5
million plastic bottles every
hour.

A discarded plastic
beverage container has a
longer life expectance than
the person who threw it
away. Although this list is
somewhat extensive, it is by
no means inclusive. Recycling
is an easy solution to a very
real problem which can no
longer be ignored.

The Problem of
Homelessness

You Can Do Something To Help

You have read about them in the

papers and seen them in the streets.

they are the homeless. They dress
in rags and wander the streets.
They talk to themselves and often
times reek of alcohol.

Homeless people are old and
young, men and women. They may
be drug addicts, alcoholics, and / or
sufferers of mental illness, but they
are human beings. They get hot in
the summer and cold in the winter.
They sleep wherever they can hide
for a few hours, and many times
are sick.

You feel sorry for them and
would like to help them, but feel
overwhelmed because you are not
sure anything you could do would
help their situation.

You could, in fact, help. Soup

kitchens and shelters are
constantly looking for volunteers.
In addition, different clothing and
food drives are held almost
weekly around the Pittsburgh
area. By volunteering or donating
clothes or food, you would not
necessarily be solving the
problem, but you would be
helping rather than sitting in
your warm room eating a pizza
thinking how awful it would be
to be homeless.

A volunteer stands on the
lid to close a trunk full of
clothing for the homeless.

The clothing drive for the
homeless filled many bags.

Tracy Endy volunteers at Montefiore Hospital in order to
gain experience in her future career as an occupational
therapist — and for her personal enjoyment.

Better to Give
Than to Receive

Among the countless ways
btudents can give back to the
community 0 Pittsburgh is
by volunteering their time.
Volunteering is a rewarding
experience t at usually takes
no more than a couple of
hours of your time each week
to help others. More often
than not, students volunteer
for their personal benefit, but
sometimes it is useful
experience for a future career.
This is the case for junior
Tracy Endy who volunteers
three hours a week at
Montefiore Hospital.
Currently at Montefiore’s
Occu ational Therapy
Reha ilitation Clinic, she
works with the patients,
helps the therapists, and

organizes the supplies.

Through her volunteering,
Tracy has gained confidence
dealing with patients and
general knowledge of
occupational therapy. Her
experience has also cleared
any doubts about her future
career in occupation therapy.
Tracy would encourage
anyone to volunteer and
stresses that it is ”really good
experience” in dealing with
people.

Some may say that
volunteering is thankless
work, but those that do it
know it is not so. Volunteers
make lasting bonds with
whomever they work with,
and the knowledge that you
helped someone achieve their
goal is more than enough in
return.

 
  
   
  
 
  
   
 
 
 
  
  
 
   
 
 
  
 
 
 
  
  
  

efore Tracy gets to work, she‘ signs her
ame so that the patients will know that
she will be" the volunteer helping them.

One of Tracy's many duties as a volunteer is to
organize the supplies.

The Fearless Ones

City mourns 3 firefighers

On Saturday, February 18, 1995
thousands of uniformed firefighters
congregated at St. Paul's Cathedral in
north Oakland. They hailed from the
Pittsburgh area and from towns and
cities across the country. They
came to honor three Pittsburgh
firefighters who were killed after
being trapped in a blazing house in
Brushton on Tuesday, February 14.

The courageous firefighters were
Patricia A. Conroy, 43, Marc Kolenda,
27, and Capt. Thomas A. Brooks, 42.

Conroy and Kolenda both served
with Engine Co. 8 in East Liberty.
Brooks was with Engine Co. 17 in
Homewood. Conroy, who served for
eight years, and Kolenda, who was
with the department for a year and a
half, died of carbon monoxide
intoxication. Brooks who was on the

force for thirteen years, died of smoke
inhalation. Conroy was the first woman
firefighter of Pittsburgh to die in the line
of duty. The countless firetrucks and
firefighters met at Three Rivers Stadium
and, in a breathtaking processional,
made their way to the Cathedral. The
joint service, which was celebrated by
Catholic Bishop Donald W. Wuerl, was
televised on a local station.
Loudspeakers were placed outside for
those who could not fit into the
Cathedral.

After the Mass was completed, the
thousands of firefighters who were in
attendance marched to the strain of
bagpipes down Fifth Avenue to Soldiers
& Sailors Memorial Hall. (Information

Post-Gazette.)

Newt Gingrich wanted to be speaker of the
House years before he managed to win a
House seat, and he long ago laid plans for
the Republican takeover nest of his

colleaues considered an imossible dream.

Frank Corder, 38, died in what one federal
investigator described as “a pretty pathetic
thing — a final act of desperation.”
President Clinton, his wife and daughter
were not home when Corder’s plane
smashed into a magnolia tree on the South
Lawn.

’s All Politics

President Clinton and Congress had a Very busy year. The
President made progress on the war on crime by signing a $30
million crime law. The law banned many assault firearms;
allowed the death penalty for dozens more federal crimes; and
provided billions of dollars to be provided over six years to
build prisons and hire police.

Another war, this one on health care, saw the end of the
year come without significant health insurance reform. In the
absence of a public outcry, there was insufficient support in
Congress for the Clinton bill, which called for universal
coverage.

Action in the judiciary branch was not slow, however, as
Stephen Breyer was quickly sworn in in privacy at the
Vermont summer home of Chief Iustice William H. Rehnquist
before the public ceremony. Breyer replaced Iustice Harry A.
Blackmun, who retired.

In other political news, Newt Gingrich became speaker of

With troop planes in the air flying toward Haiti, three special U
S. envoys—~former President Jimmy Carter, retired General
Colin Powell and Sen. Sam Nunn—strucl< an eleventh hour
deal with Gen. Raoul Cedras and colleagues.

Chechen rebels have stung the Kremlin with bitter
truths: big is not alwavs better, the desire for
independence is a powerful weapon, and Moscow's
military machine can be made to bleed.

WORLD PEACE:
POSSIBLE?

he civil war in Rwanda began with a

lane crash that killed the president. Before

he year was over another 500,000
Rwandans had been killed and another 2

elative safety of squalid refugee camps in
aire and other neighboring countries.

IS IT

In many countries across the globe, civil unrest was
at an alltime high this year. Compromises could not
be made, people could not work together and, as a
result, civil wars broke out.

The civil war in Rwanda began when President
Juvenal Habyarimana died in a mysterious plane
crash on April 6. This ignited long—simmering tensions
between the Hutu tribe, which comprises 90 percent
of the population, and the Tutsi tribe, which accounts
for 10 percent. A rebel group comprised mainly of
Tutsis had been trying to unseat the president, who
was Hutu. The president's tribe blamed the Tutsis for
his death, and Hutu extremists began a series of mass
killings that a United Nations panel later characterized
as genocide — ”concerted, planned, systematic and
methodical.” The conﬂict in Bosnia began in 1992
when Bosnia’s Serbian minority rebelled against a
decision by Yugoslavia's Muslims and Croats to
secede. After two—and—a—half years of fighting, more
than 200,000 people were dead or missing. Bosnian
Serbs had to contend with NATO air strikes. Also, U.
N. sanctions and diplomacy appeared to put some
distance between the Bosnian Serbs, who rejected an
international peace plan, and their allies in Serbian
Yugoslavia.

A little closer to home was the United States’
involvement in Haiti. The US went to the brink of
invading Haiti, but the country's military rulers
bowed to the United Nations at the last minute and
promised to cede power to the duly elected president
whom they had ousted, ]ean—Bertrand Aristide.

About 21,000 US troops eventually landed on the
island. They were followed by an international force
charged with keeping the peace until Aristide, who
had been in exile in the US, could consolidate control.

Overseas, the Chechen rebels who were
outmanned and outgunned were standing strong
against the Russian army. The furious Russian
attempt to destroy Grozny and topple Chechen
President Dzhokhar Dudayev has only unified the
Chechens, a nation of more than 160 clans usually
feuding among themselves.

Each day, Russia throws more troops and firepower
at the Chechens to no avail. After sending in tens of
thousands of troops, victory eludes the Russians.

Civil war continued to rack Bosnia-
Herzegovina in 1994, despite the efforts of a
United Nations peacekeeping force. The war
was notorious for "ethnic cleansing” — the
successful Serbian campaign to drive Muslims
from northern and eastern Bosnia. Of about 2
million people uprooted by the war, 750,000
were non—Serbs from those areas.

HARDSHIPS AND

HOPE

Cuban refugees faced man hardships that most people
could never imagine. Many did not make it because of storms,
sinking or the U. 8. Coast Guard, which intercepted more
than 1,000 of the craft in one day in earl September. The
ﬂood of migrants receded shortly thereagtler, and the United
States a reed to admit at least 20,000 Cubans a year, which
reverse a 28-year-old policy of not granting Cubans asylum.
In return, Cuban leader Fidel Castro promised to halt the
flight of boat eople. Police gave rafters a few days to get
their crafts of Havana’s beaches and made sure no new ones
were drawn up.

On the other side of the world, Japan's citizens faced their
own hardshi s. The earthquake which hit on January 17,
1995 topple hundred of buildin s, touched off raging fires
and killed more than 5,000 peo e. The country had been
rattled by a series of strong qua es since late December, when
the quake with a magnitude of 7.5 jolted northern Japan.

On a more upbeat note, the leaders of Israel and Jordan,
who both had regarded each other with sus icion for six
decades, shook hands on the South Lawn o the White House.
As a result, peace in the Middle East may be more than just a
dream. The two nations had been enemies since the creation
of Israel in 1948 followin a brief, bitter war between the Jews
and the Arabs. The war rove thousands of Arab Palestinians
into Jordan, creating a class of refugees and deep hatred on
both sides of the river Jordan.

President Clinton, who played host as Rabin and Hussein
signed an agreement, was optimistic. The old enemies, he
said, ”give their people a new currency of hope and the
chance to prosper in a region of peace.”

I‘ E
apan’s nightmare of a disastrous urban
earthquake came true on January 17,

1995 when a powerful quake tore

CHANCELLOR J. DENNIS O’ CONNOR

SPECIAL FOR PANTHER PRINTS YEARBOOK

We began here at Pitt, most of us, four years ago in late summer of 1991. We were new-comers
then, each in our own way acquainting ourselves with the University, finding our way around
campus, finding new friends in our lives. And so I feel a particular kinship with this Class of 1995.
As I say, we began here together.

During these past four years I have come to know a good number of you. Some of you I have been
privileged to teach. I sense in your Class a spirit of altruism, a sense of caring, a desire to make a
difference in the world. I do know you have made a difference in the life of the University of
Pittsburgh. You have indelibly left your mark.

The editors of “Panther Prints” have chosen a theme for your experiences here: “What a Long,
Strange Trip It’s Been.” Actually, I hope it has been somewhat strange, if you think strange as being
opposed to what is conventional or ordinary, as openness to the unknown. At this University, we
desire our students to challenge conventional wisdoms and to do extraordinary things. And I am
very proud of what this Class of 1995 has accomplished during your meaningful, memorable, and
yes, strange trip at our University.

Some memories are incandescent. I am thinking of Nelson Mandela, shortly after his release from
prison in South Africa, standing on stage in Soldiers and Sailors Auditorium and speaking of his
dreams for his country.

Or of Maya Angelou gracing our campus with the beauty and power of her poetry.

Or of Tip O’Neill beguiling us with his tales of behind-the-scenes politics is Massachusetts and
Washington, D.C.

We remember too the brilliant musicianship of our jazz festivals, the scintillating displays of lasers
and fireworks on Homecoming Weekends. We remember surviving Pittburgh’s coldest winter of the
century.

But this Class of 1995 has more than survived at this University, you have thrived here. And now,
as educated women and men, you depart prepared for new and, if all goes well, strange adventures
ahead. I wish you great good fortune.

Wherever you go, you will always be alumni of the University of Pittsburgh and part of our
worldwide family. This University is your home. Come back often.

You are always welcome here.

J. Dennis O’Connor
Chancellor, University of Pittsburgh

C/azmcellor of the Uvzivemiy

From Freshman Orientation to
graduation, life in college is chaotic and
unpredictable. The primary reason to be
in college is to further one’s education,
but time must also be made for fun. Even
though a schedule may look simple on
paper, assignments, activities and parties
make every minute count.

All in all, in today’s world it seems
success has much to do with time
management, the ability to balance
assignments, activities, and recreation in
order to have enough “free time” to do

simple things like eating and sleeping.

Students’ attitudes toward Junior Grace Mitchell, physics
registration are many and varied. major, checks in for registration
Here’s one student’s interpretation.

What do you mean

T

lI;’s Closed ?!?

As students of the
University of Pittsburgh,
there are certain processes
that we must go through
during our years here at
school. One of the more
difficult processes is that of
registering for classes.

The very word,
“registration,” sends chills
down our spines and puts us
in a state of panic. The
thought of standing in long
lines for hours does not
appeal to any of us, but it is
something we must do to get
the classes we want and need
in order to graduate in under
6 years.

“What classes do I take?”
“When should I go and
register?” “How do I do this
anyway?” These are the
frustrating questions that we

Kathryn Gray, senior
business/economics major, waits as
Victoria Oliver, employee, types her
course selections into the computers.

    

To some, the final stage of entering
into the registration office after
selecting courses is one of relief, but
to others it can be a nightmare.
Waiting in line only to discover that
classes are closed can be a very
stressful situation.

Freshmen Karen Zanperini and
Marcy Pecorg wait for their turn to
register.

all ask and they are by no
means easy to answer. But,
with a bit of help, we can get
through this registration hell.

Everyone moans and
groans from the time he
picks up a copy of the
“Schedule of Classes,” to
standing in line at the
Registrar’s office.

Well, if you have just sort
of given up on this wonderful
task, don’t. Have no fear,
help is on the way. The
University has formed a
Registration Design Team. It
has been formed to change
the way registration is done.
They could do this in any
number of ways, some of
which could possibly be
using e—mail to register or
even phoning in desired
classes.

Anything these people do
to change the way
registration is handled will
help to make our lives a bit
easier in the long run. . .
hopefully!

Caffeine Alone

Ah yes, the idiosyncrasies
of studying in college. Did
you ever notice how major
exams always seem to fall on
the same day? It is seemingly
a conspiracy among
professors. Any student can
attest to the many hours
involved in homework and
studying. Most of the time
the long hours of studying
can compensate for the
workload of a college
student, but what about
when too much happens at
once and you get behind?
You pull an all-nighter! An
all-nighter is when you give
up what little time you have
to sleep and convert it into
even more study time. This
tends to cause problems with
coherence, but this is easily
overcome by drinking bottles
of pop or pots of coffee.
Caffeine becomes the
“wonder drug” of choice for
the evening. Many students
spend most of their night in
the library or a computer lab,
and believe it or not even in
a restaurant. Who would
have thought Eat ’n Park

Stocking up on caffine when you are
expecting a long night.

Above: Hillman Library, we all hate
it, but we have all seen it from this
point of view.

Left: Almost asleep on her feet, Liz
Kern spends those last precious
moments gathering material before
Hillman closes.

would be packed at 2:00
AM? All—nighters are usually
pulled because a paper is due
or you have a major exam...
tomorrow.

For whatever reason you
are pulling the all—nighter, I
am sure there are probably
several experiences that we
all share in common. For
example, the numerous
bathroom runs from all of
the liquid you drink. Some
stories I have heard include
getting thrown out of the
library at 2:00 AM,
numerous showers in several
hours time, and a caffeine
hang-over the next day that
was worse than any hang-
over from alcohol. The hang-
over, of course, lasts the
whole day, and to top it off,
when your classes are over
the next day and it is time to
do your homework, all you
can do is just lie in bed and
sleep straight through the
night.

While there are many
different methods of studying
and preparation for classes,
all-nighters are not
recommended. Even so, they
are from time necessary, and
when necessary they do help
to get the job done.

The Obstacles

in the Road

Becky Borghi, frustrated with

think of to get the “correct” answer.

Calculus and Physics are

1101: eVery0ne’s best
subjects, believe it or not.

Where can students get
help for problems in math,
reading, and general study
skills? The answer is
simple the Learning Skills
Center. The Learning
Skills Center, 31 1 William
Pitt Union aids students
in several ways. It
provides undergraduate
teaching assistants (UTA)
to aid students with work
in classes. Students who
don’t have a teaching
assistant in their class
have the opportunity to
participate in individual
and/or group tutoring
sessions. There is help
available for all math
students, but tutoring
sessions are held by
appointment only. A math
computer lab is available
for students who want
extra practice in algebra
and trigonometry.

There are also programs
to help students improve
their reading skills. These
programs range from
diagnostic services to
speed reading courses. To
begin this program, a
student goes through a
reading diagnosis where
an assessment is given to
determine which program
would best suit the
individual, then options
are discussed with the
student about which
program is best and they
are placed there.

The Learning Skills
Center also provides
general study skills
programs. This can be
done in a

six-week workshop series
or on an individual basis.
There are also course
specific study skills
assistance and individual
conferencing for learning
problems.

All services of the
Learning Skills Center are
free to all University of
Pittsburgh students, staff,
and faculty. Services are
offered at many different
day and evening hours to
accommodate most
schedules. The Learning
Skills Center is there to
help students improve
their academic skills.

Most students taking

are familiar with the
Language Lab. On the
ground ﬂoor of the
Cathedral of Learning,
the Language Lab is
equipt with both audio
and Visual material.
Professors often assign
audio or Visual cassettes
to their students to
provide additional

practice of language
skills. These tapes are
often used in
conjunction with a work
book so that the
language can be both
seen and heard, making
language acquisition
easier.

Short Nights

Being a student at the University of Pittsburgh means different
things to different people. To some, the years here may just be the
beginning of a long academic career, and to others, the time spent
here is an attempt to hold onto the fleeting years of youth. At no
point in the future will you ever be exposed to, and work with such
a diverse group of people. Whether you are about to start paying
rent at the library, or the Union, or whatever place is your second
home, you, like every student, have a life outside the classroom.
That life is influenced by many different people and events, each
of which is unique to every student. Although at times it may
seem that a social life is nonexistent, but it is there. Lurking behind
the books, pizza boxes, and empty soda and beer cans, is a life to
which only students can relate. A life of parties, exams, all-nighters,
friends, and a wide array of activities and commitments. A life in
which priorities are easily changed and rearranged from week to
week. The years here are hectic, demanding, and at times

unbearable, but for most, it is the best time of their lives.

Which Way to Take?

The increasing cost 0f education and the impending need
for ftzrthing one ’S education is leaving many students
with nowhere to go, but in debt.

lQi$iu/Lg Oo$t of; Education

All college students and parents know that the cost of higher education is
increasing at an alarming rate. Studies show that these rising costs are
causing a drop in enrollment in colleges and universities across the
country. What is causing this skyrocketing inﬂation? More importantly,
what can be done to alleviate the problems it creates?

There are many causes of increases in tuition. The rising prices of library
materials adds to tuition costs. Also, as food, book, and plane fare costs
increase, so do the number of students that are granted need-based student
aid, which colleges pay. This increases the tuition of all students.

Research colleges like Pitt have the added expense of covering the costs
of their research projects as Federal support declines; these costs are also
passed on for the students to cover. If colleges are to remain competitive in
drawing in new students (who are essential for paying the bills) they must
pay for improved academic and athletic facilities.

Suggestions for solving this problem rely on parents and grandparents to
supply bonds and save the money for their children’s college education.
College is an investment, but even if money is saved from the birth of their
children, paying the bills will still be difficult for most.

—— Is It Worth It?

For doctors and lawyers, grad school is a must. In many ﬁelds such as physical therapy and architecture,
graduate degrees are not yet required, but are becoming increasingly necessary. In the fields of science and
technology, it is becoming apparent that graduate degrees are necessary for promotion.

There are fields, however, in which grad school could be a mistake. Due to high competition, in fields
where there is an overabundance of people, it may be a waste of time and money to further one’s education
beyond a bachelor’s degree.

A large incentive for attending grad school is the salary difference between professionals with
undergraduate degrees versus those with graduate degrees: grad school alumni often receive almost double
the salary of undergrad degree holders.

While location and cost are important concerns in ﬁnding a grad school, a more important factor is
finding a grad school with a good program in your field. It is important that your grad degree come from a
school with a good reputation in your field, or else it may not be worth the time, effort, and money it took
to achieve it.

Although many grad schools accept students directly from college, in many instances it may be profitable
to wait a few years. Waiting a while to enter a grad school and working in your field in the mean time may
save you the expense of getting a master’s degree in a field that you are no longer interested in.

Another issue to consider is whether going to grad school full time is right for you. If paying for grad
school is a prime concern, perhaps working full-time in your field and attending grad school part—time is
your best option. Individual research into the prospects of your career field is necessary to determine that.
One thing is certain — more and more students are finding it necessary to continue their educations in
grad schools. Decisions like this are monumental — they shape our future.
