ing on its Mt. Pleasant site. The building will ini-
tially be used for library and classroom space.
Once a permanent library has been completed the
multipurpose structure can be utilized for other
student services.

By late Spring construction should be under
way for a Science Building, funded by the Gen-

istry, physics, biology and engineering.

In addition to new courses augmenting the cur-

ing and to inform studentsof a teacher’s past performance in a specific course relative to other teachers
at Pitt. The UAR was dedicated to this goal, with the hopeful result of improvements in teaching for

Radio

WPGH, the campus radio station, made great
strides to both attract listeners and interested
personnel. Under the guidance of chief engineer
Frank Mackowik, developing an audience became
possible with the long awaited production facili-
ties. The news director and music director, Tom
McCanby and Ed Shaffer, improved their depart-
ments immensely. The music dept. became very
adept at picking out top albums and singles, as

well as rotating music to prevent stagnation in
programming. News reporting became very effi-
cient in its newscasting and the individual beats
that people covered.

In review, this was the year that WPGH
became involved in the campus and became noted
as the.station that carried campus events before
anyone else.

privileged classes and public plunderers, never lack sympathy with the poor, always remain devoted to
the public welfare, never be satisfied with merely printing the news, always be drastically independent,
never be afraid to attack wrong, whether by predatory plutocracy or predatory poverty.

sity, voter registration drives held in the Pitt dorms, and seminars on County Committee and the Presi-
dency.

ful membership drive and a successful voter registration drive. They have dealt

part of the University Community. Together with the CYD’s, they create a healthy
political atmosphere.

All of the changes that took place in
1974 were not serious ones. For a short
time, Streaking became a favorite pas-
time on campus and across the nation.
But the fad seemed to die out just as
quickly as it started.

                     PHI KAPPA THETA FRATERNITY...
... it all starts with Rush, a time for meeting new people and making new friends...
there's 4616 Bayard, a house full of the greatest bunch of guys, a place to relax and be
yourself, a place to have fun and kick it out on the weekends with the bands, the beer, and
the'bodacious' women... there's something called spirit, a feeling of togetherness, so
that win or lose, "Phi Kaps are tough!".. and there's a love of fraternity that reaches
out into the community - a Christmas party for underprivileged children, a neighborhood
open-house, and the Phi Kap Walk-a-thon for those who can't.. but remember the
good-tymes... the Winter Weekends in the West Virginia Wilderness, a'real bang' for
hikers, climbers, dancers, and drinkers alike.. the toga grain mixer.. reeling at the
blue-grass parties... the'major change' in saving seats at Pitt football games... Haddon Hall and the Luna... Schenley Park Pond... your socks being blown off... then
your shorts... then that historical first streak... all topped off with AA(K Greek
Week... finally there are the individuals, those people who make the fraternity; the
King Rexes, the Great Wazu's, the Raggin' Boody's, the Chuckies and all the other "Cartoons" who experience the brotherhood in the halls of Phi Kappa Theta..

   OWL REPORT
     AAII is a sorority of attractive and interesting girls - interesting because they're interested in all
   aspects of university life. AAHII's such as Melissa Swoager and Karen Mills are found in Studio Theater
   and WPGH, the university radio station. Jo Anna Shimek was Pitt's ping-pong representative at the
   tournament at University of Maryland. Pat Kablack was recently elected to Student Government
   Board. Anita Dec is group commander of the AIR FORCE ROTC. Of the six AAH's in Quo 1adis, three
   have been awarded trips: Marylynne Schwartz is going to New York City, Mary Grace Lakey is going to
   Ireland, and Judy Lawnizak is going to Poland. Also, AATI is very proud of Lyn Crisanti's scholastical
   accomplishments. Lyn is a Chancellor's Scholar and secretary of the American Chemical Society.
     As far as the sorority itself goes - Alpha Delta Pi began the semester with the fury of ru  activi   ties. AAHI is very pleased to announce that 13 is our lucky number, for we have 13 wonderful new
   pledges from freshman rush - the largest pledge class of all sororities on campus.. Fivgirls became
   pledges during upperclass rush. Later in the term, the festivities of ZX Derby Day resulted ina trophy
   for 3rd place. AAII was awarded a trophy for first place float in homecoming celebrations with the co   working fraternity of AEX. In February, AAII was over-all first place winners of b,GAX$1 PEOJE
   PLAY. Many sisters became little sisters such as: Karen Mills for ZBT, Sharon Rustic for AEH, Pat
   McCormick for AIX. And, in general, parties were done with a theme as on Oct. 31st's Masquerade, and
   a Spanky and Our Gang party.
     Yet, sorority involvement does not only apply to fun and amusing outlets, but to a helpful cause.
   Where charity is concerned, we find that it not only begins in the home of AAII, but on the outside.
   Funds raised for the Speech and Hearing Society by raffling off a basketball signed by the Panthers
   were impressively high. And visits to Juvenile Court were greatly njoyed a wjreding. Alpha Delt
   Pi is one of the finest sororities and it's getting better ei er

But there are always some
things that never seem to
change. The World of children,
with their smiling faces and
toys, seem unaffected by the
rapid lifestyle of the modern

Some people look at clouds
For light and truth
  Some people look at monuments
  As sources for Inspiration and Strength
    While others still try to find the answers
      Searching down dark alleys
        Always alone.
We, at Kappa Alpha Theta, feel that clouds
and monuments and dark alleys won't
bring Light, Truth, Inspiration, and Strength.
Only in other people will those traits be found
  Sisterhood forms our eternal bond...

Epilogue
  In thanking people who helped
me, I would like to thank Jeff
Hoffman and Elise Givant, my
business staff. Once again
accurate records were kept for the
Owl.
  Paul Wasilko proved to be my
main man for the second year in a
row. The opening section was
entirely his, and his help with the
other sections was also
invaluable. Many thanks, Paul. I
wish you much luck in your
future endeavors.
  Bobby Camp, Amy Mazzocca
and Gail Minneci comprised my
sports staff. Again, many thanks
girls. I couldn't have done it
without you.
  Events were done by Theresa
Marko and Marianne
Youngworth. Congratulations to
them on having their section of
the book done first.
  I would also like to thank Dave
Sheluga and his staff of fine
photographers. Their work is
evidenced throughout the book.
  Thanks also goes to senior
editors Sylvia Jaros, Diane Roney,
396
and Elaine Musial for a job well
done.
   Thanks to Steve Tarnock and
Dave Langsdale for all their work
on the organizations section. A
word of thanks must also go to
Charlene Jones, Mary Schwarz
Denise Khorey, and Jay Sher for
their work on fraternities and
sororities.
  Karen Krymski must be
thanked for her help in typing the
senior index, and Neisa Orlowitz
must be thanked for her help on
business staff throughout the
year.
Finally I would like to thank
my honey, Kathy, for all her
moral support, and hard work
during the finishing up of the
book. Thanks, Hon!
  Bob Albright came through
again to help publish the book.
Many thanks Bob.
  And special thanks to Sue
Jarrett who designed the cover
and all divider pages.
  To all those who helped me,
thank you once again.

Man has changed through-
out his history, and he must
continue to change, or die.
And because man himself is
constantly evolving, these
changes are difficult to
notice.

A class has graduated, and
another year has been com-
pleted. And despite all the
changes of 1974, a small amount
of individualism still remains.
