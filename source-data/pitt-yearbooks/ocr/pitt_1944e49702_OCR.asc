Foreword

These pages are a pictorial and written account of life at the
University of Pittsburgh‘ in 1943-44, of its student body and faculty
affected by total war.

The days of ﬁve civilian men to every girl are gone. Gone,
too, are all—male Cap and Gown showsgsaucy Pitt Panthers,‘ jammed
elevator rides to high—altitude classes; big—tin1e student politics;
Spring Festival float parades; formals and big-name bands. In
their place are ﬁrst and ground floor classes; hikes to State, Thaw,
and Alumni Halls; professors with heavy civilian and military
schedules; Air Corps and AST’s; Pitt News and Owl ofﬁces sharing
Locker Room 3; smells of chow; busy barber shops; forty eyes
turned left and an accompanying “hrr-ruﬁ”; and soldiers in single
ﬁle walking 03 “gigs” along Heinz Chapel Walk.

But to us who remain campus life is a lot more. It is a spirit
of determiniation to keep alive the ideals of the University: friendly

‘ﬁreside chats, informal conferences with professors, hours of brows-

ing in the libraries or listening to symphonies in the music room,
and participation in University activities. It is also a spirit of
determination to prepare ourselves mentally and physically to
ﬁght for the treasured rights to freedom and happiness.

As you page through this book, casually or carefully, you will
ﬁnd us ﬁrm, determined, proud, and eager. VVe are Pitt—at war.

SCHO0L 0F

“The old order changeth; yielding place to the
new.” lVIost of the medical students are in uniform,
some army, some navy, the boys spend part of their
time caring for the medical needs of the military
stationed at Pitt. All courses have been accelerated,
Vacations have been shortened, classes, textbooks
have taken on a new signiﬁcance . . . all this is new.
But “Bill” is still here. “Bill” is Dr. VVilliam S.
McEllroy, dean of the school and a former Pitt man
himself . . . because of Dr. McEllroy’s sincere interest
in the individual problems of the individual students,
the meds turn to him for guidance. From assistant
instructor to dean, Dr. l\1cEllroy has risen within the
department. He works on the staffs of lVIagee
Hospital, the Children’s Hospital, the Presbyterian
Hospital, and the St. Francis Hospital. All his
spare*(?) time is spent in research... studies of
blood pigment, protein and iron, and anemics.

MEDICINE

W. S. MCELLROY, M. D.

Medical School Faculty

No school can rise above the least man on its faculty! \Vith
that basic concept, the University can be proud of the School
of Medicine, for the men who serve on the medical staff are
the best available in their respective ﬁelds. Headed by Dr.
\Villiam S. NIcEllroy, himself a graduate of the University,
the staff spent last year training students under war-time
conditions. Dr. l\IcEllroy, since his graduation in 1916,
worked at the University as instructor, professor, and assistant
dean of the school of medicine, and has always been the friend
of student and professor.

Year by year, the school has grown in physical equipment
and in student body. The old l\Iellon Institute has became
the home of freshmen and sophomores . . . the new Presby-
terian Hospital, the psychiatry hospital add dignity and strength
to the medical campus.

Today most of the students are in uniform . . . some army,
some navy. Courses have been expedited . . .
trimesters take the place of long summer vaca-
tions A serious note is introduced, for staff
and students alike realize the national need for
doctors. Colonel Albert Smith Dabney is
back . . . he invented a new field ambulance,
picked up a decoration, and headed home to
Pittsburglfs R.0.T.(f. It was he who organized
the first R.O.T.C. medical unit here in 1921.

Basically, the essentials are the same. Dr.
Charles Ziegler and Dr. James Heard are still
inspiring their students. The medical staff now
serves the nation as well as the University.

was fourty-four years ago and now the fraternity
has grown to be the largest in the world. Nu Sigma
Nu came to Pittsburgh when the University was the
VVestern University of Pennsylvania . . . that was
in 1895, and Nu Sigma Nu was the ﬁrst national
fraternity on campus. Today they boast over ﬁve
hundred alumni. The brothers emphasize scholar-
ship, fellowship and character . . . the fellowship
is taken care of at the monthly meetings at the
University Club where the brothers meet to eat,
drink and listen . . . especially to listen to one of
their distinquished alumni speak to them. And twice
a year, Nu Sigma Nu forgets the academic side
of fraternity life and entertains at dinner dances.

Once a month lVIagee Hospital is invaded by ﬁfty-
odd Phi Betas who Come there to meet. For dinners,
they choose the University Club or W'ebster Hall . . .
that is, if it isn’t picnicking weather. Alpha chapter
at Pitt pledges freshmen but usually delays initiation
until their sophomore year.

Some professors admit a student can learn more
in a bull session than in several lectures . . . at that
rate, Phi Betas are on the beam. Every meeting of
this national social fraternity turns into an informal
social gathering where the gang has movies or guest
speakers. Dr. Karl Mennenger, a leading psychia-
trist and alumnus of Phi Beta Pi, was one outstanding
guest. He is the head of the lVIennenger Psychiatric
Clinic in Kansas.

PHI B110 SIGMA

Medical school students look forward to their two
weeks vacation in September only a bit more eagerly
than the Phi Rho Sigs await their dances. l\Iaybe
that special dinner dance was the drawing card that
ﬁlled their pledge membership to its quota during
the lVIarch rushing season.

The members, in uniform or out, meet once a
month to combine business and professional dis-
cussions. Their social speed is tuned to their pro-
fessional background. Guest speakers, often from
the alumni chapter, are frequent visitors and movies
are favorite instruction. (One would almost think the
boys were reluctant to lay aside the scapel and pill
box for a few hours.)

Committee members of the VVar Bond Drive will
point out that the Phi Rho Sigs are near the top
of the list for bond purchases not only by individuals,
but by the treasurer in the fraternity’s name.

SCHINIL 0F NURSING

Dean Ruth Perkins Kuehn hasn’t found her
position as head of the School of Nursing en-
dangered because of the war. Greater than
ever is the demand for nurses and as the cry
Went out for more and more, enrollment of
pre—nursing students showed an upward swing.
Making available all its resources to aid the
school in their program, the University has
adjusted itself to help train the hundreds of
women needed in this war effort. Many of the
girls in the School of Nursing already have
enlisted in the Nurses Cadet Corp. At Magee
Hall, where the girls receive their ﬁnal training,
war has meant hard work to the already am-
bitious group. Duty on the floor has more than
adequately supplemented classroom work.
With the various trust funds increasing daily
that make possible the granting of scholarships
to young «women who want to enter this ﬁeld,
the School of Nursing has gained a permanent
prominence in the University life.

SCHO0L 0F PHARMACY

Under the guidance of their Dean, Dr. C.
Leonard O'Connell, the School of Pharmacy has
rounded up another year of accomplishments.
A leader in many outstanding pharmaceutical
organizations and a former president of Pennsyl-
vania Pharmaceutical Association, Dr.
O'Connell, through his own unselﬁsh service to
the community and his intense devotion to his
chosen profession inspires the men under him.
Realizing the example put before them by their
dean, and their importance to the general war
effort, the pharmaceutical students have really
clamped down with increased studying. To in-
crease their knowledge by actual practice, many
of the boys work as assistants to pharmacists in
various drug stores throughout the community.
In spite of the accelerated program and the
“khaki” rules the students of the school have
surpassed their records of former years.

founded on October 14, 1913 in Massachusetts. The
Delta chapter came to Pittsburgh on April 18, 1918.
Not only do the women of Lambda Kappa Sigma
work to better ﬁt themselves into their profession,
but they occasionally let down their hair and pro-
ceed to socialize. An annual dinner for the alumni
is given by the sorority at the College Club . . . and
the mistletoe season ﬁnds an open party being held
for all the girls in pharmacy school. In the winter
it’s dinners, the theatre and dances . . . in July
picnics and hikes take over. Lambda Kappa Sigma
becomes another signal of the place that women are
taking in the sciences and in the professional world.

KAPPA PSI

Every organization at the University of Pittsburgh
can boast of members serving the war effort. Beta
Kappa Chapter of Kappa Psi, one of the largest
fraternities in the School of Pharmacy, is no exception.
Formerly, the brothers were concerned with the
matter of fact life of any fraternity . . . making
laboratory experiments, reading papers before the
American Pharmaceutical Association, and planning
banner social events. Today, members of Kappa Psi
can be found in the army and the navy. They are
attached to base hospitals in the army; they go over-
seas with hospital units; their fronts are the labora-
tories on ships. Kappa Psi men take care of pre-
scriptions; aid the physicians as far as they are able.
Kappa Psi is participating actively to hurry the day
when peace will come.

RESEARCH BUREAU FOR RETAIL TRAINING

Members of the Research Bureau staff coordinating
Retail Training’s many activities are Bishop Brown,
director; Ruth Branigan, assistant professor in adver-
tising; Elizabeth Sayre, librarian; Fred A. Egmore, Jr.,
associate professor in merchandising; VValter Sobotka,
instructor in applied arts; Mildred Moren, office
manager; Nancy L. Larson, instructor in salesman-
ship and supervisor of service shopping; Albert B.
Smith, Jr., assistant professor in retailing; and
Lillian Friedman, assistant professor in personnel
administration.

The Retail Bureau was founded in another war
year,—1918. Pittsburgh was hitting its stride in
wartime production, a11d the downtown stores were
crowded as they are now. Busy executives realize
now, as they did then, the need for young people
especially trained for store careers.

The aims of the Retail Training Bureau are to give
professional training to those planning to enter
retailing and to those wishing to become more
efﬁcient in the ﬁeld; to train special teachers and
supervisors in retailing; to conduct investigations for
the improvement of methods of selecting, training‘
and supervising the employees in retail stores.

RETAIL TRAINING

In their modern ofﬁces, classrooms and laboratories on the nineteenth floor of the
Cathedral, the students of the Bureau are acquiring a very sound background for store careers.
The courses include advertising, sales promotion, personnel, fashion, industrial design, employ-
ment methods, merchandising, store organization, and labor relations. These activities
reflect the needs of the stores, especially now when the stores are faced with problems concerning
personnel and operating. The staff is working with retailers on solutions and aids for these

. Wartime situations.

The students learn while they earn and their instructors are storewise buyers, copywriters,
employment interviewers, floor managers, and merchandising men. They have the opportunity
to sell, help with window displays, model, and become acquainted with all the backstage
activities of the store, too.

Stores in wartime have an even greater responsibility in educating customers to new
materials and new merchandise, for they must aid in stopping panic buying and hoarding by
explaining shortages and substitutes. In addition to all this, they have taken a vigorous part
in promoting civil and national projects so important in wartime. In line with the govern-
ment’s conservation program, they have used ads, special columns, booklets, radio programs,
and store meetings to advise on the wear and care of clothing and furnishings to make them
last for the duration.

Stores have taken these activities as their patriotic duty and undertaken them with the
same skill and zest that they used before the war in selling. Their dramatic presentations have
proven that good deeds need not be dull.

SCHIIOL 0F APPLIED SGCIAL SCIENCES

Dean Wilber Irvin Newstetter came to the
University to establish the School of Applied Social
Sciences in the fall of 1938. During these ﬁrst ﬁve
years there have been 236 men and women who have
graduated with the degree of Master of Sciences in
Social Administration. Those who are not serving
with the armed forces are employed as Social VVorkers in
case Work agencies, hospitals, settlements, community
centers, the Y.VV.C.A., the Y.M. and VV.H.A., the
Girl Scouts, and Red Cross in this country and
abroad. These students came to the School after
completion of undergraduate Work with a major in
the social sciences from many colleges and universities
in the United States and foreign countries.

A recent development at the University of
Pittsburgh is the plan for a Pre-Social Work Major
in connection with the College and the School of
Business Administration.

SCHO0L 0F LAW

The Law School of the University of Pittsburgh,
founded in 1843 and moved on campus in 1936, has
become an integral part of the University. It carries
on its work by endeavoring to teach law in the “grand
manner” and to make lawyers who will play an
important part in the civic and business life of the
community. This is done in the manner of teaching
u11der the environment and spirit of the University,
with all the University’s social, educational and
cultural advantages. It takes seven years to gain
a law degree, for Pitt is one of the minority who
require college graduation before actual entrance
into Law School.

Although most of the law students are now in
military service, the remaining students under the
supervision of their Dean, Judson Adams Crane, are
following along in accordance with the high standards
set by those men who have gone before them.

Student Faculty Association of years past became
a new organization in the “Pitt at War” set-up.
The Emergency Student Government Committee
took over SFA’s old duties with many innovations.

Now, instead of an entire student representation,
they have invited into their membership men from
different companies of AST. This Student-AST
group makes up the Co-op Committee. The social
committee topped all social events with their after-
football game dances at the Schenley where records
and cokes flowed.

Perhaps you saw some blonde lass with her skirt
supporting a lap of shiny pennies. . . she was
working in the spirit of the Penny Drive. ESGC
collected 22,000 pennies in a short while. The Bond
Drive and the War Fund were very successful
projects and in keeping with the spirit of the day.

Meetings held weekly in the Dean of lVIen’s office
ROBERT R_ CAMPBELL are arranged to discuss business and plan future
programs.

“Oh, give us the man who sings at his work” is
appropriate for the young men and women of the
Heinz Chapel Choir, who ﬁnd time in a war-busy
year to lend their voices for others to enjoy. Cl1rist-
mas Eve, they sang carols at the East End hospitals,
and Air Cadets stationed at the University heard
the choir’s songs on New Year’s l)ay.

Every Sunday afternoon in Heinz Chapel, they
furnished the “relief that music brings" to a congrega-
tion of service men and civilians and sang for student
holiday Services and the Candlelight presentation.

Socially, the choir and its director, Professor
Theodore Finney, had a successful Christmas party
and a trip between semesters. VVeekly practices,
besides beneﬁting the members’ performances, have
also stimulated many friendships.

MEN’S CIIUNCIL

Men's Council means to Pitt men what Senior
Court means to Pitt women. The council’s job,
however, is more than just administering masculine
activities on campus. Freshman Orientation is the
task that requires character, spirit, and a real feeling
for the University. The members in council are
the advisors who take over the job of helping the
new men accustom themselves to Pitt. A high
spot in the program for the newcomers is Honor
Court, held annually in Stephen Foster lVIemorial.
At this time the freshmen men who showed the
greatest advancement in academic studies and
activities are awarded their gold Panther keys.

The book exchange, sponsored in former years to
help students sell used books, had to be discontinued
this year.

MEN’S DEBATE

\Vartime travel conditions didn’t slow down the
spirit of the hIen’s Debate Association one iota—
their program was as full and extensive as ever.
Their varied audiences included the State Peniten-
tiary, the Sewickley Kiwanis Club, Kent College,
and the Rodef Shalom Youth Club.

The Pitt debaters were as enthusiastic about the
biggest local event of the debating season, the annual
High School Debate Tournament, as the high school
student representatives of the twenty-ﬁve high
schools which entered.

VVith an eye to the future, the Association’s
debaters spoke pro and con to their many audiences
about the problems of the post-war world and Inter—
American relations. Their big problem, of course,
was the oﬂicial college debate topic dealing with the
establishment and maintenance of a world police
force.

MEN’S GLEE CLUB

Pitt’s oldest men’s organization is determined to
keep active despite the crucial man shortage here
at home. Under the direction of “Pop” Finney
twenty some men met twice a week to rehearse
either in 3209 Cathedral or among the steam pipes
and meters of the Heinz Chapel basement. Member-
ship is only about half that of a pre-war club, but
these would-be crooners are ﬁlled with the same
amount of spirit that kept a larger club together.

Due to war conditions, Pitt’s Glee Club did not
make any tours during the last year, and it is un-
likely that they will make any extensive trips for
the duration of the war. Their yearly minstrel
show was set aside for this year, and in its stead the
boys worked along with the Pitt Players in their
spring musical comedy.

PITKIN CLUB

Through its aim which is to foster Christian living,

PITT PLAYERS

Pitt Players has a brilliant record of past produc-
tions. They have taken these productions on the
road, presented some at Community Houses, pre-
sented all of them for the student body on campus,
and last year, gave a special performance for the
Air Corps. This year, all facilities and operations
have been curtailed. The number of members was
also li1nite(l because many of the former members
are now in the Armed Services. But when Buell
VVl1itel1ill, Director, called for technical and acting
staffs, he stressed the fact that if people were
interested and willing to work, the obstacles could
be overcome. l\Iass meetings and staff meetings were
held several times each month in preparation for a
review, made up of a number of short skits. The
Writing in the skit was original material; the tech-
nicians were students.

Without music in our lives there is a void that can
not be substituted and with the full realization of
this fact, VVomen’s Choral was formed here at Pitt
in order to increase interest in music and choral
singing. Whether it is by gathering about the organ
at Christmas time to carol, by joining the Men’s
Glee Club in informal sings in the Commons Room,
or by presenting Beaux Arts for the Freshmen; they
induce in themselves and the student body the
beauty of song. Highlighting the year's work is the
Spring Concert which this year had a Chinese theme
with the girl’s singing the musical version of Vachal
Lindsey’s poem the “Chinese Nightingale”.

VVith a purpose such as that of fostering an ap-
preciation of good music in order to serve the Uni-
versity, it can not help but remain a influential part
of our University life.

The aim of the W.S.A. to develop in the college
girl the ability to discuss intelligently the problem
of the world in which she lives, was carried out when
W.S.A. sponsored a series of programs open to the
public with civic leaders of the city as their main
speakers.

Under the auspices of the U. S. Key Center of War
Information, W.S.A. presented programs to various
high schools, women’s clubs, and community groups.
Stress was placed upon Economic problems of peace,
women’s role in war, and peace and new education.

With the help of the Y.W.C.A. they presented
Caritas, and also helped the Women’s Choral with
the Beaux Arts program. Another activity of the
W.S.A. was their representing Pitt in the Inter-City
Discussion League.

W.S.A. has contributed its part to the war effort
by keeping college women abreast to the world
through open discussion.

The YVVCA, ably guided by Dr. Edna Todt Batz,
has fostered happy University living and association
through study, worship, discussion, fellowship, and
social activity. Open to all races and creeds, the
YWCA has concerned itself with coordinating the
interests of different student groups. As a service
organization the YWCA has pioneered in meeting
campus and community needs. The girls have given
their time knitting and collecting clothing for refugees
and war afflicted children. They have worked in
settlement houses, served at Canteens, sold VVar
Bonds, and helped in the World Student Service
Fund campaign. Realizing that victory cannot be
complete without a stable postwar plan, the YWCA
has discussed and planned a program for its members
and for the world community of students. The
YVVCA is helping to prepare students today to be
worthy leaders tomorrow.

EVELYN FERGUSON

Organized at Pitt 24 years ago, the VVomen’s Self
Government Association carried on this year with all
the customs and traditions of pre—war days as well
as their new found duties. The Executive Com-
mittee, presided over by Evelyn Ferguson, met each
Nlonday to broaden plans for the work of its major
committees. The Committee worked with the Com-
mission to improve conditions for Pitt women and
to draw up resolutions for Pitt after its return to
normalcy.

Like every campus organization, W'SGA has become
engulfed in War work. The social committee helped
to sponsor weekly dances for the AST and Sunday
afternoon teas for the soldiers and their parents.
An outstanding social event of the year was the Air
Corps dance given in November for two thousand
cadets and Pitt women. An employment Council
and a VVaI‘ Activities Committee recruited girls for
employment in the Cathedral to relieve the labor
shortage.

This feminine legislature is responsible for the
Senior Queen Coronation, Lantern Nights, the revival
of Inter-Class sings, Freshmen Customs exam, Green-
Armband luncheons, awarding of merit scrolls,
Ofﬁcers Night, the furthering of high school relations,
orientation for transfers, the publication of Vade
Mecum, student housing administration, and student
loans.

VVSGA intends to bring every Pitt wo1nan_ into the
government of school and to make her feel the spirit
of cooperation that is so much a part of Pitt. This
spirit is an aim with regard to the army men stationed
here, the transfer students, and even the visiting
high school girls.

Since the army has taken over the recreation roo111
furnished by the E and l\I Cabinet for the boys at
State Hall, you’ll find the Cabinet members meeting
once a week in a Nationality Room—down from the
hill. For those who look upon the engineer as an
inhabitant from another world, it's nice to know that
they have some sort of organization—which happens
to be the Cabinet. It sponsors a dance each semester
that no engineer would dream of missing and their
smokers are a rare bit of sociability between the
departments. Advisor Summerville had a big part in
the planning of the ﬁrst civilian-ASTP students’
smoker, too. Sports—mushball and basketball leagues
—do their share to keep up the spirit of rivalry among
the groups.

“They're toppers,’ says Dr. Alexander Silverman.
And they have to be tops to maintain the 1.5 that is
required of them. That is not the only high standard
they have to maintain. Forty-ﬁve of their 120 hours
must be in Chemistry; they must take two years of
Physics and Math through Calculus. No snap course.
Besides this, the American Chemical Society, of which
most of the students are affiliates, has stiff require-
ments of its own. The school has changed somewhat
in character since the war. Now nearly half the
enrollment is feminine, but the requirements and
standards have seen little change.

On the social side the Chems, prexied by Dave
Heinz, have taken time out from their books for
skating and bowling parties . . . even Dave Boodman
and lV'Iilton Kcnser, the two top seniors.

LUTHERAN
STUDENT
ASSOCIATION

In following the Lutheran tradition of lending a
helping hand to students, L. S. A. was founded here
at Pitt over twenty-five years ago by the VVomen's
Elissionary Society of Pittsburgh. l\/Ionthly meetings
are held at one or the other of the three schools and
are conducted in agreement with the club’s slogan,
which is “Faith—Food and Fun." Activity this year
was centered mainly on being host of the Eastern Area
Conference of Lutheran Student Association of
America where students from different colleges
throughout the United States participated.

Ever foremost in L. S. A. life is the purpose of
stimulating the interest of students in their faith and
to make it a part of their University life.

Every two weeks during the past year the Inter-

their interests in world problems. This all-student
activity, with programs prepared by the members,
discussed among their subjects “Russia and Postwar
Planning." \Vith Dr. R. L. Branning, their faculty
advisor, the twenty-ﬁve freshman, sophomores, juniors
and seniors, led by Robert Rodden, enjoyed exchang-
ing ideas on world problems and improvement.

In November, Victor Stein, Vince Swegzda, Irma.
Block, and Claire Labbie travelled to Philadelphia to
represent the University at an International Relations
Club convention. Their reports to the group have
made the other members anxious to participate in
more collegiate conventions when transportation
difficulties are solved.

Their scope is great, their membership good, and
the members of the International Relations (‘lub
have plenty of ideas.

Regardless of the many people temporarily missing
from the evening school class rooms during this war
year, a conscientious group of evening school students,
prexied by Leona Robertson, have eagerly supported
the Evening School Association. They serve as a
governing body and are associated with the publica-
tion of the Pitt Evening News.

“To sponsor fellowship and promote the general
welfare of the student body” as their main objective,
ES-A aids in furthering social interests. According to
custom, the group held open house in the Commons
Room at the beginning of the fall and spring semesters.
The many dances and parties of former years have
been considerably cut down due to this war year.

Through the whole-hearted interest of the members,
ESA has established a worthy organization and many
lifc-long friendships.

In spite of the many problems brought about by
the “University gone to war,” the evening students
were determined not to be slighted, and the Pitt
Evening News continued to serve as an expression of
the opinions of the students of the late afternoon and
evening classes. Since most of the staff held full day-
time jobs as well as the classes they were carrying
at the University, meeting deadlines became a serious
race with time.

The paper, under a new editor and with a decreased
staff went to press fewer times this year, but each
sheet covered evening school news thoroughly. The
copy was literally put to bed, for the staff worked into
the night at their office in 2701. The Pitt Evening
News, with typical Pitt persistance, worked to
publish a. sound newspaper.

From battle stations in the Paciﬁc, from hospital
beds in England and North Africa, and from Army
camps within the country, discharged veterans of
VVorld VVar II have come to the comparative calm of
Pitt campus. Early this spring, after a census taken
at the February registration, these men organized
under the direction of Theodore VV. Biddle, dean of
men. Proposed plans were discussed at a dinner
meeting at which members of the military staffs at
Pitt were present. Since then, prexied by lVIarine
Corporal Larry Bogart, who was wounded when the
U.S.S. Hornet went down in the Pacific, the associa-
tion has become an integral part of men’s campus
activities. United by common experiences, the men
will occupy an important position in life at the Uni-
versity, for they will be here for their full college term.

began to use up typewriter ribbon, film, and carbon
paper. "The best ()\VL possible" was the goal . . .
yet the work was begun three months behind schedule,
and the printer’s deadline had been moved up.

was that unknown quantity. Pictures were

MILITARY PIIOGIlAM
AT PITT

 

COL. EDWARD L. KELLY, C.A.C.

War fought in the classroom . . . the University as -a military post. Officers, men . . .

u11ifor1ns of the armed services of the United States. Uniforms marching through the halls

. marching down the streets . . singing kids who have come to the University to learn

to be better soldiers . . . drilling, drilling, studying, living and growing up. Pitt, an instruc-

tion center and a military post . . . the result of December 7, 1941 when a sleeping nation was
angered to action.

All must serve . . . but Pitt needed guidance . . . needed military men to show her how
to convert herself into a pragmatic unit . . . and so Colonel Edward L. Kelly became the com-
manding officer for all military units stationed here. VVith Colonel Kelly was a staff of twenty-
three officers and forty enlisted men . . . a job was done, a good job, for the University was
made ready to train thousands of men.

First came the air corps . . . eager, very young . . . basic training just behind them . . .
lVIajor Earl R. Bartholomew was the C.O. Here the boys wrote themes, studied history and
geography, struggled with math and science . . . gave the Pitt faculty new nicknames of affec-
tion and respect. Physically and mentally disciplined, they were made ready to become flying
officers . . . a determined, molded group becoming a part of the social world at Pitt, the air
corp drained the needed knowledge and then shipped on.

The Army Specialized Training Program, greatest in the number of men here, vied for
attention with the air corps. An elder, more experienced group, the ASTP number meds,
engineers, psychologists, and dents within their ranks . . . they are a part of Pitt, and they
will be a great part of the future of the nation.

Again looking to tomorrow, the Civil Officers’ Training Program provided the brass and
braid which colors the military caste system. The men are picked oﬁicers, ranking from lieu-
tenants to colonels who are becoming reconstruction experts to ﬁgure in the occupied territories.

A few in the Navy V—12 program . . . mostly meds . . . but all of the men, army and
navy, living and working together at Pitt to signify the unity and power of the United States.
In the skies, on the land, or on the seas, men who have been a part of the University are ﬁghting

. and she may be as proud of them as they are proud of her.

BO 0O TO CC

Reserve Officers Training‘ Corps is not the same organization today that it was a year ago
this time. Last :\Iarch, when the government stopped issuing contracts to ROTC units, the
advanced corps consisted of 93 men, and the basic corps numbered 800 men within its ranks.
Now the advanced group is non-existant, and there is a total of barely 125 men in the basic.

Upon reception of the government order last spring, one-third of the seniors reported to
OCS at Fort 1\1onroe in June. Two—thirds of the seniors returned to Pitt  Company D of
the AST, after their basic training, and shipped out for ()(‘.S to Camp Davis in September.

The juniors of the advanced corps, after their basic training, returned to Pitt as the new Conipany
l) in November and were ordered to OCS at Fort Benning in :\[arch.

Instead of the coastal defense and anti-aircraft training that the basic corps used to receive
the men are now being trained along lines tl1at will prove useful in any branch of the service.
All of the traditional ceremonies of the Corps, which were dependent greatly upon the advanced
ROT 7, have been eliminated for the duration. Social activities have been curtailed, and
Scabbard and Blade, iI1 accordance with its contract, has gone inactive till the war is over.

This year Pitt Rifles, honorary fraternity for basic corps men, was com-
posed of only one platoon of thirty men, but their jaunty strut made them easy
enough to pick out of the blue and gold ﬁle of Pitt ROTC uniforms. They’ll
tell you they have a good reason for being—and that is to give cadets training
in military leadership. Extra drill follows ROTC class for them on Saturdays
and they meet each Tuesday during drill hour.

Captain Thomas NI. Bricker, the guiding light of Pitt Rifles, went all out
with them to make the Miniature Military Ball an adequate substitute for
Pitt’s former leading social event. Postwar plans include the re-establishment
of the lVIilitary Ball and the increase in membership to eighty men.

 

MINIATURE
MILITARY BALL

Pitt Rifles’ second annual lVIiniature Military
Ball went high hat Thanksgiving Eve and blew itself
to a turn at the Twentieth Century Club. Chairman
Bill Veenis spun Ursula Halloran out onto the floor
and 195 couples followed to the sweet and swing
tunes of Bill Hinds‘ Orchestra.

The dance was opened to the public this year and
while the cadets attended in traditional ROTC.
uniforms, their dates and outsiders discontinued the
practise of formal dress. The guest of honor was
3/Iajor l\/Ierlin V. \Vills and his wife and Capt. Thomas
G. Bricker who has worked as advisor to the group.

Only the week before the (lance had Company D
returned from basic training and 30 former Rifle
members were kings at the dance that night—<rocky
in their khaki and true products of Pitt Rifles’ training.

CIIIVIPANY A

“A” Company, which consists of two hundred and seven prospective
engineers, is squeezed i11to the eleventh and twelfth floors of the Cathedral of
Learning between E Company above and the Air Corps below. The men of
this company were sent here from camps all over the country, and, in aggregate,
they represent one hundred and twenty—two colleges and thirty-two states.

4;

For some of the men, the slide-rule" work is new, but others are merely
taking up the square roots where they left them before the war. “A" has the
distinction of being visited every morning at reveille by the Officer i11 Charge.
It seems that the boys have a little trouble getting up, which only proves the
old story about the fate of the Army bugler. Company “A" also runs true to
form in that the boys are working‘ like blazes.

"Tooth pullers in khaki”—or as they (-all the1nselves—(‘/o. B. is another
of the newly founded Service programs. The “Dents" have changed a lot
since Captain Baker took a group of hard working and hard living civilians over.
They have now become an efficient military organization with all the trimmings
but barracks life. Despite studies, military courses, physical training, regular
classes, and all their other G.I. activities, the boys have found time to hold a
pair of dances, have a basketball team, drop back to their fraternities, and,
naturally keep the girls busy.

The motto the “Dents" have posted above their orderly room door tells
about their change under army discipline. Now they say, “Throug'h Those
Portals Pass the Best D—Army Dentists in the \Vorl(l".

COMl’ANY C

Company C, the Army’s medical school division, was founded here at
Pitt on June 16, 1943, and has really started to grow up. The fellows are kept
busy, dashing to and from school, attending classes, taking four hours a week
of ealisthentics, and going to military drills. Then, of course, they have to
keep in trim for their Saturday inspections. As they say, “This military
discipline is rough.” Even though there is so little time for extra-curricular
activities, Company C sponsored a dance for the boys at the Edgewood Country
Club on December 18. The Company's ﬁrst graduating class has not had a
chance to see action but after a nine month period of internship the boys will
receive their commissions and be assigned to their various stations.

Company “I)", composed of more than fifty members of Pitt’s First Year
Advanced ROTC, returned to the University last November 13 after 18 weeks
of basic training. Ordered to active duty upon completion of the spring
semester last year, the men left for the New Cumberland Reception (,‘/enter on

7.

June “2.‘§, then one week later were shipped to Fort Eustis, \1rg'inia.

These men have been returned to the University for further academic
training in the School of Engineering under the direction of the AST. All of
the men are awaiting‘ appointment to ()fficer’s C/&lI1(ll(l{ll,6 School as required
by their R()'l‘(7 contracts with the Army.

[184]

CIIMPANY E

Company E was the first of the basic engineering companies to be organized
at Pitt. For two weeks, the men lived at Shadyside in a (1.1. heaven of soft
ball, bunk fatigue, and free time. After a short furlough, they moved to the
12th floor CL, and, guided by Capt. John Finnerty and Sgt. E. R. A. Scofield,
headed into Term 1.

The work was hard, and the Company lost some men at U-‘:I‘111‘S end but
bolstered by the memory of the Company dance at VVebSter Hall, another
furlough, a new C.0., and come new blood from F Company, they launched
into Term 2, sporting green company badges, but pretty much the same old
outﬁt.

The boys don’t know how long they will be here, but hope to stay “for
the sake of the (-0-eds we ('an’t speak to, the Tuck Shop, and St. Peter's ‘hlystery

:9»

Hour .

\Vay up in the less dense portions of the inevitable smog, higher even than
the Air Students elect to ascend, on the twentieth and twenty-first floors, there
exists a group known as Company F. Potentially, this lofty position offers
a. magniﬁcent view. Potentially, these engineers say, because they believe that
the Pittsburgh blackness cannot last forever.

Company F, whicli was activated at Pitt on August 13, 1943 is made up
of a11 All—American group of G.I.’s from Texas, Iowa, New Jersey, Georgia,
Rhode Island, and Brooklyn. Everyone gripes, therefore everyone is happy,
since griping is acknowledged to be the mark of a contented soldier.

In the line of extra-curricular activities, the boys figure that 1/5 of their
time is spent waiting in one line or another, 1/5 askpee, and 4/5 thinking about

girls. (An example of engineering math). During the rest of the time, they
study.

Kipling’s famous words can easily be disproved by a quick glance at the
composition of Company G, advanced engineers of the AST Unit. For not
only does this company contain, in its 187 men, representatives of forty states,
Alaska, and Trinidad, but it also consists of “all kinds and conditions" of army
men—fro1n ‘lowly’ one—stripers, just out of basic, to deep browed staff and
first sergeants with often more than two years previous service. Almost all
of the members have, at some time or another, had at least two years of college
experience.

This seemingly heterogeneous group has found, however, a keen and lively
fellowship at Pitt, both within itself and in its associations with the students
and activities of the University. Evidence of this is found in the dances,
smokers, and other aﬁairs in which the company has had a part.

SQUAIIRIJN A

lVIore than half of Squadron A pulled into Pittsburgh on January 92 from
Greensboro, North Carolina, where they had led a useful, but somewhat color-
less life taking basic training and Air Crew Classiﬁcation tests. The rest of
the squadron, on the other hand, arrived some five weeks later complete with
suntans from l\Iiami Beach, Florida. VVhile there they had completed the
same general program, but they managed to live in famous shore resort hotels
while they were doing it.

Tl1e first group spent a hectic period of several weeks in quarantine. Once
released they were quick to appreciate the life of Pitt, quick to enjoy weekends
with the people they met in Pittsburgh. There were the usual cracks about
the dirt and smog of the Smoky City. l\/Iost impressive feature of l,’itt Army
life proved to be the good chow.

Squadron A men ran true to form. They started out as the underdog
junior squadron and worked up the line. They got into trouble and out of it,
had good times and bad. But they still like to think of themselves as the best
squadron that ever reached the best College Training l)eta(-hment in the
country.

Squadron B arrived in the City of the Hills and Valleys on December 7,
1943, appropriately enough. Appropriately enough because some of the boys
were at Pearl Harbor the (lay December 7 started to be capitalized in the minds
of Americans. Quite a few of the men in B were stationed in Hawaii, either
on Oahu or on the island of Hawaii with the Field Artillery and the Infantry.

The men i11 B hold ranks from private to master sergeant and have seen
action from Africa to the Canal Zone, from Brazil to the South Pacific. Some
of the men were attached to the Eighth Air Force in England, while others
have served in almost every other branch of the service. In addition, B is the
highest paid squadron ever to enter the 60th CTD, its members being chiefly
non—(,-ommissioned officers.

sQUAm:0N C

From the sun—kissed shores of California to the rockbound coast of
lVIaine, from the Great Lakes to the Gulf of Mexico have come the men of
Squadron C.

This group of men from eighteen to twenty—seven years of age, eligible
physically and mentally to participate in Air Crew Training, were assembled
at Basic Training Center No. 10, Greensboro, North Carolina, where for a
period of two to three months they sweated out that particular form of torture
known as basic.

From Greensboro the boys were shipped north to the University of Pitts-
burgh to take the preliminary ﬁve months of college training before being
classiﬁed. The boys arrived at Pitt on November 8, 1943, and Squadron C
was oﬂicially formed.

The men of Squadron D arrived here October 19, 1943, for their ﬁve months
college training course. The main body came from Greensboro, North Carolina
with the rest coming from hliami Beach to complete the squadron.

Wlith Lt. Wvilliam L. Levenson as their Tactical Officer, these men upheld
the tradition of the 60th CTI) by becoming a well trained squadron whose
discipline and morale was exceptionally high.

During the course of their stay here at Pitt, they were largely responsible
for the first musical comedy ever to be staged by the Air Crew Students, the
never-to—be—forgotten ‘" ‘he Lid’s Off”. It was a smash hit which sold a million
and a half dollars worth of \Var Bonds to help boost the fourth war loan drive
of Pittsburgh.

Now they are looking forward to the next step along the way to becoming
pilots, bombardiers, and navigators in the Army Air Force.

SQUA])IION E

Squadron E arrived in Pittsburgh on the 92nd of February. The boys came
in two groups from two different ﬁelds, Freeman Field at Seymour, Indiana,
and Lockbourne Army Air Base in Columbus, Ohio.

The ﬁrst thing that struck the fellows about Pitt was, as always, the
terriﬁc chow, which made everybody Very happy and still does. Then came
the seemingly inﬁnite period before their restriction was lifted and they were
able to ﬁnd out that all they had heard about the fair city was true, which
also made them Very happy.

This group, all fresh from the (tlassification centers, was well supplied with
stripes, from master sergeants to p.f.c.’s, and at ﬁrst it was a little tough to get
acclimated to bare shirt sleeves, but the boys are bearing up well.

All we can say is that if the boys in the squadron shape up in the remainder
of their training as they have so far, they don’t have a thing to worry about.

SERVICE HALL 0F FAME

“For Pittsburgh’s glory and the honor of the
University” is an appropriate tally for our men and
women in the armed services. Especially, the Uni-
versity is proud of those who have been decorated
for valor, for these citations honor not only the men
who received them but also other Pitt men and women
who are ﬁghting with them. They honor, too, the
members of the faculty who were their teachers and
who, daily, through the cheerful performance of extra
wartime duties share the victory, sacriﬁce, and valor.

Their deeds of unbelievable bravery in the face of
action are tremendous. In a battle off Guadalcanal,
a boy removed shell casings from white hot guns with
his bare hands after his asbestos gloves burned out;
another, seeing one of his men lying wounded in a
gun emplacement directly in the line of Japanese
machine gun ﬁre, left his shelter and removed the
wounded man to safety; a navigator on a flight
mission over Sfax returned to his position next to a
burning engine, after being ordered to bail out, and
got rid of a load of 1000 pound bombs, making sure
that all the bombs were away, before a crash landing
was made. For these actions and others like them,
Pitt’s men have been cited with 1 Navy Cross, 4
Distinguished Service Crosses, 2% Distinguished Fly-
ing Crosses, 37 Air Medals, 11 Silver Stars, 1 Soldier’s
Medal, 14 Purple Hearts, and numerous Oak Leaf
Clusters. Each day additional reports of their
heroism come in from every sector, front, and theatre
of war.

ATHLETICS

ATHLETICS AT PITT

“Crucial” was the only word to describe the collegiate sports
picture when the summer of 1943 rolled around. A lowered draft
age and the calling up of the Army and Navy Reserves in the
colleges seemingly eliminated all those boys Who formerly par-
ticipated in the sports programs. llore than 500 of the so—called
Army schools abandoned formal athletics completely. Blany others
were saved only by the presence of Navy trainees who were per-
mitted to compete on the college teams.

But Pitt, convinced of the value of sports in peacetime, was
even more convinced of the value of sports in wartime. Both
Army and Navy ofﬁcials had gone on record with the statement
that contact sports offered the ﬁnest kind of training for War a boy
could get outside of actual combat.

Pitt determined to carry on its athletics and to give the boys
coming into school an opportunity to participate and get into
condition for the great battles to come.

This year Pitt ﬁelded football, basketball and baseball teams.
Plans were also made to have golf, tennis and track teams if there
were enough boys who wanted them. An Intramural program was
organized for both fraternities and independents.

And a ma'or art of the athletic rotrram was iven over to
. D 4
conditioning the Army men stationed at Pitt.

It is an athletic program geared of the present and laying a
foundation for the future at the same time it is preparing young
men for future military duty.

THE C]IANCELLOR

“THE OWL is a student record of life at the
Universityéof fun, the joy to be alive, and the
high seriousness of moving toward signiﬁcant ma-
turity. It is the meaning the University has,
individually, for each student—a meaning which is
in beautiful buildings, the grass and trees of the
campus, the character of those about you, teachers
and fellow students, and the things you do day after
day. It is your growing in skill to be a doctor or
a business man-or an artist or a good citizen, and
your capacity for thinking clearly about material
things and the non material. It is a record of your
growing toward integrity and kindness, toward
worthy doing and quiet wisdom.

“Let me congratulate you upon the recording of
these things.”

JOHN G. BOVVMAN.

THEY COACH OUR TEAM

Clark Daniel Shaughnessy, the
“hliracle l\Ian” behind Stanfords’ 1940
cellar to Rose Bowl Championship team,
was head pilot of the football Panthers
this year.

His staff, necessarily small because of
the war and the scarcity of assistants
versed in the “T” formation, did not lack
for All-Americans. First Assistant
Charles (Doc) Hartwig was an All-
American Pitt guard in 1934. Johnny
Dickinson was an All—American End for
Pitt in 1938.

0UB TEAM

War translated into football meant 17-year olds,
deferred men, and students classiﬁed 4-F for those
schools dependent wholly on civilian material. But
it also meant heightened competition, for football was
open to everyone at Pitt this year.

There were six freshmen in the lineup Pitt sent
against Notre Dame, September 25, and ﬁve of these
had not yet registered with their local boards. First
string quarterback Joe Mocha, who combined football
with a pre-dent course, was a 17-year-old freshman
from St. Clair, Pa. Other 17-year-olds in the lineup
were center Don Fisher, guard Gary Feniello, end
Jim Maloney, and fullback Bill Abromitis. Only
Francis Mattioli at left guard was a regular on the
previous Pitt team, while dent freshman Frank
Knisley, and Dick Trachok played whatever positions
needed to strengthen the team.

“Upon the ﬁelds of friendly

~GeneraI Douglas A. MacArthur

PITT 0 — NOTRE DAME 41

The largest crowd ever to Witness a Pitt opening game, 58,000, came out to watch the
Panthers meet the Irish, September 25. Pitt had the “T” formation, but Notre Dame had
Betelli, Lujack, Kelly, Rykovich, lVIiller, Mello and the “T” formation. The very young
Panthers, With ﬁve 17-year-olds in the starting lineup, tried hard, but as one Chicago Writer
so aptly summed it up, “It was a case of the “T” against a case of TNT.”

[209]

[210]

 

PITT 18 AWEST VIRGINIA 0

October 9 marked the opening of the
“real” Pitt season as the Panthers met
a team their own size for the first time.
To reserve quarterback Joe Kielb went
the honor of scoring the ﬁrst Pitt touch-
down of the year. Fourth down, two
yards to go, the Mountaineer line closed
in for a line plunge, but Mr. Kielb
decided to keep the ball himself and ran
around the end for the score. Fullback
Bill Abromitis and halfback Tommy
Kalmanir contributed the other touch-
downs.

 

PITT 0 - GREAT LAKES 40

Pitt traveled to Great Lakes, but as
far as the game was concerned it was still
a case of “too old, too big, and too ex-
perienced.” Another Notre Dame man,
Steve Juswik, and a former Duke
nemesis, Steve Lach, contributed most
of the damage to the Panther cause.

 

PITT Q5 — ILLINOIS 33

The Pitts went to Illinois for this one.
At the half, they appeared to be soundly
beaten, 19—0. The Pitt defensive half-
backs had a tendency to stand still in
their tracks and Eddie Bray and Eddie
McGovern had a tendency to run around
the ends for long scoring gains. But
the Panthers put on a second half ﬁnish
that made people wonder if Pitt had
changed teams as well as sides at the
half. Pitt completed 14 out of 17 passes
attempted as they amassed 25 points.
But Illinois also picked up 14 points in
the second half to make the ﬁnal score
33-25. It was the largest collection of
points a Pitt team had ever made in
losing ‘a game.

 

PITT 45 —CARNEGIE TECH 6

Short of shooting the scorekeeper, the
Panthers did everything possible to keep
down the score of this game, but the
Shaughnessy coached team was just too
much for the game, willing, but sadly
inept Tartans. Only 34 came out for
football at Tech this year and Q2 of these
had never before played football. Every-
one of the 65 boys listed on the Pitt
roster saw action in the game. The ﬁnal
Pitt touchdown was scored by a member
of the scrub team.

 

 

PITT 18 — BETHANY 0

Not too much was known about
Bethany’s all-Navy team, and apparent-
ly, the Panthers decided to devote the
ﬁrst half to sounding them out. They
sloughed through a scoreless ﬁrst half,
but pushed across three touchdowns in
the final stanza to give them their second
shutout win of the season. The Panthers
evidently bearing in mind their lapses at
Illinois, were particularly good defens-
ively against the bigger Bethany Navy
recruits.

PITT 6 — OHIO STATE 46

This was to have been “the” Pitt
game of the season. It turned out to be
“the” Ohio State game of the season.
The Buckeyes, with only one previous
win, seemingly made up for all the short-
comings of their season in this one game.
In possession of the ball eight times
during the ﬁrst half, they scored seven
times. Fleet halfbacks Ernie Parks and
Dean Sensanbaugher made the Buckeyes
virtually unstoppable. The Panthers
held the OSU third and fourth teams
scoreless during the second half and
Jack Itzel went over for the only Pitt
score of the game. 6

[212]

PITT 0—PENN STATE 14

Penn State was rated a two touchdown favorite over the Panthers which is exactly what
the ﬁnal score showed them to be. But the Panthers were never very far out of this ball game
and, with a few breaks, might have won. They couldn’t get their offense going and dropped
enough passes to break up ﬁve ball games.

One of the ironic oddities of the game was supplied by ex-panther Bill Abromitis who
scored the ﬁrst State touchdown. Lone bright spot for the Panthers was Francis Mattioli’s
brilliant performance at guard.

C’EST LA GUERE

Once upon a time a coach merely had to
worry about the lineup the opposing team was
going to set against him. But wartime foot-
ball is such that a coach can never state with
any ﬁnality one day just what his lineup is
going to be the next.

From the time of the intra-squad game,
August 2, to the ﬁnal game, November 20,
the draft and ubiquitous eighteenth birthdays
left the Panthers with insufficient players to

   

make up a good first team. Particularly
Rosepink at Pitt Rosepink in the Navy

damaging to the Pitt chances were the loss
of halfbacks Carl Nlosso and Angelo Carlac-
cini, fullback Bill Abromitis, and tackle
l\Iarty Rosepink.

  
 
  
 
 
 
 
  
  
 
   

Strangest feature of wartime football was
the sensation coaches had when boys they had
trained and developed, sent to other colleges
under Navy and Marine programs, came back
to look down the throats of their former

team mates.

The Vice Chancellor

DR. RUFUS H. FITZGERALD

Soft-spoken, sincere, and conscientious, Vice-
Chancellor Fitzgerald is among the busiest
administration officers in the University. So
few students realize how much Dr. Fitzgerald
does. As head of the Board of Deans, he is
now working out plans for war training here at
Pitt. He regulates new teaching devices, plans
for scholarships to worthy students in his
policy of equal opportunity for education,
supervises recreation and housing of students,
acquires new staff members and computes the
relative accomplishments of departments.

Above all, Dr. Fitzgerald’s chief concern is the
student. To him come the undergraduate
leaders with their problems in publications,
activities and organizations. Now he is taking
out out-moded courses and installing up-to-the-
minute ones, and has already mapped out a
post—war program for returning veterans.
Dr. Fitzgerald’s job of keeping the work and
activities of the University rolling ahead is a
big one and only he could do it.

The Secretary

DR. JOHN WEBER

Probably the person who is most familiar with
Pitt, both from the student‘s viewpoint and the
faculty’s, is Dr. John VVeber, secretary of the
University. A Pitt graduate, Dr. V\7eber has
been a member of the faculty since 1910 when
he accepted an instructor’s position. Since
then, he has advanced to professor, head of the
engineering department, and then to his present
position as secretary. As supervising engineer,
when Pitt was being enlarged, he helped erect
the Cathedral of Learning. He traveled over
Europe at that time to select the seventy foot
high windows that have made Heinz Chapel
world famous. Dr. Weber numbers among the
few people who can say not only that he is a
part of Pitt, but also that he helped to make
Pitt what it is today.

H. CLIFFORD CARLSON

BASKETBALL

Events of the 1943-44 basketball season showed
that Dr. H. C. Carlson knew what he was talking
about when he dubbed his team the “Tiny Toughies.”
It was a team made up of untried sophomores and
17-year old freshman with the exception of Captain
VValter Jones, who was a member of last year’s
varsity.

“I don’t inspire these Kids,” the Doctor insisted,
“they inspire me.” The fans soon saw what he meant.
Forward Nate Apple almost had to legally change his
name to Frank Merriwell after he sank the winning
ﬁeld goals in the ﬁnal seconds of the Geneva and
Bethany contests. February freshman Chuck Biehl
made the team just in time to contribute the winning
points against West Virginia and take the scoring
honors at Penn State.

It was a team that thrilled the fans all season with
a display of gameness, courage, spirit and skill in the
pure fundamentals as they broke even on the 14 game
schedule. Sometimes the “Toughies” lost to superior
height (Westminster, Penn State); sometimes to
all around superior teams (unbeaten Army and Ohio
State, champions of the Big Ten). They never lost
because they were outfought and they always came
up with a good game.

MINIDR SPORTS

The perennial baseball chant “Wait till next year” may have more than a little bearing
on Coach Ralph Mitterling's sixth Pitt diamond team. Catcher Joe Kielb and Pitcher Jim
Reber who made up last year’s starting battery will be back to form the nucleus of this years’
team. Also returning is outﬁelder Bob McKee.

In line with the University policy to continue sports “just so long as there are boys who
are interested and who want to play,” Pitt turned out track, golf and tennis teams last year.
But cross-country, indoor track, and swimming were dropped. This April track and golf were
dropped.

Harold “Hap” Stickel, Pitt track great who climaxed his college career by winning the
National AAU 60 yard low hurdle championship in February of last year, coached the track
team last year. The track team walloped Carnegie Tech, 99-32, but in turn was beaten by
Penn State, 46-86, ﬁnished last in the Triangular meet with Army and Columbia, and failed
to place in the Penn Relays and IC-4A championship.

The golfers, coached by Nick Kliskey, won two and lost two games of a four game schedule.
They bowed to West Virginia and Navy, but defeated good neighbor Carnegie Tech twice.

Tennis, under Dr. Dave O’Loughlin and Charles (Doc) Hartwig resulted in one win and
three losses. The netters defeated Tech, 6-3 and led in a second match, 2-1 when the rains came
to the Tartan rescue. However, they were whitewashed by Army and Navy, and lost to Penn
State, 6-0 in a match that was washed out before it could be completed.

PHYSICAL TRAINING PROGRAl\I FOR ARMY AIR (‘.\I)l<)T
AND A. S. T. 1’. GROUP

A major part of Pitt’s athletic program this year was given over to a group of men whose
names never appear in box scores or in sports page headlines. For with the coming of the
Army to Pitt, it became the job of the Athletic Department to provide a program of physical

ﬁtness for the soldiers in training.

Running, calisthenics, and swimming were the three main divisions of Pitt’s program to
condition its Army students for future battles. A specialized course in wartime aquatics was
given to teach the men to swim under conditions of actual warfare. They swim fully clothed
in fatigue suits, with packs on their backs, and through burning oil and gasoline.

In charge of conditioning the Air Corps students was Bob Hoel. Stanley Olenn was in
charge of the Army Specialized Training students. Assisting them were baseball coach Ralph
Mitterling, VVarren Heller, Tar Onder, Mike Josephs, and Charles Hartwig.

Tl1e \Vomen's Athletic Association offers its pro-
gram of sports to those girls who want athletics as an
extra—curricular activity. This year, the organization
opened its social calendar with a Scotch party for the
freshmen girls. Everyone came dressed in plaid and
became a. member of a Scotch clan for the duration of
the party.

Their choice of fun, depending upon the season of
the year, ranged from swimming parties to ice-
skating, bowling, and basketball parties. For freshmen
women who can’t take an active part in W'AA, the
group sponsors a guild included in the guild system, in
which the activities are very similar to those of the
VVOmen’s Athletic Association proper.

According to tradition, the active year of this
organization is concluded with the ceremonial In-
stallation Banquet.

Despite the decreased number of pre-meds, the

cog among Pitt honoraries. And, as Johnny \Veimer
says, “The standards will not be lowered even if there
is no longer anyone eligible.” Their standards are
stiﬁ‘, too. The group requires a 2.2 average for the
freshman year and demands that the candidates have
participated in two other campus activities.

The war has slowed down the social interests of the
group, and this year the annual banquet was the main
attraction. The boys have been more interested,
instead, in seeing what their future careers as doctors
will be like. They have spent a great deal of time at

the group at his farm for a picnic.

Since so many of the members are graduating into
the teaching ﬁeld this year, the Delta Lams made
plans to bring back alums to tell the active group of

NU SIGMA SIGMA

Newest of Pitt’s honoraries, Nu Sigma Sigma was
founded in December, 1943 due to the planning of
Virginia Jackson their honorary president. A
natural science fraternity for both men and women,
it maintains one of the highest scholastic averages on
campus. Qualiﬁcations for membership in this
Fraternity are that a student must carry at least
twelve credits in natural sciences with a 22 quality
point average in their ﬁeld and at least a 2.0 for a Pres ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' "Robert 0”
general average quality point. lVIeetings are held V- P7'€S- - - - . . . . . . . Wvilliam Stinger
twice a month where they are entertained by guest
speakers and motion pictures, with their social high-
light placed on the initiates banquet held in the Spring.
The purpose of bringing such a group together is to
create a better understanding and appreciation of
relations between the various branches of sciences.
The members feel that by integrating their scientiﬁc
knowledge from their chosen ﬁelds they bring about
a closer fellowship.

l\Iembers of Phi Lambda Upsilon, honorary chem-
istry fraternity, are students in engineering, chemistry
specials, and graduate students in both ﬁelds.

At informal meetings, scheduled once a month,
these men get together to discuss interests in their
particular ﬁelds. During the year, the fraternity gave
two smokers, and when the weather permitted they
planned picnics. A successful theatre party high-
lighted the year's social curriculum when the men as
a complete group put aside their busy schedules for
one evening and went to the Nixon Theatre together.

Their social activities have been at a minimum this
year because the majority of the members have been
teaching soldiers chemistry, mathematics, and physics
under the army program.

IIMICBIIN DELTA KAPPA

The last two members of ODK left the University
in the spring of ISHS. But they left behind them a
request that a committee of faculty members under-
take active care of the chapter and keep their national
honorary activities fraternity going. So the faculty
members appointed for tl1is, met to act as the nucleus
of 0I)K, and to nominate future tapees.

In the fall semester, the huge White key stood on the
ground floor corridor instead of on the campus. Eight
men were honored, and eight names appeared on the
key#Jim Baker, Dave Barbour, Charles Bezdek,
VValter Jones, Sidney Klein, Ned lVIcIntosh, Tom
Padden, and Harry Stark.

January 14 marked the date of their informal
initiation banquet at the College Club, and once again
the Gamma Circle is in top form.

SIGMA KAPPA PHI

The purpose of Sigma Kappa Phi, national honorary
foreign language fraternity, is for “recognition of out-
standing ability and attainments in the foreign
languages, the stimulation of advanced work and
individual research in the language ﬁeld, the creation
of a spirit of unity and co-operation among the
students of foreign languages”.

Membership to Sigma Kappa Phi is limited to those Pres ‘ ' ' ‘ ' ‘ ' ‘ ‘ ' ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘Alison Stewart

GENERAL ALUMNI

The purpose of the General Alumni Association is
“to promote the welfare and interests of the University
of Pittsburgh and its Alumni, to foster close cooperation
between the Alumni aI1d the University, and to support
and advance the cause of higher education.”

The organization is composed of members of ten
constituent associations. These ten organizations are
Alumnae, Applied Social Sciences, Business Administra-
tion, College, Dentistry, Education and Graduate, Engineer-
ing and Mines, Law, "Medical, and Pharmacy Alumni
Associations.

 

Alumni Council is the governing body of the Associa-
tion and is composed of oﬂicers of the General Alumni
Association, three representatives from each constituent
association, two past presidents and two representatives of Pitt clubs.

R. L. IHERKER,
Secretary

Because of the war, most of the activities of the General Alumni Associa-
tion were curtailed this year. Since it was difficult to meet in person, it
was made possible for alumni to convey their thoughts through printed
words. Copies of “The Alumni Review”, edited by Ruth Lee Dierker, who
assembled news of activities of the University, were sent to various schools
and to members in civil and military life.

Instead of the annual Homecoming Smoker, this year a Homecoming
Rally and Luncheon was held in November at the Hotel Schenley. Then in
December, the Second Annual Children’s Christmas party was given in the
Commons Room. The idea originated with the party given to entertain
children of the faculty and alumni in the service. Other events of the year
included a Dinner Bridge and a Charter Day Program.

Two point average engineers are the only ones
qualiﬁed for membership to Sigma Tau, Pitt's honor-
ary engineering fraternity, so if you see a boy from
the hill sporting the Sigma Tau seal, you know that
he is tops. In November, they gave aI1 informal
pledge dance, and in early February seven new
members were initiated and given a banquet at the
Royal York apartments. Good engineering principles
determine the strikes and spares made at their in-
formal bowling parties, but the fraternity favors
meetings where food is the main issue. About one-
third of the Engineering school's faculty, including
Dean Holbrook, are alumni of Sigma Tau. The
previous membership of forty has been reduced to
ﬁfteen but the quality and spirit of the fellows is the
best, as always.

XYLIDN

Prexied by Elaine Kahn, Xylon, honorary fraternity
for women, has contributed more to Pitt this year in
personnel than it has since the time of its establish-
ment on this campus. Top notch positions in all
publications have been awarded to members of the
group. On the Pitt News Staff are: Lois Rowbottom,
editor; Elaine Kahn, sports editor; and June Thomson,
copy editor. Members of Xylon also hold top positions
on the Owl. They are: Viola Boydjieff, editor; June
Thomson and Phyllis Cohen, assistant editors; and
Beatrice Lefkowitz, women’s organizations editor.
The rest of Xylon’s members are upholding its stand-
ard of ﬁne writing and have done much in assisting

both the Owl and the News.

To say that “merit deserves praise” is to say that
those undergraduates who have been outstanding on
Campus publications or have distinguished themselves
by their writing are rewarded at the end of the year
by being tapped to Xylon. lVIOre than ever, they have
been “all out” to better the University’s Publications.

Panhellenic Association, functioning through its
council of fraternity representatives, worked toward
its purposes of inter-group co-operation in the fratern-
ity life of the women on campus. The usual reception
that they give for all Freshman women took place in
the Stephen Foster hlemorial. The receiving line,
the tea and cakes, and the pleasant conversations
were enjoyed by both the fraternity women and the
freshman. The same spirit was present at the tea for
transfers, an important event in a late orientation to
Pitt. In line with the activities of the regular Pan-
hellenic Council, there was a Junior Council organized
by the pledges, which turned out quite successfully.
The Inter-Fraternity Sing was one of the highlights of
the year. Each fraternity worked to make its own
skit the best, and everyone, including the judges,
contributed to the success of the affair.

Fraternities play an important part in the campus
lives of Pitt women, and Panhellenic Association has
done much to maintain this iinportaiice.

All is not so quiet behind the door of Apt. 4C,
Belleﬁeld Dwellings! Gab sessions, pillow fights, and
midnight snacks were a part of their annual Pajama
Party. Rugs were rolled up for a “Bringing Up
Father" affair, and the proud papas were given a Gay
Nineties show. There was a hallowe’en party with
Ruth Rosenbloom, Bea Lefkowitz and Roz Schwartz
ofﬁciating as chief ghosts. This year they hit the big
top in the ‘Var Bond Drive, selling more bonds than
any other organization on campus. Taking their step
toward Victory, they are making cartoon scrapbooks
for men overseas, and have had open houses many
times this year to entertain the near-by soldiers. The
“Little Red Hen” and “Black Sambo” became alive
at the show the AEPhi’s gave for the Children’s
Hospital and the Home for Crippled Children. They
took third place this year in the Inter-Sorority Sing.
At the Founders Day Banquet, prexy Phyl Cohen
paid tribute to the founders, and to make the celebra-
tion twice as festive, Nu’s baby sister chapter, Alpha
Nu at Tech, was pledged the same day. From the
proceeds of a beneﬁt midnight show, they bought a
fully equipped ambulance to be sent overseas and
Phyllis C0l1€H presented in Nu’s name. Now the question remains
“Who will win the two glittering cups for the “Brain-
iest” and the best “All-round" seniors at Senior Day

This past school year found the Beta Sigs settled
in their new house at 314 Neville Street, spending
much of their time helping in the war effort. Sunday
mornings they served and entertained the members
of the Armed Services stationed in Pittsburgh at the
Y canteen. Active in the AVVVS, they sold bonds at
rallies, and served as receptionists, and switchboard
operators. Pitt Alpha Tau chapter contributed to the
large sum given to the Red Cross by National Beta
Sigma Omicron.

On the social side of the ledger, the Beta Sigs report
that the Hard Times Hop, planned by the pledges,
was a tremendous success. High-lighting the spring
and fall semesters, there were two large formal dances,
at which many of the Pitt service men were represent-

The Chi Omega program this year has been diﬁerent
from those of “the good old college days”. The girls
kept their resolution “A “Tar Stamp per ChiO, per
VVeek”, and entered the bond drives with enthusiasm.
In addition they acted as hostesses at the canteen,
made scrapbooks and toys for the Children’s Hospital,
and began their collection of Chi Omega songs
gathered from their 97 chapters.

The Chi O’s also gave their pep and drive to many
campus activities holding the positions of Vice Presi-
dent and Secretary of the Senior Class, Editorship of
the Owl, and 2 student house presidencies. VTheir
winter formal, Halloween dance, and monthly parties
added to their lighter moments.

The house at 4206 Bigelow has been really busy
this year. They honored their district president and
their national president with a tea. The soldiers have
had a royal welcome from the Tri-Delts too. One of
their many dances for the soldiers stationed at Pitt

was a Christmas dance featuring Mrs. Santa Claus,
alias Lola VVard.

The VVard Home for Children also met the Tri-Delt
Santa Claus at a party with loads of presents and cake
and candy. Then came a Very special night . . .
November 22, when six girls representing the Tri-
I)elts placed first in the Interfraternity Sing. Then,
replacing the Wlinter Formal in February, there was
an informal dance at the Schenley Hotel.

Helping at home, their formal China \Var Relief
Beneﬁt and their continual War Bond sales were
tremendous successes. All this adds up to a grand
sum of sorority spirit and “war effort” enthusiasm

this year. Ofﬁcial headquarters for the DZ’s is at the
College Club, Where they have dinner meetings once
a month and plan their many social events. Included
in the program were three initiation banquets, at one
of which iVIiss Rush was main speaker, a Christmas
party, two dances at the South Park Community
House, and a party for the graduating seniors. The
girls attended a performance of the Ice Capades
together.

In addition to their full social life, the Delta Zetas
did their bit in the war effort. They bought war bonds
out of the chapter treasury. And the gals are doing
their best in entertaining for the boys in the AST at

The Theta kite has really been soaring high this
year. The girls have redecorated their house on
Belleﬁeld Street, and they've had numerous social
affairs to show their guests the results of their efforts.
The aﬁairs, Jane Logan tells us, have included parties
and tea dances for the men’s fraternities on campus,
slumber parties at the house, and bridge parties.
The gals have served as hostesses at the local Canteens,
sold war bonds, and have done much to make the
bond drive a success here at Pitt. Once a month they
serve en masse at the U.S.O. Variety Club Canteen.

The Thetas have a banquet each year for initiates,
and this year, Prexy Barbara Kohberger will preside
with her very able assistants. The Kappa Alpha

The Kappa Kappa Gammas have a war job! And
not just one job, but innumerable ones. Selling war
bonds and defense stamps, serving as hostesses in
local canteens, donating precious blood to the Red
Cross blood banks, and Working part-time in War Work
are all a part of every Kappa’s routine. The girls rate
extra high in morale building, too, at the University
. . . house dances for the air cadets have proved that.

Social activities such as the Founders’ Day Banquet,
the Christmas Party, and a tea for the future Tech
Kappas gave these busy women an opportunity to
relax and be merry. All is not Work and all is not play
for a KKG, but Whatever the program is, they are

This has been an earnest year for Phi hlu. Its main
project has been a ‘Var Education Program, with
representatives of the Pitt faculty, VVACs, VVAVES,
and women Marines as their guests at bi-monthly
tables.

Applying the program, they have done their part
on campus by being second in the sale of war bonds
in the first semester drive and in helping to keep Pitt
organizations functioning.

There is no lack of fun for the Phi .\Iu's, for looking
at the gay side, they have had several house dances
for soldiers stationed here. A Halloween dance, a
-winter pledge dance, a Valentine's Day dance, and a
spring formal have also been on their social list. The
chapter has also made a practice of celebrating each
girl’s birthday.

In their leisure time the Phi lVIu‘s are writing
original chapter songs for their 92nd birthday cele-
bration.

Phi Sigma Sigma started the year by holding “Open
House” to show off their spic-an-span apartment.
Keeping in the social swing, they soon had a bridge
from which the proceeds went to the Variety Club
Canteen. For this contribution the girls were invited
to be Junior Hostesses one day at the Variety Snack

Bar.

In December enough contributions were made by
Phi Sig chapters of the country to send a Clubmobile
overseas. The local apartment rapidly became a
defense center . . . here the girls made rag dolls for
the China War Relief Fund and here, too, they
relaxed in their favorite room, the comfortable living
room. Phi Sigs are as active romantically as they are
socially, for they announced the engagements of ﬁve
of their sisters this year‘.

The activities of the Theta Phi Alpha girls center
around their Center Avenue apartment. There they
held successful parties three for the Air Cadets and
AST men of Pitt. At an alumni party, the “ticket of
admittance” was a doll. These dolls were gathered
together and sent to the St. Paul's Orphanage. The
juvenile trend continued at their Parent’s party,
where children’s games were played.

Aside from many activities on campus, the girls
have time to help the men of the armed forces stationed
at Pittsburgh by acting as hostesses at the Y Canteen.
Four of their rank were fortunate enough to be asked
to act as hostesses at the U.S.(). Variety Club Can-
teen. President l\Iary Jane Grifﬁtli kept every TPA

Zeta Tau Alpha’s are participating in many national
projects of their fraternity: all “non—anemics" were
donors for the Blood Bank Drive. . . all members
celebrated Founder’s Day by VVar Stamp purchases.
The girls took advantage of every opportunity to
keep in close touch with other ZTA chapters. After
the Bethany game, they entertained their Bethany
sorors at a house party. Before the holidays there
was a festive formal candlelight dinner. The execu-
tive committee busied themselves preparing the food.

During the holidays, one gala week-end boasted a
dance, spaghetti dinner and a party at the ZTA house.
Other Socials were parties for the l\Iotl1er's Club and
alumnae. The girl’s latest project . . . and they’ve
worked hard at it . . . is transforming the cellar into
a game room . . . walls are pale yellow, and the wood-
work, bright red! For amusement there‘s ping-pong,

Alpha Kappa Alpha, oldest Negro sorority, has
been doing many things this year. One of their
biggest national projects has been The lvlississippi
Health Project. On campus, the AKAS entered and
won the Sorority Bowling Tournament last year.

They have done more than their share of contribut-
ing copper pieces to the Penny Drive . . . It has
become traditional for AKA to entertain all Negro
students on campus at their annual Chili Feed, held
each fall. Members of AKA have also taken Red
Cross courses, worked as USO hostesses, and have
done volunteer Work in recreation centers. Under
the leadership of their prexy, Mildred Gloster, the
girls have maintained high scholastic averages and
have had a very successful year.

Of the thirteen men’s fraternities on campus, only
nine active frats were represented in Interfraternity
Council this war year. Despite war-time restrictions,
the Greek Congress, headed by Dick Slater and with
311-. Roy H. Umble as faculty advisor, sponsored the
traditional social events on its yearly calendar. One
of the most successful dances of the season was the
IF Ball, chairmaned by Bob Burford, which took
place in the Imperial Room of the Hotel lVebstcrv
Hall on December 11.

Delta Tau Delta won the IF Sing, with Pi Kappa
Alpha placing second. The Pi KA's also captured
the IF touch football league title, with Phi Epsilon
Pi taking second place. Interfraternity Council is a
smaller organization than before the war, but it is
still getting big things done.

Although Delta Tau Delta has sent 179 active
alumni members to the armed services, the roof of old
“Delta Shelter" still vibrates when the boys get to-
gether on week-ends. This year the pledges sponsored
the traditional “Bowery Brawl", and the Christmas
season saw the DTD’s holding their annual candle-
light service at Trinity Cathedral and the candlelight
dinner-dance at the house.

For the fourth time in the last six years, the Delts
received ﬁrst honors in the Inter-Fraternity Sing,
when 8 of their men sang two of their favorite songs.
A pledge group did such a good job re-decorating the
house that you’ll ﬁnd every active and pledge with
his sleeves rolled up, working to make his house
“tops”! VVhen President Jim Baker was admitted
into Medical School, a new election was held.

The year 1908 was the beginning of Phi Delta
Theta, now represented by twenty-four brothers and
four pledges. They may frequently be found
“straightening up" on a Sunday afternoon following
a dance at their house at 961 Dithridge Street. Their
fraternity flower, a white carnation, is often made
into Corsages for their dates at the monthly house
dances.

\Vomen’s fraternities are entertained at dinner-
dances and tea hops by the fraters whose colors are
azure and argent. All is not social, they tell us,  they
point to their members in campus activities.

But they are even prouder, for sixty-eight stars
adorn their service flag . . . stars symbolizing brothers
scattered on all of the war fronts . . . with three gold
ones to show how mu(:l1 the Phi Delts have given to
the War effort.

Phi Epsilon Phi is back again. They lost their old
house but bounced right into an apartment at the
Schenley. The seventeen actives are back in com-
petition and hope to do better than the two men they
got last hell week. They had a special showing of
“Princess O’Rourhe" for their last rushing and the
idea went over so big that they plan to l1aVe pictures
shown for all rush weeks. On the purely social side,
the boys have had several Saturday night dances and
a Very successful alumni fraternity dinner, thanks to
the activeness of their alumni. The fellows are really
going places around school and hope to keep up the
name of “Phi Eps” despite the war, and losing fellows
like Bill Greenblatt to Uncle Sam.

The forty—two Phi Gamma Deltas meet in their
house at 4725 \Vallingford Street. Part of the year’s
fun was house cleaning and re—decorating the first
and second floors. The social season opened with a
Barn Dance and a Snowball Dance given by the
pledges. The Fijis’ Christmas formal was topped
only by the Spring Formal at Sh annopin Country Club.

On the mantle beside the IF sports trophy, which
is in their keeping for the duration, is the Inter—mural
trophy, won for the fourth consecutive year. Besides
being active i11 school activities, the boys have time
to send their news-letter and Panther Fiji, the local
publication of the Phi Gain national magazine, to
the boys in the service. They are keeping the largest

In contrast to those many closed doors on the first floor marked “lVIilitary Personnel”,
the wide, bright entrances to the Dean of \Vomen‘s Office mean “Welcoiiie”.

Pitt this year is a school of marching feet, khaki, chow in lines, and air corps insignia,
a university where women are in the minority. Ping—pong game room, reception room, and
lounges went the way of the army when the women’s floor was taken over by the military
department last year.

But a staff, not easily daunted, made their new location on the first floor, “hoine" to the
Pitt women. So we girls have a place to take our problems; lielpfiil advisors to give us assistance,
and worthwhile advice to be gained.

Nlost popular social events were the (‘andlelight

The war challenge has been met by Pi Lambda Phi,

made Pi Lam one of the largest fraternities on campus.

The fraters, prexied by Stan Levy in the fall, can
boast of active participation in the organizations still
functioning on campus and have, in addition, not
only won the coveted Scholarship Award again, but
also set a record-breaking average for fraternities at
Pitt. Once more they have brought home the Pi Lam
national fraternity scholarship award.

The war has taken its Share of Pi Lams; the service

Everything took on a shade of se1'iousness this year,
and the brothers of ‘Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity,
prexied by John Miller and then Howdy Johnson,
tried to make their activities the same in their head-
quarters on Belleﬁeld Avenue. At least, in this whirl-
wind of insecurity, the twenty-two brothers of Chi-
Omicro11 are certain of a home . . . they own theirs!
The boys re-decorated the house . . . new trimmings,

Symbolic of SAE are the two lions that stand guard
at the entrance of their home, denoting assurance and

The early summer months of 1943 cut deeply into
the active enrollment of Sigma Chi fraternity, for the
graduating class and Uncle Sam together contributed
in lowering the active membership from 55 to 5 men.

“Sig House" on Center Avenue had to be closed but

the ﬁve remaining men carried on the functions of an
active chapter. In the summer of 43 they rushed
and held their meetings in University classrooms.

Fall rushing brought better results, and Lady Luck
helped the boys find a seven room furnished house on
iVIelwood Street. \Valls were washed, and painted,
furniture was polished, and everything was arranged
for the fellows to move in.

The new “Sig House” was opened and the eleven
active brothers were able to feel as if they were really
a part of Pitt's Fraternity Row.

Although the amount of space occupied by the oﬂices of the Dean of lVIen has diminished,
there is still the friendly pat on the back, the personal conferences, and the “helpful hand"
that Dean Theodore Biddle and his staff personify.

Gone are the eighth floor lounges, the men’s Tuck Shop, the Vast ofﬁces of the Publica-
tions. The Dean of :\Ien’s office, too, has been moved to the first floor, but with no lessening
of its keynote, “VVelco1ne“.

Mr. VVilliam Daufenl)acl<, assistant to the Dean of 1\Ien, supervises all marshalling work.
Miss Betty Maloney, l\Iiss Irene Thomas, and him. Alice B. Dorﬁeld are the friendly secretaries

ENGINEERING AND MINES DANCE

   
   
  
  
  
   
    

An Engineer’s favorite companion is his slide

rule . . . November 5 they slid their feminine
partners (not rulers) at their annual E and M dance
at the VVilliam Penn . . . down the dimly lit marble

stairs and into the still di1nn1er “Pittsburgh Room".
The slogan of the dance was “Back The United VVar
Fund” . . . . all proceeds turned over to that
organization. Bill LeRoy played . . . . and fun
was had by all.

”HOLI])AY

Spring Festival of 1944 will remain long in the
records as one of the best our University has
known. There was never a dull minute as Tap
Day Ceremonies—a tea dance (the Hangover
Hop)#track meet~Pitt Players Show—float
parade — open house — picnic - and Blossom
Time Ball — provided three days of fast and
furious entertainment # not to mention trying
moments for the committee. A shortage of
students and abundance of G. I.’s made it
difﬁcult for them to count on much of anything.

Several new things were added this year.
The program was planned so that all could
come . . . . Dates??? . . . . with or without.
The traditional float parade was replaced by
stationary floats which made the Heinz Chapel
lawn a colorful scene of frantic activity as strong
breezes threatened the decorations. Pin-up girls
—Victory Gardens—Twitterpating—picnics ——
ﬁshing — gas rationing — ﬁlled in the blank
space of “In the spring a young man’s fancy
turns to thoughts of — — — #” to comply
with the theme of the event. Friday night

as the women decorated their fraternity houses

blueprints, punch and cookies, and exams
brought amused terror to the eyes of the guests.

  
 
  
 
  
   

Spring Festival Starts Off With A Bang

[292]

F0}! SPRING”

Pitt Players made Thursday evening riotious
with laughter by their production “Furlough-
but not For Lo11g"—the story of a former Pitt
student home on furlough only to ﬁnd his
Alma Klater sadly changed.

T he climax to a successful week came on
Saturday night when the Coca Cola Company
. . . . plug . . . . brought Ted Fio Rito and his
orchestra in a Spotlight Bands broadcast from
the Syria i\[osque stage. The University and
the men of the armed forces stationed here
were honored around the world. About eighty
million people over a hundred and eighty-three
stations heard what we at Pitt are doing to help
the war effort. Afterwards everyone went
down to the ballroom aI1d danced to the
maestro’s music. Indeed We could “point with
pride” to Pittsburgh. At intermission the
proud winners of the track meet, open house
decorations,‘ and float parade contests were
announced and presented with certificates of
honor.

Even the weather was considerate of the
occasion. The sun shone valiantly until Satur-
day afternoon, but no one got wet that evening
for the rai11 stopped until all were safely col-
lectcd in the Mosque for the big broadcast.
The success of the program—under the general
chairmanship of Paul Steinlauf and assistant
chairmanships of Bergie Steytler and Dave
IIei11'/.—proved that Pitt is not only carrying
on as normally as possible under war-time
circumstances, but is successfully keeping alive
some of her finest customs and traditions of
pre—war days.

If space permits, the walls heretofore used for ﬁxtures can
be used for cabinets reaching from the ﬂoor to any practical
height, housing the toilet and dress accessories convenient to
have at hand. More versatile decorative schemes are also
possible.

ABOUT VALVES

What do you think of when you hear the
word “Valve"? Most people think of a radiator
valve or an automobile valve. The fact is that
wherever the ﬂow of a gas or a ﬂuid must be
controlled, there a valve must be used. Valves
run from little tiny ones that weigh about a
half pound to great big ones that weigh a
couple of tons, with outlets as large as three
feet——maybe four or ﬁve feet wide and six feet
tall. Some are operated by hand and some by
electric motors. These great big valves go in
rubber plants, gasoline plants, and on dry docks

and ships. Valves are made mostly of bronze,
cast iron, steel, and malleable iron. With the
valves go ﬁttings, tees, elbows, pipe, etc., and
wrenches with which to operate them. Ships
use lots of valves; some kinds use as many as
15,000 per ship. They are used to control oil,
steam, water, gas, and other ﬂuids, In wartime
most all valves are used for war purposes—and
so many are used that the valve industry has had
to multiply its normal production many times.
In wartime importance, valves are close to the
top of the list of essentials.

He didn’t mean to

  

’I:-IIS man's intentions were excellent. But he chose the
wrong method of carrying them out.

He directed his trustee under his Will to continue the opera-
tion of his business without fail; to sell this piece of real estate,
to hold that; to invest only in certain types of securities for which
he had a high personal regard, to avoid all others.

And the outcome?

The business had to be operated at a loss. Forced sales of real
estate were made. “Certain types” of securities were held and
held, while the market went down and down. Net result: a de-
crease of more than half in the net value of his estate to his heirs.

In your own case: how much wiser to give discretion to a
trustee whose judgment you can trust and who will always be
able to make competent decisions based on current values and
conditions.

Perhaps you would like to discuss this important point further
with us before revising your will.

YOUR OPPORTUNITY
. . . in the Age of Carbides

An intermetallic compound, dis-
covered in 1937 by Mr. Philip
M. McKenna, ushered in an era
that offers unique opportunities
for men and women whose in-
terest lies in chemistry and allied
professions. This compound
(tungsten - titanium - carbide,
corresponding to the chemical
formula WTiC2) is cemented
with other ingredients by pro-
cesses of powder metallurgy, to
form c a r b i d e compositions.
known as Kennametal, that are
up to 250 times as wear-resist-
ant as hard steel!

Today the major part of Ken-
nametal production is for metal-
cutting purposes. Yet the ulti-
mate scope of its applicability
still remains virtually unex-
plored. The possibilities inher-
ent in it are stimulating, since
each new use for it means a new
way has been found to increase
machine eﬂiciency. Are you in-
terested in making a place for
yourself in the age of carbides?
Write us—we shall be glad to
consider your qualiﬁcations.

.422 Qilppreciafion

To all who believed that a 1944 OWL was possible
and worked for it; to all who offered cheerful encourage-
ment and invaluable service throughout the entire year; to
all who embodied our motto “Damn the pessimists, full
speed ahead," who spent long hours writing and re-writing
copy, laying out pages and proportioning pictures, pasting
up panel after panel and using up jar after jar of rubber
cement, ﬁling circulation cards and collecting payments,
taking part in midnight sessions of production to meet
menacing deadlines—we offer our sincerest appreciation
and thanks. It is because of these efforts that we now pass
this book on to others, smile proudly, and say: “The
OWL is now yours—the record of an eventful and surpris-
ing year in the life of the students, faculty, and military
personnel of your University.”

—The Editor.

UNIVERSITY
‘ OF PITTSBURGH

LIBRARY

THE HALL

To honor seniors, outstanding‘ in their four years
of college life for honesty, leadership, good character,
and hard work, the OVVL HALL OF FAIVIE was
created about twenty years ago. Every year since
that precedent, an authoritative committee composed
of faculty members and junior men and women have
considered many students and selected those in whom

these qualities were best exempliﬁed.

At Tap Day on lVIay 5, the names of the following
twenty—four men and women chosen by the com-
mittee were revealed. Each has given service to
the University far in excess of the average demand
for time and cooperation. Each has established a

record that may Well be aimed at by underclassmen.

SCHO0LS

SCHO0L (IF BUSINESS ADMINISTIlATION

Give it a “personal touch” is the keyword in the
School of Business Administration, for in addition to
the usual curriculum of accounting, economics, and
business math is included a quota of business person-
ality learning. Emphasizing business conduct, the
courses are planned so that the student may become
acquainted with the cultural as well as the technical
side of business activity. After the “Biz Ad” masters
the history of the mores, the philosopy of Adam Smith,
the “ins and outs" of corporation law, he is ready to
enter the business world with some assurance of
success.

Heading the department is Dean Vincent VV.
Lanfear, Who is well known and liked for his friendly
attitude and Texan accent. Dean Lanfear was
graduated from the School of Business Administration
himself, and he is a welcome counsellor to the students
now . . . for many a student‘s problem is erased after
a chat with him.

THE COLLEGE

Because of his unassuming and friendly ways, Dr.
Stanton C. Crawford is a favorite among the students-
As director of the activities of the largest under-
graduate body in the University, he has a particular
interest in the problems of education, and the careers
of young people.

Dr. Crawford has seen that there are no disruptive
changes in the wartime curriculum of the College-
His interests reach into the classics, local history,
biological research, and detective stories. His pro-
fessions varied from teacher and zoologist to Dean
of the College.

Dean Crawford believes that young people should
be well trained in carrying out their careers. He
believes too that the Humanities course can help
students who intend to take professional training by
working in creative work. In this way, Dr. Crawford
is directing their efforts toward important wartime
and post-war aims. His hope is that these young men
and women will play an important part in these
changing times.

SCHO0L 0F

Playing an important part in the curriculum of the
University and in training our teachers of tomorrow
is the School of Education headed by Dean S. P.
Franklin. It has been a difficult year for both students
and faculty due to the changes that have and are
taking place in order to keep pace with the needs of
the day. Though for the n1ost part the department
has continued along oﬂ’eriI1g the same courses, it has
added one new course . . . pre—aeronautics, which has
proven itself extremely helpful to those boys who plan
to enter the Air Corps.

Dean Franklin, who is a firm believer in the

SCIIO0LS 0F ENGINEERING AND MINES

“Behind the brawn the brain” . . . and the
Schools of Engineering and Mines function to
train engineers to serve this district, according
to Elmer A. Holbrook, dean for seventeen years.
The school is divided into seven departments:
Aeronautical, Chemical, Civil, Electrical,
General, Industrial and l\Ieel1ani(:al. In in-
dustrial engineering—the men and women, for
there are women—turn toward chemical and
electrical projects. At the beginning of the
war, an inﬂux of embryo engineers registered at
the school, but at the present time, the enroll-
ment is on a downward slope. Under the
quota system set up at Wasliington, only a
limited number of students may be accepted
each year. The expedited program now calls
for four semesters a year . . . holidays are one
day affairs . . . the students never know in
the morning what their status will be at night

. and so they work on to prepare to recon-
struct normal living i11 the post—war world.

SCHO0L 0F DENTISTRY

The School of Dentistry has become an even
more integral part of the University. The
Dental students . . . now in army and navy
garb . . . serve as an important'part of the
social service demanded in any community
though many of them now have to leave the
University to serve in the armed forces.
Through his extensive research and his personal
effort, Dr. H. Edmund Friesell, Dean of the
school, has achieved national recognition for
the excellence of the University’s dental school.
Due to his tireless work of continually build-
ing up the dental library, it is acknowledged
to possess one of the greatest collections of rare
and early volumes in the ﬁeld of dentistry.

TAY MALARKEY

DENTISTRY

One of our brightest stars on the athletic
ﬁeld is Clair Malarkey, better know to students
and faculty as Tay. Basketball is his game,
and he not only played three years of varsity
ball, but also coached the Dent School basket—
ball team. In true “Rinkey-Dink” manner,
Tay never played any one position permanently,
but switched on every game if need be.

Last fall, Tay went out for football for the
ﬁrst time. He showed up as one of the team's
best passing bets, until he was hurt in the
Great Lakes game on October 2. As a result
of his knee injury, Tay spent about two and
a half months in St. Francis Hospital. He was
forced to drop out of school—and, of course,
he was missed on the basketball squad.

A senior in Dental School, Tay was class
president for four years. He was treasurer of
Dental Student Council his sophomore year,
and vice president his junior year. He is a
pledge to Psi Omega, dental professional
fraternity. After the war, Tay is planning to
set up ofﬁces with his brother, also a dentist.

Dental Interfraternity Council might meet in odd
places, yet its purpose is an established one. Two
representatives from each of the three dental fratern-
ities make up the council, and part of their job is to
regulate rushing for membership. Each rushee, to
be eligible to Alpha Omega, Psi Omega, or Delta
Sigma Delta must have a passing average, one
semester in dental school, and be approved by the
dean of the school.

Ofﬁcers of the council are rotated to give each house
a turn at the presidency every three years. This
year’s council whirled out with a dance and later hit
Pitt sportlines hard with their basketball showings.
Among the fraternities, the Friesell cup is the big
stake and this year's playoﬂs will decide which house
is to keep it permanently.

Not many organizations at Pitt can boast that
ninety per cent of their alumni are serving Uncle Sam
actively, but Alpha Omega is one that can! In spite
of wartime changes, the AO’s held their annual
formal dinner—dance at the Hotel VVebster Hall last
September, when forty people dined and danced.
Their house at 3515 Forbes Street is often the scene
of clinics which are given by various members of the
faculty and alumni from Dental School. There are
about twenty-five boys living in the house and the
present membership of the fraternity totals seventy,
with most of the fellows in school wearing the uniforms
of the Army or Navy. The AO‘s are active in Dental
School sports, and they now hold two of three legs
which are necessary to win the H. E. Friesell Athletic
Cup.

Thirty six members of Delta Sigma Delta, pro-
fessional dental fraternity meet twice a month in
their chapter house at 2-11 Darragh Street under their
colors of turquoise and garnet. Sigma chapter at
Pitt shares the same fraternal secrets as their brothers
in England, France, and Australia do. Their aim is
“to keep high the standards of dentistry byinculcating
the minds of dental students and practicioners a
spirit of fraternal co—operation toward scientific,
ethical, and profession progress.”

The fraternity publication, Desmos, uses up the

inter-fraternity dental athletics or parties at the
chapter house. Chapter deputy is Dr. DeVVitt Hall
who keeps things right-side up.

The 23 Psi O’s living at their house at 230 North
Belleﬁeld Avenue have been very busy these days as
all of the boys are either in the Army or the Navy.
Their faithful housemother must satisfy the hunger
calls of a full dining room three times a day. Frequent
house dances do their best to ﬁll in the temporary
gaps made by the curtailment of formal affairs. And
for more rugged sports, the service Unit 3307 Basket-
ball team uses three Psi Omega men. The Psi O‘s
competing with the Alpha Omega boys, need but one
more leg to win the H. E. Friesell Cup. Dean Friesell
and Dr. VV. F. Swanson are two of the big boys wl1o
were former Psi Omegas and are now on the school
faculty.
