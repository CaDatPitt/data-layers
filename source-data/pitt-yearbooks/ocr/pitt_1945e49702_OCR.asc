DEDICATION

Not to one man or to one generation do
we dedicate this book. Rather, we wish
to honor every individual and every
generation which have contributed to
making Pitt since the days of Hugh Henry
Brackenridge's Academy. To those who
have given to the spirit of Pitt, to those
who have guided its ever—upWard
growth, to those who have loved Pitt, we

dedicate this OWL.

"Thou who unto knowledge bore us,
In the good old days long gone,
Raise the Gold and Blue high o'er us,

Lead and we will follow on."

—George M. Baird

The War's impact didn't bypass our
campus and leave it a vacuum of
smugness. You can see its shadow

But through all these war changes
we've managed to remember that Pitt
is more than what's written ‘on our
schedules, that it's a collection of
things we've seen and worked on and
thought out together, that adds up to
something mighty important. We've
hung on to our traditions because we

know that they're as necessary as our
classes, that they'll outlast the war
and be a part of the peace to come.
We know, too, that the fellows over-
seas oiten think back upon their Pitt
days and hope we haven't let the war
change us much. It's kind of an un-
written pact between us, that we'll
keep Pitt what it always has been and
always will be—a way of life based
on things that count.

[117]

[118]

 

There are little things, things and
people near and dear to us; without
them, none of our yearly whirl of col-
lege life would be possible. Doc F er-
guson, our prof "Fergie," never fails
to walk through the Tuck Shops with
his daily newspaper at lunch hour.
At his expense we have our first look
at the headlines. The elevator men
wink at us and Cluck when we com--
plain about exams to them. Down in
Panther Hollow we have our hot dog
roasts and fellows put their arms
around their girls when the night
chills, and the embers of the fire bathe
the circle of faces with orange flames.
Even our Cwen box, and our informa-
tion room represent intimate traditions.
We leave notes, crazy notes and im—
portant notes, in the box, and we

corner classmates in the hall when we
never find a note for ourselves—every—
one wants a letter. But invariably, we
all trek to the Information Room, upper
classmen as well as freshmen, for
other things besides a note. Here we
find Bill Daufenbach who knows our
Pitt so well. He and the assistants to
the Dean of Women have details at
their fingertips enabling us to call a
professor, or find out when certain
classes are scheduled. Then there's
the King Eddie, the G. B., and Yohe's
where we go after school or in the
evening.

ing books sliding down the desk slot.
Ann, our telephone operator. "She's
the laughingest person," we always
say as she reminds us to stop in her
little third floor buzz nest of activity,
just to say hello. And while we're in
the third floor neighborhood there's
Professor Peterson. In the university
guide, Pete is labeled as an English
professor. In our hearts, he's a "right"
guy, a wonderful man, a prof who
knows his stuff and who makes us
like to know it, too.

Our Wednesday noon dances, an
innovation this year, found their place
with us immediately. Soon, they'll be
as much a part of our Pitt way as the
candy man on the corner of "Up Hill,"

right near State Hall with his box of
Clark bars and Klondikes. lt's the
same with the coke machine on the
ground floor of State I-lall. If the
machine's broken, we huddle around
it and everyone wants to give it a
good bang because "I just hafta have
my coke!" And the plaque up in Thaw
Hall where the grades are posted, and
the pep rallies down in Stephen Fos-
ter Memorial—all these belong to us
in a personal and intimate way. Pitt
wouldn't be Pitt without them.

On the ground floor of the Cathedral,
we have our post office—that familar
little wooden box where we chuck our
V-mails on the way to class! And the
book—store, jammed to the doors right
after registration with book buyers,
and then quiet and cozy a few weeks
later, so that we can even see the
counters from the hall-way. In the
Tuck Shops around the corner from
the store, there's Nancy who tells us

a student buy more than one pack of
cigarettes, but says all this in such a
nice way, we don't mind it at all.

Then, there's the sleeping room on
the 28th floor where Pitt women can
rest during the day—after a big date
the night before. On the second floor,
we have both men and women's
memories—the Pan-hel and IF sing,
between classes. And there's always
Lilly Court, our special meeting place.
In spring, when the apple blossoms
burst into pink puffs, couples stand on
the Court, holding hands and looking
at the streamline street cars buzzing
by on Forbes Street.

Our Sunset Luncheon, traditionally
held for the women graduates of the
University, takes place before every
commencement. There's something of
a bit of sadness as well as joy in this
ceremony, for the co—eds realize they're
leaving their home of four years, and
each of them will soon be going her

separate way. But they have their
memories—the Pan Hel and IF sing,
Freshman Council, "way," way back
when they were still asking for direc-
tions to the Tuck Shops, frat dances
and the question "Who got pinned
last week—end?", the excitement of
ODK initiation, and the cooling dark-
ness of I-Ieinz Chapel during the serv-
ices.

It's a great university—Pitt. Although
we all must leave eventually, we have
the consolation that there will always
be men and women who will carry on
the traditions, who will love Pitt as we,
who will know there will be others
after them, and still others. .

It's a colorful panorama, our way of
life, and it has a funny way of grow-

LOOKING UPWARD

In these days of turmoil and dark victories it is good
to be able to see beyond the black clouds, to be able
to look up—and ahead. As the ch.ild looks to his
parent and as man looks to his God, we search for
that above us. 'Point me to the skies,’ the Bible reads
and a church steeple directs us heaven-ward. lnspir-
ation comes in a shimmer of sunlight on a gold cross
against blue sky. The same inspiration, same lofti—
ness, grew with the Cathedral of Learning. Walk
down your ODK walk. Unconsciously your face turns
upward and sunshine warms your face. This upward
impulse is more than a physical reaction. Chancellor
Bowman wanted the University to be an inspiration—
a call to new heights. And that is what he wants Pitt
to do for each senior before he is graduated, for each
professor before he teaches, and for each soldier who
returns here at dusk. The 1945 OWL, then, should
be albook to show how our University, in its fourth
year of war, looks ahead. It should tell that we can
see beyond Salerno and victory shifts and casualty
lists, without forgetting them. The OWL is a written
promise that we are building—with eyes sky high»—

building upward and ever looking beyond.

Customs Brunch they roar at zany
skits and consume incredible numbers
of hot dogs. December brings more
warmth to the Commons Room; we sit
in front of the fireplaces and smell the
burning pine logs and drink tea, We
gather 'round the piano on Friday
afternoons and sing; and we love the
Way it looks at the Chancellor's Re-
ception, with the shifting patterns of
the crowds against the crimson velvet
drapery and the shadowy stone walls.
Our Pitt December means, too, the
Senior Supper, the smell of formalde-
hyde from the biology labs penetrat-
ing the elevator shafts, and the serv-
icemen's edition of the News. and
Vade Mecums crammed with remind-
ers of luncheon dates, committee meet-
ings, and exams. And, above all, it
means our own special Christmas
spirit that starts when we first see the
spicy fir trees and the huge holly

organ fills the Cathedral with the mel-
odies of the carols, and the last day
of class brings our favorite party, com-
plete With a padded, whiskered Santa
Claus whose pack holds gifts and
striped peppermint canes for every-
one. After vacation, exam week looms
u.p—and the Cathedral is subdued
into a World of crowded libraries and
sleepy—eyed students. We frantically
whip up term papers and complain
of writers cramp as We stagger out
of two-hour exam sessions. A Week of
sleep and rather strenuous relaxation,
and we're ready to start all over
again. Our February calendar is
made up of Pitt Players productions
and_Charter Day and Women's rush-
ing, with the suspense of silence

ribbons. We file over to Foster Me-
morial to honor our outstanding class-
mates whose names are inscribed in

SENIOR QUEEN NOMINEES

Twenty years ago in a ceremony similar to that of a ninth century English cor--
onation, the first Senior Queen of the University of Pittsburgh was crowned. Since
then, each year Pitt Senior women pay tribute to their elected Senior Queen and
Alma Mater, chosen from senior nominees.

Pitt's Senior Queen, the highest honor a senior girl may receive, has a royal
reign of one year. Possessing ideals of fine womanhood, outstanding character,
personality, and beauty, participating in extracurricular activities, maintaining
high academic standing, she is a girl who has gven unselfish service to the
University.

Each of the nominees is a senior girl who has been chosen by her class-
mates because she possessed these qualities. Each of them represents our ideal
of what a woman graduate of the University should be. But to one of them be-
longs the honor of being the Senior Queen, to the second highest, Alma Mater,
chief attendant to the queen. On May 26, Queen Helen l-ladgis received her
crown from Alma Mater, Lucille Morgan, in the beautiful Common's Room
Coronation.

PITT OWL

Pitt Owl did not become his great self by being born that
way. He was, .in fact, just a common owl until he got the last bit
of owl egg—shell picked off himself. Then he began to add nice,
though small, improvements to his personality. lust what he did
of this sort we do not know, for he is never very confidential. But
we do know that on his first ﬂight from the Deep Woods he came
to a high niche on the Cathedral where he has lived ever since.
Very likely it does not matter that his bringing up is rather
obscure.

From these early days Pitt Owl has shown that he is not a
common owl. For one thing, he never suggests that you look up
to him. Yet something about his personality rather requires
that you do look up to him—living as he does at so high a niche.
This shows his whimsical notion that it is good always to look up.

Pitt Owl seems to be mostly feathers, the kind you would
l.ike to touch if you could reach so high and were sure that he
would not bite. He never has a bedraggled look. He never
has a hungry look, either, and there is not a hint about his feath-
ers or bill that he has ever eaten one of the pigeons that some-

times fly near his bailiwick. In these ways he shows that he is
a likable bird.

The plainest thing about Pitt Owl is that he has got wisdom.
He never makes a noise that is just a nuisance. He does make
noise, but it is always of a tuneful heart-stirring sort~—the kind
you would make if you knew how. Mostly, though, he listens;
his ear-tufts, longer and iluffier than ear-tufts of common owls,
show that. In the fleche on the Heinz Chapel he listens to the
organ and to the choir and to sermons; and in his niche he
listens in on science talks. If you ask him what helikes to listen
to, he just turns the other way. He will not answer you by a nod
toward the Chapel or toward the Cathedral. Yet you can not
possibly miss the main idea in his head which is, of course, that
it took a great deal of different kinds of listening to become Pitt
Owl. But if you ask even a sillier question, he would not hoot
you. He would probably hoot, not at you but in a nice advisory
way, sounding somewhat like You—oo—oo-can-be-you—oo-oo.
That hoot is said to be an intimation about everyone at Pitt.
Even on short acquaintance his wisdom is awfully plain.

Pitt Owl likes to be seen—not that he uses claw or bill
polish. But he does like to be seen; that is, to have friends who
are not dumb or too slow to get an idea. The tilt of his head
one way or another shows that. He never rolls his eyes, and in
telling one idea or another seldom lifts a wing. But when an
extra good idea comes along, such as some mention about
pigeons, he likes to dance a step or two, wings up. If you take
down what he says in any one of his best minutes, it makes an
English theme that would get marked A plus. So it is plain why
it is good to have Pitt Owl around and why he is looked up to
as he sits in his high niche, especially at about 8:00 A.l\/l., buff
in the sunshine, looking East.

MILITARY PROGRAM AT PITT

Midyear—l945——one company of the
Army Specialized Training Program
remains at Pitt. These soldiers are the
medical students, and they alone are
left of the thousands of men who were
the army students at the University.
Usually any curtailment of a program
is edged with sadness; and true, we
miss the army in full force about the
walls, in the streets, and in and out of
the classrooms. For three years, the
A.S.T.P. and the Army Air Corps have
been an integral part of the life of
every student at Pitt. We trudged up
to State Hall for classes because the
army needed the space in the Cathe-
dral; we found faculty and student
organization offices stuck in buried
places because the army moved in.
VV hole floors in the Cathedral became
forbidden ground—these the quarters
for the soldiers and the military offices.
Socially, each of us remembered the
army and thought and planned for all
our activities in terms of the army, but
the army at Pitt literally marched
away.

Thinking—really feeling—our way
back to 1942-43, we remember the first
to come were the army air corps.
Boisterous, immature kids with basic
training in the "l-largrove" manner
just behind them, the cadets studied.
—struggled with themes, math, science
and history. As Pitt experienced her
fifth war year, no one in this vicinity of
Oakland can forget the singing sol-
diers marching through the streets.
And then in May and June of 1944,
company after company was put on
alert and shipped from the University.
As suddenly as the air corps invaded
Pitt and took over the buildings and
our hearts did they leave. They had
come to us for training to do the job
the nation had put before them; they
left having been made more than fit
for that task.

[150]

The air corps had barely been
settled when the first company of the
Army Specialized Training Program
arrived at the University. Originally,
there were eight companies of the
A.ST's occupying six floors of the
Cathedral. Their classifications were:
Company A, advanced engineers and
pre—medical; Company B, dental; Com-
pany C, medical; Company D, Pitt
men returned; Companies E, F, and
G, engineers; Company H, foreign
languages. Company D interests us
because the men left Pitt for a week
to go to induction centers and were
sent right home to Pitt again as part
of the army program. No schedule
was interrupted; the only difference
was that the boys were put into uni—-
form. Working and living with us, the
A.S.T.P. feuded with the air corps and
fitted themselves into our scheme of
things. They were an older group;
the majority of them had some pre-
vious college training. The men en-
tangled themselves in our lives, and
just as we were taking them for
granted, company after company
marched away.

With the exception of the few in the
Navy V—l2 and Civil Officers’ Training
Program, the air corps and A.S.T.P.
completed the military ranks at Pitt.
True, even before military training
became an extreme national neces-
sity, the R.O.T.C. was making men
ready to hold reserve commissions in
the army. After war was declared
and the military program was intro-
duced at Pitt, the R.O.T.C. continued
to function as a program for pre—induc—
tion. The men were given classes in
general military information such as
discipline, and they had an edge on
anyone who had received no military
training.

As it has done with every activity,
Pitt wanted a way to acknowledge

the superiority of some of the men in
military drill and to give more oppor-
tunity for training in military leader-
ship. And so in 1932, Pitt Rifles, honor-
ary fraternity for basic corpsmen, was
organized. They met twice a week to
carry out their two—part program: drill-
ing when the weather permitted, other-
wise, studying from the manual or
military battle films. The result of the
drilling showed last year when Pitt
R.O.T.C. Rifle team took Georgia Tech,
Texas A & M and other foes in shoot-
ing tilts. This year, Pitt Rifles was com-
posed of only fifteen members.

In complete charge of the vmilitary
program as well as one of the favorite
R.O.T.C. professors is Major Merlin
Wills. During the five years Major
VV ills has spent at Pitt, he has become
a student favorite because of his un-
assuming friendliness and eagerness
to cooperate anytime his office can
oblige. Major Wills and his staff are
a real part of the reason for the suc-
cess of the military program at the
university.

We have with us again M/ Sgt. james
T. Doherty, Sgt. Thomas I. Riedl, ]r.,
and Sgt. Watts I. Shablowski. Writ-
ing the records of these men is like
writing the record of the war.

Iim Doherty, for instance, served
overseas 281/2 months; he was a mem-

Navy V-12 unit rnustering at
Headquarters

ber of the Military Mission to Russia
and to Iran, and he saw service in
South Africa, Arabia, Egypt, Syria,
Iraq, Iran, lndia, Burma, and Russia.
And so with Tom Riedl, a Pittsburgh
man who went to Central Catholic,
and saw service in England, North
Africa, Sicily, and Italy during the
twenty-four months he was overseas.
Watt Shablowski, with the famous
"Eifhting Eirst Infantry Division" for
eighteen months, was in Scotland,
England, North Africa, and Sicily.
These boys all wear ribbons—some
of the decorations that demand ban-
ner headlines. Tom Riedl saw Cassino
destroyed, and he was wounded at
that famous Benedictine Monastery
that he had read about in Central
Catholic. Watts was wounded in
Sicily.

And so the story goes. The men
come here to learn to fight and to
lead the fighting in a war which must
guarantee the right of each of them to
come to the University in the era of
peace. The subjects are taught, the
men study and drill and then move on
to fields of combat. Each does his job,
and once again some of them come
back to Pitt to learn to live in a world
without war. Pitt at war, Pitt at peace!
May the men who trained here take
away memories that are kind.

FOOTBALL

For four war years the men of our Uni-
versity have been playing a far more
serious game than any that they faced
at Pitt. And the record these men are
m.aking in the armed forces is answer
enough to those who condemned big-
time collegiate sport these many years.
We have had our ups and downs, our
victory headlines, our buried, space-
filler story on the pages of the sports’
sections of the nation. For a longrwhile
it was Goldberg and Thurbon and big
time; we grew smug, confident—we
built the stadium and Saturday after
Saturday, we filled it with football fans.
Basketball, baseball, tennis, swimming
—Pitt, the unconquerable. And then,
for many reasons, sports became de-
emphasized, the banner headlines be-
came smaller and smaller as Pitt met
top teams and stumbled under their

power. Even before December l94l,
the University proved to be fallible;
Pitt could and had been beaten.

And because the world outside of
Pitt looks at the outcome from the score-
board, they believed we were fighting
a losing battle. The Big Ten watched
for us to join the Purity League, waited
for us to give up. But there was some-
thing that the outside world could not
be expected to know about —that
something was the Pitt determination
to fight. We had many excuses to give,
but war year after war year, Pitt
began each fall with a suicide pro-
gram in athletics. Men left the campus
in groups; freshmen played key posi-
tions on the football team. True, we lost
more games than we won, but we
played hard, clean games—-games de-
dicated to each of you who are away,

to each of you who are to come. Dur-
ing these years, with the seventeen
year olds, we were more worthy of the
world's acclaim than we had been in
the old days. With this history of tri-
umph and defeat, we look at the past
year. The worst is past; Pitt is now on
the up—grade. Men are returning to Pitt
In all fields, we scored this year, and
looking forward, we once again can
see the banner headlines.

Despite the rumors which had
Clark Shaughnessy leaving Pitt to
coach pro football, he was back to
coach the 1944 Blue and Gold Panth-
ers. Adding Dr. Danny Fortrnann to his
coaching staff, Shaughnessy and his
assistants began work in late summer
to mold a team. Doc l-lartwig, a Pitt All-
American in l934, took over at his old
post as end coach, while the other vet-
eran on the staff, Stan Olenn, instruct-
ed the guards and tackles. The back-
field was under the tutelage of the mas-
ter of the T and Dr. Danny Portmann,

 

Notre Dame

former Colgate and Chicago Bear pro-
fessional football player.

The Panthers opened on Septem-
ber 23 against West Virginia Univer-
sity at the stadium. This was more or
less a warmup for the next week's as-
signment against Notre Dame, and the
Panthers defeated their "cousins" 26-
13. Operating efficiently from Shaugh—
nessy's famed T formation, the Panth-
ers, a freshmen-dominated team bul-
warked by a handful of veterans,
made 19 first downs to 5 forWest Vir-
ginia. The lungle Cats had the 8,000
fans on their feet time and time again
as they unveiled a passing and run-
ning attack which brought back fond
memories of the Sutherland Scythe.
Paul Richards filled the air with spot
passes which were grabbed by glue-
fingered Pitt ends and fast moving
backs. The Panthers broke into the
scoring column late in the first quarter
when George Ranii recovered a West
Virginia fumble on the Pitt 25. The Pan-
thers drive was climaxed when Tom
Kalmanir plunged across from the 1/2
yard line. In the second half the Pan-
ther machine really started to roll. The

Pitt men scored on a sustained 48 yard

drive down field and then again when

Tom Kalmanir crossed the goal for his
second score of the afternoon after a
62 yard drive. Pitt added its final touch-
down on a 77 yard march with Freese
scoring, making it a perfect debut for
Clark Shaughnessy in his second year
at Pitt.

It was a perfect day for football.
The grass seemed to shimmer on the
sun-baked gridiron. Fifty thousand
howling fans poured into the stadium.
Notre Dame had come to town! But
this year the story would be different,
for although the lrish were odds—on-
favorites, there was an awful lot of
Panther sentiment to be found around
town. But despite the build-up, the re-
sult was a one sided win for the sons
of South Bend. Notre Dame struck with
speed and power as they smothered
the Panthers under a barrage of aer-
ials and a varied running attack, 58-0.
The Irish, slow in getting their offense
rolling, completely disintegrated the
Panther defenses as they rolled up 39
points in the second half. The big noise
for Ed l\/lcKeever's men was Bobby
Kelly, who performed brilliantly as he
personally chalked up 26 points before
leaving the game early in the third
quarter. Outstanding for the Panthers
was the defensive play of Guard Fran
Mattioli and Fullback lack ltzel. The
sterling play of the burly guard began
to attract possible early season All-
American mention. 0

Bethany

 

The Panthers, bouncing back from
a 58-0 trouncing by Notre Dame, shov-
ed over touchdowns in every quarter
to trample little Bethany college of
West Virginia 50-13. Only 1,500 fans,
perhaps the smallest crowd in Pitt foot-
ball history, witnessed the game. Fleet-
footed Tommy Kalmanir sparked the
Panthers with three touchdowns. loe
Mocha, tiny quarterback star of last
year's Pitt team who is now a V—l2 stu-
dent at Bethany, starred for the visi-
tors. The Panthers won the game eas-
ily but paid heavily for this victory
when they lost the services of Fran
Mattioli for the remainder of the season
because of a back injury.

As expected, the Panthers, when
they traveled up to the Plains of V\/' est
Point, were no match for the Army who
racked up 69 points to Pitt's 7. Carl
Blaik's Cadets played the role of the
nation's number one footfall team to

perfection. And the Shaughnessy men
got a look at perhaps the best backs in

the country as Doc Blanchard, Glen

Davis, Doug Kenna, Dale Hall, Bob
Dobbs, and Max Minor whizzed by
them or ran roughshod over them.
Pitt's youthful squad averted a com-
plete rout by scoring on a one yard
plunge by Gene Gaugler one minute
and sixteen seconds before the final
gun sounded. The aerial onslaught
that was led by sharp-shooting Paul
Richards netted the Panthers 220
yards and set up their only tally. Clark
Shaughnessy, despite the overwhelm-
ing defeat, still had hopes of pulling
some surprise upsets out of the bag. A
defense was mapped out to stop Illi-
nois the following week.

So Illinois came to town but the
surprise upset was lost somewhere in
the touchdown parade. The speedy
football team, sparked by a "Stop
Watch Backfield" that specialized in
long runs, humiliated the once power-

 

Chuthum Field

ful Pitt team with its score, 39-5, before
7,000 discouraged fans that dotted the
empty stadium. Living up to their pre-
game reputation, Coach Bay Eliot's
Campaign Speedsters scored in every
period as they held the hapless Pan-
thers to a first period field goal and a
third quarter safety. Backs Paul Patter-
son, Don Greenwood, an.d the "Flying
Flea," Buddy Young, spelled defeat

_ for Pitt as they scored five touchdowns,

three on runs of 80, 62 and 92 yards,
while Don Johnson accounted for the
sixth score. After Pitt had taken the
early 3-0 lead on Mike Roussos' 16
yard first period field goal, Greenwood
exploded an 81 yard touchdown run
on the following kickoff and started
the lllini fireworks. For the first seven
minutes of the game it looked good for
the Panthers, but after the first period
drive, climaxed by the successful field
goal try, the Shaughnessy-men went to
pieces as they fumbled time and again.

With two successive defeats al-
ready chalked up against them, the
Panthers were out for revenge and the
Chatham Field Fliers were their prey.
The Fliers were a group of air corps
men who had seen foreign service and
liked to play football. Tarzan White, a

former All-American, was drafted as
player-coach and organized a team.
The Fliers ﬂew here from Georgia in
B—24's for their encounter on the Sta-
dium turf. Pitt entered. the game as a
heavy favorite and as the gun sound-
ed to end the half the score was dead-
locked 0-0. The Jungle Cats received
the breaks and Iohnny Lozar, Pitt full-
back, became the hero of the game
when he broke away for a touchdown
and put the Panthers ahead 6-0. Before
the game ended the Panthers rolled up
20 more points, walking off with a
hard-earned 26-0 win.

The schedule maker was kind to
the Panthers and gave them a week
of rest before they tangled with the
number one civilian team of the coun-
try—Ohio State! ''In Old Ohio's there's
ateam that's known throughout the
land." And how, brother, and how!
lust ask any bruised and battered Pan-
ther and he'll tell you that they're not
just a team but a championship outfit
—+Big Ten rating to be exact. The
Ohio State football powerhouse need-
ed the services of its regulars, for
less than one quarter as it walloped
the Panthers 54-19. The pitiful Pittmen
didn't have a look-in until Coach Car-
rol Widdows began sweeping the
bench clean of substitutes. In the first
half, the Buckeyes rolled up a 41-0
lead. The Panthers finally came to life
in the second half when they outscor--

Ohio State

 

ed the Buckeye's second stringers l9-
l3. With Paul'Richards tossing passes
from every corner of the lot, Zimmovan
and Sarles went over for two scores
while the third was set up for George
Freese's plunge. Pitt's second half
showing atoned somewhat for its lack-
adaisical performance that marked
the first two quarters.

The Panthers, following the sage
advice of Horace Greely, went west to
take on the University of Indiana
where Bo McMillan's Po Little Boys
made the clawless Panthers dance to
the tune of 47-0. It was the last home
game of the year for the l-loosiers and
they celebrated it by whitewashing
Pitt. Shaughnessy's men never were in
the ball game as the rubbery right arm
of "Hunchy" l-loernschmeyer, the
Western Conference's leading passer,
hurled three touchdown passes and
chalked up seven completions for a to-

tal of 144 yards gained. However, it
was far from a one man show as Dick
Deranek, Racehorse Halfback, also
scored twice, once on a beautiful 46
yard run. The boys from Bloomington
scored twice in every period except the
last, when they tallied but once. The
only offensive threat and bright spot
in the day was the passing of Paul
Richards who completed 13 for 187
yards.

Pitt bade farewell to the 1944 sea-
son and no tears were shed in the part-
ing as they handed Penn State a 14-0
shaving. It looked like the good old
days had returned to the stadium atop
the hill. Blue and gold and blue and
white banners waved amidst the fans,
bottles were passed down the rows,
and the Pitt band filled the air with
music while the members lined the
gridiron with numerous formations.
Th.e Penn State Lion wrestled with the
Panther on the soggy track as the
cheerleaders raised the crowd's spirits.
Entering the game as underdogs, the
Panthers went to work in business-like

fashion, threatening twice in the first
period, staving off two State threats in
the second and then putting the game
on ice in the third. The gun to start the
second half had just sounded and a
booming kick landed on the Pitt 7 yard
line. Bernie Sniscak picked up the pig-
skin and started down field, he gath-
ered blockers, dodged Lion tacklers,
and then raced through the remaining
Nittany team to pay-dirt. It was the
turning point of the game and the most
brilliant Pitt run of the year. ln its
eagerness to win, Pitt was penalized a
substantial 132 yards. The Panthers
scored again in the third period but it
proved anticlimatic as Gaugler cross-
ed the goal two plays after Braner in-
tercepted Petche1's pass on States 46
and ran to the 15.

That was it—another football sea-
son ended. And suddenly all attention
turned to basketball, and our cagemen
began to erase the football defeats.

If we could only have played all our
games at home this season, Dr. H. C.
Carlson's slogan "Win 'em All" might
have come true. Dr. Carlson coined
this phrase soon after he became the
Pitt basketball mentor 23 years ago
and once in his long career has it come
true. This year, he again had hopes of
an unmarred season but after the fifth
contest it was "Wait 'till next year."
The Panthers floored a very strong

ler, all veteran and experienced. play-
ers found in the starting line up. Other
members who added great strength to

the squad were Dodo Canterna, Frank
Morris, Phil Marder, Carl Michalik and
Morris lacobsen. The Blue and Gold
opened their twelve game, abbreviat-
ed, season against a weak Allegheny
College in Meadville on December 15.
The boys gave Dr. Carlson an early
Christmas present as they handed the
Gators a 61-31 shellacking. Frank Mor-
ris, a plebe from Avalon, played a mas-
terful game at one of the guard posts
only to be surpassed in performance
by Captain Tay Malarkey. The fans at
Meadville had a chance to see the
whole Pitt team as Dr. Carlson yanked
his starters and flooded the floor with
substitutes.

The jungle Cats had a holiday
vacation and they didn't get back into
the swing of things until lanuary 3
when they met Geneva on the Pavil-
ion floor. The Panthers were the un-
derdogs in their home encounter but
that mattered little to the hosts as they
beat the Coventers 49-45. Pitt's actual

strength was unknown, for it couldn't.

be judged by the performance against
an inexperienced Allegheny team, yet
the fans were beginning to wonder if
Pitt had been over-estimated when
Geneva led 24-20 at the half. The sec-
ond half painted a different picture. In
the third quarter Pitt outscored the
Coventers 20-11 and from then until
the gun shot, the Skyscraper Quintet
stayed ahead. As usual, Tay l\/lalarkey
and Nate Apple played their brilliant
game, but a new name, that of Phil
Marder, was added to possible Pitt
hopefuls. _

Riding along on two victories, the
ball players, christened the Phantoms
by the good doctor, boarded a trolley
one week later to play their ancient
rival, Carnegie Tech. Pitt jumped off to
an early lead, scoring 20 points be-
fore the Tartans sunk a field goal.
Freshman Dodo Canterna led the at-
tack in the first half as he sank l2 of
his l8 points to lead in the evening's
scoring. If Dr. H. C. Carlson had want-
ed, he could have made the margin of
victory much more than the 59-45, but
he kept changing the line-up, trying to
find the best combination to face Penn
State on Saturday.

Zero hour arrived and the battle
began, Coach john Lawther's zone de-
sense faced Dr. Carlson's man—to-man
fast game of ball. Pitt couldn't be beat
that night, they were out to avenge last
year's double set-back and they did.
The Panthers piled up a 58-41 decision
over the Staters. Pitt broke into the lead
within the first minute of play and fail-
ed to lose it, even though the Staters
tied it up twice. Pitt unleashed a de-
vastating attack in the final period,
which brought the fans to their feet.

Carneaie Tech

Little Sam Consentino of Avalon, the
star of the game, bucketed three long
shots and a couple of fouls to put Pitt
far in front. Others who showed great
offensive power were l-lank Zeller, big
center and high scorer for the Panthers
with 14 points, and behind him with 12
points each were Malarkey, Consen-
tino and Canterna.

All good things must come to an
end and so it did. Pitt received its first
trouncing from Westminster at Farrell
68-47. The Panthers were right in the
ball game the first quarter and the
early part of the second as they match-
ed the Towering Titans point for point
but it didn't last long. Pitt went into a
tainspin when l\/lalarkey's_bad knee
was injured again and the first mark
in the loss column was registered.

The Phantoms started the second
half of their round robin schedule
against Carnegie Tech at the Stadium.
Dr. H. C. Carlson's Pitt basketeers had
just one man too many for their back-
yard rivals, this being six feet four
Hank Zeller. Hank played a brilliant
back board game, passed accurately
and had his share of tip ins as he rolled
up 19 points. Maxie l.-lannum's boys
got off to an early 2 point lead which
was soon erased by an erratic Pitt
team which didn't intend to be upset.
The Panthers put on the pressure and
led by 11 points at the half and ended
up on the long end of 67-41 final score.

[166]

Penn State

Again as in their first meeting, Dr.
Carlson sent in a ﬂood of substitutes
in the final period. .

The second half of the schedule is
the hardest and it took but three weeks
to find that out. The Panthers started
off the new semester with their second
win over Geneva on February 2. The
Pitt jinx over the Coventers was kept
alive as they handed them a 55-51
trimming.

The game with the Beaver Fallers
was one of those games that gives
coaches grey hair and heart trouble.
The game was a nip and tu.ck affair
throughout with the winner decided in
the last minute and a half of play. The
first half ended with the score tied 27
all and with minutes remaining in the
fourth period Pitt forged ahead with a
field goal to lead 53-51. Then Dodo
Canterna stepped up to the foul line
and whipped through the net to give
him 25 points and Pitt victory.

The game which all eagerly await-
ed for was next on the schedule and
Pitt hoped to be the team to break
Army's string of 24 consecutive wins.
On the afternoon of February 7th the
Panthers met the Cadets in the Field
House and the soldiers stretched their
string to 25 straight wins. Pitt started
off fast and held a lead in the first

Army

twelve minutes of play only to lose it
as Army tied at 19. Dr. Carlson sur-
prised the basketball gentry by spring«
ing a zone defense which broke up the
Cadet's lightning passes for a spell.
But the West Pointers wore Pitt to a
frazzle, sweeping to a 33-25 halftime
lead and ringing up an eight—point
cluster early in the second half to
make a runaway of the match. The
gleeful rooting corps of Cadets enjoy-
ed it when the colorful Carlson, made
famous by Look and Esquire. hop-
ped up to take umbridge with the offi—
cials once or twice. When Ed Kelleher,
Army mentor, followed suit at one
stage, Carlson cooled down his oppon-
ent by waving a towel. Despite the 71-
51 beating the Cadets handed Pitt, for
the first time this year Army started its
varsity.

After this sound beating the Panth-
ers were given a week to recuperate
before they met the Westminster Tit-
ans. The fans witnessed a one man
performance in the last three periods,
as Dodo Canterna swished the net for
37 points to make a new college scor--
ing record in Pittsburgh. ln his remark-
able performance Dodo rolled in 13
field goals and 11 free throws for the
37, but what made the performance
all the more remarkable was the fact

that Dodo went scoreless in the first
quarter and missed eight charity
tosses. Two entirely new teams ended
the game since every starter but Noble
lorgensen on the Titan squad got the
thumb in the second half for making
a quintet of miscues. Pitt lost two men,
Morris jacobsen and Hank Zeller as
the referee called 76 fouls, 21 more
than was called in the first Pitt—Tech
contest. These numerous fouls had
much to do with the 7556 final score.

Already with one victory over
Penn State, Pitt eagerly eyed victory
number two and a possible bid to ap—
pear in the Golden Tournaments in
New York, but a 53-36 loss helped
change their mind. The Panthers dis-
played their worst basketball form of
the season in Nittany territory. State
intercepted Pitt passes on all parts of
the hardwood, Panthers kicked the ball
as they dribbled, and in desperation,
shot wildly. State led ll—l near the end
of the first quarter and the closest Pitt
came to tying the score was l4—ll in
the second period as Hank Zeller gain-
ed control of the banking boards and
scored 20 points. Tay Malarkey de-

Westminster

serves special mention, too, for playing
with a badly injured knee. l-le gamely
fought through two-thirds of the game
—more than he had played since be-
ing injured in the first Westminster
game at Farrell.

Two games remained on the
schedule—both with West Virginia. lf
the Panthers win both, they gain the
mythical district crown but splitting
gives Westminster the honor and that's
just what happened. Pitt played the
first game on the Stadium floor and
walked off with an easy 55-34 victory.
The Panthers broke the Mountain
Men's zone defense wide open in the
second half and racked up 28 points to
the opposition's 8. ln Mountaineer ter-
ritory it was an entirely different pic-
ture. West Virginia played all around
head—up ball while the Panthers plug-
ged away trying to keep the game
close. Pitt succeeded and in the final
period tied the game three times before
being nosed out 50-47. That ended the
most successful season in years and an
undefeated one at home for the Pitt
quintet.

BASEBALL

"Win 'em All!" may be the slogan for
Coach Carlson and his basketball
team, but Coach l\/litterling only
pleads, "Win one!" to the much de-
feated nine playing baseball. With
confidence that the leads could be
changed this year in the Pitt News,
coach and team began the season,
but lefty Hank Eisenhant of Iuniata
thought differently when he pitched
his way to an 8-7 victory in the open-
ing game. Coach Mitterling started a
freshman hurler, George Goldberg,
who had to be relieved before 2 inn-
ings had passed. Finishing the last 7
innings was Big Jim Reber who yielded
but one hit.

Reber, through his excellent re-
lief performance earned the starting
role against Bucknell on the Lewis-
burg field. Everything happened that
day. Pitt faced an old team mate on
the mound, Jack Kelly, a Navy trainee,
stationed at the university. Kelly
bested three Panther hurlers as Reber
was pounded from the mound in the
sixth inning after yielding 9 runs. Star-
ring for the Panthers in their 10-6 loss
was second baseman, "Red" Mat-
thews, who was robbed of the possible
fourth on a beautiful stop by the third
sacker.

Army was number 3 on the schedule
and also loss number 3. The West
Pointers sent the Pitt team away from

the Plains with an 18-8 setback, their
worst defeat of the season. Dick Kin-
ney, Army hurler, held the Panthers
to 3 safeties in the first 6 innings before
being shelled from the mound with a
4 hit barrage and 6 runs. Iohn Lozar,
Pitt hurler, gave up l4 hits in 9 innings.
Old Iupiter Pluvis cancelled the return
game with Buckness, but on May 8th,
the Panthers lifted anchor and went
up to Annapolis. The Middies were
held hitless by Goldberg for 5 innings
but in the sixth the offensive was
opened. Goldberg was sent to the
showers by an 8 run burst and Pierce

was called to the rescue. The game
ended Navy lO—Pitt 5.

The Panthers were on the road
again and hosts for the day were the
Iuniata Indians. The Indians handed
the Iungle Cats a 4-2 setback. Ioe
Kielb, Pitt back-stop, put Pitt into the
ball game by slamming out a home

 

run which was one of the longest
drives ever seen in the Indian park.
Penn State supplied the opposition for

the final two contests. The Lions
blasted out a I6-6 victory in Nittany
territory and in the stadium the Staters
won 2-1; and there went our last hope
———well, at least that season.

Phi Ep's cop grid crown

INTERFRATERNITY SPORTS

There has been an equal distribu-
tion of first places among the various
fraternities. Only the PiKA'S have been
able to capture two crowns, those in
swimming and in mushball. ln both
these contests the PiKA's won easily
as they seemed to have talent in ex-
cess. Their excellent swimmer, Iohn
Dikeman, had no competition as he
easily won the backstroke, the breast-
stroke, and the free style races. The
mushball season took on an entirely
different aspect. With the Phi Grams
and the Pi Lams offering tough com~
petition, the PiKA's didn't win the title
until their last game.

Mr. Tommy Kalmanir and com-
pany took the interfraternity track
meet. With Kalminir winning the lUO
yard dash, the 220, and the high jump,
the Phi Delts managed to overcome
the Phi Gams and the PiKA's who were
tied for second. The Pi Lams, proving
that practice makes perfect, overcame
a host of opponents to become the ping
pong champions. With Nate Apple as

number one man on their four man
squad, the Pi Lams proved to all why
they were the heavy favorites in pre-
season ratings. Following this in stride,
the Phi Eps won the football champion-
ship with an amazing l8 to O conquest
over the PiKA's. Outstanding in the
football league were Wood and Gal-
lagher of the PiKA's, Beihl and Thom-
son of the Delts, Lampl and Weissman
of the Phi Eps, and Humes of the Phi
Delts.

 

INTRAMURAL SPORTS

The Pitt YMCA took it upon its
shoulders to organize and carry out an
intramural program at Skyscraper
University. Mr. Miller, secretary of the
Pitt Y, put the burden on Iohn Pager
and Morton Lerner to divide the boys
into teams and arrange a schedule.
Every Thursday night in the Cathedral
Gym marked the time and place of the
basketball and ping pong games,
Whereas the mushball team used
Tree's Field for their diamond and the
Y lounge served as the meeting place
for the Chess Club.

Leading the basketeers into battle
were Bill Boyd of the Boyd Blitzes, Fos-
ter l-ladges captaining the Mustangs,
Zola Gold of the Golden Panthers, and
Mel Snitzer heading the Flashes. The

, Golden Panthers proved too much for

the remaining flock and easily walked
away with the crown. From these four
competing teams an all star cast was
chosen which challenged any frater-

nity on Pitt campus. The Y men came
out with an unblemished record.

Iohn Biddle took it upon himself to
run off a ping pong tournament with
all interested. A group of fifteen com-
peted in this round robin affair and
many a hot match were played. After
all had cooled down and the final
match completed, the winner was Bert
Lipsum.

For the first time in University his-
tory a Chess Club was formed which
urged all those who played chess to
join. Bob Garbe was elected president
of the group and held regular meet~
ings each Thursday, at which time the
games were played. .

Mushball marked the end of Pitt's
1944-45 intramural program with Tom
Gorman taking over as skipper and
arranging the schedule. At the pres-
ent the team is getting in its practice
sessions and won't get started in actual
competition until May.

Rufus H. Fitzgerald, Vice-Chancellor

The Cathedral of Learning is concrete
proof of how a man created a dream
and through constant hope and effort
was able to guide its growth from a
skeleton foundation into a forty—two
floor university. We find this height
symbolical of the spirit of Pitt and of
the dream of Chancellor lohn G. Bow-
man who watched each girder reach-
ing higher into the sky. . . .

Here, we have found our theme,
"Looking Upward". Each administra-
tor is helping that spirit in his own
special way. Let us show you how by
telling you what they have been doing
and what they are looking forward to
in post—war years.

Our friendly vice—chancellor, Rufus
Fitzgerald, Chairman of the Commis-
sion on Arts of the Association of Am-
erican Colleges, has helped Pitt adjust
itself to its many War Training Pro-
grams. In one program more than
7,000 men in uniform received part of
their training at our University. Now,

center, Pitt administers tests to all
qualifying veterans of V\/estern Penn—
sylvania sending them to schools best
suited to their needs. Mr. Fitzgerald
is helping Pitt get ready to educate
veterans coming to the University
under the G. l. Bill of Rights and the
Disability Bill, and with the new semes-
ter he will assume the honored duties
of Chancellor of Pitt. . . . Dr. lohn
Weber, Secretary of the University, is
"looking forward" to the future with a
smile—a big hopeful smile, for Dr.
'V\/eber predicts a bright Pitt future in
increased student enrollment, re--
fresher courses, expansion in graduate
research work and the proposed stu-
dent dormitories. . . . Our ever busy
Registrar, I. G. Quick, told us, "If last
year's student enrollment trend con-
tinues, the Registrar's staff will be
obliged in 1945 to "look upward" to
see the tops of the mounting stacks of
registration cards. The real "look up-
ward" however, will be our happy
privilege to serve the increasing num-
ber of returned veterans who will be
prparing for the future through courses
at Pitt." Dr. Quick has done much to
establish and maintain the friendly
relationships that exist between our
University and Pittsburgh's secondary
schools. . . . And these relations bring

ORGANIZATIONS

Yes, We th.e organizations of the Uni-
versity have become a fixed part of
college life, and no_ matter if we be
large or small, a War—child or part of
the tradition, we look to the Student
Congress, to the Women's Self Gov-
ernment Association, and to Men's
Council for our government. The most
representative of us is the Student
Congress. and we owe our birth to the
war. Because of the emergency, the

not workable; it was replaced by the
Emergency Student Government Com-
mittee. In the spring of l944, E.S.G.C.
decided that a permanent system of
government must be created, and
the group turned to the comparatively
young University Senate, administra-
tive and faculty governing body, for
inspiration. The Student Congress,
so enthusiastically accepted by the
student body in the spring elections,
had a commission and a challenge

sponsorship of the United War Fund

convinced that life goes on beyond
emergencies, that we must safeguard
tomorrow by today's Wisdom, we have
formed a committee to determine the
legality of new student organizations.
We want every Pitt organization to
fulfill a definite and specific need; We
think that we owe you that———you who
have commissioned us to keep and
mold Pitt for you. Our purpose is: to

dent opinion sympathetic with the
University ideal, to provide a medium
for the expression of that student
opinion, to foster loyalty to the Uni-
versity, and to enrich the opportunities
for fellowship between students and
members of the faculty and adminis-
tration.

But we, the Student Congress, can't
do it all. There are many problems
peculiarly men's or women's, and so
we turn to Women's Self Government
Association and Men's Council for
help. Perhaps the busiest women
about campus~—busy because they are
in a multi—number of organizations—
are the members of W.S.G.A. What do
you pick up each time you want to rec-
ord a luncheon date, to check a Univer-
sity activity or holiday, to find informa
tion about one of us? Your Vade Me-
cum, of course, and Vade Mecum is a
publication of the W.S.G.A. We, the
governing body of Pitt women,_ felt that
we were the hostesses to the army dur-
ing the last four years; we tried to keep
faith with all who had worked before
us to create an atmosphere of friend-
liness and security for the men away
from their homes. We sponsored
dances, informal get—togethers, teas
about the fireplace; we tried to be
companionable, helpful and imper-
sonal; some of us fell in love, but
mostly we waited for our Pitt men to
return, prayed some other woman's
association was taking care of our

men, and dug in twice as hard to make
our Pitt front a happy front.

Air Corps, A.S.T.'s, Navy—and yet,
we had to keep our heads and nourish
the old time traditions, the things that
every Pitt man or woman remembers
when he dreams of Pitt. We had to
take care of our freshman women, to
try to make up to them for coming to
the University when we had our hair
d.own and were hard at work. Fresh-
man Customs exams, green armbands,
Lantern Night, inter—class sing——event
after event must go on as usual, for if
they didn't we would be breaking a
trust. A Senior Queen must be crown-
ed, an Owl Hall of Fame must be
chosen, elections must be held. The
University must not let the seriousness
of today's problems make her forget to
look ahead to the permanence of what
we, for want of a better term, call
tradition.

W.S.G.A. is pragmatic, alive. We
are alive mostly because we remem—
ber yesterday, take care of today and
prepare for tomorrow.

We, Men's Council, were hardest
hit during the war years, for the group
we represent diminished to a vague
suggestion of its former size. And yet,
we are looking forward to a full mem-
bership, to proportional representation
from all schools to Men's Council. We
intend to be a solid part of the Student
Congress, to be the final authority in
the administration of men in their ac-

tivities. We have only
tenselected men now
but we are keeping
this part of the Uni-
versity alive for our
brothers who were
forced to go away for
awhile. Gradually, as
the years since 1941
disappear with the
appearance of new
Varga calendars, we are bringing
back the old way of life for Pitt men.
We revived the golden Panther keys
as rewards to students for the achieve-
ment of a high quality point average
and for the enthusiastic participation
in University activities. We hold our-
selves open as a body of redress for
any grievance a man may have; we
show men transfers what we mean
by living at Pitt. We want to be sym-
bolic of a group who can face an
emergency, conquer it and go ahead.
‘With your help, we'll work with
W.S.G.A. to guard student life at the
University for those who are coming
back to us, for those who will be with
us tomorrow, for those who have built
all these years that we might have a
firm foundation.

 

Bob Dixon

 

What's Buzzin'. Cousin?

We, the engineers, want you to
meet some of our top men from "up on
the hill" in the Engineering and Mines
Cabinet. We gave our lounge at State
Hall to the soldiers; we cut fewer
classes; we watched the mail for that
official government envelope calling
us from Pitt. None of you could have
been more conscious of the war than
we have been, but we are a stubborn
group. We insist that each semester
see an Engineers’ dance, that our
smokers are kept. We know that
human relationships are important;
we know there will be an after-the—war
as well as during-the-war, and we
realize that along with mastery of the
slide-rule, we must be ready for the
sunrise.

You seldom remem-
ber us; we are the
evening students who
are so much a part of
the University, and
we have formed the
Evening Students’ As-
‘ sociation. This year
we have shown a
greater interest in ac-
tivities and the social
side of a University
education. Many of us are doing war
work, some of us are teaching, some of
us keep house or take shorthand dur-
ing the day. But here in evening school
we edit a paper, have a monthly social
meeting, and even bowl with team-
mates after class. We are working for
a greater spirit of friendliness and
cooperation among the evening stu—
dents.

During the war years no group on
campus has better held the line of
normal performance than the Owl--
no group unless you turn to the Pitt

get one each week. Women turn in

beats, but no one complains about the
feminine angle, for there's no notice-
able difference. We've aimed to put
out the best newspaper possible; we
haven't let the war interfere, but we
have ever been conscious of the war.

our freshman into their first social con-
tact with Pitt where they meet the
Dean of Women and the Dean of Men.
Freshmen find first that Pitt women are
a tradition. They are young ladies
who are complimented on the grace
with which they meet strangers, their
poise when they serve tea from the
impressive samovars, and their ability
to organize and to work together. It
is the helpfulness of our Dean of
Women's Office that earns them this
reputation. All who have come to
know them appreciate Miss Ruth
Becker and Mrs. Lucy Millard, the two
secretaries, for their cheery greetings;
Miss Adrienne Hill's help with housing
and employment problems; Miss Har-
riet Glasser's aid with outside activi-
ties; Miss Elizabeth Teal's training of
the Nationality Room hostesses; Miss
Alison Stewart's management of the
Heinz Chapel; Mrs. lune McDowell's
assistance in the Information Room.

In the room across the hall, Miss
Helen Pool Rush, Dean of Women,
lends a spirit of grace and dignity to
the hurry—scurry of our city university.
Her dreams for new dormitories, with
a special wing for commuters to spend
a night and the re-opening of the
twelfth floor are her pet issues for
Pitt's future. The whole department is
"looking upward" because, in reality,
they have just begun. . . . But they're
not the only ones. In addition to the
continuation of the work assigned to
the Dean of Men's Office, the boys in
there have grinned and tackled even
more. Pitt has kept in closer touch with
the service men and women than any
other school in the country, and the
credit can easily be attributed to the
fact that every eight weeks Dean Bid-
dle's staff plays post office, mailing
seven thousand news—letters to Pittites
in the armed forces. Pitt men enjoy
their informal meetings with Dean
Theodore W. Biddle, former Hall of
Fame man, and his ability to put them
at immediate ease has won him their
confidence. As Director of Personnel

Services for Veterans, Dean Biddle
helps returning service men to become
happy members of our University
family. Assistants to Dean Biddle are
Robert L. Arthur, as special advisor
to veterans and counselor to student
activities, and Raymond P. Brittain, as
special advisor to fraternities. Mr.
Arthur finds in the re—establishment of
the band and orchestra an indication

f the spirit of peace time Pitt, and Mr.
Brittain sees great hope for mature
leadership through participation in
fraternity life. William Daufenbach,
on duty in the information room, is the
Dean's assistant who trains the mar-
shals of the Cathedral, and he, too,
has victory year training in mind. The
secretaries of the office, Mrs. Alice Dor-
field, Miss Lois Rowbottom, and Miss
Betty Maloney are always prepared
with a pleasant "Hello" and immedi-
ate problem aid. Here is another office
that is "looking upward" today for
their students of tomorrow.

But, there are many others on whom
we depend. The chief of these are the
deans of our schools, for to them be-
longs the responsibility of directing
our educational program and growth.
If there is any development in Pitt's
search for unattained heights, it must
come from these men and women.

Although the Pitt

look to the paper for our help. Both
the Pitt News and the Pitt Evening
News follow the slogan in giving to
us "all the news that is fit to print."
The other organizations take full
advantage of the publications at Pitt,
and we often read about the activities
of the Heinz Chapel Choir in "On
Campus." Our choir people love to
sing and the group is browbeaten by
this love and by discipline into a mag-
nificent whole by one of the country's
leading directors, l\/fr.
Theodore M. Finney.
The choir practices
an hour at a time four
days a week under
Mr. Finney's direc-
tion, and although he
refuses to accept ex-
cuses, won't tolerate
"cuts", and doesn't
believe in emergen-

show their love for him with a familiar
"Pop" for a nickname. In the time be-

a halt to that. The tour was fun-grand
fun, and we were proud to be received
as representatives of Pitt in many of the
leading cities of the country. But now
we sing for Pittsburgh, and believe it
or not, we are just as happy, just as
proud, for it's family stuff now. We
sing every Friday at the University
Chapel service; on Sunday afternoon
we sing at Vespers. For a few minutes
our music shuts out the ugliness and
sadness, the humdrumness of life. We

made a record of gay

Merely doing as has
always been done is
not enough; we look-

we produced an

dually know little about music, and we
use Women's Choral as a place to
learn. We Want to take an active part
in the rendering as Well as in the ap-
preciation of the finest in music. This
we offer as our share in building a bet-

were among the first to sell war bonds
on campus. We of the Y's pledge our-
selves to the task of striving toward
the best Christian ideals.

While we are ever interested in the
unification of all denominations, we
must acknowledge that each of us
worship God in his own way and
under a specific form often given a
specific name. The Lutheran students
desired to cooperate, to have fellow-
ship one with another, and thus be-
came the Lutheran Students’ Associa-
tion. We hold monthly meetings—
dinner is served, of course. Sometimes,
we just meet for fun; other times we
become forums and discussion groups.
We, the Lutheran students, are look-
ing up and ahead to
a world of peace that
will make our organ-
ization symbolic of
our slogan—"Faith—
Food—and Fun."

Each of us, each or-
ganization, became a

us because there was a serious task to

be performed. We have a slogan—'

"Lest we forget, the end is not yet," and
this we remember each time we launch
a campaign to sell bonds and stamps
in coordination with the National war
loan drives. Unlike our brothers, we
don't want to exist any longer than we
feel it expedient, and this might be our
goal. We want to help each of you con-
tribute to the support
of the war; we want
to do all we can as
long as we are need-
ed; we must pray that
our need may not be .
for long.

times a year, and invite the boys and
girls who were of us once to be of us
again. We'll have a big exclusive so-
cial event each year, and we'll get to-
gether then and talk about the time
when "we were expendable."

We govern, We sing, we Worship
God; sometimes we are serious, some--
times we are gay. We, the organiza-
tions, like to think that each of us con—
tributes something to your education
and something to your fun. Take
Women's Speech. for instance. There
was a time when ninety—nine people
out of a hundred who graduated from
a University were afraid of an audi-
ence. We don't Want that to happen
to Pitt women, and so, during the War
years, we have had an opportunity
to let our women show What they
could do. All debate and conference
questions concern problems of cur-
rent interest Which can be found in
domestic or international news——and
our girls can talk intelligently about
each of these problems. We think We
are doing a big job, for we are pre-
paring each of us to take an active
part in the discussion of the world

which is to come. We look to the At»
lantic Charter and beyond the Atlantic
Charter to a world in which there is
freedom of speech. We want to be
worthy of this basic freedom.

Some of us use Women's Speech
Association as a training ground for
the work to be done in Pitt Players.
There is no doubt that the Players have
confronted problems aplenty because
of the war. We, the Women, dug in
and helped keep this organization an
integral part of the University. We
lost many students; we stopped trying

"After the war—" is the keynote of
our faculty, a keynote tangible and
alive to them, something to shape and
build now for the Pitt that is to follow.
. . . Texas-reared Vincent Lanfear,
Dean of the School of Business Admin--
istration, is "looking upward" with
plans for an advisory committee of
businessmen who will cooperate with
the school's faculty by keeping them
in touch with the changing problems
and events of the post-war business
world. . . . A member of the National
Education Board, Dean S. P. Franklin
of the School of Education can see the
national, over—all changes in the edu-
cational field. Therefore, the School,
under Dean Franklin, is looking for-
ward to educational testing labs and
workshops that will bring more real-
istic training to students of teaching.

. From indications, studies made
among the armed services prove that
large numbers of returning veterans
will be interested in engineering
courses and Dean Elmer Holbrook of
the Engineering <3 Mines School is
keeping posted on new trends in na-
tional engineering education to pre-
pare E. <3 M. for the expected increased
enrollment. . . The College, under
Dean Stanton Crawford, has carried
on a large teaching program in both
the liberal arts and the sciences. Both
have been heavily burdened during

the war, but Dean Crawford is busy
planning new programs that will be
timely to serve the special interests of
the veterans and civilians. . . The
Research Bureau for Retail Training is
visualizing a future in which young
men and women returning from the
armed services will be vocational-
minded and will look with interest
toward a program that offers special-
ized training for the retail field. Direc-
tor Bishop Brown and the Bureau staff
are glad to be back on the regular two-
semester year, because the Bureau
course is a concentrated one for a
normal year at best and reached posi-
tively hectic proportions under war-
time acceleration. . . . The Law School,
with Iudson A. Crane as Dean, is ex-
pecting a greatly increased enroll-
ment after the war is over and is join-
ing with other law schools and bar
associations in planning refresher and
retainer courses for the lawyers of
Western Pennsylvania who will return
from the Service. . . Increasing de-
mands for trained social workers have
been the main war problems for Dean
W. I. Newstetter of the School of Ap-
plied Social Sciences. However, the

are good, though, and We offer no
apology to you who are here and to
you who have gone. Acting has al-
ways been a part of every student's
life — either real or vicarious — and
Pearl Harbor could not obliterate this
from Pitt. Actively, We recognized the
war by turning ourselves into a co-
operative body with the Key Informa-
tion Center collecting materials for
soldiers, and we gave several shows
for soldiers’ entertainment. Pitt Play-
ers are looking forward to the end—-
the end we all want — for that end
means we'll be better able to serve
Pitt. When war comes to an end, We
will feel that We have gained as an
organization because we have given
our all for the war effort, doing rela-
tively much with nothing.

Acting not only demands profici-
ency in speech but in body movement
as well. We are the Women's Athletic
Association. and we offer you physical
fun together with our companionship

the end just that much closer.

Not all our business was war. For in-

that we have built on the old founda-

HONORARY AND PROFESSIONAL
FRATERNITIES

You are the Honorary and the Profes-
sional fraternities at the University of
Pittsburgh. You are the people who
are bound together by mutual likes,
vocations, and proficiencies. ln each
of you are the individuals who are par
ticularly interested and gifted in a
special field. During your life at Pitt,
you set up certain ideals, and at-
tempted to make the University be
more than the tallest university in the
world. At times, you wanted to create
interest in your field; you wanted to

 

Today Pitt——Tomoi-row. the World

add to the knowledge
and to the fellowship. At
other times you wanted
an organized group of
people who thought as
you did, who dreamed
as you dreamed—a
group of people who
might enjoy each other.
Always your goal was to enrich Pitt by
enriching the contacts and the exper-
ience of the individual. One thing you
pride yourselves upon is that you al-
ways left yourselves pliable to the
changing times. True, tradition is im-
portant and tradition plays a great
part in your lives, but you never let
yourselves be bound by it. Function-
alism is the only excuse, the only rea-
son by which you can justify your
existence. Years of recognizing the
importance of changing time gave you
a weapon with which to encounter De-
cember 7, l94l. You can't boast that
you were any more ready than the rest
of the nation to bear the emergency
thrust upon us, but you do feel that you

had workable organ-
izations With which to
help the War effort
and with which to
help maintain a reign
of normalcy at home.
The achievements,
and the work which
you stand for were
more needed when
the nation set to work. There was much
danger that you could forget the rea-
sons our soldiers were fighting in their
effort to fight, that you would get emo-
tionally confused about the placing of
values, about peoples and motives.
You, the Honorary and Professional
Fraternities put a premium on scholar-
ship, leadership, honor, charity. Your
task has been, and is to keep these vir-
tues ever before you, before you in
such a manner that you may never
forget them.

began four years before the war; since
then, your existence has been half-
war and half—peace. You were import-
ant before the war ~— stimulating the
men to scholarship, activity, coopera-
tion, but you became more than vital
just four years ago when everything
was emphasizedyas important to the
national existence. That is, every~
thing but scholarship. There was a
tendency for the faculty and students
to forget school. Even some professors
said, "My students are Working in war
industries. l should lighten their load.
I must not be too insistent about the
quality of their work; after all, they're
contributing to the War effort." This
well—meant attitude was dangerous to
the future of all of us, and Phi Eta

Sigma set out to keep :52
alive scholarship at 
a time when the ten- 
dency was to de—em-- if V
phasize it. This was .
no easy task, for your 1}:
fraternity was for
freshman men who
were fast becoming
more scarce as the war years went
on. You have an initiation banquet
each mid—November for those of you
who become brothers each Tap Day.
You mostly just recognize those of the
freshman class who you feel deserve
thanks and recognition for the job
they have done. You want to ever ex-
tend the stimulus for freshmen men to
true scholarship and leadership, for it
is more than likely that the members
of Phi Eta Sigma will be the future
leaders of the University and of their
chosen professions.

No less important is the scholarship
and leadership which must be de—
veloped in our freshman women. If
the freshman women have maintained

year, if they are actively cooperative
on campus, you shall probably ask
them to become members of Pitt's
Alpha chapter of Cwens. the national
honorary fraternity for sophomore
women. Cwens serve Pitt actively, and
Pitt is proud of them. Everyone knows
the Cwen student directory—the one
we use to check an address or a tele-
phone number of a fellow student.
Well, in spite of all the printing handi-
caps brought on by the war, the Cwens
publish it each year. Cwens act as
nationality room guides and as hostes-
ses at a senior tea, and you, too, are
known as campus leaders in scholar-
ship and in activities.

Hand in hand with the Cwens are
the Druids. a sopho-
more honorary fra-
ternity for men. The
Druids, like the
Cwens, are part of
the University with
specific tasks and
functions. Even as the
enrollment of fresh-
men men decreased,

the Druid Smoker,

where the fellows signed up for Univer-
sity activities went on. Fewer and
fewer men were here to sing in Heinz
Chapel, to act with the Pitt Players, to
participate in YM and Newman Club
activities, but Druids realized that the
place of men in campus activities must
be preserved, and you, too, tried to
maintain a standard of normalcy in
this modern "tragic era." Dr. Ferguson
and Dr. Crouch joined you at the Royal
York for the Druid banquet. Ration
points and a scarcity of butter did not
spoil the fun of the group as you ate,
talked and planned for Pitt in the years
to come.

All These Men and Food, Too

Perhaps the greatest honor that can
come to a Pitt woman is to be asked
to be one of Mortar Board. Each of
the underclass honorary and scholas-
tic fraternities, each activity prepares
the women to become a member.
You, like the rest of us, exist to serve
the University; you usher at gradu-
ation, are hostesses at many occa-
sions. You hold offices in W.S.G.A.,
you edit Pitt News, you lead in Panhel
meets. You try to be helpful to each
freshman woman, and many of you
serve as advisors for the guilds. You
even take an orientation class over
now and then; and, of course, you
help at the Chancellor's Reception. In
spite of the weight brought on you by
Pearl Harbor, you smile and go on
keeping and building the University
into a challenging academic and so-
cial world.

True it is that Pitt looks to members
of Mortar Board for women leaders,
and Omicron Delta Kappa. national

 

activities fraternity, holds the same
place at Pitt for the men. When fresh-
men first come to Pitt, they are made
aware of Omicron Delta Kappa
through the O.D.K. walk . Freshman
women acknowledge their lowly state
by refraining from going up this
walk; everyone looks at the names
of the brothers who have gone before
us—names cut deep in the stone. ln
1944 O.D.K. almost had to catch its
breath, you skidded and nearly went
under because of the Emergency, but
with the help of the faculty, you fought
for your life and won. This year eight
brothers joined you. One of these men
who wear the O.D.K. key, William
Veenis, Loren Braner, Richard Briney,
Robert Dixon, lackson lce, Grant Lee,

might see his name cut in the walk.

the Owl as well as a
portion of each staff
belong to Xylon, and
each Tap Day others
join you. Many in
Xylon intend to leave
Pitt and do profes-
sional journalism—
some already have;
these people repre-
sent Pitt and do a

You meet every other week now, and
you mostly talk shop with the guid-
ance of a professional speaker. The
Ad Club invites you to their Tuesday
noon luncheons where you meet the
boys and girls actually in harness.
You have an initiation banquet and
several dinners throughout the year.
But, in the final analysis, you are the
talkingest bunch to be found, and you
spend much of your time at that. ln.
spite of the rush, the helterskelter of
all of you to meet deadlines, you meet
and try to find ways to publish better
newspapers and yearbooks. in spite
of the dreams of the future when there
will be no restrictions on paper, print,
film and staff workers, in spite of a
wistful sigh about the Pitt Panther, a
war casualty, we hope, and at least
you try to express the ideals of the

after all, your main job at the Uni-
versity is to learn, not only facts but
how to live. You professional fraterni-
ties try to combine the two; you try to
stimulate interest in the work of the
field as well as to provide a means of

pus, the extensive reach of the Nursing
School and the Cadet Nurse program
is recognized every time we stop to
admire the gray and red of their pass-
ing uniforms. Dean Ruth Kuehn is ac-
tively "looking upward" by serving
as a member of the Post War Planning
Committee for Nursing Education. . . .
"The School on the Boulevard" is a
part of Pitt too. Pharmacy School with
Dr. C. Leonard O'Connell as its Dean,
is proud of its four hundred and fifty
members serving the armed forces.
Many will return to a School prepared
to offer them vocational readjustment
in the form of review and advanced
courses. . . . Since fifteen members of
the teaching staff of the School of
Dentistry are in the Service, the faculty,
as well as the students, has been ex-
tremely busy. But with all their over-

load, Dean I-l. Edmund Friesell and his
faculty have not forgotten to plan for
the time when some nine hundred alu-
mni of the School will return to civilian
life and the practice of dentistry for

civilians. A complete program of grad-
uate study ranging from short "refresh-
er" courses to courses leading to grad-
uate degrees is ready to function when
V—Day comes. . . . Med School, and all
of Pitt, is very proud of the University's
General Hospital Number 24 in New
Guinea. It is staffed with forty—five of
the Medical School's faculty and one
hundred nurses from local teaching
hospital staffs. Dean "Bill "McEllroy
is as anxious as the hopeful M.D.'s to
return to normal semester schedules
and he is planning extensive graduate
courses and increased hospital resi-
dencies as Medical School's contribu.-
tion to a bigger and better’Pitt.

Our social life, our educational pro-
grams, and surely our class work all
contribute to a spirit of Pitt, a Piti which
could easily mean nothing more than
splendid architecture. But Pitt does
mean more than that and department
heads closest to us scholastically have
helped foster that spirit in us. Each
has post war plans we can outline
here. . . . Professor Theodore Finney,

closer association among the leaders
in that field.

This is certainly true of the medical
fraternities. For six years the Medical
Interfraternity Council has been tak-
ing care of its members here at Pitt.
The IF makes and enforces rushing
rules, the set of social events which
include three dances a year and a
picnic. And to encourage the fraterni—
ties, the Medical lnterfraternity Coun-
cil gives one of you a plaque to indi-
cate the highest scholastic average. _

The representatives of the Medical
lnterfraternity Council come from you
who are Phi Delta Epsilon, Nu Sigma
Nu and Phi Rho Sigma. Each of you

has a similar goal,
each of you wants
one thing of your
members—high>
scholastic attainment
and fine professional 4
ethics. You hold din— E
ners, and outstanding

men in the medical

profession are invited to speak and to
encourage you. Your gab sessions help
you to think, to solve problems which
bother you. Dances, dinners, informal
get-togethers take care of that "all
work, no play makes lack a dull boy."
Life suddenly became grim in a hurry
——yesterday there were long hours of
leisure, weekend trips, holiday vaca-
tions and the whole future to look to
when suddenly today you had to
hurry to finish your training that you
might each take your place helping
the men in battle. From each medical
fraternity went brothers into the med-
ical corps. Meeting after meeting,
more of you would show up in a new
suit—one you didn't have to buy your-
selves and one correctly called a uni-
form. Medicine couldn't be theory
anymore; you couldn't use fraternity
meetings to curse those who advo-

events, newspaper headlines not ap-
pearing on the sport page suddenly
became a part of your life, and you
had yet another goal to add to the list
found written or unwritten in every
medical fraternity.

Closely allied with medicine is
pharmacy and so it is with the pro-

fessional pharmacy fraternities. The‘

members of Lambda Kappa Sigma are
women and you are busy, but you
are not as busy as the men. You want
to feel that you worked for those who
are away and so you become nurses’
aides, you gave blood, and you rolled
bandages for the Red Cross. You

needed to keep up on '
everything new in
your profession; that
meant meetings with
the Duquesne chapter
for professional dis-
cussions. You gather-
ed information about
pharmacy and put it
into a magazine you
named the Blue and
Gold Triangle. You
thought the alums
would want you to keep this up, and
the magazine went to bed each quar-
ter as usual. You had your alumni
banquet, too, in spite of preparing to
take the men's places in the world and
keeping your work up to par. Phar-
macy, as well as medicine, could gath-
er her leaders together in fraternities
to help keep everyone's feet on the
ground at of time when it would be so
easy to walk ten feet above the
clouds.

What would either doctors or
pharmicists be without nurses? The
war is three years old; the pre-nursing
club, Idaka, is three years old. You
want everyone to pay particular at-
tention to your name—ldaka. It is an
Indian word meaning "to serve," and

you'll serve actively

or in peace, you OI

SOCIAL FRATERNITIES

Man is a gregarious creature. Boys
congregate into gangs; girls form
cliques. Men join everything from
poker clubs to staid organizations;
women go all out for bridge or have a
sewing circle. All of which goes to
prove the inherent reason for men and
women's social fraternities at the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh. Fraternities are
for the few; they enrich the individual
life of those who belong to them and
through the enrichment of the indi-
vidual, the University benefits as a
whole. At Pitt, the street—car University,
women's fraternities own and maintain
houses which are used to house board-
ers on campus; however, most of the
men live in their own fraternity houses.
During the war years, all fraternities
became another organized group to
aid in any way possible the University
and the nation at war. Hardships were
worked upon all—particularly upon
men's fraternities. Economically and
socially, life had to be adjusted to the
state of emergency which existed.
Formal affairs until 1944-45 were some-
thing to remember. House dances

were simpler, held less often, and the
girls appeared minus Corsages most of
the time. And yet, over and over again,
it was discovered that the people on
campus who did things were fraternity
people. A pin, Greek letters, spirit——
that something which is intangible
forces the individual to be more of -a
person because of his relationship to
the group. With no other pretension
than being an exclusive social group,
the fraternity at Pitt becomes an influ-
ence for good, a stimulation for ac-
tivity, a school for the development of

desire for dances to the gods, for pomp
and circumstance, ‘for dressing in
strange clothing and becoming part
of a secret ritual. Almost equally strong
is the adolescent need of inflicting
physical torment as proof of worthi-
ness, of "hell Weeks" and all night ses-
sions with a paddle. Both of these
fundamental needs are fulfilled by
fraternities, but more important are
the associations and national contacts
formed in fraternities.

government; that was
decided‘ in Philadel-
phia many years ago.
Women fraternities
are governed by the
Panhellenic Associa-
tion. In our fourth
year of war, Panhel—
lenic Association has
transferred its party
budgets to war bonds and its leisure
program to the selling of war stamps.
Under Panhel's guidance fraternity
women have volunteered their serv-
ices to the Red Cross, the Nurse's Aide
program, the blood bank, and to the
various U. S. O. Canteens. Also, Panhel
has sponsored and has attended many
forums and lectures on post—war prob-
lems.

Panhel members, Working With all
other fraternity women, are "looking
upward" by attempting to increase
the feeling of common interest and
mutual co-operation among the
various fraternities. They plan to
strengthen inter—fraternity relations by
scheduling a series of conferences
during which the fraternity girls will
be able to discuss their common prob-

lems and the solutions to them.

The way today's Panhel t,hinks—~
works—is best expressed in this year's
Who's Who in Fraternities. . "Fra-
ternity, especially in this time of war,
has come to have the deeper, richer,
and truer meaning of friendship and
service; friendship and service not
only within its own small circle, but
among all fellow students. . . . Fra~
ternity is a way to better womanhood
and citizenship in the free world of
tomorrow."

This year Panhel returned to the
traditional formal ball in April . . . the
Ball where the girls do the asking and
the ticket buying. And who are the
girls . . . well, we want you to meet
them, to know something about each
of them.

Let's have each one come to us
alone; each has a similar story to tell
with an individual twist. Each has a
quota of war bonds to sell, each en-
tertained and tea—danced with the
men's fraternities. Many members
trotted down to the blood banks, lay
on high cots and let efficient nurses
draw blood from their arms. Some of
them took care of refugee children,
worked in canteens, gave scholar-

ships. But the general
story is never as in-
teresting as the indi-
vidual.

Come in Alpha
Epsilon Phi. We hear
that you hold the rec— _
ord on campus for
selling the most War
Bonds during the past
three drives. You certainly come to the
fore when it comes to war work-how
about the ambulances—three of them
—you gave to the Red Cross? And your
femininity comes out in knitting—an

stance, that you celebrated D day by
soliciting blood for the blood banks.
And your idea of making Pitt more uni-
versal, of striving to foster a better
relationship between the independent
women and the fraternity women
proves what we've been saying about
traternity contributions to the Uni-
versity as a whole. We're glad you
took time out to have the traditional
Founder's Day Banquet with Tech,

though. You've got to forget the war
sometimes or you'll go mad.

Talking about Founder Day's, may-
be the Chi Omegas would like to be
presented here. You celebrated your
fiftieth birthday this April. As a mat-
ter of fact, this has been an important
year for you, for after you vacationed
in Atlantic City, you left the apart-
ment to move into your new house.
And there is something different about
that house, for with very few excep-
tions, only Chi O's will live there—»—
something no other fraternity can
boast about. We're proud of you, for
not only do you talk about the future,
but you wade right in and prepare
for it. Perhaps this is
why you were happy
enough to sing—sing
so well that you grab-
bed second place in

Alpha gained enough of an edge to
come in first. That's only one reason all
of us commend the T.P.A.'s, the all-
Catholic women's fraternity. With a
frankly spiritual outlook, these women
work for the boys by holding dances,
by writing letters, by sending pack-
ages overseas, and by going to Com-

proud of you because you want more
activities for all women—you want to

FACULTY HALL OF FAME

Going to college is the best way we
know of preparing for the future.
We've discovered that it's really learn-
ing through living———the vital, exciting
kind of learning that you absorb from
lectures that challenge, from knowing
those same lecturers as distinct per-
sonalities, as friendly, sincere people
whose wisdom is seasoned with a re-
assuring humanness and humor. Our
relationship with our professors ex-
tends beyond the classroom; we're all
working and relaxing together, part
of that great "Pitt family" that it's so
much fun to belong to. "We're here to
help you," our professors emphasize,
and we love their genuineness and
turn to them for encouragement. We
drop in to their offices for ten—minute
chats that somehow stretch into hours,
we swap jokes at teas and dinners,
we invite them to join our sports dis-
cussions over cokes in the Tuck Shops,
we pause in the halls for a friendly,
"Hello there, how was your vacation?"
This Faculty Hall of Fame is our way
of saying "Thanks a million" to these
men and women for wanting to know
us, for taking the time and energy to
be our friends, and for letting us know
them. And, above all, it's a thanks for
patiently guiding us to look upward
with the Cathedral arches, .to see be-
yond the immediate pressure of the
war and to fashion a clear-sighted
perspective for our future.

in the field of child psychology, red-
headed Dr. Teagarden is popular with
her students for her informal method of
conducting classes, clarifying complex
theories by a host of amusing anec-
dotes. Her lectures sparkle with a
warmly personal tone rising from her
genuine interest in the students; they
sense that she is talking with them,
not at them. Graduates find that her
memory is amazing; she never forgets
those who have been in her classes.
We consider it a privilege to be able to
include in this list Dr. Florence Teagar—
den, who prepares us for life by gener-
ously sharing with us her vast under-
standing of human nature.

MR. THEODORE FINNEY

"Pop" Finney's nickname speaks
for itself; his students keep up their
friendship with the twinkle-eyed pro-
fessor of music appreciation long after
graduation. Members of the Heinz
Chapel Choir can tell you that he's
one of those rarities, a real artist with
deep sensitivity and an even temper.
The richness of their singing is a
tribute to his skill as a conductor and
a proof of their responsiveness to his
personality. Pop's well—developed
sense of humor ranges all the way

from sparkling repartee, at which he
can't be beaten, to dry wit that flashes
forth sharply in quotable bits like his

extensive as his campus duties; he
finds relaxation in remodeling furni—
ture in his completely—equipped wood-

Nip and Tuck, and working on his

DR. JAMES D. HEARD

When white-haired Dr. Iames Heard
enters a lecture hall, the future doc~
tors of our hill campus rise to show
their respect for the "grand old man
of medicine" who studied under Sir
William Osler. He wisely realizes the
Value of knowledge made pleasant,
and students long remember his vivid
lectures. His dignity is tempered by a
Vein of wit and a flair for acting; the
med students look forward to his
classes, where they find fun in learn-
ing. The tedious technicalities of
medical tomes take on life and mean-
ing under Dr. Heard's skilled presenta-
tion. He dramatizes symptoms, mimics
characteristic gaits; now his Voice is
quiet and even, now it booms through
the hall for emphasis. Despite the de-
mands of his practice, Dr. Heard still
manages to find time to encourage his
students. Memorable as a man, a
scientist, and as a teacher, Dr. lames
Heard undisputably belongs in this
Faculty Hall of Fame.

Simplicity in line, function in form, greater economy in operation, higher
efficiency in performance, all forecast for almost everything in the post-war
period, are in the Master Unit and Motor Chair today.

only by seeing and operating it can you comprehend fully the prestige and

earnest Miss Emily I-lolmguist, who
enjoys working with the girls. A recent
Pitt graduate, she appreciates the stu-
dents’ viewpoint and firmly believes
in their right to voice opinions demo-
cratically. At the same time, she
agrees that they should learn to use
their freedom wisely. The present
shortage of nurses has increased the
responsibilities of the faculty; they are
now geared to intense wartime ac-
celeration, which leaves them very
little spare time. Miss Holmguist
spends her infrequent free moments
in relaxing with music or the theater.
Selflessly devoted to a vital cause, she
guides Pitt students to look beyond
themselves, to expand their horizons
and aimskyward.

DR. FRANK MCGINNIS

'Way over in Pharmacy School, stu-
dents all like the free—and—easy spirit
of camaraderie in Dr. Frank McGrinnis'
classes. Most pharmaceutical lectures
have all the glamor of a stack of pre-
scriptions; Dr. l\/lcGinnis spikes the
factual part of his material with a
smooth flow of jokes to keep his stu—
dents chuckling as they jot down
pages of complicated formulae. He
has an extensive knowledge of his
subject and the enviable knack of
turning out scores of students with a
thorough grounding in pharmacy.
Easy to talk to, he's fond of chatting
with his pupils during class intermis-
sions, while they in turn enjoy the
chance to know their professor as a
man. We're pleased to add Dr. Frank
McGinnis as Pharmacy School's repre-
sentative to our Pitt Faculty Hall of
Fame; he merits recognition as one
who is secure enough in his innate
dignity to command respect even
when he puts himself on an informal
basis with his students.

DUO USE BATH

The ‘§$tandatvcI" Duo-Use Bathroom plan points the way to
more useful—more practical and more attractive bathrooms in
the future. It gives the bathroom a wider horizon—mal<ing
possible a bath and powder room in one. The door between
the compartments provides privacy for each.

Both compartments can be in use at the same time. If there
is an entrance from the hall, the doors to one bedroom and the
bath section can be closed, making it a powder room.

Space permitting, the walls can be utilized for toilet and
dress accessories cabinets. More Versatile decorative schemes
are also possible.

EDWIN PETERSON

Ruddy—cheeked and tweedy, "Pete"
injects life into his English classes by
his tongue-in-cheek flickers of humor.
We'd recognize that fine, clear voice
anywhere, whether it's rolling through
the slow-cadenced lines of his favorite
Christina Rossetti or crackling through
the Commons Room microphone at
the traditional Christmas party. That's
the time, incidentally, when, whis-
kered and padded, Pete becomes our
own Pitt Santa Claus. In his spare
time Mr. Peterson tries his hand at
practicing the same writing principles
that he teaches to his students; his
short stories have been published in
national magazines, while his full-
length, idyllic No Life So Happy glows
about the delights of fishing. We place
him in an especially favored nook be-
cause we admire his complete honesty
and his enthusiasm for life that brims
over to lend meaning to his lectures
and warmth to his dealings with stu-
dents.

MISS RUTH SMALLEY

Up in the School of Applied Social
Sciences, students marvel at the im-
pact of Miss Smalley's lectures. Quiet-
spoken and crisply efficient, she con-
ducts the kind of class in which every-
one sits and listens actively. struck by
the depth of her understanding of how
people get that way. A word-eco-
nomist, Miss Smalley gets to the heart
of her material and compresses a
wealth of knowledge into a single ses-
sion. Outside of class students find
that her intelligence is combined with
a likable genuineness and sense of
humor. She's absorbed in her work,
but not to the point of being one-sided;
her outside interests indulge a sensi-
tivity to beauty and include an ap-
preciation for Edna St. Vincent Millay
and Van Gogh. Because she's stripped

of superficiality and geared to the
pace of our times, and because of her
ability to provoke thought, we add
Miss Smalley to our gallery of out-
standing professors.

DR. D. D. LESSENBERRY

When students actually persist in
arriving eagerly at eight—thirty for a
first—hour class, you know that they
really enjoy it. And no Wonder—rain,
snow, or smog, Dr. Lessenberry cheer-
fully greets everyone with a few bars
of "Oh, what a beautiful morning!"
This impeccably—groomed professor of
commercial education takes a per-
sonal interest in each student, declar-
ing, "1 always try to make the students
realize that they are worth knowing.
They can learn, and I feel that it is my
responsibility if they don't." That they
do learn, and learn well, is shown by
the membership list of Delta Delta
Lambda, the honorary commercial ed
fraternity which draws its name from
Dr. Lessenberry's initials. Spring al-
ways brings that "back to the land"
gleam to his eye; he's justly proud of
the prize roses that he cultivates on
his siXty—acre farm in Fox Chapel. In
this man we recognize the qualities of
a well—rounded person that we're striv-
ing to achieve in our upward climb.

DR. JOHN M. FERGUSON

The catalogue lists him as john l\/fC[X~
well Ferguson, Ph.D., ]ur.D., but to the
entire student body this wiry, ani—
mated professor of economics is just
plain "Fergie". When exciting news
breaks into the front page, we can
count on Fergie to parade through
the Tuck Shops, holding the headlines
high for all to read. No school event
is complete unless we see Fergie,
cigarette holder in hand, nodding
to his many friends and beaming at
everyone in general. I-Ie's popular at
fraternity house dances for his skill at

Great Names in Glassware

GLASBAKE BANGETEC

Since 1853 McKee Glass Company has produced glassware
for the American home, in addition to many industrial and

specialty products.

During the war a large part of our production of cooking
ware went to the armed forces and in addition we were privileged
to turn out bottles for the culture of life—saving Penicillin and

other items for the services.

For years the names Glasbake and Rangetec have signiﬁed
to the home maker heat resisting glass cooking ware of the highest
quality. Glasbake denotes our ovenware, Rangetec our top-of~
stove ware. Surveys have shown that housewives prefer McKee
cooking utensils because they are easy to clean, permit her to

watch the food while it is cooking and because she can serve from
the glass utensil at the table.

coaxing rhythm out of the most un-
musical of pianos, and this year the
freshmen unveiled him as the title
figure to climax their Sultan Swing.
Fergie remembers his former students,
too, and mails copies of the Pitt News
to manyof them who are now in the
armed services. We point with pride
to this professor because he hasn't
been submerged by the routines of
academic life but has managed to re-
main a memorable, colorful person-
ality.

DR. WILLIAM F. SWANSON

Dental students unanimously agree
that Dr. Swanson is an all—'round good
fellow. Professor of bacteriology and
histology, he is absorbed in his work
and is always willing to explain his
fine collection of slides to interested
visitors. I-le trains his students well for
the exacting precision of their profes«
sion; the boys complain good—na—
turedly about his inspection of their
slides, when "We had to grind those
teeth down so fine that a breeze would
bend them back and forth!" Between
periods the dents like to gather around
and hear about Dr. Swanson's latest
hunting or fishing trip. Aviation en-
thusiasts compare notes with him, too,
for he is also an expert navigator. As
a scientist with a talent for knowing
how and when to relax, Dr. William
Swanson deserves recognition in our
Faculty Hall of Fame.

DR. IOHN I. GEISE

Today he's saluted by the Historical
Research Department of the U. S.
Army, but we University of Pittsburgh
students still think of him as the tall,
deep—voiced professor who helped us
to discover that there's more to history
than reciting dates. In his survey
course of world history, Dr. Geise
made even the remoteness of the
Paleolithic age seem real and exciting.

The forging equipment and

He's a recognized scholar, too, and
many schools use his textbook, Man
and the Western World. Visits to
his office were always a treat; they
usually started with puzzling over the
intricacies of a timeline and drifted
from there into an hour or two of lively
conversation about anything from
football to the part that airplanes will
play in the future. We look up to Dr.
Geise because his height is mental as
well as physical and because he is a
far-sighted historian who is actively
helping to shape our future.

MR. PHILIP E. RUSH

As an electrical engineer who man-
ages to see farther than his sliderule,
jovial, round—faced Mr. Bush has cap-
tured the imagination of his students.
His quips brighten the long hours of
detailed lab work, and after class he
joins the fellows in lively discussions
of his many interests. If it's sports they
like, he can add his bit as a baseball
and football fan; stamp-collectors talk
over rare issues with him; and the
technical terms fly thick and fast when
short—wave radio enthusiasts consult
him about constructing sets. Eager to
help his students, this easy-going pro-
fessor advises several Engineering
School organizations.

MRS. AGNES LYNCH STARRETT

Blue-eyed Mrs. Starrett with her halo
of braids can scoff at those who cry
that marriage and a career can't mix;
she combines her two full-time jobs,
as editor of the University Press and
as mother of two lively children, with
efficiency, patience, and good humor.
We students have known her as a dis-
cerning critic in English classes, as a
co-operative, ever-ready advisor to
The Owl. and as a down-to—earth, sin-
cere friend. A loyal Pittite since her
undergraduate days, Mrs. Starrett
bakes cookies for the Chancellor every
year on his birthday. With as deft a
touch as she displays in the kitchen,
she puts out the Pitt Quarterly and has

published a complete history of the
University. As one more of our faculty
who has a sense of balance and who
lives her ideals, Mrs. Agnes Lynch
Starrett leads the University of Pitts-
burgh on its road upward.

DR. ALEXANDER SILVERMAN

Dr. Silverman, who heads our chem-
istry department, everyone likes im-
mediately for his charming air and his
quiet, ingenuous humor. Completely
unaffected, he puts students at their
ease by the sincerity of his interest in
them and his eagerness to be of help.
For instance, there's the well—known
box of coughdrops that he keeps on
his desk all winter for those who have
colds. As a teacher he's thorough,
patient, and stimulating; students are
proud to be able to study under the
guidance of the internationally re-
spected authority on glass. lncreas-
ing outside recognition has accom-
panied Dr. Silverman's rise on our
campus; his list of honors and honor-
ary societies is almost overwhelming.
His own glass collection is one of the
most outstanding in the world. Fore-
most in his field, loved for his gentle
friendliness, Dr. Alexander Silverman
is our idea of a truly remarkable
leader.

MR. ROBERT D. AYARS

Bus ad students prize their associa-
tion with the energetic and enthusias-
tic chairman of the accounting depart-
ment, Mr. Ayars. They admire his
brilliance, are grateful for his clear—
cut, well-organized presentation of a
difficult subject, and have complete
confidence in the fairness of his de-
cisions in grading their papers. Both
in and out of the classroom he displays
a likable twinkle of humor; his jokes
help to relieve the tension of exam
days. Unraveling the intricacies of big
business math still leaves Mr. Ayars
some leisure time to perfect his tech.-
nique as an amateur magician and to
work at cabinet-making. Sometimes he
prefers to rough it for awhile by retiring

to his cabin in the woods near Emlen-
ton. Popular for his versatility, friend-
liness, and helpfulness, Mr. Robert
Ayars is representative of what is fin-
est in our faculty.

DR. EDNA T. BATZ

Amid all the activity and confusion
of her twelfth floor office, Mrs. Edna
Batz, our YWCA Secretary, remains
unruffled and good—natured. Her repu-
tation as a willing and sympathetic
listener has spread, and she welcomes
with a smiling, "Of course I have time
to see you," the many students who
drop in to chat with her and to ask for
advice. From her world travels she
learned the art of Oriental ﬂower ar-
ranging; she often brightens the cor-
ners of her office with delicately bal-
anced spikes of her home-grown irises
and daffodils. We'll remember Mrs.
Batz for the quiet way in which she fos-
ters spiritual beauty on the Pitt campus
by her cheerful encouragement, her
understanding, and her calm, behind-
the-scenes efficiency.

MR. WALTER SOBOTKA

Typically Continental, Mr. Sobotka
continuously delights his students in
Retail Training School with his soft
Viennese inflections and his precise,
glinting humor. His classes in textiles
are staccato, emphasized by flicks of
his monocle and the expressiveness
of his hands. Widely—read, he has a
range of information that verges on
the encyclopedic. Decisively he scorns
superficiality and deplores studying
that only skims the surface. Mr. So-
botka is consistent in his beliefs; a
well—known architect and interior dec-
orator, he was a pioneer in designing
modern furniture. Highly intelligent
and individualistic, Mr. Walter So-
botka is a colorful part of our Pitt scene,
a fervid exponent of good taste in art
and architecture.

THE GENERAL ALUMNI
ASSOCIATION

The General Alumni Association is
the link between today and tomorrow
at our university. Today we are stu-
dents on the campus; tomorrow we
are graduates looking back to our
Alma Mater.

Our love and loyalty to Pitt remain.
We have joined the Alumni family.
We are still one of that great family
of Pitt students which began in 1787
and continues today. But it would be
easy to forget, and easy to be forgot-
ten, were there not our organization

 

Homecoming Luncheon

to keep interest alive and constantly
remind us of our friends of yesterday;
to make us proud of the noted mem-
bers of our family when society
chooses to honor them; to keep us in-
formed of the progress of our Alma
Mater and of the events that are hap-
pening today.

To the General Alumni Association
we pay our dues and become active
members. lf we live far distant, the
Alumni Review. publication of this
Association, keeps us informed of what
is going on among Alumni and at the
University. lf we live in the vicinity
of a Pitt Club, that Club keeps us alive
to our duties to the Pitt family. lf we
are fortunate enough to be near the
University, we may actually take part
in University activities and in the
special Alumni activities.

What has the Alumni Association
been doing during these war years?
First of all, because of the tremendous
demands on the individual, our pro-
gram has been curtailed to suit the

times.
To communicate with all would be

impossible, but special efforts have
been made to send the Review to all
army camps at home, and where it is
possible to individuals abroad. The
appreciative letters we have received
from many prove that our efforts have
not been in vain.‘

This year a Homecoming Luncheon
was arranged at Hotel Schenley, pre-
ceding the Pitt-Notre Dame game.

Perhaps the most talked-of event is
the Annual Children's Christmas party
held for the children of faculty, and

alumni, especially for children of those
in the service. The afternoon of De-
cember 16, an expectant crowd of
little children and adults alike was
soothed by the Children's Chorus of
the Greenfield School, fascinated by
the art of a magician, charmed by a
jovial Santa, who gave each child a
book with his own name printed on
a bookplate with a sketch of the Com-
mons Room.

Another affair which has become
an annual custom is the delightful
Dinner—Bridge held at the College
Club. Here busy, tired business men
and women enjoy a friendly evening,
renewing friendships with those whom
they may seldom see, and meeting
newcomers to the family group; thus
it is that past and present meet.

The year would not be complete
without an anniversary. Charter Day
comes in February. Then alumni re-

turn to the campus to spend an hour

in worship at the beautiful Heinz
Chapel, and hear the University chap-
lain.

Much we would like to do has been
left undone in these busy days when
our first thought must be for our
country's welfare, but in the peaceful
tomorrow, who knows what dreams
may be dreamed, or what plans may
be accomplished?
