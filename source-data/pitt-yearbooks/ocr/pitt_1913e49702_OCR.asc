Come to my assistance, oh Muse, that I may truly sing the
praises of that class, which, in its own opinion, is the greatest that has ever
favored this old University by its attendance. And why say 1 such statements

bold? Pray lend me your ears, oh pretty maid, it is a long, long, sad story
which I am about to relate to thee.

In the class rush, did they shine? They (lid. The heavens wept, and ()ld>
Sol (lid even hide his face from the slaughter which they would have liked to
have done. Valiantly they did their best and engineered to crawl the frame of
one Pratt.

But this day’s work is spread upon the pages of history, little one, and it
is to you another tale I would unfold. As they did sail quietly along the under-
graduate sea, a vision did begin to make itself shown unto their untutored minds.
and what dost thou thinkest it could have been? THTC FLYING l)UTCll.\lAN!

Surrounded by hyroglyphic symbols, glass beakers, and sundry other tools
of witchcraft, he did lay a mighty spell o’er these, their te11der spirits, and
many fell before his deadly gaze. But sob not, fair one. the worst is yet to
come. Some few were they, who, by the liberal use of asafetida. which around
their necks was hung, these did drive away his deadly charm, and so does
l"luto's adage about the survival of the slickest rise up in all its might.

And next they held a feed. Smokes, they smoked; coffee, they drank;
sandwiches, they ate: and music, they murdered. Yea, it was a jolly
evening (?) little one, and all were happy until on the morrow pain did in
their little stomachs start to dwell.

But did they stop at the banquet board? ()h, nay! They engineered that
vast and awful voyage when. to the top of Uni. hill, the green cap was carried

‘)8

 

to its funeral pyre.

\Vhile some other men were afraid of wet feet, not an

engineer did have fear in his heart for those pedal extremities.
And so we must stop our tale, oh little one, and thou must go to rest and

dream of those valiant engineers of the class of 1915.

Success must crown

the efforts of that class of Freshies, roughnecks. simpletons, and good fellows,
who for their official paper have adopted the Police Gascttc.

(J the 1913 Miners belongs tl1e distinction of being the founders of
the Mining School. It was just three years ago that work under
any kind of favorable conditions in the Mining School began.
\\'hile there were few prime movers in this foundation they made
up for this deﬁcit by quality (ii). For instance. take that “Golden

llaired Teuton”, who learned enough in a few months to tackle the world with

a wealtli of knowledge and determination. Again. look at Paul “Revere”. He

knows just enough to qualify for the exemption list in nearly all exams. Then

look at the pictures of the class ﬁght and notice the care free determination
stamped on their Visages. Your heart will go out in admiration. \\’e could
continue in this \'€l11 until the last of the “Pioneers” would be accredited great.

The historian, however. doesn't think this a ﬁtting place for biographies, es-

pecially of embryo mining engineers. who have not yet electriﬁed the world.

hence we shall proceed on more of an historical basis.

\\'e were somewhat handicapped at first by not being acquainte(l with con-
ditions and with each other. but. like a new machine. the friction soon wore
the rough edges smooth and it was not long before our ship was sailing in the
calmest of seas—harmony. Do not think. however. that we shall reach port
under these most favorable conditions, for many a ripple has changed our course
and who dares judge the balance!

’Tis said that Ed is slow and then some. The fact
of the matter is that Ed thinks so fast that he has two
or three thoughts to express, and in his anxiety to select
the best one, either hesitates in performing the process
of elimination, or ‘blurts all three thoughts out at the
same time, resulting in an incoherent number of sounds
which sometimes make even the Prof. smile. You can’t
get Ecl’s goat, though, no matter what you say. The
fellow that made Ed angry has yet to put in his ap-
pearance.

For all his slow qualities Joe has a temper as explosive
as fulmonite. Perhaps that is why he is 11ot molested
by the “kid(lers”; not that they fear the power behind
his left, but they probably do not care to have an ex—
plosion occur. While on a mine—surveying trip to
Greensburg recently he learned the art of navigation.
but it might be mentioned that the only ship he learned

to sail was acake of soap through a painted sea. The

has to employ an interpreter at the class meetings? He
is here looking for a Pittsburgh heiress and will un-

Ill? same year that the name of \\'. U. P. was changed to University of
Pittsburgh, a couple of very able members of the Allegheny County
bar, Mr. _los. A. Beck and Mr. _los. R. Conrad, foreseeing a dearth
of wholesome amusements for the Pittsburgh youth, conceived the
idea of creating an Evening Course of studies in the line of Eco-

nomics, Accounts, and Finance. The matter was taken up with the University

authorities and the department commenced business, and. curiously enough,

Messrs. Beck and Conrad were the first instructors on the pay-roll. A crew

of eight men were the first victims to matriculate. These pioneers plodded

along iii the new field, holding sessions in the \\'abash Building. not so far from
historic old Fort lluquesne. It is worthy of note that four of these men were
graduated in the First and. as yet. the only Evening School class to reach that

goal, iii the year 1911.

 

The school took in some measure to the Malthusian doctrine of increasing
in geometrical proportions, and, after a hop, skip and a jump, the enrollment in
l9l I-12 reached three hundred and thirty-six, the largest single school in the
University. However. the statement must be taken with a grain of salt, for
many of the young hopefuls lose courage, or else cannot scrape up enough
mazuma to start them into the second semester. The scene of operations of the
school were shortly removed to the Engineering Building. which became known
by its present name of Thaw Hall, and at the present time, sessions are held
in that ediﬁce, the night men busily engaging themselves in producing Balance
Sheets and Proﬁt—and—Loss Statements. in accompaniment with the Pitt Student
Band upstairs, the Glee Club and Cap-and-Gown Club across the hall, and the
Mandolin Club in the next room. Of course, as the enrollment increased, the
faculty and the curriculum of studies was augmented, so that at present one
may study everything from feeding the poor to beating the railroad companies,
under competent instructors.

 

The night men found each other to be very likable fellows, and to further
bind themselves together organized the Evening School Association, and this As-
sociation enrolls most of the night men on its books. In 1910 the Association
elected to its presidency, Mr. Chas. D. \\'ettach, a hustler of “the strenuous life”
type, whose efforts sent the Association forward into a position of stability
and importance. Mr. \\'ettach graduated in 1911, but before leaving left a
memorial in the shape of an annual prize to be given to the best all-around
scholar in the school, and one for the second best.

The Association provides banquets for its members several times each
year, to which the Faculty are invited. and the members of said Faculty invari-
ably use the occasion to express their pity and admiration for us poor, indus-
trious boys, who work hard all day and give up our worldly pleasures to the
drudgery of study.

The present year is the first one to see the Co-eds in the school. It is
hardly to be expected that they will keep the secret in their own hearts, so there
will doubtless be an increasing number of them each succeeding year.

Misery loves company, and the upper—classmen welcome all Freshmen, and
do not harass them with the unwelcome attentions shown the Freshmen in the
other schools. The F.\'ening School is not merely a school,—it’s a11 institution,
bound to beneﬁt not only its members but the entire community. It also en-
joys the unique privilege of being a member of one of the strongest organiza-
tions in the United States, The National Association of Credit Men, and the
excellent work of that Association cannot but be furthered by the enlightenment
of the American youth in the problems of business.

"Brock” is going to leave us this year,

he is gone, we will realize that absence
makes the heart grow fonder.

JAMES EDW. CLUNE,

The underelassees always found James
so digniﬁed and reserved that they feared
him, and have, therefore, found out none
of his faults and weaknesses. However,
we have reliable authority that his re-
serve is only subterfuge to fool himself,
and he is at heart a reckless l)oy like the
rest of the Seniors.

though he is employed l)y the University,

thing has cost Rano the loss of his own

JOHN M. SCANLON, Pittsburgh, Pa.

Being a Senior has not meant any loss

But, we must remember somebody who
needs it will ﬁnd it.

divided between business and stump speeches. In
the latter he is very much in demand, being partic-
ularly effective on account of his directness. His
popularity led to his appointment as Evening School
Editor of “The Owl.” All in all, “Doc” is one of the
shining stars of the evening school as the gold medal
awarded in 1911 for general excellence will testify
that he is not only a hustler but also a student.

\

  

,  SW 0 give the history of the University of Pittsburgh in a brief sketch
l   like this is an impossible undertaking. Volumes could be written
 but it is our endeavor here to mention the principal facts, as they
 were.

     
     

  
    

   

It is necessary that we carry ourselves back in imagination to
the time when our nation was in its infancy. One hundred and twenty-ﬁve
years ago there were but thirteen stars upon the flag of the United States. The
thirteen states composed a loose Confederacy confronted at every moment with
danger of disruption.

In 1786 the publication of the Pittsburgh Gazette, a weekly newspaper,
had been begun and Hugh Henry Brackenridge began to contribute a series
of spirited articles to its columns advocating, among other things, the estab-
lishment of a school. He was a man of power; was a graduate of Princeton
in 1771, in the same class with James Madison, who became later the Presi-
dent-of the United States; and Philip Freneau, “the poet of the Revolution,”
with whom, before coming to Pittsburgh, he had collaborated in literary efforts.
Later he became a Judge of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania.

In the fall of 1786 Brackenridge went to Philadelphia to take his seat as
a member of the General Assembly of the Commonwealth, and while there
secured the enactment of a law incorporating the Pittsburgh Academy as a
seat of learning. He also obtained a grant from the heirs of VVilliam Penn
of a piece of land at the corner of Third Avenue and Cherry Alley, as a site
for the school, and a grant of ﬁve thousand acres of land in the northwestern
part of the state to be used as an endowment.

The fathers of the institution, whose names are written as the incorpora-
tors, were as follows: Rev. Samuel Barr; Rev. James Finley, a younger
brother of President Finley, of Princeton; the Rev. James Powers; the Rev.

Joseph Smith, all graduates of Princeton and pioneers in the cause of educa--

tion, through whose labors subsequently the Academy at Washington and the
Academy at Canonsburg came into being, both perpetuated to—day in Wash-
ington and Jefferson College.

James Bradford was a man of inﬂuence and ability, who assisted the
Academy. His granddaughter was the wife of Jefferson Davis, the President
of the Confederate States of America.

 

WILLIAM P. MCARDLE,
 Manag'e1' 1913 Owl.

One of the wise men who ate supper at home be-
fore partaking of the Bryan dinner at the 125th anni-
versary. He is not full of gas like some of the rest
of us_.—his employers, the Philadelphia Company
have robbed him of all that,—but when he speaks
his stentorian voice make us sit up and take notice.
His hearty good nature has endeared him to us, and
his friendship is assured to all those who have paid
their “Owl” assessment promptly.

CHARLES L. MCCALL, Pittsburgh, Pa.
Pittsburgh Academy.

“Chad” or “Mack” is such an ambitious lad and
just the kind that can do two things at one time. For
instance——smoke two cigarettes at once. And he
takes advice like a sponge takes water. He has
bought every one of the one hundred seventeen vol-
umes recommended by Doc Holdsworth as reliable
authorities on “Money and.” But why such a ﬁne
looking fellow should have to stag it to an  S. A.
(lance is still an open question.

THOMAS A. NESBITT, Philadelphia, Pa.
Pierce Business College, Plliladolpliiai
Evening School Association.

He is big in stature and he is big in heart. He
still has an attraction in Philly and he goes there
quite often. He admits it's a girl but works the old
“cousin” game in a plausible way, saying it’s a niece.
and clinches the argument by saying his wife always
accompanies him. It’s not Nes1)itt’s.fault that he
resembles Mutt in appearance; neither is it the fault
of our own selves that we should have to submit to
his looking down upon all of us, for few can ever
hope to attain a body two and a half yards in per-
pendicular.

HARRY ANTHONY NOAH,

Exeuing School .\SSOCltiti()ll.
Pitt Glee Club.
Here is a man who does not hide his light under
a bushel, a good old scout who makes life worth
living, for himself and for others. Still, he is not 3.
fast man, for “fast living makes a slow liver,” and
Noah has other matters to think of besides his
health. Co--eds are warned that he is a member of
the “Batche1ors’ Club” and his attentions are not
to be construed as intentions.

HARRY s. PHILSON, Pittsburgh, Pa.
E. S. A.

\\'e use a sort of three-cushion mnemonic aid to
remember his na1ne,—we say “Budweiser——Pabst—
Pilsner.—no, Philson.” You wouldn’t thinkhe would
ever get far in the world judging by the very, very
short steps he makes. He has a book with every
word in it that Conrad has said in class,—no, it’s not
a dictionary, but Philson can write shorthand to beat
the bullets.

CHARLES w. REYNOLDS, Pittsburgh, Pa.

Charles started life in the wild and woolly west
and then came to Pittsburgh. Then followed the
old, old story of getting into bad company,—(apo10-
gies to the Professors), which brings our hero’s his-
tory up to the present place and date. But “Chas.”
is as bad as the rest of us, and just as poor, and
just as holiest, and just as dissatisﬁed with life as it
is. So, like us, he said “Nobody cares.—I will go
right out into the back yard and eat worms,” and
forthwith he joined the Evening School.

It must be nice to be a “Master of Accounts”
whatever that is. It probably comes in handy when
one must give an account of one’s self. If Roney
ever thought seriously of anything we would like
to see her. His ready wit and quick tongue are
very “boring” at times and often recommend him
for the object of a punt below the belt when his
back is turned. Roney eats ﬁsh. as evidenced by the
bones sticking out on him, He is daily on daffydills.
with which he has ﬂooded the market. V\/hat will
you have? Roney answers “Buttermilk.” (-)o——oo——

ALBERT SCHIMMEL, Pittsburgh, Pa.
Alleglxcny High School.

Al registers “from Allegheny,” for none of the
folks up Spring Hill way have yet heard of the con-
solidation. Schimmel has put one over on the most
of us, for he is now a public accountant and wears
a fur—co1lar which makes him look like Sherlock
Holmes, minus the pipe. His favorite diversion is
fast young ladies. (with the accent on the “ies,” for
one was not enough to bring to the E. S. A. dance).

OSCAR L. ARNOLD, Wilkinsburg, Pa.

Oscar is no such a terribly fast man even if he is
in the auto business. Last year’s Owl tells us that
he is not related to Benedict Arnold, but neverthe-
less. he is a benedict and we cannot see where his
better half has done him any harm as yet, for has he
not advanced from the slowest thing in the world,
the telephone company, to the fastest?

 

WILLIAM F. BILLINGER, Pittsburgh, Pa.

“Billy” has an eye to everything and two for the
stock market. Has anyone ever seen “Billy” with
his tie awry, or his hat lopsided, his hair mussed-up,
his shoes dusty, or a hair on his coat sleeve? No.
He is not that kind of a man. He was brought up
on Mellin’s Food and Gold Dust. This explains how
he got those pretty features and brilliancy. On the
diamond he is a star, except that in running bases he
runs entirely too long on the same spot.

GORDON G. BLASS, Pittsburgh, Pa.

Our poor unfortunate brother has been ensnared
by feminine smiles and wiles. \Nhy should we give
women their rights when they take our own rights
away from us? Tell us that, please. We had a right
to Blass’s continued company.

MICHAEL C. CONICK, Pittsburgh, Pa.
Pittsburgh Academy.

“Limited” does not refer to his speed, but to his
knowledge of the Law. It took Mique a whole year
to learn that it is entirely possible to live while at-
tending the evening school, but we are now glad to
say that he is a hearty supporter in the cheering
and a hearty eater at the banquets. We look for-
ward to the time when he will place a burning weed
in his face at an E. S. A. smoker and little do we
doubt that he could smoke us all out if he wanted a.
But he doesn’t wanta.

RAYMOND M. FULTON, Bigler, Pa.

Ray’s the candy kid, spending his daylight hours
at Reymer’s and can be found at Goettman’s oftener
than at school. He does not take up much room
verti_cally. He is either worn off at the bottom from
much walking, or he’s been sawed off, driven in, or
perhaps hammered down, for he has an expansive
bosom. He is camera shy by his own confession
for he fears the Mennen’s Talcum Powder people
will snap him and use his likeness for their ads.

129

 

EARL GOSSER, Pittsburgh, Pa.

The way Earl and his lady posed their terpsichor—
ean abilities at the E. S. A. dance was pronounced
most immodest by the envious assemblage present.
He believes in doing everything up right, so he is
taking a course in real estate before building the
house. Earl is a typical street-car conductor for he
neither chews, smokes, swears, spits, drinks, or has
any of the other little vices of the common lot of us.

ALBERT D. GRAHAM, Braddock, Pa.

He is a man of practical methods. Says a fellow
saturated with actual practice cannot absorb any of
the theory meted out to him here. Forget some of
your actual practice, man, for the time being at least.
Perhaps you will learn after all that all practice orig-
inated with theory. There is a reason, yes, there is
a reason for doing everything, no matter how easy.

DEANE F. HAYES, Crafton, Pa.

The man who owns the Allegheny County Light
Company. His many other interests forced him to
throw up the sponge in the middle of the year and
chances for a C. P. A. went traveling. But he don’t
need the coin—the ball team he owns in the Crafton
Church League would keep him in luxury for years.

WILLIAM WALLACE HENDERSON,
Pittsburgh, Pa.

Pittsburgh High School.

A student of dancing. Art and grace and beauty
are. his essentials. It has been rumored that he is
the originator of the “Turkey Trot,” the “Grizzly
Bear” and the “Bunny Hug.” Henderson is study-
ing accounting to find out the quickest and most
economic method of placing buttons on shoes.

130

 

HAROLD E. HOLVERSTOTT, Pittsburgh, Pa.

This big, good-natured son-of-a-gun ought to give
up his job and come back to us. When golden
chrysanthemums are in bloom, we will look for you,
Holvy, beside the biggest one in the grandstand.

ALLAN B. MASON, Pittsburgh, Pa.

Says but little and says it softly. Mason is in the
insurance business, which is a dangerous, if proﬁt-
able, occupation; but we trust he can keep himself
out of the law’s clutches through his learning gained
here. His ﬂaxen hair would command a good price
at a doll hospital. Seldom does anything out of the
ordinary,—just comes and goes like a pendulum.

GEORGE MEYER, Pittsburgh, Pa.

He is one of those who have fallen by the way-
side, for the night air gives him rheumatism, but
we can only hope to see his girlish face next year.

HERMAN MOEKLE, Wilkinsburg, Pa.

A man who can bottle up his wrath at all times is
a corker. Moekle is always “there” with a joke and
a smile that won’t come off, even when the Prof’s.
insist upon inserting an “r” in his name. If Her-
man would come oftener, and earlier, and stay
longer, we might be enabled to divulge some of the
inner secrets of his life.

EDWARD A. OWENS, Pittsburgh, Pa.

We were about to say that this man is “bellicose,”
but we mean “obese.” He is thoroughly sane on
every subject but law and his questions in class in-
dicate his purpose of writing a book on “How to
Avoid Them.” Owens cares so much about the Uni-
versity that he heard nothing about the I25th Anni-
versary until it was past and almost forgotten.

131

 

WILLIAM JAMES PATTERSON,
Edgewood Park, Pa.

 S. A.

At his work he is surrounded by “shocking” condi-
tions; he is employed at the Westinghouse Electric
Company. He is an able and capable man whose
chief delight is attempting something he knows
nothing about, but being a good talker he bluffs his
way through admirably. “Pat” is one of the best
natured men in the class and his unreserved grin
reaches from ear to ear.

RALPH CALHOUN PITTINGER,
East Liverpool, 0.

Notwithstanding the bloody name of his home
town he is not very war-like. His greatest pleasures

_are work and study, and he is but little addicted to

the frivolities the most of us like. He invariably
takes a front seat in the class room and does not
come for even a rear seat at any of our feasts and
frolics.

CHARLES T. POELLOT, JR., Pittsburgh, Pa.

Oh where, oh where, is my little man gone?
Answer:—Engaged.——Huh?

ADOLPH J. SCHABACKER, Jenkintown, Pa.

We understand this gentleman is about to leave
our midst and it behooves us to apprize him of the
fact that we greatly appreciated his jocular disposi-
tion and the aroma of his pipe. And to express our
gratefulness for his friendship we can only give him
apiece of second-hand advice. It reads as follows:
“The youth and the girl with slender resources who
decide that two can live as cheaply as one, soon
agree that food doctors are right in saying people
eat too much.” “A ten-cent can of ham-and-eggs,
please.”

 

ALBERT H. SCHUTTINGER, Pittsburgh, Pa.

Albert greatly surprised us by his attendance at
the dollar dinner, for heretofore he has adhered to
the straight and narrow path of work and study.
He is a friend of the workingman and on the side
of reform no matter what the subject may be. The
boy must see something very immodest about the
rest of us, for we always ﬁnd him blushing when we
look his way.

FERDINAND G. SCHULTZ, Pittsburgh, Pa.

When it comes to generosity “Ferdy” has us all
beaten to a frazzle. He is the guy that furnishes the
old and forlorn batchelors of the class with delight-
ful feminine companions at the E. S. A. dances. He
has always been a shining light at our festivities, but
we have missed his presence for so long a while that

we shall have to guard against disrespect to the‘

dead, by keeping discreetly silent. “Schultz, wo bist
du?” '

HENRY H. STEWART, Pittsburgh, Pa.

O, that we might see his dear face again.

CHARLES A. STONER, Pittsburgh, Pa.

In the summer he ﬁshes and talks about the whop-
pers he caught in days bygone. In the winter when
he can forget about his aspirations to be 9. Willie
Hoppe he does not ﬁsh.

HOWARD L. THUMM, Pittsburgh, Pa.

“Degrees recoived—100."
“Athletics—all round."
“0rganizations——A. P. A.” _

Thumm had two ambitions in life, he wanted to
own a stable of racing horses. Then he becamea tile
merchant. After failing in both he turned his atten-
tion to accounting.

l33

 

WILLIAM A. VICTORY, Pittsburgh, Pa.

What’s in a name? It does not get this man any-
thing,—he always has an even chance of losing.
Banking is his business and dancing his side line;
some stepper, this boy. Single, good-looking, and
lots of money. Co-eds, you might look this chap
over.

WILLIAM HENRY WEIS, Pittsburgh, Pa.

Willy is one of the few married men of the class
whose wife don’t keep them down. As a result he
attends the E. S. A. functions, but the lateness of
some of these tend to keep him from early rising
Sunday mornings. He, therefore, resigned his Super-
intendency of the German Sunday School.

JOHN EDWARD WELTY, Wheeling, W. Va.
Vice President E. S. A. '11, ‘I2.

The “Beau Brummel” of the class; and, believe
me, people, he is some pumpkins. One of the own-
ers of the National Tube Company and the Evening
School Association. In the; latter he has the appel-
lation of V. P. Regularity is one of his virtues, and
when the bell rings at 7:45 Brother VVelty is always
on the job ready for business.

DALE S. WINDSOR, Pittsburgh, Pa.

Dale would not look natural without the pipe in
his mouth. He was brought up on “Five Brothers,"
and he has never chosen another companion. This
pernicious habit has kept him somewhat asleep dur-
ing these, his boyhood days, but doubtless we shall
look for him some day and ﬁnd him far ahead of the
rest of us.

The first meeting of the Trustees was held on March the 18th, 1788, at
which time an organization was affected. The first Secretary of the Board
was Robert Galbraith. The ﬁrst principal chosen was George VVelch. From
then until 1819 there were a number of principals whose names are too
numerous to mention, but for whom it may be said that they were men elected
to the position for their noble Christian characters.

Among the ﬁrst class were Morgan Neville, VVilliam Robinson, VVilliam
O’Hara and Charles Wilkins. VVi1son McCandless, a student of the Academy,
speaking in the University in 1856 said, “The nucleus of this institution was
the old Pittsburgh Academy, whence emanated many men who have illustrated
the genius of our government and people.”

Such was the prosperity of the Academy at the close of the second decade
of the last century. The manifest necessity for the establishment in this com~
munity of an institution of higher learning gave rise to a movement to re-
incorporate the Academy as “The Western Universityof Pennsylvania.’-’ This
was approved on February 18th, 1819.

The formal inauguration of the University by the beginning of college
classes did not take place till 1822. The interim was a transition period utilized
in preparation. The installation of the faculty occurred in the audience room
of the First Church. An eyewitness says of it, “There was a procession with
music, banners, and badges, in which the city fathers, the judiciary, gentlemen
of different learned professions, the Trustees, and students, marched to the
old First Presbyterian Church, where the venerable and accomplished Dr.
George Stevenson, the President of the Board, delivered the inaugural address
to the faculty, which was happily responded to in the massive eloquence of
Rev. Dr. Bruce.” A

The Academy was continued as a preparatory school to the University.

Subscriptions were sent in to the trustees, and the finest building in the
city was erected at the corner of Third Avenue and Cherry Alley. The insti-

tution prospered for 27 years, and among the alumni of that period were one‘

U. S. senator, four congressmen, three chief justices, two governors, one
ambassador, ten judges of United States and Commonwealth courts, eighteen
as trustees of colleges, ﬁve college presidents, thirteen professors, three
moderators of general assemblies, ﬁve editors and two authors of wide
reputation, and of everyone who lived long enough to test the worth of the
training he received it can be said, that he was an eminently useful member
of society.

I11 1845, on the 10th day of April, the city of Pittsburgh was visited by a
terrible disaster. Along with other buildings the University was burned to the
ground. Unfortunately the records were also destroyed. From 1849 to 1857
there were no buildings, but the money of the University was accumulating,
and in 1857, a new building was erected at Ross and Diamond Streets.

In 1858 Dr. George Woods was made chancellor of the University. The
school advanced with rapid strides in the acquisition of material resources.
Mr. Thaw gave one hundred thousand dollars while the people raised twice
that amount, and a large endowment fund was placed in its possession.

Dr. \Voods aided the school immensely by his untiring efforts, and in 1880
he was succeeded by Dr. Henry M. McCracken. During his administration
the University was changed to another location.

In 1884, Dr. Milton B. Goff was made chancellor. During his administra-
tion new buildings were added to the University in its Allegheny site.

Not until 1885 were‘ the untiring efforts of the University rewarded in the
founding of the Law School. About the same time the Engineering School
was established under Dean Carhart. In 1895 the VVestern Pennsylvania Medi-
cal College was absorbed by the University, becoming its'Medical Department.
The Pittsburgh College of Pharmacy became a part of the University shortly
afterwards. A school of Dental Surgery was founded. The School of
Mining Engineering was established by the State in 1897. Post-graduate
courses in various branches were established.

Dr. Holland "held the chancellorship wisely from 1890 to 1900.

Dr. Brashear became chancellor from 1900 to 1902 in the period before the
election of a new man.

‘In 1908 the name of the University was changed to that of the University
of Pittsburgh. During the administration of Chancellor McCormick, from 1902,
great things have been done. A new campus has been acquired and a number
of ﬁne buildings already erected. The institution has taken on new life, and
although we are surrounded by the roar of machinery, we are determined that
the amenities of literature and the graces of good style shall not fail to be culti-
vated. And as the Legislature of Pennsylvania intended that it should stand
as the exponent of University principles and methods in the western half of
the Commonwealth, ministering to the needs of the three and one—half.millions
of people living within reach of this metropolis at the head waters of the Ohio,
we trust, in as far as this publication can express, that its name shall go on and
that its light shallishine out forever.

When a man is married we expect him to lose some

ALBERT HILL MCCREERY, Munhall, Pa.
Munhall High School.

The man with the card system of notes. Our future
professor in some medical subject. This pro—physician
hails from Munhall, a suburb of Homestead.

VVhen being teased Mac’s favorite expression is, Fel-
lows, I am going to get sore. McCreery is a good stu«
dent, congenial, and one to whom to stick.

“In obstetrics he is greater than Tyco Brahe or Erra
Pater.”

JOHN ADAIR NEVERGOLD, NEN, Hite, Pa.

High School.
Baseball 1909.

VVe present here another baseball crank. Thinks of
many things, but you must not mention the good old
summer sport or he will talk you to death. Knows all
the records? Vi/ell, we guess!

All things that glitters is not gold.

W‘liat care I when I can lie and rest,
Kill time and take life at its best,

JOHN H. NEWELL, NEN, Wilkinsburg, Pa.
Wilkinsburg High School.
tilee Club.
—“I watch the gate.”

The two—headed James of our class. If there is a
social function, :1 football match, or anything requiring
a gate and gatekeeper, there ﬁnd friend Newell.

He is the possessor of the original eye (camera).

Once he s-pots you, good—night! Besides knowing every—.

one at the medical school, our gatekeeper is quite a
judge of poultry. It is said that he has a discriminating
eye for chickens.

WILLIAM NOLAN, NZN, Reynoldsyille, Pa.

High School.
Vice President 1913.

This is our Beau Brummel. We expect he is a
ladies man, but cannot get any positive evidence‘; only
circumstantial evidence. With all his fastidiousness
and love of ﬁne garments, we appreciate his good fel-
lowship, voting him into the management of our class
when the president is absent. “A man of dignity and
proper’ professional demeanor.”

“\7Vhat he says (on exams).
You may believe and pawn your soul upon it.”

163

 

CHARLES ELMER PARK, <I>PE, Canonsburg, Pa,
Wooster.

The subject of this sketch is a congenial fellow, with
a high brow; the latter was produced at Wooster, while
we pounded in the former. Oh, the hair was lost in the
pathological laboratory last vacation when those little
bugs were changed from tube to tube.

“You may relish him more in the soldier than in the
scholar.”

ROBERT PATTERSON, ‘PPS, Turtle Creek, Pa.
Pittsburgh Academy.

This young man comes to us from Turtle Creek. He
is a hard worker and a very good student, but worries
greatly until the marks of the examinations are given
out. He also has a slight advantage over the most of
us in being‘ able to give his patients divine advice (in
case they need it) after treatment we’ll warrant him
heartwhole.

MAURIC SNOWDEN REDMOND, ‘I>B1r,
Ingram, Pa.

Pi ttsburgh High School.

This will serve to introduce to the public our hero—a
redman, but not an Indian.

One evening Reid attended a smoker. On returning
home quite late, noticed a commotion, people rushing
hither and thither. A roaring lion had escaped from
some circus, was advancing up Center avenue. Redman
ran into the house (not from fear), secured a nail ﬁle,
stabbed the lion, and saved the people.

Alas, dear reader, Murice was On-ly dreaming!

JOSEPH ARNOLD ROBINSON, AKK,
Pittsburgh, Pa.
l’ittsburgl1 High School.
Alpha Kappa Kappa.
Business Manager of 1913 Owl.

Joe is one of those excellent sort of young men that
does not let his college work interfere with his studies.
In fact the more work, you give the better he likes it.
The nnanswerable questions are pie for him.

From simple business manager he soon became the
whole concern. \Ve intrusted the Owl to his care, We
also have had to bear his tyranny in the management
of our class this year.

Man dressed up in a little brief authority.

LEON EDMUND SEVEY, <1>PZ, Pittsburgh, Pa.

South Grand Rapids High School.
Detroit College of Medicine.
Baseball 1911.

When Leon is dressed up he looks like a corn doctor
going to the city hall for a license. “So exclusive, you
know.” Another very bad trait in this young man is
baseball. He really believes he can play the tganie. We
hope for the best!

We love him so much that we call him “Swain.”

THOMAS H. SNOWWHITE, ‘EX,
McKees Rocks, Pa.
Union High School.

Fat men as a rule are jovial, but such is not the case
with a distinguished member of the Junior class, He
has obtained sufticient knowledge to answer all ques-
tions submitted by his classmates.

“All is not Gospel that he doth spake.”

165

OIL,   JAW,
 

ALBERT A. WAGNER, AKK, N. S., Pittsburgh, Pa.
Trinity Hall.
Washington and Jefferson.

A good—natured fat man who ‘wishes to please every;
one. He will even cut class to do you a favor! Be—
tween classes he rolls cigarettes for the boys, leaving
only the edges to be moistened. Everything has its
place in nature, and we expect Al to make good.

“Fat punches have lean pates, and dainty bits
Make rich ribs, but bankrupt the wits.”

JOHN VOGT WILSON, cpx,
Elizabeth High School.

This fellow citizen is our Chemical expert. “A Milk-
maid” from Lock No. 3. He ﬂoats down the river
every morning, and as is well known, this means of
transportation is out of date. But we cannot convince
him to give it ui , and consequently he arrives late at
school, interrupts the lecturer by a hasty entrance. Bet-
ter late than never, dearie, but better never late.

“A good student needs no praise.”

WALTER GARVIN AUGHENBAUGH, <I>P2:,
Pittsburgh, Pa.

Allegheny High School.

Aughie comes from the North Side, but we will not
hold that against him. It has been said that knowledge
is the only commodity not screwed down tight, but we
believe milk formulas are not included. We expect
this young man to revolve very fast in the profession
and get from them all the good points.

166

 

ALBERT J. BRUECKEN, Allegheny, Pa.
M. F. Dolans.

Caesar warned us of the lean, hungry-lo0kin_g, thus
“beware.” Yon Cassius hath a lean and hungry look.
He thinks too much; such men are dangerous; nor does
he think of his looks, either, except the wonderful crop
of cranial “fur.”

A member of last year’s class, A bad case of ty-
phoid sent him back to us; no disgrace to him.

“Some men remind. us of angels, they are so dif-
ferent.”

SAUL HAYMAN FRANKS, Pittsburgh, Pa.
Pittsburgh High School.

\Ve gained this recruit through sickness and the addi»
tion has proved to be beneﬁcial to us in more than one
instance. The mills of the Gods grind slow but ﬁne.
Hence we expect this young man to make good. as he
grinds, grinds, grinds.

He makes a furnace of his month
And keeps his chimney burning.

WILLIAM EDWIN GARDNER, AKK,
Pittsburgh (N. S.), Pa.

Allegheny High School.

This is to introduce our Daniel who comes to judg-
ment when Heard is calling, He is a rare bird, for he
is a bookworm, but a bookworm that has eyes to see
and a mind to reason. All bookworms have not this
faculty.

The reason we go into such cat ﬁts over this person
is that he stands around the head of the class, bids
fair to stay there regardless of the fact that he plays
“truant.”

“A progeny of learning.”

167

 

WILLIAM THOMAS MARDORFF, <I>PZ,
Bedford, Pa.

Bcdlord Academy.
High School.

lt is unfortunate" we have no Victor Hugo in our
class to do justice to our “Sphinx.” Mardorff will
make some of us ﬂunk yet for doping lectures instead
of taking notes. VVe look at him and wonder when
will he speak. Besides being a Sphinx, \/Villiam is
somewhat of a ﬁxture. He has been with us since the
dawn of time. Last year it was a broken leg, but in
spite of all these misfortunes our Sphinx has some
knowledge. When anyone is injured “At Night” in the
electric works they send them to Mardorff. That ac-
counts for the great mortality in Wilkinsburig lately.

FRANK K. MILLER, Madera, Pa.

Madera High School.
Pitt Student Band.

Our little Jefferson wears a sweater in order to save
laundry bills and he looks quite cute‘ in it, too. Frankie
has all those little tricks which Bud Fischer loves to de-
pict. All in all, Miller is a good sport and we like him
for all that.

“Behold the child, by nature’s law,
Pleased with a sweater, tickled with a horn.”

F. W. Si. JLAIR. NEN, Latrobe, Pa.
Washington and Jefferson, A.B.

We received this Anatomist from Johns Hopkins.
He is known as Spalteholz, a Frenchman with a German
name. Our human card index system. He classiﬁes
lectures by a system all of his own. Take notes? No
indeed; he dopes the lecture.

W'e‘ honor him for his nerve. Some day the little
system will fail and the Saint will fall.

“With a smirk and a smile,
His proofs to beguile.”

HURLEIGH HILE BATES, ‘I’-Q, Avalon, Pa.
Ohio Wesleyan.
Varsity Football.

Breezy, bellieose and bustling. He hails from :\\'Z1lOIL
hence the smile. That eternal smile which Hurleigh
constantly displays is the source of much mystery to his
fellow stu(lents. Some say that Hile is really happy
but others say that it is merely a habit that all
Avalonites fall into while abroad, thus forcing the
uninitiated to falsely believe that Avalon is what it

Zadoc Bell, the pedagogue. Par—Excellence—-Eugene.
He calls Mt. \Vashington his home. But in all fair-

level with his classmates. Zadoc may be called a good
natured “rough neck,” as his lunch room record will
show. Eugene’s paths is marked by a train of riotous
actions and a good natured uproar. V\/'hen a fellow

maritan.

The Duquesne Cyclone, originator of 50 per cent. of
the world’s nutty stuff. Seen at his best in German
dialect which he acquired by intimate association with
another football player from Duquesne. “Bonnie" is a
diligent worker if other kindred souls do not come near
him while in his state of high resolve. He is some ath-
lete, having won his letter in basketball.

As :1 “good scout” Broady may be classed among the
first raters. Melvin once entertained the idea that he
was a football player, but ne‘f—ced, As a “fusser” Frost
is the goods, a heavy telephone‘ eonversationalist and
may truthfully be called a lady's man. He will un-
doubtedly be welcomed heartily by the 399 inhabitants
of Grantsville when he returns there as a dentist.

WILLIAM ANDREWS CALVERT, AEA,
Greenville, Pa.

Jamestown High School.

“Cal” is the guardian angel of his fellow roommates.
He spends about two hours every morning in rousing his
sophorilically inclined classmates whose destinies he
feels lie wholly in his guiding care. “Bill” is a steady-
going modest sort of a chap who feels that to miss a
lecture is a most heinous crime. He is a lover of burr
lesqne shows, two—for-a—nickel tobies, buttermilk and
niekelodeons.

CLARENCE BENJAMIN CHURCH, ASA,
Littleton, W. Va.

West L1'bert§' No1'111al School. West Virginia University.

Marsliall College. Cap and Gown Club.

Here we have an ardent “Democrat” from West Vir-
ginia. Clarence has a name that is not in keeping with
his character. Far be it from such. Such people say
that he is already the pride of Littleton and he daily
puts forth efforts that are sublime in their apparent
earnestness. He is a fiend for taxicabs and always a
real sport when out with the bunch.

WILLIAM E. COULSON, ‘P9, Washington, Pa.

Starling, (Jhio, Medical College.

This is Coulson’s first year with us, but he made good
from the start. VVilliam's great hobby ispautomobiles.
He loves to gather 21' select few of his pals about him
in the corner of the lab and regale his awed and ad-~
miring friends with hair~raising tales of his innuimerable
escapades with his wonderful “one—hoss" racer. He sure
is a knight of the gasoline.

WILLIAM DE LOSS DICKSON, \IIf2, Oakdale, Pa.
Grove City College.

“Dick” is from Oakdale and proud of it. He is a
ﬁne~looking boy, given somewhat to outbursts of indig-
nation, righteous‘ or otherwise, and professes a liking
for characters of the Everett True variety. He has
many friends and works when he feels like it.

CLARENCE F. DOERR, Slippery Rock, Pa.
Slippery Rock Normal School.

lt is rather difﬁcult to get a line on Clarence, as he
shies at all advances: nevertheless, he is very well liked.
He comes from Slippery Rock and therefore calls for
condolence. Doerr is an AI student and not prone to
midnight prowling. He affects those “Buck and Wing”
collars made famous by Napoleon Bonaparte. It must
be pretty tough, Doerr, to live up to your own convic-
tions in such an environment.

.-\ndrew is an impressionistic soul devoted to music.
National Guard, art and athletics. He comes from
Greenshurg and consequently is a pessimist. By close
association, ‘however, with Pittsburgh he is improving
and bids fair to be such a city chappie that Greensburg
will have to put in a Great \/Vihite Way for his special
use (on Saturday nights only) if they expect to keep
him in their home town. Modesty is one of "Andy's"

“Eddie” was going to be a railroad president some
day, but unselﬁshly laid aside his cherished expectations
and sacriﬁced his budding young life to Dentistry.
"Eddie" is the world’s cham-pion consumer of Jockey

Here we have the father and spiritual adviser of the
Junior class. His good fellowship permeates the class~
room and serves to keep the spirit of everybody up to
the proper pitch, French is married and works for the
B. & 0., but this has all been forgiven on account of his
unusual activity in school affairs. Here's hoping that

wind. Teuton by fate, football player by choice and
“Dent” by—w:ho knows what? Comes to school to re-
new acquaintances and to refresh his memory as to the
location of the building. Ambrose is the natural pro-
tector of Bonnie and is ill repaid for his efforts. He

dentistry. Nevertheless. good luck to you, George.

EUGENIA D. KOHANIK, Jersey City, N. J.

Cremia (Russia) High School.
I'nivei'sit_v of Pittsburgh Medical School.

Mrs. Kohanik is an old—timer in this department as
she remains stationary and shows a strong feeling for
Junior classes. Her style of coiffure is particularly no-
ticeable as it was at one time the style. but has long
since been taboed_ She comes from New Jersey but
seems to have a strong desire for Pittsburgh.

ARTHUR ALFRED KUNKLE, ABA,
Greensburg, Pa.

l*‘ranl\lin and lilarsliull .\ea<leIn_\'.

Here we have a man of unusual caliber. Kunkle
comes to school and is usually conspicuous by his quiet-
ness. He is never heard to make such vociferous ejacu-
lations as are so prevalent about the building. Arthur
is a ﬁrst—rate worker and his school work is unexcelled.
Kunkle hails from Greensburg. They will no doubt
greet him as a great celebrity when he returns there
with his diploma.

ALLISON L. LEWIS, ABA, Shippenville, Pa.

Lewis is the original guy that carried the banner that
read “Excelsior.” Although we have no Alps to climb,
Lewis is not daunted by this lack of scenery, so he strug-
gled daily up to Herron H'ill. He has been covering
himself with glory and fame by his excellent school
work. But here is where the impressed reader will be
awed and shocked—.'—\llison can rough house it with the
best of us. \Ve all feel safe in predicting him a suc-

Ralph may truithfully be termed as the backbone" of
the Junior class. For size he can't be beat, although
he has a close rival. Linn"s wide experience in journale
ism reveals his broadness of mind and optimistic views
that are good to behold. “Doc” is property man for
the Cap and Gown Club and ﬁlls this responsible posi-
tion to a “T.” He has a line of humor and wit that

FREDERICK F. LINDSTROM, ‘P9,
Jamestown, N. Y.

Jamestown High School.

(‘lass Football.

U\vl Board 1913.

Class Secretary.

Dental Reporter for Pitt \\1-elgly.

Here we have a sample of the good citizen of James-
town. This young man came to us fresh from the
journalistic staff of the “Bingville Bugle,” which was
responsible for the send—off he received when he left
Jamestown for Pitt. Fred has lived up to and fulﬁlled
the optomistic predictions of the "Bugle” and has ere--
ated for himself a wide circle of friends. He is a
“newsie” of no mean ability, having sold thousands of
Pitt VVecklies to the “Dents.”

JOHN BLAINE LITMAN, *1/52, Hannibal, O.
Hannibal High School.
\'a1'sit_v Baseball.

Litman comes to us from Hannibal. Ohio, and while
deeply interested in the dental profession he also takes
an active part in the produce market on which he can
converse quite fluently. John is naturally artistic both
in dentistry and athletics. He claims to be a semi—pro
but this assertion remains to be proved. Somewhat of
a pessimist but otherwise a good scout.

FRED C. LUDWIG, M2, Pittsburgh, Pa.

1’ittsbu1'gl1 High School.
Carnegie Technical Schools.
Cap and Gown Club.

Familiarly and affectionately known as "Dutch" for
o‘bvious reasons. He is an artist of abilit_v, his poster
girl for the college play, “Obstinate Mary," was of such
high order no further‘ evidence of his genious need be
sought. He has many friends gained through helpful,
kindly disposition. "Dutch” is quite a fusser, as witness
the fact that several bleeding hearts lie strewn througl’:-
out Oakland.

JOHN R. MADDEN, ‘l/S2, Mt. Pleasant, Pa.

Mt. Pleasant High School.

Class Vice l'1'esident.

Honest John comes to us from Mt. Pleasant. Just
where this place is remains to be discovered. John is
good—natured, a good. worker and takes an active i11-
terest in atheltics. Made‘ the football squad and bids
fair to make the Varsity next year. ]o=hn’s fraternal
spirit has won for him many a friend and will sure
bring him success. lt may truthfully be stated, especially
with reference to John, that the world knows little of
its best men.

HENRY R. MCKEE, *1/52, Pittsburgh, Pa.
Pittsburgh High School.

Popularly known as “Baldy,” because there is not a
hair between, him and heaven, not that the distance is
so near. Lord, no! We didn’t mean that. While around
school Henry is the very soul of paternal solicitude and
is always ready to share his hard—earned wisdom with
the younger and unsophisticated brethren. But we all
have weak spots and Mac’s is his conﬁrmed habit of
being a “First Nigliter” at the Academy.

WILBERT J. McKEE, M2, Pitcairn, Pa.
1’itcairn High School.

An interesting transition from a rongh—neck a11d
roug‘h—houser to a gentleman of reﬁnement and culture
is what happened to this chap. “Butch” is a great quiz
master and shows marked ability in the various sciences.
He is also versed in the lore of pugilism and its append-
ing sports. “Butch” is at present the “Pride of Pit«
cairn” and bids fair to maintain this lofty position after
college days are o’er.

WALTER DODDS MCCLEARY, Avalon.

\\'asl1ington and Jeﬁ‘erson Acadeiny.
l’ittsl)urgh .-\caden1_\'.
Wasllington and Jefferson College.

The characterization of him in last year's Owl still
holds good—“A gentleman of leisure." V\/alter, the ar~
tistically developed individual, is here as a result of a
highly con1plicate(l process of evolution. He has one
fault which can he noticed whenever our rival football
team plays here; that is, he is always found i11 VV. &J.’s
rooting section. However. we can overlook that, and
we congratulate him on his loyalty.

CHARLES ALBERT DONALD MOORE,
New Castle, Pa.

New Castle High School.
Slippery Rock _\'0rmal School.

Otherwise known as "Skin." Takes great delight in
hitting the hay. His roommate terms him as the cham-
pion long distance sleeper of the University. Moore is
somewhat of a dissectionist but usually makes himself
conspicuous by his absence during class. All habits
aside, Moore is well liked by his classmates and his
long list of friends is ever increasing.

FANNIE L. OLEON, Pittsburgh, Pa.

Pittsburgh Aeadclny.

Here we have a Co—ed of which the school should
well be proud, As a worker and jolly good fellow she
can't be beat. Fanny has very little use for the male
members of her class. Her one failing is timidity, which
constantly betrays her by the uncontrollable blush.
Tends to her duties in a manner that would bring envy
to the most ardent worker. She is bound to become a
dentist who will bring credit to her Alma Mater.

WILLIAM ABELL PATTERSON, M2,

W'illiam is the original character of the Juniors. His
great delight is to ride in taxicabs. Takes an active
interest in the field of sports. Boxing and baseball are
his specialties. At quizzes Abell has the knack of an-
swering so that it brings envy in the hearts of his class-
mates. Says that some people think that tending bar at
a soda fountain is a good occupation, but he prefers
dentistry.

“Joe” is an old—‘timer in point of varied service in the
University, having’ been in several departments up-to-
date. At present he shows signs of being permanently
settled and is giving the subject of dentistry a most
thorough investigation. Joe has won many friends
through a genial and accommodating personality. Very
strong for the gentle sex, as is evidenced by the fact that
he gets his dates mixed every once in a while and then
there. is the devil to pay.

WILLIS GLENN PHILLIPS, A23, Warren, Pa.
C-a1'e11gie Technical Schools.

Phillips and his wife are all right. It took a bunch
of nerve to get married during a school career, but
Phillips was there with the goods, and when the Junior
year opened he was made class president as a token of
our esteem and admiration for the disregard of his
bachelor associates. Phillips shines iii the class—room as
well as at the ﬁreside.

192

 

MARTIN WILLIAM PILGRAM, \I/.0,
Sharpsburg, Pa.

Aspinwall High School.

A bright, shrewd mind concealed beneath a misleading
exterior, made up of rosy cheeks and shcepish eyes.
Martin is there when it comes to work and studies, but
is handicapped by his backward inclinations. He came
from Sharpsbnrg with high school honors and he will
no doubt prove himself worthy of more honors upon
graduation from Pitt. Keep it up, Martin.

THOMAS ZWINGLI PLANK, ‘P9, Pittsburgh, Pa.
Allegheny High School.

A gentleman by every standard. Mild—n1annered,
quiet—spoken and peace—loving, his greatest aggressive-
ness is displayed against his studies and work, which for
neatness of ﬁnish can’t be beat. Not to like him shows
a lack oﬂ appreciation. Thomas will, without a doubt,
prove a successful dentist and also add laurels to the
profession. We are proud of Zwingli.

MAURICE RADIN, Pittsburgh, Pa.
Pittsburgh High School.

“Mickey” Radin, the white hope from the Hill dis-
trict. He acquired the name of “Mickey” by reason of
the fact that he is an enthusiastic follower of the
“squared arena,” being a recognized authority on pugil--
istic information. This may also be applied to the stage
as “Mickey” is also some “ham” actor. Maurice shines
in cliemistry as he insists that silver nitrate is obtained
from plants.

193

 

BESSIE RUBEN, Pittsburgh, Pa.

Her persistency during class to ask questions brings
despair to her classmates, but that is one way of learn-
ing, so keep it up, Bessie, reardless of our impatience.
Bessie bids fair to accomplish great things if she could
but shake that “hard luck” which constantly follows her.
Bessie’s good fellowship will win for her many a good
friend.

JAMES BLAIR SAMPSON, ASA, McKeesport, Pa.

Carnegie Technical Schools.
Duff’s Business College.

A cotillon leader of unequaled ability in McKeesport.
No function is complete without him. Blair is easy-
going; in fact, he goes about with that “nothing—to—do—
to—.morrow” air which is enough to make us all happy.
We all like him and are willing to overlook his social
propensities. He stands well in his school work and
bids fair to become one of the leading practitioners
when he returns to McKeesport.

GEORGE WARNE STATHERS, ‘I/Q,
Monongahela, Pa.

Monongahela High School.

Here we have a student in every sense of the word.
None of your nonsense for him. This youth was never
intended for frivolity, yet never fails to see a joke as
quick as the rest of us. The statement made in last year’s
Owl was a misconcep-tion of him and we have no hesi-
tancy in refuting it. George is a baseball enthusiast of
no mean ability. He always has taken an interest in
sports at large.

194

 

 

PAUL _C. TAYLOR, AEA, Emlenton, Pa.

Butler High School.
Cap and Gown Club.

Paul is a Butler product but his home is in Emlenton.
He juggled Jitneys for the street cars in Butler and
ballyhooed for-an zeroplane. These accomplishments
are sure to air him in his practice of dentistry. Paul
has periods of dejection when the postofﬁce up in Ipsi-
lanti, Mich, runs out of postage stamps. When not in
the throes of dejection his jovial and friendly nature‘
always comes to his rescue.

CHARLES BRUCE WILLIAMS, AEA,
Culpeper, Virginia.
Warwick (Va.) High School.
Eastern College, Point Royal, Va.

“Virginia Bill,,” the bad man from the hills. He
hails from the peaceful country surrounding Culpeper.
Don’t confound him with the Hillsville bandits. “Bill”
relates many wild tales to his friends, tales of the ante-
bellium days in the Sehenandoah Valley. He is now ne-
gotiating with the Allen gang with a view of placing
them in vaudeville. A natural—born bread winner and
hard worker who never gets discouraged.

ROSS PALMER WILLIAMS, Pittsburgh, Pa.
Pittsburgh High School.

“Dutch,” as he is familiarly known around school.
When once acquainted with his eccentricities he’s a
pretty good sort of a chap. Well versed in chemistry
as well as in other subjects. Owns a medal for regular
attendance at Sunday school. We wonder whether there
will be such a thing as a Sunday morning appointment
with him when he gets down to practice,

JOSEPH BAROCCHINI, Homestead, Pa.

It was once stated that Bairocchini talked something
like Daniel Webster’s style, but this statement is a mali—
cious falsehood. Joseph says so himself. It was also
reported that he hailed from Italy, but from later re-
ports he has since changed his abode to Homestead.
Can this be an improvement?

JAMES F. CLARK, ‘P9, Houtzdale, Pa.

Bucknell University.
Class President 1911.

We are all proud of Clark, regardless of the fact that
he comes from a place which occupied about a square
foot on the earth. He is some class as a pro-baseball
player and takes an active interest in other branches of
sport as well. Some day he hopes to land a big league
berth. He is a good worker and will make a good den-
tist once he gets started.

ROY E. DICE, ‘I42, N. S., Pittsburgh, Pa.
Pittsburgh Academy.

Here we have a name of great renown, but Roy is
not the kind that can be rolled. He is somewhat of a
fusser and may at all times be found acting in that ca-
pacity at just one place. Nuf ced. A pretty good stu-
dent and a general favorite among his classmates.

196

BERNARD ELLIAS GARDNER, Pittsburgh, Pa.
University of Moscow, Ph.G.

Behold, the conquering hero comes! ’Tis not often
that the eyes of such as we are permitted to feast in
unbridled joy and amazement upon such an astute para-
gon of inﬁnitesimal and consummate wisdom. Res-
cued, as it were, by the hands of fate from the bleak
and ferocious Steppes of Siberia. Here he comes,
versed in pharmacyiand divers hunks of disconnected
knowledge. We have him in all his glory.

HERMAN F. ‘MIDDEN, Cynthiana, Ky.

S1z1ith‘s Classical High School.
Ohio College of Dental Surgery.

This.is Midden’s first year with us, coming here
from the Ohio College of Dental Surgery. This
change is certainly their loss and our gain. Midden
is a good worker and student. He has gained for
himself a wide circle of friends throughout the
school.

JOSEPH WILLIAM MOSS, Homestead, Pa.
Iron City College.

A stubby, good—natured little fellow who is in for
everything and always sticks to the ﬁnish. Moss does
not carry out the name he hears, for he does not remain
stationary enough. He may be truthfully called the
gentleman of the Junior class. His polished ways and
his friendly manners will sure bring him success.

197

 

 

JOHN HENRY MacPHERSON, McKeesport, Pa.
Mclieesport Business College.

Here we have a man so much could be said about him
that it would ﬁll a book. “Mac,” as you all kr.ow, is a
staunch Socialist, hence you can draw your own :onclu—
sions. Nevertheless, as to his work, he is there with
the goods. He is a genius, as evidenced by his late. dis-
coveries in astronomy. “Mac” has many friends and we
all wish him success.

OWEN F. TACKNEY, Am, Throop, Pa.

“Tack” is English and gets the credit for being Irish.
His humor is never failing in its spontaneity and qual-
ity. He has recently disclosed to the athletic world a
marvelous prowess, namely, “Jumping over relays.”
From a study of the nervous system to the athletic ﬁeld
is going some. We fear Owen will be hard pnt when
he attempts to extract some obstinate molars. As a
suggestion we think that Phillips and Teresi should
practice with him.

PHILIP TERESI, Pittsburgh.
Curry College.
Teresi is in a class by himself, even if he does come
from Sunny Italy. A very modest chap who says very
little. There are many brighter fellows but none that

try harder and lend assistance. He is beyond compari-
son. They don’t come any better than Teresi.

" HIS faithful little band is a living example of the working out of Dar-
win’s theory of natural selection. It is indeed a case of the survival
of the ﬁttest. In the Fall of 1908 the upper left—hand corner of the
old chapel on Perrysville avenue reseiitbled a vast truck garden. It
would have made Doc Holdsworth's heart glad, had he been there, to
see so much green goods ﬂourishing within the city limits. But Old Daddy Time
has played hob with that verdant group and the survivors are proud to have
weathered the storm.

The exodus began with the exams for the semester. Several of the Fresh-
ies failed to make the riffle, and, as there was no Economics School in those.days,
the only thing that remained for them to do was to beat it hence. Since that time
there has been a steady thinning of the ranks. Some departed of their own ac-
cord while others got the hoof. Many followed the line of least resistance and
drifted into other departments. A whole ﬂock of the chickens deserted when Dean
Chambers established his hen-house in the back yard of the Engineering School.
Oh, how we missed them! The loss of their charming presence may have led
some of the stronger sex to leave our gloomy halls, but the massive—browed his-
torian thinks not.

The reasons of the survival of the weather—beaten band that remains are var-
ious. K. Jennings Holliday is here because of an innate tendency to keep on going
until he has reached his destination, in spite of the very Old Nick. ’Tis said
that he once butted a bull off the bridge at East St. Louis. Pap George’s case is
one of beautiful self-sacriﬁce. Pap might have graduated long since, but he
knows that the school would go to the bow—bows without him so he stuck around.
Edgar Niebaum found everything comfy here and just settled down. And when
Edgar settles down it takes an earthquake to disturb the even tenor of h’s way.
But non plus! (whatever that means) ’tis sufﬁcient to say we’re here because
we’re here and we shall soon be gone. The time is 3.l1‘.OSt here when we must go
up against the cruel, cruel world. Our motto shall be “Go to it, Kid, and get the
money” and the class of 1912 will demonstrate that even the School of Liberal
Arts can turn out a few live wires now and then.

knows it all, but it remains for some one to tell him
the facts.

WILLIAM EDWARD BURCKART,
New Castle, Pa.

New Castle High School.

Girls all rave over our “Billy” Burckart. Beware,
fair ones!

ANNA JOE BURRIER, Amsterdam, Ohio.

Kilgare High School.
Scio College.

You are so quiet, dear, what makes you so? Yes,
quiet is the word. You» look quiet, you talk quiet,
you laugh quiet, and you are quiet. We are sorry
to think of losing her, for she thinks one year of
Pharmacy just enough.

JULIUS ROMEO CONTI, Monessen, Pa.

Monessen I~Iig'l1 School.
Brown's College, Iiew York City.

“Rome rowed while Julie et.” Romeo is no doubt
of noble birth but he does not show it, for Romea
is very meek. Romeo will make a good pillist as
he has an eye to the proﬁt-sharing side of the ledger.

GOLDEN BORZOTRA DARBY, Salem, Pa.
Storer College, Harpers Ferry, Oho.
The other day a lady friend of Golden’s happened

in the store and after having a nice little chat with
him she asked for some ﬂesh colored face cream.

Golden carelessly wrapped up a box of shoe polish. A

Get me!

CHARLES P. DUNCAN, B‘I>E, Altoona, Pa.

Altoona High School.

Athletic Representative, Pharmacy Department.
Class Vice President.

President Class ’12.

Class Baseball.

Junior Prom Committee.

Our honorable president, ahem. Little and fussy.
Although a ladies’ man we fail to see the ladies go
near him. When he gets near them they all shy
away. But he’s a dandy fellow just the same. Stage

whisper—“Get the hook. Here comes Dunc.”

WILLIAM ANDREW DUNN, Chester, W. Va.
Irondale High School.

Previous to attending Pitt “Andy” was a Buckeye
kid, but later became a West Virginia snake. “Andy"
is very slow of speech but what he says is well Dunn.

218

 

FRED C. ELLIS, Ingram, Pa.
Pittsburgh Academy.

Quiet and modest “Freddie” serves as a sort of
counterbalance to “De1aware’s” jolly tricks. “Fred-

die,” you must refrain from throwing ﬁlter paper at
Greensberg.

CLYDE RAYMOND ERSKINE, Pittsburgh, Pa.
Carnegie Technical Schools.

“Ah, little traitress, none must know!” That ac-
counts for Ray1nond’s sad, sad visage. Always looks
as though he had been weeping. Poor boy. Don't
place all your faith in women. Save a little for other
things in life. Raymond is sad but bright as a west-
ern sunrise.

CHARLES C. FISHER, N. S., Pittsburgh, Pa.

He is so absent-minded that he came to school one
morning without a collar and tie. Better take the
memory treatment, bo.

CHARLES RUDOLPH GEORGE, Juniata, Pa.
Juniata High School.
Relentless Rudolph, forever on the go. What’s

your last name, Charles? All your names are first
names or handles.

WALTER ALEXANDER GORDON,
Rochester, Pa.

Rochester High School.
Indoor Track Team ’11.

The Marathon runner and marathon talker. When
Walt gets started we never know when he will stop.
If he could interchange running and talking he’d
be a wonder.

219

 

RICHARD GORMAN, Indiana, Pa.
Indiana High School.

Sorry to hear that he could not stand the pace.
Richard III, better luck to you next time!

GEORGE C. GRAY, N. S., Pittsburgh, Pa.
Allegheny High School.
His name is Gray but before saying another word
we might add that his mood is not of such a somber

hue. Although devoid of gray matter, he is as hap-
py as" could be,—cause and effect.

JOSEPH HAMILTON GREENBERG,
Pittsburgh, Pa.

Pittsburgh High School.
Fort Pitt College.

Known as “I25,” the ofﬁcial tattler of school. Can
never see a joke and always keeps everything to
himself.

JACOB LLOYD GRIMM, JR., <I>AX, Cascade, W. Va.
Dunbar Township High School.

Holds on to his subjects like Grim death, but he
is far from being what his name implies. He is not
grim, instead he is always grinning. Another of the
VVest Virginia Snakes.

WALTER WILLIAM HAMMOND, B<I>2,
Pittsburgh, Pa.
Cambridge Springs High School.

Little but oh my! \/Vhen he grows up and lives
on his Hydrastics farm he will have a golden seal.

220

 

GEORGE ARTHUR HERD, ‘FAX, Dunbar, Pa.
Dunbar High School.

If a fellow was called upon for a speech do you
think he would be Herd? You would make a good
aid to a detective and when that position is vacant
in the class we shall see that you get it. Aha! I
know what you are doing, villain, you are eating.
No, I’m chopping hay for the horse.

MAX EDWARD HIRSCH, N. S., Pittsburgh, Pa.

It has been suggested that the class donate a pair
of crutches for Max, so as to enable him to stand
upright while reciting. They will doubtless be pre-
sented to him at the close of the term so that by
next year Max will be able to stand.

CHARLES E. H. HOFFMAN, EAE, B<1>2,
Beaver, Pa.

Beaver High School.
Allegheny College.

Say, Charlie, why don’t you take that fuzz off your
upper lip? It’s an eyeshore and besides may pre-
vent you from receiving your R. P. The only one
of the class with nerve enough to brave the jokes
about hair lips.

CLYDE FRANCIS HUGHES, <I>AX, Altoona., Pa.
Altoona High School.

Here we have a specimen of solid ivory, not from
Africa but from Altoona. Clyde will get there, of
that we have no doubt, but the manner in which he
responds to questions in class are side—splitting. An
example: Dr. Darbaker: “VVhat have you on your
head, Mr. Hughes?”

Clyde: “Stomata.”

221

FRANK HOLLIS JOLLEY, Franklin, Pa.

He is all that his name implies. His middle name
ought to be Andy for then we should have him
known as Frank and Jolley, which would ﬁt him
like a glove. No doubt Frank likes to share Miss
Burrie’s table in chemical lab. We advise you to let
some of the other fellows in on it now and then,
Frank, because we want no broken hearts in our
class. It’s bad enough to break test tubes.

CHARLES J. KALEY, N. S., Pittsburgh.
Clearﬁeld High School.
Allegheny High School.

Of last year’s men who is with us this year. VVe
are glad to have you, Kaley, but we should appre-
ciate. a little lecture now and then on how to get the
Materia Medica stuﬁ to stick.

JOHN EARL KIME, South Fork, Pa.
South Fork High School.

Here is a model young man. If you will take no-
tice to the word model. Model, you know, means a
small imitation of the real thing. No insinuations,
Kimey, but it’s the truth, boy.

ROBERT AINSLEY KIRKMAN, B<I>E, Clymer, Pa.

“Robert of Sicily” and brother to Pope Ordain.
Robert, my son, we pronounce blessing upon you
for being such a good student, so here goes Nux
Vomica.

WILLIAM JOHN KIRSCH, Pittsburgh, Pa.

Noted for his ungentlemanly remark about the
girls. “Willie” is unable to stand during recitation
without a prop.

222

 

 

M. KUENZIG, Pittsburgh, Pa.

Pittsburgh High School.
Carnegie Technical Schools.
The class bacteriologist, at least you would think
so if you got a glimpse of him squinting through
the microscope in lab. We predict a brillia11t future

for him as bacteriologist of some unknown country
such as H or H.

HOWARD LOUIS LECKY, <I>AX, Johnstown, Pa.
Johnstown High School.

This boy has us guessing. Are you married or
are you not? We can hardly see how he could sup-
port two, now at least, when one can hardly support
oneself owing to the high cost of living. A warn-

ing, young one: Love is a dream; marriage an alarm’

clock, so don’t wake up!

LEVY.

Seven come eleven. Bones just like his fadder.

ALBERT C. LUCAS, Greensburg, Pa.
Greensburg High School.

He is not lazy, but he does not like to work.
That is A1bert’s version of it. It seems to work,
for you ought to see him work in the pharmacy lab.
You would then see a ﬁne soldier. He is a standing
soldier, i.e., always on the lookout for Dr. Blun1en-
schein or Dr. Saalsbach so they don’t catch him sol-
diering. v

ROSS ALLEN STARR MCGINN, Greensburg, Pa.
Greensburg High School.

“Hitch your wagon to a Star(r)” is a very good
quotation, but as Ross is an erratic Starr we would
advise no one to hitch their wagon to such a star.
Don’t judge him by his sartorial style for he is a
pretty good sort. Known for his propensity for
asking questions. Question No. I, I wonder who’s
kissing her now!

223

 

ALBERT WILLIAM MEHRING, Harrisburg, Pa.

Albert lives in Harrisburg. It is enough. We
believe that if he continues to dwell there he will be-
come imbued with the same spirit that prevails
about the magniﬁcent pile that was put over on the
people. He used to be a V\7est Virginia Snake but
now he’s 3. Keystone boy‘.

CLARENCE CHARLES CYRIL MESSIER,
Glassport, Pa.

Glassport High School.

Weighed down with so many names that it will
be a tough matter for him to drag them through
life. Better drop Cyril at least, otherwise you may
become known as “Si,” which may in time evolve
to Sis, a very ﬁtting John Henry for a quiet, lady-
like boy.

RALPH MYERS METZ, ‘I>AX, Aspinwall, Pa.
Etna High School.
A little runt, but full of the old Nick.

WILLIAM J. MORELAND, Pittsburgh, Pa.
Osceola High School.

The popular cry of a ship—wrecked sailor is More-
land. This chap is a hard proposition as he sleeps
quite often on an iron bed. The question as to
where the iron bed is may arise in your mind, but
don’t ask such embarassing questions of William.

JOHN MICHAEL MOROZ, Osceola Mills, Ohio.

VVhi1e it is no fault of Mike's, he hails from Osce-
ola Mills, which is a good place to come from but
an awful place to go to. How do we know? Sh,
Sh; there were some girls living there once. When
Mike toots his horn it is usually in quiz class: “Is
that precise, Doctor?”

224

 

PAUL O. NUTT, B-‘PE, Youngstown, Ohio.
Rayen High School.

P. Nutt (peanut) is often classed as a nut, but on
better acquaintance with him we found him to be a
nephew to his Uncle Frank Jolley. Frank came
from the farm about a year. Already a decided
change has come in his appearance; in fact he now
looks almost human.

JOHN JAMES O’DONNELL, Pittsburgh, Pa.
Carnegie Technical Schools.

We think that nature was very cruel to Ody as he
is a triﬂe less than four feet high. \Ve, therefore,
think that Ody should keep quiet while grown-up
people talk.

EDWIN JAMES OILLIG, <I>AX, Altoona, Pa., Q. A.
Altoona High School.

Oillig should have been called “Oily James” as he
sure is some slippery eel when it comes to sliding
out of some difficult situation.

FRANCIS JOSEPH OWENS, Tarentum, Pa.
Bishop Areckland Grammar School, England.

“Joseph returned out of Egypt” but not this Jo-
seph, for he is one of those ‘bloody bloomin’ Hing-
lishmen. There is one letter that Joseph always
puts in the wrong place and that is H. He takes
it oﬁ ’erb and puts it on h’ ear. An utterly hopeless
case of H5 but a loyal subject of King George V.

JOHN DIXON PATTON, B‘I>2, Waynesburg, Pa.

Mt. Pleasant Institute.
Waynesburg College.

In what Geography have we seen that map before?
It must have been Bill Nye's latest edition. John
is one of the best lines we have in school; knows
his lines in Billy Bounce.

KARL JENNNINGS HOLLIDAY, AA,
Butler, Pa.

Butler High School.

Student Assistant in Cl1emist1'y(2) (3) (4).
Student Athletic Representative (3).
(ml Board 1912.

Class Football (2).

A good man but not appreciated. Some-
what of a ladies’ man and an expert dod-
ger behind the chemistry tables. How
about that time you hid under one, Karl?

HENRY TITUS KOENIG,
Springdale, Pa.

Tareutum High School.
Class Treasurer (4).

Henry does not talk very often, nor
very loud, but when he does open his trap
he certainly spills a picturesque line of con—_
versation. VVatch—dog of the 1912 treasury.

WILLIAM ZELLERS LUTHER,
Wilkinsburg, Pa.

Williinsburg High School.

Cap and Gown Club (2) (3) (4).
Mandolin Club (4).

Student Senate (4).

President Willciiisburg-Pitt Club (4).
Treasurer Y. M. C. A. (3) (4).

You gotta hand it to Jeff. He’s every
inch a man in spite of the fact that he had
to have a tuck put in his gown the day of
the academic procession last February. An
earnest advocate of the recall of faculty
members.

HOWARD STEPHEN MILLER, «I>Z<I>,
Freedom, Pa.
I

Beaver High School.

Science Club.

Student Assistant in Biology (3).
Student Assistant in Bacteriology (4).

“Baldy” was wise in choosing the med-
ical profession. When everything else
fails the professional appearance of that
barren dome will insure him success. At
present he is employed in taking care of
Fett’s educated germs.

EDGAR CHARLES NIEBAUM,
Pittsburgh, Pa.

East Liberty Academy.
Pittsburgh Academy.

V\/hen “Inquisitive Edgar” starts out by
shouting, “Say, Professor!” look out for
foolish question No. 2,167,458. There is a
subtle vein of humor running through his
conversation which is appreciated only by
himself.

FRED. W. PADGETT, <I>K\I',
Fort Scott, Kan.

Fort Scott High School.
University of Kansas.

\Ve are naturally suspicious of anything,
or anybody that comes out of the state that
turned Carrie Nation loose on us, but Padv
gett seems to be a pretty good sort in spite
of his previous lrabitat.

WILLIAM PARKER PHILLIPS, Finleyville, Pa.
1-‘inleyville High School.

Quick, \/\''alter. the needle! Curses-sll etc. Bill
is some chicken fancier, not of the farm type, though.

CHARLES P. POWERS, Proctor, Vt.
1’1'octoi' Prep School.

The Class musician and gallant. Comes "to the
rescue at our Pharmacy dances when the pianist be-
comes incapacitated. Give us the latest rag, Charles.

PAUL C. ROBINSON, ATS), <I>A.\', Monongahela, Pa.

 

Kiski Springs School.
Washington and Jefferson College.

“Robby” is a ﬁrm believer in doing the Rip Val.
\/Vinkle stunt during lectures. One would think that
from his preliminary education he could afford to
do so, but we who know him know that all “Robby"
knows he could write on the back of a postage
stamp with a shaving brush.

WILLIAM HUDSON RUSHTON, Pittsburgh, Pa.
McKe-esport High School.

His love is like the roaring, rushing torrent: it
can’t be drained. Neither can he when he starts to
spout. Bill, old boy, you have a famous middle
handle. How did you come by it? Legitimately or
otherwise? He is always baying, can't keep still.

P. SCHAD, Emsworth, Pa.

St. Vincent's College.
St. Mary’s Institute.
Carnegie Technical Scliools.

Here is a boy with the master brain for a shad. A
great fellow to have around in case of morphine
poisoning. He has a new method which is beyond
all doubt unique. It is—Oh well, ask him about it.

WILLIAM OGDEN SHAFFER, B<i>E,
Vintondale, Pa.

Indiana. State No1'111al School.

Ogden is always ducking out of sight when he
ﬁnds one of the profs coming his way. Not be-
cause he is afraid of them, but ——.

FRANK HARRY SHONTZ, <I>X, Huntingdon, Pa.
Jnniata (‘olll-gv.
Shontz is the Beau Brunnnel of our department,

i. e.. he just thinks he is. But you know that pride
always comes before a fall.

‘WARD MITCHELL SMITH, ‘FAX,
New Castle, Pa.

New Castle High School.
Doesn’t tell all he knows. In spite of his name he
is an uncommonly good fellow. Good, yes, good for

nothing. He is always building New Castle(s) iii
the air. Going to be a great Man. Yes?

THOMAS JOSEPH SZYKOWNY, Pittsburgh, Pa.

Better results would be obtained if “Tom” attend-
ed to his own affairs.

ELMER F. TARR, Unity, Pa.
Verona High School.
Tar is soluble. That much we have discovered in
the lab. But this Tarr is insoluble. Tarr has discov-

ered a new mixture which will probably enter the
V. S. P. some day, brown mixture and Tar.

RALPH DUNCAN TEA, <I>AX, Pittsburgh, Pa.

Pittsburgh High School.
Carnegie Technical Schools.

Q Tea-hee-hee-hee. Do you know who Tea is? Tea
is an infusion. If you don’t know it don’t look at
the book; ask me!!

227

 

GEBHARD B. WAGNER, B‘I>E, Butler, Pa.
Butler High School.

Commonly known as “Get.” Threatened to quit
but is still sticking around. Desperately in love
with his sister. Lives on air; never known to eat
with the bunch. “Mrs. O’Brien” is another of his
aliases.

ALFRED CAIRNS WALKER, B‘I>Z', Sewickley, Pa.
Pittsburgh Academy.
Sewickley High School.
Carnegie Technical Schools.
Takes things like a phi1osopl1er—as they come.
Sensible chap, we envy you!

CHARLES ELMER WALLEY, B<I>2,
Mifﬂintown, Pa.

VVally, Wally, Wash! He is not a Chinaman as
has name might lead one to believe. He can make
a violin talk, though. 0. Bull is not in it with this fel-
low. let us put you wise to that fact. Bull would
not recognize his playing because Wally plays just
like a chicken walks.

HARRY G. WILSON, B<I>E, Cross Fork, Pa.
High School.

The man that comes from the place where they
sleep under the snow. Harry very much resembles
the place whence he comes as he is very hard to ﬁnd.

WALTER FERDINAND WRIGHT,
Monongahela, Pa.

Monongahela High School.

Walter is Wright; W-right or wrong, he is never-
theless VVright. He hails from Monongahela. Pray,
tell us where is that crystal city, Walt? Is it in
U. S. or Jericho? Being in some doubt, won’t you
set it right Wright?

bration of her One Hundred and Twenty-ﬁfth Anniversary, A. R.
Hamilton, of the Class of ’94, said that the University had been in
a state of “academic somnambulism” for the ﬁrst hundred years
of her existence, and that the great strides in advancement were
the products of recent years. This may be well applied to athletics, as they,
too, seemed under the inﬂuence of a powerful narcotic. At last, however, the

sleeping lion has awakened, and with the passing of time is gaining strength day
by day.

Athletics at the University are on a ﬁrm ﬁnancial basis with a strong man-
agement, and under the supervision of a General Athletic Committee composed
of representatives from the Faculty, Board of Trustees, Alumni and Under-
graduate bodies. The Eligibility Committee has complete charge of all mat-
ters pertaining to the eligibility of Pitt's athletic representatives, and the rules

are enforced so rigidly that her athletics are as clean as those of any other
institution in the country.

In writing of the wonderful advancement of Athletics in the University,
it is well to mention some of the men who have been instrumental in the
more, although many must be omitted for lack of space. Joseph C. Trees, ’93,
donor of Trees’ Stadium and Gymnasium, A. R. Hamilton, ’93, a ﬁgure in
every athletic event of the University, C. VV. Friend, ’94, Dr. Walther Riddle, ’92,
Burt Smyers, ’93, C. W. Ridinger, ’93, Floyd Rose, ’96, Dr. A. F. Judd, ’95,
Laurence B. Hurst, ’o2, and a host of others, are backing Pittsburgh in ath-

letics, and with such men as these behind her teams Pitt cannot help but come
out on top.

Pitt is now well represented on the football ﬁeld, track, basketball ﬂoor and
court, while the prospects for baseball and fencing teams are bright. The ap-
pointment of Charles S. Miller to the ofﬁce of Athletic Director was a step in
advance as it puts a capable man in charge of the gymnasium and takes part
of the burden from the shoulders of the Graduate Manager and Coaches.

TREES STADIUM AND GYMNASIUM

FOOTBALL

\\'hile no such record was made in the fall of 1911 as had been piled up
the season before by Pitt’s Championship Football aggregation, the Varsity
played consistent, hard ball, and deserved, perhaps, more than the victories
they won. \\'hen writing a resume of the season, several considerations be—
sides the ever important one of victories 1nust be considered. The ﬁnancial

side of last season was a great success, as the gate receipts showed a total of _

nearly $40,000. which, in itself, is enough to prove the season a success.

The schedule arranged by Graduate Manager Laurence B. llurst included
games with Cornell, the Carlisle Indian team, Penn State, W’. & ]., Notre Dame,
and several others of minor importance, and proved to be the best card ever
arranged for a Pitt team. Manager Hurst also kept the expenses down to
such an extent that over $5,000 showed on the good side of the ledger at the
close of the season, and much praise was heard from all sides on the way the
managerial reins were handled. The schedule for 1912, as announced by the
Graduate Manager, includes games with Navy, the Indians, Penn State, Notre
Dame, \V. & ]., Bucknell, Ohio Northern and \\'estminster.

Under the guidance of Coach Jos. H. Thompson and Capt. “Jack” Lindsay,
the candidates began practice on September 10, at Schenley oval, a11d worked
daily there until the first game, which was held on Forbes Field. Coach Thomp-

Z?-1

 

son had lost “Tex” Richards, Peacock, Dallenbach, Bailey, Budd, Hittner an(l
several others from his championship lineup of the year before, l)ut began in
his usual energetic manner to develop material for the great gaps in the
li11e and backﬁeld. The task he had before him was a stupendous one, as the
material at hand did not look very promising at ﬁrst, and it was fully mid-
season before the team developed the unity of attack that was the winning
factor of the previous season. Early in the year the patched—up Varsity showed
a ﬂash of the splendid defensive strength they were destined to exhibit in their
later games, but the offense lacked strength throughout the season.

Coach Thompson shifted “Hube” \7\/agner from end to fullback for the
ﬁrst few games, but soon found that the big Monaca boy lacked backﬁeld
calibre, so placed him back on end where he played a splendid game during the
rest of the season. Ross Feightner was then tried at fullback, but lacked the
speed and alertness necessary for that position, so was again put at tackle.
“Chuck” Soles and Kernohan were used at full during the remainder of the
season and did well, considering their inexperience. George Brown played a
great game at left halfback in every contest, and has proven that he is one of
the greatest defensive players ever developed at Pitt. “Raz” Quailey played the
other half, but was unfortunate in receiving injuries in several games which
slowed him down to a great extent. Kernohan and Dillon played at least a
part of every game in the backﬁeld, and as Kernohan has three and Dillon
two more years of football, much may be expected of these men in the future.

“Tillie” Dewar held down the pivotal position and put up a good game all
year, particularly in the State game, where he starred until a dislocated knee
forced his retirement. His loss by graduation will be a severe one, but Con-
nelly, who played sub quarter in most of the games, will prove a valuable man
next year, as he possesses every quality of a football player excepting, perhaps,
the weight.

Capt. “jack” Lindsay, “Hube” V\r’agner and Perry Graves played at the
wings, and all put up a sterling game. i Capt. Lindsay received a badly sprained
ankle in the Cornell game which kept him out of several big games, and allowed
him to play but one half of the State game. He will be lost by graduation, and
the 1912 Varsity will feel his loss keenly, as he is a good tackler, handles the
forward pass well and has had four years’ football experience at Pitt. With
Huber Wagner and Perry Graves on the ﬁeld next year, however, Pitt will be
well fortiﬁed at the ends.

Jim Stevenson, Ross Feightner, “Auggie” Blair an(l George Gehlert held
down the tackles in most of the games, and the diﬁiculties experienced by Pitt’s
opponents in gaining through the line shows the value of these men. Steven-
son graduates in June from the Medical School, and his many athletic friends
will miss him greatly next fall, as he has successfully borne the brunt of the
attack for several seasons and has opened up holes in the opposing line through
which Pitt backs have made many gains. “Auggie” Blair has withstood many
battering line plunges, but he lost heart when one Dan Cupid hit his tackle
for a touchdown, and will be lost to the Gold and Blue squad next year.
Feightner played a sensational game all the year, breaking up many plays be-
fore they were well started and stopped line bucks short. He will be in har-
ness again next year when the call of football is sounded. Gehlert will make a
valuable lineman, as he possesses weight, nerve and experience.

Leahy, Smith and Blair held dow11 the guards. The former has another
year of football, while Smith has three left. Smith is a Bellefonte Academy
boy, and won a Varsity position in the first game. Last, but not least in size
and importance, is Pitt’s great center and Captain—elect, “Polly” Galvin. For
three years “Polly” has been the “Pride of Pitt,” and the greatest stumbling
block to her opponents on the gridiron. He possesses remarkable size and
weight, which, coupled with speed and nerve, makes him an exceptionally good
football player. Galvin will make a splendid captain, as he is popular with his
fellow players and knows how to manage them in practice and in the games.

The change in the football rules should prove an advantage rather than a
detriment to Pitt. The reason for this is that Coach “Joe” Thompson is quick
to grasp the possibilities of a new code of rules and will probably build up a
great scoring machine, such as he did under the new rules of 1910. Pittsburgh
is extremely fortunate in having such a man as Thompson to instruct her foot-
ball players, as he is undoubtedly one of the best men in the country for this
position. “Joe” has recently entered politics, and it is hoped that his new work
will not cause him to resign his position as Coach. He was ably assisted by
Coaches Floyd Rose and Alex. Stevenson, and much of the Varsity’s success
was due to the untiring efforts of these men.

Many alumni and former players helped coach the team before the State
game, and their assistance was valuable to the Coaches. The dinner after the

237

 

W’. ’& J. game, and the banquet tendered the squad after the State game by
A. R. llamilton was much appreciated and did much to encourage the fellows
in times of Victory and defeat.

PITT-WESTMINSTER GAME

The llrst game of the season was played at Forbes Field with Westminster
College. The Gold and Blue players were not in the best of shape for the
game, as the team work was not well developed and the physicial condition of
the men was not the best. The men played a hard game and had little trouble
in winning the contest 23-0. There was plenty of excitement toward the last
of the game, as a free—for—all ﬁght took place in which the players of both teams
took part, and also officials, coaches, et al. The papers made a big thing out

of the incident, which was really a “comedy of errors,” and little blame is due
either \Vestminster, Pitt, or the ofﬁcials. The most notable feature of the con-
test was that it is the ﬁrst opening game in Pitt’s history where the gate re-
ceipts have been greater than the expenses. \Vagner, Quailey and Feightner
starred in this game, while \\7ilson and Ashe did well for the visitors.

PITT-OHIO NORTHERN GAME

The next game found the Varsity lined up against the University team
from Ada, Ohio, and the Gold and Blue kickers had little trouble in winning
out 22-0. The game was ragged on both sides, and the work of the Pitt team
did not look very promising, as the Indians were scheduled for the following
Saturday.

\rVagner, Lindsay and Dewar used the forward pass with telling eﬁect, and
two of the four touchdowns were directly responsible to this formation.

Smith, of the visiting team, put up a great game at quarter and narrowly
missed a ﬁeld goal early in the contest. This victory gave Pitt a total of eleven
consecutive shutouts, the total score being: Pitt 327, Opponents o.

PITT-CARLISLE GAME

The twenty-ﬁrst of October found the strong Indian team at Forbes Field.
This team was composed of seasoned material, was in splendid physical condi-
tion, and already had four scalps hanging to its belt. The game was replete
with surprises—ﬁrst and greatest of these was that the ﬁeld was in perfect con-
dition and the weather ideal for the contest. The Indians have always brought
bad weather with them, and every game found the teams battling on a mud or
snow—covered gridiron. In 1909, Pitt had come to the front and won 14-3, and
dope pointed to at least a close game in 1911, and while the score does not
show it, this was the case.

Captains Lindsay and Burd grasped hands in the centre of the ﬁeld, a coin
ﬂashed in the air, the Indians won and decided to kickoff. The Pitt men scat-
tered over the grid, and the Indians lined up tense and straining across the-
centre of the ﬁeld.

Thorpe kicked the ball which sailed lazily, slowly revolving into the wait-
ing arms of Quailey. \Vagner hurled a forward pass to Lindsay for a twenty

yard gain, and a mighty shout went up from the Gold and Blue stands. Quailey
and Dewar failed to gain, so Wagner kicked to Thorpe who was stopped short.

Powell and \Vheelock gained ten yards on line bucks, and a successful for-
ward pass put the ball on Pitt’s 12 yard line. “Hold ’em, Pittsburgh!” en-
treated the stands, and the players, bracing under a volume of cheers from
thousands of throats, held for downs, a stonewall defense stopping Powell,
Burd and Newashe successively.

Thorpe made a fair catch of Galvin’s punt but failed at a ﬁeld goal, and
Pitt worked the ball down to the Indians’ 20 yard line by several returns of punts,
good tackling and a succession of short gains. Here Galvin attempted a ﬁeld
goal, but failed. The teams see—sawed up and down the ﬁeld, and the quarter
ended 0-0, with the ball on Pitt’s 18 yard line in the possession of the Redskins.

The Indians made a ﬁrst down on three plays, and the Gold and Blue, ﬁght-
ing doggedly under the shadow of their goal posts, stopped the advance of the

Aborigines, and again the Red and Yellow team gave up the ball when victory
was close. . Galvin’s'punt‘ was caught by Thorpe, who was dropped in his tracks,
but the next play brought despair into the hearts of the Pitt adherents. Thorpe
tried an onside kick which worked successfully, as Wheelock gathered it in
and raced over the line for a touchdown and Thorpe kicked goal. Score, In-
dians 6-—Pitt 0.

Pitt had the better of the argument during the remainder of the half, but
two ﬁfteen yard penalties kept the Indians’ goal out of danger. The half ended

with the ball in the centre of the ﬁeld and the score still 6-0 in favor of the
Indians.

The second half found Connelly at quarter, Dillon at half and Graves at
end. Dillon returned the kickoff to the 25 yard mark and Wagner kicked to
Arcasa in midﬁeld. The Indians tried an onside kick, but Dillon captured the
ball for Pitt. VVagner kicked the ball into the Indians’ territory. Thorpe re-
turned the kick to Connelly on Pitt’s 30 yard line. Pitt made ﬁrst down and
then kicked to the Indians’ 45 yard line. Thorpe was thrown for a loss and

VVheelock made 5 yards. W'ith the ball in the centre of the ﬁeld, Thorpe tried
an onside kick, which he recovered, and deep gloom settled on the Pitt stands.
Score, Indians II-—Pitt O.

The Indians took the kickoff but could not gain and punted to Dillon on
midﬁeld. V\/agner threw a forward pass to Graves for a ten yard gain, and
duplicated the play with Dillon for 8 more. The quarter ended here with the
ball in Pitt’s possession on the Indians’ 35 yard line. Connelly opened the quar-
ter by gaining three yards, and \Vagner made six more, Dillon made two, and
Wagner added ten more. On a fake placement, Wagner threw the ball to
Lindsay for a fourteen yard gain, placing the ball but seven yards from the Red-
skins’ goal. The Pitt stands were i11 an uproar as a touchdown seemed immi-
nent, and victory, perhaps, beyond, but they were doomed to disappointment, as
the Indians held for two downs and a forward pass crossed their line, which
gave the Indians the ball on their own twenty—ﬁve yard line.

The Indians got possession of the ball on their 50 yard line and got half‘
the distance‘ to the Pitt goal line when Galvin was disqualiﬁed for bumping
Welch. Powell, Wheelock, and Newashe added another touchdown, and the
game ended with the Indians as victors 17-0.

PITT-CORNELL GAME

On the Thursday afternoon following the bitter defeat handed the Varsity
by the Indians, the students showed their loyalty by turning out to a man to
give the team a great sendoff when they left to play Cornell. Led by the Stu-
dent Band, the parade, two squares in length and with six men marching abreast,
wended its way through town and across the Smithﬁeld Street bridge to the
P. & L. E. depot. Cheerleader Kirk frequently-halted the throng and snappy
cheers reverbrated between the skyscrapers at his bidding. V\/hen the depot was
reached, a cheer was given every member of the squad and as the train pulled
out for the town on Lake Cayuga, a mighty “Alle-ghenee” burst from the fol-
lowers of the Gold and Blue.

Graduate Manager Hurst had arranged for private Pullman cars for the‘

entire trip and had secured accommodations for Thursday night in Buffalo at
Hotel Statler. Every item of the trip had been worked out by Manager Hurst
before starting, and a great deal of praise was tendered him for his perfect ar-

rangements. The team left early Friday morning for Ithaca over the Lehigh

Valley and arrived at noon. V

244

 

The trip from the depot in Ithaca to the Rogues Harbor Country Club,
which is about eight miles out in the country from Ithaca, was made by electric
cars, and the party arrived in plenty of time for lunch. Late in the afternoon
a fast signal practice was held, even though sleet was falling most of the time.
The party was made up of twenty—one members of the team, Capt. Lindsay,
Graduate Manager Hurst, Coaches Thompson and Stevenson, Dr. Wymard, the
team physician, Mr. A. R. Hamilton and his son Paul, Dr. Judd, Dr. McParland,
Karl E. Davis, the University press agent, Cheerleader Geo. Kirk, Chalmers Hall,

Clyde Hazlett, Trainer Jack Adams, and others. Among the students who at—;

tended the game to uphold the honor of the Gold and Blue were, George, Frost,

Johnson, Bannister, Stambaugh, Ralph Smith, Camp, Follansbee, Collins, Leitch,
Conrad and Lauro.

Saturday dawned clear and cold——a perfect day for the game. The teams
trotted on the ﬁeld at 2:45 and at 3. Pitt took Cornell’s kickoff. Wagner was
hurt on the very ﬁrst lineup and Quailey took his place. Pitt made a couple
of short gains and then punted. Cornell returned the kick on the ﬁrst scrim-
mage and Pitt had the ball on her own 20 yard line. Quailey took Dewar’s
forward pass for a 30 yard gain, which placed the ball in midﬁeld, but on the
next down fumbled and the ball went to Cornell. They immediately punted,
and the ball, taking a crazy bound, eluded the usually alert “Dewar. Eyrick,
the left end of the Big Red team, gathered up the ball and sprinted over the
goal line for a touchdown. \Vithin a few minutes after the second quarter
opened, Galvin booted the ball squarely over the cross-bar and the score stood

Cornell 6, Pittsburgh 3, but Eyrick duplicated the feat and three points were
added to C0rnell’s score.

The Pitt delegation were not discouraged at this time and fully expected
victory later in the game as the Varsity was not playing near the game they
were capable of and the second half was expected to change Pitt’s score. Pitt
had a splendid chance to score in the second quarter when Quailey recovered
Ga1vin’s kick on Cornell’s 25 yard line. By the hardest kind of football, Feight—

ner, Dewar and Brown carried the pigskin to the six yard line. At this point’

the Cornell team braced and held for two downs, so Dewar tried a fake place-
ment which failed, as McCormick caught his forward pass and O’Conner kicked
the ball out of danger. In the third quarter Pitt had another splendid oppor-
tunity to score but failed. O’Conner tried a ﬁeld goal which was blocked by
Capt. Lindsay, Jim Stevenson picked up the ball, and with a clean ﬁeld started

toward the Cornell uprights. After gaining 40 yards, however, he was tackled
from behind by Eyrick and Pitt’s chance was lost.

Galvin outkicked his opponent but Cornell was superior in running back
kicks, which was due to the blocking of the halfbacks and to the good interfer-
ence given the runner. Eyrick put up the best game for Cornell, and proved
himself a fast, heady end. Capt. Lindsay and “Polly” Galvin did the best work
for Pitt.

This game was the most unsatisfactory one of the season, as the Gold and
Blue players received very poor treatment at the hands of their Ithacan hosts,
and the uncalled for taunts and hoots heard from the bleachers gave the Pitts-
burgh adherents a very poor opinion of Cornell spirit. The defeat was a bitter
pill to take, but Pittsburgh could have swallowed it with a smile if their oppo-
nents had acted in a sportsmanlike manner.

PITT-NOTRE DAME GAME

In one of the hardest contests ever seen on Forbes Field, Pitt and Notre
Dame battled to a scoreless tie on the Saturday following the Cornell game.
While both teams were right on edge and each seemed determined to win the
game, no rough playing marred the contest. Savage tackling, fast end runs

and hard line plunging was the order of the day, but despite these conditions,
the bitterest of enemies left the ﬁeld the best of friends, each having a Whole-
some respect for the prowess of his opponent.

There is no gainsaying the fact that Pitt should have won——tl1e ball was
never within striking distance of Pitt’s goal line, while the Gold and Blue rushes
were a constant menace to the Notre Dame line. Pitt’s ﬁrst chance to register
came when Eichenlaub’s kick was blocked and recovered by Pitt on Notre
Dame’s 15 yard line. The ball was carried a few yards, but on the second down
the opponents recovered a fumble and punted the ball out of danger. VVith the
ball on Notre Dame’s 40 yard line, the Pitt backs started a steady advance to-
ward the goal line only to be stopped with a few feet between a tie and victory.
Quailey made 5 yards at right end, Dewar added 10 more through the line,
Soles added 2 more through the same hole. On a forward pass from Dewar,
Quailey carried the ball to the 5 yard line, and Soles added 4 through the line.
Three scant feet and victory! A tense silence settled over the cheering section,
Dewar stooped behind Galvin’s massive form chanting signals, the crouching
backs sliced into the line——but no ball was forthcoming. From the grinding
mass of players came the cry, “Ball, Ball!” and Notre Dame’s goal line was
again saved. A few minutes later the ball rose in lazy circles heavenward from
Eichenlaub’s toe, and Pitts’s chances for victory went glimmering. Two ﬁeld
goals were tried later in the contest but Galvin “couldn’t make ’en1 be good.”

Stevenson played his great opponent, Philbrook, to a standstill. and shared
honors for the best playing with Ross Feightner, who played a splendid game.
Smith and Wagner also did well, the latter’s tackling being of the sensational
order. Philbrook, Berger, Rockner and Kelliher did the best work for Notre
Dame. ‘

PITT-VILLA NOVA GAME

The contest with Villa Nova can scarcely be called a game, as “mud battle”
would more nearly ﬁt it. Forbes Field was in pretty bad shape before the game
started, but just as Galvin kicked off, a shower of rain fell, which turned into
a torrent before many minutes had elapsed. The ﬁeld became a veritable quag-
mire, and before the contest was over the gridiron resembled the bed of a re-
cently drained lake. The result of the game was never in doubt, as Pitt out-

played her plucky visitors and showed superiority in every department of the
game.

248

DEVVAR CARRYING BALL—VlLLA NOVA-GAME

Early in the contest Kernohan carried the ball from the 40 to the 20 yard
mark on two tries, and Connelly splashed over for the first count. In eluding
a tackler, however, he received a sprained ankle, and Dewar took his place.

Dewar took the kickoff and pulled off a brilliant run of 60 yards before
Crowe of the visitors stopped him. This proved to be the longest run of the
season on Forbes Field, the next in length being a 50 yard run by Thorpe.

The second score came as the result of a blocked kick. “Auggie” Blair
stopped the ball and Graves raced over the line. Pitt settled down to a defen-
sive game, being content to hold the Visitors even.

PITT-W. & J. GAME

Pitt’s oldest rival, her band and her color-bedecked goat, arrived at Forbes
Field Saturday, November 18, and on the same evening they departed for Wash-
ington defeated and weary, but not beaten. The band was still on hand but the
music was not in evidence, the goat too was there but his challenging “Ba—a-a”

249

 

of a few hours before had become the plaintive wail of the conquered. Poor
Bill! He was not actually in the hands of the Pitt revelers, but still as VV. & ].’s
jinx, he was in the camp of the enemy.

The fact that Forbes Field was again buried under a heavy layer of mud
did not detract a whit from the immense interest of local football fandom in
the game, as a monster crowd attended the contest. Many fair maids gave
color to thee scene by wearing huge gold chrysanthemums, and an almost equal
number were dressed in the Red and Black of the Washington College. Long
before the whistle blew the rival bands tuned up, and snappy cheers issued
from the rival stands.

Pitt certainly earned a victory as the Gold and Blue players rushed the
ball 98 yards to 16 gained by VV. & ]., who failed to negotiate a single ﬁrst
down. The Red and Black team had but one chance to score, but McClure
dropped a forward pass and all was off.

In the ﬁrst period Pitt did not have a chance to score, and neither team
was able to make consistent gains, but in the second period W. & ].’s goal line
was in danger most of the time. Early in this quarter Galvin blocked a kick
Feightner recovering for Pitt on W. & J.’s 11 yard line. Brown made 5 yards
and Dewar carried the ball to the 3 yard line. Dewar made it ﬁrst down on
the I yard mark, but on the next play Pitt held and was penalized I 5 yards.
Dewar, on a fake kick, wriggled his way to the 5 yard line, and on the next
play Pitt was penalized 10 yards. VV. & J. got possession of the ball on account
of these penalties and punted. Galvin ran the ball back to the 14 yard line.
Soles made 3 yards, but was disqualiﬁed for slugging, and Pitt drew another
45 yard penalty. Pitt carried the ball to her opponent’s 30 yard line, but time
was up for the ﬁrst half.

At the start of the fourth period, Pitt carried the ball from her own 35 yard
line to VV. & J.’s 25 yard line, but lost on a fumble. W. & J. punted, Dewar
being downed in his tracks. Pitt tried an onside kick which Kernohan recov-
ered and ran over the line, but the ball was called back as it had not gone the
required 2o yards. The rest of the period was taken up in kicking, and neither
team was able to get within striking distance of the goal.

At the start of the third quarter, Pitt recovered a fumbled punt on
VV. & ].’s 2 yard line. Dewar took the ball to the 1 foot mark and then fol-
lowed plunges by Brown, Dewar and Quailey, none of whom were able to gain

the required 12 inches. On each play, however, the Red and Black players were
offside, so Pitt got an extra try and Dewar was at last able to score. Galvin
kicked goal. Score, Pitt 6, VV. &  O. Pitt took the kickoff and marched
straight down the ﬁeld for another touchdown, the brunt of the work being
done by Brown and Dewar. Pitt again started for the Red and Black goal, and
when the whistle blew had the ball on their rival’s 8 yard line.

PITT-STATE GAME

The twelve days between the W’. & J. game and Thanksgiving Day was a
period of the hardest kind of work for the Gold and Blue squad. Coach
Thompson pushed the men through strenuous scrimmages and signal practice

from 3 o’clock till dark, and his assistants, Floyd Rose and Alex. Stevenson,
were always found on the muddy ﬁeld urging the players to their best efforts.
Ex-Capt. “Tex” Richards donned football togs and played on the scrub team,

and Karl Dallenbach, a star of the Championship 1910 team came down from
Ithaca, N.Y., to give his aid in bolstering up the team for their crucial test.
“Doc” Van Doren, “Bill” Budd, and several other Gold and Blue graduates
were also at the Field assisting Coach Thompson.

The gridiron, which had never fully dried from the rains before the
Notre Dame, Villa Nova and VV. & J". games, was again subjected to several
hard rains and snow, which put the players under a severe handicap. Day after
day the squad splashed over the sodden ﬁeld, following the heavy, slippery ball
in signal practice, never complaining nor asking for time to warm numbed ﬁn-
gers or dry their soaking togs, but content to labor for the game with Pitt’s
bitterest foe on Turkey day.

The day before the game found the Field in better shape than it had been
for several weeks, but still wet and slow in spots and as a cold snap was pre-
dicted for that night, Graduate Manager Hurst ordered six tons of straw to be
scattered over the ﬁeld to protect the ground from freezing. The men labored

253

GRAVES TACKLING QUAILEY IN PRACTICE

 

under the rays of many electric arcs until far into the night to put the Field
in condition for the following day.

Thanksgiving dawned clear and cold, with a stiff west wind scattering the
straw on the white lined ﬁeld. Hours before the game started a large crowd
of fans collected in front of the gates to get the ﬁrst choice of seats in the
bleachers, and long lines extended in snake—like twistings from the reserved seat
boxes to Forbes Street. A hum of excitement was in the air, shufﬂing of many
feet, cries of the color venders, the grind and clanging of the street cars un-'
loading their heavy human loads, and other noises which one always hears be-
fore a great football game ﬁlled the ears. Inside the monster Field, the rival
bands were tuning up, the seats were rapidly ﬁlling and the cheerleaders called
for an occasional cheer. Suddenly a great volume of sound reverberated
through the air as a squad of players wearing the Gold and Blue of Pitt ap-
peared on the ﬁeld, and a few minutes later the State followers cheered loudly
as the Blue and White players trotted out for a warming up.

Capt. Very, of State, won the toss, and decided to defend the west goal and
receive the kickoff. Pitt received a bad start which characterized all her big
games during the season of 1911, as Galvin, for the ﬁrst time in his career, got
off a bad kick. The ball was brought back, and on his second try the ball
traveled to State’s I 5 yard line, where Miller caught it. Mauthe punted and
Dewar fumbled, State recovering the ball. A few minutes later Mauthe kicked
the ﬁeld goal that ended the game as far as scoring was concerned. In the
second quarter, Brown and Dewar carried the ball to State’s I 5 yard line and
Capt. Lindsay tried a ﬁeld goal which failed. A forward pass, Dewar to Lind-
say, put the ball on State’s 8 yard line and again Lindsay tried to boot it over
the bar, but again was doomed to failure. Brown and Dewar took the ball
within striking distance, but the latter was badly injured and again the Pitt
stands were disappointed when Galvin missed a placement kick. The greatest
play of all was pulled off by Wagner in the third quarter; State had the ball
on Pitt’s 30 yard line, the result of a kick rolling out of bounds, when Miller
essayed a forward pass. “Hube” was waiting for that very play it seems, and
gobbled up the ball; the next instant he was sprinting toward the State goal,
right along the side lines, and Miller, the State quarter, was running a little
ahead of the Pitt player and off to one side. He edged slowly toward Wagner
and at the State 30 yard line threw himself into the Pitt runner and pushed him

ANY summers ago, W’. U. P. left that jumpin’-off place on Nunnery
Hill and found a new hang-out on the farm, at the University of
Pittsburgh. The class of 1913, though nothing but a huge bunch
of denseness and cabbage leaves, had gray stuff enough to be the
ﬁrst class to begin life over again on the Farm.

In those days the Fresh knew about as much about the farm as the other
tribes, hence very little rough stuff could be pulled off on them. The formal
reception, given by the class of 1912, took place on Gobbler’s Knob. The re-
ceiving line consisted of the Sophs clustered gracefully about a pole, at the top
of which were the decorations in burlap and grease. The guests enjoyed the
affair. but no porch climber could have reached the 1912 bunting. In revenge
the Fresh beat the Sophs in football, in debating, in electing the cheerleader, etc.

Chief Bradburn reigned for two years, and as Sophs he led the class to
victory over the tribe of ’I4. Meanwhile many of the class fell by the wayside.
Some fell for other schools after the exams; others fell for Economics; still
others fell for the little red woodshed. Among the latter were some of our
most adorable (that’s far enough, Steve) including “Queenie”. Several others
joined the class of 1912. They showed poor taste.

Besides giving hard cider and pretzel feeds, banquets and shirt parades in
hotel foyers, the class of 1915 College has helped in this OWL. May Go(l be
with them when we meet again.

 

 

 

over the sideline. It was merely a question of a few inches and Pitt would
haveﬁwell, what's the use anyway?

The Pitt defense played a remarkable game, holding State for downs on
the three yard line and again on the one foot line and showed wonderful recup-
erative and staying power. That State was surprised by this stonewall defense
is putting it lightly. They threw their men into the line only to be repulsed;
they shot their backs in sweeping plays around the ends, but met with little
success; they tried forward passes, double passes and tricks, all to no avail, the
Pitt defense showing an invulnerable front at critical times and State’:-; former
irresistable offense was brought up standing.

Not for an instant did the great team representing Pittsburgh slow up, they

plugged and plugged and fought off the State players till the ﬁnal whistle
sounded. In the last quarter when 'Pitt had possession of the ball, the plays
were called quickly, the ball snapped fast and the team lined up in an instant,
so anxious were the players to score.

The Pitt men showed a splendid spirit—not once did they give up: it was
ﬁght, ﬁght, ﬁght all the way, not only in a plunging sullen way, but in a dash-
ing, reckless, charging style that would have carried many of the best football
teams in this country completely off their feet. Spirit emanated from the Pitt
cheering section, the rooting was just as sharp, the ﬂags waved just as high
and the spirit was just as great after the whistle had blown and the rooters
realized the defeat as it had been before the game.

“Hube” \Vagner, Pitt’s great end, was the hero of the game, he seemed to
be allover the ﬁeld at once, breaking up interference, tackling viciously, hurl-
ing the forward_ pass and carrying the ball. His opponent, Capt. Very, is said
to be one of the best players in college circles, but Wagner played tag with him
all through the game and made him look like a dub—there was absolutely no
comparison in the playing of these two men. Brown put up a sterling article
of football, both on the defense and offense. “Tillie” Dewar played a star
game, but was badly injured in the second quarter and was taken to the hos-
pital, where it was found he had a dislocated knee and ﬁnger, besides some
painful bruises. Every player that took part in the game against State deserves
much credit for his nerve. aggressiveness and staying powers, and even in de-
feat every true Pitt man felt proud of his team!

1911 SQUAD
258

 

The 1911 Track Team was probably the weakest team that Pitt has put
on the cinder path for several years, and this condition can be traced directly
to the lack of training facilities, the unfavorable spring, and to the graduation
of some of the best members of the Championship Team of the previous
year. Schenley Oval provided a splendid track, but no other facilities, such
as dressing rooms, shower—baths, and warmth in chilly weather. Coupled with
these unfavorable conditions was the drawback of distance, the Oval being nearly
two miles distant from the University, which meant a long, tiresome walk, be-
sides the tiresome training. VVith such conditions there is little wonder that
Pittsburgh was not strong in track and ﬁeld events in 1911.

O. H. Bryson, ’12, a member of the 1910 Relay Team, was elected Captain,
and did all in his power to place the Gold and Blue at the top of the staff, and
if untiring effort would have won, Pitt would have seen a successful season.

Chalmers Hall, ’I3, was appointed Manager, and arranged the following
schedule:

March 10th Y. M. C. A. Meet. Duquesne Garden.

April 29th Penn Relay Meet, Philadelphia.

May 6th Interclass Meet at Schenley Oval.

May 13th Dual Meet with Westminster at Sharon, Pa.

May 20th Sixth Annual Intercollegiate and Interscholastic Track and Field Meet.
May 27th P. I. A. A. Meet at Harrisburg.

The spring was the most unseasonable one in history, and on this account
the relay candidates were able to do very little outdoor work until about the
middle of April. Three members of the star Relay Team of 1910 were miss-
ing when the trials were run on April 22nd, Rose and Robinson were unable
to run on account of their coming graduation, and Lambing was no longer at-
tending the University, leaving only Bryson as seasoned material. The ﬁnal
in the trials was won by Bryson in 52-2/5 with Rosenthal second, Halferty
third and VVooten fourth. Pittsburgh had been classed with several Western
Pennsylvania Colleges by the Penn authorities, but at the last moment was put
in the class with Fordham, Haverford, Johns Hopkins, New York University
and Geneva, which lessened her chances materially.

Pitt’s showing at the Meet was very poor, as inexperience showed in the
first two runners, who “blew up,” and Halferty and Bryson were unable to
make up the lost ground.

259

 

The Interclass Meet on the following Saturday was only a practice Meet
for the selection of the team that would represent Pitt in the Dual Meet with
\\'estminster at Sharon on May 13th.

The Pitt—\\'estminster Meet was won by Pitt by a score of 55-48, and
was close and exciting throughout.

Probably the most successful feature of the whole season was the Sixth
Annual Intercollegiate and Interscholastic Track and Field Meet, held by the
University, at Schenley Oval, on May 20th. The success of this meet was due
in a large measure to the able assistance that Graduate Manager Laurence B.
Hurst, ’o2, W’. W’. Zieg, ’1o, K. E. Davis, '10, and several other track experts
gave the track manager. Eight colleges and twenty-one preparatory schools were
represented at this meet, a11d the large crowd present was thrilled many times
by the close ﬁnishes in some of the events. Except for the heat, the day was
an ideal one for the meet and the track was in perfect condition. As a result
of the perfect conditions of weather and track and the classy entry list, seven
new V\7estern Pennsylvania records were established, ﬁve of these being Inter-
scholastic records. Hubbell, of \Vestern Reserve University, ran the half mile
in 2 minutes, I-2/5 seconds, being pressed hard all the way by Bryson, the
Pitt captain. Ashton. of V\’estminster, established a mark of 111.2 feet in the

260

 

discus throw. Matt Marshall, running under the colors of Allegheny High,
won the half mile in 2 minutes. 3-3/5 seconds. which clipped several seconds
from the former record. Marshall is now a member of the Pitt track team
and is performing in great style. Floto, the \Vellsville High boy, made the
best mark of the day when he won the mile in 4 minutes, 37-1/5 seconds.
This beats the former record by more than ten seconds, and is a wonderful
record for a preparatory school runner. Ken McCutcheon, of Pittsburgh High
School, established three new records when he threw the I2—pound hammer
148.7 feet, put the shot 45.3 feet. and hurled the discus 117.2 feet.

The Intercollegiate Meet was closely contested all the way, but Carnegie
Tech managed to nose out Pitt with a total of 48 points to 37-1/6. \Vestern
Reserve University did well, as they scored four firsts with only four men en-
tered, won the 100 yard dash, half mile run, high jump, and pole vault.

Pittsburgh High easily outdistanced their nearest competitor, Kiski, as
they scored 64 points to 34. Their easy victory was due to a great extent to
their prowess in ﬁeld events. The lnterscholastic events were divided into
Classes A and B, but this division has been avoided this year, as it takes up
too much time and is of no advantage to the weaker schools.

The season closed with the Pennsylvania Intercollegiate Athletic Associa-
tion Meet in Harrisburg, on May 27th. Pitt was represented by Captain Bry-
son, Rosenthal, Tinsley, Galvin and Dallenbach. Coach Jos. H. Thompson
and Manager Chalmers Hall accompanied the team. The trip was a very pleas-
ant one, the chief merriment of the party being caused by “Polly” Galvin’s
great capacity for straw_berries and ice cream. The men made a fairly good
showing, but were unable to score at ﬁrst in any event; they did score, however,
two seconds, one third, and four fourths, making a total of 10% points. Tins-
ley was the star performer, placing second in both the high jump and pole vault.
(lalvin scored third in the shot put and fourth in the hammer throw. Captain
Bryson placed fourth in the 440 yard dash, and fourth in the half mile; and
Rosenthal took fourth in the 220 yard dash.

But one record was broken, and that was when Carlisle's famous runner.
Tewanima, ran the two miles in 9 minutes, 49-3/5 seconds, being closely fol-
lowed by Arquette, also of Carlisle. The Indians won the Meet with 55%
points, with Lafayette ‘second and Lehigh third.

The evening before the events were held, a regular meeting of the Track
Managers was held to discuss current business, future plans, and to hold the
election of ofﬁcers for 1911-12. The following colleges were represented:
Bucknell University, Carlisle Indian School, Dickinson College, Lafayette Col-
lege, the University of Pittsburgh, Lehigh University, Muhlenberg College,
Pennsylvania State College, Swarthmore College, and Washington & Jefferson
College.

VAULTING—lNTERCOLLEG[ATE MEET

The following were elected as ofﬁcersz

CHALMERS HALL, President, University of Pittsburgh.
\VILLIAM H. REESE, Secretary and Treasurer, Muhlenberg College.

A meeting of the letter men was held after the close of the season, and
Homer  Halferty was unanimously elected Captain of the 1912 team, but
just before the opening of the following track season he was declared ineligible
by the Eligibility Committee. This action was caused by Halferty falling be-
hind in his studies, as he was unable to attend school for nearly three months

264

 

owing to sickness. His loss will be heavily felt, as he is a good man in the
440 and mile run, and would have made a good captain. He expects to be
well caught up by the 1913 track season and hopes to be in shape to win many
points for the Gold and Blue.

The following men were awarded letters: Captain Bryson, Rosenthal,
\\"ooten, Halferty, Lichtenfels, Galvin, Gehlert, Tinsley, McKinney, Dallen-
bach, Davis and Lindsay. l

MANAGER MACQL'()WN COACH FLINT ‘ ASST. MANAGER MURRAY

Early in the fall of 1911, Manager l-Iurst, appointed \Villian1 C. MacQuown
student basketball manager, and within a few days this hustler had started
arrangements for a good schedule. The next move of importance was the nam-
ing of Dr. George M. Flint as Coach. Dr. Flint had played on the University
of Pennsylvania ﬁve, and captained that team through 21 successful season, and
proved himself to be a splendid man for his new position. V\/ith only a few
candidates out for the team, and with the poorest kind of training facilities for
the players, he and Captain V\/alter Campbell built up a very strong team that
made a good record for the Gold and Blue, winning twelve out of twenty-one
games. The ﬁrst call for candidates drew but ﬁfteen men, and before very
long the squad was reduced to ten. For a time practice was held at \Vashing—
ton Park, but it was thought by all that this was only temporary, as the gym-
nasium had been promised by the first of the year, but the contractors kept put-
ting off the time until the season was over, and still the team was practicing on
any available ﬂoor.

The ﬁrst three home games were played on the splendid ﬂoor of the Pitts-
burgh Athletic Association, but later the scene of the games was shifted to the
ﬂoor of the Westinghouse Club in \Vilkinsburg. The changing of ﬂoors was
a great disadvantage to the players, Coach Flint and Manager McQuown, but
Pitt was fortunate in having such good ﬂoors when the slow work on the Gym-
nasium is taken into consideration.

The season opened on January 5th with VVaynesburg College at the P. A. A.
Clubhouse, and Pitt annexed a victory 38-31. A short jaunt into Ohio was

267

 

then made, and the Gold and Blue players won from Mt. Union in an exciting
game 16-14. This showed that the team was a good one, as the Buckeye team
is particularly good on their home floor. Two games were then lost, as Juniata
took a game by one lone point, and Grove City defeated the team on a 1niser-
able ﬂoor and with the worst officiating that a Pitt basketball team was ever
subjected to. P. A. A., V\/estern Reserve University, Carnegie Tech, Mt. Union
and the Westinghouse Club were then beaten decisively before Pitt again met
defeat at the hands of Grove City College in Pittsburgh. The Gold and Blue
players had things easy and the game cinched until the last minute of play, when
their opponents scored eight points and victory. Pitt then beat Hiram College
at home, but fell before Allegheny College at Meadville.

The next game was with Carnegie Tech for the Championship of Pitts-
burgh, and Pitt won by a score of 31-28. A third game was scheduled by Man-
ager MacQuown in case of a tie, but as Pitt won both games there was no use
of further contests. A week’s trip to the East followed, and while the showing
made by the players was good, considering that six games were played in as
many days, and that in every case the opposing players were bigger and heavier
than the Blue and Gold aggregation, the team’s high percentage of victories was
lowered considerably. The team managed to annex two victories out of six
games played, but with an even break of luck four games would have been won.
The players were much pleased with the splendid treatment they received at
the hands of their opponents, and all hope that games will be scheduled with
the same institutions next year. The victories were won over Mt. St. Mary’s
and Susquehanna College, while the defeats were handed out by Pennsylvania
College, Georgetown, Albright and Swarthmore.

Bellefonte was met and defeated by the Varsity the following Saturday at
home, but Allegheny took the last game.

Captain Campbell played a steady game all the year, and deserves much
commendation for the showing made by the team. VVells McDowell played a
good game at forward, and led in ﬁeld_goals by a large margin. The Wash-
ington papers claimed him to be one of the best college players that appeared

_ in the Capitol City this season. Harley Campbell played forward in nearly

every game, and proved to be a fast, nervy player. He is greatly handicapped
by his light weight, but makes up for this by his speed and aggressiveness. He
set Pitt’s record for the season in foul goal shooting when he tossed 19 out of
a possible 23 into the basket.

268

~:~<~«

 

Frishman, the smallest man on the team, played a star game throughout
the season, and won the commendation of all by the way he went after men
that outweighed him by a hundred pounds or so. Ochsenhirt won the centre
position early in the season, and no one was able to oust him, although some
of the candidates were inches taller than he. Brady, Broido, Graham and
Bane were second string men that are promising.

Pitt looks forward to next year when the Gymnasium will be in working
order, and all indications point to a successful season. At a meeting of the
letter men after the close of the season, \Valter Campbell was again elected to
lead the Gold and Blue forces on the basketball floor, and his re-election as
leader proved to be a popular one with the undergraduates, as they recognize
his ability in that line. In all probability Dr. Flint will receive the coachship
if he is willing to accept it again. The way he overcame many obstacles and
turned out a successful team from so few candidates, points plainly to his value
as a coach.

Probably no sport in the Universit_v has had such a rapid rise as tennis.
The schedule a few years ago, did not amount to much, and no appropriation
\vas given the Tennis Team by the Athletic Committee. At the present time
this branch seems to be on as ﬁrm a basis as any sport in the University, and
the schedule for this spring is equal to that of any institution in this country.

Early in March, 1911, J. C. MacKrell, ]r., was appointed Manager of the
Tennis Team, but owing to the lateness of his appointment and the small ap-
propriation allowed by the Athletic Committee, he did not try to arrange an
elaborate schedule. As soon as the weather permitted, a competitive tourna-
ment was played, and McEllroy, \\'ilbert, Sloan and MacKrell made the team.

The Intercollegiate Tennis Tournament of \\"estern Pennsylvania was held
u11der the auspices of Geneva College, at Beaver Falls, and Pitt tied with Grove
City in percentage of matches lost and won. Pitt won three gold medals, how-
ever, while Grove City had to be satisﬁed with three silver ones. l\lcEllroy, of
Pitt, easily won the Singles Championship in Class A, but Sloa11, who played
in Class B, was unable to win any of his matches. MacKrell, the Singles Cham-
pion of 1910, played in the Doubles with \Vilbert, and these two won the Cham-
pionship after several fast and exciting matches.

Pitt took three out of four single matches from W’. & _I., but the Tourna-
ment was halted at this point by a hard rain. The scores:

On Saturday, June 10th, 1911, the Pitt team met the team from VVooster
University, on the University Club grounds, and won every match. The

\\'ooster boys played a good game and proved themselves to be ﬁne fellows and
good losers. The scores:

MANAGER J. C- MACKRELL

The prospects for a winning combination are exceptionally bright this
year, as MeEllroy, .\IacK1ell, \\'ilbert and Sloan are still in school, and Wlright.
a member of the 1910 Team, is eligible this year. Among the new material
are Ebe, of the Edgewood Team; l\IacKenzie, formerly a member of the Geneva
College Team; Crick, a man that was within one point of making the team at
three different times last year, and Lytle, of the Trafford Team.

Manager MaeKrell has subtnitted the following schedule, which is szcond to
none in the country:

May I. Penns_\'l\'ania State College at State College, Pa.
May 3. Penns_\'hania. at Merion Cricket Club, Philadelphia,
.\la_\' 4. Lafayette at F_aston, Pa.

May 10. Pennsylvania State College at Pittsburgh.

May 11. Cornell at Pittsburgh.

,\Ia_v 16. Minnesota at Pittsburgh.

May 17, Open.

May 18, VVooster, at VVooster, Ohio.

273

 

Manager MacKre1l expects to enter the Tennis Team i11 the Intercollegiate
Tennis Tournament of America, to be held at the Merion Cricket Club in Phila-
delphia. Yale, Harvard, Princeton, Pennsylvania, Cornell, Minnesota, Dart-
mouth, Swarthmore, and others of equal rank, will be represented.

It was only after long deliberation and lengthy discussion that the Athletic
Committee agreed to support a baseball team for the season of 1912. The
greatest reason for wanting to put the matter aside for another year was that
Trees’ Stadium will not be in good shape for practice, and it is probable that

 

MANAGER GROVE COACH MCCREERY

no games can be played there until next Fall. The prolonged cold, followed by
heavy rains, has made the probability almost a surety. There is a wealth of
baseball material in the University this year, and, with proper facilities, a good
team could be put on the diamond.

Immediately following the agreement of the Committee to support a team,
Manager Hurst appointed Robert E. Grove, ’I4, student manager, and negotia-
tions were at once started with many teams in this locality for games. The
new manager found his task a difficult one, as most of the schedules were ﬁlled,
but he ﬁnally got a schedule together, which is a very good one, when the con-
ditions under which he worked are taken into consideration. In the meantime,

Director Miller was doing all in his power to land a good Coach for the team,
and his efforts were crowned with success, as he succeeded in signing Thomas
L. McCreery for this position. The new coach is a former National League
star, and seems to possess every quality of a good coach. He played for the
Louisville Club for three years, when he was drafted by Manager Fred Clarke
for the Pittsburgh Pirates. He pitched during the ﬁrst year with the Bucca-
neers, but the following year, on account of his heavy stick work, he was shifted
to the outﬁeld, where he remained until traded to Brooklyn several years ago.
He remained with the Dodgers several years until his retirement from the
game, and at present is employed in the otﬁce of a large ti11 plate concern. Mr.
McCreery, during his years of experience, has played every position on the
team except that of catcher, and as he is a great hitter, should be able to teach
his proteges a great deal about the National pastime.

While Director Miller has the names of about eighty candidates, there will
be no seasoned material to depend on, as Pitt did not support a team last year,
and on this account can hardly expect a very successful season. However, it
will be a great advantage in 1913 to have a line on available material obtained
this year.

FENCING

Previous to the winter of 1912, the University of Pittsburgh had never
been represented by a fencing team, and this sport had never been brought to the
notice of the General Athletic Committee. But this winter, Director Miller, after
a lengthy discussion with G. \V. Postgate, the fencing instructor of the Pitts-
burgh Athletic Association, and with other experts in that line, decided to bring
the matter up before the Committee. The plan, as brought up to this body,
was to arouse the interest of the student body, and if enough interest was mani-
fested in the new sport, to start a team and later in the year recognize fencing
as a minor sport. The plans did not stop here. It was also decided to have
dual matches arranged with some of the Eastern colleges, and if a good show-
ing was made, to apply for membership to the Intercollegiate Fencing Associa-
tion, which is composed of clubs at Army, Navy, Penn, Yale, Harvard, Col-
umbia, Princeton and Cornell.

Immediately on the announcement of the plans for a fencing team, about
twenty-ﬁve enthusiasts reported to Prof. Postgate, and work has progressed
wonderfully since that time.

The Club was organized at a meeting in the fencing room at the P. A. A.
clubhouse on Thursday, March 7, 1912, at which time the ofﬁcers were elected.
On March 6th, a Constitution was drawn and adopted, and its ratiﬁcation is
now with the Athletic Committee.

Judging from the intense interest manifested by a part of the student body
in this new athletic activity, the movement is sure to be a success, and should
prove of great beneﬁt to the University. G. VV. Postgate, the instructor, is one
of the most proﬁcient fencers in this country, and if good coaching means a
succesful team, Pitt will certainly make a good showing against her rivals.

The ofﬁcers are: T

G. W. POSTGATE, Instructor. RALPH K. SMITH, ’14, See. and Treas.
JUNE VVILBERT, ’13, President. A. E. PAFF, ’12, Manager.

(With apologies to Bret Harte)

(Ll was about to contribute this l9l3 book,
A poem entitled "Spring's the Time," by which I sought to hook,
The Favor of the undergrads as well as others, too,
For it was judged a masterpiece For any poet's debut.

(lBut now the mandate of the Board Spring poetry prohibits,
And recommends the writing of all knocks that are exhibits
OF malice, envy, jealousy, in which most of us share,
Then hand them in and wait to see the victim smart and swear.

(LNow l hold it is not decent, nor yet a proper plan,
To whale a Fellow in the school and boost another man,
Nor should the individual who happens to be meant,
Reply by heaving rocks at him to any great extent.

George sometimes gets inebriate with the exhutberancc
of his own verbosity, otherwise he remains perfectly
sober. If it were not for him this place would have
gone to the “bow—wows” long ago, George 15 an up-
lifter morally, lets hope he can keep away from shop~

lifting, at any rate until he is ordained. Zowee, who

Used to be a good-natured rough—houser, but since
he is associated with George and the VVeekly has as-
sumed a reverend look, highly becoming to his irre-
sponsibility. Would like to raise the "Old Nick” if he
dared, but as it_is he must set an example of virtue.
He does not like advertising but refuses to tell why.
In love with four different girls at the same time.

Mnllie is neither :1 suffragette nor a would-be school

Granted. But more phenominal still. Mullie also sports
a diamond.

WILLIAM SMITH, <1)Z<I’, Castle Shannon.

Bill is a distinct descendant of VVilliam the Silent.
An expert with the picture box, which makes him very
popular with the weekly and the Co—eds. He is 3. de-
pendable chap and a thoroughly good fellow.

Pi-esialent Intercollegiate Oratorical League.

Robert is the brains of the college. The most even-
tempered man on the “varsity.” He is some orator.
VVe believe if the ancient schools were in existence
today Bob would be the contemporary Demosthenes.
At any rate we would all vote for him.

Pittsburgh High School.
(‘an and Gown.
Owl Board 1913.

The great biologist. He is a most
gracious and obliging fellow and he will
give his opinion on anything. His slo-
gan of late has been “Have you got that
$5.50?” Brandy may have his faults but
“grouchiness” and ill will no one could
accuse him of having.

DONALD INGRAM KIRK, Pittsburgh.
Pitsburgh High School.

Organizer and Manager Pitt Student B€llL(l.
D. I. is inclined to be rebellious at
times and goes over to the enemy. Do
you understand, yes? But we will for-
give him of this in lieu of his many vir-
tues. Took fright at our fair Co—eds in
his Freshman year and has been quiet
ever since. '

HAROLD KING LEITCH, Pittsburgh.

Class Baseball.

Cap and Gown Club.

Harold is a good—natured fellow, but
disproves this statement when called
“———" by Joe Thompson and the rest of
the Football squad. One of Prof. Ull-
1nan’s Latin Sharks. V\7e see a bright fu-
ture for “King” after he has left his asso-
ciates at Pitt.

LEE LEMOYNE REED, Pittsburgh.

("JD and Gown Club.

Reed is a bosom friend of Riley. This

fellow had quite a time with his hair, was
worried about it for a long time, but is
alright now and we hope he has no more
trouble with it, as it spoiled his beauty.

HERBERT NELSON RILEY,
Pittsburgh, Pa.

Pittsburgh High School.
Cap and Gown Club.

A black haired young man, who in his
own estimation is the best looking “man”
in college. Is one of the favorite “girls"
in the Cap and Gown Club. A great

favorite with Co—eds and, in fact, a favor-
ite with anything that wears a “skirt."

LAURETTA MAY YOHN, Avalon.

Classical ('lul).
Y. W. C. A.

A ﬁrm believer in that “silence" is
golden. Never ﬂirts so we think, per-
haps, she is contemplating matrimony,
like others of the Co—ed tribe. Never
known to look or’ speak to a fellow.

MILDRED ZIEGLER, Avalon.

Y. W. L‘. A.

Mildred’s greatest notoriety comes
from her zeal for study. Devours page
after page of the Hitapodeca or the Lip-
zmishads (in a original), While nibbling a
microscope lunch. Her visage, with its
spectacles and borrowed frown is gener-
ally conceded to be the most scholarly in
the school.

THE OWL is the University of Pittsburgh Annual published by the
Junior class. The OWL aims to tell the truth, the whole truth
and nothing but the truth. The editors of the OWL do not in-
sinuate anything. The Pitt Weekly tells the truth, but not always
the whole truth. The OWL board‘s position is precarious; they carry
their lives in their hands. They care nothing for cuts, ﬂunks and—
we were going to Say—creditorS, but we will not; that wouldn’t be the
whole truth. If you have not perceived the Similarity between your-
self and your write—up tell next year's editor about it, but not us, for
we are long suffering. Before We began this work we were a quiet,
unassuming organization. We ate out of people's hands who talked,
but did nothing. Once, however, the delicious freedom of the OWL
was entrusted to us we became snappy and, later, pugnacious. If you
want to ﬁght just hand your card to Director Miller and he will ar-
range with Professor Postgate to act as referee to a duel with real
swords, a la Parisian editors. If you have bought an OWL and con-
tributed something noteworthy you may criticise, otherwise not.

An OWL is an economic investment. It cost four dollars to pub-
lish it. We give it to you for the mere pittance of two bones. Add
to this economic gain the intellectual gain in getting a line on the
future leading citizens, together with the pleasures and joys of life
derived from it, and you are ahead of the game.

OMORCS  

' HE class of 1914 registered as Freshmen full of high happiness and
great pride. There was a reason. They included in their ranks
the largest bunch of Co-eds in the history of the works. But their
pride, founded on such a ﬂimsy basis, soon had cause to Vanish.

Consider what they had to endure. Sir John Falstaff and two
others were made to sing songs and execute a dance on ‘the small top of a desk
iii the draughting room, ﬁve ﬂights up. Others were forced to perform noble
and glorious deeds such as rolling beans across the campus by means of tooth-«
picks held between their teeth. \\'orst of all a whole classwas forced to dis-
guise themselves i11 green caps. Two or three good sized chaps dared to leave
the entire \Vinter pass without donning the Irish head-gear.

 

The class as Freshmen distinguished themselves in many ways. To the
horror of the faculty and co-eds swarms of them appeared daily in red sweaters.
This to show the gentlemen’s indifference to the fair ones. Then they re-
frained from using ponies. It is said that not a man of them knows what the
word means. And their records in class athletics were simply wonderful. The
charge that the Freshman football team of I9Io lost more games than they
played is a malicious falsehood. But where the men of 1914 have really dis-
tinguished themselves is in the amount of tobacco they burn up. The annual
class tobacco bill would loom greater than the endowment of the University.

This year the 1914 fellows have lorded it over the Freshmen in true Sopho-
more style. They beat the Fresh in the class contests. The morning after
Hallowe’en they forced the Freshmen to wash their numerals from the retain-
ing wall, and made them replace them with the ﬁgures “I914”. The Freshies
were struck by a shower of white ﬂour while posing for their picture on the
steps of State Hall. And when Cap Night came the Fresh were so meek that
they gathered a ton of kindling wood for the bonﬁre and paid for the cider
and pretzels as if their Very life depended on it.

On the day of the class contest last Fall the Sophs were the principals in
a rare comedy. Forty Freshmen were imprisoned on the third ﬂoor of a dwell-
ing, minus their shoes and nether garments. At 3 P.M. their guards left them
to themselves. In a few moments F reshies were seen ‘sliding down rain-spouts,
telegraph wires, ropes made from bed sheets, etc., and (lisporting themselves
below, clad in petticoats made from rugs and sheets. The arrival of a police
captain with several coppers ended the‘ demonstration outside; but inside the
house the Freshies gave vent to their feelings by destroying furniture and kick-
ing holes in the walls. The bill for these damages was footed by the Sophs.

The police were required on other occasions to curb the activities of the
Sophs. One of their number was -arrested by a squad of cops while heading a
band of Pittites who were attempting to purloin VV. & ]’s goat. His capture
ended the riot and he was afterward released. Then the vice president was
arrested for plastering Freshmen posters on the sidewalk. He got out on bail
and was released on a plea of ignorance of the law.

The full chronicle of the doings of I9I4 since their advent at Pitt would
ﬁll volumes, considering how energetic they have been. VVe imagine that it will
be of interest, about forty years from now, to look up the record to see how
many of them have kept out of jail

'_ _~ _ llli College Class of 1915 began its long journey up the steep and rocky
‘ l ‘ hill of Higher Knowledge on the twenty-ﬁfth day of last September.
Numbering nearly one hundred—“Indians” (according to the “Sopl1s")
-—gathered together from the four winds, the tribe bore a strange dis-
similarity to the meek and humble weak-kneed Freshman Classes so
often and so picturesquely described in——well, different places. Gathering conﬁ«
dence from their great quantity of that anatomical substance called "beef," they.
(the wicked Indians) immediately got busy and held a powwow, elected a tem-
porary chief and besides almost did something horribly wicked for such young
things not yet two days old (No, they were not “pretty pink little darlings,” In-
dian papooses never are).

Early the next morning each brave decked out in his war togs of old clothes,
old shoes, etc., silently crept from his tepee and hit one of the many trails leading
to Luna Park. Mustering like a Highland clan, the warriors frightened the peaceful
inhabitants of Happy Region with their horrible battle cries and ﬁerce visages.
V\7hen all had assembled the march began. Through the East End streets the
wild and hilarious Freshies swept, in a manner which made the westward march
of the Huns look like a funeral procession on a rainy day. But the real fun be-
gan when they cane into Oakland. Several bold Sophomores were captured and
taken away to a place of safety. Toward noon or afternoon——few combatants got
any grub, so it makes little ditTerence——the battle began and contemporaneously
(in sorrow for the heroes who were soon to go to the Happy Hunting Grounds)
the Hevens wept. The first event on the program of hostilities were wrest~
ling bouts between the more husky members of the “Green” Indian Tribe (Oh
pshaw. who ever heard of green Indians?) and the—-the——the—“Sophs.” We shall
not call them "yello\v,” but when green is on one side of a scrap, nothing but or-
ange would suggest itself to a Hibernian as being appropriate for the other side.
However, we have since found our friends, the orange “Sophs,” to be pretty good
fellows. The wrestling bouts ended in a decisive victory for the Freshies and

36

 

 

every little papoose was happy. However, things soon began to grow dark for
the poor youngsters. The Sophomore bunch won the “tying up contest" and the
whole universe sobbed. Then the sand bags were lost and the heavens groaned.
My! How happy old Mars was that day! In the end the “Sophs” won out, of
course. for so the fates decreed. In this case the aforesaid fates were certain im-
portant parties who had charge of the affair. And so now we have reached the
end of the beginning of the Freshman Class of the College.

Through all the trials of those turbulent times our good allies, the 1915 men
of the School of Engineering, the School of Economics, the School of Mines and
——yes, by Hickory! the fair maidens of the School of Education—stood by us loy-
ally. For many moons after the “BIG SCRAP" the poor down—trodden Fresh
dragged out his miserable existence and then came Cap Night on February twen-
ty-sixth. Most blessed of sloppy nights! The eve of the emancipation! On that
evening, in mud ear deep, the Freshies were “sa1ted”—not “pickled,” understand
—by the Sophomore Class president; and behold! the Indian ha(l gone to his
Happy Hunting Ground and the green brain warn1ers—rather freezers—were of-
fered up on the altars as a sacrifice to Zeus. So ends the tale of woe.

HE history of the Class of 1912. School of lieonomics, is a record of
great things, by great men: the story of a class that has ever been
first in the school, that is the acknowledged leader of the Univer-
sity. Of the personnel of the class much might be said in eulogy.
and many instructi\'e tales might be told. \\'e might tell how

“Beaut_\"’ Mason charmed the Co—eds: or how “Ab” Frost made possible the
SLICCCSS of the (}lee Club: or how “l’urity” Leonard tamed the faculty and taught
them to eat from his hand: or how “Jap” Stewart presented the University with
a \\'eel<l_\' paper: or how “Bill" Ashe ran the senate. the Board of Control, the
Chancellor and e\'er_\'thing else. But these tales are of too much value to be
printed an_\'where except in the didactic history of great men that is about to be
printed. Sufﬁce to say that this is the greatest Senior class in the history of
the University. It is small because it requires more “gray matter" than any
other class. \\'e might note here that there are a few persons that would be
with us if they could. but having failed to make good with us they are “Col-
legers" or something else. In a word we might say that this class has no “rough-
necks" or “low-brows", and that it has the gentlemen of brains and intellect who
set the example for the whole University.

" INETEEN HUNDRED AND THIRTEEN Economics set up their
wigwam and pegged it the year Pitt immigrated to Sammy Mac’s
new lodge. Naturally the arrival of the good looking innocents 
created considerable jealousy among the older brethren already upon
the campus. But John Thom was there with bells on. He took
in the state of affairs at a glance, and out of the pure bigness of his heart he’
herded the wild and woolly ﬂock. Gradually that green fringe disappeared.
\\'e became domesticated, and ﬁnally civilized. Our brethren began to look on
us with more favor. A number of “Bish’s” roughnecks and John Fet’s goats
even joined the ranks. Some of these panned_out; the others (mostly others)
beat it, all sadder and wiser, some back to where they came from, and others,
braver than the rest, took a chance out in the wide, cruel world. “Bish”, ob-
serving the exodus, assumed a frightful mein in order to get rid of the rest,
whenever the visage of an economics man blotted the landscape. But then John
Thom made his famous “Survey” and butter went down, and we were viewed
with more favor. \Ve received mention in that famous sheet known as the
“Bomb", and yet live. Looking back over the past we have nothing to regret
and much to enjoy. Occasionally we burst forth into song. This time the
muse hath decreed it shall be verse.

  

We started in 1909, We studied hard to reach this goal.
The ladders of knowledge to climb; We class of twelve members:

VVhile the months were rapidly passing, And now to the highest we realize
.\Iarking the ﬂight of time; Is our motto “Climb up higher.”

While our work was thus progressing, To one and all rwe’ll bid farewell,
Our Junior year drew near, As we are separated;

And then all our bright and happy days May all unﬁnished work in life,
VVere pleasures unbedimmed by tears. If not in school be done.

Unfortunately comes from Greensburg and has a mis
leading name. Contrary to all indications, B. S. is the
most logical man in his class. He doesn’t write spring
poetry, argue in a circle, nor ﬂoat loans in Bull Dur—
ham. He is radically opposed to Women’s Suffrage,
although generally admired ‘by the ladies. He has pleas-
ing ways and would undoubtedly make a good ambas-
sador to Turkey.

“Josh.” the lady fusser, is certainly popular with the

his many virtues. Since he became an editor he has de-
veloped-a wonderful propensity for going out. He goes
to bed at I0 and gets up at 4. Divides his time between
philanthropy (.7) and Dr. Wallgren’s class in cutting
drill. The biggest pie eater in the University.

After preliminary training at Westminster he decided
to brighten the doors of Pitt. He did this in various
ways. He realized that the Pitt fellows were not en‘
thusiastic enough about the.Y. M, C. A., and after be-
coming its head he did great work for the association.
It seems to us, however, that Lawrence is not quite 
digniﬁed as a president of a Y. M. C. A. should be, for
he attends regularly the Junior Proms and does not
have his fraternity pin.

Although he has the wisdom he does not dispense it
as freely as do some of his more loquacious classmates.
He has the distinction of being the most reserved and
quiet student in the School of Economics. He has the
envious record of never ﬁunking, or over—cutting a
subject since coming to Pitt. As a ladies’ man he has
not yet made startling progress, but while there’s life
1here‘s hope. Appears civilized despite the fact that he
came from Jeannette,

The deepest stain on Patton's past history was caused
by the fact that he came from W. & J. Yet he has great
political ambitions and is taking his lirst course in this

As a manager he was a great success in his fresh-

eleven games, a notable record. The editor of the
“Bomb” sized him up wonderfully well. VVait
till “Stammy” ﬁnds out who the editor is. Our
bet is on the editor. Stam tried to raise one

FRANK WILBERT, JR., EX, Pittsburgh.
Pittsburgh High School.
Mercersburg Academy.
Varsity Tennis Team ’10, ’11.
Class Treasurer ’11.

From outward appearances he seems honest and this
accounts for the fact that he was elected class treas-
urer to take care of whatever he could get by force or
by other means. ‘He, however, fared just as bad as the
former treasurer, "Two Bits” Nicholson, who is said to
have collected 38 cents in our freshman year. As a
tennis star Frank has brought many honors to Pitt. He
has an unexplained craze for Public Speaking and op—
poses VVasson in all deep discussions in -political science.
On the whole his chances look favorable.

 

JOHN WILFRED ELY, Jeannette, Pa.

Jeannette High School.
University of Notre Dame, LL.B.

Although he hasn’t been with us very long, the indi-
cations are that Pitt gained quite an asset in Johnny
Wilfred. He is a graduate of the Notre Dame Law
School and takes great delight in cornering the profs.
on the ﬁne points of that science. Has a necktie for
every day in the month and buttons his shoes on the
train coming to school. He can argue any of the great
problems of the day, even Women’s Suffrage.

JOHN WILLIAM FARR, EN, Avalon, Pa.

Avalon High School.
Bethany College.

He was too big a man for Bethany and very wisely
decided to emigrate to Pitt. ‘He is tall and handsome,
yet is a pronounced 'Co—ed hater. He is “Monk” Was-
son’s side partner and this fact prompts us to overlook
his theories of evolution and of the high cost of beans.
A very good-natured fellow and popular with the stu-
dents. From present indications the world will hear of
him not long hence.

EARL STANLEY WASSON, Pittsburgh.

Washington and Jefferson Academy.
Pennsylvania Military College.
Cap and Gown Club.

The school of Engineering was the ﬁrst department
honored by the presence of “Monk,” but on the refusal
of that department to accept his new theories he joined
the ranks of the Economics School, where they‘ were
received and adopted. It might ‘be interesting to know
the origin of that cognomen “Monk,” but we believe
that it was on account of his originality that the name
was given him. A very congenial chap, very poular
among the students as well as with the Co—eds.

  

OMORl-35

H17. die is cast", were the words of some 18 innocent, unbeguiled
youths. who were playing “craps” somewhere in the U. S. late in
September, 1910. Immediately they were sentenced, with other
criminals, to four years’ hard labor in the University of Pittsburgh,
by \\'arden S. B. .\lcCormick.

The affair was hushed up at the time, and we have no desire to vomit it.
Nevertheless. “weniger \\'orten darum", as Prof. Harry says in his “glad rag”
Zuluese. It may be rememorized that the aforesaid innocents were conﬁned to
the School of Economics, under the kind tutelage of Dr. Holdsworth——rather in
close proximity to some convicts designated as “harmless”; “too bad his parents
were such nice people”—l)ut called Injuns or Engineers (same root‘).

\

 

l 'lllll{/((1  .

 

 

But let it be misunderstood that the _ludge’s decree (Chimpanzee for ap-
pendix) was never carried out. ()11 account of good behavior (.3) many terms
were shortened—some sick prisoners (suffering from suffragettitus) received
excellent care from the matrons of Dr. Chambers’ Juvenile Court.

But these (goody) prisoners often were compelled to associate with the
criminals and desperadoes known as Collegiates (German for beef stew), who
were compelled to attend chapel. These Collegiates were known in everyday
parlance as the “Bread and \\'ater outﬁt”. Several were conﬁned in cells called
“Labs". Some even pretended to be able to croon lullabys. and the C. C. (Con-
vict Chorus), was disorganized.

Thus in two years the Economics have become models for all their class-
mates and other classes in the “pen" and when, in the course of events, it be-0
comes necessary (quoted from Bud Fisher) to face the present collection, Dr.
Holdsworth’s favorites will be able to earn their own bread and oleomargerine,
while Bisliop’s counterﬁtters and Fett’s burglars (rouglmecks in the English of
the 400), will either drift to some compulsiﬁed domicile or go down, down,
down where the \\'urs(Berger) flows, and marry some female sex. VVe hate

 

to think of the day when these saintly Economists must quit this laborious insti-
tution and leave it to the devastation of this year’s inmates. If these dissected
walls stand after 1914, let the dust return to the dead, but give the credit to
this year’s Economic Sophs, who, by their tireless, sleepless efforts (it is
rumored some stay up all night), have set such an unrivalled example of the

motto, “Do others, before others do you”.

" T seemeth fitting", quoth Mark Twain, in addressing the Hoboes Con-
vention from the Statue of Liberty, “that a very slight testimonial
should be given of the doings of the Tribe of ’12, both in the
growth of Pitt and during the Reign of King Sam”. The first
and momentous event was the march of the ’12 tribe, decked out
in their war paint and loaded to the gunnels with a stock of disturbance makers,
known as sick eggs, up Perrysville Avenue. to the Campus Grounds of the
\\'ups, the whole mess resembling a bunch of South American Revolutionists
out on a rampage. At the top of the hill was the battle ground, where the
tribe of ’12 were to meet and do battle with the young braves of King Sam,
which were known as Sophs.

The tribe of ’12 arrived at the bottom of the hill where the battle grounds
were located without any fatalities, and proceeded to make themselves con-
spicuous by emitting several long a11d ear-splitting yells. They advanced up
the hill without encountering any resistance, until they arrived in front of the
Temple of King Sam, where they could very plainly see Sophs without the aid
of a telescope. A pause here ensues. The leaders of the ’12 tribe held a short
confab and gazed over the countenances of the Sophs as they were lined up
before them. “ ’Tis too bad,” quoth the leaders, “that we did not bring a larger
and more adequate supply of the American hen with us. But never mind, we
can dispose of our present supply with just as much energy as if we had a crate
full. Therefore let us up and at them.” VVith these kind words the battle
began. It waxed short and furious. The tribe of ’12 advanced and opened
ﬁre with the denatured product of the hen: after the volley, hostilities abruptly
ceased until the combatants recovered their breath, which had been temporarily
lost, due to the violent explosion of the aforementioned missiles.

The King of the \\'ups, Sammy-\laC. thought that affairs had progressed
a little too swiftly for the health of the community: so he ordered a cessation
of hostilities until the Big Chiefs of \Vup could convene and in devious ways

devise a committee to take care of the ﬁnal and decisive mixup between the
tribe of ’I2 and the bunch of ’II mutts.

The last and ﬁnal battle of the braves took place among the gathering of
the Chiefs of the \\’up. The main object of the battle was a sack of sand which
was thoroughly soaked and permeated with a substance, which resembled very
much the odor of eggs which have been thoroughly aged and gently broken.
The cause of the battle was placed in the center between the two combatants,
and a signal was given to commence the fracas. The tribe of ’I3 charged and
assaulted the cohorts of ’12 with missiles containing a white powder known as
ﬂour, thereby making it impossible for the ’I2 gang to glue their peepers on
the bag until the smoke of battle had cleared away. The hubub for the pos-
session of the bag lasted long and furious, and outside the loss of shirts, collars,
trousers and other things too numerous to mention, there were no casualities
of a serious nature. As a matter of course, and in accordance with the ethics
of the battle, the ’I2 gang was declared vanquished, and thereafter had to wear
the sign of their defeat, which consisted of a postage stamp surmounted with
a large green button, and which was used to adorn the pates of the '12 boobs.

From thenceforth the tribe of ’I2 was a part and parcel of VVupland;
which later was changed to Upland, in honor of the crowd of ’I2. The fol-'
lowing year, as a mark of further respect to the gang of ’I2, King Sam ordered
that the Camping Grounds of Pitt be changed to a more favorable location.

This is the reason why we are located now out in the High—Brow district.

The ﬁrst year in the Deep Thought section, or the year 122, was a year
fraught with many and numerous events; King Sam of the Up’s, saw to it that
a couple of tents were dedicated on the new Camping Ground; he scouted all
over the country to get a bunch of chiefs who could ﬂunk the freshmen and
others too numerous to mention without the least twinge of conscience; and
handed down a decree forever banishing the use of missiles which might even
have the suspicion of odor about them. This being the case, a new form of
warfare had to be devised by the ’I2 rowdies to take the place of the fowl-
smelling battles of the foregone ages. A very brilliant idea oozed forth from
the beans of the ’I2 gang, viz: that a ﬂag pole be erected, to which shall be
attached the ﬂag of the ’I2 bunch, then to make the chances of success remote
for the ’I3 boobs, it was decided to thoroughly grease the lower extremities of
the pole. The idea of the contest was that the ’I3 dubs were to try to remove
the aforementioned rag, while a gang of the ’I2 aggregation hovered around

76

 

the base of the pole, and in a general manner made it rather unpleasant for the
’13 rabble. Needless to add, gentle reader, that the outcome of the ‘whole affair
was a decisive victory for the ’I2 gang.

After the battle of the year 122, the ’12 tribe, being pushed and shoved by
the beloved chiefs of King Sam, had to settle down to work so as to be able
to pass through the portals of Pitt. In order to show their appreciation and
love for the ’I2 crowd, the chiefs of King Sam allowed the ’I2 tribe one day
in the week (Sunday) in which they did not have to attend the temples of King
Sam, and on that day they had to get ready for the proddings of King Sam’s
crew on the following six days of the week. Still, with all these troubles and
tribulations which were placed in the way of the ’I2 ginks, the majority of the
mutts have been able to stick to the ship.

Whenever King Sam had any particular hobby or scheme which he wanted
to try out on the dog, he always advised his mates to try it on the ’I2 boobs;
they were the goats. “If they can stand it, any. of the other bunch of ginks
can stand it”, twittered King Sammy, in the words of the poet.

The ’12 tribe has seen many other tribes enter and leave the temples of
King Sam. They have seen the change from a two-by-four University to one
which has a recognized standing among the best Universities of the world.
They have seen the erection of many new tents upon the camping ground of
King Sam. They have seen the number of the tribes increase from year to
year. They have rooted just as hard for the teams which have won every game
as well as for the teams which have not been so fortunate. They have seen
and taken part in the 125th anniversary of the birth of Pitt, which made the
people of the city sit up and take notice. They have seen the growth and glory
of Pitt increasing by leaps and bounds. They have seen the uses and develop-
ment of a Student Senate, of the Spits Weekly, of the Debating Team, and they
even have lived through one issue of that infamous sheet known as the Bumb.

And, as a ﬁtting close to this apparently humorous account of the biography
of the ’I2 rough-necks, they are going to try to leave some slight token or
memorial to the incoming freshmen; so that the spirit of Pitt may live and
endure for ages to come, and that the future tribes of Pitt may see ﬁt to keep
alive some of the wise plans, contemplated extensions and school spirit which
began in the reign of King Sammy-Mac.

UNIORS

(,)\\'Al{DS the close of the summer of 1909, when the new Engi-
neering Building, later named Thaw Hall, was ready for occu-
pancy, there appeared on the campus a herd of animals, that to all
appearances looked, to the class of 1912 perched on the platform,
like the inhabitants of some unknown planet. Upon closer scrutiny

those newly—privileged characters stationed on the platform perceived that the

newcomers were not entirely unlike themselves. They had studied Biology the
year before and they thought they knew every classiﬁction on record. Picture
their dismay, then, when they beheld this unknown specie of animals, and could
not for the life of them determine whether they were vertibrates, or inverti-
brates. Some of the wise ones contended that they were amoeba, while others
maintained they were in the ﬁrst stage of the Darwinian theory. These latter
went so far as to attempt to prove their assertion by pointing at the low brows
and creeping manner of locomotion. But whatever their ﬁrst thoughts were
they soon discovered that the new—comers, who styled themselves, “Class of
1913 Engineers,” were not invertibrates, when on the second (lay of the ﬁrst
semester they walked up the front steps. This settled once and for all the
question, whether or not they possessed backbones. In that memorable mix-up
one “Roughneck Dave” got one of those Soph’s heads on the hard stone of the
platform and stood on it until the Sophs begged him to cease spoiling their
classmate’s»mug. \Vhereupon the 1913 contingent looked with disgust upon
their quasi superiors. Coming as they did from the most select prep schools
they had such a horror for such vulgarisims and slang that they forthwith de-
cided that thereafter they would hold all communications with the despised

I912 band in the sign language, in order to keep their pure English unscathed

by the year 1913. Up to this writing they have succeeded remarkably well

considering the fact that they were obliged to go through a formal proceeding

 

 

82

 

known as the ‘‘Class Fight,” on which the faculty had put its stamp of approval.
To say that this was a ﬁght would be putting it mildly. On the hill of the
campus the 1912 ginks were massed around a greased pole on which ﬂapped
their class rag. Their game was to keep it there, while the duty of the 1913
gang was to pull it down. Decide for yourself whether this was a ﬁght, or
a crime, but before deciding, remember that the odds are equal in a ﬁght ac-
cording to any real sportsman. Having failed to overcome such great odds,
1913 was thereafter banned from the use of the front steps and were made to
wear black pancakes with green trimmings. Their position having thus been
settled, they turned their thoughts to the more congenial work of the class
room, and every morning at 8 they began eating math, which “Mother” fed
to them in huge lumps. One “Cufﬁe” swallowed so much of “Mother’s” offer-
ings that he came to class without breakfast fearing he could not down enough
of it. For luncheon we had Alex as toastmaster, and on the menu appeared
such choice dishes as arsenic, hydrogen sulphide and ozone. Every now, and
then Alec would call upon one of us for a toast, but the subject of these toasts
was so selected as to enable him to tell whether or 11ot we knew what we were
eating. Towards the end of the semester, when Alec called for the notes,
there was such a show of energy that several individuals went about with their
hands in slings for days thereafter; such was the havoc wrought by writer’s
cramp. Very soon this choice diet began producing a remarkable change in
their appearance. They began to look more like human beings when the dis-
tance between hair line and brow increased by something like a foot, and they
were henceforth named “The Highbrows.” Herr Leibnitz’s Calculus and
Mister Church’s Descrip were swallowed with a gulp, but when Merriman came
along with his Material Mechanics there was such an epidemic of hookworm,
which got such a hold on the fellows, that .they endeavored to work problems
by means of a majigger called a slide-rule. Reid _set them to work on some
problems on “theamless thubes” with a View of solving some vexatious prob-
lems encountered during his experience. Then came a dry I-Iinglishman named
Lea, with a book which he called Hydraulics, but which we all swear ought to
be called Highballics. You know how a highball muddles the brain. VVell
that stuff got us so muddled that we believe we were intoxicated all the time.
Mr. Lambie tried to keep us sober enough, goodness knows, but alas, his well-
meant efforts had the opposite effect on a dozen or so who straightway became
teetotalers, with the result that they were exempted from the ﬁnals. Those

83

 

who continued to imbibe became so saturated with the dope that they literally
smeared it all over the exam papers. \Vhen the next term opened none of
the Highbrows were in evidence. \\'hat became of them? Hist, now, man.
I’m not supposed to tell the secret because of the despair it sure would bring
to those over—learned 1912 crabs, but it will leak out sooner or later, so it might
as well be told now. The big interests gobbled them up! That’s what they did.
You didn’t notice those conferences in Bish’s oFﬁce behind closed doors, did
you? \Vell, if you had looked through the key hole you'd have seen them
signing up as consulting engineers for Messrs. \Vestinghouse, Mesta, Carnegie
and Schwab. That’s the outcome of Bish’s co—op plan. It’s the best thing
that ever happened (if the fellows were only paid for working) Go to it
now, kids. Get out your overalls and go out three months on the co-op.

In these modern days of Percivals and Algernons it

an indefatigable student and a good mixer. Even the
girls out East End way will testify to this. Although
he has been studying chemistry and biology long enough
to know that osculation is liable to result in germinal in-
occulation, he either does not believe these teachings,
or, like Hobson, thinks the pleasure is more than
worth the risk.

That tall chap of the raven locks and rose—tinted

other look. His past escapades are known only to
“Cuffy” to whom he conﬁdes his conquests. It must
be pretty trying on one’s nerves to carry about such an
effcctionate nature that falls in love in a day, but Chaw—
lie seems to enjoy such falls. His most distinguished
trait is his love of truth. According to Charles, con-
vention to-day is a multitude of lies.

HENRY TAYLOR EATON, Midway, Pa.

A fellow with a morbid propensity for sloth and pro-
crastination. Has such a large dome that he is afraid
to show the fellows the real size of it, hence seldom gets
his hair cut, even when the price is donated by charity.
Yet for all that Henry has a good head in the class-
room and his eccentricitics have come to be regarded
by the rest of his class men as due to some peculiarity
of his genius.

Somewhat of the Hess type with a little wordly wisdom

now and then. just to put the fellows hep to the fact
that he doesn’t miss the good shows when they come
to town.

name on the exemption list. We do not profess to know
the why and wherefore, but what follows might clear

“Handsome is as handsome does.” Perc has proved

intellectual giants of the class with the additional asset
of good looks—a rare combination. If you want to
hear the late airs just drop around when Perc is in a
whistling mood; he brings to us rags months before
they become popular. A model student whose only
fault lies in his teetotaling of the common vices, al—
though he can cuss like a Polish priest when occasion
demands.

A tall fellow of commanding appearance and grace-

is but a narrow view of him, for he never bothers the
Co—eds, but on the North Side is a big social favorite.
As a committeeman on the Prom he ﬁlled the bill with
dignity. Frequently seen in the role of ﬂoater of loans
to some of his ﬁnancially embarrassed classmates. A
very affable fellow, we must admit, but as a spreader of

OMORGS

the Fall of 1910 there came a class of would-be Engineers to old
University, to show up the upper class men, faculty, and in fact,
anybody that should try to show them anything. After spending
a short while under the watchful eye of Dr. Bishop and his cohorts,

they soon changed their attitude and determined to let these pro-
fessors tell them a few things.

  

Frank Thurman Leilich, a young newly married professor, who is, at the
present time, the proud possessor of the cutest little moustache you ever saw,
was our best friend  during the trying time of the Freshman year. He
probably had more success with his Analytic Geometry class than any other
professor will ever have. (Not excepting Arthur E. Fish and his undaunted
band of Public Speakers).

But defying all these difﬁculties, and with the short schedules that we have
been forced to carry, we have climbed to a higher point than any other class
ever reached, or any succeeding class will ever dream of reaching. This result
was only reached by doing wonderful work, for when we would look across
the hall and see the Economic and college students, (if they may be called that),
with their ﬁfteen and twenty hours of attending classes (not work), we would
feel like letting up on our work, but then stopping to think again, where we would
land after flunking out of the school of Engineering,—that is the way the Eco-
nomics School gets its stars,—we would much rather work hard than be classed
as a member of that tribe known to the world as ECONOMIC “STUDENTS.”

To tell of all the virtues of this wonderful class would ﬁll a book, so let it
suffice to say that brilliancy, studiousness, manliness, and all the other virtues of
the human body go together to make this class the greatest, as has been shown
in school, and will be more clearly shown after they have graduated and given
to the world some of the wonderful improvements in modern engineering, which
they are bound to do.
