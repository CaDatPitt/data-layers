    University of Pittsburgh students to
    enjoy the outdoors and escape the
    stress of college and city life.
      After long hours in the class-
    room, everyone agrees that there is
    nothing better than a summer day
    of sunbathing and Frisbee on the
    hill of Flagstaff followed by a free,
    Wednesday night movie. For those
    looking to escape all the sounds of
    the city, Frick Park Environmental
    Center and Nature Trails are a
    great place for relaxation and
    recreation. Located in Squirrel
    Hill, Frick Park provides a great
    place for a fun filled and educa-
    tional day away from campus.
      One of the greatest experiences

Laboratory of Ecology Field School
at Pymatuning State Park. Not
only is it a great learning experi-
ence in doing research and lab
reports, but it also provides
wondlerful recreational activities
for those who love the outdoors and
meeting new people. The field
station is located right on the
Pymatuning Reservoir, where
students can enjoy canoe rides,
sand volleyball, campfires, or
walks through the woods. The
recreation center provides Ping-
Pong and pool tables along with
many other games and activities.
Those who enjoy camping can visit
one of the many scenic campsites
surround(ing the lake. The best
part is that you are guaranteed( no
sirens or loud helicopters. The
wind through the trees and the
relaxing sounds of the forest are all
you will hear.
  A great escape from city life,
making new friends and p)rodluc-
tively learning all at the same time.
What could be better?

he 90s hosted a modern culture...Yo, talk about

       the understatement of the year! We are "livin' la
       vida loca" for sure - a crazy, modernized world in
which PCs are common household devices, a large per-
centage of students are sporting a celly, pagers go off in
the middle of class, and the whole nation seems to com-
municate via e-mail. But, in 10 or 20 years, newer inven-
tions will have replaced these andi we'll have to rely on a
page in this book to remind us what life was like in 1999
and 2000. Those of us rollin' around in a sweet ride will
be quick to inform others that the price of gas is an aston-
ishing $1.32 per gallon. It's not always cheap to eat
either, with a slice of pepperoni pizza at a buck sixty-five.
Just have your 'rents hook you up with a decent meal
plan and you'll be set. A $4.65 meal block may not seem
like much, but there's Dining Dollars too, so it's all good.
There is always something to do at Pitt. If you're not into
the partying or clubbing scene, a semester theatre pass at
only 18 beans will let you go see a show. Panthers foot-
ball season tix are only 20 bucks a pop an(l movie tickets
can be had for as cheap as $4.50 and ranging up to $8.
After a wild night, it'll cost ya 75 cents each in
washer/dryer fees to clean the sweater a fellow partier
spilled cheap beer on. But don't be boozin' in your dorm
room if you're under 21 - a Pitt drinking fine can be
around $40. This is a great time to be a student at Pitt.
Keep) it real and you'll be straight.

Changes


       ver the last few
           years at the
           University of
    Pittsburgh, many differ-
    ences have arisen on or
    around campus. One of the
    main uhanges is that the
    freshman class becomes
    larger every year, making
    housing problems worse.
    Within the last two years,
    new housing complexes and
    arrangements have been
    made to accommodate this
    dramatic increase. Newer,
    apartment style housing,
    like Bouquet Gardens, is
    being built to house stu-
    dents who had been living

in the lounges of their
dorms. Another major
change on campus is the
installation of Ethernet con-
nections in every dorm
room. Even with Ethernet,
many students opt to go to
the computer labs, so some
computer labs, including
David Lawrence Hall, are
now open 24 hours. The
kiosks in the William Pitt
Union, where students can
check their E-mail, are a
welcome addition to the
University. One more
change at Pitt is the logo on
t-shirts or sweatshirts. They
went from saying just "Pitt"
to saying "Pittsburgh" with
the picture of a Panther.

    f you've ever had an intro class
        in room 125 of the Frick Arts
        Building (it's the big auditori-
    um), then you know how comfort-
    able the seats are. You know how
    the chairs can persuade you to
    slump down in them until you can
    lay your head back and still be able
    to take notes or look at slides. You
    know how those soft, squishy seats
    just beg you to fall asleep. The
    best thing about that room is that
    classes are big, so there isn't any-
    one to notice your drooping eyes,
    unless a friend nearby pokes you to
    prevent your slumber. Even then,
    the seats sometimes win.
       Not to say that Intro to Art,
    Intro to Anthropology, or Intro to
    Microeconomic Theory are boring
    courses. May I generalize to say
    that the larger classes have more
    comfortable seating? These large
    classes are usually very diverse,

containing students from all disci-
plines within the University, and a
plentiful number of first year stu-
dents who aren't sure what they
want to do. Most are there for the
same reason-General Education
requirements. Most of these classes
find themselves in the large audito-
riums of Benedum Hlal, David
Lawrence Hall, or Posvar Hall.
    Some of these courses can be
 really interesting for non-majors
 who just want a taste of something
 new or fun. If you're interested in
 music, maybe History of Jazz or
 Intro to World Music is for you. if
 you need to take a science class, try
 the classic Intro to Psychology, or
 something with a trickier title, such
 as Stars, Galaxies, and the Cosmos
 (more commonly known as "Stars
 for Studs" or Geology (which Pitt
 students have always called "Rocks
 for Jocks"). Or for a small, highly
 interactive class, there's Intro to
 Performance. Wherever your
 interest lies, Pitt's offerings will
 provide you with plenty of options
 for your liberal arts needs.

L     eaving high school and com-
      ing to college is not the easiest
      transition to make. The
change involves an entire shift in
attitude and even personality. A
person's entire life is turned on end
as freedom, workload, anti personal
responsibility are put to the test.
But the move from naive to know-
it-all does not have to he faced
alone. Support for incoming
freshmen is abundant at the
University of Pittsburgh.
   Lantern Night and Night of the
Panther are two activities that
welcome freshmen to the University
and make incoming students feel
like part of the Pitt community.
Sponsored by the Alumni


  Association, Lantern Night is a wel-
  coming ceremony for the new
  women, anti Night of the Panther is
  a similar ceremony for the men.
  I eld in the fall, these gatherings
  ensure that a sense of fellowship is
  given to some students who may be
  feeling awkward in a new situation.
     Another way to learn more as a
  freshman is by taking Freshmen
  Studies, a one credit course that
  introduces the University and sur-
  rounding city through a series of
  lectures, field trips, discussions,
  and projects. Going up the incline
  and exploring the restaurants of
  Oakland on outings are common
  plans made by Freshmen Studies
  classes.
     The University of Pittsburgh
  truly is a community, and helping
  new members adjust is and has
  always been handled with open
  arms of welcome.

       he University of Pittsburgh's remarkable academic
       position is most likely a topic that is not discussed
       to great lengths among students here. But there is
plenty for the students to talk about, such as the top
quality Honors College, the fact that the University is a
"Public Ivy," and that it is a member of the Association of
American Universities.
   Established in 1986, the University of Pittsburgh
Honors College set out to meet the special needs of its
most qualified and determined undergraduates. Many
students have found that it is every bit as nurturing as it
is challenging.
   Even before the Honors College was created, Pitt was
listed among the universities in The Public Ivies. The
book lists and describes seventeen public universities in
the United States that are capable of offering an Ivy
League education. But we don't need a book to tell us
that. The University has had more Rhodes and Fulbright
scholars than any other school in Pennsylvania. And this
year, Pitt's Honors College turned out Rebecca Hubbard,
recipient of the prestigious Marshall Scholarship.
   It is also important to note that the University of
Pittsburgh is an elected member of the prestigious
Association of American Universities (AAU). The AAU is
an organization made up the 62 of leading doctorate-
granting research institutions in the United Sates and
Canada. Membership is the highest honor.

Scientific



Notation


Walking through the halls of Benedum Hall or
          the Clapp-Langley-Crawford Complex can be
          an enlightening or bewildering experience for a
student. For someone involved in biology, chemistry,
physics, or neuroscience, these halls may be lined with
familiar terminology. The posters of the most up-to-date
research are displayed along these walls, with complicated
and specific titles. For those not accustomed to the
sciences, these posters may be filled with incomprehensi-
ble sentences, charts, and colorful pictures. However,
even if you can't understand what the poster is talking
about, you may recognize the authors. Names of
undergraduates are printed right next to professors' and
graduate students' names.
   The real mystery is what exactly occurs inside a lab,
or perhaps what a real lab looks like. Is a lab filled with
multicolored liquids bubbling through tubes? Do labs
have mice running through mazes? Do they have large,
whirring machines for microscopic observations? In
truth, some labs have these things. Some labs have
chemicals lining three walls. Some labs have microscopes
as big as the lab itself.
   Whereas at other institutions research is limitetl to the
elite few, undergraduates at Pitt are widely involved in
every level of research at many labs on campus. Students
who work under the supervision of a professor may
receive practically the same training as gradulate students.
After learning the techniques, an tundergraduate may be
able to do cutting edge research, )present at national
mneetings, or even publiish their finlings, thus making the
mark of the most acco,mlished researcher.

What Students Do for


Extra



       habble from a computer
       screen, letting someone lput
mystery cream on your arm-what
tdo all these things have in common?
They are all ways that Pitt students
can make extra money. We've all
heard about students who grow a
nasty third eye at the research lab
being a guinea pig for the weekend,
but most students were able to sur-
vive the lab animal explerience.
   In reality, there are many things
to do on and off camplus to make
extra money. From working at a
deli or bagel shop to selling off old
CDs (that's the music not the bank
kind) there's always a way to keep
the student loan officer from your
door. Students can also always
find research stutldies at UPMC
where other graduate students are
doing research to find cures for
various diseases. The best and


Money


most lucrative research studies, in
this author's opinion, are at
Novum, a clinic in East Iiberty
where students can find a relaxing
paid weekend vacation. For just
thirty-three hours in the clinic,
students receive $170 for testing
various lotions and creams on their
forearms. Again, I would have to
say that quick, easy cash is hard to
pass up when the rent is due.
   Some of these studies may sound
gruesome and outrageous in the
beginning, but are usually for a
good cause and hell) others in the
long run. Sometimes there is no
other alternative than selling fruit
at intersections, and with the crazy
Piittsburgh drivers around here,
who would want to chance it?!

after class jobs to go to. The

sitters.

Chan ing the




Worl


_Most people are probably not aware of how the
         University of Pittsburgh has changed the course
         of history through invention and exploration.
But students here should know of the incredible discover-
ies and advances in the field of science and medicine that
have taken place on campus.
   Probably the most notable discovery made here at the
University, was made by Dr. Jonas Salk, who in the early
1950s created a vaccination for polio, a disease affecting
the central nervous system. After field trials in 1954,
Salk's vaccine was proven safe and effective, and mass
inoculation began across America. The number of
reported cases of this highly feared disease dropped from
57,879 in 1952, to only a handful in the following years.
Because of the work of Salk and his peers, the polio virus
has almost completely vanished from the world.
   A more recent advance in the field of medicine
occurred here in 1984 when Doctor Thomas E. Starzl and
Henry T. Bahnson performed the worll's first double
transplant operation when they replaced the heart and
liver of six-year-oll Stormie Jones at Children's Hospital.
In 1984, the University of Pittshurgh was the only place
in the country where transplant surgery was being (lone
on six major organs, including the simultaneous replace-
ment of the heart and lungs. Starzl soon began training
other surgeons to perform liver transplants. In passing
on his methods to other surgeons, Starzl helped establish
liver transplant centers around the world.

As Time



GoesBy


           e have all seen
              many changes
              over the years.
    Changes in technology, in
    fashion, in government, and
    in a million other areas.
    Maybe one of the most sig-
    nificant changes, though, is
    in the attitudes and out-
    looks of today's college stu-
    dents. Young people are
    always in tune with what is
    going on around them, and
    the culture of their time has
    traditionally been the main
    factor that determines their
    actions. But what is driving
    University students today?
    Dr. Dennis Looney, Chair

Above Left: Computers are
becoming the wave of the future.
There are hundreds of accessible
computers all over campus.

field for students to jump into. Not
only do students have to learn cur-
rent findings but learn old ones to
catch up.

Convocation we all wondered
where our experiences at Pitt
would lead us in the future.


  of the Department of
  French and Italian here at
  Pitt, comments that he has
  observed certain students
  being more driven toward
  personal success.
     Since the 1980s,
  American culture has
  become obsessed with the
  almighty dollar, and today's
  generation is following that
  path, but with a more spe-
  cific goal. They want to
  make money and work in a
  hot field. Computer tech-
  nology and biological sci-
  ences have been booming in
  the last ten years. Fifteen
  years ago, students arrived
  at the University and took
  different classes to feel out
  what they wanted to do with
  their lives. "Now," says
  Looney, "they want the
  excitement of a career in
  biology or computers. They
  arrive here as freshmen
  with a career goal."

Graduation


   ap. Gown. Degree. It all
      boils down to getting out of
      college and getting on with
life. No matter if you graduate in
the spring, summer, or winter, all
the hard work and sacrifice pay off
in the end as you receive the docu-
ment stating that you have proved
yourself over the last four years.
   But what leads up to graduation
(lay? I low does senior year, or
even your last semester, compare to
the rest of the college experience?
And what (do you look forward to
after leaving?
   The trials and tribulations of
pulling all-nighters, last minute
paper composing, and 1 a.m. calls
to Pizza Outlet all come to an end.
And, hopefully, they have paid off.
But school isn't the only thing you
have juggled these last few months.
What about your social life? And
job hunting? You (unfortunately)


aren't handed a career with your
degree.
   The big payoff comes when you
are able to look back and think, "I
have a car that runs now, instead
of that old tin can and riding the
public buses. I can work nine-to-
five without having to schedule my
job around a haphazard class
schedule. And I FINALLY get a
decent paycheck, allowing me to
live in a nice place with cable!"
   Despite all of this, you will look
back on your (ays at Pitt with
fondness. Alfter all, not all your
c:lasses were horrible. Not every
roommate was intolerable. And
maybe just one time you had fun
studying until 4 a.m. with your
friends.
   Congratulations on graduating!
Here is to where you've been and
to where you're going.

                   -Tony Frascella

A Multi-ethnic



Heritage


Poll a random group
       of students at the
       University on the
same issue, and I guarantee
that the responses will be as
varied as the group polled.
We at Pitt are a healthy mix
of education-seekers-from
freshly-graduated high
schoolers to second-genera-
tion American grandmoth-
ers and, of course, students
from more than 100 nations
on a continuing search for
knowledge. But in some
ways, being different is
what makes us all the same.
In a word, we are diverse.
   Exploring diversity was,
and still is, the mission of
the University Center for
International Studies,
which oversees the
Nationality Rooms and
Intercultural Exchange
Program. Pitt introduced
the first Nationality Rooms,
the German, Russian,
Scottish, and Swedish


Rooms, in 1938. Today,
twenty-six rooms honor
Pittsburgh's mixed ethnic
heritage, including its
African, Japanese, and
Syrian/Lebanese communi-
ties. About 30,000 people
visit the authentically deco-
rated Nationality Rooms
each year.
   Appreciating other
cultures is one of the goals
of the University Center for
International Studies.

       Rooms and receive the gift another

Real


World?

efore graduation, we

       all have to think
       about what we are
going to do with the rest of
our lives as we enter the
"real world." Not everyone
knows from their first day
of classes what they want to
do or be. And those that
come in knowing "for sure"
that they want to be com-
puter engineers, may end
up switching majors and
graduate with a degree in
political science.
   One option many stu-
dents take is graduate
school. Expanding your
education and getting your
master's is great for career
karma and your resume.
Pitt offers many programs
where you are able to
increase your reservoir of
knowledge.
   For other seniors, job
hunting begins right after
winter break. Sending out
resumes, going on inter-


views, and beginning the
financial planning to pay
off loans take up the time
between those last two gen-
eral education require-
ments you forgot. And
there is also Career
Placement Services, a valu-
able resource in finding
that perfect job. Or at
least the one that may lead
to the perfect job.
   What is the real world,
anyway? A paycheck? A
nine-to-five job? You
decide.

    robably few peop)le
          are aware of the
          interesting history
    surrounding Heinz Chapel.
    Construction of the Chapel
    was the idea of Henry J.
    Heinz, who, in his will, gave
    $100,000 for its construe-
    tion. The Chapel was
    intended to be a memorial
    to his mother, Anna
    Margaretha Schmitt Heinz.
    However, when Henry J.
    Heinz diedl, his children
    added more money to the
    donation and( dedicated it to
    their father as well.
      In 1933, construction of
   the Chapel began. In

Chapel.
Below right: During the winter the
Heinz Chapel has a certain aura to
it. The white flakes just add to its
magnificence.


f Truth






   November of 1938, the
   Chapel was completed. It
   was designed in 13th-centu-
   ry gothic style by architect
   Charles Z. Klauder, who
   also designed the Cathedral
   of Learning.
      The Heinz Chapel is a
   popular place for weddings
   andi christenings, but
   understandlably, there is a
   long waiting list. University
   students, alumni, faculty,
   staff, and members of their
   immediate family, and
   employees of H.J. Heinz
   Company can 1)e married
   there, as well as members of
   a University-related i)oar(
   anti members of their imme-
   diate family.
      The Chapel serves as a
   stunning atddition to the
   fascinating history of the
   campl)S and alddls to the
   overall aesthetic beauty of
   the bluil(lings at the
   University of Pittsburgh.

Invention


Imagine going to school in
    the place where polio was
    conquered, where the
inventor of the television
studied, where the football
team was not only the first to
don numbered jerseys, but the
first to reject segregation at the
Sugar Bowl. What if you could
have labs where someone
discovered vitamin C, or where
the inventor of gene splicing
studied? What if your school
had the first fiber optic
network on a campus? What if
your school's observatory had
made the discovery that
Saturn's rings aren't solid and
that there are planets around
other stars? Would you be
proud to have gone there?
   You did.
   Even in 2000, you might
have run into a fit and trim
faculty member named Julius
Youngner, who, in the 1950s,
worked with late Pitt faculty
member Jonas Salk to create
the first effective polio vaccine.
You could have studied
astronomy at the Allegheny
Observatory, where the secrets
of Saturn's rings were revealed


and an optical lens has peered
much of the way across the
universe. You might even have
taken a class with Professor
William Cassidy, whose collec-
tion of meteorites may yield the
first proof of life on another
planet.
   You've learned from some of
the greatest explorers and
inventors of your era, and you
have been equipped to explore
and invent on your own. What
new feats will Pitt alumni and
faculty accomplish in the
future? Only you can decide.











         Above Right: W. A. Cassidy kneels
       next to a large Martian meteorite he
          discovered in Antarctica in 1979.

        Center: The Allegheny Observatory
        uncovered many secrets including
                   that of Saturn's rings.

RESEARCH


  f you know anything at all
    about Pitt's history in research,
    then you probably know that
the polio vaccine was developed
here in 1955 by Jonas Salk. If you
didn't know this, well, now you also
know that this polio vaccine
reduced the diagnosed cases by
over 55,000 people. Another well-
known advancement to come out of
Pitt was the identification of the
chemical structure of Vitamin C.
Have you ever sat around in the
morning, looking into your glass of
orange juice and wondered about
the arrangement of the atoms
swimming around? Probably not,
but apparently Charles Glen King
did in 1932.


     That was when Pitt was estab-
  lishing itself as a research institu-
  tion. It doesn't need to anymore.
  Pitt is ranked within the top 10 of
  public universities receiving grant
  money from NIH and number one
  for grant money from the National
  Institute of Mental Health. In the
  past few years, grants have been
  given to Pitt to set up many differ-
  ent research facilities and pro-
  grams. Highlights of the latest
  research include the discovery that
  Vitamin K may stop cancer cell
  growth. Also found was the hor-
  mone-like substance IL-12, which,
  when used in gene therapy, can
  reduce tumors in advanced cancer.
  With a highly impressive list of
  accomplishments, the research,
  which comes out of Pitt surely
  speaks for itself.

           Panther football in
    the recently torn down Pitt
    Stadium. Memories
    marked every inch of the
    stadium, which was com-
    pleted for the 1925 season
    and saw many glories in its
    day. But its many virtues
    were overshadowed by its
    many shortcomings.
    Restroom lines were ridicu-
    lous, large crowds weren't
    easily accommodated, traf-
    fic was suffocating, and
    parking was nearly impossi-
    ble. After taking such mat-
    ters into consideration, the

  Dan Rooney's offer to form
  a partnership in construct-
  ing a new stadium. The

  to increase the view of the

     Plans to turn the ten
  acres on which the old sta-
  dium was situated into a
  convocation center are
  underway as well. The
  John M. and Gertrude E.

  be home to a basketball
  practice complex, a ticket

  12,500 capacity basketball
  arena. Graduation cere-
  monies will be held in the
  new events center, which
  will also be the location of
  modern fitness facilities.
  New dorms are part of the
  plan as well.

Thinking



Ahead

itting with three friends and a latte on a night when

     we should be studying for finals, the conversation
     turns to the new millennium. It's December, a few
weeks before the Y2K tension will prove itself to be media
hype. So in addition to debating over whether or not
mass power outages will occur, we stumble onto the topic
of graduation and the workplace of the future. All three
of my companions are seniors, waiting to gather their
diplomas in May and head out into reality.
   "Don't you find it exciting to be graduating in the year
2000?"
   "It's not really anything special, just a year like any
other year," says Kate. "I don't think that there will be
any fundamental differences in the world or the work-
place simply because of the new millennium."
   "I agree with Kate," says Jen, "but I think it will be
cool to be able to say that I graduated in the year 2000."
   "Okay, so how do you feel that the workplace is going
to change as we move further into the new millennium?"
   "I think that the workplace will become increasingly
specialized," says Ian. "It's impossible to do anything
with a liberal arts education now, and I think it's only
going to get worse."
   Kate and Jen agree with this, and go on to conclude
that it will become harder for people to relate to each
other as fewer people have a broad knowledge base.
Despite this, none are too worried about graduation at
the moment, or the new millennium. May seems a long
way away and meanwhile, there are exams to study for
and papers to write.


Above: Some students don't think there
will be any fundamental differences in the
world or workplace because of the new
millennium.
Right: According to one student the work-
place will become increasingly specialized
in the new millennium.

graduating in the year 2000.

   Farewell



When I ran for Student Government President, I pledged to meet the challenges of advocating
         for all students by improving their daily lives at the University of Pittsburgh. I am proud to
         report on the success of that pledge in the pages of this book.
   Before I outline some of the projects and positions that Student Government undertook, I must
acknowledge the people who sustained me throughout a tumultuous year. I would like to thank
Chancellor Mark A. Nordenberg, Vice-Chancellor Dr. Robert Gallagher, Director of Student
Activities Joe Cavalla, SGB Advisor Joyce Giangarlo, and SGB Secretary Donna Mihalik. They are
the backbone of Student Government and the personalities behind its success. I would also like to
thank the 1999 Student Government Board Members, Chairs, Work Studies, and committee members
for a valuable year of service and advocacy for the student body. Working as a team, Student
Government was able to complete 28 major projects, fifteen of which were never attempted before by
SGB.
   As SGB President, I attempted to reach out to individual students, student groups, and the entire
University community to promote service, leadership, pride, and progress. I faced many challenges
as SGB President, including standing up against the demolition of Pitt stadium, and subsequently
voicing the students needs and concerns for the new facilities that would result from the administra-
tion's ultimate decision.
   In addition, Student Government reformed the student telephone service, conducted in-depth
adviser evaluations, held a Student Banner Fest and Midnight Madness to increase school spirit, held
training seminars like Leadapalooza, GROW, and the High School Leadership Forum, organized a
Big-Brother Big-Sister Day with Children's Hospital, initiated the SGB Newsletter, and arranged for
the design and production of the Millennium Panther. I am proud of these accomplishments, proud
of this service, and proud of the legacy I leave for Pitt's future. In everything I did I tried to work
for today, to remember yesterday, and to prepare for tomorrow.








                                                              Hail to Pitt!

The Quiet



Commons


  nowledge circulates
        here, through the
        hallways and the
classrooms, up the stair-
wells and along the gothic
arches, under the tables
and through the iron gates.
   This is finals week at the
Cathedral, when day mesh-
es into night beneath the
soft lights of the Commons
Room. The tables are full,
heads bowed in devotion to
the calculus problems, busi-
ness notes, chemistry
books, and great works of
literature. Some students
are settling down to their
first hour of study, and
others have been here for
almost a full day. Most are
sleep-deprived; all are tense
and envisioning their post-
finals celebration. Some are
here because they enjoy the
atmosphere, and some are
here because they must be.
"It has the perfect lighting
for studying. It's not bright


enough to get distracted by
other people," says Annet
Har-el.
   Perhaps you were
impressed when you first
toured the University, but
now see the Commons
Room as just another place
on campus. Maybe you
only had a minute until
class started and didn't
notice the huge gates in the
center of the room or the
words atop them: "Here is
eternal spring. For you the
very stars of heaven are
new." Take another look.

A Rich, Artistic





History


            any buildings on campus
            have an artistic quality
            to them.
       For example, Posvar Hall
    (Forbes Quad) certainly has dis-
    tinctive architecture and includes a
    large central painting and a huge
    hanging sculpture, both by world-
    renowned Pittsburgh sculptor
    Virgil Cantini. Cantini also created
    "Man," which hangs above Fifth
    Avenue at the Graduate School of
    Public Health.
       Heinz Chapel will test your
    knowledge of history with its
    stained glass windows, which
    depict 391 famous religious and
    secular figures.
       The Frick Fine Arts building
    houses the University Art Gallery
    and its own permanent collection of
    religious iconography, providing an
    atmosphere conducive to studying
    art and art history. Its wood-

paneled library holds books and
prints of great historical signifi-
cance.
   The actual art on campus is
only one way in which students
combine art with education.
Besides the arts-related majors
(Studio Arts, Architecture, and
History of Art and Architecture),
there are many opportunities for
students who wish to take advan-
tage of the city's offerings.
   The newly-established Pitt Arts
Program allows students to go to
dance and music performances or
visual arts exhibitions for free or at
discounted prices. The University
also offers free admission to numer-
ous museums around the city,
including the Carnegie and Warhol
Museums.
   Blending academic excellence
with artistic integrity and intrigue,
it is clear that the University's goal
is to provide an intellectually and
aesthetically stimulating curriculum
and atmosphere.

               -Celeste Kimbrough


Center: The Frick Fine Arts Library
is an excellent place for research
and studying.

Digital Studio gives students
the opportunity to explore new

           nyone who's been to
           Chik-fil-a at noon
           knows that it's
    impossible to find a place to
    sit and eat. It's as though
    half of the University comes
    here every day midday, just
    waiting to take the last
    table. Then again, it's
    understandable. The half-
    mile line at Chik-fil-a isn't
    just for the chicken; it's for
    connection.
       The Cathedral of
    Learning's ground floor
    isn't just about eating. It's
    where you run into friends
    and professors. The bul-
    letin boards lining the walls

which made on campus dining a
little easier.

are a great place to find a
summer sublet, job, or
books for sale. The comput-
er labs, with quick Internet
connections and current
software, are filled day and
night. Only on the ground
floor of the Cathedral can
you feel the weight of what
you are standing under: 42
floors of concrete, cables,
and glass, not to mention
the students.

Life on the



Cathedral Grounds

      ven though I am a freshman here at the University of Pittsburgh,
      I can feel the pull of the Cathedral Lawn. As I have come to find
      out, the Lawn is not only a great place to study on a nice day, but
also a fantastic place for recreation with many games of Ultimate Frisbee,
football, and soccer usually in progress. It serves as a meeting place for
many students and friends to plan the day's activities or just catch up on
current events.
   Many people find the Lawn to be a great place to study, get work done,
gossip, and have lunch. Aside from that, some Pitt Panthers go to the
Lawn to do improv sessions with friends and play music. I even hear
about the Cathedral Beach: a really nice day when everyone on the lawn
is playing volleyball, tanning, and having a good time. I've even heard of
people using cafeteria trays to go sledding during the winter.
   Everyone engages in different activities on the Cathedral Lawn to have
fun, get some exercise, or simply relax, and there is always something
going on in which you can take part.

Move-in


           hen TVs, mini-refrigerators, stereos, mirrors,
           clothes, computers, posters, and milk crates
           are seen in large yellow carts all around
campus, it means only one thing: It's move-in day! The
streets of Oakland were full of backed up traffic and
confusion on Wednesday, August 25, 1999, for it was the
start of the college year for students here at the
University of Pittsburgh. New students, as well as those
returning, were preparing to experience resident living.
The day went smoothly thanks to help provided by the
University police, volunteer workers like the Freshman
Peer Counselors, and the University Housing Services,
who were in charge of Arrival Survival.
   Move-in (lay at Pitt, "Arrival Survival '99," was still
slightly hectic, but with so many students trying to move
into the same area, the problems were understandable.
Students needed to check in, which meant getting ID
cards (if they did not already have one) and their keys
before actually getting into their new homes. Unpacking
the car and moving personal belongings were made
simpler with the yellow moving carts that were provided.
For most, unpacking the boxes took longer than getting
them into their rooms. When all was done, the students
could just sit back and enjoy some of the comfort and
convenient features provided for them. Thanks to the
University Housing Services, students found resident
living to be a pleasant part of their experience at Pitt.


Above: The ID Center is a popular place to
find students during the first few days of
class. A student ID allows for many
privileges including free bus fare and meal
plan access.

Right: Yellow carts found in all dormitories
are few and far between during '"Arrival
Survival." A $20.00 deposit is required to
take them out, but they are worth their
weight in gold when a television needs to
go to your room on the 15th floor.




Below: Students from all over the country
  drive in during the first few days of class.
  Pitt Police play a major role in regulating
  traffic and helping to avoid fender benders
       on both Forbes and Fifth Avenues.

Dorm


       iving in the residence halls is
       a great way to meet other
       studlents and develop new
 friendships at the start of a college
 career. Most students living in the
 residence halls are underclassmen,
 especially freshmen, who get first
 dibs on dormitory accommoda-
 tions. For them, it's better to live
 on campus because of the much-
 needed resources and support that
 are right outside the residence hall
 door.
   Different freshmen want differ-
ent things out of their residence
hall experience, and some of them
even start to develop an affinity for
their own dorms. "Living in the
Towers is great since there is a real
community atmosphere and you get
to know the people you have classes
with or see around campus," says
one Litchfield Towers resident.
Some students feel that


L0               O
Living


   Brackenridge Hall is more in the
   middle of things. On the other
   hand, one student living in
   Sutherland Hall, also known as the
   Hotel on the Hill, told us, "It is like
   the Ritz Carlton of' the University
   of Pittsburgh. We have the best
   food and the nicest view on
   campus."
      Nobody has to live in a resi-
   dence hall, but a few students will
   stick with it through their senior
   year as resident advisers or sorori-
   ty sisters. Most will tell you that
   their choices are about conve-
   nience, but in the end, some of
   them just like the neighbors.

                          -Ian Buggs

Center: The largest dorm on
campus, the Towers, may look
intimidating from the outside, but is
where most freshmen make
life-long friends.
Below right: Laundry facilities in all
dormitories made life a little easier
for students. Even many off-campus
students brought their laundry here.






Lunchtime!


    ny student who has
        lived on campus
        would agree that the
cafeterias available at the
University of Pittsburgh
make for a memorable
experience. Students today
have access to dining halls
such as C-side, Eddie's, the
Schenley Caf6, Chick-Fil-A,
and Jock's Place. But it
wasn't always so. Before
1993, the meal serving times
were limited to 90 minutes
each breakfast, lunch, and
dinner. If students could
not find the time to eat dur-
ing that period they lost
their meal allowance.
Students were also not per-
mitted to take food back to
their dorm rooms, and
there was no food served
after 6:30 p.m. Most stu-
dents used only half of the
meals they purchased. The
success of the Schenley
Caf6, built in 1993, in the
William Pitt Union sparked


student interest in adding
more food court-style
establishments, so Eddie's
cafeteria was added in
Tower B. A new "Block"
system meal plan and the
Dining Dollars option were
added. For the first time,
somewhere on campus, a
meal could be eaten at all
hours from 7 a.m. to 10
p.m. Today, students have
a wonderful selection of
food and cafeteria choices,
flexibility in how they
spend their money, and
other great features.

         sandwiches, cheeseburgers, and

              popular items at Eddie's.
        Center: The cafeterias at Pitt serve
          not only food, but also serve as
            a place for students to catch
                    up with friends.

    free, and short, ride. For
    others it isn't so easy. It
    may mean an extended, but
    still free, bus ride from
    Monroeville, Mt. Lebanon,
    McKeesport, or the North
    Side. Then there's driving.


Above left: Commuting to and from
class was often a hassle. The
University makes every effort to
make commuting easier by making
transportation free with Pitt ID.
Center: The 7 IA was a popular
route for many students who lived
in North Oakland and beyond.
Students crammed on buses to get
from point A to point B on time.
Below right: Students often waited
up to twenty minutes for a PAT bus.


First of all, there's the issue
of having a car, which
means money. Second,
there's the issue of filling
the car with gas. Third,
there is parking, an anxi-
ety-causing word to any
commuter. Low-cost park-
ing involves finding a free
spot on a side street in
South Oakland and walking
to campus from there.
Another free pass is to park
at a broken parking meter
and affix a note informing
parking authorities that:
a) the meter does not work;
b) you would love to pay for
the parking; but c) the con-
dition of the meter makes
it impossible. The moderate
price option is a parking
permit sold by the Univer-
sity for lots on campus. If
you can't stand any of these
options, there are always
plenty of free bicycle racks
waiting on campus.

affordable prices.

Economy

        n Thursday nights, many Pitt students are found
        at Mad Mex taking advantage of the Mexican
        restaurant's half price menu and unmatched
atmosphere after eleven. The Beehive, an old movie
theater located on Forbes, attracts students because of its
extremely avant-garde coffeehouse atmosphere. Movies
are still served there along with the coffee, and discount-
ed matinee tickets are available for movies showing before
6 p.m. Upstairs from the Beehive, the Pollinator Lounge,
open 11 a.m. to 2 a.m., offers sandwiches and a dance
floor where DJs feature techno music.
   As a new addition to the Oakland area, Starbucks has
become a popular hangout for Pitt students. Located on
Forbes Avenue, Starbucks sponsors special activities
during the week. On Tuesday nights at nine, Starbucks
holds open microphone for poetry reading. The coffee-
house also hosts the occasional live music performance
with local talent. Pitt students also love Fuel and Fuddle,
or more importantly, its food. The restaurant with a gas
station motif and wood fired pizza ovens has the best food
in Oakland according to Pitt News readers.
   Finally, Oakland can claim one of the nation's best col-
lege bars. A national survey sponsored by Beyond the
Wall, a poster company, and printed in Playboy, ranked
the Attic as one of the top 100 college bars in America.
The Attic's many televisions, pool tables, and dartboards
figured heavily in its selection.

My Own



Place


       inally! That is the cry of most students who live off
       campus. After putting in their two or three years
       of campus housing, most Pitt students look to move
off campus.
   Instead of being assigned to live with some stranger,
they can pick their own roommates. On top of that, and
though it does get really cold when they have to walk
great distances to class, a majority of off-campus students
like the fact they do not have to swipe ID cards, sign in
guests, and have limitations on what they can do in their
rooms.
   There is abundant freedom in having one's own place,
and there is quite a bit of responsibility to go along with
it. There are bills to pay, bathrooms to clean, and
groceries to buy. With those groceries, they can make
their own meals instead of settling for cafeteria food,
though off-campus students often gripe that it would be
a lot easier to have food already prepared.
   Deciding to move off campus is a big decision that
makes students mature very quickly, and it can be one of
the greatest adventures of college life.

Semester at Sea


PITT


GOES


SOVERBO ARD


    n every student's college career
    there is the opportunity to live in
    dormitories or in an off-campus
apartment, but what most students
don't know about is the opportunity to
live on water. The Semester at Sea
program here at the University of
Pittsburgh gives students the opportu-
nity to experience college from all
angles of the world-literally. In past
years, the S.S. Universe Explorer has
visited places such as Hong Kong;
Rome, Italy; Salvador, Brazil; Ho Chi
Minh City, Vietnam; and more.
   The floating campus is comprised of
approximately 600 students from col-
leges and universities across the coun-
try. Senior Jenny Booker took the voy-
age in the fall semester of her sopho-
more year. She says, "I remember so


much from the trip, it's hard to
describe in words all the life changing
experiences I was brought into."
   In the spring of 1999, students of the
program attempted to live a normal col-
lege life while being filmed for national
television. The crew of MTV's popular
show Road Rules chose six students
from different schools to attempt vari-
ous adventures in foreign lands. The
TV crew was constantly on board which
meant that at any point, you could have
been caught on tape!
   The whole mission of Semester at
Sea is to expose students to different
cultures while combining academic
challenges along the way. Semester at
Sea is a life changing experience that
broadens the mind and overwhelms the
imagination.

Greek



Week

When college students hear the word Greeks, we

          do not always associate it with community ser-
          vice. However, at the University of Pittsburgh,
the fraternities and sororities of the Greek system partici-
pate in Greek Week, a community service project. This
year marks the sixteenth year for Greek Week at Pitt.
The money raised from this year's Greek Week was
donated to Ronald McDonald House at Children's
Hospital of Pittsburgh to renovate the hospital's seventh
floor. Children's Hospital plans to make the floor a place
where impoverished families of terminally ill children can
spend as much precious time together as possible.
   Of course, Greek Week is about more than charity.
Most of the activities are contests, and some sororities
and fraternities are very competitive about winning Greek
Week. The Delta Delta Delta sorority has won Greek
Week fourteen out of the last fifteen years.
   The events occur every fall and spring. In the fall this
year, the scheduled events spread out over two weeks,
with the Greek Olympiad, comedy night, blood drive,
and the 3K-5K walk/run. Spring events included Greek
Sing, the Greek God/Goddess, and the Brother and
Sister Auction.

-Angie Guldin


Above: The 3K/5K run/walk is an annual
event held during Greek Week. Students
wake up early to face the usually cold
weather to run or walk for charity.
Right: The keg roll is part of the Greek
Olympiad. A team of two, usually one
sorority and one fraternity, get together
with broom sticks to see who can roll the
empty keg up and down the hill the fastest

Women


    he twelve sororities on
       campus do more than con-
       tribute their time and energy
to the overall improvement of the
charities of their choice, they bene-
fit the University of Pittsburgh as a
whole. In 1998, the Panhellenic
Association won the award for
Overall Sorority Excellence in the
Northeastern United States. The
award recognized the outstanding
efforts for recruitment, programs,
leadership and service of sororities
here on campus. The Panhellenic
Association along with the
Interfraternity Council work
together to coordinate philanthrop-
ic and community service efforts.
   Sororities have come a long way
over the years. They are now well
recognized as an integral part of
the Greek community where in
much earlier times they were not.
   Greek women on campus are


still not allowed to live together in
an independent house after a law in
Pennsylvania was passed several
years ago banning it. Kappa
Kappa Gamma and Kappa Alpha
Theta are two sororities who beat
the laws by having the house built
before the law was passed. These
sororities enjoy the comforts of
their own off-campus housing on
Bayard Street with cooks and
cleaning services, while all other
sororities live in Amos Hall, a
university owned dormitory. It is
now their job to keep enrollment
high and spirits uplifted so that
they can keep their time-honored
houses off campus.
   Sororities' efforts here at the
University of Pittsburgh are
irreplaceable and their accomplish-
ments will always be rewarded on
this campus.

My Old



Frat

Along with the Panhellenic Association, the

        Interfraternity Council (IFC) works hard to
        promote Greek life here at the University of
Pittsburgh. All eighteen fraternities on campus take part
in various philanthropic events around the Pittsburgh
area, while keeping the good name that their founding
brothers established for them so many years ago.
   Unity and friendship are both a part of the Greek life
on campus. As housemates, fraternity brothers develop
bonds that last well past the college years. Most of the
fraternities occupy University-owned housing. These
fraternity houses can be seen on what students call "the
hill" on University Drive. Several houses not owned by
the University are located off campus in old Victorian
homes in North Oakland.
   The brothers of each fraternity play together as well as
live together, especially during Greek Week. Greek Week
is a celebration designed to raise money for less fortunate
people andi have fun doing it. Activities include a Greek
God and Goddess Contest, 5K run, (lance marathon,
chariot race, and Greek Sing. These activities are time
consuming, but worth every minute. Fraternities around
campus dedicate their time to philanthropic events while
still having fun.

Student



Government Board


he purpose of the
       Student Government
       Board is to promote
the concerns, interests,
needs, and welfare of the
undergraduate student
body here at the University
of Pittsburgh. There is a
great concern about the
representation of individual
student groups in campuses
as large as Pitt's. With
George Mongell as
President of such a promi-
nent student group in 1999
and board members who
were just as critical,
students could rest assured
that they were in the hands
of experienced profession-
als-in-training.
   Elections for the board
and for the presidency are
an important part of
campus life. Hundreds of
students wait to vote for the
candidate of their choice on
election day, while members
of the candidate's cam-


paigns hand out flyers and
candy to voting students.
   Once elected, SGB
members have the responsi-
bility of allocating student
activity fees to student
groups and events, working
with the Pittsburgh
Project, doing a Pitt Pride
campaign, and much more.
We, as students, put our
trust in the most powerful
governmental student orga-
nization on campus, and
each year they bring orga-
nized and well thought out

WPTS - FM




VOICE


OF


PITTSBURGH


T wenty-four hours a (lay,
      WPTS-FM Pittsburgh offers
      a great mix of rock, techno,
urban, jazz, retro, oldies, metal
anti others for the students of the
University of' Pittsburgh. 92.1 FM
is where students can turn for an
interesting change of pace on the
radio dial. There are many special-
ty programs after hours where
students get a better taste of the
diverse culture here in Pittsburgh.
It took many hours of planning anti
research to get FM status an(d the
results show year round.
   In the late '70s, WPTS had a
difficult time transforming from an
AM carrier, which could only be
heard in the William I)itt Union and


  dormitories, to a non-commercial
  FM frequency. Now WPTS is heard
  within a 15-mile radius from the
  Cathedral of Learning because of
  the dedication of the students.
     Located in the William Pitt
  Union, WPTS counts coverage of all
  University sports and local andi
  national news stories among its
  many entertaining aspects. Because
  of the diverse staff, it is easy for
  WPTS to have a well-rounded blend
  of entertainment for everyone to
  enjoy. WPTS is a formatted
  college-radio station p)roviding
  professional sound while keeping a
  working classroom atmosp)here.
  Many former students now work at
  CBS Records, KDKA-TV, WTAE-
  TV, WYMG-FM, and many other
  stations across the United States.

Campu,


t's the pastime favored by
    students as we wait for our
    professors to arrive. Absorbing
knowledge doesn't always come
from notes and lectures; in fact,
some of the most useful reading
comes from the publication we all
page through everyday, our very
own The Pitt News.
   Student-written andl student-
managed, The Pitt News is one of
the most recognizable institutions
on campus. We all pick it up at
some point during the (day to find
out what the Chancellor is up to,
what SGB is discussing, who is
being sued or impeached, and (of'
course) for the crossword puzzle!
Everyone eagerly reached for the
paper last year to check on the
developments of the . .. um . . .
vandal in Hillman Library. Not to
mention the draw of the entertain-
ing sports pages and engaging

entertainment reviews.
   But behind the headlines and
class distractions, our school paper
is a thriving business and learning
environment. Would-be journalists
are given experience writing,
reporting, and editing articles, an(l
students are involved in most facets
of the business world. Ad sales,
business management, anti
accounts receivable are all manned
by students at The Pitt News.
Students even assist in the layout
and design of the paper, gaining
valuable training in graphics by
helping to publish 14,000 copies
five days a week.
   A valuable resource on which to
draw for experience anti knowl-
edge, The Pitt News continues to
cover Oakland and the University
for the students of Pitt.

                          A Message

from the Chancellor


The class of 2000 stands at a unique
       point in history. You started college
       in the last century of the second mil-
lennium; you start your careers in the world
in the first century of the third millennium.
You were the first of a new kind of student,
attuned to a globally-connected new world.
   When you started at Pitt your syllabi were
printed on paper; before you finished you were
reading them on line. You were among the earli-
est to use e-mail to query your profs, swap ideas
in chat rooms, and make dates.
  You used the World Wide Web to search
libraries across the world and to find like-minded
students to advance your causes. And you have
had important causes. Alternative Spring Break
saw you building trails in national parks and
houses for the poor in rural areas. Here at home
you've helped change the face of Oakland,
tutored kids in reading, and worked for peace
and justice in inner city areas. You helped create
the free bus program through which we embrace
all of Pittsburgh as our campus. And you were
the first group to invade local arts performances
and exhibits, in great numbers - and relish the
experiences.
   Everything you have learned here is a mere
beginning for a lifetime of learning. We are
proud of what you have accomplished. We will


continue to take pride in all that you are going to
accomplish in the years ahead: success in careers,
in family life, in contributions to communities
and causes. We hope that what you've learned
and experienced here will help you to stay con-
nected to the University throughout your lifelong
ventures.
   This book, filled with essays by your peers and
photos of your experiences, is meant to help keep
that connection alive. It, too, is unique: the first
three-way partnership among the Student
Government, the Alumni Association, and the
University administration to produce such a
keepsake. It is meant to be emblematic of the
lifelong partnership forged between you and your
University. You are forever part of the fabric of
Pitt's history. We hope that Pitt will forever be a
part of your life, that you will continue your par-
ticipation is the vastly exciting enterprise that in
the University of Pittsburgh in the 21st Century.

      -RENT, The Musical

      From Animal Rights Activists to
    the Save Our Stadium campaign,
    student activism on campus is a
    prevalent part of college life. And
    social concerns are heightened in a
    school located within a major U.S.
    city. Our University and its
    community have done more than
    speak out on a variety of topics,
    but two of the most vocal
    organizations on campus are the
    Rainbow Alliance and the Campus
    Women's Organization.
       The Rainbow Alliance is devot-
    ed to Pitt's lesbian, bisexual, gay,
    and transgendered (LBGT) commu-
    nity on and off campus. The group
    ensures a positive environment for

LBGT students by communicating
with the University, its administra-
tion and faculty, and fellow stu-
dents. Creating a network of sup-
port and increasing awareness of
not only homophobia, but also
racism and biases based on ethnic
or religious affiliations is overseen
by the group with events like Gay
Jeans Day, rallies, workshops, and
political lobby visits. The Rainbow
Alliance also organized the AIDS
Quilt being brought to Pitt, as well
as a World AIDS Day and a benefit
concert in early December.
   The Campus Women's
Organization (CWO) also advocates
equal rights and a society not
biased on gender. Keeping the Pitt
women of today informed of key
issues is a vital part of the CWO.
Events sponsored by the CWO
include Diversity Week in
November, regular discussions on
such topics as Women in the
Workplace, and a March Against
Rape.
   All of Pitt's vocal organizations
excel at bringing attention to the
important issues of our time, and
their members are sure to succeed
in shaping this country's future.

The

Plays On...

          hat would a Panthers football game be without
          the cheerful music and moving spirit of the
          impressive University of Pittsburgh Marching
Band? The talented band sparks a remarkable feeling of
energy in the crowd, excites the loyal fans, and helps
cheer on our beloved Panthers. Their upbeat music,
lively attitude, and vibrant uniforms assist in creating
that energetic atmosphere that both the Panthers and
their adoring fans find electrifying. The moment before
the game begins, when the smoke billows onto the field
and the band runs out in a beautiful pattern, is an
exhilarating occasion for all fans.
   The 200-member marching band that plays in the
stadium today has come a long way from the eight-man
group that made up the very first University of
Pittsburgh band in 1911. The band's first appearance
was at the Pitt-Ohio Northern game in the team's 22nd
football season. This first band played on seven
borrowed instruments and wore uniforms that consisted
of scarlet felt caps with blue tassels. Organized by Dr.
Earl Miller and James G. Oliver, with student leader Carl
Sabad, this band began a wonderful tradition for the
University of Pittsburgh.
   Under the guidance of Director of Bands Jack
Anderson and Drum Major Pete Chambers, the band
today is a significant part of the Panthers experience.
The legacy of the distinguished University of Pittsburgh
Marching Band is one that no student or fan will forget.

          The Pitt Cheerleading Squad! From well
          before kickoff until game's end, they spur on
the Panthers fans and keep the crowd going.
   At football games and other varsity sporting events,
the cheerleaders bring their school spirit and Pitt pride to
the fans and get them involved in the game. From their
rousing cheers to the exciting acrobatic feats on the
sidelines, the cheerleaders show the true spirit of the
12th Man.
   But it is not just a lot of lifting, cheering, flipping, and
dancing. The cheerleaders put in hours of dedicated
practice to make new routines and perfect old ones.
Their hard work truly pays off as, game in and game out,
Pitt students are kept on their feet, cheering, losing their
voices, and having a great time. The energy and passion
for their school is a great example that leads us in sup-
porting Pitt and all it has to offer. So to the cheerleading
squad we say, "Go P! Go I. Go P-I Double T!"

       ished the 1999 sea-
son 5-6, one game short of
bowl eligibility, while saying
good-bye to 74-year old Pitt
Stadium with an emotional
defeat of an old rival.
   Beginning with a strong
30-10 win over Mid-
American Conference foe
Bowling Green, the
Panthers then traveled to
Happy Valley to face the
number two Nittany Lions.
Pitt played its cross state
rival close the whole game,
losing on a last-second
LaVar Arington field goal
block. Pitt quarterback
John Turman completed 19
passes for 316 yards and
earned co-Big East
Offensive Player of the
Week honor.
   October 2nd brought
Homecoming and the
Temple Owls to town. Pitt
got off to a 14-3 first quar-


ter lead and never looked
back. Latef Grim, Kirk
McMullen and freshmen
Antonio Bryant and Lamar
Slade all scored touch-
downs in the 55-24 Pitt
romp.
   The climax of the season
came with the final game to
be held in Pitt Stadium.
The Panthers closed it out
in grand fashion among
fireworks and hoopla with
a 37-27 win over long-time
rival Notre Dame. Despite
the high from this exciting
finale, the Panthers lost
their last game on the road,
to West Virginia, ending
their bowl hopes.

    he city was our campus!
      We swam in its public
      pools and rowed on its
 rivers. We shopped its shops,
 hiked its trails, and occasion-
 ally paid its parking tickets.
 Mostly though, we learned.
    We learned that working
 to make the world a better
 place doesn't guarantee suc-
 cess. We figured out, some of
 us in art history and some in
 neurobiology, that the human
 mind is very complicated. We
 watched the people of the sur-
 rounding county peacefully
 overthrow a form of govern-
 ment that had existed for a
 century or more. We now
 know that planets exist
 around other stars, that the
 basics of life exist on Mars,
 and that airplanes alone can
 win wars. We know you can
 make an artificial lung, double
 bus ridership by making it
 free, and beat Notre Dame at
 football even if the press says
 you're the worst team in
 America. Most of all, we
 learned that the world needs
 us. It needs our ideas and our
 strength, and it needs every-
 thing we learned.
   This is Pittsburgh. It's
been our home and our cam-
pus. It isn't the world, but
you can see the world from
here. Tomorrow we're going to
go out into the world and try
to make it a better place.
Success is not guaranteed, but
don't bet against us.









GOODBYE




MY FRIENb


      an you hear it? Can you feel
      it inside of you? Can you see
      it? It is the glory and history
of Pitt Stadium. For seventy-four
years, Pitt Stadium was home to the
Pitt Panthers football team. It saw
national championships, countless
memorable plays and players, and
some of the best fans in the Big
East. There was an air of sadness
on November 13, 1999, yet excite-
ment at the same time. Students
past and present knew that the
Stadium was seeing its final game,
but they all looked forward to the
future of Pitt football. The half-
time presentation filled with
confetti bombs, fireworks, former
athletes, cheerleaders, and l,and


  members gave us all a sense of what
  was. Meanwhile, the football team
  was battling with Notre Dame to
  end the Panther tenure at the stadi-
  um with a bang. Pompons in hand,
  the fans cheered the Panthers to a
  victory against Notre Dame, 37-27.
  As the fans surged toward the field
  with minutes to go in the game,
  there was a sense of togetherness
  among students and everyone in the
  stadium. Even before the clock ran
  out, there were thousands of fans
  on the field attacking the goal posts
  in a timeless ritual of football
  celebration. The dlay was going to
  be remembered by everyone who
  was in attendance and everyone
  walked away with a piece of the
  stadlium embedlde,d in their pockets
  or their minds. Gone is the old. On
  to the new!

From the



Field house


The University of
       Pittsburgh is well
       known for its sports
teams, including the men's
basketball team. Each
year, the team begins with
an uproarious celebration.
On Friday, October 15,
1999, the University of
Pittsburgh tipped off the
1999-2000 basketball season
first with a pep rally in the
Schenley Quadrangle, then
a Midnight Madness cele-
bration in the Fitzgerald
Fieldhouse.
   Student groups and
organizations sponsor the
Basketball Fan Fest Pep
Rally, but the main attrac-
tion of the night is the
Midnight Madness celebra-
tion. This large event
signifies the start of the new
basketball season because
it is when the basketball
teams can officially begin
practice.
   A local swing band, Dr.


Zoot, commenced the
evening's activities with a
performance at 10:30 p.m.
Throughout the evening,
audience members had the
opportunity to take part in
various contests and chal-
lenges to win assorted
prizes. WTAE-TV's Andrew
Stockey, the Panther Pep
Band, and the Panther
Cheerleaders all made spe-
cial appearances. Madness
ensued when the Panthers
basketball teams were
introduced at midnight.

Women of



the Court


       he women's basketball team was coming off a sea-
       son in which it finished 9-16 and lost its last 10
       games. In 1998-99, the Panthers did beat top 25
Penn State and won the inaugural Pittsburgh invitational.
   Optimism was high for the 1999-2000 season due to the
return of key players, as well as the addition of many
fresh faces. Gina Montesano returned to spark the
Panthers to early wins after missing the 1998-99 campaign
because of knee surgery. Monique Toney, Jackie
Campbell, Nickeia Morris and Michelle Katkowski also
returned for the Panthers. Katkowski remained in her
defensive hustle role while freshmen Laine Selwyn and
Mandy Wittenmyer started early in the season. Local
high school standout Brooke Stewart also joined the
Panthers, offering the team an offensive spark.
   Head coach Traci Waites entered her second year and
her first with her own recruiting class. She replaced Kirk
Bruce before the start of the 1998-99 campaign. The
Panthers had their work cut out for them with such a
young team that was just getting into Waites' "D-squared"
philosophy of discipline and defense. Waites hoped that
her strong recruiting class was a sign of things to come
but also admitted that it is tough to rebuild a program,
especially having to use so many freshmen.
   Still the excitement built, and for this season, the
Panthers came out to roar.

Boys of Not-




Quite-Summer


       he 1999 University of Pittsburgh baseball team
       completed a very impressive season last year
       and is sure to do the same in the 2000 season.
They have succeeded in becoming a superior baseball
team and have managed to overcome their disadvantage
of having to practice indoors, unlike the southern teams,
which can practice in warm, comfortable weather from
the beginning of the season.
   Beginning in January, the Panthers baseball team has
a maximum of twenty-one weeks of practice, sixteen
during the actual competing season. This means that the
baseball team has five weeks of practice before they begin
to compete. While they may have to practice indoors at
first, once the snow melts, the Panthers have the newly
renovated Trees Field. Located behind the Cost Sports
Center, Trees Field is the official home of the University
of Pittsburgh baseball team. The park has undergone
over $500,000 worth of renovations, which included
installing a brand new, major league-caliber Astroturf
infield and a state-of-the-art lighting system. Also, Trees
Field is now connected to two all-purpose Astroturf fields,
allowing for extra practice space.
   Trees Field gives the Panthers a chance to catch up on
their outdoor practice, and with all the new additions, the
Panthers have no problem adjusting to the outdoor fields.
This northern baseball team will definitely be one for the
southern teams to watch out for.

  he alarm goes off at 5 a.m., perhaps earlier. No

       need to shower. Just going to get filthy dirty or
       soaking wet anyway. Practice starts at 6 a.m.
Being late is not an option. While the University sleeps,
these women are pushing their muscles and determination
to their limits. They will endure at least two hours of
practice, then begin their day as students. For many,
classes are scheduled around practice and games. Some
may practice again in the afternoon, or perhaps spend
time weight training. Practice is just the beginning for
these women, whose weekends are not relaxing.
Weekends are the time for games, some on campus, and
others requiring long weekend trips to other states.
   The University sponsors eight varsity women's sports
teams, but more opportunities exist on campus in the
form of intramurals or clubs. These vary from all-female
teams such as the Panthers lacrosse or ice hockey teams
to coed activities like intramural soccer. "I'm the only
girl on my intramural soccer team," says Heather Vitelli.
She's also the captain, serving multiple functions such as
organizing playing times and bandaging injuries. In
essence, women have the same competitive spirit, the
same drive, determination, and energy, and last but not
least, the same abilities. The difference lies in the fans.
As Pitt continues to expand their sports options, perhaps,
one (lay, all of Oakland will hear cheering from the future
convocation center as a woman Panther makes the
winning score.

Riparian Rhythms


Try this schedule on for size:
       Wake up at 5 a.m. to he at
       your daily workout Iy 5:30.
Train for two solid hours, then off
to brealkfast, then back to bed to
get a few more hours' sleep before
a full (lay of classes. Then back
home to get school work done, din-
ner eaten, and maybe a little social
time before an early bedtime to do
it again the next (lay. And that's
only the winter schedule.
   During the season, Pitt's crew
team devotes their time and hodies
to training and l)replaring for their
big races. At 4:30 a.m., a run of
three miles to the boathouse starts
the (lay. Three hours of' rowing on
the water follow. The preparation
for the race culminates as the team
p)iles into the van Friday night for a
trip that could be as long as seven
hours to PIhiladellphia or
Washington D.C. After a long


Saturday of racing, the team drives
hack to Pittsburgh Saturday night.
   The long (lays and early training
sessions are worth the effort. As
with any sport, members of the
crew team demonstrate stamina,
strength, and smarts as they keep
up, with the busy pace of balancuing
college work and a commitment to
athletics.

You hear them chant,
       "Deer Head! Deer
       Head!" at the foot-
ball games. You may be sur-
prised, but the guys chant-
ing are Pitt's rugby team.
The (leer head is the way
the rugby team shows its
support for the football
team. Why a deer head?
The head is the deer head
that once belonged to the
Penn State rugby team.
   In 1 997, when our rugby
team was (lone with a long
(lay of playing, they were in
the PSU rugby house sip-
ping on a few cold ones.
They saw the (leer head
an(d, after some quick
thinking, threw it out the
window, later retrieving it
from a )hush below. From
then on, the (leer head has
been the team's mascot, fol-
lowing them everywhere.
   This past season has
Ibeen full of great accom-
pllishmients. For the first


time in Pitt history, the
rugby team went to the
Mid-Western Union play-
offs with the help of return-
ing seniors Jason
Vlikowski, Andrew Smith,
and Brad Wuerstle. This
sport is not only for the
men at Pitt. Women too
can take up the sport
through the city team, the
Angels. And these women
are no powder puffs, win-
ning six games this fall and
losing one.
   Whether you are chanti-
ng "Deer Head!" or playing
with the Angels, it definite-
ly takes leather balls to
play Pitt rugby.

          -Lisa Anne Miller

        Above Right: The Pitt rugby team
        puts great effort into each game.
        Here, they take a break so that they
        are in top form for the opponent.
        Center: The rugby team goes head
        to head, literally, with Penn State.
        Below Left: The rugby team is easily
        identifiable at all sporting events by
              the deer head on a stick.

Alternative Sports






   Iternative sports are a great way for students to get involved ath-
       letically on campus. From ultimate Frisbee to Mai Tai, these
       unusual games allow Pitt students to find underappreciated com-
petitions that suit their tastes.
   Ultimate Frisbee teams are often found on the Cathedral lawn looking
for an opponent. The team's willingness to explain the rules of the game is
still an important part of recruiting new players. As a sophomore, I was a
willing new inductee to an Air Force ROTC team that needed a few extra
bodies. The team wasn't too proud to find us throwing a disk back and
forth (with little purpose) in the shadow of Heinz Chapel. For those of us
who had never played this strenuous and exciting marriage of football
and Frisbee, it was a challenge, but one that left us satisfied. Most college
sports start out this way, with little groups of devotees playing pick up.
Later they become club sports, and if they prosper they become varsity
athletics.

Glory





   he's like the wind. Not the gentle softness of a tran-

      quil breeze that rustles the leaves on a tree some
      spring afternoon. Not the warm wisp of air that
brushes your forehea(l during a lazy morning on the
beach. Not even the crisp breath of Jack Frost that
swirls past your window and dances with the snowflakes.
This is a full-force, hard core, ain't-no-stoppin-it gust of
wind with the intensity of a quiet tornado. It's determi-
nation antd duration. It's skill and speed. It's Trecia-
Kaye Smith.
   And Trecia pretty much does it all. She's a first year
graduate student here at the University of Pittsburgh who
left her native home in Jamaica to attend school in the
United States. Her course load includes a concentration
in Physical Therapy in which she is pursuing a degree.
Classes take up most of her morning andl in the afternoon
you can find her putting in time at the Track and Field
office where she works.
   Oh yes, that's right...Trecia runs track. People say
she's pretty good too. Did we mention she's IN TRAIN-
ING FOR THE OLYMPICS? You have read correctly
ladies and( gentlemen. Students at Pitt, we have a star in
our midst. Trecia-Kaye Smith is looking forward to an
intense July tryout where she and others will vie for a
spot on the 2000 Olympic team. Trecia competes in the
heptathlon, an athletic event for women comprising seven
(lifferent track and field events. She is seen as a para-
(ligm of talent and dedtication by her teammates as well as
her coach, Steve Lewis. All of Pittsburgh wishes her luck
as she attempts to use her gifts in a quest for Olympic
glory.

Famous Pitt



Graduates

   he University of Pittsburgh, with a storied past of

       over 200 years, has had countless students wander
       its hallowed halls. Each of those students has
their own stories. Who knows everything that has gone
on inside of the Cathedral of Learning? And for each
graduate of Pitt, there has been a special pride in know-
ing that they have done what many great men and women
have (lone before them, a special type of pride that no one
else can understand, let alone someone who graduated
from that school in Happy Valley. We're talking Panther
Pride. Every graduate of the University of Pittsburgh
takes that Panther Pride along with him or her into the
world, carrying it the rest of his or her life.
   For me, some of the more memorable graduates who
carried or still carry that pride with them include Gene
Kelly, Mike Ditka, Dan Marino, and Myron Cope.
Everyone here should know these four men. Gene Kelly
was one of the greatest Hollywood actor/dancer/singer/
directors of all time. Mike Ditka, a former Panther, went
on to be one of the greatest players ever to be in the
National Football League. Dan Marino, a Pittsburgh boy,
born and raised in Oakland, was Panther quarterback in
the 1980s, and one of the greatest QBs to play the in the
NFL. And who could forget legendary Pittsburgh Steelers
sportscaster Myron Cope? Myron gave us the Terrible
Towel in the Terry Bradshaw-era, called each and every
Steeler-won Super Bowl, and still in the '90s called the
games.

-Dan Kostolec


Above: Popular Pittsburgh sports radio and
television personality, Myron Cope got his
start here at Pitt. Cope brought us the eve
famous Terrible Towel that will live on in
Steeler history.
Center: Dan Marino, former Pittsburgh
Panthers football player moved on from
college football in the '80s to the profession
leagues with the Miami Dolphins, where he
was one of the greatest quarterbacks in the
NFL. He retired in 2000.

  12th Man






  he final season of football at Pitt Stadium has come to an end. Our
       laughter, our energetic cries for the next first down, and our tears
       are now contained in a small wooden box. The 12th Man was a
spirit-filled part of every student's life that will stay in the hearts of the
fans and players for years to come.
   The final game at Pitt Stadium versus Notre Dame was an emotion-
filled roller coaster for many student fans. The goalposts came tumbling
down within seconds of the last play. Pieces of turf now belong to under-
graduates who wanted to keep a part of Pitt Stadium close to their hearts.
We were a part of the team as the 12th Man, donning our T-shirts that
said so. We were the screams that filled the stadium. We were the
strength in victory and the cries in defeat.
   The 12th Man will live on in the hearts of many Pitt students for years
to come. With plans for a new stadium come plans for student spirit,
which is the true heart of Pitt football.

Internships


      n internship is a big
      factor in determin-
      ing a student's
career. It gives a student
the opportunity to get
hands-on experience in the
field they will eventually
work in. From editing to
autopsies, we all must
attempt our future careers
during our undergraduate
years. Although the
descriptions may be fright-
ening, and the new environ-
ment may seem uncomfort-
able, the end result is more
experience in the field and a
positive outlook on the
future.
   The Career and
Placement Services Center
is a place that offers advice
for students who are look-
ing to add this aspect to
their degree. Advisers are
available with the most up
to (late information about
helpful and popular intern-
ships around the Pittsburgh


area and beyond. Students
can also make appoint-
ments for assistance in
resume writing and inter-
view techniques where
advisers perform one-on-
one mock interviews.
   The University of
Pittsburgh offers a variety
of internships throughout
the year, making this aspect
of education just that much
more enjoyable and educa-
tional for the students.

Volunteers


s there really any student who
    didn't need money this year at
    school? Many students work
for their money. If it isn't a regu-
lar job or internship, it may be a
work-study program. However,
there are those jobs on and off
campus that don't pay.
  Volunteers are needed for these
jobs, and for many different
reasons, these positions are filled
each and every semester. Volunteer
positions range from business to
food services, but the majority of
the positions are in the health
sciences; there are so many things
that always need to be done.
  There are volunteering positions
available from the UPMC Health
System for those who want to help
all semester, or there are one-time
positions available from the
Student Volunteer Outreach
Program. The University Honors


College has volunteers at all the
football games to help out local
vendors.
   These are only a sampling of the
many options available, all of
which are great ways to become
involved on campus. You can
never forget the face of the children
at Children's Hospital when you go
and spend the day playing with
them, or when a harried physical
therapy staff thanks you just for

       n advertisement in the classifieds reads, "a person needed with
       job experience and bachelor's degree in...." Unlike many college
       students who enter the work force without having experience,
nursing and occupational therapy graduates at the University of
Pittsburgh collect valuable experience during their stay here. The cur-
riculums of nursing and occupational therapy require clinicals: opportu-
nities to integrate and apply previously acquired knowledge to actual job
settings.
   In the School of Nursing, sophomores spend the first year of clinicals
focusing on adult care. During junior year, the curriculum focuses on the
care of maternity, pediatric, medical-surgical, and gerontologic patients.
In the senior year, clinicals emphasize community health care, gerontolog-
ic, psychiatric, critical care, and applications of research findings. In the
School of Health and Rehabilitation Sciences Department of Occupational
Therapy, clinicals are called "field work," and they are required for all
occupational therapy students. After graduating from college, Pitt's
nursing and occupational therapy students not only enter the job market
with valuable experience that places them ahead of the game, but are also
much sought after assets in the medical field.

Time to Take


Break


      here are many ways to take
      a break from classes in
      Pittsburgh. A day in
Schenley Park, visiting the plane-
tarium at the Carnegie Science
Center, or even just sitting in front
of the digital cable are relaxing
enough for some. Come March
however, there is a different locale
for relaxation: THE BEACH!
Many Pitt students make plans as
early as October for their spring
break trips. If you have the
money, Panama Beach, Daytona,
or somewhere international could
be in your future.
  Pitt Program Council sponsors
an annual trip so students can get
hotel stays and airline rates at
affordable prices. Most trips range
from $300 to $700 dollars, so stu-
dents often have to start saving
their pennies in the fall or pray
that Santa Claus will give them fun


in the sun for the holidays.
  The beach is a fun place for stu-
dents to get together and relax over
spring break, but some students
decide to take an alternate route.
By putting their efforts toward a
good cause, such as working on a
Habitat for Humanity project,
many find volunteer work as
rewarding as any day at the beach.
At the other end of the stress
spectrum, ROTC units go through
intense training while on recess
from classes.
  No matter what, the time stu-
dents spend away from their classes
is well deserved, and you can be
sure that when finals roll around,
they'll wish they were back on
break.
             -Corrine Rushkowski


Above left: Spring Break is a time to
spend with loved ones. Some
students spend hours, even days on
buses to have a few days with family
and friends.

fun in the sun. These students
take a time out for rest and
relaxation before the night time
festivities begin.

It's 0630...





Attention!


        ore PT, Drill Sergeant,
        More PT! We like it! We
        love it! We want more!
   These words can be heard every
morning at any U.S. Army training
facility anywhere in the country.
   However, on any given Monday,
Wednesday, or Friday, and even
the occasional Thursday, you can
hear them being spoken right here
in Oakland. They're shouted by
the University of Pittsburgh's very
own Army Reserve Officer Training
Corps (ROTC) cadets.
  Every Monday, Wednesday and
Friday at 0630 (that's 6:30 a.m. to
all of you civilians) the future
officers of the United States Army
go through their morning physical
training, or "PT," which includes
pushups, sit-ups, side straddle hops
(jumping jacks to you), and a nice
long run. And on one Thursday of
each month, they go through a


Leadership Lab, in which they
study rifle marksmanship,
rappelling, or even get in an extra
day of PT.
  Why do they do it? For some,
it's because they want to be an
officer in the Army. For others,
it's a great way to pay for school.
But one thing that they all have in
common is dedication.
  So the next time you're out and
about at 6:30 a.m. (that's 0630 for
all of you military types), wave
hello to the cadets of the Army
ROTC. They're your neighbors
and classmates, and they could be
the best friends you'll ever make.

                   -Dan Kostolec

No Class








       o go to class or not to go to class...that's the age-
       old question of Pitt students. When in class, stu-
       dents have an intense fifty minutes of note taking
and active participation, so when the teaching's done it's
time for a little R&R.
   While not in class, students can always find things to
do on and around campus. Phipps Conservatory offers
free tours of their greenhouse throughout the year where
students can come to look at their beautiful collection of
flowers and plants. The Cathedral lawn often looks like a
beach when the weather is warm with students playing
volleyball or Frisbee to release some unwanted stress.
   If sports is on your "things to do around Pittsburgh"
list, the Penguins offer student rush tickets for just $12.
When hockey is out of season, concerts are in. The
Mellon Arena, and clubs like Graffiti in North Oakland,
offer concerts year round, at affordable prices so stu-
dents can feel better about that general education class
they're missing.
   There is nothing like seeing the look on a student's
face when there is a sign on the class door that says
"canceled." It's kind of like a young child on Christmas
morning. The only difference is that students will proba-
bly go back to bed after getting their surprise. Whether
touring Oakland or exploring the outskirts, students
always justify ways to have no class.

A Little



Class


             any students from
             outside of the
             Pittsburgh area
    may wonder, Is there life
    outside of Oakland?
       "There definitely is!"
    says senior Libby Selyak.
    She has gotten lost on a city
    bus on purpose just to see
    what she can find. She's
    never had to go far.
    Pittsburgh boasts the
    cultural amenities of a city
    twice its size. The random
    bus approach might bring
    you to The Mattress
    Factory on the North Side,
    Pittsburgh's home of the
    Avant Garde, or it might

lead you to the Crawford
Grille in the Hill District,
for decades the place to be
for jazz.
   But if serendipity was
never your event planner,
you could always rely on
the Pitt Arts Program and
its guide. Listing events as
diverse as the Carnegie
Science Center's Pink Floyd
laser light show and the
Pittsburgh Ballet Theatre
1999 offering, Dracula, the
guide is a prime list of
things to do.
   This year, staying off the
random bus would have
brought you to the most
exciting cultural event in
Pittsburgh. The Carnegie
International 1999-2000
opened its doors in
November of 1999, right
across the street from the
Cathedral of Learning.
That's right. In Oakland.

Budget



Under $10


       he University of Pittsburgh has thousands of stu-
       dents with different likes and dislikes, but one
       thing is for sure, no matter how different, we all
like to have fun. The city provides the opportunity for
students to entertain themselves after a stressful day of
classes. From going out to eat to going to a museum, Pitt
students can choose from a wide variety of activities that
won't leave them short of cash. All around campus and
the city of Pittsburgh, students with a mere $10 and their
Pitt ID will find something exciting to do.
   The most popular places to find Pitt students eating
are The Original Hotdog Shop, Pamela's Restaurant,
Yum Wok, and Fuel 'n Fuddle. Then students might stop
by Dave and Andy's Ice Cream shop to get some delicious
homemade ice cream (with a tasty surprise, an M&M, at
the bottom of the homemade waffle cones). The many
coffeehouses, such as Starbucks, 61C Caf6, Kivahan, and
Craig Street Coffee, are perfect for chatting and sipping
drinks.
   On the other hand, some may choose to spend their
night singing karaoke at Sushi Two, where $5 gets the
microphone. Other popular activities are the Friday
Night Improvs, playing pool in the recreation room at the
William Pitt Union, riding the incline on Mt. Washington,
working out in the gym, or just relaxing in one of the
parks. All of them will get you change for your $10. No
matter what the agenda, Pitt students can have fun for
under ten bucks, and if worse comes to worse, we can
ride the buses all day, after all it doesn't cost anything!
