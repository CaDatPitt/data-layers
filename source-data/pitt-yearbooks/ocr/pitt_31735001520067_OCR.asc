iings, like the winning tradition of PITT
. never change. The Panthers made their
trip in four years to the Jacksonville, Fla.
Bowl to meet the South Carolina Game-
;. The Panthers have now appeared in a post

n bowl seven out of the past eight years.
ame that had been billed as the “Battle of
'ophy Wlnners" was a spectacular win for
laying before a partisian Gamecock crowd,
nan runner up and Lombardi trophy winner
i Green and Outland trophy winner Mark
-d the Panthers to a 37-9 win over Heisman
' George Rogers and the Carolina Game-
nd to final national ranking as the second

'1 in the country.

After 75 years, it is hard to change, but the staff

of this book felt that the time was right. When the
OWL yearbook was founded in 1906. many

aspects of the book were different. The book served
as both a record of the graduating seniors and as

a record of the year's events. Over the past few years
the book has not been like that. The book was

little more than a sports record and paid little or no
attention to the other aspects of campus ife. The
number of seniors who were photographed
decreased, as did sales. And the OWL faced

possible extinction.

At the beginning of this school year, the staff

decided that something should be done. A new image
was needed for the book. A new name was

chosen, and a new approach to the coverage of
events on campus was launched. In this book, we
have started to phase in some of these ideas, and as
the book grows, we hope to expand upon these ideas.

The summer of 1980 saw the tremendous

success of the 1st Annual Rivers Shakespeare Festival.
A joint effort between the University and the City

of Pittsburgh, Department of Parks And Recreation,
the festival provided many surprises. Not only

were the shows successful at the box office, but they
also proved to assert the University as theatre
power to reckoned with, as each was an artistic
success. The Festival, which presented a series of
three plays, that included Romeo and Juliet, is
scheduled to return in the summer of 1981.

Homecoming '80 began on October 13. with the theme of “PITT, A
Shining Star." Throughout the week many different and exciting events were
held to illustrate this theme.

Star wide receiver for the Pittsburgh Steelers, Llynn Swann, made a
special appearance on the 13th to start the weeks’ activities. Swann spoke,
to a capacity crowd in the Student Union Lower Lounge, on life in the
National Football League. A question and answer period, as well as, an
autograph session followed his talk.

Voting for the Homecoming King, Queen, and Court took place during
the day Tuesday, and that evening, Mime -~ Trent Arterberry, who has
performed all over the United States, delighted many in David Lawrence
Auditorium.

(continued on pg. 33)

 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
  
 
  
  

HOMECOMING '80 had two fine students chosen to

represent it as it's King and Queen. Queen Desiree Jefferson, was
a senior majoring in Public Re|ations/Communications. Her
hometown was McKeesport. Her king, Chester A. Ray, Jr., a native
of Orangeburg, S.C.. was a student majoring in physiological
psychologyr Both Desiree and Chester were sponsored by the

Black Action Society. Other members of the HOMECOMING
'80 Court were; Mary Alyce Solomon, Cindy Roth, Kim Hoban,
Suzanne Pully, Marray Sittsamer, Jeff Thomas, Stuart
Swanson, and Joe DiMartino

The HOMECOMING '80 Formal added the last glimmering
touches to make the week a shining success. It was held at the
Holiday Inn — at the Airport and those who attended were
entertained by the music of Night Owl.

As the week progressed, and “over the
hump" day arrived, more activities took place and
more and more people began to become
involved.

Wednesday began with the annual blood drive,
talied by the amount of student participation.
Over 100 pints of blood were collected by this
drive. The evenings’ entertainment was
sponsored by Campus Crusade for Christ, who
brought illusionist Andre Kole to thrill and
amaze. Local businesses added to the fun, with the
2nd annual “Oakland BarNight. A PITT T—shirt
entitled the wearer to happy hour prices in many
of the local drinking establishments. Highlights
of the 1976 championship PITT football season
were shown on Wednesday and again on
Thursday.

Thursday was also the day for the annual
Homecoming carnival in the Schenley Quad.
(continued on pg. 34)

Fraternities, sororities, and
student organizations sponsored
game booths and the Pitt
Program Council sold hot dogs,
and other carnival type food.
During the carnival, Campus
Skates rented skates and
students were free to skate all
over Oakland. Myron Cope
broadcast his popular sports
talkshow live from the Quad

on this “auspicious occasion", with
PITT football personalities as
guests. Later that evening, WTAE
DJ's O'Brien and Garry hosted

a pep rally to get everyone fired up
for “A Coal Miner's

Slaughter” in Saturday's football
game against the Hoopies of
WVU. Announcement of the 1980
Homecoming Court took

place during the Carnival &
fireworks over Mazeroski Field
wrapped up the events for
another day.

(continued on pg. 37)

A warm welcome to the University for each
new woman student is provided by the Pan
Hellenic Association and the Women Alum-
ni Association in their annual Lantern
Night. The traditional ceremony symbol-
izes the passing of knowledge from upper-
classmen to the new students.

Although engineers rarely do anything but
study at other times of the year, Engineers

Week provides opportunities for engineers to
have fun. Two examples of this are Games
Night and Games Engineers Play.

Some people consider the annual Engineers’ Week parade the

derby, the Engineers’ 500, the weeks’ highlight. Both events
though, are lots of fun.

The Greek week sponsored Dance Marathon is a test of strength and
stamina. It is also one of the highest yielding Greek fund raisers. This year
the Dance Marathon raised over $8000 for the Heart Fund, the chosen
Greek Week charity. Held in conjunction with the event, was the Greek
Banner Contest.

Greek Sing is one of the highlights of Greek

rounded by controversy and a boycott, Pitt
Greeks once again proved their ability to en-

FIJI place first among fraternities.

Pure Prairie League brought their unique brand of
country rock to the Syria Mosque on November 7, in the
second of the Pitt Program Council's series of major
concerts. Their hits like “Two-Lane Highway" and “I'll
fix Your Flat Tire, Merle" were easily blended with cuts
from their new Firin' Up album to produce an entirely
enjoyable evening.

COFFEEHOUSES

Pitt Program Council, Entertainment Committee, spon-
sored Coffeehouses provided a relaxing and inexpensive
way to spend a Saturday evening. A variety of entertain-
ment was presented for the enjoyment of all who at-

OPEN STAGE

The Entertainment Committee of the Pitt Program Council also gave
students a chance to be the entertainment as they presented the
OPEN STAGE at Uncle Charlies’.

One of the highlights of cultural arts
programming was the presentation
of Vincent Price. Mr. Price per-
formed as Oscar Wilde in Delights
and Diversions.

The PPC Lecture Committee pre-
sented a varied series of lectures
throughout the school year this
year. Those who lectured included
Andrew Young, former Ambassador
to the U.N., Steeler superstar Lyn
Swann, Feminist Gloria Steinem,
Carter cabinet member Hamilton
Jordan, and Star Trek creator, Gene
Roddenberry.

The Pat Metheny Group was another of the fine groups brought to
entertain at Pitt. The unique jazz style made their concert
another success for the Pitt Program Council.

The Pitt Program Council Arts Committee Cul-
turally enriched its' audience with the presen-
tation of a steel band from the Carribean.

NURSE’S
WEEK 1981

A new event on the University Calendar this year was Nurse's Week —
March 7-14. Included in this week were numerous speakers and semi-
nars concerning the many opportunities open to nurses today. The
week started off with a celebration, the Nurses’s formal. An evening
of lights, love, and laughter was an appropriate beginning to what is
bound to become a successful annual event.

FOOTBALL

This year's Pitt Panthers had many high
expectations to live up to—- —— one of
which was to finish the season as the #1
college football team. And they almost
didll Although the first game turned out
victorious, it wasn't as great as anticipat-
ed. So Pitt fell in rank, and continued to
drop, reaching a low after the Florida State
game. But from then on it was only up, up,
up for our Panthers.

A significant win over the Vols, the defeat
of arch rival Penn State. and, finally culmi-
nating the season, a major bowl bid for the
Gator Bowl were just some of the events
marking this past season. After defeating
the Gamecocks Pitt just had to sit back and
let fate take its course — — and the cards
almost fell the Panthers‘ way, But we had
to settle for #2. Until next yearl!

The Panters’ offense had the advantage this
year of being led by, not one, but two exper-
ienced quarterbacks. The combined efforts of
Dan Marine and free —- safety — turned —
quarterback Rick Trocano sparked Pitt to
many high scoring victories. But these weren't
the only Panthers playing a major role on the
team. Without our fine receivers, center, full-
backs, halfbacks, and many others, both in
the limelight and out, a #2 ranking would nev-
er have been possible.

Although many of our offensive line will be
returning, some vacancies exist which will be
sorely felt next season, such as the exit of
Randy McMillan, Russ Grimm, Willie Collier,
Benjie Pryor, Mark May, Rooster Jones,
Wayne DiBartola, to namejust a few. Especial-
Iy felt, though, will be the loss of our kicker,
Dave Trout, who never failed to put the open-
ing kickoff “into the end zone again!”

Defense oftendwasisynonomous witha cer-

» tain defensive end, namely Hugh Green. How-
ever, much more went into making Pitt's de-

fense #1 in the nation. Names like Jackson.
White, L. Thomas, Sunseri, Relchard, Neill,
Meisner, and J. Boyarsky could often be heard
echoing from the stadium announcing yet an—
other effective stop by our defensive line. Al-

though it was the offense that scored the
points. it was defense that gave them the ball
and excellent field position again and again.

Perhaps the most emotional moment this

season came whenever, during the last home
game, Hugh Green's number. “99". was re-

tired. The crowd came to its feet in an ovation
that drowned out the voice of the announcer
to honor for one fast time their favorite defen-
sive player ~—~ ~—“HUGHl” Next year’s players
certainly have some big shoes to fill!!!

The University of Pittsburgh's Men's
Track Team's only participant in the NCAA
indoor championships turned out to be a
Pitt record setter and All-American. He was
Junior Larry Kinney. and hisjump of 52-1"
earned him 7th place at the meet and the
title “All—American."

Another of the season's biggest high-
lights occurred at the Pitt Invitational,
where Greg Conover, Terry Gallagher, and
Joel Albers placed 1st, 3rd, and 5th, re-
spectively in the one-half mile. Freshman
Todd Colas was Pitt's other 1st placer with
a 2211.7 in the 1000 yd. run. The team
primarily consisted of Freshman and Soph-
mores who used the 80-81 season to gain
valuable experience for next year's Cross-
Country and Track seasons.

The Women's Gymnastics team once
again gained national prominence

after posting an 11-1 record. The season
included victories over 4 top twenty
teams and championships at the Pitt
invitational and the Pennsylvania

Two plus Two Competition. Team records
were set in every event. and in the
overall team total and average.

The Pantherettes placed second at
Eastern Regionals and placed 3
performers on the All — East squad.
They were Jr. Holly Martino, and Fr.

Lisa Shirk and Karen Martin. Shirk was
ranked first in the nation in all -

around and set new Pitt records in every
individual event. Coach Donna Sanft

was named Coach of the Year by the
Eastern Coaches.

The Pantherettes were seeded 11th

at Nationals in Salt Lake City, Utah, and
moved up into the top 10 in the

nation.

The team will miss departing Srs. Bonnie
Tressler, Diane Debich, and Byra
Bachuchin, but a solid nucleus returns for
next season as the Panterettes set

their sights on even higher goals.

The Men's Gymnastic team had a record
breaking season this year; smashing two team
records, and six individual records. The
Panther men topped their previous high score
of 238.65 the first meet of the year with a
record 246.35. In their last meet of the year
against Penn State, Pitt obliterated their
recent record with a high score of 255.25.
Individual records have been set by co-
captain Bob Besong on high bar and vault;
Nooch Capani on pommel horse; Dave
Smith on floor; and Frank Kratz on vault. Bob
Besong also broke the all around record
with a 53.4.

For the first time in Panther history,

Pitt's men will be represented in the N.C.A.A.
National Championships, held in Nebraska.
Members of Pitt's National team include Bob
Besong, Dave Smith, on floor. and Frank
Kratz on vault.

Pitt had a successful 8-3 season under
the leadership of Co—captain and senior Byron
Johns, senior Jeff Litzinger, and Co-
captain Bob Besong. Pitt will miss its strong
seniors, but is looking forward to another
record breaking season next year.

Strong recruits and steady veteran

members promise to improve the great marks
of this year, and to make Pitt's men's

team a strong contender in the collegiate
gymnastics scene.

Performing before a crowd of 90,000 people
at the University of Tennessee, spending 25
straight hours on a bus to attend the Gator
Bowl, getting hit by a flying bagel at Pitt Stadi-
um, and sweating it out on the practice field, 8
hours a day at band camp are all highlights of
being a member of one of the finest college
marching bands in the East. The pictures in
this sections are highlights of another sort.
They were taken “on the road” with the PITT
BAND. But the Pitt Band is not all fun. Many
hours of hard work are necessary before each
performance. Band members rehearse 3-4
times weekly and are required to attend Band
Camp prior to the start of the fall term.

The Pitt Band is under the direction of Don
Hower, who is assisted by Vince Biancucci.
Joe Campus serves as Arranger, and the per-
cussion section is instructed by Lorry Yednak.
The Pitt Golden Girls are under the direction of
Larry Cervi.

That pretty much sums up the week that the

PITT Ski Club spent in Vermont. Every year, during
term break, the members enjoy a week skiing

in Vermont. This year's trip was to Snugg|er's
Notch in Jeffersonville, Vermont. If you could

bare the cold, the skiing was fantastic. Due to
these extreme temperatures, the club found
themselves spending an extra day in Vermont.
This ski season came to an early close. As

always, the club offered presentations, clinics, and
movies during their monthly meetings. 10%
discounts were offered to club members at area
ski shops and the club held a ski Swap-N‘Sa|e

at the end of the season.

When Tri Delta was founded in 1888 at
Boston University, the sorority was quickly
recognized as a leader in the Greek world.
Since our establishment at Pitt in 1916, Tri
Deltas have upheld that tradition by becom-
ing a leader in Greek life on campus.

lndividually, Tri Deltas are involved in
many campus activities, including Student
Government Committees, the Panhellenic
Association and the Mentor Program. Col-
lectively Tri Deltas raise money for local
charties, donate blood and volunteer at the
Ronald McDonald House. We've won tro-
phies for various activities held throughout
Homecoming and Greek Week. Each year
Tri Deltas enjoy barn dances, mixers with
fraternities and our winter formal.

Delta Sigma Theta Sorority Incorporated was founded
Jan. 13, 1913 at Howard University by 22 strong black
women. Our founders envisioned an organization of col-
lege women pledged to serious endeavor and communi-
ty service. In the year 1930, Delta Sigma Theta was
incorporated. Today there are well over 100,000 mem-
bers and more than 653 chapters across the nation, and
in Haiti, Liberia, West Germany, and the Bahamas.

At Delta Sigman Chi things are usually un-
usual, mostly because ordinary is boring.
We have done everything, from burning gar-
bage (years ago), to kidnapping people in
the cafeteria. Although things may seem a
little strange, its’s because people are being
themselves and enjoying it.

Our brothers are really proud to be part of
DSC, not only because of awards or person-
al gains, but because it is really someplace
special.

This year has been a little quiet for us, (com-
pared to the usual), but really enjoyable.
Hopefully future years will be just as crazy
and rewarding

Each of us has our own idea of what a
sorority should be. Some feel academics
should be a major aspect while others want
social activities or a strong service program.
As sisters of Theta Phi Alpha. we present a
well rounded group which encompasses
these areas and more.

Academics rank high on our list of priori-
ties. Our sisters have majors that range
from engineeringand nursingto political sci-
ence and economics. Although academics
are important our social activities are also
quite numerous. We participate in Home-
coming and Greek Week activities as well as
having brunches, mixers, spaghetti dinners
and parties. Our informal ends our busy Fall
term, while our formal highlights the Winter.

After 14 years of being inactive
on the University of Pittsburgh
campus, Lambda Chi Alpha Fra-
ternity was reinstated as a colo-
ny in 1978. Since then the frater-
nity has learned and experienced
from the ups and downs of being
new on campus. As a reflection
of this learning, Lambda Chi Al-
pha has succeeded in having the
most accomplished rush in num-
bers of initiated members, over
the last two terms. Lambda Chi
Alpha was installed as a chapter
in March of this year. We pride
ourselves on our antihazing poli-
cy and by having Associates who
have equal status with the broth-
ers, rather than miscreated
pledges. Lambda Chi Alpha is de-
voted to increasing its member-
ship and developing a mature
brotherhood.

Phi Beta Siga

;‘ .> »A,‘»k§f '

Phi Beta Sigma Fraternity was founded on January 9,
1914 at Howard University in Washington D.C. by three
prominent and idealistic young men. These three
founders, brother Langston Taylor, brother Charles I.
Brown, and brother Leonard T. Morse, conglomerated
to establish a new service and social fraternal structure
which is known today as Phi Beta Sigma Fraternity, Inc.
This fraternity and members are bound together as a
positive force under the high ideals of the Brotherhood,
service, and scholarship. With these ideals in mind along
with the motto, “Culture for Service and Service for
Humanity”, Sigma has formulated and initiated such
highly accrediated National programs such as Bigger
and Better Business, Education, and Social Action and
Project SAD, which serves for the betterment of all man-
kind. Since its founding and as a result from its outstand-
ing contributions to society, Sigma has been able to
attract quite a few strong-minded young men to help
speed its cause on its noble way. Today, Phi Beta Sig-
ma’s membership has increased to over 75,000 mem-
bers. Its realm has expanded beyond the U.S. borders to
Africa, Switzerland, and the Carribean.

We at the Pi Sigma Chapter of Phi Gamma

Fraternity system here at Pitt. The responsi-

while being a part of a fraternity are very re-
warding. Our hope is that the experiences that
we share while being under—graduates will
benefit us after graduation, because FIJI is
“NOT FOR COLLEGE DAYS ALONE."

Phi Delta Theta

The Phi Delta Theta fraternity is
nestled in scenic North Oakland.
Recent and ongoing remodeling
is rapidly turning this fine older
edifice into the showplace house
on campus. Upon entering the
grand foyer, one is immediately
aware of warmth and congiality,
the hallmakr of the fraternity.
These qualities are reflected in
the personalities of all the broth-
ers. |Under the firm leadership of
“Papa" Joe Greco, newly elect-
ed President, the fraternity car-
ries on a long tradition of schol-
arship, personal integrity, and
honor. The Phi Delta Brothers
are a fine, upstanding group of
clean-cut fun loving young gen-
tleman, each of them an exam-
ple of the true college man, each
a credit to the fraternity and the
Greek system in general.

ﬂc/Lo PITLJ

As I sit and reflect upon the past years, there were alot of times I thought that this day would never
come. Now that the 1981 PANTHER PRINTS (nice title) is finished though, I feel that a giant part of
me is gone. Not that I am sad, I end my editorship with mixed emotions. I hope that you enjoy this
book because I enjoyed putting it together for you. But, some of the headaches suffered while
getting it out have not been worth it. My biggest headache was apathy. Apathy not just among
students, but also with the people I dealt with every day, people whom I depended upon for help.
But it was also apathy that helped to decide what direction this book was headed. This book is all
about the people who care about what's happening. They are the people who are willing to take
risks, they are the people who make changes, they are the 500 plus seniors photographed and
pictured in the Senior section, and most of all they are the 800 people who have or will purchase a
copy of this book. Those people help to make a little more bearable and alot more interesting.
Some interesting people deserve thanks for making this book possible. They are the staff of the
FIRST Panther Prints Yearbook. I thank George Popichak and Carla Frankhouse for their creative
imput, and Tim Bigler and Wendy Roth for the special photographic skills. I thank our photogra-
phers, Anthony, Bruce, Bob, Ken, Mike, Mike, Bonita, and Ed. I owe the existance of this book to a
super photo Editor, Gordon Brightsen, who has once again come through when we needed him. To
a staff like no one elses', Diane, Amy, Kathy, Shawn, John, Lori, Michelle, Carol, Sharon, Heleana,
Jennie, Pam, and Sharon, I owe a ton of gratitude for their labor of love. And to Deb, I owe all the ap-
preciation in the world for help above and beyond the call of duty. She helped make it all seem
bearable.

I would also like to thank the staff and administration of the University for all their help. Dean Billick
in the Sports Information office and his staff were a tremendous help once again. Andy Smith and
the Office of Student Activities proved to be of great assistance once again. And last, but not least,
our advisor, Larry Lusford has never been more cooperative. He has supported all our efforts from
the first day.

There is one person I would like to thank who is not known to anyone but those people who are part
of the yearbook staff. Mr. George Stewart is the type of person who puts everything he has into all
he does and this book is no exception. As a representative for the publisher of this book, it is his job
to make sure everything runs smoothly. With this book, although we have had our share of
problems I have never had cause to worry. George has helped me feel good about this book, as well
as good about myself. He is behind the Pitt Yearbook 100% and I appreciate it.

The people who deserve the most credit for this book though, are you, the people who have
purchased it. For without you there is no reason for us to exist.

I thank all of you I I I I
