DEAN KUEHN

Dean of the School of Nursing, Ruth Perkins Kuehn’s
opinion is that “nursing emphasis is now on human re-
lationships between the patient and the nurse and less on
skills. Of course we need both.”

Pitt nursing emphasizes nursing service administration,
putting attention on patient care for new “nursing prac-
titioners.” l\Iost “menial tasks of old” are handled now
almost exclusively by non—professional help in hospitals.

Pitt’s School of Nursing graduates over 100 nurses per
year. A great need for professional nurses exists. As a
result, graduates have little difficulty in ﬁnding satis-
factory positions.

Dean Kuehn was born in Sharon, Wisconsin, and grad-
uated from the school of nursing at the Children’s l\Iemo-
rial Hospital, Chicago. For years she has worked Vigor-
ously to improve nursing education.

  D EDICATION

The Owl is ﬁfty years old.

Each organization that celebrates an anniversary is
proud of its past. As it grows older the group becomes rich
with customs and traditions that its members founded. It
becomes an integral part of the needs of the people it serves.

The Owl is ﬁfty years old. Within that time, the Owl has
become more than a book with students’ pictures. It has
become a record of students’ lives in their undergraduate
days at the University and a pictorial history of a great
University’s growth.

This world that the Owl serves is an important world.
The people who make up this world, both students and
faculty, should be given more than words and lectures to
remember the wonderful days that they spent at the Uni-
versity of which they are so much a part. The staﬂ’s that
have worked on the yearbook have tried to meet this need
by producing a better Owl each year for University people.

To these staffs, we wish to dedicate this edition of the
Owl. Everyone, whether editor, adviser, or typist who has
built this tradition of the Owl we wish to thank for the
heritage given us. In ﬁfty years, the book has grown be-
cause of these people. We hope that our book will be a
credit to them and a ﬁtting book to end the ﬁrst ﬁfty years
of its history.

SCHOOL OF
RETAILING

DEAN SMITH

Albert B. Smith, dean of the School of Retailing and
professor of retailing at Pitt, received his B.B.A. at West-
minster College in 1937, his l\I.Litt. at Pitt in 1938. Mr.
Smith is a native Pittsburgher.

He feels that the businessman has deﬁnite responsi-
bilities to the community he serves; the retailer is the
student of his age, according to Mr. Smith. Students in
retailing are conscious of the everchanging markets. Dis-
tribution and productivity mean little if the product is
not sold.

Department stores make the perfect laboratories for
retailing and its intricacies, states Mr. Smith. There are
four associated stores in Pittsburgh, Cleveland, Dayton,
and Washington, D. C. who hire Pitt retailing students
that they might get an overall point of View in their
graduate studies.

l\Ir. Smith recently wrote an informat e article on
retailing for the magazine report Career, the annual guide
to business.

To the graduating class of 1956

As a representative of more than 47,000 Pitt graduates,
I’d like to extend our congratulations as you step from
senior to alumnus status. This moment, graduation, is
one of the high points in your life.

The degree that you hold represents an investment. It
has taken you four years, a considerable expenditure of
energy, and a large amount of money to earn it.

What exactly is it worth?

Generally speaking, whatever you choose to make it
worth. From now on it is you and the way that you
employ your degree that will decide just how valuable it
is. A diploma is not only the culmination of one invest-
ment but the beginning of another.

To the graduate of the class of 1956 I extend an invi-
tation to take an active part in your University’s Alumni
Association. I’itt’s General Alumni Association and the
eleven constituent associations are composed of men and
Women who remember their University affectionately and
who work for its best interests. They are graduates from
1905 to 1955; they may be professionals or A.B. degree
graduates. This they have in common: they want to see
the University progress, and they are doing something
about it.

You recognize this feeling. As an undergraduate you
were able to share, through classes and activities, in the
creation of an important era in Pitt’s history. The activi-
ties of the Alumni Association continue the investment
you’ve made in Pitt’s future. We of the Association would
be glad to hear from you at any time.

Again, congratulations and good luck

Sincerely,

James J. Lee, I\I.D.
President, General
Alumni Association

-4 EYES OE TEE OWL

Pitt this year celebrates the ﬁftieth anniversary of its year-
book, the Owl. The years have been eventful with constant
change. It is a ﬁtting time for us to look back toward the ﬁrst
decades of this century, seeing what has given stature to our
University, but never forgetting that the Class of 1956 will
live with today and plan for tomorrow.

How does one chart the history of a great university? Its
story, its drama, is elusive and the only truths of the past that
exist are the records that have measured our progress.

To honor that progress we have chosen to portray its
source: the administrators, the faculty, the students who
make a school live—no matter what its size——and the build-
ings, new and old, in which that life of learning is carried on.

Throughout its entire history, Pitt has been concerned with
growth and expansion. Since the early nineteen-hundreds
when the Western University of Pennsylvania chose as its
permanent name the University of Pittsburgh, new develop-
ments have come into existence quickly. An early plan for the
University’s location was the building of a new educational

Here, the education students, student teachers, and in-
service teachers can obtain the available publications and

Alpha Beta Gamma is a local sorority which was founded
at Pitt in 1939 in order to foster cooperation and friendship
between students and faculty members.

Its social program, to establish unity among elementary
education students, included social meetings, general meet-
ings, panel discussions, and a spring banquet. Special events,
such as ﬁeld trips to schools and Carnegie Museum, and
pertinent speeches from foreign exchange teachers and the
University Placement Bureau, were also arranged.

The new initiates pin on their ribbons.

Alpha Omega is a national dental fraternity which accepts
for membership only those undergraduates with high scholar-
ship, character, leadership, and personality. The objectives
of the fraternity are many: to promote the profession of
dentistry, to encourage good spirit and fellowship among its
members, to create and bind together a body of professional
men, who by scholarly attainments and faithful service have
achieved distinction.

Among this year’s activities was a barn dance, a freshman
smoker, a pledge dinner, an annual senior banquet, and a
picnic. Also, the fraternity was host last December at the
national Alpha Omega Convention for 1955, held in the VVil-
liam Penn Hotel.

The Dental School Interfraternity Scholarship award, in
existence for only ﬁve years, has been won each consecutive
year by the Alpha Omegas.

The aim of Alpha Phi Omega, national service fraternity, is
to give service to the student body and faculty, to members
of any fraternity, and to youth, the community, and the
nation as a whole.

Any male student who is interested in taking part in such
service projects that Will beneﬁt the school or the community
is eligible for membership.

Last year the members of Alpha Phi Omega ushered at
Commencement, Tap Day, Scholar’s Day, and Varsity Day.
They set up refreshment booths at Spring Carnival and sev-
eral of the year’s dances, and took a big hand in proctoring
for exams during the examinations for entering freshmen.

Also, in keeping with their code of performing services for
charities, members worked at scout camps, ushered for the
Religion-in-Life convocation, and held Christmas and Easter
parties for orphans.

Alpha Zeta Omega, national pharmacy fraternity, evolves
around two main purposes. The organization strives to make
its members proud of the University of Pittsburgh and to
build strong character in individuals.

Each year the fraternity encourages scholastic endeavor
by presenting awards to the students who have achieved
high standing in their class.

Among the social activities for the past year was a hay
ride and square dance, a Pittsburgh Playhouse affair, and an
installation dinner dance. The fraternity also held a forum
on pharmaceutical subjects and raised money for their na-
tional cultural fund.

Last year Alpha Zeta Omega received the Directorum
Cup for being the most outstanding chapter in the country.

The American Institute of Electrical Engineers is an i11ter-
national professional organization comprised of full-time
electrical engineering students.

The organization broadens the student’s acquaintance
with the engineering world and fosters qualities needed by
the engineer which are 11ot fully cultivated while in school.
It also gives the student an opportunity to strengthen his
social, technical, and literary bonds with his fellow class-
mates, instructors, and graduate engineers.

Several group inspection trips to factories were on the
agenda last year. By showing the student the newest devel-
opments in the industry, the organization helps him to
better understand his ﬁeld.

Last year also the Institute entered its newspaper iii the
annual newspaper contest, competing with entries from all
over the country.

The objective of the Air Force Reserve Officers Training
Corps is to offer select cadets commissions in the U. S. Air
Force. Of almost equal importance is the offering of knowl-
edge in air age citizenship to those students.

Air Force R.O.T.C. offers many activities. Among them
are: Arnold Air Society, for juniors and seniors, a trick drill
team, a riﬂe team, and Pershing Riﬂes, in connection with
the Army R.0.T.C.

In summer juniors and seniors attend camp for six weeks
at a large air force base. There they learn the rudiments of
ﬂying and the proper qualiﬁcations for ﬁring on the riﬂe
range.

Each spring Air Force R.O.T.C. holds a l\Iilitary Ball in

This past year the American Institute of Industrial Engi-
neers at the University of Pittsburgh held an extremely ac-
tive year for its type of organization. VVith members made up
of industrial engineering students the organization held fall
and spring dinners as well as a highly successful picnic where
the fellows and their dates concentrate(l on fun and each
other as a respite from a year of intensive study in the class-
room.

The Institute of Industrial Engineers’ purpose is to make
the industrial engineers a better all around group, at the
same time furthering the Industrial Engineering Department
at Pitt.

Student programs were planned and held each week to
keep enthusiasm high.

The purpose of the Army Reserve Ofﬁcers Training Corps is
to train outstanding cadets for commissions as officers in the
U. S. Army. The R.O.T.C. curriculum teaches students a
general as Well as an engineering course.

Each summer members train six weeks at a regular army
training post.

A rounded study in the subject of military science also in-
cludes learning methods and procedures for officers, the
history and construction of weapons, as well as maneuvers,
military customs, and traditions.

Cadets are urged to join Pershing Riﬂes, Scabbard and
Blade, the Society of American Engineers, and the Quar-
termaster Association to heighten their standing.

The l\Iilitary Ball, held every spring in conjunction with
the Air Force R.O.T.C., is an outstanding social function.

"How about a number for me from your little black book?"
Founded originally in 1882, Delta Sigma Delta, fraternity
comprised of students and practitioners of dentistry, has the
distinction of being the only international dental fraternity
in existence. Its members strive to keep the standards of
dentistry high by encouraging cooperation toward scientific,
ethical, and professional progress.
  Last year these sports-minded dentists captured the professional football league championship for the second straight
year.
  Active socially, the fraternity held parties every two or
three weeks during the year. Each year the fraternity also
highlights its social calendar with a Christmas and spring
formal. This is just that "extra something" that helps dental
students blend study with fun.

"Now do you understand it?"
To advance professionalism and fraternalism in the field of
pharmacy is the aim of Kappa Psi, national professional
pharmacy fraternity.
  Any student who has completed one full semester in the
Pharmacy school and who has a 1.5 overall QPA is eligible
for membership.
  Last Christmas, the members participated in a canned
food drive for orphans. Earlier in the year, they had a friendly
get-together at an evening smoker, and they culminated
their year's activities with a gala spring formal.
  Mainly, the organization tries to foster a friendly atmosphere among those students who have chosen pharmacy as a
vocation. A friendly spirit, the members feel, can greatly advance the profession's standing on the whole.
  Discussions of techniques, standards, and attitudes also
play a dominant role in the organization's prime purpose.
                                                                 You can tell it's 14:30 and lunch time for the Kappa Psis.

"A rough test, eh fellows?"
The purpose of Phi Delta Chi, national pharmaceutical
pharmacy, is two-fold: to advance the science of pharmacy
and to foster and promote a fraternal spirit among its members.
  Male students in the Pharmacy School who have maintained a 1.5 QPA are eligible for membership.
  The organization sponsored a spring and fall smoker at
which they tapped their new members, and several friendly
get-together parties with student nurses. A spring alumni
banquet and a spring dinner dance were two of the more
gala affairs.
  Each year the organization sponsors such charities as the
Pitt Chest Drive.
  In December the fraternity sent representatives to the
annual national convention held in Indianapolis. Here the
members learned new and better ways of making their organization a true interest group.

All undergraduate students who are interested in social work
and who have a desire to find out more about the profession
are invited to membership in the Pre-Social Work Club.
  The organization met several times during the year. At
these meetings the members tried to give interested students
a broader background and knowledge of the field of social
work.
  Many times men and women who are working in the field
are invited to speak on the requirements of social work or to
give various other kinds of advice to the students.
  The organization has no formal officers and is more of a
mutual interest group. The adviser to the Pre-Social Work
Club is Miss Jean Reynolds.
  Last year the members held a dinner in a more informal
manner.

One outstanding national dental fraternity on the University
of Pittsburgh campus is Psi Omega, which goes far in furthering the welfare of its industrious members.
  Psi Omega is primarily a social organization aimed at the
professional student who seeks a certain kind of diversion
from his dental studies.
  Certainly he finds that interesting, homey feeling as a member of Psi Omega. Members may be tapped to the fraternity
after their first semester in the School of Dentistry.
  Last year the fraternity held a Christmas formal which
was a brilliant success. With the end of the school year came
the spring formal which terminated the social year as well.
  Each year Psi Omega, sponsors a Christmas party for homeless children. They also contribute to various charities, including the Pitt Chest.

Acropolis in the Greek style on what is now Pitt’s upper cam-
pus. The feeling was that such a plan would take full advan-
tage of the sloping hill and at the same time give an impres-
sion of the Classic Age in the clustering together of the vari-
ous schools.

The ﬁrst building erected on the campus was State Hall,
early seat of the Administration, followed within months in
1909 by Thaw Hall, containing the School of Engineering,
near the Soldiers’ l\Iemorial.

The Dental School became an integral part of the Uni-
versity in 1905, moving into its present building on O’Hara
Street in October, 1912, the year of Pitt’s 125th anniversary;
later the Dental Clinic, the Dental Annex, and the upper
Dental School were erected.

United with the University since 1896, the School of Pl1ar-
macy located its building farther downtown in 1902. The
school remained somewhat independent from the University
proper but finally merged with Pitt in January of 1948 on the
seventieth anniversary of the founding of a school of phar-
macy in Pittsburgh, the practice of which actually began in
the days when Pittsburgh was the last outpost to the West.

Home for the profession of medicine has been located i11
Pennsylvania Hall ever since its dedication in January of
1911. In this building also are the related medical library,
classrooms, and laboratories.

Then in 1912 the Allegheny Observatory was completed
in Riverview Park, replacing an earlier observatory which
was pioneered under the direction of Dr. Samuel P. Langley,
early inventor in aviation. The new and soon important ob-
servatory grew out of the efforts of Dr. John A. Brashear, act-
ing chancellor from 1901 to 1904»a man who “loved the
stars too fondly to be fearful of the night.”

To acquaint the student chemical engineer with
what chemical engineering is, what chemical engineering does, and what chemical engineering
offers is the purpose of the American Institute of
Chemical Engineers.
  Field trips to local industries, educational films
on chemical engineering, and informal talks by
outstanding chemical engineering leaders were
parts of the Institute's program this past year.
  Their social calendar was highlighted by an
annual Senior-Faculty football game, a square
dance, and a freshman smoker.
  Last year the organization received the "Shamrock Award" for the best display and participation
in Engineer's Week.

Idaka is the pre-nursing sorority which seeks to
acquaint its members with the nursing profession
through visits and interviews with residents of
the Medical Center.
  Members of Idaka must be pre-nursing students and must have a minimum     of 14 credits
with a 1.0 QPA.
  Idaka social functions attempted to bring the
girls in the sorority closer together. They held an
open house early in the year and gave a party at
Christmas time. The parents also had an opportunity to get acquainted with one another at
the Idaka Parents' Tea.

Roadbuilders is the professional organization for
the recognition of prospective civil engineers. It
has direct affiliations with the national committee.
  It neither planned nor carried out any social
affairs as such. Nevertheless the engineers were
active in their support of this developing engineering group on campus which caters to the
student who is aware of the vital changes in
progress in the broad field of civil engineering.
  What the Roadbuilders organization tried to
do for its members was to create and develop in
them an interest in the highway industry, with
the new advances in dynamic mechanics.
  Speakers on engineering and professional men
talked to members through the year, instilling in
them professional interests and ethics.

Pre-law students argue a trial case.
The John Marshall Society is an honorary pre-legal fraternity
which offers assistance and guidance to any and all pre-legal
students. Membership in the society is open to those prelegal students who hold an over-all quality point average of
2.0 with a minimum of thirty credits.
  Each semester the organization holds at least four general
meetings. These meetings include a banquet and a distinguished member of the law profession as guest speaker. This
year, the men held a panel discussion on the problems of the
law student. Seniors from the University's law school headed
the discussion.
  Among the honors received by the fraternity was a letter
from the United States Supreme Court, commending the
society for honoring and studying the life of John Marshall.

  The principal aim of this national honorary is to promote
the professional, scholastic, and social interests of women in
pharmacy. To further this purpose, projects such as "Hygeia Day" held top listing on the sorority's program for the
year.
  The future pharmacists entertained themselves with a
series of parties which they held every month. In addition to
these regular monthly parties, the sorority celebrated its
Founders Day with a big party intended to give each girl a
closer acquaintance with the objectives of Lambda Kappa
Sigma.

                                                       Mortar Board is a national honor society for senior women

                                                       scholarship, and leadership. Its purposes are to promote
                                                       college loyalty, to stimulate and develop a finer type of col                                                       lege woman, and to provide for the cooperation among all

Do you think it is a serious problem?
Omicron Delta Kappa is open to those individuals who have
excelled in both scholarship and quality participation in
activities.
  ODK's three main aims are to recognize men who have
attained high scholarship-activities standards on campus,
to bring the faculty closer in contact with the students
through mutual interests, and to bring together the most
representative men in all phases of college life.
  Support of the student magazine Omnibus and the promotion of a high school relations program, in which individual high school leaders are brought together with respective college men, are accomplishments of the organization.
  Among the social affairs of ODK was their annual Manof-the-Year banquet, which was one of the highlights following Tap Day.
ODK members enjoy the latest in Hi-Fi.

To foster good relations between members of all student
publications is the aim of Pi Delta Epsilon, national honorary
journalism fraternity.
  Any student with a 1.5 QPA who has worked on a student
publication for one and a half years or who has accepted an
editorship for a year is eligible for membership. Such a student must have given outstanding service to the publication
and displayed a genuine interest in this group.
  One of the more important projects undertaken by this
group last year was the annual High School Publications
Institute. The project consisted mainly of two things: the
grading and rating of hundreds of high school newspapers
and yearbooks sent in to the University from high schools
throughout the Allegheny County, and a convention at the
University.

Studying isn't hard for members of Pi Tn1 Ph;
Any student in the College who has gained a 2.5 QPA or
better and who has proved himself capable of academic
achievement is eligible for membership in Pi Tau Phi, local
scholastic honorary organization in the College.
  Believing scholarship, culture and idealism the chief aims
of university life, members forward these ideals through
social fellowship. They encourage an interchange of ideas
among students and faculty members to forward intellect.
They encourage a turning toward art, literature, music, and
other interests to improve a scholar's education. And they
try to inspire students to work for high goals and attainments.
  Realizing also that charity is the sign of compassion, the
group last year contributed to the Scholars Day Fund, and
Religion-in-Life.

Rho Chi is the honorary scholastic society for the field of
pharmacy. To be eligible for membership, a student must be
in the upper 10 per cent of the junior class in the School of
Pharmacy with a 2.0 QPA. To recognize and promote scholarship in the field of pharmacy is the organization's chief aim.
  Rho Chi's annual initiation dinner in May to honor their
new members was a highlight of the fraternity's social calendar. At that time the sophomore member who as a freshman
maintained the highest grades is presented the book, Remington's Practice of Pharmacy.
  The support of Pitt Capsule, the student publication of
the School of Pharmacy, is one of the chief objectives of this
honorary organization.

  Beta Beta Beta, an international biological fra  ternity, recognizes superior attainment in the
  various biological sciences. The members of the
  fraternity meet once a month on the tenth floor
  of the Cathedral to discuss the scientific, tech  nical, and worthwhile activities of the organiza  tion.
    Perhaps the two most important of these are
  the regularly scheduled field trips, and the Biology
  II class, which the fraternity sponsors.
    Also on the list of projects are a national essay
  contest, which its members take part in, and a
  Warren F. Witz award, given by the fraternity to
  an outstanding graduating biology major.
    The fraternity aims at enriching and furthering
  the interests of its members and therefore con  centrates on the more serious aspects of its applied

Quax, local science honorary for women, aims at
inspiring and developing among its members a
sincere interest in general science. At the same
time, it tries to foster among them  a spirit of
good fellowship and friendship.
  Being tapped to the organization requires that
a woman science student have a 2.0 overall average.
Also, she must have completed three semesters
and earned nine credits in her major science.
  The activities of Quax are many and varied.
Along with regular programs during the year, at
which different guest speakers are featured, the
group sponsors several tours to Allegheny Observatory, Mellon Institute, and affairs for the
sophomore, junior, and senior women science
students. This year, open house was held in December on the twelfth floor of the Cathedral.-                                                                          w

Student Congress had dinner on the twelfth floor before Christmas recess.
The student group at the University which concerns itself with the best interests of the Pitt men
and women is Student Congress. Students are
either elected or appointed to serve.
  Student Congress seeks to study the needs and
interests of the men and women in their joint
educational and social life. It exerts leadership
and promotes programs that foster good will,
constructive work, and loyalty to the University.
  Pep rallies at Soldiers' and Sailors' Memorial
Hall, celebrations after big football victories, and
the planning of all-University dances were only
a few of the projects undertaken by the members
of Congress last year. To make students proud
of Pitt was their ultimate goal.
  The organization met each Monday at 3:30 p.m.
Advisers were Miss Patricia Ritz, Miss Emily
Irvine, Mr. Charles Elliot, and Mr. John Huston.
The meeting in the English Room is very absorbing.

burgh could ﬁnd, grown out of the early struggles of creative
and energetic Pittsburghers, new courage, imagination, adapt-
ability—new spiritual and mental power.

The Cathedral of Learning, as the new ediﬁce and symbol
of the University became known throughout the world, was
built tall, not merely because height meant less material ex-
pense, but because it expressed the inﬁnite, the unlimited
span of knowledge and education possible within its walls.

Men's Council officers take a minute off from their busy schedule.
The president breaks the tense discussion.
Dimitri Petro, president, strongly opposes a measure.
         Men's Council, representing the men of the stu         dent body at the University, attempts to improve
         the relation of the male student to his school and
         to his fellow students.
           To accomplish this commendable task the
         Council had a total membership of thirty dele         gates, elected at large, and the eighteen class
         presidents from the undergraduate schools.
           Among the Council's social affairs were the
         sponsoring of the Freshman Mixers, and the ad         ministrating of the Men's Freshman Conference
         Program, which indoctrinated new men with the
         lore of Pitt as well as with good study habits.
           Added to this agenda was the sponsoring of
         freshman elections, maintaining eighth floor men's
         lounges, and the lending of special equipment for
         visual aid and motion picture projection.

                      Washing dishes is fun when everyone helps.
The purpose of the Women's Self Government
Association is to coordinate the organized women's
activities at the University into a unified whole.
The organization hopes to foster a spirit of loyalty
to the University in every Pitt coed.
  The organization began the year with its annual
pre-school meeting held at White Sulphur Springs
Hotel near Bedford, Pa., in September. It was
here that the women organized their objectives
and planned their year's projects. The year's
activities were inaugurated with a transfer dinner
in the newly-decorated Vira Heinz Room.
  Last year the organization sponsored a tutoring
service for women, a guild program for freshmen,
and mixer dances for the student body. Besides
conducting the Coronation of the Senior Queen,
WSGA continued its six week freshmen orientation program.
An after-dinner discussion is held in 1228.

      Panhellenic Council is the governing body of so      rority women on the University of Pittsburgh
      campus. It is composed of three representatives
      from each sorority.
        Aims of the Council are to strengthen sororities
      by exchange of ideas and to increase one group's
      appreciation of another. The Council initiates
      programs of work large enough in scope, service,
      and appeal to give many girls experience in extra      curricular activities.
        Each year Panhellenic Council awards a Schol      arship Cup to the sorority with the highest overall
      average. They also contributed $180 to the sup      port of a Dutch war orphan and through Stunt
      Night financed a Panhellenic scholarship.
        The social events sponsored by the group last
      year were the Reception for Freshman Women,
      annual Ball, and the Panhellenic-IF Sing.

  of the students in the schools of Engineering and Mines.
  It is a local organization to which each department of the
  schools elects one representative.
    The purpose of the Cabinet is to coordinate all activities
 of the undergraduates and to improve the engineering
 student. As one of its projects, the Cabinet maintained a
 student lounge in Engineering Hall.
   The Engineering and Mines Association's program is
 under the jurisdiction of the Cabinet. This association
 sponsored two informal dances this year, one in the fall
 and one in the spring. Engineers Week, a prdgram held
 in March and well known to all Pittites, acquainted the
 entire University with the activities of the engineers.

The Evening Students Association is a local organization
formed to foster extracurricular, religious, and social activities and to stimulate interest in journalistic, technical
and honorary societies. Membership is open to all students
attending the evening sessions of the University.
  Among their many social functions were square dances,
get-acquainted parties, a Christmas dance, and a spring
semi-formal. They also sponsored Christmas and Easter
chapel services. These were just a few ways in which the
E.S.A. helped bring Pitt's evening students closer together.
  Each year the Activity Key Award is given to all members of the executive committee and the officers of the
organization.

Graduation and Coronation are two days the senior
woman has been anticipating since she first walked into
the Cathedral of Learning. Much of the Senior Class's
activities are directed toward the preparation for these
days.
  Annually the Class sponsors a dinner at which the
senior women nominate their candidates for Senior Queen
and Rose Tea where the candidates are formally announced.
  Career conferences and speakers on home-making were
made available regularly to the seniors.
  For the first time last year, senior women invited
faculty members to a class dinner. They hoped this would
initiate a program of more friendly relations between the
student and the teacher.

                                                      The Woman's Junior Class began the year with a dinner
                                                      in the newly remodeled Vira Heinz Room on the twelfth
                                                      floor. After the dinner, several of the juniors modeled
                                                      their own clothes, showing the type of fashions worn by
                                                      college women. The Dean of Women, Miss Helen Rush,
                                                      and some of the staff were among the guests at the dinner.
                                                        Throughout the year they held informal meetings to try
                                                      to knit the women of their class more closely together.
                                                      They initiated a series of discussions called the "Junior
                                                      Hour." At these group meetings, guest speakers spoke on
                                                      various phases of college life and the careers which follow.

                                                      on the Junior Class's calendar last year.

Before Christmas, The Sophomore Women's Class held
a tea on the twelfth floor. Class members gathered during
the festive season to talk about other things besides books,
papers, and classes. Later in the year they held a dinner in
the newly decorated Vira Heinz Room where the girls
were able to become acquainted with the new members of
their class.
  At the beginning of the year, the women joined the sophomore men in sponsoring the informal "Kick-Off" dance.
They also served on the Publicity committee for "Heart

in the year they held a class party to become better
acquainted. The girls also did committee work for the

The question of the class' memorial gift to the University
was one of the many projects of the Men's Senior Class.
Together with Pitt coeds the men decided what present
would best help the institution. The Senior Men's Class
also investigated the possibility of handling the sale of
class rings in hopes of considerably reducing their cost to
the student.
  The Men's Junior Class, including four undergraduate
schools like its senior counterpart, investigated this year
the possibility of merging the Spring Commons Room
Ball with the Spring Festival Dance. They also aided the

The Cathedral was dedicated to the youth of Pittsburgh i11
1937, exactly 150 years after the founding of that ﬁrst rustic
cabin. It was then that the symbol of the candle of enlighten-
Heinz Chapel ment—carried to this day in the University’s seal-—was

Engineering Hall Originated.

The next two years saw two beautiful additions to the
Gothic Cathedral’s impressiveness: the Stephen Foster Me-
morial, built in 1937 in appreciation of that native Pitts-
burgher’s contribution to the music of our country, and in
the spring of 1938, Heinz Chapel, a perfect example of West-
ern man’s dedication to strength in faith and Wisdom in medi-
tation.

In the University’s athletic history, the charter of Pitt
Stadium, built near Pennsylvania Hall, was approved in 1924,
and the huge bowl soon rang to cheers of Pitt victories during
the “Jock Sutherland Era.” It is important to Panther
strength at present as well as being used for several civic
events throughout the year’.

With a record for good, skillful playing in past sports, the
University completed December 15, 1951, the Memorial
Field House, a $1,500,000 building with an indoor ﬁeld, ball
courts, and gymnasia to promote future athletic successes.

Two years ago Pi Theta, local pre-theological
fraternity, was instituted at the University of
Pittsburgh by five interested students. The organization has in this short time grown to over
forty members, all of whom plan to enter the
ministry and become pastors, priests,-or rabbis.
  The organization tries to develop among its
members an appreciation of each other's faith
and an understanding of the problems and opportunities of the ministry.
  Two of the more important projects of Pi
Theta last year were a very active participation
in Religion-in-Life Week and a campaign to get
more students to attend the University Chapel
services held each Wednesday.
"Here are the reports, Dr. Luccock. See what you think of them."
Pi Theta religious discussions are serious and important business.

Pitt Christian Fellowship is an active religious
organization. The only requirement for membership is attendance at meetings. The Fellowship
aims to deepen and strengthen the spiritual life
of students by the study of the Bible, by prayer,
and by discussions of current religious trends.
  For their social functions, The Pitt Christian
Fellowship held supper meetings every Friday
evening. These meetings were also attended by
students from Carnegie Tech, Chatham College,
and the Nurses' Christian Fellowship.
  The members of Pitt Christian Fellowship held
prayer meetings every morning before school and
Bible study sessions daily during the fifth hour.

To bring about a greater spiritual emphasis on the University campus is the aim of the Student Chapel Board.
The organization works hand in hand with the Chaplain
in planning and organizing the Heinz Chapel Service of
Worship and in other matters concerning the Chapel's use.
  Members are appointed to serve on the Board for a
period of one or two years by all the stfident religious
organizations on campus. Meetings are held on the first
Monday of each month.
  One of the primary purposes of the Board both in the
past and at present has been to try to secure a free hour
during which all students may be free to attend Chapel.
  The Board also decides on the three charitable organizations which are to be the recipients of the Thanksgiving,
Christmas, and Easter offerings taken up at the Chapel
each year.
Board members leave Heinz Chapel after one of their Monday meetings.

A smile is evidence of a member's pride in Wesley activities.
Wesley dinners provide fellowship and good food.
The Wesley Fellowship was founded to provide Christian
fellowship for students of the Methodist faith at Pitt,
Carnegie Tech, and Chatham College through a wellrounded social and worship program.
  As one of the primary functions of the group, the Fellowship sent delegations of its members to various church
organizations throughout the Pittsburgh district to explain their interpretation of the role young people should
assume in church life. Wesley Fellowship gives students
an opportunity to continue active church work and also
acts as a social group. Their motto is "faith, fun, and fellowship." The organization provides many social activities
fbr its members, sponsoring such events as swimming and
bowling parties.

Membership in Westminster Foundation is comprised
mainly of Presbyterians, United Presbyterians, Congregational Christians and students belonging to the Evangelical and Reformed Churches. Any student, however, who
is interested in working with this Foundation is welcome.
  Each year the group contributes to such worthy charities as the World Student Christian Federation and the
World University Service. During the summer, many
members devote their time to work camps both in this
country and overseas.
  Last year the Pitt Chapter acted as hosts to the Westminster Foundation from West Virginia University during
the Pitt-West Virginia football game. They also enjoyed
themselves tremendously while visiting at Penn State
where they were the guests of the Penn State Foundation
during the annual Pitt-Penn State game on November 19.
Members enjoy singing the hymns of their faith.
Discussions of the Bible are part of the program.

    promote religious understanding and cooperation, and to
    stimulate participation in the development of spiritual,
    moral, and ethical campus life.
      And how are these purposes to be accomplished? The

In Pitt’s awareness of the general public need for better
mental health, it has leaned heavily on the experts and tech-
nicians of the VVestern Psychiatric Hospital, also on the upper
campus, which was Built in 1944 and presented to the Uni-
versity by the governor of the Commonwealth in 1949 to
maintain its original purpose of aiding those district citizens
in need of mental therapy. It is a testing laboratory not only
for graduates and undergraduates, but for the whole com-
munity.

                THE 1956 OWL
Fifty years ago in 1906, the students, faculty, and administration
agreed that it would be a good idea to have a. yearbook. But after
the editor and his staff were chosen, they met with their initial
problem: choosing a name for the new publication; the publication
that was to remind future alumni of their school.
  Everyone on the staff had their, favorite name with the result
that the publication was in a quandary. Then one smart young lad
came up with the poem, "The Owl and the Pussy Cat." This lad
and other smart young lads figured that the "Pussy Cat" was the
panther, longtime mascot of the University. Certainly, there was
an appropriate place beside the "Pussy Cat" for his partner, the
Owl. And so, for fifty years, the "Pussy Cat" and the Owl have
sailed steadily on, watching Pitt grow and expand. The Owl, itself, has grown from a small book containing only senior pictures
to a pictorial history of the University. The tradition which began
so many years ago has continued strongly in the 1956 Owl.

Finding a theme was not a difficult problem this
year. Editor Joe Banik and his assistant, Betty
Ann Young agreed that "Pitt Through the Eyes
of the Owl" was an excellent fifieth anniversary
theme. Joe made a series of changes in the book.
New features were added and others were enlarged. The fraternity sweetheart section took on
a new look and an administration section and an
index were added to the book.
  Joe and Betty Ann combined their efforts with
Tom Vrana, the photo editor and color photographer. With the addition of Don Miller, literary
editor, the book began to take shape.
  After the semester began, the other section
editors began their work, molding their individual
section into a cohesive unit.
  The business manager, Leo Zelkowitz, also
began his work early. Leo had the responsibility
of making the budget and then directing the rest
of the staff in following it. He was often called a
Scrooge but the budget balanced. Assisted by
Gene Reinbold and Neal Zweig, the book was a
financial success.

 Even before the Pitt News published its initial edition in
 September, the editors received the first of a stream of
 "big stories." The administration announced that Edward
 A. Litchfield of Cornell University had been selected to
 succeed Chancellor Fitzgerald. In quick succession, ban ner headlines announced the football team had been in vited to play Georgia Tech in the New Orleans "Sugar
 Bowl" and the $3,000,000 purchase of the Schenley Apart ments for uses as student-faculty dormitories and the
 student union. Later, the Pitt News also carried the story
 of Pitt's second big purchase, the Schenley Park Hotel
 for $1,800,000.
 Again and again, banner headlines flashed important
 news articles such as acting Chancellor Nutting's announce ment that he would leave Pitt to head the philanthropic
 Buhl Foundation. The purchase of the Hubbard Reserva tion in North Park, the formation of a Council of Religious
 Organization on the Pitt campus and Dr. Jonas Salk's
receiving the Pittsburgh "Man of the Year" award were
among the top stories.

surpassed the Pittsburgh papers by obtaining the first
press interview with General Matthew B. Ridgway since
arriving in Pittsburgh to serve as chairman of Mellon
Institute. Vigorous writing by campus editor Gordon
Clowney brought to the attention of student and faculty
the inadequate civil defense procedures within the University.
  Editorial policy stressed the need for extra-curricular
activities which were purposeful in supplementing academics, rather than those loosely organized groups and
"out-dated traditions" which were supported on the basis
of "self-preservation."
  Under the administration of Irving Rothman and business manager George Fowkes, the Pitt News celebrated its
fiftieth anniversary. The Pitt News, again, combined with
the Evening News periodically, swelling circulation on such
occasions to 12,000 copies. In its head, the Pitt News carries a motto that it believes and constantly strives to
follow: One of America's GREAT Student Newspapers.

  SKYSCRAPER ENGINEER
This spring the Skyscraper Engineer completed its fifth
year as a college engineering magazine. Since the first
issue in May of 1951, the Skyscraper Engineer has grown
rapidly and today has a commanding role in the life of the
Pitt engineering students. Not only does the magazine
interest students in engineering research, but it also helps
to spread the knowledge of Pitt's engineering activities.
In March, the Skyscraper helps initiate Engineering Week
in which the engineers promote Saint Patrick as their
patron. Aside from the copies that are sold to the students
on campus, the Skyscraper Engineer is circulated throughout the world to the alumni, high school students, other
colleges, and business men in all fields.
  All of the articles in the magazine are not staff pieces,
the Skyscraper prints contributions from students in the
entire engineering school.
  During the year, the magazine also helps to promote
different affairs throughout the year such as the E. and M.
dance and mixer dances for the engineering students.

  The Skyscraper Engineer was kept financially stable by
the fine efforts of Don Rooney as business manager. Don
was assisted by Ed Ellis and advertising manager Tom

  The success of the magazine is due largely to the hard
work and interest of the entire staff. The interest of these

   of 1955 when a group of publications students banded to   gether to give Pitt its first student magazine since 1952.
     Three of the six editions were published during the fall
   semester. These contained features on student activity,
   sports, prominent Pittites, and fiction.
     The format of the magazine was changed at the begin   ning of the spring semester. The first issue contained a

issues accentuated the lighter side of such events as graduation, Tap Day, and Spring Festival.

dimensions this year with a complete change of format.
  Under the astute editorship of Paul Baumgartner and
the business promotion of Rae Schalit, the Capsule became
a slick magazine printed in the "offset process" as opposed
to its newspaper format of the previous years.
  The excellent black and white photograph reproductions
made the book in its several editions a thing of beauty--
not to mention the profound and technically interesting
articles on the many new advances in the field of pharmacy.
  Among the pharmacy students the magazine proved to
be a boon to flagging interests, since it supplied them with
writings on various subjects not covered in their field of
training.
  The book attracted many new and welcome friends. The
newest member of the publications family, The Pitt Capsule was recognized as outstanding in its field by students,
professional pharmacists, and the faculty.

More is to come, we know. That is progress. And today
becomes the past with all its meanings, all its mysteries. But
the memories that remain—~the frenzied days, the studies,
the reflections, all the intensities of life in this University are
set down here. This book does not attempt to recapture the
past, but to show, through the eyes of the Owl that have seen
Pitt students for a half century, how our senior year moved
forward from event to event and how we lived it.

Four members of the Glee Club "tune up" before singing at the annual
Christmas program held at Stephen Foster Memorial.
The tenor section of Men's Glee Club, harmonizes to one of the popular
melodies sung at the annual Chancellor's Reception in the Commons
Room.
The Pitt Men's Glee Club is the all-male singing group on campus.
It is under the direction-and has been for the last nine years-of
David G. Weiss.
  Since it was first organized over sixty-six years ago, the Glee
Club has grown into a singing group of more than fifty men.
  Any man who has an interest in the organization and an amount
of singing ability may have an audition with the director.
  The men practice every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday to be
able to sing at such important University functions as the Chancellor's Reception and the Mid-Year Commencement.
  Once each year they also hold a spring banquet and take a tour
through the East. Last year the men went on a tour which took
them to Boston, where they had a good time, and above all"sang to their heart's content!"

To promote an interest among University students in the
living theatre and drama is the aim of Pitt Players.
  From the wit and humor of the American theatre, the
students working on Pitt Players have tried to bring
laughter and comedy to the audience in "Bernardine" and
"Mr. Roberts."
  A well performed and well planned year came to an
interesting conclusion with Shaw's "Pygmalion." During
this excellent year, the "Madwomen of Chaillot" gave the
audience a change of pace with this eerie and mysterious
drama.
  Along with a reception after each opening night performance, a film classics movie night, an annual banquet with
the technicians, business and production staffs, student
and faculty administrators, ended the social and dramatic
season for Pitt Players.

All types of classical music is the fare of Women's Choral.
While the group tries to further interest in choral work,
they succeeded this year in making up a program which
was pleasant and varied enough to please the most earweary listener.
  After an interview with the choral director, approved
members soon became engrossed in singing in the Chapel.
At a spring Chapel concert, they came forth with a brilliant rendition of the famous Gregorian chant "Stabat
Mater." They were accompanied by a stringed quartet.
  Earlier in the year the group performed at Beaux Arts.
They also went on many tours to entertain at veteran's
hospitals, army hospitals, and many civic groups.
  Besides a picnic in the spring, a workshop for members,
and attempts at a choral camp, members of two years
were awarded keys for their outstanding work.
These members of choral are practicing for their annual Christmas program which they put on for the benefit of the University.

To enlarge the scope of speech activities throughout the
University and to encourage women to participate in discussion, debate, poetry reading, and radio activities in the
University is the purpose of the Women's Speech Association. The group welcomes to membership any woman
interested in speech activities.
  The group participates in such activities as debate
tournaments, radio broadcasts over WMCK, and programs for high school assemblies and service groups. Each
year the Association presents a Beaux Arts Show for freshman women in Foster Memorial as well as a women's
poetry reading program.
  Among the debating awards won by the Women's
Speech Association during the past year was second place
in the Carnegie Tech Annual Tartan Tournament and
first place in the Westminster Novice Tournament.

Engineering and Mines Cabinet got off to a high
speed start in the social swirl with its Fall Ball,
held at West View Park's Danceland during the
first weekend in November.
  Four hundred couples waltzed, mamboed, and
bunny-hopped the whole evening to the razzledazzle and swing upbeats of Bill LeRoy and his
enthusiastic orchestra. To say the men and their
pretty dates had a good time is indeed an understatement.
  This first of the Cabinet's social functions
reached its climax of the evening when a couple
was chosen to receive the special door prizes. The
man and woman were presented with an electric
shaver and a portable radio, respectively.
  All in all, every member of the Fall Ball was
convinced that this first affair of the year was the
best ever.
Door prize winners received a portable radio and an electric razor.
The engineers wined, dined, and danced.
        CHRISTMAS BALL
The Commons Room provided the impressive setting for
the annual Christmas Ball, one of Pitt's traditional affairs.
Girls in their whispering gowns and men in their formal
attire gave an additional elegance to the majestic hall,
decked at this time of year with dark green holly and yew.
   What the atmosphere did not give to this Ball, the season of the holidays did-thus assuring the many couples
who attended an experience they would always remember
as one of the most exciting in their years as undergraduates.
  But medieval grandeur was not the only influence felt
that night. The air was full of the music of the latest hits,
and they mixed nostalgically with the more familiar and
time-honored Christmas carols.
   Yes, the night was a romantic one, the orchestra as
 smooth as a gold satin slipper. It was just the right touch
 to put students in the mind for peace on earth.
 Bright and dark colors flash through the Commons Room.
Holly and mistletoe present a romantic atmosphere for the dancing

INTERFRATERNITY BALL
   The ballroom of the William Penn Hotel was the
   colorful background of the Interfraternity Ball, held
   February first, the last day of the fall semester exam   inations. Yet, according to the happy faces at the
   dance, the exams by that night were a thing of the
   past, and students seemed in a mood to have a little
   fun between semesters. And they certainly did.
     The biggest event of the evening was the crowning
   of the Queen of the I.F. Ball. This year the coveted
   award went to Eleanor Leslie.
     Further entertainment was whipped up by the
   Mellowlrks, who literally stopped all action on the
   dance floor when they got to singing a little Rock
'n' Roll.
     Another part of the festive evening was the pres   entation of the Scholarship Trophy, given to Phi    The Mellowlarks rocked and rolled their way to the popularity of the crowd.

  These were the questions and the guesses that flew
around campus like scattered Valentines during the few
days before Pitt's annual Heart Hop, held in the Schenley
Park Hotel.
  The night of the dance, all contestants stuck out their
feet for the careful scrutiny of the foot-sizing experts, Mr.
Theodore W. Biddle, dean of men, and various shoe salesmen who were drafted for this very special job.
  After much foot work, the experts came up with the
perfect fit-Miss Elaine Kalaras.
  It certainly was a sudden and happy revelation for
Elaine, who almost upon the spot was crowned Pitt's
Queen of Hearts. The Dean of Men, playing the role of a
gallant Prince Charming, danced the first waltz of an almost endless round that lasted well into the gay February
night.

GREEKS
  WHAT IS A SORORITY?
To many, a sorority is just a group of girls but... it is
more than that.
  A sorority is a happy experience that its girls will remember for a lifetime. Many of the girls themselves look
upon a sorority as the inseparable bond that joins one with
the other. There are not many places where girls of different backgrounds can say to each other, "We are one.
You can come to me any time and without fear or doubt
say,'Will you help me?' "
  The pin that a sorority girl wears is an emblem of
distinction; it is worn with pride. Whether the group in
which she is a member is large or small, she wears their
emblem. She is their representative. She tries to the best
of her ability to fulfil the aims of her group.
  Through the years of her undergraduate days, she is a
source of cheer to her sisters. She likes her friends, her
sorority and her school.

     ALPHA DELTA PI
The Women's Guilds profited greatly from the
assistance of Alpha Delta Pi last year. Their
president, Jody McIlvain, was choral guild adviser, and Annabel Fawcett headed the Twelfth
Floor Guild.
  Other influential Alpha Delta Pis included
Lucy Tiberio, WSGA representative for Panhellenic Council, Sandra Johnston, member of
debate and women's speech, and Ann DeGraw,
member of Cwens.
  The group as a whole participated actively in
the Greek Week competition. They hammered
nails and cut out chicken wire for their front,
"Flying High," and they joined with Sigma Alpha Epsilon in brushing black paint onto their
float, "Tar Baby."
  They sponsored a black and white formal in
December and gave several tea dances during the
year. The Alpha Delta Pi local project was to
stuff animals, dolls for Children's Hospital.

Disney's dog, "Pluto" won over the judges in

skit in turn won over the real judges for a second
place trophy.
  One week later, the Pitt chapter of Alpha Epsilon Phi combined forces with the Tech chapter
for a gala Hallowe'en party. The two also held a
dessert bridge together to celebrate their Founders Day.
  One of the sorority's most unusual dances was
their Barn Dance and they held a spring formal
and Seniors' Day Luncheon as well.
  Last year many children benefited from the
services of Alpha Epsilon Phi. They supported a
war orphan and took time to carry on an active
correspondence with him. Another project was a
Christmas party for orphans from various homes
around Pittsburgh.

A YEAR AT PITT

TI-“ROUGH

TI-"E EYES
OF THE OWL

Selecting the highlights of a year is a difficult task.
An editor must sift the important happenings
from the trivial occurrences; the interesting
events from the uninteresting incidents. VVhat
events are meaningful to some may be of no im-
portance to others. How is it possible to pick out
these features? The best way is to watch the stu-
dents; their expressions, happy or indifferent;
their enthusiasm over the different events. These
people called students are the best judges.

Nobody liked registration. It was a gruelling
race to obtain class cards, ﬁll out forms, and pay
tuition. The seniors moaned but the fact that
only spring registration was left cheered them. Be-
wildered, the freshman plodded through it. The
student body deluged the faculty and advisors
with questions concerning classes, tuition, and
credits needed for graduation. They answered
with smiles, chuckling comments, and sometimes
blushingly with, “I just don’t know.”

Some had to ponder over schedules . . .

Others became angry when they didn't
receive the right class . . .

18 Still others were completely confused.

BETA SIGMA OMICRON
Beta   Sigma   Omicron   celebrated its twentyfifth year on campus with a Silver Anniversary
Tea. Through these twenty-five years, the sorority has successfully aimed at seeking friendship
and stimulating group activities.
  These activities marked every season in the
Beta calendar. In the fall, they entered the float
parade and Stunt Night competition and held
bowling parties. They celebrated Christmas with
an orphans' party and a sorority party, and they
greeted spring with picnics and a dinner dance.
  Their main project was supporting the Pine
Mountain Settlement School in Harlan County,
Kentucky, which has very limited facilities for
building and supplies.
  Beta Sigma Omicron national headquarters
are now in Pittsburgh, and Pittsburgh alumnae
hold two national offices, president and treasurer.

Delta Delta Delta began the year with a crop of
new ideas gathered by President Florence Dougherty last summer at the National Leadership
School, the first school of its kind to be held by a
women's fraternal organization.
   They proved their campus leadership during
 Greek Week by capturing three first place tro phies: for participation, Homecoming front, and a
 Stunt Night skit, and a third place prize for their
 float.
   Individual leadership was ably furnished by
 Emily English and LaVerne Dunten, Mortar
 Board members, and Dorothy Tear, head cheer leader.
   Cultural meetings fitted into the Tri-Delta's
 program of broadening their moral and in tellectual life. They rounded out this schedule
 with a Founders Day Banquet, Pine Party,
 Pansy breakfast, two formal dances, tea dances,
 a benefit bridge, and a bazaar.

 through an array of spry little figures in a "Jim miny Cricket" theme. Theta also joined with Pi
 Lambda Theta to make a float, "Peter Pan," and
 they took part in Stunt Night with a clever skit
 based on "Cinderella."

               PHI MU
The Phi Mu's goal-to cooperate with the University in promoting high scholarship and cultural standards-was fully attained last year by
giving a scholarship to a foreign student, Claudia
Henry. Claudia, whose hometown is Brisbane,
Australia, came to Pitt in order to study with Dr.
Salk.
  The scientific bent of many Phi Mus is shown
by the number who have been tapped to scientific
honoraries in the past. Last year, Jane Paladin
was a member of Beta Beta Beta, the biology
honorary, which has included Phi Mus for two
consecutive years.
   Science was not the only inclination of this active sorority. Their athletic interests were furthered by several bowling parties, and they enjoyed a variety of dances-from    square dances
and monthly tea dances to two formals.

  The Phi Sigs put aside their blue jeans to participate in many of the social events of the year.
They entered a skit, "Old King Cole," in Stunt
Night, joined the Greek Sing with "Silver Bells,"
celebrated their Founder's Day, and gave a service at Hillel. Their dances included a winter
formal, a barn dance, and tea dances.

Sigma Delta Taus can be proud of their record
for 1955-56. Their first big mark for the year was
the prize-winning singles float, "Snow White,"
which paraded to first place in the Homecoming
competition last October.
  Several of the sorority members held outstanding positions on the Pitt campus. Bunny
Reingold was vice president of the junior class,
Beverly Levin was a senior mentor, and Lenore
Hirsch was chairman of Religion-in-Life Week.
  All the Sigma Delta Taus devoted many hours
to reading to hospital patients, donating to blood
research, and entertaining orphans at a Christmas
party.
  The group entertained their parents with a
Mothers' Day Luncheon and a "Daddy-Daughter" party; and amused themselves at a dinner
dance in December as well as a picnic in May.

joined with its Alumnae Association in acting as
hostesses for the Eastern Province, which was
held in Pittsburgh this year. The four chapters
at this convention joined together in promoting
the main aim of the sorority, a feeling of closeness and unity within the group.
  Throughout the year, the sorority gave lodge
parties, tea dances, parents' teas, and two formals.
They entered into the spirit of Greek Week with
a menacing house front: "Blacken the Eyes of
Miami."
  At Christmas, they dressed up dolls and gave
them to orphans at the annual "Doll Party."
  Theta Phi Alphas center many of their activities around Catholic interests. Every month they

WHAT IS A FRATERNITY?
  What is a fraternity? It is more than a simple dictionary
  definition, certainly: the condition or relation of brotherhood
  -though this is the key to a fraternity's significance.
    At Pitt fraternity life complements socially the academic
  stimulus of the classroom. Fraternity life molds each mem  ber's character, friendliness, citizenship, and social aware  ness.
    These spheres of influence are the fraternity's testing
  ground. Here is where the individual member is tested and
  proved. Through rushing programs, initiations, banquets,
  and the constructiveness of Help Week, fraternity men
  show themselves emotionally mature and well enough
  adjusted to realize that work and fun go together in a
  fraternity. This fact is important to anyone aware of the
  potentialities that may come from the blending of the two,
  as shown in each of Pitt's nineteen social fraternities.

President of Men's Council.

    PI KAPPA ALPHA
Since 1934, when the Gamma Sigma Chapter was
founded, Pi Kappa Alpha has established itself as
a strong fraternity at Pitt.
  From the early fall to the late spring, the
PiKAs had a whirl of social activity. Their winter
formal, the "Dream Girl Dance," and a formal
weekend in June were peaks in their social program. Between times the calendar was circled
with frequent lodge parties, house dances, and
pledge parties.
  Their aim, "to promote the welfare and development of its members and of the fraternity," led
them into many activities at school. They took
an active role in IF athletics, Greek Week, and
Spring Festival. One of their most active men on
campus was John King, president of Interfraternity Council. Yet all the brothers worked hard
to make the year one of the best in their history.

Uniqueness is a good word to describe the Gamma
Sigma Chapter of Pi Lambda Phi, one of the largest fraternities at Pitt.
  They are the only fraternity at the University
which has a complete basketball court. They also
have an outdoor patio which was put to good use
during the year for their numerous social and
group functions.
  Pi Lam's outstanding men      included  Leo
Zelkowitz, business manager of the Owl, Larry
Miller, secretary of Interfraternity  Council,
Sheldon Monsein, Maccabean Olympics swimming champ, and Paul Kramer, deputy wing
commander in Air Force R.O.T.C.
  Each year they have participated in a major
charitable project. Recently they collected books
for the Veterans Hospital. Altogether they gave
over 1000 books to the veterans.

Nationally, Sigma Pi is one of the oldest fraternities. Locally, however, the chapter is relatively
young, returning to campus in 1948.
   Since then they have been actively engaged in
rebuilding their fraternity. Their membership is
continuing to grow after several semesters of intense rushing. They also are improving and remodeling their house on Melwood Street, and
striving to raise their scholastic attainment.

Just as successful were the South-Sea Island

  Pitt's whole athletic set-up is beginning to show the
results that the department has been striving for. The

since the late 1930's. The track, soccer, cross-country,
wrestling, swimming-in fact every Panther entry in the
field of intercollegiate athletics posted records the University can be proud of.
  This was no accident. It was the result of a carefully
worked out and carefully followed plan, for which the department deserves no small amount of praise.

Pitt capped their most successful season since 1938 by being
awarded the Lambert Trophy, emblematic of Eastern football supremacy. The last Pitt squad to win this award was
the 1937 team, which was quarterbacked by Johnny Michelosen, the present Panther coach.
  The award committee gave the honor to the Panthers because of "their tremendous improvement in the last half of
the season." Navy, who defeated Pitt earlier in the season,
was the runnerup in the balloting.

Coach Michelosen nervously bites
his fingernails as Cal jumps
off to an early 7-0 lead.
In a manner reminiscent of the brute power tactics of the
Sutherland era, the Panthers opened their 1955 season with
a 21-7 victory over California's Golden Bears.
  Using the airlanes only as a last resort, Coach John Michelosen's prodigies ripped the California forward    wall to
shreds. The Blue and Gold picked up 274 yards on the ground
while limiting "their West Coast opponents to only 29 yards
rushing.
  The Panthers started slow, but once they got rolling it
was all over. They spotted the Bears a seven point lead and
tied the count just before time ran out in the first half, Sophomore Dick Bowen and senior Bobby Grier each crossed the
goal line twice to share scoring honors.

         Continuing their winning ways-and their penchant for
         coming from behind-the Panthers chalked up their second
         straight victory of the season 22-12, over the Syracuse Or         angemen in rain-drenched Archibald Stadium.
           The Orangemen completely dominated the first half of
         play even though they trailed 7-6 at the intermission. The
         second half proved to be completely reversed, however, as
         the Blue and Gold came to life to score two touchdowns and
         a safety while limiting Syracuse to a single consolation score.
           Pitt's defensive line played another great game, limiting
         the opposition to only six yards rushing in the second half
         and going through its second game without allowing a touch         down on the ground.

Panther Offense Fails;

Revenge minded Navy handed the Panthers their second
straight setback by completely stymieing the local's offense
in the process of registering a 21-0 victory.
  Pitt started out as if they were going to make a runaway
out of the game by returning the opening kickoff to the Navy
four, but lost the ball on downs and from then on it was all
Navy. After this early drive the locals never even threatened.
  The Middies' line stopped the Panther's powerful ground
game and allowed Salvaterra to get off only one pass, which
was intercepted. Time after time the hard charging Navy
linemen dropped Blue and Gold ball carriers in their own
backfield for huge losses. One of the few bright spots for Pitt
was the sensational punting of Bill Schmidt, who averaged
42 yards per kick on the muddy field.

Glad to be playing in the stadium for the first time in a
month, the Panther gridders celebrated by downing Nebraska 21-7.
  As usual, the visitors scored first, but their lead was short
lived. The locals had little trouble in running through the
Cornhuskers line and scored two quick touchdowns. Pete
Neft, playing at quarterback as a result of a personal shakeup, engineered the Panthers first two scores and played a
superb game both on offense and defense.
  The entire team seemed to respond to the local surroundings and they played more as they had in the beginning of
the season. Lou Cimarolli, Corky Cost, and Tom Jenkins,
aided by a charged-up offensive line, sparked the Panther's

                  For Major Upset, 26-7
    Before stunned oddsmakers and a partisan Duke crowd, the
    Panthers pulled one of the season's major upsets by dropping
    the Blue Devils from the ranks of the undefeated, 96-7, to
    register their fourth triumph of the season.
       Playing as if they never had read the pre-game reports,
     the Blue and Gold completely dominated the second half to
     turn the contest into a rout. Trailing 7-6 at the half, the
     Michelosen men began to move in the third quarter and put
     the game out of reach.
       Corny Salvaterra and Pete Neft, alternating at quarter     back, mixed their plays beautifully to completely befuddle
     the Dixie defenders. Panther end Joe Walton caught two
     touchdown passes tying a Pitt record in that department,
     while Neft and Dick Bowen led the ground attack.

 "Hard luck" Miami finally erupted and played up to its full
 potential as it put the third set-back on the Panther's record
 by scoring an easy 21-7 victory in rain-drenched Pitt Stadium.
   Pitt showed once again that it definitely could not get its
ground attack operating efficiently on a wet field. The Hurricanes, on the other hand, weren't hindered by the wet ball
at all. They passed and used tricky ball handling plays all
afternoon without losing a fumble. In fact, they put on just
about the best display of razzle-dazzle ball handling ever
seen in the stadium.
   The only consolation for the thirty thousand faithful fans
 who braved the elements was the superb pre-game show pre pared for Pitt's homecoming celebration.

Looking ahead to next week's game with the undefeated
Mountaineers almost proved fatal to the Panthers who had
to come from behind to squeeze out an 18-7 victory over the
Virginia Cavaliers.
  The Cavaliers, winners in only one of their six previous
games, played better than they had all year, and for a time
"it appeared that they might pull a stunning upset. However,
quarterback Pete Neft and end Joe Walton got together in
the last quarter on a couple of pass plays to assure a victory
over the stubborn southerners.
  The victory was the Panthers' fifth and assured them of
doing no worse than breaking even for the season-which
Swould have been  the best record the B lue and G old had
posted since the 1952 season.

September and October had come and gone. November brought
with it dropping temperatures and icy winds that sent Pitt stu-
dents scurrying indoors. The logs in the ﬁreplaces of the Commons
Room burned brightly.

But with it, November brought Beaux Arts Day, sponsored by
the VVomen’s Speech Association. Beaux Arts Day is dedicated to
the muses of music, dancing, oral reading, theatre, painting, or
cartooning. It is truly an “ars pro artis” day. It is dedicated as
well to the appreciation of art which surrounds the Pitt student in
everyday life, especially at the University.

This year the annual Beaux Arts show was presented on the
stage of Foster l\'Ien1orial, following the theme of “Peanuts Comes
To Pitt.” The comical little characters of Hank Schultz’s “Pea-
nuts”WLucy, Schroeder, and Linus~rmade a pleasing impression
on the audience.

All types of songs from the early American “Spin, Spin, llly
Darling Da’ughte7*” to the English “Drink: T 0 M 6 Only With Thine
Eyes” were offered and sung by the \Vomen’s Choral and Varsity
Quartet. The International Dance Group presented a Scottish
(lance called the “Triple Sword Dance.” Finally to end the day,
lVI r. l\IcHale and his Pitt Players gave a preview of their next play,
“The Zvladwoman of (,7haill0t.”

The “Triple Sword Dance” was performed as part of the
Beaux Arts program.

Sixty thousand people witnessed the high point of the 1955
season as the Panthers, for the second straight year, ruined
West Virginia's hopes for an undefeated season by swamping
the Mountaineers 26-7.
  The Blue and Gold gridders played their finest game of the
year in disposing of the awesome Mounties and so impressed
officials from several bowl games that a post season appearance was virtually assured them. Pete Neft played a brilliant
game at quarterback to continue his "come back" story.
  The defensive standout was senior end John Paluck, who
smashed through the huge Mountie line on numerous occasions to nail Mountaineer ball carriers. West Virginia
scored its lone touchdown after time had run out and a mob
of people had engulfed the field in one of the most hectic
finishes ever seen in the stadium.

Panthers Blank State, 20-0,
       In Snow; Sugar Bowl Bound
Playing flawless football on snow-covered Beaver Field, the
1955 Panthers gained revenge for three previous Pitt teams
by blanking Penn State 20-0. It marked the first time in four
years that a Panther crossed the Lion's goal line.
  Two seniors, quarterback Pete Neft and halfback Lou
Cimarolli, ended their regular college careers in the traditional
blaze of glory. Neft handled and passed the wet ball very
well, and Cimarolli gained 70 yards rushing in eleven attempts. The big story of the game was the manner in which
Pitt's hard charging line stopped State's great Lenny Moore
-holding him to eleven yards in thirteen carries.
  The convincing win was all the Sugar Bowl committee
needed to invite the Panthers to the Sugar Bowl.

Pitt halfback Lou Cimarolli finds a hole in the strong Georgia Tech line
and picks up 10 yards.
School-spirited Pitt students traveled 1500 miles to New Orleans to cheer
the Panthers.
Johnny Michelosen's Panther gridders started off the New
Year by winning everything except the ball game from a
good-and lucky-Georgia Tech team.
  The Panthers piled up nine more first downs than their
Southern opponents and their offensive unit netted 171
more yards on the ground and through the air-but the
final score still read 7-0 in favor of the Engineers from
Dixie.
  Over eighty-thousand fans, including fourteen-hundred
from Pittsburgh, witnessed one of the most exciting and
hardest fought football games in the twenty-two year
history of the Sugar Bowl. Tech capitalized on a Pitt
fumble and an interference penalty to score the game's
only touchdown early in the first quarter and then concentrated on trying to stop the powerful Panther ground
attack.
  After the Tech score, Corny Salvaterra led the Panthers
on a 79 yard drive that was stopped on.the Georgia one
yard line as the half came to an end.
  The second half was almost a continuation of the first.
The big Panther line opened up huge holes for Pete Neft,
Bobby Grier, Lou Cimarolli and Salvaterra as the Blue
and Gold repeatedly moved down the field, only to be
stopped short of the goal-line by the stubborn Engineers.

Pitt's most successful basketball team-in terms of winssince the 1930's wound up its campaign with a record of
15-10.
  This year's record was almost exactly the reverse of
last season's and indicates that the Panthers are on the
way up in the court game.
  Sparked by the sensational play of their two scoring
twins-Bob Lazor and John Riser-the Panthers outscored such perennially tough teams as Michigan, Virginia,
Utah State, and Yale as well as posting double wins over
Carnegie Tech, Westminster, and Penn State.
  Lazor and Riser, who both averaged over twenty points
per game, were aided by Captain Joe Fenwick, the only
senior on the starting quintet, and Julius Pegues and
Chuck Hursh, a talented pair of sophomores.
  Other members of Coach Bob Timmons' squad who saw
plenty of action were Frank Zimmovan-one of only two
seniors on the squad-John Lanieve, Fred Yee, Howard
Lester, Eugene Cercone, Barry Brautigam, Phil Kleiman,
and Dennis Dorman.
  Joining the eleven returnees from this season will be the
members of Pitt's freshman squad which dropped only
three contests during the season. Leading the frosh were
a trio of All-State selections-Don Hennon, Floyd Simpson, and Dave Sawyer.

Moving into college soccer's "big-time," coach Leo Bemis'
soccerites proved themselves more than capable by posting a
good 8-4 record.
  The Panthers scored 55 goals while limiting the opposition
to only 19 goals in twelve contests, with Duke being the only
team to shut-out the locals. Bob Cherry, Jerry Bresanelli,
and Sami Hazou were the leading scorers for the Bemismen
while Norm Zanardelli and Mike Culhane, who was out half
of the season with injuries, were the defensive bulwarks.
  Duke, Navy, Penn State, and Nofith Carolina State were
the only teams to top the Panthers in their second season of
varsity action. All of the other opponents, including Ohio
State, Case, Denison, Franklin and Marshall, and Slippery
Rock lost by large margins.
  With losses from graduation not expected to be too heavy,
and with the finest freshmen soccer squad Pitt has had since
it resumed the sport, chances for the future look even brighter.

Coach Carl Olson's harriers did something no
other Panther cross-country team has been able
to do-win the IC4A championships. This marked
a fitting climax for the runners who posted an
eight and one record over the season.
  They beat such powers as Ohio State, Penn
State, Army, Manhattan and the star-studded
Quantico Marines without much trouble, and
bowed only to Villanova by the close margin of
30-27.
  Captain Arnie Sowell, Pitt's most renowned
athlete, paced the Olsonmen to most of their victories. After a slow start, Sowell regained his
form and was virtually unbeatable during the
regular season. He finished a close second in a
field of over 300 runners in the IC4A's. Thornton
Smith, Wendel Harford, Tom Jessup, Jack Shubert, Jim Moore, Dave Freas, Dan Sutter, Perry
Jones, Dan O'Connor, and Ed Saunders were the
other harriers to compete for the Eastern Champion Panthers this season.
  Coach Olson's runners ran their string of consecutive dual-meet victories to twenty, stretching
back over three seasons, before losing to Villanova. However, they finished the rest of the season undefeated to once again establish their
claim of being Pitt's'most successful representative
in the collegiate sports field.

One of the few sure bets in the unpredictable field of sports
is that the Pitt swimmers will win the Eastern Swimming
Championship. For the fifth straight year they finished
their season with a win at the Easterns, held this year at
New York University.
  During the regular season they posted an 8-4 record
against the best competition available. Coach Ben Grady's
proteges posted triumphs over Miami, VMI, Ohio University, Syracuse, Penn, Rutgers, Lehigh, and West Virginia. They were defeated by North Carolina State, Colgate, Army, and Navy.
  Seniors Jim Zurcher, Hank Zentgraf, and Captain Skip
Monsein were aided by Lou Durbin, Ed Robson, Tony
Tresser, Warne White, Ben Sklar, Bernie Baur, Willis
Weiss, Burt Marks, and Milo Fischer in compiling their
winning record.
  Zurcher and Monsein ended their careers by winning
gold medals at the Easterns for the third straight year.
Zurcher has never been defeated in his specialties-the
220 and 440-yard freestyle events, while Monsein excels
in the backstroke. Sophomores Durbin, Robson, and
Tresser also won Eastern Championships.

The big day in the hearts of many alumni and
students had arrived: January second, the day of
the Sugar Bowl game. Though Pitt lost a tight
defensive game, the people of the South found the
Northerners to be a personable group. The Pitt-
ites distinguished themselves as being completely
friendly before, during, and after the game.

The fans enjoyed their stay in New Orleans.
The cathedrals, the intricate architectural fea-
tures of the French Quarter, and the wide expanse
of the l\Iississippi River fascinated them. In the
evening, the Pittsburghers made their rounds 01
such nightspots as the Famous Door, the Absinthe
House, and Pat O’Brien’s. The fans would re-
member their trip to New Orleans for a long time

Tired and happy, the people began their jour-
ney back to Pittsburgh. In the trains and buses
the students played cards and charades to pas.

Although Coach Rex Peery's muscle-men have consistently turned in the best records of all Pitt's entries in
inter-collegiate sports, one goal eluded them-an undefeated season. It eluded them, that is, until this year when
they won ten straight meets-four of them by shutoutsand capped this off by winning the Eastern Championships by a narrow margin over Penn State.
  The season's final win over the Penn State Lions was
especially sweet for the Peerymen. Twice before they had
undefeated seasons within their reach only to lose to the
Lions in the season's final meet.
  Pitt scored 249 points during the campaign while holding the opposition to only 35. Leading the grapplers were
Captain Ed DeWitt, who finished his college career undefeated in dual-meet competition, Bill Hulings, Ed Peery,
Vic DeFelice, Bob Bubb, Dave Johnson, Don Huff, and
Ron Schrif. DeWitt, Huff, and Johnson also captured wins
in the Easterns.
  The season proved a fitting tribute to Coach Peery, who
in five years has made Pitt the top wrestling team in the
country.

Panthers gave evidence of what is to come as they showed
that they could hold their own with most of the leading
eastern teams.

Coach Warren Neiger's gymnasts finished their second
season of varsity competition with a respectable 4-4 record
compiled against some of the east's toughest teams.
  The Panther tumblers proved too strong for Lock
Haven, West Chester, West Virginia, and Temple. They
dropped a close decision to the Syracuse Orangemen and
were outclassed by perennially strong Army, Navy, and
Penn State.
  Leading scorers for the Blue and Gold were John Hammond, Tom Darling, Jim Mulvihill, Don Shima, Walt
Starz, Charles Kerver, Joe Lamartine, and John Ruber.
  All indications point to an even better record next season
since most of this year's squad plus several promising
freshmen prospects will be available for action.

    multitude of other cheers to fans from Pitt Stadium to
    New Orleans and back again as their contribution to the
    Panther's athletic renaissance. Taking their cue from the
    players, who finally gave them something to cheer about,
    the cheerleaders went all out and really had the old Sta    dium rocking on Saturday afternoons.
      Helping the cheerleaders increase audience participation
   to a new high were the Panther gymnasts who performed
   their acrobatics along the sidelines during the games and
   the students participating in Block P.

WOMEN'S
         RECREATION
                   ASSOCIATION
Mary Sabados, Education 1957, participated
in WRA's bowling program.
"Fun for every girl at Pitt" was the theme of the Women's
Recreation Association schedule for 1955-56. In all of its
activities, the organization aimed at promoting a spirit of
fair play and giving each individual an opportunity to enjoy recreation as a whole. Group sports, individual sports,
and parties were all organized and carried out enthusiastically.
  Back to school problems were relieved by a corn roast
and a freshman party. Volleyball games started off the
tournaments for the year, followed by basketball and
table tennis.
  Once a month WRA held "Fun for Everyone" nights.
A welcome for transfer students and a swimming party
were two of WRA's outstanding programs.
  The annual carnival relays were held on the Cathedral
lawn in May, and the group also sponsored a spring weekend at Oglebay Park.

The Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity house really whooped it up after they became intramural, inter-fraternity, and

           INTRAMURALS
Scattered throughout the Oakland vicinity during the
school year can be found groups of students with varied
equipment participating in all types of competitive sports.
These students are part of an intramural program in which
twelve hundred students participate. You name it, and
chances are that I.M. Director Leo Bemis has it: bowling,
volleyball, wrestling, squash, swimming, handball, softball,
football, fencing, and many others.
   Highlights of the intramural season were the spirited
battles for trophies in the touch football and basketball
leagues. Pi Kappa Alpha defeated Delta Sigma Delta in
the football finals and went on to capture the city championship with a convincing triumph over Duquesne's entry.
  The powerhouses of the basketball league were the Phi
Gams and the Sigma Chi's from the fraternity leagues
and the varsity footballers who dominated all competition
in the independent leagues.

From the upper ﬂoors of the Cathedral, Heinz Chapel appeared tranquil amidst the

snow-covered campus buildings.

VVith the passing of nineteen ﬁfty-ﬁve into history,
the new year brought with it one of the semester’s
largest snow falls. The temperatures that had
stayed above thirty degrees during most of the
old year soon dropped to eight or nine degrees.

Colds and coughs began to plague the students.
Many of the people began to walk around the
campus with shiny red noses betraying signs that
one of the ﬂu “bugs” had bitten them.

But the snow and cold weather were sources of
fun to many of the students. Unlike many others
who stayed indoors, some students had snowball
battles, took walks around the campus, or just
went out to enjoy a few minutes of the brisk air.

Finally, the semester came to an end. For many,
the end of the semester was a happy time; for
others, it meant exams and study.

This was the last chance for some people to
ﬁnish long ignored term papers and book reports.
Semester fun was over; it was time for sitting
down and looking over a semester’s work. For
those who had not kept up with their work, it
meant going through all their books and learning;
for those who had taken comprehensive notes and
attended all classes, it was merely a matter of re-
viewing the material.

The libraries were ﬁlled with students attempt-
ing to cram as much knowledge as possible before
their exams. The fraternity and sorority houses
were quiet. The usually noisy Tuck Shop and
cafeteria lost their loud and laughing voices as the
people began to study while they ate.

Although most of the students looked upon the
professors and instructors as tyrants, the faculty
Students congregated in the libraries to study. had their Share of troubles’ too' They had to
correct the papers and make certain that deserved
grades were registered.

 

Some had to catch up on their required
readings.

   

Others were able to concentrate in the

Tuck Shop.
Lecture notes were scanned.

The library tables were covered with notebooks, texts, and papers.

 

Even the stairways were quiet enough
for studying.

       In the very beginning, when Pittsburgh was only a cluster of cabins at the
Point, two dreams stirred its soul-a splendid, surging materialism, and a yearning
for cultural growth. That these two have achieved a happy symbiosis is brilliantly
expressed today in the Cathedral of Learning.
       * It could have been a temptation, in this town of teeming potentialities,
to concentrate solely on the practical. Wealth always burgeoned here-in farm
products, coal, iron, glass, oil, and steel. Any man with horse-sense and a right
good will to work, could wrest a fortune from the wilderness, seemingly overnight.
       * This city was singularly blessed though, by the quality of the people who
came here in search of a fuller life. They recognized early a need for the specialized
type of training our industries would require. But they wished, for their sons and
daughters, much more than this. With William Penn they believed that "good
and commendable learning is to be preferred before wealth."
       * A succession of such great men-founders, trustees, chancellors, teachers,
and alumni-have steered our university's destiny from the log cabin Academy
of 1787 to the Cathedral of today. Under their vigil has grown up a special type of
university that marries, in its wide curriculum, both the cultural and the practical.
The Cathedral of Learning, itself a uniquely American architectural expression,
is a symbol of a uniquely American type of education.
       * Also uniquely American was the early development of the food manufacturing business. For more than three generations we have been preparing
ready-to-serve delicacies to save the time and effort of America's housewives.

HARBISON-WALKER REFRACTORIES
        keep pace with the atomic age
Refractories are needed for building the many
widely diversified types of furnaces used for
making steel, aluminum, copper, and other
metals, cement, glass, steam-generated power
and substantially all products vital to our
modern civilization and our national economy.
  The high temperatures and other severe
operating conditions which refractories must
withstand in service differ greatly among the
various industrial processes. Through research
and extensive application experience, HarbisonWalker has developed the kinds of refractories
best suited for each specific requirement. From
a mere dozen kinds of refractories made available to industry a half century ago, HarbisonWalker now produces more than four score
commercial types and classes. The proper
selection of these refractories for every particular application assures longest service life
and greatest operating economy.

The rushee had luncheon dates . . .

The new semester began with new classes, new books, new
activities, and, for the girls, the opportunity to join soror-
ities. At Pitt, a freshman girl may not be pledged until
after her ﬁrst semester. This gives the prospective rushees
and the sororities a chance to meet each other through
informal luncheon-dates.

As February with its formal rushing period began, the
rushees were deluged with offers of luncheon-dates and
prospects of coming sorority parties. The groups sent in-
vitations to the girls that they had met and were consider-
ing for membership. During this period, the element of
surprise and suspense was great. The rushee waited for her
invitations and the groups waited to see which rushees
would attend their parties.

When the invitations were accepted, the ﬁrst round of
parties began. On Saturday of rushing week, the sororities
prepared their bids and formal rush ended. On the follow-
ing Monday, the former luncheon-dates picked up their
bids and became pledges.

Finally, Jackie Rice became a pledge.

. . . She attended parties . . .

 

. . . And met the members.

She waited in line to pick up her bid.

                                       THANKS...
                                       As a lump of clay is molded into a statue or a tiny figurine, an idea or theme is molded
                                       and formed into a yearbook. But it is not the work of one man; it is the combination of
                                       the entire staff. The members of my staff have put in long hours on the book. From them
 Leo Zelkowitz       Betty Ann Young    I have received more than just the work that I assigned them. The deadlines would have
                                        been much longer and harder if it were not for their friendship and cheer. All I can say is
                                        thanks... thanks a lot.
                                          Selling a yearbook to a student that is constantly handing out money for tuition, books
                                       and school supplies is a tough job. Added to this problem is the factor that the book must
                                       not lose money. Leo scraped and financed until toward the last deadline, when the
                                       book's budget began to balance. With Gene and Neal as his assistants, the book was a
                                       financial success. Betty Ann, my girl Friday, was constantly around the office seeing
                                       that the other staff members were cleaning up their assignments. She was a good worker,
                                       a classmate, and a buddy. Don spent many hours writing, correcting, and making sure
 Gene Reinhold         Neal Zweig      that the copy was the best in any yearbook. Tom, without a doubt, was a most efficient
                                       and exacting photographer.
                                          Louise effectively handled the honoraries besides making me chuckle a bit with some
                                       of her questions. When Eleanor sat down and finished her section, she did a fine job.
                                       Mazie came through with a wonderful job handling and helping with three sections.
                                       Marilyn, also a triple section editor and worker, did a very good job. Helen ended up with
                                       many sore fingers from the amount of copy that she had to type. Judy floundered and
                                       fought her way through an entire index of names; a good job for a first year member.
                                       Betty, at times, worried me about meeting her deadline, but she met her deadline in her
           Don Miller  Tom Vrana       usual good fashion, and kept me in a jovial mood. Lois handled the religious section with
                                       charm and came through with a good piece of work. Bob took a lot of good pictures that
                                       are a credit to the pages. Circulation and publicity fell on the able shoulders of Howie.
                                       Though she ended with glue on her fingers, Lucille did a great job on the classes section.
                                         I must also thank and recognize the wonderful help that I received from some of the
                                       faculty and Administration: Dean T. W. Biddle, Mrs. Starrett, Mr. Prey, and all my
                                       teachers that had to put up with a busy student.
                                         To Buffalo, N, Y., I would like to send my thanks for the wonderful and careful help
                                       that the staff of Wm. J. Keller Inc. gave me. People like Don Messinger, Mrs. Jewell
                                       Gates, and Blair Schrecongost are wonderful people to work with and wonderful public
                                       relations for their company.
                                         The S. K. Smith Co., of Cleveland, did a very beautiful job creating our covers. I
                                       would like to thank Ralph Benz for his many suggestions and information on the design
                                       of this book cover.
                                         Next to the Owl office is another office that has the words DIRECTOR OF STUDENT
                                       PUBLICATIONS on the glass doors. In that office paces not only my adviser but also a
                                       man whom I consider a personal friend, Dr. Donald E. Swarts. I would like to thank D. E.
                                       for our very fine association.
M~azie Hoffman       Marilyn Rubin       My parents saw very little of their son this year, in fact, only sometimes at breakfast
                                       and on weekends. Through the entire year, they never complained about the way I some                                       times had to ignore my home life. I am particularly grateful for the constant encourage                                       ment which they gave me throughout the year. I must also thank Jeannine for not com                                       plaining when I had a date with the Owl instead of with her.
                                         I could go on for pages, thanking people for the help thaft they have given me this year.
                                       To those that I have not named-I would not forget any of you-but I can only say
                                       thanks.
                                         And so ends the first fifty years of the Owl. I would like to thank the Almighty for
Helen Tishon        Judy Kirkpatrick   having given me this privilege of being the anniversary editor. I pray that He will watch
                                       the Owl and make it increasingly better as Pitt enters the next fifty years.

Tl1c Glee Club sang selections at the reception for the new chancellor.

Pitt’s future was publicly charted on February 29, when
Chancellor Edward H. Litchﬁeld made his ﬁrst appearance
before the alumni and faculty, speaking to the Century
Club at the Hotel Webster Hall. His message was televised
over ‘VQED.

The gist of the carefully delivered speech was that: “It
is high time that this country had another great University
to compete with those which have so long dominated our
thinking.”

The Chancellor was convinced that such could be ac-
complished at Pitt. He stated, “We must begin to put
ﬂesh on this idea of distinctive structure by drawing stu-
dents and ﬁnances from all parts of the world and by in-
creasing emphasis 011 the quality of the University.”

Concluding on a high note, Dr. Litchﬁeld added, “In
any event, I can promise you a thrilling time in what can
be one of the greatest experiments in higher education in
this century.”

“It is high time . . .

THE END...
And so ends the first fifty years of the Owl. But in reality
it is just the beginning of a new era. The Owl has seen
three chancellors in office and has tried to capture the
brilliance of their accomplishments within its pages. The
book has grown and thrived with the "skyscraper" University.
  This year, the Owl has only caught a glimpse of the new
chancellor and his program. In years to come, the Owl will
show the results of the dynamic leadership of Chancellor
Litchfield. We know that our alma mater will flourish
during his administration. We the seniors of the Owl staff
express the thoughts of the entire senior class in wishing
the Chancellor every success during his years of service to
the University.

“Education for Living” was discussed and . . .

. . Chaplain Luccock listened intently to . . .

. . . Dr. Edwin P. Booth.

Some 44 speakers, including 10 out-of-town theolo-
gians, inﬂuenced the Whole campus in early l\Iarch.

This year Religion-in-Life VVeel< got OH’ to an
interesting start when the University family met
for the annual convocation in the Commons Room.

Dr. Edwin P. Booth, from Boston University.
was the main speaker; the preceding night he
delivered a lecture to the Pitcairn-Crabbe Foun-
dation o11 “i\“[oral Values and the Study of Bi-
ogra phy. ’ ’

At the convocation he was introduced by Dr. C.
Stanton Crawford, dean of the College, and spoke
o11 “Yours—An Education for Living.”

Greatly enlarged this year, the Religion-in-Life
Coinniittee scheduled 25 events which were open
to everyone interested. l\Ieetings with such topics
as “Does the Educated Person Need Religion?”
and “Ideas in Drama,” staged by speech students,
found ready and enthusiastic support.

Dr. DeVitis spoke with a more intimate group.

The plaque dedicating the Cathedral to Dr. Bowman was unveiled.

 

Dr. Bowman expressed his gratitude for the honor . . .

. . . And the audience expressed its appreciation for his guidance.

 

This year, thirty years after the groundbreaking, the
Cathedral of Learning of the University of Pittsburgh
was dedicated to the abilities and genius of the building’s
originator, President Honorarius John G. Bowman.

The informal ceremonies were held in the Commons
Room in early l\Iarch: members of the Board of Trustees
paid homage to Dr. Bowman when they unveiled a plaque
which had been built into the wall near the Fifth Avenue
ﬁreplace. The tablet expresses the hope that the Cathedral
of Learning may stand for centuries and be a sign of faith
to youth.

Following the presentation, a banquet was held in‘ the
English Room where Chancellor Edward H. Litchﬁeld
spoke before the ofﬁcials and their guests.

Dr. Bowman first conceived the idea of a skyscraper
university in a metropolitan environment and saw the ﬁrst
students move into the building in 1937.

The “grand old man” of Pitt listens to the tributes being paid him.

 

 

St. Patrick came rolling down the avenue . . .

. . . And was greeted by General Ridgeway, Dean Fitterer,
and City Solicitor McKeena.

 

St. Patrick threw Shamrocks and the students fought to catch them.

36

The l\Iarch winds roared, but the engineering students
roared louder as they began their celebration of Engineers’
Week, hlarch 12-16. The “boys from upon the hill” rolled
down to the Cathedral for the appearance of their patron,
St. Patrick.

Three years ago, the engineering students named St. Pat
as their patron because When he drove the snakes out of
Ireland, he became an engineer by inventing the ﬁrst
“worm drive.” This year St. Pat arrived in a tank and was
greeted by the students with cheers, shouts, and display
signs of their departments. General l\Iatthew Ridgway,
Dean F itterer, and city solicitor l\IcKenna were waiting
to greet him as he stepped from his vehicle.

St. Patrick had gifts of shillelaghs, shamrocks, and
property in Ireland for the three dignitaries. The day was
ﬁlled with much laughter but with the best laugh going to
General RidgWay—he turned the tables and gave St.
Patrick a shillelagh.

It was a great day for the Irish and the engineer.

ACTING CHANCELLOR NUTTING

44

 

Acting Chancellor Charles B. Nutting is a
graduate of the State University of Iowa.
After taking advanced degrees at Iowa and
Harvard, he was admitted to the Iowa and
Kansas bars in 1930. He has worked on the
Supreme Court, has been in private practice,
law professor at Texas and Nebraska Uni-
versities, and solicitor for the U. S. Depart-
ment of Agriculture.

At Pitt since 1942, as professor and vice-
dean of law, then as dean of law, Dr. Nutting
has been vice-chancellor since 1952.

Member of the Pennsylvania and Alle-
gheny Bar Associations, American Bar As-
sociation and president of the Association of
American Law Schools, Dr. Nutting has
during his years of administration continued
to teach law courses.

After thirteen years Dr. Nutting leaves
Pitt this July to assume Directorship of the
Buhl Foundation. He will be missed by
many.

A MESSAGE FROM THE
CHANCELLORS OFFICE

Those who manage and work in universities sometimes forget Why
they are there. A university does not exist for the sake of its size
or its wealth or its buildings. It exists for its students. Physical
surroundings are important only to the extent that they contribute
to an environment in which young men and women, together with
those who teach, can develop the best that is in them. Buildings
may be the bones of an institution, but people give it life and color
and meaning.

Thus, to be great, a university must be human. It must have
concern not only for things, but also for mind and heart and spirit.
It must preserve the lessons of the past and make them relevant
to the present. It must look to the future without fear. It must
stand staunchly for integrity. In a world too often preoccupied
with transient and trivial affairs it must concern itself with eternal
truth.

These things can be accomplished only if students and faculty
believe in them; only in an atmosphere of sympathy and under-
standing.

In my years at Pitt I have sensed this belief. I have felt this
atmosphere. As the University moves on into a new era may it
continue to stand for things that count. l\Iay the students who
leave its walls carry with them the lasting virtues that will make
their lives worth while.

VICE CHANCELLOR MOORE

Entering his third year at Pitt, Vice Chancellor of public health
professions, Dr. Robert A. l\’Ioore is at home with his multiple
duties at his Falk Clinic office.

The former pathology professor and dean of medicine at VVash-
ington University, St. Louis, is also awaiting the third edition of
his 425,000 word pathology textbook to be published this summer.
Attempting to keep up with developments, he subscribes to thirty-
ﬁve medical journals.

Born in Chicago and an Ohio State University graduate, he took
his Ph.D. at \Vestern Reserve University shortly after his degree
in medicine.

He does not feel too many students apply for Pitt medical
school since approximately one out of two is placed.

A world traveler, he toured Europe with his family last summer.

PRESIDENT HONORARIUS BOWMAN

One of the most forceful men in the history of the University of
Pittsburgh is President IIonorarius John G. Bowmanithe man
who as chancellor from 1991 to 1945 conceived the idea and erected
the Cathedral of Learning.

Dr. Bowman’s list of positions and accomplishments is legion:
chancellor of two universities, trustee consultant on hospital
boards, trustee of the Frick Educational Commission, vice—chair-
man of the board of l\Iellon Institute, as well as the recipient of
many honors from here and abroad. He has also written many
books, among them The I/Vorld That Was‘.

At present Dr. Bowman lives in retirement at Bedford, Pa.,
spending his time writing and working at his hobby of ceramics—
among the memories of a fascinating career.

CHANCELLOR EMERITUS FITZGERALD

Chancellor of the University of Pittsburgh for ten years Dr.
Rufus H. Fitzgerald, presently Chancellor Emeritus, led Pitt
through its early age of expansion in the Oakland district.

Renounced for his managerial abilities at the State University
of Iowa, Dr. Fitzgerald came to Pitt in 1938 at the behest of Dr.
Bowman, then chancellor.

Assuming the role of chancellor i11 1946, Dr. Fitzgerald initiated
many far-reaching advances for the University. Since his retire-
ment, he has continued his intense and vital interest in the edu-
cational system in the United States by heading the Executive
Committee for Exchange Students, a post he took on in his last
year at Pitt at the wish of the President of the United States. His
life at present is divided between his home in Pittsburgh and his
duties in VVashington, D. C.

REGISTRAR QUICK

Dr. J. G. Quick, registrar of the University, has been serving in
Pitt’s extension division and as secretary of school relations since
he got his diploma at Pitt in 1913.

He was appointed to the position of registrar three years later.

A resident of Edgewood most of his life, Dr. Quick is a member
of the local school board, a trustee of his church, and treasurer of
its building fund. At Pitt he is on the athletic committee, foreign
student committee, and the deans’ council; he also heads the
faculty Community Chest drive.

One of his favorite jobs is bestowing honor scholarships to high
school students. Along with this, he likes to show some 16,349
slides which he calls the “University of Pittsburgh Scene.”

DEAN JONES

Dr. Putnam F. Jones was born in Amsterdam, New York, and
earned his degrees at Cornell University. He became assistant
professor of English at Pitt in 1927. He has been a full professor
since 1946, and was head of the English Department until he
assumed his duties as associate dean of the College, as well as
acting dean of the Graduate School.

In this complicated world, Dr. Jones believes that students
should develop their potential as human beings; technical and
earning skills stem directly from that.

As one of the founders of Pitt’s Core Curriculum program, Dr.
Jones ﬁnds that students are not as well prepared in math and
English as they should be. He also thinks literature is necessary
for the fuller enjoyment of life. Besides reading, Dr. Jones ﬁnds
relaxation ﬁshing off Bass Island near Sandusky, Ohio.

DEAN RUSH

Pitt’s Dean of Women, Miss Helen P. Rush states: “Pitt women
are more independent than formerly, and awareness is a good
thing. It used to be that it was considered a virtue to be unaware
of the world—at least women were expected to be. That is not
true any longer. The story today is interaction and change. And
I’m all for it.”

Along with woman’s changing outlook has been the growth of
the women’s program at Pitt under Dean Rush’s leadership. She
feels that the emphasis in a woman’s college education should be
placed on meaningfulness and a good philosophy to live by. This

" may be accomplished by supporting and strengthening the intel-

lectual standard of achievement.

Like Dean Biddle, Dean Rush became dean in 1942, having
graduated from Pitt and spent her “apprenticeship” on the former
dean of women’s staff.

DEAN BIDDLE

Theodore VV. Biddle, dean of men at the University of Pittsburgh,
has been interested in the affairs of Pitt students through the dean
of men’s staff since he graduated from Pitt in 1929.

From that time till 1941 he was assistant to the dean of men;
Mr. Biddle has been full dean since June of 194Q—he has spent
over 25 years with the men’s program at Pitt.

In that time he has gained much knowledge about just how the
college mind works, be it in high-minded pursuits such as Tap
Day, or the confusion of a student raid on another college campus.
He feels students are better today than when he graduated. This
is because Pitt is admitting better students: freshmen are better
trained and more reasonable than those of the Twenties. A sign
of their maturity is the growth of student marriages, almost un-
heard of then.

CHAPLAIN LUCCOCK

Chaplain Emory VV. Luccock was born in Bloomington, Indiana,
and received his A.B. at Wabash College in 1916, his D.D. in 1932,
after attending various seminaries. Ordained a Presbyterian min-
ister in 1921, Dr. Luccock was director of a community center in
Siangtan, China from 1929 to 1925, and the American community
church in Shanghai until 1938. Back in the U. S. he served in many
churches throughout the Midwest, coming to Pitt in 1953.

He is amazed at the cooperation he has received as ﬁrst full-
time chaplain from the student and faculty.

After building the loan library in his office with “the best books
I can ﬁnd on religion and education for college students,” and
maintaining his friendship with students, the Chaplain feels he is
ﬁnding out how to do his job better.

OWL HALL OF FAME

After a period of four years, the student who has taken an
active interest in his University has found that student
life is more than a combination of books, studies, and
buildings. The senior who channelled his energy into the
different aspects of campus activities has discovered the
values to be attained through learning how to enjoy, help,
and work with other people.

The Owl Hall of Fame Committee, composed of six
junior men and six junior women, had watched the seniors
in their activities. From their observations, the juniors
selected those seniors whom they felt to have left a lasting
impression in the minds of the student body. The Owl
accepts and honors the committee’s selections. On these
pages, the Owl presents the outstanding seniors in its Hall
of Fame.

MR. PITT

Nicola Sirianni

Each year, the Owl selects a man and a woman from the
graduating class as Mr. and Miss Pitt. These two students
typify the ideals that a student may develop who ﬁnds a
keen interest in working for and with his school and fellow
classmates.

Four years have ended. Four years in which time we
seniors have learned much about different subjects, various
activities, and the signiﬁcance of true friendship. During
this time the University has not only given us an academic
education but a social education as well.

To be a part of Pitt is a challenge to every student.
l\Iany students seldom ﬁnd an opportunity to become an
integral part of campus life because of studies, outside

work, and other complications. But those who do grasp
the opportunity soon ﬁnd that Pitt has more to offer them
than academic attainment.

In years to come, We may lose contact with the Uni-
versity and with the friends We have made, but we could
never forget the great amount of pleasure that both have
given us.

Of those among us, the Owl has singled out Nicola
Sirianni and Beatrice Pellegrino, who through their abili-
ties, interests, and development have shown themselves
Worthy of the titles Mr. and l\Iiss Pitt. They exemplify
What We believe Pitt has attempted to generate in us-
personality, leadership, and humanity.

I
OMICRON DELTA KAPPA
AWARDEE

For his outstanding abilities and leadership in extracurricular
activities one senior man is chosen by Gamma Circle of Omicron
Delta Kappa for its prized award, Pitt’s ODK [Warn of the Year.

His being chosen as the senior student “who best represents the
type of individual the University aims to produce” was the result
of careful selection from the most outstanding senior men at Pitt.

After each candidate’s popularity had been determined by the
number of votes he had received, this information was added to
his qualiﬁcations of leadership in activities, his scholarship, his
character, and his service to the University.

This year the Senior Award Committee, composed of Dean
T. VV. Biddle, E. A. Batchelder, Col. VV. D. Eister, Dr. R. C. Gor-
ham, and iVIr. Robert Dickinson, 1955 ODK Awardee, chose for
the honorary award Donald Gartner, whose name, engraved in
ODK VValk, will serve as stimulus to his successors.

54

 

“S” AWARDEE

Pitt’s “S” Award for “seeing, studying, speaking abroad” was
given this year to Robert l\IcCabe, a junior in the College.

This is the third year that the award has been given; last year’s
awardee was Donald Gartner, who spent his summer in Southern
Germany in the home of a Stuttgart family.

Robert, who is an English major, plans to do most of his travel-
ing in England with sidetrips to the many historic literary spots
throughout the British Isles. After he has completed his studies at
Oxford, he plans on venturing to Paris and then to Rome.

The “S” Award, open to any male junior in the University, is
provided for from contributions of Pitt’s fraternities, working hand
in hand with the Dean of l\Ien’s office. It is officially sponsored by
Interfraternity Council. The awardee is expected to Write and talk
of his experiences during his last year on campus.

55

NATIONALITY ROOMS
AWARDEES

Two Nationality Rooms hostesses, Suzanne Roche, Education ’57,
and Carolyn Loefﬂer, College ’57, were awarded this year’s annual
scholarships for study in Europe.

l\*Iiss Loefﬂer is an English major interested in creative writing.
In her application for the award, she indicated a desire to go to
Italy because “there is such a concentration of all that is ancient
and beautiful in that country.”

l\Iiss Roche said that through hostessing in the Nationality
Rooms she has become aware of “the great contributions to society
made by each country in the world,” and that by hostessing in
Heinz Chapel she has experienced the “lovely calmness enveloped
in the bright colors created by Charles Connick.”

The winners, not -previously made known until Tap Day, were
selected and announced early this year in order to give the women
a better opportunity to prepare for their departures in early June.

DEAN CRAWFORD

Students’ awareness of their responsibilities has never

Dean of the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences. “They
have advanced according with the philosophies of this age
which has a totally different emphasis since I graduated
from Bethany College,” he states.

“l\Iore and more students are turning to business rather
than to the professions as they did in the past. Business,
too, is moving toward reviewing and accepting the values
gained by a student who has a ﬁrm background in the
humanities.”

Born in Steubenville, Ohio, Dr. Crawford, professor of
zoology at Lynchburgh College in Virginia, and at Pitt
for fourteen years, became head of the Johnstown Center
in 1927. He has been dean of the College since 1935.

Dean Crawford this year was elected to the new position
of Dean of Faculties under Dr. Litchﬁeld.

DEAN EITTERER

Ever since Dr. G. Raymond F itterer graduated as a chem-
ical engineer from Rose Polytechnic in 1924, he has pur-
sued a busy life in administrative and technical ﬁelds. He
became research fellow at Carnegie Tech, working after-
wards at the U. S. Bureau of Mines as head of the metal-
lography department. From 1933 to 1938 he headed his
F itterer Pyrometric Co. which he has since sold.

By 1951 he was dean of Pitt’s Schools of Engineering
and Mines, was a U. S. delegate to the U. N. Economics
Commission for Latin America in Bogota, as well as being
supervisor to many research boards during and since the
war.

Dr. Fitterer states that out of 1,000 applicants to
Schools of Engineering and Mines this past year, only 450
students were accepted because of incapacity. Three hun-
dred were turned away who could qualify eventually for
one of the School’s ten degrees.

He has two artistic hobbies: painting and the organ.

DEAN MASONER

Dr. Paul H. l\'Iasoner, dean of the School of Education,
is vitally interested in the problem of recruiting more
teachers for Pittsburgh schools. He has made a careful
study of the community on this question and stands be-
hind high school F.T.A. groups to stimulate students into
wanting teaching for a career. He also makes many
speeches to various community groups per year on edu-
cation needs.

Dr. Masoner does not think the answer is to shorten the
study period of teachers to less than four years; to him
that is a sure way of lowering teaching prestige.

He sees “no daylight yet” in the problem of inﬂuencing
more students to teach, but he states, “there is more and
more interest. Community respect is as important to a
teacher as salary.” A teacher’s greatest returns, he feels,
will always be fun and satisfaction in the work of inﬂuenc—
ing young minds.

Dean Masoner’s residence is in Bellevue, Pa., where
he taught and administered in its schools for many years
before coming to the University.

DEAN LAN FEAR

Graduate of the University of Texas with Ph.D. from
Columbia is Dr. Vincent IV. Lanfear, Dean of the School
of Business Administration.

His feeling is that students today are promised too
much, giving them a “VVhat’s in it for me?” outlook in
and after college. VVhen he entered college he considered
it the “Promised Land.” “There were far less opportunities
for advancement in those days,” the Dean affirms.

He advises, “Your personality is the key to most doors.
You’re always writing your own recommendation by your
appearance . . . it’s your psychic income.”

His greatest thrill as a teacher is watching a poor stu-
dent develop. Texas born and Dean of :\Ien from 1934 to
1941, he also enjoys watching things grow—students most
of all.

Dean Lanfear accounts it one of the greatest thrills of
his profession that he has been able to keep in contact
with many business graduates.

DEAN SWANSON

Dean of the School of Dentistry, Dr. Wlilliam F. Swanson
states that one—half of graduate dentists go into armed
service, the rest go into practice and advanced work in
oral surgery. Dean Swanson adds that dentists rank third
nationally as salaried professionals.

Nevertheless there is no overcrowding, but the demand
for dentists is in smaller towns with 6,800 populations.

Pitt Dental School’s incoming student quota is 96 stu-
dents per year.

Dean Swanson is a professor of histology and bacteri-
ology. Born at Arroya, Pennsylvania, he earned his B.S.
at Pennsylvania State University in 1915, his D.D.S. at
Pitt in 1920, and l\I.S. in 1930. He taught bacteriology
here till 1947, when he became associate dean. At present
he is concluding his doctorate dissertation on tooth re-
generation.

As a happy pastime, Dr. Swanson enjoys the out-of-
doors and especially the angler’s art.
