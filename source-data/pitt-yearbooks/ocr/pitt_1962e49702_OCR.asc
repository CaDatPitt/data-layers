PHI GAMMA DELTA

In front of the Fiji house a Renault is parked on the
sidewalk side of the big tree. It’s a trial to get it off
the sidewalk. Many of the brothers have been getting
married. The extra money from the renting of the in-
famous third ﬂoor is welcome to the treasury. There
was a new “brother” at the house: a black kitten
caused problems. He sleeps on Swick’s pool table,
walks on the piano keys, and curls on the steps in
the middle of the dinner rush. For fun there’s Fiji
week-end . . . Chapis and “Champ” . . . Son of a

PI KAPPA ALPHA

It’s been another lucky year for the PiKA’s. Bru-
tus’ arm didn’t fall off until the judges had turned
their backs. Brac picked it up before the show was
over, but as far as the judges were concerned,
Brutus and Brac did well enough to win a third
place trophy.

All went well at the house. It took a lot of cooking
to satisfy the appetites of the animals on the third
ﬂoor. “Rock and Roll” Marie fed them tasty meals
with a minimum of worms in the soup.

Dart game made Nu a big hit. Punching—door con-
tests were lots of fun. BYO parties! Rege played
the genial host as Buddy did the Pony and Russ
played the guitar. It’s too bad Jag and the Darling
never got to see the entertainment. They preferred
the Pi room. Through it all they were brothers.
Who but a brother would walk the ﬂoor all night
with Bob before his date with Emily?

Pl LAMBDA PHI

Pi Lam determination never dies. Though they were un-
successful in their attempt this year to string a “Pep” ban-
ner from one end-zone to the next, they are already work-
ing on plans to paper the entire stadium with Pi Lam
posters. Under the inspiration of Marty, a man who is de-
Voting his career to promoting spirit at Pitt, came such up-
and-comers as Larry Sherman who is always searching for
new places to ﬁnd spirits.

At Winter Week End, Warren miraculously rescued Len-
ny on the ski slopes to the disappointment of all who were
thinking of sending Lenny to the Olympics. Winter Week
End deﬁnitely took the prize for the greatest affair of the
social season, but the most exciting event of the year for
the brothers was Greek Sing. The honor of it all seems to
have gone to their heads. Coming from 25th to 3rd place
in Greek Sing is certainly an accomplishment. But it was
carrying things too far when they tried to stage grand op-
era in the Tuck Shop.

SIGMA CHI

“Excellent,” proclaimed Pappy Young, “are the
twenty men who chose Sig this fall.” Pledge Patrick
jolted the actives with his kidnap plan. When it back-
ﬁred, the Ferdinand twins, Ed and Ed, asked, “Will
he ever return?”

At Homecoming, Pogo ﬁlled the front porch and
Thetas ﬁlled the house. Loyal Sigs sang, “Place her
in a corner and hold her hand like this.” Four Thetas,
three T ri Delts, and one Kappa lifted their white
crosses.

The Sigs marched on West Virginia. “Watch those
hubcaps, Dale!” W.V. was deﬁnitely a wet safari,
but B00 was too snowed to care. The Sigs were really
swingin’ out—except for Blanchard who was still
working on his Black and White from the Navy
game.

THETA CHI

The year was marked by competition between the
brothers this year at the Theta Chi House. Bets were
split for the wrestling play—offs with half the guys
betting on Prado and the others putting their money
on Wrigley. There seemed to be some quiet between
Jay and Pat. An amicable switch was worked out to
the satisfaction of all concerned. The ﬁeld was clear
in the Phi Bet competition—John had it all the way.

Parties were many, varied, and fun. The big “Twist”
party swung for everybody but Grimes. He’s still hav-
ing his back treated. The “Hayride Party” was great
even if it did take a little eﬂort to get all that hay out
of the basement. But the prize for the most hectic
party of the year goes to the swinger with the Im-
perials. The noise was a bit nerve—racking. Dale, es-
pecially upset, put his ﬁst through the wall.

Remember Hughie’s frogman outﬁt, Spring Week End
at Conneaut, Homecoming at Web. Hall and the U.S.C.
football team, and the celebrations at the Luna?

ZETA BETA TAU

Not every fraternity can claim to have the ugliest
man on campus in their group. ZBT, newly organ-
ized on campus, boasts this distinction. It took the
make—up artistry and collection ability of all the

’ brothers and a little of Jay’s own talents, but the ZBT
Ugly Man won by a landslide. People all over down-
town Pittsburgh were startled into contributing to
Children’s Hospital and J ay’s victory.

Back at the House, things were as swinging as when
ZBT was Kappa Nu. There was the gung-ho circle
. . . Triple Alliance Club . . . Jay and Ollie’s room

. . tossing Howie round and round . . . live chicks
for “live chicks” . . . two weeks of 24 hour West Side
Story . . . Snagglepuss, the lion even . . . New York-

LAMBDA CHI

It was a good year for nicknames at the
Lambda Chi house. There was the Amer-
ican Moose . . . Matzoh . . . The Mole
Man . . . Social Climber . . . Corvair Cur-
ry . . . The Communist . . . The Missing
Link . . . The Mongolian Animals . . .
Phantom. The Lambda Chi’s received
honors, too. Semple was Bandsmah of the
year, Moose was football manager, Ar-
cara—Ed’s cousin——was treasurer of
Men’s Council, Chris Sweer was Phi Eta
Sigma and Alpha Phi Omega, and the
chapter won the fraternity football tro-
phy. The parties also turned out pretty
well. The Communist Party had too many
Khrushchevs, but Tkach was a success as
Mao. The Heidelberg Party washed ev-
eryone down the drain, and nights at the
Luna and the Thompson Club proved to
be beneﬁcial.

SIGMA ALPHA MU

It took a zoo to do it, but the Sammys
won the Pep Trophy this year. Starting
off mildly, they brought a goat to the Pitt-
Navy Game. The following week they
brought Jackson, a live golden panther,
to the Notre Dame Game. As the Notre
Dame band marched onto the ﬁeld, the
jungle came back to Jackson; he and the
Sammys spent the second half locked in
the back seat of a police car. At Home-
coming, pledges smuggled 25 homing pi-
geons under their coats past the guards at
the stadium. When Pitt scored its game-
winning touchdown, they released the pi-
geons above the crowd.

PANHELLENIC
COUNCIL

“Take it back to your sorority and ﬁnd out what the
rest of the girls think” was Emilee’s favorite expres-
sion this year. Opinions brought to the Monday aft-
ernoon meetings by representatives of all the soror-
ities on campus have been important in deciding
Panhellenic policy on campus.

_’_,,...w-as-1*--{I6 ‘‘-'--&'-‘v -r«‘‘'‘'''-»-._____, Q

Open meetings led by Emilee made every sorority \
woman aware of the importance of Panhellenic. ; .
Seated on folding chairs in the large unﬁnished room

on the 12th ﬂoor, sorority girls enthusiastically dis-
cussed the problems that concerned their suite and house
rules, rush, and the quota system.

Raising the quota from thirty members to thirty-
ﬁve was the subject of the longest discussions within
each sorority and at Panhellenic meetings. The com-
promise ﬁnally reached proved the importance of
Panhellenic as a source of inter-sorority harmony.

Domesticity reigns supreme at the Beta Sigma
Omicron apartment. Whether pitching in to help
with dusting and scrubbing the apartment or cook-
ing dinner, working together has made them a
close group. Taking turns each week, two of the
girls cook dinner for the others. When the word
gets out that Dottie and Dec are cooking, crowds
gather. Those kids have a real talent for water-

ing the food to feed any number and it still tastes
great. ‘

Some of the other sisters have a little more trouble
getting dinner prepared. It’s not the cooking that’s
so tough, it’s ﬁnding a level table to put the food ‘_ '
on. Spaghetti sure is slippery. '

PHI SIGMA SIGMA

A Care package from a father contained an un-
expected surprise for the Phi Sigs—a two—foot
baby alligator. They gave him a home in their
bathtub. When the ungrateful ’gator bit the hand
of a Phi Sig who was feeding him, an emergency
meeting was called to discuss ﬁnding new housing
for the animal. After a very brief discussion, he
was packed up and mailed back to Florida.

“Borrowed” trophies and signs from other sorori-
ties and fraternities decorated the Phi Sig suite. It’s
a bit difficult to explain how they won the 1960
Inter-Fraternity football trophy.

At rush the Phi Sigs were full of good intentions.
But there was a small mistake with the refresh-
ments. The sisters didn’t mind drinking the ice
cream that someone had forgotten to put in the
freezer—it meant fewer spoons to wash.

Doing the unusual was rather commonplace for the

Following the great booth switch in the Tuck Shop
the Theta Phi’s continued with a smashing year.
Jan was University Scholar and sister Linda was
president of Alpha Psi Omega. Willy went against
a cardinal suite rule and tried to go to bed before

Phi Kap trophies to the girls for “safekeeping.”
It’s about Gerri———-she hasn’t quite learned what

honoraries

Being tapped to an honorary or-
ganization is supposed to mean
more to the individual student
than an “extra pin to polish.”
The long yellow ribbon worn on
Tap Day indicates outstanding
accomplishment on the part of
the tappee.

The accomplishment may be ac-
ademic, an outstanding QPA
honored. Or the yellow ribbon
and little pin may honor a tal-
ent: the special ability to con-
tribute to a publication, to a
theatrical group, or a musical or—
ganization. Some few organiza-
tions honor only those men and
women proficient in all areas.
High QPA’s must be combined
with special abilities plus campus
leadership.

Sometimes the glory and excite-
ment of being chosen for an hon-
orary organization all but ob-
scures how much is yet to be
accomplished.

With freshmen getting smarter and
upperclassmen getting tireder, there was
some question about who was being oriented.
U pperclass women in trench coats and
open—toe sneakers felt frumpy in the presence
of freshman wardrobes and made promises
to themselves to shape up just as soon as
everything was organized for Kiski Day, the
first Mentor meetings, and the Freshman
Mixer. U pperclass men led herds of
freshmen through the hills of the campus,
taught them songs and cheers, and shouted
at them in meetings. In the dorms, senior
assistants and counsellors wondered if they
had ever had energy enough to make that
much noise.

MORTAR
BOARD

Led by President Ina Amdur,
the discussions at Mortar Board
meetings made membership in
that organization a worthwhile
intellectual experience.

The Senior women who were
tapped to this group found time
in their schedules of school work
and activities to read the books
and articles on the reading lists,
to think seriously about them,
and to present their considered
opinions to other members of
Mortar Board.

Often, women students from the
sophomore and junior classes
were invited to join the senior
members in the discussions. Re-
spect and an appreciation of the
intellectual abilities of these
younger women was the result.

But Mortar Board is more than
just a discussion group. To be
privileged to wear the gold and
black pin, shaped like a tiny
mortar board, indicates out-
standing achievement on the
campus and high intellectual
ability.

OMICRON DELTASKAPPA

The ﬁrst and third Friday of each month ODK members would await the
“pong, pong, pong” of Ed Kondis’ tapping his knife against his water glass
to call another luncheon—meeting to order. The 1uncheon—meetings of ODK
represented a unique and noteworthy feature of this national honorary
fraternity, for at these meetings outstanding men in the upper classes meet
with each other and with members of the faculty and administration to
discuss student affairs, world affairs, and life in general.

Prominent among the many functions of ODK were the selection of the
ODK Man of the Year, the regional convention at Grove City College,
and the Founder’s Day banquet where alumni rejoined the present mem-
bers and renewed old acquaintances.

ODK membership is not based on a student’s ability to eat, however, but
rather on a recognition of those upperclassmen who have excelled in three
ﬁe1ds—scholarship, leadership, and integrity. As a result, being tapped
for membership into this honorary fraternity is one of the highest awards
a man at Pitt can receive.

Meetings of Pi Delta Epsilon were the epitome of informality,
but then, it is not necessary to be staid and formal in order to

students, but above and beyond
this, they are the pre—medical
students, the future doctors.
With this aim in mind, the mem-

of academic achievement and intellectual

Not only are the members of Phi Eta
Sigma interested in their own scholastic
betterment, but they also have an eye

service is provided in many subjects to
assist those students who are having
academic difficulties. On the social side,
Phi Eta Sigma holds a number of smok-

similar interests gather together
an organized club often grows

Talk is not all labs and studies.
Planning the Open House and

and late meetings. The girls do
plan around a scientiﬁc topic
with activities such as a cyclo-
tron lab planned for the fall. The
matching of lab experiments and
the late night—early morning dis-
cussions of the sciences of today
are peppered with talk of dates
and dances. Quax is a mixture
of the female in the scientiﬁc

The visitor who tries to navigate the vast resources of the Ca-

purpose that the University has its Quo Vadis girls. These are
the young ladies who guide the Pitt tourist and serve as the special
events hostesses for such events as the Chancellor’s receptions
and the receptions for the freshman parents. Each month the
members have a dinner, with the menu representing a foreign
country, as well as a speaker representing that same country.
These girls are the same girls that one can ﬁnd twisting at the
Holiday, playing on the Cathedral lawn, and saying goodnight at
the dorms. Not only are they typical of the co—ed at the Univer-
sity, they are serving the public and the school.

SIGMA THETA TAU

Sigma Theta Tau, National Honorary Society of Nursing, remains
the only national honorary for nurses in the United States. En-
couraging high professional standards, Sigma Theta Tau requires
members to maintain a 3.0 QPA and to show evidence of leader-
ship. These nursing students have a rich liberal arts background
in addition to having intensively studied in the various ﬁelds of
nursing and related health professions. Pitt’s Eta chapter pro-
vides a full tuition scholarship each year to a worthy student en-
rolled in the nursing program. In addition to its fostering of
scholarship, Sigma Theta Tau maintains an active social program
throughout the year.

Activities are the all—consuming side
lights of the college career. There are
official, sponsored activities and the un—
official, “we”—inspired activities. Activi-
ties are the relief from a long week of
studying, the build—up to a swinging
week—end, or they may be the week it-
self, leaving little time for anything but
attending meetings and social events.

Activities are not segregated to any one
time in particular. Bridge in the Tuck
Shop is as much an activity as the
Christmas Dance. In the yearbook, ac-
tivities are those things that some stu-
dents have strings of besides their name.
The never—ending round of club meet-
ings, dinners, and luncheons can, if the
personality engaging in them is nimble-
footed, take most of the college day.

Activities are time-consuming, study-
procrastinating, dorm-evading. They are
the objects of grumbling. “I have six
meetings today.” But they are also the
source of joy and accomplishment. Ap-
plause for a good performance, a lively
discussion, a trophy won, or the lesson of
power politics satisfy the varying needs
of university students.

 

“I’ve been standing in line for three hours
and I’ll be damned if I’ll go back and
start again!” Such was the story of
Registration. The nightmare was upon
us with its shroud of secrecy and its
shouts of delirium. Women fainted and
strong men cried. The skritch of long
unused pens on narrow cards gave
students an opportunity to practice agility
in penmanship, which was needed to
write around the perforations which
peppered each card. For two days,
students were no longer human beings;
they were a pattern of holes punched

in a square of cardboard.

ALUMNI BOARD

Parties in Miami, meetings to organize
scholarship funds, and the annual Smor-
gasbord served to bring graduates of the
University into close contact with the
latest happenings on the campus.

Dinners with the new graduates of each
school brought to the students’ attention
that just because they were graduating
need not mean the complete severing of
their ties with Pitt. As members of the
Alumni Association, they can keep in
touch with old friends, make new friends,
help their school, and keep up with the
constantly changing ﬁeld of education.

An elaborate program involving alumni
in the activities of the University keep
ties strong. Talking at the dance and the
parties after the Homecoming game, a
chat on the golf course at Wildwood, and
small talk while waiting in line for the
Smorgasbord, bring together people of
varying memories and a common interest.

The Alumni Board has much more than
a social function. Supporting Pitt ﬁnan-
cially, through their Council, and by
their enthusiasm, the alumni are an im-
portant part of the University.

ARMY ROTC

“Inspection Today” are the words which strike
fear into the heart of every ROTC student. This
announcement means that they will be forced to
stand at attention before the tough oﬁicer or
“gung—ho” upperclassman and hope that he does
not spot the dirty brass or the imperfect spit shine
on his shoes. The freshman soon learns that
ROTC is not the easy road to the ofﬁcer’s club.
The Thursday soldier marches in formation on
the Cathedral lawn, checks the bulletin board,
cleans M—l’s, shines shoes, salutes officers, and
memorizes the ROTC manuals. lt soon becomes
a tiresome, but necessary, grind.

After the freshman struggles through the first two
years of basic ROTC, he is ordered to take his
physical for the advanced course. He is told to
lose weight, gain weight, or raise his fallen arches.
If he passes the physical, Battle Group Week-end
and Summer Camp await him.

ASSOCIATED
WOMEN STUDENTS

During twelfth ﬂoor meetings of the Executive Board, the
problems of the individual committees were discussed.
The Social Committee put everyone to work on the huge
Parents’ Week-End project that began the year. Thou-
sands of envelopes were addressed, talent rounded up,
hundreds of yellow mum corsages were ordered, brunches
and open houses were arranged. With everyone pitching
in to help, the week-end was a success.

Successful, too, were the language tables organized by
the Scholarship Committee. Meeting for lunch several
times a week, the members of these groups spoke only in

a foreign language during the meal. Luncheon small talk
took on a new importance when it was carried on in
Spanish or Russian.

The Executive Board also discussed problems that fall
under the auspices of none of the committees. With Presi-
dent Mary Lou Karges attending the monthly luncheons
given by Chancellor Litchﬁeld, the Executive Board had
an opportunity to learn how the administration felt about

certain questions and, through Mary Lou, to express their .

thinking to Dr. Litchﬁeld.

Much discussed was the invitation to the I.A.W.S. Reg-
ional Meet and the three hundred industry-representing
favors that Pitt was expected to send. The vote split down
the middle with half of the membership favoring pickle
pins while the rest favored steel ingots.

CANTERBURY CLUB

Canterbury Club draws its youthful members into all ac-
tivities of church life. Emphasizing worship, study, work,
and play, students attending the bi—weekly meetings ﬁnd
that they have much in common.

Holy Communion followed by dinner in the Parish Hall
begins each evening meeting. Discussion follows, center-
ing on the Church, its life and its work.

A broad outline of the subjects to be covered in the dis-
cussion periods is worked out by members of the Canter-
bury Club and the Church of Ascension Chaplain. Sub-

ejects this year ranged from “The Christian Sacrament of

Marriage” and “The Theology of Christian Creeds” to
“The History of the Reformation of the Church in Eng-
land.”

Every few months a dress—up dance is held by club mem-
bers. Between these dances there are “coke” parties and
informal dances and picnics.

E. & M. CABINET

To the two-thousand—odd engineers who make the
daily climb up the Hill to classes, the Engineering
and Mines Cabinet is a convenient short—cut. It
is a place to go when you need tickets for the
Shamrock Ball, somewhere to lodge a complaint
when one of the vending machines in the lounge
steals your nickel, or an oﬂice to locate a ballot
box for the Purple Shaft nominees.

The members of the cabinet, selected from stu-
dents in the various departments, organize every-
thing from the judging of displays during Engi-
neer’s Week to interviews for the Emitt Award.
The E&M ofﬁce, located strategically just off the
main lounge is a continual center of activity dur-
ing the day and usually well into the night. The
myriad details of arranging social functions such
as the Fall Ball or the mixers during Engineer’s
Week keep the representatives continually phon-
ing department oﬂices and arranging for the
West View Park Danceland.

The student engineers on Pitt’s campus take pride
in the fact that their form of student government
is a much stronger organization than the govern-
ment down “on the campus.” The strength of
fellowship provided by the E&M Cabinet should
be admired and emulated by other campus organ-
izations.

FOTO CLUB

On the fourth ﬂoor of the Student Union
the members of the Pitt Foto Club mer-
rily go about developing negatives, run-
ning proof sheets, and producing prints
which are occasionally sold to those per-
sons whom the club patronizingly calls
“customers.” A visitor to the fourth ﬂoor
sees Stanley dashing from one room to
another wearing rubber gloves and an
apron that appears to be refuse from a
grease pit, Jerry relaxing on the couch,
ﬂipping ashes onto the carpet, noncha—
lantly waiting until Irv ﬁnishes ruining
his negatives in the darkroom, and Mar-
gie trying to get Joel to pay his club dues.

The club’s darkrooms are cluttered with
the equipment ‘necessary to produce the
prize—winning photos which the members
continually produce despite all adversity.
Enlargers, ﬁlters, bottle openers, lenses,
and Corkscrews clutter the shelves. The
walls are papered with cryptic messages
such as PAY YOUR FOTO CLUB
DUES and DO NOT LEAVE THIS
DARKROOM DIRTY——$2 FINE.
When the club members are not busy
working in the darkrooms, they diligently
work at their only other activity—learn—
ing how to spell “photo.”

GLEE CLUB

The Glee Club will sing anything from Bach to
Bernstein. But they are discriminating about
their audiences. These men prefer women’s col-
leges. This year Elmira and Wilson played hostess
to the crew. At Elmira, Wade Silberman roamed
the streets accompanied by his guitar. John Will—
ard had his chance to serenade at Wilson College.
After the group returned to Pittsburgh, they sang
a beneﬁt for Sharon Hospital. That memorable
evening was highlighted by the dance that fol-
lowed with “a bevy of young beauties.”

The Glee Club brings together boys of diverse
interests. David Reese, the Girk, wants to be Jose
Jimenez. Pat Waite, on the other hand, wants to
perpetuate the popularity of wigs. Similarly, the
Glee Club does not restrict its activities to singing.
From Elmira to Pittsburgh, the members are
known as skillful chefs, swingin’ singers, and
connoisseurs of the ﬁner things in life.

HEINZ CHAPEL CHOIR

Along with the customary Tuesday noon chapel services, the
choir sang for various churches, entertained at the International
Christmas Party, and caroled in local hospitals. At the Chancel-
lor’s Christmas Reception, the choir strolled through the Com-
mon’s Room and around the second and third ﬂoor corridors sing-
ing traditional carols. Special activities included a television show,
the annual winter banquet, and a buffet with Men’s Glee Club
and Women’s Chorale. The annual choir camp was held at Camp
Crestview near Slippery Rock. Between twist and limbo sessions,
the choir managed to sing a total of twelve hours that week—end.
Even Mr. Colton and Bill Warner enjoyed Joyce’s Twist lessons.
Nobody ever said a word about the dry leaves found in a few
beds. As usual, there were several members late to each meal,
and the rest of the choir heard a few solo performances of the
Seven—fold Amen.

IDEAS AND FIGURES

Amid _all the rush on the fourth ﬂoor of the SU exists the literary mag
of the Pitt student. Ideas and Figures offers the student at Pitt an oppor-
tunity to have his writings and art work selected for publication. This in
itself is no easy task. For the staff it involves long nights of decision-
making and long days of preparations for the publishing of the magazine.
For the student who chooses to submit a piece of his work it involves the
time and agony that all so often are a prerequisite to a good piece of
material. Ideas are not easy to come by and the vast repetition of subjects
presents problems for Susanna and the rest of the Ideas and Figures per-
sonnel. Even though the magazine is the baby as far as Pitt publications
go, it is rapidly becoming one of the most popular among the students.
As is the case with any deadline publication, there is the rush at two in
the morning and the hurried readings to get the magazine out on time.
There are burgers from the White Tower and empty cigarette packs
littering the room and sleepy heads nodding, as for another year the Ideas
and Figures goes to bed.

PITT CAPSULE

The Capsule is one of the student publications
that not many students realize exists. For those
who do, it affords an inner look at the new
materials and advances in the ﬁeld of pharmacy.
Once a student is a member of the school of
pharmacy, he is then eligible to do the research
and sweating that getting a professional publica-
tion to press four times a year requires. While
others sleep, there is to be found a nucleus of
late workers who sit counting words and typing
copy at a frantic pace. Photographs have to be
ﬁnished and layouts are to be done. Only those
who know can speak of the work that goes into
such an endeavor. While keeping the undergradu-
ate informed of the latest advancements in phar-
macy, the Pitt Capsule ﬁnds its way into the
hands of many alumni as well. While a knack for
writing is not necessary, the staff member of the
Capsule must be willing to learn and do research
late many a night and early.many a mom, for it
is in this manner that such a magazine comes into
being.

Mondays and Thursdays were red—eyed days for PITT NEWS staff members.
Twice each week, week after week, they wrote news stories, heads, columns,
gathered advertising, a syndicated column and one cartoon. Then on the big dead-
line nights, the stall put it all together. The stack of newspapers piled in the Student
Union and at the Student Desk gave little indication of what happened on the
fourth ﬂoor the previous Monday or Thursday to make the paper possible.

There was Julie and her birthday . . . TB’s imitation of Ida Mae . . . pizza money
from Rango . . . Matt’s motor scooter . . . “The High and the Mighty” . . . chair
races . . . a letter from a psych major . . . photographers . . . banquet at the
Playhouse and The Three Penny Opera . . . letters to the editor . . . Jackie’s

giggle . . . Miami and the Fountainbleu.

Searching for a picture to ﬁll a hole on the front page at four in the morning

. racing to the printer as the sun came up . . . Barry writing every head

. . cokes and a toasted cheese sandwich for Vijay . . . it was all part of putting
out each issue of “One of the Great Student Newspapers.”

POLARIS

The portable radio blared baseball, echoing the clamor from Forbes Field, the
phone rang, typewriters clattered, but through the confusion of noise, members of
the Polaris stall managed to put together a handbook. Each member of the staﬁ”
concentrated on his own specialty.

Every detail of the freshman handbook, the POLARIS, was carefully thought
out and worked through. The typists struggled with the copy; somehow a word, a
comma, or a period always managed to be left out, added on, or in the wrong
place. Getting correct information, then putting it in clear, concise language wor-
ried the writers. The business staff concerned itself with keeping ﬁnances straight
by counting everything from pennies to stationery.

The editor’s job on this handbook was to worry with all of the staff members
and then to worry a little on his own. To the editor, John Vrana, fell all of the
detail jobs, from designing the letterhead for the stationery to keeping the freshman
pictures in alphabetical order.

SKYSCRAPER ENGINEER

One Thursday each month, student engi-
neers can be seen digging into their pock-
ets for a quarter in order to purchase a
slick magazine. The casual observer, at
ﬁrst glance, may think that the magazine
vendor is eagerly hawking pornographic
literature. But as he draws closer, he
hears the words, “Get your Skyscraper
Engineer!” He also sees the buyers of
the magazine ﬂipping quickly to the joke
section, appropriately called “Slips O’ the
Stick.” If curiosity prompts him to get
his own copy, he will be able to read one
of the ﬁnest student engineering maga-
zines in the country.

Published on the fourth ﬂoor of the Stu-
dent Union by students registered in the
School of Engineering and Mines, the
Skyscraper Engineer features articles
covering everything from missile fueling
systems to far—out science ﬁction. Excel-
lent management, ﬁne writing, and amus-
ing artwork help to make this magazine
one of the best in its ﬁeld.

STUDENT GOVERNMENT

“Who Gets What, When, and How” was an important book of rules for members
of Student Government. Most senators worked under the assumption that the stu-
dent body should get more as soon as possible by any means within reason.

Reasonable means of getting more for the students at Pitt usually involved hours
of discussion at Senate meetings, setting—up of committees, investigation reports
from the committees, and then more discussion. Occasionally, results could be
seen. Library hours were changed, a PEP committee was organized, and a student-
run book exchange became a reality. More often, a long time passed before re-
turns on Senate work could be seen. A year passed before the results of the
petitions prepared by S.G. and signed by students for the removal of sales tax
from text books could be noticed. But the tax was removed, making all the work
of the senators worthwhile.

STUDENT UNION BOARD

With cookies and tea to bolster their energy, the members
of the Student Union Board organize and administer one
of the country’s largest and ﬁnest student union programs.
Watching the concerts, the Midday lectures, or the
dances, it all seems simple and smooth. Board members
know it is not always as easy as it looks. There is always
some small problem like getting two grand pianos for a
double piano concert, rain in the middle of a summer
dance on the patio, or persuading the Union’s secretary
Irene to wear a pair of white tights and play assistant
for the mime show at Stephen Foster Memorial.

For Board members their work in the Student Union is
more than luncheons and lectures. It means meetings at
the Greek’s . . . big party at Larry’s . . . Doreen . . .
music from “West Side Story” . . . chandeliers and marble
ﬂoors . . . Peter, Paul and Mary and their “Lemon Tree”
. . . Jean’s laugh . . . The Desk . . . good buddies . . .
and the satisfaction of a year’s work well—done.

A.S.C.E.

To better prepare the new
engineer for his future
work, Pitt’s chapter of the
American Society of Civil
Engineers worked to bring
its members into close con-
tact withithe professional
men of their ﬁeld. The din-
ners are run in a very busi-
nesslike manner, but these
men are students as well as
future engineers. They can
be found in every corner of
the campus, participating
in the student 7 activities.
Late beers and early class-
es are all a part of forming
the man and the ASCE is
what forms the under-
standing and comprehen-
sive engineer.

BUS. AD. CABINET

One of the newer members of the vast
student government groups on Pitt’s cam-

with the idea of promoting and helping
the programs of the School of Business
Administration. After Bryan Saylor has
adjourned a meeting, one might find a
member of the cabinet planning for the
Cabinet picnic or sending his suit to the
cleaners for the luncheon the following
week. The various seminars scheduled by
the group are centered around one major
topic of interest: the problems of the
Business major in school and out. The
group meets to discuss and hear the Bus
Ad person speak of his problems. After
the formalities of meetings and luncheons
the members can often be found con-
tinuing their discussions in the back of

HILLEL

A brunch of 10x and bagels on Sunday
mornings ended the week of activities
sponsored by the Pitt Chapter of B’nai
Brith Hillel. The week began every Tues-
day and Thursday with lectures given by
Dr. Rubenstein. Tuesday’s lectures cov-
ered many phases of the current topic
of discussion—“Existentialism, Religion,
Modern Literature.” The lectures given
on Thursday presented “An Introduction
to Jewish Life and Thought.” Many were
the Sunday nights when music and laugh—
ter could be heard coming from the
Y.M.H.A. There was the Chanukah
party which featured folk singer, Vivien
Richman. Spontaneous dancing began
when she and her two accompanists
rendered the spirited Hava Nagilah.

PHI DELTA CHI

The Pitt chapter of Phi Delta Chi has
the distinction of being the only campus
honorary that owns a house, which is a
great advantage to its members. Located
on Lothrop Street, conveniently close to
the Nurses’ Residence, the house be-
comes a center of activity for all its men.
The monthly meetings usually degenerate
into parties, with the treasury providing
everything from refreshments to dates.

Phi Delta Chi selects its members from
pharmacy students having a good pro-
fessional grade average and a good
moral character. These high qualiﬁca-
tions are a fraternity tradition, as is its
ﬂower, the carnation, and its colors,
which are Old Gold and Drcgs of Wine.
Another tradition is the custom of sitting
on the porch with one bleary eye on the
Nurses’ Residence, computing the room
numbers of promising-looking student
nurses.

But Phi Delta Chi also has its serious
side, with recruitment drives in high
schools, setting up National Pharmacy
Week displays in drugstores, and organ-
izing a tutoring program for freshmen.

WOMEN’S CHORAL

In their white blazers the members of
Women’s Choral gather three times a
week for several hours of singing. From
freshman to senior, they practice inten-
sively under the direction of Professor
Colton. Their hard work is rewarded by
the enthusiastic applause which follows
their concerts.

The week—end of fall camp means much
more to the members of Women’s Choral

books take care of the mental stimula-
tion of the student and social aﬁairs
handle that side of the student, the Wom-

whole range of sports activities. Swim-
ming, tennis, riding and hockey are only
a few of the activities that one can par-

SEASON DISAPPOINTING FOR PANTHERS

Early December snow marked the end of this year’s season. The Pan-
thers were a greatly different team from the original squad that had
started the season in mid-September. In ten weeks, the Panthers had
faced strong opposition from some of the country’s toughest football
schools. Denounced as bums one week, they were hailed as mighty
heroes the next. On the ﬁeld, cheers and boos followed on each
other’s heels, with even John Michelosen coming in for his share of
attention.

It was a tough season for the coach. He was greeted with yells of
“Take a hike, Mike,” at almost every home game. He even found
himself hanging in efﬁgy from a ﬂag pole in front of the Student
Union following an upset defeat by West Virginia.

But the season was not without its brighter side; the large number of
sophomores on the squad gained valuable experience. Rick Leeson,
Paul Martha, and Pete Billey were among the several sophomores
who proved invaluable. Their running and excellent defensive play-
ing sheds a glimmer of hope for next season. Students and sports-
writers also acclaimed the ﬁne place-kicking of Fred Cox. Without
his ﬁeld goals against Miami and Southern California, the Panthers
might have ﬁnished the season with a much poorer record. In the
course of the season, the Panthers did win three games, knocking over
Miami early in the season, beating a bowl—bound Southern California
team, and sinking Navy by a score of 28-14.

The Panthers got 0115 to a good start as they downed Miami, 10-7.
The ﬁrst half of the game was played under a bright Miami sun, and
Pitt was behind by a score of 7-3 at half—time, the three points com-
ing by way of a Fred Cox ﬁeld goal. But the second half was played
in pouring rain which drowned Miami spirits and gave the Panthers
the sort of weather they were used to. The hero of the game was
Paul Martha, who scored Pitt’s winning touchdown on an 80-yard
run.

The Baylor Bears proved that they had the ability to come up with
the big play at the big moment. The Panthers led 13-3 at the half,
but Baylor came roaring back to score two touchdowns. After the
ﬁnal whistle, the stunned Panthers still could not understand how they
had managed to lose the game. Coach Michelosen commented, “We
just let them out of the hole when we had their backs to the wall.”

A heart-breaking loss to the Washington University
Huskies was the story of the Panthers’ third game.
Until the last few moments, it apparently was a Vic-
tory for the Panthers. Then lightning struck as the
Huskies scored on a 42-yard pass to make the score
22-17, with the Panthers on the short end.

A ﬁred—up West Virginia team came looking for
blood in the annual grudge battle, and a tired Pitt
squad found themselves in trouble all the way
through the game, ﬁnally losing by a score of 20-6.
The Panthers’ blocking and tackling was not up to its
best, and their only touchdown proved to be far too
little to win over the enraged mounties.

The Panthers traveled to Los Angeles looking for their
second win of the season. After winning their opening
game with Miami, the Panthers had dropped the next
three. They were hungry for a win, and also for venge-
ance. In the UCLA game the previous year, the Panthers
had been beaten by a crew of officials who were all from
the West Coast. But it all proved to be useless, as the
Panthers returned to Pittsburgh a beaten team.

The underdog Panthers put on a show of power as they
rolled over the Midshipmen from Annapolis, 28-14. A
formidable Navy team, with a 3-2 record, fell easy
prey to the ﬁred—up Panthers. Until the ﬁnal minutes, it
looked like a Panther shutout, but the Middies managed
to roll up two touchdowns against Pitt’s “B” unit.

Archbold stadium was the scene of one of the
Panthers’ toughest games. After losing to Syracuse
28-9, the Panthers knew that they had played
against one of the country’s best football squads.
The Panthers were outplayed by a powerful Syra-
cuse backﬁeld, led by All—American Ernie Davis,
who scored two touchdowns and set a new Syra-
cuse rushing record.

A last ditch scoring attempt by the Cats was
thwarted by the Fighting Irish of Notre Dame,
felling Pitt by the score of 26-20. Fred Cox kept
the Panthers out of the hole by booting many long
punts and leading the scoring efforts of Pitt with
14 of the 20* points. It was the ﬁrst Irish victory
after three consecutive losses to Pitt Panther
teams.

passing last year’s record set by Bob Clemens). Denny
Chillinsky was “Johnny on the Spot,” recovering two Tro-
jan fumbles at opportune moments in the game. After a
disappointing season, the Panthers placed another victory
in the win column before a highly partisan Homecoming
crowd.

The game against Penn State climaxed a long season for
the Panthers. They were never in the game, losing 43-13.
It was the last appearance in a Pitt uniform for 12 mem-
bers of the squad, but there are upcoming sophomores to
take their places. Whether or not the sophomores will be
able to do the job that their predecessors have remains a
problem for next year’s coaches.

SOCCGT

IMPROVES ON PREVIOUS SEASON

Soccer does not attract quite as many spectators as football, but it is
just as rough and bruising. A spectator, watching the team play a
game with shin guards as their only protection, can almost feel the
body contact between the players.

The soccer team posted a formidable record this year, with six wins,
four losses, and one tie. Two of the losses were to St. Louis and
West Chester, who battled one another for the National Collegiate
Athletic Association Championship this year.

Highlights of the season include an upset over a strong Penn State
team and a 4-3 win over previously undefeated Akron University.
Also, Corky Cuthbert, Pitt’s high scorer, scored thirteen goals, an out-
standing record for a college player. .

This year’s 6-4-1 record was an improvement over last season. Coach
Leo Bemis had many promising young players on this year’s fresh-
man team, and a supplemented varsity should be able to step onto
Kennard ﬁeld next year and pursue a rough, winning soccer season.

cross country

CONDITIONS FOR TRACK

During the Fall, Pitt’s Cross-Country men invade Schenley Park and
change the park’s summer scene of picnics and relaxation into a
cross-country racing-course. Beginning at Flagstaff Hill, Pitt’s Cross-
Country runners race over hills and bushy paths through a four and
one-half mile course in cross-country competition, disturbing sun-
bathers and catching the attention of the Schenley Park sight-seers.

Although this year’s record was not impressive, four wins and ﬁve
losses, the team composed of Sophomores and Juniors gained valu-
able experience which will be encouraging to Pitt for the next two
years.

If you watched a cross-country race this year, you saw one Pitt
Sophomore far ahead of the rest racing toward the ﬁnish line. This
runner, Steve Waslo, came “home” first in competition with regular-
ity throughout the season. A strong desire to win, combined with
physical ﬁtness that he acquired by running three miles a day dur-
ing the summer, moved Steve from the number two man on the
Freshman Team to the number one man on the Varsity this year.
Steve loves to run and chose Pitt over other schools because of keener
competition here.

Aside from being a competitive sport on its own, Cross-Country has
another purpose. It prepares and conditions men for Pitt’s Spring
track team. This coordination of athletics is a ﬁne example of the
method which Pitt’s athletic department uses to encourage physical
ﬁtness for its athletes throughout the year.

Every year the cross-country team must face rugged opponents.
When schools such as Navy and Penn State come to Pitt to run on
Flagstaff Hill, the team must be in top physical condition. This is the
reason for the long, grueling, daily practice sessions. Lungs burn,
legs ache, and sweat pours off the runners. But the back-breaking
practice ﬁnally pays off in the Saturday meets, when the runners can
call on the little extra reserve of energy that would not be available
without such tough conditions.

toward the ﬁnish line as he ends a workout at the Schenley
Park course.

On the elevated ﬂoor at the Field House, the Pitt basketball team annually
comes up against stiff opposition from some of the country’s best basketball
colleges. Playing twice a week during the winter months, the Pitt ﬁve meets
teams from Arizona to West Virginia.

This year’s season was no exception. Ohio State, Westminster, and Duquesne,
which eventually wound up in the National Invitation Tournament in New
York, were only a few of the rugged teams that Pitt faced. The Panthers did
not come through the season unscarred, but they managed to win more than
they lost, posting a ﬁnal record of 12 wins and 11 losses.

Included in this record are four tournament games, as the Panthers played
two games in each of the Steel Bowl and Evansville Tournaments. While
other students were comfortably enjoying their Christmas vacation, the bas-
ketball team was sweating its way through the annual Steel Bowl Tourna-
ment. The ﬁrst team Pitt had to face was the University of Arizona, whom
they trounced by the comfortable margin of 25 points. But in the second
round, the Panther hopes faded as they came up against the NIT—bound
Duquesne ﬁve. Pitt did its best, but the team from downtown was just a little
too much for the Panthers as they dropped the game by 3 points. In the
Evansville tournament, which took place a few weeks later, the Panthers had
to face both Tennessee and Evansville. In the ﬁrst round game against Ten-
nessee, Pitt lost by one point in an overtime period. The team bounced back
the following game defeating Evansville 89 to 83. After the tournaments were
over, the Panthers split the remaining games on their schedule, losing seven
and winning seven.

When the season records were compiled, Cal Shefﬁeld came out on top as
high scorer for the Panthers. His 375 points were instrumental in the Pitt vic-
tories. Brian Generalovich proved to be the best Panther board man as he col-
lected 203 rebounds during the season. He also was close behind Cal Sheﬂield
in scoring, with a total of 343 points. Another outstanding Panther was Paul
Krieger, who picked 187 rebounds off the boards.

The basketball season should provide a glimmer of exciting games to come in
the near future as four sophomores were the mainstay of the 1962 team.

COACH PEERY anticipates the wrestler’s next move.

 

RATED SIXTH IN NATION

Coach Rex Peery must have told his wrestlers to win or else, because when
the dust cleared from the Field House mats, the Pitt wrestling team was the
proud possessor of a 7-1-1 record. This winning season represents a great
improvement over last year, when the Panthers compiled a 6-3 mark. Win-
ning only one more game than the previous year and switching one of the
losses to the tie column may not appear to be such a magniﬁcent achieve-
ment, but it was good enough to win for the team the honor of being second
in the East.

Pitt’s wrestlers started off the season with a tie in the match with Michigan
State, but from then on it was easy work as the victories followed each other
in rapid succession. Syracuse, Army, Northwestern, Cornell, Navy, and Mary-
land all bowed to the Panther wrestlers. The wins were not by one or two
points, but were by crushing margins. Syracuse and Maryland only scored
two points each, but Navy did a little better, as the Middies came through
with three. The Panther wrestlers were undefeated until they met with Lehigh
in the next to the last match of the season. Lehigh had lost the previous
year’s match to Pitt, and this loss had been rated as the upset of the year in
college wrestling. The Engineers from Bethlehem got their revenge as they
handed Pitt a 17-14 loss. The loss must have rattled the team, because they
just squeaked by Penn State by a score of 15-14 in the last match of the
season.

Although the individual Pitt wrestlers did not fare too well in the annual
post—season tournaments, the record that they compiled during the regular
season seems to be enough evidence of their prowess. The long, sweaty
hours of practice in the Field House wrestling room, Rex Peery’s constant
insistence of perfection in the calisthenics, the sit—out, the ﬁgure-fours, re-
verses, take—downs—all came in handy for the Pitt wrestlers when the time
came to compete on the mats. Coach Peery, who is one of the country’s out-
standing wrestling coaches, is a typical example of the ﬁne quality of coaches
which the Pitt Athletic Department tries to acquire for all its sports.

In recent years, the Pitt swimming team has been treated like a
homeless child. Since Pitt, at present, has no pool of its own, the team
has been forced to practice and compete in such places as the Frick
School matchbox and the Young Men’s and Women’s Hebrew Asso-
ciation pool. But the athletic department has taken pity on the swim-
mers and has acquired funds for a new pool. It will be located with
the rest of the Pitt physical education buildings, on top of the hill
across from the Field House. It will be more than large enough for
the swimming team; physical education classes in swimming can be
held while the team is running through its practices. The new pool
will be one of the ﬁnest in National Collegiate Athletic Association
competition, and if good equipment aids athletes in winning, then
Pitt’s swimming team should have no trouble coming through with
undefeated seasons in the coming years.

This year’s swimming team did not fare badly, even though it did not
have a home pool. The swimmers came through with one of the best
records of all the Pitt teams in intercollegiate competition, winning
eight of their meets and losing only three. The three meets in which
Pitt came out on the short end of the score were with Maryland, Syra-
cuse, and North Carolina State. But these losing meets were only
momentary setbacks for the swimmers cracked one record after an-
other. From the opening meet in which they drowned West Vir-
ginia, to the last one, in which they squeaked by Notre Dame, the
Pitt swimmers were conﬁdent that this would be a successful season.

SPLIT SEASON

After a weary week of practice sessions in the
gymnastics room in the basement of the Field
House, the Pitt gymnasts drag their mats and
equipment up to the basketball ﬂoor for the meet.
A smattering of spectators, usually consisting
mainly of the team’s immediate families, watches
the team reveal excellent form and coordination
as it goes through its exercises. On the horse, the
ﬂying rings, or the parallel bars, the Pitt team
comes through in ﬁne style. The long hours of
practicing routines which include vaults, dis-
mounts, and “Iron Crosses” pay off in the Satur-
day meets.

This season, the Panthers split eight meets, with
four wins and four losses. Earl McConnell proved
to be an indispensable member of the team as he
ﬁnished the season with the honor of being rated
the number one gymnast in the East. He swept the
tournament at West Point, defeating all comers
and winning a position on the All American team,
the only Eastern gymnast to do so. At the na-
tion-wide tournament in Albuquerque, New Mex-
ico, he defeated ﬁfty-three others in the free exer-
cise event and ﬁnished third in the tournament.

It is not a difficult task to pick out squash players from
the rest of the Pitt athletes. The squash players are the
ones with the round black and blue marks all over them.
In the matchbox-size_ squash courts hidden in the end of
the Field house, the squash team holds its nightly prac-
tices. Their welts are produced by a small black, hard-
rubber ball traveling at better than a hundred miles an
hour. The sport demands a fantastic amount of coordi-
nation, along with great stamina, since the game requires
a player to be fast on his feet. The conditioning needed
for squash is produced by daily runs on the board track in
the Field House. As physical education students puff and
pant their way through their twice—weekly half—mile, the
members of the squash team easily sprint by them in the
daily mile run required by squash coach Bill Summers.
Mr. Summers is in his ﬁfth year as a squash coach at Pitt,
and the ﬁne job he has done shows up in Pitt’s being
rated as the number twelve squash team in the nation. In-
dividual team members also stand high in the national
rankings, such as captain Joe Brown, undefeated this sea-
son, who is ranked seventh in the country among college

squash players.

SIGH OF RELIEF AT SEASON’S END

If the word “Hurrah” characterizes the showing of the baseball
and tennis teams, then the correct word for the track team’s show-
ing this year is “Snarf.” The competition was tough, and the
Panther performance was never up to the occasion. Disastrous
defeats by Miami of Ohio, Penn State, Navy and Syracuse were
the story of the season, as the trackmen lost every meet. The only
happy note during the four meets were an outscoring of West
Virginia in a triple meet with the Mountaineers and Syracuse, and
the outstanding performance of Joe Friend throughout the season.

Friend was the “man of the hour” for the Panthers as he man-
aged to score a high percentage of Pitt’s points in all the meets.
In the meet with Navy, Pitt had a total of 371/2 p0ints——141/2 of
them scored by Friend. He won the broad jump and high hurdles,
placed second in the low hurdle competition and ran on the win-
ning mile relay team. Friend was the sparkplug, but the trackmen
needed more than a spark to set them on ﬁre this year.

A TOUGH SEASON

One of the newest of Pitt’s varsity sports,
the riﬂe team is in its second year of
NCAA competition. Coached by Master
Sergeant Bostwick, the team members
learn the ﬁne points of marksmanship.
The sharpshooters soon discover that it
is a lot easier to hit the bull when you are
practicing with your own team than when
you are in competition with another
school. Palms sweat, and hands begin to
shake. The coughing and ﬁdgeting of the
people behind the ﬁring line does not
help a nervous riﬂeman.

Marksmanship requires great concentra-
tion and an ability to remain calm under
pressure. This ability comes only with ex-
perience, which the Pitt riﬂe squad has
managed to gain in its ﬁrst two years as a
varsity sport. Although the team posted a
winless record, the experience gained
through competition will prove invalu-
able in the coming years.

 

THE SPOTTERS keep a careful eye on the targets as the
match progresses. The use of a spotting scope is a valuable aid
in coaching a riﬂe team.

A bubbling test tube, a simmering retort. and the smell of guinea
pigs were burned into the senses of the researcher. In the
daylight hours, he worked as a graduate assistant. He answered
the questions that had long since become an integral part of his
life, showed the students the simple tricks of procedure that

kept them from maiming themselves, and consoled his class on

the day after a hairy lecture examination. His nights were spent
in the buildings on the Hill; he knew the laboratories of Alumni
Hall better than the wrinkles on his sweetheart’s forehead. And
during the long days and nights, he wondered if it was possible
to ﬁnish his project before his grant ran out.

DEFEAT AND DISCOURAGEMENT

This season, the golf team’s colors should
have been changed from Blue and Gold
to Black and White. It was a sad year
for the squad as they lost every match
on the schedule. The scores ranged from
a horrendous 26-l debacle in the Ohio
State match to a ‘slightly closer score of
91/2-81/2 against Duquesne.

Various reasons were given for the fail-
ures on the links, but the one that seemed
to have the most truth behind it was the

T complaint that, at Pitt, golf means about

 

as much as polo or cricket. One of the
players complained, “They only had one
guy on scho1arship—and he was a
hacker.” The player was referring to
himself, but the truth remains nonethe-
less.

LIGHT IN THE DARKNESS

The Panther tennis team received a lot of valuable experience in jumping over the
net this season, as they won eight of their matches. Dropping only three and tying
one, they managed to post one of their better marks. Especially satisfying wins
were the three matches in which they shut out their opponents, knocking oﬁ"
Duquesne by a score of 9-0 and sinking Navy twice, with the ﬁnal score being
1-0 each time.

Two of the outstanding netters on the squad this season were Dave O’Loughlin
and Joe Brown. O’Loughlin ﬁnished the year with a season record of 10 wins and
one loss, while Joe Brown wound up with 9 victories and only 2 defeats. The
tennis squad’s winning mark was one of the few bright lights in a year of darkness
for Pitt athletics. i

WINNING SEASON ON THE DIAMOND

FIRST ROW: A. Alex, J. Sylvis, H. Kane, J. Carlisle, L. Carra, R. Shutterly, SECOND
ROW: C. Cuthbert, D. Wagner, J. Yedlicka, D. Williamson, J. Cioiﬁ, M. Supsura, B. Fisher.
BACK ROW: Coach B. Lewis, A. Ricciuti, B. Wetzal, R. Barton, P. Martha, R. Supansic,
T. Brown, J. Giarusso, A. Chotiner‘—Manager.

The place is Forbes ‘Field. The time—a warm spring
afternoon. The pitcher squints in toward the catcher for
his signal, the gold P on his cap glinting in the sunlight.
Two men are out, and the winning runs are on second
and third. The pitcher goes through his windup, hesitates
a moment, and ﬁres his best fast ball. The batter stares
numbly as the ball ﬂashes by him. The umpire screams
“Yer out!” But there is no roar of victory from the crowd,
only the anguished groan of the visiting coach. The
reason? This is Forbes Field, but these are not the Pirates
who have just won the game, they are the Panther base-
ball team, and there is no crowd, only a smattering of
ha1f—hearted spectators.

It is unfortunate that the Panthers did not have more
fans this season, for the baseball team’s record was one
of the few winning seasons that Pitt athletic teams have
achieved this year. The 11-5 mark was produced in great
by the hitting of Corky Cuthbert and Al Riccuti, and by
the standout pitching of Jim Sylvis. Also standouts on the
mound staﬁ" were John Carlisle and Andy Alex.

The Panthers can look forward to an even better season
next year, since only three men will be lost from the team.
Drew Williamson, Ralph Shutterly, and Larry Carra are
the only members of the Panther nine that will be lost
through graduation. The experience gained this year by
the rest of the players should prove invaluable when the
Panthers take to the field next season.

After a touchdown run at a football game, at a
groundbreaking ceremony, at Fall Convocation,
all eyes turn to Chancellor Litchﬁeld. For the stu-
dents, Dr. Litchﬁeld is a source of pride. They
point out the Student Union, the dormitories, and
science buildings—new on campus since “the
Chancellor came.” They talk of new faculty mem-
bers and the plans for the library. Showing visitors
to Pitt the scale model of the campus, they discuss
Pitt including the huge swimming pool on top of
the hill and the quadrangle to be built on Forbes
Street.

But it is not only students who are speaking with
pride about Dr. Litchﬁeld and the University.
With the announcement of the Oakland Corpora-
tion all Pittsburgh is talking about the educational
and cultural center initiated by Dr. Litchﬁeld. Civ-
ic, political, and educational leaders will join
forces with Pitt to make Oakland a center of
achievement in the arts and sciences.

Chancellor Litchﬁeld is the ﬁrst to explain that
these ideas and their accomplishment do not stem
from him alone, but are the result of the knowl-
edge and interest of the members of the Board of
Trustees. Coming as they do from various parts of
the country and from a variety of professions, the
trustees give to the University the beneﬁt of their
experience. Leaders in their own ﬁelds, they con-
tribute well thought—out decisions.

Interplay of forceful leadership and fresh thoughts , ., _ _ 
concerning education characterize Chancellor Ed- I A H A

ward H. Litchﬁeld and the Board of Trustees at D11 Edward H- Lltchﬁeld
the University of Pittsburgh. Together they have Chancellor

begun to create a new Pitt.

In the vast stone structure of the Cathe-
dral, in the empty halls of the dormitory,
or in the crowd of the Tuck Shop a stu-
dent can be almost overcome by loneliness
or the vastness of his problems. It’s at
times like this that being able to sit on
the sofa in Dean Rush’s office and pour
out your heart means most. Often she
doesn’t offer much conversation and
gives only a minimum of advice, but
there is always plenty of tea and some
fresh brownies from Clara’s kitchen.
Whether it’s Clara’s cooking or Dean
Rush’s listening, the world usually seems
much brighter to a girl after her talk.

The “open—door” policy of the adminis-
tration includes the oﬁice of the Vice-
Chancellor of Student Affairs. Dr. Ran-
kin, like Dr. Crafts and Miss Rush en-
courages students to discuss Pitt with
him. Making Pitt a better place for stu-
dents is important to Dr. Rankin and
student suggestions help him to make the
decisions which eﬂect everyone.

For men and women alike, Dean Crafts
OﬂlC€ offers services of every kind. As in
Dean Rush’s ofﬁce, the student is no
longer a number. He is remembered by
everyone, from the secretaries to Dean
Crafts. A quick phone call from the
Dean’s oﬂice can straighten out most of
the red—tape problems that plague stu-
dents in a large university.

REQUIRES DEVOTION AND SKILL

In the classrooms of the School of Education this year, girls with
button-down shirts and boys with white collars barely above the
tops of their crew—neck sweaters prepare lesson plans. Here they
learn how to make school work interesting for their future students.
When these students graduate and stand in front of their own class-
rooms, the button down blouses and crew neck sweaters will
change to wool dresses and business suits, but their aim of mak-
ing school work interesting for their students will be the same.

The ﬁnal step in preparing an education major for teaching is the
period when a Senior in the School of Education teaches under the
supervision of an experienced teacher in our public school system.
This is the opportunity when the student teacher ﬁrst uses his les-
son plans that were written during the early hours of many morn-
ings and his teaching skills that were acquired through four tri-
mesters of hard work from studying psychology to learning to play
a little tin ﬂute.

Always under the watchful eyes of students and their parents, the
experienced teacher, as well as the student teacher, must be a
paragon of virtue to gain the respect of the community. He must
not only teach, but must also be a disciplinarian and counselor to
his students during the school hours of every day.

AFTER A DAY crammed with classes and laboratories, a
student engineer wearily returns to his locker in Engineering
Hall to select the books and equipment that he will need to
prepare tomorrow’s assignments.

BUSY SCHEDULES PREDOMINATE

The student who is enrolled in the University of Pittsburgh’s School
of Engineering and Mines soon learns that becoming an engineer
is no easy task. He is burdened with endless assignments, intro-
duced to the intricacies of the slide rule, spends interminable hours
in laboratories, and is expected to have an immediate answer when
a thermodynamics instructor snaps at him, “Deﬁne an adiabatic
process as related to Clausius’ statement of the Second Law.” The
engineer also learns to utilize every spare moment in the day. He
solves physics problems on his lunch hour, works on a diﬂicult
question in kinematics during the evening, and ﬁnds that the ten
minutes between classes is an excellent time to discuss differential
equations with one of his classmates.

To balance the many technical courses in his curriculum, the engi-
neer takes courses in the Humanities. Literature, writing, and po-
litical science prepare the engineering student to take his place in
the community. Such courses as these have made the Pitt engineer
realize that there are other things to be studied besides camshaft
design and integral calculus. Although the student engineer may
complain at times about the pressure he is under and the addi-
tional courses he is required to include in his curriculum, he real-
izes that it all is necessary in order to prepare him for his entrance
into the modern world.

AT A LONG LAB TABLE in a room smelling of formaldehyde, a student piths a frog,
then dissects it on a wax-lined tray to study its intestines, heart and liver.

     

 

WIDE STUDY WITH SPECIALIZATION

“Liberal education,” as deﬁned by the school’s bulletin, “frees the
minds of men and women from the limitations of the immediate.”
However, during his undergraduate years, a student’s mind is kept
something less than free due to never—ending exams and papers.
Freshmen and sophomores taking chemistry mutter memorized
formulas as they walk to class. Over their morning coffee students
conjugate irregular French verbs. Gazing at diagrams of a dissected
frog they try to remember if the instructor said the blue lines were
Veins or arteries. For an entire evening they struggle with the Eu-
clidean theory or search for a subject for this week’s English theme.
Juniors in the School of Liberal Arts groan at the length of the re-
quired reading lists handed out by their professors. But they read
them all including Franny and Zooey before the term is ﬁnished.
Around the middle of the term juniors all but live at the library as
they work on the four term papers that somehow fell due in the same .
week.

Seniors’ minds are no less free “from the limitations of the imme-
diate.” They try to cram all they can into this last precious year.
Having completed the survey courses, they go on to specialize. It
is by this learning in depth that the student ﬁnds the key to seeing
life in perspective.

velocity and momentum that are encountered in the study of rockets. Dr. Biondi explains
these problems to a physics class.

STUDENTS SOON LEARN

AN ISOLATED CLASSROOM at the end of a long corridor in Scaife Hall affords the best
opportunity for students to ﬁnd the solution to a technical lab problem.

NECESSARY DUTIES

Instructors acting as patients observe the bedside manner of the
student nurse. But it is her long—suffering lab partner who is on the
receiving end of practice hypodermic needles. Administering “hypos”
to oranges and lab partners is easy compared to the day when the
student nurse calmly administers one to a patient. But it isn’t long
before she is giving shots and carrying pill trays like a professional.
Having learned the fundamentals of care for the hospitalized pa-
tient, the student nurse begins her work in the hospitals afﬁliated
with Pitt’s School of Nursing. It is here she learns the aspects of
her profession not taught in a classroom. At Children’s Hospital
she sees the effect of the walls painted with colorful scenes from
nursery rhymes. As she wheels the children up and down the cor-
ridors of the hospital, she watches their faces brighten as they see
tropical birds in their fancy cages along the walls. She also learns
to con children into taking shots by telling them that she is a per-
sonal acquaintance of Santa Claus.

Not all of the nurse’s training takes place in the hospital. Classes
on the hill at Scaife Hall give the nurse the ‘necessary background
in anatomy, chemistry, and psychology. At meals in the Residence,
the student nurse discusses her patients, her instructors, and her
exams with her fellow students.

Evenings are devoted to memorizing formulas, writing up experi-

DID THE DOCTOR SAY one pill or two? I better get three
ments, and studying for exams that are a part of almost every day. to be on the safe side.

Learning became an everyday task. Almost
automatically, students aimed themselves for the
classroom and the morning’s first lecture. Once

settled, the student created a challenge for himself.

He decided not to look at his watch until the professor
had cleared his throat twenty-ﬁve times. Still, time
dragged and it remained twenty minutes past the hour

for at least f0rty—ﬁve minutes. At last the chimes rang,
notebooks snapped shut, and there was a rush for the
Tuck Shop before the next chime and another droning
lecture. The monotony of note-taking was regularly broken
by exams. Crowds gathered early around the door to the
classroom. Discussion centered around what the questions
might possibly be and how much each student didn’t

get a chance to read. In this time of crisis, students who
sat whole aisles apart were driven to speak to each other.
The concensus of opinion was that no one knew anything
and that the professor was impossible. The long day of
classes ﬁnished, students bent over books in the library,
silent except for the librarian’s explosive Shhhhhhhhhh.

PARTNERSHIP

ALTHOUGH HIS LABORATORY HOURS are rushed and confused,
the student still ﬁnds time to discuss subjects other than the chemical
properties of a given solution. However, concentration is a necessity if
he is to ﬁnish his experiment in the assigned period.

WITH MEDICINE

Classes in the School of Pharmacy are small. Students
have the beneﬁt of a close relationship with some of
the ﬁnest teachers in the ﬁelds of pharmacology, pharma-
cognosy, and toxicology.

The pharmacy student applies the knowledge that he has
received from a faculty of academic and professional ex-
cellence in the laboratory. Using modern equipment, the
student acquires the skill and patience necessary for a
member of the modern health team in our society. In the
laboratory the student learns to weigh and measure with
perfect precision. Through the efforts of the School, the
student realizes that his work is a valuable aid to his part-
ner—the medical profession.

Despite rushed days of memorizing formulas, taking notes
in classroom lectures, and sessions with the microscope in
the laboratory, the pharmacy student manages to look neat
in his white shirt and tie. His white coat may be rumpled
at the end of the day, but it has served its purpose of mak-
ing the pharmacy student look, as well as feel, professional.

To supplement class work the Pharmacy Department
plans visits to large drug corporations to observe the man-

CLINIC PROVIDES EXPERIENCE

Although the Dental School is comparatively small, it
manages to bustle with the same activity as the other
schools of the University. With an added inﬂux of sopho-
more students and the television method of instruction,
the building on the hill is a world in itself. The size of the
school permits the close student contacts necessary to form
good professional men. Classroom discussions expand into
bull sessions at the Luna. Here the “dents” compare notes
on everything from the prosthetics exam to the develop-
mental grooves of the gal they met at the dent party the
night before.

Students of Dentistry spend long hours in classes studying
physiology, radiology, and other courses. In laboratories
practical experience is gained manipulating the tools and
in constructing impressions of the mouth, preparing the
student for his future practice.

The dental student remembers well his ﬁrst day at the
clinic when he assumed an air of professional assurance,
yet felt inner qualms as his clinical instructor, expecting
perfection, quietly guided and inspected his work. At ﬁrst,
the instructor stayed close to the elbow of the student, al-
ways ready to give his advice or assistance if it should be
needed. As the student gained conﬁdence, he did more of
the clinical work on his own. For though there was always
a professional dentist at hand, the dental student came to
realize that his patients in the clinic had faith in his ability.
To be worthy of this faith he realizes he must put forth his
very best work.

business administration

TRAINS FUTURE EXECUTIVES

Students in the School of Business Administration set up
make-believe corporations. As members of the board of
directors of a ﬁctitious business, they decide on ﬁscal and
personnel policies. Acquiring skilled employees, dealing
with unions, and deciding on an adequate insurance pro-
gram are reported in long papers. Floor plans for a busi-
ness oﬂice on six foot sheets of paper are submitted in
classes of personnel management.

In the business administration major’s notebook of bal-
ance sheets and ledger paper, careful records are kept of
the imaginary proﬁts and losses of the Acme or Jones
Company. Their problems of overhead, interest, debits,
and credits, become the problems the students must solve.
The business administration major can be seen carrying
heavy books on money and banking or reading a copy of
THE ORGANIZATION MAN.

Real business also comes in for close scrutiny. Dressed in
his best grey suit with a white shirt and conservative tie,
the business administration major spends several days
downtown observing the advertising department at
Horne’s or the accounting section at U. S. Steel.

Interviews are of immense importance to the business ad-
ministration major. He soon learns to handle interviews
and the battery of employment tests with ease.

EXERCISING PATIENCE

Education requires patience, and no one knows this better than the
law student. After completing four years as an undergraduate, he
watches his classmates preparing for graduation while he looks for-
ward to three years of law school.

After the ﬁrst few months, he becomes accustomed to wearing a
collar and tie six days a week. He carries books of tremendous
size, musty volumes that he would swear have not been opened in
ﬁfty years. While riding the elevators up to his classes or the law
library, he bumps the other passengers’ legs with a bulging brief-
case that threatens to split open at any moment.

Because the University of Pittsburgh Law Library is for use at the
student’s own discretion, the assignments by the faculty are pro-
portionately lengthy and difficult. In order to compensate for these
increased assignments, the law students divide themselves into
groups of three or four men, each member of the team completing
one portion of the assignment.

Above all, the law student must learn to exercise patience, for since
judicial processes, as well as educational processes, require patience,
he may one day ﬁnd it necessary to instill this quality in one of his
clients.

INDIVIDUAL QUESTIONS concerning taxation often
require more time than the hour allotted to a class.

WORK IN LOCAL HOSPITALS

One of the greatest thrills in a medical student’s life
comes when someone other than the elevator operator
calls him “Doctor.” It gives him a feeling of pride and sat-
isfaction, along with a sense of responsibility. He knows
that his patients are depending on the skill and knowledge
that he has acquired in his four years of medical training.

During these four years, the medical student learns the
principles and techniques that will become burned into his
memory. He learns anatomy by dissecting a cadaver,
which before long begins to smell like a garbage can.
Touring Presbyterian, Children’s, Magee, and other hospi-
tals gives him a chance to learn the practical side of
medicine. He is asked to make a diagnosis of a patient in
one of the wards and then compare it with the ﬁndings of
the resident physician. His ego is considerably deﬂated
when he discovers that he has mistaken viral hepatitis for
duodenal ulcer. He also learns to diagnose illnesses
through the use of x-ray pictures, and memorizes the
name, position, and function of every bone in the human
skeleton.

DIAGRAMS OF ARTERIAL PATHS, pictures of bone
structure, and long articles on disease syndromes keep medical
students in the library long after their classes have ended.

graduate school of social work

The Graduate School of Social Work at the Uni-
versity ranks high among the schools in its ﬁeld.
Students, who have already received a degree in
one of the social sciences, are trained further in
the ﬁeld of community work. Each student ac-
companies professional workers in one of the
local health and social agencies, and together
they try to solve the problems that place emo-
tional strains on the community. On his trips with
the professional agent, he receives an insight into
a side of life that may be entirely unfamiliar to
him.

The “Pittsburgh Renaissance” presents a unique
challenge to social workers. New housing oppor-
tunities are one important result of slum clear-
ances. Families to be resettled must be assured
that the move will be beneﬁcial. Tactful intro-
ductions to new neighbors and a new way of life
must be handled carefully by the social worker.
Relocating small businesses is particularly diffi-
cult. The owners of the candy stores, bake shops,
and the neighborhood groceries must go into busi-
ness in an area where such services are already
established. Often the relocated owners must
learn a new trade. Finding training and jobs for
them often means contacting businessmen and
employment agencies throughout the city. Seeing
these men and their families settled in a new
home adequate to their needs is a great satis-
faction to the social worker.

odk man of the year

Usually, the obligations that are placed upon a married man who
is attending college prevent his engaging in many University ac-
tivities, both academic and extracurricular. But this year’s Senior
Awardee, Richard Johnston, is exceptional. In his nine terms at
the University, he completed the requirements for two Bachelor
of Science degrees—one in mathematics and the other in mechan-
ical engineering with the aeronautical option—both with outstand-
ing grade averages.

In addition to earning two degrees, he was active in the student
publications ﬁeld, serving as president of Pi Delta Epsilon and
vice president of the Pitt Foto Club. He also held almost every
position on the staff of the Skyscraper Engineer, including the
post of managing editor. Though busy with these activities, he
also found time to be vice—president of the American Rocket
Society.

Richard Johnston deserves to be congratulated on the fulﬁllment
of his duties to his family and the University. By means of con-
gratulation, he has been given the University’s highest honor——
the Omicron Delta Kappa Senior Award.

A dark-skinned woman seemed to ﬂoat across Fifth

quiet, dark man sat in the Tuck Shop, glancing over
documents from the business research department,
while a perpetually smiling Chinese boy crossed
Forbes on the way to his chemistry lab. The freshman
English major from Lower Turkey Foot quickly
became friendly with the Laotian boy who sat next to
him in lecture, and undergraduates soon became
accustomed to having their laboratory sections
supervised by an Egyptian girl or a young South
African. They are an accepted part of University life,
and when local students pass them on the street, there
is no glare of resentment—only a look of recognition.

mr. and miss pitt

Mister and Miss Pitt are the out-
standing members of the gradu-
ating class. To be worthy of this
honor, the awardees must be
more than activities majors and
not merely habitues of the li-
brary. Mr. Pitt, William Hosick,
and Miss Pitt, Ina Amdur, have
managed to combine the best of
both qualiﬁcations.

Despite the almost full-time job
of being Business Manager for
SKYSCRAPER ENGINEER,
the monthly engineering maga-
zine, Bill also attended meetings
of Omicron Delta Kappa, Dru-
ids, Pi Delta Epsilon, and Alpha
Phi Omega. Equally active, Ina
Amdur has also contributed out-
standingly to publications. As a
PITT NEWS columnist for four
years and Associate Editor of
IDEAS AND FIGURES, Ina
has demonstrated literary ability.

But activities alone do not make
an individual worthy of being
named Mister or Miss Pitt. To
this man and woman, the under-
graduates look for leadership in
academic excellence. In Bill Hos-
ick and Ina Amdur this leader-
ship has been realized. Not only
are they outstanding scholars,
both having been named to Phi
Beta Kappa, but through their
work in honoraries and the ex-
ample they have set in the class-
room, they have created a high
intellectual standard.

What makes one student stand
head and shoulders above the
rest of his class? Call it intelli-
gence, drive, ambition, or what
you will, it is an intangible qual-
ity that cannot be measured in
terms of Q.P.A. It is this un-
known factor which is repre-
sented in the OWL Hall of Fame.

These are the students who are
not merely members of organiza-
tions; they are the ones who as-
sume chairmanships, who take
on the not—so—g1amorous jobs,
who are elected president. Yet,
in the midst of all this imposed
responsibility, they maintain top
grades.

You meet these people every day.
They pass you in the halls while
on their way to an S. G. meeting
and ride with you on the Student

It is the hope of the faculty mem-
bers and students who selected

aware of the invisible quality that
distinguishes one person from the

Athletic Committee

Each year, there is one senior athlete
who, in his four years at the University,
has compiled the best all—around record.
He has excelled in athletic ability, has
had the best attitude toward athletics,
and has managed to keep a respectable
grade average. In the spring, this man
is presented the Athletic Committee
Award for his outstanding achievement.
Anthony Sarsﬁeld, this year’s winner,
justly deserves the most coveted of all
athletic awards.

In his junior year, he was a standout on
the swimming team. As a member of the
squad, which was the fastest in the history
of the University, he broke records in
the 100 and 200—yard butterﬂy division,
and was a member of the freestyle relay
team that broke the record by more than
three seconds. While a senior, he con-
tinued to turn in the ﬁne performances
that helped to win for him the Athletic
Committee Award.

Hartwig Award

This year’s Hartwig Award went to Reed
Clarke. The award is presented annually
to the senior athlete who has done the
most to promote, sponsor, and create in-
terest in athletics, and Mr. Clarke was
judged to be the athlete most worthy of
this honor. While he was a member of
the track team, and excelling in the
hammer throw, he also competed on
the cross—country squad. During his j11'l’1—
ior year for the cross—country runners, he
was co—captain, and was one of the top
runners on the squad. Coach Carl Rees
was optimistic about his chances for the
future and felt that Mr. Clarke had the
ability and ambition to develop into one
of Pitt’s all—time greats.

As a senior, he continued as a member
of the track team and helped to keep up
the pace. His teammates learned that
they could expect his usual all—out eﬁort
in the meets, one of the many reasons
that Reed Clarke received this year’s
Hartwig Award.

Washing machines and driers which
worked only when there wasn’t a quarter
to be found and elevators which always
broke down in pairs ﬁlled life with
interest and exercise for the resident
student. They ran to Yohe’s for all

the things that would have been in the
medicine chest or kitchen cupboard

at home. But the discomforts of living in
a dormitory were made worthwhile by
shared care-packages of kolbassi, bull
sessions and shared problems, a friend
from India, and being able to borrow
clothes for every occasion.

An alarm clock rang and the
commuter’s day had begun. As he took
his books from the desk, the problems
of traveling several miles to the
University occupied his mind. “Wonder
if the battery’s still got enough juice to
start the car?” “I suppose that stinkin’
bus will be late again today.”

“Will I make my eight o’clock?” These
were the pitfalls that everyone who didn’t
live on campus had to face. Traveling
was bad enough under clear skies, but
became horrendous when the snow

fell. There were no parking places
whatsoever, trolleys were hours late,
and the commuter arrived at his class
only to discover that it had been
cancelled because not enough dorm
students had shown up to make
teaching worthwhile.

there is a
right future
in foods

. . . and this new Heinz Research Center stands as a promise of the growing world leader-
ship of H. J. Heinz Company in the ﬁeld of food processing.

Located in Pittsburgh, on the north bank of the Allegheny, it is the hub of the Heinz inter-
national operation. In its ultramodern laboratories, test kitchens and pilot plant, new prod-
ucts are born, new packaging ideas conceived, new methods of factory processing formu-
lated.

Here research in the ﬁeld of nutrition is carried on—to be translated into more healthful,
as well as more ﬂavorful, foods for infants and adults. Here, with scientiﬁc exactness, the
high standards of the 57 Varieties are rigidly guarded.

With facilities of this most modern Research Center-—-and with its staff of talented, well-
trained personnel-—pointing the way toward an even more effective production of quality
foods, Heinz looks with conﬁdence to the future.

H. J. Heinz Company wishes for each of you a bright future ﬁlled with challenge, fulﬁll-
ment and just reward. ‘

Gregarious by nature, the Greek never travels alone.
He eats with his friends, sleeps in the House, and
drinks with them at the Luna. He seldom studies
without company; instead of going to the library or
the Commons Room, he saves his assignments for the
evening, when he can have a study session with

either his brothers or a co—ed. His daytime hours,
except for the classes that he occasionally attends,
are spent in the Tuck Shop. This symbol of Greek
unity becomes, during the noon hour, a crowded
sweatbox full of shouting, loudly laughing men and
giggling co—eds. But the Tuck Shop is not only a place
to congregate with one’s friends; it is a place to decide
important questions and discuss serious problems.
“Who are you bringing to the Formal?” “How was
your trip to Europe?” “Can you make the party
Saturday night? It’s B.Y.0.” “Well. after we left

the Tender Trap we went to the Pink Cloud. . .”

DONALD J. MESSINGER

To the casual reader a yearbook is often simply an
“album” of pictures with accompanying identi-
ﬁcations and enough written text to ﬁll up the re-
maining holes on the pages. Merely ink on paper
. . . though nice to own and enjoy.

But to the staff and the adviser the yearbook
means much more. For yearbook work comprises
a multitude of details: Layout, Art, Photography,
Copy, Typography, Covers and Binding (not to
mention the small detail of money—raising).
Highly technical and often confusing, these details
are at the very least time—consuming and a source
of anxiety to a staff unless the publisher’s repre-
sentative is company—trained to give needed help
and suggestions.

All representatives for Wm. J. Keller Inc. are
skilled in the many facets of yearbook work, hav-
ing at their ﬁnger—tips the answers to yearbook
problems as well as a multitude of ideas for new
graphic arts special effects, to enable the staff to
produce a yearbook that is different and attractive.
Your Keller salesman is more than a technical ad-

viser, he is a “clearing-house” of yearbook ideas.

Shivers of fear ran through the Greeks on the
ﬁrst day of rush season. They knew that, for the
next ten days, they would have to keep the best
side of their organization turned toward the
rushees. And they were not mistaken. Rush was
ten days of lunches at the House, ten nights of
staying up until three in the morning, phoning
rushees and making party arrangements, and
ten days and nights when every conscious
moment was spent smiling, smiling, smiling. The
rushees welcomed the V.l.P. treatment,

Some were impressed and picked up their bids,
while others decided to remain in the dorms.

“LET’S G0 PITT, L,_ET’S G0 PITT!”
These sounds reverberated every Friday

a evening before a football game, as the

cheerleaders, the Varsity Marching
Band, a handful of disinterested dorm
students and tons of bathroom tissue
ﬁlled the Quadrangle and attempted to
spur our team to victory. Most were
content to remain in their rooms and
observe the spectacle from above.
Along with weekly lessons on tumbling
and stumbling by the Pitt Panther, these
rallies were highlighted by a huge
bonﬁre in nearby Bubbles Field and by a

- surprise appearance and pep talk by the

Chancellor.

In the fall, student conversation
centered around football. Our
chances of winning under the
circumstances, what mixes well
with coke, and Johnny M ichelosen
were the primary points of
interest. At the games, the student
section took an active interest in the
band, the coke vendor, the
Sammies’ latest trick, happenings
in the Chancellor’s booth, and
sometimes they even watched

the game.

It was November and it was cold.
Dipping newspaper strips into basins
of lumpy paste and then smoothing the
strips on the chicken-wire ﬁgures in
front of the fraternity houses kept
Greeks out of bed and classes days
before the house-front judging. Recent
alums begged students to get tickets or
ID’s for them the day before the game.
Queen candidates prayed that the
wind would stop blowing for just a
few minutes as their sorority sisters
sprayed one last can of spray net on
their lovely coiﬁures. Alums and
students shivered in wool coats and
muttered about planners who set
Homecoming for November. But all
discomforts were forgotten in the wild
cheering for the Homecoming victory.

The two—party system on the campus broke into three parts this year.

Always there had been two kinds.‘ dancing parties and talking parties.
This year a third type came into being. The twist took over. Couples
no longer talked. They couldn’t make themselves heard above
Chubby Checker. Togetherness on the dance floor was “out” as
couples swung their arms like windmills in front of them to be sure

a maximum of space was kept constantly between them.

1-~
There did come a time when classes were over for the day.

To relieve the strain and monotony of daily studying, the

bleary—eyed undergraduate turned to recreation. The process of
soothing the edges roughened by strain and rebuilding the shattered
nervous system took many forms. The more cultural—minded bought
tickets to the Pittsburgh Symphony or the Playhouse, the athletes
picked up a softball game at the Oval, and the socially—oriented
students hoped that their troubles could not swim. But not all the time
outside of class was spent in recreation, for a chance had to be found
to renew and strengthen friendships, and to ask the question,

“What does it all mean? Where do I ﬁt?” Often, ﬁfteen minutes spent
over a cup of coffee with an instructor helped a student renew his
faith in himself far more than any softball game. And an hour spent
alone in a quiet corner, contemplating and sifting personal values and
dreams, was sometimes a greater aid in forming a decision

that would affect the position and career of the future than an evening
spent in the local pub. Even the simple act of meeting friends between
classes or for lunch served to freshen life by adding a new opinion,

a new bit of knowledge, a new perspective.

 

  NO
PARKINGi
  AFTER
  6P.M.
The Pirate fans arrived in
Oakland again, taking peace and
parking places away from the
irritated student. He was unable
to walk from class to class without
tramping on the toes of baseball
fans carrying cushions, coolers, and
cans of beer. He also had to keep
a wary eye on the policeman
gazing at his car in the No
Parking zone.

Silently the day slips away as lights gleam on down
the avenue and lonely men desert their solitary seats
in the park. The shelter of night hides these men as
they seek the companionship of other lonely ones in
the corner bar and plight their problems. Hands
intertwined, couples stroll to the theater and sit for a
few hours in forgetful trances. Later they may share
a pizza, but above all, they have something to share;
they have each other; the lonelies have nothing save

a sandwich and an empty glass.

The Oakland eating places were as diversiﬁed as the students
themselves. Across Forbes Avenue, a swank restaurant charged four
dollars plus tip for a meager, but well—cooked lunch. A few blocks
away, a price war made it possible to buy a hamburger for twelve
cents. The Tuck Shop was the place to pull a sandwich out of a
brown bag or buy an underdone hot dot in the turtle’s-pace Speed
Line, and the cafeteria oﬁered appealing menus, soothing music,
and quantity, not quality. For the students with smaller appetites, the
liquid lunch provided all necessary nourishment. It was M etrecal
bought at the grocery or Miller’s High Life bought in Frankie’s.

The year is gone, but it
remains to be recaptured
in the ﬂash of
remembering. . . gray
gothic stone . . . a
familiar face.

It was an unusually mild winter, but
the high—spirited students managed to
take advantage of every snowﬂake.
They pelted each other, passers—by,
co-eds, and an occasional policeman.
They smiled when a girl lifted her skirt
to step over a drift, and laughed out
loud when an instructor made a one-
point landing on the icy sidewalk. A
few forlorn snowmen were rolled together
on the lawns, but they soon melted into

sooty lumps under the warm sun

that quickly followed the snow. Then
came the slush. It formed deep pools

at the corner of Fifth and B igelow,
spattered clothes, and dripped from damp
shoes onto classroom floors.

Reclining in the hard wooden seats of

the Field House, watching a close
basketball game or two straining wrestlers,
students found a way to shake the
occupational disease of the college
student—middle-of-the—week jitters.

The climb up the Hill in the chill

evening air provided a pleasant break

for those who could spare the time. At

the Field House, there was

companionship and a friendly atmosphere,
whether the team won or lost. And
afterward, there was the second-

guessing or the walk down the Hill with

The continuous flow of students
from the Cathedral to the Student
Union on Wednesdays at noon
stopped all traﬂic on Bigelow
Boulevard. Most of the

students were hurrying to the
ballroom to spend their lunch
hour listening to a lecture.
Vercours’s “The A esthetics of
Revolt” and The Fine Arts Quartet
appealed to some. Scriven’s
“There is No God” and Ogden
Nash appealed to many. In the
evenings speakers lost their appeal
and music won the masses.
Mournful folksongs about lemon
trees and chain gangs brought
students close to the earth.

The lobby of the Student Union was a convenient
spot ta. lounge and listen to the music ﬂoating in
on the loudspeakers. But the Union was like a
duck: calm and urzrufﬂed on the surface, but
paddling like the devil underneath. There were
reservations made for riverboat cruises and

room schedules drawn up for the

innumerable organizations that use the Student
Union as a meeting place. For many

people, the Union was home; they lived on its

upper floors, ate in its cafeteria, and .mc'ializecl
in the Hunt Room.

Anything that looked like fun and
was like work qualiﬁed as an
activity. Those people on the
stage seemed to be having such fun.
Debaters made glamorous trips.
The whole stadium cheered when
the band marched in their
immaculate uniforms. Only those
who were in a Player’s production
remembered the 2 a.m. technicals,
memorizing scripts, and the
discouragement of a bad
characterization. Hours of
detailed research and 5 a.m.
departures made Debate trips
something less than glamorous.
Mud was splattered over the smart
band uniforms on rainy days.
Being in activities was worth it,

of course, not for the glamour,

but for the close friendships that were
the result of working together.

The slogan of the year on the publications floor was,
“Let’s play Scrabble with the ﬂoor directory.” No one
ever confessed to the crime, but somehow a letter was
always missing from “Rothman.” Aside from this
single joint activity, the diﬂerent publications kept
their separate characters. The Pitt News formed a
Glee Club, the Skyscraper “slipped its stick,” and the
Owl never slept.

At Tap Day, Nate Firestone spoke about pin-polishing
and the role of the student leader on the campus.

The honored ones and a few hopefuls nodded

their heads and clapped in agreement. For some, the
challenge of being an intellectual, responsible leader
came too late. For others, a long summer would wash
from the memory the words that fired their minds
thatMarch evening. Perhaps a few heard the call,
remembered it, and when September rolls around,
some real intellectual leaders may step forward,

ready to take on the responsibility that awaits them.
More likely, there will come another Tap Day and
perhaps another student speaker who will see and
express the problem, and another group of pin-polishers
who will hear and forget.

St. Paddy’s Day drew near, and the engineers dusted oﬁ their green
derbies. On the ﬁrst day of Engineer’s Week, the man in the green
suit arrived on an air car that whooshed down Bigelow Boulevard
like an oversized vacuum cleaner. Patrick, the patron saint of the
engineers, was there and the ancient rites got underway. There was
the gimmick——an art contest. There were the displays—missiles,
rockets, missiles. The displays contained the annual bugs——some
exploded and some refused to respond to the demonstrator’s
controls. The week ﬂew by as classes were cut and assignments

neglected, culminating in the Shamrock Ball.

For some, Convocation reawakened awareness of the past, pride
in the University and its faculty, and presented an opportunity
to hear Dr. Litchﬁeld and see Gladys Schmidt get an honorary

degree. The long line of black-robed men and women with their
colorful hoods was a tradition which somehow was always
newly exciting for those students who took time to watch. Many
could not take the time for this procession of tradition. For
them, Convocation was a morning without classes.

Two days every week, the lawn was

turned into a parade ground for a

display of military power. Each Wednesday
was Air Force day, and the grounds were
studded with blue formations chanting
their cadences. The following days, the
Army arrived in Thursday green. The only
spectators to the weekly drills were a few
ROTC students who had forgotten their
uniforms and those who enjoyed sitting
outside. The drills themselves were a
never—ending show of polished brass,
sparkling shoes, and occasional out-of-
step marchers.

A cigarette gripped nervously
in a shaking hand, a hastily
gulped cup of coﬁee, and an
empty box of N o-Doz
symbolized ﬁnals week. There
was the ever—present gasp of
panic whenever an instructor
scribbled on a blackboard,
“Five minutes to go.” As exam
hours ended, the halls were
jammed; a few of the students
ﬂipped through textbooks to
check their answers, but most
wore a blank, stunned face.

Finals were over and it was time to
leave. The Quadrangle was jammed
with cars, a ﬁfteen hundred
dormitory residents all tried to
leave at the same time. A place
had to be found in the trunk for a
giant teddy bear, the bicycle

had to be lashed to the roof top
where it would scratch the paint,
and books were ﬁtted in where-
ever there was a cubic inch to
spare, as students took home
double the amount they had
brought with them.

The mental weariness was
washed away by a week-end of
sleep, as those with a season of
relaxation before them thought
of the coming parties and days at
the beach. At the same time, one-
fourth of the students thought,
“Why did I register for the
summer trimester?”

 

The sun grew hot and the air became humid early in
the third—trimester. The asphalt on B igelow turned
soft underfoot, and the sight of students sunbathing
as they studied became commonplace. The general
atmosphere metamorphosed into a more casual
classroom relationship, but not so casual that it was
possible to turn in a paper a week late because of

a picnic.

This is Pitt.... its people, its
For the graduating senior the end had

come. The bright, triangular bunting and

the folding chairs on the lawn were there

for him. Those proud faces and eager

photographers were his relatives and

friends. Somehow, it didn’t seem possible

that he had done it——he had graduated.

\ Nor did he quite believe that life on the
 campus would be the same without him
i and his classmates. But this chapter of
his life had ended and the time had come

to go on.

The lot of the male members of the
OWL staff would be a sad one indeed if
it were not for the Owlettes. When a
stalf—member comes straggling into the
oﬂice, his mind heavy with academic
problems, he receives a welcome lift at
the sight of a pretty face bent over a
typewriter or busily counting OWL sales
slips. During the long evenings, the Owl-
ettes provide pleasant conversation as
they type out copy and listen to the
Brothers Four or Rachmaninoff on the
hi-ﬁ.

Whether selling ads, preparing a patron
list, running down to the Hunt Room for
ten cherry cokes and a Lemon Blennd,
or cleaning off Bill’s desk for Publica-
tion’s Day, the Owlettes make the job of
putting out a yearbook as painless as
possible. An Owlette is the girl who con-
tributes Johnny Mathis records to the
office collection, who laughs at G1enn’s
joke no matter how often she’s heard it,
who sympathizes with Jerry’s academic
struggles and who admires all of Stan’s
photos.

The Owlettes are helpmates, part of the
staff yet something more, something
special.

organizations

Any organization has something to offer the mem-
ber. For the Greek, there is a sense of sharing
and brotherhood, and for the professional there
is a constant learning and renewing of that which
was known but lost. In belonging to an organiza—
tion one accepts the responsibilities and the duties
of that grouping. There is work to be done before
any of the pleasures can be indulged in. Even
after the fun there exists the. unpleasant task of
cleaning up. But this can be made enjoyable due
to the companionship that exists between mem-
bers.

There is a sense of pride that comes from know-
ing that it was your group that scheduled the best
speaker for the year and an equal sense of pride
in winning the trophy or prize in a rough compe-
tition. Each man and woman in the group is a
part of this pride and shares in it, for a good
organization comes from each member doing and
sharing in more than the pride. It comes from
each member sharing in the work to earn the
prize. This may involve friction and sweat, but
Organizations teach the student to cope with the
friction and to learn that there is no shame in
honest sweat. Arguments late at night over coffee
and decisions made on the spur of the moment are
all a part of the smooth functioning of an organ-
ization. They are a part of the long range plan-
ning that must be the base of any organizational
activity. To accept the responsibility and work of
a group and to know that you have given your
best may be the best rewards of the organizational
set-up on the Pitt campus.

The Pitt Greek is a man under pressure. Each
fall, on his return to school, he is urged by the of-
ﬁcers of his chapter and the alumni of his frater-
nity to rush, rush, rush. It means nights of tele-
phoning rushees, smiling, inviting them to the
house for lunch and a tour, smiling, arranging
dates, smiling, and making sure that they enjoy
themselves at the weekend parties. When the rush
season is ﬁnally over, all the fraternity man can
do is sink into» a chair and wearily await the pledge
lists, published by the Dean’s office, that will mean
life or death for his chapter.

The Greek at Pitt shares a camaraderie known to
few other students. He belongs, he is a member
of a group. He has a place to go in the Tuck Shop
and a group to study with in the library. Forming
friendships that will last a lifetime, he realizes that
there is something more to being a Greek than
just wearing a pin and repeating an oath at meet-
ings.

His organization will not be just a campus inter-
lude, but will come to pervade all aspects of his
life. Years after his graduation, when someone
asks about his college life, he will not answer, “I
was a. . .” but “I am a. . .”

ALPHA PHI ALPHA

“We Meet Again Tonight” to polish our trophies was the Alpha’s
theme song this year. At Greek Week they kept asking, “Are we
the only fraternity on this campus or what?” as they kept hauling in
those big trophies. At the end of Greek Week, the scholarship trophy,
the improvement trophy, and the sing cup were in the Alphas’ hands.
Then, the Alphas developed a passion for the twist. They weren’t
satisﬁed when Big Daddy won the Greek Twist Contest. Everybody
did the twist and the slop at the parties at the Hall, lubricated by 190
proof punch. The parties were wildly novel, especially that swinger
at the funeral parlor.

The Alphas and Jinxy Baby . . . letters from Ohio . . . the Babies
making the run down Route 19 . . . George and Lovelle discussing
the merits of student teaching at Schenley and Westinghouse . . .
Hitchcock still high at the Pitt Preview . . . those shades cover road
map eyes . . . one pledge taking on the whole fraternity at the Field
House . . . budget problems . . . Clavin and Bill and the trip to Na-
tional at Louisville on 15 cents . . . “Don’t hawk my girl Satur-
day night” . . . the letter from the Foreign Students Association . . .
green sandwiches for lunch . . . basketball is fun . . . “In the evening
come the brothers” to the football practice ﬁeld they once called
home.

DELTA SIGMA PHI

It was quite a year for the Delta Sigs. John Newell wielded
the gavel, singing “Moonlight Over Fox Chapel.” With
Homecoming, the ping-pong table traveled from the cellar
to the world of Mr. Magoo—love those Kappas and that
third place trophy! Chaos reigned with the outbreak of a
Leper colony on the second ﬂoor! “Unclean!” yelled “Hot
Dog.”

Honors! Honors! everywhere. Delta Sig led in campus
membership and copped ﬁrst place in IF basketball. John
Jenkins, famed receiver of two touchdowns, rated high on
the Dean’s List. One illustrious member of the chapter
swiped West Virginia’s trophies and sighed, “Guess you
win the Turkey!”

The Delta Sig’s new location gave them a chance to ex-
change pleasantries with their new neighbor. Don’t worry,
fellows, you’ll get used to him. How many windows were
broken in the Big Snowball Fight? It’s a good thing the
pledges were throwing from the porch roof. Hale’s cam—
paign for government and paper . . . Tony’s back . . .
what party? . . . going where? . . . Army! . . . dinner at
the Greeks . . . life is never dull . . . is it?
