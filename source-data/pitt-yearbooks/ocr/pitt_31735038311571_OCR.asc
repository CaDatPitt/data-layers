Nationality Rooms  

Many cultures are represented in the Cathedral

There’s no escaping it, or should I say
;hem? I guess you’re wondering what I
mi talking about. I’m talking about the
,\Iationality Rooms in the Cathedral of
Learning, of course.

The Nationality Rooms attract tour-
,sts from around the world, for they
represent different aspects of countries
around the world. Approximately thir-
ty thousand visitors take part in the
Quo Vadis tours, and almost twice that
number just tour the rooms on their

own volition.

You will ﬁnd that each room has its
own distinctive flavor of the country
that it represents. This is due in part to
the fact that the furniture in each room
is shipped directly from the country
that it represents, thus giving each
room that country’s ethnicity. Christ-
mas time is a special event for the Na-
tionality Rooms for they are decorated
according to their cultural customs.

It is a pleasure to have a class sched-

uled in one of these rooms, for a stu-
dent can escape into that country and
feel some of its culture permeating
their senses.

It is the diversity of these Nationality
Rooms that help to give Pitt its own
sense of diversity, for it absorbs the feel
and texture of so many different na-
tions.

Small class rooms add a personal
feel to Pitt life.

The Cathedral This is a lecture in an
English classroom.

PJ Disclafani

Here at Pitt, one can ﬁnd a diversity
iof classes. Ranging from those large
I cale classes where you could never
 even dream of meeting half the people,
E to the small classes where you have the
opportunity to get to know everyone on
a first name basis.

In my journey through Pitt, I have
encountered many of these types of
classes. It’s a big change from a Chem
class with over two hundred students to
a Lit class with only twenty.

Though, I would have to say that I
I like smaller classes better. Why? Be-
 cause I was able to meet a lot of new

   

i
i
;
i
;

  

friends. And in the classroom, we were
able to hold discussions, sometimes ar-
guments, about the subject matter at
hand that really stimulated my think-
ing. It was easier to interpret these new
ideas when I knew the person I was
talking to, not just some face in the
crowd. It is the small class which tends
to better the learning process, for the
students are able to relate to one an-
other and the instructor on a one to one
basis.

But, I do have to say that big classes
are nice too. Yet, it does seem like an
impersonal way of learning. Your pro-

Classrooms: The Size

fessor doesn’t even know who you are,
unless you go and visit him during of-
fice hours. It is really hard to discuss the
subject with so many students. When I
go to a class like this, it seems to me that
I mostly fall asleep, or into that phase
where I am about ready to lay my head
down on the nearest desk and catch
some zzzz’s. However, since I usually
end up sitting next to one of my friends,
they keep me awake by simply kicking
me a few times.

The Learning Skills Center

Where you

Did you ever wonder where people
were going when they got off the el-
evator on the third floor of the William
Pitt Union? What’s the big mystery sur-
rounding the third ﬂoor? Well, I found
out it’s the Learning Skills Center.

The Learning Skills Center is for
those students who wish to develop
more efﬁcient and effective ways of
studying. In order to do so, the Learn-
ing Skills Center offers Study Skills
Workshops, Individualized Study Skills,
various Study Skills Mini—Workshops,
and Study Skills Assessments.

Each year, the Learning Skills Center

teaching assistants will be.

can go for academic help

helps approximately two thousand stu-
dents. It has been found that Learning
Skills Center programs have been very
beneﬁcial to students, as well as staff
and faculty, due to the fact that their
instructional approaches and materials
have been speciﬁcally designed for the
diverse needs of the University pop-
ulation.

All programs incorporate models of
information processing and memory
theory which are based upon the idea
that studying involves taking in, ma-
nipulating, evaluating, storing, and uti-
lizing information. The Study Skills

Workshops help the student in learning
about general study skills which can
then be applied to any course material.

Learning Skills Center programs are
available to part-time and full-time stu-
dents of all majors, as well as staff and
faculty members of the University of
Pittsburgh. So, if you are ever in need
of some studying help, go and visit
those nice people on the third ﬂoor of
the William Pitt Union.

The Cost of Education

Don’t you hate it receiving that little
thing called your tuition bill? I know
that I do.

I mean after going through all the
stuff to get registered, meeting your
advisor, then that endless pursuit
through the courses selection cata-
logue, then coordinating the perfect
schedule. You feel pretty damn good
after getting everything you want the
way you want it, and then to be hit with
that little bill. Oops, did I say little? No
way — I didn’t mean that.

After saving up all summer, working
your butt off to get a decent looking
amount in your checking account, you
have to write out that oh so painful

Waiting in line Kelly Bayan and
Fran Johns wait in line at the cash-
iers office to pay their bills.

Pete Rondinelli

check made out to ours truly, The Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh. I don’t know
about you, but it drives me crazy to
write out a check for over two thousand
dollars and that just covers tuition, nev-
er mind room and board fees.

But really, I know it will be worth it in
the long run. Where can you go in to-
day’s world without a college education
— Wendy’s? I think not and I definitely
know that my parents share this same
view. Why else would they have saved
up for eighteen years — for me to go
out and blow my wad, so to speak, on a
hot car?

When I think of it, the cost of ed-
ucation is really not that high. just look

at all you gain by going to college. You
have the shelter of an added four or ﬁve
years in order to learn how to become
an adult, it teaches responsibility, how
to make lasting friends, and lastly how
to function as a key part of society.

Sure, the tuition bill seems pretty
steep now, but when you look back on
those years at Pitt, say in twenty years
or so when your kids are ready for col-
lege, you’ll say that the cost of an ed-
ucation is not too high and definitely
worth it.

President Posvar speaks to students.

Posvar’s Retirement

Life in the left seat

Here in a log cabin deep in the woods
of western Pennsylvania, it is not
difficult to imagine the origins of this
university: a one-room schoolhouse
built at the extreme edge of Amer-
ican civilization more than two cen-
turies ago.

That cabin was the realized vision
of Pitt founder Hugh Henry Brack-
enridge.

This cabin, too, has connections
to Pitt history. It is a retreat, a haven
of silence and natural beauty for
Pitt’a 15th president, Wesley Wentz
Posvar. After 24 years of leadership,
longer than any other current major
American university president, Pos-
var will depart from office later this
year.

With Pitt now state-related, tuition
was lowered and the pool of pro-
spective students grew dramatically.
Enrollment doubled by 1972. Re-

search likewise burgeoned, and by
1974 Pitt was invited to join the As-
sociation of American Universities
(AAU), representing the top research
universities in North America. “That
was when we came of age,” Free-
man says.

As the rainstorm begins to sub-
side, Posvar contemplates his dis-
appointments since 1967. “l have
felt some natural frustration as the
leader of the University in bringing
my own ideas into fulflllment,” he
allows. It took so many years for the
establishment of the Honors College,
which was one of my earliest hopes.
But decisions like that simply don’t
get made by executive order, but
rather built by consensus of many
people.”

As for his own personal future,
Posvar says, “l’ve always been in-
terested in public service. All of my

basic and advanced eduation was
provided by public funds, and I feel a
lifelong obligation to repay the
debt.”

At present he heads the National
Advisory Council for Environmental
Policy and Technology and the Fed-
eral Emergency Management Agen-
cy. He is also a government con-
sultant in national security and
foreign policy.

Posvar will be leaving the pres-
idency, but he will not be leaving
Pitt. He remains a professor of po-
litical science with a joint appoint-
ment in GSPIA. He also plans to do
development work for the Univer-
sity.

WHAT IS CGS . .

Imagine this scene. You punch your
time card. Work 'ust let out. However,
your day is har ly ﬁnished. Where is
the coffee machine? Dinner — dinner
would be good here. Time check. You
have class in 40 minutes. Not to men-
tion the fuel gau e is reading “E”. And
in less than an our, the thought of
6000+ people deluging the university

ervades your mind. Where do you
park? For the students enrolled in the
College of General Studies, this is not
an imaginary scene. This situation is
reality — a reality that encompasses the
routine of their ever day lives.

The University of fittsburgh has two
divisions: The College of Arts and Sci-
ences (CAS) and the Colle e of General
Studies (CGS). Underneat the surface,
the two divisions contain many simi-
larities and differences. The most ob-
vious difference is the mixture of stu-
dents. CGS is com osed of a very
diverse population. anging from 16-
year-old geniuses to housewives, grad
students to senior citizens, CGS blends
a combination of ages, maturities, and
experiences.

Most of CGS classes are evening class-
es, and CAS and CGS classes can be
cross-re istered. The time slots are
5:45—8:1 and then 8:20-10:45. Essen-
tially, the majors are the same as CAS;
however, the programs vary consider-
ably. CGS students have the opportu-
nity to participate in an external studies
program or attend class on Saturdays.

or most of us, classes extending late
into evening or interrupting our week-
end do not sound appealin . However,
for individuals that work fu l-time, CGS
mana es to accomodate their needs and
availa ility. Furthermore, CGS stu-
dents are very demanding of their pro-
fessors and themselves. It is to be con-
sidered that with many great efforts
come man great rewards.

The C0 lege of General Studies is its
own separate department, complete
with government divisions and student
organizations. Through the efforts of

 
 
    
  

1

these bodies, the calendar year of CGS
follows an active agenda.

The next several pages will attempt to
illustrate and explain the legislature,
the activity, and the academics that gov-
ern the hustle-bustle life of CGS.

Student Government is headed by ﬁve
CGS students. Elections are held every
April with splecially-coded ballots
mailed to the omes of CGS students.
Responses are tallied, and a president
and four government council members

Numerous services are offered b the
CGS Student Government Board. erv-
ices such as free notary public, infor-
mation lines, tutoring service, parking
permits, photocopy service, and an
available study loun e help to provide
for the needs of CG students.

Council member William Battles, ]r.,
also a non—traditional student, com-
ments, “My duties and experiences help
to enhance my communication skills.”

In an effort to comply with their task
of planning, sponsoring, and ﬁnancially
supporting activities and services, the,
government includes ﬁve separate d1-f
visions and ﬁve separate student organ-
izations. 9

Located in Room 615 of the William

ment operates Monday through Friday ‘
under the assistance of ames Ray-
mond, _]r., Karrie Valauri, and Jeans
DiTullio.

 

Budget and Finance/ Publicity and Information

Under the direction of Bryan Ihrig, the
Budget and Finance Division accom-

lishes several goals. The division acts
as treasurer to CGS by reviewing bud-
get proﬁosals, requests, and modiﬁca-
tions. T e Bud et and Finance Division
is also responsi le for making recom-
mendations to the government council.
Res onsible for acting as the commer-
ciallzing voice of CGS, the Publicity and
Information Division is headed b
Yvonne Cook. This division has the task
of ublicizing activities, events, and spe-
cial) engagements. Postin informative

What’s
new

B uses on Fifth Avenue? That’s what a lot
of students were askin about when
they returned to school for t e 90-91 year.
Students found a lot of lot of new things this
year. The first thing that people noticed
were the buses on Fi th avenue. Durin the
year before, the bus lane had been c osed
due to concern for edestrian safety. It re-
opened on uly 15, 990. Now students had
to deal wit looking both ways when cross-
ing Fifth. “Trying to dodge buses in Oak-
land should be declared an official Olympic
sport," says sophomore Mindy Shofner. “it
takes skill and practice to get across without
getting killed.‘ A lot of students quickly got
used to it

The reconstruction of Soldiers and Sail-
or’s Memorial Hall parking lot was still un-
der way when school began but the con-
struction was finally completed in January
1991. “What is that supposed to be?”, asks
freshman Dianna Willis. “It seems like they
were buildin for so long and not getting
anywhere.” Fhe completion of the parking
lot helped ease the parking congestion in
Oakland somewhat. Schenly parkin lot also
underwent changes in order to ma e more
parking spaces available. The meters were

taken out and replaced by an attendant. The
hourly rate was raised as an incentive for
peo Ie not to park there too lon .

Shop took over the ol shop whic sold Pitt
merchandise as well but at a cheaper price.
The outside vendor that also sold Pitt mer-
chandise expanded and opened up a store
on Atwood. Most important, and I'm sure
people noticed this first; the University Bev-
erage Center(UBC) moved from Forbes Av-
enue to u on Meyran.

The C arles L. Cost Center Sports Fa-
cility was completed and opened this year
too. It has a state of the art training room
which is used by members of varsity athletic
sports to train and spacious grass tennic
courts. It’s located right behinbd the OC

An in-depth look at

 

Taking a break before class

External Studies is a CGS curriculum pro-
gram that requires a high level of mo-
tivation, self—d1sci line, and perseverance.
Students enrolled) in this rogram meet
three Saturdays a term. e rest of the
learning process is the responsibility of the
student. The University External Studies
Program (UESP) workshops are designed
for students that attend college part-time
and work full-time. Exams are scheduled
at testin sites off-campus, although there
is an Oa land test site. The program does
require textbooks and study guides; how-
ever, not all college majors are offered
through UESP. As for assignments and
academic progress feedback, most of this
is handled through the mail.

 

Studying for that crucial midterm

Another interesting feature character-
istic of the CGS curriculum rogram is
60+ College. Designed for 01 er individ-
uals, the 60+ College program is not nec-
essarily for individuals seeking a degree.
Many 60+ students sign u for three or so
credits a term, and these c asses are merely
taken for academic and ersonal enrich-
ment. The College for 0+ also sends a
newsletter.

A good grade provokes a hesitant smile.

CLEP or College Level Examination
Program is a part of the CGS curric-
ulum that is instituted to help students
pass out of lower classes. In order to
accomplish this, students must take ex-
ams, pass, and then receive advanced

lacement credit. Examinations are of-

ered in the followin areas: English
Composition, Humanities, Social Sci-
ences-History, Mathematics, and Nat-
ural Sciences. The maximum possible
award is 30 credits, six credits per area.
CLEP is designed for students who are
knowledgable in specific areas, and the
tests must be taken before a student has
earned 15 credits. Test fees range from
$25 to $35. CLEP is also part of the
College of Arts and Sciences (CAS) pro-
gram.

the CGS curriculum

If a student ﬁnds it more convenient to
schedule classes on the weekend, the
CGS Saturday College provides this op-
tion. A program of Saturday morning
and afternoon classes is offered on the
Oakland cam us. However, ma'ors are
not offered tiirough the Saturday Col-
lege program. Eventually, a student in-
tent on earning a degree must register
for afternoon or evenin classes, or en-
roll in UESP. Classes and times slots for
GAS can be cross-registered with CGS
listings.

The Professional Translation Certiﬁcate
Program provides students with the o -
portunity to earn a certiﬁcate in the ﬁel)d
of translation. To enroll in the program,
one must take an exam to ensure third-
year college level foreign langua e com-
petency. Tthfhprg rﬁin trzimsf stu e111ts_ to
com e e a e lg eve o trans ation
usedpin government, business, internation-
al agencies, translation companies, and
publishing. A certiﬁcate is awarded upon
com letion of 18 credits and ualifying
per ormance on an exam. Possible intern-
ships are offered to qualiﬁed students.

“Here’s looking at you, Kid.”

Besides the wide ran e of majors available,
CGS students also ave the privilege of
declaring a self—designed major or a joint
major, or serving an internship. Self-
designed majors enable students to select a
course of study not already available;
moreover, recommendation from the De-
an, a faculty member, and an adviser is
needed. joint ma'ors allow students to
draw from two ﬁe ds. Furthermore, CGS
students that are eli ible to serve an in-
ternship may do so w ile receiving credit.

Experience CGS

The College of General Studies (CGS) is
most] thought of as “the evening class-
es”. esides this assertion, there are
several contrasting features in CGS rel-
ative to CAS. However, ﬁrst it would be
beneﬁcial to probe into the College of
General Studies to ﬁnd out what makes
it tick.

The College of General Studies has
two categories of students: traditional
and non-traditional. Traditional stu-
dents are full-time students who are the
stereotypical college a e. Non-
traditiona students are individuals who
return to college either to receive a
degree or to receive personal fulﬁll-
ment. For example, non-traditional stu-
dents may be housewives now seeking a
career or an a1ready—employed bussi-

nessman wishing to pursue a different
ﬁeld of interest. These non-traditional
students are usually n_ot of stereotypical
colle e age; individuals registered in
the 0+ program are non-traditional
students. As a mother of two and an
aspirin CGS 1993 graduate, CGS Stu-
dent overnment President Nancy
George can be considered a non-
traditional student. Non-traditional stu-
dents usually work full-time and attend
school part—time.

The College of General studies offers
man varied majors, althou h some dif-
fer rom CAS. And so aﬁhough the
University of Pittsburgh is one entity, it
is subdivided into two very distinct col-
leges. The following page will now
probe this comparison/contrast.

As for professors, CGS has a different
caliber of instructor. Although CGS

CGS vs. CAS

CAS and CGS both have student ov-
ernments. The President of the AS
Student Government Board, Brent
Saunders, and Nancy George, CGS Stu-
dent Government President, both kee
active schedules. Both governments o -
fer services such as tutoring, parking
permits, etc.

Majors in CAS and CGS are nearly
identical. However, one notable differ-
ence is the Business major. In CAS, it is
a ﬁve year program that requires a dual
major. In CG , however, it is only a
four-year program, and a dual major is
not necessary. Business majors, are you
listening?

Where are the students coming from?
This question receives extremely dif-
ferent answers when CAS is compared
to CGS. CAS is generally composed of
stereotypically-aged freshmen, sopho-
mores, juniors, and seniors; most of
which have on-campus housing. CGS,
though, is a mixture of different eo-
ple: teenage geniuses, regular co ege
students, parents, senior citizens, and
full—time workin individuals. CGS
blends grou s of éifferent ages, expe-
riences, and ackgrounds.

Both CAS and CGS are undergrad-
uate programs. After one has obtained
the credits necessary to earn his/her
degree, he or she may apply to one of
the University of Pittsburgh’s graduate
schools.

Underneath the surface, CAS and
CGS have more internal differences.
The Pitt News is the newspaper read
more frequently b CAS students,
whereas the Night Times is the official
CGS newspaper. CAS students can par-
ticipate in several social and honorary
Greek organizations. The honorary
Greek societies available in CGS include
the followin : Al ha Sigma Lambda,
Psi Chi, Lam da A pha Epsilon, and Phi
Chi Theta.

Student Government President Nancy George speaks
at a meeting.

Finally, CGS offers awards exclusively
to its own students; for example, the
CGS Chancellor’s Evening Scho ars, the

j. Steele Gow Scholarship, the Lubrizol

Scholarshi , and the Outstanding CGS
Senior of t e Year Award.

These are namely all of the char-
acteristics that differentiate CGS from
CAS. These are the characteristics that
a normal bystander could not observe.
And it is these characteristics that make
CGS such a distinct separate college.

The J. Steele Gow Scholarship recipients are a cross-section of CGS.

“I’m surprised I got the scholarship, because I am a part—time student and I thought full-time students would get priority,”
said William Molnar, one of the three recipients of the 1990 Steele Gow scholarships. It is awarded based on academic merit and
on need.

Molnar is working toward a B.S. in computer science, with a minor in mathematics. He started out as a business major, but
then tried computer science. There he found his niche.

“I love ﬁnding answers,” he said. “I become obsessed with ﬁnding the most efﬁcient solution to a problem. That’s why I
settled on computer science.” He added that he is “deadly serious” about his course work. “I started out just wanting to pass,
but the better I did, the more serious I became.” So far he has received straight As.

After beginning school in 1989, he lost his job in 1990, a bystander in the collapse of the steel industry. “My company didn’t
make steel, but the mills were our main customer.” Since then he has held various jobs, from census taking to sales.

His family remains his greatest achievement, Molnar said. He and his wife have four children, ranging from 6 to 13 years old.
“My wife and kids are my greatest achievement,” he added. “I try to spend as much time with them as I can. After I graduate,
I’ll get to spend even more time with them.”

Moriah Loiben was “surprised but very happy to win the scholarship. I was thrilled because my husband doesn’t pay for any of
my education. I have to go to other sources for the money and the scholarship helps a great deal.”

She will graduate with a B.S. in psychology, plus certiﬁcates in communications and women’s studies. She plans to attend
graduate school.

She moved to Pittsburgh when her husband was transferred here. Six months after they arrived, she received a brochure
about opportunities available through CGS and began at Pitt.

Her education is the one thing she does “just for herself,” so the scholarship means a great deal. “Sometimes you feel that
even though you study hard, it really doesn’t bring you any immediate rewards. So getting the scholarship was rather special,”
she said.

She balances her studies with raising her three children, the oldest of whom is 8. The best way to do this is to do as much
school work as she can with her children. “My 8-year-old daughter and I will do our homework together. And I’ve typed many
papers with my baby son on my lap. He’s the kind of baby who doesn’t need a lot of sleep, so we’re together many nights. I call
him my ‘study buddy.’ ”

She adds, “I consider my greatest achievement to be sticking with my courses — even when things got rough.”

Karl Byrand said that, “I wouldn’t have tried out for the scholarship if my wife hadn’t urged me to. So I was surprised when I
won. The scholarship will really go a long way toward picking up my extra expenses, like books and special materials.”

He will graduate from Pitt with a B.A. in history. “I chose history because I want to know everything. And history seems the
best avenue to do this because everything relates to history — art, science, literature, you name it.” He plans to get a doctorate
in historical geography, and teach at a college out in the country.

He and his wife work at Pitt’s Housing and Food Service Department signing in visitors to residence halls. They ride in to
work together every day.

Both are athletes who love the outdoors. “This last winter, my wife finally got me to be serious about skiing,” Byrand said.
“She’s done it for years — now I’m hooked.”

He also backpacks, canoes and climbs rocks. Last» summer, he taught rock climbing as an instructor at a summer camp
attended by many Soviet youths. They couldn’t speak English and the three Soviet adults who supervised them weren’t very
ﬂuent either. But everything went off without a hitch. “Climbing can be potentially dangerous. Everything has to be done
right,” he said. “And this time it was. It was a great adventure.”

ORGANIZATIONS

Why Should You join an Organization?

There are a number of organizations on the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh campus offering opportu-
nities for new friendships, sharing of common
interests, and learning how to work with other
people.

The people you meet in the organization that
you choose to join have a good potential of grow-
ing to be friends of yours because you all ready
start off with one thing in common — a common
interest in the group you have both chosen. By
sharing something, people learn to communicate
with others and give their opinions on topics that
are being discussed. Cooperation and dealing with
problems go along with working with others and it
also provides a good learning experience that will
help you in the future.

Joining an organization also requires you to allot
your time beneficially. While you are putting in
extra time for meetings or events related to the
organization you must also make time for your
studies and everything else that has to be done.

The University of Pittsburgh offers a variety of
different organizations consisting of different in-
terests. There are political, recreational, profes-
sional, and social groups and there is at least one
organization that holds some interest for you.
There are over 100 organizations to choose from
and in the next few pages you will see repre-
sentations of Pitt’s Organizations and some events
that they have taken part in.

Organizations can provide a learning experi-
ence for you and offer you a chance to meet some
new friends. There are many different groups
offered and they seem to bring the students of
PITT together.

CLINICALDIETETICS

some clinical dietitians advise schools as to what they are and are not
auowed to feed the students. Conical dietitians also advise hospitals and
nursing homes on the dietary needs for a patient with a speciﬁc disease
or they can help promote health and ﬁtness in recreation clubs through
propel‘ eating. Other clinical dietitians check on the safety of food
Supply and management of food service operations. They plan healthy
menus, purchase foods, plan food delivery services and train supervising
personnel. Nutritional health care and healthy eating habits are taught
and trained by clinical dietitians to patients, hospital staffs, families,
groups, schools, and other professionals.
MEDICALTECHNOLOGY

Remember Biology lab? Medical technologists are the people whok got
excited when you had to prick your finger and draw blood to ﬁnd out
what blood type you were. Medical technologists analyze body ﬂuids
and tissues; and study bacteria, viruses, and toxic substances. They
make sure blood, in a blood transfusion, is compatible with the patient
and they measure the immune status of a patient to detect ab-
normalities, infections, and matching tissues for a transplant. They also
measure blood levels of cholesterol, sugar, and other chemicals and
correctly monitor them for the patient’s body. Certain diseases such as
leukemia, or sickle cell anemia can be identified by a medical tech-
nologist, as well as other disease causing organisms.

Medical technologists are a major source of information, in that they
analyze and interpret all of these tests and pass on their ﬁndings to
doctors and other specialists.

HEALTHRECORDS

ADMINISTRTION

Often hospitals seem like a whole bunch of people running around in
chaos and confusion. Actually the system does have organization,
thanks to the health records administration.

Hospitals, mental health agencies, rehabilitation centers, home-care
services, and long-term care facilities count on these people. Institutions
such as these couldn’t operate if it weren't for healthe records ad-
ministrators.

Health records must be analyzed, designed, and maintained, and this
involves planning, organization, and direction — provided by the
health records administration. They also work with health professionals
to develop methods to evaluate patient care and services; and with
researchers who use health care information. They will also supervise
medical records including cancer, trauma, diabetes, and a widespread of
other areas.

HRP students will work in hospitals but they are not limited to that
environment. They will have jobs available in school systems, in-
dustries, government agencies, and as educators to the public. Ob-
viously there are some unique people up there on the hill. Their
interests seem very diverse but in the end they all wind up working
together to promote health and wellbeing.

PITT ROWING CLUB

The University of Pittsburgh Rowing Club, better known as
“Pitt Crew,” provides year—round competition to its more than
50 active members. The organization started just two years ago
with a few students who knew little about rowing, but who stuck
together and worked hard at the sport. Despite such a meager
beginning, Pitt Crew has become very successful very quickly:
they have medaled in every race they’ve competed in so far.
Their competition includes the University of Michigan, Mich-
igan State, Ohio State, Purdue, and other mid-western schools.
Pitt Crew consists of four-man shells with cox and without,
eight-man shells with cox and without, pairs with cox and
without, single schulls, and quadruple schulls. Boats are 44 feet
long, yet only 20 inches wide!

Rowing season begins in early September and ends a week
before Thanksgiving. In full competition, rowers race against
the clock through a three-mile course. Much time is spent
learning to row and mastering the basics of the sport. Pitt Crew
participates in two to four regattas each fall. On September 29,
it hosted the ﬁrst-ever “Head of the Ohio,” a fund-raising event
for the Mercy Hospital Burn Center.

 

“Pete Aphern keeps rowing and rowing, but for some reason he doesn’t seem to
be going anywhere.”

164

Pitt Crew cont [

The race runs from 31st Street to the Fort Duquesne Bridge.
One thousand rowers participated, including students from Cor- ,
nell, Brown, MIT, Notre Dame, Villanova, Carnegie Mellon, and .
Duquesne. The success of “The Head of the Ohio” has prompted 
Pitt Crew to plan more charity events.

Pitt Crew undergoes eight weeks of rigorous winter training
before beginning their spring season, which runs until mid-May.
Spring competitions are more intense and more fun because
rowers race against one another in sprints, (shorter courses of 1
about 1.2 miles.) ’

Seven regattas were planned for spring, including “The Dadvale ,
Regatta,” in which 40 schools competed for the national cham- 9,
pionship. To qualify for the Davale, a crew team must go through j
a series of satellite races. There is hope that in the near future, Pitt
Crew may develop one such satellite.

Pitt Crew is a member of the Mid-America’s Collegiate Rowing
Association.

STUDENT HEALTH ADVISORY BOARD

The Student Health Advisory Board (SHAB) is a
service organization comprised of students interested
in ensuring quality health care and promoting well-
being on campus. SHAB serves as a liaison between
the students and the Student Health Service. This
provides a voice through which students may express
their concerns about the health service. Also, this
provides a means for the Student Health Service to
receive feedback from, and to relate with, the stu-
dents.

SHAB participates in many activities and sponsors
many of its own programs. Some activities that
SHAB gets involved with are: the promotion of al-
cohol awareness and education through Mocktails at
the Annual Health Fair, hosting a game booth at the
Hand~in-Hand Festival, and the production of a pam-
phlet addressing pedestrian safety on campus. Some
of the programs SHAB has sponsored include:
Seatbelt Safety, Spring Break Survival Kits, Pitt is Fit
Day, and Safety Awareness Day.

SHAB offers a unique experience for any student
wishing to take an active role in promoting healthy
styles on campus. Membership is open to all students
that pay the Student Health Service fee.

to attend law school. Regular meetings
feature guest speakers such as law pro-

and recruiters from various law schools.
Other activities include courthouse
trips to observe trials, LSAT prep
workshops, and Law Day, an annual
event featuring representatives from
various law related professions and law
schools recruiters as well.

Through regular participation, mem;
bers are educated about law school, the
legal profession and entry in both the
former and latter. We offer recommen-
dations concerning an appropriate un-
dergraduate curriculum and make our
collection of law school brochures avail-
able to all members. The Pre-Law So-

groups here at Pitt, its resounding suc-
cess and popularity are quite close.

When the club was founded in March
of 1988 by William Lester, it initially
had a membership of lesslthan two dozs
en. By the Fall of 1988, however, the
P.P.R.C. had ex anded its membershi
to over 150 stu ents, facult , and staf a;
At that time, after a great eal of hard
work and ne otiations with nervous
university of icials, the -P.P.R£C. ob-
tained the right to utilize the range in
Trees Hall which had been virtually
unused by everyone but R.O.'I‘.C. and
the campus olice. For the next 2 years,
“Tuesda  ht at Trees Hall” became
the rule or ozens of Pitt shooters.

As we move towards our 4th year, the
P.P.R.C. hopes to continue to promote
the shooting s orts here at Pitt. Anyone
interested in earning the safe han lin
of firearms or experienced, casua
shooters have always been, and will al-
ways be, welcome to participate in both

Rugby has returned to the Pitt campus
after almost a full decade. The sport of
Rugby started in the early I800’s when a
soccer player at Rugb College in England
picked u the ball an ran with it during a
match. his £1/ear’s club had a tough 0 en-
ing-season sc edule, playing such schoo s as
Bowlin Green, I.U. ., Slippe Rock, and
top-ran ed Penn State. The clu also scrim-
maged a few area men’s clubs to’ gain a
better understanding of the game. Al-
though the Panthers took a slow start, try~
ing to familiarize themselves with the game
and teammates, by November thin s started
comin together. The club ﬁnis ed their
first fa 1 season with a decisive 14-O victo
over cross-town rivals Carnegie-Mellon,
The Panthers headed into the second half of
the first season with four matches and two
tournaments, here in Pittsburgh and in
Charlotte, North Caro1ina,*schedui‘ed. In‘
their first year of play, the Panthers are led
by team captain Rick Kaufman, and co-
captain Doug Pastor. The team would like
to dedicate all Sprin season matches to
fullback Bill Reed, an his safe return.

UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH’S MEN’S GLEE CLUB

As the 101st year of the Pitt Men’s Glee Club began, many of
the members looked forward to the upcoming year. The past few
months have certainly kept the Glee Club busy. We have per-
formed at many functions, including a farewell tribute to retiring
Pitt president Wesley W. Posvar, several winter holiday parties,
and most recently a weekend tour and concert with the ladies of
Immaculata College in Immaculata, Pa.

The Glee Club prides itself on having a wide variety of majors in
its ranks, and also has the unique title of Pitt’s truly oldest ex-
tracurricular activity. In the 101 years that the Glee Club has
existed, one thing has remained evident. As long as there is music
to sing, the Glee Club will be there.

Dzﬂerent Interests Coming Together

 

RSA

RSA Brings All On-Campus Students Together

The Resident Student Association (RSA) represents the 4200 students living in Pitt’s nine residence halls. It acts as the liasion
between residents and the Housing Office, Office of Residence Life, and the Student Government Board. RSA sponsors the Fall and
Spring Flings in Schenley Quad, featuring barbeques, give-aways, games, and contests; the open forum between students and the
heads of Student Affairs, Housing, Food, etc.; and the popular Valentine’s Day Gateway Clipper Cruise.

RSA also sponsors the Lothrop Challenge which runs from late October to early December. The Lothrop Challenge is a contest in
which all residence halls come together to donate money to a particular charity. Halls compete against each other to raise the most
money per resident.

RSA’s main goal is to unite all students living on campus here at Pitt.

STAR

Students Against Racism was founded by Matt Sipple in January of 1990. He saw separation of groups, bad race relations, and a
need for unity. The group could bring about a sense of unity and understanding. The ﬁrst meeting consisted of seven people who
had common concerns and wanted to take part in the struggle against racism. After that the group ﬂourished and reached out to the
campus, to the city, and other college campuses.

Our definition of racism is the claim or assumption that some human beings are inherently superior and others inferior, because
of their race, religion, or ethnic origin, and the resulting behavior and actions. We plan to work as a catalyst for change by helping
people learn about other cultures and respect them because people are people.

The University of Pittsburgh’s Band, Golden Girls and Cheerleaders are known
for providing spirit and undieing support to our sports teams. iI the team is losing
the Band plays its “CHARGE” song and the Cheerleaders start yelling louder,
trying to get the crowd behind the team to show some support to them and let the
team know we think they can still win.

The Band and Golden Girls always put on a great half time show for the crowd
and the cheerleaders perform their dance routines on the sidelines during time-
outs.

I think the best spirit from the Cheerleaders, Band, and Golden Girls is shown by
including the crowd in a number of cheers and songs like the famous “Let’s Go
PITT” and everyone’s favorite “P-E-N-N-S-T ———————— --—.”

One question — “Why do we say that cheer when we are playing Boston College?”

PITT spirit I guess.

Anyway, these three groups put out a lot of effort supporting our sports teams
and the next time they try to get you to join into a cheer or song, don’t hold back,
give them your loudest yell and show them you have spirit for PITT too.

WHAT DOES BEING GREEK MEAN?

I’ve always wondered, and possibly you have too, about
the Greek. And no, I’m not talking those individuals long
since dead that haunt our Greek Civilization and Mythology
classes like specters. I’m talking about those Greeks that are
very much alive and running around campus proudly dis-
playing their Greek letters to anyone who wishes to look. So
with the help of some really good, dear, and special friends
of mine: _]im Krenus of Theta Chi, Michelle Botscheller of
Kappa Delta, and Barbara Rodriquez of Alpha Epsilon Phi,
I set out on a mission to ﬁnd out what a Greek is, and what
being Greek does mean.

Why do people go Greek? One reason is that they are
coming to a large school only knowing a few souls and wish
to get involved. “I went Greek because I wanted to get
involved in on campus activities,” relates Jim.

‘‘I became Greek because I was coming to a large school
not knowing anyone and I was always involved in high
school. All through high school, I had valued the close
friendships I had. I viewed a sorority as a place I could make
new valueable and lasting friendships,” tells Michelle.

Why pledge to a certain sorority or fraternity, what
makes one so special? Michelle tells of why she went Kappa
Delta, Kappa Delta is “a feeling of home. I didn’t feel that I
had to be anyone other than myself — who I was. Genuine
smiles and friendliness. Everybody in the sorority, all the
sisters, are different, but work together and get along as
one group. We’re all friends.” Barbara and Jim tell one
reason was because they felt comfortable. “When I was
going through rush, it was the place where I felt more
comfortable and I thought it has a lot to offer,” Barbara
explains.

BEING GREEK

_]im tells how he became interested in Theta Chi, “At the
beginning of freshman year my roommate and I lived in the
Towers, where hou get to meet a lot of people. We just so
happened to live next door to someone from our home-
town. He had already begun pledging Theta Chi and
through him we met a lot of brothers. The next semester we
went to a few rush events and got the feeling that it was a
very close knit house.”

What does being Greek mean? When I asked this ques-
tion, it didn't take long for everyone to answer. Barbara
relates that’s “being able to meet a lot of people, ap-
preciation for others and being able to express myself. It
has brought me the chance to grow as a person and the
opportunity to learn how to interact and work as a whole.”

“It’s given me the opportunity to get involved in the
charity events, Hand-in-Hand, All Greek kick off. But, most
importantly it’s given me a lot of lasting friendships” tells
Jim. For Michelle, it’s “more than just the sorority. I’ve just
met so many people from all the different fraternities and
sororities. It just gives you an opportunity to meet so many
people and do so many different things.”

Is going Greek for you? Our panel of experts all rec-
ommend going Greek. Barbara says, “You always get what-
ever you put into it. It could be the best time of your life.’’
“Some people might say it’s not for everyone, but I myself
must really admit that I’ve not regretted it. If a person can
put forth the time it can be very rewarding” says _]im.

BEING GREEK

One problem Greeks often encounter is the attitude that
they are for partying all the time. This is not the case. Jim
tells, “There’s no denying that there’s parties at frater-
nities, but on a given night you could also ﬁnd a party in
South Oakland. Fraterities have gotten stereotyped to some
extent. And it’s a shame because that’s not the way it always
is. People hear the word fraternity and immediately that’s
what they associate with it. And it’s a sad thought. People
should come down to Greek Week and see what we’re
doing. Maybe then that’ll dispel some of the myths.” “I feel
that the Greek system is more than just socializing. It’s
learning to help others and it’s what you make out of it,”
relates Barbara.

Why have they stayed Greek? “Because it’s become in-
creasingly important. The good memories, the good friends
not just in my sorority, in the entire Greek community. It’s
the feeling of doing something worthwhile for others who
are in need.

Not only in Greek Week, but, in my oun sorority’s phi-
lantrophies” says Michelle. Barbara tells, ” Because I had
support from the sorority in my hardest times. It was
ﬁnding a place-home away from home.” _]im relates that it
has “lived up to all the expectations I hoped for. Greek
Week is a really great time of the year. All of us going out
there for a good couse. You sense the competition but in the
end you get the feeling that you’re all on the same side.”

Michelle in turn sums everything up by saying, “It’s a
range of things, now that I’m in a sorority, I can look back
and say I’m glad I went Greek!”

Greek Animals

This Tri Delt, Debz Kavaler, to the right has a pet snake
named Dean Maxwell Ramrod. He was a big hit at the Greek
Week events.

The little dog at the bottom of the page belongs to a Greek
member also, he looks like he doesn’t feel to comfortable with
that snake around.

Of course the Pittsburgh Panther has to be considered a
Greek Animal too.

— I think the owner of him has nothing to worry about.

These Greek fraternities and sororities sure like to
show off their letters. We thought having their
Greek letters on their sweatshirts was enough but
now they have to carry huge letters to show their
GREEK SPIRIT.

RAISE

The Level

Disappointing
Season . . .

There were high hopes for the Panthers following an 8-3-1 season in 1989, highlighted by a
dramatic come-from-behind victory over Texas A&M in the John Hancock Bowl. But what
resulted was a disappointing 3-7-1 injury-filled campaign in which Pitt failed to participate
in a bowl game for the second time in the past three years.

Head coach Paul Hackett got off to a quick 2-0 start in his first full year at the helm, with
home victories over Ohio University (35-3) and Boston College (29-6).

The Panthers were ranked in just about every top twenty poll and seemed ready to move
into the Top 10 with a showdown against the Oklahoma Sooners in Norman, Oklahoma.
Instead they were the victims of a 52-10 massacre in front of a crowd of over 71,000 fans
and a national television audience. The following week Pitt traveled to the Carrier Dome
where they pulled off a dramatic come-from-behind 20-20 tie a ainst Syracuse. The Pan-
thers almost came away victorious, but ran out of time on their inal drive.

Next up was a home game against perennial rival and nei hbor West Virginia. The
Mountaineers exploded and ran all over the heavily favored Pant ers at Pitt Stadium. They
dealt Pitt its third consecutive loss, 38-24.

‘ After a much needed week off, Pitt appeared to have regrouped as they erupted with a 45-

2 1 homecoming victory over the Rutgers Scarlet Knights. With their record standing at 3-2-
1 the Panthers still had a good shot at finishing with a winning record and participating in
post-season play.

But the roof caved in as the Panthers lost all five of their remaining games, resulting in
their worst season since 1 984 when they were also 3-7-1. Pitt lost home games to Louisville
(27-20), Notre Dame (3 1-22), and Temple (28-18), and on the road to Miami (45-0) and Penn
State (22-17).

The Panthers chances of ending their disappointing season on a high note looked
promising as they battled rival Penn State in Happy Valley on Thanksgiving weekend. But
they came up short by a score of 22-17.

Although the overall team performance fell way below expectations, there were some
individua performances worthy of note. Punter Brian Greenfield finished second in the
nation with a 45.6-yards per punt average. He was named First Team All-America by UPI.
the Walter Camp Foundation, the Footba 1 Writers Association, and The Sporting News. His
70-yard punt against Boston College on September 8 established a new Pitt record.

Although quarterback Alex Van Pelt did not enjoy the same success of his freshman year.
his 221.6 yards per game on total offense were enough to place him 1 9th in the country. He
threw for 14 touchdowns and a total of 2,427 yards.

Running back Curvin Rlchards was hampered by an ankle injury throughout the season.
limiting his playing time to eight (games. Despite the injury, he led the team in rushing with
682 yards and moved into secon place on Pitt’s all-time list with 3,192 yards.

Sophomore receiver Olanda Truitt compiled 895 yards which put him almost 500 yards
ahead of Pitt’s next closest receiver. He caught six touchdown passes and placed 20th in the
nation in receivin with 81 .4-yards per game.

Pitt fans were appy to see the return of former quarterback, turned receiver Darnell
Dickerson. He caught 21 passes for Pitt, two for touchdowns. In the season finale against
Penn State he not only caught a touchdown pass, but also threw a 63-yarder to Truitt for a
touchdown on an option pass from Van Pelt.

On defense, safety Doug Hetzler led the team in interceptions with four, linebacker Craig
Gob led in tackles (88), and defensive end Keith Hamilton led the Panthers in sacks, (10.5).

Hackett’s but as Hed Coah

produces a season of anguish

I t’s a tough job to take over a major football prczgram that is waning from its past glory. Throw in a young

inexperienced team, and it turns into a tough, iscouraging first season. Such is the case for University of

Pittsburgh head coach Paul Hackett.
Having been an offensive coordinator under some of the best National Football Lea ue coaches (Bill Walsh

and Tom Landry) and having coached some of the NFL’s most productive quarter acks in Joe Montana.
Danny White and Brian Sipe, big thin s were expected out of Paul Hackett when he became the offensive
coordinator for then-head coach Mike ottfried at Pitt. Hackett's pro-style offense led the Panthers to one of
the most offensively productive years since Dan Marino’s tenure and also led them to their first bowl victory
since the 1982 Su ar Bowl.

Gottfried fell un er heavy criticism and was fired. A push was made by the players to hire Paul Hackett to
be Gottfried’s successor. Many even threatened to transfer.

So, Hackett was officially made the head coach before last year’s John Hancock Bowl. Immediately, fans
and players began speculating on the big things to come this season. Through all of this talk, Coach Hackett
maintained that people should not overestimate his team.

The current players have not stepped forward and shown the ability to take the team to bigger and better
things. In fact, thay have gotten worse. 3-6-1 worse. However, the players are not totally to lame for this
regression. Injuries decimated the defense, producing unlikely starters midway through the season. This
would not have posed too big a problem if Pitt had played teams such as Boston College during that stretch.
But the Panthers played a strong Louisville team, Notre Dame and longtime rival West Virginia, which all left
the Panther defense looking as if it was standing still.

To make matters worse, the offense hit the skids at the same time.

One theory was about the level of play sinking since Pitt's tough loss to No. 1 Notre Dame. “Notre Dame is
our bowl game,” said Hackett. “It has all the makings of one. It’s a sellout crowd. It’s on national television.

and they are highly ranked.”
Hackett now admits that perhaps he made a mistake in making that big a deal out of one game.

100 Years of W Tradition

ootball ames have become integral to college life in Oakland. Each fall, fans faithfully trek up the hill to watch the blue and gold at Pitt stadium. Freshmen
anxious y await the ﬁrst home game and soon learn the tradition of tailgatin , waving old pom-poms, and cheering along as the band plays “Hail to Pitt.”
Seniors eave with the memory of the final game, and then return later for t e annual omecoming festivities. This year players, coaches, and fans had the
privile e of celebratin one century of tradition. The following is a chronicle of those first 100 years.

On ctober 11, 18 0, Shadyside Academy failed to show up for its game against the Allegheny Athletic Association. Pitt, then known as the Western
University of Pennsylvania (until 1908), was called in to re lace Shadyside and lost its very first game, 38-0.

On November 17 of that same year, Western (Pitt) recor ed its first victory with a 12-10 win over Kiski. The team put up its first winning record (4-2) in 1892
and then hired Anson F. Harold as its first coach in 1893.

The 1904 team coached by Arthur St. L. Mosse saw its first unbeaten season with a 10-0 record. The team did not allow a point in its first nine games.

The 1910 team coached by Joseph Thompson was the only team in Pitt history to ﬁnish a season unbeaten, untied, and unscored u on.

Pitt established itself as a national powerhouse shortly after hirin legendary coach Glenn Scobey “Pop” Warner. From 1915-192 his teams compiled an
overall record of 59-12-4 with national cham ionshi s in 1915, 191%, and 1918.

From 1924-1938, Dr. B. “ ock” Sutherlang, who liad been an All-American at Pitt in 1917, continued the tradition of excellence initiated by Warner. His
fifteen-year tenure included 1ve national cham ionships (1929, 1931, 1934, 1936, and 1937), four Rose Bowl appearances, and an overall record of 112-20-12.
Pitt football suffered a decline in the 1940’s fo lowing the departure of Sutherland. They had ei ht consecutive losing seasons from 1940-1947.

Pitt’s mediocrity continued into the early 1950’s. One of the few high points was the play of Al -American linebacker _]oe Schmidt. He later became the first
alumnus elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame.

john Michelosen, who played on Pitt’s national championship teams in 1936 and 1937, became head coach in 1955 and brought some of the old lory back.
HIS first two teams, led by star tight end joe Walton (now offensive coordinator for the Pittsburgh Steelers) went to the Sugar Bowl in 1955 and the ator Bowl
in 1956. The were the only two bowl ap earances for Pitt between 1936 and 1973.

Following t eir trip to the Gator Bowl, Pitt encountered some lean times again. One bright spot was ti ht end Mike Ditka, who earned All-American honors
in 1960. Ditka went on to play for both the Chicago Bears and the Dallas Cowbo s, and is currently hea coach of the Bears. He is the only Pitt graduate to be
named to both the Colle e Football Hall of Fame and the Pro Football Hall of ame.

From 1964-1972, Pitt football suffered what may be its worst seasons ever. The cumulative record over that time period was 22-68-2.

In 1972, University President Wesley Posvar made a major step in returnin Pitt football to rominence when he hired johnny Ma'ors as head coach. In his
first season, Majors took a team that. had been 1-10 the previous season to a -5-1 record, hig lighted by a trip to the Fiesta Bowl. ubsequently, Majors was
named Coach-of-the-Year.

In 1976, Majors’ team put it all together to give Pitt its ninth national championshi . The Panthers defeated Georgia 27-3 in the Sugar Bowl. The
championship capped off a remarkable colle e career for runnnin back Tony Dorsett. In 1576, he became the only Pitt player to win the Heisman Trophy. He
still holds the school record for yards gaine in a career with 6,526. His best ame was in 1975 against Notre Dame when he ran for 303 yards.

Matt Cavanaugh, the quarterback for the 1976 cham ionship team, is still fﬁaying in the NFL as a member of the Super Bowl Champion New York Giants.

Following the 1976 season, Majors returned to coach is alma mater Tennessee and Jackie Sherrill came in to continue the winning ways. Sherrill was 50-9-1
in his five years at Pitt. Each team produced at least eight victories, including three consecutive 11-1 performances.

In 1980, defensive end Hugh Green won the Lombardi, the Maxwell, and the Walter Camp Awards, and finished second in the Heisman Trophy voting. In
addition, offensive tackle Mark May won the Outland Trophy.

In 1981, quarterback Dan Marino, who grew up within walking distance of Pitt stadium, completed 226 of 380 passes for 2,876 yards and 37 touchdowns. He
capped off his amazing season in the Sugar Bowl when his fourth down pass to tight end ohn Brown gave Pitt a 24-20 victor over Georgia in the ﬁnal minutes.

After Sherrill moved on to Texas A&M, Serafino “Foge” Fazio took over as coach. n Fazio’s first two seasons, Pitt ma e trips to the Cotton Bowl and the
Fiesta Bowl. After three seasons without a bowl appearance, Mike Gottfried, who had taken over in 1985, led Pitt to an 8-4 record and the 1987 Bluebonnet
Bowl. That season was highlighted by a 10-0 defeat of Penn State. It was Pitt’s first defeat of the Nittany Lions at Pitt Stadium since 1955.

Pitt’s last bowl appearance was in 1989 when Alex Van Pelt’s dramatic touchdown pass to Henry Tuten in the closing minutes of the john Hancock Bowl
against Texas A&M, gave current head coach Paul Hackett his first victor . _

Pitt’s century of football has roduced over 80 All-Americans and 18 1rst-round NFL draft choices. The Panthers 554, victories have earned them 15th
placed on the all-time list, and t eir nine national championships are sixth in the total ranking.

Football Supplement

In honor of “One Hundred Years of Pitt Football,” Panther
Prints presents this special supplement on this year’s team.

The “dream backfield” of 1938 (above) calls up memories of Pitt’s football triumphs. From Left: Harold Stebbins, Coach Jock
Sutherland, Marshall Goldberg, john Chickerneo, Richard Cassiano. The Panther mascot (opposite page) helped the team stay
psyched up, as when Dave Moore and Ronald Redmond celebrated a TD (lower left, opposite page, photo by Geoff Cienek.)
Sometimes the team’s 3-7-1 record led even the mascot to despair.

Posvar era ends
President Wesley Posvar retired after a
two-decade career at Pitt. His tenure saw
the university grow immensely. Posvar's
wife, Mildred (oppostie page, lower) was
also part of the Pitt scene. Events such as
Chautauqua at Pitt last year (left)
highlighted the Posvar years. The
president also gave blood during a blood
drive (below).
                                                                                                 349
       In the world of sports and entertainment,
  Pittsburghers said some good-byes. Sports fans
      said a cheerful farewell to the penquin as a
 figure of fun (above) as the Pittsburgh Penquins
said good-bye to their image as losers by winning
  the Stanley Cup. Brian Shorter (opposite page)
  closed out a career as one of the top players in
    the history of Pitt basketball. And music fans
  said farewell to the Syria Mosque (right), slated
                                for demolition.

Essentially, it makes
buying any other copier
an unnecessary risk.
                 XEROX
Total Satisfaction Guarantee
If you are not satisfied with your Xerox equipment, at your request,
Xerox will replace it without charge to you with an identical model or
a machine with comparable features and capabilities.
The term of the Xerox Total Satisfaction Guarantee is three years from
equipment delivery. If the newly delivered equipment is financed
by Xerox for more than 3 years, the Guarantee will apply during the
entire term of your Xerox financing.
This Xerox Total Satisfaction Guarantee applies to Xerox equipment
acquired by you from Xerox (including Sales Agents and participating
Dealers and Retailers) and continuously maintained by Xerox
or its authorized representatives under our Manufacturer's Warranty
or a Service Contract.
You're looking at the most extraordinary guarantee ever
put together by a copier company. In a nutshell, it says
that if you're not satisfied during the first three years,
we'll replace the machine. No questions asked.
Obviously, we wouldn't make this promise unless we
made copiers that could live up to it.
For durability, reliability and quality, nothing compares
to a small Xerox. That's why we have the highest brand
loyalty rating in the business. It's our customers that keep
coming back. Not our copiers.
Above all, when you compare full cost of ownership,
Xerox copiers can actually cost less than the competition.
~ 1991 XEROX Corporation. XEROX* is a trademark of XEROX Corporation.
So as you can see, there's really no risk in buying a small
copier anymore. Unless, of course, you buy it from
someone else.

Sometimes individual talents are best
revealed when you're part of a team.
Medical miracles. Rarely are they the result ofa one-man performance. In real
life, today's medicine is administered by teams. Physicians, nurses, and support
staff working as one towards common goals.
For some 140 years, our neighbors on Boathouse Row have demonstrated a
simple principle: You make the greatest progress when you pull in a single
direction. It's a basic principle we choose to follow. We do that by providing our
Nurses with an environment where they can do their personal best.
Medical College of Pennsylvania is an academic health science center which
includes a medical school, a 445-bed tertiary level teaching hospital and a
research center.
MCP is conveniently located in Philadelphia's pleasant East Falls residential
section, about 15 minutes from downtown. It is easily reached by both car and
public transportation.
Simply put, at the Medical College of Pennsylvania, yofi'll go farther than you
ever imagined. Because for MCP, there is only one direction-forward.

ADVISERS:

Do they know enough to give advice?

Getting around in a university the
size of the University of Pittsburgh
isn’t easy but it's even more of a
nightmare when you have an adviser
who doesn’t always tell you the right
things. This is often a familiar com-
plaint of a lot of students. “My ad-
viser didn’t tell me that was a re-
quirement", or “they never told me I
might not have enough credits to
graduate this year” are some com-
plaints that are associated with hav-
ing an inadequate adviser. My first
experience with an adviser consisted
of having a ‘fill-in’ adviser since my
real one wasn't around for the sum-
mer. First of all, no one ever told me I
that I would be assigned another ad-
viser once school started so when
registration time came around I
didn’t have anyone to see since I
didn’t know I had another adviser. I
kept wondering why everyone kept
asking me whether I had registered

or not or if I had seen my adviser.
Then my pseudo-adviser kept hav-
ing to leave the room every time I
had a question to ask someone(who
actually knew what they were doing)
for the right answer. All in all, it
wasn't a good experience.

But that is not to say that all ad-
viser’s are bad; there are some really
competent people out there giving
the right advice to people who have
no idea what they're doing. It is im-
portant to have an adviser because
no matter how much you think you
know about a system that someone
might have already told you about,
you won't know it til someone who is
trained to teach you the system
helps to guide you through it. This
doesn’t mean they're going to have
the answers to everything like what
you’re major should be but they'll at
least be able to tell you what are
some good classes to take and when

the best time is for getting your
quirements out of the way. “I
it's important to get someone w
recently been through the syst
since they know the ins and outs
well having just experienced it th
selves,” says CA8 student An
Barczykowski. “They know how
get you through it.”

Some people think advisers are
tally worthless. CA8 student Diam,
Willis says “Advisers are a waste
my time. I can easily figure out h
to do it myself and do it the easy
since advisers are determined
make you do everthing the I
way.” I think advisers can be a g
asset to making a student's life
school go along more easily as I
as the student doesn’t expect th
to know everything and has the ri
questions to ask. .

You need lots of room to spread
out when you try to pick your
classes. These two CA8 students try
to shuffle around with what space
they have in the Adviser's office.

That’s the tenth class I tried that is
closed. Now what do I do? A studen’t
worst nightmare is getting a late reg-
istration date and not getting into class-
es you want as this student tries again to
ﬁnd a class that’s open.

Where do Advisers go when they
need help? Advisers Jenna Hunter
and Greg Spicer go to each other.

That’ the tenth class that I tried
that's closed. Now what do I do?
Not getting into classes because
they're closed often gets blamed un-
fairly on the adviser.

This looks like a good one. Amy
Marcini flips through her time sched-
ule-whatever page it stops-that's
what class she's taking.

I hope I get it, I hope I get it! CA8
student Chong Lee is on the edge of
his seat as he registers for classes.

RELAXING PITT STYLE

HELP! my brain is fried from all this
wdying, I just have to get away! Now
he question where to go Here at Pitt,
here are many different wa s to get out
nd relax. Let s see we coul go out and
elax on the Cathedral lawn and enjoy
be beautiful day, or maybe just maybe
F you’re a little bit famished we could
lead on down to the “O” for a cheese
»izza?l . _

Whatever your passion might be you
an generally look forward to ﬁnding it
n and around Pitt campus. Favorite
iastimes of Pitt students are hanging at

one of the many bars that opulate the
Pitt communit C. ].’s, emin a ’s,
Peter’s, the SO , Thirsty’s, and §‘e]ld,a’s
just to name a few.

Or if you have the late night
munchies, ou can hang out with our
friends at t e “O”, run down to “ ev”,
and maybe if your feeling adventurous
you can hike up to North Oakland and
stop in and visit G at “G” ’s.

Many students enjoy just taking a
walk around the Quad to oosen up and

enjoy the day or even the night. Others
may prefer going to a concert at the

Arena, takin in a Pen’s game, or kick-
ing back an watching some football,
baseball or whatever sport they’re into
on the tube.

All in all, there are tons of thin s to
do to get out and relax and you on’t
even have to look very far. And if you
can’t ﬁnd anything to do (likel story
around this place with all 0 your
friends nearby to han with) you could
always curl u on your ed and catch up
on some of t at slee you missed out on
by partying last wee end.

Wasting time has never been so fun

How long did it take you to buy your
books last semester? It took me
about an hour and a half. Do you
think that is long? lt took me two in a
half hours the semester before that.
But, most of you probably already
know about the time we waste
standing in line at the bookstore.

My sisters warned me. “Don't buy
your books until the last possible
moment.” They knew about the
lines. l didn't believe them, though
and rushed out and bought them the
first day. What did l know, I was just
a stupid little freshman.

When I finally made it to the
checkout counter, l almost fainted
when she told me the total. $234! To
some that might sound cheap, but
for me, it was my lifetime savings.

I didn't worry, though, I would just
sell them back at the end of the
semester, right? Wrong. For a $60
book l would have only gotten $20
for it. Why? I don't understand why
they can't give us a reasonable
amount of money for our books.

Many people sell their books on
their own by hanging signs in the
lobbies of the Towers, Holland, etc.

This is a very good idea. You .
more money for your books and
person buying them saves a lot
money.

There is also a used booksale .
happens in the William Pitt
You can leisurely look at books .
sove some of your money.

I wish everyone luck in buying
books next year. I know I won't
there until the very last possible .
ment.

Study Dates

The art of dating with an added twist

want a new way to meet the man or
, Woman of your dreams? _
 Then, just picture this. You walk into
ﬂags ready to start the new semester,
your pencils are sharpened and poised
y We our recently purchased note-
‘it ok. ou notice the other students
I lking into class, you pay slight at-
‘ mion to them for no one has really
aught your eye. T_hen WHA_M, this
cam person walks into your life.
a4 And now, the bi uestion how do I
fﬁieet them, what 0 say, can I really
’ st go up to them and ask them _out
3-1 ht out of the blue? Hold on this is
éivﬁere I come in. You notice that your
idream person is also checking you out

   
   

‘i’

and likes what they _see. But, they too
have those same devilish thoughts run-
run through their brain.

_ever fear your guardian angel has
arrived. ust sit back and take this ride
slow an easy and you’ll soon be seeing
more of that special person. Now, make
sure that you_sit next to each other in
class and. do introduce yourself. Now,
you re friends and can help each other
if you don’t understand exactly what
the professor just explained.

Right on cue, step one is now com-
plete. On to step two, where you offer
your expert help on this subject matter
to your dream person. Here it is, the big
moment — the STUDY DATE.

Yes, it is a great way to meet that
dream person, spend time with them,
and also (at least I hope so in your case

mean everyone has to study sometime
(yes, even me though I don’t like to
admit to it in public) and you may as
well do it in the company of someone
you love.

And, just think that when you need to
take a study break ou have that s ecial
person there to he p ou kick bac and
relax. So remember, eed my words of
wisdom — ask that dream person to
study with you it’s a lot more fun.

ROTC (Reserve Officer’s Training Corps)

If you have ever been in the back of
the Cathedral, you may have noticed
the Official American flag. Have you
ever wondered how the ﬂag gets up and
down every day?

It is the responsibility of the Army
ROTC to do this special honor with the
Air Force ROTC taking its duty on
Wednesdays. This special responsibility
goes back in Pitt history to the 1940’s,
50’s and early l960’s. Though, in the
later part of the l960’s and 70’s this act
was suspended due to the lack of par-
ticipation on campus and was reinstated
in 1985 and still continues to this day.

Army ROTC (Reserve Officer’s
Training Corps) combines college
courses in military science with summer

training sessions to turn Pitt students
into officers. Upon completion of the
program and graduation, cadets are
awarded a commission as a second lieu-
tenant in either the U.S. Army, the
Army National Guard or the U.S. Army
Reserve.

The Air Force ROTC is an educa-
tional program designed to give both
men and women the opportunity to be-
come an Air Force officer while com-
pleting a bachelor’s degree. It prepares
the cadet to assume positions of increas-
ing responsibility and importance in the
modern Air Force.

ROTC courses teach critical leader-
ship and management skills. Skills that
make the cadet a better student today

and a more competitive job applicant
tomorrow’s job market. With Pitt beg
an academically challenging schq
ROTC classes have been designed,
that it will not interfere with the cadc
other college courses.

Both the Army and Air Force P,
grams have an annual Military Ball 3,’
a Dining in Ceremony. Both events;
formal and feature a guest speaker, u,
ally a General. The cost of these eve; -
are quite high, so to offset the cost«
the events both programs participate
fundraising activities, such as ho
sales in the bottom of the Cathedral,

Oh my gosh! ROTC field training
exercises are being performed by this
cadet.

Listen up! Quinten Battisti is taking
charge of his company.

Attention! Sergeant Crabil takes
control of his cadets outside on the
Cathedral lawn.

Look out! These cadets learn to
keep their heads low during training.

Honors College

Accuracy and academia

The University Honors College, which is open to _all interested Pitt students, provides four basic aspects within the college
itself: formal coursework, special advising, academic community and a close working relationship with faculty scholars.

Students, in addition to taking selected courses to meet requirements or electives, may earn a Bachelor of Philosophy of
Discipline degree from the University Honors (_]olle e.

A student may complete this _de ree by fulﬁlling t_ e requirements of the school in which they are presently enrolled and
completing a rogram_of study in t e UHC which will culminate in an independent piece of scholarship to be presented to a
board of facu. t ‘examiners. . _

Students wis ing to.participat_e_in the Honors College program must meet a 3.25 QPA re uirement for admission to the
pro ram. ‘Though, this prerequisite may be waived by obtaining special ermission from an HC advisor.

C biology, chemistry, and physics courses are most popu ar with reshmen, and often upper-level students are taken
with humanities courses.

Thus, the UHC exists to provide alternative academic opportunities to motivated students.

Pitt athletes are a special breed. For,
they must combine a promising athletic
career with an equally demanding ac-
ademic career.

juggling a full load of classes and
athletic practices has to be one of the
toughest jobs a student athlete must
ever face. How do these student ath-
letes manage to do it? Getting up in the
morning, sometimes early to make that
early morning workout, going to class-
es, taking exams, going back for a late
practice, and then going home to relax
by studying and doing their homework.
It’s a demanding schedule. And, Pitt
student athletes deserve a round of ap-
plause for keeping up with such a

FOLLOW

breakneck schedule.

What makes it even harder for these
athletes to compete in the classroom is
the fact that often they have to go on
road trips, for both regular season and
tournament play. Some of these stu-
dents may miss two or three days of
class, putting them behind in an already
tight situation. Since, the NCAA re-
quires that a student athlete needs to
complete twelve credits per term for
eligibility. For those student who have
chosen to take a stab at this type of life
know that it is a tough one, yet full of
rewards.

Though here at Pitt, these student
athletes can receive a helping hand to

Some say you are never too old to receive an education. I believe this. Some people decide to go to college
out of high school and others wait until after they have raised their families. An education is important no
when in your life you decide to get it.

I am no expert on this subject because I came to Pitt right after high school. I do, however know a little bit
people going back to school. My mom has just gone back to school this year. For the first in my life I can tell

Pitt. I feel like a social security number walking around.” '

It is also a lot harder to make friends for older students. They are usually commuters so it makes it difficult
involved in outside activities at the university. Also, most of their classmates are younger then they are, so
difficelt to make freinds with them. .
College life is a difficult adjustment for anyone, whether they are 18 or 48. So, whatever age you are, you are
to old to gain an education.
