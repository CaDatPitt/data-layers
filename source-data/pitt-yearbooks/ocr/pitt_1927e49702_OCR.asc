It lives a glorious thing beneath my smoke;
It is the spirit of the folk who toil,

Radiant as molten iron and glowing coke.

“Men have not glimpsed me yet in my true might

My soul lies hid beneath the sulphur night,
Waiting the dawn of morning, unafraid.

And hear above the thunder of the mills
‘The wordless prayer and hope of them that toil."

ACRUCIBLE, belching ruddy murk from its encrusting slag—that is the critics usual
connotation of Pittsburgh. On the surface Pittsburgh has that connotation, is that
“Shrine of Materialism." But are these critics blind to the molten metal beneath the slag,
to the idealism beneath the grime? Pittsburgh has no place for azure skies and babbling
brooks; it is a place of industries. Furnaces line her rivers and mills crest her hills. To them
by barge and train come coal and ore and sand; from them go glass and iron and steel.
Pittsburgh is an unrelenting force, driving wheels, and turning rollers, a creative force
harsh and overbearing. Always, since the Pyramids were lifted stone on stone to a brassy
sky, men have been lost in immensities, individuals in their endeavors. Such is the stigma of
Materialism: such is the stigma of Pittsburgh. When force raises the ribbed vaults of a
Cathedral, and beauty stains the mullioned windows, then artisan and capitalist are
brothers and all the world applauds the thrill of creation. Such is the spirit of Pittsburgh,
the spirit which redeems her from coarseness and gives her a genuine glory. As
truly as soot and smoke are symbols of Materialism, so the
red night skies are the torch of the
spirit beneath.

 

One night I lay by a fire of twigs at the woods edge.
Below, the river was lacquered with red, ﬂaked light.
At dawn I covered the ﬁre with ashes.

One night I stood by a ﬁre in a Slovak kitchen;
A mother sang to her child of the hills of Bohemia,

And this night her husband slacked the fire with ashes.

One night I stood by the open hearth at Bessemer.

Mournfully, through the dark, a freight train whistled.

Fury and splendor of ﬂames awed me to silence.

‘Time will put out these flames with his own ashes.

HER rivers brought greatness to Pittsburgh; her coal secured it. Stand at the Point

some sunset when the sky is orange above Mount Washington and the Ohio ﬂows
away in a broad, golden stream. Look along the shores at the dark lengths of mills with
jutting stacks, and notice in the gloom of the banks between the pastel bridges the barges
heaped with coal. Watch, too, the tugboats pushing other barges like extended shadows
as their paddlevwheels catch the last sunlight in falling foam. So, for over a century, the
rivers have been supplying Pittsburgh’s mills.

In the great migration of the late seventeen hundreds a pioneer tradingrpost grew up on
the site of the Golden Triangle — because the Ohio led west to wilderness farms and
frontier settlements. Coopers, mercers, ironmongers established their shops and forges,
and as early as 1797 General O‘Hara put up his glass factory near the Point. Before the
end of two decades the city charter had been granted, and trade was thriving. Pittsburgh’s
shipbuilders began to construdt oceanrgoing vessels. Then came the time when paddle»
wheelers first steamed under the bridges of the growing city. The old Pennsylvania Canal
came, too, and went; railroads lined the rivers. Toward the end of the century the world
was startled one day to End Pittsburgh its “industrial capital," and at present the city
retains her supremacy. But still the tugs push their barges to supply the mills with coal,
and still the paddle/wheeled steamers have their regular sailings from the wharves. Her
rivers helped Pittsburgh to grow, and they remain one of her greatest assets.

In 1784 a Virginian in a description of Pittsburgh wrote: “The banks of the Mononga—
hela on the west, or opposite to Pittsburgh, are steep, close to the water, and about two
hundred yards high. About a third of the way from the top is a vein of coal above one of
the rocks.” Coal! There in the hillside was the prophecy of greater Pittsburgh. Nor was
it long before interpreters appeared. In 1805 the first iron foundry was built; its success
led to others. Coal was cheap, for all the hills of the district had rich veins. Cheap coal‘.
Cheap transportation! The West was opening, had opened to Pittsburgh. The market was

lllsl

shire; llCC)”Z/7/ ©Wl

 

at hand, and industry was ready to supply it. Coal stoked the furnaces of the new city, and
iron poured forth for all the country and beyond. Farther and farther Pittsburgh sent for
her ores, but the coal to smelt them came from her own region. Plentiful coal meant cheap
iron, the ability to undersell. And now the mills along the rivers with their smoke by day
and fire by night show what power that ability has brought to the city. Nor was it in the
iron industry alone that coal gave Pittsburgh an advantage over her competitors. From its
start at O'Hara’s plant, glass manufacture has grown until now the Steel City is also the
center of the glass trade in the United States.

Indeed, Pittsburgh’s prosperity seems destined to increase. The city is ﬁtted by her
position to be the distributing center of one of the wealthiest regions of the country; from
the oﬂices of her skyscrapers the power of her district is controlled. The oil boom of western
Pennsylvania gave new vigor to an already ﬂourishing city. The farmers of the neighbor»
ing valleys brought their produce to her markets and left their money in her banks. And
with the new century George Westinghouse reared his great electrical plants to add to
the comfort of the world and the fame of greater Pittsburgh. So her coal, so her region, so
her rivers have added to the glory of the city —— and from her very eminence another
advantage has accrued. Her people! The idea seems forced, abortive, but instead it is
genuine and healthy. Pittsburgh‘s people‘. In the million of her county and the millions of
the region think of the skill, the talent.
Pittsburgh”s industries have prospered,
and prospering, have attracted able ar»
tisans.The skill, the talent will tend to
remain, as they have remained through
the passing generations until now. Why
does Brussels stand for carpets, and
Dublin for lace? Initial advantages have
drawn skilled labor, and the cities
through the centuries have become
noted for their products. Pittsburgh,
then, still in the strength of her coal and
her rivers, has gained and is gaining
added vigor from her able people.Coal
barges! And mills along the rivers!
And in the mills, men‘.

When Shady Avenue was Shady Lane,

Before the city fathers changed the name,

And cows stood switching ﬂies beneath the

trees,

And oldetime gardens hummed with dusty bees,
And white ducks paddled in the summer rain;
‘Then everybody drove to church,

And Shady Avenue was Shady Lane.

We lived on Arabella Street, that too

Is changed —- Kentucky Avenue —

And where the tollegate stood beside the spring,
The phlox and hollyhocks

Once ﬂourished by the box

Where the gatekeeper sat with key and ring.
A wiser looking man there never was,

In contemplative mood he smoked and spat,
‘There by the gate he sat

Only a few old hearts

In an old dog»eared hat
And listened to the yellow jackets’ buzz.

All this is gone —

Gone glimmering down the ways

Of old, loved things of our lost yesterdays,
After the little tollegate by the spring.
And the gatekeeper odd

Rests in the quiet sod,

Safe in the arms of God

Where thrushes sing.

Even the spring has gone, for long ago
They walled that in,

And its dark waters flow

A sunless way along;

And no one stops to wonder where they go,
For no one hears their song.

Of these much changed parts,

Whose time will soon run out on all the clocks,
Catching the scent of clover,

Live all the old days over

When Shady Avenue was Shady Lane.

NOT long ago when asked what Pittsburgh would do if invited to pick up her industries
and move them west, the answer came, “Carft go —— too busy." Pittsburgh always
has been busy, is busy now, and always will be busy.

Away back in the 1760s when there was a little wooden fort at the junction of the
rivers and one, or maybe two, houses belonging to the brave men who would risk a home
outside of the fortiﬁcations, a new discussion swept the colonies; iron had been found.
Iron in those days was precious, so precious that the king even promised rewards to en»
courage its production in the colonies. But as production increased, coal was needed, and
the nearer the ore beds, the better. One day, just as the red summer sun shoved its rim
over the rustling branches on the eastern hill tops, a little party of men left the fort on the
Point. With weapons slung across their shoulders they trudged on and on through the
brush where briars scratched at their leggings and tore their hands. Game was scarce that
day, and by noon the sun was pouring down through the wilting leaves so scorchingly
that the men were compelled to crawl into a shallow cave for rest. All around them lay
chunks of black stulf that glittered a little in the dull light. They examined it. It was coal.

Little by little,through the rest of that century, the extensive coal ﬁelds came to light.
Here was coal for the iron industry, and it was much nearer to the ore beds than that east
of the mountains. Soon ore was carted down to the river banks, and before long crude tower»
like structures belched black smoke. When the first furnace was tapped, the settlers
stood around and gasped to see the hissing red snake ﬂow out. The Revolutionary War
hastened the new enterprise, and, in 1790, the first permanent furnace was built where
Shady Side station now stands. Coal was handy, and ore was carted in over almost imv

{[19]}

passable trails. Team after team of thickrnecked
oxen tugged and strained through the mud pud~
dles and in the broiling sun to bring the ore to
the furnace. When the iron was chilled, the
artisans at the fort forged it into crude axles
and knives to swap for more coon skins. Some
of it they made into rough plows to rip the
tough sod, and some into tires to bind the
wagon wheels.

The new industry proved so successful that
it grew beyond individual efforts and a com~
pany was formed. One night in 1810, while a
winter wind howled around the corners of the
little cabin and made the tallow candle ﬂicker
and cast goblin shadows over the onions strung
from the rafters, a little group of men met
around a wooden table. They talked long into
the night until the candle guttered in the socket
and the log in the fireplace was onlya bed of red
coals. Out of this meeting came Pittsburgh’s
first iron company. The little furnace at Shady Side was too small now, for other points
both up and down the rivers were calling to Pittsburgh for iron. 50 they decided to move
down nearer the rivers, down which ore could be ﬂoated, and where the iron could be
shipped more easily. Together with the foundation of Pittsburgh’s river trade the company
started to build a steel mill down by the river where Joseph Horne”s store now stands.

While this mill was slowly coming into shape, more and more boats were being built
on the banks of the Ohio. Pittsburgh had already a boatrbuilding industry that was known
throughout the east. As early as 1794 a line of keel boats had been established between
Cincinnati and Pittsburgh, and in 1798 the President Adams, a sea-going vessel, was
launched on the Ohio. The story is told how one ship captain was arrested in Liverpool
when he declared his home port as Pittsburgh and the customs officials found it an inland
town.

Pittsburgh labored to get her ships and steel started, and once they were started she
was busier still. By 1813 the new mill, run entirely by one seventy—horsepower steam
engine, was ﬂinging smoke against the blue sky, and boats came and went with coal, iron,
and ore. Through the narrow streets, where muck from the last rain oozed along the gutters,
men and boys hustled along, shouting to friends as they passed.

Pittsburgh now had other interests than iron. In May of 1798 there had been built up
along the river a frame mill run by water power. To that shack teams dragged log after
log through the forest where creepers tangled over brush and made travel almost impossi»
ble. And out of that mill came roll after roll of yellowish paper that went into Pittsburgh’s
one newspaper, The Pittsburgh Gazette. There was no whirring press in those days, and
each copy was run oﬂ’ separately in a little room where the only light was a ﬂickering ﬂame
burning on the end of a rag soaked in grease.

With the paper mills came the beginning of one of Pittsburgh’s greatest industries, brass.
In the woody land around Lake Michigan a man found some copper ore. As Pittsburgh
already had most of the mills of the country, a load of the ore was ﬂoated down the lakes;
and ﬁnally, one dreary morning, a boatful bumped against the wharf on the Point. Like
true pioneers, Pittsburghers could use anything; little by little it was taken into the
mills, and soon Fort Pitt copper was on the market. Out of this copper came brass. More
and more copper came to our mills, until now there are ﬁfty brass foundries in Pittsburgh.

Just while Pittsburgh was busiest with her iron, paper, and brass work, a new enterprise
came in to make her busier than ever. A glass plant opened. Back in the old days there
was no glass in the windows. The cabins had just mere peepholes for air and riﬂe slits.
At night the rains beat against the oiled paper or skins tacked over the openings; the
winds made them crackle and rustle; and sometimes the paper split and had to be mended
in the coldest winter. What glass there was had to be carried over the mountains, and
the roads were so bad that it rarely ever survived the journey. Then one day a new mill
was added to the row along the river bank. A pile of white sand appeared, and more
smoke rose and hung over
the river. More and more
people scurried through the
narrow streets to the water’s
edge, dodging an ambling
cow peacefully chewing her
cud in the middle of a street,
and tripping over small boys
playing “mumbley peg" on
the board walk. Soon panes
of clear glass took the place
of oiled paper, and the win»
dows began to let sunlight
streak across the wooden
bowls on the tables. In the
factory, a gaping mouth ate
up the white sand and di»
gested it into aseething, bub» '
bling liquid. Bronzed men,

{[21]}

olke

 

 

 

their faces burned from the red heat and glare, stood from morning to night on a little platform
and blew glass bubbles on the ends of sticks. The bubbles took shape and became bottles
and panes and dishes that were loaded on boats and sent to the west. Each batch of glass
got clearer and clearer until at last the sun shone through the windows and turned the
apples, strung along the darkest rafters, a deeper red even in the rudest cabin.

All this could not go on without more people coming across the mountains. Every
day another covered wagon lumbered up into the city square where cows pastured near
Grant and Diamond.The new cities of Lawrenceville and Allegheny began to make cornper
tition for Pittsburgh. The narrow streets became crowded with burly men in working clothes,
school children, and ladies in bustles and hoops out looking for a new cap or the latest bonnet
from over the mountains. Then, too, traders from the west labored their way up the Ohio
to get supplies for the season and to take home to the women folks some new trinket or
vivid calico dress. The Pittsburghers of that
time, not unconscious of their growth, wrote
in the Gazette: “It is inevitable that Pittsburgh
become a great city and an industrial center.”

At last the railroads came, and Pittsburgh
went forward with a boom. Bigger mills, using
all the new processes and turning out an end»
less stream of iron, steel, brass, copper, and
glass, spread out over all the adjoining lands
until Lawrenceville and Allegheny were part
of the city. More new industries came to this
section, too, until now Pittsburgh is one of
the industrial centers of the world. If there
is anything to be made, just bring it to Pitts«
burgh. She is eternally hurrying, but as the
old saying goes, “If you want to get anything
done, ask a busy person.”

And what is more, she is planning to be
busier than ever in the future. Shall we move
west? No! We are too busy.

HEN the Cathedral of Learning raises its granite towards the sky,
the smoke and fog of Pittsburgh will gray its stone and blacken the
stretch of its walls. No one who has the ideals of the University in mind
ever dreams that, with the building ﬁnished, Pittsburgh will somehow

alter itself so that blue skies and cottony clouds will always lie above.
* * *

* *

After the Cathedral is completed, life in our town will go on, to all
appearances, much as it has in the past, unchanged in the externals of
living. The streets down town will be no wider; the fadtories will be no
less things of ﬁre and steam and roaring iron; the traﬂic of grimy barges
on the Ohio will still sweep west and south; the rumble of trucks and
trains and mills will still surge from the steel plants by the rivers; and
the lights of the ﬂaming stacks at night will still cover the blackened
sky. Life, complex, nervous, powerful, will go on much as it has in the
past. The transformation of the material city is not the province of the
college, although, it is true, as beauty comes with the building, the same
beauty may spread to our streets and houses and places of business.
But, for the most part, those who trust in the University must accept
the town and believe that, although it is not beautiful —— while it may
have its grandeur,— it is yet a good place to live in, a good place in which
to go to school and work and build one’s home. To be a good Pittsburgher
is to accept its mills, its nervous energy, its industry, and even some of its

dirt. The province of the Cathedral is not to effect a material change in our cityalthough it may

well do that. Pittsburgh will never grow better by comparing its crooked

streets with the

lazy boulevards of Paris or with the languor and beauty of Spain. The Cathedral of Learning
is concerned not with the physical basis of Pittsburgh but with the spirit that made Pitts»
burgh and with the people who are now making and changing it by living here. This is to say
nothing new, and yet it is to say everything. Cities are shaped more by the minds of their
dwellers than by the contours of the rivers or the shape of the hills or the established industry.

{[23]}

 

 1927 CM

Living men and women are the reasons for industries; in/
dustries are never, honorably, the shapers of men and women.

The Cathedral is concerned alone with the people, those
who want to know more of the world around them and their
probable place in that world. The relation of the school to the
city lies only in their mutual relation to human beings.The
mill and the boy; the boy and the school *- that is the con»
nection. And the vital problem is: how will the University
relate itself to the boy who must some day find his life‘s
work in Pittsburgh industry? The answer is no easy task.
First of all, the University must be more than a gigantic vor
cational training school turning out graduate oil engineers
and chemists and factory managers. That course of study,
getting men readyfor speciﬁc jobs and a specific salary,is poor
stuff if it does nothing for the student except to make his
hands more nimble and his mind more full of related facts.
The province of the University is to give that training --
to help a young man to make his own way after he leaves
school. But this education in the facts of a chosen vocation is
not the only thing that a university must do, nor is it the most vital of a university‘s obli»
gations to its young men and women. A man is not a chemist or a doctor or a teacher all
day long.There are hours when the business of his profession is left behind and he has time
to read a book or to take a walk or to talk to someone worth the trouble. And then a man
must know more than his profession; he must be able to understand ordinary men and women;
he must be able to see new places and look at strange things with a simple delight in the mere
fact that he is alive, and the day is full of sunshine, and the path through the woods is a good
path and the sticky mud by the creek is somehow pleasant to feel underfoot. There are winter
evenings when legal briefs and chemical formula: and lists of dates are no help to fill in
the hours before bed,when a man
may read if he has been taught to
ﬁnd pleasure in books. Then, if a
man will, old Scrooge drags his
crabbed feet through the fog of a
London Christmas Eve; young
Henry Esmond walks the green
terrace with the Countess; Tom
Sawyer dips his tanned heels in the
water of the Mississippi wharves;
and the Three Musketeers swag»
get through sunny France.

But there are serious things a
man cannot solve through his V0’

 

cational training alone, and these,
too, a great university helps make
easier when they come. The

achievements, that a young man dreams are going to be his, dwindle suddenly even before school
days are over.The ambitions that are spurious reveal themselves as selfrpride and selfrconﬁr
dence as a boy learns day by day in classes how much human effort has already gone before him,
how huge the problems of civilization are, and how humble must be the spirit of the person
who would, in the face of a splendid past, do great things in the dim future. This seems
like a melancholy gain, but it is a gain, and college gives it. To see your own powers and
abilities and worth in proper perspective with the rest of the world must be progress.
Specialized training cannot help the scientist in those moments when he is not a scientist
and is, instead, a perplexed human being struggling with defeat, or lack of faith, or fear
of his task, or lack of friends. University education, that sees its task as the delicate adjust»
ment of a person to the world he must inhabit, that can help give courage and under
standing to people who need it, and can give the ability to enjoy life, is genuine education.
Pittsburgh has been praised as the workshop of the world, but it is not certain that it has
always been a happy workshop. Industry, thoughtless of people, is a terrible mechanism
that breeds poverty and discontent and bad living. There has always been inhuman
concern with merchandise for its own sake, and the progress of such industry has always
been towards ruin, the whole world over. To give to Pittsburgh industry men and women
who are not wholly lost to the meaning of life beyond the fastory is a great work — Pitt's
to accomplish. That task is a gift, to which the Cathedral of Learning dedicates itself with
every line of its reaching beauty.

* * * * *

The fogs and smoke of Pittsburghwill take the new Cathedral and make it theirown; they
will soften its sharp lines and fuse it with the ground of this city as no builder can. The
new building will take the eyes of Pittsburgh from ugliness to beauty, from ﬂat common»
places to valuable achievement. The town will give to the school; the school will give to
the town. That is the true “give and take" that ought to occur when a university is
erected. In a like manner, in things of the spirit, the Cathedral of Learning will take into
its rooms native strength and honesty and ambition and will give out those good things
broadened by years of sincere
study, widened into a more un»
derstanding sympathy for the
people who live here, and will
give Pittsburgh the ability to
realize its own ideals.

The 11927 QW/ll

__a—a

Tift‘ e5°pz'rz't

SCHOOL spirit, or Pitt spirit, is a rather dubious thing to write about if only for the
reason that here at Pitt the quality is a rather dubious thing itself. The subject, too,
is worn thin; it has been much mulled over and talked about; it has been alternately
praised for its presence at the last football game or decried for its absence, till students
are likely to resent even the mention of the phrase“school spirit“and to be utterlyunaware
of its broad and general relationship to the University as a whole.
As a matter of fact, a “spirit" of any sort is an ambiguous and
elusive thing, and even such a seemingly “unghostlike” one as a
school spirit is no exception. Pitt spirit, whatever it is, can be
hedged in by no deﬁnitions. The only deﬁnite statement that can
be made about it is that it either exists or it doesn't. And as far
as most students are concerned, it doesn’t, and for them the matter
ends there. Perhaps this isn't fair. People are aware that a sort of
Pitt spirit, mild and somewhat weary, does exist. One goes to a
“pep” meeting, is exhorted at, accepts all exhortations meekly,
resolves to show some spirit, yells, a bit sheepishly, and leaves
the meeting wondering what it was all about, yet feeling virtuous
and self»righteous because one’s duty has been done. Or, perhaps
one struggles out of a football game, battered and hoarse, but
proud to be battered and more than proud to be hoarse, for these
conditions are the outward and concrete signs of the elusive
spirit. Inwardly, if the proper side has come out victorious, there
is a glow, a desire to slap the no less battered shoulder of one’s
neighbor, and to exchange colorful, if somewhat hoarse, greetings.
In fact, it is a ﬁne thing to do one’s duty, since after all one is more
comfortable for having done it; and it is a most interesting thing
to be hoarse, but being hoarse for the glory of the football team is
not only interesting but also noble. Thus, in a small way, one can
assume an heroic attitude and say, “I did my bit to win the game,"
and feel entirely happy.

These remarks are not intended to disparage football games,
or the feeling that pervades during them. No amount of talking
or writing about school spirit will make people who attend the
games stop their shouting. They enjoy shouting too much. But too
often, Pitt spirit is measured by the amount of noise a body of stu—
dents can make at a given athletic event. If the noise is a big one,
the school has a satisfactory spirit; if the noise is but a mere echo,
then the school spirit, in the words of the public, “leaves much to be desired.” All this
is true enough, but it is only part of the whole truth. Real Pitt spirit ought to be inclusive.
And right here, the proper question is “What ought it to include?” This is not so easy to
answer; at least after the statement made above that a spirit of any sort is an elusive thing,
one would be wiser, perhaps, not to attempt an answer. A constructive bit of criticism on
Pitt spirit might, among other things, say that, with a good school spirit, such a thing as

ll26]l

Quit ©1€F’t‘rl{n.@ Sumo sec

cribbing would be unheard of; it might say that students would show a proper regard for
property and not cut their initials on the arms of chairs, that they would show a proper
consideration for others and walk and talk quietly in the halls; it might even designate students
as “searchers after truth," who, above all things, desired—vaguely, yes, but beautifully
and earnestly—desired to learn and propagate the best that is in everything.

Perhaps a paper on Pitt spirit ought to say these things and much more, for all this
is talk and leads nowhere. But, as has been intimated before, there is a certain vagueness
in the quality as it manifests itself at the University which de—
ﬁes exactness of deﬁnition. Besides, most people, even if they
cannot phrase the thing for themselves, recognize the quality
when it does exist, and in this case, when it does not exist to
any great extent, most students are conscious of its lack of
presence. Very often people are heard to say that here at Pitt
there can be no real school spirit because there is no real cam»
pus life, that the buildings are too scattered, but that when
the Cathedral of Learning is built and there is a campus minus
steps and hills, with dormitories on it, then a mysterious
something or other shall emerge from somewhere or other and
enfold us all; and where before there was no school spirit at
all, there suddenly shall be school spirit, and everybody will be
most happy forever after. This, of course, is a matter of con»
jecture and remains to be seen. But do these people mean that
the Cathedral of Learning——in the baldest terms, a mere structure
of stone and mortar—shall have the power to make students
yell more lustily at football games, and that this sudden and
concrete development of the spirit shall stop the increasing dis»
satisfadtion students are experiencing with the rather artiﬁcial
school life? And do they mean that this building shall develop
in people qualities that never existed before, make poets from
clods, and high priests from ordinary laymen? The building itself,
of course, means much, but it is rather the people who will
give life to the stones——for all that the stones shall be very beau»
tiful to begin with—who will create whatever spirit there is in
them to create, nothing more, nothing less. And there is at this
University now a rare opportunity to create the inclusive spirit
it now lacks, and opportunity to do things. “It is not our fear
that we may do something wrong, but that we may do nothing"
——a wise motto, but the fear of doing something wrong, it seems,
remains a fear, and nothing is done. Students are in an attitude
of “watchful waiting"——waiting for something to happen, something that is sure to happen,
if they wait long enough and watch hard enough. And all the waiting these days seems to
center about the new building they shall one day have, which shall suddenly revolutionize
learning, and viewpoints, and many other things. In the meantime, the opportunity slips
by. It is indeed a ﬁne spirit that would conceive and build a Cathedral of Learning, but
it isamuch ﬁner spirit that would beworthy of animating the mere pile of stone and mortar
into the living symbol of the spirit which in turn created it.

E stood on the bridge and looked across to the hundreds

of lights ﬂoating in the air.Their standards merged into
the night, invisible, and the lamps were stately ivory moons,
slowly passing and repassing black trees that thrust slim tenta»

of a house, a white light swayed over the pitch below.

NIGHT

N one long line of ﬂame the sun goes plunging down, and a
sombre twilight ﬂoats earthward. The darkening sky obliter/
ates the trees, a few moments before streaked with gold, and
makes them silhouettes, etched clear and strong, their bars of
gray to be erased by the coming of night.Caught in the branches
of the trees, the wind whispers broken cadences, and :1 leaf falls
slowly, then swoops down with :1 soft rustle.

EVER since the days when Indians swapped coon skins with the settlers whose huts
clustered around the block house, Pittsburgh has been noted for its trading and
industry. Later, when artisans came, people began to give up what little agriculture they
had carried on for the more proﬁtable iron and steel industry. Black smoke began to curl
out of crude blast furnaces, and red»hot ingots began to glow along the river banks. Pitts’
burgh is reaching now the peak of her industrial development, but with this is coming
another peak —- a peak of culture, art and education.

The industry of Pittsburgh may be world/famous, and people may commonly think
of the dirt that goes with it, but only a few really consider the beauty of it all. Banked
along three rivers are mills in a never—ending line. Have you ever stood on the bluff above
"Teaberry Gum" at night and watched the ﬂaring mills and the rows of lights stretching
off across the dark hills? Have you ever watched crimson ﬂames lick against a murky sky
and send a shower of sparks dancing over the river where lights sparkle on the ripples
behind the river boats and barges? Who has not seen bowls of liquid ﬁre spill down to the
water's edge, hissing and spitting lavender ﬂames? If you have seen all this, go stand on
Brady Street bridge at night and look up the Monongahela. Watch the orange ﬂames
ﬂicker from tall stacks that point up from the river to where golden lights ﬂare and die against
a cloud bank. It all seems to be as weird a beauty as if Mime and his gnomes were behind
it, forging the Rhinegold or spinning hair for Loki.

And these mills produce almost as precious as the ring from the Rhinegold. Heaps of
red ore fade into the steel that makes the battleship. From these hissing furnaces pour
forth the steel that builds the cathedral and
the cables of the suspension bridge; from piles
of sand comes the crimson and opal glass
of the cathedral window and the lens that
brings the stars nearer; from rows of coke
ovens come the dyes to make the delicate pinks
and greens of the ball dresses. From Pitts»
burghis laboratories, too, comes the radium
that is surgery's new weapon. Behind this
is wealth, almost untold wealth. If all the
silver dollars ﬁnancing these industries were
stacked up, one on top of the other, the pile
would be many times higher than even the
Cathedral of Learning.

The University with this behind her, has
still more before her, and Pittsburgh is up
holding Pitt to the utmost. The mills give
their strongest steel to raise Pitt's towers into
the sky; the citizens give of their wealth to
bring stone from the mountains to reenforce
the steel. Far above the smoke of the mills,
the fogs that hang over the rivers, and the

l29l

 

roar and clang of traffic, will tower the Cathedral of Learning, a little city within itself,
for there thousands of boys and girls will climb the stairs with their faces ever turned up»
ward. And there, year after year, more sons and daughters of these newcomers will rap at
the door to be admitted to the magic circle of learning. There a corps of teachers will train
young minds to go out to work not only for a bigger and better Pittsburgh, but also
for a bigger and better world.

From this city on the hillside will come the trained workers that drive ahead. From ber
hind the long stone tables of the laboratory will come the chemists who will wipe rust away.
From the school of whirring wheels and roaring furnaces will come the miners who will
dig out of the earth her ores and her oils and her innermost secrets. From the midst of
coils of electric wires will come the engineers that build the power to run our trains,
light our cities, and guide our mail planes through the night. In Pitt’s laboratories men
in white uniforms will work almost day and night under bright lights to distil from smoke
some new pastel tint. Out of rows of many colored test tubes will come new perfumes, and
the secrets of the silk worm will be copied. Heatless light, as cold and pure as moonlight
on a frosty night, will shine forth from the laboratories to light the world. Men in white
coats, peering through microscopes, will ﬁnd little bodies that bring health or sickness.
The industry will furnish the material and the workers for the University, and Pitt will

give the mills the scientiﬁc direction that they need. Some people say the schools are too
theoretical and the world too practical. Then, with the two working together, a perfect
balance will be reached.

Shall we say that a time is coming when capital and labor can work harmoniously
together? It is inevitable. To the man who never had a chance, the fact that his children
are educated with the sons and daughters of his employer is a new experience. To the
employer, worker with millions rather than hands, the fact that his children associate with
and ﬁnd value in the sons and daughters of his employees is also a new experience. Under
the inﬂuence of a common symbol and common learning, their differences must melt
away. And their children, learning cooperation in the classroom, will learn cooperation
in their work. They will have interests beyond their job; they will be tolerant of the
family who lives next door; they will be tolerant of the man whose racial background
is not theirs; they will try to appreciate other
cultures, other civilizations than their own;
they will read for pleasure and enjoy the beau-
tiful things of life that cost so little and yet
cannot be paid for. Slowly, perhaps, the mis»
takes that come from ignorance and misunder»
standing will become less and less, until men
will live rather than exist.

To those who call us dreamers, we give
but one word—“Wait!” The world marches
on and Pittsburgh is a leader of the host.

IF I were an East Side hack cartoonist trying an “impression of Pittsburgh by one who has
never been there,” it would be in half»tones and undertones.'It‘ would look like De-
cember dusk in Greenland, but it would be labeled noon. It would be full of people with
sootrsmearednoses (Pittsburghers always have sootrsmeared’noses)"hustling in and out
among busy chimneys; brawny, muscular people with ﬁve«hundred candlepower search»
lights in one hand and a couple of steel girders in the other. There are jails for .those who
refuse to manufacture, and hospitals for those who refuse to hurry. There is a special
asylum for poor unfortunates who once too often couldn’t ﬁnd parking space in the busi
ness streets for their cars. These streets are mere crevasses inhabited by “big bosses"
who hold the world's nonvstop “stogie” consumption record while directing the “working
class," which, by the way, excels everybody for industry, up to date, except the Chinese.
Finally, a part of the picture, yet somehow apart from it, its head well above the clouds,
stands the skyscraper university building with a Freshman walking the Sophomore plank
out of the forty~second story window, and the head of the Astronomy Department on the
top, looking through a special glass at the moon. Such is the conventional idea of our city.

But this same cartoonist, when introduced to the real thing, would forget all about the
‘‘impression.‘’ For there is something strangely beautiful in Pittsburgh. Have you ever lost

yourself in it, spent days wandering about it blindly and aimlessly to find that out for
yourself? Watch it at morning, at noon, or at night, when its streets are darkened with
thousands of specks whirling through alleys and avenues; see its Joseph's coat change
in never»ending color patterns all through the day. A

~ I have seen it in the early morning, when the first gray bars merge with the yellow ﬂush

in the East, and the sun rises swiftly and steadily on a summer day. There comes the

clangor of the city, and the deep, full—throated bellow of many noises. Higher the sun
rises, and louder the din. Pulsating roar of a thousand shops; shuffling, marching, stamping
feet; clap, clap of rolling street cars and autos; shrill, futile voices; pop and slam of doors;
bizarre, mystical color patterns—all mounting in a tremendous crescendo which rises in
wild orchestration to a quivering, molten«iron noonday sun. Have you ever gaped at the
city at noon, and seen its slim skyscrapers, their geometric line leaping with nervous,
ecstatic grace, as they belch forth indiscriminately their stenogs and bank presidents,
clerks and bookkeepers and bosses, who scurry like brightly colored ants to clubs and cafes,
restaurants and onerarmed joints? They all return instantly, dive back into their burrows,
and leave the rhythmic monotone of the city behind them. It is a monotone that never
ceases; but at night it is only part of romance; for at night the city is romance. Velvety
brown strokes of darkness obliterate the harsh and ugly, and the city has become a jungle,
strange and beautiful; and, high above it, its million of tiny red, yellow, and golden
lights prick and sting a black sky. And below is the monotone of life, at morning, at
noon, at night, and always—the city's accompaniment to its own chant of beauty.

HIRTY Juniors, members of the staff of the 1927 Owl, met one

evening last fall, not knowing the importance of their meeting.
The row of lights of Schenley Park was misty with late fog before
the Juniors left, but after long disc Jssion a ballot had been taken—
for the Hall of Fame. “Not activities alone," the Juniors had said,
“nor scholarship. Both are important. But how about personality?
Does this man impress you? Is this woman attractive except in
appearance?” And so the discussion had lengthened, and the lists had
narrowed down until the ﬁnal Vote—but that was secret; only three
were to know the results before the Owl appeared in June.

Now for you is the secret opened; ten men and ten women are
placed on these pages; twenty Seniors nominated for the Hall of Fame.
Not sports, nor clubs, nor scholarship alone has secured their see
ledtion; all these, it is hoped, and a certain charm, a certain magnetism
besides—that subtle Virtue of personality. Twenty Seniors have
been given the highest honors their fellow students of the class below
can give; they are worthy of the University and of Pittsburgh.

Tradition

Tradzfzbn

THE average college student, a mythical personage himself, does not believe that a
Headless Horseman rides at night through Sleepy Hollow. Nor does he credit the
newborn legend of the West, that the Grand Canyon was cut out when a giant miner
dropped his pick. But some people do, some members of the legendary masses.

Perhaps, then, it is because the students of the University of Pittsburgh, being cultured
and cynical, never stoop to such stupid drivel that there are so few traditions here. But
probably it isn"t. Most people, wise and unwise, like to preserve some of the customs
which lent their charm to the glamorous past.

Most college students like to sit on a Senior fence when there is one to sit on. Pitt,
though, doesn't have a Senior fence. In fact, even the long forbidden sacred walk and
Bridge of Sighs have come to be openly violated. And the new Freshman is likely to
miss the typically collegiate atmosphere of ﬂapping trousers and shaker sweaters with
now and then an afternoon in the dimness of chapel.

He may ﬁnd, though, in time, something unnoticed before. He may learn that when
the campus moved to Oakland in 1909 most of the old traditions fell out of the van on the way.

And yet it is quite certain that traditions are growing at the University of Pittsburgh.
The sweepstakes, Freshman Week, the Pepper Prize, the Hall of Fame—promise to be
enshrined with the already sacred Prom. And the Frick Acres Barn, with the Pitt Players
building a set in one room, the Panther chuckling to itself in another, in a third the Weekly
investigating a new clue, and in the last the Owl perched in a swivel chair waiting for in»
spiration, has taken on the air of Greenwich Village. And so it goes. Our tradition has not
yet developed into pajama parades or red wagons. But neither have the trees along the drive
grown into thickrboled maples. There is hope; worth while annual customs are increasing.

Qftudentl Q§°elf- government c/fryoctkztion

VOTING favorably upon a plan presented by Omicron Delta Kappa, the undergraduate
men of the University established, in the spring of 1924, the Men’s Self«Government
Association, which began work the following autumn. The organization consisted of
four faculty members and twelve men students chosen from schools and activityrgroups.
The intention of its creators was that it should occupy the same position to the men in
the University as did W.S.G.A. for the women, and that the two bodies should cooperate
through the already»existing Student Council, a committee of two men and one woman.

During the year 192445’ it was found utterly impracticable to continue two such
organizations with such feeble linkage. Various remedies were proposed and tried, and
ﬁnally it was decided to abolish M.S.G.A. and create a new body which would be superior
in power to W.S.G.A. in all affairs concerning both men and women. Four members of
W.S.G.A. were to be elected by that body to seats in the new organization, which was to
be called the Student’s SelfrGovernment Association. In addition the president of W.S.
G.A. was to serve as vice»president of S.S.G.A. The four faculty members who had pre»
viously had voting powers recommended that these powers be given up, and that only
students be allowed to vote. The plans for the new body were ratiﬁed in general referendum.

Diﬂiculties were experienced by S.S.G.A. at once in the fall of 1925. None of the men
elected were members of the previous body, and proper records had not been preserved.
After establishing itself, however, the board called several pep meetings, the only ones
held, and managed a successful football parade and bonﬁre. It supervised the singing of
Christmas carols one night on the lower campus. Later a number of discussion groups
on the World Court were held under its direction.

S.S.G.A. undertook direct management of Pitt Week this year. An attempt has been
made to vitalize the student singing by staging a contest for new songs and by publishing
a song book.

A committee was appointed to manage the men's vocational conference and to study the
problem of vocational guidance in general; ﬁndings are to be reported to S.S.G.A. at the
end of the academic year. The old Student Life and Interest Committee was renamed the
Student Relations Committee, and with the consent of the Administration, made sub’
sidiary to S.S.G.A.

An appropriation was granted S.S.G.A. by the advisory board for expenditure on speake
ers for general assemblies. A committee has been working all year on this matter, but
has experienced diﬂiculties in getting speakers because of its late start.

Three other lines of work that are important were begun during the winter. One was
the revision of the constitution, where plans are being considered for better representation,
more efficient rules of business, and the possible establishment of a student court. A second
is connected with curriculum; a committee will study for several months matters such
as examinations, the system of grading, dishonest practices in quizes, and the causes of the
last. A third has to do with extracurricular activities; a study is being made of the de»
sirability of the point scale idea and the best system for its enforcement. While the last
two lines of activity are being carried out by committees whose power is purely ad’
visory, it is thought by all concerned that this sort of thing is perhaps the most important
work student government can do.

THE undergraduate women of the University govern themselves through the Women’s
Self~Government Association. The purpose of this body is “to foster a spirit of unity
and loyalty to the University, to maintain high standards of academic and social life by
increasing the sense of individual responsibility, and to regulate all matters pertaining to
the student life of its members.”

W.S.G.A. was founded March 3, 1920, to replace the Women’s Activities Association,
the old governing body for women students. Its first president was Rose Fine, College, ’2r.
It is governed by three branches: the legislative, executive and judicial. The power of
each branch is vested in a committee made up of representatives from the four classes, the
Alumnae, and each school, in conjunction with faculty advisors and the Dean of Women.

W.S.G.A. is active in numerous ﬁelds. It maintains the Student Loan Fund, from which
any needy girl may borrow. It is concerned with the proper use and equipment of the
women’s rest rooms in all the University buildings. It assists the Dean of Women in
arranging and conducting annual Vocational Conferences for the women students, as
well as supervising housing standards and conditions.

The Queftion Mark, the official publication of the organization, which appears at least
four times each year, was put out this year under the editorship of Katherine Rowell,
College, '28. It summarizes activities and gives information to new students. The handbook
for women students,Vade I\«fecum,which appears annually upon the campus, was edited
by Lucy Kennedy, College, ’27. It also gives useful information to new students.

Many social activities are conducted under the auspices of W.S.G.A. Lantern Night
is held every fall to acquaint the Freshmen women with the customs and traditions of the
University. The organization sponsors “Open Houses” for all University students. Book
Teas are held monthly at which prominent persons speak; Sherwood Anderson stands
out among the notables this year. Teas are given annually to the various classes. The
Senior Breakfast given each spring in honor of the Senior women is another important
social event conducted by W.S.G.A.

THE Dental Student Council was first organized May 4, 1925. It consists each year
of the president, vice president, secretary, and treasurer of each class, and a repre»
sentative for every ﬁfty men in each class. It also has a representative from each student
activity, and five faculty advisors appointed by the Dean.

The purpose of the Dental Student Council is to promote the moral, intellectual, social,
and physical welfare of the students of the School of Dentistry. The Council has direction
over all activities of the Dental School, including all legislative and advisory matters per»
taining to its students. It is felt that this council will be a means of putting across to the
students a closer relationship between the student body and the faculty, and to cultivate
a greater interest in Dental Student activities.

Several additions to the constitution have been made. Discussions were held about
Cap and Gown ticket distribution, and this year the Dents will all sit in a body at the
show.This will enable them to get as many good seats as the rest of the student body.
The Council is making further plans to see that the Dental School is represented in
all University functions in the future.

They are planning to organize boxing and wrestling teams; the basketball teams have
been under way this past season.

But boys, here is the best news of the Council. Start now to save your money and
begin looking around for the “Girlfl the Council is planning an annual Dental Ball.

HE good old trarla time of the year, spring, was come; the ﬂowers that
bloom in May were blooming, the weather was incomparable —’tis
true! such a sky, such a sun’. —-and the end of the spring term was
only two weeks away when the third annual Pitt Week began, May
20, 1925. The committee had been appointed early in February. There
were George M. Durshinger, general chairman;W. S. G. McKee, busi»
ness manager; John V. Watkins, J. Wray Connelly, Robert Fleming,
Martha Schmucker, James Walsh, Charlotte Beachler, W. J. Dunford,
F. C. Coulter, and Jeanne Muter, committee members.

WEDNESDAY afternoon the Freshmen and Sophomores started the program with a push-
ball contest on Ruskin Field. After about forty minutes of strenuous pushing (“Very rude
to push, ever," Mother said,“and awfully warm for the boys'.“), time was called and a score
of 3, to 1 in favor of the Freshmen announced by the referees. A tug of war between Dental
School and the School of Business Administration followed the pushball contest.This was
won, not without a struggle, by the Dents, who had the advantage, in the beginning, of
more practice in pulling things anyhow. Twenty»one fraternity houses threw open their
doors for the annual Migratory Dance in the evening. The houses were wonderfully lighted
and decorated, the music was good, “double«shuflling" was the vogue and everyone had a
jolly time going around everywhere and seeing everyone else.

* * *

ON THURSDAY afternoon a May Day Festival was held in Carnegie /Music Hall, at which
Miss Anne Schaab was crowned Queen of May. A gay spring play, “The Trimplet,”
was presented in honor of the new Queen. In the evening a Varsity Night program was
given by some of our campus celebrities. Vaudeville acts, readings, and songs of all kinds
were presented; and a forgotten line or a quavering voice were greatly enjoyed by the
appreciative audience, which didift miss a thing. With the soft, sweet twirring of violins
or whatever it was, a gang of hearty campus girls dashed across the stage and danced a
classical dance. The audience howled. It was most surprising to ﬁnd ﬂowing draperies,
soft music, slow movement, rhythm, and grace in the cored, whom one usually sees only
rushing in and out of classes or up and down the hall. "Fancy, fancy," murmured the men.
“Sweet fancy!” sighed Mother. Fancy had a big part in the Comet Solo given by Jimmie
Murray and Obie Durnell,
too. We have yet to hear
Jimmie on the comet, or
obie either, for that matter.
Among the other acts were
an Apache dance and a
clown skit. It was a pretty
rough clown act, however;

 

   

we hear that Archie Laird almost
broke his thumb,whichwas most ane
noying—most annoying! Nine men
were tapped by Omicron Delta Kap»
pa, honorary activities fraternity,
after which the audience was sent
home, the program being concluded.
Dear audience! It was ready to go
home, nearly worn out with clapping
time and accompanying singers and
a lot of other things.
* * *

FRIDAY was the big day. Early in the afternoon everybody
lined up along the boulevard to get a good View of the races. It
was a warm day and there was a big crowd. The atmosphere
was made considerably warmer, however, with the appearance of
The Pittsburgh Roast, a burlesque publication of Sigma Delta Chi.
We remember several of the articles. There was something about a Blew girl or was it
a blue girl. And a lot of news in the Marriage License column. Headlines were lurid;
scandal and dirt were approved, but only in a friendly, laughing way. ‘Twas the spirit of
comedy and ridicule, tra»la. First on the program came the girls’ scooter race, and it went
fast. Scooters of all sizes and shapes were entered in this event, which was won by Miss
Dorothy Russell, of Kappa Alpha Theta fraternity. The girls’ rollerrskating contest was
next. (Why, we should like to know, don’t men enter these things?) Miss Nina Johnston,
also a Kappa Alpha Theta, won the first place in this event. The famous Interrfraternity
Sweepstakes were won by Pi Lambda Phi. Oh, that was the event! The machines were
made from scooters, old bicycles, and kiddie cars which the boys had been stealing from
all the neighborhood kids for the last few weeks. The whistle was blown and all these
handsome cars started gaily down the street. Frank Keely came smiling through the first
rush, pushed by a few of his Phi Gamm pledges — or was
it a few of those Phi Gamm football men? At any rate,
they pushed too hard around the turn. A few wheels came
off, and the car stopped. Several other cars piled up on the
Phi Gamm one.They stopped, too. Pi Lambda Phi managed
to get through ﬁrst, with Phi Kappa and Kappa Sigma
placed second and third. Meanwhile all the little neighbor»
hood kids had gathered around the wreckage at the bend,
sobbing and yelling and claiming stray wheels as their own.
It was a touching scene!

Friday evening the Pitt Week program came to a close
with a University dance at Duquesne Garden. This was
the largest dance held at Pitt since last Pitt Week; and
a great deal of care was taken to secure order, the crowd
being limited strictly to Pitt students.

73111‘ 1'72 #26 Tropic;

NE of the most interesting of the years achieve»

ments was the establishment of research classes

in Zoology at the Tropical Research Station at Kartabo,
British Guiana.

Kartabo is placed in the heart of the largest and
leastknown jungle area in the world, about -3 degrees
north of the equator.

Dr. Samuel H. Williams, Professor of Zoology, who
was in charge of the work, accompanied by three stu»
dents, left early in May for the tropics.The ﬁrst stop
was New Orleans. From there they went sailing
on the Carribean, bound for Georgetown. Tropic
seas, connoting romance and beauty and adventure,
were all that could be expected. They had the ad»
venture when their ship collided with a fourrmasted
schooner one dark and stormy night. Of beauty and
romance the boys don‘t—or won’t—say much. They
drifted down through the West Indies and along the
coast of Venezuela, through waters historic, famed with the names of Drake, Cortez, and
Morgan. To keep up the scientiﬁc aspect of the trip, they grappled for sea»weed and
trailed nets for pipe ﬁshes, sea horses and marine crustaceans. Occasionally they played
they were whalers and threw harpoons at porpoises. No great mortality among the por»
poise tribe is reported, however. At Trinidad they visited pitch lakes and exchanged har»
poons for cocoanuts, to throw at alligators. Dr. Williams went lizard hunting: he jerked
some dead leaves from a palm tree, and disturbed some red wasps.The boys maintain that the
professor outdistanced them all in his mad rush for the ship.Moral: don‘t disturb red wasps.

At Brighton they witnessed aweird medicine dance,
which lasted for several hours.The moon was full that
night. And as the circle of onlookers murmured an
unintelligible chant. the woman danced until she fell
from exhaustion. The party stayed in Trinidad for six
days and would have stayed longer; but time and
British steamship lines wait for no man, so they ﬁnally
landed in Guiana.

After securing supplies and servants at Georgetown
they crossed the Demerara River to Vreedenhoop.
There they boarded a miniature railway and travelled
for eighteen miles through rice, cocoanut, and sugar
plantations to Parika on the west bank of the Essequibo
River, The river is only fourteen miles wide at this
point. Parika marked the end of land travel, and from
then on they had to use the government steamers. As
the boat moved on into the interior, signs of human

 

ll88l}

habitation gradually diminished and
only a few scattered huts of the natives
marred the jungle which lined both
sides of the river.

After an all day trip on the Esser
quibo, the boat turned into the Maza»
runi, and after a few miles it reached
His Majesty"s Penal Settlement. From
there the party had to travel in its own
boats and canoes; jungle travelling be»
gan in earnest. When the scientiﬁc
equipment, supplies, and baggage were
loaded, they proceeded up the Maza runii
with the aid of outboard motors, to the

mouth of the Cuyuni River.There, on the
river bank, at the junction of the two rivers,

stood the laboratory, facing
the river and surrounded on
three sides by the jungle.
The station itself pre»
sented a variety of life.
Friendly creatures such as
tarantulas, termites, scorp~
ions, murine ’possums, and
lizards were numerous. Lit»
tle padrfooted Gecko lizards
curiously poked their heads
from the crevices and
cackled like chickens. Ma»
guire, of Georgia, leaped for
one and triumphantly

yelled,“I got him"; but all he had was a
writhing tail which the animal had shed
in order to escape. According to reports,

variations (imagine taking a sloth's temperature) in the threertoed sloth, bamboo growths,
life histories of certain moths and butterﬂies, cannabalism among certain snakes, and so
forth, were made. The party found toads that carry their young in pouches on their backs,
tree frogs of green and scarlet, snakes that travel from tree to tree, lizards without legs,
ﬁsh that leave their ponds and roam about in the jungle, blind snakes that burrow in the
ground, damsel ﬂies six inches long —— and thousands of other interesting forms.

Meal time was always interesting. They never knew if they were going to have alli»
gator steak or fried monkey? How would you like a nice roast leg of baboon? Lizard con»
somme is an excellent entree. If they didn’t care for any of these, there were labas, iguana,
and agoutis to pick from; and, of course, there were always native fruits and vegetables.

The rivers were full of interesting kinds of ﬁshes, among which were the Perai which
are dangerous, and the Biara which has two teeth in the lower jaw that are so long that
they extend through holes in the top of the head. Catﬁsh weighing over one hundred
pounds and fresh water ﬂying ﬁsh were common. Dr. Williams tried to capture a puny
ninerfoot snake, peaceably sleeping in the river. All it did to him was overturn his dugout,
lash his face, and almost drown him. Behold the vidtor (pictured here) presenting his
trophy.

The Indians of the region still hunt and ﬁsh with blow guns and bows and arrows. They
were not always friendly but were never hostile. Some of them eat ants and insedt larvae.
Nice people! They were very obliging about posing for pictures, and some of the boys
even visited a nearby village.

The summer went by, all too quickly. Just about the time that they were getting ac’
customed to cork helmets and mosquito netting and “snakes” liver and bacon" the
word came to pack up. Once started, the time went slowly
enough till they were back again in the “States," back with
a coat of tan, some marvelous photographs, and a willing»
ness to talk about their “adventures" in the “jungle.” Our
chief regret is that we couldn’t go along and have something
to talk about. But seriously, the party must have had a
wonderful experience and the University should be proud
of its giving such opportunity to aspiring zoology.

SUCH a thing as a “Campus of the Seven League Boots" is a twentieth century reality,
and anyone who has a good receiving set can be in on it.The boots that such a campus
dons are light, fairy things, travelling through space and carrying their load almost around
the world. By means of the University Studio, the University has extended its campus
over the whole of the United States, and farther, to South America, Africa, and Europe.

The 1925,1926 season of broadcasting from the University studio was opened on October
5 by Chancellor Bowman, who gave a talk on “Spare Moments." Thereafter, ﬁfteen
minute programs were broadcast every night in the week except Saturday and Sunday,
as a regular part of the KDKA evening entertainment.

The program for the year was arranged according to the types of broadcasts which
seemed to give the radio listeners the greatest satisfaction. Mondays were known as
Book Nights, the programs consisting of book reviews or of readings and discussions from
standard literature. Tuesday evenings were devoted to series of a cultural nature; Wednes»
day evenings, to the science series, which proved remarkably popular among high school
students all over the country. Current Events talks were scheduled for Thursdays, and
special features, usually by student organizations, were given on Friday evenings. Monthly
Health talks were also given, by members of the Medical School. Among the special
features broadcast were concerts by the Glee Clubs, plays by the Pitt Players, and a
Christmas Eve entertainment. Mayor Kline, Chancellor Bowman, Dean Manley, and the
Honorable James Francis Burke made addresses from the University Studio during the
Pittsburgh Forward movement sponsored by the Pittsburgh Chamber of Commerce.

No credit was offered for this phase of University work, but for those who wished
something more than just listening«in, Radio Publications were issued in connedtion with
talks that came in series of six or more. These publications usually appeared at the con«
clusion of a series. They
contained the talks exactly
as they had been given
over the radio, together
with lists of reading ref»
erences for supplementary
study. So any student on
this “Campus of the Seven
League Boots,” who missed
a ledture, could simply write
in to the Studio for a copy
of it.

THE barn of the old Frick estate, now known as the Shack, the Student Union, the
Weekly Dump, the Panther Hole, the Owl Shanty, etc., is the dilapidated little
ediﬁce back of the Retail Research Bureau on Frick Acres. With the building of the
Cathedral it may not be here much longer. Many are the scenes that have enacted them»
selves in the shabby little retreat since the days when it housed the aristocratic Frick
horses and cows. The horses and cows have been replaced by the Weekly, the Panther,
and the Owl; the occasional chicken that used to stroll into the barn, by a cored painter
from the Pitt Players; and the stray goat by the ticket seeker hunting Loewls Aldine passes.

A wealth of tradition has grown up around this sprawly old leanrto. Here, after the
day’s work is done, the Weekly, Panther, and Owl staffs, like mischievous groups of over»
grown school boys who have rigged up imitation oﬂices for themselves out in empty stalls
of the old barn —- oﬂices almost like the real thing — gather together and play in serior
comic earnestness at putting out real, honestrtorgoodness publications. Pitt Player artists
all dressed up in smock and tam, paint industriously at scenery for the next play. The
business staffs of the three publications bring in ads and collect actual money just like
real barons of industry. The whole place swarms continually with busy, happy students.

On Monday nights, the little Weekly office, ﬁlled with smoke, laughter, and the clatter
of half a dozen typewriters, is a scene of wild confusion. Articles are written and revised;
news pours in from all parts of the campus; reporters go out and in on last minute assign»
ments; and, amidst all the noise, phone calls are shouted out at the top of hoarse voices.
By six o'clock most of the staff has cleared away, and only seven or eight workers remain to
put the paper together. At seven, someone goes out with indeﬁnite pecuniary contribu«
tions and vague instructions concerning “something to eat." On his return, the whole
office is at once up and in arms, and the riot continues until the last morsel of food has been
eaten by someone it didnt belong to. The work goes on into the “wee sma’ hours" until
all the news is revised and assembled and all the heads are written. The Weekly staff,
at last, adjourns with sleepy “good nights” as the various members turn homeward.

Across in another stall are boxes of Pitt Players tapestries, costumes, curtains, pictures,
and scenery. Miniature sets lie around on the boxes. Student artists make most of the
scenery, paint the pictures and tapestries, and arrange the sets.

Then there is the Panther oﬂice, with humorous magazine covers pasted all over two
walls and a recently repaired window through which the Weekly staff snoweballed the
occupants at the last snow fall. Here jokes shake the very sides of the little barn with
laughter. Caricatures and comedy are turned out by the bale. And the business part of
the work goes on: contracts, advertising, exchange with other magazines, collections —
all back in a stall of the old barn.

And of course there’s the Owl oﬂice, with its desks and typewriters and piles of copy.
Here a third group of students work for months on the Junior year book. Material on all
the campus organizations comes in a steady stream. The staff works all year assembling
the book. . . . .and here is the result.

No other building on the campus has more traditions grouped around it than our
miniature Latin Quarter. Only the thought of the Cathedral can reconcile us to the loss
of our playhouse.

UST how to give yourself an artistic pat on the back in the most graceful way is indeed
a problem. To make your own write/up is, similarly, a rather ticklish proposition.

Other organizations conﬁdently leave the matter in our hands, reasonably sure that we
will say some nice things about them. But for us to tell the story of our Owl:

The first thing in order is to introduce the Family Circle —- the Staff, you know. Don
Brown, editor of the 1926 Owl, suggested names of those who he thought would be capable
of editing the 1927 book. Acting on his suggestion, an editor~in»chief was selected by a
committee composed of Mr. Hoehl, Mr. Gould, Mr. Harrison, Mr. Gow, and Don him»
self; the winner of a contest in which those competing their ideas as to what the latest
edition of the Owl should be, Mr. Lee —- Alfred McClung, to be exact—was given
the honor of guiding its destinies. Then the Assistant Editor»in»Chief and the Literary
Editor and all the Associates were picked. If you care to know who they were, see page
118. Alarge staff of Sub’€d1t01‘S and assistants and apprentices was slowly gathered together
and organized. The matter of bringing up the Child, or Owlet, if you will, in the way it
should go was considered. .

What was the Owl to be? The general theme of Industrialism, formulated in Leels
elevenrpage outline, left much room for difference of opinion. Finally, after much argue
ment, Elwood and Lee sneaked into the Blind Department of Carnegie Library one
day, and fought out between them the deﬁnite ideas of content and form and makeup.
An earthquake was recorded in Italy that day. These ideas were published, in pamphlet
form, to tell the campus what the Owl staff hoped to do, the first time an advertising
broadside was ever published in connection with a student activity. Here are some of
the things it said:

“It is going to be a University
Annual. Its interests will be the
interests of the University, its
Alumni, and its friends. It will
be of a type worthy of the dignity
that the word, university, has
come to connote.

“It will be dedicated to the
thing from which the inspiration
for the Cathedral of Learning
came, the Industrial Spirit of
Pittsburgh. To carry out this in»
dustrial theme, a unique type of
art work has been developed. It
will not be expressed in the con-
ventional kind of ‘collegiate’
drawing but by a conception of
genuine artistic power, carried
out by students under expert su»
pervision. This theme will be so

{[961}

applied as to bind together the entire
book into one symmetric whole."

On Fridays the whole family
would meet at the Ruskin for
luncheon to discuss writeeups and
call~downs and progress in collecting
material. These weekly luncheon
meetings were later transferred to
the Sigma Chi house and supple»
mented with Wednesday evening
meetings. Sigma Chi's neighbors
thought that representatives from
a matrimonial bureau were calling for
dinner. But we had nice chaperonesl
Social activities, however, didn’t take
up all the time. Most of the State
Hall people found that out when the
Owl oﬂice had its little nook in 104.
The Panther and Weekly discovered
it, too,when the office was moved to
the Barn in Frick Acres, thanks to
Stone and Webster. Every day during
the 'tween semester vacation the en’
tire Owl staff had to report for work.We didn’t have a time clock, but we kept a roll book.
We had only one worry; we were afraid that Elwood and Lee would starve to death because
they never had enough time to eat. Frank Curtin ﬁnally devised the plan of hiding a cracker
under his coat when he left the cafeteria and bringing it down to divide between the
two. Curtin‘s happy thoughts more than once have saved the day. Lee put a sign on
the wall—“Wanted: 30,000 w0rds"——and daily he reduced it by a hundred or so 'til it
was most all gone. And so the stack of copy in the ﬁling case grew.

There are one or two things we have omitted in this growth of an Owl. The story of
the pictures is, and rightly should be, a feature story. Early in December, the photographer
arrived from the White Studio, New York. Working with him, Crane Remaley did the
remarkable thing of setting up a studio in the stadium. By the end of January all the photo’
graphs had been made and all the proofs had been returned. Materialwas ready for the printers.

“Page ﬁve ninety—three,” says Lee. “What are we going to put on it?"

“Here's a picture,” says Elwood.

“Page ﬁve ninety/four," says Lee.

We hope you will not think 1927 Owl an unpleasant child, not to your liking, or a vain
one, straining for effect, or anything else like that. There are lots of things on which
you could have helped us. Many people have spent many nights bringing up the Owl,
trying to make it as full and wise as a wellrbred bird should be. You may read every line
from cover to cover; or, what is more probable, you may read only your own fraternity,
club, or dance news. You may not like our pictures or our stories, think our sections silly.
We hope you won‘t, of course, but some of you will; and people will go round campus saying
how much worse than usual is this years Owl. We try to take it philosophically.

T IS one of the idiosyncrasies of the people of today to delve into the Stygian mysteries

of the past, to open the closet and search the contents, be it either skeleton or coat of
arms. It is to cater to this taste that this article was written. (Whew! It was a hard job
making up an excuse for this article.)

Well, anyhow, years ago, before college comics drew their material from Volstead
and Percy Marks, in 1914 to be exact, Pittis jack»of»allrt1‘ades, George M. P. Baird, by
name, decided that the Pitt students ought to have a lot of things to laugh about and make
others laugh. Wherewith he called together the formidable gathering composed of the
intelledtual élite of the University; namely, Messrs. Sid Hoehl, Dick McDaniel,
George Ketchum, Louis Broido, and others.

At this meeting was born and fostered the idea of a humorous monthly. There was a
long controversy over the name of the proposed magazine. Finally the list of proposed
names was cut down to two: the Pitt Panther and the Piper. The vote stood 44, and the
gang was in a dilemma. (The preserved dilemma may be seen in the trophy room.) Finally
somebody woke up and made the vote 54 in favor of, well, you know.

The next question was to select an editor. This meeting was being held on November
25, 1914; the aroma of turkey permeated the corridors of Alumni Hall—-or what was to
be Alumni Hall six years later. The boys became restless, which is the same thing as
becoming hungry, and the result was that Sid Hoehl became the ﬁrst editor of the Pitt
Panther with A. B. Divvens, a Sigma Chi, as business manager.

Sid Hoehl put out four issues that first year, and to him goes the credit and esteem of
having given the Pitt Panther such a good start that through its subsequent history it

{[981}

neither ﬂoundered nor ﬂopped, which is a triﬂe
more than can be said of certain other things
started around here. All Hail to Hoehl!

Louis Broido succeeded Sid Hoehl with Eddie
Lavitz as his business manager. Louis Broido in
turn was succeeded by Ralph “Slicky" Emerson,
a Phi Delt. The momentum given the paper by
these early men sent the Pitt Panther on its
way merrily.

During the war, when everybody was ﬁghting
for some sort of liberty, including women, a Pitt
Co/ed, Beryl Pape, assumed charge of the editing
of the Panther. During her administration the
Panther went on the wane, which means the
same thing as going on a spree. While her erst»
while staff members went off to ﬁght for the right 
of freedom, she fought for freedom of the press. M01 3 {Mi 3’ NE; err E1: E; 
Her successor was not appointed due partly to
the loss of staff members on account of the war
and partly to the University censor’s unsympathetic attitude towards Beryl's efforts at
freedom of the press. During the following year, 1918, Pitt merely existed, for the Panther
was not being printed. The members of O.D.K. noticed the tragic decline of the entire
school's morale and accordingly got together in 1919 to reorganize the Panther and ap-
pointed Dick Love and Frank Maxﬁeld as editor and business manager respectively.

The remarkable rise of the Pitt Panther from those early days is a matter of common
knowledge. This year the Panther has reached its highest level both on and off the campus.
Allow me a word in its current history.

This year’s editor is Hugh J. Crossland; his business manager, Harold Kaminsky. The
innovations and improvements effected by Hugh J. are worthy of epitomizing. The issues
average eight pages more than the issues of previous years. One issue, a Holiday number,
was so impressive that it received national publicity. (We reproduce the cover to show
one reason why it did.) The school year saw the publication of ten issues, the largest
number ever put out by the Panther. As a step in developing friendly relations between
Pitt and Carnegie, a collaborate number was put out by the combined staffs of the Carnegie
Tech Puppet and the Pitt Panther. But the most notable achievement was the position
given the Panther by the Associated College Comics of the East as one of the ﬁve best
papers of the East, to say nothing of the office of Secretary»Treasurer given the Panther
editor, Hugh J. Crossland, as an appreciation for the meritorious service given the Asso—
ciation by the Pitt Panther.

The Pitt Panther is now an established institution at the University, and a complimentary
credit to it. May the ensuing years entail its preservation and development.

URELY no one doubts that the Pitt Weekly is the University's broadcaster of news and

a direct descendent of the College journal. As a student directory the Prom Pomvouches
for its extensive and elastic mast head. The Pom does so facetiously, of course, for some
forty staff members is not the number “in toto” of the last University registration. Another
aspect of its value as the college journal is the makeup of its masthead, somewhat after
the fashion of a student theme: Roman numeral one -— editorrinrchief and business man»
ager; Roman numeral two — body of theme—editors and managers; Roman numeral
three — conclusion—-the reporters who, we conclude, are responsible for the makeup of
the paper.

 

Fashioned as a newspaper, the Pitt Weekly contains news items, society announce»
ments, comment columns, humor, notices, advertisements, and above all, editorials.
After all, a newspaper is a medium of expression between the feelings of the readers and
the writers who endeavor to report or express such feelings. This year, due to the efforts
of Donald B. Brown and Harry W. Sack, who the first and second semesters respectively
deserved the name of Editor«in»Chief, the editorial column took deﬁnite place in the
Weekly and in the attention of the student body. The front page improved upon the
newspaper model in containing only news of clean, important interest. “Ooing, Ooing,
Chum" stars as humor material. It is a column “after these famous lines”:

“Once a pig mliceman
Saw a little lum,
Sitting on a surb comb,
Ooing ooing chum.”

This column serves as a student resume of almost everything in the way of local student
life, and human nature in general.

The alumni page is responsible for the copious mailing list which must be ﬁlled out
weekly. Again, as a college paper, the Weekly keeps the student body and the graduates
informed as to what each is accomplishing.

{[100]}

The questions and answers fostered by the Weekly cannot help but unite the opinion
and thoughts of the students. “Campus Comment“ and “Communications” bid fair to
hold their own as Weekly features.

Is it hard or easy to write and manage a school paper? Come to the Barn any Friday or
Monday and ﬁnd out. Fridays, the oﬂice overﬂows with reporters who secure assignments;
Mondays, the olﬁce overﬂows with reporters who are writing assignments; Monday
night, the editor overﬂows with suppressed emotion and nervous energy and drastic
resolutions in order that the paper may come out on time. The Pitt Weekly always has
done so. It probably always will, for surely with leaders at its head and with the cor
operation of its innumerable reporters, many of whom are Freshmen, and therefore tradt»
able, and with the growing interest of the student body, the Pitt Weekly will be a true
college journal and a worthy descendent of the College journal.

And yet the paper is still restless and dissatisﬁed. In the “wee, sma’ hours" of
Monday nights, when the nightmare of industry in the little barn reaches its height,
the editors conceive wild fantasies of future greatness. Next year, they dream,
the masthead will be stretched to make a complete campus directory. All incoming
Freshmen will become automatically members of the staff. Two more broken typee
writers will ornament the already crowded des s. Three more editorial positions will
come into existence. And then . . . . . then the Weekly will turn into a semi~weekly.
Soon afterward, the editor of the Weekly will take over the duties of the chancellor
and inaugurate his pet policies in the University. His election as president will soon
repeat the precedent set by the career of Mr. Woodrow Wilson.

About this time, the editor suddenly realizes that he must hurry if he is to get
home and back in time for his ﬁrst Tuesday class. The staff plunges feverishly back
into its work with the idea of a bi/weekly still in mind. They recover most of their sanity
before the next Monday nightmare, but they still look forward to two issues a week.

They look forward to other improvements, too. Sumptuous oﬂices on the ﬁftyrﬁrst
story of the Cathedral of Learning, genuine mahogany desks with three telephones on
each, beautiful stenographers with red hair and blue eyes, and, last, typewriters that
type, all eventually having places in the realm of that future Daily.

FOR the past few years the Pitt Players have formed the only serious dramatic elfort
on the campous. When Chancellor Bowman came to Pitt all studies in the ﬁne arts
were removed to Carnegie Tech. The Players are a relic of that happy time when the
University had studies in music and art and aesthetics as well as Engineering and Business
Administration. Handicapped at every turn, the Players have “carried on" under tre»
mendous diﬂiculties. With no theatre, no properties except those they made themselves,
hardly any place to rehearse, and little money, their productions are rarely appreciated
in the light of the troubles producing them.

Membership in the Players is strictly limited to those who try out on a selected sketch
before Mrs. Laurence I. MacQueen, the coach. Annually about a hundred people try
out for casting staff, from which about thirty are selected. Many campus leaders have
counted Pitt Players as their ﬁrst activity. Another boast of the Players, if they would,
could be their splendid spirit of cooperation. To the outsider the lack of friction between
the various parts of the organization is a revelation. In an activity where personal feelings
usually play a large part, the submergence of the personal element is remarkable. To
a disinterested person, knowing them, the credit is entirely due to their coach, Mrs.
MacQueen. Besides a close personal loyalty, the Players have given her their united
strength for the betterment of campus drama. Understanding both her material and the
individual student, beyond most campus activity leaders, she has taught not only the
mechanics of stage production and the elements of voice control, but that indeﬁnite thing
that goes to make up the ﬁne spirit of the organization.

Almost unnoticed by the average person who goes to a Heinz House production are
the stage and scenery. Never seen are the intricate electric lighting effects of the stage.
Everything is due to the ingenuity of Mr. E. Willis Whited. Four years ago, the prop»
erties of Pitt Players included a portable platform and part of a set of drapes. Now they own
one of the best portable stages in the country with almost a complete electrical equip»
ment. A peep into the Players technical room down in the Barn on Frick Acres reveals
an immense amount of material.

HE “Y" hut, which, during the last Christmas vacation, was felonously, stealthily,
and prayerfully embezzled from its former location on Thackeray Street and quietly
hidden down behind the upper dental building, has not yet been found by a few woozy
students who, in their college daze, were in the habit of wandering in only occasionally.
All the details of the affair did not come to light until the recent trial of the executive
secretary and his accomplices which has not yet been given out for general publication.
Ivl. D. Straney, executive secretary, D. B. Brown, former president, George Main, pres»
ident, and A. F. W. Randolph, who had been selling dictionaries in the hut when the
two were last seen together, were arraigned before Magistrate J. G. Bowman of Morals
Court and charged with the crime. They ﬁnally confessed that they had done it as a
practical joke on Jim Godfrey, famous “Y” cook, who had to sleep on the corner of Thack~
eray and Fifth Avenue for three nights before he found the hut again. Magistrate Bowman
ﬁned Secretary Straney ten cents to buy cough drops to cure the cold Jim had con»
tracted and told the culprits not to do it again.

The hasty removal and reconstruction of the hut resulted in several serious mistakes.
Due to criminal mismanagement on the part of those involved, a door missed its calling
and now serves as an ornament in the wall, twenty feet above the ﬂoor. The stage has
vanished completely, and some allege that Mr. Straney took it home for his sixryearrold
son to play on. The office and the lunch counter got separated so that the executive secrer
tary receives dozens of applications for hot dogs daily.The stoves are said to be hidden up
in a room behind the mysteriously suspended door; at any rate, the practical jokers had
an entire new system of steam heat installed. The tables became so shifted about that
they are now in very neat, orderly rows. The articles which the conspirators forgot in

their haste leave plenty of room in the main lobby of the hut and space enough for a large
conference room seating sixty people. After the committee appointed for the purpose
by S.S.G.A. has investigated the mysterious door, which has caused numerous strained
necks among curious students, the hut will be a greater success than ever, with Jim God»
frey’s cooking growing better every day, if possible, and the walls all repainted. (Some
maintain that in their hurry the embezzlers put the walls up wrongrside out and thus
gave the impression of fresh paint.)

A few days after the disappearance of the hut, Jim Godfrey discovered it and went to
work cooking hot dogs. The aroma attracted the student body from all over the campus,
and on Monday, February 8, the executive secretary gave up trying to hide the hut and
declared an open house at which free hot dogs, steam heat, music and a speech by J. Steele
Gow were plentifully distributed. The open house was one of the biggest events in the
fourteen years’ history of the Pitt Y.M.C.A. Hundreds of unsuspecting victims passing
by the upper dental buildings slipped and shot down the icy hill into the back door of
the “Y” hut much to the amusement of the hilarious onlookers. After being thus duly
initiated, each one received his assigned hot dog and a seat by the window where he might
see the next act in the continual neck—breaking performance.

Since then the hut has resumed its old routine: Cap and Gown tryouts, “Y” meetings,
social hours, suppers and the daily lunch. And though there may still be a few students who
haven’t yet found it, it has once more become the largest meeting place on the campus.

HE gala day was September twentyrﬁfth when the Women’s Athletic Association

sponsored the Cored Prom, unique in its lack of masculine accessories. Brothers,
fathers, friends, and sweethearts —— all had their clothes ruthlessly confiscated by daring
Amazons who, garbed in knickers, tuxedos, and plain suits, escorted the frosh to the
Heinz House. Kipling said, “The female of the species is more deadly
than the male.”]udging from the appearance some of the girls made, the
men have something to fear.The Freshmen renewed their childhood days
by dressing as babies. Some in rompers, some feeling natural in short
skirts, and still others industriously sucking peppermint sticks, were
initiated into their ﬁrst prom.

The feature of the evening was a mock wedding ceremony, unusual
in that the groom was not nervous but was strangely elated, being
an exception to most grooms. Emmajunge and Jessie Tufts were awarded
the prize for the best dressed couple. Mirth, frivolity and youthful exe
uberance reigned supreme, interspersed with shouts of laughter when
a particularly incongruousdooking “manll passed by.

THE Heinz House, that gabled, manyrwindowed bungalow against the side of the hill
above Alumni Hall, affords a hospitable welcome to the students and visitors of the
University of Pittsburgh, and at all times stands as a campus home for those coeeds who
feel dragged down by Alumni Hall classes. It is in the fall, however, that the Heinz House
literally throws open its doors to all the co»eds. Those co~eds just matriculating ﬁnd the
wide porch with its ﬂowered, cretonned wicker furniture a refuge and comfort from the
bewilderment of the registration ordeal. Behind the Martha Washington geraniums
and Boston ferns topping the porch railings, the new co~eds may sit and talk over fragrant
cups of Orange Pekoe with the older girls and with their big sisters. Inside, the light of a
lone log glowing in the fireplace, and touching with bronze and orange the framed Cathedral
of Learning panel over the mantel piece, adds warmth and cheer to the Heinz House
welcome.

Once each year at Christmas time the Heinz House has a Christmas tree, Christmas
toys, Christmas candy, and Christmas cheer, for the little children from Soho Day Nursery,
whom the Y.W.C.A. delight with a true Christmas party.

“Goin’ up to the ‘Friendship Factory‘ tornite?" is a question often asked on Monday
nights during the school year. To those unacquainted with Pitt customs, a Heinz House
“Open House” is a dance given through the generosity of some campus organization to
which everyone is welcome. The only requirement for admission is a congenial spirit.
One does not exaggerate to call it the “Friendship Factory.” It is the most democratic
feature of the campus. There both fraternity and non»fraternity people have a common,
social meeting/ground. As the roof is your introduction, it does not take long for even
the most retiring soul to get acquainted. Friendships started here have lasted through
college days and sometimes —~ beyond. Almost every new student on the campus blesses
it as a place where he, or she, can go and, meeting people indiscriminately, make friends.
And so, at 9 o'clock on some Monday evenings, when you see students in groups or in
pairs or singly going up to the Heinz House, you know the “Friendship Fadtory” is at work.

$00k Tea;

BOOK TEA is not like an or»
dinary tea, for, with tea and
cakes, there are books, and besides
the social atmosphere there is a
literary one. Six of these teas were
given by W.S.G.A. as a part of
their work this year.

Up to the time the Owl went to
press, two teas had been given. For
the first one, held December 20, 192 5 ,
Sherwood Anderson was secured
to add to the literary part of the
program. All students, particularly
female, agree that it was unconstitutional for anyone as unromantic and of the earth as
Mr. Anderson to be given such a name as Sherwood, that breathes all over of Robin Hood
and his Merryrmen, of poetry and adventure. Alas for Mr. Anderson! He has no more
ideals and illusions‘. He sees sordid life as it is. It is a tale

“Told by an idiot,
Full of sound and fury,
Signifying nothing."

Mr. Anderson is not quite aloof enough for that. His feet are in the earth. And on the
college campus he is out of place. He was out of place in the Heinz House.

The second tea was held on January 13. The literary ﬂavor was supplied by Dr. Hoyt
Hopewell Hudson, Professor of English at the University, who discussed the recent
novel, Soundings. Dr. Hudson's talk was very much enjoyed.

The principal characters in the story of the Book Teas are, of course, the speakers.
The committee in charge is next. And then among the guests we have numerous faculty
members and students. The English department turned out nobly. The Book Teas alone
have afforded the faculty and the student body an opportunity for literary discussion in
a social way. Their popularity has been an encouraging note in Pitt’s literary life.

HE annual Inter—Fraternity Ball opened the big season for forrnals——or the season
for big formals, if you will — of the University. It was held, under the chairmanship
of William Foraker, at the Hotel Schenley on January 15', 1926, from nine to two.

At ten o’clock Mr. Foraker and Miss Betty Anderson led the grand march through
the ballroom. Large shields, bearing the Greek letter insignia of the fraternities represented
in the Inter'Fraternity Council, decorated the walls of the Blue Room swung with bands
of gold and blue. At the head of the ball room, just beneath the large University shield,
Miss Anderson presented the favors to the three hundred and some couples. These favors

were little leather cases containing the names of the various fraternities represented and
the order of the dances.

“Bennie" Kreuger’s Brunswick Recording Orchestra had been secured to provide
the music. Throngs of enthusiastic dancers gathered around to hear Bennie do tricks
with his “sax.” Facing the orchestra was the microphone installed by Station KDKA,
broadcasting the latter part of the evening’s program. Music by the University Quartet,
singing several University songs not heard since football time and other popular numbers
was another feature. Between dances there was a general rush for the seats beneath the
palms, which gave a sort of Florida atmosphere, don‘t you know.

At twelve o'clock light refreshments Of punch and cake were served. Bennie swallowed
a few cakes, grabbed his sax, started to play, and dancing began again, to continue with
scarcely any intermission, until two o‘clock.

SOMEWHERE in the book the question is asked what Pitt would do if requested to
move wes;t.The Junior Prom committee must have misunderstood; they Very effectively
transferred us to Spain. The old Blue Room of the Schenley, scene of many college “affairs,"
was hardly recognizable with its hangings of red and yellow. From each of the panels
hung the quartered and barred ﬂags of Castile, Aragon, and Leon#but imprinted with
the Pittsburgh seal. Great fancy lanterns of brilliant blue and gold silk swayed on ropes
of smilax from the ceiling, while “Chubll Steinberg’s orchestra played from a Spanish
patio. Off to one side, almost unnoticed but contributing to the general effect, an oasis
of palms and ferns sheltered those chaperones and patrons who were not dancing.

While the atmosphere was Spanish, the traditional languor of Spain was missing.
Tambourine and castanets and guitar gave place to “sax” and banjo and “Sousa phone."

Tango and tarentella were forgotten while modern “shuﬂlers" with smarting shins cussed
the “Charleston." But the whole was but a setting for a single idea. “To the ladies,"
that toast, old as Ben ]ohnson’s sonnets, was the word of the evening. The men, somber in
black and dead white, collegiate in the sense that means the gentleman rather than the
bizarre boy, formed a contrasting dilutant for a ﬂaming host of color and beauty. Weaving
in and out, fusing and disappearing, were tints and shades, pastels and solid colors, to make
up a living rainbow. The languorous cling of Spanish shawls gave the make~believe world
a touch of reality. Velvets and chiffons and georgettes and all the rest of the things, that
a mere man only knows he enjoys but is hopelessly lost in naming, struck the fashion note
of the moment. To mention beauty is a task we leave to a worthier pen.

From ten o'clock, when Chairman Joe Gaynor led Miss Katherine Denny, gowned in
pink georgette with a gorgeous Spanish shawl, between the vine»draped pillars of the
ballroom entrance, the success of the Prom was assured. Down the ballroom swept the long
procession, weaving in and out in serpentine fashion, to receive their favors and programs.
In harmony with the general scheme were the favors, heavy Cordovan bracelets bearing
the university seal. In the hubbub, the excited buzz of “Is your program complete?"
seemed to absorb all attention. The senoritas»for—therevening gathered in knots, admiring
the favors, the decoratIons—-perhaps, themselves~—while the men moved to and fro
asking the general question. But a peep over the dark shoulders revealed quite a few 
on the White page.

Not to be forgotten is the dinner served at twelve o'clock in the main dining room. Two
services were necessary to accommodate the three hundred and ﬁfty couples. Remember
your hasty search through all your pockets for the check and the gasp of relief as it was
found in that last pocket? But why worry about such triﬂes? Beneath each plate was a

copy of the Prom»Pom Buzzard, as scurrilous and caustic as usual. Faces were interesting
as they found some comment On themselves or their friends.

But soon they were all back to the dance ﬂoor. (Did we say "all"?) Perhaps it was our
imagination, but was the music just a little more dreamy and the lights dimmer than
before? At any rate the laughter was a bit subdued and the “pep,” that marked the
earlier part of the evening, a little less. But two Olclock came all too soon. As the music
died away, the rush for the check rooms brought everyone away from Spain to Pitts»
burgh. February sixth was climbing into the sky as ﬂeets of "Yellows" and “Greens”
and Packards and Fords rolled away — home.

HE Inter»Fraternity Ball was in January, Junior Prom was in February, the fraternity

formals were in March — and along in April came Senior Ball. It was held at a gay
time of the year, the time when libraries seemed dark, when people liked to take walks
over campus, and when everything was gentle, and happy, the way it usually is in spring.
The end of college life for the seniors was very near then, and they were beginning to
feel gentle about a lot of things. They had repented of most of their sins and they wanted
to be happy those last few months. So every one was in the proper mood for enjoying
Senior Ball. Everybody wanted to have a good time, and it was the work of the committee
to see that they did. Music, decorations, programs, and favors committees were appointed
by “Buck” Templeton, chairman of the committee. The entire group was so well organized
that the program planned was excellent. The orchestra was of the best; the decorations
were lovely, and the favors and programs were clever; all of which served to make the
Ball especially enjoyable.

Most of the Senior class, of course, was there. Seniors, who had felt no obligation or
inspiration to go to Junior Prom, did not fail to go to Senior Ball. And those who had
gone to Junior Prom with a patronizing air, went to Senior Ball without it. The crowd
at Senior Ball was a little taller than the Junior Prom crowd. It was a little more sure of
itself, too, being a year older, and more familiar, the way people are at farewell dinners,
only this was a dance.

HE soundness and certainty in the term organization conveys an idea of system,
order, and deﬁnite development. An organization can only be formed with purpose,
thought, ability on the part of its members to master difﬁculties, and cooperation. It must
be remembered, too, that each group attempting to organize must be stimulated by a deﬁnite
aim, and, in proportion to its executive power and cooperation, must accomplish its purpose.
But an organization, no matter how altruistic and noble its aim, becomes a worthless
mechanism when its members are so combined and its divisions of labor so divided that
it needs president, Vice president, secretary, treasurer, a variety of secretaries, librarian,
and so on; not contented with such a leading force, it continues parcelling out the work
into committees. Hence, with seemingly every member serving in some important capacity,
it seems that the members of the organizations might be playing a game. Because only one
can be Farmer in the Dell, the others must be paciﬁed with minor positions from the nurse
on down to the cheese. Continuing the simile, when the poor cheese “stands alone,” the
organization has fallen apart; the bonds such as they were have severed; the Sir Galahad
Grail has been lost.

Just so with University organizations. The students make up the University as well as
the organizations to which they belong. The latter serve as University activities. A
corollary is stated in all geometry tests which reads: “The whole is greater than any of
its parts, and is equal to the sum of all its parts." A too great distribution of the special
phases of activities: scholarship, athletics, student government, student administration,
departmental development, over»balances the purpose of a Universityeducation. They
are but contributing fundamentals to the modern scheme of things of specialization in the
University, just as our groupings of experts are in the world without.

Cap and §0w7z

OME twenty years ago this spring, one thousand and one derby hats suffered severe

concussion of the dome at a certain ﬁrst night held at the Nixon Theatre. The carnage
in numbers resulted from an enthusiastic audience going into spasms of approval over a
play entitled “In Wupland," a vehicle which marked the birth of the University Cap
and Gown Club. The project was run under the guidance of Dr. J. S. Ashbrook, an in»
structor in the Dental School. The actors were chosen from his men students.

Derby hats have long since gone by the boards but Cap and Gowners still play to
full houses every spring. The organization has been extended to make its competitive
membership open to the entire male population of the University; a place in the cast
or chorus has become one of the most coveted campus honors.

“The Red Moon,” the 1926 production will go down in history as the most elaborate
and most efficient of any since Walter B. Edmundson has become director. The play ap»
peared at the Nixon Theatre, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, and Saturday nights, May
5, 6, 7 and 8, and Saturday matinee. But with all due credit to Mr. Edmundson we must
also give praise to the following: S. S. Hoehl, Gus A. Shnabel, Mrs. Gus A. Shnabel, Dr.
Earl J. Cox, Dr. J. S. Ashbrook, and Karl E. Davis.

After repeated “one, two, three, fours" and “four, three, two, ones,” the rough edges
get ﬁled away as the cast and chorus begin to work in clockrwork fashion as all good pro»
ductions should. If Gilda Gray could see these performances, she would abdicate her
exalted position to the ardent Pitt performers: the “exposure” is not along the same lines
yet the effect is, in some manner, the same. And this year’s production would put Eddie
Cantor and Al Jolson to shame.

The weird legend, “a red moon brings revolution to the kingdom," is interpreted in
song and dance numbers for Neuros, the sleeping king of Monomania, the tiny kingdom
situated “somewhere" in the Balkan peninsula. Tricked into a position that threatens him
with the loss of his throne, the king decides to make a virtue of necessity and surprises
his enemies by voluntarily abdicating in favor of the new republic. But he is not to be
counted out of the running as he announces himself as a candidate for the presidency.
The treacherous Paranox, the Prime Minister, leads the King’s enemies in the “campaign"
and induces the queen, who does not understand the situation, to announce herself as
“apposition" to the king. It begins to look very much like a family affair when the third
party arises and tosses the hat»band of the Crown Prince into the Presidential ballot.

Each candidate has an American "boss” who tries his best to campaign in the real
American fashion. This just encourages the family “spats" of the digniﬁed royalty as they
pull their best strings to win out in the coming election. All the stir about “campaign”
and “election" arouses the republic and raises the Monomaniacs to the point of civil war.

The situation is at a feverish heat on the eve of the election when the queen, with a
plurality of four, withdraws as a presidential candidate in favor of the Crown Prince.
Disgusted with the whole proceeding, the king also draws out of the race in favor of his
son. All came to a happy ending with the ﬁnal settlement of these political and domestic
controversies, and as the proverbial saying goes, “All’s well that ends well."

girls ’ glee Club

N THE fall of 1922,after a lapse of several years, the Girls Glee Club was reorganized by

Alpha Lambda Nu, now Mortar Board, honorary senior activities fraternity. Mr. T.
Earle Yearsley directed the club's activities. The main event of that season was the home
concert in Carnegie Music Hall which was held in conjunction with the Combined Musical
Clubs. In the spring of 1925, the club gave its first home concert in the Music Hall and
intends to have that the climax of each season”s program. That same spring the club gave
a concert at Erie, Pennsylvania.

The Girls’ Glee Club provides activity for University girls interested in singing and
also introduces the musical side of campus life to countless listeners throughout the country.

This year the club has given several radio concerts, has entertained at the Veteran’s
Hospital at Aspinwall, and the Irene Kaufmann Settlement, and as well has presented a
number of church concerts. The latter part of the second semester an exchange concert
was staged with the Girls‘ Glee Club of the University of Cincinnati.

Combined NJ)/Kusical Clubs

HE combined Musical Clubs is the oldest noneathletic organization on the campus,

and from its ﬁrst inception has been one of the major activities. At the present time,
membership is on a competitive basis, and because of this, the club has produced each year
a musical organization that is one of the finest in the East.

The Musical Clubs make more public appearances during the year than any other school
organization. They present on an average of twentyrthree concerts, including two trips
made to different places in the Tri~State district. Both local concerts and trips
serve to stimulate an adtive interest on the part of the members——to urge each one indie
vidually to do his best to make a highly successful club.

ALTHOUGH the Girls’ Debating Club was founded at the University of Pittsburgh in
October, 1921, it was not until the following year that a deﬁnite program was realized
when Marie Messer, Theresa Kahn, and Teresina Marino reorganized the group. The
first faculty advisors included Prof. F. H. Lane, Prof. Brosius, and Dr. Fisher. This year
Mr. Thomas M. Pearce and Theresa Kahn, of the English Department, are supervising
the work. The group has inaugurated a new policy of debating before high schools and
various women’s organizations. The teams met with Swarthmore and Westminster Colleges
the ﬁrst semester; in the second semester they met with Ohio State, West Virginia, George
Washington, and Cincinnati universities.

HE Pitt Band was organized under the leadership of Saul Sabad and the management

of Don Kirk in the school year of 1911»12, when the students and alumni of the
University felt the need of a student band and loyally subscribed suficient funds for the
purchase of the necessary instruments. The ﬁrst public appearance of the Pitt Band was at
Forbes Field, Saturday, October 14, 1911, at the Ohio~Pitt football game.

From that time until the year 191718 the band continued its growth and existence.
Then, after the interruption of the war, Gustav L. Schramm was secured as faculty ad’
visor and M. S. Rocereto as coach. In 1920 the Athletic Council adopted the policy of
sending the band to the annual Pitt—Penn game at Philadelphia. The first annual banquet
came in 1920.

During the year 192304 the band began to make a reputation for itself. It appeared for
the first time before a New York audience, at the Pitt»Syracuse football game, and the
New York Press spoke of it as the “finest student band that ever came to town." In Phila»
delphia at the Pitt»Penn game the band met with equally great success.

From 1920 until the present time the band has not only been known as the best football
student band, but has grown to an equal standing in concert work. In 1922 the first Annual
Home Concert was given. Since that time the band has continued to give one home concert
a year and several outside concerts. During the present school year the band has continued
its popularity under the management of Paul K. Stewart and with A. Lednum Plette as
conductor.

THE Men’s Debating Association fosters forensic adtivity on the campus.The policy
is not to make a limited number of good debaters, but to allow as many men as
possibly can take advantage of the opportunities that the University offers in this ﬁeld.
The English Department supervises debating and gives academic credit for successful
participation.

This year the scope of debating was enlarged, and various teams debated before the
high schools in the district to heighten their interest in the Inter»High School Debating
Contest annually condudted by the University. Debates were also held between Pittsburgh
clubs and organizations and the University teams.

The annual triangular debate was held between Pennsylvania State College, Washington
and Jefferson College, and the University. An open forum type of debating which interests
the audience in the question and not in the decision was successfully tried this past season.

Two trips of ten days in length were made this year by the association, the one to
Iowa, and the other to South Carolina. On these tours, at which many colleges were
visited, the two questions, “Resolved that the Federal government should own, operate,
and control the coal mines" and “Resolved that the states should ratify the amendment on
child labor” were discussed.

HE Young Women's Christian Association at Pitt broadens the spiritual side of a

College girl's life. Mrs. L. J. Gibbs, wife of the former head of the English department,

was inﬂuential in starting the organization on the campus in May, 1910. At that time
only ﬁfteen girls belonged to the “Y. W.’‘; now three hundred coreds are members.

Jean Donaldson attended the “Y.  convention in the summer of I919 at Dennison
University, and was the organization chairman the next year. They had little money;
accordingly, several “Y.  members rolled up their sleeves and after an afternoon of
toil in their mother's kitchen, had ﬁfty boxes of fudge and seafoam. This was sold in Thaw
Hall and two delegates were sent to a Student Volunteer convention during the Christmas
holidays at Kansas City.

During the next two years Helen Frost Dice, now wife of the University librarian, was
the president. The association inaugurated “Dairy Lunches" which they served in 105
Thaw Hall. On this occasion they made $40. Another of the early presidents was Florence
Teagarden, now assistant professor of psychology at Pitt. At this time the “Y.  was
still considered a side issue, and received no support from the faculty. Yet it had weekly
meetings and occasional socials, did social service work, and sent delegates to Eaglesmere.

In 1915 the only office the “Y.  had was a P. 0. box in the rest room in State Hall.
By the next year though they had one hundred members, ten girls teaching at Kingsley,
two Bible study classes, and helped support a teacher at Canton Christian College.

Now the “Y.  has a comfortable office in the Heinz House with Miss Helen Battrick
as executive secretary. The purpose of the association is “to lead students to faith in God
through Jesus Christ." Any girl in sympathy with this purpose may join.

Each year the “Y. W.” sponsors the Big and Little Sister movement, and organizes
commission groups among the freshmen coreds. Sixty girls did social work this year at
Soho, Kingsley, or Irene Kaufman settlement houses. Several teas were given during the
year for foreign students; and the World Court Conference was held in Pittsburgh last
November 12 and 13 under the auspices of the Y. W. C. A. and Y. M. C. A.

In the ﬁnance drive the Y. W. C. A. raised $1200. The remainder of the budget was
raised through the sale of candy in Alumni Hall and in the other campus buildings during
candy week.

All of the Monday noon meetings this year were devoted to Bible study and World
Fellowship programs. Ten girls attended the Bruce Curry Bible Conference in November
at Penn State, and twenty girls expect to go to Eaglesmere this summer.

Hebrew c/{vsoeiation

HE primary purpose of the Young Men‘s and Young Womenls Hebrew Association
is to promote the religious and social welfare of the Jewish students of the Univer~
sity. It is rapidly taking its place as an active Pitt organization and is doing for the Hebrew
students the same work that the Y. M. C. A. and Y. W. C. A. do for the Christian students.

This association is comparatively recent, organized at the close of the last school year.
Its achievements have been few, as its headquarters on Belleﬁeld Avenue have been
recently completed. During the week of dedication of the new building, a “Pitt Nite” was
held under the auspices of the student organization. A reception for the Freshman students
was held during the month of February. Pitt students participated in the oratorical con»
test held by the senior organization in the state of Pennsylvania.

C/ziron Club

HE Chiron Club is an organization composed of Pre»Medical students selected on

the basis of scholarship, character, and participation in college activities. It was
organized in 1922 and was ofﬁcially recognized by the University in May, 1923. It is the
outgrowth of the various prevmedical organizations which have been in existence from time
to time ever since collegiate work was prerequisite to entering the Medical school.

The aims of the Chiron Club are to stimulate and to foster interest and knowledge along
medical lines. It does this by having men who are prominent in the medical profession
and allied sciences address the club at frequent intervals. It encourages students who are
undecided to continue their work in the line of medicine. Although its membership is
limited, its interests take in the whole group of prermedical students, which is the second
largest in the college. Annually there is an inspection trip taken through the Medical
School, and there are various other gatherings throughout the year which are open to
all students. Time and effort is given to provide for the social welfare of their members;
dances and smokers have a regular place in the program of the club’s activities.

At present, plans are being formulated for the expansion of the club into a national
organization by its union with similar prermedical organizations in other colleges and
universities.

The 192/7 Qwl

Tzfézh G/ub

N JANUARY, 1914, when Dr. Elizabeth Martin, at that time the Dean of Women at

the University of Pittsburgh, requested Dr. Hugh T. Kerr of the Shadyside Presbyterian
Church to teach a small group of students, she little realized that she was making a sugr
gestion to Dr. Kerr which was to give him an opportunity for a religious work among
students the inﬂuence of which would prove both fapreaching and permanent. This is
the history of the origin of the Pitkin Club as read at the tenth anniversary celebration.

Pitkin Club takes its name from Horace Tracy Pitkin, an American missionary who
was killed in the Boxer Uprising of 1900 in China. It was the first organized religious
club at the University and aims to acquaint students with various mission ﬁelds and
their needs and to promote interest in Christian work. This year South America was
studied and several returned missionaries told of their experiences on the mission ﬁeld.

At the annual Christmas party this year for twenty poor children, Aubrey Wolford,
treasurer of the club, played the role of Santa Claus. Other members returned to “second
childhood" for an evening and delighted the little tots with games and songs.

Campus problems have also held the attention of Pitkin Club members this year.
Several meetings were spent in discussing the causes of cribbing in University classes
and the remedies that could be instituted against them.

ARLEZ»VOUS francais? Si non, vous ne pouvez pas devenir un membre du cercle le plus
vif de l’Universite. Si, oui, jouirez les seances du cercle francais. This year the club had
three meetings at which the programs were given by university students. Jokes and
anecdotes are really funny when told in French, and French music seems to possess special
charm. At another meeting Miss Beatrice Young, assistant professor of modern languages,
who just returned from a tour around the world, spoke about “Spain and Italy.” She
especially related her visits to the Alhambra, the Vatican, and the bull ﬁghts in Spain.
The French Club also inaugurated a traditional Christmas Party the past season. Miss
Elizabeth Schmid of the modern language department entertained with a Christmas
story, and Mrs. Joseph A. McCurdy, with several Christmas songs. A yulerlog was burned,
French games were played, and refreshments served in true French style. Then in January
M. Edouard de la Meilliaie, a student at Pitt, acquainted the club with the happenings
at French colleges. In France soccer instead of football is the collegiate sport.
A play, too, “Les Deux Sourds,” was given by the French Club. Not only students but
also the entire modern language faculty turned out for the play. This same spirit was
manifest at all the meetings.

Women ’5 Q/ft/2 letic qﬂssociation

THE Women's Athletic Association was formed primarily to enlist the interest of the
women students of the University in athletics. The founders hoped to provide in it,
too, the means of gaining experience in the management of these sports and in conducting
meetings. They aimed at the same time to promote scholarship and to foster school con»
sciousness and spirit.

How well the organization has fulﬁlled its aim its rapid growth will demonstrate. In
1919 two members of the varsity basketball team, Margaret McClenahan and Ethel
James, laid the foundations on which in 1921, when Miss McClenahan became an assistant
professor of Physical Education in the University, the present Women's Athletic Assor
ciation grew. Now, less than ﬁve years later, the association has about three hundred
members on its rolls. Under its present ofﬁcers, headed by Helen Lloyd, it is continuing
its progress.

Under the control of the Women's Athletic Association are the present teams: varsity
basketball, class basketball, hockey, swimming, track, volleyball, baseball, and tennis.
The successful players, in accordance with a carefully weighed point system, are awarded
numerals or letters at the end of each year. These various sports and their other events
are supervised by the Governing Board.

Among its other activities the Women's Athletic Association includes hockey rallies,
basketball rallies, “pep" parties, and a ﬁeld festival at the end of the year. But most promi«
nent of these social events is the famous Co»Ed Prom, to which upperclasswomen, in
their brothers’ Hickey Freemans, escort their beribboned “little sisters," the freshmen.
In this way the association adds to the traditions of itself and the schools. In this way,
also, has the growing membership been accompanied by the fulﬁllment of all the original
hopes. The Women's Athletic Association takes its place with the leading bodies of the
campus.

Cwens"

CI ‘HE duty of working quietly in the background at small and uncoveted tasks is promis»

ed the newly~tapped Freshman Cwen, and whether this promise is kept or not can be
attested by the many organizations which she serves —- even if it’s only waiting on table
at a class dinner. By the end of her Sophomore year every Cwen feels she could easily hang
out her shingle as an experienced waitress after having served S.S.G.A. dinners, Senior
Breakfast, Miss Amos’ dinner to Seniors, and all the others.

The Cwens feel that in these ways they are carrying out the idea with which a group
of Sophomore girls in 1921 started this fraternity for women who had distinguished them»
selves during their Freshman year in scholarship, leadership, and participation in activities.
Under the guidance of Dean Amos, these girls organized a local society called the Cwens,
derived from the Anglo»Saxon for “Queen," the members of which were to be active during
the Sophomore year only. The Cwens chose the sceptre and crown as the symbols of their
order. When an informal conference was called three years later, with other schools who
had Sophomore activities organizations, for the purpose of making Cwens national,
this pin was liked so well that it was adopted as national. Delegates from Miami, Missouri,
and Pittsburgh were sent to Miami University in May, 1925, where Cwens became a
national honorary fraternity with Pitt as Alpha Chapter.

The Cwen hat is worn on all occasions where Cwens act as a group, and during the
first few weeks of school as a sign to Freshmen who want help.

A Cwen and Druid Prom was a new tradition among the two Sophomore honoraries.
At the dance, held I'Iallowe’en evening in the Faculty Club, a Spanish artist gave several
feature dances.

Last fall the Cwens adopted “Alice,” a Salvation Army orphan. At Christmas time
they dressed like children and played games with her and four other orphans. “Alicell
received a Christmas present from every Cwen.

“I AM proud of having beena president of this organizationflsaid Alexander Graham Bell,

who served as national president in I891. A roster of the past presidents of the Institute
contains names famous throughout the whole engineering world. Norvin Green,
president of the Western Union Telegraph, was the ﬁrst president of the Institute, and
Frank B. Jewett, vice president of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company, was
president in 1922. Mr. H. E. Dyche of the University is a member of the A.I.E.E. member»
ship committee this year.

The local chapter, organized October 6, I915, holds weekly meetings with student
speakers, and also several social gatherings throughout the year.Only students in the junior
and senior classes in Eledtrical Engineering are members.

Three national conventions are held each year. The midwinter convention is perhaps
the most interesting, for it is devoted to the presentation of technical papers and to in’
spedtion trips to points of engineering interest. 8. A. Swetonic was chairman of the local
group this year, F. E. McTaggart, vice chairman, and L. M. Brush, secretary and treasurer.

THE Business Administration Association has had a varied history in the School of
Business Administration. The organization is composed, at present, of the Junior and
Senior classes and the Special students of the day division. It has a chest fund for special
purposes, and this fund and various social events are held for the beneﬁt of the members.
The biggest event on the social calendar of the school was the first annual Christmas
Party and Dance held just before the Christmas holidays at the Faculty Club. The ball»
room was decorated with holly, mistletoe, and a giant pine tree loaded with ornaments.
The music for this event was furnished by the Steel City Collegians. During the evening
a black face comedy skit was put on by Bob Ayars, of the Accounting department.

E raternalism

graternalzkm

COMRADESHIP is highly recommended these days: for the world, in a great Locarno;
for industry, in the cooperation of capital and labor—a spirit of brotherhood. More of
it might be tried to advantage; indeed, even in a university. An ideal school, like an ideal
world, would be a place of mutual helpfulness; and its graduates might startle some of the
moneygrasping, apathetic populace already at large. Unfortunately, ideal schools, like
ideal worlds, are millenial goals, somewhat scarce or nonexistent.

Student bodies are not brotherhoods — far from it; nor were they at the time when our
grandfathers in beaver hats escorted parasols through lilac gardens. Recognizing the sober
fact, as they sometimes did, those of our sires who had like interests drew themselves into“a
closer circle of Comradeship,” and fraternities appeared. “Fraternities,” they said, “should
be bands of young men (or of young women) linked as brothers (or sisters) for common
improvement.” And as such, fraternities would be ideal.

But, to repeat, ideals are somewhat scarce. Comradeship and clannishness are not far
apart. Common betterment, perhaps, but at the expense of others, of the rest of the school.
“Sure, I’ll vote for him; he’s my brother." “‘Why, yes, I have the very man —— fraternity
brother of mine." Even worse, these oldrtime comradeships might possibly descend to the
level of “gloriﬁed eatingrclubs," of young men who, careless of anybody but themselves,
feel social prestige secured with the pinning of a certain emblem on their vests. Other
people are so remote, anyway.

There are quite a few fraternities on the campus of the University of Pittsburgh. Some
of them, it is remotely possible, might not be ideal. If so, thzre might be, again it is re»
rnotely possible, some slight improvement.

The I nter fmtemity Council

HE Interfraternity Council, composed of two representatives from each of the seven»
teen leading social fraternities on the campus, maintains close relationship among the
fraternities, and brings the fraternities and the University closer together. ’

Each year the Interfraternity Council, with the cooperation of the Athletic Association
of the University, sponsors the Interfraternity Track and Field Contests and the Inter’
fraternity Basketball Series. The cup for basketball was awarded to Phi Kappa last year;
Sigma Pi ﬁnished first in track; and Pi Lambda Phi received the interfraternity sweep»
stakes cup. During the past year arrangements for Interfraternity Rifle Meets have
been made.

The annual Interfraternity Ball,which is always the ﬁrst formal of the college year, is
under the auspices of the Council. A series of Interfraternity Smokers are also given
throughout the year.

Semi~annually a silver loving cup, the gift of John C. Fetterman, former Dean of Men,
is awarded to the fraternity in the Council which has attained the highest scholastic
average of that year.

Rules pertaining to the rushing and pledging of men have been adopted by the Council
and are under its direct supervision.

LPHA OMEGA, local fraternity founded in 1914, was granted a charter, two years later,

in Delta Sigma Phi, international social fraternity. As Omega chapter the local group

was installed in 1916. When the United States entered the war in 1917 a majority of the

members of the local chapter entered the service, and therefore the chapter was inactive
until the fall of 1919.

Delta Sigma Phi has chapters at Pennsylvania State College, Cornell University, Uni»
versity of Pennsylvania, University of Chicago, University of Illinois, University of
Michigan, and University of California. The installation of a chapter at McGill University,
Montreal, Canada, has made Delta Sigma Phi international.

GAMMA SIGMA Chapter of Delta Tau Delta was founded in 1864 at the Western
University of Pennsylvania. It became inactive in 1871,was revived in 1877, and again
died in 1879. After being organized eight years the old Alpha Alpha local fraternity was
granted a charter in 1914.

In the spring of 1925 Gamma Sigma chapter purchased the home at 4712 Bayard Street

GAMMA EPSILON ZETA of Lambda Chi Alpha was installed at the University of
Pittsburgh in 1919. The local chapter was formerly called Omega Alpha Pi, a local
fraternity founded by six men in 1916. The fraternity grew so rapidly that inside three years
it had twentyrtwo active members, and ranked among the leading locals on the campus.

Since the installation of the national here the chapter has been very active in student
activities, as well as ranking among the very first in scholarship. Such men as Clyde Rowe,
first editor of the Pitt Weekly, and Frank Maxﬂeld, the ﬁrst business manager of the Panther,
were among the early members of the local chapter.

The present home of the chapter was purchased last year, and is located on Terrace
Street one block from the new Pitt Stadium. The alumni of the local chapter assisted in the
purchase of the fraternity home.

Omega 961271

T WAS the desire of Wayne Theophilus, J. F. Pearson, Russel Dixon, Graham Netting,
and John Watkins, who founded Omega Delta on April 28, 1924, that the fraternity
should esteem high scholarship as an achievement of just as high calibre as athletic prowess
or social prominence. The founders also felt that a fraternity should not restrict the in»
dividuality of its members and should afford each man counsel and discussion of his problem.
In order to prevent such mistakes as might occur through hasty rushing, it was decided
never to pledge a man until he had completed one semester's work at the University. An
average of “B” was laid down as prerequisite for pledging. At least one activity was also
speciﬁed as desirable for membership in Omega Delta fraternity. The initiation banquet
was held at the Ruskin dining room May 26, 1924.
Founders’ Day is always celebrated on April 28 by a banquet, attended by all founders,
alumni, and actives. A Fathers’ Day celebration is also held each school year.

HI DELTA THETA is one of the "Miami Triad” which is composed of the three
Greek Letter fraternities, Phi Delta Theta, Beta Theta Pi, and Sigma Chi, each of
which was founded at Miami University.

Iota, the local chapter of Phi Delta Theta, was formed by the absorption in 1918 of
Delta Sigma Pi, a local fraternity that had been founded in 1908 before the University
moved to the present campus.

The early expansion of Phi Delta Theta was limited almost entirely to schools in the
Middle West. Between 1869 and 1879, the fraternity entered many southern institutions,
and during the next ten years moved eastward, completing its nationalization.

U CHAPTER of Phi Kappa was organized January 24, 1921, by a group of Catholic

students and was known under the Greek caption of Psi Delta Chi. Two months
later the University granted recognition to the organization and in May of the same year
a home was obtained in the North Highland district of the city. At the opening of the
fall term in 1922 the young fraternity, imbued with a spirit of accomplishment, made rapid
strides in ﬁrmly establishing itself among the Greek Letter groups of the campus.

Application was sought with a national Catholic fraternity and in May 197.7. Psi Delta
Chi became Mu chapter of Phi Kappa. Shortly afterwards the fraternity purchased the
home it now occupies at the corner of Belleﬁeld and Bayard Streets. The acquisition of a
home in the very heart of the fraternity district gave added impetus to the zeal of the
chapter members.

The individual efforts of the local chapter, guided by the watchword “Catholic gentle»
men”, have ever been directed toward the fostering of a true fraternal spirit.

William A. Herron, who served as the first president of Psi Delta Chi, is now pracr
ticing medicine. “Eddie" O’Donnell is manager of the Wheeling branch of the Goodrich
Co. and "‘Bob" McGuigan is also in the “stogie city” with a steel corporation.

The professions of chemistry, physics and law have attracted other charter members.
Frank Murphy and Joe Baldus are in the chemical ﬁeld and Ed Thalte is physicist for the
Flannery Co. Tom Donahue has established a brokerage office in Wall Street while “Bill"
Blemmel is practising law at Johnstown.

at the University of Pittsburgh in 1912. The local, known as Gamma Sigma

fraternity, was granted its charter on May 6,1914. Among the first national fraternities

to charter a chapter at Pitt, Pi Lambda Phi was the first fraternal group at the
University of Pittsburgh to include Jewish students.

Mark Fisher, Louis Iampter Levy and Frederic M. Werner. Soon thereafter chapters
were installed at Columbia, Cornell, Harvard and other Eastern Schools.

I RHO DELTA, local social fraternity, was organized June 5, 1921 with twelve charter

members. These men, long associated in school activities, decided to establish a social
fraternity among themselves so that they might share their ideals and their social life.

authorities gave oﬂicial recognition.

In January, 1924, the Inter—Fraternity Council admitted the organization into the
conference. The next November the fraternity moved to its present house at 230 McKee
Place, not far from the Stadium.

J. Lloyd Mahoney, an instructor in ﬁnance in the School of Business Administration, is

the faculty advisor of the local chapter.

0 BAND together Jewish students of worthy character that they might spread the

doctrines of fraternalism, that they might themselves be beneﬁted and might bring
credit and honor to their college, Sigma Alpha Mu was organized on Thanksgiving Eve,
November 26, 1909, at the College of the City of New York. Not until 1913, was ex’
pansion to other schools attempted, but since then the number of chapters has increased
steadily. The local chapter which is known as Psi chapter was installed in 1919.

As an aid for fraternity coordination, a Regional Advisory system was introduced in
1920. It provides for a geographical grouping of the chapters into seven provinces, each
province headed and supervised by a regional advisor. The annual convention is held in
mid/winter and is attended by chapter and alumni delegates. At this time an executive
board is elected. The executive body, known as the Octagon, consists of eight alumni
fratres. Four are elected for a fourryear term; the other four are life members. At its first
regular meeting each year, the Octagon elects the supreme officers of the national fraternity.

Both Memorial and Founder’s Day are observed annually. It has been the custom for
the local chapter to hold a stag banquet each year, and a formal dance in June.

Sigma C/22°

BETA THETA chapter of Sigma Chi was formerly the Delta Kappa local. As the first
national social fraternity on the University of Pittsburgh campus it was granted a
charter by Sigma Chi on July 2, 1909.

Still possessed with a knack of starting things, the Sigma Chi organized the Inter»
fraternity Council several years later. The Panther, Pitt’s humorous publication, and two
social interfraternity clubs, Framasors and Turtles, are also achievements of members of
the local chapter.

The present chapter house at 165 North Dithridge Street was purchased in 1919 by the
Pittsburgh Alumni chapter. Although the membership of the local chapter dropped to six
members during the late war, the chapter was able to carry over and keep its charter.

Each year Beta Theta chapter gives a reception for the Alumni and their wives, and a
tea for their own mothers. A mask ball and an annual picnic the last week of school are also
included in the social program.

Hervey Allen, the well known modern poet, and Dr. J. B. Sutherland, head football
coach at the University, are graduates of the local chapter.

UNDED at Vincennes University, Indiana, in 1897, Sigma Pi fraternity remained a

local until 1909 when it consolidated with four other locals which were organized at

Ohio State University, the University of Illinois, Temple University, and the University
of Pennsylvania.

The local fraternity, Delta Upsilon Kappa, was founded in December, 1920. As Chi
chapter of Sigma Pi it was installed early in 1923. Until the fall of 1924 the chapter house
was located on Center Avenue, but at that time moved to its present site, 212 North
Dithridge Street.

HE Pumas Club, a local campus organization of students and members of the faculty
3 who were also Master Masons, became a chapter of the National Intercollegiate
Fraternity of Square and Compass on May 17, 1924.
_ Square and Compass was founded at Washington and Lee University in 1917 to provide
a democratic intercollegiate Masonic organization which would federate the various
Masonic clubs that have existed in American educational institutions for many years. Its
aim is to provide a college organization where members of the student body and the faculty
can and will meet on the same level, thereby promoting study and interest in the history,
symbolism, jurisprudence, and philosophy of Freemasonry.

SIGMA EPSILON was the name of a group of students in the Engineering School of the
University of Pittsburgh who organized in 1915. Although membership in this group
was first limited to engineering students, it later extended to students in all the schools,
and as a social fraternity petitioned Theta Chi, entering the national group as Alpha
Beta chapter in 1919. At Norwich University, which was formerly located at Norwich
but is now at Northﬁeld, Vermont, Alpha chapter of Theta Chi was established in 1856.

HETA DELTA PSI, a local social fraternity, was founded in the fall of 1920 to
provide a medium through which its members might more successfully strive toward
ideals of high personal character, good scholarship, and loyalty to their Alma Mater.

The fraternity was organized on December 6, 1920, ofﬁcial university recognition came
on February 2, 1921, and admission to the interfraternity conference soon followed.

The local chapter first occupied a house at 446 Amberson Avenue, but at the close of
the college year found it necessary to seek new quarters. A new chapter house was found
almost next door to the old one. They remained here only a few years and this last summer
moved to the new and commodious home located at 151 North Dithridge Street.

Charles A. Foster, the first vice president of the fraternity, is now assistant to Dr. Sieg,
Dean of the College.

SORORITIES, what a world of comment they can call up! They have been discussed at
faculty meetings and on the streets, at national assemblies and in private homes——
everywhere someone is ever ready to criticize. The strangest part of it all is that the
fraternity men, the members of the brother organizations, are first to talk. Frequently they
have asked, “What have you received from being a sorority girl other than gossip? Are
your sorority friends, real friends? Has the pin you wear been worth the price you
paid?" It certainly looks as if these men had been disappointed with their choice of a
fraternity and are trying to inﬂuence others. After all it all leads to this one question,
“Do the sororities accomplish anything?" Statistics show that the majority of leaders, either
in scholarship or in adtivities, are sorority girls. Whether this is brought about by the
sororities themselves or is the reason that the girls are sorority members, is a question.
They are still leaders, however, even though they remain in their sorority group.

Each year new things are tried; some are found wanting; others meet with marked
success; but because an innovation does not glitter from the start is no reason it should be
condemned. This year, as every year, we are trying something new—Second Semester
Rushing. Why not give it a fair try? Test it out thoroughly. Investigate each little defect;
and if necessary, eradicate it. So far there are many things to be said pro and con. The
sorority girl is given a better chance to become acquainted with Freshman girls—to see
them as they really are and not in the artificial light of rushing parties. It also gives Fresh»
men an opportunity to study sorority life that they may choose intelligently and not be
disappointed in their choice. A whole semester can be devoted to study, so that rushing will
conﬂict as little as possible with lessons. On the other hand many think that instead of
raising the scholastic standing of the girls by giving them an uninterrupted semester of
study, it is lowering these standards by devoting this whole period to preparation for
rushing. How true this may be is yet to be seen. If it is the case, surely we can see that
the girls themselves are defeating the whole purpose by not playing fair, being square, and
hitting the line hard.

Several years ago a council of sorority presidents was formed to discuss problems and
create a closer feeling among the groups. This fall a year’s program was presented. The
ﬁrst affair, a tea, was held at the Kappa Kappa Gamma house with Kappa Kappa Gamma,
Alpha Delta Pi, Alpha Delta Sigma, and Alpha Epsilon Phi as hostesses. In December
Kappa Alpha Theta, Alpha Xi Delta, Beta Phi Alpha, and Chi Omega were hostesses at a
bridge party. A dance at the Delta Delta Delta house was sponsored by Delta Delta Delta,
Delta Phi Epsilon, Kappa Delta, and Phi Mu. At the Zeta Tau Alpha house there was a
luncheon with Zeta Tau Alpha, Phi Sigma Sigma, Pi Beta Phi, Theta Phi Alpha in charge.
As a grand climax, a swimming party and a song contest have been scheduled. So far these
events have been very successful and we can only hope that in the future they will continue
to do as much good.

HE local chapter of the National Pan~Hellenic Association is an aétual governing body.
Under its care this year, Pitt girls have encouraged scholarship by strictly refraining
from first semester rushing. As much as the association encourages spirit and cooperation
in women’s activities, it has relegated these to their proper place in favor of scholarship
among women"s fraternities. Delta Zeta won the silver “Pan~Hel” cup last year with an
average of 81.74, just fourrtenths of a point ahead of Phi Sigma Sigma.
Pan’Hellenic‘s second accomplishment has been the fostering of better spirit among all
women of the University. Among the women’s fraternities, its regular monthly meetings

have been augmented by informal meetings to create a better understanding between the _

seventeen fraternity presidents. Women of the Freshman class were introduced to frae
ternities through ﬁve teas where they were entertained by Pan—Hellenic representatives,
and through two forums where problems relating to rushing and pledging were discussed.
In line with its “harmony" program Pan~I'Iellenic held three general assemblies of all
fraternity girls where fraternity problems were discussed by both students and faculty
members. On March II and 12 a fraternity conference was held which closed with the
Pan«Hellenic banquet.
The Pan-Hellenic Formal was held April 30 at the Schenley Hotel.

HE Adelphian Society of the Wesleyan Female College, Macon, Georgia, founded

the national fraternity, Alpha Delta Phi on May 15, 1851. Although its name was
changed to Alpha Delta Pi in 1905, the only rea.son for the change was that :1 men’s
fraternity had already established its title as such. Since installation, February 15, 1925,
Alpha Iota chapter represents one of the oldest national fraternities on the campus.

The next best thing to a fraternity house is a chapter room. This year, for the first time,
Alpha Iota has secured at 291 North Dithridge Street that substitute for a house.

As a remembrance gift, at graduation each Senior is presented with a pair of beaten
silver candle sticks engraved with the fraternity seal.

Alta G. Charles represented Alpha Iota at the national convention in Rainer Park,
Washington, July 1925. The national fraternity has begun to accumulate an endowment
fund of seventyefive thousand dollars to be a memorial to its founders. Elsie Thomson
and Mary Wortman are in charge of the local chapters contribution.

ALPHA DELTA SIGMA was organized in 1920 as the G.G.G. club with Emma Erk as
president. In March, 1921, the Greek name was adopted and the group was
reorganized as a local fraternity on the campus. Jennie Munro was president of the group
for two years.

Every fall the Alpha Delta Sigmas hold a Bacon Bat out in the country. Weiners, bacon,
and marshmallows are toasted over the ﬁre. After supper the fraternity orchestra, compos-
ed of mouth organs, xylophones, whistles, and jew’s harps, plays several selections.

Another tradition of Alpha Delta Sigma is Pledge Night, on which the pledges “take"
the actives to dinner. Last year the fraternity members were led on a threermile tramp
through Oakland. Up dirty alleys and down sidestreets they went. Even a visit to the
Police Station was made before ﬁnally they reached the place selected for the dinner.

Mrs. Taylor and Mrs. Starrett, charter members of the local group, are members
of the University faculty. Marguerite Atwater, a former instructor at Pitt, is consulting
psychologist at Morganza Training School.

ALPHA EPSILON PHI installed Nu chapter at the University through the absorp»
tion of Chi Gamma Theta, the local group which was originally formed in 1919. As
a national organization, Alpha Epsilon Phi outlines in detail a program of social service in
which all the chapters participate. In addition to this work, dental clinics have been
established in several of the large cities, notably in New York. These are supported by the
national chapter.

Although Upsilon chapter at Akron University entertained the second annual conclave
of the second province in December, 1925, Nu chapter was honored with the role of
hostess for the first Conclave which was held in March, 1925. The national conventions
offer a triennial opportunity for intercommunication of the chapters.

The local Nu chapter has also had the distinction of placing two of its members into
national ofﬁces: Edith Lazarus is now concerned with the exacting duties of Treasurer,
and Ethel Saniel is both Director of Social Service and Province Director.

Among the honorary members of the local chapter are Mrs. Enoch Rauh, president of
the Associated Charities of Pittsburgh; Dr. Luba Robin Goldsmith, one of the first women
to enter the Medical School of the University, the former medical advisor to the University
women, and the author of the recent Jewish opera, “East and West’’; and Mrs. Alexander
Silverman, chairman of various Jewish organization committees.

Annual Senior Day is observed in June by the members of Nu chapter in honor of the
Seniors and alumnae. The graduation gift to each Senior is a silver bar pin engraved with
the fraternity seal.

NFORTUNATE ﬁancés little know what they are in for when they become en»

gaged to a Beta Phi Alpha Senior. Every year, at a breakfast in the spring, the

aforementioned victim must present the fraternity with a huge box of candy. In case no
seniors are engaged, the committee furnishes a box of lollyrpops.

Beta Phi Alpha is the former local Theta Gamma Phi. It was installed as a national in
May, 1924, by Dorothy Osborne, national inspedtor from Alpha chapter, at the University
of California.

On each campus a Mary Gordon Holway loan fund is being established to help Beta
Phi Alphas go through college. Mary Gordon Holway is a Pi Beta Phi who sponsored the
organization of the national fraternity, Beta Phi Alpha. One of the chapter traditions is
Parents’ Night, which is held every spring. The actives entertain with an original play,
and the pledges give songs and a stunt.

Most of the alumnae are teachers in the vicinity of Pittsburgh, or in the larger region of
western Pennsylvania. Margaret Boyd is head of the English department at Bloomsburg, Pa.
Esther Noll is on the English staff at the University, and Louise White is taking graduate
Work at Pitt.

During the Christmas holidays, Hannah Bechtel represented the Pitt chapter at the
ﬁfth biennial convention at Southern Methodist University, Dallas, Texas. The University
of Southern California, the University of Minnesota, and Ohio Wesleyan University
were granted charters at this convention.

PHI BETA chapter of Chi Omega was installed at the University of Pittsburgh by
Mary C. Love on December 6, 1919. The group installed was formerly known as
Alpha Gamma Omicron.

The active chapter awards a prize of twentyrﬁve dollars annually to the woman student
who excels in the work of the department of economics or sociology. For a number of
years it has been customary for the chapter to give a tea dance to all campus pledges, both
men and women.

Phi Beta chapter is keenly interested in the National Research Fund instituted last year
by Chi Omega. In the same connection a book has recently been published and issued to
the public and is known as Human Conduft and the Law, written by Mrs. Mary C. Love
Collins, national president.

On January 25, 1925, a joint Memorial Service was held for Dr. Charles Richardson of
Finleyville, Nebraska. The service was attended by members of Kappa Sigma fraternity
from both the Carnegie Institute and the University chapters and by members of the
local Chi Omega group. Dr. Charles Richardson was an early member of Kappa Sigma and
the founder of Chi Omega.

ELTA PHI EPSILON, a national social fraternity for Jewish women, was founded

at New York University, March 17, 1917. The Pitt chapter was originally the
local fraternity, Kappa Upsilon Mu, which was recognized by the University on May
7, 1924. School recognition was followed by admittance to the Pan—hellenic Association in
October of the same year. On October 13, I925‘, Kappa Upsilon Mu became Delta Phi
Epsilon, and the University chapter was installed as Eta chapter.

One of the pleasant aifairs yearly arranged by the chapter is a picnic at Squaw Run.
Every summer groups of alumnae, actives, and pledges forget their collegiate dignity and
rush to the picnic grounds. There they go barefoot, wade in the creek, wear knickers, and
generally act like children.

This picnic is followed, later in the summer, by a swimming party held at a camp near
Oakmont. Swimming races, leap frog in the water, and “ducking” are part of the enter»
tainment. After the swim, a huge bonﬁre is built on the beach for an old/fashioned corn
roast.

After the excitement of rushing and pledging, a banquet is held annually at the Ritten»
house for the new initiates. One of the features of this occasion is a succession of stunts
by each new member. Last year an original song was composed extemporaneously and sung
by an initiate during the dinner.

ELTA OMICRON local was founded in 1913. Three years later it was granted a
national chapter in Delta Delta Delta as Alpha Theta chapter.

Since Tri Delta was founded in Boston on Thanksgiving Eve, 1888, it is the custom each
year for every member to wear a sprig of pine under her pin on that day. The alumnae
chapter gives a Founders’ Day Banquet each year the Saturday after Thanksgiving. About
the middle of April the active chapter always honors the alumnae with a Charter Day
Dinner.

Three of the Alpha Theta graduates, Viola M. Young, '16, Suzan Waddell, ’17, and
Auleene Marley Jamison, ‘I8, are now doctors of medicine. Mary Thompson Denman,

uary, I916. Nationally and locally, this fraternity has concentrated on scholarship.

BEFORE 1908 womenls fraternities were unheard of at Pitt. But in this year Helen Frost
Dice, Lillie Hagerty McNamara, Dale Findley Dunham, Anna Hopkins Moreland,
Marion Lindsay, Mary McKean Bailey, Anne Roessle Ramsey, Marie Monroe Wright,
Marie Scikenberger, and Ida Hattman started a local fraternity, Pi Theta Nu. For eight
years they existed as a local fraternity, and then they became Alpha Omega chapter of
Kappa Alpha Theta.

Every year an enthusiastic alumnae tells the pledges about the early days of Pi Theta
Nu and Alpha Omega, and about chapter customs and traditions. Hazel Keffer Peden has
done this for the last few years at an informal supper given by the chapter.

TheThetas also have a fondness for silver spoons. At the Senior Dinner, every year each
graduate receives a silver spoon, with her name engraved on it. The active girls give this
gift at the fraternity house during June Commencement Week.

XI CHAPTER of Kappa Delta was installed at the University of Pittsburgh on March
13, 1920, twentyvthree years after the founding of their first chapter at Farmville,
Virginia. Kappa Tau Mu was established at Pitt for the purpose of petitioning Kappa
Delta and of doing social service work. Since that time they have pledged their permanent
support to the Crippled Children’s Hospital in Richmond, Virginia, as a tribute to the
founders.

The Kappa Deltas spread Christmas cheer by annually getting up a basket for a poor
family. They assemble gifts of clothing and toys for the mother and four children, then
they ﬁll the basket with all the embellishments of a Christmas dinner. The most delight
comes when they go to the home of this family and see a little crippled boy pull out a
toy automobile, a top, or a fur cap.

Beatrice Young, of the local chapter, is now assistant professor of Modern Languages
at the University. She has recently returned from a trip around the world. She visited
the Alhambra, the Vatican, and Canton Christian College.

Kappa Kzppa gamma

AMMA EPSILON chapter of Kappa Kappa Gamma was established at the University

on February 21, 1919, when a national charter was granted to the members of
E. R. 0., a local fraternity founded in 1916. In commemoration of the installation of this
chapter, the fraternity yearly holds a birthday party on February 21 to which all actives
and alumnae are invited. Their fraternity periodical, “The Key of K.K.G.," the publica«
tion of which was authorized in 1881, was the first journal ever published by a women's
fraternity. Kappa Kappa Gamma, as a national, also maintains a Student’s Aid Fund whose
beneﬁt is not limited to members of K.K.G., but is open to all women students attending
colleges where the fraternity has a chapter.

The local chapter promotes social welfare service by holding a bridge party annually, the
proceeds of which are turned over to the Rose McGill Fund.

To show that the fraternity members are good housekeepers and hard workers, every
girl last year went out and tramped the streets during the cold Christmas season selling
Christmas cards and Colgate’s Soap Flakes. The returns from their labors were used to
improve and redecorate the K.K.G. house. The money remaining after these improvements
went to their National House Endowment Fund.

school recognition and admittance to Pan—hellenic in February of the same year. On June
15, 1924, Sigma Lambda Chi was installed as the national fraternity chapter.

Last January the local chapter gave a card party to earn money for their scholarship
fund. A scholarship will be awarded soon to a junior girl in the University on the basis
of need, personality, and scholarship. This phase of the fraternity’s philanthropic work
has received the approval and cooperation of many prominent women's organizations in
the city.

An Egyptian costume ball is an annual custom of the local chapter. Because their shield
is a sphinx on a pyramid, all the decorations of the dance are carried out in pyramid designs.
At one end of the ballroom stands a pyramid tent with its Sphinx fortune«teller.

PENNSYLVANIA Delta chapter of Pi Beta Phi was organized in 1917 by eleven girls
under the name of the Dianthians. Mrs. H. B. Murphy of Massachussetts with the
help of the Pittsburgh Alumnae Club secured a national charter for them. They were in»
stalled September 19, I919, ﬁfty—two years after Pi Phi was founded.

The education of the poor mountain whites in Gatlingburg, Tennesee, is of great
concern to the local chapter. Each year they swelter over hot stoves making seafoam,
fudge, peanut brittle, and cocoanut balls to sell at a bridge party at the P.A.A. The Pitts’
burgh Alumnae Club call up their friends and a crowd jams the bridge rooms. Last year
$500 was earned and sent to Gatlingburg.

At a Christmas “cookie»shine," given each year by the actives, they all gather around
the party table spread on the ﬂoor. The favor placed at each persorfs place is a cookie
with a burning candle at its center. The girl whose candle burns down ﬁrst is the center
of interest, while the rest munch nutrbread sandwiches, pickles, and cake. The secret of
the interest is that this girl is supposed to be the next one of the group to be married.

Charlotte E. Ray, Education, ‘I9, and one of the charter members of Pennsylvania
Delta is now Dean of Women at Pennsylvania State College. Marie McSwigan, College,

' HEN you see Theta Phi Alphas rushing about the campus selling tickets for a bene»
ﬁt bridge, you know they are raising the money for the Margaret Enright Memorial
Award, a scholarship planned in memory of Margaret Enright, whose sudden death
interrupted her proposed study of medicine. This award is given to the Junior pre~medical
woman student who is most deserving and possessed of the highest scholarship.

Theta Phi Alpha has had a variety of names on the Pitt campus. From the O.K.A. club,
organized in 1920, it changed to Epsilon Pi Epsilon, which in turn became Kappa chapter
of Theta Phi Alpha, a national fraternity for Catholic women. Their charter was granted
in May, 1922, and every year a banquet is held at the Schenley on Founder’s Day, May 4,
to which all alumna, actives and pledges, are invited. Besides this a dance is held every
spring to speed the departing seniors.

Dr. Alice Schmitz, a graduate of the Pitt Medical School, is now practicing in Pittsburgh.
The two Kenny sisters, Marie and Margaret, have recently returned from a sixvmonths
study of music at Fontainebleau, and a tour of Europe. Cecile Schmidt is on the staff of
the Gazette, and Lois Barry is doing advertising work.

IT IS the dream or cherished aim of every fraternity chapter to own a house—-a fraternity
home. On Craig Street, within the campus circle, the house is the center of local chapter
activity; it is an overnight or more permanent “resting place.”

Alpha Burkhart Wettach, now national president, and Helen Donaldson, national
secretary, are alumna of the Pitt chapter. They were, incidentally, among the founders of
the local Chi chapter which was nationally installed in November, 1915. Previous to this,
the Chi chapter group had been known as the I.C.C. club. At the banquet, November 6,
1925, held in celebration of the tenth anniversary of the local chapter, those two national
officers were the guests of honor.

The Junior or Senior most outstanding in scholarship, activities, and service to the
fraternity, is given the Honor Ring of the fraternity to wear. It is set with an onyx engraved
with the seal.

Grace Sefton Myer, concert soprano, has her studio at present in Pittsburgh. She has
been studying at Fontainbleu, France. Her sister, Alice Aleene Sefton, is a physical director
of the University, and Mrs. Lottie O. Lohstoetter, instructor in the department of modern
languages, is an advisor of W.S.G.A., an honorary member of Mortar Board, and a member
of Pi Lambda Theta.

Fraternalism

jfonomry fizz term'tz°e.r

HONORARY fraternities occupy a unique position on any college campus. Unknown
to many and laughed at by those not of their membership, they carry on as a feeble
protest, in a life that is too communal, against cooperation and massvaction. Probably the
ﬁrst honorary fraternity was formed because a few stray poets — or was it bridge build»
ers — wanted a common meeting place for sympathy and understanding of their problems.
They are primarily idealized groups. They always have the gloriﬁed atmosphere of the
higher and better things about them; excellence which is excessively excellent. We expect
an atmosphere concentrated on one thing; we expedt cooperation and congeniality; we
expect a very powerful stimulus for more work.

Honorary fraternities often become a source for pride and a reward for work done.
The pins are worn and the ideals forgotten. They degenerate into a comfortable mediocrity.
It is the practice of many honorary fraternities to recognize excellence rather than to
encourage it. Too much emphasis should not be put on recognition. Standards should be
kept high and higher. Only people who have a genuine love for their work should be
pledged. And in order to keep the morale of the organization, pins and ensignia might be
done away with. If the honorary fraternity doesn't live up to its ideals, the cause lies in
a lack of reason for its existence. Limit the membership to those alone who have ideals
similar to those of the fraternity at heart; do away with as much of the outside regalia as
possible; make it prove itself. Then we will have a living force — be it in poetry or engi«
neering — rather than “just another activity.”

BETA GAMMA SIGMA, national honorary commercial fraternity, was founded
February 23, 1913, by the union of three local groups: Beta Gamma Sigma of the
University of Wisconsin, Delta Kappa Chi of the University of Illinois, and the Economics
Club of the University of California. Only schools which are members of the National
Association of Business Schools are eligible to have chapters of the fraternity.

The University of Pittsburgh chapter, Beta of Pennsylvania, received its charter May 3,
1920. The fraternity is composed of both faculty and undergraduates of the School of
Business Administration. The local chapter aims to promote scholarship among the under-
graduates in the realm of business subjects. It is largely upon the degree of scholastic
attainment in these subjects that elections to the fraternity are made.

THAT the outstanding women students of the University might not be slighted by
the appearance of Omicron Kappa Delta, Alpha Lambda Nu was organized in 1915.
In 1923, it became Mortar Board, national honorary women‘s fraternity.

To stimulate the interest of women students in activities, Mortar Board publishes every
fall a recognition list of Sophomore and Junior women. This list is based entirely on ac»
tivities of the Freshmen and Sophomores. These Women are formally presented to the
active and alumnae members of Mortar Board at a recognition party.

The Greek letters on the Mortar Board of their pin, Pi Sigma Alpha, represent the qual-
ities upon which membership in Mortar Board is based, namely: personality, scholarship,
and activities.

Quax 6/ab

UAX, the honorary group of girls majoring in science, is an organization to keep alive
_ and spread scientiﬁc interest on the campus. It is the outgrowth of a biology seminar
group founded in 1916 by seven charter members: Evangeline Merriman, Mary Aiken,
Mildred Klingman, Artis Jones Rinko, Henrietta Yates Taylor, Edna Hickby, and Amy
Whitmore. The organization expanded, taking in girls from other departments until at
present it includes girls majoring in Chemistry, Physics, Mathematics, Psychology, and
Biology.

Each month the club takes up a different ﬁeld of scientiﬁc study. One of the members
specializing in a center ﬁeld selects a speaker to address the group; Dr. H. D. Curtis of the
Allegheny Observatory and Jay F. W. Pearson, a member of the Kartabo expedition, were
among the outstanding speakers this year. At least once a year the Quax give a luncheon to
all girls majoring in science who have a high standing in their major. The club also sup’
ports the Collembola Club and other scientiﬁc organizations on the campus. Most of the
members of Quax are adtive members in the club specializing in their particular ﬁeld.

RUE, Pi Lambda Theta is the school»ma'rm’s honorary, but don't let this conjure up
any pidture of prim, severe ladies whose chief delight is to send people to the black»
board, or make them stand in a corner, for they have had two University May Queens as
prominent members during the past few years. While they may discuss at their secret
meetings the alternatives of pouring, cramming, or pounding things into their youthful
charges, they go in for quite diiferent activities on the campus. Delta, the local chapter,
was organized in 1914 at the University of Pittsburgh under the name of Kappa Pi; and
three years later became national at a convention held at the University of Missouri.
Dean Will Grant Chambers was the sponsor for the young fraternity, and under his
leadership and with the encouragement of Mrs. Chambers, the ideals for the group were
early Worked out. From the first it was felt that high scholarship and success in the pro’
fession of teaching should be the prime essential for membership.

Trofeyyzbnal graternzfzér

ACK in the fourteenth century, so the history texts tell, skilled workmen organized

guilds to protect their trades and to serve as training classes for their apprentices.
In this way merchants and bankers became members of merchant guilds and the artisans
and laborers were associated with craft guilds. The history texts also record that these
guilds had a decidedly advantageous inﬂuence on medieval life since they would comprise
in membership nearly all the inhabitants of a town.

At modern colleges and universities the students are trained for chosen professions.
They are made to follow out a deﬁnite program so that upon graduation they may become
qualiﬁed as members of various professions. Accordingly, students in a school of Business
Administration or in a Research Bureau for Retail Training prepare for commercial work;
those in a school of the College or of Education specialize in the humanities or in the
sciences; Engineering, Mines, Pharmacy, Medical, Dental, and Law School students train
for the respective professions.

But during the period of supervised study in the colleges or universities, the students
ﬁnd themselves in training classes which apprentice them to instructors for a set period of
time. Such apprenticeship conﬁnes relations between students and instructors to class»
room activities. The organization of groups which limit membership to students of the
individual schools provides a broader and more social interrrelationship.

Professional fraternities, then, for so these groups are called, are the college and univer»
sity guilds. To a certain extent they are exclusive in membership, of course. The student
members are placed under the leadership of recognized professional alumni and advisors.
Scholastic restraint, however, is removed by fraternal intercourse. The apprentices enjoy
a happier period of training, it is safe to assume, than was possible in the Middle Ages.
A pursuit of their work is optional. Labor is not squeezed out of them, nor must they toil
in dungeons or in sweatshops. They do not receive wages.

Because professional fraternities are social training classes for college students, they take
their place by the side of the social fraternities; but beyond stimulating good fellowship,
they deﬁnitely direct and encourage their members to individual goals and, emulating
the history of the guilds, they have a decidedly advantageous inﬂuence upon university
life.

HE local chapter of Alpha Chi Sigma was developed from an old Chemistry club.
The club petitioned the national chemical fraternity and became Omega chapter on
June 12, 1915.

Alpha Chi Sigma was founded at the University of Wisconsin in 1902. Its membership
includes Sophomore, Junior, Senior, and graduate students of chemistry and chemical
engineering who expect to make some phase of chemistry their life work. Professional
chemists and chemical engineers of note are also admitted.

Gilbert Thiessen, 3.5, is now with his father in Sheﬂield, England. Thiessen is working
in the department of fuel technology of the University of Sheffield on a fuel research
problem under a school fellowship. He will be abroad until next spring and then expects
to return to the University in the fall of 1926.

’T‘O FOSTER scientiﬁc research in the ﬁelds of commerce, accounts, and ﬁnance, and to
educate the public to appreciate and demand higher ideals in these ﬁelds, were the
purposes of the founding of Alpha Kappa Psi fraternity. Among the forty~one college
chapters is Delta, installed at the University of Pittsburgh in October, 1912.

In furtherance of their aim, Delta chapter has made two single contributions. It has
established a trust fund to yield perpetually an income of one hundred dollars to be awarded
annually to the Junior or Senior of the School of Business Administration attaining the
highest scholastic average. It has also made a pledge of one thousand and forty dollars to
the Cathedral of Learning Fund as an expression of loyalty to Alma Mater, and a
perpetual reminder to future generations of their active interest in this worthy project.

MICRON chapter of Alpha Omega had its origin in the Odons Club, an organ»

ization formed by students of the school of dentistry of the University of

Pittsburgh in the fall of 1920. The Odons Club was granted a charter by Alpha Omega on
December 3, 1920.

Dr. A. 1. Wise, Prator and Deputy Chancellor of the local chapter, has been engaged
in the practice of dentistry for over twenty years and is considered to be one of the most
successful practitioners in this Vicinity. He was the state delegate to the recent national
dental convention. Dr. Walter Goldsmith, Chancellor of the Alumni Club of Alpha
Omega, has given numerous talks and clinics during the past year on the phases of dentistry.
Another graduate of the local chapter, Dr. H. Meyers, was recently awarded the dental
key of honor, thus, admitting him to the membership of the Omicron Kappa Upsilon. He
is now doing research in the fields of exodontia and radiology. Dr. Joel Sissman, past
chancellor of the Alpha Omega Alumni Association, is also one of the pioneer key men of
the Pitt Dental School. He was graduated with highest honors in his class and continued
his ﬁne work in his practice.

APPA chapter of Alpha Zeta Gamma, national professional dental fraternity for
Jewish men, had its origin in the Pulp Club formed by students of the School of
Dentistry of the University of Pittsburgh in 1922. The following year the club was granted
recognition by the Council of the Supreme Chapter at Chicago. The national Alpha
chapter, organized in 1911, is at the Chicago College of Dental Surgery.

The local chapter taps men from the School of Dentistry annually, choosing them ac/
cording to scholastic standing, character, and personality. The organization, though new
on the campus, has gradually gained prestige until it is one of the leading Jewish Dental
professional fraternities.

Chapters are found in the most prominent schools of the country, namely, Chicago
College of Dental Surgery, University of Illinois, University of California, University
of Maryland, University of Chicago, Northwestern University, University of Pittsburgh,
Tuft Dental College, Harvard Dental School, Western Reserve, and Cleveland. Graduate
chapters are found in Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, Ohio, Illinois, Connecticut, Maryland,
New Jersey, and a number of states throughout the west. New chapters are now being
formed at the University of Pennsylvania and Rochester Dental School.

LEXANDER F. MAKAY was instrumental in founding at the School of Commerce,
Accounts and Finance of New York University the national professional commercial
fraternity, Delta Sigma Pi. Organized in 1907, no other chapters were installed until
1914, at Northwestern University. Following the chartering of Gamma chapter in 1916
at Boston University, the local Delta chapter was installed at the University of Pittsburgh.
National conventions are held annually.
The purpose of the fraternity is threerfold: to foster the study of business in the uni«
versities; to encourage scholarship; and to augment a closer relationship between the student
and the leader of the business world.

PROMOTE the cause of legal learning among law students through court trials
and the reading of local papers, and to develop principles of justice and brotherhood
among its members, a professional legal fraternity known as Delta Theta Phi was organized.
There are ﬁfty»seven chapters which are called senates. In honor of the Late Chief Justice
Gibson, a worthy Pennsylvania jurist, the Pittsburgh chapter is called the Gibson Senate.
President Calvin Coolidge is a member of Delta Theta Phi, and also Chief Justice
Moschzisker of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court. Judge James R. McFarlane of Common
Pleas Court; Richard W. Martin, City Solicitor; John D. Meyer, former assistant district
attorney; Gustav Schramm, instructor in the department of political science; Prof. George
Jarvis, of the law school; and William Eckert, ’24, who held the highest average ever
attained in the Law School, are alumni of the local chapter.

Kappa T51’

BETA KAPPA chapter of the Kappa Psi pharmaceutical fraternity received its charter
on March 26, 1912. This organization was founded on a basis of an older academic
society in which Mr. Harvey Smith held membership. The academic society expanded
greatly, and the entrance of graduates of the academic chapter into colleges of pharmacy
in the fall of 1879 marked the beginning of Greek Letter pharmaceutical societies in the
United States.

In 1884 it was decided to establish chapters in college only, to discontinue the academic
chapters, and to continue as a strictly professional fraternity. Kappa Psi is now strictly
and completely pharmaceutical.

Beta Kappa chapter has a house located at 258 Belleﬁeld Avenue.

T THE beginning of the current year, Mu chapter procured a new house. Although it

is situated a little farther from the School of Pharmacy than the old one, it is in a

better locality, and is a larger and better house. A campaign is now being conducted to

raise money to buy new furnishings. The local chapter was founded in 1906 by Dr. J. H.
Beal, then a professor in the Pittsburgh College of Pharmacy.

Although the active membership of the local chapter has heretofore been small, it is
very probable that this will be increased with the pharmacy course being increased to
three years. This might seem to point to the preference of a larger fraternity chapter and
the disregard of scholarship, friendliness, and brotherhood which are the requirements
for membership in Mu chapter.

N THE twenty~nine years that the Psi Omegas have been on the Pitt campus they

have had ﬁve chapter houses. The first one, on Fifth Avenue, was occupied for sixteen
years. The third house did not spread its protecting roof over them very long; hardly had
they recovered from their last move when a serious ﬁre destroyed this house. Undaunt»
ed, the local chapter repaired to the University Track House. Two years of saving and
they were able to buy their present house on Belleﬁeld Avenue.

Nu chapter of Psi Omega, national professional dental fraternity, was at no time a
local society, but was national from the time of its founding on the Pitt campus. In Iviarch,
1897, the Supreme Council, of which Dean H. E. Friesell was a member, granted a charter
to E. A. Waughaman, Charles E. Peters, Carl S. Horner, C. L. McChesney, W. P. Lytle,
and J. K. Scott.

The Psi Omegas probably have more members of their fraternity on the Dental School
faculty than any other professional group. They boast of ﬁfty~eight faculty members.
Among them are Dean H. E. Friesell, and Dr. J. B. Sutherland, head football coach.

N MAY 2, 1924, twentyrtwo Dents, President P. R. Boyles in chair, got together at

the Fort Pitt Hotel for the installation of Alpha Upsilon chapter of Xi Psi Phi, a
professional Dental fraternity. These Dents had all decided on careers in the practice of
Dentistry and believed that by organization in a strong professional fraternity they would
get a better, more substantial foundation on which to build a successful life. After holding
meetings in State Hall and at the Delta Sigma Delta house, a chapter house was ﬁnally
secured at 4801 Centre Avenue. After staying there one year, the fraternity moved to
235 McKee Place, its present home.

The Xi Psi Phi’s hold a Supreme Chapter meeting each year. Brother P. R. Boyles, to
whom Dental Rays, the new Dental journal, is indebted, was Alpha Upsilon‘s delegate
to the Supreme Chapter meeting held at Dallas, Texas, in 1924; and last year C. E. Hunter
represented the chapter at Louisville, Kentucky.

J. A. Norwicki, past president of the class of ‘27, is now Junior Master of the Trowel
fraternity. Two charter members of the local chapter, Dr. H. W. Bradley and Dr. P. W.
Shragen, are demonstrators in Prosthetic Technicas on the Dental School faculty.

UNDER the leadership of an All»American tackle the 1925 Pitt football team compiled
the best record at the University since the 1916 combination. The team, made up of
seven letter men from the previous year and four from the famous freshman team of the year
before, made Pitt one of the outstanding teams in the East and the champion of the district.

"Horse" Chase was an inspiring leader, distinguishing himself in every game and es
pecially in the Penn game as one of the hardest tackles in the country to stop from breaking
through the line. His ﬁne playing While in Philadelphia marked him as a tackle of All»
American calibre.

Gustafson was the outstanding star on the offense and caused many coaches to try to
build a special defense to stop him. His individual efforts, climaxed by an 85«yard run
after a fumble, defeated West Virginia. “Gusty‘s" three field goals against "Lafayette set
an early season mark for other sharpshooters to try for.

In the later games on the schedule Gibby Welchls ﬁne running, especially his noted
8oryard run from scrimmage against State and his accurate forward passing mark him as a
fine nucleus around which “Jock" Sutherland can build his:‘1o26 offense.

TADIUM YEAR, the realizav

tion of the hopes of the Univer—
sity of Pittsburgh‘s most loyal and
zealous alumni, brought with it not
only the massive, towering concrete
walls on the side of “Pitt Hill,” but
stirred up all the lingering memories
of a decade ago —— memories of that
famous 1916 team — as the glory of Notre Dame, in 1924, dimmed with the age of a
year.The stadium saw Pitt in its most glamorous season in those ten years, roared at its
reestablishment of the supremacy of college football in Pittsburgh, gurgled at “]ock"
Sutherland's redemption of himself, and rejoiced with the apotheosis of a Pitt man as an
All»American, the pioneer as a ﬁrstrtearn selection for several years.

Nine games made up the schedule —- one of the most formidable in the East — and
eight of them ended as Pittsburgh victories; Lafayette, under Herb McCracken, alone
barred the way to a stronger claim on the championship of the country. The schedule
opened with an easy victory over a new rival, Washington and Lee, under Jimmy DeHart,
but jolted roughly in the second game, when Lafayette, in an unexpected sally, gave Pitt
its only defeat of the year. West Virginia followed, but failed to fare better than it had
in its most promising seasons in the past few years. Gettysburg, another newcomer on
the schedule, offered little opposition and Sutherland used his substitutes for the whole
game.The seasonls feature—by virtue of our defeats in the past two seasons—came on
the next Saturday: the annual game with Carnegie Tech. Pitt took back the mythical “city
title" which it had sacri«
ﬁced in each of the pre»
vious two years. Johns’
Hopkins, in its second year
on the schedule and its first
appearance in Pittsburgh,
failed to make much of an
impression, while the next
of the “traditional" games
followed with Wash«]eﬂ:.
Pitt called the most atten/
tion to itself on the next
weekend when it ﬂailed
Penn — heralded as the
ruler of the East, even
after its defeat by Illinois
— at Philadelphia, with

 

 

 

a form that delighted the critics of the
nation. The season closed in the usual
manner: an uneventful, yet colorful Vic»
tory over Penn State, which marked
nothing more than another collapse of
Hugo Bezdek.

And so, at the season's end, there was
little more to do but to consider Pitt as
one of the champions of the country;
Dartmouth held sway in the East and
was generally accepted as the ﬁnest team
of the year; Alabama made itself out»
standing in the South; and Washington
conquered all on the Paciﬁc Coast.

“Horse" Chase, captain, ﬁnished the
season with general recognition by the
football critics as one of the most ﬁnished players produced in the season; he won places on
countless mythical All/American teams, including those selected by “Pop” Warner, “Knute"
Rockne and “Tad" Jones. Chase made his greatest impression when he faced Penn; he
alone supplied a great part of the oifense and defense of the Pitt line, making tackles and
opening holes that cynical eastern writers thought impossible of any player in the country.
And so he was called the best tackle of the year.

At the close of the season, the ballot taken among the 23 lettermen named “Tuffy”
McMillan as the captain for 1926. McMillan played all year at one of the ends, working
opposite “]ohnny" Kifer. From the caliber of his play, he is expected to make a brilliant
attempt to ﬁll the place which Chase’s graduation leaves.

Besides all this, the season saw Jock Sutherlandls “redemption of himself,” as many
like to call it. In his ﬁrst year, Sutherland had only mediocre success: he had to lay the
foundation for his second year‘s team. The record he made in 197.5 will stand as a silent
testimony as to how
solidly he laid that
foundation.

QUARTER OF THE W. E! J. GAME ‘

PITT 28; WASHINGTON AND LEE 0

The opening game of the season—besides marking the opening of the stadium and
its informal dedication # stands as the first glimpse Pittsburgh had of the promise of the
team. Four times Pitt crashed over the Wash~Lee goal, but all that was incidental. Suther»
land used many men: ﬁrst, second, and third squad backﬁelds. Gustafson, Harding, Brown,
and Welch—a Sophomore——opened as the Varsity backﬁeld. Twice touchdowns came
from blocked kicks, yet it wasn’t until the season neared its close before the realization
came that quickness and agility in blocking kicks resulted in many Pitt scores.Pitt resorted
almost entirely, however, to the battering assault that marked its play all season.

PITT 9; LAFAYETTE 20

The national football ﬁrmament ﬁrst quivered on October 3, when Pitt, already ballyhooed
as one of the country's best teams and the one with the secondrbest prospects, lost its only
game. The thing just wasn’t expested, unless the succession of defeats by Lafayette in
the past few years offered a dire prophecy. In the first half, Pitt, although balked on its
line attack, piled up enough points to win the average football game, for Andy Gustafson
kicked three successive ﬁeld goals to put Lafayette at a ninerpoint disadvantage. With
the opening of the second half, however, Gebhardt and Kirkleski, responsible for the
Pitt defeat in 1924, inspired the Lafayette attack, which netted three touchdowns and
two goals. The greatest pain came when the records indicated that it was the worst
football defeat Pitt had had since the Syracuse game in 1919.

PITT 13; WEST VIRGINIA 6

The West Virginia game, threatening several times to be another defeat, was the
turning point of the season. Many claim, from a psychological standpoint, that the Lafay»
ette defeat indirectly resulted in the success of the season as a whole; it no doubt resulted
in the West Virginia viétory. At the end of the ﬁrst half, neither team had scored, in spite
of several opportunities each had. The Mountaineers, at the start of the second half,
mastered the shifty Spears’ formations, bequeathed to them as part of the system Spears
left when he went to Minnesota, and scored on a consistent drive, missing the goal»after»
touchdown. Pitt, faced by another defeat, coolly resorted to the forward pass: result,
touchdown, with Gustafson kicking goal. West Virginia, relying on Farley, tried the same
tactics and took the ball deep into Pitt territory. A score seemed imminent, then Gus’
tafson recovered a fumble and lumbered the length of the ﬁeld for the last score.

PITT 13; GETTYSBURG O

Gettysburg made its debut on the Pitt schedule with a heavy team, but Sutherland
met it with most of his substitutes, changed frequently, while his regulars rested for the
Carnegie Tech game on the following Saturday. At the start, only Gustafson of the
regular eleven appeared and ‘‘Jimmy'' Hagan ran the team, as quarterback, for the ﬁrst
time. For three periods there was no score, but in the fourth — although there was no
worry for Pitt — Roberts and Booth, both from the freshman team of the previous year,
made touchdowns. Gettysburg offered a powerful running attack, but couldn't work
near the goal lines.

HREE games were won, one lost before the stadium was oﬂicially dedicated. But it

was ﬁtting that the most important game on the schedule should be preceded by the
exercises, and the most important game, at least for Pittsburgh and Pittsburgh students,
was with Carnegie Tech on October 24. _

Of course it rained; it always did on the famous Saturdays of the 1925 season. But the
crowd was out in all its red and yellow slickers, in all its blue and purple umbrellas, in its
overshoes and slouch hats. And the crowd was excited; the bowl was almost ﬁlled as
early as two o’clock, with only the drizzle, the cannon by the track recess, and the ﬁlling
stands for entertainment. The newsboys sold out periodically, for papers provided the
only dry seats. Wet, packed together, the crowd waited.

Then through Entrance C, at the end of the stadium opposite the medical school, the
parade entered. The Tech band in its kilties and the Pitt, with its blue and gold shrouded
in yellow oilskins, formed on the ﬁeld and led the procession. The time of the Panther
March set the crowd to clapping; both sides cheered; and as the parade rounded the
oval, all the slickers jumped up and waved their hats. The stadium was a bowl full of

llsoll

    

FIRING THE NATIONAL SALUTE

noise. The armies of Pitt and Tech, the local units of R.O.T.C., followed their brilliant
comrades with rhythmic khaki, and then, in a dwindling trail, thefaculties walked, much
bedraggled in spite of their umbrellas. Still the crowd clapped and yelled, and the procession
moved around to the reviewing stand on the Pitt side. Suddenly, though, everything was
hushed, and the cheerleaders waved frantically for silence. Through the drizzle came
faintly the voice of Chancellor Emeritus McCormick in the invocation. After the prayer
the hats went on again, and Homer D. Williams, chairman of the stadium committee, spoke,
formally presenting the bowl to the University. Chancellor Bowman accepted. Thus
brieﬂy was the dedication accomplished.

But most interesting of all the ceremonies came next, the national salute as the American
ﬂag was pulled to the top of its staff. Twentyrone times, in slow succession, the gun in
the far turn ﬂashed and recoiled, and as the smoke rose each time, the boom would burst
upon the ears of the opposite Pitt rooters with a crash that seemed to make the concrete
tremble; indeed, from the steps facing the gun the echo moaned back, growing into a
weird wail at the end. And when the last shot had shocked the quaking coreds, the bands
began to play once more, first for Carnegie Tech its Alma Mater as the Tartan ﬂag ran
up the pole; then, turning, they played for Pitt, and the blue and gold unfurled at the far
end of the stadium.

The exercises were over, and the parade broke up into groups and ﬁled into the stands,
but the ﬁeld was cleared only that another dedication should be fulﬁlled. And the second
exercises were quite proper, too. Pitt won the Tech game.

PITT 12; CARNEGIE TECH O

Carnegie Tech —— the truest color and the finest ﬂavor of the season — gracefully gave
up its “city title"; it had to. There was scarcely a minute in which Pitt wasn’t the superior
team; not once was any one of Wally Stelfen's quickrpassing and hiddenrball plays sue»
cessfully worked for appreciable gains; in no phase of the game did Carnegie compare
with Pitt, except, of course, in spirit. Spirit and brains won for Carnegie in 1923 and 1924,

PILING UP ON THE GOAL LINE, STATE GAME

but in 1925, brains changed sides and allied with brawn and skill. Pitt, however, was out»
weighed by an average of over three pounds to each man. Mud marred the game and
rain spoiled it for the spectators. Among the players, Brown especially stood out, for his
punting averaged 30 to 45' yards for each kick. Harding, at quarter for nearly the whole
game, selected his plays wisely, particularly using his forward passes— long ones—
at the right times. Two forward passes, to ends, resulted in the touchdowns. Wissinger
and Chase formed the strongest unit of the defense in the line. The formal dedication of
the bowl marked the game, too, as above the ordinary afternoon of football.

PITT 14; PENN O

The Penn game is a chapter in football history. Red Grange, with Illinois, had smeared
Penn when Penn was considered the greatest club in the East. Penn then gave vent to its
grief by whipping Haverford, 660, with the serious intention of airing the rest of it on
Pitt. Penn doesn’t like Pitt, because they’ve won only once in all the games they’ve played.
But the East was shocked. Pitt opened debonairely with football as it can be played on any
sandlot — rushes, endrruns, off—tackle jabs. All were effective; Penn couldn't stop any.
Then the East, represented by the best sporting writers and the closest followers of foot»
ball, was amazed. Harding ran and dashed as he never did before; Welch, rising as an
unknown, equalled him; and Gustafson crashed through the Penn line time and time
again. And in the meantime, whenever Penn tried to advance, Chase was always in the
way. The fans couldn’t understand it. Before they could reconcile themselves to seeing
this marvelous Penn team outdone for the second time —— and on straight football, too —
Harding changed his tactics and opened up the most sparkling forward passing attack,
all mixed up with the old plays, that the season had produced on famous Franklin Field.
Well, the first team backﬁeld tallied two touchdowns; the second team carried the ball
to the ﬁveryard line; the third team took up the ﬁght and Penn kept backing towards its
goal, but the end of the game prevented another score.

PITT 23; PENN STATE 7

In past years, Penn State couldn"t V P g
beat Pitt—no matter how success
ful the one and unsuccessful the
other 4- because it was overrconﬁr
dent, or so the alumni and students
said. Last year, it wasn’t overrconﬁr
dent, but it lost anyhow, probably
because a Penn State defeat is the
proper way of closing a Pitt season. , ‘
State played its best game of the AT THE PENN GAME
season and actually outgained Pitt,
but the Panther won because it was still alert, and coached to take advantage of its op~
ponents’ misplays. State was always dangerous and time and again started drives—
sometimes with brilliant forward passing waves that Pitt couldn"t stop—that threatened
scores. On the other hand, Pitt was even more brilliant: Welch made an 8r»yard dash
for touchdown; Salata recovered a fumble and scored on a zsvyard run; Gustafson kicked
a nearrperfect ﬁeldrgoal; Harding handled the team faultlesslyg Brown punted at his best;
the line held State for downs on the foot~line, when Linn, for Steele, went in near the
end of the third quarter as the first substitution; and there was plenty of mud. Eleven
players finished their careers for Pitt.

PITT 31; ]OHNS«HOPKINS O

]ohns«Hopkins made its first appearance in Pittsburgh, but left little impression, even
on Sutherland's second and third squad players. Chase was the only regular to start and
he only played long enough to shake hands with the opposing captain and select the goal.
Long runs by Hoban and Grindle resulted in two of the touchdowns, but most of them, on
the usual muddy ﬁeld, came on conservative football. Booth, Schmitt, McCutcheon, and
DeMoise were the other prominent substitutes.

BOOTH CRASHES THE JOHNS’HOPKINS LINE IN THE SECOND QUARTER

PITT 6; W.E«»°J. 0

The annual classic with Wash«Jeﬂ" proved only another step in the succession of VlC’
tories and another frolic in the mud. Sutherland inaugurated to an even more noticeable
extent his policy of playing a “waiting" game. Thirty thousand people, grumbling on
the cold stone in a steady rain, sat perplexed at the “foolhardiness" of the Pitt quarter»
back. Seldom did Pitt try to run the ball; it was content merely to receive it, anywhere
on the ﬁeld, and punt it right back. Wash~Jeff used just an opposite style, accepted each
time, and sent its backs, ineffective in the mud, pounding uselessly at the Pitt line. Neither
team gained anything through the ﬁrst three periods and it looked as though the game
would end in a scoreless tie. The alarm grew, for in all history, stretching over 26 games,
Pitt and W. 59’ J. had never tied. Minutes passed; the battle without results continued in
its slow, monotonous way. Pitt punted; Wash»Jeff received. Then Wash»JeE, tiring and
getting careless after all its useless efforts, swung machinerlike back into its plunging.
Someone——one of those slimy gray forms——fumbled and “Zack" Wissinger rose out
of the mess, proving sound Sutherland’s theory, pawed up the oozy ball, and started his
perilous run for victory, which ended with a headlong lurch over the goal»line. The game
died almost immediately, just as lifeless and ﬂreless as it had started. Wash»Jeﬂ' gained
more ground than Pitt—an advantage sometimes considered the criterion of the better
team—but it gained none of its ground in Pitt territory, for Pitt always, through Jess
Brown, kicked the ball back into W. E9’ J. territory. It was a game where individuals
were only forms, parts of dull, mud—plastered machines.

SEVEN is usually considered a lucky number. Pitt Freshman elevens, however, seem to

take exception. For each of the past two years, the plebes have pulled through six
games with a clean slate, only to lose their ﬁnal contest of the season. In 1924 Kiski won,
17 to 0, at Greensburg; in 1925 Bellefonte Academy applied the salt, winning, 19 to 0,
at Altoona.

The team scored a decisive triumph in its ﬁrst start, subduing Westinghouse Tech,
2,3 to o. The West Virginia yearlings received similar treatment a week later. Kiski offered
the ﬁrst serious opposition, but ﬁnally lost. A ﬁeld goal by Rooney was Pitt's only score,
but it won. Carnegie Tech Frosh managed to annex a 66 deadlock with the aid of a sloppy
ﬁeld, but the ensuing Saturday found the rangy Penn State plebes far inferior to the Cubs.
The score was 20 to 0, the worst trimming inﬂidted upon a State Freshman team in years.
A week later, Washrjeif Freshmen held the Carlsonites to a scoreless tie, aided materially
by the slippery underfooting and the listless playing of the Cubs. Followed then the Altoona
trip and the subsequent defeat by Bellefonte.

HE 1925 crossrcountry season,while not as successful as that of 1924, is one for Pitt

to be proud of. The varsity won four of its six dual meets and placed second in the
I.C.A.A.A.A. Championship race, held annually at New York City. Pitt won this event
the previous year, but with only two of ﬁve veteran runners back in school, was unable
to repeat.

The seasonls ﬁrst meet was held at Syracuse University, October 10, Pitt losing after
a hard race through a blinding snow storm, 20 to 37. Loucks, Syracuse, won. Ted Corbett,
captain, was the first Pitt runner to ﬁnish, taking third place. His teammates placed as
follows: Kerr, ﬁfth; Howell, seventh; Roy, ninth; Robison, tenth; Adams, eleventh;
and Marquis, twelfth.

The following week, Pitt defeated Allegheny College over the Schenley Park course
by a nearly perfect score, 16r43.Corbett led the way in 28 minutes, 18 seconds, setting a new
course record. Kerr, Marquis, and Roy, all of Pitt, followed in order. Jones, Allegheny,
was ﬁfth. Howell completed Pitt’s scoring, sixth.

Carnegie Tech was met October 24 over the Schenley Course and defeated by a perfect
score. The ﬁrst six men, all of Pitt, crossed the line in the following order: Corbett, Kerr,
Marquis, Howell, Roy and Adams. Corbett’s time, through rain and mud, was only
ﬁve seconds from the course record.

In one of the best races of the season, the harriers ran to a great win over Alfred College,

i308}-

  Competition

one of the best teams in the east, by the score of 21 to 34. Alfred won the Middle Atlantic
title two weeks later at Philadelphia. Individual honors again went to Corbett after a
race to the ﬁnish with Herrick, Alfred captain, and Middle Atlantic individual winner.
Corbett won in the last 2oo yards. Pitt men who counted in the team score were Kerr,
third; Howell, fourth; Marquis, sixth; and Adams, seventh. Roy was eighth and Powell
eleventh.

The week following, on November 7, the varsity traveled to Penn State for the last meet
of the year. State won, 23, to 32. Pitt was not completely outdone, for Corbett, for his
fourth straight victory, ran to an impressive win over Fouracre and Captain Barclay,
and broke the State course record by registering a mark of 25' minutes, 23, seconds, in place
of 25 minutes, 30 seconds. The Pitt men scored in the following positions: Corbett, first;
Kerr, ﬁfth; Howell, seventh; Roy, ninth; and Powell, tenth. Adams and Marquis were
out because of illness.

The big test of the year, and the one in which the Panther team again made a great
bid for fame, was the I.C.A.A.A.A. Championship race at Van Courtlandt Park, Novem»
ber 23. Pitt failed to retain its title, not being able to match with Syracuse, but with almost
as complete a surprise to the Eastern teams landed second place. With two of last year’s
team and three new men, Pitt took second in a ﬁeld of nineteen teams. The team scores:
Syracuse, 47; Pitt, 84; Harvard, 122; Maine, 144; Penn State, 146; Bates, I59; M.I.T.,
186; Yale, 188; Princeton, 215; Cornell, 268; Pennsylvania, 295; Rutgers, 303; Columbia,
321; Dartmouth, 325; N.Y.U., 357; C.C.N.Y., 488.

The individual Pitt runners placed as follows: Kerr, fourth; Corbett, sixth; Howell,
ﬁfteenth; Marquis, twentyrﬁrst; and Powell, thirty~eighth. The Pitt alternates, Adams
and Roy, placed forty—fourth and ﬁfty—ninth.

The varsity for all the meets was W. T. Corbett, captain for the second season, George
Kerr, captainrelect for 1926, Robert Marquis, William Howell, Edward Powell, Woodward
Adams and Robert Roy. These men were awarded minor letters at the close of the season.
Aubrey Wolford managed the team and George Stille acted as assistant.

The Freshman team had two meets, winning from Carnegie Tech in a close meet,
26—29, and losing to the Penn State Frosh by the one»sided score of 15/40. Hoffman, Pitt,
won the Carnegie race, and Cox, State, won the other, with Edwards, the ﬁrst Pitt man
to ﬁnish, in sixth place. Members of the Frosh team were Hoffman, Edwards, Mench,

Cobun, Campbell, and Kaufman.

OLF at Pitt, although it ﬂourished in 1924, almost died out as a varsity sport in 1925.

Other schools in the district just quit supporting teams, with the result that the
Graduate Manager found it almost impossible to book matches. The varsity played only
three times, under Coach Lambert Flynn, professional at Stanton Heights Country Club.
In home and home matches with Penn State, Pitt lost twice, 4/2 and 5»o, while it lost
again to the Latrobe Country Club team, 64, at Latrobe. Only two men, Tom Canon,
captain and manager, and William Wade King, received letters.

The 1925 Track (Semon

HE 1925 track season was highly successful as is readily seen from the records. The

runners, again coached by Frank Shea, 1920 Olympic runner, took part in six meets.
Of this number, they won the Pitt Inter»Collegiates, the Washingtonjeiferson Interr
collegiates, and the Carnegie Tech dual meet, were second to the Naval Academy in the
Navy»Pitt»West Virginia triangle meet at Annapolis, and lost to West Virginia and
State in dual meets. Individual athletes showed well in the Penn Relays at Philadelphia
and the National Intercollegiates at Chicago.

The season opened the last week in April when the fourrmile relay team ran in the
Penn Relays. Fourteen teams competed in the event, which was won by Boston College
after a close race with State. Pitt followed Harvard in sixth place, just nosing out Cornell
and Columbia. The Pitt runners on the team were Schroedel, Lies, Wadkins and Captain
Corbett. Howell, a regular member of the team, was taken sick during the trip and Lies,
an alternate, ran in his place.

The first meet of the year was held May 2 at Annapolis, with the Naval Academy and
West Virginia. The ﬁnal score was Navy 87, Pitt 25 and West Virginia 24. Pittls first

places came in two running events and two ﬁeld events. Captain Corbett won the twormile
in 9:50 2»; and set a new Pitt record. Wadkins won the half/mile in a beautiful race. Linn
broke the Pitt shotrput record with a heave of 40 feet, 10% inches, and Dave Archibald
won the discus throw.

West Virginia came back the next week in a dual meet at Pittsburgh and won, 76% to
561/2. Pitt took ﬁrsts in the high hurdles, halfrmile, twormile, discus throw, and shot
put, and managed to keep the score close until the last two events with an overwhelming
number of second and third places.

Following the Mountaineer meet, Pitt moved over to Carnegie Tech for the annual
dual attraction and once more emerged Viétorious, 75 to 60. Carnegie had the edge in the

Pitt won its own Intercollegiate meet, May 24, by a one~point margin, from West
Virginia. The ﬁnal score was Pitt 88, West Virginia 87, Carnegie Tech 44, and Washington

ITT started its basketball season poorly, dropping its first two games to Michigan and

Goodyear Tires, then, after the Christmas holidays, began to play sterling basketball
and surprised everybody by keeping it up to the end of the season. As a result, the non»
conference trirstate championship came to Pitt for the second time in four years.

A momentary lapse against Geneva, late in February, shoved Pitt to second place in
the race, so to win the title it was necessary to invade Grove City and take over Bob
Thornls proteges, an attempt at which was a previous failure.

The clean sweep of the threergame series with Carnegie Tech was an outstanding
feature of the season.

Captain Parsons, Wrobleski, Kowallis, Reed, Chase, Lissfelt, Rihenak, McMahon,

TEAM is usually said to have experienced a “checkered season" if its win column
shows only a slight edge at the end of the year. Accordingly, the 1926 Pitt Freshman
basketball team enjoyed only mediocre success. Whenever a Pitt team takes a series from
Carnegie Tech, however, the season is declared a “howling success." Hence the Cubs
didn’t have such a poor season after all.
Uniontown High School, 1925 Pennsylvania state champion, was also whipped.
Captain Whitey McCandless, of Beaver Falls; Ted Meier, of Erie East; Bill Parry and

ITT turned out the strongest varsity tennis team in its history in 1925. From the opening
match until the closing one, the team never knew defeat and only three times found
itself close to it. Rain prevented two of 15 scheduled matches, but the team won every
one of the others but three, all of which resulted in ties. The tennis rivalry between Pitt
and W. E9’ J. reached its height in the spring and to complicate the situation even more,
the two squads, at their strongest, played to two ties in disputing the championship of
the district.

HE Freshman tennis team ﬁnished its season as the greatest ever produced at the

University. Besides that, it was undoubtedly the strongest Freshman tennis team
in the country and fully capable of defeating its own varsity. Doctor Tom Stephens
coached it along with his duties as varsity coach. He had plenty of material: Johnny
and Davey O’Loughlin and Byron Baur alternating as first, second and third men in the
singles, with Lawler usually fourth. The doubles were always played by other men
selected from the squad. The team went through its whole season without defeat and

THE Panther varsity riﬂers, starting out their season minus the services of four regulars
who had graduated, and Bob MacFarlane, who was injured in an automobile accident,
did particularly well in face of the severe opposition they encountered when they attempted
to carry out their schedule. They ﬁnishing the season with a total of twenty matches
ﬁred, won fourteen and dropped six, two to Penn State, and ended up with a total average
of 700.

When the riﬂers started their season several followers pointed out that Pitt would not
be able to stand the gaff, stating that the team was made up largely of new men and only
two regu1ars—Hoehle and Jordan. Pitt developed more than a punch in the weeks that
followed. The coach, Paul Harter, had the varsity go through a ﬁxed training schedule,
the first ever attempted by a riﬂe team.

Pitt won from the University of New York, Carnegie Tech, Michigan, Maine, Western
Maryland, West Virginia, Ohio State, Wisconsin, Delaware, Gettysburg, and Johns
Hopkins and lost to Penn State, Connecticut, Virginia Poly Tech, Cincinnati and City
College of New York.

After the season came to a close the riﬂers traveled to New York to compete in the
championship tourney meet of the United States Intercollegiate League, of which Pitt
is a member. Harter started four newcomers and one veteran. Midrway in the tourney
the newcomers became rather stage frightened and did miserably. Consequently the team
ended in eighth place, out of twelve schools entered.

girls’ Sport;

NTHOUGH there are an endless number of sports to which the Physical Education
Department would like to devote its time, in this practical world of ours it is almost
impossible to realize this aim. And so they merely set up at standard of achievement for
the future in proportion to the measure the sports have progressed in the past, and con»
centrate their efforts on major sports.

Basketball claims first place, as yet, in the girls” program of major sports. There is an
extensive varsity program, together with a growing number of class games. Pitt girls
have shown the “ﬁght" and ability in basketball to go through an entire season without
a single defeat as in ‘24725; to list victories against New York University, Pennsylvania,
Temple, Swarthmore, Bryn Mawr, and Cincinnati, not to mention the rival schools of
Pitt’s environs.

With the rapidly growing desire for intrarmural programs in all leading colleges, Pitt
is looking forward to the coming of this different type of program (and it is bound to
come, for it is wholly desirable). It will increase the spirit of competition in the school
and afford so many more students the privilege of participation and the beneﬁts of thorough
coaching.

But basketball has to make a courtesy to its younger sister’sport——hockey. Field Hockey
made its debut three years ago at Pitt and has grown with unprecedented speed.

Besides student spirit, there must be something to a game that will bring a hundred
students out to spend their leisure time before the sun rises on Schenley Oval and until
the moon rises at night. The past season there were twelve exciting interrclass matches.

Within the department there is an attempt to organize “speed groups.” The latest
releases of Physical Achievement Tests, results of which are to be worked out from all
colleges, by the Russell Sage Foundation, were given to every girl in the department.
Seventy~ﬁve points constituted a perfect score. Pitt scores showed a great variety in
individuals ranging up to sixtyrtwo points. The students know the requirements of the
tests and they know also that individual effort is the only possible way to improve their
score. That is an incentive and also a chance for the “individual” to assert herself without
being lost in the all too large classes in which she works.

Every season brings its favorite sport. In the spring, for the past four years, there has
been the annual swimming meet. Furthermore every girl is afforded an opportunity to
learn lifersaving and pass her Red—Cross Life»Saving Test. In the gymnasium spring pro»
grams have differed in the past years. For two years the department ran a group track
meet. Other years dancing took first place, bringing in different types, such as English
Country and folk dancing, character, and natural, leading up to pageantry.

The Physical Education Department has been the “meltingrpot” for all these sports, but
the Women’s Athletic Association as a student organization has worked in conjunction with
the department and has been a help in shaping the mental, moral, and physical life of
the institution. It has been an instrument in carrying out programs, and in baseball took
complete charge in its infant year of intrarmural competition.

HE 1925'»1926 season of the girls‘ varsity basketball team included a schedule of only
seven games, but all of these were real tussles. The development of intramural
competition has cut down the number of available teams and reduced the cored schedule
to a minimum. Games with Temple and New York Universities on the home ﬂoor, and
trips to Washington D.C., and Fredericksburg, Virginia, were features on the Cored card.

EST year when the Cored Physical Education Department sent out a call for volunteers

to enter a baseball tournament between the classes, many sprightly and enthusiastic
coreds entered into the new annual sport with all the force and vigor that is characteristic
in basketball, hockey, tennis, and the other interrclass events.

After one round of the tournament the Freshman, Sophomore, and Junior teams were
in a threercornered tie with each class vowing it would win in the ﬁnal round, but the
Sophs proved superior and were victors over both the Juniors and the Frosh.

This was the first season of baseball; and the splendid spirit that prevailed and the
enthusiastic cooperation among the coreds have guaranteed its place in girls’ athletics.

THE fourth annual hockey season was one of the best seasons ever experienced by
Pitt women. The competition between the classes in the inter/class tournament was
very keen, and resulted in a three»cornered tie between the Freshmen, Sophomore, and
Senior teams. When the tie was played off the Sophomores were on top as the champions,
with the Seniors in second place and Freshmen in third. An unusual spirit and
enthusiasm was prevalent, for several of the games were played at six—thirty in the morning.
Unfavorable weather conditions did not decrease the interest in the tournament, while
rainy weather with a muddy ﬁeld only added to the excitement. A Hockey Breakfast in
the Heinz House on December eighth ended Pitt’s finest hockey season.

N excellent system requires an excellent personnel; the University of
A Pittsburgh has both. As for its system, that has been perfected as the
school has grown. Through all the advance from backwood’s academy to
modern urban university, the executive system has been evolved to meet
greater and greater problems, until today it knits the University, from
Chancellor to student, into a smoothly operating unity. But systems are dull
to speak about, unappealing. Individuals, administrative heads give them
life, color. These men and women who carry forward the University and
mold its future have in themselves an attraction even greater than the interest
their offices give them. To them, on this account, we editors have gone.
“Your personal views," we asked them, “of your duties, your problems";
and they have replied in the short sketches which follow.

“YOU ask what happens at my oﬂice in the University. In answer,

many disagreeable jobs collect there, and some pleasant ones. It is
the center of effort to provide the means and opportunity for the real
work of the University, that is, the contact in the right kind of environ»
ment between the right kind of teachers and the right kind of students.
My oﬂice, further, is the place where any man or woman of the Univer»
sity, student or teacher, who has a constructive idea, is always welcome;
and if any of these folk believe that they have a grievance, they are also
welcome; in fact, the door is not shut except to people who whine. I
have never been good at listening to whining.

“The most important thing which I try to do is to expect that each
member of the faculty and each student live at the top level to which
he or she has capacity to go.We need, all of us, to expect just this kind
of living from one another.”

Executive Secretary

7] ‘HE By—Laws of the Board of Trustees say the duty of the

Executive Secretary of the University is to assist the
Chancellor in the educational administration of the University.
The purpose of educational administration is, in my mind, to
create conditions which are conducive to good teaching for the
sake of good learning. From time to time and from place to
place the deﬁnition of good learning and good teaching will
vary greatly. But since it is true that a very high percentage of
University of Pittsburgh graduates continue to live in and work
in Pittsburgh, good learning and good teaching for us must be
closely related to the industrial and civic life of this community.
To try to learn what Pittsburgh needs and then so to shape our
educational policy that we produce students who can meet
these needs and be happy at it is a large part of the job of all

of us, whatever our titles.

 

SAMUEL BLACK MCCORMICK, D.D.
Chancellor Emevitus

HE Chancellor Emeritus holds, perhaps, the most enviable

position in the University. His chief occupation is to
watch the wheels go round —— usually from Florida in the
winter time but the rest of the year from his oﬂice in State Hall
where he feels that he is again a part of the living, throbbing,
evenexpanding University and that it is his very own.

The other chief duty of the Chancellor Emeritus is to stand
behind the Chancellor and cheer him on. Better than all others,
he knows the incessant toil, the anxious thought, and the
watchful solicitude involved in the very oﬂice of Chancellor
and it is his particular privilege to afford all the encouragement
and inspiration he can. For, after all, only as Chancellor Bow-
man brings his noble plans into realization, does the work of his
predecessors have any permanent value. In lending a hand,
therefore, and in seeing the University move forward, the
Chancellor Emeritus ﬁlls a satisfying and useful oﬁce.

 

SAMUEL BLACK LINHART, A.M., D.D.
Secretary of the University

HE Secretary is an executive officer of the University.
His duties are related to every department of the Uni»

As Secretary of the Board of Trustees and its Committees,
Dr. Linhart is responsible for seeing that the adtions of the
Board and its Committees are carried out and must keep a
record of all of these adtions.

He is required to see that legal questions connected with
the property of the University and the conduct of its business
are properly handled, and, as Assistant Treasurer, he is charged
with the collection of the revenues of the University, and the
payment of its obligations. He is, in addition, Treasurer of a

HE Department of the Dean of Women is maintained by

the University for the purpose of unifying the extra»

speciﬁcally with housing, employment, student loans, vocational
guidance, counselling of student activities, assemblies, con»
ferences, and social adjustments. In all of its work the Depart»
ment seeks to foster student leadership, to provide stimulating
contacts with women of acknowledged leadership, to emphasize
the responsibility and place of women in the world‘s work,
and to keep constantly before university students ideals of
ﬁne womanhood.

 

WILLIAM MORRELL, A.B.
Director of Public Information

IN a highly organized institution such as a University ——
and especially in a University which is so deﬁnitely a part
of the community it serves as is the University of Pittsburgh ——
there must be a recognized source of public information. Hence
the Department of Publications. The director of this depart~
ment, through official catalogues and bulletins of the school,
through the newspapers and magazines, and indirectly through
student publications, endeavors to interpret the University,
its activities and purposes, to the community. “It’s our Uni»
versity"— that is the realization he would bring to the people
of this great industrial region.

W. DON HARRISON, M.A.
Dean of Men

ASHORT time ago a young man came into Mr. Harrison's
office. His coming was the keeping of a promise.

“When I was a Freshman," he said, “Mr. Ashe sent for
me. Without waste of words, he told me that I was not doing
my work as well as I should. He was right. I promised him I
would do my best, that he would never have to send for me
again, and that when I was ready to leave I would bring him a
scholastic report of which I could say, ‘Here is the proof of
my greatest effort.‘ Mr. Ashe has gone, but I have come to
keep my promise.“

Then he handed Mr. Harrison a record which showed the
leadership of his class. Incidentally this man had paid his own
way through the University: he had spent eight hours each
day driving a truck.

As Mr. Harrison sees it, such is the job of the Student
Counselor and Dean of Men: to help students drive ahead at
their greatest capacity and on the highest possible level.

Graduate Manager of Student Activities

THE Graduate Manager of Student Activities is held rev
sponsible by the faculty for the unsatisfactory work of
participants in student activities and by the students for the
inadequate supply of tenth row First Floor seats for the Cap
and Gown Club play. To students of the School of Dentistry,
he is a true friend to all undergraduates, and to the latter, he
is or should be an honorary member of all Dental fraternities.

Thus he serves a useful purpose in that he provides the
incentive for an expression of student opinion and is one of the
reasons for that interrdepartmental rivalry without which
student life wouldgbe spiritless. -

The College

 

DEAN LEE P. SIEG

T/ze Gbllege

HAVING been organized one hundred years before any of the others, the College is
the oldest and largest of the eight schools in the University. It was founded in 1787
as the Pittsburgh Academy with a mere handful of students and a faculty of ﬁve. Since
then the enrollment has increased to over two thousand students and two hundred and
ﬁfty instrustors.

At ﬁrst, the main elements of the curriculum were languages, pure mathematics, bellesr
lettres, and philosophy, with very little attention being given to professional studies and
the sciences.

Its central position has been the nucleus to which the other schools and departments
have been added. Their dependence on the College is shown in the fact that all require
their entrants to have taken preliminary work in the school.

The main departments of the College are those of Astronomy, Botany, Economics,
Ethics, History, Mathematics, Philosophy, Political Science, Zoology, Chemistry, English,
Greek, Latin, Modern Languages, Physics, and Psychology. Two of these departments,
Psychology and Zoology, have greater enrollments than similar departments in any other
American college.

Lee Paul Sieg, Ph.D., has been Dean of the College since March 1, 1925. He succeeded
Dr. George H. Reavis, who was forced to withdraw because of ill health. Dr. Sieg has
created for himself a national reputation as a physicist with his notable work in the ﬁelds
of crystal structure and optical properties of crystals. As a graduate of the State University
of Iowa, he came to the University of Pittsburgh in September, 1924, as head of the
Physics Department.

Business Administration

 

DEAN LOUIS K. MANLEY

(School 0 f $u.rz'/zen 2/fdmzhzktratzbn

THE University of Pittsburgh organized departments and courses in economic ﬁelds

in 1908 with the creation of the Evening School of Economics, Accounts, and Finance.
In 1910, the School of Economics was founded. In the summer of 1923, these two depart»
ments consolidated as the School of Business Administration.

The original schools were called into existence by the demands of business men for
college trained executives. It was realized that the college graduate entering business.
without some special preparation suffers a severe handicap, and that specialization upon
the fundamentals of business can be of great value. With courses designed to this end,
they were given full cooperation by the business men of the district, and the two schools
soon developed into important training centers for men and women who were going to
enter the business world.

The evening division of the school is doing a unique and valuable service to the com»
munity. Students who are unable to attend the day courses are enrolled in this division.
The instruction is given in the Chamber of Commerce Building and is of the same content
and scope as that of the day division.

Dean Louis K. Manley, formerly head of the Political Science Department in the Col-
lege, has a national reputation as a leader in the ﬁeld of business education and political
science.

WITH a student body of over one thousand students and a faculty of one hundred
instrudtors, the School of Dentistry is the largest dental school in the country. Less
than one per cent of its graduates have failed to pass the state board examinations and it
has always been listed in class “A" by the Dental Educational Council of America.

On April 20, 1896, the school was granted its ﬁrst charter as a result of the interest
shown by local dentists and citizens. During the first year, there were one hundred and
eighteen matriculants on the enrollment. It did not come under complete control of the
University until 1905 despite the fact that it was so associated from the beginning.

The free dental clinic, first opened in 1897, treats more than seventy thousand patients
yearly. This work is of inestimable value to both the students and the community. To
make its work more extensive, thirtyrthree extramural clinics are now being operated at
various hospitals and institutions throughout Western Pennsylvania.

Dr. H. Edmund Friesell has been Dean of the Dental School since 1904. He is a graduate
of the Pennsylvania College of Dental Surgery and a Fellow of the American College of
Dentists.

OURSES in education were first oﬁered in the University of Pittsburgh in the year

190405 in a newly established department of psychology and education. The growth
of the enrollment in these courses indicated a real and increasing demand for systematic
training for teaching. On February 3, 1910, the School of Education was established
to serve as a professional school of collegiate rank for the training of men and women who
expect to enter the profession of teaching. .

In addition to the regular educational courses, the School maintains several special
departments.The Americanization Department aims to meet in some measure the present
demand for trained teachers and workers in the ﬁeld of immigration. This work is aided
by the Frick Educational Commission which awards free scholarships to a number of
students from the Pittsburgh district. In the Department of Vocational Education, teachers
are trained for trade, vocational, and vocational home economics classes. It is largely
supported by Federal and state funds.

Upon the resignation of Dean Reavis because of ill health, Grover Henry Alderman,
Professor of Education and head of the Department of School Supervision at Indiana
State University, was appointed to the position of Dean.

DEAN FREDERIC L. BISHOP

656/200]! 0 f gngzheerzhg and Q73/Qhey

SENDING men into every ﬁeld of endeavor in the engineering and mining professions,
the School of Engineering and the School of Mines have gained a wide reputation.
The School of Engineering is one of the oldest of its kind, and its system of requiring
students to put their theories to practice in industrial plants while they are still in school,
has been adopted by many other schools. The courses in Oil and Gas Production in the
School of Mines are unequaled.

Despite the granting of two Engineering degrees to the University in 1842, a depart»
ment of Engineering was not created until the early 6o‘s.

The School of Mines was founded in 1895 through an act of the State Legislature.
A sum of money was appropriated to the trustees for the purpose of establishing a depart«
ment of the Engineering School to be known as the Western Pennsylvania School of
Mines and Mining Engineering. The object of its creation was to thoroughly educate
capable men in the principles and art of mining and mining engineering.

Dean Frederic Lendall Bishop, Ph.D., head of both schools, took up the work of the
Engineering School in 1909, and in 1923, took over the School of Mines. He is a Fellow in
the American Association for the Advancement of Science and a member of the Highway
Education Board. In 1925, he :was appointed by President Coolidge to a delegation of
seven men to represent the United States at the Pan»American Highways Conference in
Buenos Aires.

JUST JOHN HENRY

A quiet scene in the Tappa Haifa Kegga fraternity house. Brothers playing bridge with
silent viciousness. Other brothers tossing magazines about in a jovial manner. The telephone
bell rings. Grand avalanche of Freshmen toward the phone booth.

Sweet Voice: Hello, are you there?

Freshman: Yes, I’m here.

S.V: Is this the Tappa Haifa Kegga house?

Frosh: Yes, whom do you wish to speak to?

S.V: I want to speak to John Henry.

Frosh: Yes, yes, John Henry what?

S.V: Just John Henry.

Frosh (with dawning gleam of intelligence in eyes): Oh, just a moment please. (Closes
door in phone booth softly. In deep Voice): Hello, this is John Henry speaking.

S.V: Oh, hello. Don’t you recognize my voice?

Frosh (cautiously): Well, I wouldn't go so far as to say I could place my ﬁnger right
on it, but it does sound somewhat familiar. Is it Kitty?

S.V. (indignantly): No!

Frosh: I must have been mistaken. Where did I meet you?

S.V: Can't you remember?

Frosh: No. And besides it takes too much time.

S.V: Well, then, it’s Gloria. And I met you on the corner of Craig and Center, Saturday
night.

Frosh (hastily): Why, of course, little Gloria. And we had such a good time dancing
that night, didn’t we?

S.V. (puzzled): No, we didn’t. You said your foot was sore and you'd rather take a
ride. Don’t you remember?

Frosh (now entirely at ease): So we did; so we did. And how about a ride tonight?
The moon is shining and what not.

S.V: Well, I sort of thought I would study.

Frosh: Oh, no. A little relaxation is what you need tonight. Suppose I call for you at
the same place in about twenty minutes?

S.V: All right . . dear.

Frosh (to Freshman Boss, a little later): George, I have to go down to the library for
some outside material. Must get the hop on the Principles of Osculation.

Freshman Boss (buried in book): All right, go ahead. Be in by tenrthirty.

Frosh departs in haste.

INSTALLMENT 999 ~ “GOOD GOSH GWENDOLYN"

He dashed out of the house into the howling wind. A scarlet gash was on his cheek —
his mussed hair and torn collar bespoke of a nasty battle. On he ran. Would he ever make
it? He gasped and panted as he heard it drawing closer to him. Another spurt — and he
felt that he would drop — he heard it hiss behind him; God, was this the last? He knew
it was — and his thoughts ﬂashed back to that dark house. Why, oh why had he? Another
spurt, a hop — he had won. Gosh, he said, as he wiped the rouge from his cheek, a minute
more necking, and I would have missed the 2:00 street car.

(REPRINTED FROM THE Howl)

No review of this year's smut can possibly be successful without throwing a hunka mud
or two at Mike Arlen. So, hatchet in hand, we stealthily approached The Green Hat. We
soon discarded the hatchet for a gas~mask. It seems that Iris March (of the mad Marches,
yer know) on her wedding night ﬁnds her Hubby has halitosis or something. As a result, he
grabs his pajamas and leaps from the window. Why he kills himself is a mystery to the
characters in the book; also, a mystery to the reader; as for the author, we have our sus~
picions. Anyhow — Boy Fenwick kills himself, Gerald March (of the mad Marches, yer
know) kills himself, and Iris kills herself ; the Author, however, is still writing books.

But how about ‘The Portrait of a Man with Red Hair cries our HowL enthusiast. Well —
all right. But half of the Pitt students and three/fourths of the Juniors will say they
know Hugh Walpole was an artist. Well, maybe he was, for all I know. As to the book
itself, I would advise only those who haven't read it to read it; and as for those who have
read it, I would strongly advise reading something else. Then again, there is no moral
to the story, and what modern student of Psychology (not to mention Physics and Phil»
osophy) wants to read another immoral book?

Next comes He Was a Man by Rose Wilder Lane. Now that I have been asked to
review the book, I guess I’ll have to go through with it, even though I haven't read it.
But what does a little thing like not reading a book have to do with reviewing it. On
looking over the title again (which you will note I have made an exhaustive study’ of),
my imagination conjures a picture of a hero, saving a beautiful girl from drowning on the
sixth or seventh ﬂoor of the burning Natatorium, or perhaps some other building which
was not quite so ﬁrerproof. He Was a Man. Remembering that it was written by a woman,
I suppose they marry, settle down, and in the course of a couple of years raise the popu»
lation of the little village from 398 to an even 400.

We have received thirty (or at least four) requests to review Replenishing jessica.
We havenlt read the thing but it has already burned two desk pads and a wicker waste
basket — and we sort of recognize the smell. It is full of hot breath on pearl white necks
and creaking sofas. The bright orange cover simply vibrates with sex appeal and we feel
that the heroine wears Glastenburys (with or without double/breasted elbows).

STORY

jonah was a ritzy egg,

(So goes the Bible tale).

He rated ﬁrstrclass cabin

On the trans/Atlantic Whale.

His footing was unsteady,
The air not of the best.

So Ionah pushed the button
And the Whale did the rest.

MORAL

The story smells a little damp —

But believe me if you choose.

‘The whale may have gulped down Ionah
Or he, some snappy booze.

‘The street cars sure were comfy

‘To travel in that time.

‘Today we freeze in a sardine squeeze
And have to pay a dime.

 

STORY

A history to be any good

Must have its love and kisses,
But ]oseph got the old bumls rush
For neckin‘ Potipherls missus.

‘The Bible says that Joe was tempted
But the Devil he overthrew -—.

Well — that was ]oseph's story
And we'd stick by it too.

MORAL

‘The tale is an old one
(How joey got the gate),
But we need only twist some names

To bring it up to date.

If one wife isn't quite enough

‘The only thing to do,

Letls strive for bigger and better things—
Marry more than two.

' It’s Noah on a soapy skiff
‘To ﬁnd a place to park.

   

 No “one way” streets to bother him,
\ ' No signs for this or that;
He swum around until he found

A place called Ararat.
MORAL

But we look for a place to park
From Hell to town — and then
Only hear a gentil cop,

Say “Go to Hell again."

‘Them days is gone forever,

Of parking where we choose
We hafta junk our Leapin' Liz,
And don our hiking shoes.

He wrapped his beard around his ears
And wore a raccoon coat.

MORAL

The Moral of this story

Is pretty hard to get;

Lend an ear, an eye, a tooth,
And you may see it yet.

If Wolford, Sack, or Wm. Webb
Would stand the critics wail,

A raccoon wrap is no damn good,
THEY need a coat of mail.

“BALL FOUR”

“We want a party,” we said; so we met in the Barracks room to think. “Let us put our
swords and muskets away, and have a good time.“ All the tin soldiers agreed. So we put
away all our ammunition and cleared the Mess Hall, but we did not know what else to do.
We couldn’t AT EASE! until the Major said, “Let‘s have an orchestra, and good music,
and a drum, and let’s have a dance. And we can have cakes and punch.” “Great guns!"
we cried. “That will be fine!" And surrounding the brilliant Major, we begged, “Where
did you manage to think of so capital an idea?” And the Major whispered, “Dont you
know? That is what the tin soldiers do at Tech. And they call it a Military Ball!” And
we did, too.

WHAT COLLEGE DID TO ME

“John,” began my mother, “Junior leaves for college in the morning, and it is your

‘"Tain’t never, Mary; that‘s your duty,” exclaimed my old man.

Perhaps no one in Europe in 1492 had the vision to foresee
the result of civilized manis first View of the little island of
Santo Domingo, and it was little realized in modern times how
important was the discmlery that Dental Cabinet lvleclicine
Closets could be made of a solid piece of white glass.

Such a decided improvement deserved a cabinet desi n that
would be more beautiful than anything heretofore, and with
drawers that cannot sticl< or swell, because they are made of steel,
with wood fronts. New design glass trays is a late improvement.

along Forbes St., dressed in a new pair of yellow shoes and a hat that mother had bought
me. And a suit that had trouser bottoms at least eleven inches around the bottom. I was
worse than collegiate ——I was pitiful.

Nevertheless, and moreover, and, perhaps, just because, I got into a fraternity.

Howcome, I don't know, but when I woke up with a terriﬁc headache and a bump
like an Easter egg, I found myself in a room. A room with three boys in the room and me.

Three of the boys in the room asked me if I would like to join their tong.

“Yes,” I said.

Whereupon they jumped on me and put a button in my lapel. And then they had me
assume the angle and cracked me over the weak end.

The next night they had a smoker and when they asked me how I liked the Salome
dance I told them that I thought it lacked originality for it was just a takevolf from start
to ﬁnish. The brothers did not seem to like this and one of them yelled, “What did we do
with that paddle?"

Whang! A board had reached its destination and, like a good Samaritan, I turned the
other cheek and they broke two more paddles.

The next day school started and our astronomy prof took us down to the Nixon to
attend a performance of Artists and Models. I couldn't understand what that had to do
with astronomy, so I asked one of the brothers that evening, at dinner, and he told me
that it was a practical course in studying heavenly bodies.

That night after dinner I thought it would be nice to sit around the ﬁre before studying.
It seemed as if everyone else had the same idea. The fullback on the football team came
over and pushed me in the face.

“You !» ? * $ E9’ — “ ? little pledge, let me sit down for ? ~ “ * — E9” ! ? * —" he
swore ! he did! Mother had always said it was an unnecessary evil.

Almost immediately they started talking about the most horrid things. First about
gambling, then about drinking — and then about terribler things. They discussed women
in a way most disrespectful. I had to leave the room. Mother said to if I ever heard anything
like this. '

“I’m going to bed," I said.

I couldn’t get any sleep. My room was the scene of a noisy poker game. I wouldn’t
join it. I hated that sort of thing. Besides my roommate had taken my last cent with a
measly little straight.

I tried to read some Wordsworth, but the noise was too awful.

“Books! ‘us a dull and endless strife:
Come forth into the light of things,
Let Nature be your teacher.”

That was it! An inspiration’. I would leave the unthinking “dross in my room, and, going
down to Schenley Park, stroll along the deserted street, alone with my thoughts.

I went down to the Park and strolled up around the Circle. Three steps and I stepped
on a Johnny Walker bottle. There was nothing in the bottle.

I strode around some bushes and came upon a touching scene. The conversation went:

“Well, suppose my grandmother was a Rooshian, you’re part Irish yourself, so you

might as well . ”

“Well, Mother never said she had been

Looking Toward Industry  

HERE is a close relationship between the schools

and factories of our community. Young men edu-
cated in the universities of Pittsburgh look toward the
industries of Pittsburgh for an opportunity to apply
their knowledge and to continue their training. In
turn, industrial institutions look to the colleges for re»
cruits from which to select those who shall be intrusr
ted with the future progress of their organizations.

OUR plant at Wilmerding is devoted to the develop»
ment and building of apparatus that occupies a unique
place among products which assure safety and efﬁcienv
cy ‘of railway transportation. The distinctive branch
of engineering involved is fascinating in its problems
and attractive in its opportunities.

ECONOMIC TRENDS IN THE ELECTRICAL INDUSTRY

 

Have all fe big Electrical

Discoveries been made “.3

History abounds in stories of men
who at the dawn of the great in-
dustrial era in this country, pulled
up stakes and left New York,
Boston, Philadelphia, and other
eastern centers because, they said,
“these cities are as large as they can
ever become; all the opportunities
here are gone.”

So rapid has been the rise of the
electrical industry that it takes a.
phenomenal development like radio
to remind men how young the indus-
try really is, and what boundless ﬁelds

of service surround it on every side.

Four years ago radio meant as
little to the average American citizen
as do the theorems of Calculus. To-
day it approaches being a neces-
sity. Last year's sales of radio ap-
paratus reached the astounding
total of $350,000,000. In all the
annals of business this feat of liter-
ally picking a gigantic industry out
of the air goes unparalleled.

Yet radio is merely one corner of
the huge world which electrical
genius is exploring.

a blackrhand letter which read: “If you don't give $1,000 to our messenger who will call
Sunday for it we will kidnap your wife."

He replied promptly: “I don’t have the $1,000, but your proposition interests me

greatly." '

f- OU KNOW full
7" well that the Vic-

tories of your Alma
Mater on the ﬁeld of
athletics have been pos-
sible only because ofthe
ﬁtness of your teams.

This involved the right kind of men, thorough schooling
of these men by competent coaches, proper physical training,
and the best possible equipment.

In your college studies you have received from competent
teachers that_ mental coaching which will fit you for the
great contest of life.

The results of your dental training in the practice of your
profession will depend much on the excellence of your mechan-
ical equipment.

Superior workmanship requires and demands superior tools
and materials. No competent artisan will waste his time and
energy on inferior equipment. Much more essential is it that
the dentist, whose profession has to do with the healing art,
be properly equipped.

Since 1844 The House of White has
studied the needs of the dental profes-
sion. Our aim has been and always will
be to aid in the betterment of dentistry
by supplying only the best in dental sup-
plies and equipment for the profession.

You are assured when using a prod-
uct bearing the Trade 83 Mark that
you are employing the best, and that
you are equipped to win.
