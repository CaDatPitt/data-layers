beacon

eering over the wrought iron railings that encase the third floor of the Cathedral
of Learning, a bird’s eye view is free for all to see. Above you are the high
cathedral ceilings formed by intricate stone archways, supported by thick, strong
pillars that run to the ground. Below, students are hovering diligently over their
books, squinting under the poor lighting but kept awake by the discomfort
created by the authentic wooden tables and chairs. Hidden staircases, ornate
wooden doors and a massive fireplace take you away to a different world, a
different time, if you’ll only let yourself be taken there. This gothic universe is
more than an academic center—it is a step into the past.

The Cathedral was always open, whether for a late night study session,
a game of hide-and-go-seek, or to simply have quiet time alone. Its elevators shot
to the upper ﬂoors in record, ear—popping time. Stepping out of the elevator into
a dark hallway, lit only by the window at the end, the glories of Oakland, and the
entire city of Pittsburgh, were on display in a twinkling white and orange fury.

The Cathedral of Learning was the epicenter of Pitt’s campus. It was the
tallest academic building in the Western Hemisphere, hovering 42 stories above
Fifth and Forbes Avenue. After football game victories, it was guilded in golden
light. During homecoming, it was the base of a fireworks and laser display.
Its lawns were the stomping grounds for intramural sports teams and the resting-
place of tired students. The Cathedral of Learning was the icon of the University
of Pittsburgh—perhaps the one thing we will remember after many have passed.

Throwing in the coach

 

The men’s swim team

 

 
    
  

_ scent of chlorine pierced our noses, drowning out all other
T ells. The forecast in the enclosed pool area called for a hot
d humid day, as onlookers dreamed of taking a dip in the
pol themselves. But all eyes remained focused on Kevin Bast,
adiver on Pitt’s Men’s Diving Team, as he ascended the steps
of the high dive, a climb that would feel like an unstable rope
ladder to an inexperienced diver.

Water dripped from the bottom of his feet, splattering
the cold concrete below and echoing throughout the pool hall.
Voices were watered down to an eerie silence, as Bast reached
the top of the platform. He stood as isolated as a prisoner in
solitary confinement, despite the “on top of the world”
sensation of looking down on a room full of cats’ eyes. He
inhaled a deep breath, found his center of balance along the
edge of the board, and prepared for his descent.

With a flip and a twirl, Bast resembled a wave out of
water, rising to his peak and breaking toward the pool below.
The splash was soft, unlike the reaction of his teammates and
fans. Initially unaware of the crowd’s response, he remained
underwater, his ears plugged and his eyes closed. Bast finally
emerged to a room of cheers and whistles. He climbed the
small ladder out of the pool, smiled as he was congratulated,
and took a seat on the bench, ready to watch his teammate
continue the team’s run of excellence.

[women’s gymnastics]

 
  
   

ou blink, you’ll miss her—a tiny girl with dark hair and huge eyes that soars through the air with the speed of a
wk and the grace of a dove. She completes an impressive tumbling sequence with great skill—three back
ndsprings to a layout full twist. Meanwhile, a powerfully built blonde warms up on nearby mats, bending and
isting with ﬂexibility that would make a contortionist wince.
The Lady Panthers gymnastics team completed an exciting 2002 season with a sixth place finish in the
NCAA Regional Championships. The 2003 season found them with their heads held high and their talents finely
honed. Lady Panthers gymnastics boasts 15 talented women who compete with great agility in ﬂoor exercises, the
balance beam, the uneven parallel bars, and the vault. But skill in competition is just the beginning. Six of these
ladies earned recognition as All-American Scholar Athletes during the 2001-02 school year.
Cocaptains Nathalie Sulpher and Erika Goldberg and head coach Debbie Yohman lead this team of

dynamic and intelligent individuals. They’ve ﬂipped and tumbled their way into Panther fans’ hearts with a spirit
that can only be understood when watching them perform.

Students at an SGB meeting

SGB meetings allow students to voice their concerns

[student government board]

 
  
   
  

:,e University of Pittsburgh Student Government Board (SGB) seeks to
present the voice of the undergraduate student body. The needs and
A terests of students are addressed through the efforts of various committee
zafiembers within the SGB. As a result, students are able to effectively
bmmunicate with the administration, faculty, and surrounding Pittsburgh
community. The SGB also makes important decisions about allocating student
activity fee funds to student organizations within the University. Individual
students or groups seeking organizational funding may attend regular
meetings, and there are often open mic sessions during which attendants may
approach the SGB with ideas and concerns. The SGB constantly takes action to
improve student life at Pitt through event planning and program development.

According to the constitution of the board, services are designed with
the academic, socio—economic, and personal needs of students in mind. The
committees of the SGB are all unique, with different goals and interests. There
are more than 12 committees within the organization that seek to promote the
student voice, including the Freshman Affairs, Academic Affairs, Elections,
Environmental, and Governmental Relations. The Community Relations
Committee links the University to local residents and businesses through
service projects and events, while the Multicultural Council encourages
discussion about diversity and tolerance. Overall, each committee within the
SGB plays a vital role in the success of the organization by addressing specific
needs of students. The SGB represents the University of Pittsburgh because it
fosters effective communication and interaction between faculty, students,
administration, and the Pittsburgh community.

[omega psi phi]

 
  
  
  

i, Pitt’s 75-year-old African American fraternity, challenges members to
e four “cardinal virtues” of manhood, scholarship, perseverance, and
ks at Pitt have earned a reputation for approaching public service

‘ hrough events such as Greek Week and brother-sister auctions. Omega
P‘ members are involved in tutoring school children from kindergarten
through fifth grade, and they participate in walk-a-thons as one of several
fundraising efforts.

Greeks enjoy the party life as well. Fraternity parties act as safe havens
for students and brothers to socialize, relax, and dance over the weekend.
“Monday through Friday, we’re Omega men,” Omega Psi Phi senior President Joel
Edwards said. “But we party with the best of them.” Whether Pitt fraternities are
throwing a party or getting other students more involved in campus and
community life, they show undying enthusiasm while proving to be an essential
part of life at Pitt.

[chi omega]

 
 
  
  
  

l 895 at the University of Arkansas by four women who wanted to gain a
n the male-dominated business and professional world, Chi Omega

as more than 170 collegiate chapters nationwide, the largest women’s
rganization in the country. They have partnered with the Make-A-Wish
ation for philanthropy and volunteerism.

Based upon the six principles of friendship, high standards of personnel,
sincere learning and creditable scholarship, participation in campus activities,
career development, and community service, Chi Omega boasts distinguished
alumnae actress Sela Ward, author Harper Lee, a former Miss Universe, and a
former Miss America. Here at Pitt, Chi Omega sisters are very visible. President
Meggan Maromonte was cochair of Omicron Delta Kappa’s homecoming
committee this year, and sister Emily Keytack was a member of last year’s
homecoming court. These sisters are making the most of their time here,
and it shows.

[student volunteer outreach]

   
  
 

e day was foreboding, and gray clouds rolled in to cover the sun. The clock
. as only approaching 8 a.m. and yetsmall groups of students were silently
rouping around one of the newest campus additions, Sennott Square. It was
, Saturday morning, and the Pittsburgh Project was about to begin. Donning
right orange vests, students spread out, armed only with garbage bags,
gloves, and the desire to make a difference. And it is this desire that defines
the efforts of Student Volunteer Outreach (SVO).

For example, members of SVO’s Jumpstart program don’t spend their
afternoons watching TV or shopping, but instead travel to local schools,
reading to young children and giving them attention they don’t always
receive at home. Other volunteers have worked at area food banks and
spent time at animal shelters.

Instead of heading off to the white sand beaches and blue skies of
a spring break tropical paradise, students who took part in the Alternative
Spring Break program rode vans to New York City to deliver meals to AIDS
patients. They also ﬂew to New Mexico to repair trails at a state park and
traveled to Florida to build homes for Habitat for Humanity.

The students of Student Volunteer Outreach are admirable because
they frequently give and rarely receive. Instead, they are rewarded by seeing
a smile on a needy child’s face, the satisfaction of building a house, and taking
part in cleaning up their own neighborhoods. These rewards may seem small
to some, but they are changing the lives of others.

whose main goal is to serve and create a positive foundation for
African American students at Pitt. BAS also reaches out to the
entire campus community through guest lectures and general
body meetings, and every year it pushes to increase the number of
registered voters among the minority community. BAS sponsors
many annual events, including Black Week; last year’s noted
speaker was ’60s activist Angela Davis.

While there is a focus on business and issues, members
of BAS sponsor “fun” activities, too. Every year they host a Black
Homecoming, which occurs around the time of the University’s
homecoming. One popular Black Homecoming event is a comedy
show with professional acts that keep the audience laughing
hysterically. Last year’s show featured talented comedians Damon
Williams and Michael Blackson, both of whom are featured on
Black Entertainment Television’s Comic View. The Black Action BAS members at the Black Homecoming dance
Society members continue to strive for excellence in all they do.

They have steadily served and provided a positive and nurturing
atmosphere for African American students and will continue to do
so for years to come.

membership in a minority honor society
called Freedom Mentoring and Leadership
Development Honor Society. Freedom is
an organization that recognizes academic
excellence by reaching out to high
achieving minorities on Pitt’s campus.
Freedom began three years ago with
only 15 students, and it hasn’t stopped
growing. Last year Freedom inducted
about 97 students, along with new
President Sharae Bryant.

The Freedom Mentoring and Leadership Development Honor Society Symposium

Although BAS and Freedom are
separate organizations, both target ethnic
minority students. Unlike BAS though,
Freedom is open to all ethnic minorities,
Latino, Asian, and African American students
who have a 3.0 QPA and a minimum of 50
credits are eligible for inclusion. Freedom
works hard to help retain minority students
through various forms of assistance, from
financial aid and scholarships to personal
problems——handled through peer mentoring
and support. Freedom is an organization that is
committed to success and to the achievement
of academic excellence of ethnic minority
students at the University of Pittsburgh.

e time students return to the University of Pittsburgh from winter

5, they’ve usually had enough of the cold Pittsburgh weather. With a
.emester of classes upon them, they might already be looking forward
ring break. Some students return home or stay at school during

“ ‘ring break to work and make some extra money, but the majority are
ready to get away and have fun with friends.

My father’s spring break advice has always been, “You can go
wherever you want, I just don’t want to see you on  When I
think spring break, I think hot sun, sandy beaches, meeting new
people, and long nights. For students who think like myself, popular
locations to visit are Cancun, Jamaica, the Bahamas, and my personal
favorite, Panama City Beach, Florida.

For those students who’d rather be more productive during
break, there is also the popular Alternative Spring Break. The
University of Pittsburgh offers students the opportunity to go to
different locations throughout the United States and beyond to
complete a service project, such as building houses or helping to
educate children.

Either option is sure to bring the opportunity to meet people and
have a great time. By the end of the week, students return to classes and ,
the humdrum of everyday life with higher spirits and renewed enthusiasm
—which surely helps motivate them through the end of the semester.

“rning of September 19, I threw on some clothes, brushed my teeth and
ran like a crazy woman from my apartment to the Frick Fine Arts
making it there just as my watch ticked 7:50 a.m.

" I was up at that indecent hour to help the touring crew of the CBS
‘lime drama “As The World Turns” for the day while they filmed some scenes
on the Pitt campus. In the episode being filmed, the young cast members—
Alison, Lucy, and Aaron——were on the run from the Oakdale police. They ran
from college campus to college campus gaining notoriety and ended up
stopping at Pitt, where they crashed a cocktail party taking place on the lawn

of the Frick Fine Arts Building.

When the cameras finally rolled, I found myself standing silently near
an angular man wearing a “Pitt Athletics” T—shirt. His enormous headset and
intense demeanor led me to believe he was the director—that and the fact that
he was the guy shouting, “Annnnd  action!” before each take. Between takes,
a diminutive woman clad in black pants and carrying a walkie-talkie and a giant
Kipling backpack rushed over to me and grabbed me by the arm.

“Clare, right?” she said.

“Yes, I’m Clare. What can I do for you?”

“Today, Clare, you’re going to be working for Chris Goutman, the
director. You’ll be his assistant today, OK? Stick by him, and do whatever he asks
you to do.”

My first thought was, “Oh. My. God.”

“So the first thing you can do, Clare,” the woman said, “is go get him
a Diet Coke from the cooler in our bus. Can you do that?”

Of course I could.

And so my day finally began.

ale green floors and lofty ceilings
swallow me up the moment I step
inside, and my eyes slowly adjust to the
dimness. I was transfixed by the beauty
of the Commons Room as a freshman,
left to linger in its enchanting corridors
throughout these years.

However, looking around the
room I see other students, like myself,
sitting at tables studying, talking,
laughing, and eating. I begin to feel
more comfortable and decide to take a
seat. Throngs of students rush past me
to other parts of the room, to classes,
or for a cigarette break outside.

 

A young woman, decked in purple,

is poised in a throne-like chair in the
center. Another sleeps curled up on a
bench, oblivious to the Various sounds
that bombard the room.

The screeching of sneakers,
the echos of professors instructing their
classes, and the Voices of study groups
and tutorial sessions being held at
the help desks hold the aura of the
Commons Room, full of collegiate life
and Pittsburgh spirit.

_ ' the night the lights blew out in Schenley Hall? Perhaps a few can

r this day in 1959, but fewer still remember that Schenley Hall even
et it was a stepping stone for WPTS—FM, then known as WPGH-AM,
M V on attempted to go on air for the first time. Today it thrives as the
University’s student radio station, and together with The Pitt News and
Panther Prints, makes up an exceptional trio of student media resources.

With 17 unadulterated watts—the last low-wattage radio station to
be commissioned by the Federal Communications Comission—the student-
operated radio station celebrated its 18th birthday as WPTS on August 26,
2002. The station prides itself on its eclectic mix of sounds, artists, and genres
and hopes to challenge listeners to appreciate a diverse variety of music.
Pitt students can also take satisfaction in their daily paper, T/ye Pitt

News. Entirely student written and managed, it’s one of only three college
newspapers in the state to be published daily. Since its 1906 inception,

Tbe Pitt News has been a consistent source of Pitt-oriented news for the
Oakland community. Today, students can even read The Pitt News on their
Palm Pilots or receive headlines via e-mail.

Right down the hall from the paper is the talented staff of the
Pam/oer Prints yearbook. Actually known as a memory book, this
nontraditional yearbook does not have individual pictures of students.
Instead, the book—given to students at graduation—focuses on articles and
memories that sum up an undergrad’s time at Pitt.
Each of these exceptional media outlets speak volumes about the

talent and dedication of students.

e University of Pittsburgh Repertory Theatre has always been an excellent

ace to showcase the talent of some of Pitt’s finest actors, technicians, and

rectors. Each of the campus’s three unique venues—a traditional

oscenium stage, a brand-new thrust, and an intimate studio—offer artists
exciting opportunity to perform or display their talents.

This year’s season marked the opening of the highly anticipated
Charity Randall Theatre, a gloriously renovated mainstage performance venue
in the upper level of the Stephen Foster Memorial. This event was marked by
the presentation of Much Ado About Nothing, a masterful showing of one of
Shakespeare’s finest works. Other shows included the tragic Ballad Hunter,
the poignant Mad Forest, and the heart-wrenching Uncle Vanya.

The 2002 semester hailed the revival of the Steel City Underground
Theatre Society, an undergraduate organization dedicated to working as a
supplement to, but independently of, the Department of Theatre Arts.

A group of dedicated students led the organization in hosting events
committed to providing Pitt students additional opportunities to not only to
showcase their talents, but also to socialize with others of similar dramatic,
theatrical, and improvisational interests.

From the opening of a newly renovated theater space to a season
marked with a mixture of tragedy and vaudeville, it was quite an exhilarating
year. Original choreography, outrageous laughter, and dazzling music rounded
out this masterful season of performances.

[intramural sports]

 
 
   

starts among a small crowd of raucous

l as the handsome soccer player lines up

. “Ian! Ian! Ian!” Ian Buggs, captain of last
mpionship intramural soccer team, kicks
the ball Wlth enough fury to knock the goalie off
his feet and rack up another point for his team.
The huddle of student fans goes crazy, yelling and
clapping frantically before settling down on the
rough turf of the Charles L. Cost Center.

Intramurals are a fantastic option for

students who like to play hard-core sports, but who
are not feeling the varsity vibe. Even students new
to a sport are welcomed, since the purpose of Pitt’s
intramural program is to allow skills to be acquired,
developed, and used. Some of the intramural
sports offered include soccer, football, rugby,
volleyball, and lacrosse. There are club sports to

be played as well, with players no less skilled and
enthusiastic than their intramural counterparts.
Take Club Rugby for example, whose members

traveled to Ohio to win the championship this year
and have been invited to compete in another
championship in the Bahamas during spring break.
Each component of Pitt’s sports network

has its own set of teams and coaches, as well as
intense fans. At Intramural Women’s Lacrosse,
players walk off the field to nothing short of
cheers, hoots, and hollers. A group of more refined
and gifted players is hard to find on this campus.
Between intramural and club sports, Pitt students
have ample opportunity to become part of these
exciting and talented teams.

; e autumn sun hits the ripples, and the water glistens as if diamonds had been sprinkled across the river. Eight
-; en head out along the docks of the Pittsburgh rowing club ready to take their seats in the long, slender boat.
he oars hang off the sides, firmly strapped into the oarlocks. The paddles are face down in the water, and the
 ms stand diagonally, appearing as though they were swords held up for a king’s walk.

Facing the other seven rowers, the Coxswain takes his seat at the head of the boat, and his stance
suggests that he is ready to conduct a brilliant orchestra.

The Coxswain bellows instructions. The rowers know that the regatta, the tournament, is fast
approaching, and everyone wants to be on the same wave. The paddles of oars slap the water, softly sinking below
the surface and re-emerging for a gasp of air. Back and forth, left and right, up and down they glide. In order to
keep the boat in a straight line, the rowers imagine walls on either side of them with as small a space as possible
between each side. Looking ahead, their eyes are already on the prize.

congratulations!

[from the president]

  

‘ “" “like a simple step, but one of the alumni
association’s boldest moves was to develop a much concise
mission statement. What was once three paragraphs long is
now a single sentence: “To support the University and enrich
the lives of alumni worldwide.”

gm\i\ * W.»
yr, Wmmwwll

And while the message grows richer with the addition of each
new voice, the common bond among those voices is constant.
Alumni association members remember the University, the
education we received, the people we met, and the professors
who mentored us. Pitt has played a major role in our lives and
yours. Our goal at the Pitt Alumni Association is to keep that
connection strong.

Pitt Alumni Association board member Orlando Antigua

We now have a board and officers who mirror our alumni daughter, OV1:,t:,t 6 °meC°mmg Pregame [cm W" '5

population. For the first time, our president-elect is from as far

away as San Francisco, and our officers hail from cities that literally stretch from coast to coast. We also have

104 Pitt Clubs and representatives around the U.S. and beyond so you can feel a part of the University community
wherever you choose to live.

The advantages of membership grow daily. You should take pride in your accomplishment.
We do. You are members of an elite and extraordinary group. Congratulations.

UniVersityofPittsburgh 2003

 

 

 ,» Neer numbers tell the story. Today, more Pitt graduates from more parts of the world are taking an active role
niversity’s future than ever before. In the Pitt Alumni Association alone, we have grown from 9,500
members five years ago to 14,000 today. Life members now number 1,500—up from about 100 in 1997.

And Pitt’s success is a two-way street:
As the prestige of the University grows,
so does the value of your degree.

All of this success is possible because the
University and the alumni speak with a
common voice. When we formed our
strategic plan, we worked together with
the administration to make sure we had
a collective, common vision for
supporting Pitt and enriching the lives of
both our students and alumni. We
wanted the Pitt community from
Singapore to San Francisco to the South
Hills all speaking the same language.

;«m.\, “

Alumni enjoy a dinner in Italy during an Alumni Travel and Learn Program.

The results are tangible. Literally and figuratively, Pitt is leading the way.

You are the product of a Pitt education. Take pride in the University’s achievements. The Pitt
Alumni Association’s mission is very clear: “To support the University of Pittsburgh and enrich the
lives of alumni worldwide.” Join the alumni association for Pitt, and join it for you.

A Message from the SGB President

 

Universityof Pittsburgh 2003

The University of Pittsburgh is on the fast track to becoming one
of the most elite universities in the country. When I first ran for Student
Government Board (SGB), I felt that in order for the University to
advance academically, it must also strive for the same standard of
excellence in student life. This year, SGB set a course to work for all
students, from those involved with campus organizations to those on the
verge of graduating. If we can make changes that enhance the daily lives
of students, we lay the foundation for a better University community.

When state funding was cut this year, resulting in tuition
increases at many Pennsylvania universities, Pitt’s SGB was among the
first to respond by organizing a joint lobbying effort with Penn State
University to ensure that student voices were heard in Harrisburg. With
the help of other University organizations, we had one of the largest
voter registration drives in years, which was followed by one of the most
successful voter turnouts in recent memory.

Building on our belief that learning does not end in the
classroom, SGB has also worked hard to maximize students’ full potential
by securing more money for student organizations and club sports.The
board has also worked tirelessly on ways to make Van Call more efficient,
and hope this will result in increased service to the South Side, the Strip
District, and The Waterfront.

At my inauguration, I stated that to make change happen,

it would take a collective “partnership for progress.” I would like to
thank the chancellor for his support, Joyce Giangarlo for her true
leadership in student and personal development, Donna Mihalik for being
the glue that keeps SGB and much of student life running, and everyone
in the Office of Student Life. I must also acknowledge members of the
former student activities office, specifically, Joe Cavalla, who meant so
much to me on my journey through Pitt. He is truly missed.

Pitt students and alumni have been making an impact throughout
the world for years, and now is the time for graduates to make an impact
as active alumni. I have no doubt that the class of 2003 will continue a

' 216-year tradition of excellence. Congratulations on your achievement.

Hail to Pitt!

here is an elegantly handsome marble staircase that winds itself into a wall.

the perfect setting in which someone could easily imagine a bride. bedecked

in white beads and ivory lace. her cathedral train spilling down the stairs.

If students could picture this. it might be the first indication that their

student union is no ordinary campus hub. Built in 1898, the \V'illiam Pitt

Student Union was originally the Hotel Schenley. the most stylish place to

stay in Pittsburgh. Its plush velvet carpeting was touched by the soles of

such celebrities as actress Katherine Hepburn and former president

\X"oodrow Wilson. The University of Pittsburgh acquired the union in 1956
and converted it into an all-male dorm, where the famous Mike
Ditka stayed while he was a student.

{ﬂag yaw Egﬁﬂvglrg Now this prestigious structure is home to more than 300
clubs, organizations, and activities. Venture up to the sixth floor
and one can rub elbows with the Student Government Board
or members of The Black Action Society. Want to mingle with
some of the most assiduous writers on Pitts campus? join the
newspaper or yearbook staff on the fourth floor. The union
hosts many of Pitt’s finest resources and organizations, such
as PITT ARTS, the Study Abroad Office, Semester at Sea, and

Student Volunteer Outreach. It also boasts a beautiful ballroom, the
Schenley Cafe, ajazz Hall of Fame, and a student art gallery. And, if nothing
else, the red velvet sofas are the most comfortable spots on campus!

 footsteps of great minds and timeless
traditions leave their imprints on the Cathedral

   
 

 Learning lawn. The lawn serves as a refuge

-:l a breezy afternoon nap and holds the
:tl11l‘i‘lvs“ef’crets whispered between couples and

memories of laughter in the sunshine.

The lawn somehow renews itself for
each and every person. Binding the past to
the present, it symbolizes all that life at the
University of Pittsburgh has to offer.

Experiences shared at Pitt occur year
after year on the lawn, amidst volleyball games
and Frisbee, sunbathing and studying. While
leaning against a tree, listening to the wind
rustling through the branches, one can forget
the bustle of the surrounding city.

This year, on September 11, 2002, the
lawn was consecrated by 3,041 miniature flags
to commemorate the victims of the terrorist
attack of 2001. Students and other members of

 
 

UniversityofPittsburgh 2003

the Pittsburgh community united in a ceremony
of respect, ending with a solemn ROTC lowering
of the flag. Luminaries were displayed along the
walkways, casting a soft glow on all who were
drawn to pray or meditate.

The Cathedral lawn begins a new
metamorphosis each year as students and
professors come and go. Its colorful leaves turn
brown under winter’s snow. Then, as winter
fades and the spring brings the city back to life,
they become green once again with innocent
sunshine and laughter.

As graduates say goodbye to Pitt and
new students prepare to follow in their
footsteps, the Cathedral lawn remains a long-
standing symbol of Pitt’s everlasting community.

he steeple of the Heinz Memorial Chapel rises majestically, taking
its place amid the clouds. Its grand doors beckon passersby to
enter as pipe organ music swells, filling the sanctuary.

The chapel offers a haven for reflection on the spiritual
values of education, while its inviting pews also give visitors the
opportunity to embrace beauty and serenity. Each aspect of the
building, from its glorious arches and Gothic-style stone carvings
to its pictorial glass windows, holds special meaning and
significance. Sitting in the intricately carved oak pews, the
impression is one of grandiose magnificence that causes
chapel visitors to become engrossed in the beauty of its detail.
The sunshine filters in through the stained glass, where each
windowpane represents temperance, truth, tolerance, or courage,
depicting an equal number of men and women.

The mysterious appeal of the Heinz Memorial Chapel
can be attributed to its reverence for all things spiritual.
Dedicated to no single religious denomination, it is the setting
for various religious services, weddings, concerts, memorial
services, and even classes. The Heinz Memorial Chapel began
as a gift, founded in the 19305 by Henry John Heinz in honor
of his mother. Today, its presence on University of Pittsburgh
grounds offers a unique gift to visitors—peace, inspiration,
and meditation.

- .. Schenley Park, the third largest public park on the eastern seaboard, lies just a short walk from the
commotion of the sidewalks and traffic-filled streets. It offers something for everyone, from swimming or ice
skating to simply basking in the sun with a Physics book. On Flagstaff Hill, students gather to see concerts and
movies. In the shade—studying, sleeping, and picnicking——students enjoy the peacefulness of the park.

Stepping into Phipps Conservatory and Botanical Gardens, students begin a journey around the world.
A jungle of plants greets adventurers with its maze of palms, bamboo, and ferns. Next lies a forest of butterﬂies
and every eye-catching plant imaginable. From there, the powerful scents of fruit and spices further entice the
senses. Soon the smell lingers away and visitors are in the dry humid desert with prickly cacti at each turn.
The next stop leads to ajapanese Courtyard with native plants and scenery.

Dinosaurs and mummies come to life at the Carnegie Museum of Natural History. In fact, the Wild Blue
Planet exhibit covers every kind of species found on earth. Art enthusiasts prefer the Carnegie Museum of Art,
with its works by French Impressionists, Post-Impressionists, and 19th- and 20th-century American artists.

The Original Hot Dog Shop, affectionately known as “the O,” is a late night gathering spot for students
with grumbling stomachs. They can often be found grabbing a quick bite to eat or a midnight dinner after the
cafeterias close, when more work still must be completed.

SHRS is equipped yvith a number of research and practice laboratories to
train tomorroyvs health practitioners and clinicians.

For some graduates, work begins in a roaring ambulance.
Students in the emergency medicine program learn life-saving procedures
to sustain a patient during transport, while other SHRS programs focus
on the research, technology, and behind-the-scenes work that keeps a
healthcare facility running properly.

Food can have a huge impact on patient health and
rehabilitation. Cooking in the mock kitchen of Forbes Tower, students in
the clinical dietetics and nutrition program put theory into practice using
stringent preparation guidelines and dietary expertise to create
nutritionally beneficial meals.

To provide excellent and efficient care. hospitals, rehabilitation
centers, and healthcare agencies also require efficient data management.

ter with the Petersen Events Center was an accident during spring semester last year,

 _ en trying to ﬁnd Victoria Hall. Due to my complete lack of direction and the fact that

{I  H  also known as the School of Nursing~—something I had yet to leam—I hiked all the way

I up Iblthropﬁétreet. I then saw the construction of what is now, in my eyes, a magniﬁcent model for the
events center of the future.

last summer, the Pete ofﬁcially opened for students, with festivities that included performances
by Pitt Band members, cheerleaders, and a speech by Chancellor Mark Nordenberg.

I recently took another trip into Panther Country to see the ﬁnishing touches of the center,
where I will accept my diploma during April’s commencement ceremony. The unique structure is made
up almost entirely of glass windows, which looks amazing when the building is lit up at night.

A gigantic Panther emblem welcomes visitors entering the complex, sharing the ﬁrst ﬂoor with the
team store and ticket ofﬁce. Heading up the escalator to the second ﬂoor, I was welcomed by the smells
of the different foods being cooked and served at the food court. It was packed with students and
workers in scrubs from the nearby hospital—all enjoying a tasty lunch. For those wanting to burn off
the extra calories from their hearty sub or chicken sandwich, the Baierl Student Recreation Center is
just steps from the food court.

n a seemingly endless series ofgrand openings and special
eyents heralding the birth of the Petersen Eyents Center.
the first concert was a standout.

The screaming. whistling darkness melted as emerald
yyayes flooded the stage and a plum glow settled on Adam
l)urit/. and the rest of the Counting Croyys. The croyyd howled
in anticipation. reyyed-up from the solid performance of the
opening act.

Drums pound out a hard grooye. irresistible to the
hungry field of fans. rocking on the balls of their feet with their
hands yyaying in the air. Durit/Is husky yoice soars aboye the
croyyd. filtered betyyeen azure beams that seem to search the
delighted faces of the crowd. The singer lightheartedly
stumbles across the stag’. broyyn dreadlocks bouncing off of his
forehead. “\‘y"e all yyanna be big. big stars  he crooned. and
the croyyd sung along.

Then. he thoughtfully sat at the piano and plays a
lullaby. “_lessica." As he plucked out the last three haunting
notes. he chuckled as the croyyd cheered. and candidly added.
“You knoyy. anytime you yyant a cheer. all you haye to do is play
these three notes ... or say f——. Thats Sl‘1()\\'l)lZ s——.“

The energy feeding both fans and Croyys led to tyyo
encore performances. Surely. another yisit from the (jroyys

eon letters shine flamboyantly from Forbes Avenue. Fire engine
red and canary yellow signs advertise the Original Hot Dog Shop.
The famous Oakland eatery, selling 15 tons of french fries every
week, is only one of Pitt’s street-side hot spots. “The  hot
dogs were heralded by Gourmet magazine, but they still have
competition from Scotty, the gregarious outdoor vendor near
Hillman Library who boasts some of the best grub in town.

The streets of Oakland—Forbes and Fifth Avenues
particularly—have some diverse offerings. One can meet, greet,
mingle, and eat all within the span of a few blocks. Near
Bruegger’s Bagels, a robust man belts a Gospel tune from atop

his perpetual perch—a wooden crate. Across the street
from the CD Warehouse rests a character commonly
Idld YOU kﬂOW?] known as Sombrero Man. His colorful hat slumps

crookedly on his head as he asks passersby for spare
change. Near the Cathedral of Learning, one finds Chaz,
outdoor vendor extraordinaire, who thinks of each passing
student as his “cousin.”

From the intriguing Carnegie museums, past the 24-

there is never a lack of street activity. Perhaps most

enticing of all are restaurants such as Fuel & Fuddle, India

early bird menus to tantalize students’ taste buds and appease
their budgets. The streets of Oakland are anything but dull!

t’s 2 a.m., and a sleepy student is coaxing the last drops of coffee from his
cup. Smiling at the librarian on duty, he tosses the cup in the garbage before
stumbling out into the night. There’s nothing like a little caffeine to fuel a
late-night study session, so the Hillman Library’s new coffee shop can
sometimes seem like a godsend.

Hillman is the largest of Pitt’s 16 libraries, making it a popular
destination for both students and professors. Others include more specific
collections, such as the Business Library, the Frick Fine Arts Library, and the
Engineering Library. The Hillman has a more general, yet very inclusive
selection of yolumes—more than 1.5 million in all. It also boasts an
impressive study area, five floors of books, and a seating capacity of 1,500.

A favorite cramming location, particularly during midterms and finals,
the Hillman houses some excellent resources. The Africana Studies
department is well supported by the African American Collection, which
includes several of Malcolm X’s pieces. The librarys newest addition came
last fall, with the opening of the Latin American Reading Room. Students
also appreciate the computer labs generously scattered throughout Hillman.
In addition to its reading materials and computers, there is more that makes
Hillman a great place to study. There are couches, desks, and large tables for
study groups, and the lighting is always just right. Quiet rooms are perfect
for crunch time, and a steaming cup of coffee from the appropriately named
Cup & Chaucer is never far away.

An Arrival Survival volunteer

as only 8:30 in the morning, but the first day of moving in was

M eady in full swing. After joining a line of cars similarly packed to
 brim, Pitt police finally told us it was okay to enter the garage.

4’ ce inside, there was a mad scramble to maneuver through the
Trze of bright yellow and blue carts, but I finally signed a cart rental

K form and began to unload my belongings.

The garage was hot, muggy, and cramped. I piled my
belongings into a cart and I was then informed by a tired but kind
group of people in pale yellow “Arrival Survival” shirts that the line
wrapping around the garage was my next stop. In my hurry to get out
of the sweltering garage, I realized that I hadn-’t picked up wristbands
for my family so they could enter the dorm with me. I left them in line
and returned to the stand where I picked up my cart. Wristbands ﬁnally
in hand, I retrieved my parents.

We crept toward the small alcove at the elevator entrance.

A kind man helped us get the cart into the elevator and took us to the
19th ﬂoor where we found my room. My roommate had not yet arrived,
so I unpacked my things, met my resident assistant (RA), and set off
with my family to return the carts and get our car out of the garage.
During our descent, we picked up more families, until the elevator
couldn’t hold another person. I could finally say that I was moved in,
although I had yet to meet my roommate.

*' the eighth floor of Tower C. I hurriedly
anxious to get rid of my parents and meet
new peo “e.

Living in a single does not make meeting
folks more difficult, despite what I had been told.

In fact, I’ve met so many people through classes,
PittStart, my ﬂoor, and parties that it is impossible to
remember all their names and faces. Nothing has been
stranger than the transition from hanging out with
friends I’ve had for years to hanging out with people
I’ve known for a few hours.

I used to be able to count on my parents to
hassle me when I was too loud, but now, my resident
assistant (RA) fulfills that same role. Unfortunately for
my grades, he can’t stop me from playing Madden with
my neighbors instead of studying, staying up until 4
a.m. on a routine basis, or partying on Thursday night.

 

After weeks of eating on campus, it is easy to
understand the term “freshman 15.” Despite the wide
array of campus eateries, I’ve visited Pizza Hut in the
Schenely Cafe for the last five days straight. Breakfast
there is restaurant quality, which is too bad, considering
I am never up in time to get it. Eddie’s is good in small
doses, but I’ve found the Marketplace to be unremarkable.
The new Petersen Events Center’s food court offers a
delicious alternative to campus dining, but only with the
use of dining dollars or PittFunds. While consuming fast
food seven days a week used to be a dream come true,
I’ve slowly come to realize it doesn’t compare to the
comforts of home cooking.

Freedom is what separates home life from
college life. And although that Thursday night party on
Atwood Street sounds awfully inviting, I have a 10 a.m.
Intro. to Anthropology class on Friday. But that’s what
college is all about——learning discipline in the face of
grueling temptations.

a sighteato behold. Most of us, used to second-rate high school gymnasiums, were in awe
of thegorgeous design of the state-of-the-art multimillion dollar facility. A procession of
Pittsburgh graduates from years past filed in, followed by Chancellor Nordenberg. It was
easy to feel lost and distraught after our parents left us behind. However, the
chancellor, along with the presence of University alumni, let us know that they would
help us along the way as we carried on a proud legacy of achievement.

As a perfect addendum to the event, a picnic was held on the lawn outside
Petersen, underneath a baking, late summer sun and blue sky. Salads, barbecued foods,
and pasta were in abundance. It provided a perfect environment to mingle with friends
I’d already made and to meet new ones.

Later in the afternoon, we boarded luxury cruisers on the river. Our
destination? Heinz Field. With a setting sun in the background and a cool breeze,
it was a beautiful evening. As the boat raced toward Heinz Field, it was easy to reflect
on the day’s events, and I somehow knew the next four years were going to be more
than I imagined them to be.

As a sworn Syracuse fan, the visit to Heinz Field marked a transition to
Panther blue and gold. Mingling with the players, it was easy to make the transition.
Excitement was in the air, knowing I’d be at Heinz seven Saturdays a year to cheer on
the team. After the perfect chain of the events of the day, I became a Panther at heart.

3 anticipation in the crowd rises as the night begins. Clad and polished in dresses and skirts, the girls speak
C’ hushed tones and giggle softly as they wait to be led from the Cathedral of Learning to the luminous
 nnolly Ballroom in Alumni Hall. Once inside, the scene is set for a special evening of traditional ceremony
 the 82nd annual Lantern Night.

Lantern Night’s purpose, as explained by members of the Alumni Council of the Pitt Alumni
Association, is to “welcome freshman women to the University as they begin their quest for knowledge and
truth in today’s world.” The ceremony opens with greetings and welcoming remarks from several association
and council presidents. Chancellor Mark A. Nordenberg’s speech proudly stresses the groundbreaking
accomplishments of the 2002 Distinguished Alumna Valerie McDonald Roberts. As Roberts takes the stage,
her persona commands the respect and attention of a rapt audience. “Isn’t she the coolest,” whispers one
girl under her breath.

During the course of her address, Roberts speaks genuinely of the challenges and wisdom she has
gained through her experiences as a student, mother, and African American. The freshmen women are
encouraged to work hard and stay focused to achieve the prize of an education at Pitt, while remembering
to speak up for their values and beliefs.

In true Lantern Night tradition of women supporting women, the students are each given a lantern
that is lit by parents and grandparents who are Pitt alumni. As the girls spill out into the darkness, their unity
is symbolized by their ﬂickering lights.

V eir smiles are eager. It is the evening of the seventh annual Night of

The men will proceed from the Union Ballroom to the
Cathedral Commons Room, where they will receive a distinguished
Panther pin as a symbol of their launch into University life. They later
take part in a joint reception with the freshmen women, who have just
celebrated Lantern Night.

Night of the Panther celebrates the first-year men and their
quest for knowledge and truth. There is always a notable guest
speaker—this year it was 1965 Pitt graduate and CEO of TRACO Robert
P. Randall—to encourage and inspire the new undergrads. The panther
has long been a symbol of pride and strength, embodying the beauty
and virtue of the Pitt community. These values continue to shine forth
through such traditions as Night of the Panther, inspiring the students
who exemplify the brilliant future of Pittsburgh.

v. a as a sort of induction into the university, but it was an entirely

new experience for me. Resisting the temptation to dole out my meager
cash to the homeless was another new worry, but I usually managed to
resist for my bank account’s sake.

The first week of school provided plenty of extracurricular
opportunities, like the student activities fair. I entered near the Litchﬁeld
Towers and was suddenly overwhelmed by all the organizations from
which to chose. I found myself drawn to hundreds of tables, each
brimming with diverse opportunity.

While waiting in line at The Book Center, I realized for the first
time that I came here to get an education and not to party for four years.
My heart sank as I was handed the white box, stuffed to its breaking
point with required reading material.

College classes are shockingly different than high school
classes. A refreshing change was that Pitt professors are actually
passionate about what they teach! Big lecture classes are not nearly as
bad as people make them out to be, because the weekly recitations help
make these classes personal and easy to understand. In my smaller,
discussion-oriented classes, I sometimes feel overwhelmed by everyone
else’s brilliant commentaries—so much so that I usually keep my mouth
shut and don’t contribute to the discussion. But hopefully, the
intimidation I feel will wear away soon, and I’ll carve a little place out
for myself here at Pitt.

I can’t wait for some of our other activities we
have planned, such as visits to ethnic restaurants,
a German “Fashings Party,” foreign film
screenings, and a trip to New York in February.

Sometimes international students only
stay a year at Pitt, so I know that next year just

Congratulations on your graduation from the University of
Pittsburgh. This book of essays and photos by your fellow students
is meant to keep memories of your Pitt experiences alive and
vibrant. Your Student Government Board, the Pitt Alumni
Association, and the University administration have partnered to
produce this volume, which serves as a keepsake of impressions
for the class of 2005.

The memories you have accumulated here—-most of them
warm and happy—will always include the indelible mark of
September 11, 2001. But you can take pride that you were a part
of the concerned and caring response this community mustered
in the wake of that event, and part of the beautiful and moving
September 11, 2002 memorials we all participated in last fall.

As you look to the future, know that you are entering a world
in need of the knowledge, talents, and skills you developed at the
University of Pittsburgh. Some of what you have achieved will be
apparent from your formal credentials. But many of the truly
important talents you nurtured here are not formally recorded on
your diploma: the ability to analyze problems and think critically, to
gather information using an array of newfound tools, to put yourself
in another person’s shoes, to work in teams, and always to continue
learning. These lasting benefits of higher education will help you
grow and lead throughout your life and will pay lasting dividends, for you and for society.

As you now move on to pursue new opportunities and meet new challenges,
we ask you to remember that you will always remain part of the University of Pittsburgh.
Our extended family of alumni can be found in every state in the United States and
in most of the world’s nations. One of the most rewarding ways to nurture your ties with
Pitt is through active participation in our alumni programs, which are rich in mutual
benefits for graduates and for the institution. Participation in these programs is one
of the best ways to continue building the talents and skills that are the foundation of
your Pitt education.

We hope your alma mater will forever play a part in your life and that you will
continue to take part in the exciting enterprise that is the University of Pittsburgh as
we move farther into the 21st century.

On the Cathedral of Learning lawn, many students had

and gorgeous sunbathers. I pack up again.

Inside the Cathedral, I took a seat in a secluded corner
and again set out to learn the information. There weren’t any
distractions, but the dimly lit room made me very tired. I even
found myself dozing while trying to read about the oh-so-

}the early crisp days of fall, when students yearn for the long-lost days of summer and dread the promise of
‘Pittsburgh winter full of exams and research papers, the Pitt campus is alive with activity. As we strive for
me pleasure in our daily routines, we head to Schenley Park, with its promise of sun on our faces and a
jeeze in our hair as we struggle through 10 chapters of anthropology. We break from time to time to watch
game of Frisbee, and we cheer when a golden retriever takes off with the ﬂuorescent yellow disk clenched
firmly between his teeth.

As 2 o’clock approaches, we linger, searching for a reason to skip a boring lecture and enjoy the
lackadaisical day. By some small miracle, a friend approaches like a fairy godmother and convinces us to board
the bus to freedom. The 501 lets us off in Squirrel Hill, and we run across the street to Color Me Mine, where
we practice our painting skills on ceramic pumpkins just in time for Halloween. We take in a movie, paying
a discounted price to gaze at Matt Damon during his attempts to save the world. When the disorientation of
the darkened theatre wears off, we decide that we have both the money and the time to do some shopping
in Shadyside. We realize our money will not go far on Walnut Street, but we window shop anyway, imagining
what we would buy with endless funds. Shopping bags in hand after a splurge on clearance sweaters, we
board the bus back to campus with the satisfaction of a gratifying day.

, dition. Innovation. Excellence.
The University that began in a humble log cabin in 1787 has

ls 215-year history, and Pitt graduates have made the world healthier,
safer, and more tolerant.

Achievements in tolerance oftenbegin on campus. William
Hunter Dammond was significant as the University’s first African American
graduate in 1893, but his pioneering work in railroad engineering proved
a more enduring legacy. Showing remarkable foresight, the University
overturned a class vote not to admit women, and sisters Margaret and
Stella Stein tied for first place in their 1898 class.

Pitt ranks in the top 10 of American universities for attracting
research funding from the National Institutes of Health. The University’s
commitment to improving medical science can be seen in Jonas Salk‘s
1955 polio vaccine and Thomas Starzl and Henry Bahnson’s double
transplant operation in 1984, the first operation of its kind in the world.
Other firsts include the successful 1896 ﬂight of Samuel Langley’s power
driven, heavier-than-air machine and Reginald Fessenden’s broadcast of
the human voice in 1906.

Recent faculty achievements include David Turnshek’s 1991
identification of the most distant galaxy known and Jeffrey Schwartz’s
discovery of a new genus and species of primate in 1997. Meanwhile,
Pitt’s role in the 2001 creation of the Life Sciences Greenhouse has the
university poised for more scientific breakthroughs, and Pitt continues
to receive multiple grants for the prevention of bioterrorism.

From Oscar winners (Gene Kelly) and Pulitzer Prize-winning
authors (Michael Chabon) to Olympic gold medalists (John Woodruff)
and Heisman Trophy recipients (Tony Dorsett), Pitt alumni demonstrate
a commitment to excellence intrinsic to the University itself.

a prospective employer, and process the necessary paperwork through the Office of Experiential Learning.
The benefits of internships make the time investment worthwhile. These include the hands-on experience of
building a resume, networking, and connecting students to the “real world” of their chosen field.

Chemistry major Elly Speicher spent one summer as an intern in a water quality lab at the Brookfield

Zoo in Chicago, where she collected and analyzed aquatic samples in order to maintain healthy nutrient levels.
“I would like to someday work in analytical environmental chemistry, so I expect that I will make use of
everything I learned during my internship,” Speicher said. While she was researching zoo data in Chicago,
fellow Pitt student Les Penland was creating Web-based logos as a studio arts intern. Penland worked alongside
staff members of the Office of Experiential Learning preparing .Sk.€.I.Ch.€..S for i.€.Vi,€W, finalizing iQgQ§; Qiifl
codesigning the office brochure. Overall, interns such as Speicher and Penland gained valuable learning
opportunities that provided insight into the competitive professional workplace.

Students dancing away at Club M (a.k.a Metropol)

toward graduation with a mixture of anticipation and dread:
an I find a job I’ll like? Should I get a master’s degree?
eantime though, there is still a lot of fun to be had.
 students can focus on their academic interests, rather than
reluctantly slogging through prerequisite classes. It means moving out of the
dorm and into an apartment——an event usually marked by a shopping spree
at Target and an increased dependence on ramen noodles. This is the time
to break out of the closed world of campus and take a semester abroad or an
internship downtown. Friendships are cemented, love is discovered, and
broken hearts are healed, but there is often a more indelible turning point
between the upper— and lower-class lifestyle.

Turning 21.

Whether one drinks or not, 21 signifies the last hurdle in the race
toward adulthood, when all concerts are accessible and dance clubs can’t turn
you away. Nightlife is no longer limited to frat parties or dorm room pizza
feasts, because a whole new world is waiting. Twenty-one means bar hopping
in Shadyside, staying at Dave & Buster’s past 10:30 p.m., and making it behind
the cage at Laga, only to discover that the shows are better enjoyed on the
other side.

Twenty-one makes the “real world” look enticing and full of
opportunity. And all too often, it’s only after students eagerly flee the
confines of Oakland that they realize just how much they’ll miss it after all.

Whiskey Dicks Saloon

[pittsburgh nightlife]

 
  
  
  

Lish up my game of Grand Theft Auto III, I notice that the riots
ing along the streets of Liberty City are just as loud as the
disorder I hear outside my bedroom window.

On Friday night, McKee Place lights up like the Las Vegas
Strip. “it” ust be time for the prisoners to exercise because the police
have arrived, and the street is lined with confused students walking in
circles looking for the next party before it, too, gets broken up.

Just up the road, the red lights of Bootlegger’s Bar beckon
students. The bouncer scans IDs, attempting to psych out those
carrying fakes. The line at the ATM collides with that of the bathroom.
In a corner, four students are engaged in a game of darts. On top of
harmonious bar talk and Bob Marley’s “One Love” playing on the
jukebox for the third time that night, comes the sound of pool balls
smashing into each other.

The walk to Ritter’s Diner in North Oakland can seem far,
but not when the streets are filled with the interesting people that just
aren’t seen during the day. Ritter’s has the feel of a 19505 diner.

The stools are taken, so we find a seat at one of the booths and begin
to select songs from our individual jukebox. They play at a perfect
volume, so they don’t compete with the other 15 tables. The night
isn’t over, but my stomach wants breakfast. When the aroma of fresh
scrambled eggs, bacon, and home fries hits my nose, I agree.

Lost in a trance, the long walk home doesn’t even cross my mind.

An erbu lesson in Beijing, China

72

[study abroad]

s Twas sitting in my dorm room anxiously trying to study for my fast-
. yapproaching midterms, I stared off into the distance at the magnificent
llEiliffelTlower. Actually, to my sleep-deprived mind it was really the
Cathedral of Learning, and I was just daydreaming of France, where
I plan to study abroad.
It all began with a nontransatlantic trip. A short elevator ride
whisks you to the eighth floor of the William Pitt Union, to the Study
Abroad Office and Pitt’s personal gateway to the world.

The Study Abroad Office and resource center is filled with
information just waiting to be used by students in various
educational stages. In addition to helping these students, the
University Center for International Studies (UCIS) also assists
faculty in the areas of international studies and research, as well as
the study abroad programs.

There are five programs available for students who want to
learn and live in a foreign country: Pitt-developed programs, Pitt
exchange, Pitt-affiliated programs, other universities’ programs, and
direct enrollment in a foreign university. However, Pitt does more
than simply open the door to the world, it also brings the world to
campus. The University provides opportunities to earn certificates in
African, Asian, Global, Latin American, Russian and East European, and
West European Studies. With its own unique curriculum, each program
presents multiple opportunities for simultaneous travel and education.

ugh Semester at Sea, a ship can be called home
the world becomes a classroom. The confines of
Tingle-city, campus-oriented education melt away
pletely, replaced by the exploration of distant
ntries and the activeexchange of cultural ideas
and information.

The ship’s on-board amenities, such as a
fitness center, outdoor pool, and basketball and
volleyball courts, are reminiscent of a luxury cruise
liner, but there is still a semester’s worth of work to
be done. Daily classes provide additional insight for
offshore excursions, and 20 percent of course work
is completed off the boat.

This year, students will cruise the
Pacific Rim, gleaming knowledge from ports, such
as Japan, China, and Malaysia before heading to
South America for additional learning adventures.

Semester at Sea opens up a world not available to
most people, as evidenced in the ship’s periodic
docking in Havana, Cuba. Although the University
of Pittsburgh sponsors the program, students
from across the nation enroll, providing
additional opportunities for cultural exchange.
When the trip is over, its memories

remain indelible. The taste of authentic Japanese
sushi, the smell of a Brazilian rainforest, and the
cherubic faces of children in Cape T own’s most
impoverished slums give students a global
awareness that can last a lifetime.

[pitt remembers]

 
  
   

tember 11, 2002. Somber gray clouds darkened the chilly
1’ , allowing only a glimmer of sunlight to seep

The eerie but beautiful melody of the bagpipe

ed “Amazing Grace” as we gathered on the lawn of
eCathedral of Learning. At 8:46 a.m., silence washed over
the crowd, and we were again reminded of our purpose—
to remember, reflect, and renew. -

Hundreds of people placed miniature ﬂags in the
earth, each one marked with a victim’s name. Isolated tears
slipped down a few faces, but most wore the look of
bittersweet remembrance as they add their symbol to the
sea of red, white, and blue. By 10:29 a.m., we reached our
goal of symbolizing and commemorating the 3,041 lives lost
just one year ago that day.

We slowly realized that it was okay to speak, to
console each other with questions, “Where were you?” and
“Did you know someone?”

Some of us headed off to class, and some spent the
day in memorials. Others listened to the gospel choir or
walked through the Kimbo Gallery to view the unforgettable
media coverage of the past year. Whatever we chose to do
on that day, it was a day like no other.

As we walked away from the lawn, we left the flags
as symbols of what we lost. The wind whipped them into
perfect and stunning alignment. Suddenly, the clouds begin
to move away. In spite of our mourning, the day promised
to be beautiful.

Pitt vs. Penn State

   

 
 
  

ee years ago in Three Rivers Stadium. As much as everything
, the past few years—new players, new fans, new field——there is
still one Panther that remembers the Penn State game very well.

Rod Rutherford might be this year’s starting quarterback, but he is
most famous for his time as a wide receiver against Penn State. Rutherford
scored the only touchdown in the notorious rivals’ last meeting, an essential
contribution to Pitt’s victory. What fan could easily forget that?

Penn State isn’t on the schedule this year, but there are plenty of
opportunities to make new memories with new players. With the well-known
wide receiver core of R]. English and Bryant gone, younger receivers like
Roosevelt Bynes and Larry Fitzgerald have taken over. This core vows to be
just as good as the previous pair.

This season will be remembered for Pitt’s victory over Syracuse
with a crushing 48-24 score, finally defeating the one team that had haunted
Pitt for decades. And who will forget going to play Notre Dame on their turf
at the famed Notre Dame Stadium in South Bend, Indiana? This was this
same team that Pitt beat in their last game at Pitt Stadium. And it would be
impossible to erase from memory the mob scene that followed the final play
of the game? People charged the field to tear down Pitt Stadium and take
home as many memories as they could get their hands on.

Now Pitt has a real home. For the first time in three years, Pitt has
played its home games in the same stadium as the previous year. Four years
ago, Pitt was a terrible team that struggled just to win a game, but now, Pitt
is a bowl contender vying for the top 25 every week.

hat would a Pitt sports event be like without the band and
cheerleaders to entertain us at every game and help fans cheer
for the Panthers? Not many people realize how hard these people
practice and prepare for each game.

Without the band, Pitt football and basketball games
would be eerily quiet. The pregame and halftime entertainment
provides everyone with skillful formations to watch and familiar
tunes with which to sing along. When there is a touchdown,
everyone looks to the band to start the cheering with the Pitt
Fight Song. No Pitt basketball game would be complete without a
tuba player going onto the court to run around and engage the
baseline in a song and to culminate the spectacle by doing splits.

The cheerleaders bring additional spirit to the mix.
They entertain the crowd and inspire the team with their cheers.
The cheerleading squad also travels with Pitt teams to whip road
crowds into a cheering frenzy. And don’t forget to be nice to the
cheerleaders—they are the ones manning the free T-shirt fling
during basketball games.

It’s not always easy to be a mascot, and not just because
that suit has to get hot. During every game, our beloved Panther
also gets thrown around in the student section and has to boldly
go to battle with the other team’s mascot. The Panther is
definitely tough, but anytime the Panther needs a break, Bubble
Boy is always there to pop up and down and waddle his way
through the sidelines.

§llO§§7 school buses are for kids in grade school ... unless you are a student fan of Panther football.

 at Pitt, these buses are the essential ways of getting to the North Shore for games. After streaming
 of them, students often search for their friends with cars in the student parking lot——which seems
 away from Heinz Field~but free with a Pitt ID.

  The long walk back to the field at game time doesn’t feel that bad after a couple hours of
tailgating. Have a beer, throw the football, and then maybe have another beer before eating a hot dog
or hamburger. This is where the trash talking and cheering originates.

Finally, it’s game time, and the students fill up the closed end zone of Heinz Field awaiting the
kickoff. With fans wearing their brightest blue and gold, the 12th man goes full force when they see the
opposing offense stuck in their own red zone, and their antics are always amusing. Just last season, sitting
in the student section against Alabama-Birmingham, they threw actual tangerines on the field to celebrate
our spot in the Tangerine Bowl! Only the craziest fans are allowed in the 12th man, and man do the Pitt
fans know how to tailgate and go crazy!

. ,y points during my time here, I would be traveling through the Fort Pitt Tunnel when suddenly the city of

gh would be right in front of my eyes. It never ceased to be a breathtaking sight. Other times, sitting on my
eck on the North Side at night, I could see the upper floors of the Cathedral of Learning glowing all the way
from K  and and think to myself, “That’s where I go to school.”

if Yes, we went to the University of Pittsburgh, but it was not called the University of South Oakland for

good reason. Unlike traditional college campuses, with sprawling, manicured lawns and large shady trees that shelter
campus buildings and residence halls, Pitt’s campus existed beyond such confines. Classrooms extend into the North
Oakland area, and students independently choose to live in places such as Shadyside, Squirrel Hill, South Side, or
even Mount Washington.

Our football games were not held on campus but rather in the downtown district of the city, in that
massive structure called Heinz Field that we shared with Pittsburgh’s professional football team, the Steelers.
Astronomy lectures were complemented by visits to the Allegheny Observatory in the North Side’s Riverview Park.
Art classes were better understood after seeing the works in person, at places like The Andy Warhol Museum or
Mattress Factory. Science was experienced first hand at the Carnegie Science Center, and all of this learning took
place outside Oakland.

The city was our campus, in lieu of something more traditional and campus-like, and that was fine with us.
That was what lured many people to Pitt in the first place—the culture, the life, the diversity that a small-town
campus could not lend. Pittsburgh, and the University that was its namesake, was our campus—and we loved it.

he piercing sound of the whistle was so high pitched that a group of dogs
began to gather on the sidelines. and both sides retreated to their home
bases to regroup and refuel for the second half. The Pittsburgh women's
Soccer team had been victorious in the first battle, but the war was far from
over. Founders Field, :1 once lush strip of grass, was now covered with mine
holes, the remnants of which were scattered across the playing field and
covered the bodies of the soldiers at rest on the sidelines. They listened
attentively as General Roland Sturk continued to bark instructions.

The sun was at its apex and continuously drained energy. With no
cloud cover in sight, there was just no hiding from its rays. The girls wiped
the dirt and sweat from their sunburned faces. Each sip of water appeared to
physically rejuvenate the players, almost as if they were in a video game
gathering food pellets to restore their health.

Eager to get back on the field, freshman goalkeeper Jamie Pelusi
hopped and paced around on the sidelines. She did not want to lose the
momentum she was carrying with her from the first half, when the score was
1-0 and she lunged to her right, completely parallel to the ground, nipping
the ball out of bounds for a corner kick and preserving the lead.

The fans were equally restless. One man used the bleachers as his
bass drum, while another repeatedly whistled the first line of the American
Gladiators theme, seemingly because he didn’t know the rest of the song.
Halftime was clearly a necessity, but it had worn out its welcome. The players
gathered in a circle, roared to be sure their opponents would hear, did an
about face, and marched back onto the battlefield to begin the second half.

lue and gold radiated everywhere in the brand spanking new Petersen Events Center. The avid basketball fans

‘ "donned Pitt colors for their wait in line for season tickets, matching the shimmering costumes of the

exuberant dance team. A golden glare even emanated off of a trombone as its owner united with the other
band members to belt out the university’s fight song. Members of the Oakland Zoo, the fast-growing student
section, donned their trademark gold shirts and kept everyone on their feet cheering. It was Friday night, and
before outings to the Strip District or frat row could be made, hoards of Pitt students, alumni, and fans were
seated for the Petersen’s debut sporting event. Amid whistling and shouting, the Pitt men’s and women’s
basketball season tipped off again.

This season brings more excitement and anticipation than in previous years, since Pitt’s men’s
basketball team ascended to 10th place last year in the NCAA. Hope of having the winning wristband number
needed to cheer on Brandin Knight and the rest of the gang firsthand was on everyone’s mind.

As yet another Midnight Madness drew to a close, fans stumbled out of the illuminated events center
more excited than when they entered, especially those who took part in shooting contests and challenges to
win various prizes, such as official Panther gear. It was a start to another exhilarating season of college
basketball, and whether a starting center, student, or alumnus, everyone shared the same thought: Go Pitt!

he 2001-02 Panthers men’s basketball team bounced into the national

spotlight, echoing and surpassing past teams by producing the most
dominant team in the school’s history. Led by junior guard Brandin

 Knight and Coach Ben Howland, Pitt gave the fans a year to remember.

Last season also marked the beginning of the Oakland Zoo, the
team’s most vocal group of supporters. These fans gathered, and their
matching shirts created a sea of gold~reminding opponents that they
were in Panther territory. Fitzgerald Field House itself seemed to struggle
for balance, trying to remain upright as the cheers shook its walls.

When March rolled around, Pitt found itself in the heart of the
madness. The Oakland Zoo followed and showed the nation Panther
pride. Despite that success, many nonbelieyers remained, but the
Panthers proved that they were not a temporary exhibit. After beating
Syracuse in the semifinals of the Big East tournament, Pitt ran into
UConn, and Madison Square Garden prepared itself for a classic game.

It took two overtimes and a lot of hair pulling and nail biting to decide it.
Even though the Panthers lost, they entered the NCAA tournament
believing they could run with the nation’s elite.

Pittsburgh embraced the team, as they played the first two
games of the tournament in Mellon Arena, where they beat Central
Connecticut and California with their winning formula. But at their
Sweet Sixteen party, Cinderella, in the form of Kent State, stole the show.
Nevertheless, the college basketball world had a keen eye on Pittsburgh.
When the meal was over and the team got the check, they were rewarded
with a #10 national ranking. But the “0” was erased in the minds of many.

How would the sequel to such a successful season turn out?

Ask the 5,000 fans who showed up at the new Petersen Events Center in
October with hopes of getting a ticket to the Oakland Zoo.

M ng gold shirts, and second year

final Four?

The akland Zoo.

Two Pitt juniors, Zach Hale and Matt
Cohen, founded the Zoo, a student cheering section
for men’s basketball games, after they were
disappointed to find Pitt’s existing section rather
lacking in the pep department. I

The zoo gets the dirt on the visiting team
and shows up at least two hours before each game
to set up right behind the opposing teams bench
like panthers ready to pounce. Notre Dame forward
Ryan Humphrey was heckled with “Ashley, Ashley,”
from the gold-filled lower stands, since Ashley is his
middle name.

Cohen said when he saw Humphrey at the
Big East Tournament this year, Humphrey jokingly
said to him, “Not you guys again.”

At the start of last year’s season, the
originators of the zoo, the “Zookeepers,” put
together $3400 of their own money to create their
shirts and pass them out at games. Then, Joan and

Dave Rollins of Pittsburgh, die-hard Pitt alums and
fans, were heartened by the zoo’s enthusiasm and
donated $4,000 to the wild bunch. They even lent
the leaders of the zoo a car to drive to Kentucky
and gave them a place to stay in New York for the
Big East tournament. With Pitt’s men’s basketball
team ranked 10th this year, hopefully the Rollinses
and the Zookeepers will be making an appearance
at the final four.

Oakland Zoo shirts are passed out free to
club members and season ticket holders and are also
sold at The Pitt Stop.

“It makes our team feel great to have that
support from their fellow students. Plus it really
makes it hard on visiting teams,” said EJ. Borghetti,
Pitt’s assistant athletic director for media relations.

And with all 1,500 student ticket holders
wearing the gold shirts, anyopposing team will
crumble in the face of the zoo—and maybe with the
help of Brandin Knight and JP, too.

 ame to begin.
P The relaxed atmosphere did not last long.

The crowd was soon roaring on September 29, as the women’s
volleyball team took their 10th consecutive victory over Villanova. The day
before, the smiling, ponytailed women had won their first Big East match—
proving they were a deeply rooted team and not to be messed with.

The path to their 3-0 victory had the fans jumping out of their
seats. The two teams competed hard, slamming the ball back and forth over
the net in an effort to keep it from bouncing off the blue and gold paint on
the floor. The Panthers easily took control of the game from the start, with
sophomore Megan Miller leading the ladies to victory.

Pitt coaches, with stem yet proud looks on their faces, allowed
small smiles to slip through once both they and the confident girls realized
the game was theirs. The Panthers proved that any team could have strength,
but unity is the glue that keeps it all together. The women have this unity—~
a bond that no opposing team can ever break.
