 [ THE NINETEEN THIRTY-ONE OWL ]

FOREWORD

In building THE 1931 OVVL, three ele-
ments have molded and determined its struc-
ture: beauty, simplicity, and the presentation of
a true record of the year’s activity. From
cathedrals of the Dark Ages, we have taken our
art motif. As the Medieval cathedral epito-
mized in stone all the learning, all the science,
all the culture of the age, so we have sym-
bolically attempted, by borrowing parts of these
buildings, to gather this knowledge not as in a
book, but painted on the cathedral windows, on
the portals, on the capitols, and high upon the
buttresses and towers. This we believe our own
cathedral represents to a greater degree, for it
is a structure dedicated to Learning—bui1t upon
beauty. A g

VVith such an art theme, which has stood
the test of centuries, we feel that synthetic
adornment would be misplaced. Thus our book

[ Page Four 1

substitutes the classical margin for the tradi-
tional boarder. Other landmarks of the con-
ventional year book have given way to a sim-
plicity which is not new, but old.

THE 1931 OVVL is divided into four sec-
tions—Fal1, \/Vinter, Spring, Summer. The
seasons, subdivided into months. Such a plan
was followed for the purpose of entering each
event and each activity following its chronology
on the university calendar. Compromises were
made; they were expedient, and we do not
apologize.

All we ask is that this book preserves for
you, individually, that which represents your
happiest associations on the campus and that
ten, thirty, ﬁfty years from June 10, 1931, you
will blow the dust from the Owls cover and
again climb the steps—steps deceitful in winter,
bordered with forsythia in spring.

BOARD OF TRUSTEES

The Board is made up of three classes of
Trustees, each class being in ofﬁce for three
years. A new class is elected each year. The
Governor of Pennsylvania, the Mayor of the
City of Pittsburgh, and the Chancellor of the
University are members ex—ofﬁcio. All mem-
bers of the Board must be citizens of the Com-
monwealth of Pennsylvania. The Board of
Trustees is the ﬁnal authority in the manage-
ment of the affairs of the University. All
appointments of officers and members of the
faculty must be approved by the Board. The
Board acts upon the annual budget presented
by the Chancellor and makes provision for

securing the necessary funds. All building
projects are under the direction of the Board
of Trustees which controls all University
property.

There are four stated meetings of the
Board during the year. Between these meet-
ings the Executive Committee of the Board
acts upon routine matters. Other commit-
tees such as Finance, Audit, Honorary De-
grees, Athletics, etc. act upon matters per-
taining to these parts of the work of the
University, their recommendations being re-
ported’ to the Executive Committee or to the
Board.

Chancellor

Chancellor Bowman is at present a trustee
of the National Board of Medical Examiners
and consultant on hospitals for the United
States Treasury Department. and he has been
the Chancellor of the University of Pittsburgh

since 1921. He is a member of Sigma Chi,
national men's social fraternity; Omicron Delta
Kappa, national honorary fraternity; and the
Delta Mu Delta and Phi Delta Kappa fraterni-
ties.

Here are my best wishes, personally and officially, to you who have
put together this ﬁrst senior issue of The Owl. Your book will have
increasing value and meaning both to you and to the University.

[ ADMINISTRATION ]

I have been requested officially by THE OVVL to
send you a message.

As the senior Trustee of the University, and at one
time its Chancellor, proud of those whose diplomas I
signed in the past, many of whom have become great
men in various spheres, proud of those who are des-
tined to follow them in the pathway to greatness, I wish
to say that I hope THE OW’ L may continue to hoot as
it has times past. LONG LIFE TO THE OVVLl

The owl was the bird of Minerva; to the old
Greeks the symbol of wisdom. I have studied Owls
pretty closely. \Nhen I was a junior in college I dis-
sected a Horned Owl and I still have the drawings,
which I made of the eye an(l its musculature. But the
best thing that can be said about this species is that it
makes continuous war upon skunks. I hope the students
of the University will follow its example. Down with

The Senior Class of the University is to be con-
gratulated not only on the fact that they will soon have
completed the work required for graduation. but also
because they are entering upon their life work at this
time. The settlement of the problems which disturb
the world today requires the highest degree of intelli-
gence, breadth of vision, and a willingness to render
sacriﬁcial services. The world properly expects those
who have had the advantage of a liberal education to
aid in the solution of these problems. May it be the
good fortune of every member of this class to enjoy a
large measure of success in their future work and also
to receive that highest satisfaction which comes from
the knowledge that they have done their best.

Centuries ago Seneca wrote to his friend Lucilius,
“the reason we make mistakes (and are unhappy) is
because we all consider the parts of life, never life as a
whole.”

The great emphasis today upon the job, upon
economic success, as the goal of life is an illustration of
consideration of one of the parts of life, to the exclusion
of the whole. My wish for the Class of 1931 is that
each of you may see the whole of life, and provide for
it: that while providing for pay checks in dollars, you
may supply yourself quite as generously with pay
checks in recreation, in human relationships, in spiritual
growth. Only by this foresight can you hope to know
life as a whole and be truly happy.

To say a message of gi‘eetiI1_Q' or farewell in a scn—
tcnce or two is difficult. To those who are g1'a<lI1ati11g,
hon voyage! Your journey should he the richer for the
years you have spent here. You will think often of Pitt
and your associations here, for loyalty is one mark of a
man who is educated in character as well as in intellect,
and in those recollections you will find great satisfac-
tion.

VVOMEN’S SELF GOVERNMENT ASSOCIATION

Since its formation in 1920, W. S. G. A.
has come to include all women’s activities and
Organizations on campus. It is interested in
promoting the scholastic standing, the social en-

vironment, and the individual interests of girls.
Perhaps one Of the most outstanding enter-
prises is that of lending money to both men
and women students on the campus.

STUDENT COUNCIL

Originally the Student Senate, the group
now known as Student Council changed its
form, in 1924, to become the Men’s Self-
Government Association. Hardly had this or-
ganization had time to take root before a dis-
tinct need was felt for a stronger linkage be-
tween the Men's and the VVomen’s Self-Gov-
ernment Associations; and, in an effort to
achieve this union, the men’s organization was

changed to the Student’s Self-Government As-_

ovwv 'L Page Thirty-three ] vww

sociation, its present form. Student Council,
executive committee of the association. has by
practice become the active group of the Self-
Government Association. This year, men
students expressed dissatisfaction with Student
Council and made plans for a stronger Men’s
Self—Governing Association that will give to
the men students the advantages that W. S.
G. A. affords women students on the campus.

DENTAL STUDENT COUNCIL

The Dental Student Council was organ-
ized to promote the moral, the intellectual, and
social welfare of students in the school of
Dentistry. This body affords opportunity for
closer relationship between students and fac-
ulty and is a means of cultivating, to the fullest

extent, all activities in which dental students
may be interested. The Dental School, through
its Student Council, presented name-engraved
wallets to members of the football team at the
annual banquet.

INTERFRATERNITY COUNCIL

A logical outgrowth in the development
of fraternities was the Interfraternity Council.
From the time of the organization of the
present Council (1920), the Council has served
as a common meeting ground for all accepted
fraternities where their problems may be stated
and solved and where they can legislate for the
betterment of the individual and group or-
ganization.

The ﬁrst interfraternity organization was
formed in 1914 and steadily gained in im-
portance and prestige because of its intelligent
legislation. This organization was known as
the Interfraternity Conference and operated in
much the same manner as the present Council;
the war disrupted the work of this group, how-
ever, and caused a temporary cessation of its
activities. After the war, a new group was

[ Page Thirty-seven ]

organized and given the name of Interfraternity
Council. This organization guides the activi-
ties of Pitt fraternities at the present time.

The activities which Interfraternity Coun-
cil sponsors each year are varied, ranging from
those which promote scholarship to the activi-
ties of social life and athletics. The purpose of
the Council is not only the settlement of prob-
lems, but also, the promotion of good will and
good fellowship throughout the campus and
fraternity world.

Through the year, Council, by means of its
standing committees on Rushing, Social affairs,
and Athletics, solves the problems of rushing
and sponsors athletic events, the Interfraternity
Ball which is an outstanding social event of the
early year, and the Interfraternity Smoker.

DENTAL INTERFRATERNITY COUNCIL

Acting in a correlating capacity for the
four dental fraternities on the campus, Dental
Interfraternity Council holds monthly dinner
meetings, at which it takes up matters of inter-
fraternity concern. Psi Omega, Delta Sigma
Delta, Xi Psi Phi, and Alpha Omega, the four
fraternities comprising the Council member-
ship, are each entitled to two representatives to
the Council.

The Council regulates rushing of new
members. It is represented in the National

[ Page Tlzirtynine ]

Dental Interfraternity Council at its yearly
meetings. It sponsors an annual Interfrater-
nity Ball and an informal dance. The Council
also sponsors a Dental Interfraternity Basket-
ball League, giving a silver loving cup to the
winner. Psi Omega won the league contest
this year. It holds an annual Bridge Tourna-
ment which was won this year by Psi Omega.
Alpha Omega contributed a cup and the frater-
nity winning it three times retains it perma-
nently. This year the Council is inaugurating
a mushball league.

THE COLLEGE ASSOCIATION

The College Association was founded in
the fall of 1926 for the purpose of sponsoring
social contact between students in the College,
and to promote scholarship by using the surplus
funds for loaning purposes to worthy juniors
and Seniors. The Association sponsors four
dances each year, a formal and an informal

each semester. The season opened this year
with the informal “Ki~cl<—off" (lance on October
3.  Thanksgiving formal was held on Novem-
ber 26, 1930. The inaugural (lance of the
second semester took place at the Schenley
Hotel on February 27, and the Spring Formal
was held on April 10, (luring the same semester.

YOUNG WOMEN’S CHRISTIAN ASSOCIATION

“To realize full and creative life through
a growing knowledge of God, to have a part
in making this life possible for all people, and
to seek to understand Jesus and follow Him”
—such are the purposes that have inspired the
organization of the Young VVomen’s Christian
Association. Founded at Illinois State Normal
in 1873 under the name of the Young Ladies‘
Christian Association, the Association spread
to most of the colleges that enrolled women
students, changing its name, later, to that under
which it is known at present.

The University of Pittsburgh branch of the
Association initiated its activities this current

school year with a series of teas for freshman
women. carried out each time in a manner char-
acteristic of a foreign country. At Christmas
time, it held its annual party for the Soho Day
Nursery children. The Inquiry Club. com-
posed of the Y. M. and Y. VV. C. A."s, held
meetings throughout the year that sponsored
speakers on social problems. The Association
won first prize in the activities pageant held at
the Heinz House, last spring. Other organiza-
tions sponsored by the Association are the
Forum on Religion, Freshman VVhy Club,
\\’orld Friendship and Interracial Committees,
the Social Service Club, and the Art Club. Its
ofﬁcial organ is the “Association Spirit.”

WOMEN’S ATHLETIC ASSOCIATION

The VVomen’s Athletic Association, more
familiarly known as VV. A. A., was organized
in 1921. Its two—fold purpose of fostering
clean sportsmanship and promoting higher
physical efﬁciency among the women at Pitt
has been fulﬁlled to a very great degree by its
ambitious sport programs and enlistment of
student cooperation. From the meager athletic
schedule of 1921, VV. A. A. has expanded its
program to such an extent that it now offers a
well-organized schedule of sports for Pitt

[ Page Forty-three ]

women in archery, basketball, dancing, golf,
hockey, life—saving, tennis, quoit, swimming,
volleyball, and outing.

W. A. A. also has its social traditions
among which are the co-ed prom, sports break-
fasts, teas, cabaret, play day and buggy-ride.

The organization is recognized as one of
the major groups at the University and is an
active member of national Athletic Conference
of American College VV omen.

YOUNG MEN’S CHRISTIAN ASSOCIATION

The ﬁrst student Y. M. C. A. was founded
at the University of Virginia in 1854; and by
1877, so many Y. M. C. A. groups had been
established in colleges that a need was felt for
a movement to correlate the work of the vari-
ous college associations. Consequently, that
same year witnessed the founding of the Inter-
collegiate Student Young Men’s Christian
Association, which became a division of the
general Y. M. C. A. movement. Under the
leadership of Luther D. Wishard, the ﬁrst
Traveling Secretary, and Dr. John R. Mott.
the famous organizer and inspirer of the
student movement, the Y. M. C. A. was estab-
lished in practically all colleges of the United
States. In 1892, the VVorld Student Christian

I Page Forty«ﬁ1/e ]

Federation was organized to unite the similar
Christian movements that had been created in
the various foreign countries. Today, Student
Christian Associations of forty-four countries
are united through the Federation.

The Student Young Men's Christian As-
sociation is a voluntary organization of faculty
and students. It has no creedal membership
requirements and welcomes to its enterprises
all who are in sympathy with its aims. The
program and policy of the University of Pitts-
burgh “Y” association, similar to those of the
national organization, are vested in a Student
Cabinet and a Committee of Management. The
Student Cabinet is composed of the chairmen
of the various Y. IVI. C. A. clubs and projects.

YOUNG MEN AND W'OMEN’S HEBREVV ASSOCIATION

The purpose of the Y. M. H. A. and
Y. VV. H. A., which combined in 1926 when
their new building was erected, is to make pos-
sible, and promote, contacts among Jewish
students.

One of the divisions of the “Y” is its
Student Council, which was organized in 1926,
and which has charge of all activities sponsored
by the students of the various Universities.
The Council, hitherto elected by the student
members but now an appointive committee, is,

for the ﬁrst time in its history, represented by
alumni together with the undergraduates.

Throughout the year various activities are
sponsored, among which are athletic contests,
social and literary meetings, and addresses by
nationally prominent speakers. Also of interest
to students are the various study groups,
dramatic organizations, and concert series. The
many social affairs during the year also attract
a widespread interest, chief among which are
the Freshman V'\«'eek V\'elcome and the annual
Students Dance.

JOCK SUTHERLAND has just com-
pleted his eleventh season as a player
and coach for the University of Pitts-
burgh's football teams. During that
time, the Pitt teams were undefeated
ﬁve times.

Previous to his entrance here, Suther-
land had never played any football, but
he developed so quickly that he is con-
sidered one of the best guards to play
here, and he is now regarded as the out-
standing line coach in the country.

\Vl1en he started coaching, he followed
almost directly the V\"arner system of
play, but he has "mrliﬁed it somewhat
in the last few years.

[ FOOTBALL ]

VV. DON HARRISON has been the
director of athletics at the University
since the spring of 1928 when he suc-
ceeded Mr. Blakesley.

During his term of service, many
new schools of national repute have been
added to the Pitt schedules in both major
and minor sports. Ohio State, Notre
Dame, Army, and l\Iontana State are
only a few schools who have found
places on the Panther schedule within
the past few years.

Mr. Harrison has also endeavored to
increase the number of intercollegiate
sports on the Pitt program, and during
the past year. boxing and golf were
added to the list.

CHARLES D. VVETTACH, an alum-
nus of the University, has just con-
cluded his first year as chairman of the
Athletic Council, which consists of the
Chancellor, four members of the Ath-
letic Committee of the Board of Trus-
tees, a member of the faculty, and three
alumni.

He presides at all meetings, appoints
suh-committees which are not otherwise
provided for, and acts as an ex-officio
member of these committees.

The past athletic season was one of
the most successful in Pitt history, and
much of its success can he laid to the
untiring efforts of Mr. VVettach.

CAPTAIN EDDIE BAKER com-
pleted three years of competition for
the Pitt varsity football team last
season. He was a sub during his
sophomore year, but in 1929, he beat
out Charley Edwards," varsity quar-
terback for the! two years. previous,
for the regular post and he directed
the team throughout its undefeated
campaign.

Due to the fact that the Pitt style
of play does not call for frequent
carrying of the ball by the quarter-
back, Baker was not in the limelight,
but his great blocking and his un-
erring generalship earned him the
right to be classed as one of the out-
standing quarterbacks of the past
gridiron season.

Notre Dame 35--Pitt 19

FOOTBALL, 1930

PITT’S fair success was
c_haracteris'tic ofeven year grid-
iron seasons in .l'9,30‘by winning
six games, losing two, and tie-
ing one. Considering the fact
that the team had ‘lost ﬁve
players who had been men-
tioned on the various all—Amer-
ican teams the previous year,
the record was one of which to
be proud.

VVAYNESBURG helped Pitt
to open the season at the sta-
dium, and the game was little
more than a practice tilt for the
Panthers as the class B school
could not cope with either Pitt's
offense or its defense. The ﬁnal
score was 52-0.

WEST VIRGINIA. the next
team to be met by Pitt, gave
the Panthers a real battle; but
even though the Mountaineers
were reported as having the
best team to represent their
school in the past decade, they
were forced to accept the short
end of the 16-0.

Pitt continued its victorious
march against WESTERN RE-
SERVE i11 its ﬁnal set-up

EDDIE HIRSHBERG, a letter-
man for the past two years, will lead
the Panthers when they take the ﬁeld
for their opening game next fall
against Miami University.

Hirshberg was handicapped by in-
juries in his playing last fall; but if
he ca11 escape the same hoodoo next
season, he will be a serious candidate
for all-American honors.

' He was described by Bob Waddell,
coach of the Carnegie Tech team, as
the surest tackler to play in the
stadium last year. This ability com-
bined with that of being able to catch
forward passes from any position
stamps Hirshberg as one of the best
ends i11 Pitt history.

 

 

“RIP” COLLINS was the ﬁrst
Sioux City boy with football ambi-
tion to come to Pitt, and he liked the
school so well that he brought down
several of his home town boys to
play with him for the Panthers.

Injuries handicapped him last year,
and he failed to live up to the po-
tentialities he displayed as a fresh-
man and as a sophomore. Without
this handicap, he should enjoy his
best year next season.

Aside from his football ability,
“Rip” is one of the best hog callers
in the country. He holds many
medals for his proﬁciency in this art.

game of the season, the score
being 52-0. Captain Eddie
Baker scored his first touch-
down in intercollegiate compe-
tition in this game.

The next game on the Pitt
schedule with SYRACUSE
was a battle between the teams
possessing the strongest lines in
the East. It was apparent early
in the game that neither team
would be able to gain steadily
through its opponent’s line, and
the game developed into a punt-
ing duel between Captain Eddie
Baker of Pitt and Stevens,
triple threat Syracuse back.
Syracuse had seven opportuni-
ties for scoring, but each time
the Pitt defense tightened up
when its goal line was threat-
ened; and Syracuse did not
score on the Panthers. Pitt, on
the other hand, was in scoring
distance but twice throughout
the game, but they made the
best of these opportunities to
score two touchdowns and to
convert the two tries for extra
points.

NOTRE DAME played the
ﬁrst game of its three game

Pitt fans will long remember
CHARLES TULLY for the manner
in which he broke through the Car-
negie Tech line this season to block
Dreshar’s try for a point after touch-
down and to insure Pitt 3. 7-6 victory
over the Tartans and the city cham-
pionship.

Tully completed three seasons as a
varsity tackle last fall, and although
he was erratic at times, he ended his
career as a Panther gridder in a blaze
of glory. As the 1930 season drew to
a close, he was considered the most
dependable man in the Panther line,
and he was favorably mentioned on
many all-star selections.

A halfback in high and prep school,
RALPH DAUGHERTY was shifted
to center when he joined the Panther
ranks. Although the position was new
to him, he has performed capably at
that post for the past two years and is
considered a worthy addition to the
great line of centers developed at Pitt
which includes Peck, Stein, Johnson,
and Cutler.

Daugherty was given honorable
mention 011 several teams during his
sophomore year. VVith such a back-
ground Pitt expects much from him
in 1931.

series with Pitt the following
Saturday in what was desig-
nated as “Homecoming Day.”
Previous to the game, both
teams had been undefeated; and
the crowd of over 74,000, the
largest ever to appear in the
Pitt stadium, was on hand for
the game. Rockne’s team
showed Pitt fans a few new
tricks and had little difﬁculty in
winning, 35-19. The score, how-
ever, does not tell the true story
of the game, as Notre Dame
never lost possession of the ball
once it had gained it during the
period when its regulars were
in the game. Pitt did not score
until the ﬁnal five minutes of
play when the Irish reserves
were in the game.

Another capacity crowd saw
Pitt in its tilt the following
week with NEBRASKA at the
Cornhuskers’ stadium. Pitt was
the favorite to win this game,
but the home team surprised
Pitt in the same manner that
Pitt had surprised it two years
previously with the result that
the game ended scoreless.

Pitt won its annual tilt with
CARNEGIE TECH for the

Although he weighs but 168 pounds,
which is very light for a lineman,
MIKE MILLIGAN, who wears a
policeman’s uniform in Alliquippa
during the summer months, won a
regular position on the Pitt team last
year as a guard, and he lived up to the
high standard set by his predecessors.

Milligan was a sub when the season
started, but injuries to Hart Morris
gave him his chance; and when Morris
return, he was forced to watch the
greater part of the games from the
bench. He is expected to be a regular
when the season opens this fall.

A sub during his ﬁrst two years on
the varsity, ERNIE LEWIS came
through in his ﬁnal season to win a
regular berth. Short, chunky, and
alert, he was the ideal type of guard
for the Sutherland system of play, al-
though his position on his high school
team had been that of fullback.

Lewis was the bulkwark of the cen-
ter of the Pitt line which was prac-
tically impregnable and opposing
teams were forced to look elsewhere
to ﬁnd holes. He was named by the
late Knute Rockne as one of the best
guards to oppose his team during the
year.

city collegiate football cham-

winning the game for three suc-
cessive years earned possession
of the championship cup. Car-
negie was the pre—ga1ne favorite
to win and it outplayed Pitt
throughout the greater part of

their engagement, but the
Panthers outfought and out-

thought their opponents to win,
7-6. Pitt made its lone touch-
down in the second quarter
when it marked 60 yards down
the ﬁeld to score a touchdown,
Hood plunging over for the

score. Baker kicked the extra
point which insured the vic-
tory.

The strain of playing ﬁve
major games in succession and
the forward passing of Wesley
Fesler proved too much for the
Panthers in their game with
OHIO STATE, and the Buck-
eyes evened up their two game
series with the Panthers with a
16-7 victory. After scoring ten
points in the ﬁrst half by virtue
of a touchdown, a successful try
for extra point. and a field goal,
Ohio State added to its lead in
the early part of the third quar-
ter by scoring another touch-

JESS QUATSE, haled as the
strongest man on the Pitt football
team, justiﬁes this sub—title when he
puts his great strength to use in his
unusual aggressiveness on the ﬁeld.

Quatse has not been an outstanding
member of the team during his two
years on the squad. It is even pos-
sible that he may have to ﬁght hard in
order to retain his regular berth next
season. But his defensive play has
been of a high order at times, espe-
cially in the Syracuse game last year
when he was forced to play along side
of Ted Daily who at that time was
badly in need of experience.

Only the presence of Ralph Daugh-
erty, one of the best centers in the
cou11try during the past two years,
prevented JOE TORMEY, sophomore
sensation, from winning a regular
berth last year.

He received his big chance in the
Notre Dame game last year when
Daugherty was forced out near the
close of the ﬁrst half due to a knee
injury; and he conducted himself so
well that many Notre Dame players
considered him to be the best center
to play against them that year up to
that time. Sutherland expects to use

him more often next season than he
did ill the one past.

down. Pitt came back and
made its only score of the game
when Paul Reider made a 57
yard gain around Fesler’s end
to place the ball on the Ohio
six yard line from which place
Hood plunged it over.

Pitt closed its season with its
annual Thanksgiving game with
PENN STATE; and although
Pitt greatly outclassed its oppo-
nents, it was only able to win by
a 19-12 score. Warren Heller
scored two of Pitt’s three touch-
downs on runs of 35 and 80
yards. Baker scored the other
on a short pass from Josh Wil-
liams. Lasich scored one of
State's touchdowns on a short
plunge in the third quarter
while a blocked punt in the ﬁnal
moments of play was picked up
by a State man who ran 26
yards for his team’s ﬁnal six
points.

[ Page Fifty-three ]

 

WARREN HELLER accomplished
a feat last year which seems to have
become a habit among Pitt athletic

stars. He was only a substitute on
his freshman team, but he beat out
Mel Brown and VVhitey VValinchus,
a two year letterman, for the regular
left halfback berth as a sophomore.

Heller was handicapped last year
by an erratic line and a hip injury,
but he displayed some real form at
intervals. Playing with a stronger

team next year than that with which
he played this year, he should develop
into a powerful scoring threat for the
Panthers.

 

 

DR. ROSCOE “SKIP” GOUG—
LER has been coach of the Pitt fresh-
man football teams since 1928. He is
a graduate of the University, playing
here in 1915, 1916, and 1917.

He served as assistant to Jock Suth-

erland for three years when the latter

was coach of the Lafayette college
team. He dropped out of the coaching
game in 1921 but the lure of the grid-
iron was so strong that he ﬁnally
returned to his alma mater. He pre-
fers to instruct freshman candidates
rather than varsity men. He also
teaches in the Dental school.

[FRESHMAN FOOTBALL

Pitt's varsity football team
next year will depend upon
many of this year’s freshman
crop in order to carry it through
a successful season. The record
compiled by this year’s frosh
group was not an enviable one,
the team winning but three of
its ﬁve games; but some of the
players displayed great poten-
tialities and will be of aid to
Jock Sutherland in years to
come.

The team defeated George
VVashington Freshman at VVash—
ington, D. C., in its opener
which was a night game, the
ﬁrst one in which a Pitt team
performed. Carnegie Tech plebes
held the Panther yearlings to a
scoreless tie although the Pitt
men wasted two ﬁne opporuni-
ties to score. Pitt was some-
what lucky to win its game
with the West Virginia fresh-
men at Morgantown as only a
blocked try for point enabled
them to win. 7-6. Kiski sur-
prised Gougler’s team to win,
9-6; but the ﬁnal game found
Pitt winning over the Penn
State freshmen, 12-0.

Brooksborough’s second contribu-
tion to Pitt football promises to de-

velop into one of the greatest ends.

in Pitt history. Eddie Baker, the ﬁrst
native son to come to Pitt, has already
ﬁrmly estal)lished himself; and JOE

‘ SKLADANY who hails from the

same place and who captained the
freshman football team from his end
position last season gives every evi-
dence of developing into the same star
as his fellow townsman.

Joe was considered one of the surest
tacklers on the team, and he will give
Rip Collins a ﬁght for the end berth
opposite Eddie Hirshberg.

In the freshman games last fall, Joe
was always the outstanding lineman
on the ﬁeld. He beat the other line-
men down under the punts and almost
always made the tackle.

In addition, he is a better than
average pass receiver, rivaling cap-
tain—elect Eddie Hirshberg in this
respect. Very seldom has he dropped
a pass either in the open or when
covered by an opponent.

Short and chunky, Joe does not have
the ideal build for an end; but his
unusual aggressiveness enables him to
overcome this handicap.

ERIE JUNIOR COLLEGE

In the fall of 1927 the University of Pittsburgh
assigned the first residence staff to Erie. Five in-
structors presented a program of academic work in
afternoon and evening classes throughout that year.
The University came to Erie at that time because of
the active encouragement given by the Education
Committee of the Chamber of Commerce. The city
of Erie showed its interest and appreciation of this
work by the gratifying number of students that en-
rolled during the year. Encouraged by this popular
response and still further supported by representative

committees of the Chamber of Commerce and Board
of Education, an expanded curriculum, including day college
classes, was administered by the staff of twelve instructors

that was added. Thus in September, 1928, the Charter Class
of ﬁfty-nine freshmen brought into existence the Erie Junior
College of the University of Pittsburgh. Forty of the Charter
Class returned as Sophomores, while the freshmen group con-
sisted of one hundred and thirty-four students, making the
enrollment one hundred and ninety-four for the second year.
This year the Erie Junior College includes two hundred and
sixty~three men and women receiving instruction from the
resident staff of twenty-two officers and instructors. Parallel-
ing this growth in the Junior College division each year has
seen an increasing number carrying on part time work in
the Evening School with the gratifying total of almost seven
hundred students. Notwithstanding the youth of the Center
the development of spirit and ideals is keeping pace with
expanding numbers and equipment. Erie has taken the Uni-
versity as its own and shares with the University the bright-
est of hopes for the future.

STUDENT COUNCIL

The students’ Self-Governing Association
is composed of all undergraduate students who
are carrying at least twelve hours of work in
the Erie Junior College. Its object is the estab-
lishment, stabilization, and application of de-
mocracy among the students. This student
organization governs itself by the representa-
tive method through a council, which is called
the Student Council. This Council is composed
of four men, three women, and three faculty
advisers.

The Council is divided into the following
standing committees: Student Relations, Con-
stitution, Assemblies, Investigation, Elections,
and Point Scale. The Student Relations Com-
mittee approves the constitution of all organi-
zations, draws up and enforces regulations for
the supervision of all social events, and takes

charge of all social affairs given in the name of
the Student Council. The duties of the As-
semblies, Constitution, and Election Committees
are indicated by their titles. The obligations
of the Investigation Committee and Point
Scale Committee are less clearly defined. The
ﬁrst investigates general campus conditions,
such as study facilities, smoking rooms, ar-
rangement of lockers, trafﬁc problems, or
matters which might be referred to it for in-
vestigation by the Student Council. The Point
Scale Committee interprets the rules of the
point scale system, and records and catalogues
the activities of each student according to the
accepted point scale system. This committee
attempts to keep students from being burdened
by extra-curricular activities, and to maintain a
fair method of awarding activity pins.

JOHNSTOWN JUNIOR COLLEGE

In the summer of 1927 the University of
Pittsburgh, the Johnstown School Board, and
the parents of one hundred and forty-one
young people of Johnstown and vicinity, as
well as these young people themselves, pre-
pared to take part in a very interesting experi-
ment. The new institution resulting from the
cooperation of these groups was to be the
Johnstown junior College of the University of
Pittsburgh, the ﬁrst of its kind. \Vhen the
students gathered in quarters that had been
carefully prepared for their occupancy in the
Central High School Building of Johnstown,
it was evident that the new institution was
really a college and not an extension of the
High School, although the closest cooperation
with the High School has continued from that

day. In this unique set up, the staff and super-

[ Page "One Hundred Four J

vision were furnished by the University of
Pittsburgh; the class rooms, supplies and phy-
sical equipment by the Johnstown School Dis-
trict. This arrangement has proved very satis-
factory to both parent institutions. The enroll-
ment of college students has increased from
year to year until two hundred and seventy
were enrolled in the two semesters of the pres-
ent session. Almost two hundred students
have already used the work at Johnstown as
a stepping stone to enrollment in forty-four
other schools, including seven undergraduate
and professional schools of the University of
Pittsburgh. Several have already graduated
from colleges and normal schools, and more
than ﬁfty are scheduled to graduate in June

1931.

STUDENT COUNCIL

_ Student Council at Johnstown is concerned
primarily with the eXtra—curricular activities of
approximately two hundred and ﬁfty students.
The growth and scope of the body has par-
alleled that of the College itself.

mental attitude, has dscovered those activi-
ties which really appeal to the student body.
By now, dramatics, basketball, track, the
Glee Club, the Panther Club, and the Pit-
kin Club have won a place for them-
selves.

Let us be silent, let us walk through places
Patterned with leaves, and reverent and dim,

The air around us peopled with lost faces,
The wind above us an autumnal hymn.

Let us be still. Since all is hushed and clear,
The stones, the dead, the very sky may hear.

THE 1931 OVVL

In the spring of 1906 the Junior Class brought out
the first year-book of the University of Pittsburgh-
the 1907 Owl. The development of the Owl may
be traced from that small but accurate ﬁrst edition,
through the long “cook-book” size, to the present
“telephone-book" size. The trend in the themes has
developed from none at all to one devoted to Indus-
trial Pittsburgh, one to Beauty, and this year’s double
motive of a Medieval Book—a University and a
Cathedral.

But more interesting than all these developments
should be an understanding of how this year’s book
has been prepared. One wonders if preceding Owl
oﬁices were crowded and noisy, if typewriters and
telephones were used all day, if conferences and meet-
ings gave the office an air of worldly importance?

Most important of all one wonders if there was a

staff organization? Were there department heads,"

assistants and apprentices? Did they meet and plan
the book, did they attack the work with enthusiasm
and interest? One wonders if they realized they were
publishing a book which is, in the ﬁnal analysis, not
a journalism project, but rather a project in building
and construction, a project in administration and de-
velopment?

All these questions have been brought up in the
construction of this year’s book. The staff has at-
tempted to follow a logical organization chart and
throughout has held a two-fold purpose: to publish a
book which will be a history of one year at the Uni-
versity, and to produce this book through a well ad-
ministered, well organized staﬂ’.

THE PITT VVEEKLY

When activities were still groping about to
ﬁnd their place in life at the University a
monthly magazine, The Courant, made its ap-
pearance. A few years later Frank C. Stewart
conceived the idea that a weekly newspaper
should supplant this monthly publication. The
Pitt V\/eekly was organized. In the ﬁrst days
of its existence the staff secured regular exer-
cise in trying to locate a room in which to
pursue its journalistic proclivities. An early
edition of the Owl adds, “The cubs’ might
have been seen spilling ink on the roof of
Thaw Hall or in the cellar of State, but those
good old days passed and the staff entered
commodious quarters in Thaw Hall.”
Later the Pitt VVeekl_v was issued from
headquarters at Frick Acres and recently the

ﬁre of industry and accomplishment in the Ac-
tivities Hut has been fanned by the installation
of the VVeekly ofﬁce in that building. The
newspaper is distributed every Friday morning
for the purpose of furnishing students with
information about curriculum, activities, an(l
social life on the campus. The weekly is sup-
ported by an appropriation by the University
and by the advertisements it contains. In
November of 1930 the Pitt VVeekly, together
with Sigma Delta Chi, acted as host at the
Pittsburgh convention of the National College
Press Association, of which the VVeekly is a
member. At the convention VVilliam S.
Maulsby, faculty adviser of the Pitt Weekly,
was elected national Executive Secretary of the
Association.

THE PITT PANTHER

Offspring of distorted minds, and sly
smirks, the Pitt Panther was ﬁled with the
Birth Recorder way back in A. D. 1914. A
slim little baby, nursed and petted by Sidney
S. Hoehl and boys, the Kitty was ﬁnally taught
the house propriety that should be taught to all
felines, and was housed in its own kennel in
Alumni Hall.

The Panther dashed from his household
each month, adorning himself in such guises as
Santa Claus, Football Man, Fashion Plate, and
College Graduate. V\7ith his rough, red tongue
in his cheek, he winked a hairy eyelid, and
chuckled at the entities he mimicked. A few
times, after feeding on raw meat, he became
annoyingly vicious—then_ he was coaxed to
facetious submission. In 1924 during Laur-
ence E. Irwin’s career as "Ringmaster,” the
insane Kitty was isolated at Frick Acres.

[ Page One Hundred Fortguﬁve ]

Alumni hall had become academic!

This year’s Zoologists have extracted some
of the Kitty’s bad molars, have groomed him
daily, and now he appears in public as a pre-
sentable and likeable animal.

Prominent Pittsburgh newspapermen this
year have readily preened the Kitty’s fur,
among these being William Pfarr, Cyrus
Hungerford, Florence Fisher Parry, and
Ralph Reichold. M. T. Herrick of Pitt’s Eng-
lish department has capably guided the Kitty’s
theatrical wanderings throughout the season.

At the end of the season, the Panther sits
on his haunches, contented, and happy, licking
his chops. More Pitt students have interested
themselves with the Panther’s revels this year
than ever before. For their brave services
they (i.e., the tattooers and keepers) are re-
warcled with a Pi Beta key.

[DEBATING ASSOCIATIONS}

WOMEN’S DEBATING ASSOCIATION

For the purpose of affording women stu-
dents an opportunity to engage in debate and
to enter into intelligent discussion of current
problems, the VVomen‘s Debating Association
of the University was founded in its present
form in 1921. The Association is composed
of the debating squad and other women stu-
dents interested in debating. It meets once
every two weeks, when debates or talks are

given.

The debating squad. try-outs for which are
held each season, carries an extension and an
intercollegiate schedule. Extension debates

make up the majority of the squad’s work.

I Page One Hundred Forty-seven ]

They are not competitive and are presented be-
fore local civic and club organizations.

The Intercollegiate program includes an east-
ern and a western trip. This year’s was one
of the most extensive programs of any college
debating team in the country. Early in Feb-
ruary the team took a short western trip in
which it met VVittenburg College and Ohio
VVesleyan. The eastern trip, made early in
l\Iarch, included meets with Cornell, New
York, and Pennsylvania State Universities, and
with Swarthmore and Bucknell Colleges. The
travelling team was comprised of Gladys Pyle,
Col. "33. Louise Linn, Col. ’32, and Marie
Hochmuth. Ed. ’3l.

[DEBATING ASSOCIATIONS]

lVlEN’S DEBATING ASSOCIATION

The men’s debating activities consist of an
extension debate program and an intercol-
legiate schedule. This year the Association
sponsored three major debating trips and one
or two minor ones. By the end of the season,
upwards of a dozen extension debates will have
been held. These debates are presented be-
fore high schools, luncheon clubs, and various
other groups.

The western trip, made during the early
part of February, took two men, Samuel
Strauss and Cyril Jacobs, accompanied by
Coach Richard Murphy, on an extensive tour
of the middle west. They touched as far north
as Fargo, North Dakota, as far west as Omaha,
Nebraska, and as far south as Louisville, Ken-
tucky. In sixteen days they met fourteen
schools and engaged in ﬁfteen debates. Their
itinerary included the state universities of Iowa,

Indiana, South Dakota, Marquette, Creighton,

[ Page One Hundred Forty-nine ]

and Notre Dame. All were non-decision de-
bates.

There was a short week—end trip in early
March to meet Georgetown University at
Washington, D. C., and VVilliam and Mary at
VVilliams, Virginia. There were other short
trips to Pennsylvania State Teachers College
at California, and to Mount Union College at
Alliance, Ohio. The eastern trip came early in
April and included seven colleges, taking the
team as far east as Boston.

The home schedule included debates with
Boston and Rutgers Universities, Carleton and
Bowdoin Colleges, and Western Reserve.
VVestern Reserve was met in what was prob-
ably the most extensive one—day debating pro-
gram the Association has ever attempted, the
same teams debating before four different audi-

ences successively.

Credit for the remarkable show-
ing of the Pitt basketball team dur-
ing the early part of the season
when it played without the serv-
ices of four of its regulars of the
previous year belongs to WILLIE
ARTURE, co—captain of this year’s
team.

Playing for the most part with
men who had had little previous
varsity experience, Arture guided
the team through the ﬁrst half of
its difﬁcult schedule during which
time it defeated such teams as
Dartmouth, Syracuse, Nebraska,
Purdue, and New York U.

Although he has been coaching
the University of Pittsburgh's bas-
ketball teams ever since his under-
graduate days DOC CARLSON
never received the credit and praise
due him until his team of 1927-
l928 went through its entire sched-
ule without suffering a setback.

Ever since that time his teams
have always stood out as one of
the best in the country. Carlson
conclusively proved to the fans that
his success was not solely due to
the efforts of any one of the play-
ers when he guided a comparatively
green team to twenty victories.

The departure of EDDIE
BAKER from the list of eligibles,
robs Pitt of the best combination
football and basketball player it
has boasted of within the past dec-
ade. Eddie not only captained the
football team, but he was also co-
captain of the basketball team.

During his sophomore year, he
ran Hyatt a close second for scor-
ing honors among the Pitt players
but injuries and loss of time caused
by two trips to the Paciﬁc coast
with football teams hurt his
chances of bettering the mark he
made as a sophomore.

l Page Om: Hzmrlred Fifty-two 

DON SMITH was the only mem-
ber of last year’s undefeated fresh-
man team to try out for a varsity po-
sition. His ﬁne showing fully com-
pensated the lack of interest and in-
disposition on the part of his ﬁrst
year teammates, for he won a regular
berth as a guard at the start of the
season. His play was of such quality
at all times that he retained his post
even after Baker returned from the
coast.

Smith ranked fourth among the Pitt
scorers during the past year, scoring
twenty-six ﬁeld goals and a like num-
ber of fouls.

 

BASKETBALL

Although the Pitt basketball
team did not live up to its motto
and that of its coach, Doctor
Carlson, the past season was a
most successful one with the
Panthers winning twenty games
and losing four. The Panthers
developed rapidly following
their setback in the season’s in-
augural game with Western Re-
serve and triumphed over some
of the leading teams in the East
and in the Mid—VVest. Aside
from the defeat administered by
Western Reserve: Creighton,
Indiana, and City College of
New York were the only other
teams to beat Pitt.

The annual western trip
which followed the opening
game found Pitt meeting but
one team from the “Big Ten"
—Ohio State which fell before
Pitt to the score of 25-17. Pitt
beat Marquette, new on the
schedule, 22-18. Nebraska held
Pitt to a 23-22 score, but
Creighton, also a ﬁrst timer,

(Continued on page 154)

[ Page One Ilmulrcd Fz'fty-tlzrcc

A revival of an old injury to his
elbow in the Creighton game caused
WILLIE KOVVALLIS to miss three
of the most important tilts on the
Pitt schedule, but this fact did not
keep him from tieing Tim Lawry for
the honor of scoring the most ﬁeld
goals during the season.

Despite the fact that he played hard
at all times, he earned the reputation
of being one of the cleanest players
in the game, for during the entire
season but fourteen personal fouls
were called against him, an average
of less than one foul per game.

 

 

Although he was not considered a
regular at any time during his ﬁrst
two years of varsity competition,
MILT COHEN was a valuable
member of the team and a star in
his ﬁnal year.

During the past season, Cohen
served to wear down an opposing
guard after which coach Carlson would
send in the high scoring Tim Lawry to
complete the damage. Cohen was also
shifted around much of the time, but
his work did not suffer on that ac-
count, and never did he fail to play
a smart and pleasing game for the
Panthers. His great knowledge of the
Carlson system made him not an
illuminous but great cog in the fa-
mous Pitt machine. He worked hard
and never got the credit due him.

 

[BASKETBALL ]

(Continued from page 153)

marred a perfect record on the
trip for the Panthers by defeat-
ing them, 22-18.

Returning home, Pitt met
Dartmouth, Syracuse, Purdue
and Indiana during the Christ-
mas holidays. Dartmouth de-
feated Syracuse before coming
to Pittsburgh, but Pitt pulled a
surprise to score one of its
easiest victories of the season,
39-25. Syracuse found the same
fate, but with a closer score,
31-28. Purdue bothered Pitt
with its zone defense, but Pitt
ﬁnally won, 24-22. Indiana,
however, caught Pitt on an off-
night and went home with a
25-17 victory.

Following that defeat, Pitt
entered upon another winning
streak i11 which it won eight
straight games. New York U.,
Fordham, West Virginia, Car-
negie Tech, \Nash—]ePf, Army,
and Notre Dame were Pitt vic-
tims; the last named team fell
twice before the
extra period tilts.

Pitt had a 16-4 lead over City
College of New York at the
end of the ﬁrst half of its game
but lost form in the second half

Panthers in

 

From the position of sub on his
freshman team, TIM LAWRY rose
to great heights to gain a regular
berth on the varsity team in his junior
year. During his sophomore year,
whenever the team went on a trip and
one of the players had to be left be-
hind, Tim was invariably the unlucky
one. His playing during the past sea-
son not only enabled him to gain a
regular berth but also helped him to
become the high scorer of the Pitt
team with 149 points to his credit at
the close of the season. He should be
even better next year.

 

BUS ALBRIGHT did not set the
world on ﬁre as a basketball player
either as Hyatt’s teammate at Union-
town high and later at the Uniontown
center; but after coming to Pitt, he
developed rapidly and will, no doubt,
prove of great aid to the Panthers in
his remaining two years of varsity
competition.

A1bright's long reach was mainly
responsible for Pitt’s success early in
the year, as he was the lone Pitt
player tall enough to retrieve a ball
after it had hit the banking board.

to enable the New Yorkers to
win, 18-16. This was Pitt’s
lone defeat at the hands of an
Eastern school.

The ﬁnal six games of the
season were won by the Pa11—
thers. Penn State was trounced
at the stadium. Carnegie Tech
was defeated for the second
time, 27-25. Wash-Jeff suffered
another loss to the Panthers.
Penn surprised Pitt by holding
it to a 31-30 score. West Vir-
ginia’s zone defense failed to
hold Pitt at Morgantown, and
Penn State was defeated again
in the ﬁnal, 37-32.

AL WROBLESKI has not quite
lived up to the reputation set by his
brother “Stash” who played on the
undefeated team of 1927-1928; never-
theless, his speed and his ability to
handle the ball have enabled him to
see much action during the two years
in which he has been a member of
the Pitt varsity squad.

Had Al decided to enter another
school following his graduation from
high school he might now be a regu-
lar; but as conditions are at present,
he must be content to watch the Pan-
thers play against teams on which he
could play varsity. Time may decide
and Al may yet blossom into another
Stash.

GEORGE KOWALLIS has en-
joyed unusual success as coach of the
Pitt freshman basketball teams for the
past four years despite the fact that
the personnel of his team was changed
every season.

Kowallis was not a regular on his
freshman team, but he was one dur-
ing his three years of varsity compe-
tition. He coached the team while a
student in the Medical school. Two
of his brothers, Steve and Willie, are
now playing on the Pitt varsity team.
Coach Carlson says: “One of the
ﬁnest boys—as a player and. a coach-—
that I have ever met.”

FRESHMAN BASKETBALL

FRESHMAN

The team won its ﬁrst three
games but met a tartar in Scott
high of North Braddock which
broke the freshman winning
streak after it had reached ﬁfty
games. The team then won
three more before it succumbed
to the Carnegie Tech plebes, a
defeat which was later avenged.

The next winning streak ex-
tended to ﬁve games with Johns-
town, Uniontown, Wash—]eff
frosh, and Kiski, twice victims.
The Penn State freshmen won
over the Pitt yearlings, 24-23.
The young Panthers. beat the
Tech plebes and evened up their
series. Wash-Jeff freshmen fell
before the Pitt freshmen for the

Coming to Pitt with but one year
of high school experience, RUSS
OCHSENHIRT developed rapidly
to be the outstanding man on the
freshman basketball team of the past
season.

Playing at center, he invariably con-
trolled the tip-off and usually started
the plays which developed into Pitt
scores. His bullet-like passes and his
accuracy from anywhere around the
foul line made him one of the most
outstanding first year men. Ochsen-
hirt may be shifted to a guard berth
next year to take the place of Willie
Arture, who graduates this spring.

Delightful formality coupled with sophis-

Prom from less important functions of the
social year. Gowns—just a bit more formal—
stiff shirt fr0nts-more gleaming waltzed

Betty Mans

A ﬁrst—formal-of-the-year air pervaded the
Sophomore Hop—holiday cheer made the
Yuletide Festival a blithe affair-sophistication
was the keynote of the Interfraternity Ball——
But the FRESHMAN DANCE transformed
the evening of February 6 into a youthful frolic
and the Georgian Ballroom of the VVebster

Alexander MacLachlan

Hall Hotel into a collegiate rendez-vous——
Chairman Alex MacLachlan beamed all eve-
ning while keeping step to the Red Peppers, for
this was the first freshman dance in the history
of the University of Pittsburgh—a gala affair
and just one more step in the emancipation of
the formerly rule—bound freshmen.

How strange it is to think what little time
Lies between us and Chartres after all,

To know that there the willow trees wore
rime,

That there the snow clung silent to the
wall,

And modern hearts and Old World hearts
take ﬁre

Alike, in looking up at one white spire.

WOMEN’S GLEE CLUB

The \\“'omen"s Glee Club was founded at
the University in 1916. Later it was dissolved
but reorganized in 1922. Mrs. Robert Ayars
who was appointed directress in the fall of
1930 is largely responsible for the success of
this years work. The club adopted a new type
of dress for formal concerts, where the girls
appeared in Grecian garments of pastel shades
trimmed in gold braid.

This year the Glee Club met twice a week
in Heinz House to rehearse a program of clas-
sical music which included such numbers as
Grieg’s S017/ejg Song and “Lullaby” from
Jaclyn. In accordance with the purpose of the
club, which is to create an interest in music
and to give girls an opportunity to sing in an
organized group, an extensive concert program

[ Page One Hundred Nim-ty-nine l

was carried out. Informal concerts were given
at the United States Veterans’ Hospital in
Aspinwall, the Mt. Lebanon Baptist Church.
and the VVestern Pennsylvania School For The
Blind. A formal concert was given at the
Presbyterian Church in Carnegie and, in Craf-
ton; a chapter of the Eastern Star sponsored
a formal event. Another formal concert was
exchanged with the glee club of Seton Hill

_ College.

The ﬁnal event was the annual banquet, at
which awards were made for attendance. Girls
who have been members for two years received
gold harp—shaped pins; for three years’ mem-
bership, members were presented with pins set
with pearls.

MEN’S GLEE CLUB

The Men’s Glee Club is now in its thirtieth
year: it is the oldest non—athletic organization
on the campus. The group was first organized
as part of the Combined Musical Clubs, and
consisted of 25 members. In September, 1927,
the Dental Chorus and Glee Club combined
into one group, the MEN’S GLEE CLUB,
which now has 75 members.

The purpose of the organization has al-
ways been to stimulate interest in music
among students. an(l to give those with

talent the opportunity to cultivate their voices.

Throughout its existence, the Glee Club
has had a varied program of activities. It has
given concerts in high schools, churches. clubs,
and has sung over the radio. Each year the
organization has taken spring trips, giving con-
certs in various parts of the country. The
Men's Glee Club gives annual concerts before
the Junior Colleges and presents an animal
home concert in Carnegie .\/lusic Hall.

PITT PLAYERS

Pitt Players was organized in 1916 as a
local dramatic fraternity. In 1923, when Mrs.
L. I. MacQueen was coach of the Players, the
group was re—organized as the Dramatic Or-
ganization of the University for the purpose
of promoting the dramatic talent of the student
body as well as to teach the elements of stage
craft. From this a chapter of Theta Alpha
Phi, national dramatic fraternity, was formed.
In 1927 Mr. V\/alter B. Edmundsen became di-
rector and coach. In 1930 Mr. Carl Cass,
formerly of the University of Wisconsin, came
to Pitt as the new director, and with him, great
forward steps are being made.

This year’s program is a good example of
Mr. Cass’ direction. There were three major
productions. The White/waded Boy by Len-
nox Robinson, which cast included Louise

Cohn, George Boggs Jr., Dunlap Dickson,

, Anna May Johnston, Josette Ulrich, Catherine

McGuin, Robert H. Kleeb, David Cornman,
Martin B. Fallon, Barbara Fetterman, Ethel
Danforth, and Zita Doberneck, was produced
on November 20 at the Y. M. and VV. H. A.
Captain Applejack by VValter Hackett was
given at the same place on February 19. In
the cast were Carl Swartz, Elaine Blauvelt,
Mary Agnes Vitchestian, Clarence Sober, Bar-
bara Ann Hartmann, Ruth Drum, Roy Ma-
gram, John St. Peter. Anita Staley. Herbert
Fine. and George Taylor. Alice-Sit-By-TI1e~
Fire by James M. Barrie was also given.

Besides these productions, three one-act
experimental plays were presented every two
weeks. Pitt Players also furnished the enter-
tainment for the Yuletide Festival.

PITT BAND

The early ancestor of the present band ﬁrst
made its appearance at the \/Vestern University
of Pennsylvania in 1904. It consisted of eight
young men whose ofﬁcial uniforms were inex-
pensive caps. A few years later a uniform

‘made up of a derby and sweater was adopted.

The derby, especially, proved quite perishable,
and the full uniform never lasted longer than
one season.

The Band was reorganized in 1911 under
the leadership of Saul Sabad and the manage-
ment of Dan Kirk, and made its ﬁrst public ap-
pearance on October 14 of that year at the Pitt-
Ohio Northern game in Forbes Field. During
1915 Dr. Holden was secured as faculty ad-
visor. His efforts on behalf of the organization
have earned him a high spot in its history. In
1917 Professor M. S. Rocereto, a composer of
note, became the coach, and in 1919 Dr. Gustav
L. Schramm, a former band member and na-
tional president of O. D. K., became faculty
advisor.

[ Page Two Hundred Five J

Under the new method of administration
inaugurated in 1927, control of the band is in
the hands of the student manager, assistant
manager, and two apprentice managers, who are
appointed by a committee consisting of the
graduate manager of student activities, faculty
advisor, and retiring manager.

Under the leadership of Professor Roc-
ereto and Dr. Schramm the organization has
grown to one of the biggest and best bands in
the country. In the fall of 1930 the band was
incorporated in the R. O. T. C., and adopted
the smart blue and gold uniforms of the army
corps. They are now full ﬂedged members of
the army, and form an indispensable unit.

The Band was originally formed for the
purpose of arousing school spirit at football
games and pep meetings, but has been devel-
oped into a concert organization. It is one of
the oldest and most important organizations on
the campus of the University of Pittsburgh.

SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA

The University Symphony Orchestra is
an outgrowth of the former Pitt Ensemble. It
is the most recent of the musical organizations
on the campus, having received its charter from
the University in the fall of 1927. The or-
chestra was created in response to a long felt
need for an organization which could supple-
ment the Band and other musical activities.

The Symphony Orchestra gave its ﬁrst
program before the Yuletide Festival of 1927.
Its activities have grown since then to include
appearances before Pitt Players, Assembly, and
Commencement Exercises. During the past
season the Orchestra also gave a concert at the
V\"'estern Pennsylvania School for the Blind.

Professor M. S. Rocereto, who directs the

‘University Symphony, is a member of the Pitts-

burgh Symphony Orchestra.

THE YEAR IN MUSIC AND DRAlVIATICS

A REVIEW

Musical organizations and Pitt Players enjoyed a most successful year. The
home concerts of the men’s and women’s glee clubs and that of the band, all of
which were well attended, included interesting classics as well as light modern
works. Pitt Players, especially, made a ﬁne showing under its new faculty director,
Carl B. Cass. The three plays presented by the organization were generally ad-
judged the ﬁnest given in the history of the Players.

PITKIN CLUB

The Pitkin Club, the ﬁrst organized reli-
gious group on the campus, was founded about
eighteen years ago by several Pittsburgh dele-
gates to the first Student Volunteer Conference
held at Kansas City, Missouri, in 1913. After
their return these representatives asked Rev.
Dr. Hugh Thomson Kerr, pastor of the Shady-
side Presbyterian Church to be their teacher
and advisor. The group decided to meet
weekly at the Shadyside Church with students
of the University to discuss the problems of the
missionary ﬁelds and the interests of Christian
work. The newly found club chose as its
namesake Horace Pitkin. a missionary who
was killed in the Boxer Rebellion of 1900.

The present Pitkin Club proper has an en-
rollment of sixty—ﬁve members, as contrasted
with a meager dozen at the time of its birth in

1913. Three branches of the Pitkin Club have
been founded by former members of the club
whose life work called them to other parts of
the country.

At its inception the organization was pri-
marily theological and religious in character,
but today the Pitkin Club is a non—denomina-
tional and non-sectarian body of students as-
sembled for the discussion and treatment of
current problems of youth in the light of Chris-
tian standards and ethics. However. the club
is still under the expert guidance and direction
of the Rev. Dr. Kerr, who at present holds the
ofﬁce of Moderator of the Presl)yterian Church
of the United States. Dr. Kerr is ably as-
sisted in the administration of the club by Rev.
Robert Steele, assistant pastor of the Shady-
side Presbyterian Church.

HUNGARIAN STUDENTS CLUB

Founded but three years ago, the Hun-
garian Students Club now has a roster of some
sixty active, associate, and honorary members.
Although the idea of such a club was proposed
previously by a number of prominent Hun-

garians, it is primarily due to the efforts of Dr.
Fetter, professor of the Hungarian course given
at that time, and Reverend Szabo, then a grad-
uate student in English, that the club owes its
existence.

UNDERGRADUATE CAP-GOVVN CLUB

The Undergraduate Cap and Gown Club
was organized in 1926 to promote an intense
and lasting loyalty to Cap and Gown on the part
of its members. Organized in 1926, the Under-
graduate Cap and Gown Club is an honorary
organization; only those who have been in the
Cap and Gown show for two years are eligible
for election. Members are chosen on the basis

of personality, attitude, and loyalty toward Cap
and Gown.

Since its organization the club has had as
one of its aims the purchasing of a Cap and
Gown curtain. This year the club realized its

desire by presenting to Cap and Gown a cur-
tain, made and designed in New York.

[ PENN RELAYS }

Five members of the 1931 Pitt varsity
track team competed in the annual Penn Relay
carnival sponsored by the University of Penn-
sylvania on April 25, 26.

Captain Everett Utterback, “Woody” Har-
ris, Jerry Vitulla, Len Monheim and Jim
\7Vatkins were the men that made the trip.
Utterback entered the hop, step, and jump, and
broad jump. The other four members of the
team were entered in the Class B mile relay
race.

On the ﬁrst day of the meet, Captain Ever-
ett Utterback was the only Pitt man repre-
sented. This was Utterback’s third appearance
in the Penn events. He competed in the de-
cathlon when he was a sophomore, and after
leading the ﬁeld during the ﬁrst half of the
competition through his ability in the sprints
and jumps, he dropped behind in the weight
events and ﬁnished in ﬁfth place.

- [ Page Two Hundred Twenty-two ]

He passed up the decathlon this year an(l
conﬁned himself to the jumps. Utterback took
a ﬁrst place in the hop, step and jump, and set
a good example for the rest of the Pitt team.
He spanned forty-ﬁve feet seven and seven
eighths inches to ﬁnish nine inches more than
any other leaper.

On Saturday, Utterback entered the broad
jump, in which event he has been intercollegiate
indoor record holder for the past two years, but
failed to place because of having hurt his leg
in the previous day’s competition.

The personnel of the relay team was the
same as that which represented the Panthers
in 1930 in the Class B race, with the exception
that Jim VVatkins ran in place of “Pete” Bowen
who had completed his allotted three years of
athletic competition. In l930 the relay team
ﬁnished second to Colgate, but the ﬁeld was too
fast, and the Panthers failed to place better
than fourth.

A miracle was RAY KOPNICKI, de-
veloping slowly as a sophomore, due to
excessive grit and determination Ray
blossome(l in the latter half of his junior
year until he began to be a steady point
getter for Coach Shea. A senior this
year, Ray is looked upon as one of the
mainstays of the team and is expected to
bring many points our way. Of course
Ray cannot compete with the Country's
leading exponents of the javelin throw
but he has already taken toll of the
greater majority of section leaders. He
will be sent to the Penn Relays where
he will be put to the big test. May he
make good in a big way—Ray deserves
to.

 

[ TRACK ]

Pitt's track team compiled an un-
impressive record for the 1930 sea-
son. The Panthers competed in six
outdoor dual meets, losing ﬁve.

Captain Pete Bowen was out-
standing in all meets. He took
ﬁrst places in the dashes against
West Virginia, Ohio State, Penn
State, Carnegie Tech, and Army.

Competing in the Penn Relays,

Everett Utterback placed third in.

the running hop, step and jump.
He took a ﬁrst place at the Ohio
State Relays iii the broad jump.

Others who did well for the
Panthers were Knobloch, Luch,
Kopnicki and Jim VVatkins. Kop-
nicki hurled the javelin well enough
to win all dual meets, and Luch
took a majority of first places iii
the shot put and discus.

EVERETT UTTERBACK is the best
all-around track man ever to attend Pitt.
During his collegiate career, he has won
points for the Panthers in the sprints,
the hurdles, the high jump, the broad
jump, the shot put, the hammer throw,
and the pole Vault. He is nationally
famous as one of the best decathlon men
in the United States.

Although he is a better than average
man in each of these events, his best
marks have been made in the broad jump.
He broke the record in winning the in-
tercollegiate indoor championship in
1930 and 1931.

BOB CAESAR has been a mem-
ber of the Pitt varsity cross-coun-
try and track teams for the past
three seasons, and he captained the
former team during the past season.

Caesar also shone as a track
luminary. In his sophomore year,
he broke the “Big Four” two mile
record by running the distance in
10 minutes, 10 seconds. His record
for that event still stands.

 

-~[ Page Two Hundred Forty-thrcc 1

Coach Frank J. Shea’s cross-
cou11try team compiled a fair rec-
ord for the season of 1930, winning
two out of their ﬁve scheduled
meets.

The harriers opened their season
against Allegheny College defeat-
ing them o11 the modiﬁed four and
a half mile Schenley Park course
by 16 to 39.

Journeying to Columbus for their
second meet on October 13, the
Pitt team was trounced by a strong
Ohio State squad44O to 19.

Pen11 State took Pitt by a per-
fect score.

The Panther traveled to New
York on November 1, to be de-
feated by Syracuse‘another per-
fect score.

In the ﬁnal meet of the year. the
Panther harriers secured revenge
for the one point setback handed
them by Carnegie Tech during the
1929 season. Shea's men won by
30 to 25.

A champion in his undergraduate
days and a former Olympic com-
petitor for the United States,
FRANK J, SHEA has proven just
as valuable to the Panthers as track
and cross country coach as he did
when a runner. He was mainly
responsible for the development of
Utterback, Pete Bowen, Ed Knob-
loch, Ken V\'ibecan, Don Gwinn,
Gibby VVelch. and other famous
stars who wore Pitt uniforms.

VVhile he was still a student, he
ran the quarter mile in 47 3/5 sec-
onds, 1/5 of a second slower than
the approved world's record for
that event.

 

-\~v.~\~.

 

Although he has been coach of
the Pitt swimming teams ever since
he graduated, PAT CORR did not
receive the credit due him until the
present season when his teams won
all their meets.

In his undergraduate days, he
was the leading free style swimmer
on the team. He held the records
in the free style sprints until a
short time ago when Bill Wright,
one of his proteges, shaved a few
seconds off his time.

 

[ SWIMMING ]

Pitt’s swimming teams enjoyed
their most successful seasons of
competition during the past year
when they won all their meets,
VVooster, Case, and Carnegie Tech,
Eco:-ing 160 points to its opponents’

4.

The freshman team had a more
extensive schedule, nine meets be-
ing on the program. It, too, had
little trouble in annexing victories
in all of them, the closest meet
being with Kiski in the opener in
which the yearlings won, 38-21.

Both the varsity and the fresh-
man teams combined in four meets
against amateur clubs in this dis-
trict. Although these teams dis-
played better form than did Pitt’s
collegiate opponents, Coach Corr’s
proteges were victorious in every
one.

Pitt’s outlook for next season is
very bright. The members of the
freshman team won every event but
one in the University champion-
ships.

 

FRED VVOOLDRIDGE com-
pleted three years of competition as
a member of the Pitt varsity swim-
ming team during the past season.
He acted as captain during the last
two years, and he won the Harry
Quigley Taylor memorial trophy
in his junior year.

W'ooldridge starred for Pitt in
both the free style sprints and in
the back—stroke. He led the var-
sity team in scoring throughout his
career here and was the lone var-
sity man to win a University cham-
pionship.

DR. VV. E. MCELLROY ﬁrst
assumed the duties of tennis coach
in 1930 upon the death of Dr.
Stephens who had coached the
team for eight years and under
whose guidance McEllroy had
learned the rudiments of the game.

Dr. McEl1roy was a star before,
during, and after his under grad-
uate days; and together with Dr.
John O’Laughlin, then a student at
Pitt, he won the Western Pennsyl-
vania doubles championship from
the best players in this section.

 

[ TENNIS ]

A very formidable schedule has
been drawn up for Pitt’s varsity
tennis team which includes as fea-
tures the Army and Navy teams.
Pitt already has defeated Bethany
by an overwhelming score of 7-0.
Next in line comes a return match
with Bethany down in West Vir-
ginia. On the 25th the Panther
racqueters will cross with the
W&J presidents at Washington,
Pa. The 30th will ﬁnd the boys
in Washington, D. C., playing
Georgetown and George Washing-
ton Universities. Then follow the
strong Navy team at Annapolis, the
Duquesne team here in Pittsburgh
and in short order Allegheny, Car-
negie, and Ohio State.

A most successful year is antici-
pated due to the ﬁne condition of
the players at this early stage in
the season.

E. Jacobs, Cohen, Adler, B. Jacobs

  

EDDIE JACOBS, captain of the
Pitt tennis team for the past two
years and number one singles and
doubles player for the past three
years, is the most outstanding ten-
nis player ever to represent the
Panthers. Jacobs won the Sey-
mour cup, emblematic of the Uni-
Versity championship every year in
which he attended Pitt.

Jacobs is also a star in his own
right in the national ﬁeld, and he
was ranked twelfth nationally in
the singles list. Eddie has recently
been honored by selection to the
famous Davis Cup Squad which is
the highest honor accorded to a
tennis player.

Look down the years and know each other through

The strong, unfailing fellowship of growing

Brush close in pointing to the Unknown Land.

[PEPPER PRIZE]

THE GEORGE WHARTON PEPPER PRIZE

The award most prized by students at the
University—the George VVharton Pepper Prize
—went this year to EDWARD A. SCHULTZ,
a senior in the College. Activities man, out-
standing scholar, and popular, albeit shy,
young man, Schultz built for himself a most
enviable reputation in college. Although he
won several scholarships, “Eddie” had to work
most of his way through school; this he did by
tutoring and by selling insurance. Continually
doing outside work, he still found time to par-
ticipate in a host of extra-curricular activities.
“Eddie” spent three years on the Varsity grid
team and one year ‘on the freshman squad. In
addition, he was a member of the men’s debat-
ing team for two years; vice-president of Stu-
dent Council; vice-president of Pi Tau Phi,
honorary scholastic fraternity; vice-president
of Pi Sigma Alpha, honorary political science

{ Page Two Hundred Forty-eight }

fraternity; vice-president of Omicron Delta
Kappa, honorary activities fraternity; and
president of Theta Kappa Nu, national social
fraternity. He has tutored members of the
football squad in political science, psychology,
and English. “Eddie’s” scholarship average
for his college career is 2.8 quality points, a
grade of A—. A political science major, he
plans to enter Law School.

The prize, which carries with it a cash
award of $100, has been presented annually
since 1922 by former United States Senator
George Wharton Pepper to the University of
Pittsburgh undergraduate “who in the opinion
of his fellow students most closely conforms to
the type of student the University aims to pro-
duce.” The recipient of the prize is chosen by
a committee of students representing every
class in each school of the University.

SPRING FESTIVAL

The Spring Festival, held from April 30 to May 2,
initiated its activities on the ﬁrst night of the three-
day celebration with an informal Festival Frolic in the
Urban Room of the William Penn Hotel, Dick Rid-
gely and his “Gentlemen of the Air” furnishing the
music. The following morning, Friday, May 1, Tap-
ping Assembly was held in Memorial Hall‘ for men’s
and women’s honorary organizations. Awards were
presented to outstanding undergraduates in the various
ﬁelds of study, presentation of the Pepper Prize head-
ing the list.

The traditional Interfraternity Sweepstakes were
held on the afternoon of the second day, the winners
of ﬁrst and second places being awarded silver loving
cups. Following this event, girl students burlesqued

the men's sweepstakes with a race of their own. The
Parade of the Pantherettes came next, each sorority
sponsoring a ﬂoat. Next came the Girls’ Scooter
Race. Activities for the afternoon were brought to a
close with the men’s pushball and tug-of-war contests,
which were staged on the ﬁeld adjacent to the Ruskin
Apartments.

Varsity Night featured the second evening of the

Festival. Special acts and stunts by members of the
student body, movies, and a jazz band entertained at

Carnegie Music Hall. Robert Kleeb acted as master‘

of ceremonies.

The lnterfraternity Track Meet was held in the
Stadium Saturday afternoon. That evening dances at
the various fraternity houses climaxed the celebration.

Ph.D. Fellow

“I hope that all you students—at any rate
you in the graduating c1ass—have made the one
really important discovery about education:
Your education as it is today is what you have
acquired through your own efforts. Knowing
this, you are ready to go away from the uni-
versity conﬁdent that your future growth is not
conditioned by having some one else tell you
all about it. Good luck to all of you."

SEPTEMBER
A Gladsome Air Pervading All

Bewilderment—freshmen trying to follow directions——a cramped hand——registration
day.

First dance of the year—Freshman party—half begun conversations——a getting-
acquainted affair.

A pushing crowd—hurriedly written checks——frantic search for identiﬁcation—the
University Book’s Store’s busy day.

Freshmen get a taste of real college spirit—Football team meets VVaynesburg——who
won ?—need you ask.

OCTOBER
The Swing of Lessons Once Again

Another dance—College Association——things are coming on.

This time we eat—Y. W. C. A. entertains with membership banquet—even had two
helpings of cake.

A home football game, again, at last——almost forgot there was such a thing—not
such a joyous occasion, for—we must admit it—-Notre Dame walked away with the
honors.

NOVEMBER
Mid-Semesters Followed by Turkey Time

Sweet warblings—Men’s Glee Club rehearses.

What a great feeling———Tech subdued again——Whoopie!
Day off——Armistice Day.

Foreign Students meet and eat at Heinz House—-

DECEMBER
Festivities, Home and Vacation

Student Council convenes at Heinz House and discusses weighty student matters.
Dancing once more—Business Administration Association blossoms forth at Schen-
ley Hotel—9 o’clock, if you please.

English Department drinks tea——it’s becoming a habit—

The Yuletide Festival brings forth Christmas cheer—and school is over for 1930!

JANUARY
Short Lived Resolutions Born

Back to lessons slightly the worse for the vacation.

Men beware——keep out—the Women’s Debating Association meets this evening at

the Heinz House—and what chance has a Pitt male with a female debater!

Greek letters and plaques everywhere—pep and spirits ( ?????)—starting the year

right—the Interfraternity Ball. ~

A great change has occurred—something is going to happen—seems serious——stu-

dents are even studying—the boughey—man is coming near~—Mr. Semester Finals.

FEBRUARY .

Begins Another Semester

Registration once more——another $150 gone—for it all a registration card certifying
that Blank Blank is an accredited student at the University of Pittsburgh.
Revenge at last—Pitt beat Notre Dame—yea for a ripping good basketball team!
Long lines of black-robed seniors—-a sheepskin—the turn of a tassel—another class
become alumni.

Just to show there are a few serious things about school, the University of Pitts-
burgh Chapter of the Society of Sigma XI was formally installed this evening at
Carnegie Lecture Hall.

“Three little words”—The Junior Prom.

Parties, teas, and dances—petite smiles and all-covering inspections—in short, the
women’s rushing season is on.

MARCH

Brisk VVinds Blowing Campus Skirts

Boys will be girls in the springtime—so Cap and Gown meets to ponder over
“What’s Up”——now for the fun.

Luck—Omega Delta members get quarantined and consequently have their pictures
splattered over the -papers while having-a rip—roaring time of it.

To make certain their college education is complete the men played the ﬁrst round
of the Interfrateriiity Elimination Bridge Tourney today—and this is college!
What the college girl should wear—the Co-ed Style Show—oh yeah ?—maybe, if
we were millionaires.

The usual grind—class down at lecture hall—breathless dash to Alumni——crackers
and milk for lunch—more classes—then home, for a change, to surprise the family.
Assembly and speaker—Dr. Vilhjalmur (don’t even try to pronounce it) Stefansson
and the “Friendly Arctic”—br-r-r.

APRIL

The First VVarm Day and Spring Fever
........................................................................................................................ _.April Fool!
What a system—sunny skies—smiling maidens—the great out-doors (or a part of
it on Heinz House walk)—voting day for women—with, of course, stray photog-
raphers here and there.

Another reason for going to college—Cwens leave for national convention at Alle-
gheny College—-and a sporting good time.

Cheering headline in Weekly—-“Place 100 Men Within Week.”

Saturday night—-the grand ﬁnale—Cap and Gown makes its bow at the Nixon for
another year. No more males worrying about tottering on high heels.

At last the suspense is over—Eddie Schultz is announced Pepper Prize Winner
and Peg Hall Senior Queen.

MAY

Stragglers in Schenley Park

The Spring Festival closes with the Interfraternity Meet in the afternoon and
dances in the evening.

Dig in your pockets—help a fellow—Student Loan Day.

A Grecian Play Day——sports for all tastes.

A serious air over-shadowing the campus——books very much in evidence-ﬁnals

starting to be felt.
JUNE

A Sheepskin Tightly Clasped
Exams start——nuff ced.
Baccalaureate service and a pause for reﬂection.
Commencement——the year is over—fare-thee-well, 1931.

NE of the old philosophers is
credited with having said, "After all we do
those things which we really want to do."
An analysis of our conduct from day to day
really proves the correctness of this phi-
losophy. Our accomplishments, yours and ,
mine, are the direct result of a determination to accomplish.

Strange to relate, many of the world's greatest accomplish-

ments are the outgrowth of dreams— sometimes just day
dreams. Dreams only become realities when the dreamer 0 M E
has the determination to see them through.

The idea that you would attend Dental College and become

a member of a noble profession was, at one time, more or
less a dream. Remember? You posessed the determination
to make that dream a reality.

And peculiar as it might seem, all of the time that you have
been accomplishing your object, you have been dreaming of
other things-— among them a successful professional career.

Your ability to make this dream a reality again depends upon
your determination; however, you must not handicap your-
self by an uncomplimentary introduction to your patients.
Remember-—

"A dentist is accepted by his patients as being as modern
as his surroundings indicate."

Ritter's 40 years of experience is yours for the asking.

It is only natural to expect claimsfor excellence
in design, materials, and workmanship in the man—
ufacturer’s description of his product. To anyone
unacquainted with S. S.White methods and policies
such claims would make little or no impression any
more than the customary language of advertising.
When, however, one gives a little thought to the
history of a producing organization and to its rec—
ognized business policies, the printed words about
its product have more signiﬁcance.

The S. S.White Dental Manufacturing Company
commenced its history in 1844 by making and sell-
ing only the best dental supplies possible of pro»
duction. In its long business existence an enviable
reputation for doing things right has extended to
all parts of the world. S. S. White goods are ac—
cepted everywhere as the highest standard in den-
tal supplies.

In the manufacture of dental chairs and equip-
ment at Prince Bay, Staten Island, N.Y., the
accuracy and thoroughness of construction simply
reﬂect the general principles of S. S. White produc-
tion. No detail is slighted, no parts are unimpor—
tant because they may be concealed from view, no
work is done on the “good enough”basis. Likewise
no material is used to save cost and increase profit,
and compromise quality. That is why S. S. White
engines, handpieces, steel goods, chairs, and equip-
ment give years and years of uniformly excellent
service. That is why generations of dentists have
continued to purchase S. S. White products. That
is the plain reason for their ultimate economy.

OF COURSE

. . . you’ll want your own x-ray unit

REQUENT use of the x-ray is one of the
ways by which the public is learning to
distinguish the progressive dentist. More
and more the leaders in the profession are
installing their own x-ray units.

They find that making their own radio-
graphs enables them to render better ser-
vice, to make their time more proﬁtable.
They soon become expert in interpretation.
And this ownership of an x—ray unit proves
to be not an expense, but an investment
from which they get a steady yield.

The Victor CDX Dental X-ray Unit has

been a great factor in creating this vogue for
individual ownership. The Victor CDX

hangs suspended from the wall. It is elec—
trically safe. Both transformer and tube, in-
sulated in oil, are enclosed in the tube head.
There is no high tension current exposed
anywhere. You and your patient can touch
the CDX anywhere while it is in operation.
There is no danger of shock.

Let us send you the facts drawn from the
experience of successful practitioners about
this modern unit. It makes radiography
almost as simple as photography. As you
start out, you cannot afford to be without
this important tool of your profession.
Ask us for details of monthly payment plan.

dentist permit immediate correction of minor tooth ills, and the prevention of
more serious ones.

Resolve that you will ﬁx a deﬁnite time, twice a year, to visit your dentist.
This resolution will pay you dividends in the most priceless of human posses-
sions. . . . Good health!

ACKNOWLE DGMEN TS

T TO THE STAFF

Without the interest and cooperation of each of you whose name
appears on the masthead, this, the XXVI volume of the Owl, would not
have been possible. Some of you have given more of yourselves than
others. To you we acknowledge a double debt of gratitude, for we
realize that the ﬁnest idea, the theme most poignant with possibility re-
mains only an idea, unless a staff of ability, enthusiasm, and willingness
lends itself to the book’s production. i

We wish the staﬁ of the 1932 Owl every success, but above all, we
hope that your joy in working on the book will be as great as ours has
been and that your relationship with each other will be as congenial and
as happy as that which has this year overcome any misunderstanding.

Remember then; look back, and think what white

Small butterﬂies weave down the campus grass,
What buttercups, what dandelion-light

Would peep through greenness at you, should you pass,
What sun grows strong on an Alumnae wall,
What darkened ivy spreads on old State Hall.
