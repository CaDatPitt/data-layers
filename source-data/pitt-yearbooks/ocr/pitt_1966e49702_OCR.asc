Transition—-the movement
from one place to another; a
change of state; the movement
to a new outlook; a change of
style. Transition creates an
an atmosphere of uncertainty,
ambiguity, unrest, ﬂuctuation,
and constant turmoil. It is a
time for the unexpected and
the norm is abnormality. 1966
was a year of transition for
Pitt. Once ﬁscal tremors ﬁrst
rocked the Cathedral’s
immovable foundation in
1965, change became
inevitable. Chancellor Edward
H. Litchﬁeld left the
University and a dream left
Pittsburgh. The goal of a
private University with an
academic orientation became
an Alice-in—Wonderland tale
as the realities of capital
expenditure said: “deﬁcit.”

A reactionary movement re-
placed that dream, pointing to
the “old fashioned bargain
days” when Pitt’s prime goal
was serving the community
with low tuition and classrooms
for the Pittsburgh masses.
Community service ﬁrst,
academic concern second.
Money became the by-Word.
Dr. Stanton Crawford acted as
Chancellor guiding the

University to its new
perspective, preserving the
status quo, and ultimately
suffering a fatal heart attack.
David Kurtzman, ex—Governor
David Lawrence’s ﬁnancial
right-hand man, was brought
here on contract to set the
books straight. Strict ﬁscal
measures were employed,
maintenance and security staffs
cut, and faculty received little
ﬁnancial encouragement.
Crawford spoke as Kurtzman
and Dr. Edgar Cale, Vice
Chancellor of Development,
lobbied ’round the clock for
increased aid. University
affairs became increasingly tied
to state politics as Democrats
and Republicans used the
University as a political foot-
ball. The state aid came in

late summer, tuition was
lowered, and admissions of
commuter and in-state students
received prime emphasis.

Administrative elites began
conscious modeling of Pitt
after those more noted aca-
demic institutions, Penn State
and Temple. The ﬁnancial
balance sheet received a large
credit, the academic balance
sheet an immeasurable loss.
Externally there was little
evidence of the school’s
changing demeanor. Construc-
tion took its usual place in

the drab Oakland landscape.
The Hillman library rose
steadily, the Frick Fine Arts
Building opened, construction
of terraced athletic ﬁelds
began, an addition to Salk
Hall emerged, and a proposed
annex to Langley Hall was
announced. All appeared to be
booming as in the farsighted
Litchﬁeld plan. Inside the
hallowed halls of concrete

and steel, all was busting.
Personnel changes proliferated
as new turns were constructed
in the corridors of power.
Some seemed good, too many
seemed bad.

If you wanted a man from
Pitt, 1966 was the year to get
him. In the merry-go-round
atmosphere of academia
professors are continually
lured by competing schools
with variable ﬁnancial and
status offers. Pitt was in crisis-
it was low on ﬁnances and its
endeavor to climb the rocky

Bradford

The Bradford campus offers to the local residents
and some out-of-state students the diversiﬁed

programs provided at the Oakland campus. Al-
though the Bradford campus consists of only two
buildings, there are plans for its future develop-
ment. The Campus is an integral part of the com-
munity, offering evening and part-time courses
in degree and non-degree programs. In return,
the school receives the support of the residents
in its drive for expansion. The campus is less
than ﬁve years old, and the physical plant and
educational programs have been adequately es-
tablished. Attention is now directed to the devel-
opment of extracurricular activities. The stu-
dents of the Bradford campus are given the
chance to establish themselves in the surround-
ings of a small college setting before moving into
the atmosphere of the main campus.

Greensburg

With the recent acquisition of a hundred
acres of land, the Greensburg campus is
just beginning to expand. Within a dec-
ade new classroom and laboratory facil-
ities will be planned and constructed.
The Greensburg campus is only approxi-
mately thirty miles from Oakland. The
students enrolled at this regional campus
must fulﬁll the same entrance require-
ments as those students at all University
campuses. They pursue a liberal arts
or an engineering curriculum for two
years and may then transfer to the main
campus without loss of credit. The
Greensburg campus offers the added in-
centive of direct bus transportation to
the main campus and the cultural advan-
tages of Oakland. Many student activities
including a debate team, lectures, con-
certs, and a ski club, reﬂect the student
life of the main campus and aid the stu-
dent in adjusting to the larger University
community when he transfers to the
Oakland campus.

Johnstown

The most striking develop-
ment in regional campus pro-
grams is occurring now at the
Johnstown campus of the
University of Pittsburgh. By
September, 1967, new build-
ings will be completed which
will expand the facilities to
accommodate approximately
twelve hundred students. The
new construction includes
dormitories, a cafeteria and
classroom facilities. Estab-
lished over ﬁfty years ago,
Johnstown is the oldest of
the regional campuses. This
school offers basically the
same liberal arts and engi-
neering courses as those of-
fered at the main campus.
The regular trimester calen-
dar is followed and students
may attend four to six trimes-
ters, depending on their in-
dividual courses of study, be-
fore transferring to complete
their degree work. Student
extracurricular activities are
being increased on the Johns-
town campus. They include
social fraternities, sororities,
and student congress. Now
the education of the students
will attain a much more satis-
factory balance.

Titusville

The Titusville campus has as its
present goal the expansion, im-
provement and reﬁnement of the
basic curriculum. The existing
facilities are adequate for the
development of the new pro-
gram. The campus follows the
trimester calendar with an em-
phasis on liberal arts and engi-
neering. Extracurricular activ-
ities are sponsored by the various
student organizations. Faculty
and students often gather for
teas and discussions or take ad-

vantage of the movies and lec-

tures offered. The success of the
regional campus at Titusville
and its acceptance by the com-
munity are encouraging to those
who advocate this type of edu-
cational system. The University
programs of study have been of-
fered on a small scale, nearer to
home and at lower costs to the
residents of the community.

Administration

In August, Herbert McGibbeny assumed the
Ofﬁce of Dean of Men of the University. Having
taught at Pitt for several years, Mr. McGibbeny
was already well acquainted with the Univer-
sity and its policies. However, he is now looking
at Pitt from a different view point. His office
works in coordination with the men’s organiza-
tions and advices a number of other activities,
such as, WPGH, Circle K, and Phi Eta Sigma. ,
Also under the Dean’s direction are the Studies-
Activities Program and the Emergency Loan
Fund. Although Mr. McGibbeny has held his
position only a year, his inﬂuence has been
felt on campus. Students consider him not only
an able administrator, but also a source of
dynamic ideas and personal guidance.

Miss Savina Skewis assumed her duties
as Dean of Women in August. Heir
strong belief in student responsibility
has been manifested in many of her
programs. She has worked closely with
the women students in liberalizing hours
and housing restrictions. The super-
vision of the honor suites in Amos Hall

the increased enrollment at Pitt, wom-
en's housing will become a rather acute
problem with which she will have to
deal. The Mentor and Senior Assistant
programs are directed by her oiﬁce as
well as Pan-Hellenic activities. The
hostessing organization for Heinz
Chapel and the nationality rooms is
another of the groups for which she is
responsible. Miss Skewis, who has been
with the University for twenty years, had
been Associate Dean of Women for ten
years.

is also Miss Skewis’ responsibility. With :;

To call Acting Chancellor David Kurtzman decisive
and energetic somehow seems an understatement. Prac-
tically since his ﬁrst day at the University the entire
school has felt his inﬂuence. He became Vice-Chancellor
for Finance in a period when the University’s ﬁnances
hit a record low and twenty million dollar deﬁcit
hung over the Cathedral like an odious black cloud.
Expense accounts were tightened, personnel was cut
and  numbers were installed to trace long distance
telephone calls. He had only been at the University
a few months when Acting Chancellor Stanton Craw-
ford was struck down by a fatal heart attack. Yet the
Board of Trustees felt that Dr. Kurtzman could best
carry on the position. He has forcefully continued Dr.
Crawford’s drive to make Pitt state-related and in recent
months this effort has consumed most of his energy.
Still this nationally known-ﬁnancial expert has opened
the door of his office wider than ever to Pitt’s‘faculty
and students.

After years of serving in speciﬁc areas of
student affairs, Helen Pool Rush as-
sumed the role of Vice-Chancellor of
Student Affairs. Prior to her appoint-
ment, Miss Rush represented, as Dean
of Women, primarly one area of student
affairs. Her new position, however, re-
quired adapting to the position of co-
ordinator, conciliator, and organizer.
The most challenging assignment was
dealing with a growing student activism
during a crucial transition period at the
University. Although her basic objective
remained providing a student affairs
program for the best interests of the
students, her increased communication
with various student elements brought
an awareness of student diversity.

road to academic excellence
had been thwarted. The Law
School remained without a
Dean and the English depart-
ment was similarly coordinated
by a board. Most resignations
were neatly kept unpublicized

R by the University’s Public

Relations staff as individual
departments suffered losses.
Dean of Social Sciences Rich-
ard Park, Drs. Philbrick and
Meritt in English, Perrow in
Sociology, Chinitz and Rich-
man in Economics, and in-
numerable departures which
administrative elites dis-

» pelled as “the normal turn-

over.”

Improvements were few and
eluded the realm of faculty.
Dr. James Kehl entered as
Dean of Liberal Arts, making
some promising revisions in
the distribution requirements.
The administrative structure
changed with the elimination
of four Vice Chancellor posts,
leaving Drs. Kurtzman, Van
Dusen and Peake as the ruling
triumverate. Athletics re-
ceived a rude awakening as
Athletic Director Frank Carver
took liberty with his conser-

vativism and appointed a new
head football and track coach.
The substantive changes re-
ﬂected the growing concern
for emphasizing an efficient
administrative structure for
Pitt’s new state—related

status, instead of the pre-
Kurtzman emphasis on build-
ing a scholarly faculty and
adding depth to curriculum.
Complaints echoed through the
hallowed halls as apprehensive
faculty and students voiced
concern. Chronic complainers
were told “it’s all for the
better,” “there will be no loss
in academic concerns,” “you’re
not thinking in long—range
terms.” Then the long—range
terms were exposed in a
pathetic commencement
ceremony. The main speaker
was Dr. H. Guyford Stever,
President of Carnegie Tech,
and honorary degrees were
awarded to Frank Magee and
William Rea, both members of
Pitt’s Board of Trustees, and
Dr. Sidney Marland, Superin-
tendent of Pittsburgh Public
Schools. Pitt will now seek
academic excellence by
regional emphasis. Dr. Kurtz-
man simultaneously em-
phasized the need to
“reexamine our responsibili-
ties to the community,” and

to seek the “help and
cooperation” of community
leaders while having “no
intention of becoming limited
to this region.”

Ironically, an earlier move
for academic excellent with
regional improvement as a
by—product had been thwarted
by the refusal of the Mellon
elite to support the University
during its crisis. Panther
Hollow had been designed to
diversify the regional economy
and supply an invaluable
source of research income for
academic purposes. Panther
Hollow failed, Litchﬁeld’s plan
was crushed, and now Pitt
must cooperate on the terms
of the community elite.
Commencement conﬁrmed the
fears of the chronic com-
plainers——Pitt’s place in the
sun was being replaced by its
serving as another institution
dominated by the interlocking
directorate of the Mellons.
The forward look had become
the inward look.

Transition had begun.

Dr. Jerome Chmielewski, Engineering

Traditionally, I suppose the student’s role at the University has centered
around academicians and internal affairs of the University. Lately, however,
it is evident that the student's role at the University has expanded into
extra University affairs. It is my personal opinion that this expansion is
unwise. I think the proper role of the student at the University is to
emulate the academicians; that is, to seek truth through learning, to con-
duct scholarly endeavors, to pursue a professional career, and to participate
in the internal affairs of the University. This role, I believe, will lead to an
effective citizenry that will one day relieve the University of its many com-
mitments, allowing the University to pursue an academic way of life.

Great Professors

John Stuart Mill, in speaking of the
prospects for presenting a general system
of social philosophy to the public, once
wrote, “It is therefore of little use alter-
ing men’s opinions until you have
brought their mind to that higher state
of cultivation, of which better opinions
are the natural and almost spontaneous
growth.” The teaching profession dedi-
cates itself to developing that higher
state of cultivation among the nation’s
youth. Professors are often sidetracked
in achieving this goal by the necessity to
maintain status within professional
ranks. Demands for research and pub-
lishing force many to either avoid un-
dergraduate teaching or to specialize in
some ﬁeld related to graduate studies.
Some professors negate the more profes-
sionally-rewarding glories and devote
their career to educating the under-
graduate, while a selective few combine
their scholarly pursuits with moderate
amounts of undergraduate teaching.

The Great Professor is one who pro-
vides the undergraduate with the neces-
sary stimulation to commit his life to
an active cultivation of the mind.

The OWL pays tribute to these pro-
fessors.

Dr. Abe Laufe, English

Even in a large University com-
munity, students must not be identiﬁ-
cation numbers. They must be in-
dividuals. They must learn to recog-
nize the truth about themselves and
their school. In return for their
loyalty to and. faith in their Univer-
sity, they must be kept informed of
campus developments which pertain
directly to them.

Dr. Robert Avery, Sociology
As students are being forced
to take more of their education
together in masses and batches,
so are they developing more of
a collective sense of their depri-
vation. Student criticism of ad-
ministrative restraints and of de-
personalized teaching is not new,
but it is insistent and it is being
heard. We are moving toward
the day when the role of the
student will carry not only the
right, but the obligation, to be
constructively critical.

Dr. Ellen Chaffee, Nursing

The ferment among students
suggests that they see a broad-
ening of their role within the
University. Admitting that their
primary role must be that of
“learners,” they realize that the
educative process should help
them to grow into constructive
members of society. Conse-
‘quently, they appear to see their
expanded role today as one of
challenge. They are challenging
the University as a whole to pro-
vide the quality of education
that will effectively assist them
in‘ meeting their obligation to
society.

Dr. Bodie Douglas, Chemistry

The University is a community of scholars. A
student’s primary purpose should be to identify
as a scholar for his intellectual development
through associations with faculty and students.
He is preparing himself for today’s world and
thoughtful concern about national and worldwide
events is desirable. His actions should be in good
taste and show proper considerations for others and
for the University.

Dr. Ralph Allen, Speech

The universities of America have often been accused of
indifference to the concerns of their undergraduate stu-
dents. Sometimes the accusation has more than a ring of
truth. As institutions become more complex, their legiti-
mate responsibilities multiply, and faculty energy is di-
verted into non-teaching tasks. Most of these tasks are
important, but student anger at faculty neglect persists
and not without justiﬁcation.

The student at Pitt may have cause for complaint in the
past, but I predict that the future holds much promise. In
the first years of our new partnership with the state, the
role of the undergraduate in the University will increase
and his interests will be given first priority by faculty and
administration. But the student must earn the faculty’s
concern and respect. He must ﬁrst of all adopt a less
utilitarian attitude toward his education, remembering that
education is an end in itself, not simply a means of achiev-
ing social respectibility or advancement in a career. The
real purpose of education is to provide freedom and plea-
sure—freedom from ignorance and prejudice and fear, and
the pleasure that comes from the continuous and rigorous
exercise of the imagination.

Dr. Robert Marshall, English

As much as I support the developing student
insistence that the process of education evolve
more through dialogue and less by proclamation,
I feel obliged to urge students to remember
tolerantly their place in the scheme of things, to
realize that only the freedom which has grown
through discipline, and therefore knows it is
free, is meaningful.

Dr. J. B. Schneewind, Philosophy

“Learning” doesn’t mean just “sitting in front
of a talking professor.” It means essentially:
coming to think intelligently about a given sub-
ject. Unless students try to do that they are
boring to teach. If they do do that, they will apply
the habit of intelligent thought outside the class-
room. Since thought and action are inseparably
interwined, this is likely to lead to all sorts of
unexpected consequences. And that is just what
one would expect and hope for.

Dr. E. B. Stuart, Engineering
If the student were allowed to time—travel to

his own city ten or ﬁfteen years into the future
he would be vitally involved in the politics,
opinions, art, science, and technology. The stu-
dent of today has this opportunity since a uni-
versity with its scholars and leaders is a sample
of the larger community of the future.

Dr. Arthur Tuden,
Anthropology
The role of the stu-
dent during any crisis,
either local or na-
tional, is to ﬁght for
the conditions which
promote a true edu-
cation—freedom to ex-
plore, and to have
access to conﬂicting
ideas.

Mr. Robert Lewis, Physical Education

The students should have more and better
communication with the faculty and admin-
istration with an opportunty to express
their views and opinions on all areas of
University life. With this opportunity
more students should take part and con-
tribute the necessary leadership in a variety
of activities rather than limit themselves to
one area of specialization.

 

 

The majority of the undergraduates at the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh have had at least some con-
tact with the School of Liberal Arts. It is the
oldest and largest school in the University. Ap-
proximately two thousand students are currently
enrolled in the three divisions, humanities, social
sciences and natural sciences. Dr. James Kehl
became Dean of the School in the Fall after serv-
ing the University for several years in other
capacities. The Liberal Arts Executive Council
was convened to review current requirements
within the School, such as the students’ nemesis
—the distribution of studies program. The Coun-
cil consists of Dean Kehl, Assistant Dean Mul-
grave and two faculty members from each of the
three divisions. The perennial distrust of the ad-
vising system was exhibited by the students as
well as a serious concern for the improvement of
the general curriculum and the development of
a course guide.

Engineering

Overlooking the lower campus is the Hill, Mecca for all engi-
neers. Here in outdated buildings, the slide rule slippers te-
diously grind out their Therm and Double E problems and
wistfully dream of the future engineering complex they’ll
never use. But at some time during their freshman year, the
engineering students develop a pride and affection for their
Hill, and they begin to conceive of it as their home. They
bemoan the inequalities between the Liberal Arts and the En-

gineering curriculums, instructors, high tuition, and compul-
sory attendance at seminars. Caught in an endless bog of
class hours, labs, and homework, a short beer in the Pitt
Tavern is a welcome break. Come graduation day, however,
the engineers are the most envied students in the procession.
Many opportunities beckon—industry, government, research.
Not to be forgotten are the additional rewards of high pay
and draft deferments.

For those enrolled in the School of Education, the cli-
max of four trimesters of Liberal Arts courses and three
of professional training arrives in student teaching.
Fortiﬁed by the philosophies of Mann and Dewey, of the
role of positive reinforcement and individualized in-
struction, the prospective teacher purchases his supply
of red pencils and magic markers and goes into the class-
room to ﬁnd out what teaching is really all about. For
ﬁfteen weeks he checks papers, makes bulletin board dis-
plays, and experiments with various teaching techniques.
He discovers many things not mentioned in the profes-
sional texts—the qualities inherent in good teaching and
the satisfaction in motivating a child to learn.

Nursing

After two years in the School of Liberal Arts, Pitt nurs-
ing students enter the three year program of the School
of Nursing. The students must be prepared to meet the
various challenges both of academic and practical exper-
ience which will constitute their training. The curri-
culum is structured to provide a variety of learning
situations, with instructions in using equipment. As it is
quite important to gain experience in specialized ﬁelds,
the nursing student has the advantage of working in at
least four different hospitals—Magee, Children’s, Pres-
byterian and Western Psych. Clinical training begins
within one week after the student has entered the School
of Nursing. In addition to the undergraduate program,
the School had ﬁve programs on the masters level and six
full-time doctoral students. The fact that students from
California come to Pitt’s Nursing School for post-gradu-
ate work is one indication of the School’s growth both
in size and national recognition.

The School of Dentistry is one of the ﬁve schools of the health
professions at the University of Pittsburgh. The School has un-
limited facilities in the Health Center to develop in the student
an appreciation of his role as a member of a health service pro-
fession. Pre-clinical instruction is given to freshmen and sopho-
mores with an emphasis on basic science. Later, undergraduates
observe clinical oral surgery at various University hospitals and
also study ambulatory oral cancer cases at the Falk Clinic. In the
near future a new and more modern dental clinic will be built to
accommodate the thousands of patients treated annually in the
present clinics. In addition to the four year curriculum leading to
the D.D.S. degree, the University offers a seven year combined
Liberal Arts-Dentistry program leading to the degree of Bachelor
of Science at the end of the fourth year and of D.D.S. upon the
completion of the seventh year of work.

After four trimesters in the School of Liberal Arts,
the student may enter the three year program of the
School of Pharmacy. For the remainder of his edu-
cation, the pharmacy student concentrates on stud-
ies which will make him an expert in using bal-
ances, mortars and pestles and conical graduates to
prepare ointments, emulsions and capsules. All
phases of the pharmaceutical profession are studied,
and after graduation the student is prepared in
areas ranging from work in a hospital to an indus-
trial pharmaceutics company. Within the School
the faculty and students work exceptionally well
together, and from this the student gains a sense of
dedication and responsibility which is vital for
those involved in the health professions. The stu-
dents also have a range of extra-curricular activities
such as, the pharmaceutical fraternities—Kappa
Psi, Phi Delta Chi, and Alpha Zeta Omega, and
the Pitt Capsule which is published three times
per year.

Graduate Schools

The existence of schools for grad-
uate education is intrinsic in the
term “university.” At Pitt, the
Liberal Arts graduate may do ad-
vance study in almost any ﬁeld
within the divisions of natural
sciences, humanities and social
sciences. The Graduate School of
Social Work, Library Science and
Public and International Affairs
offer programs in areas not usual-
ly covered on the undergraduate
levels. The Schools in the health
professions—Medicine and Dentis-
try—are gradually gaining national
recognition. The Law School and
the Graduate School of Business
are also gaining the respect of the
academic community. In each of
the graduate schools, learning is
continued outside of the classroom.
The scope of graduate study at the
University has broadened into ﬁelds
as diverse as the study of nuclear
energy to German political systems.

Associated Women Students

The governing body of all Pitt undergraduate women
is the Associated Women Students. A.W.S. has sought to
formulate, voice and activate the ideals of women stu-
dents since its founding in 1920. A.W.S. has co-sponsored
the fall activities fair and parties for transfer students.
Lantern Night, the traditional ceremony in which fresh-
men girls are declared University women, was conducted
again this year under the auspices of A.W.S.

A.W.S. is composed of a Housing Board, which governs
rules and regulations to be followed in all of the women’s
dormitories; the Freshman Council, which is elected
representatives of the freshman women and serves to

associate the new students with the University; and the‘

Executive Council, which is responsible for coordinating
the entire organization. Members of A.W.S. also play a
responsible role during the summer orientation sessions.

Cheerleaders

The Cheerleaders’ main responsibility is, of course, to cheer at all
home football and basketball games. Squad members try to
attend as many away football games as possible. This year they
traveled to West Virginia, New York for the Syracuse game, and
to Washington, D. C., for the Navy game. Pep rallies are held
before the home games. This year, before the Penn State game,
the squad sponsored a bonﬁre which was attended by the coach
and the team. At each rally, the coach or a team member spoke.
Try-outs for cheerleading are held the second trimester of each
year. Any undergraduate student with a 2.25 QPA is eligible,
and this average has to be maintained throughout the school year.

The Engineering and Mines Cabinet acts as the
“student government” for the engineers at Pitt.
Three members are chosen from each engineer-
ing department to represent the sophomores,
juniors, and seniors and three members at large
are chosen to represent the new students. The
Cabinet functions to coordinate the various
clubs and societies of engineering students and
to promote and encourage a spirit of unity
within the school. An open house for the fresh-
men, the annual Engineer’s Week activities, and
the introduction of the University’s School of
Engineering to various high schools and Pitts-
burgh area campuses are the major responsibility
of the Cabinet. A bi—weekly publication, the
E 8c M Bulletin is printed by the Cabinet to
inform the students of the activities in the
School of Engineering. Each year the Cabinet
honors the outstanding senior in each depart-
ment at the annual banquet.

Men’s Glee Club

The Men’s Glee Club is the oldest organization on
Pitt’s campus, celebrating its 75th anniversary last
year. This group is not only the oldest on campus, but
one of the most active. The men performed at the
Vice-Chancellor’s reception, and for the Pittsburgh
Rotary Club. Concerts have been conducted at schools
such as Muhlenburg College and Harkem Junior, and
the college annual tour will include Girard College,
Bowling Green University and Wilson College.

As in years past, the Glee Club presented a beneﬁt
concert before which members prepared dinner for the
Visiting girls choir. This year membership increased to
ﬁfty non-music major singers. Phillip Cavanaugh is
the new director of the Glee Club. The group’s
repertoire includes classical compositions, folk songs,
and novelettes, all of which are presented with the
same enthusiasm and excellent quality, generating in
the audience this same enthusiasm.

Men’s Council

Men’s Council is mainly responsible for
sponsoring and organizing the men’s
Freshman Council. Through the fresh-
man representatives, the Council aids in
introducing new students to the college
campus. Members need possess only a
willingness and interest in serving fel-
low students and the University. The
Council co-sponsors the fall trimester
Activities Fair and holds dinners and
parties for transfer students. Men’s
Council is also responsible for func-
tions during the summer orientation ses-
sions for prospective freshmen. The
Council has a program of speakers, lec-
tures and activities to acquaint students
with their new environment.

l\/len’s Dormitory Council, ﬁrst organ-
ized when the Towers were occupied
four years ago, is a representative body
of male students elected from the various
dormitory houses. Being a governing
and programing body, the Council
establishes and revises the social rules
which are effected in the Towers. They
have successfully initiated a dry clean
ing and laundry service for student and
faculty use. The Council has expanded
its cultural program to include speakers
and forums and has enlarged the scope
of its social program. In addition, the
spirit within the house has been in-
creased by the expansion of the athletic
program to include virtually all intra-
mural sports. The Dorrnitory Council
has established the House Achievement
Award to be given on a point system
basis, to the donnitory house which has
participated in Various activities and
has promoted enthusiasm and support
within the dormitory as well as within
the school.

Pharmacy IFC is the coordinating body
of the ﬁve pharmaceutical societies in
the School. These societies include three
fraternities, Kappa Psi, Phi Delta Chi,
Alpha Beta Omega; one sorority, Lambda
Sigma; and one honorary, Rho Chi. The
IFC functions to correlate the activities
of the various groups. The IFC in con-
junction with the societies sponsors an
open house in November at the School
of Pharmacy. Here the faculty and stu-
dents greet the pre-pharmacy students
and acquaint them with the School.

More than ﬁfty percent of the students
in the School are members of one of the
societies. A Q.P.A. of 2.25 is a require-
ment. One delegate from each of the
groups makes up the Council.

To counteract the growth of the liberal-
thinking outspoken minority a group of
daring male students formed the Admin-
istrative Lackies and Rubber Stampers
Organization. “Our purpose is to insure
the maintenance of the status quo and
to serve as a roadblock to progress,” said
a group spokesman. Among the group’s
programs for the year was a tea for the
entire Dean of Women’s staff held at the
Pittsburgh Chapter of the Daughter’s of
the American Revolution and a potted
plant carrying party where the Alarsoites
transferred twenty-ﬁve potted plants
from Phipps Conservatory to the Dean
of Student Affairs Office. Alarso spon-
sored a sit-in at the Student Government
trimester questionnaire, explaining that
it was unnecessary since administrative
dogma should prevail.

Ski Club

The members of Pitt Ski Club are over one—hundred enthusi-
astic “shussboomers” and would-be-skiers. The club is open to
all interested students, faculty members, and alumni of the
University. Emphasizing safety on the slopes, members provide
novices with instruction on the trips to Laurel Mountain,
Hidden Valley or Blue Knob. An annual week-end at Blue
Knob has become a club tradition. When the slopes are bare,
the club journeys to North Park where members take to the
ice for an evening of skating, dancing, and roasting wieners.
On Tuesday evenings, the club meets in the Student Union to
View ski movies, listen to lectures on various aspects of skiing
and plan upcoming trips. The club sponsors bus trips to the
slopes which are open to the entire University community.

Student Government

‘ Student Government attempts to express student opinion,

provide a clear channel of communication among students,
faculty and administration, and generally serve the interests
of the student body.

Working with the administration SG helps orient incoming
freshmen to the University through Pitt Preview, the Orienta-
tion Weekend, and Freshmen Outing. SG also conducts the
book exchange which enables students to cut some money off
their usually enormous book bills. The student directory, also
under SG, sold every available copy it had printed this year.
Parents Weekend, Homecoming, and Tap Day are some of

the events sponsored by Student Government. With the enact-
ment of the allocation fee SG has assumed the responsibility
of appropriating the money. SG chooses the four members
of the Allocation’s Committee and makes ﬁnal approval on
all requests for funds. In an effort to eliminate overlap and
repetition of events, the SG Calendar Committee works with
other student organizations in the planning of their programs.
In the Fall a referendum will be brought before the student
body for a new constitution, including such innovations as
the University Review Board, . . . President’s Council, and in-
creased representation for other student organizations.

Student Union Board is a student-staff organization
which presents a wide variety of programs for the
cultural, educational, and social interests of the
Union community. Throughout the eight years of
its functioning, the Board has introduced well-
known authors, artists, critics, and lecturers to the
University. Through its various committees, the
Board has also sponsored dances, contests, such as
the Trivia Contest this year, and the Friday night
ﬁlm series. During the football season, the Board
arranges for trips to away football games, and in
the summer sponsors a trip to Europe. This year
the Board was revamped, organizing the many com-
mittees under more encompassing heads. The Board
is a vital part of the University; it is responsible
for a large part of the extracurricular activities on
campus.

Cwens, a national organization, was founded at Pitt in 1922. Cwens taps freshmen women
with a Q.P.A. of 3.0 or higher. These girls not only have shown interest in freshman orien-
tation activities, but also have displayed leadership potential. At the Founders’ Day Dinner,
Vice-Chancellor Rush spoke with the members about Pitt’s ﬁrst Dean of Women and founder
of Cwens, Thyrsa Amos. Several University students spoke to the members about traveling
abroad during the summer and of the many opportunities for undergraduates to study in
Europe. This year Cwens initiated a tutoring program for women._Cwens also assisted with
Freshman Orientation, Convocations, and the Student Government Elections.

Druids is an honorary leadership fraternity
which recognizes sophomore and ﬁrst term
junior men for their outstanding achieve-
ment in student activities and scholarship.
The attempt is made to select only those
men who have demonstrated both the ca-
pacity for constructive and effective leader-
ship and the ability to maintain a com-
petent academic record. The Delta Chapter
of the University of Pittsburgh celebrated
its ﬁftieth anniversary this year. Dr. David
Kurtzman, Acting Chancellor, addressed the
group at the anniversary dinner. At that
time a large Druid key, suitable for outdoor
display was dedicated to the memory of Dr.
Stanton C. Crawford who was to have been
initiated as this year’s winter tapee. Dr.
Crawford epitomized the ideals of leader-
ship, scholarship, service and character
which Druids seeks to propagate among
undergraduate men at Pitt. The Druid
chapter includes many outstanding mem-
bers of the faculty and administration.

Eta Kappa Nu

Pictured left to

Eta Kappa Nu, national electrical engineering honorary, was
founded in 1904. The purposes of the organization are to pro-
mote andreward scholarship and to provide leadership in the
electrical engineering departments. Pitt’s Beta Delta chapter
initiated the annual faculty evaluation through the distribu-
tion of questionnaires to students in the engineering depart-
ment. An award is then given to the most outstanding new
professor. In order to reach a greater number of students, Eta
Kappa Nu has expanded its tutoring program. The /society
taps men from the top third of the senior class and the top
fourth of the junior class twice a year. Membership is based
on leadership, scholarship, and class standing. The magazine
Bridge keeps members informed of local and national
activities.

Kappa Kappa Psi

It would seem strange to attend a football game with-
out the strutting double—time march of the band. Here
at Pitt, as elsewhere, the rank and ﬁle emit a few
who excel in their ability to play. These men consti-
tute the members of Kappa,Kappa Psi. Members are
tapped from the three University bands——Marching,
Concert, and Panther. All is not hot summer days of
drill and drizzly marches in the late September rain.
Weekly meetings in the back room of Gustines, held
the year round, ease the weary marching legs. Kappa
Kappa Psi treats visiting bandsmen to cider and
doughnuts during football games and sponsors a
reception for parents during Parents Weekend.

The Institute of Electrical and Electronic
Engineers was founded in 1884 for “the ad-
vancement of the theory and practice of elec-
trical engineering and the allied arts and
sciences, and for the maintenance of high tech-
nical and ethical standards among its mem-
bers.” From an organization of twenty-ﬁve
members in 1884, it has grown to a member-
ship of over 150,000. The Institute isgnow the
largest engineering society in the world. Stu-
dents registered in electrical engineering or
the allied arts and sciences such as chemistry,
physics, and math, and who carry a full aca-
demic load are eligible for membership. Bi-
weekly meetings are held to discuss business
transactions of the Institute and also to enter-
tain guest speakers. The “IEEE Blast,” an
annual social affair, was held at the Castle
Inn. Dr. Andrew W. Revay, ]r., Associate Re-
search Professor of Electrical Engineering at
the University of Pittsburgh, has been the
student advisor for the past year.

Quax

Quax, the women's science honorary, was es-
tablished to create interest in general science
among its members, to foster among them a
spirit of good fellowship, and to create an
interest in science among the student body.
To become eligible for membership in Quax,
a woman must have completed three terms
and have earned at least nine credits in her
major science. She must also have an overall
B average. For the ﬁrst time Quax tapped
women from the School of Nursing, tapping
a total of forty-ﬁve women.

Quax also sponsored several lectures on
scientiﬁc topics and in February initiated a
day-long career symposium. Some of the fea-
tured speakers were Lucille Crozier, who
spoke on “Participating in Civic Activities.”
Careers in medicine and nursing were treated
by Dr. Rita. Nealon and Dr. Lucie Young, re-
spectively. Dr. Phyllis Martin discussed
“Teaching On the Higher Educational Lev-
el.” The symposium was such a success that
Quax anticipates making it an annual event.

Mortar Board, the national hon-
or society for senior women, was
founded in 1918. Its 40,000 mem-
bers are in 112 chapters on cam-
puses throughout the country.
The speciﬁc purposes of this
honorary are to foster leader-
ship, scholarship, and service
through the women of the Uni-
versity best qualiﬁed to accom-
plish these aims. The meetings
of Mortar Board are a time
when the girls discuss many top-
ics from civil rights to alumni
association activities. In consid-
ering prospective members, the
women look for scholastic
achievement, leadership ability
and a true willingness to serve
the University. Mortar Board
recognizes diversiﬁed excellence.
Throughout the year, guest
speakers attend meetings. A tea
for junior women is held an-
nually and a symposium for
women was jointly sponsored
with Quax.

Quo Vadis is the organization of student hostesses of Pitt’s
famous nationality rooms and Heinz Chapel. The honorary
attempts to create student participation and public opinion
sympathetic with the ideals symbolized in the classrooms.
This year, Quo Vadis interpreted the rooms to many
foreign visitors, including the Irish Ambassador. Sir Patrick
Dean, British Ambassador to the United States, ofﬁcially
presented the archives of the English Room to the Univer-
sity in February. Quo Vadis members served as aides at the
ceremony. Ruth Crawford Mitchell, who had a great part
in carrying out Dr. Bowman’s ideas for the nationality
rooms, and Mrs. Bruhns, of the Olﬁce of Cultural and Edu-
cational Exchange, spoke with the group. Marsha Rehns
and Carolynn Shaw received hostess awards which will
enable them to study and travel in Europe this summer.

Omicron Delta Kappa

In June, 1916, the Gamma Circle of Omicron Delta
Kappa, a men’s national honorary,'was established at
Pitt. For ﬁfty years it has succeeded in bringing together
faculty members, and junior and senior men who repre-
sent all phases of collegiate life. Endeavoring to recog-
nize all-round leadership, O.D.K. taps men twice a year
for their outstanding achievement in areas of scholarship,
athletics, theater arts, publications and religious affairs.
Professors who have exhibited the same attributes are
invited to join along with the students. At their bi-
monthly meetings, members hear guest speakers from the
University or community and then discuss the topics.
Alumni are greeted by current members at the annual
Founders’ Day Dinner. Each year a graduating senior
who excelled in scholarship and service is chosen as
“The Man of the Year.”

Sigma Tau

Sigma Tau is a national honorary recognizing junior
and senior men with a QPA of 3.0 or above, in the
School of Engineering and Mines. The recommendation
of at least one member of the engineering faculty is also
necessary. The purpose of the honorary is to recognize
outstanding achievement in engineering and to promote
scholarship and engineering ethics. Each year the chapter
awards the sophomore who had the highest QPA in his
freshmen class. This year Sigma Tau conducted a student
evaluation of the faculty in the engineering school. The
Sigma Tau pyramid will be placed in front of the new
engineering building.

A year ago a plexiglas-
enclosed model was displayed
prominently on the Cathedral’s
first ﬂoor. Miniature buildings
of wood depicted the Oakland
of the future. Panther Hollow
had a multitude of the tiny
structures surrounded by
artiﬁcial grass. Forbes

Field showed its ugly super-
structure no more as a quad-
rangle of professional build-
ings took its place. Two

more towers bordered Forbes
Avenue, Hillman Library was
complete, and the Benedum—
endowed Engineering building
held a prominent spot in the
plexiglas and wood utopia.
Now a glowing ﬁre burns in an
incinerator and in that glow-
ing ﬁre there burns a heap

of little wooden buildings.
Litchﬁeld’s utopia has become
the prophecy that failed.
Construction has slowed its
once vigorous pace to the
sporadic erection of a few
buildings. There are no longer
newspaper headlines about the
Oakland Corporation and
Oaklandites no longer chastize
the University for trying to
improve their slum. Oakland
remains safe, secure from the
threat of more intellectuals.

Yet, irony presents itself with
the increased state—afﬁliation.
While Pittsburghers will be
able to send increasing
numbers of their offspring to
Pitt at lower costs, they will
inevitably have to sacriﬁce
Oakland. State afﬁliation
means easier acquisition of
land with the state’s right of
eminent domain paving the
way to an increased boom in
construction. Pitt the
behemoth will soon rise again.
The little wooden buildings
will soon stand in a new
arrangement with artiﬁcial
green grass and money to make
them concrete and steel
realities.

Publications

 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  

The fourth ﬂoor of Schenley Hall is the
home of publications and the home away
from home for many students. Working
between classes or at night, these students
put together publications which interest
the entire University community. The
Pitt News publishes campus and national
news, the OWL critiques the year, the
Polaris introduces the freshmen to the
University, the Pitt Capsule and the Sky-
scraper Engineer offer specialized infor-
mation to the professional student while
Ideas and Figures experiments with cre-
ative and artistic materials.

The fourth ﬂoor was especially close
this year. Publications shared personnel,
copy paper, parties, banquets, and prob-
lems. OWL people could quite often be
found in Pitt News’ offices, and Pitt News
staff members in the Skyscraper or OWL
offices. Deadline nights and Friday after-
noons often evolved into open-end dis-
cussions concerning editoirials, Student
Government, or the Administration. Yet
touch football in the hall proved to be
as popular as ever as Well as the new
coke machine.

While lights on the fourth ﬂoor of Schenley Hall
burned late three nights a week and the following
day’s classes and examinations were forgotten, a
few students pounded away on typewriters and ﬁll-
ed pages of The Pitt News with editorial comment,
advertisements, sports, and local, national, and in-
ternational news. “One of‘ America’s great student
newspapers,” under editor William Cabin, was in
the process of formulating opinions on such im-
portant campus issues as Student Government, the
ﬁnancial crisis, state-relatedness, academic freedom
and the search for a chancellor.

The Pitt News led controversy when the edito-
rials stated that Student Government should legis-
late and recommend issues to faculty, administra-
tors and the Board of Trustees rather than be an
independent and unrelated voice of the students.
The newspaper also called for increased state-relat-
edness with lower tuition without injury to aca-
demic standard and without enlarged classes. Call-
ing for Michelosen’s resignation stirred many opin-
ions but the University’s athletic department con-
curred with the plea and appointed Dave Hart.
No matter what the issue The Pitt News succeeded
in stimulating both violent and favorable campus
discussion and debate.

Pitt Capsule

The Pitt Capsule is a stu-
dent magazine published
three times a year by mem-
bers of the Student Branch
of the American Pharma-
ceutical Association of the
University. To fulﬁll its
purpose to report and sup-
plement the professional
interest being developed in
the School of Pharmacy, the
magazine includes many di-
versiﬁed features. Articles
of a purely professional na-
ture which deal with a wide
variety of topics are inter-
spersed among advertise-
ments from national drug
companies. Descriptions of
new drugs and reports from
pharmaceutical conventions
are found in the magazine.
Special attention is also de-
voted to class happenings
and news within the School
of Pharmacy.

In spite of difficulties with printers and
ﬁnances, Ideas and Figures came out in Feb-
ruary this year. The issue was a combined
Fall-Winter magazine, jointly edited by
Ross Danielson and Michael Tinker. The
magazine has sponsored several coffee hours
with members of the English faculty which
have proved interesting in spite of sparse
attendance. In October Ideas and Figures
hosted 120 high school students at its poetry
and short story clinic. The students received
an opportunity to hear lectures on various
literary topics. In addition they were able
to discuss their own work with Ideas and
Figures staff members in informal work-
shops. During the winter trimester the mag-
azine sponsored a series of “cinema orgies,”
which have proven popular with the stu-
dent body.

The Polaris serves the University
community in a number of ca-
pacities. The pictures of the in-
coming freshman class are espe-
cially valuable to male students
in ﬁnding out the name of that
new frosh girl. Descriptions of
almost all student organizations
help orient both new and old
students to campus activities. A
listing of chief administrative
personnel, names and addresses
of Greek organizations, and ina-
jor events of the campus year are
also included. The Polaris calen-
dar provides its buyer with a
place to note his exam schedule
and other necessary reminders.
Also, it perhaps is the only place
where one can ﬁnd a listing of
the words to the University
Chant. The Polaris suffered
some competition from the Stu-
dent Directory, which duplicates
some information. However, this
year’s sales were the most suc-
cessful for the publication.

Skyscraper Engineer is the offi-
cial undergraduate’ publication
for the School of Engineering.
Published six times a year, the
magazine provides students the
opportunity to write articles of
a technical nature, such as “Plas-
tic Analysis in High-Rise Struc-
tures.” News in the Engineering
School is also covered. This year
a section was devoted to the
plans for the new engineering
complex on O’Hara Street. Usual
features include “Slips of the
Sticks,” a sampling of jokes with
special appeal to engineers, and
the “Techni-Cutie of the Month,”
which is viewed enthusiastically
by the male engineering students.
Under editor Walter Arnheim, a
special parody issue was pub-
lished. It was accepted as one of
the most humorous publications
in a long time.

WPGH

W'PGH is the student-run radio station of the
University. Broadcasting solely within the cam-
pus, the station operates sixty hours per week.
The entertainment revolves around the individ-
ual personalities of the disc jockeys. Most of all
types of music are represented catering to a
broad spectrum of interests.

The station maintains a large news organiza-
tion which compiles and reports campus, na-
tional and international news with the help of
U.P.I. The staff presents interviews with person-
alities discussing matters of special interest. Oc-
casionally editorials are delivered. WPGH
covered the controversy over the Allocations
Fund committee and later offered special cover-
age of the Student Government elections.

Irving N. Rothman

Freedom is not the norm governing student pub-
lications in most colleges. This University has
had the unique privilege of having a philosophy
of “no censorship” in both the editorial and
business areas of all publications. Students have
always been given the ultimate decision-making
power with the advisor primarily as a consultant
to the publications.

Irving N. Rothman was a primary force sus-
taining this philosophy the past ﬁve years. He
always defended the right of the students to
decide what to print and how to print it regard-
less of whom the article dealt with. His support
buttressed the efforts of all student publications
people in making independent decisions and im-
plementing creative and progressive approaches.
His leaving was a great loss to the Fourth Floor.

Not only did Mr. Rothman give impetus to
the development of mature students allowing
them to learn the nature and limits of respon-
sibility, but he instituted new programs in the
Ofﬁce of Student Publications. He helped estab-
lish the High School Publications Institute, de-
veloped the photography clinic, and encouraged
the development of independent publications.

In a large university, such as Pitt, a
student often feels lost in the masses
that crowd the halls. For many stu-
dents a social fraternity or sorority
provides an answer to this sense of
loneliness. To the outsider, the Greek
system is symbolized by the Tuck
shop, Greek decals on the back of a
Triumph, or the Luna after Monday
night meetings. But to the Greek,
membership means much more. It is
warmth, friendship, the sharing of
happiness and sorrow with someone
who will understand. Greeks also con-
tribute in many ways to the entire
University community. The chairmen
of Orientation, Homecoming, and
Parents Weekend are quite often
members of a Greek social organiza-
tion. The absence of ﬂoats at this
year’s Homecoming illustrates the ne-
cessity of Greek participation in a
University event to make it a com-
plete success. In an effort to bring
entertainment to the campus, Greeks
co-sponsored the appearance of the
Serendipity Singers, which unfortu-
nately was not a ﬁnancial success.

Intrafraternity
Council

BELOW: C. Kohn, P. Enwright, K. Fred-
erick, ]. Smith, C. Prussin, R. Bruni, L.
Kinter, R. Snyder.

The function of the Interfraternity Council is to
regulate and supervise activities, such as rush,
which involve the entire fraternity system. A broad
intramural athletic program is maintained by I.F.C.
for member fraternities. This program is directed
by the physical education department. The Council
sponsors the I.F.C. Ball, usually held in October
or November. Greek Week, held in the Spring,
is co—sponsored with the Pan-Hellenic Council.
Activities during the week-long celebration include
leadership training seminars, the All-Greek Dinner,
the Greek Week Ball, at service project, and of
course Greek Sing. This year two members were
admitted to I.F.C., Delta Iota Delta and Lambda
Sigma Rho. The Council, one of the seven major
student organizations on campus, is a service not
only to its member groups, but also to the com-
munity. In the past, I.F.C. has done much volunteer
work for the Pittsburgh Symphony.

Delta Iota Delta

From the traditional Back—to-School Blast to the
Spring Picnic, the year proved to be one of the best
yet for the DID’s. The Chapter joined I.F.C., took
second place in the Homecoming banner contest, and
two ﬁne pledge classes were initiated. The Halloween
Party, Winter Weekend, and Greek Week helped to
round out the social calendar. In addition, the house
was painted, and a pool table was acquired for the
Game Room.

The Chapter participated in a well-rounded ath-
letic program and took awards in several intramural
events. Many Brothers were also active on the var-
sity baseball, soccer, and wrestling teams.

By placing great emphasis on the academic life,
Delta Iota Delta again produced one of the finest
averages on the Pitt campus. Many Brothers were
tapped into honorary fraternities and still more made
the Dean’s List. DID’s were also active in the Pitt
Players, the Skyscraper Engineer, Student Govern-
ment, Engineering Cabinet, and Pitt Preview. The
traditional weekly visits to Saint Anthony’s School
for Exceptional Children were also continued.

In keeping with the Delt balance

of activties and scholarship,
   events relating to both the social
pleasures and to the academe
have found their way into the
customs at 4712 Bayard Street.
Going beyond the standard kegs
and combo on Saturday nights,
the fraternity’s social schedule
included the annual fall formal,
the Delt winter weekend, and
the New Year’s Eve affair which
attracts members from Maine to
California. Shifting to the more
serious aspects of college life, the
rising emphasis on grades has
been matched by Delts with the
establishment of scholastic prizes,
providing monetary awards to
those actives and pledges with
the highest marks. Preparation
for life is stressed as well as
preparation for party.

Delta Sigma Phi

The 1965-66 academic year has found the brothers of Delta
Sigma Phi engaged in every type of campus activity. We had

i starters in varsity football, soccer, swimming, baseball, and

basketball, as Well as brothers active in Student Government,
I. F. C., and other student organizations. The fraternity worked
together with great spirit in intrafraternity sports, coping a
second in basketball; and also Greek Week, winning Fun
Night. One of our brothers, Jim Smith, was Greek Week co-
chairman and was also named Mr. Fraternity and to the OWL
Hall of Fame. Although we kept up a fast paced social sched-
ule, We also devoted our time to a community project, a Christ-

mas party for the children from the School for the Blind.
This year we also celebrated the 50th Anniversary of our
chapter’s establishment on the Pitt campus. A special Alumni
Dinner was held at the Viking Motel, and later in the year
the Founder’s Day Banquet, featuring Dean McGibbeny, was
held at Omar Khayyam’s. The outside of the house was re-
modeled and painted, and new stainless steel letters were put
up. With two great pledge classes and small graduation losses,
we’ll be carrying on the progressive spirit and expectation
for a successful year. We also wish success to our graduating
brothers who have made this year such a great one.

As one of the newest members of the Interfraternity Council,
Lambda Sigma Rho proved its value to the Greek system at
Pitt through its enthusiastic participation in campus activities.
The Lambda Sig social calendar is always full with “jammies,”
dinners, and theater parties. The chapter’s many activities in-
clude participation in intramural sports, such as football, soft-
ball, and basketball. Lambda Sig also took part in the Spirit
Award competition-this year. As in 1964 and 1965, the fraternity
won first prize at the Winter Weekend Carnival. Lambda Sig
was founded in 1961 at the University of Pittsburgh’s Johnstown
Campus. In 1963 the Beta Chapter was established at the Oak-
land Campus. Gamma Chapter was formed the same year at
Jersey City College, New Jersey. Thus, Lambda Sigma Rho is
looking toward future growth nationally as well as on Pitt’s
campus. ’

Zeta Beta Tau

The Kappa Nu Xi chapter of Zeta Beta Tau again showed
its academic, social, and fraternal strength. Meeting one of
the largest rushes in Pitt’s history, the chapter took over
thirty men in the fall pledge class. Indicative of its rapid
growth, Zeta Beta Tau has more than quadrupled its size
from only one year ago.

On campus, three members were tapped into the sopho-
more men’s honorary, Druids, and the Druids Man of the
Year was also a Zeeb. Among Zeta Beta Tau’s prime campus
leadership positions were the new editor of the Pitt News, a
student government senator, and the junior representative
to Men’s Council. Top in athletics, Zeta Beta Tau led the
intramural League B throughout the academic year. The
brothers rounded out their activities with a broad social
program, ranging from formal champagne suppers to beer
blast toga parties. With its increased membership, Z.B.T. is
looking forward to another successful year.

Phi Ep started this year almost as well as we
ﬁnished. At the National Convention in late
August we were cited for having placed first
on our campus in scholarship. As rush came
and went, we again took the largest pledge
class on campus, raising our potential Fratre

J  membership to over one hundred brothers. In
the sport’s category we continued our winning
ways: first in football, softball, volleyball, bas-
ketball, and track, with seconds in every other
sport except swimming. For the second straight
year we won the all—sport trophy. Greek Week
was all ours this year. We won the chariot
race and placed second in fun night and Greek
Sing, giving us the All Greek Week award. Phi
Ep was active in the community and campus
also. Our pledge class did a project at the
School for the Blind, and the whole fraternity
supported the student body in the pro-
Vietnam display. It has been both a very
diversiﬁed yet successful year.

 

A successful fall rush was the ﬁrst hint
of another good year for Phi Gamma
Delta. The Fiji social schedule was as
full as possible. A reception for graduate
brothers was held after the Homecoming
game with Notre Dame. Two bands, one
for the brothers and one for the parents,
were featured. Brothers also entertained
their parents at two buffet dinners, one
each trimester. Each month Fijis had at
least two parties for brothers and pledges.
At each of the mixers held with Pitt’s
sororities, a band or combo perfonned.
Phi Gamma Delta was also active in the
intramural League B. However, Figis
realize that fraternities do not exist for
social reasons only. As their major proj-
ect for the year, Phi Gams held an
Orphan’s Party before Valentines Day.
Along with the sisters of Kappa Kappa
Gamma, the Figis entertained the chil-
dren for an afternoon. Phi Gamma Delta
can look back on a happy year, with
success in academic and social areas.

The Gamma Sigma chapter of Pi
Kappa Alpha came to the University
of Pittsburgh in 1934. The national
social fraternity was founded at the
University of Virginia in 1868. The
aim of the Pika’s is to foster fellow-
ship and scholarship by upholding
common ideals.

Social events this year included
a Roaring Twenties Party, a Ha-
waiian Party, and frequent tea
dances highlighted by the Dream
Girl Formal. However, free entertain-
ment was provided‘ by watching the
Kappas and Thetas across the street.
Defending all-interfraternity cham-
pions, the Pika’s had another good
year, copping a ﬁrst place in wres-
tling and softball and second place
in basketball and swimming.

Academically the Pika’s had the
highest Pledge Class average and also
won the National Scholarship Im-
provement Award. In February the
Chapter hosted a district Pi Kappa
Alpha convention.

Pi Lambda Phi

The year 1965-66 was another year that Pi
Lambda Phi Fraternity retained its position
of uniqueness on campus. Topping 0H? a
highly competitive, but fruitful rush, with
their Twelfth Annual Park Schenley Din-
ner, the Pi Lams were set to embark on a
great year with the largest pledge class in
its history. The many and various events
of the fall term were highlighted by im-
pressive athletic victories and unusual and
enjoyable social events such as the Play-
house affair featuring Tartuﬁe.

As outstanding as the fall trimester was,
the winter term was that much better. Be-
ginning with an indescribable Winter
Weekend at Mont Chateau in West Vir-
ginia, the social calendar was ﬁlled in by
campus TGIF’s, an Alumni Stag at the
Hollywood Social Club, and the annual
Senior Banquet. Pi Lam was also active in
intramural sports. All this was culminated,
though, when Pi Lambda Phi was awarded
the First Place Greek Week trophy. With
this success, Pi Lam looks forward to an
even better next year.

Sigma Alpha Mu

The year 1965-66 began well as Sigma Alpha Mu took
thirty-ﬁve pledges, one of the largest and best classes
on campus. During the year the brothers were second
in scholarship and Robert Guzinsky was awarded the
Outstanding Athlete of SAM National Fraternity.
Once again the Sammies placed high in Greek Sing
competition as well as in the overall trophy competi-
tion. Its social calendar, which included a winter
weekend and a magniﬁcent formal, was a great suc-
cess, as was parents weekend and the annual charity
drive.

For the first time several brothers have dis-
tinguished themselves in various campus activities.
Bob Guzinsky, Howard Heit, and Marc Mallinger
performed well on the gridiron. Irwin Inguer and
Gerry Rozen were tapped into the pre-med honorary.
Jimmy Meyerson was I.F.C. social chairman, as well
as overall chairman for Pitt’s 1965 Homecoming
weekend. He was tapped into Omega, an honorary
leadership fraternity.

As Frank says, “It was a very good
year” in ’65-’66 for the Sigs at Pitt.
Sigma Chi achieved even higher levels
in scholastics, athletics, activities,
house improvement, and of course
brotherhood. Bolstered by the highest
fall pledge class average Beta Theta
Chapter’s Q.P.A. continued rising as
the house became more scholastic-
rninded. The Sigma Chis, who boast
many athletes in all varsity sports,
spurred their drive on the All-Sports
Trophy with a first in badminton, sec-
ond in football, and a third in ping-
pong. The Sigs have gotten full use of
their bar with Friday afternoon mix-
ers with Pitt sororities and, of course,
with their weekly Saturday night
parties. Sigma Chi’s sixty-seven broth-
ers and ten pledges are integral parts
in Pitt organizations. From the presi-
dencyof Student Government to disc
jockeys on WPGH, from Phi Beta
Kappa to Pitt Preview and HEP, the
brothers are all leaders on campus.

' ‘ The Panhellenic Council is the coordi-
  nating and governing body for all na-
tionally afﬁliated women’s fraternities at
the University. Its purposes are to maintain
the high caliber of sorority life, to promote
successful inter—fraternity relationships, to
further sound scholarship and to cooperate
with the University administration and
other organizations in matters related to
sorority activities. The Council consists of
the president and one elected delegate from
each women’s fraternity. Ideas and prob-
lems concerning rush, open houses, and
philanthropic projects are discussed by the
Council, and with the help of each sorority,
policies are adopted. In the fall, Panhel
sponsors the Panhellenic Preview to intro-,
duce freshmen and transfer women students
to the sorority system at Pitt. The Council
also publishes a Rush Booklet for freshmen
which contains all rushing regulations. The
two highlights of the social calendar are the
Panhel Ball which honors the new pledges
and Greek Week which is co—sponsored with
the Inter-Fraternity Council. Panhel elec-
tions are held in the winter trimester.

Alpha Epsilon Phi

The Nu chapter of Alpha Epsilon Phi has had a
busy year. The fall trimester began with a rush picnic
luncheon with Pi Lambda Phi fraternity. After get-
ting ﬁve pledges, Alpha Epsilon Phi had a fall dance
on the Gateway Clipper and two “TGIFS”, one with
Sigma Chi and the other with Delta Sigma Phi. The
winter trimester began with making a movie of
AEPhis at Pitt and eighteen great pledges. Our winter
affair, a dinner-dance, was held at the LaMo~nt. The
charity project for the winter was an Easter party at
the Hillman Center in the Hill District. Four sisters
were tapped at Tap Day ceremonies: Dorrie Brand as
Miss Pitt, Anne Kaufman and Michele Reicher to
Cwens, and Elana Katz an Amos award. Other win-
ter trimester activities included the Panhel Ball and
Greek Week. Although we’re sorry to see some sisters
leave upon graduation, we look forward with our
pledges to a successful year.

Alpha

Pi

189

Alpha Delta Pi is many things to its forty-two members. It is under-
standing, a growing chapter, and giving pledges an idea of what
sisterhood is by living it every day. Working together in planning
for rush, pledging, and the black and white formal are some of the
best things about being an ADPi. Little things too come from
sisterhood—funday, afternoons in the tuck shop, presidents and
maraschino Cherries, tea dances, Valentine Day parties, and an un-
limited supply of cigarettes. Greek Week, Founder’s Day, sweet-
hearts Joe and Nancy, happy unbirthday parties, offices in Cwens,
AWS, Panhel, WRA add still more dimension to membership, as
do big and little sisters, and Mrs. Monty. The diamond and the
clasped hands have a 110 year old tradition. The forty-two sisters
of ADPi believe that unity is the ﬁrst step toward sisterhood and
have pride not in themselves but in what they share.

 

Chi Omega

The password for the year was SPIRIT for the Chi
Omegas. It started with a get-together the ﬁrst week-
end of school and was upheld throughout the year.
A successful fall rush resulted in eleven enthusiastic
pledges. Chi Omega and Phi Kappa Theta won first
place in the Homecoming Banner Contest with the
theme “Pitt Towers Over Irish.” Winter Weekend was
another success for Chi O’s as they won the Ice Sculp-
turing Contest. Football, pep rallies, basketball, and
soccer were well-supported and Chi Omega was
awarded the Spirit Trophy for the year. Chi O’s rated
high scholastically and were active as mentors, senior
assistants, dormitory ofﬁcers, Cwens, and as members
of the Homecoming and Greek Week committees.
Chi 0 activities ranged from participation in Pan-
hellenic Council and Student Union Board to work
on the Pitt News and in Beta Beta Beta. Chi O’s
were especially proud when Nancy Fuchs was named
to the Owl Hall of Fame. Social activities included
teas, mixers, and a Dinner-Theater Party at the Play-
house. Chi O’s accompanied students from the School
for the Blind as their service project. Their year ended
with another great pledge class ready to carry on Chi
Omega ideals.

The sisters of Delta Delta Delta have had a
prosperous and fun packed year, high-
lighted by taking twenty new pledges. A
formal was held in December in honor of
the fall pledges. The affair was beautifully
set in the surroundings of Green Gables. At
this time the Delta Man of the Year was
honored; Dan Duffy was chosen for 1965-
66. Perhaps the most exciting event of the
year ,was being chosen to represent the
Polaroid Camera Company. To this eﬁort
we owe our new color television. The sisters
have found that working together has
added excitement and meaning to life.

In October, the chapter was host

puses in the area for Delta Zeta
State Day. Panel discussions were
conducted on topics such as
pledge training, rush, and serv-
ice projects. Dr. Leonard Elstad,
President of Gallaudet College,
was the guest speaker at the
luncheon which concluded the
program. Tea dances, the Hal-
loween Hayride, and the Spring
formal ﬁlled the chapter's social
calendar.

Kappa Alpha Theta

The sisters of Kappa Alpha Theta experienced
a most exciting and rewarding year in academic,
community, and social events. With six girls in
honoraries and eleven on the Dean’s List, Theta
continued to strive for improved scholarship. At
Christmas, the pledges held their annual party
for the students of the School for the Blind, and
several Thetas participated in HEP. Theta con-
tributed to the success of Homecoming as last
year’s Queen, Anne Coleman, served as co-chair-
man and Lin Perkins represented us as a Queen
ﬁnalist. In December Kappa Alpha Theta held
a dinner and theater party in honor of our Fall
pledge class and paused before ﬁnals to share
in a house Christmas Party. Winter trimester
ﬁlled the social schedule with the Panhellenic
Ball, Founder’s Day, Winter Weekend, Greek
Week, and our Winter formal to honor pledges
and graduating sisters. Greek Week was a special
success as we took a ﬁrst place in Greek Sing
with a rendition of “Wynken, Blynken and
Nod.” With rewarding memories we review the
year past and with anticipation await the Year
ahead.

OAKLAND—6 :00 a.m.
The snow hasn’t come yet. It
will be a late winter they say.
And as one walks slowly along
the debris-laden squares of
concrete a stiff, chilly

breeze swirls dust in monsoon-
like patterns——a Sahara of
Concrete. Streets are barren
except for the dust.
OAKLAND-—8 :00 a.m.

A neon sign sputters on. Ex-
haust fumes mix intimately
with the stiff, chilly breezes.

A baker delivers an order of
fresh1y—packaged buns. Coffee
grains mix with water—heat
comes—and the staff of
morning life perks slowly in
the narrow kitchens of Scotty’s,
the [Original, and the White
Tower.

O*AKLAND——l0:00 a.m.
The epitome of panic. Stu-
dents ﬁght vulturously for
parking spaces as meter maids
pull out their carbon-sheeted
pads and stalk their prey. A
circular How of student bodies
moves continuously between

the Towers, Student Union,
and Cathedral.
OAKLAND-—Midday.
Cokes, hamburgers, hot dogs
ﬂow endlessly from greasy
grill to empty stomach. Mobs
ﬁlter into the narrow lines

of the Tuck Shop and engulf
the dimly-lit Hunt Room.
Fraternity and sorority com-
rades gather for the annual
rite of noontime gab sessions.
Education takes a pause for
nourishment.
OAKLAND-2 :00 p.m.
Class. Coke. Library. Tuck

OAKLAND-—Night.

From the unknown cracks and 4

crevices of dingy apartment
houses the night people
emerge. Drunkards wind their
way in and out of Gustine’s,
Oakland Cafe, Coyne’s. High
school dropouts standing on
street corners add color to the
unending string of small shops
and neon signs. College
students, the elite, enter
sporadically to do ﬁeld work
in this anthropological entity.
A pick up, an illegal drink,

a football pool.

Kappa Kappa Gamma

The golden key, the fleur—de-lis, and the two shades of blue
have long been the external symbols of Kappa Kappa
Gamma, but the closeness and the friendship that is more
than friendship, is perhaps the most important aspect of
the group. Throughout the year one can see signs of this
spirit of sisterhood in their ability to work and relax to-
gether. Through such activities as Homecoming, Greek
Week, Formal Rush, and their Valentine's Day Party for
orphans, Kappa grows in spirit for the group as well as
the University. Kappa takes pride in her scholars, queens,
and actives on campus. The true spirit of the Kappas is
exempliﬁed in one of their songs——“There’s a friendship
there beyond compare in every one you see . . .”

Phi Sigma Sigma

The Phi Sigs enjoyed two busy and fun-ﬁlled tri-
mesters during 1965-66. Highlights included a scholar-
ship dessert, at which Dr. Alan Pollack spoke on stu-
dent life in Sweden, Israel, and Russia, and special ice
cream sundaes for the girls with the highest quality
point averages. Social events included a mixer with
the freshman medical class and a dinner dance at the
LeMont. Phi..Sigs spent an afternoon with under-
privileged children, touring Carnegie Museum and
other Oakland points of interest. Academics also are
important, and this year we were awarded the Pan-
hellenic Scholarship Award. Greek Week was espe-
cially successful, as Adrinne Sanza was crowned Greek
Week Queen. As the winter trimester drew to a close
we welcomed our new sisters and bade farewell to the
seniors on Senior Night with the senior “Ship of
Fools.”

sorority events. SDT placed second in
the all—sorority scholarship competition
and captured third place in the Annual
UMOC contest. Active Sig Delts include
officers of A.W.S., Cwens, Holland Hall,
Women’s Choral, the chairman of Pitt
Preview, and the Sweetheart of Sigma
Alpha Mu Fraternity. SDT’s contribute
to community service by teaching chil-
dren at the Allegheny County Juvenile
Court.

Sig Delt’s chapter activities included
successful rush, the Fall dinner dance
to honor pledges, mixers, and guest
speakers.

With the joys of this year came a
moment of sadness with the passing of
their housemother, Mrs. Schmitt. Her
many kindnesses will long remain in the
memories of the girls who wear the torch
pin at Pitt.

Theta Phi Alpha

 

Election spirit ran high with Theta Phi
Alpha this year as two sisters were
elected President and Secretary of Pan-
hellenic Council. This was just one of
the highlights of an active social and
scholastic year. Social activities ranged
from a picnic at Dianne’s summer home
to mixers with fraternities both on cam-
pus and at Carnegie Tech and Du-
quesne. Working with Delta Iota Delta
fraternity Theta Phi won second place
in the Homecoming Banner Contest.
Theta Phis take part in many campus
activities including the Mentor pro-
gram, Serior Assistantships, the Pitt
News and Associated Women Students.
Sisters are members of several honor-
aries, such as Pi Delta Epsilon, Quax,
Beta Beta Beta, and Phi Beta Kappa.
Among their varied service projects this
year were a Doll Party for orphans at
Christmas and a Visit to Children’s Hos-
pital on Valentine’s Day. With the elec-
tion of new oﬂicers in February and a
successful fall and winter rush and
Greek Week, Theta Phi Alpha looks
forward to another wonderful year.

Football

The 1965 football season was the year of the Big Score——for the
Panthers opponents. The ﬁne passing of Kenny Lucas to ﬂanker
Eric Crabtree and split ends Mike Rosborough and Bob Longo gave
Pitt one of the nation's most explosive scoring threats. But, too
often the opposing team provided the ﬁreworks as Pitt was out-
scored and out-defensed by well-coached squads.

Most pre-season prognosticators predicted that the Jungle Cats
would win two of the ten games on their murderous schedule. To
Pitt fans, the personnel seemed equal to ﬁve of the opposition

teams, Oregon, Oklahoma, Duke, West Virginia, and Navy.
However, the Panthers managed to make experts of the nation-
al magazines as they ﬂubbed three games they could have won.

The season opener against Oregon left fans wondering. The
efficiency of the ground attack was shown on one series which
started on the Oregon four and ended on the twenty-ﬁve. The
defensive line played like three blind mice and the farmer’s
wife, allowing the Oregon quarterback time to brush his teeth
while picking apart the Panther secondary. Pitt’s halftime

lead did not have time to get comfortable on the scoreboard.
The second game was against Oklahoma, a team Pitt had
failed to beat in eight previous tries. This time the defensive
line held when it had to, as Lucas passed to a 139 victory.
Again, the Panthers failed to score three times within the
opposition twenty.

These two low scoring games were only seismic tremors
compared to the earthquake that was coming. Both Pitt and
West Virginia had defenses like touch football teams. West

Qiftéia

Virginia scored nine touchdowns to overcome the individual heroics of Crab-
tree and Lucas in the most exciting offensive contest since Daniel vs. the Lions.
Coming on the short end of the 63-48 ﬁasco, Pitt had little to roar about.

On national television next Saturday, Pitt opened the game with a 95 yard
touchdown drive, but then Duke got the ball. The Blue Devils moved to two
TDs on the same play, a down-and-out pass to the swing end. The strategy of
the Pitt secondary was a forceful tackle after the catch. The defensive line
spent the afternoon studying cloud formations as a steady stream of‘ rushers
poured through the once-impenetrable Pitt wall. The coaches declined to
use Crabtree to defend on the pass; he was later named to several Al1-Amer-
ican teams as a defensive halfback on past performances.

Against a notoriously weak team from Annapolis, the offensive line was

the goat as Navy blitzed through them for a 12-0 win. The
defense played its best game, but the turning point occurred
when the affectionate panda bears up front refused to open
a hole for the hibernating backﬁeld on the Navy 2-yard line.

The offense and defense played like an Eastern Power as
they upset the mercurial Miami Hurricanes. The offensive
line which had blundered through the season played as if they
were imported from Green Bay. Their blocks enabled Bobby
Dyer, Mike Raklewicz, and Crabtree to pound out 231 yards
on inside runs.

This was Pitt’s ﬁnest hour, and if the season had ended
here, it would have been disappointing, but not disgraceful.

In the next three games, Floyd Little of Syracuse (51-13),
Bill Wolski of Notre Dame (69-13), and Mike Garrett of
Southern Cal (28-0) penetrated the defensive line in a pro-
cess resembling osmosis. Rumors of discontent with the coach
were heard.

Against intrastate rival Penn State, however, the membrane
stiffened. The Panthers won their best battle of the season in
a ﬁerce display of loyalty for Coach Michelosen, but to no
avail. Before the sweat socks for the last game had aired, a
search for a new coach was underway. Dave Hart, an assistant
coach from Navy, faces in Pitt the biggest challenge of his
coaching career.

Cross Country

In 1964, with a rah-rah coach, the cross-country team was un-
beatable. In 1965, without that coach, the team became un-
bearable. Without the spirit of last year’s squad, this year’s
squad became aware that the sport was exactly what a coach
cannot allow them to think-—drudgery. They fell from a 6 and
0 record to a 2 and 4 mark. They ran because scholarships de-
pended on it. And, they ran because it was expected of them.

The two wins garnered by the harriers came against much
inferior talent. Both Slippery Rock and West Virginia Univer-
sity, who the Panthers defeated, are not in the same class as
the Panthers. And, while the harriers defeated those two
schools, they were walloped by four schools they had beaten
the year before. Ohio University and Kent State both defeated
the harriers on the same Saturday morning, and Navy and
Penn State both blasted them by the identical score, 19-42.
Dave Eichenlaub was the only bright spot, never ﬁnishing
worse than second. '

“Don’t let it be forgot/ That once
there was a spot/ That was known
as . . .” Pittsburgh. In view of the
Panther’s football season perhaps
it would be better if Pittsburgh
were forgotten. Yet, even as in the
Arthurian legend, there was a glim-
mer of hope. The Pitt soccer team
came through the season with a
7-1-1 record in regular play and
grabbed a berth in the NCAA
championship.

Despite the inexperience of many
players, the booters managed to
control the ﬁrst game, and Frost-
burg had only one chance to score.
Unlike some of Pitt’s other teams,
the soccer defense seemed to be
shaping up as one of their major
assets. Three goals squelched Frost-
burg in a 3-0 triumph.

Unfortunately, the sparkling de-
fense was not to last. In the second
game, teamwork, the biggest single
asset, was not enough. A slashing
West Chester attack combined with
the inexperience of goalie Ed Zel-
nick killed the Panthers. Con-
fronted with such problems as in-
juries, inexperience, and grass, a
rarity at Kennard Field, the team
lost a 4-1 decision.

However, one defeat was not go-
ing to stop Pitt. The Panthers
were unbeatable against Kent State,
making few mistakes and playing
with conﬁdence. A ﬁne team effort
torpedoed Kent State 3-1.

In the Grove City game, the for-
ward line missed kicks and muffed
passes, and the result was a tie at
one goal apiece. Pitt could not pro-
duce in the one overtime allotted.
Against Slippery Rock a mix-up
in front of the Pitt goal tied the
game at one all. Pitt was unable
to score the winning goal until the
last two minutes of play. It was a
shaky 2-1 victory.

Pitt opened the second half with
an impressive 2-0 shutout over
Ohio University. Perhaps taking

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  

revenge for West Virginia’s drubbing of
the football team, the booters effectively
clawed their way to a 3-1 Victory. The
Panthers tied the game in the third
period and wrapped up the game with
two fourth period goals.

The Panthers overcame some rather
unusual ofﬁciating to squeak through a
1-0 victory against Akron. The winning
goal scored in the fourth quarter gave the
team their sixth win in eight attempts.

In their last game the soccer team
seemed to have little trouble containing
Bucknell for a 3-0 win. Then the Pan-
thers settled down to serious nail biting
for an NCAA bid. After receiving the
NCAA berth, the booters discovered
that they were to play on their home
ﬁeld. The game was against East Strouds-
burg, Pitt’s toughest competition. The
defense allowed two goals, but the of-
fense, for the first time in the season,
failed to score a single goal. The ﬁeld
conditions hampered the booters’ at-
tacks, but East Stroudsburg managed two
goals. An NCAA championship Vanished
in a splash of mud.‘ - .

But the 1965 soccer team can honestly
claim one of the best Pitt sport’s teams
in a long time.

Basketball

The basketball season began with its usual ﬂurry of optimism when the
varsity squad defeated the freshmen by a fourth quarter rally. But when
the season started, the Panthers started poorly and got worse. Many
partisans had said that the cure to Pitt’s basketball woes was to schedule
more Ivy League opponents, since their academic standards prevented
them from being “basketball schools”. Unfortunately, Pitt did not meet
the Ivy standards as they were soundly whipped by Penn, Columbia,
and Cornell.

Against the bigger schools, Pitt fared even worse. The team’s ﬁve
victories came from the likes of Carnegie Tech (twice) and Rochester.
After defeating Westminster at home, by two points, the cagers lost a
105-75 decision at the small schools home court. The season was marked
by games in which the squad’s spirit was either Way up or miserably
down. The usual ratio was about four downs to every one up. Battling
for every rebound, the basketball team almost upset NIT bound Penn
State at University Park, losing 66-62. In the return match, the Panthers
were hammered 89-57. The sport’s only bright spot was the performance
of a freshman team rated as the best in six years.

Adding to the dreary winter sports scene was the gymnastics
team. Their dismal record, 4-7, wa.s brightened only by the
performance of senior Dave McKinnis and sophomores Jim
Sacco and Dave Shidemantle. McKinnis was the all around man,
and although he consistently did well in the dual meets, he
could not match the near-perfect scores of Steve Cohen of Penn
State or Mark Cohn of Temple in the tournament action. Shide—
mantle, injured for most of the regular season, came on strong
to capture the Eastern crown in the longhorse and then the
regional championship at Navy. Expectations were high for a
national championship, but his 9.25 Vault placed him fourth
in the nation, an accomplishment that speaks well for his future
as an all around man in the next two years. Despite the relative
impotence of the rest of the team, Coach V/Varren Neiger’s team
will have two dependable performers returning for the first time
in several years.

Swimming

With the exception of senior Don Hahnfeldt’s appearance in the Na-
tional Collegiate Athletic Association diving championships, the swim-
ming team had another dismal season. A team record of four wins in
eleven meets was compensated somewhat, however, by the showing of
individual swimmers.

Besides Hahnfeldt, who placed second in both the one and the three
meter diving events in the Eastern Collegiates, sophomores John Lane
and Joe LeViere show great promise for the next two years for coach
Ben Grady. Both Lane and LeViere competed in the Easterns. Lane, who
in dual meets usually placed ﬁrst in two events—the 200 and the 500-
yard freestyle, placed eighth in a ﬁeld of 37 in the 1650-yarder. Back-
stroker LeViere, in a ﬁeld of 37 swimmers, ﬁnished eighth and ninth
respectively in the 100 and the 200—yard events, Throughout the year,
it was these three who carried most of the load. However, there were
two staunch seniors who received their third letter for being with the
team. They were freestylers Andy James and Tom Ribarchak. Ribarchak
and Hahnfeldt co-captained this year’s team.

For the ﬁrst time in many
years, the Wrestling team fail-
ed to gain some prominence
in the East. The regular sea-
son was one of the poorest in
the school’s history, 2-8. Al-
though the wrestlers lacked
skill and experience, they pos-
sessed drive throughout the
season, almost upsetting Cor-
nell and showing well against
Lehigh and Temple. The vic-
tories over ‘West Virginia, 23-
8, and Syracuse, 27-9, were
contrasted to humiliating de-
feats to traditionally fellow-
powers Navy and Michigan.
The junior and sophomore-
dominated squad seemed to
improve during the season.
This included a somewhat
surprising performance in the
Easterns, and the Panthers
won most of their ﬁrst round
matches, and several of the
second rounds. The team’s top
performers were senior Clair
Riley and sophomore Jack
Williams. Both advanced to
the ﬁnals and earned second
place honors. The moment of
glory ended there as Williams’
asthma attack kept him out of
the Nationals, and Riley was
eliminated early in the NCAA
championship.

Track

Carl Rees’ resignation from the head coaching position head-
lined the track team’s short, and at times, dismal season. Rees,
who began as head coach in 1959, made his ﬁnal decision
after the team’s third loss at Notre Dame. Assistant coach
John Banner, who led the cross country team to honors two
years ago, assumed the head post. The meet with the Irish was
the third of the season; a large reduction from last year’s
schedule of six. Of the three meets, Pitt showed their best
(second place) in the second annual Big Four meet with Penn
State, West Virginia, and Syracuse.

In the Big Four sprinter Dick Crout, who earned his third
letter, showed he was having his best year. He won the 220,
and the 440. At Notre Dame he tied the school’s 100-yard dash
mark of :09.6. Another senior, Luddy Hayden, who had been
bothered by leg injuries throughout his college career, also
gained his third award. Don Hinchberger, an 880 man, Fred
Poellnitz, a hurdler, and Dave Sallach, a high jumper, each
gained his second letter.

It was another in a string of losing years for the golf team.
The golfers dropped twelve matches and were able to win
only three. The team was an easy victim in the ﬁrst few
matches of the season, but improved as the season pro-
gressed, and at its Conclusion was a rather strong aggrega-
tion. Against Ohio University, the mid—American cham-
pions, the golfers lost by a single point. In fact, the high-
light of the season was a loss. In their last match of the year
the golfers threw a scare into Penn State, the Eastern cham-
pions, only to lose when State’s top golfer sunk a 50 foot
chip shot to defeat Jim McKeon.

Baseball

Despite the fact that the baseball team didn’t do that much travel-
ing this year, it still managed to pass through the monsoons of the
Indian rainy season only to bog down in the doldrums of the
South Atlantic tradewinds.

Six of the baseball team’s early season games were rained out
leaving the team with a 3-4 record midway through its campaign.
Then when the rainclouds ﬁnally dried up, the mitters were
stymied with ﬁve straight losses at the tail end of the season, leaving
them with an 8-l0 mark for the year.

The most weathered person on Bobby Lewis’ frustrated team had
to be sophomore, pitcher-outﬁelder Dave Welty. Pitching twice as
many innings as any other pitcher on the staff, he struck out 69
batters in recording a 2.85 earned run average. The power for the
team, including four home runs, was provided by Steve Kienzl.

ODK Man
of the Year
Melvin Stein

In being chosen Man" of the Year, Mr.
Stein received the highest honor attain-
able by a senior man in the area of
leadership. A history major from Pitts-
burgh, Stein served as business manager
of the 1966 OWL, president of Druids,
business manager of the Polaris, secre-
tary of Pi Delta Epsilon, and a member
of Omicron Delta Kappa. With his 3.29
quality point average, he was also tap-
ped to Phi Eta Sigma. He plans to enter
the University’s Law School.

With the winning of the award, Mr.
Stein’s name will be inscribed on the
Senior Walk leading from the Cathedral
to Heinz Chapel. On the walk are in-
scribed the words: “On this walk ODK
honors those persons who through in-
telligent leade.rship, personal integrity,‘-
and intellectual honesty have served
their University well.”

Mr. and Miss Pitt
David Dawson and
Dorrie Brand

David Dawson and Dorrie Brand were
chosen as this year's Mr. and Miss Pitt
by a committee of prominent juniors
from various campus activities.

Mr. Dawson was a member of Alpha
Tau Delta and Sigma Tau. He also
served as president of Omicron Delta
Kappa, iniating a program of speakers.
He was a participant in varsity track and
varsity cross country.

Miss Brand was a member of Alpha
Epsilon Phi, Young Democrats, and the
Student Affairs Committee. She served as
president of Mortar Board, and was the
vice—president of Associated Women Stu-
dents in charge of the Housing Board.
She was also a recipient of the Thyrsa
Amos Award, a Junior Worthy, and a
member of Cwens.

The OWL Hall of Fame is perhaps the
only overt recognition given to graduating
student leaders on campus. Sponsored by
the OWL,.a committee of junior men and
women considers every senior and selects
those who contributed most during their
years at Pitt. While scholarship is a factor,
the most important criterion is not how
many organizations the senior has been a
member of, but rather how worthwhile his
contributions have been. The committee
attempts to select students from every area
of campus activity, from publications to
athletics. The 1966 committee chose twenty-
four seniors as members of the Hall of
Fame: Arla Jean Anderson, Marcia Bern-
stein, Cecilia Champ, Nancy Fuchs, Lud-
wig Hayden, Dyanne Hochman, Jerome
Hogan, Daniel Katz, Jane Kupneski, Har-
vey Lefton, Michael Marcuse, Sherree
Merenstein, Edwin Miguelucci, Beverly
Reifman, Toby Sandler, James Smith, John
Smith, Melvin Stein, Barbara Stevenson,
and Robert Supansic. Members are ac-
knowledged during the Tap Day cere-
monies in March.

A gnome-like ﬁgure with a
forest of kinky hair rose

slowly from his seat, took

his portable Paul Goodman in
hand, and began to chastize
unthinking students and
demagogic administrators. As
he continued his verbal as-
sault with his slick, New

York accent, student senators
blushed and squirmed and
advisors sat stunned at the
youth’s audacity. The

youth’s name—Rick Shweder.
Shweder’s verbal venom high-
lighted Student Government
meetings throughout the Fall
trimester. Instead of SC}
meetings being the usual
“Aye”—“Nay” complex of
routine bill passage, the
ﬂowing rhetoric of Shweder
and his Pitt Progressive Party
compatriots accelerated the
tempo.

More important than the
increased tempo was the sym-
bolism of the PPP actions.
They were the expression of
students fed up with futile,
frustrated efforts to experience
the unlimited freedom of an
academic environment. They
spoke for unlimited student
autonomy and against over-
bureaucratization, computer-
ization, and anti-intellectual
administrators. Many state-
ments were over-exaggerations

said in the heat of debate,
while others were well-planned
and articulated rhetorical
devices. The validity of their
comments was never
empirically measured, but they
bore a measure of truth.

There was no administrative
leadership in Student Affairs.
Dean Helen P. Rush moved
into the position and carried
along her well-worn twelfth
ﬂoor approach into an area
with many more structural and
psychological complexities.
The previous year student in-
volvement in the civil rights
movement expressed similar
frustrations. Yet, the action
was viewed as constructive

and educational, and the Uni-

Seniors

After checking once again that his graduation requirements
are complete, the graduating senior may take a brief look
at what the past two-and-one-half to four years have been.
To some, the years were like crawling out of a shell—each
course raising new questions, doubts, and satisfactions. To
others the depressed nonchalance known as “senioritis”
began in their freshman year. Now the senior is still con-
fronted with still other problems. Graduate school, work,
Peace Corps—New York, Pittsburgh, abroad, or Viet Nam.
The self-assured freshman now takes a different View of
life, the college degree he ﬁnds is not the answer to every
question. Rather it is just a beginning.

versity gave ﬁnancial support
to the bus trip to Montgomery.
The Student Affairs staff

in l966 displayed poor tact
with administrative ﬂedglings
mixing in student politics,
calling the PPP subversive,

and stunting an effort of
students to exchange Views.
They overtly criticized the
PPP and bearded SG President
Eric Stern.

Much of the critical stimulus
for students came from the

Berkeley aura which dominated

the nation’s campuses. The

analogy to Berkeley was tenous

and the problems were on a
much smaller scale. Yet the
campus activists claimed that
here existed a “volatile”
situation and student emanci-
pation justiﬁed the use of
any means. Stern bellowed
analogies via his historic

and philosophic repetoire,
creating a perpetual written
and verbal debate with The
Pitt News. A sigh of relief
came from Student Affairs
administrators and most
students as Stern resigned
and stormed out of a Student
Government meeting singing
“We Shall Overcome.”

The short-lived term of the
Stern regime revealed a basic
and persisting problem at
Pitt. It forced an unstated

anti-intellectual atmosphere
into the open. People who
were supposedly guiding the
policy—making of an academic
institution and many students
reacted with juvenile fear
and an unacademic approach.
As the Student Government
activitism ended, the Univer-
sity’s public relations image
received a boost, the Pitts-
burgh community was pleased,
and there was a return to the
boredom of normalcy.

The following is a copy of the
speech delivered by Robert
Suparzsic at the 1966 Tap Day
Ceremonies.

For the last several decades
there has been a quiet and
angry struggle going on
between the individual and
those forces organizing his
society. This struggle has now
ﬂashed bitterly in the open
—where our extraordinary
native conservatism has led
our “shou1d-know—better”
majority to react with panic.
Panic, with its undigniﬁed
connotations, is not too strong
a word. We need only witness
the “good intentions gone
wrong” of the Berkeley
administration. With the
individual against the sheer
magnitude of the forces of
organization—the struggle is
an uneven one. But these forces
aligned with panic and the
match is painfully—disgrace-
fully unfair.
As civilized individuals-

of course, we all seek to
minimize the tensions that
beset our society. In addition
to the standard police-type
forces, we have created
bureaucracies that regulate

all sorts of human activities
toward the end of marshalling
the forces of production so
that society might operate

more eiﬁciently. Our only-
our present panicked attempt:
to contain this wild animal,
human society.

We have traveled so far so
fast down this road of social
paciﬁcation that we are the
envy of the rest of the world:
what human problem is so
complex that we can’t form a
committee to handle it?

This is our attitude, our
conveyance. And we have
impressed ourselves so much
with this conveyance that we
haven’t noticed the changing
landscape. I submit that the
road we are traveling leads into
a human desert.

Man’s single saving grace
is not his rationality but his
humanity. And at base, that
humanity reduces to a simple

matter of integrity. I use the
word in the old, forgotten way,
the way it was used when men
still knew that they were men,
when they still knew that
underneath all of their
complexity and contradiction 
there was still possible a
unique coherence: and I add a
profoundly mysterious
coherence.

It is exactly this coherence
that is under attack in our
society. The few quiet and
desperate voices raised in
protest are but chaff in the
wind before the accumulate
age, wisdom, experience and
numbers of bureaucracy. That
it should be so is but further
evidence of how much value
we place in the ability of an
individual to see into his
own condition.

“Don’t Let It Happen Again”
became the campaign slogan of
the Students United for Re-
sponsible Expression (SURE)
in ]anuary’s Student Govern-
ment elections. While the Pitt
Progressives had promised
emancipation from administra-
tive coddling, SURE offered
emancipation from the PPP.
Students accepted the latter
with an unprecedented 2,000
votes being cast. The brief,
but controversial term of Eric
Stern had set the stage for a
“responsible” student back-
lash. The militant minority
gained only two Senate seats

as SURE’s Ralph Manning
and Senate slate took office
claiming a mandate from the
“clean—shaving” majority.

The new regime became the
antithesis of the radical Stern-
Shweder group. Business was
conducted in smooth, orderly
fashion as though pre-planned
weeks in advance. There was
little debate, only slight
conflict, and an atmosphere of
“one big happy family.”
Appointments were made to
the usual long list of com-
mittees, secretaries were
appointed to keep eﬂicient ﬁle
systems, and the new regime
vowed to stand ﬁrm for student
rights. After setting up a
constitutional revision com-
mittee of their own, the

Senate approved a new consti-
tution as outlined by the
outgoing Senate. A General
Assembly, President’s Council,
and University Appeals Board
highlighted the framework of
the autonomy—minded group.
With the trimester at an end

a student referendum and
administrative approval were
postponed until the fall
trimester.

Allocations from the Student
Activities Fee had been the
impetus for Stern’s tirades,
but now they were handled
smoothly. Ironically, all four
members of the committee
were chosen by SG—the Very
proposal which caused furor
when proposed by the PPP.
The means used had changed,
but the goal had‘ not. The
people were more “respect-
able” and the administrators
did not interfere. Some
ignorance was removed, and

a modicum of progress took
its place.

FRIEND

To see this whole struggle in
microcosm, one need look no
further than this University.
Education used to be a process
involving the whole man,

a test of character. But the
problem of administering the
needs of education has turned
the University into a gigantic
enterprise whose primary
function seems to be the
production of huge quantities
of used paper. The tour

de force of the University
student is the research paper-
X pages long, with such and
such bibliography, so many
footnotes, and produced by
a certain date. It seems to

me that the mundane act of
writing a paper should be
an act of faith.

But let us look at it from the
other direction. I have met
one or two people here who

have understood something
of the glories of this language
of ours. I refuse to forgive
this University for not making
a place for its poets. The
result of the University's
indifference is that those few
touched with the lunatic
genius of poetry shield their
work from the world and
there is no one to tell those
who think they have it to
shut up. Writing a paper or
writing a poem, both, it seems
to me, are tests of man's
integrity, and quite out of
place.

When a man’s basic
integrity is eliminated from
relevant discussion, there can
be little question of giving
him meaningful responsibility.

lThus the logic of reserving

an administrative veto over
any Student Government legis-

‘ Yes, be wise and give yourself the best. And

Blue Cross and Blue Shield are best because
they are the only professionally-sponsored

themselves.

lation. Further, care must be
taken in the recognition

of student organizations lest
chaos erupt, irrespective of
whether chaotic pluralism

is basic to man’s character.

If responsibility is withheld
from us now, when will we
ever learn to assume the
responsibility of living in
this democratic society? If
that basic diversity and
variegation that feeds the
human soul slowly disappears,
where will we ever ﬁnd the
ﬂexibility to preserve this
republic?

has spoken with great force

the strength of What he felt,

from those placards that
today adorn the marble
lounge.

It is not enough that society
merely function; it is time
we concerned ourselves with
matters of style. I do not
advocate the overthrow of
authority. But what I am
saying is that I am a man:
now plan around me, not
over me or through me.

In this grand battle, in this
armageddon, my money is

with the men, not with how
they are organized. In the
end men will seek out their
own self respect and their
right to be responsible
regardless of whether their
organization deems it
irrelevant.

In this society of free
speech, press, worship, in this
society where freedom itself
is practically an institution
it is time men sought the
freedom to be.

For those intimately associated with the OWL, it
is not just a book to be glanced through and then
lain away. Rather it is a living thing, with each
year’s book having a personality of its own. The
personality of the 1966 OWL was in part predeter-
mined by the editor, but to a greater extent deter-
mined by this year’s happenings. The 1966 OWL
was to be a critical interpretation of the year. The
increase in student activism, the statewrelatedness
issue, and the other campus controversies generated
throughout the year not only justified but de-
manded such a critical appraisal.

In keeping with tradition, the 1966 OWL was
put out by a core group of people. If the book is
a success, these people deserve the praise: Earl,
the only other person to see the “last day” and
without whom the book would never have been
ﬁnished; Bill, for the copy which dominates the
Intro and for other things; George and Susie, for
staying over to work on the book and for their
support; my incomparable photo staff—Tom C.
and Tom S., who did the work of ten photogra-
phers and never complained, even about cancelled
organization shots (well, hardly ever); and John,
Pat, Dave, Rita, Carol, Paula, Nancy, and Mel.
These staff members and other members of the
fourth ﬂoor I thank for their suggestions, con-
tributions, criticisms, and for putting up with an
editor who once or twice verged on the fringes of
paranoia.

Special thanks are also extended to the following:
Dr. Abe Laufe, for his sincere interest in the OWL
and in all the publications; Irving Lloyd, who
lived through an “extraordinary introduction,”
through pictures that “don't say anything,”
through an editor who couldn’t say exactly what
she wanted, but who in the end shot some truly
great pictures for us; and Irving Rothman, for his
understanding of the problems encountered in
producing the OWL, for his advice, and especially
for his encouragement.

It has been a good year; the best of mylfour
years on the OWL staff. Thanks, and good luck
Earl and the 1967 OWL staff.

During the past year, you, the members of the busi-
ness staff have worked alone and in groups to enable
another group of people to create a yearbook. Now
that the year is over it is impossible for me, the
person who nominally led you, to properly acknowl-
edge your efforts and my debt to you. As is the
natural course of things some worked harder than
others. None of us was either indispensible or entirely
expendable. For your efforts each of you deserve
thanks. Your thanks, however, comes not from any
passed over paragraph of acknowledgments, but from
the satisfaction derived from the knowledge that the
job has been done, and more than adequately. If
that satisfaction is missing, I fear it is because you
failed to allow the OWL to become at least a little
part of your inner self. Those with titles and little
else will probably beneﬁt several times in the future
from an item in your resume reﬂecting your respon-
sibilities. To those however, who have literally lived
a year or more in 400 Schenley Hall, the future holds
a certain amount of nostalgia for a time that can
never be fully forgotten or remembered. This I think
is a more valuable thanks than the few words I can
devote to your effortsin this paragraph. To those of
you non—stalf members who have happened upon this
page, the names of those persons who have made this
book possible are listed to the right. It is to them
that the credit for this book must go.

My special thanks to Liz for doing the work no one
else would do and to Heather for being there when
I needed you. Above all my thanks to the twenty or
so salesmen who never had the chance to let the
OWL become part of them and are responsible more
than anyone else for our hitting our circulation goal.

Four years have passed since I first came to Pitt.
Most of them have been spent on the fourth ﬂoor.
For what I have learned and experienced, I will al-
ways be grateful to Irving Rothman, who proudly
accepted the responsibility of a fourth ﬂoor free to
say what it pleased without any form of prior ad-
ministrative restraint or censorship. If I’ have accom-
plished anything on the publication’s ﬂoor, it is to
him that the largest credit belongs.

majority staged a “Support
Our Boys in Vietnam Rally”
on the front porch of the
Student Union. Main
supporters were glory-seeking
students presenting themselves
as leaders and a throng of
juveniles from the Educational
Institute of Pittsburgh. It was
a pep-rally type presentation
with gung—ho enthusiasm
spurting out like cheers at a
football game. The “militant
minority” took their tra-
ditional place in protest
fashion asking for debate on
the Vietnam issue. A few
sporadic debates broke out in
the crowd and half of the
courageous University police

force took time out from tow-

ing cars to safeguard students.

A short, stocky Vietnam
veteran appeared before the

audience, leading a chorus of
the national anthem. Those
who sang along and cheered

the speeches were characterized
as patriots; the others they

said were unpatriotic. Those
who opposed the rally also

sang along though. They

respected their country for
being a place where they could
stand and protest the actions
of fellow citizens.

Many did not agree with the
views of the rally leaders,

but the issue itself became

the focal point. The failure
was that student viewpoints
were never expressed at any
level except the rally. People
holding both pro and anti-
government viewpoints talked
within their separate groups.
All sat and listened in the
summer when Dr. Herbert
Aptheker, avowed Communist,
and Arnaud de Borchgrav ,
Newsweek correspondent,
presented lectures on Vietnam.
Despite these stimuli, there
was no formal confrontation
between students. There was
no poll of opinion and when
forums were attempted there
was little cooperation.

Students are continually
bifurcated into the leagues of

commuters and dorm students.

Bleary-eyed and physically

, exhausted from an early

trolley or an auto ride, the
commuter carries his brown
grease-stained lunch bag in
the tradition of the Pittsburgh
mill hand. He is a plebian
king and the Student Union
with its loafable furnishings
is his castle. When not wan-
dering between buildings in

a nomadic search for a resting
place, the commuter meanders

along asphalt and concrete
paths to feed the city’s

parking meters. Commuters
often become apathetic
towards extra-curricular affairs
because of their inability to
stay at school all day. Most
come and go, get their edu-
cation, and leave with little
feeling for alma mater.
Dormitory residents have no
ready excuse for non-involve-
ment in University life.

Many are aloof by nature,
channelling their activities into
a small, closed group early

in their residence. Dormitory ,
houses become the center of
activity for some, but many
more View the dorm merely as
a place to sleep, eat, and
occasionally study. Men’s
Dormitory Council makes
futile efforts to make the dorms
the focal point of student life.
Their efforts are somewhat
fruitful in athletic awards,
contests, and socials, but

fail to achieve the desired
broad impact. Activist com-
muters resenting their lack of
a similar coordinating body
established an association this
year. With increasing com-
muters the group may become
meaningful, but the possi-
bilities are it will be even less
successful than Men's Dorm
Council in mobilizing its
constituents.

If you don’t come to Pitt with
an ulcer, you can be sure of
leaving with one. Eating
establishments within the Uni-
versity consistently perform
this deed for the pharmacists
of the country. Their menus
are loaded with such health-
giving foods as cokes, hot

dogs, hamburgers, sandwiches,
cookies, cakes, pretzels,

potato chips, ice cream, and
candy.

Occasionally there are salads
and soups to give the appear-
ance of a well—balanced meal.
The Hunt Room and Tuck
Shop are the most frequented

cafeterias for the busied
epicure. Hunt Room waitresses

are noted for the speed with
which they reel pre-cooked
hamburgers out of a grease
ﬁlled pan onto the plates

of customers. Stale buns and
equally stale expressions of
the hired help add to the
pleasant dining atmosphere.
The Vogue for Greeks is a
casual coke or coffee and a ‘
large chunk of gab in the
comfort of Tuck Shop booths.
Diluted liquid refreshments
and free ice are the special-
ties of the house. In a val-
iant but futile effort to
supplement their unbalanced
diets, students turn to the
towers cafeteria. The cafe-
teria’s atmosphere is extremely
relaxed and eating there

is on a purely Voluntary
basis—if you feel like eating
there you just pay for your
yearly meal ticket; if you
don't, you just pay for your
yearly meal ticket.

A class is a class is a class
unless the professor has class.
That variably deﬁned and
rarely experienced phenom-
enon known as class breaks

the boredom of constant
studying, gives meaning to
education, and elevates the
mind. Subject matter comes
alive, required work becomes
an unforgettable mental
experience, and previously
unknown nomenclature
becomes common knowledge.
The professor’s style becomes
crucial to the student. It
guides his choice of a major,
his peer acquaintances, and
often his selection of a
career. At Pitt such class

is not predominant. The struc-
ture of academic programs does
not encourage informal, face-
to—face relations with prof-
fessors at the undergraduate
level. While many classes are
not of gargantuan proportion,
the aura of formalism is
pervasive. Students do not
become exposed to a variety of
subject areas in depth until
they are seniors and must
choose a ﬁeld for graduate
study. Seminars are restricted
to honors programs and honors
programs to honors students

and there are too few of both.

Interdisciplinary majors and
interdisciplinary courses

are non—existent, and course
offerings are limited because
faculty are overburdened.

A breakthrough came in this
academically-stagnant program
with a revision of distribu-
tion requirements by the
School of Liberal Arts. Newly-—
appointed Dean James Kehl
promised a revised and pro-

gressive Liberal Arts program,
leaving some hope for '
increased mental stimulation.
Increased state aid also just-
iﬁed some optimism with hope
that the aid would increase
faculty salaries. While the
aid insures the University’s
ability to keep pace with
rising quantitative needs for
faculty, it gives no assurances
for quality. Progress re-
quires a more adequate em-
phasis on creativity, innova-
tion, and intellectual prowess.
Until there is more class in
the class, there will remain

an academic gap.

An ashtray full of cigarette
butts, the aroma of freshly
lit pipe tobacco, some crum-
bled notebook paper, the tap-
ping of a pencil, the squirm-
ing of a body on a leather
chair—these are the sounds
of studying. After the daily
routine of attending class,

the student ﬁnds himself
confronted with a reading list,
an essay, or a term paper.
Old card catalogue drawers are
ﬂung about as he frantically
writes a myriad of call numbers

on call slips. Then the wait. '

He is number 31. Numbers go
ﬂashing on and off the call
board like changing stock
quotations on the mechanized
stock boards of Wall Street.
“25, 42, 27, 28, 30.” Thirty-
one sits on a hard wood bench,
occasionally shifting his pos-
ture, and critically appraising
the passing females. “S1”
ﬂashes on the board. He walks
in an aloof manner to the
desk, shows his credentials, and
awaits his prize. In return
he receives his original slip
with a scribbled notation

M :7

out .

Thirty-one then proceeds
diligently back to the card
catalogue, pulls out another
sheet from the reading list
and retraces his steps to the
circulation desk. “Missing” is
now inscribed on his slip and
the search for truth appears
temporarily stymied. The
scholar picks up his rejected
requests and continues his
never-ending search; the stu-
dent presses the elevator
button.

Romance

The distances

the quest—
songs growing fainter.
behind the rider.

Laughter and tapestried colors
They know how to throw a party, all right,
back there
good booze chicken legs sharp broads
you could drown in the wine
turn dusty
in a forgotten corner
dim, neglected, unwished—for
yet the colors were bright and the songs were good
and enough
a (if you never looked up)
end there with friends to bury you
your name on their lips at each bright feast.

The lifting of the eyes
the horizon feels uneasy
given word
becomes ﬂesh and motion
pledges direction and distance
all the songful colors
candle down and gutter out.

The forest gives Way
to forest
along the quiet clip—clop steps.
Belief grows straight.
The road be-lifes the spirit

toward the white distance.

The Year

The year 1965-66 was characterized by a fluctuation of a student involvement
in campus events. While Student Government, S. G. elections, and Vietnam
received both student support and criticism, the yearly campus activities
suffered from traditional student apathy. Even with tickets selling at reduced
prices, Homecoming and Winter Weekend had difﬁculty breaking even.
Student Union Board-sponsored socials attracted few, and the Arts Series
entertainers often performed before a sparse audience. However, the Public
Alfairs lectures and coffee hours continued to attract students with Ted
Sorensen speaking to an overﬂowing Student Union Ballroom. In an effort
to arouse more student interest, the Winter Convocation was changed from
its usual daytime program to a night schedule. With or without student
interest, however, there was a perpetual flow of events during the year.

F"::~-iflP- 
Freshmen Orientation

The incoming freshmen attend a three-day
orientation session during the summer. This
introduction to academic life consists of a
series of speeches on student responsibilities
from administrators, placement tests, and
appointments with advisors. After being told
repeatedly that they are the smartest class Pitt
has yet taken, the freshmen are then given
details of the University’s probation policy.
The evenings spent swimming at Trees Hall
or dancing on the Gateway Clipper are
found to be very pleasant after the day’s
jumble of explanations and questions. The
ﬁrst weekend on campus, the freshman class
is asked to attend the Freshman outing.
Sitting and talking, canoeing or playing
tennis, the new students become acquainted
on the outing—the first and last time the
entire class is together until commencement.

Lantern Night

Lantern Night is the tradi-
tional ceremony by which the
freshmen women are formally
inducted into the University.
In previous years individual
lanterns were presented to
each woman, but because of
the ﬁnancial crisis, candles
were substituted in this year’s
ceremony. As each freshman
received the ﬂame to light her
candle, she symbolically ac-
quired the responsibility of
fulﬁlling her pledge as a Uni-
versity woman——“to seek both
for myself and for those who
follow me, the universal light
of truth.” In the darkened
Commons Room even the
most unemotional couldn't
help being touched by the
beauty of the ceremony.

 

  

Parents Weekend

With all the coverage given to
the demonstrations and pickets on
the nation’s campuses, Parents
came to the University in October
to ﬁnd out what was happening
at Pitt. At a reception on Friday
parents were assured by Dean
Helen Rush and her staff that
there were few extremists on
campus. Saturday before the game
two panels were conducted on
“Changing Morals on the Univer-
sity Campus,” and “A Berkeley
At Pitt? The Revolution in the
Urban Universities.” After the
game the parents could attend a
number of teas and open houses.
The program ended Saturday
night with a dance at which the
Huntsmen, Glee Club, and De-
bate Union performed.

Convocations

Twice during the year, the
faculty and administration,
gowned in their academic
robes, participate in Con-
vocation ceremonies. At
the Fall Convocation, his-
torian Henry Steele Com-
mager received an honorary
Doctor of Law degree along
with Leonard Marks, direc-
tor of the United States
Agency, and Howard How-
land, Deputy Assistant Sec-
retary of State for Educa-
tional and Cultural Affairs.
Dr. Commager’s keynote
speech concerned the role
of the urban university in
modern society. For the
Winter Convocation, Vice
Chancellor Helen Rush
changed the format of the
program, hoping to arouse
more student interest and
participation. Instead of
the usual morning cere-
mony, the convocation was
held on a Wednesday eve-
ning. Dr. William Steinberg,
director of the Pittsburgh
Symphony, was awarded an
honorary Doctor of Hu-
manities degree. He then
conducted the symphony
in a special program of
classical Works. Unfortun-
ately even the appearance
of the Pittsburgh Symphony
could only attract a sparce
student audience.

Public Affairs

The name of the noon lecture
and coffee hour periods spon-
sored by the Student Union
Board was changed from Mid-
day to Public Affairs, but the
wide variety of well-known
speakers is continuing. This
year’s speakers included a
prima ballerina, CIA agent,
Presidential consultant, eco-
nomics specialist, existential-
ist, columnist, and Marxist
leader. Dame Alicia Markova
discussed her career as a prima
ballerina and her present du-
ties as director of the Metro-
politan Ballet School. Secret
branches of the government

7 were revealed when Thomas

Ross, author of The Invisible
Government, a book dealing
with the CIA, spoke at the
noon lecture. Theodore Soren-
sen spoke to the University
community about the P.resi-
dency under Kennedy and ex-
plained some of the contro-
versial motives for action or
inaction during recent crises.
The American society and its
economies was discussed at a
lecture by Vance Packard,
author of the Status Seekers.
Existentialism, its role in so-
ciety and its effect on Colin
Wilson, was the subject of his
talk which was based on The
Outsider, his most recent
book. Classics expert and
“Saturday Review” columnist
Kenneth Rexroth spoke and
answered questions from a
Midday audience. With addi-
tional funds received form the
Allocations Fund the Board
anticipates expanding the
Program and bringing to the
campus Ihore controversial
speakers.

The Arts Series

In the middle of this year the
revised Student Union Board
formed the Arts Committee,
replacing the PM Series, and
introduced art competition
and more exhibits. Earlier in
the year the PM Series pre-
sented pianist Dolores Holtz’s
interpretation of Mendels-
sohn’s “Variations Serieuses,”
in addition to Mozart’s “Sona-
ta in E Flat Major,” Proko-
ﬁeIf’s “Sonata in A Major,”
and a series of Chopin pieces.
Rey de la Torre, a classic
guitarist, performed at an-
other PM Series program. The
Cuban musician was a child
prodigy and at the age of 14
travelled to Spain to study
under Miguel Llobet. The
nine members of The Back
Porch Majority entertained in
November. Their music ca-
reers stem from Randy Sparks’
“Ledbetter’s Store of Fun and
Folk Music,” in West Los
Angeles, California. A jazz
series was also held, featuring
Pittsburgh notables such as
Walt Harper and the blind
musician, Eric Klaus. Also in-
cluded in the Board’s Pro-
gram were concerts by the
Pittsburgh Symphony Sym-
phonetta and the Antioch
String Quartet. In an effort
to obtain more student par-
ticipation, the Arts Series
sponsored a student art con-
test including photography
and painting.

Football Activities

Spirit drips out of the student body like
water from a leaking faucet:—from noon till
midnight Saturday there’s spirit, then the
faucet is turned off until the next home
game. Students are lured from their dorms
and fraternities to half—heartedly herald in
the pigskin parodies at the weekly pep rally,
their stimulus, the Student Government
Spirit Award. Bellowing sounds of elephant
horns, until banned by the Athletic Depart-
ment, sweet smells of rum and coke, though
forbidden by the University, and occasional
shouting for a Pitt touchdown, though dis-
couraged by a dismal offense, set the sta-
dium scene. Unfortunately, the sound of
the 1965 season was not the roaring of the
Panthers, but the explosive displays of op-
position team power accompanied by the
moaning of sparce crowds. Fans preoccupied
themselves by vying for the attention of
coke vendors.

Homecoming

With an emergency alloca-
tion of $1,000 the 1966
Homecoming committee at-
tempted to make the week-
end something it had rare-
ly been in the past—a suc-
cess. However, their efforts
were futile. Lisa Kirk, who
entertained Friday night at
the Holiday House, was
more than disappointing.
Even the football team was
uncooperative as it was
trounced by a spirited
Notre Dame team, 69-13 at
Saturday’s game. Fraterni-
ties again decided not to
build Homecoming ﬂoats
but rather to make ban-
ners, which unfortunately
couldn't compensate for the
absence of a Homecoming
parade. Cathy Walker was
crowned Homecoming
Queen, and a dance in the
Commons Room with Gary
U.S. Bonds ﬁnished off the
weekend. Taking every-
thing into consideration, it
wasn’t a very memorable
one.

Winter Weekend

Winter Weekend has tradition-
ally been hampe.red by a lack
of cooperation from the student
body. Since fraternities sponsor
their own winter weekends, their
participation is at a minimum.
However, few student organiza-
tions other than the Greeks erect
booths for the Carnival Night.
Even a large subsidy from the
Allocations Fund failed to make
this year’s Winter Weekend 21
success. The big name performer,
Stan Getz put on a mediocre
performance, while students
walked out during the Blues
Project Act. Perhaps the best
event of the weekend was the
Saturday afternoon hootenanny
featuring Josh White, Jr., who
entertained for three hours.

Greek Week

The busiest week on cam-
pus for fraternities and so-
rorities is the annual Greek
Week held in March. The
festivities always begin
with a chariot race down
Bigelow Boulevard on
Monday. This year as a
service project, blood was
donated to the Central
Blood Bank. Over 250
Greeks participated and
158 pints of blood were
given. The theme for
Greek Sing was “That
Wonderful Year” and the
songs ranged from “No, No
a Thousand Times No,” to
the Mellon Bank Credit
Card song. Adrienne Sanza
was crowned Greek Week
Queen for her performance
as a twenty-one year old
“has been.” Instead of ex-
change dinners at the fra-
ternity houses, each sorori-
ty and fraternity sent rep-
resentatives to an All-
Greek Dinner held in the
Student Union Ballroom.
Friday night a formal
dance was held at the
Churchill Valley Country
Club. The Week ended on
Saturday night with a con-
cert featuring the Ramsey
Lewis Trio and the Bitter
End singers, followed by
fraternity open houses.
The Order of Omega tap-
ped four new members and
Jim Smith was selected Mr.
Fraternity for 1966.

Engineer Week

In keeping with tradition Engi-
neer’s Week began with the ar-
rival of St. Patrick, and, tradi-
tionally, his entrance came in
an enexpected manner. In spite
of the snow and cold weather,
St. Pat arrived in a ten foot sail-
boat. That evening an Alumni
Dinner was held at Webster Hall
with Maxime Faget, head engi-
neer at NASA, as the featured
speaker. The theme for the dis-
plays this year was “the sea,”
while Thursday night's gimic
satirized radio and television
commercials. A shamrock hunt
found engineers with wa1kie-
talkies climbing trees, digging in
waste cans, and turning the cam-
pus upside-down in search of
a hundred small shamrocks. With
the civil engineers capturing first
place, followed by the electrical
and chemical engineers, the
week’s festivities ended in the
annual Shamrock Ball.

Commencement

Those fortunate souls who have
accumulated a hundred and
twenty-four credits and ﬁlled the
distribution requi.rements return
to the campus in June for Com-
mencement, even if they did com-
plete their class work ten months
earlier. This year’s ceremony was
essentially oriented to the Pitts-
burgh community. The main
speaker was Dr. H. -Guyford
Stever, President of Carnegie
Tech. Honorary degrees were
awarded to two members of the
Board of Trustees and to Dr.
Sidney Marland, Superintendent
of Pittsburgh Public Schools:
Then for two hours Dr. Kurtz-
man conferred on each school the
rights and responsibilities per-
taining to it, after which gradu-
ates hurried to the book store

for their refund.

Academics

 

Three years ago the University of Pittsburgh accepted
the challenge of extending its limits beyond the Oak-
land campus, via the regional campuses. Today, these
campuses at Bradford, Greensburg, Titusville, and
Johnstown are a ﬂourishing and growing part of the
University community. The Johnstown campus, now
forty years old, was the University’s first experiment
with a subsidiary campus. Its success was instrumental
in the establishment of the three other campuses.
Through the regional campuses the University is ex-
tending the boundaries of human knowledge to many
who, perhaps, could not otherwise obtain a college
education. Though facilities are not as expansive as
those of the Oakland campus, the regional campuses
provide the same scholastic opportunities available in
the ﬁrst two years at the Oakland campus.
