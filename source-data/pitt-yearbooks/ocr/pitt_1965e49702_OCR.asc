  Yellow lines, parking meters, and meter
maids greet the commuting student daily.
Commuters can park in Schenley Park or at
a space by a parking meter; if it's legal to
park that day. Parking by the meter can be
a gamble. You park your car and take a
chance that the meter will work. If it works,
you hope it doesn't run fast. And if it runs
fast, you hope some meter maid doesn't
give you a ticket. A scooter seems to be the
only way to win.
commencement'65 was, unfortunately,
made notable mainly by the absence of the Chancellor. A mild heart attack suffered two weeks
earlier left the Chancellor in Presbyterian Hospital. Irregardless, 5000 graduates, faculty, and parents filled Syria Mosque, enduring the long and
largely meaningless ritual with only the usual
amounts of yawns and drooping heads. R. Sargent
Shriver, director of the Peace Corps and coordinator of Vista, discussed his favorite subject, poverty, and when it was all over 2900 students congratulated each other on completing their arduous
task. Among the more noteworthy aspects of the
ceremony were the awarding of honorary degrees
to Sargent Shriver, Governor William Scranton,
and United States Senator John Sherman Cooper.

Regional Campuses
  Four area campuses extend the scope of education of the
University of Pittsburgh throughout the local region of
Pennsylvania. Though often housed in make-shift quarters, the
campuses provide the same scholastic opportunities available
in the first two years at the Oakland campus. Like the Oakland
campus itself, the area campuses, Johnstown, Bradford, Titusville and Greensburg, are all in the midst of extensive building
programs. While Johnstown has been a part of the University
for close to forty years, the other three area campuses were
only welcomed to the University community last year. For a
majority of the students attending the area campuses, education doesn't stop after their first two years. They will transfer
to other colleges and many will come to the Oakland campus.
The University in recent years has not stopped with expansion
into the immediate region. An extensive exchange program has
been developed with the Central University in Quito, Equador
and similiar programs began this year in various parts of Africa.
BRADFORD
  The remodeled Hamsher House is the center of
activity for the three hundred eighty full time students involved in the University's two-year regional campus program at Bradford, Pa. In addition
to Hamsher House, with its language and science
classrooms and laboratories, there is the traditional Tuck Shop which serves as a meeting ground
and place of relaxation. Emery Hall, once a hotel,
now serves as a residence for both men and
women students. Some residences in the town and
the YMCA also are used as dorms. Emery also
serves as a makeshift Monte Carlo with groups of
students playing cards in the lobby. There are
twenty-four full time faculty members who teach
one hundred evening students as well as the full
time student body. The local citizens take an interest in the campus. Last year they raised almost
eight hundred thousand dollars for use by the
Bradford campus.
              GREENSBURG
  A large sign on Maple Avenue announces the
University's regional campus at, Greensburg. Like
many emerging campuses, Greensburg does not
own all the facilities it needs and must look to the
town for many of them. Men's physical education
classes take place in the local "Y" and rooms in
the Penn-Albert Hotel serve as dorms. The
Charles McKenna Lynch estate, purchased last
summer, will be the site of permanent dormitories,
a swimming pool and tennis courts. The thirtyone rooms in the main building on the estate will
be used for classrooms, laboratories and reception
rooms. In their process of expansion, the Greensburg campus student body will reach a peak of
one thousand in approximately four years.

JOHNSTOWN
  Boasting a freshman class of three
hundred, forty percent coming from
out of state, the Johnstown regional
campus began its thirty-seventh year.
Like the Oakland central campus, the
face of Johnstown area campus is
also changing. In years past it was
mostly the engineer who came to
study on the campus, but in the 60's
there has been a trend to broader
student thinking, including   more
interest in the liberal arts. Social fraternities, a social sorority and the
Student Congress are all a part of the
new interests on the campus. The
asphalt campus has two      central
buildings, a red brick main building
and a wooden structure which serves
as a library. Some of the seven hundred students at Johnstown find the
front of both buildings a popular
place to gather and discuss classes as
well as social life.

TITUSVILLE
  Once a haven for oil barons, Titusville, Pa.
now serves as one of the University's regional campuses. Remnants of past glories
such as the haute cuisine at the Drake Hotel
still haunt students at the campus, but for
the most part they do not prevent them from
enjoying the informality of playing a chess
game in T-shirts in the small student union.
Located on one of Titusville's distinguished
landmarks, the L. C. McKinney estate, the
main building of the campus houses classrooms, faculty and administrative offices, a
snack bar and student lounges with study
areas. The chemistry, physics and biology
laboratory are located in the Bennett Davis
Memorial Building which was once the carriage house of the estate. The thirty-five students who plan to transfer to Oakland campus feel they will miss the casual studentteacher relations prominent at Titusville.
Schools
  If an outsider would pick up a copy of the Pitt
News, it might seem to him that the University is
concerned with speeches by celebrities, club meetings and administrative appointments. But as one
becomes familiar with the University, it soon is
evident that it is not these things, but rather the
schools that are the essential element, the raison
d'6tre of the Oakland campus. No one interest is
cultivated more than another but there is a place
for practically every line of educational pursuit.
Mixing   drugs is one    student's fancy   while
another's is reading Shaw. But it is this diversity
of education, that variety of opportunity that exists within the several schools that forms the core
of the University complex.

                                                       have these qualities. This year the OWL gave
                                                       the student body a chance to select those

         History
  Summer comes to an abrupt
halt in September. Students must
push aside those beautiful
thoughts of swimming, golfing,
and steel mills and prepare their
minds for the arduous task of
study. Somehow, the same faces
seem to reappear each year.
Even the new freshman class
seems the same. They walk
around dumbfounded by the
perplexities of college life,
scrutinizing every angle of the
school's diverse architecture. To
most the return soon becomes
more like a coming home than a
going away.

LIBERAL ARTS
  No one school encompasses as much of University life and
affects as many students as the School of Liberal Arts. Divided
in three divisions, humanities, social sciences, and natural sciences, the subjects offered in the School range from an introduction to poetry to physical chemistry. The year was a year
of questioning for those attending. Students pondered over the
effectiveness of the advising center and the availability and
knowledge of the advisor. Distribution was also a subject of
controversy. The Liberal Arts Cabinet evaluated some 80 and
180 courses as excellent but others were termed "verbal regurgitation."
ENGINEERING
AND MINES
  Part way up the "steel hill," north of the Cathedral future engineers study for their degrees in
the School of Engineering and Mines. The "Civils"
may work in the soil lab or a "Double E" may
ponder over the wiring on a test circuit. At the
end of their day, they are forced to come down
from the hill to catch the 73 Highland to Shadyside or return to their wedge-shaped, one room
castles. Upon graduation some may continue on to
specialization in graduate school, but practically
every student hears industry or government calling with at least two or three offers.

                          -Ile      EDUCATION
  The education student learns while
he or she teaches. Most student
teaching is done in the Pittsburgh
public schools. After two years as a
liberal arts student the education major begins to learn what is involved
in teaching. The student attends art
seminars, learns the proper use of
audio visual aides, and observes
special techniques, such  as team
teaching. During practice teaching,
the student may show a high school
teenager how to master the adding
machine in a bookkeeping course or
play "house" with five year olds in a
kindergarten class.

DENTISTRY
  Learning to work with his hands is
as important to the dental student as
increasing his intellectual capability.
Manipulating the delicate tools of his
trade requires hours of concentration.
In the lab, tasks demanding accuracy
in fine details, such as constructing
the impression of a human mouth,
improve the students skill and develop his patience. After his sophomore year, the dental student begins
treating patients in the dental clinic.
The clinic does not only give the student experience, but also offers free
dental care to those in the community
who cannot afford it.
                        NURSING
  After a broad background of study for two
years in the School of Liberal Arts, the Pitt junior
may elect to enter the School of Nursing for three
years. The nursing student practices her bedside
manner on dummies first. But soon she is faced
with live patients at Presbyterian, Children's and
Magee Hospitals. Her activities vary from reading
a fairy tale to a child with a broken leg, to working with a disturbed adolescent at West Psych.
After her usual eight to four day, the weary nursein-training travels home or back to the dorms to
watch Ben Casey on Channel 11.

PHARMACY
  On the fifth floor of Scaife Hall
students at the University's School of
Pharmacy don white jackets to work
with balances, mortars and pestles,
spatula and conical graduates to prepare their "scripts" for ointments,
emulsions, pills, capsules and powders. After four trimesters of liberal
arts, the pharmacy student begins his
studies aimed at becoming the drug
expert in the medical world. In the
small and tightly knit school future
pharmacists study all phases of their
profession, which prepare them for
possible work in a hospital or an industrial pharmaceutics company. Not
completing escaping from the banal,
each student must learn to design a
drug store just in case he ends up on
Main Street. Within the School exists
a circle of extracurricular activities
such as pharmaceutical fraternities
and the Pitt Capsule, the publication
of the students of the School of
Pharmacy.

GRADUATE
SCHOOLS
  To anyone attending a University commencement it
is obvious that education does not stop at the undergraduate level. The many hued hoods of those in the
procession are evidence of the graduate schools which
are an integral part of the University complex. The
liberal arts student has an opportunity to do advanced
work in practically any subject in the divisions of the
humanities, social sciences or natural sciences. The
Graduate Schools of Library Science, Social work and
most recently Public and International Affairs offer
subjects not usually dealt with on the undergraduate
level. The Schools of Medicine, Dentistry and Law, each
year continuing to gain the respect of the entire academic community, again trained their students in particular professional skills. Learning continued outside of
the classroom, as men gained increased knowledge
about their world through research at the University.
Long famed as a center for medical experimentation,
research has branched out into diverse fields such as
psychology and atomic energy.

  Extracurricular activities fulfill the essence of
the liberal education philosophy. They educate
without forcing the student to read books and
listen to lectures 24 hours a day. Students learn
various professional techniques, while working
with fellow students in an informal setting. Student publications Pjrovide experience in journalism, the various study groups give in-depth analyses of current issues, the debate team and political
groups demonstrate professional strategy, and the
myriad of special interest groups allow expression
of a wide range of opinions. Some campus organizations are barely existing with five or ten members, while others boast large memberships and
well attended meetings. Organizational interest
often reflects the common concerns of college students across the country. This year membership in
organizations working with civil rights and poverty
has grown steadily at Pitt. But the nearly one hundred recognized organizations on campus proves
there is an outlet for almost every interest, even if
it does not have widespread appeal.
Organizations
AIR FORCE ROTC
  The Air Force Reserve Officers Training Corps
aims to develop qualities of leadership in men
destined to serve as commissioned officers in the
United States Air Force upon graduation from the
University. Freshmen enrollment in this year's
program was the largest since the trimester began.
The University chose to adopt a new two-year
program to replace the existing four-year course.
With this change, students transferring from regional campuses can enroll in the program and
earn Air Force commissions on the Oakland campus.
  Cadets went on flights in Air Force aircraft and
trips to several Air Force bases. The Annual Parents' Night Awards and the Military Ball were
held in March. Arnold Air Society, honorary cadet
society, took part in the regional conclave at Penn
State and the national convention in Washington,
D.C. The Precision Drill Team, sponsored by the
Johnstown   College  sub-detachment won    high
praise in competitive meets.

The Cathedral of Learning
remains one of Pittsburgh's
educational landmarks and the
center of study for
undergraduates. Many
commuters who enter the
hallowed halls of the Cathedral
in the morning stay there the
entire day. Among the building's
more notable advantages are
hard wood seats, poor lighting,
and an abundance of privacy.
Commuters converge on the
ground floor. There they talk
about the football team, classes,
and spread the latest campus
gossip. There are days when
some students never get above
the Tuck Shop. After all, it's
easier to sip cokes than take
notes.
ALUMNI
ASSOCIATION
   The General Alumni Association is
 the graduate's continuing link with
 his alma mater. Because of the Asso ciation's belief that education does
 not end with a degree, the Alumni
 staff arranges for faculty speakers at
 meetings of the more than twenty Pitt
 Clubs throughout the country and at
 those of the Association's fourteen
 constituent groups. Continuing Edu cation Seminars on current topics are
 held on campus twice each year.
 This year, a system of class affilia tion for undergraduates has been in itiated with the Student Government.
 Class committees, to be recruited in
 the junior year, will plan and coor dinate class activities after gradua tion. Pitt, one of the top ten alumni
 magazines in the country, keeps all
 graduates informed about campus de velopments.
 Under the auspices of the Alumni
 Schools Program, alumni throughout
 the country meet prospective fresh men from their communities and ac quaint them with Pitt. Through the
 Annual Giving Fund, graduates help
 future generations of Pitt students by
 financial aid to the University. Other
 activities of the Alumni Association
 are Homecoming, annual trips to
Europe, the   Children's Christmas
Party, yearly reunions for graduates
of each school, and the Smorgasbord
of the June Reunion Week.

    The Engineering and Mines Cabi  net acts as the "student govern  ment" for the engineers at Pitt. The
  Cabinet is a   representative body
  whose members are elected by the
  students in each department within
  the School of Engineering and Mines.
    The organization orients its activi  ties to the specialized interests of en  gineers and co-ordinates the school's
  individual clubs and societies. The
  Cabinet sets up a committee which
  welcomes freshmen engineers each
  year. It sponsors social events such as
  this fall's picnic and the Winter So  cial. Members organize the activities
  during  Engineers Week   and   the
  Shamrock Ball.
    The Cabinet also promotes interde  partmental reports. The  engineers
  compete in six-man football, bowling,
  soft ball, and volleyball. The E&amp;M
  Bulletin, a weekly newspaper, is put
  together and published under the
  auspices of the Cabinet. The organ  ization presents the Outstanding Sen  ior Award, which recognizes excel  lence in Engineering, and the Emitt
  Award, which sends a junior to a for  eign country for a summer of work
  and travel.

  When    Heinz  Chapel was built
twenty-six years ago, the choir was to
be the official singing group for all
services held in the Chapel. Today,
the scope of activities and functions
for the choir has been significantly
widened. Enhancing the otherwise
mechanical atmosphere    at official
University events, the choir sings at
the Fall and Spring Convocations and
at the Chancellor's annual Christmas
Party. In addition, the choir's traditional Sunday morning service has
been revived after several years absence. Reaching out into the community, the choir brightened the hearts
of many unfortunate patients as they
caroled in their lavender robes at
local hospitals. During the year the
choir was successfully featured in
several concerts in the Pittsburgh
area. The annual Spring Tour was
again the most exciting part of the
year.

MEN'S DORM COUNCIL
  Although Men's Dorm Council is
only two years old, it has emerged as
one of the most effective and powerful governing groups on campus. Its
elected senators represent the men
living in the Towers dormitories, over
60%0/ of the University of Pittsburgh's
undergraduate men. MDC's program
includes Towers dances with local
entertainment, open houses, and interhouse competition  in all major
sports. This year guest speakers, including a representative from the National Association for the Advancement of White People, were held in
the dorm lounges. Prior to the West
Virginia football game, MDC organized all-night patrols to guard against
possible  vandalism. The    Council
passed resolutions for extended library hours, alternatives to the 21meal ticket, a reading period before
finals, installation of a barbershop in
the Towers, and fought to have a
larger section in Pitt Stadium set
aside for students.

                     MEN'S
        GLEE CLUB
  The Men's Glee Club, the oldest
student activity on campus, celebrated its 75th anniversary in grand
style. The club went international
with a November tour to Toronto,
Canada, and sang for a second time
at the New York World's Fair. In a
remarkable display   of patriotism,
they undertook a hectic 24 hour tour
to Washington, D.C. which featured
initiation of new members on the bus.
On campus the club gave its annual
Winter and Spring Concerts, the Winter Concert to a sell-out crowd, and
sang at the Pitt Previews.
  Under the direction of Emanuel
Rubin, the     club  broadened   its
repertoire to include tunes as diverse
as 13th century polyphonic alleluias
and selections from My Fair Lady.
The singing of English Glees remained popular, but some of the
Club's favorite songs were never
sung in concert. With membership on
the increase and an expanded concert
schedule, the club is looking forward
to a Gleeful future.

  The Pittsburgh       Oratory was
founded in the summer of 1961 by
His Excellency Bishop John J. Wright
to minister to the spiritual needs of
the students and faculty at the University. The Oratory supplants in
name the Newman Club and emphasizes the intellectual investigation of
religious questions. Study and prayer
groups are the center of activity for
the Oratory. They form the basis for
student inquiry and discussion.
  The organization sponsors religious
instructions for the children of the
faculty. This type of group work is
operated on an experimental basis,
concentrating on solving problems
unique to the education of children in
religion. Guest speakers are featured
in the series on preparation for marriage. Each talks on specialized aspects of marriage, such as child psychology, law, and health. The Oratory
Forum provides a monthly series of
lectures by speakers who attempt to
relate broad religious problems.
SKI CLUB
  The University of Pittsburgh Ski Club meets in
Schenley Hall for the planning and on the Western Pennsylvania slopes for the fun. The club is a
young and dynamic winter sports organization.
The purpose of the club is to provide an opportunity for those who ski and for those wishing to
learn, to pool their skills and enthusiasm for the
world's largest participation sport.
  Both   undergraduate  and   graduate  students
make up the seventy member club, with representatives from both the U. S. and Europe. Ski
lessons are offered by members who are certified
instructors.
  This year's activities included an ice skating
party and a weiner roast at North Park, a ski race
as a part of Winter Weekend, and a weekend at
Blue Knob in Bedford, Pennsylvania.

VARSITY MARCHING BAND
  The University of Pittsburgh Varsity Marching Band that appears at
all home football games, is an organization of approximately 110 men
who donate much of their time and
talent. After a week of pre-school
practice at Camp Kon-O-Kwee near
Zelionople, Penna., they give from
four to twelve hours per week to
practice for performances at pep rallies, football games, and an occasional off-campus appearance. The
only remuneration the men receive
for their efforts is the satisfaction in
doing a good job.
  Alpha Omega Chapter of Kappa
Kappa Psi, the national fraternity for
college bandsmen, is very active in
promoting spirit and comradeship in
the band. By providing awards for
the Outstanding Freshman, Outstanding Bandsman, and perfect attendance, they cause each member to
strive to do his best.
I
STUDENT GOVERNMENT
  At seven o'clock on Thursday evenings Student
Government meets in Room 306 of the Student
Union "to help YOU the student." Led by John
"I'll-take-care-of-it" Vrana, SG has 26 standing
committees to handle everything from Homecoming to Health Service complaints. New this year
was the Spirit Award, an evaluation of the posters, enthusiasm and decorum put forth by Greeks
and dorm houses during the football season.
  Much of Student Government's work takes the
form of proposals and resolutions which, while
frustrating and lacking concrete results, do serve
to focus the attention of students and administrators. This year SG tackled such things as cheating,
sales tax on textbooks, the $50 matriculation deposit, and an all-purpose I.D. card.

                  UNION
                  BOARD
  The Student Union is the "living
room of the college." The student
committee chairmen who govern this
marble-columned, split-level living
room kept it jumping with everything
from violin concerts to pinball machines. Its nationally-recognized program included Midday speakers such
as James Farmer of CORE and Ashley Montagu, the opening of the
Cub's Den in the Union basement,
ragtime music with Max Morath, a
lively jazz series, and the second and
most successful Winter Weekend. In
October, the Student Union Board
was host to the Association of College  Unions' national conference,
capped by the election of their own
Sherree Merenstein as national secretary. The Board is a close, jolly group,
and in their new, fourth floor offices
they threw   darts, stored life-size
dummies in the john, held a fried
chicken picnic on a rainy day, and
sang "The Barry Nudelman Fight
Song" late into the night.

  WILLIAM PITT
DEBATE UNION
  William Pitt Debate Union is something like the
intellectuals' football team. With its rugged
schedule of 500 debates, in which frosh and varsity teams appear before a total audience of
45,000 people and make 40 trips, it is comparable
to a major sport. High school debating stars are
even enticed with scholarships. Highlights of the
1964-65 season were the 17th Annual Crossexamination Tournament held at Pitt which involved 40 visiting schools, and a parliamentary
debate program drawing speakers from outside
the University community and bringing Oxford
University here. In an exchange debate with the
West Indies, the topic was "That the Alliance for
Progress is a Farce" and after defending that
position in the English nationality room of the
Cathedral, WPDU sent two debaters to Jamaica.
Directed by Dr. Robert Neuwman, the debate
team carried Pitt's fame as far as the West Indies,
Los Angeles, and Canada.
WOMEN'S
CHORAL
   Three times a week a group of Uni versity women gathers in a room on
 the ninth floor of the Cathedral for
 several hours of singing rehearsal.
 Under the direction of Dr. Donald
 Colton, they work on their tone or
 timing, and at the same time enjoy a
 thorough acquaintance with excellent
 compositions from Brahms to Bern stein.
   In the fall the Women's Choral,
 along with Men's Glee Club, traveled
 north to Camp Lutherland for a
 weekend of concentrated practice.
 After the work sessions there was re laxation with guitar strumming and
 folk singing. In December, the Choral
 and the Men's Glee Club joined
 forces again to give the traditional
 Winter Concert.

ALPHA EPSILON DELTA
  AED is a national pre-medical honorary; students with a 3.0 Q.P.A. and
plans to enter medicine or dentistry
are eligible for membership. With Jay
Adlersberg coordinating activities and
Warren Coax keeping members informed, AED    bustled through its
second year since re-activation at the
University of Pittsburgh. Its film and
lecture series, "Advances in Medicine," guided by Harold Bloomfield
and David Fleishman, continued to
draw  crowds. Students with nonmedical majors came to hear about
open heart surgery, heredity, Harvey
and Pasteur, and child development.
On Saturday mornings members
could go to St. Francis Hospital to get
a first-hand look at pre- and postoperative techniques with Drs. Coon,
Feather and Murphy. Tours of Pitt
Medical School and St. Francis Hospital, the initiation banquet, guest lecturers, advising pre-med students and
sitting in on classes at the Medical
School kept the AED's busy this
year.

                        Thirty-three years ago Cwens, an
                      honorary for sophomore women, was
                      founded at Pitt by twelve sophomore
                      girls and their Dean of Women, along
                      with Helen Poole Rush who was then
                      Associate Dean of Women. Today it
                      has become a national society. The
                      University of Pittsburgh taps to mem                      bership women who have completed
                      one to three terms with a 3.0 Q.P.A.,
                      participated in freshman  activities
                      and shown themselves to "represent
                      the ideals of college women." This
                      year the Cwens held a discussion
                      meeting with Dean Rush and another
                      with Allan Schlosser, a political sci                      ence student. At their Founder's Day
                      dinner, alumna Cwens were greeted
                      by present members. Professor Law                      rence Lee of the English Department
                      was a special guest. Two Pitt Cwens
                      were sent to the National Convention
                      in Louisville, Kentucky. "Cwens" is
                      an Anglo-Saxon word meaning
                      "queens," and the organization turns
                      to medieval times for color and ritual.
DRUIDS
  Druids is the honorary leadership and activities
fraternity which recognizes sophomore and first
term junior men for their outstanding achievements in the area of student activities and scholarship. The Delta Chapter of Druids at the University of Pittsburgh looks beyond mere membership
in an organization and attempts to select only
those students who have demonstrated both the
capacity for constructive and effective leadership,
and the ability to maintain a competent academic
record. In addition to this function of recognition
of achievement, Druids also seeks to propagate
among the undergraduate men at Pitt those ideals
of leadership, scholarship, service and character
which denote the outstanding student. The Druids
active membership also includes many outstanding administrative and faculty members.
  The executive committee of Druids works diligently each term to insure the membership a full
program of events, including distinguished speakers from within the University and elsewhere. The
advisor to Druids is Mr. Jack Critchfield.

ETA
KAPPA
NU
  Eta Kappa Nu is the national electrical honor society. Its primary purposes are to provide leadership in the
engineering department and to promote and reward scholarship. With
these goals in mind, the Beta Delta
Chapter has begun an annual EE faculty  evaluation  through  questionnaires distributed to students in the
department. Out of this has come the
creation of an award for the department's outstanding new  instructor.
The society's tutoring program has
also been broadened in an effort to
aid as many students as possible. In
addition, awards are given to the outstanding senior and sophomore in the
department each year.
  The society taps its members from
the top quarter of the junior class and
the top third of the senior class. Willingness to serve is an important criterion for final initiation. The semiannual initiation banquets afford an
opportunity to meet fellow members
from Carnegie Tech and the local
alumni chapter.

    Learning does not merely mean note taking,
        listening to lectures, and reading books.
 Learning means a challenge, and this challenge
   is thrust at students in laboratory classes. It is
         here that the student sees the practical
  application of "book learning." In labs original
    thought literally runs loose. Whether mixing
    chemicals, dissecting frogs, or experimenting
 with a mechanical apparatus, these two to four
hour ventures give an opportunity for individual
  research. But to many, labs are merely another
    part of the "Distribution of Studies" trauma.
       They take them because they must. Their
   problems are compounded by nausea, stained
              hands, dirty clothes, and hours of
                         back-breakin'g labor.
INSTITUTE OF ELECTRICAL ENGINEERS
  The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers is a recently formed organization. It is the
result of the joining on the national level of the
Institute of Radio Engineers and the American Institute of Electrical Engineers. The two organizations have had branches at Pitt for several years,
and now the I.E.E.E. student membership is well
over one hundred. Nationally, the I.E.E.E. is one
of the largest technical organizations in the United
States.
  The constitution of the I.E.E.E. defines its purposes as scientific, literary and educational. The                           I
groups' activities are aimed at the advancement
of theory and practice in electrical engineering,
electronics, radio and allied branches of engineering arts and sciences.

MORTAR BOARD
  Mortar Board is a national honor
society of women who have shown
scholastic aptitude, displayed leadership ability and have indicated a willingness to serve their University.
  Because the members felt that
there was a lack of communication
between the student body and the administration, the 1964-1965 chapter
decided to act as a general clearinghouse for information concerning the
programs offered at the University. In
October, members served as aides at
the Career and Graduate School Conference. Mortar Board proposed a file
of permanent photocopied    recommendations in order that graduates
could obtain them for jobs and graduate schools years after graduation. A
letter to the Editor of the Pitt News
was published in which Mortar Board
stated that the student body was not
aware of the honors programs existing at the University.

       KAPPA
  ODK acknowledges junior and senior men in the upper third of their
class who have made notable contributions to the University. Professors
who have shown leadership and interest in scholarship, athletics, student government, religious affairs,
publications and forensics are invited
to join, along with outstanding upperclassmen.
  ODK men hear guest speakers from
within the University and from the
community and discuss subjects at
their bi-monthly luncheon meetings.
Alumni are greeted each year by present members at the Founder's Day
Dinner held at the Webster Hall Hotel.
  When the large wooden key appears three times a year on the Cathedral lawn, those men who have
excelled in scholarship and service
are initiated into this national fraternity. Tap Day in March acclaims the
outstanding  graduating  senior  as
"Man of the Year."

PHI

SIGMA
  Phi Eta Sigma, the National Freshman Scholastic Honor Fraternity, taps those full-time men students who achieve a 3.5 quality point average for
their first trimester, or who earn a 3.5 cumulative
Q. P. A. during their first year at Pitt. In addition
to recognizing academic excellence, the fraternity's aim is to "foster scholarship and the free
exchange of ideas." Working toward this- goal,
Phi Eta Sigma offers group and individual tutoring
programs which aid on the average of 400 students each year. The fraternity is also responsible
for the free distribution of the helpful and informative pamphlets provocatively entitled "Hints on
How to Study." The activities of Phi Eta Sigma
are not confined to the Oakland campus alone.
Members are working on the Johnstown, Bradford,
Titusville, and Greensburg campuses as well. In
the belief that scholarship should be global in
scope, the fraternity co-sponsored the International Students Committee's Brother-Sister Program.

SIGMA TAU
  Sigma Tau is a national honorary
fraternity recognizing junior and senior men with a Q.P.A. of 3.0 or higher
in the School of Engineering and                                               4      W
Mines. The recommendation of at
least one member of the school's fac-                                       i
ulty is also a requirement for election
into Sigma Tau. The purpose of the
honorary is to promote scholarship
and engineering ethics, and to recognize outstanding achievement in the
various fields of engineering. Tappees
are required to participate in projects,
such as finishing pyramids, completing pledge books and getting signatures of the actives. Each year an
award is given to the sophomore who
had the highest Q.P.A. in his freshman class. Funds have been appropriated for the construction of a large
pyramid to represent the academic
and professional ideals of the engineering student. This pyramid, the
symbol of Sigma Tau, will stand in
front of the new engineering building   c. Younkin, T. Anderson, J. Rixner, R. Kubovcik, D. Bazilwich, R. Whitfield, D. Carney,

QUAX
  Quax is perhaps the oldest women's honorary
on campus. The aim of the organization is to encourage women in scientific studies and in the furthering of their careers through graduate school.
Sophomore status, an overall 3.00 Q.P.A. and a
major in an area of science are the requirements
for membership. The name "Quax" stands for
the quest for unity in attaining the unknown-X. In
the fall, a tea was held for sophomore women science majors in order to introduce them to Quax
and its aims. Dr. James Voss of the psychology
department spoke at the meeting. A picture series
was recently initiated. The purpose of this is to
bring lecturers who will speak to the members on
a more sophisticated level concerning various fields
of science. Mrs. Hubert Klein spoke to the members on the integration of a career in science and
marriage.

                         Publications
  A new person around the student union can't
wander too far down the hall of the fourth floor
without realizing that this is the place housing
student publications. The clatter of typewriter
keys and shouts of "How are we going to fill page
four?" can become hideously familiar sounds to
one venturing in this area. Although there are
hours of stress and strain around deadlines, for
the most part the publications act as springboards
from which student creativity can be launched.
Nof limited to writing, the publications demand
photographers to help with the picture essays in
the Owl or a flash for the Pitt News. The imaginative pen of an artist is also needed for an illustration of a story in Ideas and Figures. In all probability there is no place in the Student Union
where so much time is spent by the students, so
many brains picked and so much accomplished.

PITT NEWS
  The Pitt News is the fulcrum of
whatever political weight students
have at the University. Outside news
media scan its front page for fastbreaking scandal and thus bring the
pressure of publicity to bear on campus problems. The editorial page has
a standing appointment with the administration for airing grievances and
making suggestions, an appointment
that thousands of readers look in on.
  With three full-size editions a
week, the hard-pressed news editors
had more newspaper to put out this
year than ever before. But with those
ever-ready features, curb-cut photos,
and ads for priofreaders, the paper
was filled somehow. The Pi Delt Convention in Chicago was termed a
"smashing success," a Profanity Index was instituted to tabulate degrees
of emotional control at the layout
desk, and The Society for the Prevention of the Demolition of Gustine's (SPDG) was formed.

THE OWL
  Like every other publication, the OWL is the product of the work of
many people, most of which goes unrecognized. Every year a group of
students come together, meet and go their separate ways. For every
word printed, thirty are written and rewritten. For every picture used,
twelve are taken. A.business staff struggles to keep the book in the
black and another staff organizes senior portraits. The myriad of activity is organized and co-ordinated by an editor and-business manager
on whose shoulders the final responsibility for the book lies. The end
product is an OWL, a 320 page critical record of a year displayed in
pictures and prose. For those who create the book the blank paper and
unexposed film that are the beginning of every publication, are the challenge of a year. It is a year filled with Spike's four inch carpet, George's
gag gift at the Park Schenley, a resounding victory over the Pitt News
in the annual Bird Bath Bowl, and playing host to a national Pi Delt
convention. It is a year of late copy, fuzzy pictures, and missed deadlines. Like all publications the crises large and small are passed and the
final product, the sum total of all the separate tasks, is proudly published by a staff who knew all along that it would be worth it.
IDEAS AND
FIGURES
  Ideas and Figures, a magazine of the liberal
arts, personifies creativity and imagination to the
student mind of the University. Employing all the
tools the graphic arts offer, the magazine effectively co-ordinates illustration with prose. Not
limiting itself to simple pictures, I &amp; F turns the
opening pages into op art. A delicate poem on
Africa will be complimented by a photograph of
some young boys staring at elephants feeding
themselves. Nationally it is recognized as one of
the finest college literary magazines. This year Pi
Delta Epsilon, national journalism fraternity, selected it as being the best in its field. But what is
creativity to the average University    student?
Obviously not much. It's easier to find an unbought copy of I &amp; F on the fourth floor of
Schenley Hall than it is to find an extra piece of
typewriter paper.

SKYSCRAPER
ENGINEER
  Published six times per year, the
Skyscraper Engineer is the official
undergraduate publication  of the
School of Engineering and Mines.
Under the editorship of Ralph Smith,
the magazine gives students an opportunity to write articles on technical subjects such as saline water
conversion and soldering with infrared heat. News of the engineering
school like the plans for the new engineering complex on O'Hara Street
is also included. On the lighter side
there are pictures in each issue,of the
Techni-cutie of the month or an annual spread on the Engineering and
Mines picnic. Slips of the Stick, a
sampling of jokes with a special
appeal to engineers, rounds out the
magazine.

        which is published three times a year, are news
        articles on happenings at the School of Pharmacy
        as well as articles of a purely professional nature
        which might deal with anything from aerosol phar        maceuticals to the wetting agent in a personal de        odorant powder spray. Descriptions of new drugs,
        reports from pharmaceutical conventions and fea        tures on pharmaceutical class happenings are

POLARIS
  A steno-pad sized book with modern shapes of
green, purple and blue on its white cover were the
signs of a 1964-65 Polaris. The Polaris serves
many essential purposes, such as providing men
with pictures of the new     crop of freshman
women. Practically anything you might want to
know about the University is inside the book.
Names and addresses of Greek organizations, a
listing of chief administrative personnel, major
events of the campus year and a history of the
University are all listed in the book. Besides all
the information, the Polaris provides its buyer
with a calendar which has important dates and
leaves space to write down other reminders. For
the first time, the Polaris ceased to be a Student
Government sponsored activity and now comes
under the jurisdiction of the Office of Student
Publications.

operates sixty hours per week. The
entertainment revolves around the individual personalities of the disc
jockeys. Most all types of music are
represented catering to a broad spectrum of interests.
  The station maintains a large news
organization which compiles and reports campus, national and international news with the help of U.P.I.
The staff presents interviews with
personalities discussing matters of
special interest. Occasional editorials
are delivered such as the statement
pertaining to the Allegheny Observatory dilemma. A coverage and commentary on the death of Sir Winston
Churchill was one of several documentaries. WPGH covers live all Pitt
basketball and baseball games.

Greeks
  A bejeweled gold badge, a sweat shirt with
blatant decorations, a few Greek letter decals on
the back window of a sports car or a place to go
for lunch after an 11 o'clock class-to the outsider
these are the things which make up the fraternity
world. But to the Greek, the one who has lived,
learned and grown with his brothers there is
much more. "You can take away my pin, you can
take away my frat house and I still have a fraternity," one Greek once said. How true. The warmth,
the friendship, the sharing of happiness and
tragedy continued between brothers and sisters is
an irreplaceable part of the University's student
community. Evident everywhere on campus, the
Greeks could be clearly seen as having a special
kind of closeness that was more than friendshipif one was willing to look.

 Bringing subject matter to life
   before a student is a difficult
     task, so difficult that many
professors don't even try it. It is
    a rare man, indeed, who can
stimulate his students to greet a

     unusual a man to make the
         poetic lines of William

PHI EPSILON PI
  The position of Phi Epsilon Pi on
campus has been significantly strengthened in the past year. With its pledge
class of 42 men, Phi Ep has moved to
the top of the Greeks in numbers, and
its strength has been reflected in IF
sports with firsts in football, softball,
swimming, bowling, and volleyball.
  It has also been a year of Phi Ep at
Pitt. Phi Ep men were involved in Pitt
Preview. With its booth during Winter Weekend, Phi Ep has continued
its support of Pitt Activities. This
support included varsity sports where
members compete in soccer, baseball
and basketball.
  But fraternally, Phi Epsilon Pi has
shone the brightest. With a deeply interested and active senior class, Phi
Ep has moved to a greater enjoyment
of what fraternity means. The fine social events have only acted as a
happy balance to the cultural and
community activities.

DELTA SIGMA PHI
  Delta Sigma Phi is dedicated to the principle of
engineered leadership. In practice this means that
the fraternity tries to create a diversified program
which reflects all facets of the college experience.
With a strong membership, an active intramural
and social program has been maintained, and
brothers participate in all types of University activities.
  Delta Sigs have a reputation for participation in
varsity athletics, for there are members on the
football, basketball, baseball, wrestling, golf,
swimming and gymnastic teams. Delta Sigma Phi
also has men in Student Government, Student
Union Board, Engineering Cabinet, IFC, and other
student activities.
  To encourage academic excellence, the alumni
association provides a scholarship incentive program for the brothers and pledges. The chapter
also maintains a scholarship program of its own
which features such guest speakers as Judge
Aldicer of the Pennsylvania State Supreme Court.

  Wherever there was a Delt this        DELTA              TAU         DELTA
year, there was both noise and activity. For some people this is the
road to insanity, but for 60 years this
has been a winning formula for Delta
Tau Delta at the University of Pittsburgh. Loud sometimes, there are moments of great enthusiasm, at the
Bowery Ball or at the Delt Winter
Weekend. Flashy too, but there are
quiet moments as well, at the Faculty
Tea, or at the Delt Formal.
  Every Delt is one-tenth seriousness
and nine-tenths energy. The fall
pledge class added a certain sparkle
to the chapter and their initiation
banquet was an outstanding occasion.
  Whether playing bridge in the Tuck
Shop, or sitting respectably in the
University Club listening to brother
Clark speak at the sixtieth anniversary dinner, life is never dull. For a
Delt there is always something to do,
somewhere to go, something to try.

  For Delta Iota Delta, this was another successful year. Once again the physical education program for the exceptional children of Saint Anthony's school was organized. The fall and winter
pledge classes painted the house, put a new floor
into the kitchen, enlarged the "Passion Pitt,"
and presented the chapter with a stereo. Social
activities included the North Park skating party,
the Halloween party, the formal Christmas party,
and weekend Hootenannys with Jim playing the
guitar and singing. The all-round Homecoming
Trophy was awarded to the chapter. D.I.D. also
participated in the independent intramural sports
program.
  Matters other than social occupied the chapter
members. D.I.D. will be joining the Interfraternity
Council next year. At the present, the chapter is
debating whether or not to become nationally
affiliated. The March elections for new officers
presented still another important decision.

PI LAMBDA PHI
   Starting off to the tune of "Waltzing Matilda," the past year proved to
be an outstanding one for Pi Lambda
Phi. In   addition  to   the  regular
"theme" p a r t i e s which normally
make up the social calendar, the big
event of the past year was a two and
a half day winter weekend at a ski
lodge in the Laurel Mountains. Brothers and dates had a great time since
they were able to escape for a few
days and forget about school. This
weekend rounded out the social calender for the year, which was concluded by Greek Week, when the Pi
Lams won the Greek Sing title for the
second consecutive year.
  In the fall an enthusiastic class
beat arch-rival Phi Ep's pledge class
in football for the second year, and
for the rest of the year, the "varsity"
athletes scored impressive victories
in all major inter-fraternity athletic
events.

SIGMA
ALPHA
EPSILON
  Phi Alpha Alicazee, I'm pledged to dear old
SAE-and for Sigma Alpha Epsilon, the fall of
1964 meant one of the largest pledge classes on
campus. For pledges and brothers there was the
basement to work on, and as always the lions
which guard the house needed guarding themselves. Finally, initiation and a whole new set of
brothers; all that sand and hay was worth it after
all.
  With strategic headquarters located at the E&amp;A,
and new neighbors on the block, the life of an
SAE was never dull. "Teas" with sororities, staying up all night for Homecoming and Greek Week,
parties in the basement, and the click of pool balls
lasting far into the night. Greek Week and Founders Day together again? Oh, well, maybe next
year. The hand of brotherhood from an old grad,
and free drinks at the University Club; all part of
a college education.

  The traditional Sammy jammees with kegs and
J. C., the Founders' Day dinner dance at the Le
Mont, Nancy Wilson, roller skating, and the
Homecoming open house, that ended things for a
while, were all part of the social program of Sigma
Alpha Mu this year.
  With a membership enlarged by thirty new
members, the product of a very successful rush,
the Sammies entered all intramural sports and
maintained their reputation. A last minute scurry
and a little hard work won first place in the
Homecoming banner competition. There was progress on all fronts of Dithridge too; the house was
painted, a parking lot added, the front steps were
safe once again, and the bear's den was remodeled. As always, there were Sammies everywhere
in extra-curricular activities: Hep, Pitt Preview,
football, Engineer's Week, Pitt Band, WPGH
Homecoming Committee, Student Government.
But even with all the extra work, there was still
time to "make grades."

                         COUNCIL
  Panhellenic Council acts as a coordinating and
governing  body   for all nationally  affiliated
women's social fraternities at the University. Its
purposes are to maintain the continued degree of
excellence in sorority life, to cooperate with the
administration, to promote interfraternity relations and to work with other campus organizations to further sound scholarship. On questions
concerning policies for rush, open houses, or ideas
for philanthropic projects, suggestions were heard
from every sorority, and through the help of the
individual chapters, it was possible to make wise
decisions. In the fall, Panhel sponsors Panhellenic
Prevue to introduce incoming women students to
sorority life. Social activities for the year included
a Christmas party in the Student Union lounge
and an evening concert given by the Men's and
Women's Glee Clubs. The highlight of the social
calendar is held in February when all sororities on
campus sponsor the Panhel Ball honoring the new
pledges of their groups.

ALPHA DELTA PI
  Armed with scissors, paint brushes
and magic markers, the sisters of
Alpha Delta Pi spent their fall afternoons whipping    out banners for
every Pitt football game. While making banners the ADPi's were also involved in miracle spinach diets to get
in shape for the season; another vigorous activity was the "borrowing"
of the SAE lions. They quit the diet
at the first birthday party of the year
for their housemother Mrs. Montey,
and the SAE's now have their lions
on their front porch where they belong. ADPi then concentrated on their
traditional Black and White Formal
and rush. By January ten pledges
joined the ADPi sisters. Besides their
riotous social life the ADPi's contribute to campus life in: Associated
Women    Students, Student Union
Board and Pitt Players. They belong
to Mortar Board, and are senior assistants.

CHI OMEGA
  Chi Omega climaxed their athletic
season by playing the Circle K men's
club in football and losing 6 to 0. The
low score of the Circle K's shows Chi
O determination which spreads into
many areas. They are active in a
score of campus activities from a Chi
O ski weekend at Laurel Mountain to
membership in Phi Beta Kappa. Chi
O's are debaters, members of Quo
Vadis, mentors, Senior Assistants and
members of the Greek Week committee. Chi O's contributed to community life by visiting the St. Paul's Orphanage as part of their charity project for the year. One of Chi O's contributions to the campus is active
staff members of the Pitt News.
Working with Sigma Chi fraternity
won them third place in the Homecoming banner contest. Chi O's own
chapter activities included a successful fall and winter rush, an overnight
party at the home of one of the actives, t e a s, guest speakers and
dances.

  UNIVERSITY
OF PITTSBURGH
   LIBRARY
  The most dynamic professor can be a flop
without a good audience. This doesn't mean
   a good class. It may only mean one good
   student. That one student must be alert,
       and he must be willing to accept the
     challenge his professor puts forth. In a
chemistry classthimigbmean research. It
   might mean extra reading for an English
   class. In any case, the hours spent in the
classroom are among the most significant in
  the learning process. Some manage to get
  by without; but those who do are merely
     depriving themselves of the chance to
                       enrich their lives.
DELTA DELTA DELTA
  The sisters of Delta Delta Delta sorority began
the year with a planning meeting at Parcell Grove.
Rush parties, tea dances and various service
projects were scheduled. Fifteen pledges were
taken during the year. They were initiated during
an impressive ceremony in Heinz Chapel. This
was the first time such an initiation had been conducted. Members of the Tri Delt have always been
active in the Panhellenic Association and in other
campus affairs. Many girls were mentors or senior
assistants. Social activities included tea dances
with Sigma Alpha Epsilon, Sigma Chi and Delta
Tau Delta. Linda Theofel was a candidate for
Homecoming Queen. At their annual winter formal, held this year at the Mona Lisa, Tom Baily
was named "My Tri Delt Man." The sisters enjoyed an overnight party at the Kiefa home in
Murrysville. In March, the election of new officers
was held. The Tri-Delts are now looking forward
to another successful year.

KAPPA KAPPA GAMMA
  Gamma Epsilon chapter at Pitt
opened the year by moving into their
new house at 4401 Bayard Street. Immediately following the unofficial
house opening came formal dedication attended by national officers,
alumnae and students. The Kappas
then settled down to prepare for a
good academic year and campus
functions. Prior to Homecoming the
Kappas made banners for the football
games and tried to boost school spirit.
The spirit contribution for the Homecoming game     was Bonnie    Ross,
Homecoming queen finalist. All during these activities Kappa rushed
Freshmen girls acquainting them with
sorority life, sorority house living,
and university life in general. Rushing ended in January when Kappas
took their Winter pledge class. On
the calendar for the Winter trimester
were such annual events as the
Kappa formal, the Kappa-Delt reception for faculty and students, the
Kappa after Panhel party, the motherdaughter tea and participation in
many campus activities by individual
Kappas.

FOOTBALL
   In the 1964 football season the Pitt Panthers
proved that things can be done in pairs. They
opened the season by losing two games; then they
won two games; and for anyone who still doubted
their couple-bility, the Panthers tied two games. A
moral victory against the Irish, two losses, and
another win altered the pattern and ended the
year.
  A maze of equipment for nationwide TV coverage and 41,000 fans maneuvered into Pitt Stadium
for the season's first game. What they saw was
not what they had hoped for. UCLA showed Fred
Mazurek that he no longer had the line protection
which would allow him to tie his shoe before he
passed the ball. To add to Pitt's trouble, Freddy
was knocked out of the game in the third quarter
by a UCLA tackle after completing six of eight
passes. He returned in the last two minutes but
had little luck in solving the 17-12 problem. The
greatest success of the game was had by the Pi
Lam's who sent thirty giant balloons and a spirit
sign into the air.
  The Panthers went west with hope, but returned with disgust. Oregon had turned what appeared to be last year's brand of football into a
second loss. Pitt rushed as if Oregon were an excellent high school team and gained almost two
hundred yeards more than its opponent. Marty
Schottenheimer appeared to be tackling two at a
time aniTDennis Bernick proved his ability to play
first string ball. All went well until the fans got up
for a second Coke and Pitt's luck left the stadium.
Dale Stewart crossed the goal line for a touchdown in the third quarter, but the referee announced that he had fumbled the ball before he
went into the end zone. Later, after Pitt had
scored, Coach Michelosen tried for two points to
make it 14-13, but the strong Pitt line folded and
Mazurek was thrown back to the five yard line.
For Pitt fans wringing their hands by their latenight radios, it was like a day-time serial. The
climactic episode came when Eric Crabtree intercepted a pass and stormed through the Oregon
squad for an 80 yard touchdown. Things had finally come into place-except Pitt was called for
being offside. Pitt played the game, but Oregon
won it, 22-13.
  The William and Mary team arrived at Pitt Stadium with a lump in their throat and left knowing
the reason why. Pitt left no play or player untried.
Injury was the only reason a Pitt player didn't see
action sometime during the game. The Panthers
made mistakes. They fumbled the ball and
dropped passes. This detracted little their 34-7
victory, in which Fred Mazurek recorded a total
offense of 228 yards. Twelve was a magic number

for Pitt. In twelve plays Crabtree, Mazurek, and
McKnight engineered an 87 yard touchdown. The
second squad used the same number of plays to
go 86 yards and score. It seemed that Coach
Michelosen had only to point toward the goal line
and his team moved the ball.
  The Panthers gained their second win of the
season on a sunny October Saturday at home
when they beat West Virginia 14-0 by scoring two
touchdowns in the first half of the game. The
Mountaineers failed to move the ball past the Pitt
38 yard line. The second half of the game was a
defensive battle in which nothing more exciting
than the changing of the numbers on the electric
clock took place.
  The Panthers' southern holiday in Miami ended
in disappointment. The Hurricanes of the University of Miami had a 13-0 lead before Pitt scored.
The game was a sports spectacular as the Pitt
team came from behind twice, but a missed conversion attempt forced the Panthers to settle for a
20-20 tie.
  The Panthers played football like a reversed
firecracker in their home game against Navy. They
exploded in the first quarter. Crabtree ran 50
yards and McKnight plunged over the goal line.
Pitt then got the ball on a disputed punt recovery
which required a rereading of the rule book and
McKnight gained two yards for the touchdown.
This lit the fuse of the firecracker and Pitt sputtered for the remaining three quarters without
scoring. Navy managed to earn 14 points and the
game ended in a tie.
  The Orange of Syracuse University had the
Panthers seeing red. Even Pitt's new  spread
offense with Mazurek as a flanker back couldn't
offset Syracuse's strong running attack and hardnosed defense. The Orangemen's big line opened
holes through Pitt's walking wounded to let their
backs score. Pitt suffered its third defeat, over national TV, 21-6.
  November 7, 1964, could have been the day that
Notre Dame massacred Pitt. The Irish might have
worried the Panthers when they completed a rare

91 yard pass play-but they didn't. Pitt played an
inspired football game against a team which was
ranked first in the nation. In the third quarter the
Panthers moved the ball 80 yards for a touchdown. Barry McKnight alone gained more yards
rushing than had many entire teams who faced
the Irish during the season. Panther Captain Ray
Popp called the game a moral victory and a satisfied Pitt team carried Coach Michelosen off the
field after a 17-15 defeat.
  The Panthers rolled into West Point's Michie
Stadium like a Sherman tank and defeated Army
24-8. Pitt controlled the game both offensively and
defensively. Jim Jones started the scoring when he
kicked a 37-yard field goal. Then Freddy Mazurek,
who had a perfect six for six passing record, and
the other Pitt backs took over. Army was forced
to wait until the last minutes to score.
  The season's biggest mistake was played at
Beaver Stadium on the frozen afternoon of November 21. State's great running squad gained
yards any way they wanted-fullback smashes inside the tackles, halfback sweeps, and inside scissors plays. The final score was Penn State 28, Pitt
0.
  The season was not the Christmas package that
Pitt fans experienced with last year's 9-1 record.
Last year's line graduated and this year's line
limped. The record-setter was Fred Mazurek, who
has the second largest total offense in Pitt's history. One thing was sure-no one had to sit up
nights worrying about a bowl bid.

CROSS COUNTRY
  While the miracle that had been Pitt football
slid into the Good Old Days, another miracle was
taking place quietly, crowded aside by talk of a
quarterback who had suddenly gone lackluster.
The cross-country team, after plodding through
five straight losing seasons, had suddenly come to
life like hounds who've picked up the scent. The
season began with a 15-50 scaling of Slippery
Rock followed by an upset victory over powerful
Ohio University. And when the season was over,
the team stood 6-0 with its first perfect record in
memory. The man behind the miracle was head
coach Jim Banner, who had never coached a collegiate cross-country team before. He fired his
team with a spirit that had been absent for years.
Our harriers began working together like a welloiled machine-something indeed rare in Pitt athletics.
  There were no standouts on the team; instead,
it had good depth headed by senior captain John
Bailey and juniors Damien Koch and Dave Eichenlaub. Bailey and Koch jockeyed for the number
one spot, but the team was solid enough to pick
up three of its six wins without winning first
place. Close behind the top three were sophomores Frank Handelman, Fran Shor, and Larry
Hubner, and junior Don Hinchberger. In the Penn
State meet only sixteen seconds separated the
first and fifth finishers for Pitt, and they ran the
best team time ever recorded on the home course
at Schenley Park.
  Pitt's runners defeated Penn State for the first
time in ten years, and a 20-35 win over West Virginia ended seven years of bad luck with the
Mountaineers. When they triumphed over the
Ohio U. team which later finished third in the
NCAA finals, Coach Banner attributed the upset
to the unexpectedness of Pitt's strong running.
  For the first time, Pitt sent a full team to the
IC4A championships where it finished a respectable 9th, and then on to place 17th among 45 teams
in the NCAA championship race at Michigan
State University.
  The 5-5 record of the soccer team was a sharp
disappointment to its few, but avid, fans. The
1964 season was to be the first full harvest of the
active recruiting of high school players which began three years before with the scholarship aid
Coach Leo Bemis had finally won from the administration. But some of the sophomores and juniors
that were counted on were disqualified academically or left school. And then, against sophisticated NCAA teams, Pitt players often lacked the
savvy that comes only from years in the game.
The coach had to use goalies, for instance, who
had learned the basic skills only a year before.
  However, the main reason for the loss of five
games in the middle of the season was psychological letdown. The spirit and integrated play that
showed in practice and the first few      games
seemed to evaporate.
  The season was not quite as bland as the.500
performance indicated, however. It started well
with convincing wins over Frostburg and Howard,
two teams that make up for lack of finesse in ball
handling with tough, aggressive play, and a brisk,
well-played loss to West Chester. Grove City was
considered to be a respite in the schedule, but
erratic play on an unfamiliar field led to a demoralizing defeat. The squad could not seem to recover its poise for the important game with Maryland, and a second-half drive failed to overcome
the first-half deficit. With losses to Akron and
Bucknell, the season slumped to a total failure.
Against Ohio University and West Virginia, the
offense flashed the scoring potential predicted for
it and totaled ten goals in the two losing games.
  Just hours before the final match with Penn
State the Pitt News' analysis of the dismal season
came out. The players read it while they dressed
at the Field House:
  "The Soccer players respect their coach like
William Steinberg respects the Beatles... The
players will nod their heads when Bemis tells
them what to do... Then go out onto the field
and play the best they can... The soccer team is
so demoralized now, that before the game with
Penn State one of them said,'The only way we'll
win is if they don't show up."
  Shaken up, the squad rallied for a dedicated
victory over State, with a stunned Shimpeno playing his greatest. The emotional team carried their
coach off the field.
SOCCER
   Coach Bob Timmons' dream team left and bas ketball took an about face as the hoopsters earned
 a 6-17 mark compared to the 1964 team's 17-8 rec ord. Timmons lost his entire starting team. The
 loss was too much and Timmons' inconsistent re cruiting failed to produce players to fill the gap.
 The hoopsters lacked speed, rebounding, and
 shooting prowess, making their record a matter of
 predestination. The early season showed slight
 promise as Pitt downed VPI and then lost to Rick
 Barry and Miami of Florida, finishing second in
 the Steel Bowl. But after that, the squad settled
 down. They occasionally beat such powers as
 Carnegie Tech and Westminster to break the
 monotony of steady losses. Timmons received
 sharp criticism that his non-aggressive recruiting
 policy had caused the dilemma. His answer was
 that he recruited as a gentleman and not as a pro fessional like many other schools. Athletic Direc tor Frank Carver backed Timmons saying that
many of the team's opponents had lower academic standards and more athletic funds.

BASKETBALL

  The learning process doesn't stop once
the bell rings. The exchange of ideas goes
on, even as students leave the classroom.
Sometimes, though, a person has to get the
ideas down in his own mind before he can
even begin an exchange with others. That's
why many take time to just sit, and to think
about what was said. For others, the end of
a classroom day signifies fighting traffic on
the way home. Or it may mean the hot meal
in the cafeteria. It may also be a time to just
take a walk and talk about little things, like
motor scooters and sports cars.

WRESTLING
   Wrestling fell from its perennial
spot as the school's only consistently
good team. Six of the eight starting
wrestlers were seniors, but their experience netted them a meager 4-6
record. Mike Johnson led the list of
disappointments. A knee injury kept
him out of four meets, and he lost his
first collegiate match. Johnson's
sporadic performances and the usual
lack of heavyweights gave coach
Rex Peery a disappointing exodus.
Converted football players Bill Bodle
and Bill Beck won a total of one
heavyweight match    and no 191pound victories during the season.
The victory was by forfeit. Peery retired as a coach after compiling a 11643-3 record in his fifteen years here.
Dave Johnson, who won the Eastern
157-pound title three years under
Peery's guidance, became the new
coach. Captain Lee Hall's 8-0-2 record
and two year undefeated dual meet
record plus junior Dino Boni's winning the 147 pound Eastern crown
were the bright spots of the season.
SWIMMING
  Swimming sank to the depths of beautiful
Trees Pool this season as the team compiled
a 1-8 record. The loss of the Levine twins
who had been the core of the squad for three
years, precipitated the bleak record. Cocaptain Andy James was one of several individual performers making good but inconsistent performances. When one man or
medley performed well, the others would
flounder. High points in the season were a
surprise victory against Syracuse, and James'
just missing qualifying for the 50 and 100
yard free style in the Easterns. Three seniors
leave this year's team, leaving a squad of
predominantly sophomores guiding the mermen. A shallow outlook highlighted again by
inexperience and inconsistency appears inevitable next year. Coach Ben Grady's only
retort is that "The boys need, and will get,
top flight experience since we compete with
top schools."

        INDOOR TRACK
  Bill Del Vecchio was a ball of fire on the indoor
track team this year. Injured and unable to compete in sprints, he switched to the 600 yard run
and anchored the mile relay team. He broke the
field house record the first time he ran the 600.
Against Navy he ran an excellent 47.3 anchor leg
that almost won the race after Pitt dropped a baton pass.
  Although spurred by Del Vecchio's efforts, the
team still managed to be mediocre. They beat
Kent State and Slippery Rock, but lost badly to
Navy. The team had a close meet with Army, but
lost 57 to 42.
  However, there were still some outstanding performances which prevented the season from being
totally uninteresting. Sophomore Jim Flanigan
threw the shot to a new field house record. Luddy
Hayden and Del Vecchio went to the IC4A meet
where Hayden took a sixth in the broad jump and
Del Vecchio took a fourth place in the 600 yard
run.

GYMNASTICS
  A.500 season is not an accomplishment
for many teams, but the gymnastics team's 55 record this season was its best in recent
years. The outcome was especially promising
for coach Warren Neiger, since his top point
scorers were not seniors. Junior Dave McKinnis and sophomores Ig Perez and Jim
Sacco led the team. McKinnis placed twelfth
in a field of 36 in the Regional still rings contest, while Sacco placed sixth of 12 entries in
the all-around competition. Neiger's greatest
joy was a 61-35 victory over rival West Virginia. "The boys did real well," said Neiger.
"We've been trying to build up the sport
here and it seems we may have hit the crystallizing stage." His crystals from this season
return next year, but the team still lacks
depth. It's their perennial problem, losing
many meets this season merely because they
didn't have enough men to compose the maximum entry in all events.

                 TENNIS
  Long hot summers typify tennis at
Pitt and this year proved no exception. Inexperience enabled the netters
to maintain their consistent losing
reputation with a 2-11 record. Sam
Donatelli and Larry O'Loughlin were
the only seniors on the eight man
squad. It was strong sophomore support, however, which guided the
team. Their presence made the poor
season a one hundred percent improvement over the previous year's 110 record. Coach Ben Pope has his
usual philosophical approach to the
problem. "There's no one particular
to blame, since none of the boys are
too good. We're all about the same,"
said Pope. "They lack the talent and
experience and we don't have the
facilities to draw good players." Pope
also had his perennial complaints
about the team's practice facilities at
the Carnegie Tech and Mellon Park
courts. "We can't play well when we
don't have our own home courts to
practice and play on." Pitt's courts
are scheduled for completion by the
1967 season.
GOLF
  Rex Peery became golf coach, but his winning
tradition as wrestling coach did not aid the golf
team. The golfers continued their consistent low
caliber play, compiling a 3-10 record. The team
practiced again at Chartiers Valley Country Club,
and played another rigorous schedule. Their foes
included Penn State, West Virginia, and Ohio University. Unfortunately, "Next season's schedule
will be the same as this year's," said Peery, ".
too rough." Despite the rough schedule and poor
record, the golfers gave reputable showings. Three
of their first four losses were by one point, while
several other matches were tied until the final
hole. Phil Fassett and Clair Riley also gave the
team a morale booster, establishing a 21 match
best ball winning streak. In every meet, their best
score was better than the opposing team's best
score.

OUTDOOR TRACK
  Outdoor track looked like a rerun of the indoor
track season. Bill DelVecchio and Luddy Hayden
led the team in scoring as the trackmen compiled
a 3-6 mark. Both injuries and lack of depth contributed to the losing record. Hayden and shot putter
Jim Flannigan missed several crucial meets because of injuries. Injuries to other runners and the
ineligibility of miler Damien Koch limited the
team to 15 members. "We just didn't have the
horses," said coach Carl Rees. The depleted squad
had to face such teams as Penn State, West
Virginia, and Notre Dame, all of which had
squads numbering 30-50 men. DelVecchio was the
team's standout. He broke his own school record
in the 100 yard dash and also broke the school
record for the 220. After placing in both the IC4A
and Central Collegiate meets, he placed sixth in
the 220 in the NCAA championships. Because of
the team's poor record, much discussion arose
concerning the school's track philosophy. "If
we're to become a big track school, we have to be
willing to extend more financial aid," said Rees.
"We need more high class high school players,
and it's difficult to get them when we offer them
full tuition and other schools give them a complete free ride."
BASEBALL
  Strong pitching and good hitting
paced the baseball team to a 16-3
record this season, earning the mitters a berth in the NCAA regional
playoffs. Lee Brueckel (6-1) and Dave
Blyshak (5-2) led the pitching corps,
winning eight of the team's first ten
victories. Fred Mazurek's.484 batting
average provided   the   dependable
hitting the squad had lacked in previous years. Barry Wetzel, Doug Chambers, and Fred Sauer all batted above
.300, adding support to Mazurek's
slugging. Mazurek ended the year as
the nation's second leading collegiate
batter. He then rejected a free agent
offer from   the Minnesota Twins,
choosing instead a professional football contract with the Washington
Redskins. Fielding lapses were the
team's downfall. After winning their
first ten games, they lost to Penn
State by committing six errors. Errors
also played a dominant role in the
losses to West Virginia and Saint
Vincent. West Virginia's pitching ace
John Radosevich gave up ten hits, but
his teammates scored the winning
run on a Pitt error. Lowly Saint
Vincent won by taking advantage of
a walk, hit batsman, passed ball, and
error surrendered by the mitters.
  Despite their shabby fielding, the
squad copped an NCAA berth by
winning three games the week of regional selections. But the fielding
nemesis again stifled their hopes.
Three errors allowed Lafayette a 4-3
first round victory over the mitters.
Ironically, "It was the older, more experienced players and not the sophomores who folded under the pressure," said coach Bobby Lewis.

MAN
OF THE
YEAR
  A well-balanced collegiate life in
academic and extra-curricular activities earned John R. Vrana the 1965
Omicron Delta Kappa (ODK) Man of
the Year award. His senior year typified his diversity as he served as
President of Student Government and
ODK. Mr. Vrana's previous activities
included Secretary of Druids, Druids
Sophomore Man of the Year, and
business manager of the 1964 Owl.
His academic prowess won him membership in Phi Eta Sigma and Phi
Beta Kappa. A native of Pittsburgh,
Vrana served in the Air Force prior
to entering Pitt. He is graduating this
year from the School of Liberal Arts
as an English major.
John R. Vrana
MR. &amp; MISS
PITT
  Personal leadership and service to the University made Miss Josey Grossman and Mr. Paul
Borman appropriate selections as this year's Mr.
and Miss Pitt. Miss Grossman was most active on
the Pitt News, serving as this year's editor. Her
journalistic skill earned her membership in Pi
Delta Epsilon and the Pennsylvania Women's
Press Association 1964 Award as the Outstanding
Journalism Student in Pennsylvania. Mr. Borman
also made his major contribution in the area of
student publications, serving as business manger
of the 1965 OWL. He also served as vice-president
of Druids, and was a member of Omicron Delta
Kappa.

HALL OF
FAME
  Four years at Pitt is much more than classes
and study. It is an opportunity to participate in a
University community that is as diverse as the
people that compose it. The Owl Hall of Fame
annually recognizes the outstanding members of
the graduating class that have made the greatest
contributions to this community. Selected by a
group of junior class leaders, who themselves represent the broadest areas of student life, the nominees are chosen on the basis of a demonstrated
capacity for leadership and service to the University and their fellow students. Although academic achievement is taken into consideration, it
is not emphasized in the selection process.

Graduates
  If there is one phrase that is really nothing
more than a myth at the University it's the term
"senior class." Because of the trimester system
and the various programs an undergraduate can
elect, there is no opportunity for the seniors to
meet as a group except when they don their academic gowns for commencement exercises. There
are a few things that can be considered the common   symptoms    of  that well-worn   disease,
"senioritis." Liberal Arts students recheck their
distribution subjects for one last time and practically everyone in every school makes sure he has
the requirements and credits to graduate.

  We share something. You and I. Deny it, conceal it, reject it: we still share it. You and I.
  The pain is ours. Yours and mine. She aches,
but the pain is ours; it belongs to us, it terrorizes
us. For it is we who conspired; we who huddled
together and giggled when she came by, alone.
  She's come by since, but its not bothered me.
I've been enthralled with the neon lights, drunk
with the fraternity parties, absorbed with the
Committee to Arouse School Spirit. It's not bothered me a bit; I know how to sing beautiful lullabies.
  We share something. I know that we share it. It
tiptoes through the blackness; I hear it breathing
in the depths. I turn up the radio and gaze at the
flickering neon, but it still breathes. Yes, we certainly share it. If only-but I'll never venture into
the darkness. Terror awaits where the streetlights
end. Terror, like an ugly, fleshy weed, like a grasping, squirming squid. Terror in the murkiness. Terror. Oh God, please let's talk about it. Let's drag
it into the light.
  "The score was 17-12. I felt so sorry for those
poor boys on the..."
  But-they could fight back. Please let's talk
about it.
  "... I cheered my lungs out, but..."
  Please, why can't we talk? I know that we
share it. Communicate. Why can't we communicate? We could have done it before; we three,
when she came by. She wanted to, but we were
contemptuous. She was lonely; now we three are
alone. Now she's out there too. Out there in the
darkness, breathing along with my innate loneliness, lurking beside my innate terror. Please, I
can't do it alone. You must come along. I know
it's in your darkness too. Together we'll drag it
into the light. It's more now than just loneliness;
now   it's swollen with giggles. She's giggling
back. We, we with our smugness, our laziness, our
neon, we denied the dark loneliness; we refused
before. But now we must communicate. It's swollen with giggles. I can't stand it. Please, have you
nothing to say?"
  "... Hush, little baby, don't you cry.."

   Adequate lighting, adjustable
   ventilation, and comfortable
       furniture make the men's
dormitory rooms a good place to
study. In the semi-quiet solitude
      of his room, a student can
  review his day's notes, battle a
  calculus problem, or write that
  English theme that was due last
week. As the evening progresses
      the comfort of a bed often
 becomes more attractive than a
   myriad of books, papers, and
notebooks. Male students dream
  of having a female companion
        accompanying their bed
studying, but they must resort to
            the more scholarly
  companionship of a paperback
                  or magazine.

   The Tables down at Morry's may be slightly
 more famous, but they hold no more significance
 for Yale students than do the tables down at
 Frankie's for Pitt students. Frankie's, is more
 specifically Frankie Gustine's Restaurant, or as it
 is known, Gustines.
 It's days at 3911 Forbes Avenue are numbered
 thanks to an ambitious University expansion pro gram, but while it's there it will be known as the
 outstanding example of genuine college life on the
 Pitt campus.
 It doesn't have that spic and span atmosphere
 that all the new places seem to possess. And
 everybody knows the food isn't the best. And to
 be sure, the service isn't either. But maybe that's
 what's so nice about the place. Maybe that's why
 it's so hard to get a table there on weekends and
 on Monday's after the sorority and fraternity
 meetings let out.
 But Gustines wasn't always like that. A few
 years back it was nothing more than a hang out
 for sports fans, to whom the name Frankie Gus tine was magic. Frankie was a most popular
 player with the Pittsburgh Pirates and his name
 sold the place, for all its inadequacies.
 But then the dorms came and the students
 came. They didn't know that Frankie Gustine
 once played for the Pittsburgh Pirates and they
 didn't care. They knew he was the nice guy who
 shook your hand when you came in and made you
 feel like you were his best customer and best
 friend.
 And because he made you think that, you may

want to drift down to Forbes Avenue a few
Homecomings from 1964 to see what stands in the
spot which once marked many happy hours for
you.
  Chances are very good there will be a lawn
there... something to make the Towers look
nicer. But the lawn will not erase the memories of
the grubby little building with the red sign advertising fine food. Or the door which everyone
pushed instead of pulled, or did they pull instead
of push. Or the menus which never changed and
which proudly boasted of "major league atmosphere at minor league prices."
  But the most vivid memories will be of the
many nights, everyone but Sunday, of throwing
down the beer-Carlings, Schlitz, Miller, Bud, Iron
City, Duquesne, Genesee, Ballantine, you name it,
Gustine's had it. Or eating the specialities of the
house-cheeseburger, onion rings, or shrimp cocktail. The rest of the menu was for those who
didn't know any better.
  And when you remember Gustine's you'll remember the Saturday nights when the organ
played. And how the old Oakland cronies, hangovers from the pre-student days, joined the college kids in singing all the old favorites. And
you'll remember the singing sometimes had to be
stopped because someone with too much in him
was up on the table doing his vocalizing.
  And then you'll feel bad for the students of the
future, who won't have a Gustines to hang out
in.

   Beds, however are the least
enjoyable means of taking a
study break. There are hourly
jaunts to the snack bar, lobby, or
one of the local sandwich shops.
Elevators look like dumb
waiters, bringing an endless
array of hot dogs, pizzas, and
cokes to feed the famished
intellectuals on every floor.
Students begin to travel from
one pie-shaped room to another,
checking on the latest jokes,
exchanging profound thoughts,
and solving the other guy's
problems. They form nightly
brainstorming sessions where
everyone gets the right
homework answers. Practical
jokes usually break the placid
atmosphere of study time.
Shaving cream battles, wrestling
in the halls, and pennying doors
shut make each floor a miniature
carnival.

  As I am an industrious and energetic student,
always willing to learn and see new things, I recently added to my regular schedule two new
courses. The first day these classes were to meet, I
arose at an early hour, put two red pencils and
some clean white paper into my vest pocket, and
walked briskly from my house to the University.
The first class apparently concerned itself with
world history, but it actually made little sense. At
the bottom of the lecture room, a squat, scholarlylooking professor was attempting to "demonstrate" the subject. (It is not uncommon, in this
University, to demonstrate subjects). The demonstration consisted of weird, mute gymnastics performed on a set of uneven parallel bars that had
been installed expressly for the purpose. An assistant, shrouded in a black satin gown and wearing a baseball cap, sat to one side and, at the end
of the history professor's first feat, shrieked in his
high pitched voice, "Oliver Cromwell!" I noticed that all the students around me were furiously jotting down notes on spiral bound pads, so
I drew one of the pieces of paper from my pocket
and, on it, drew an elaborate Arabic one, next to
which I inscribed the name "Oliver Cromwell."
When I looked up again, I saw that the professor
was doing an incredibly rapid series of backflips
on the parallel bars, and that the assistant was
standing in front of him, clapping his hands in a
syncopated rhythm, and singing, over and over
again, "Darius the Great, Darius the Great!"
This seemed to mark the end of the lecture, so I
followed the other students out of the hall.

::::::::::::
  During 1964, the student became painfully
aware of the multi-university and of all of the
implications thereof. He increasingly realized the
divisions between himself, the faculty, and the administration. He discovered that to the establishment he was merely an interchangeable set of
numbers: a student number, the monetary figures
of fees paid, a combination of numbered courses,
the number of credits carried and passed, the
quality points earned, the trimester average of
these points, and their cumulative average. And it
did not really matter to the impersonal and untouchable powers above whether he was really
here or whether it was someone else with an
equally acceptable combination of numbers. He
was replaceably anonymous; he mattered little.
What did matter was the prestige of the Pitt-and
that is measured not by what he thought, experienced, or felt, but by the acreage owned by the
university, by the height of a gothic monstrosity,
by the number of buildings and classrooms, and
by the sterile efficiency of new dormitories. And
thus, a new, bigger, and better library was being
planned while the present one was closed to him
on Sundays (God rests then, was the explanation).
"Mothers for a moral America" decided what
was best for women students by forcing them to
live in the gregarious (from the Latin, grex, ineaning herd) atmosphere of the dormitories, regardless of such heretical standards as maturity, which
imply individuality (there is, after all, no longer

any such thing as a unique individual, and who is
more qualified to make universal moral decisions?). And to him who questioned, the Advising
Center said: "If you don't like it, go somewhere
else!" The student, however, tended to be lost
already, and having no conception of where he
was, was in a dubious position to decide where to
go. He was so unsure of himself that he even
failed to realize that it was within his collective
powers to tell the "advisors" where to go. And
even if he had the courage, his fellow students
lacked it, and thus he did not even have that
power. He consequently settled back, forced himself to "like" it, and occasionally dreamt of
Berkeley. His only hope was the faculty who, at
times, cared about him-at rare times. They
seemed lost in the world of anonymity themselves
and were hence unable to provide guidance. He
flirted with many of them, but like the cynical
Frenchman who has been disappointed in love too
many times and is afraid of another failure, he
viewed them with increasing suspicion. Somewhere, of course, at some time, he had heard of a
benevolent and all-powerful Chancellor who, he
knew, would help if he could only see the agony
of the situation among the mere mortals, but he
was as close and as real to him as the Russian
Tsar or as a combination of Santa Claus and the
Easter Bunny-alas!

   Pitt Preview, Winter Weekend
   Committee
   The girls' dorms had the same
 range of activities, so those who
wanted to study often had to flee
    to secret retreats. Some took
    advantage of nice weather to
    study on the roof, above the
    turmoil. Others escaped the
    building completely, seeking
    quiet in the Student Union.
 Many, however, did not want to
 escape and were willing to wait
 until the early morning hours to
    study. Then it finally quieted
    down, and you could do the
       reading for that lit course
    without getting doused with
    spray net, or having to listen
    about somebody else's date. It
  was a time for more immediate
                     concerns.

BE
WISE
Follow the lead of more than 2,000,000
residents of Western Pennsylvania
who have wisely chosen Blue Cross
and Blue Shield protection against the
cost of hospital and doctor bills.
Yes, be wise and give yourself the
best. And Blue Cross and Blue Shield
are best because they are the only
professionally-sponsored protection
plans-the only plans officially approved by the hospitals and doctors
themselves.

   Soot-covered gray and brown bricks compose
 the exterior of the women's dormitories. But the
 activities within those unattractive walls closely
 parallel those in the bright, new men's towers.
 Frantic females run around gossiping about
 letters from home, boyfriends, their latest date,
 and occasionally schoolwork. Dorms are taboo
 for anyone except women students. The taboos
 serve a positive function for some women who
 want to be away from men. Of course, there was
 a time this year when even the dorms were no
 escape. That was the day of the mildest panty
 raid since the Marquis de Lafayette mistakenly
picked up Martha Washington's laundry.

The art of being
a non-conformist
or why many perceptive yearbook
staffs prefer a very distinguished
publishing house
Retaining one's individuality is not easy in
these days of mass production and standardization. This is especially true of yearbook publishing, in which mass production
methods have the tendency to force one to
buy just what the other fellow buys.
   Making of soap or soup or salad dressing by mass methods is one thing. But it
is quite another to attempt to produce a
creative yearbook by trying to squeeze it
into some pre-conceived mold. It just can't
be done that way.
   The Wm. J. Keller firm brings together
highly trained craftsmen, the very finest
papers and ink of superlative quality. Add
to these a unique service plan built around
the individual school, and, finally, production by the Velvatone process, which Keller
perfected especially for the printing of
yearbooks, and you have a truly distinguished performance. And a yearbook with
singular character and individuality...
we call it "THE LOOK OF THE BOOK."
   The yearbook you are presently leafing
through is the product of the Keller custom
program. If you would care to see other
examples of "THE LOOK OF THE BOOK"
as produced by Wm. J. Keller, get in touch
with us now.

These words from the 1963 OWL are reprinted for all those
that may benefit from them.
"It is an obsession. A drive to present in print an obvious
self-centered personality. A book reflects the common interests of all the workers involved. But on the whole represents the individual and his personality to himself. Nothing
is more pleasing to a writer than to read himself in print.
Nothing is more satisfying to a photographer than to see his
photos covering pages in a book. Or for him to compare and
to compete for a visual impression with another photographer on the same page. He looks and judges: Criticism or
a rare burst of humility, in the form of a compliment, follows.
It is our world. We operated haphazardly, each trying to
present more of ourselves. Yet each resisting their egos for a
better product. The book becomes a chemical compound,
the molecule not resembling the individual atoms but having
a set of characteristics of its own. Or else it is defeated.
It is full of hate. The conflicts of ideas, ideals, and idiosyncrasies tear at the book. Much of it was strained through
hate.
It is not my book. I acknowledge this."

I, too, add my initials.

The 1965 OWL would like to express its appreciation to the following, whose contributions helped
to make the production of Volume 60 possible:
Marian Nehus, acting Director of Student Publica  tion
Gimbel's Photo Reflex Studio, for efficient service
  on the senior photos
Kingscraft Covers, for prompt service on the
  cover
Wm. J. Keller Inc., for a fine printing job of the Vel  vatone FM and the color photos
Bud Harris, for his assistance on technical photog  raphy matters.
The Nineteen Sixty Five OWL of the University of
Pittsburgh has been printed by the offset lithographic process at Wm. J. Keller Inc., Buffalo,
New York, on 80 lb. Warren's Cameo Brilliant
Dull. A special process, Velvatone-FM, has been
used in the introductory section as well as a four
color scanning process of the Time, Life Corporation. The body copy is set in 10 point on 11 point
Melior and 12 point on 14 point Melior. The heads
are set in Melior ranging in size from 18 point to
24 point. The "run in" heads are 13 point Universe
Extra Bold Extended. The captions are set in 8
point on 10 point Melior, while the page numbers
are in 18 point Melior, screened 50 per cent. All
photographs in the book, including the organization group photographs, were taken by undergraduate students with the exception of the senior
portraits and a few    color photographs. The
seniors were photographed by Gimbel's Photo
Reflex Studios, Pittsburgh, Pa. The cover stock is
a new book cloth, Spindrift Black, stamped with
gold foil. It was manufactured by Kingscraft Division of Kingsport Press, Kingsport, Tennessee.

  This year the Towers lobby emerged as a
new gathering place for students. It was a
place to read the paper, or discuss the
psychological significance of "Peanuts." It
was a place to watch the football team play
Syracuse on television. You could sit there
and cheer as Fred Mazurek or Barry
McKnight ripped off yardage. And it
becomes a place to share disappointment
when the football team lost, 21-6. In the
quieter hours, the Towers lobby became a
place to relax, or to discuss problems, or to
sip coffee... or to sleep.
      The Towers cafeteria is to
   resident students as the Tuck
 Shop is to Greeks. For most, it's
 a place to meet your friends and
     talk about a poor professor,
   a rough test, or an uneventful
         date. It's also a place to
 complain. Institutional food is a
 scapegoat at all schools... it's
 almost a tradition... and Saga
         Foods Service is not an
   exception. Saga also provides
   several unique features in its
   tradition. There are Saturday
 night Butt steaks, Sunday night
"make-it-yourself sundaes," and
the ever-present alternatives of
        peanut butter and jelly.

  Books have been the symbol of learning
for centuries. At Pitt the myriad of
libraries, book stores, and reference rooms
house shelves of books, magazines, and
periodicals. When a student doesn't know
an answer he turns with hope to these
storehouses of knowledge. When a lecture
is unclear you can go to a book. When you
need the results of current research or the
ancient dialogues of a Greek scholar you
can go to a library. And paperback books
gradually replace comic books as a means
of instant leisure. After all, they're small,
colorful, and inexpensive.

   Every scene from romantic interludes to
     casual card games can be found in the
   spacious Student Union. Heavily padded
     chairs and couches in the lower lounge
     provide stopovers for weary students
 loafing between classes. Secretaries run to
   and fro, taking regular jaunts to the Hunt
      Room cafeteria. But activity does not
 center in the lounge area, it emanates from
   the nine floors above. Students travel up
   and down the speedy elevators to student
   publications, Arnold Air Society, student
          aid, and other administrative and
organization offices. Another added feature
of the Union is its use as a shortcut between
                 Forbes and Fifth Avenue.

  Diversity makes college education a unique experience. Within
the bounds of the university, a student not only attends classes,
but cultivates,many interests. Some want to improve certain
skills, and others just want some fun. Either way, the
opportunities are vast. For the athlete, there are intramural sports,
paralleling every type of varsity competition. For the more
literary-minded students, there are writers' clubs, a magazine of
the liberal arts, a yearbook, newspaper, and engineering
magazine. For musicians, there are informal choral and
instrumental groups, including the concert, dance, and varsity
marching band. For the actor, there is Pitt Players and Theatre 11.

  Like the Towers snack bar, the
  Tuck Shop and the Hunt Room
  are both places of congregation.
  When there's nothing else to do,
  guys can go down to the Cub's
  Den by the Hunt Room to shoot
       a game of pool or play the
    pinball machines. Then they
 only have to walk across the hall
 to get a coke or a sandwich. The
 Tuck Shop may offer less in the
way of entertainment, but it's the
best place in the Cathedral to go
  for a study break or a class cut.
Students begin to seek out people with
    similar interests as the school year
  progresses. Groups of two, four, and
        larger numbers form, and they
gradually do more together. Individual
activities such as studying, eating, and
   shopping become the ritual of these
special groups. A fellow group member
    becomes the guy to borrow money
 from or the girl to get you a blind date.
    He's the guy who visits your home
    during the summer or the girl with
 whom you pledge. Each group activity
     makes more bonds of memorable
                         friendship.
                                                                                    c

     Exams, papers, quizzes and lab reports
create continual weekly pressures. Students
  often drag through the week with mirage           like visions of a weekend break.
  Fraternities provide a ready outlet for the
  tensions of many students. A brother may
    walk into a house nervous from a recent
 exam, but a few friendly ribbings or a little
        outspoken profanity can relieve his
        traumatic feeling. Fraternities and
     sororities are also the center of campus
 social activity. The house is the place to go
 for a Saturday night party or a Friday night
 beer. It's the place to assemble before going
   to a football or basketball game. And for
   those who live in the house the fraternity
        supplies meals and a place to sleep.

  When someone says Oakland,
  they're also saying Pitt. The two
  words are synonymous. Forbes
  and Fifth Avenues are bordered
  full length by University dorms,
school buildings, and a multitude
   of stores serving the students.
     Engineering complexes, the
 medical school, and the Stadium
      stand erect as pillars in the
 skyline. Syria Mosque, Carnegie
   Library and Museum, and the
        Playhouse give Oakland
  distinction as the city's cultural
  center, drawing much of their
  audience from the student body.

     Students shackled to the Oakland area by lack of
transportation still can find many activities. The locale
is both the city's cultural hub and an economic quarry
of laundries, restaurants, and clothing stores. Students
  can attend the Pittsburgh Symphony, popular music
  concerts, art shows, the museum, legitimate theater
       performances, or a movie. The gourmet finds a
       multitude of dining establishments, including
     Gustine's, the White Tower, the Original, the Pitt
     Pantry, and the Village Pizza. Oakland residents,
 however, do not regard the University as an asset. To
 most it's a land-grabbing demon that threatens their
                  homes, children, and Forbes Field.
  Not even the University escapes Pittsburgh's
massive march in urban renewal. Bricks
crumble and glass shatters daily as cranes and
bulldozers make way for a flurry of grantfinanced buildings. Research centers, libraries,
art buildings, and dormitories replace rows of
commercial buildings. Dilapidated homes
quiver beneath the thrust of an ominous iron
ball. Scaffolds surround soot-covered buildings,
stripping their antiquated exterior and creating
sparkling new facades. But after the dust has
settled and the noise has ceased, the Cathedral
and the Stadium remain as the school's
distinctive landmarks.

  Men and women students come out
of their dorms and meet at weekend
events. Parties, dances, and dates
provide an intimate atmosphere where
students can forget their studies, relax,
and enjoy college life. Schoolsponsored activities include evening
dances, Student Union Board
programs, and post-football game jam
sessions. Fraternities add to the
diversity of events, planning weekend
trips, stag parties, and novel fraternitysorority functions. Some are successes,
others are failures, but all are places to
meet someone.

  Concrete, cars, and occasional patches of
greenery dominate the unromantic
landscape of the university. Sidewalks,
trolleys, and office buildings jut out as cold,
formal symbols of an automated society.
Rarely do these things provide meaning and
beauty for the individual student. But when
two people share their collegiate
experiences, the concrete and steel
structures acquire a romantic meaning.
Sidewalks become a path leading to a
dream, and the two become oblivious to the
passing cars. Stone pillars and supports are
converted into private hideaways where
personal thoughts can be exchanged.
Buildings become backgrounds for a
private talk.
  Insides of buildings are no
longer places for individual
study, television gazing, and
card games. Padded couches and
chairs are now settings for
serious talks. Carpeting spreads
forth like a green pasture, giving
the two a feeling of solitude.
Drapes break the glare of
sunshine, making it a
glimmering ray falling gently on
their faces. The huge rooms of
the Student Union are
segmented into private worlds.
Thoughts are exchanged. But
these thoughts are not the
mathematical formulas which
usually dominate conversations.
They are thoughts about one
another, evoking an
understanding of each person's
emotions-of "We, Two."

The Year
  A multitude of diverse activities highlighted the
1965 year for Pitt students. From freshman orientation to Winter trimester finals week, there was a
perpetual flow of events. Student Union Board activities created broader cultural perspectives for
many students. The P.M., Midday, and Forum
series provided intellectual breaks from classes,
while Winter Weekend, Greek Week, jam sessions, and football games gave students time for
relaxation. Democratic Vice-presidential nominee
Hubert Humphrey spoke at the University, selling
his wares to an enthusiastic group of students.
The rising tide of civil rights' activity also shed its
waters on Pitt with students rushing to join
SNCC, CORE, NAACP, and the bus ride to Alabama.

midday series          Speakers of national
and international fame addressed University audiences as part of the Student Union Midday Series.
James Farmer, executive director of the Congress
on Racial Equality, opened the series, urging that
"all men white and black join in the most exciting crusade in recent history, the Civil Rights
movement." Well-known satire cartoonist, Jules
Feiffer confided to his audience what he really
thought of "life, times and the funny papers."
Shocking his audience, anthropologist Ashley
Montagu spoke of the "natural superiority of
women." For the politically minded, Dr. Carl
Schweitzer discussed the problems of the division
of Germany into two separate countries. In a
lighter mood, major league baseball player, Jimmy
Piersall recounted some of his experiences, including teaching Yogi Berra the art of diapering a
baby. One of the most unusual Midday speakers
was John Howard Griffin, author of Black Like
Me, who had lived in the South disguised as a
Negro. Students from a local school of mortuary
science attacked the views of the author of the
American Way of Death. Jessica Mitford spoke
about the high cost of dying in the United States.
The series closed on St. Patrick's Day with a
calmer tone when writer Ulick O'Conner spoke of
the literary renaissance in Ireland.

p. m. series       For those students who had leisure time in the
evenings and felt like a little musical
relaxation, the Student Union Board
offered the P.M. series. There were
classical concerts as well as jazz
groups. The jazz series in the fall began with the Al Morell Trio, who appealed more to the rock'n roll fans
than to the jazz enthusiasts. Complimented for coordinating his seventeen piece group and having good arrangements Ray De Fade, however,
blasted his audience in the overcrowded lower lounge of the Student
Union. When Charles Bell came, it
was not his trio that was the success,
but Bell's son, "Poogie" at the drums
who kept the audience entertained.
The Leroy Brown Quartet concluded
the jazz series, leaving the impression
that the quartet specialized in dinner
music-not jazz. Entering into a completely different area of music, German pianist, Detlef Kraus played
works of Beethoven, Brahms, and
Schubert.

parents weekend            Wishing to see
where their money was going, parents came to the
campus again this Fall. They enjoyed a football
game and visited their collegiate offspring. But the
highlight of the two days was the Chancellor's reception in the Cathedral Commons Room. As with
most receptions, the program began with an address from the Chancellor and the other administrative officials in attendance. A reception line
was formed, like a winding snake, where the visiting parents met the Chancellor and Mrs. Litchfield, Vice Chancellor Rankin, Dean Rush and
Dean Crafts. The Commons Room was decorated
with the rugs and palms that always appear on
such occasions, and the tables were decorated
with sterling silver coffee urns and vases filled
with red and white carnations.

orientation        Students who
have started on their way through the
academic mill introduced incoming
freshmen to the grind in a three day
orientation session. During the day
the freshmen sweated through placement tests and slept through endless
speeches by the administration. However, whether frugging on the Gateway Clipper or swimming at Tree
Pool, the "orientees" found their evenings more enjoyable. All incoming
students also were invited to gather
for a Freshman Outing during their
first weekend on campus. On the bus,
or in a canoe, or just sitting listening
to someone play the guitar, people
have a tendency to meet people during the outing.

elections        Hoopla, rallies and hot arguments over conservatism and liberalism marked
the 1964 presidential election. The University of
Pittsburgh was no exception to this political pattern. Both sides garnered their forces under well
organized and well publicized student groups. For
both, the high point of their campus campaign
was a rally held on the Cathedral lawn. The Republican rally was noted for the appearance of
the offspring of the candidates. Barry Goldwater,
Jr., Mike Goldwater, Mary Ann Miller, and Lucy
Miller led the open air meeting. After the rally
students snacked on free Barryburgers and Goldwater. Without food, but with the next vice president of the United States in attendance, the later
victorious young Democrats had a rally which
was far from boring.
  Before Hubert Humphrey spoke, loyal Johnson
supporters tore down a sign making blunt references to the Jenkins scandal. During his speech no
one was surprised that he had to answer a call
from the President since Khrushchev had just resigned.
lantern night "By this flame
within my hand." Alma Mater led the
freshman women in the traditional
ceremony inducting them into university life. The two-part ceremony was
composed of "The Gift of the Lanterns" in Steven Foster and "The Gift
of Light" in the darkened Commons
Room. The alumnae and proud parents watched as the flamebearers lit
the lanterns and the ritual was conducted.

football weekend A face at a football
game can be alive with excitement, yelling and
cheering the team on to victory. It can be the
face of one of the cheerleaders as she twists
with the Panther. But most of the time a face at a
Pitt football game had the look of boredom-half
aware of what was happening on the gridiron.
The fans were more interested in the whereabouts
of the hot dog man or how much was left in their
flasks and bottles. There was usually a good show
on the sidelines too. The cheerleaders prayed at
the goal line for a kick conversion while the Panther lent his head to a little boy who was directing the band. Banners were evident everywherein the stands as well as flying over them. The
toughest competition was usually between the
fraternities and sororities for the spirit trophies
rather than between the two teams on the field.

homecoming          A concert at Carnegie Music Hall was the first event of Homecoming Weekend. Rock and roll star, Bobby Rydell, was a last
minute replacement as the featured attraction. He
later admitted that he was unusually nervous because it was one of the first college shows he had
done. Although the well known comic, Jackie Vernon, also appeared, the folk group, the Mandrell
Singers, were the hit of the evening. After the
show several fraternity houses held parties. Saturday began with the Homecoming Queen finalists,
the cheerleaders and the Pitt Panther leading a
spirit parade to the stadium. The walls of the stadium were decorated with "Famous First" banners done by sororities, fraternities and independent groups. During the game the Homecoming
queen candidates did not seem very concerned
with the teams on the field. Wearing sun glasses
to protect their pretty eyes, while dressed in furs
and long white gowns, one candidate nonchalantly sipped a coke while another read her program. When Ann Coleman was named Queen at
halftime, besides roses and a crown, one of her
more tangible rewards was a kiss from the Chancellor.

winter weekend Struggling to establish
a tradition, members of the planning committee
prayed for snow and tried to convince students
that they wouldn't lose their lives on the Laurel
Mountain ski slopes. A talent show in Stephen
Foster with everything from the "Nurses Nine" to
a folk singing group began the Winter Weekend.
The Student Union Lobby was turned into a carnival ground with booths built by Greeks, dorm
houses and other organizations. For those who
dared, skiing was best remembered. Some fell on
their back side and split their pants, while the
more timid ones remained "enlodged." That night
participants could recuperate at "The Blast" with
Ruby and the Romantics and the Crystals.

greek week Hardly a Greek
on campus had a free moment during
Greek Week 1965. On Monday, most
Greeks skipped lunch, either to watch
or participate in the chariot race
down Bigelow Boulevard. That night,
Greeks shouted their lungs out in the
Greek Shriek contest and laughed at
the Fraternity court jesters, many of
whom were garbed in wild costumes.
With Tuesday night a "free night,"
everyone gathered on Wednesday at
Carnegie Music Hall for Greek Sing.
Following the theme of "This is
America," fraternity men dressed as
soldiers performed Civil War Songs
or folk songs and girls in top hats and
tights sang "The Lullaby of Broadway." In the evening Sylvia Shapiro,
sponsored by ZBT, was crowned
Greek Week Queen for her performance of "More" and "The Birth of the
Blues." Friday night there was a concert with Peter Nero and the week
concluded with the Monte Carlo Ball
at the Churchill Country Club.

  A large university can offer
many things to many people. It
offers the opportunity for
enlightening thought. After a
class, a student can just sit and
think, or he can work on an
extracurricular activity. During
football season, there are
afternoon pep rallies to attend.
These are the things that keep a
university unified, yet diverse.
These are the things that make
college life what it is. These are
the things that make college life
memorable.

convocation         Twice   during
the year the faculty and administration, gowned in their academic robes,
walked through the tree-lined walk of
the Cathedral to Convocation. A patriarchal Chancellor opened the Fall
convocation at which Diasado Macapagal, President of the Phillipines, received an honorary degree. President
Macapagal warned the audience of
Communist advancement throughout
Asia. And at the Honors Convocation
in March commending the University's Learning, Research and Development Center, Falk Professor, Dr.
Peter H. Odegard asked for an "open
door" education policy.
civil rights march A rally
held in the quadrangle and the following march to Heinz Chapel began
a week of civil rights activities at the
University. More than five hundred
silently paraded down Fifth    and
Forbes Avenues and then attended a
memorial service in the chapel for
Reverend   James Reeb, who was
killed by the beating of an Alabama
policeman. The service included
speeches by civil rights leaders, who
interpreted the meaning of Reverend
Reeb's death, and sermons by the University's clergy. The emotions felt
during the service were at their highest point when those in attendance,
arm in arm, sang "We Shall Overcome."

alabama trip         To about one
hundred students on campus it just
did not seem enough just to hold a
memorial service on campus. They
felt they should go to where the
trouble was happening, which was in
Selma, Alabama. They wanted to
demonstrate for the cause of civil
rights. Some waited for buses until
2:30 in the morning. Others went
down by automobile. When they finally arrived in Alabama they had little to look forward to since the air
was filled with hostility. Every moment as they demonstrated they were
liable to the beating of local "deputies" on horseback. To those who sufered emotional and physical torture
in those two days in Selma, all the
University offered was a hot meal in
the cafeteria and the interest and admiration by some of the student
body.

:IQKengineers week The engineers at the
University stormed down from their hill to the
main campus for Engineers Week. Trying to top
novel appearances in years past, St. Patrick
opened the week by being carried from an ambulance by two Pittsburgh policemen. Students from
all schools crowded round as the engineers tried
to catch a greased pig. The winning department,
the Double E's, chased the pig in flashy matador
costumes with accompanying music blaring from
the student union. At night there was a giant size
Monopoly game where you could not buy Park
Place, but the Cathedral was up for grabs. Senior
engineers closed the week by unabashedly singing
"Auld Lang Syne" at the Engineers' Ball.
