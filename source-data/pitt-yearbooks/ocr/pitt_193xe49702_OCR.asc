     A Note on "Pittsburghesque"
     "Pittsburghesque" was a child in swaddling clothes in the 1930 Owl, born of
the idea that some small portion of an annual should be given over to things
exclusively of the campus, its spirit, its habits, its joys, its sorrows. Here it has
grown, as children are wont to do. In it has been included a larger Views section,
The Hall of Fame, the Pepper Prize winner, a section for campus Beauties. In
future years it will no doubt attain to its full manhood. Mere increase in size does
not mean maturity; coming of age, if its purpose is to be continued, can only
mean the presentation in greater detail, with greater fidelity, with a spirit growing
ever warmer, of those aspects of University life which too often are hidden in the
deadening formalism of college annuals. To attain that will be, we hope, an end
worthy of our successor's most earnest efforts.......

BEAUTY
1 _
                              Beauty
    As our Freshman theme-writers are so fond of saying, there are many kinds,
and types, and styles of Beauty. But simply because these kinds, and types, and
styles have been the subject matter of innumerable splurges into the field of description; and because they have, thereby, earned the title of "trite", is no argument against their virility, their essential worth, their truth. Boldened by this
logical reasoning, The Owl, one of the hardy flowers of its type, decided upon a
venture into one of those fields of Beauty. The Owl, accordingly, set out upon a
campaign to determine the five "Beauties" amongst the feminine gender on
campus; set about in an altogether fitting and democratic manner, by running
ballots in the "Weekly", with the request that fellow students vote for five beautiful young ladies. Oh! how those ballots were stuffed, and how we worked comparing
handwritings in the effort to discard those which were useless. That we succeeded,
in all due modesty, is apparent. One look at the page opposite convinces one that
this is so.
    So... Ladies and Gentlemen, Honorable Judges, Fellow Students, it gives us
unalloyed pleasure to present... see page 105.... five little drops of honey, pure
and unsullied, the sweetest of the sweet.... the Beauty Contest Winners.

     Gamma Circle of Omicron Delta Kappa Fraternity was installed at the University of Pittsburgh in 1916. Omicron Delta Kappa was founded at Washington and Lee University sixteen
years ago for the purpose of recognizing eminence in scholarship, athletics, campus life, literary
and forensic attainments, and college publications. The ideals of this fraternity are recognition,
opportunity, and character.
     The threefold purpose of 0. D. K. is: First, to recognize men who have attained a high standard
of efficiency in college activities, and to inspire others to strive for conspicuous attainments along
similar lines; Secondly, to bring together the most representive men in all phases of collegiate life
and thus create an organization which will help to mould the sentiment of the institution on
questions of local and inter-collegiate interest; and Thirdly, to bring together members of the faculty
and student body of the institution on a basis of mutual interest and understanding.

    Pi Lambda Theta, honorary educational fraternity for women, was
organized for the purpose of establishing a lofty code of professional ethics,
high standards of honor and of professional training, and thorough scholarship, and to promote "such social interests as will further those ends." A
local group named Kappa Pi was formed in 1914, and Kappa Pi became
Delta Chapter of the national Pi Lambda Theta organized in 1917. Inasmuch
as only seniors and graduates are eligible to membership, the active chapters
consist not only of undergraduate members but of members actually engaged
in the practice of teaching. Three members of Delta Chapter have been signally
honored this year: Miss Bess Goodykoontz was appointed Assistant Commissioner in the United States Office of Education; Miss Cecil Dean and Miss
Katherine Foulke have been appointed assistants in the newly organized
Personnel Department of the Pittsburgh Public Schools. Delta Chapter also
claims Miss Emily Evans as the National Treasurer of Pi Lambda Theta.

    Founded in 1909 at DePauw University, Sigma Delta Chi came to Pitt
eleven years later and since that time has assumed an increasing importance

a member. The heads of all campus publications for this year are enrolled in
its ranks.
     The Founder's Day banquet, the annual smokers, and the annual Publications or Gridiron banquet were again its most important events. Work was
started on the compilation of a general University directory.

                    The "Y" Hut
                alias "Activities Building"
    The "Y" Hut, alias "Activities Hall," located under the shadow of
the giant stadium on l)e Sota Street, is the social center for all men
students.
    Last year, the "Hut" served primarily as a playhouse for men, and
it became unusually frivolous during the annual rehearsals of the Cap and
Gown Club. The fellows will never forget the old cafeteria that was there,
the candy stand, and even old Besty-one of the relics of wartimes!
    But now, as the old order changes, "Activities Hall" is quite a different place than the "Y" Hut. No more screechy chairs are there-no
more dusty, even muddy floors, but there are many new chairs, and the
floors seem almost waxed. In the new "Activities Hall" are the offices of
the dean of men and his assistants, the graduate manager of activities, the
director of employment and housing for men, the secretary of the Pitt
Y.M.C.A., the Pitt Weekly, the Panther, the Owl, and the headquarters
of the various musical organizations. And in the center of the building is
a large room with tables for study and lounging. Here the men are encouraged to get together and plan their work in campus activities, or to
spend their leisure in social contact with fellow students. A true Pitt
atmosphere is felt in the renovated "Y" Hut!

    Another year. Another Owl. An Owl that has consistently attempted
to be different, not ordinary, unusual. A book, this, moulded about the
theatre-the drama its theme; the decorations of the theatre, its decorations; the spirit of the theatre, its spirit. If, in any measure, no matter
how small, how meagre, we have caught that spirit of the stage, the
footlights, the tenseness of all that is connected with the drama, then we
shall feel that this Owl has not been a failure to its purpose.

    In 1889 a group of men formed a club or society at Hope College, Brown
University, under the name of Phi Kappa Sigma which means Four(ternity of
Catholic Students. Due to the objection of another fraternity of the same name
but which was distinctly non-catholic, the group at Hope College dropped the
Sigma and established a full-fledged Greek-letter fraternity as Phi Kappa in
1900. Psi Delta Chi, a local Pitt Group of Catholic students, obtained their
charter from Phi Kappa as Mu Chapter. This fraternity has a roster of 21
active chapters and none inactive. Purple, white and gold are the colors and
Ophelia rose is the flower. The fraternity magazine, " The Temple", is
published quarterly.

    Theta Chi Fraternity was officially founded on April 10, 1856 at Norwich
University, located at Northfield, Vermont. Not until 1919 was Pitt granted
a chapter when Sigma Epsilon, a local, became Alpha Beta chapter. Theta
Chi has a total of 46 active chapters with a wide distribution. The colors of
the fraternity are red and white and the flower is the red carnation. The pin
displays a gold rattlesnake, with a ruby-set eye. In keeping with this symbol
the name of the magazine is the " Rattle".

     A bigger, better, bolder Panther was evidenced in the 1929-30 numbers of
the University's humorous publication. Rated All-American in Class A of
the National Scholastic Press Association in 1929, the Panther presents a
clever combination of college wit with several serious features.

HALL OF FAME SAYS
     There is a definite need at the University for a more intimate, friendly relationship between
upper-classmen and matriculants. We talk about "school spirit" in the form of ideals and traditions and we wonder if it would not be possible for the student body to support the various
University functions even more than they do at the present time. In this connection it should
be remembered that such a "spirit" must be deeply impressed upon our Freshmen in order that
it may be lasting. It is therefore the duty of the upper-classmen to foster the true "spirit" of our
University and to conduct themselves in such a way that every new student will catch that
"spirit" and attach himself to the long line of Loyal Pittites. To attain this end it is necessary
that we conscientiously carry out an extensive, friendly, socialized, integrative Freshman Customs plan as advocated by the Committee this year. Because, after all, it is friendship that binds
student to student and student to University and not the spirit of compulsion involved in strict
Freshman Regulations.
                                                                         VIERS W. ADAMS
     Stricter entrance requirements and vocational guidance these are my recommendations.
The pass key to the University should be more than just a high-school diploma. I realize that
there are evils in entrance examinations, but I am more convinced that our present system of the
"wide open door" has dangers that are even more pernicious. The University of Pittsburgh,
unfortunately, is the obvious sufferer of a policy of misunderstood democracy. Vocational guidance is my other recommendation. The main purpose of the University, we are told, is to fit us
for life. For most of us, the abstraction "life" is reduced to the concrete word "job". The University should, by some more effective program than is the case at present, strive to aid its students
in choosing vocations for life.
                                                                         SYLVIA BERMAN
     I came to school. When school was over I went home. Went home as most of us go-on the
street car. It took me three years to find out that my life at Pitt was related to the rest of me, or
that Pitt could be concerned either with little towns or with the territory covered by the rambling
"Seventy-seven."
    And so, I appreciate the people at Pitt who, while they belong to Pitt, are "in and of" the
city of Pittsburgh. My definition of "in and of" requires some intelligence about the social
situation in the Pittsburgh area, and at least some conscience about it. My constructive criticism for the University should be that more and more of its people be "in and of."
                                                                     MARY ANNE JOHNSTON
    To present a definite ariticism of the University is not the easiest thing to do when cne can
find little to berate. I would rather level my fault finding eye on t4he students who make up the
University. I do not believe that enough have learned what this thing called "education" is and
why it has to be esconced in elaborate buildings and embellished with a faculty and administration.
Bricks, even when they are held together with mortar, tell stories; and so do the sternest professors
when they are given the opportunity. We neglect too much to develop intimate contacts with our
instructors and learn from them in an informal way. We are too little exposed to an intimate
"face to face " companionship with our professors who are also human. Our undergraduate friends
have had greater effect on our lives than our more experienced teachers. Book knowledge is soon
forgotten; knowledge from life lingers. Then, intimacy with the faculty will hasten the discarding of an old fallacy that we are here to escape study and knowledge. The converse is true.
                                                                       SYDNEY W. EIGES
[242]
     Constructive contributions of real worth are generally ideas offered by minds of wide experi ences and knowledge of the tried and untried. A suggestion in the field of improvements, from an
 unsophisticated undergraduate naturally holds meagre possibilities. However, since the occasion
 permits, may one add-the old stuff, that the love one has for one's school is dearer than the
 treasures of old-the realization of this fact should be vital in the heart of every student. Let
 one give the victory cry for Yale! -for Harvard! mine is forever equally as strong for Pitt.
                                                                        JOSEPH DONCHESS
     The most serious defect in the relationship between the University and the undergraduates
 is the lack of guidance of the students in their course of study. Too many students are taking
 courses for which they are not fitted either by preparation or by temperament. There is a need
 for some agency within the University through which the individual student could be studied and
 advised as to those studies that would best equip him for his life's work. This year Student
 Council made a cursory investigation of the student body and decided that the University needs
 a Guidance Bureau. It now will be the duty of next year's Student Council to prove conclusively
 to the Administration of the University that the undergraduates need and desire the benefits
 that could be derived from such a Bureau.
                                                                ENDICOTT A. BATCHELDER
     I sincerely believe that the activities on the campus of the University of Pittsburgh are well
 worth while, but the benefits derived from them are felt only by those who actively participate
 in them. To the large number of students not engaged in any extra curricular efforts I would
 suggest that they enter heartily into the work of advancing some organization; thus the organi zation will be broadened in scope and usefulness, and they will have received a personal benefit
 thereby. They will also find that they have caught that elusive quality called "school spirit."
                                                                            EMMA BROWN
     The one thing, vital to the students of the University, which is lacking is a Vocational Guidance Bureau. There is a decided need for such a department as is shown by the number of students
enrolled in the Personnel department. Over 400 problem cases were taken care of by this department during the month of January. The University helps the student after he has gotten into
difficulties. Why not avoid this situation, lighten the burden born by the Personnel heads by
directing the student in the first place, before he chooses a profession for which he is not suited.
     Herein lies a golden opportunity for the University officials to widen their constructive program for the betterment of the University and the student body.
                                                                       BERENIECE GREER
     My experience with student activities while at the University leads me to believe that the
tendency of a few able leaders to gain control of most of the important branches is not an altogether healthy thing. In all probability a man of exceptional ability as these leaders are for the
most part, is not injured, but what about the activities? Is the level, the standard maintained, as
high as though fewer duplications in personnel were the plan? Point Scale Committee has jurisdiction to some extent, but either they have been lax in administering the rules or else the rules are
not stringent enough to give them the proper regulatory power. Every year they fail to act to
any extent in most of the cases present. A study of this committee's actual functioning might
bring out valuable suggestions.
                                                                  OGDEN D. GENSHEIMER

    A forward movement in student government life at Pitt might be brought about by a closer
coordination between all student activity leaders. At present a close relationship between leaders,
both men and women, is not evident. Yes, we have a women's board and a senate composed of
student representatives. But what we need is a more definite relationship between a men's and
women's council. No definite relationship can exist until both men and women's boards are
comparable in structure and organization. Perhaps the solution to this problem is a Men's Self
Government Association similiar to the Women's Association. Problems that concern the men or
women could be considered by the individual boards, and each board would legislate according to
its respective problems, while student council would take care of problems mutual to both groups.
Both organizations would be greatly benefited by this type of student government organization.
Each board would feel the strong influence of the other. Such a system would mean a closer
relationship, a sharing of each other's problems, a stronger government for the men, a larger
opportunity for student development through participation in activities, and two strong student
boards working together in the aim of realizing a better self-govermnent.
                                                             FANNIE MAE CHARLESWORTH
     I think it would be most advisable to erect girls' dormitories as soon as the Cathedral is
completed. By having these, Pitt will be able to draw students from a much wider area than is now
possible. A wider area is always valuable as it increases interest in the university. At present we
are starting a Junior College movement. These branches naturally encourage students to take
higher learning, so if we want them to come here, it is best to provide board for them. Of course
we have the fraternity houses, but if we had dormitories, board could be much cheaper and thus
doors would be open to many girls who are vitally interested in education and do not have the
finance to live in a small student house. School spirit will be increased with dormitories, for now
the tendency is for "out-of-town" girls to mingle with only house girls and to have no deep
interest in school affairs. This is only natural, for each house is a small unit working and playing
alone. In dormitories it will be natural for groups to pal together, but at the same time the school
is presented as a whole.
     From the fraternity standpoint, if we had dormitories, each group could have a small house
 to use as its social center and for ceremonies without interruption. Most of all it seems very un just to the few fraternities to have financial expense when the houses are not filled. Even though
 they are run efficiently, it is better to have expense centralized under the university. So, dormi tories may benefit both fraternities and the girls "living in."
                                                                    KATHERINE MANEVAL
     Four years spent at the University of Pittsburgh strangely enough give one little foundation
 for the expression of mature and practical suggestions of any material worth. As a member of
 this year's graduating class I should merely like to toss off a few impressions of student life and
 activities at Pitt for better or for worse. A school of journalism should be established and a
 daily newspaper instituted. Intercollegiate minor sports should be removed and be incorporated
 in an extensive intramural athletic program. Dormatories should be built to keep students in
 closer contact with their school. A "fraternity row " should be established. Above all Pitt students
 should realize that they are attending one of the greatest universities in the country and take
 pride in their activity and scholastic accomplishments.
                                                                     J. LEONARD SOLOMON
[2441
     The effort to write constructive criticism of the school in which one has been a student for
 four years, finds one strangely lacking in both words and thoughts. The best that can be done is
 probably a series of sentences, each beginning with "I think..." Accordingly: I think Student
 Council one of the most ambitionless and lackadaisical organizations on campus, not because of
 any lack of ability on the part of the members, but because of a scarcity of problems with which
 it is capable of coping and the fact that most of these problems can be more easily and directly
 settled by means of smaller, more centralized committees. I think the present movement for a
 M. S. G. A. a foolish one because it goes even further into a decentralization which is already bad
 enough. I think Student Relations committee has proven itself capable, and will continue so, of
 doing all the business and more, which Student Council has been wrestling with for the past four
 years... I think the Owl should either be given an appropriation of at least $1000 or totally
 abolished.... I think drastic steps, in the form of constitutional amendment and parliamentary
 change, should be made to eliminate the fraternity politics which now runs rampant.... I think
 a broader attitude and greater latitude should be developed in choosing the places for University
 functions instead of restricting them, practically in toto, to the Hotel Schenley... I think people
 ought to be at least allowed to think of a woman's smoking room in the Cathedral... I think that
 none of these things will be accomplished but they that all ought to be.
                                                                           C. J. PHILLIPS
     "A building will never make a University" is the unreasonable cry of too many Pitt students
who have been influenced in their thinking by low-pressure instructors and short-sighted critics.
    But the Cathedral of Learning, plus a marvelous new type of college education that is to be
originated there, plus Dr. John G. Bowman, are going to make a University which will cause the
world to sit up and blink within the next ten years.
    A man of the limitless capabilities, sincerity and personality of John G. Bowman, when he
gives his whole life to a practical job, can't fail to accomplish his purpose.
                                                                        NORMAN L. PARK

THIS COMPANY has been perfecting its
     organi3ation and equipment for many years.
  It is able to turn out Printing of such excellent
  quality as the buyers of printing ask for. Its
  quest is for orders on the sole merit of being
  able to satisfy its many customers with good
  printing at moderate cost.
  It invites correspondence with those contem  plating issuing catalogs-illustrated profusely
  in colors-or the more modest advertising of
  a less pretentious nature.......
  Its success in printing Annuals for Universities,
  Colleges, and other institutions of learning, is
  attested to by the large number it prints
  yearly.

... you'll want your own x-ray unit
F REQUENT use of the x-ray is one of the
    ways by which the public is learning to
distinguish the progressive dentist.  More
and more the leaders in the profession are
installing their own x-ray units.
  They find that making their own radiographs enables them to render better service, to make their time more profitable.
They soon become expert in interpretation.
And this ownership of an x-ray unit proves
to be not an expense, but an investment
from which they get a steady yield.
  The Victor CDX Dental X-ray Unit has
been a great factor in creating this vogue for
individual ownership. The Victor CDX
hangs suspended from the wall. It is electrically safe. Both transformer and tube, insulated in oil, are enclosed in the tube head.
There is no high tension current exposed
anywhere. You and your patient can touch
the CDX anywhere while it is in operation.
There is no danger of shock.
  Let us send you the facts drawn from the
experience of successful practitioners about
this modern unit. It makes radiography
almost as simple as photography. As you
start out, you cannot afford to be without
this important tool of your profession.
Ask us for details of monthly payment plan.

                            SYNOPSIS
    Edited wholly by students of the Downtown Division of the University,
" The Downtowner" has achieved a valuable position amongst members of
the evening classes. As successor to "Pitt Rivets", its news and features
have a distinct appeal for those who attend school after the day's work.

        The song and dance team have left the stage. The
curtains have been drawn. Footlights turn from brilliant white
to dusky orange and fade into obscurity. The audience is
leaving... leaving after witnessing three acts of the play and
numberless scenes... the final crash of a cymbal has finished
the orchestra's symphony. The song is ended. May the
melody linger on....

     Student Council, composed of sixteen members of the student body, half
Juniors and half Seniors, and at least two of whom must be women, is the
executive authority of the student body, and the supervisor of all student nonathletic activities.
     The work of the Council is done chiefly through its committees of which
the Student Relations committee is the most important. Other committees
govern assemblies, student elections, finance, and similar activities.
     Officers of the Council are elected internally, after the general election,
which is held in the spring of each year.

     The Pitt Band has partially been responsible for the pep and enthusiasm
which has been evident at assemblies and football games during the past
season. Last year the Band climaxed a most active seasdn-a season which
included a trip to the Durham, N.C. football game, to the Allegheny game at
Erie, Pa., and to the Parnassus High School game at Parnassus-by being
made a unit of the Reserve Officers Training Corp. Under the able leadership
of a student manager, assistant and apprentice managers the University
Band hopes to carry on the gold and blue spirit.

     The University Symphony Orchestra is the youngest of campus musical
organizations. Having grown rapidly since its organization in 1927, it has
reached a remarkable stage of development. At the present time it has an
enrollment of forty, all of whom are chosen on the basis of ability. This year
the orchestra has already made five public appearances, its largest performance
being at the Yuletide Festival.  It has also provided interesting and appropriate entre-acte music for the Pitt Players. It is expected that a short
trip will be taken by this group before the year is over.

     The Women's Glee Club is one of the women's oldest organizations on
the campus; it has steadily increased in importance since its complete reorganization in 1922. This year it has developed into a glee club that has
never been equaled in size and ability since its inception.
     Concerts are held annually at Carnegie Music Hall and in the surrounding towns to Pittsburgh. This year the club sang for the Tuesday Musical
Club of Pittsburgh.

various cities and colleges in the eastern part of the state have been accomplished. Many concerts have been given in the Pittsburgh vicinity, in schools
and churches; and a radio program has also been rendered sucessfully.

                                SYNOPSIS
     Known better, perhaps, to other schools than to its own, the Men's Debating Association is, nevertheless, noteworthy-distinctly so-in several
respects.
     Begun with a dual purpose, to give students training in public expression,
and to give interested audiences an opportunity to hear public questions
fairly and adequately discussed, the Association has, always keeping these
ideals in mind, expanded to include the largest forensic schedule in the United
States.
     Debates were held last year with twenty other schools and Universities,
fourteen of these taking place on a 4500 mile Southern trip made by C. J.
Phillips, Elliott Finkel, and Coach W. M. Parrish, between January 28th
and February 16th. Among the schools met were the Universities of Tennessee,
Oglethorpe, Emory, Miami, Furman, and Johnson Smith on the trip, and
Southwestern of Los Angeles at home.
     About twenty extension debates were also held, before high schools, women's
clubs, men's organizations, and other groups. As usual, the season was
climaxed with the annual Men's and Women's banquet.

                               SYNOPSIS
    Paralleling, in part, the program of the Men's Association, the Women's
Association has, nevertheless, adopted of late years a program and a spirit
peculiarly its own. In meeting representative teams from the largest Universities and in holding many meetings each year in extension centers and
before high school and club groups, the groups are the same. In subject matter
and its development the two differ.
     The Women's Association concluded this year a most successful program
which included trips through Ohio and to Washington, D.C.

     In 1923 the dramatic activities of the university were reorganized into
the Pitt Players; since that time the organization has evolved into a real
dramatic group.    This year the Players have produced several plays that
represented no lack of ability in dramatic technique. An increase in attendance
at their productions has proven a favorable sign to the Players. Several one
act plays were presented in towns surrounding Pittsburgh.
     In addition to their stage work, the Players have enjoyed many social
gatherings through-out the year. They have also entertained several famous
actors at these socials.

    A banquet, theater party, and dance featured the social season of this
organization, composed of University students of Slavonic descent, which
includes lectures and illustrated talks on their programs at the monthly meetings.
During the first semester, the club organized a theater party to see "R.U.R.",
at the Nixon Theater, held a Christmas tea dance, and participated in sponsoring an address by Professor Rose, of Dartmouth, on "Contributions of Slavonic students to American Universities." A banquet honoring the birthday of
President T. J. Masaryk, of Czecho Slovakia, held at the Fort Pitt Hotel
was given in March.

ATHLETICS
                         Athletics!!!
    An unbeaten football team in 1927... a team which swept the nation like a
blue and gold tide of power... Followed, in 1928 by another which bowed only
twice to opponents of known calibre... and in 1929 by another golden avalanche
which justly merited the championship of the East, and lost only to that tremendous
aggregation called Southern California...
    A basketball team which, in 1927 went undefeated, in 1928 lost only four, and
three of these on an early Western trip, and in 1929 lost but two of a long, difficult
schedule..
    A tennis squad which has ranked amongst the foremost in the nation, and track
cross-country, swimming, and rifle teams which have always been of the best...
    This is the recent record, in part, of Pitt athletic teams...teams noted not
alone for their power, their versatility, their sweeping, bewildering offensives, but as
well for their sportsmanship and clean play... indeed, a record of which Pitt can
well be proud...
[68)
    As the curtain rings down on the 1929-30 athletic season, the University of
Pittsburgh teams leave behind them memories which jog across the stage in the
form of an Eastern Championship Football Squad, a basketball team that dropped
but two games, and tennis, track, cross-country, swimming, and rifle clubs that have
crossed the land victorious.
    It is the leaders of those teams that we see at this performance.

            Because life is like a drunken man on a horse-push him on one side and he
       topples over on the other-because most of us wander through that life like pool
       balls, dropping into our destined pockets and rolling down the chute to do it all
       over again; because most of us don't know what to do with it, and yet want an       other which shall be eternal; because we need a few men and women to whom the
       doldrum monotony of life is so ghastly that they are driven to frantic off-center
       shifts, merely to get through the long, long day; because we need a liberal sprinkling
       of eccentricity, which is no crime-we have created this book. It is a book nurtured
       in the belief that we should deviate from the Republican norm of existence, from
       our mulish contemporary parade, substituting, as we go, the rarer qualities of the
       unique, the eccentric, the courageous. It was built because we do not like confirmed
       advocates of the Ten Commandments, or believers in the Golden
       Rule, or followers of the principle of Laissez-faire; because we
       believe that instead of acting like six day bicycle riders wearily
       grinding out the day's lappage, we should pedal to the very
       edge of the cosmic bowl and caper magnificently on one wheel
       while the race of men drone by. It is, in short, a book built to
       be different, an attempt to combat that feeling of monotony
       which so often engulfs us, to point out the delightful possibilities
       of life-a life which should be like a long white light, creeping
       from flame to flame, each meaning changing, no fire the same.
                                                                          p.

THE PEPPER PRIZE WINNER
Jf76]
The George Wharton Pepper Prize
    The George Wharton Pepper Prize represents the highest honor in the power
of the Student Body to give to one of its members. It is a prize of $100 given
annually by United States Senator George Wharton Pepper to the student who
most nearly represents the type of student the University of Pittsburgh aims to
produce. The prize recipient is chosen by a committee composed by one member
from each class of each school. This committee is bound only by the qualification
that the student selected must embody the ideals for which the University, in the
opinion of the committee, is striving. This simply means, as it should, that scholastic record, leadership in campus activities, and personality must always be the
governing conditions for selection.

                                  College     Got up with a terrific head and fur in my mouth. Feeling rotten and never going to touch
 another drop. Wonder what was in that beer?... Great to meet the old gang after summer
 vacation, though. Phi Psi's a great bunch, no foolin'... Got Charley out of bed and over to the
 Luna for breakfast, or is it lunch? Feel better now.......
     Rain falling steadily in silver sheets. State hall veiled in white mist..... Men in yellow,
 black, brown slickers. A blackened pipe trailing an acrid and comforting tang of tobacco through
 the damp air..... Feel O.K. now........
     House party. Early fall. Gold in the leaves, outside... Inside, someone playing soft, dreamy
 chords, and brittle tunes. " Beale Street mama, won't you come back ho-me? "..... applause..
 "More"..... Couples snug on the stairs. A laughing crowd around the punch-bowl. "Where
 the hell's my woman?"......
     October sunlight, gay and elusive, sparkling yellow...... Below, in the stadium, blue and
gold figures scattering through a crimson line. Called signals crackle in the crisp, bright air.
Tangle of twisted bodies. Wrench of a flying tackle. The final whistle...... Mums droop
against fur coats...... Twilight, blue and silver, tinged with the red and black of the mills....
Couples walking slowly down North Dithridge......
     Never knew her name-she stood alone in the thick, dark shadow of the hedge. Elm leaves
stenciled black friezes against the wall and threw distorted shapes on the sidewalk. Schenley
High a dull gray mass with twinkling windows....... "Have you a light, please? "....... In the
bright yellow glare a tiny, poised figure in evening dress. Tentative curves. The age when a
girl seems a strange combination of gamin, child, Madonna, and kitten...... " Thanks".....
The cigarette, red against the darkness, flared an impatient gesture. " I don't like nights. They're
so big and empty, don't you think? Nor stars, either. They're cold, and sharp, and cruel.
" Philosophy-girl of eighteen, man of twenty....... She turned and ran, back toward the house
where the Phi Psi's danced in the splashed brilliance of colored lanterns......
     Mad interlude after a dance...... "Let's run, you said". Just we two alone in a night
of purple shadows...... gypsy moonlight about you as you ran, tangled in the gauzy whiteness
of your dress, striking golden beads-incredible-from silver slippers. We perched, you and I,
on concrete steps, and laughed and smoked, for all things are trivial when one is young and the
moon shines so brightly. All things but love-and the tinge of color in your checks, the soft
sweet curve of your lips...... Three stars danced a stately minuet on the tip of the Cathedral....
Love, and the moon, and the stars......
Spring...... restlessness in classes... the first spray of dogwood...... Day trailing the
green fire of the grass...... Nights filled with the warm fragrance of a new world..... Spring.
    And another night...... later...... somber and dark...... no moon, but stars...... Tomorrow-graduation. The academic procession in cap and gown...... speeches...... a roll of
parchment. Four years-ended..... Fireflies flashed vagrant sparks in the dusk of Panther
Hollow...... a brave defiance to the stars......
