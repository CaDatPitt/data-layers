CTHEMATIC

THIS VOLUME OF THE OWL IS AN EXPERIMENT. AS
THE CHEMIST MIXES SUBSTANCES IN HIS TEST TUBES,
SO HAVE WE MIXED VVITH THE SOLID GRANITE OF
THE COMMONPLACE A CERTAIN RESTLESS GROPING
FOR THE TRUE ESSENCE OF THE BEAUTY THAT IS
ABOUT US. OUR ELEMENTS HAVE BEEN MADE OF
THE STUFF OF DREAMS, OF THE UNIQUE, THE UNSEEN.
WE HAVE PLACED FULLY AS MUCH EMPHASIS UPON
THE BEAUTY OF LIGHTS ON THE RIVER AT NIGHT,
OF A BROOK THAT SPLASHES OVER GRAY ROCKS IN
PANTHER HOLLOW, OF SLANTING SILVER BARS OF
APRIL RAIN, AS WE HAVE UPON BOOKS, AND LECTURES,
AND F RATERNITIES. OUR COVER PORTRAYS THE
SPIRIT OF ACHIEVEMENT THAT HAS MOULDED THIS
UNIVERSITY*ITS UP—TURNING BUTTRESSES LEND A
SENSE OF DIGNITY AND SINCERITY AND PURPOSE.
CRAYON SKETCHES DESCRIBE CAMPUS SCENES—MANY
OF THEM FAMILIAR, CHERISHED BY THOSE WHO
TRULY SEE THEM, BUT ALL TOO OFTEN UNSEEN.
THROUGH THESE SKETCHES AND THE INSERT PAGES
THAT RUN THROUGH THE BOOK WE HAVE ADDED
COLOR, LIFE, VERVE, A JOY IN LIVING THAT IS BORN
OF THE VERY VIGOR OF THEIR ART WORK. AND EVEN
AS THE CHEMIST DISTILLS FROM THE BLACKNESS
OF COAL THE ESSENCE OF THE ROSE AND THE BLUE
COLOR OF THE SKY, SO TOO WE HOPE THAT NEW EN-
CHANTMENTS AND NEW TRUTHS MAY COME THROUGH
THIS VOLUME OF THE OWL—COME FROM THE COM-
MONPLACE THINGS OF A CITY THAT IS BUILDED, NOT
OF DREAMS, IT IS TRUE, BUT OF MOUNTAINS, AND
OF RIVERS, AND OF STEEL.

PITTSBURGHESQUE

PITTSBURGHESQUE

Imagine a copy of an American college annual dropped on Mars and picked
up by a young Martian. As he turns its pages what Vision would he construct
of an American University? What would he learn about the University of Pitts-
burgh from this copy of the 1930 Owl?

He would see buildings and grounds, some of them of appealing beauty . . .

He would see rows and rows of faces of persons manifestly young, attractive,
healthy, well—groomed, happy, and more or less intelligent. . . .

He would see scores of groups of these young people, and would be assured
of their passion for fellowship and association. . . .

He would see thousands massed in the Stadium, to cheer the spectacle of a
few engaged in combat. . . .

From cartoons and sketches he would glimpse something of the humor and
joy of life on this planet. . . .

The young Martian would doubtless rejoice in these things as we do. But,
mirror as it is of student life and activity, the typical college annual would hardly
reveal to the stranger the true purpose of a University, for the University exists
mainly, of course, for a purely intellectual purpose. Its greatest effort and justi-
fication are to initiate each new generation into the thought and intellectual tradi-
tion of the race—its literature, its art, its science.

Truly the pictures in the usual annual would not serve as a fitting intro-
duction to the soul of the UniVersity—to its laborious quest towards a larger and
better knowledge of the world; the insights gained through rigorous application
and discipline; the masterful and creative use of the intellect, warmed and ex-
panded by moral enlightenment. Such triumphs of the University cannot be re-
vealed by the pictures in any book.

. . . .We have tried, in the 1930 Owl, to reveal just a little more of the true
message of the University to Mars than is usual in a year book of this type. Here
in the “Pittsburghesque” section, in particular, we have striven to reveal not
only the physical beauty of the campus, but the beauty of mind, the beauty of
achievement, the beauty of social contact, and, too, we have attempted to embody
the beautiful ideals which will be a part of our Cathedral of Learning. Here,
we have mirrored the life at the University of Pittsburgh at its very best, as it is
lived in the activities and associations of the campus. If the Martian can read
from these pages Pitt life as we live it and feel it, then the Owl can hoot with
happiness—his purpose has been accomplished.

I have watched them for many days, and I have heeded their

' example. l\Ien may say that they are only things of Wood and

stone, but to me they are a symbol of constancy. In grey days
and in fair they stand for all the world to see, and from them I
have learned always to be my true self. Fogs may come and cloud
them, and night may come and swathe them in darkness, but
they are always the same. Therefore shall I go and be constant
also. Unhappiness and misery, which are the fogs and darkness
of life shall not make me untrue to myself, and in the soft summer
winds of friendship and in the wintery blasts of dislike and dis-
trust I shall be true to what is really me. One other lesson I have
learned from them. The two up—pointing spires have taught me
to look upward and outward. They do not regard the streets
below, nor do they see the wrong that men do at their thresholds;
their gaze is ﬁxed on far horizons. In like manner shall I let pass
unnoticed the smallness and pettiness of men, by dreaming of
distant horizons. I shall walk swiftly and far, and I shall be gone
long; but a time will come when I shall return, and in that time
I shall have lived their lesson, and men shall regard me in honor
and esteem. Then I shall tell them of your example, 0 spires,
and all will be well.

You ask me to say, in a few words, what a college education ought
to mean in your life or mine. Well, it was said of the fourth Earl
Grey that “He lighted many ﬁres in cold rooms.” In such a
spirit, it seems to me, Earl Grey lived the meaning of a college
education.

responsible to the Advisory Board for the ﬁnancial soundness of
the activities. VVith responsibility there must be of necessity
some supervision, caused by the possibility of mismanagement
to which inexperience and enthusiasm sometimes lead. It is
the purpose of the Graduate Manager not to allow what super-
vision he gives to take the direction of activities away from the
students, because student activities exist for the student; it is
his aim to give the students ample opportunity for initiative and
self-expression.

Nlr. Rome also is associated with many important faculty
committees of the University, as a member of the Point Scale
Committee and Board of Nlanagement of Y. NI. C. A.

medical school. Dr. Huggins is a staff member of every well
known hospital in Pittsburgh, as well as a member of prominent
medical associations. He is a member of Phi Beta Pi, national
medical fraternity, and Alpha Omega Alpha, naticnal honorary
medical fraternity.

ADMINISTRATION

ALEXANDER M. THOMPSON
Alexander Marshall Thompson, Dean of the School of Law,

was graduated from Princeton with an A.B. degree. From Pitt,
he received the honorary degree of LL.M. In addition to his
duties as Dean, he is a prominent practising attorney in the city.
The Law school here, under Dean Thompson’s supervision, was
one of the pioneers in raising the level of entrance requirements
so that all of its students must be college graduates before ad-
mission. About two hundred and ﬁfty students comprise the
Law.School and the remarkable fact is that they are graduates
of some forty Colleges and Universities.

DR. HEBER D. CURTIS

Tired of the movies and want to see some real stars? Just
journey to Allegheny Observatory and see Dr. Curtis, who is
professor of astronomy at Pitt and Director of the Allegheny
Observatory in Northside, Pittsburgh. Since early in January,
Dr. Curtis has been with the Swarthmore expedition in Sumatra
studying solar eclipses, which is one of his many special studies.
He was also a member of this same expedition in 1926.

Dr. Curtis, besides generally supervising the work at the
Observatory, has done much for the advancement of astronomy
by designing and making several instruments for the use of the
Observatory. He was a member of the Lick Observatory staff
for several years, during which time he did nebular photography.
For a while he was in charge of the Lick Satelous Station at
Santiago, Chile.

Dr. Curtis received his bachelor of arts and master of arts
degrees from the University of Michigan, and his doctor of philo-
sophy degree from Pitt.

EDWARD RAY WEIDLEIN

Up through the ranks of student, fellow, senior fellow, assistant
director, associate director, and director—this has been the story
of Mr. Weidlein’s rise to the position he now holds, Director of
The Mellon Institute of Industrial Research. Before being ap-
pointed to his present position in Pittsburgh, lVIr. Weidlein was
connected with the Industrial Research Bureau at the University
of Kansas, and later was Chemical Engineer of the War Industries
Board.

Mr. Weidlein has been a most enthusiastic supporter of Pitt
athletics and other activities, being a member of the Pittsburgh
Athletic Association, the University Club of Pittsburgh (of which
he is now vice-president), the Pittsburgh Field Club, and the
Faculty Club, of which he was president in 1923.

For his experiments and research work Mr. Weidlein has
been honored both at home and abroad, having been awarded
membership in scientific organization in Great Britain, France,
Germany, and South Africa, besides several societies in the
United States.

Mr. Weidlein received both his bachelor of arts and master
of arts degrees from the University of Kansas.

ADMINISTRATION

 

DR. JAMES H. GREENE

Dr. James H. Greene is in charge of The Research Bureau
for Retail Training, one of the cooperative divisions of the Uni-
versity. Dr. Greene received his B.S. degree in 1908, his M.S.
degree in 1914, and his Ph.D. degree in 1920 from the University
of Illinois. Before coming to Pitt, Dr. Greene was director of
Junior Extension Work at the University of Illinois and was
Director of Personnel of Kaufmann’s Department Store, Pitts-
burgh.

The function of the Bureau as stated by its founders is “to
apply the principles of psychology, economics, education, and
sociology to the solution of retailing problems.” In performing
this function it has three phases of activity: research, training,
and service.

The Pittsburgh member stores are Boggs and Buhl, Frank
and Seder, Joseph Home Company, Jones Dry Goods Company,
Kaufmann’s Department Stores, Inc., Lewin—Neiman Company,
Meyer Jonasson and Company, Paulson Brothers, and The Rosen-
baum Company.

FRANK WILLIAM SHOCKLEY

Ask any student at Johnstown, Erie, or Uniontown what he
thinks of the director of extension work of the University of
Pittsburgh. For it is Mr. Shockley’s task as director of extension
divisions and summer sessions to supervise activities at these
three cities where Pitt has established Junior Colleges. Under
his guidance the student body has grown to more than ﬁve hundred
students in the three institutions at the present time.

Mr. Shockley, who received his Bachelor of Arts degree at
Indiana University, came to Pitt in 1925 from the University of
Wisconsin, where he was director of extension work. Besides
directing the extension colleges here, Mr. Shockley is in charge
of university sessions held in Pittsburgh during the summer.

DR. VINCENT W. LANFEAR

Dr. Vincent VV. Lanfear, Director of the Downtown Division,
received his Bachelor of Arts and Master of Arts degrees from the
University of Texas. Later, he did graduate work at the Univer-
sity of Chicago, and ﬁnished his graduate work at Columbia
University with a Doctor of Philosophy degree. He taught
Economics at the University of Texas and at Columbia Univer-
sity and then was called to Yale University as Assistant Professor
of Political Economy. From Yale, he came to the University
of Pittsburgh as Professor of Finance, and in 1926 became Director
of the Downtown Division of the University of Pittsburgh.

When the Evening School of the University of Pittsburgh
was first established in 1908, only a few business courses of a
practical nature were offered. Liberal Arts courses, however,
were soon added. In 1926, the demand for courses in various
schools became so great that the curriculum was extended to
include practically a complete undergraduate program. Courses
are now offered in The College, School of Business Administra-
tion, School of Education, School of Engineering and Mines, and
the Graduate School. The Downtown Division, which now has
a registration of over three thousand students, was created for
the adult men and women who, because of full time employment,
are unable to attend Day Divisions of the University. The same
educational opportunities are given them as are offered to the
Day students; and entrance requirements, standards and credits
awarded, are the same as those in force elsewhere in the Univer-
sity. The students in the Downtown Division range in age from
eighteen to seventy years, and numbered among these men and
women are physicians, lawyers, teachers, engineers, dentists,
dietitians, trained nurses, etc. The large registration in the Down-
town Division indicates that these mature, serious minded people
realize that education is a continuous thing; that one will go
backward as soon as one ceases to go forward.

HALL OF FAME

 

Pitt, they say, has no traditions. The old grads do not gather
at smokers and tearfully recall the ivy-covered walls and the broad
quadrangle of their Alma l\1ater, for her white brick halls perch
on a hillside. Pitt has no stone gateways and century old oaks,
no placid river over which rowing crews skim in the Spring, no
stately chapel with stained glass windows donated by millionaire
alumni.

But there are State windows. From the windows of the College
office the boulevards wind their silver ribbons around the green of
Schenley Park. In the early Fall dusk the l\r'Iosque looms against
the lights of East Liberty and the slender spire of the Baptist
Church slips between the stars. A world of green always shows in
the Library windows—under the bushes the lawns sweep up to
Alumni, the Heinz House rambles along a green hill, and the trees
slant long green ﬁngers against a colorless sky.

On rainy days the East windows are pictures of half—forgotten
things. The grey of Schenley High, the brown of the bluff, and
the red and blue tile roofs blur like the garden at home seen through
tears. During the silent, after—supper hours the blackness of night
turns the windows of the radio studio into mirrors, but along the
Drive lamplights glow like orange moons—Pitt, they say, has no
traditions. She needs none, she has the State windows and her
dreams about Frick Acres.

HALL OF FAME

THE GEORGE WHARTON PEPPER
PRIZE

‘ The George Wharton Pepper Prize represents the highest honor in the
power of the Student Body to give to one of its members. It is a prize of
$100 given annually by United States Senator George Wharton Pepper
to the student who most nearly represents the type of student the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh aims to produce. The prize recipient is chosen by a
committee composed of one member from each class of each school. This
committee is bound only by the qualiﬁcation "that the student selected must
embody the ideals for which the University, in the opinion of the commit-
tee, is striving. This simply means, as it should, that scholastic record,
leadership in campus activities, and personalitymust always be the govern-
ing conditions for selection.

IN THE PANTHER’S DEN

8

The last time I was here it was cold, almost snow time. All
the trees were bare; their branches Veined the sky like a myriad
of black ink strokes drawn by a palsied hand. On the ground
the leaves were spread thickly, so thickly that when I walked
they flowed around my ankles like muddy water; and then crackled
a dreary little song “VVinter is here, winter is here.” Only the
oaks were not bare. Stately and huge they were; and they swayed
in the wind like Gargantuan lords and ladies who walked a minuet
to the winds piping. Occasionally one of the dancers would drop
a handkerchief, and a leaf would drift down to join the others, or
ﬂoat on the lake for a while, and then sink. I wondered how it
could sink, for the lake was not a lake that day, it was a pool of
liquid lead that someone had ruﬂled with a feather . . But
the sky was not grey that day. It was gold and crimson, and the
clouds were purple. They were princes, and clowns, and puffy
fat animals, and they ﬂed away in a gayly colored procession, like
a circus parade. I watched them for a long while, and the sun
watched them too, but he was slipping into bed all the while.
Afterwards there was no more circus parade, only a lot of grey
phantoms. By and by the stars came out. They winked at me
as I stood in the dark cold valley; and even now I am not sure
that I did not wink back at them before I came away.

SIDEWALKS OF THE UNIVERSITY
OF PITTSBURGH

HAVEY BOYLE

I am asked to write something for The Owl. While I should have better sense
than risking dullness by giving in to the ‘
this, particularly to college undergraduates: You are going through what must seem

‘preacher instinct,” I should like to say

to you to be a lot of hard work. Perhaps it is. I never went to any college. But
I’d like to say I envy you. There’s a lot of things I don’t know, about which I am
extremely curious. I’d be a pest to the professors. I’d ask them about everything
they ever studied or experienced and I’d get them to tell the books they like best
on multitudinous subjects. I wouldn’t retain one-fourth of it, but I’d have a lot of
fun. If my economic position now would allow me to go to college I’d go. I don’t
mean I’d go with the aim to improve myself. I’d go just for a pastime. At 34, with
no formal schooling, I look upon education as a great adventure. lVly contact with
college men has shown me this:An intelligent man with a college education is sharper
than an intelligent man without a college education. An unintelligent man, it seems
to me, remains that way, college or no college. But enough of the humorous and
now for the serious:

I ﬁrmly believe parents do not send enough money to students. I prefer the
student who has a hat to the one with nice hair. I don’t like students who think a
football defeat has all but ruined the honor of alma mater.

I like professors, quartets, lectures, bridge, plays, books, and pumpkin pie.

Finally, if suddenly placed in charge of Pitt I would at once expel all cheer
leaders or make them wear less Richard Dix-ish clothing.

HOUSE NUMBER 1, FRICK ACRES

BLEAK HOUSE

There are indeed few activities that are not sponsored by one of the three Activity Centers:
Bleak House, “Y” Hut, and Heinz House. Together they make up the Trinity which houses
the young foundling organizations as well as providing offices for those of long establishment and
recognized prestige. It, the Trinity, acts as a safety valve for student emotions and prevents
student complexes from stiﬂed self-expression.

“Bleak House,” alias House No. I, Frick Acres, is the patrician of the three, for it is made of
real brick and houses the Literati and the Intelligentsia. Its chief characteristic is numerous
unlit ﬁreplaces whose main function, it seems, is to inspire the respective staffs of the Owl, the
VVeekly, and the Panther. The simplicity and lack of decorative design is general throughout the
building with the notable exception of the Panther office.

The “Y” Hut, on De Sota Street, is a relic of wartimes, but its usefulness is not yet outlived.
It serves primarily as a meeting place for men, but it occasionally becomes frivolous during the
annual rehearsals of the Cap and Gown Club. A new Hut will be built at the outset of the next
war, but if the Cathedral should be finished before that time, the present structure will be pre-
served as a memorial to something or other.

Heinz House, the “Cottage on the Hill,” is concerned with a ‘variety of things” and proves
that women have a yen for organization, if that need proof. A day’s schedule may contain any—
thing from Chapel services to a Tea Dance, or from tea for four or ﬁve women to a dinner for several
hundred. Panhellenic, VV. S. G. A., Y. VV. C. A., and the VVomen’s Glee Club are organizations
intimately connected with the daily life of Heinz House. Nlore than the other members of the
Trinity, Heinz House represents the variety and multiplicity of student interests.

THE 1930 OWL

We ha\ e worked long and diligently on the three hundred and eighty pages of this book. Some-
times, amidst the staccato plack, plack of Remingtons and the shouts over galley-proof, we have
wondered whether all this is quite worth—while. Ours has been, always, the problem of expressing
Pitt, not in terms of student spirit and activities alone, but of delineating the best that our Univer-
sity can give to the groups of students which form it. And because we have had that ideal ours
has not, we trust, been a hopeless task. It is easy to describe the rumble of coal-trucks up Uni-
Versity drive, the clang of cold steel in the mills, near-by riveting, klaxons, squealing brakes. It
would be easy to tell about the smoke that crawls in long, undulating tassels about us, and throws
little granules of soot on our noses. But we have tried to do more than that, more than portray
the commonplace things in the student life about us. VVe have tried to tell, as well, of dusk that
sharpens into twilight and twilight that gives place to a sudden, complete darkness; of long, cool
spires that stand up into the sky; of the park with its fringe of trees that the sun cuts into scallops
of green; of a student body that sees these things but cannot interpret them in terms of dreams and
ideas. VVe have attempted all this. We may only hope that in some small measure we have suc-
ceeded.

THE PITT PANTHER

THE PANTHER—-founded ﬁfteen years ago and in the
year of Our Lord. Produced at odd occasions from different
localities on Frick Acres, and will soon move its plant to the
now defunct Y Hut. It is rated as one of the best college
comic publications in the country and is at present collecting

dues from its advertisers.

THE PANTHER made its appearance on the Campus ten
times during the past year. Special numbers were issued for
the Pitt-Army and Pitt—State basketball games, a souvenir
programme of the Cap and Gown Club, and the regular

programme for Cap and Gown.

She had told me to wait for her, so I sat and idled. Just as
I was beginning to wonder what to do, someone called from the
steps, and I glanced up. Peg motioned for me to come up, but
she came down; and we chatted of this and that for a while. A
little white cloud came ﬂoating up over the tree tops just as Peg
left, and I watched it flirt and sway until a yellow roadster stopped
at the corner. Its driver opened the rumble, fussed in it for a
while, and then strolled up the street swinging his brief case.
He had such a funny walk! And that bevy of girls that cascaded
along and made him step into the gutterl Their little high heels
beat out a brisk staccato, like a telegrapher’s lever,until a car of
very old fashioned make drowned out all other sounds with its
coughing. I don’t know how it ever climbed the hill, but it did,
and for a long time after its passing little red berries dropped from
the barberry bushes and settled with a soft plop on the cement
walk. So engrossed was I watching their descent that I never knew
she had come up behind me, until warm soft hands slipped over
my eyes, and I just faintly caught the perfume that dwelt in her
coat collar.

STUDENT COUNCIL

 

Student Council of the University of Pittsburgh serves as the executive author~
ity of the student body by directing student life and activities.

During the past year Student Council has worked under a new constitution,
which has been generally recognized as much more eﬂicient and deﬁnite than any
previous constitution of the governing body. The present constitution clearly states
the privileges of Council members regarding their eligibility to other offices, and it
also stabalizes election methods.

The Council is composed of sixteen members divided equally between the Junior
and Senior classes. At least two members of Council must be women students. All
students who present a petition with twenty-ﬁve signatures and the approval of the
Dean of Men affixed to it are considered as nominees for election to Council. Oﬂicers
of the Council are elected internally immediately after the general election, which
is held in the Spring of the year.

8

The Student Council is the supervisor of all non-athletic student activities.
‘,3 The work of the Council is done chieﬂy through committees of which the Student
Relations Committee is the most important. This committee regulates the school
social affairs and is the most direct point of contact between the students and the
governing body. Other permanent committees are the Assembly committee, which
directs all school assembly programs, the school elections committee, which con-
ducts all school elections, and the Committee on Vocational Guidance, a subsidiary
of the Student Relations Committee.

The Student Council also has char e of the or anization of new student activi-
8 8'
ties, and decisions as to activity ﬁnances are subject to its approval.

WOMEN’S SELF-GOVERNMENT
ASSOCIATION

In 1895 women were ﬁrst admitted to the University, but not until 1912 were
there enough co—eds to warrant the establishment of women’s activities or to form
a governing body. However, in 1912 a meeting of all Pitt women was held with
the result that a Girl’s Executive committee, composed of one member of each class
of the School of Education and the College, was created. Though its existence was
for one year only, it was so successful that Dr. Elizabeth Martin, then medical advisor
to the women, was instrumental in the formation of another organization, the Women’s
Activities Association. The Association assisted in the organization of dramatic and
glee clubs, and sponsored several co-ed social events.

The present association, W. S. G. A., traces its history back to March 1920,
when the women of Pitt were given permission by the University authorities to form
their own governing body. In the fall of 1919, Thyrsa W. Amos had come to the
University as Dean of Women. Upon her suggestion, a Pitt girl had been sent to
the Inter-Collegiate Student Conference at Wilson College. In the following year
VV. S. G. A. was founded.

One of the important tasks undertaken this year by W. S. G. A. is the recording
of all the activities in which the organizatin is active, all correspondence received
by the chairmen of the various committees, and all events sponsored by the entire
organization. At the end of the year the accumulated material is to be bound into
a permanent volume that will form the standing record of all W. S. G. A. activities
on the campus.

INTERFRATERNITY COUNCIL

The Interfraternity Council, the representative body of the twenty social fratern-
ities on the Pitt campus, is composed of a junior and senior member from each frater-
nity. The chief motive of Interfraternity Council is to foster a cleaner and better
relationship between the respective fraternities, between the fraternities and other
organizations on the campus, and between the fraternities and the administration of
the University.

During the last year, Council, with the assistance of the Fraternity Committee
of the University, was successful in passing a measure whereby the system of deferred
rushing went into effect this past mid-semester. The essent-ial features of this new
system include second semester pledging of freshmen, a close restriction on the number
‘L of rushing affairs given by the fraternities, and ﬁnally a system of preferential bidding,

by which the names of the desired men are turned in at the office of the dean of men,
and the rushees are then interviewed as to their respective choices.

Serving as a social and athletic medium, Council sponsors every year many
events that draw the interest of the entire student body. The Interfraternity Ball,
one of the outstanding social events of the social calendar, is held in early winter, and
in addition, the traditional Interfraternity Smoker is held to foster a closer relation-
ship between the Greeks on the campus. In an athletic manner, the Interfraternity
Basketball competition, consisting of the teams of the fraternities in the council,
attracts a great deal of attention, in that the winner is presented with a silver loving
cup. In the spring of the year, the Interfraternity sweep—stakes are held as a part
of Pitt Week and later on the Interfraternity track meet, capping the climax of a
well rounded program of events. '

PAN-HELLENIC ASSOCIATION

Since 1915 Pan-Hellenic has been a campus factor which
has fostered a spirit of friendship and cooperation among the
women’s social fraternities of the University, which has en-
couraged chapters to take an active interest in all collegiate
activities for the common good; and which has regulated all
matters of common interest to the women’s social fraternities

on the campus.

There are seventeen women’s fraternities enrolled in local
Pan-Hellenic. One member is a local organization, sixteen
national, of which number thirteen are members of the Na-
tional Pan—Hellenic Congress.

Membership eligibility is determined by a unanimous vote
of the fraternity representatives and recognition by the
Women’s Fraternity Council, which is made up of faculty and

administrative Women and which acts as an advisory body.

"° PITT BAND

c A Wherever music in an official capacity is required, the Pitt Band has been the .5.
organization which ﬁlls the bill. It is this body which is partially responsible
for the pep and enthusiasm which is evident at assemblies and football games.
Last year the Band went off campus to welcome Pitt’s champion football team
upon its return from Pasadena. This organization’s duties continue throughout
the year, making its ﬁnal appearance at the June commencement. At present
seventy men take part in this activity, but the ultimate goal is to increase the
number until one hundred participate. Competition for appointment is keen,
since the members are selected from a large number of candidates. Perhaps
one of the most regal and striking looking bodies on campus, the Band can be
seen marching in perfect formation wearing the University’s colors, blue and
gold. As a part of its program, the Band gives an annual concert at the Carnegie
Lecture Hall in April. The organization is under a student manager, assistant

manager, and apprentice managers all of whom are chosen by a committee com-

K posed of the graduate manager of student activities, the faculty adviser, and the ‘

retiring manager.

UNIVERSITY SYMPHONY
ORCHESTRA

The newest of the campus musical organizations is the
University Symphony Orchestra, which has taken the place
of the Ensemble, now disbanded. The Orchestra made its
initial appearance on the campus when it played at the Yule-

tide Festival in the Winter of 1927.

The Orchestra is now composed of about thirty members,
but this number will be increased in the near future, as it is
apparent that there is a very deﬁnite need for an organization
of this character to supplement the activity of the Band and

other musical clubs.

WOMEN’S GLEE CLUB

The Womens Glee Club is one of the oldest women’s organi-
zations on the campus and has always been one of the UniVersity’s

most prominent and successful activities.

Since its complete reorganization in 1922, the Womens Glee
Club has steadily increased in irnportance~there are now about
seventy members in the Glee Club and this number is being
steadily increased. Concerts are held annually at Carnegie Music
Hall and in surrounding towns of the Pittsburgh territory. Both
the usual classical selections, and songs of a lighter Vein are used
in these concerts and are combined in a Way that possesses a wide

and popular appeal.

MEN’S GLEE CLUB

The h/Ien’s Glee Club is the oldest non—athletic activity on
the campus, and has always enjoyed a large measure of success.
Until 1927, when it became an independent organization under
its present name, it was a part of the Combined l\/lusical Clubs,
composed of the Glee Club and the Ensemble. In the fall of that
year, however, it combined with the Dental Chorus into the present
group of ﬁfty members.

The club has participated in radio programs upon several
occasions and has given a large number of concerts in churches,

schools, and theatres throughout VVestern Pennsylvania. On these

occasions a skillfully blended selection of classical, sacred, and ‘

popular numbers is given under the direction of Dr. \V. H. VVright.

CAP AND GOWN

“Yip-Yip,” or the story of a student’s cruise on the R/Iediterranean, written by G. Norman
Reiss, ’I6, with music by Gus A. Schnabel and Lewis l\/1. Fushan, Bus. Ad. ’23, and under the
direction of Walter D. Edmundson, is the tWenty—second annual production of the Cap—and—Gown
Club. The story of the show is based on certain events that took place on the S. S. Pantheria.
l\'Ir. Frank Further, inventor of a patent Weiner called “Yip-Yip,” was also one of the passengers
on the Pantheria. With the attempts of an ex—student promoter, Happy Day, to promote “Yip-
Yip,” there arose a series of complications which involve most of the students and passengers on
board the ship.

BALLS OF THE YEAR

During the four years that I went to night affairs at high school
I had to pass the hotel. Almost everytime I went by it the ball
room was lighted, and people in formal clothes were getting out
of cars and going up the steps into the foyer. How I envied those
fellows and girls! They looked so happy in their black and white
suits or bright ﬁlmy gowns. I was sure that they were having
a good time, although I had never been to a formal dance, and
did not know anything about them. But how could anyone
help having a good time? I always stayed as long as possible and
watched, but in the end I had to go. That was the hard part,
leaving. As long as I was there I could imagine that I too was
about to enter the ball room, but when I went away my imagina-
tion failed, and I felt badly for the rest of- the evening. But that
is all over now. I wear my evening clothes like one to the manner
born. I am going to my first formal tonight .

JUNIOR PROM J

Miss Janet Rockwell and James Lindsay led the grand march at the 1930 Junior Prom

held February 15 at the Hotel Schenley. Ross Gorman and his orchestra furnished the music,

T and entertainment by several Vaudeville and stage performers, including Teddy Joyce and Bebe
Falvo, proved one of the features of the dance.

A spirit of futuristic art was carried out in the decorations as Well as in the design Of the pro-
gram. Vari-colored lights focused On the walls and pillars Of the ballroom further enhanced the
decorative effect. From an oddly shaped box used as a grab bag, favors such as jewel boxes, doreens
and other novelties were distributed.

INTERFRATERNITY BALL

The Interfraternity Council of the University of Pittsburgh held its annual Ball in the Ball-
room of the Schenley Hotel, January 18, 1929. As the Interfraternity Ball was the only social
event on the Council’s Calendar, all efforts were concentrated to make it a big success. The ball-
room was decorated by the Pitt Players Technical Staﬁ to resemble a snowstorm and was named
“Eskimo Land.” Each fraternity had its individual igloo. Over three hundred couples danced
to the strains of the Cliquot Club Eskimoes who were attired in their eskimo suits.

The Grand l\/larch was led by Miss l\*lariOn F. Post of Collingwood, N.  and Ogden D. Gen-
sheimer, General Chairman of the Ball. Amber paper cutters with the newly adopted seal of the
Interfraternity Council were presented to the girls. The Chairmen of the Committees for the
Interfraternity Ball were:

ACTIVITIES

Those cold gleaming moon-lights of the upper campus lend a
bouyant glamour to nights sometimes oppressive with a promise
of defeat. Strangers unknown to university halls seek out their
golden aura when depressed of spirit and seemingly remote from
achievement. In their silent companionship there is a pleasant
illusion. They are like luminous spirits of philosophers whose
works lie in unfathomable tomes and whose shades stir at night
behind the yellow windows of the College. And this trespasser on
the campus, for one, always sneaks gleefully away with a happy
feeling of having stolen a bit of their greatness while those watch-
dogs of erudition, the professors, were Snoozing.

BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION
ASSOCIATION

In the school year of 1921-22, the Business
Administration Association was organized with a
dual aim. The Association desired to provide the
members of its school with some means of expressing
their social interests, and to promote the well-being
of the students as a group within the University.

In 1925, by an assessment made on each member
of the Association, an active fund was formed.
Following this plan in succeeding years, the organi-
zation found that such a fund made possible the
social events which it now holds for its members.

During the first semester of this year, in the
Association’s extensive program of social functions,
the outstanding events were two informal dances;
one held at the Schenley ballroom in October, and
the annual Christmas dance. In the second semester,
these successes were repeated with informals given

in March and in May.

COLLEGE ASSOCIATION

The College Association, due to a Well balanced
and attractive program, is again meeting with the
success that has attended it since its organization
three years ago. By means of a membership drive,
the Association has greatly increased the extent of
its membership.

The Association follows a deﬁnite program of
social events, planning two informal gatherings and
one formal dance each semester. The ﬁrst semester’s
formal was held in the holiday spirit of Thanksgiving
Eve. In the second semester, a boat ride was given
as well as the St. Patrick’s Day formal.

The Association was organized with a two-fold
purpose in view. It hopes that a greater unity of
ideas and increased progress may be attained. It
fosters the general Welfare of the students, as well
as furthering their social interests.

In addition to these social interests, the Associ-
ation has established a Student Loan Fund, drawn
from the surplus of the organization’s funds of the
preceding year. Any junior or senior in the College
may receive aid from the fund.

WOMEN’S ATHLETIC
ASSOCIATION

W.» A. A., organized in 1919 with a membership
of ﬁve or six girls under the name of the Women’s
Athletic Council, has grown to include hundreds of
Pitt women and to be considered as a major activity
on the campus. Besides‘ sponsoring the sports of
archery, baseball, basketball, dancing, golf, hiking,
hockey, life—saving, tennis, swimming, and volley-
ball, it arranges a social program annually. This
features the important Co-ed From, the traditional
Buggy Ride, peppy “rallies”, and the popular W.
A. A. Cabaret Health Week. W. A. A. promotes
greater physical ability; it fosters inter-class sports,
and in 1927 when it held its ﬁrst Play Day, it began
a program of eliminating inter-collegiate competition.

PITKIN CLUB

Pitkin Club, the ﬁrst organized religious group on the campus,
has been a factor in student life since 1914. The organization,
under the advisorship of Dr. Hugh Thompson Kerr, pastor of the
Shadyside Presbyterian Church, aims to acquaint students with
the various mission ﬁelds and their needs, and to promote interest
in Christian Work.

The club originated as a result of the ﬁrst Student Volunteer
Conference at Kansas City, from which a group of Pitt students
returned with the enthusiastic desire to create a non-sectarian
religious club on the campus. Dr. Elizabeth Martin, who was at
that time dean of Women, requested Dr. Kerr to teach and advise
the small group of students who had professed interest in the
religious ﬁeld.

The organization was named in honor of the services of Horace
Tracy Pitkin, an American missionary, who lost his life in the
Boxer uprising in 19oo in China.

Campus problems and remedies, missionary Work, the Bible,
and current political interests have formed the basis of study in
past years. This year the club is investigating problems of Christ-
ian life which are applicable to campus life, namely, prohibition,
the observance of Sabbath, and like questions.

The group meets every Friday noon at the Shadyside Pres-
byterian Church, and after luncheon the meeting is opened for
discussion.

YOUNG MEN’S CHRISTIAN
ASSOCIATION

For seventeen years the Pitt Y. M. C. A. has been an active student organi-
zation aiding University men in every possible way, promoting Christian fellow-
ship, and training its members and others in lives of Christian service. To
further this aim the yearly program includes the furnishing of student leaders
at various community centers, the organization of discussion groups and depu-
tation teams which conduct meetings on the campus and in city churches, the
holding of social functions—chief among these are the freshmen banquets and
the annual basketball banquet in honor of the Varsity team, the distribution
of Freshmen Handbooks, and the operation of the “Y” Hut as a meeting place
for men students. The executive secretary assisted by the Student Cabinet
directs this program. Each spring the active members of the Association elect
the oﬂicers who, with the committee chairmen appointed by the president,
compose the Student Cabinet. The members of the Committee of Management
represent the students, the faculty, the alumni, and the trustees of the University.

A ﬁnancial campaign was conducted in the fall, its goal $3,500, its director
J. G. Quick, registrar. Cabinet retreats were held in the fall and spring. Seibert

. Lynch was one of two Pennsylvania representatives to the Middle Atlantic

Field Council. Every year a Pitt delegation is sent to Eagles Mere, Pa., where
the Council holds its summer conference. In 1928, Pitt, with twenty—three men
and women, had the largest delegation.

This year a Freshman Cabinet was formed to aid the Senior Cabinet and
to assist the new students.

YOUNG WOMEN’S CHRISTIAN
ASSOCIATION

During the past nineteen years the University of Pittsburgh Y. W. C. A.
has had for its aim “the broadening of the spiritual side of the college girls’ life.”
This aim is only realized by a carefully planned program for each year. The
theme of this year’s program was “Broadening Horizons” and took the form
of a Y. W. C. A. “Flight.” “Take Off,” “Control Stick,” “Wings,” and
“Landing” teas were held in Heinz House at the beginning of the school year
to introduce the purpose of the “ﬂight” to the Women of the University. Other
“ﬂights” took the form of dinners, Freshman co—ed welcome meetings, and the
regular Monday luncheons Where the different departments presented discussion
programs. Religious, industrial, interracial, and world problems were discussed;
a better appreciation of the liberal arts was fostered; freshmen questions were
presented and answered; and a new element was introduced by the hostesses
in an organized consideration of etiquette. A group of girls volunteered to do
social service Work at the Irene Kaufmann, Soho, and Kingsley Settlement
Houses. The scope of their work ran from dressing dolls to teaching Bible
classes. Other members interested themselves in Girl Reserves. At Christmas
time the annual play, party for Soho Day Nursery Children, and Christmas
caroling were sponsored by the Pitt Y. W. In addition to all the local activities
the Y. W. maintained a secretary in South America. To support this organiza-
tion the candy and milk stands in the different buildings were managed, and
successful ﬁnancial and membership drives were conducted.

DOWNTOWN STUDENTS’ ASSOCIATION

The Downtown Students’ Association traces its beginning to I917, when the

Evening School Association ‘was established for students in that school. Later in

(1 the same year the name of the organization was changed to the Evening School

Association of the School of Business Administration. In order to open the Associ-

ation to all students taking work downtown in the various schools of the University,
the name was changed to its present form in 1926.

The chief objects of the Association are to encourage and engender good fellow-
ship and high scholastic ideals among the students of the Downtown Division of
the University, and to foster their social, educational, and commercial interests.
The organization holds each year a Christmas Dance, a Spring Banquet, an Annual
Bridge Party, and a Prom in June.

KOLLAR CLUB

The Kollar Club was organized this year to encourage and foster good fellowship
and to promote high educational and cultural pursuits among University Students of
Czechoslavak and other Slavonic lineages.

The name Of the Club was adopted from Professor Jan Kollar (1793-1852) a Czecho-
slavak poet, humanist and Panslavist.

The Club’s growth has been a gradual and steady one since its inception. Highly
interesting lectures and illustrated talks by prominent men and the sponsoring of social
activities including an informal dance have rounded out the organization’s programs
and insured the Club’s future success. A dinner dance in IVIay closed the social activities

of the Club this year.

AMERICAN INSTITUTE
OF
ELECTRICAL ENGINEERS

The American Institute of Electrical Engineers
is the national organization representing the elec-
trical engineering profession. The Institute has
contributed largely toward the remarkable progress
that has taken place in the electrical ﬁeld during the
last four decades.

This organization has established student chap-
ters in the larger engineering schools of the country.
The students in Electrical Engineering compose the
membership of the local branch. They hold Weekly
meetings to hear and discuss talks presented by their
members on engineering subjects. Once a month
an evening meeting is held at which there is usually
some well known engineer to speak to the members
concerning problems and methods of the engineer
today. The men are thus given an idea of What is to
be expected of them when they have received their
degree.

The outstanding event each year is the annual
banquet which is held near the close of the second
semester.

ACTIVITIES

MEN’S DEBATING ASSOCIATION

The 1928-29 season of the Men’s Debating Association marked the most
extensive debating schedule ever undertaken by an American university. There
were held during the year ﬁfty intercollegiate debates, forty-one abroad and
nine at home, and twenty—ﬁve extension debates at local clubs and schools.

The most important features of the year were the two February trips, on
which one team composed of Roger S. Hamilton, David B. Buerger, and C. J.
Phillips met twenty universities in Ohio, New York, New England, and Canada,

_debating Mt. Union, Ohio Northern, Oberlin, Findlay, Western Reserve, Syra-

cuse, Colgate, New York Teachers, Amherst, Boston University, Harvard,
Boston College, New Hampshire, Maine, Bowdoin, C. C. N. Y., New York, Col-

umbia, Ottawa, and Toronto.

At the same time, a team composed of Harry A. Sherman, W. Niles Anderson,
and Albert E. Leven, travelled to California, meeting Shurtleﬁ, Washington,
Colorado, Denver, Utah, Paciﬁc, California, Southern California, California at

Los Angeles, Southwestern, Occidental, Redlands, Arizona Teachers, and Mis-
SO1lI'l.

Home debates were held during the year with Penn State, Western Reserve,
Wittenberg, California, Bethany, Boston University, Temple, Washington,

and Carleton, and the team travelled on short trips to meet Waynesburg and
Washington & Jefferson.

It is the purpose of the association to debate for its own sake, and not to
score hits or win victories. Accordingly, it follows the policy of giving students
instruction and practice in public speaking and offering interested audiences
an opportunity to hear public questions fairly and adequately discussed, and
not making of debating a major sport or a gladiatorial contest.

The questions debated during the year were “Resolved, that modern adver-
tising is more harmful than beneﬁcial to society,” and “Resolved, that the jury
system should be abolished.”

Debating during the year was in charge of David B. Buerger, Manager, and
Roger S. Hamilton, President. All work was done under the direction of Prof.
W. M. Parrish and Mr. Richard Murphy of the department of public speaking.

WOMEN’S DEBATING ASSOCIATION

Since 1925, the VVOmen’s Debating Association has been the campus Organization which has
fostered cO—ed forensic activity. Women, who, after tryouts, are declared members Of the squad,
are automatically enrolled in the Association. From this body are selected the debaters who are
to represent the university in intercollegiate and in extension debates. This year the squad en-
gaged in six intercollegiate debates, namely: Penn State, Syracuse, West Virginia, Ohio Wesleyan,
and two with Cincinnati, as well as twelve extension debates before civic organizations. The
two questions which have been debated this year are, “Resolved, That the American Jury System
should be abolished,” and “Resolved, That Woman Suffrage has not proved a practical benefit.”
After every formal debate Or discussion within the Association, an open forum is held during which
time the audience Or fellow members are permitted to question the debaters.

PITT PLAYERS

In 1916, Pitt Players made its first appearance at the University as
a local dramatic fraternity. Four years later it was reorganized under the
department of Public Speaking. In 1923 the coaching of the Players was
undertaken by lVIrs. L. I. MacQueen, and in 1927 Mr. VValter B. Edmund-

son was made coach and director, with Miss Jane Ellen Ball as assistant.

To become a member of the Players one must demonstrate ability
both in individual and group tryouts. There are three groups of Players—
freshman, reserve, and active. Advancement to the active group is based
on a point scale system. The Players has its own technical staff, which
aptly handles scenic eﬁects in Players productions.

In the 1928-29 season productions were given at Henry Clay Frick
Teacher’s Training School, the Byron School of Oratory, and the Y. NI.
and Y. VV. H. A. In addition to their stage work, the Players enjoyed many
social gatherings throughout the season.

Probably the busiest spot on the Pitt campus is the second ﬂoor of

E the Faculty Club garage any Tuesday or Saturday afternoon. There is i
l » located the “den” of the Technical Staff, that invaluable adjunct to Pitt
Players which designs, builds, and operates all the scenery for the Player’s
productions. In addition to this, the Technical Staff provided scenic and
lighting eﬁects for nearly all of the dances held at the University this year,
as well as at such special affairs as the Christmas Festival and the Freshman
Fair.

SENIOR WEEK

The hope that Senior Week would become an annual event at the
University seems to have been realized in that extensive plans have been
prepared to make Senior Week this year, the second held here, a permanent
institution. Besides the usual events held in connection with Graduation
exercises for the departing Seniors, a full program of social activities and
features has been outlined, commencing with the Senior Ball, to be held
May 31st at the Hotel Schenley.

The many other events of the Week will follow the ball in rapid suc-
cession: among those scheduled are many athletic events, including the
Sweepstakes, the scooter race, and the VV. A. A. buggy ride. A Senior
breakfast has been arranged, as Well as Senior luncheons, the Gridiron and
the Dental School banquets. A varsity night has been provided along
similar lines to that of last year, and the Chancellor will again hold a recep-
tion. The Week Will close with the Commencement exercises, June 6th.

LE CERCLE FRANCAIS

Le Cercle Francais is an organization of students interested in the French language, customs,
and institutions, and their development in American universities. l\Iembers of the group speak
in French at the meetings. Programs are given by members of the faculty, outside speakers, and
members of the club. Professor Metour of the University and Mme. de la Neuville of the Penn-
sylvania College for Women have given very interesting talks this year.

THE CLASSICAL CLUB

The Classical Club, an organization for the development of interest in the Latin language,
is the oldest club in the University. From its beginning in 1845 its activities have consisted in
translating Latin plays and producing them. This custom has prevailed to the present, the last
production being The jewel Box, presented for the honorary languages’ fraternity, Sigma Kappa
Phi, last year. Among the most interesting traditions of the club is the celebration of the Roman
Saturnalia, a holiday period corresponding to our Christmas festivities.

One of the newest projects is the entertaining of high school Latin students in order to foster
a more spirited enthusiasm among them. Membership in The Classical Club is limited to sopho-
mores, juniors, and seniors Who are interested in Latin and include it in their courses. Dr. Stinch-
comb is the advisor. ‘

ATHLETICS

Snow, and sleet, and then more snow. The sky was a dome of
grey over our heads as Marge and I hustled up the street. All the
little vendors of trophies and programs appealed in vain, for we
were too busy keeping our footing to do much else; and the crowd
surged around us like logs in a spring thaw, justling us and making
the way much more difficult. At last the tall entry arch of the
stadium reared up before us, and we marched boldly up the steps.
However, We found there that our climb was only half ﬁnished,
for our tickets were good at only one gate, and that was around
on the other side of the bowl. A little disconcerted, we again
took up our journey. But ﬁnally, puffing and blowing, we found
our seats just as the whistle blew. Out onto the ﬁeld dashed the
teams; the ball soared in a long graceful arc; and the cheer leaders
contorted themselves into a thousand grotesque forms. Then came
the start, and for half an hour the breathless intensity of the game.
At the half a chubby yell leader raced up and down the aisles
distributing colored paper, and the candy sellers offered their
wares. The cheer leaders then arranged themselves in a straight
line, bellowed instruction, and then rose, their arms outstretched;
the crowd rose and fell under the spell . . Just after the last
play the band played the “Alma Mater”, and then Marge and
I walked out, a little slowly and rather quiet and thoughtful; and
I know that I, at least, felt a strange thrilling in my breast .

THE FUTURE

A blazing red sky flooded by the success of two national championship Pitt athletic teams
takes on ﬁre as Coaches Sutherland and Carlson look forward to the coming campaigns on football

‘ﬁeld and cage court.

Jock Sutherland has only to replace the all-American Getto at tackle, Captain Fox at guard,
and Honey Guarino at end to build up a football menace for all opponents. Coach Carlson can
put another national championship ﬁve on the floor by merely ﬁlling Captain VVunderlich’s guard
pOSlt101'1.

In football, victories over Ohio State, Nebraska, Carnegie Tech, and Duke will again throw
the Panther eleven into the national spotlight. Notre Dame, Georgetown and Fordham should
prove stepping stones for Charley Hyatt and his men in their quest for another championship.

Under the guidance of Athletic Director Harrison, the athletic council, Assistant Ath-
letic Director Hagan, and the board of coaches, attractive schedules have been arranged and
skilled athletes have been developed.

All-American gridders, high point scoring champions loom as Panther grid and cage teams
prepare to ﬂash the name of Pitt over the country again.

VARSITY FOOTBALL

Shades of 1927 appear on the horizon for the 1929 gridiron squad as one of the strongest elevens
Pitt ever had prepares to take the ﬁeld in September. With only three vacant berths from last
years team, and a wealth of material to draw from in the freshman team, Coach Sutherland aims
to duplicate his unbeaten record of two years back.

Setting up a record of six victories, two defeats and a scoreless tie with Nebraska last fall, the
Pitt football team went through one of the best seasons on record. Starting off with a 20-0 triumph
over Thiel, the Panther eleven gained steam and sent Bethany back with a 53 to o defeat.

West Virginia invaded the stadium with the best team in history and gained a 9 to 6 victory.
In preparation for the Carnegie Tech game which went to a remarkable Tartan team, Sutherland’s
men trimmed Allegheny 29 to 0. Syracuse and VVash—]elf fell in succession by good margins. In
the most thrilling battle of the season the Panthers held the powerful Nebraska team to a score-
less tie at Lincoln, Nebraska. Returning home, the Panthers handed Penn State their annual
Turkey Day trimming.

l\~Iike Getto, who was a unanimous choice for all-American tackle, was the outstanding Pan-
ther of the year. Joe Donchess, stellar Panther end, again received considerable all-American
recognition. Toby Uansa and Josh Williams were two ﬂeety backs hard to stop. Tcrn Parkinson
had a good year at fullback. Captain Fox, Guarino, DilVleolo, l\'lontgomery, and Tully had only
one first down scored through them all year.

VARSITY BASKETBALL

When Coach H. Clifford Carlson opens the coming basketball season, next fall, Panther cage
enthusiasts will witness the most spectacular group of ﬂoormen ever to grace the stadium court.
With the return of four regulars and the full list of substitutes, the Pitt mentor is looking forward
to an era of sustained victories. He is anticipating another undefeated season, despite the fact that
the Phantom Panthers will cope with a most impressive list of opponents. .

With the return of Charley Hyatt, for two years the leading scorer of the nation, and Eddie
Baker, sensational guard and point—getter, along with Poison Paul Zehfuss and Les Cohen, Coach
Carlson will have only the place of Captain Charles Wunderlich to ﬁll when the season opens.

The 1929 season ended with Pitt holding an impressive list of victories over outstanding
teams of the East. The ﬁrst three contests, played on foreign courts on a Western trip, were dropped
by the Panthers by close margins, but the tour was clirnaxed by an overwhelming victory over
Ohio State. In the interim of home games, Pitt took a number of other victories only to lose a
close one to West Virginia. This ﬁrst defeat on the home floor in two years was followed closely
by the biggest rout of the season when the undefeated Army quintet took their ﬁrst blemish at the
hands of the Panthers. The Mountaineer Victory over Pitt was avenged when the Panthers gar-
nered a thrilling decision over the West Virginia ﬁve at l\/Iorgantown later in the season.

VARSITY TRACK

With two Olympic track men and a wealth of good material in their ranks, Pitt cindermen are
in for a good season during the current campaign. Led by Captain Vic Pickard, vaulter, the follow-
ing men bear the brunt of the Panther scoring: Don Gwynn, hammer tosser, Pete Bowen and
Jim i\/IcCullough, sprinters; l\Iarshall Lewis and Ed Knoblock, hurdlers, and Everette Utterback,
_]uII1p€I‘.

When the Panther track team of last year Wound up the season in ninth place at the national
intercollegiate track meet at Chicago, it marked the ﬁnal performance of two stellar trackmen,
Gibby VVelch, versatile weight man, and Ken VVibecan, stellar sprinter. In this meet Gwynn took
second in the hammer throw to qualify for the Olympics, Pickard copped third in the pole vault,
and Welch took ﬁfth in the discus.

The Panthers started the season oﬁ‘ with two relay meets. Pickard took second at the Ohio
State relays. At the Penn relays the following week he again scored second, while Gwynn ﬁnished
second in the hammer, Welch taking second in the discus.

In the ﬁrst dual meet the Panthers overwhelmed Carnegie Tech 111 to 23. So completely
was the Plaid outclassed that they were able to take but one ﬁrst place. VVibecan, Adams, Welch
and Pickard starred, Welch garnering four ﬁrsts. Pickard set a new mark in the pole vault, soaring
13 feet 1% inches.

Panther spikemen broke ﬁve West Virginia records at l\/Iorgantown in the second duel meet,
winning by a 76 to 59 score. The West Virginia records broken were the marks of the I00, 220,
and 440 yard dashes set by Ken Wibecan, while Welch’s toss of the javelin for 182 feet 2 inches
and Don Gwynn’s hammer throw exceeded all past performances.

Coach Frank Shea’s undefeated Golden spikesters travelled to Penn State in the ﬁnal duel
meet of the season and received their ﬁrst setback at the hands of the Lions, 80 to 55. Although
the Panthers copped nine ﬁrst places the Blue and White thinlies took advantage of seconds and
thirds to score their triumph. Welch and Wibecan were the leading scorers, Gibby scoring 18 points
while Ken was responsible for 15 tallies. Welch took the discus, shot and javelin, and placed second
in the broad jump. Wibecan led the ﬁeld in the IOO yard, 220 yard, and 44.0 yard dashes.

Following the Big Four meet at the stadium in which Pitt ﬁnished a close second to VVest
Virginia, Welch, Pickard, and Gwynn travelled to Cambridge and came through with third places
for a total of eight points, placing tenth in the I. C. A. A. A. A. carnival. Welch heaved the discus

144 feet 10% inches. Pickard vaulted 12 feet 6 inches, and Gwynn heaved the hammer 163 feet
4 inches. ‘

VARSITY SWIMMING

Coach P.  Corr is looking forward to a good season in the tank for Pitt natators next year
when all but three of this year’s varsity lettermen and ample frosh paddlers report for the team.
Only two men, Captain Al Mango, back stroke artist, and Harry Robb, veteran distance man
are lost by graduation. Coach Corr can ﬁll these two berths, but when Pete Bowen, versatile
paddler, hung up his suit for the ﬁnal time this season to concentrate on track, the services of Pitt’s
ﬂashiest swimmer were lost.

Copping ﬁve out of seven intercollegiate matches and winning three of their four outside meets
at the P. A. A. and Natatorium tanks, the Panther swimmers concluded a successful campaign.
Defeats were suffered only at the hands of Army and Navy on a short Eastern trip. Decisive
triumphs were scored over Allegheny, Carnegie Tech, twice, and Wash-Jeff, twice.

One of the outstanding performances of the past season was the record breaking feat of Fred
Wooldridge. Wooldridge lowered the only tank mark of the year when he established the time of
2 minutes, 33 1-5 seconds in the 220 yard free style swim.

Captain Al lVlango closed a brilliant career in the pool for the Panthers. He ﬁnished the season
with a clean slate, not being beaten in an intercollegiate contest in his four years of swimming at
Pitt.

VARSITY TENNIS

With Eddie Jacobs, former national boys’ champion and winner of the Seymour cup last year,
in the lineup, the Panther netmen face one of the most successful season on the court this spring.
In spite of the loss of Captain John O’Laughlin, Byron Baur and John Lauler, through graduation,
the three yearling grads, Eddie Jacobs, Lou Levin, and Milt Cohen, together with Merton Baker,
captain of the frosh squad two years ago, Dave O’Laughlin, “Gyp” Wunderlich, and “Tom”
Hadden, of last year’s Varsity, present a formidable array.

Although the record of the past year’s schedule shows ﬁve defeats, seven wins and four unplayed
matches, the season cannot be called unsuccessful when it is recalled that only teams of the ﬁrst
rank, including Notre Dame, University of Pennsylvania, Swarthmore, Georgetown and the Navy
came through victors in these tilts. Handicapped by the necessity of using ﬁrst year courts in the
stadium, Coach Stephen’s boys went through a good season.

Captain John O’Laughlin and Byron Baur, flashes of the past season, played brilliant games
and were responsible for the showing of the squad. After a win as an opener, a loss to Notre Dame
and another win from the Tartan, the Panthers fell into a four straight slump, that was only broken
by a 5-1 victory over Juniata. Then followed in rapid succession, three wins over Westminster,
Penn State, and VVestminster again to close the season.

VARSITY CROSS COUNTRY

A team comparable to the national championship Panther cross country team of 1924 is in
the offing for Coach Shea next fall. Led by Captain Alberts, the Panther hill and dale outﬁt will
have in its ranks Gus Moore, sensational negro distance man, Caesar, ]erpe,Gaines,VVherry, and
Phillips. Moore is undoubtedly one of the best distance men ever to represent Pitt on the cinder-
path.

Following on the heels of last year’s mediocre team, Coach Shea’s cross country men failed
to win a single meet during the past season. The history of Pitt’s cross country teams had been one
of victories until two years ago when the material for the squad was drawn from a rather mediocre
freshman team. In that year the pathpounders emerged victorious in only one meet, the one with
Carnegie Tech.

Failure of six Veteran lettermen to turn out for the team this past season was the chief cause
for the team’s poor showing. The opening of the season saw Gus Moore, freshman ﬂash, Captain
Herbert Hoffman, Phillips, outside of the ranks. Gaines, a Veteran spiker, was declared ineligible.
With the nucleus of Caesar, Grossett, Alberts, and Jerpe, Coach Shea had his hands full develop-
ing a representative team.

The Panther runners started off the season in good fashion, losing to Allegheny by a one point
margin. The following Saturday, Carnegie Tech came through to beat the Pitt team by the same
score. Over a very difficult course at Syracuse, Coach Shea’s boys were walloped by a perfect
score. Penn State trimmed the wearers of the Blue and Gold by one point from a perfect score in
the ﬁnal meet of the season. Considering that Penn State and Syracuse every year are out ﬁghting
for the intercollegiate championship these four defeats were by no means disgraces.

RIFLE TEAM

The best team in the history of Pitt riﬂe competition is expected for the coming year, when the
largest number of candidates ever to try out are expected to answer Coach Wilson’s call for sharp-
shooters. Since the inauguration of intercollegiate riﬂe matches at the university in 1921, interest
has increased by leaps and bounds and now the Panther riﬂers are planning for a new range to
accommodate the candidates.

Pitt riﬂers have been somewhat handicapped by the small range in the Logan Armory at l\'Iaird
and Thackery streets, secured through the Military Department. With the prospect of a new
range facing them next year’s team promises to surpass the record of any previous Panther riﬂe
team.

During the past season, the Pitt marksmen felt the loss of two of the best shots of last year’s
team in Bill Homer and Kenneth Hinderer. Practically all of the men on this year’s team were
new men without much previous training in riﬂe shooting and Coach Wilson had diﬂiculty mould-
ing a strong team. Despite the poor ﬁring conditions, the Panther riﬂers rang up seven victories,
tied one, and lost six matches in fourteen encounters. Victories over Columbia, Virginia l\/Iilitary
Institute, Virginia Polytechnical Institute, Mississippi, Western lVIaryland, Gettysburg, and
Vermont were the highlights of a mediocre season. The crowning event of the season was a shoulder
to shoulder match at the Carnegie Tech range with Pitt, Penn State, West Virginia, and Carnegie
Tech competing.

Coach Wilson who replaced Lieutenant McCarthy during the past season had the following
men available: Millis, McKinney, VVhitney, Diver, Fronk, McDowell, Hempel, Stauﬂer, Atkinson,
and Starret.

ATHLETICS

CO-ED SPORTS

Carrying out the idea that sports have come almost to mean the participation
of the few to the deprivation of the many, and that we have emphasized our national,
community, and school heroes in all lines of sport to such an extent that we have
lost sight of the true Value of sports, Miss Margaret A. McClenahan, professor of
women’s physical education, was instrumental in doing away with the last trace of
intercollegiate competition for Pitt girls when the Pitt girls basketball team played
its last game in 1926.

Since that time an extensive intermural and class athletic program has been built
up by the Women’s athletic department. Its main agency, the Women’s Athletic

Association, promotes higher physical efﬁciency among university women. By its‘

policy of inter-class competition more co-eds have an opportunity to participate in
all sports. Under the enthusiastic endeavors of Miss McClenahan, and Ethel James,
both former members of the Varsity basketball team, a women’s athletic council
was organized in 1919. Two years later the council joined the National Women’s
Athletic Association.

During the past year, W. A. A. encouraged Volleyball, tennis, basketball, swim-
ming, hockey, dancing, baseball, hiking, golf and archery. For those not especially
interested in sports W. A. A. oﬁers a social program which includes the traditional
Co—Ed Prom, the Buggy Ride, Cabaret, and various mixer dances. Recognition for
service and participation in sports is awarded to W. A. A. members through a point
scale system, and various insignias. To the W. A. A. member who achieves the
highest number of points at the end of her senior year a W. A. A. blazer is awarded.
The W. A. A. pin award is given to all other members who tally the necessary 300
points. Members of the all-Pitt teams of the Various sports are awarded insignae at
the end of each sport season.

FRESHMAN SPORTS

Freshman athletics took the limelight during the past season, with undefeated teams in both
football and basketball. Although their varsity brothers failed to sustain the records of the teams
of the previous year, the frosh squads came through to uphold Pitt’s reputation for undefeated
records.

From a list of some ﬁfty odd candidates, Coach George Kowallis selected a freshman basketball
ﬁve which failed to ﬁnd its equal during the entire season. With the two younger Kowallis brothers,
Stephen and William, along with Al Wrobleski, all younger brothers of former Panther basketball
stars, the frosh mentor composed a quintet which was reputed to be one of the best in history.

Edward Hirschberg paired with William Kowallis at guard and formed a defense which held
opponent scores to a minimum. Jaffe and Lytle proved to be valuable substitutes at guard. Al-
though three men possessed excellent abilities at center, Brown managed to occupy the pivot
berth for the greater part of the season, with Miller and Kalb substituting. Lawry, Lustab and
Thiele showed their worth as they substituted for S. Kowallis and Wrobleski, forwards.

Named the best club in its class, the frosh gridders pulled through an unbeaten season last
year, Winning three and tieing two in their ﬁve game schedule. Kicking off with a 6-0 victory over
the Mountaineer yearlings, the Panther cubs Went through two more straight Wins over the Carne-
gie plebes and the Kiski Varsity, and then settled down to knot two with the Lion cubs and the
Vice-Presidents.

Coaches Wissinger and Gougler led the frosh through one of the best freshmen schedules in
years. After beating the highly touted Kiski varsity, the team that had taken over the Western
Reserves, the Navy Plebes, the Mountaineer Frosh, and the Carnegie Yearlings, the Frosh met the
Vice—Presidents who upset the dope to hold them to a scoreless tie.

On the team were several outstanding men who look good for the varsity next fall. Dapper
Dan Daugherty, the half who is being turned into a roving center, big Jim McMurdo, tackle;
Jimmy Clark, full; Johnson, half; Murphy, quarter; Kelly, half; Tamins, end; R. Morris, guard,
and E. Morris,‘center will bid for Varsity jobs.

ETA CHAPTER

Beta Phi Alpha was founded on May 8, 1909 at the University
of California, located at Berkeley, California with the purpose
of promoting friendship, sympathy, and aid among the girls of
the group. It grew rapidly until at present there are nineteen
chapters. Philanthropic work was started under the name of the
Mary Gordon Holway Scholarship Loan Fund.

The group at the University of Pittsburgh was started in the
fall of 1920 as Theta Gamma Phi. In May 1924 this local became
Eta Chapter of Beta Phi Alpha. An interesting tradition of the
chapter is the crested ring worn by each President and passed on
to her successor.

Bucky yawned a big yawn as he slouched into the room about
12:30 p.m.

“Where are those pledges? I left a note for them to Wake me
at 8:30.”

Eddy Was curled up in the window seat, trying to study his-
tory, but the soft spring Winds kept blowing in through the windows,
and he napped more than he studied.

“Huh. Don’t know. Ask Hilda.” he mumbled.

Bucky slouched out and only the clock’s ticking broke the
silence of the room. However, after a While, more of the fellows
drifted in. Bill had just come down from a session of oil and gas,
and insisted that he had to bathe to get the darn thing out of his
system. But after he had undressed somebody started a game of
bridge, and he sat down to play.

Jack just drifted down to the piano,-“You’re in Avalon
Town,” “ Blue Grass,” “ If You Like This,” “ Even Though You’re
Heart Is Breaking,” “You’re The Cream in My Coffee.” Then
he got his squeeze organ, and the fellows cut loose. Big Wee
Willy grabbed Johnny, and off they whirled out into the dining-
room, into the hall, and back into the living-room.

“Pretty hot, isn’t it?”

About four o’clock the bunch broke up. Some went upstairs
to play bridge, without being interrupted, several took their books
and settled down to study; some wrote letters; some went up to
the dorm and slept; some even went to classes.

The dinner gong brought them together again. Hilda got the
customary compliments, and Mike the usual lecture on the danger
of over—eating. After dinner, more bridge and then studies, and
so to bed.

GAMMA SIGMA CHAPTER

Delta Tau Delta originated at Bethany
College in 1859. The oldest existing chapter
is the Gamma chapter at Washington and
Jefferson College. There are chapters in
seventy-three schools throughout the United
States and Canada.

Delta Tau Delta entered Pitt as Iota
Chapter in 1864, and was re-established as
Eta Beta chapter in 1878. In 1879, when
W. U. P. placed a ban on fraternities, Delta
Tau Delta disappeared, not to return until
1914 when Alpha Alpha, a local founded
in 1904, became Gamma Sigma chapter of
Delta Tau Delta.

PHI KAPPA

MU CHAPTER

Mu chapter of Phi Kappa had its begin-
ning in 1921 when it organized as a local
fraternity known as Psi Delta Chi. On
January 24, 1921, a group of Catholic stu-
dents began what is now known as Phi
Kappa. In May of that year, they occupied
a chapter house in the East End district of
the city and were granted recognition by
the University.

In May of 1922 the Psi Delta Chi fra-
ternity became l\/Iu chapter of Phi Kappa.
Shortly afterwards they obtained their
present chapter house at the corner of Bay-
ard and Belleﬁeld Avenue, which they now

occupy.

nent business men of the Pittsburgh district are invited, for the purpose of encourag-
ing a more friendly attitude of the business world towards graduates of commerce

Cwens, national honorary fraternity for Sophomore girls, aims to foster scholar-
ship, leadership, and participation in campus activities.

The history of the Cwen, with her jaunty gray Cap and red feather, is a short one.
It was not until 1921 that Cwens began to serve the women of the Pitt Campus and
it was not until Pitt, Miami, and Missouri universities had united their honoraries
that the organization became national. The Charter of Cwensrwas granted by the

Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in 1926.

Delta Sigma Rho, honorary debating fraternity, elects to membership annually
no more than three men and women who have distinguished themselves as members
of the University Debating Associations. A minimum of three intercollegiate de-
bates and ten extension debates is required for eligibility.

By reason of its high standards demanded for membership, the 96 chapters of

group has maintained these standards, and election represents unusual Work in the
ﬁeld of forensics.

Members of Delta Sigma Rho have fostered this year’s debating schedule, the
most extensive in intercollegiate Work, and have been inﬂuential in keeping university
work in debating of the highest caliber.

In the spring of 1925, the Pittsburgh chapter of the American Association of University Pro-
fessors and the Honor Graduates Association of the University cooperated in a dinner in honor
of the students in all the schools of the University who ranked highest in their academic records.

The result was the organization of the honor students present into an association which took
the name of Pi Tau Phi. It has no national affiliations, and it differs from other honor societies
in that it recognizes scholastic achievement in all the schools of the University alike, instead of
conﬁning itself to one school or to one line of interest. Its main purpose is to encourage scholar-
ship in all the departments of the University’s work, Without discrimination. ‘

CAP AND GOWN CLUB

The Undergraduate Cap and Gown Club of the University of Pittsburgh was
organized in 1926 to amalgamate into a fraternal group all members who have given
at least two years service to Cap and Gown.

It is the wish of the Undergraduate Club, that its members through their con-
tact with members of the faculty and students will help to promote a more intense
and loyal interest in Cap and Gown productions. To aid in the accomplishment
of such an ideal the club sponsors social functions including smokers and dances

which students may attend. The Cap and Gown season is closed annually by a dance,
held at the William Penn Hotel.

Alpha Kappa Psi fraternity was founded in I904 in New York University and organized at
Pitt in 1912. It was the ﬁrst professional commercial fraternity and the ﬁrst national fraternity
to admit students of evening college classes to active membership.

Nlembership in Alpha Kappa Psi has always been limited to bona—ﬁde candidates Working
for a degree in Business Administration, regardless of whether or not such candidate is enrolled
in day or evening courses.

The ideals of the fraternity aside from the development of fraternal relations are to foster
scientiﬁc research in the ﬁelds of commerce, accounts and ﬁnance; to educate the public to appre-
ciate and demand higher ideals therein; and to promote and advance in American institutions of
learning, courses leading to degrees in commercial sciences.

Alpha Omega, International Professional Dental Fraternity, was founded at the
University of Buffalo Dental School in 1909. On December 3, 1920, the Odons Club,
an organization of Jewish students in the Dental School of the University of Pitts-
burgh, was granted a charter and is now the Omicron chapter of Alpha Omega. Since
that time, Omicron Chapter has experienced a rapid growth and today is one of the
most active chapters of the fraternity. This year, the annual Alpha Omega Con-
vention was held in Boston.

PSI OMEGA

NU CHAPTER

Psi Omega, national professional dental
fraternity for the advancement of interest
in the dental profession was organized at
Baltimore, Maryland, May 12, I892. Nu,
the local chapter was founded in 1897 and
went national in the same year. With its
headquarters in Pittsburgh, the most in-
teresting plan of the year is the adoption of
a system whereby all chapters will own their
own homes in a few years. On the faculty
of the dental school are forty—one members
of the chapter.

A JUNIOR COLLEGE LABORATORY

The University of Pittsburgh has recently constituted resident
centers for college work at Johnstown, Uniontown, and Erie.
The work has passed through different stages of development in
each center, but all of them started with late afternoon and even-
ing classes offered particularly for teachers. Later, summer sessions
were added, and ﬁnally Junior colleges established.

The University is a pioneer in establishing Junior colleges as
integral parts of itself. , The purpose of the entire enterprise has
been to bring a college education within the reach of thousands of
young people anxious and well-qualiﬁed to continue their educa-
tion, but unable to make the expenditures necessary to receiving
such an education away from home. Throughout the establishment
of these centers, the University has been guided by the realization
that it is, after all, a service enterprise, responsive to the needs ‘
and demands of an ever—changing social and economic world.

This rapid growth and change in social conditions has been due
largely to the increase in population. Thickly populated centers
have grown up in Western Pennsylvania with no other educational
facilities than high school can offer. The University has met the
need of earnest men and women who realize the advantages and
fruits of a college education. The Junior Colleges are but the
first step towards the fulﬁllment of this crying need, but their
initial success speaks well for the future.

JOHNSTOWN HIGH SCHOOL AND JUNIOR COLLEGE

JOHNSTOWN JUNIOR COLLEGE

The Johnstown Junior college of the University of Pittsburgh was established
in 1927, and opened with an enrollment of 142 students. It has grown rapidly since
that time and its students now number nearly three hundred. The courses are
exactly similar to those on the local campus, and are aimed to give equal educational
opportunities to worthy groups in thickly populated districts in the Johnstown area.
For the ﬁrst semester 1928-29, there were 90 class sections for 43 courses in 17 subjects,
all under the supervision and direction of duly qualiﬁed university teachers.

The Junior College is located in the new administration and high school building
of the city of Johnstown, a thoroughly modern building of beautiful design and in
a strategic location. One wing of the building is alloted to the Junior college, and it
includes eight classrooms, four laboratories, two oﬂices, and a girl’s club—room.
Several auditoriums, including a large one seating 1200, and a good-sized library,
are available for the use of the students.

This entire equipment operates under the direct supervision of Dr. F. C. Craw-
ford, head of the Junior College, and l\rTr. F. VV. Shockley, head of the extension
division.

UNIONTOWN STUDENT BODY

 

UNIONTOWN JUNIOR COLLEGE

The founding of the Uniontown Junior College is a direct result of an educational
survey made by the University in 1927-28 in southwestern Pennsylvania. At that
time it was discovered that Fayette county, with a population well in excess of 200,000
had no college within its bounds. Plans were accordingly laid for the location of a
Junior college in Uniontown, which is the center of trade and commerce of the county.
With the hearty cooperation of the local authorities, plans were accordingly put
through and the Uniontown Junior College opened in the fall of 1928 with an enroll-
ment of 120 students. For this year, only Freshmen courses are being offered under
the direction of ten full-time and six part-time teachers and administrators.

Almost the entire sixth ﬂoor of the Citizens Trust building is used for classes.
The classrooms, eight in number, are modern and Well—equipped. A chemistry
laboratory, lecture room and stock room are located in the Ella Peach Public school.
A modern and excellently equipped zoology laboratory is also located there. In all,
fourteen different courses are offered to the students, each of them of collegiate
calibre comparable to that obtainable on the local campus.

The Uniontown Junior College is under the personal direction of Dr. K. S. Tesh
and of Mr. F. W. Shockley, Director of the Extension division of the University.

SCHOOL OF DENTISTRY

The Pittsburgh Dental College came into existence, April 20, 1896, when its charter was
granted to Drs.  G. Templeton, H. VV. Arthur, G. L. Simpson, Wm. H. Fundenberg,  H. Beal,
and S. L. lVIcCurdy, who constituted the ﬁrst board of trustees.

At this time Allegheny County had a population of 700,000 and within a radius of sixty miles
there were two million people. The City of Pittsburgh contained schools representing all other
professions, but young men desiring to enter upon the study of dentistry had been compelled to
go to Philadelphia or Baltimore.

From its beginning, the Pittsburgh Dental College was afﬁliated with the Western University
of Pennsylvania as its dental department. It was controlled by the original charter members until
June, 1904., when control was transferred to Drs. C. R. Jones,  S. Ashbrook, S. L. l\/IcCurdy and
H. E. Friesell. — In October, 1905, the department was transferred absolutely to the Western Uni-
versity of Pennsylvania.

The College was located for six years at 71 I Penn Avenue, when it was compelled, by its rapid
growth, to move to Tenth and Penn Avenues. In 1905, continual growth forced it to move to Pride
and Bluff Streets occupying this location along with the Pharmacy College. In 1912, what is now
known as the Upper Dental Building was erected on the campus, but this was soon outgrown and
the present infirmary was secured.

With the present Junior Class, a new era in dental education at the University has been started,
it being the ﬁrst class to matriculate in the Five Year combined college and dental course, receiving
the degrees of Bachelor of Science and Doctor of Dental Surgery upon graduation.

CAMPUS STEPS, A PICTURESQUE SPOT ON THE CAMPUS
x S.)
A PITT STUDENT VVRITES '
T 0 F H A V A N A "

The most picturesque spot in Cuba is Havana. In the older
sections of the city are streets that seem endless and aimless;
streets whose very narrowness affords protection against the sun
and turns the shadows to a soft, cool lavender. Here the pulse
beat of the West seems combined with the color and mystery of
Old Spain. Time seems passing with slippered feet, passing with
the creaking of the ox—carts and the silent, trudging Chinamen
with their baskets of Vegetables. White-washed and delicately
tinted houses press to the last inch against the walk. They are
tiny, one—story houses with heavily grated windows, brightly
colored tile ﬂoors, and large, open patios. Here and there a tiny
pool, set in the center of a courtyard overgrown with exotic plants
and colorful blossoms, captures a choice bit of the sky with all
its blueness. Nearby, open—'to—the-street cafes, reeking with the
smell of garlic, yet seem to exude an air of suppressed emotion and
of mystery. Each passageway, each half-open door, whispers it.
It is as though we are looking at the past through wispy Cobwebs;
as if the land of “make-believe” has suddenly come true. In the
distance, are the Yacht club, the Jockey club, and the Casino,
with its dome of silver—white. Down by the shore are weaving,
feathery palm trees, ivory—like jasmine, and on the bleached
yellow sand of the beach, shy scorpions that curl up inside their
barbed tails. But it is the seemingly forgotten streets that I
prefer—streets that seem to be memories of Old Spain, and that
remind one of the ancient Arab proverb: “The eyes have seen and
the heart has loved.”

HEINz HOUSE, ON THE HILL, Is THE CENTER
OF MosT WOMEN'S ACTIVITIES

AND WRITES OF PLACES
NEARER HOME

Of all the places for dreams the best is the old, slat hammock
at our summer camp, down by the riVer’s edge. On any night,
I can see, to my right, the willows that dip their branches into the
murky waters of the Ohio as it slides in long, lazy ripples toward
Legionville dam, eight miles away. The last rays of the sun tinge
the oily waters with streaks of orange that mingle with the still,
white reﬂection of the cliffs above. But soon the water quickens
and just beyond it is streaked with frothing foam that creams the
tips of the waves. As it rushes on, it becomes a seething, tumultous
mass of muddy brown that hurls itself against the shore and recedes
with a peculiar sucking sound . . . But how different is
the view on the other side. There, the deep black of factory
buildings in the distance is cut against the sky. A tall stack, like
a slender, graceful obelisk rears up into the sky, while about
its base, shifting, purple shadows pile. Below it, the windows of
the building are like tiny blots of light that twinkle in the gather-
ing dusk. The dull red glow of the furnaces can be seen even here—
the red is colored with the tawny gold of molten steel—steel that
sprays the scene with sparks and changes the smoke of the stack
to copper. As I see these things, I can hear the sounds of a summer
night—the faint swishing of the water, the dull, distant rumble of
machinery in the plants, and even fainter than these, the distant
bark of a dog, the low of a cow, or the far—off crowing of a sleepy
rooster, all softened into a soothing murmur of sound. That is
why I go to the old slat hammock to dream . . .

THE BOULEVARD OF THE ALLIE5 FURNISHEB A DELIGHTFUL
VIEW OF THE RIVERS AND BRIDGES or PITTSBURGH

—-AND WRITES OF PITTSBURGH

Snatches of Pittsburgh, a la McIntyre: the staccato “tat-tat”
of rivet hammers on the Cathedral—the squabbling, squalling
children of Soho—Greek coffee houses ﬁlled with idle workmen—
hills which the sun turns to brown and greeI1—the slender, graceful
spire of the Baptist Church—the gaudy orange of Jewish clothing
st0res—r0ugh brick streets ﬁlled with holes and well-Worn ruts—
one man street cars—in the newer sections, stereotyped homes of
White and green—a garden, where sunlight steals through yet-
closed shutters and blends with the quiet smoothness of white
plaster—through all this, over and above it, the restless energy of
springtime, of the beginning of a day that is to be ﬁlled with
peace and beauty.—little shoots of green grass in the unused drive-
way dance with joyous sunny spots between them. A car rushes
over them. They shiver. Gay and peaceful and elusive as tremb-
ling cottonwoods by the breeze-caressed lake, as purple gentians by
the lonely roadside, as a violin melody far over the hill
this is Pittsburgh!

A Message to the Graduates of

UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH
DENTAL SCHOOL

OU are standing on the threshold of a new endeavor
. . . a new experience. Within a few short weeks, all
the hopes and expectations which you have held during
your years of study and intensive training will be crystal-
lized in the parchment that you receive acknowledging
your right to enter your chosen profession. You are fortu-
nate in starting practice in an age when science has
done so much to help the dentist of today, and when so
many forces are at work to make dentistry a proﬁtable
and pleasant occupation.

Ninety percent of the dental graduates of the world
deal with Ritter dealers and buy Bitter equipment. There
must be a very definite reason for such an expression of
faith. That reason is—that Ritter equipment has been
worked out to meet the exacting demands ofa specialized
profession.

Interview a Ritter dealer. Learn about our office plan-
ning service . . . our aids, free to you, in planning and
decorating your suite. Let a Ritter-dealer help you select
your location. Take his advice about equipment. He will
be frank and honest with you, and seriously interested in
your every problem.

The price you pay for success will be measured by the
hours you produce. Dental equipment plays an impor-
tant part in your daily program. Defective equipment
means lost time. Ritter equipment is trouble-proof. It
is the line that abides with you, helps you, and helps
to create satisﬁed patients.

Values must be judged in terms of service. . . Ritter
equipment renders a service in use thatdeﬁes duplication.

Make Your Practice Pay Better

Thousands of dentists ﬁnd doing their own X-Ray work promotes

systematic methods . . . accurate diagnoses . . . elimination of errors.

 

When a radiograph is desired the dentist with a
CDA’ simply reaches over to the wall where it is
mounted on afolding bracket, and brings it into

operating position as easily as hedoes his dental engine,

$100

down payment puts
the Victor CDX Unit
in your oﬂice. The
balance is payable
in 25 easy monthly
payments. '

   

Com/mrtness is another
feature in the design of
the CDX. Requires no
floor space, as it is
mounted on the wall
and out ofthe way when
not in use. The restless
patient doesn‘t worry
the dentist who uses a
CDX, for he knows it
is 100% electrically safe.

THERE used to be more argument than now

regarding the value of a dentist doing his

own X-Ray Work. That was before Dr. Cool-
idge (inventor of the Coolidge tube) perfected
the CDX.

Now thousands of dentists have installed the

Victor CDX. They are ﬁnding it increases their
production by promoting systematic methods,
by insuring accurate diagnoses, by eliminating a
large proportion of errors.

These dentists, since owning theVictor CDX,

have improved month by month in their radio-
graph technique. Through constant and increas-
ing use, they have educated themselves in this
important phase of the profession.

And this course of education has not been an

expense but a proﬁtable investment.

Costs nothing to investigate

You may think you “can’t aﬂrord to bother With
X-Rays.” But that’s What hundreds of dentists
have said. Then they looked into the matter more
thoroughly. Now these operators cheerfully ad-
mit that owning a Victor CDX has made them
better dentists . . . has paid them dividends in
cash and in prestige.

It is so easy to own a Victor CDX. Don’t

let“cost”Worry you. Make us show you that
it needn’t be considered. Just ask us on the con-
venient coupon to send you all the facts.

Y Y Y

O KEEP pace with the surg-

ing life of greater New York,
the United Electric Light 8:
Power Company has recently en-
larged its plant capacity by in-
stalling the largest steam tur-
bine—generator in the world.
Capacity great enough to light a
million homes is built into this
one gigantic Westinghouse ma-
chine. Ifits condenser tubes were

laid end to end in a straight line
they would extend more than 75
miles. The hurricane of steam
rushing through its whirling
blades converts the heat from
two thousand tons of coal a day
into light and movement for the
world’s greatest metropolis.
Y Y 1

Only an organization of the size and
resources of Vvestinghouse can under-
take the building of equipment for such
huge responsibilities. To young men of
enterprise and genius Westinghouse
offers great attractions becauseit daily
provides opportunities that are rare in
smaller organizations.
