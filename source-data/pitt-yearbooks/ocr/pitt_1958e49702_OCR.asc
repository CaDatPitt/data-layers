TO BECOME AN INDIVIDUAL
                                                    The role of a university in a com                                                    plex society is no longer a simple
                                                    matter of teaching those subjects
                                                    deemed necessary to constitute an
                                                    education. Rather, it is an amalga                                                    mation of many factors that en                                                    ables the student to ascertain his
                                                    identity in the face of the frighten                                                    ing sameness of the student body.
                                                    It is this seeking for individuality,
                                                    this casting off of the bonds of
                                                    conformity, that we are attempt                                                    ing to arrive at in many different
                                                    ways.
                                                       A university student has at his
                                                    disposal a multitude of means to
                                                    achieve this end. It is in college
                                                    that he meets his first opportunity
                                                    to disengage himself from the pat                                                    terns of behavior in which his en                                                    vironment has placed him.

cultural center
     EVEN EXOTIC INSECTS are given an attractive display in the Museum's
     nature study department. A brief, easily understood description ac     companies each exhibit. These explanations make the features far more
     enjoyable than if they were accompanied by a lengthy, technical outline.
BIOLOGY AND BOTANY COURSES can be supplemented by
field trips to Phipps Conservatory. The actual plants and flowers
make more interesting study material than text book pictures, and
the Conservatory is a more attractive classroom than those on the
tenth floor.
STILL-LIFE MODELS are in abundance at the Conservatory. Painters and artists can set up their boards and easels and, with little
interruption, practice their skills. Art students from all over the district use its green beauty to good avail, for its quiet dignity is conducive to concentration and creativity.

TROPICAL GREENERY in the midst of winter is available at Phipps Conservatory. Only a stone's throw from the Cathedral, the Conservatory offers botany in a painless form for students of the four colleges and three
high schools located in Oakland.
       FUNCTIONAL, ULTRA-MODERN SETTINGS provide
       an emphatic contrast to the Carnegie Museum's his       torical treasures. The exhibits, dating all the way back
       to prehistorical days, make use of indirect lighting, mod       ern color schemes, and stark backgrounds to achieve
       dramatic effect.
INTERPRETATIONS of modern art vary greatly with
the individual, but appreciation of it is almost universal.
In the Carnegie Art Gallery, exhibitions, such as this one
from the Paris Musee National d'Art ModernS, provide
an opportunity for district artists, students, and artistically curious to view art in all its diverse forms.

MYSTERIES of Greek architecture and culture are as interesting to a sixth grade history
class as to a college student. Visiting groups of all ages are continually touring the museum;
its wanderers have no age limits.
RENAISSANCE GRANDEUR, as exemplified by these
massive bronze Florentine doors, enable the history student to gain a broader perspective of the art and
craftsmanship of the period. Features of the culture of
every era can be found at the museum, and aid in understanding the people of the time.
School of Education draws on other fields
UNDER PRESSURE, these pre-ed girls take their entrance exam, which decides whether or not they will be able to enter the School of Education. Although this
is a very important test to the girls, it is just one more step along the way.
             STUDENT TEACHING at Falk School provides training in the latest classroom tech             niques. Here they gain valuable experience which will benefit them when they grad             uate and step into their own classrooms.
HELP AND COUNSELING in the selection of proper curricula and areas of specialization is one of the objectives of the School of Education. Advisors are always
willing to talk to future teachers about their plans and problems.
100
to keep high standards
      The School of Education was formally established on Febru      ary 3, 1910, following a continuous growth of the enrollment
      in courses in psychology and education which were first offered
      through the Psychology Department in 1904. Since that
      time, the School of Education has expanded the extent and
      the variety of its services. To the curricula for the training of
      elementary and academic secondary teachers has been added
      full provision for the preparation of teachers of business sub      jects, physical education, religious education, and industrial
      vocations.
        It is evident that the basic purpose of the School of Edu      cation is the preparation of workers for the profession of
      teaching and educational administration. While state depart      ments of education require that teachers have specialized
      preparation, the School of Education has interpreted its re      sponsibility as something more than helping its students meet
      state requirements. It has established curricula which repre      sent higher and more specific standards than are involved in
      state certification. In building these curricula the School has
      drawn freely upon the offerings of other schools of the Univ      versity.
        The School carefully selects its students, and helps those
      who do qualify to choose a curriculum which relates to their
      aptitudes. The students are directed toward fields where the
      need for educational workers is greatest.
       THE SCHOOL OF EDUCATION, established in 1910, has con       tinued to expand. Training in elementary and secondary depart       ments and in business, religious, industrial and physical education
       fields is available.
PHYSICAL EDUCATION is as much a part of the elementary teacher's
lesson plan as the three R's. Often the student teacher gets as much fun out
of these classes as the children.
A NEW DEVICE to measure and improve reading speed is the reading rateometer. A faster reading rate will help to make this future teacher more competent.

At night Pitt presents
CLEANING UP THE CATHEDRAL is an all night job, and the men and
women who keep the offices and classrooms in shape, supply much of the
activity around the school at night.
A REWARD for a perfect evening comes on the steps of the Residence as the Pitt Nurses
are brought home at night. A goodnight kiss... a parting wave...., and "I'II call you tomorrow."
102
a new face, but still hums with activity
   AN ENGINEER'S EVENING is spent at the Engineer   ing and Mines Fall Ball. Dancing, talking, drinking and
   playing "Signals" are all necessary ingredients for a
   successful affair, whether it is the Engineers' Ball, a fra   ternity party, or a sorority Spring Formal.
TAKING A SNACK HOME to the boys, a Pitt student
leaves the Luna, a favorite meeting spot of college students.
Pitt, the people of Pitt, and the Oakland area almost never
sleep. Indeed, a new life begins when the sun goes down. The
Pitt Nurses sponsor a dance; a foursome plays cards in the
dormatory lounge; a fraternity seranades a sorority house;
the gang sits at the Luna and talks of intellectual subjects;there are many ways to spend an evening in Oakland.
  As the evening comes to an end and night sets in, the activities slow down, but Oakland never completely darkens; it
merely dims a little. The streetcars still rattle along Forbes
and Fifth. People continue to walk the streets. Some restaurants stay open all night. Activity goes on, and over it all,
like a massive sentinal, towers the Cathedral of Learning,
the heart of Pitt.
  The Cathedral itself is never empty at night. Janitors and
custodians work their way through the skyscraper, cleaning
up. Marshalls spend the night at Pitt patrolling the building.
Staffs of the Pitt publications stay far into the night, trying
to be creative while fighting off drowsiness.
  Pitt at night, however, is not just a combination of entertainment and work-it includes a world of beauty. This beauty of Pitt is most apparent at night along the walks outside
the Cathedral. A stroll across the campus along these walks
lined with trees and bathed in moonlight provides a sense of
peace and serenity. The shadowy grace and elegance of Heinz
Chapel, the tranquil rolling lawns, and the majestic power of
the Cathedral silhouetted against the dark sky lend an air of
unique beauty, unknown during the day to Pitt.
103
"EMPTY AGAIN!" That same old problem plagues this Pitt student
as his friends listen intently to the latest joke. Many students top off
a date by dropping into the Luna or Hannah's to talk to friends or
soak up some atmosphere.
A MOVIE always makes a good way to spend an evening, either stag or with a date.
Others would rather attend the Pittsburgh Playhouse or Syria Mosque.
                        SCHENLEY OVAL is the scene of more conquests than the Stadium and the Field
                        House combined. Along its quiet dark curves, cars sit patiently, their radios softly
                        playing, their parking lights glowing, as inside them young couples talk, and laugh,
                        and kiss...

WORKING LATE for the publications, the writers and editors often
find it necessary to relax for a few moments in order to clear their
minds. Seldom does a night go by that the 8th floor is not lit up, as
one of the staffs works late to meet a deadline.

A TAKEDOWN is in the offing as Panther Ted Bienkowski slips behind his Lock
Haven opponent. The Nanticoke junior was one of the Panthers' top point winners
until he injured his elbow midway through the season.                                          THE POSITION OF ADVANTAGE
                                                                                               is held by Vic DeFelice against his foe

                      TUSSLING with his Mankato State foe, Tom Alberts has the situation well in hand.
                      Later in the match, however, Alberts dislocated his left shoulder, and the N.C.A.A.
                      champ was lost for the rest of the regular season.

Pitt's wrestlers
Riddled by injuries and graduation, the Panther wrestlers
still managed to turn in a successful season, carding eight
wins, two losses, and a tie.
  Two serious injuries, in particular, hampered the Blue and
Gold. Tom Alberts, N.C.A.A. 167-pound champion, was lost
in the sixth meet. He dislocated his left shoulder, making
him useless for the rest of the regular season. Up until that
injury, Alberts had a 5-0 record. Ted Bienkowski, the 147pound man, dislocated his elbow in the Lehigh match and also
was lost.
  Despite these injuries, Coach Rex Peery was able to juggle
his line-up to garner eight wins and a tie out of eleven meets.
The losses were to powerful Iowa State, 22-5, and arch-rival
Penn State. The Nittany Lions pulled the up3et of the season
as they edged the Panthers in the season's final, 14-11.
   A pleasant surprise for Peery was the performance of
sophomore Paul Powell of Lock Haven. Wrestling at 123
pounds, Powell had only a single draw to mar a perfect record. Other stalwarts included Eastern 157-pound king Dave
Johnson, Vic DeFelice, ai;d Alex Skirpan.
   In the'Easterns, Dave Johnson won the 157-pound crown
 for the third time, but the rest of the squad, riddled by
 sickness and injuries, could do no better than a fifth place
 team standing.
   At the national championships, however, Johnson was up set in the quarter-finals, but Paul Powell, who did not compete
 in the Easterns, surprised the experts by capturing the 123 pound title for the sole Panther championship.
TRYING FOR A PIN, Vic DeFelice keeps complete control over his Syracuse
opponent. The rugged Cannonsburg senior, wrestling at 137 pounds, was a
consistent point-getter for Coach Rex Peery. The Panthers draw heavily on
such hot-beds of high school wrestling as Cannonsburg, Lock Haven, and
Waynesburg for many of their top men.
TIEING UP his rival, sophomore Bob Irwin attains a position of advantage. The Panthers made
good use of such tactics to compile their seventh consecutive winning season.
107
Players present best in college drama
AWAITING MAKEUP are Nick Belich and Jay Dantry, as Rose Marie Greb braids
Alice Gault's hair. "Bus Stop" was the play under production, and make-up was
important to its success, as it is important to the success of any play.
The Pitt Players again this year proved their versatility by
performing a series of plays, each of which had completely
different themes and settings.
   Their initial production was William Inge's "Bus Stop."
 For this production, the Players introduced a novel theatrical
 concept to Pitt. They presented the play in the ancient
 Greek method of "theater-in-the-round" with the audience
 seated completely encircling the stage. Lead roles in this
 novel production went to Myrna Granowitz, who played
 Cherie, and Nick Belich, who was Bo Decker.
 Thorton Wilder's "The Skin of Our Teeth" was the second
 Player's production. This symbolic farce starred Jack Joy
 as Mr. Antrobus, Georgia Adams as Mrs. Antrobus, and
 Ethel Schacter as Sabina.
 From Wilder, the Pitt thespians moved to the current
 theater to do John Patrick's "Teahouse of the August Moon."
 Starring in this comedy of conflicting Eastern and Western
 customs were Al Stewart as Captain Fisby, Rheda Myers as
 the geisha girl, and Bob Honeygosky as Sakini.
 Much of the credit for the success of the Players must go
 to director Michael McHale and technical director Lloyd
 Welden, both veterans of numerous Player's seasons.
 During the year, the newly-formed Actor's Studio, an
independent branch of the Players, produced several one act
plays, presented free to the student body. These Studio productions were directed and acted in entirely by students, and
gave them valuable experience in stagecraft.
     THEATER-IN-THE-ROUND was tried out for the production of
     "Bus Stop". It was a different idea and created an unusual perspec     tive, better than Cinerama. The set for the play was a roadside
     diner somewhere in the Midwest, and the inclusion of the audience
     made it all the more believable.
FEMALE LEAD in "Bus Stop" was Myrna Granowitz, who played Marilyn Monroe's part of Cherie. George Swetnam played Bo Decker's guitar-strumming sidekick, Virgil, here accompanying Cherie in a number from the show.
108
CRITICISM of a Players' rehearsal by director Michael Mc Hale is
always one of the better individual performances of the evening.
His quick wit and Irish sense of humor make his instructions all the
more effective, but he can make good use of biting sarcasm when a
balky thespian proves obstinate.
"SKIN OF OUR TEETH" was a difficult play to perform. Thorton Wilder's
abstract history of man was a challenge to the Players' ingenuity, but they
responded in fine fashion with sterling performances, to make it one of the
better productions of the season.
A GYPSY'S PROPHECY comes true in the "Skin of Our Teeth" as the world
is inundated, by the Great Flood. Alice Gault played the Gypsy, and did a
fine job of capturing the mysticism of the role.
AT ATLANTIC CITY Mr. Antrobus,
of "Skin of Our Teeth," runs afoul of a
temptress named Sabina, but he regains his usual character and saves the
world from the Flood. Players in this
scene are Janice Hirsch, Georgia
Adams, Alice Gault, Ethel Schacter,
Jack Joy, and Norm Bloom.
CURTAIN CALL for the cast of "Brigadoon" was repeated many times tor appreciative audiences. Following the regular run at Foster Memorial, the cast was
sent to Iceland, Bermuda, and the Azores, where they entertained airmen at scattered air bases.
DETAINED from visiting his bride-to-be, John Wheatley
sings of his love for her while a bridesmaid, Rheda
Meyers, attempts to quiet him, as Players present
"Brigadoon."
REHEARSALS and more rehearsals are the secret to the
Players' successful productions. It is by this method that
they achieve their superb realism. Herb Margolis lifts Bob
White in a rehearsal of a staged fight for "Teahouse."
BACKSTAGE during a "Teahouse" dress rehearsal,
Herb Margolis and John Honeygosky run over their lines
while Al Stewart and Tom DiSilvio examine a suspicious
looking prop.
SHARP-EYED Director, Michael McHale watches a dress rehearsal for possible flaws. Although seemingly relaxed, McHale is ever alert and
ready to demand another run-through, less light, or more expression-any change necessary to improve the scene.

CHECKING THE RIFLES, Jack Cayton and Wayne Pensenstadler
prepare for a meet. Target rifles, being precision instruments, must
be handled with extreme care and kept in proper working order.
          Under the leadership of a new coach, the Varsity Rifle Team
          completed a successful season, had a perfect record in the
          "Postal League," and participated in a television "first."
            The coach   was Master-Sergeant John    Richardson, a
          veteran of 13 years of rifle competition. He is a former mem          ber of the Regular Army Rifle Team, and was one of Amer          ica's representatives in the recent Olympic matches.
            As members of the Greater Pittsburgh Rifle League, the
          squad compiled a record of six wins and six losses. The
          League, which is a member of the National Rifle League, in          cludes such competition as Duquesne, Carnegie Tech, and
          West Virginia.
            Firing in postal competition, however, the marksmen com          piled a perfect record of ten wins and no losses. In this type
          of match, the team fires at its own range, then mails the
          targets to the opponents to determine the winner.
            While appearing on the "Pitt Huddle" show on television
          channel WQED, the sharpshooters took part in the first
          rifle match ever fired over the T.V. cameras.
            Late in March, the marksmen went on a successful barn          storming tour of the East, firing against such teams as Navy,
          V.M.I., and Duke, and climaxed the tour with the N.R.A.
          college regional rifle match at Annapolis.
            Number one man on the team this season was Dick Simp          son, captain-elect of next year's squad. A junior from Ingram,
          Simpson received All-American mention and shot the sea          son's high, 291 out of a possible 300.
ABOUT TO LEAVE on their tour of the east, the squad aids in packing the station wagon.
These trips not only offer a chance to see new sights and meet new people, but are much
appreciated vacations from the tensions of classroom work.
112
OBSERVING THE TARGET through a scope, team members trace each other's progress. In this way they can keep their teammates
informed as to any mistakes they are making, and help them gauge for deflection. Marksmanship is a skill that is obtained by constant practice, for improvement can always be made.
PROPER KNEELING TECHNIQUE is shown to Jim Rekowski by Sergeant Richardson. Wayne
Pensenstadler and Jack Cayton practice the most difficult of all shooting positions, off-hand, or
standing. All positions must be mastered by the team members, for individual performance is
what counts.
AFTER THE MATCH, the men congratulate one another, and proudly
don their hard-won varsity jackets.

Though honoraries may range from

                                                                and common interests, and fosters a spirit of good fellowship.
                                                                It acts as a medium through which student problems can be

                                                                  These honoraries serve the entire university, not only by

                                                                with recognizing one particular course of study, they are able

Tuck Shop, Hunt Room-Pitt traditions
TUCK SHOP HUMOR, uninhibited and lighthearted, is an important release valve for the tensions that develop in a full day of classes. A cup of
coffee, a cigarette, and a hearty laugh is an effective cure for frayed
nerves.
BUSTLING ACTIVITY is synonymous with the Tuck Shop. Residents are broken down into three
classes; those who have just hurried in, those who are hurrying out, and those who remain for
hours. The latest gossip is exchanged, the opposite sex is discussed, and the newest "sick" joke
is related. No doubt about it-the Tuck Shop is an institution.
  Officially established and maintained as a convenient and
  easily accessible way for students to eat lunch, the Tuck
  Shop and Hunt and Pine Rooms have failed to achieve this
  goal, but have, happily, contributed a number of other in  valuable benefits to the student body.
    For fraternities and sororities, the Tuck Shop is a sort of
 center of operations, with their unofficial though tradition ally unchallenged booths serving as a home away from their
 house. Hastily scrawled notes, taped to the walls, proclaim
 tea dances, deliver messages, and aid in keeping the groups
 informed. In fact, Greeks claim the Tuck Shop is one of their
 strongest selling points in rushing, for it exhibits to rushees
 brotherhood on an informal plane.
   On the other hand, the Hunt and Pine Rooms seem to be
 populated, for the most part, by Independents. But the spirit
 and atmosphere is little different. Laughter still rings out
 across the rumble of voices, and friendships are made and
 sealed across brown lunch bags.
   Both places are ideal havens to rest shattered nerves after
 a test and serve as excellent loafing places for those with
 time between classes. The more honest of Pitt's students,
 admitting their laziness, slump over a paper cup of coffee in
 preference to going to the library and staring, past open
 books, at the streets below.
   Everyone complains about the food, the noise, the smoke,
 the crowds, and the jostling, but they wouldn't want it any
 other way. For the Tuck Shop and the Hunt and Pine
 Rooms, like pep rallies and formals and "Hail to Pitt" are
 that special side of college remembered long after the peri odic table and the date of the Magna Carta are forgotten.

116
A BRIEF PAUSE from studying is required when
a place like the Hunt Room is used. Extreme concentration is required to retain anything, although
many find its noisy clatter conducive to study. One
advantage is that there is always somebody
handy to help out with a tough homework problem.
INFORMAL BULL SESSIONS can be found in
any corner of the Tuck Shop or Hunt and Pine
Rooms. They range from baseball to Dostoevski
to segregation, and oddly enough, some very intelligent comments occasionally are heard.
THE LAST FEW MINUTES before an exam are

                          The wellNATURAL SCIENCES is one of the required fields in
which College students must take a minimum number of
courses. This is to insure him of a well-rounded education.
Here in the biology laboratory, one learns of the basic
fundamentals of the science of life. In addition to this,
the college also offers the usual chemistry and physics.
The field of psychology, though much newer and different from the others, is also recognized as being on an
equal basis with the other fields.
RESEARCH in the 6th floor library sometimes proves to be too much
for a struggling student. While to some people libraries are conducive to study, to others the vacuum-like silence does nothing but
put them to sleep.
A BELT IN THE BACK alone does not make a man
Ivy-league. He must truly desire to advance in all fields,
and using books for cushions is not the way to become an

OFF THE BENCH and into the game comes Bill Mauro, as his teammates
watch the action on the floor. Mauro, a 5'9" outside shot and playmaker
had the unenviable chore of replacing Don Hennon.
HALF-TIME STRETCH is a welcome means for relaxation after an exciting first half. It is an excellent time to discuss the game, grab a coke, and
even line up a date.
GOING UP for two points, Julius Pegues concentrates on the basket. One of
the best all-around Panthers, Pegues could shoot, rebound, and defend with
the best of them.
LEAVING THE GAME EARLY, Don Hennon removes the protecting pod from his
leg and enjoys a well-deserved rest. Hennon suffered a pulled muscle in his thigh
but it failed to slow up his scoring potential.

SPIRITUAL HARMONY is the contribution
of Heinz Chapel Choir to vocal music at Pitt.
Each Tuesday the Choir provides an impressive background to the University chapel
services. Their royal purple robes provide a
rich addition to the stately dignity of the
Chapel, and the hymns they sing emphasize
any sermon.
JUBILANT SINGING of Pitt fight songs is a sure sign of spirit at pep
rallies, bonfires, and football games. Student voices, loud if not melodious, glorify the exploits of the Panther.
PHIL KNISELEY, director of the Heinz Chapel Choir, vigorously directs a
rehearsal. The effort and concern that he puts into his work is clearly evident
in the outstanding quality of the choir's performance.

spirit through Pitt
From the solemn, classical hymns of the Heinz Chapel Choir
to the rousing drinking songs of a fraternity party, vocal music presents a broad scope at Pitt. In a formal, rehearsed vein
it is supplied by the Women's Choral, the Men's Glee Club,
and the Heinz Chapel Choir. Each of these groups offers its
members a chance to expound vocally, and at the same time,
provide entertainment for the rest of the student body. These
organizations present programs throughout the year, and often are on hand to add an entertaining note to other University events. The polished end result is no matter of luck, for
long hours of rehearsal are necessary for a sucessful presentation of every number.
  A more spontaneous and unrehearsed variety of singing is
also available at Pitt. At pep rallys, football games, and all
the other events where uninhibited spirit is the rule, Pitt students cheer, roar "Hail to Pitt," and "The Panther Song,"
and proudly stand to sing the Alma Mater.
  At fraternity and sororities parties, Greeks harmonize to
extol the virtues of their respective brotherhoods, to keep
alive such immortals as "The Whiffenpoof Song," and to improvise new verses to bawdy drinking songs. Small knots of
vocalists congregate in the Tuck Shop and Student Union to
render some of the current hit songs. This informal brand of
singing is also a source of enjoyment, though usually more
for the participants than for the listeners.
REHEARSALS are not all hard work for the members of Pitt's choral groups.
The opportunity for a joke is ever-present, even though there is always the
one naive person who doesn't quite understand the punch line.
ROUGH, UNFINISHED DECOR of the thirty-first floor contrasts

MUSIC in the Student Lounge in Schenley Hall is often provided by some
talented member of the University. A piece such as Chopin's Moonlight
Sonata, creates a mood of quiet beauty within the comfortable surroundings and aids in study or lounging.
       BLENDING THEIR VOICES in the rich beauty of a spiritual, the Heinz
       Chapel Choir rehearses until they get a song just right. Perfection is their by       word and it is shown in their presentations.
SINGING AT PITT is popular on all levels,
and ranges from university sponsored choral
groups, to fraternities and sororities, and on
to individual singing in such places as the
dorms and Tuck Shop.
SEEMINGLY LOST IN SONG, a member of Heinz Chapel Choir
is oblivious to her surroundings. The Choir, nationally known and respected, is the only formal coed singing group on campus. It proves
that the lasting effect of beautiful religious music can compete with
any temporary fads.
ENTERTAINMENT at the Chancellor's Reception was provided by the Men's Glee
Club. Everyone who has heard this group is highly impressed with their songs. The
Glee Club provides the University with the music of old favorites, standards, and
Pitt traditionals.

       Panther swimmers,
This year Pitt's swimming team faced a rugged ten meet
schedule and finished the season with a five and five record.
  Although the Panthers had a mediocre year, Coach Ben
Grady's swimmers turned in many fine individual performances. The Panthers did manage to beat both Maryland
and Lehigh, who were winners in the Easterns last season.
  Seven lettermen from the 1957 squad formed the nucleus
of Pitt's natators, and Ed Robson, team captain, was one of
the main swimmers. Other returning veterans were Kenneth
Cooper and Donald Weber, two of the four members of last
year's championship 400 yard free style relay team. Eugene
Adams and Willis Weisz, who won letters in 1956, also returned to aid Coach Grady.
  One of the team's big problems was in the relays, an event
which usually decides a close meet. Another problem was
the lack of a private pool, a disadvantage that annually
plagues the Panthers. Home meets are swum at the Carnegie
Tech Pool.
  Coach Ben Grady came to Pitt in 1939. His first team won
the ECSA title, and the Panthers then finished second the
next two seasons. After the war, Grady's first team was undefeated, and finished second in the ECSA. He also has
coached five consecutive league champions. Grady-coached
swimmers hold every University mark, and Pitt has won the
Easterns seven times, six of these under Grady's guidance.

PLUNGING INTO THE BACKSTROKE, two Panther swimmers strike out against opponents
from Lehigh in the next lane. Lehigh won the meet, 48-38.
ED ROBSON, awaiting the gun at the Lehigh match, was one of the
Panthers' big guns. A senior from Pittsburgh, Robson captained the team
and was an invaluable aid to Coach Ben Grady.
THE BUTTERFLY-BREAST-STROKE was the specialty of Ed Robson, seen here
as he approaches the finish line in the Rutgers meet. Robson's win enabled the
Panthers to top Rutgers in the season finale, 56-30.

FACULTY strives to not only teach student the basic fundamentals of one subject, but to inspire in him a healthy
curiositythatwill lead him toseek out truths in anyfield he
may encounter. This is done so that when a student graduates,he maysay that he has not only been taught,he has
been taught how to learn.
THE ADDING MACHINE, an integral part of every business office,
has become the symbol for the Business Administration School. Its
ultramodern appearance is therefore quite in keeping with the rapidly progressive business school at Pitt.

THOUGHTFUL GUIDANCE by faculty and administration enables
the Business student to go into the field ihat is best for him. He studies
exactly what subjects will help him most, takes them, and therefore
need not waste time attempting to search out some vocational goal
after graduation.
EARNEST Business student carefully follows lecture, notebook open to receive any notes of importance.
BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION LIBRARY, ranging from

                                                                 that "As individuals, we are weak; as a chapter, we are strong;
                                                                 as a fraternity, we are powerful."
AN ACTIVE, going through the line, need only buy enough for
himself and his girl...
... BUT THE POOR PLEDGE must go through for six or seven brothers, keep the orders straight,
make the right change, and smile all the time.

molds character
PRACTICE MAKES PERFECT, goes the saying, and fraternity
men get a lot of practice cooking, cleaning, sewing, and all the
other skills learned by house men. This might also explain why they
make the best husbands.
            AT THE FRATERNITY HOUSE the brothers find as much a home as is possible
            away from home. And although the brothers will swear they enjoy living there,
            nothing does more to make one appreciate Mom as living away from home.
THE TUCK SHOP BOOTH not only provides each individual fraternity
and sorority with a place to congregate during the school day, but is also
a fine place to loaf, drink a cup of coffee, or shoot the bull. Most important,
it provides a common meeting ground for all Greek letter societies. Here
they can get to know each other as groups, discuss I.F. business, and better
sorority-fraternity relations.
137
WHEN THE GREEKS GATHER for a tea dance, party, or to work on Homecoming, fun and
gaiety are the keynotes. By working and having fun together, fraternities and sororities
strengthen the position and prestige of Greeks in general.
EXCHANGE DINNERS and luncheons are an excellent means for
fraternity men to meet sorority women. Preparing the meal and
cleaning up afterward break down the feeling of formality, and
make for a more enioyable time.
COMPETITION within the fraternity aids in developing a spirit of brotherhood. In
pool, ping pong, bridge or a number of other fields a strong intra-fraternity rivalry
benefits not only the participating brothers but the fraternity as a whole.
                                             Vi                     -~

NEATNESS is required in sorority and fraternity house living just as
it is at home. Staying at the house differs from ordinary dorm living
in that the others you live with are your brothers or sisters, and not
merely roommates.
FIRST PLACE TROPHY for Homecoming is awarded to Audrey Harris of Phi Sigma
Sigma and Rick DeLuca of Phi Kappa by Nancy Houlihan, Homecoming Queen.
Competition between the Greeks, such as Homecoming, Greeks Week, and Spring
Carnival aid the fraternities and sororities individually, and improve the overall
campus life of the University.
A STREETCAR is transformed into the scene for a party by an ingenious fraternity and sorority. Greeks continually try to outdo each other in originality, a situation that leads to some zany
results-Hawaiian Hops, complete with sand in the basement; pajama party date affairs;
and Roman parties, including togas, female slaves, and grape bunches.
139
A NIGHT IN WITH THE BOYS watching TV, playing cards, or just
reminiscing about old adventures is a pleasant relief from movie going,
dancing, and partying. A group's true cohesiveness is often evidenced by
their ability to enjoy stag activities, either planned or impromptu.
CHRISTMAS IS NOT NECESSARY for sorority girls or fraternity
men to feel the spirit of fellowship and good will. They have it all
year round, for the brotherhood or sisterhood of these societies is
a unique quality that non-members can scarcely imagine.
                            A GROUP'S SPIRIT is always dem                            onstrated by their singing. Good rol                            licking fraternity songs or sweet, gen                            tle sorority songs connote the group
                            with spirit, the group who is active,
                            the group with brotherhood. Al                            though tempers may fly, as in any
                            group, things are soon patched up
                            because they are brothers. But woe
                            to the outsider who can not argue
                            with one fraternity man, but must ar                            gue with all his brothers, too.
140
A DATE between a fraternity man and a sorority woman is usually easy to arrange, for both share a common ground. They may have met at a tea-dance
or while working together on Spring Carnival. They see each other in the Tuck Shop, and find that they have the same ideas, interests, and friends. A series
of dates follow, some at fraternity and sorority functions. He meets all of her sisters, and she is introduced to his brothers. Then, if all goes well, they become
pinned, and she proudly wears his pin next to hers.
                                                                        141

a layer of carbon lamp black and the rope-climber must

     Injuries fail to keep
The Panther Gymnasts finished their third season in the
Eastern Collegiate Athletic Conference in fourth place with a
3-3 record. For the overall season the Blue and Gold registered a 6-3 mark.
  Injuries hurt the Jungle Cats throughout the season. Dave
Hirst, last year's leading scorer did not compete in any meets
this campaign because of an elbow injury suffered in practice.
  John Hammond, runner-up to Hirst in the scoring race
last year, underwent a knee operation between seasons and
was not up to his usual standards this campaign. Nevertheless, he added many points on flying rings and parallel bars.
  Co-captains Tom Darling and Jim Mulvihill were the
Panthers' leading scorers. Mulvihill competed in side horse,
parallel bars, and high bar.
  Darling, who is Skyscraper U's only All-American gymnast, was undefeated in flying rings in nine duel meets this
campaign. He also scored several firsts on the high bar, and
occasionally participated in the tumbling events.
  Don Neeld was able to gather six first place finishes in his
speciality, tumbling. John Cacolice, Joe Battaglia, and John
Felman handled the rope climb event, with Cacolice usually
showing the way.
  Tom Treese was the third man on the rings this year.
John Marchinko competed on parallel and high bars, and
Don Shima and Don Kasner added points on parallel bars.

TOM DARLING, N.C.A.A. flying rings champion, is one of the mainstays
of the Panther gymnasts. A senior from Philadelphia, he was unapproachable in his specialty, and added valuable points to the Panther cause.
gymnasts from a successful season
    SWINGING AROUND on the side horse, Jim Mulvihill
    seems to be exerting little effort. In reality, gymnastics,
    perhaps more than any other sport, requires perfect
    muscular co-ordination. Pitt students have finally discov    ered gymnastics; they have found that it is one of the
    most entertaining of spectator sports. Although the day
    is yet to come when the Field House will be packed for
    a meet, but fortunately, the day is gone forever when
    only relatives and a few curious students attend the
    events.
PANTHER GYMNASTS carefully watch the performances of their teammates
and point out any mistakes or methods of improvement. Points are awarded for
the difficulty of the performance, and therefore practice and more practice is
necessary.
THE FLYING RINGS, one of the most spectacular of the
gymnastic events, is the specialty of Tom Treese. This
event is the particular favorite of fans.
                                                                             Pitt Dances help
                                                                    FORMALLY ATTIRED couples glided across the Commons Room floor at
                                                                    the Christmas Ball. There is a certain proud solemnity about going to a dance
                                                                    in a tuxedo or formal gown that makes it an unforgettable experience, and

THE HOKEY-POKEY was one of the many novelty numbers used tp provide variety at dances. This type of number is often used to aid the
couples in getting acquainted, and provides a laugh for everyone.

build campus life
The friendly, gregarious spirit which pervades the whole atmosphere of Pitt is probably most evident at the university
dances. Every dance at Pitt is always jammed to capacity,
for the funloving Pitt students take every opportunity to
enjoy a night out. No month's social calendar fails to contain
a major dance of some sort.
   The Fall Kickoff Dance, Student Union Crewneck Hops,
 and Class-sponsored dances are usually informal record hops
 where the students can casually mix and meet, while during
 the year, good combos appear at dances during Homecoming,
 Greek Week, and at Fraternity parties. In the more formal
 vein, the Christmas Commons Room Ball, the Interfrater nity, and Panhellenic Balls, and the Military Ball supply the
 brightest spots in the social year. The Engineering and Mines
 School, which always demonstrates an abundance of spirit,
 sponsors the E &amp; M Ball as their main fling.
   The words "Pitt Dances" conjure up, in the mind, pictures
 of throngs of laughing people, whirling dancers, gowns and
 tuxedos, the new Ballroom, punchbowls, a guy and his girl.
 Everyone has the same general ideas about dances, but for
 some, they have a more personal, intimate connotation. One
 fellow may remember the first time he met his sweetheart; a
 girl recalls the perfect night when her boy friend asked her to
 wear his fraternity pin; and another girl thinks, with fond
 memories, about her first college formal. Dances at Pitt have
 led to many things, and the students do not soon forget the
 wonderful times that made up campus dances, and in turn, a
 part of college life.
HAMMING IT UP, the Ben Rossi Quartet combines comedy with music at one
of the Student Union dances. From combos to full-sized bands and back to record
hops, Pitt's dances took in every possible mode of music making.
NIGHT CLUB-LIKE atmosphere is present at the Student Union dances. The acquisition of the old Schenley Hotel gave the University an excellent location for dances of every size, from all-University affairs, such as the biweekly Union hops, to special group functions, such as the Greek
Week Dance.

with spirit, enthusiasm
    "GOAL TO GO" is the situation as some of the freshmen football
    players win another game and pick more points in their section's
    drive toward winning the Freshman Camp Cup.
THE OUTDOOR CHAPEL of Camp Kon-O-Kwee is nestled in a peaceful little glen. It was here
that the Protestant services were held while Mass for the Catholic campers was held in nearby
Zeleinople.
INTRODUCING GUESTS was only one of chairman Bob Richardson's many chores. He and his staff worked hard to insure the Camp's
success.
CROWNING of the Military Ball Queen, Evelyn Hrapchak, was performed
by last year's queen, Lois Coss. Miss Hrapchak was chosen from a field of
seven candidates, representing the seven ROTC organizations, and the
basic and advanced corps.
ESCORTING Miss Hrapchak is Walt Smith, Commander
of Arnold Air Society, the organization that sponsored
her. Crossed sabers of the Scabbard and Blade Saber
Drill Team made a glittering arch-way for the Queen,
and all the pomp and majesty of the military, added to
the festivity of a formal ball, made her crowning all the
more impressive.
SIGNALS, the perennially favorite drinking game, is an entertaining diversion from an evening of dancing. Engineers at the E &amp; M Ball made good
use of it when Bill LeRoy's band took its breaks.
GAIETY, laughter, companionship-all these elements go hand in
hand with dances. They are perfect occasions for mingling with old
friends and making new ones, for the relaxed atmosphere makes
everyone feel at ease.
SPINNING to the Mexican Hat Dance, a laughing couple throws caution to the
winds as they thoroughly enjoy themselves at a Mixer Dance. The secret to having
a good time at a dance is often to cast off all inhibitions and aim only to have fun.
RHUMBING at the E &amp; M Ball, a couple concentrates on the tricky footwork. With the recent development of the cha-cha fad, Latin American
music has once again become popular at dances of every kind.

Squash team has another losing year
RETURNING A SERVE, Jim Groninger intently traces the bounce of the
ball. Constant awareness of the opponent's position is a necessity in winning
a squash match.
GROVER PHILLIPPI, left, serves to begin the game...
Pitt's racqueteers put up a valiant effort this year, but it
was to no avail, for they lost all four of their matches.
Showing much improvement over previous years, the racquetmen played good individual games, but only Dave
Mason, sophomore ace, was able to win against Pitt's strong
opponents. Mason saved the team from being shutout in all
but one of their games. Only the crack Yale team was hot
enough to pull a win over Mason and blank the Panthers.
  Squash, still in its infancy at Pitt, is a difficult sport to
master. It takes almost five years to become proficient at
squash, and so the main trouble plaguing Coach Jim Tully
is the fact that by the time a man becomes expert at the
sport, he graduates. Mason was one of the few boys who
played squash while he was in high school, so he has already
reached that stage of proficiency. This was the fourth year
that squash was played at Pitt and despite many losses, it
continues to grow in popularity.
  Coach Tully was dismayed by this year's record, but he
was proud of Mason's showing. Last year Tully predicted
that Mason, then on the freshman squash team, would shoot
to the head of the team this year. Last year Mason was a
finalist in the National Junior Squash Tournament, and this
year competed in the Inter-collegiate Tournament at New
Haven. He has won almost every squash title in the city of
Pittsburgh and is probably one of the best young players in
the nation. It is fortunate for Pitt that Mason's father was
also a star at squash, or else Dave might never have taken up
the sport and gone on to become the Panther's big gun.

THE PROPER STANCE, here being taught to Don Lavely by Coach Ben
Pope, is one of the many fundamentals a beginner must learn. Then only by
constant practice can he become a star, for squash depends on skill rather
than size or strength.

and angry with himself, he slams his racket against the wall. Such is the very
personal game of squash; there are no teammates to blame for a loss.

Greek Week events aid in brotherhood
A FEW COMMENTS are addressed to the Greeks during their Luncheon by Dr.
Charles Peake, Vice-Chancellor in charge of Student Affairs. The All-Greek Luncheon, held in the new Student Union Ballroom, was added to this year's Greek Week
Program for the first time, and proved to be a very successful event.
  For one week, March 3 to 8, the fraternity and sorority ele  ment held sway as festivity, competition and general feelings
  of brotherhood marked the sixth annual Greek Week cele  bration.
    The week officially began with the regular meetings on
  Monday night. The various fraternities and sororities held
  discussions on the upcoming week, and made plans for par  ticipation.
    On Tuesday, Greeks attended the noon time chapel service,
  and later in the afternoon, took part in the leadership work  shops. These sessions were held for the benefits of Greek
  chapter officers and potential officers.
    Fraternity, faculty and alumni advisors met on Wednesday
  for dinner at the Student Union, and informally discussed the
  role of the fraternity and its future position at Pitt.
    Sororities and fraternities joined together on Thursday to
  sponsor exchange dinners. Following the meal, the groups,
  along with guests from the administration and faculty, con  ducted fireside discussions on the effects of belonging to a
  fraternal organization on a student's education.
    Greek Sing, held on Friday evening, was attended by over
  700 Greeks and non-Greeks alike. Following the Sing, an
  open reception and dance was held in the Student Union Ball  room.
    The week's festivities were capped off Saturday with the
  All Greek Luncheon, and the All Greek Dance, dubbed the
  "Odessey Ball", in the evening.
GREEK WEEK'58 saw the fraternity and sorority people at Pitt allied together
as a strong unit. They mixed socially, attended speeches, dined, and danced together. The whole week's events demonstrated the spirit and strength of the Greeks
on campus.
QUEEN ATHENA was crowned at the Greek Week
Ball, climaxing the week's events. Ann Pongratz, Delta
Tau Delta's candidate, was chosen Queen. She was
crowned by her escort, Herman Joy.
150
THE SING CONTEST, a favorite part of Greek Week, always demonstrates the competitive spirit of the Greeks. This year the first place winner
among the fraternities was Sigma Chi, who did the "Hanover Winter Song,"
complete with scarfs, ice skates, and skis.
                  SOCIALIZING before the Greek Sing, the singers and guests crowded
                  the Student Union Lounges. The competition between the groups was as
                  close as always, but all the groups, winners and losers alike, entertained
                  the audience with really fine singing.
SECOND PLACE in fraternity competition was won by Phi Gamma Delta, who
sang "Daddy Was a Yale Man." Bob Gibb accepted his fraternity's trophy from
Dr. Alan Rankin, Executive Secretary to the Chancellor. Third place award among
fraternities went to Delta Sigma Phi for their rendition of "Sweet Kentucky Babe."
"GOOD NEWS" was the offering of Alpha Epsilon Phi Sorority
and it was good enough to take third place. An overjoyed Lee
Gordon received the award for her sorority. Second place went to
Alpha Kappa Alpha, who sang the Cornell Alma Mater, and first
place to Kappa Kappa Gamma for "Golden Days."
                  AFTER THE CROWNING, Queen Ann Pongratz and her escort,
                  Herman Joy, started off the Queen's Dance, followed by her court.
                  The Odessey Ball brought the frolicking Greek Week to a close for
                  another year.

THE FINAL EXAM, although the bane of the Pitt student, serves as a proving

examination period brings on memories of early semester resolutions which somehow never materialized.

CRAMMING is done in every possible place during finals week-the Commons Room, the Tuck Shop, the Student Union, and in the upper halls. So
many facts must be learned in so little time that it seems at times an almost
impossible job. But reserve strength is summoned and at least a little confidence is mustered by the day of the test.
FRENZIED WRITING is necessary for most essay-type finals. A spare pencil
or pen is a necessity, and a cigarette or stick of gum is supposed to act as a
calming agent.
CAPACITY FILLED LIBRARIES serve as meeting places for reading and re-reading, last
minute review, and note comparison. The libraries are a stopping off place, a sort of junction
between preparation and the final testing, in addition to their year-round role as study halls.

I~'IPERSONALITIES
HYSTERIA swept the Blue and Gold sections when it was announced that they had tied for the cup. Spirit had been high all weekend, and this was the excuse
to really break loose.
DEAN BIDDLE presented the Camp Cup to representatives of the Blue and Gold
sections. The two groups had piled up the same number of points, 83, in the varied contests and were proud to share the honor.
THE CAMP BREAKING ceremony brought a happy ending to
the weekend. After solemnly forming the friendship circle and
singing the Alma Mater, the campers executed a reversal of form
and hurled the counseling staff into the swimming pool.

Owlettes represent beauty on campus
It has long been the opinion of the OWL that there
is a great deal of beauty at Pitt that has never had
the opportunity to be spotlighted in any of the
campus queen contests. Some of these girls are
freshmen, who have not yet been discovered, while
others are upperclassmen who have either not received the publicity they deserve, or have been
overlooked entirely.
  In order to correct this oversight, the OWL created its Owlettes. It selects, from the student
body, a typical cross-section of the beauty found
at Pitt. Starting with three dozen of the prettiest
coeds it could locate, the OWL after hours of comparison, argument, and careful selection, narrowed
the field down to five; five of the prettiest girls at
Pitt. Of the five, one was crowned Miss Owlette,
and the other four became her court. Then finally
we were able to announce: The OWL proudly presents, for your enjoyment, Miss Owlette and her
court.
Miss Owlette for 1958 is Sally Williams, a 21 yearold senior from Edgewood. A journalism major,
Sally is a member of Heinz Chapel Choir and Delta Zeta sorority, and spends her spare time following the Pirates.
  The only upperclassman in Miss Owlette's
Court is Pat Mack, a 20 year-old junior. Pat,
whose home is in Tarentum, is a member of
W. R. A. and Sigma Sigma Sigma sorority.
  Donna Smith of McKeesport is a freshman in
business education. This 18 year-old beauty spends
her spare time painting and playing the piano.
  A perfume bottle collection is one of freshman
Nancy Noethling's hobbies. An English Literature
major from Glenshaw, Nancy is also 18.
  Home-grown Sharon Miller, an Oakland product, is an 18 year-old business education freshman.
She does modelling work on the side, and is a
member of the freshman dramatic guild.

As a senior class prepares for graduation, it pauses for a
moment in the hectic scramble of its final semester to survey
itself and its accomplishments. Within it is a complete crosssection of the University student body; scholars and socialites, activities men and athletes. But standing a little above
the rest are those few of recognized leadership and ability to
whom the entire University extends its admiration. The
OWL feels that it is only fitting and proper that these leaders
be officially recognized and cited for their contributions. For
this reason, it selects, from the graduating class, a man and a
woman to be so honored. In the estimation of the OWL,
these two students typify the ideals that a student may
develop who finds a keen interest in working for his school
and with his fellow classmates. This year, the OWL has
singled out Jim Marino and Betty Chiappetta.
  Marino, the editor of the Pitt News, was known for his
pointed, often controversial, but always thought-provoking
editorials. He was also a class officer, a Men's Council representative, a member of Pi Delta Epsilon, the honorary
journalism fraternity, and a major in the Air Force ROTC.
  Miss Chiappetta served actively on Senior Court, Student
Congress, Associated Women Students, and as a Senior
Mentor. She was also tapped to Mortar Board, the senior
women's honorary, and was selected as the woman Senior
Worthy.
  Through their abilities, interests, and developments, these
two have proven themselves worthy of the titles-Mr. and

Registration frays nerves, tires feet, flattens
LINES that criss-crossed the floor of registration spelled boredom and frustration to the impatient students. It seemed that each line
was longer than the last, and there was always someone, two or three places ahead, who caused a tie-up.
MEADE BEERS AND REGISTRAR E. A.
BATCHELDER were kept busy throughout registration, as they attempted to hold the confusion
to a minimum.
AT WRITING TABLES, schedules are copied and re-copied, forms are filled out,
cards are signed, and pens have a habit of running dry. Then, and only then,
are the scratchy, postoffice type pens, provided at each table used.

                             Omicron Delta Kappa AwardeeEach year, the Pitt Gamma Circle of Omicron Delta Kappa
selects one man who has best exibited, through high scholarship, sound leadership, good character, and unselfish service,
the high ideals of the organization. For 1958, the awardee is
Robert M. Muzik.
  Mr. Muzik served as editor of the Skyscraper Engineer,
vice-president of the Engineering and Mines Cabinet, and
president of ODK. He has also been tapped to honoraries in
the fields of engineering (Sigma. Tau, Eta Kappa Nu),
journalism (Pi Delta Epsilon), and high, scholarship (Phi
Eta Sigma). He was further honored by his fellow engineers
and the engineering faculty, by being named Outstanding
Senior Engineer for 1958.
  Selection of the Man of the Year is a careful, exacting process. A number of outstanding senior men first nominate up
to 20 of their classmates, and out of this 20, vote for their
choice of five. These nominations and votes are passed on to a
committee of faculty, administrative, and alumni representatives, who make the final decision.
  As a lasting recognition of the honor bestowed upon him,
Mr. Muzik's name will be inscribed on ODK Walk, leading
from the Cathedral to Heinz Chapel.
  But the reciept of this award means far more than an inscription in stone. It signifies the recognition of the qualities
of excellence that have made him representative of the "type
of individual the University aims to produce."

   Just as Freshman Camp was a student's first impression of
   the recreational side of college life, registration, that most
   necessary of evils, introduced him to the red tape and frus   tration that was just as much a part of that life. Confused
   upperclassmen and hopelessly bewildered freshmen wander   ed about, attempting to find their way through the maze of
   arrows and numbers.
     Harassed faculty members, stoically retaining their com   posure, attempted to iron out the countless problems con   nected with a large-scale undertaking of this nature. Stu   dents strode into the sectioning division with grim deter   mination on their faces, and the fortunate ones soon emerged
   with various colored IBM cards clutched in their hands. At
   the crowded writing tables, simply covered with brown wrap   ping paper, others copied and recopied tentative schedules,
   wondering how many changes would be made in it before
   they were finished.
     Appallingly long lines stretched back from the deferred
   payment tables and the treasurers' cages, while checkers
   choked off the final sigh of relief by asking about "the pink
   card" that seemed to have disappeared somewhere between
   the Mosque and the cafeteria.
     But despite all of those ulcer-provoking incidents, the stu   dent was still able to grin, at least on the outside, at his mis   fortunes. At last there weren't any more long lines to stand
   in.
     And then he found out about the bookstore.
EVERY AVAILABLE INCH of space was put to use by harried
students, filling out cards, planning schedules, figuring out how to
pay the tuition.
A MOMENT OF RELAXATION was available after completing the first half of
registration in the Mosque. But then, when the cigarette burned down and nerves
finally calmed, it was time to go through the same thing again at the payment
section in the cafeteria.

AN EARLY-RISING ROOMMATE makes a more efficient alarm clock than any Big Ben or clockradio; she's louder, and it's impossible to turn her off.
ONLY A COUPLE OF MINUTES away from school, residents enjoy the convenience of unhurried showering and dressing in the
morning. Those with a little more ambition can even eat breakfast
-a luxury unknown to most commuters.
WHEN ILLNESS HITS the resident student, the University health service and sympathetic roommates are right at
hand to help out.

SENIORS experience their final contact with Pitt at
Commencement. Its pomp and ceremony create an impressive and symbolic contrast to the lighthearted casualness that pervades a student's collegiate life. For now
the senior ceases to be a recipient; it is his turn to contribute to our culture.

become important part of Pitt's student life
                                                               This year, for the first time in its history, Pitt took a step in
                                                               ridding itself of the title "street-car school." With the open                                                               ing of the Schenley and Brackenridge Houses, spacious, mod                                                               ern facilities were made available to a large number of resi                                                               dent students. The two new dorms, added to the older fa                                                               cilities of the Varsity House, fraternity and sorority houses,
                                                               and private boarding houses, now give Pitt more resident

                                                                 The sight of more and more students walking around, eat                                                              ing and just loafing in Oakland gives this area more of the

                                                              beginning, and the best is yet to come, for as the Schenley
                                                              Apartments are renovated one-by-one, they will be placed
                                                              in use as dorms, and Pitt will continue to grow as a campus
                                                              school.
                                                                The commuting students feel that their resident cousins
                                                              are very fortunate in being able to live on campus, for they
                                                              are not bothered by getting up before dawn to make first

                                                              are right in the middle of everything that happens on campus
                                                              and can join in on all of the student activities.
                                                                Pitt probably will never see the day when the majority of
                                                              its students live on campus, but if these noteworthy improve                                                              ments and additions are continued, the day will come when
                                                              a closer balance between the resident and the commuter stu                                                              dents will be reached and Pitt will deserve the unique title of
                                                              "city-campus school."
LIVING ON CAMPUS, the resident is able to avoid the           READING MATERIAL, for the student with time to do outside reading, is available
last minute rush to class; often is the first one to eight o'clock  at the Schenley Hall magazine stand. Unfortunately, he must go elsewhere for his

ORGANIZATIONS
As the importance of the role of the Air Force becomes
clearer and clearer each year, so the need for qualified officers
becomes more strongly felt. To fill this need, the Air Force
Reserve Officer Training Corps, strives to produce men possessing leadership, individual thought, and honor; in short,
all the qualities necessary in an officer.
  To achieve this purpose, the AFROTC not only trains the

The aim of Alpha Beta Gamma, the professional sorority
for elementary education majors, is to promote cooperation
and friendship between students and faculty members. This
group also aims to stimulate interest in higher professional
standards for teachers in the field of elementary education.
  Founded at Pitt, in 1939, this local sorority has many
worthwhile projects throughout the year. Outstanding speakers in the field of education are invited to speak at the meetings, panel discussions are held, and field trips are made
under the direction of their advisors.
A drive to raise money for crippled children and a work
session at Leech Farm were only two of Alpha Delta Pi's
many activities.
  On the social side, they held teas for the parents and for
alumni, sponsored a benefit bridge party, honored their
founders with a Founder's Day Dinner, and topped off the
season with a Black and White Formal. Tea dances improved
sorority-fraternity relations, while parties strengthened the
feeling of sisterhood in the sorority.
  Two active sisters of ADPi are Lois Hamilton, the vice
president of Panhel, and Mary Johnson, star of many Pitt
Player's productions.

Alpha Epsilon Delta, honorary pre-medical fraternity, encourages excellence in
pre-medical scholarship. It stimulates an
appreciation of the importance of undergraduate education in the study of medicine, and attempts to bring together students with common interests.
  To be eligible for membership, a student must have completed at least three
semesters of pre-medical work with a
2.0 overall quality point average.
  Throughout the school year, the AEDs
sponsored movies, speakers, and forums
to aid the pre-med student in preparing
for the problems that would confront him
in medical school.

  On the local level, they sponsored a Korean war orphan,
and their pledges put in a number of work sessions at the
Pennsylvania School for the Blind.
  A number of AEPhis are quite active in campus organizations. Among them are Harriet Gordon, president of Panhellenic Council; and Eileen Slotsky, section editor of the

Although Alpha Phi Delta came back on campus just four
years ago, in that short time it has risen to become one of
Pitt's most active social fraternities. Proof of this is the fact
that it received a plaque from its national chapter for being
the most improved chapter in its district.
   Creating proper attitudes toward self-respect and the
rights of others, and fostering and developing the highest
traits of man are the aims of the fraternity. To help accomplish them, they sponsor an annual Fall Formal, a Christmas
Party, and an Alumni Dinner, the latter to help raise money
for their building fund.

STUDYING is as much a chore for the resident as for
the commuter, but he has the advantage of not
having to put up with the interruptions that plague the
commuter at home.
UNDER THE CLOCK near the student desk is a popular meeting place for Pitt
students. Here two residents plan their evening's entertainment.
THE PAY PHONE is quite an annoyance for the new resident, accustomed to
leisurely conversations on the phone at home. But at the rate of three-and-a-half
cents a minute, he learns to be brief, except when talking to his girl. Then the extra
expense is worth it.
ENTERTAINMENT facilities of almost every nature are within
walking distance of the resident. In addition to being the cultural
center of Pittsburgh, the Oakland area has become, in essence, a
college town, catering to the students of three colleges.

Since its establishment at Pitt in 1918, the Army Reserve Officers Training Corps has played a vital role in the lives of Pitt
men. Because ROTC is the greatest source of Regular Army
officers, it is necessary to produce men who have the qualities
and attributes essential to their success as officers. At Pitt,
where the General Military Science curriculum is taught, cadets are prepared for positions of command and aided in the
development of the key trait an officer must have, leadership.
They are instructed in subjects common to all branches of
the Army, from the Ml to map reading, and through social

body.
  The work of the organization is fourfold: to develop a general policy statement to give direction to the total program of religion on campus, to propose a
plan for religious structure and organization, to prepare recommendations for a
program of religious fellowship and activities, and to submit recommendations
for religion in the curriculum.

understanding of the faith and practice of the Episcopal
church among the students at Pitt.

                                                CROSS COUNTRY
Piling up a big score in cross country is a
feat that coaches dread, for in this sport,
like golf, the low score wins.
  Panther Coach Carl Olsen's squads are
quite adept at holding the score down,
though, and proof of this is their impressive record in meets, year after year,
against some of the toughest opponents
in the nation.
  Local meets are begun and finished at
Flagstaff Hill, with the five mile course
winding through Schenley Park. Judges
bounce along the route in a jeep, checking
the runners, while assistant coaches stand
at check points with stop watches, timing
the thinclads against one another.

Delta Delta Lambda, an honorary business education fraternity, was organized in recognition of Dr. D. D. Lessenberry. Business education majors maintaining a 1.8 Q.P.A.
are eligible for membership.
  The threefold aim of the organization is: to encourage and
recognize scholarship in the field of commercial education;
to provide a medium through which business problems can
be discussed; and to introduce outstanding leaders in the
field of commercial education to University students.
  Initiation dinners and a picnic at the end of the year are
the social highlights of the year.
   DELTA SIGMA DELTA
 Dating back to 1882, Delta Sigma Delta has
 the distinction of being the only international
 professional dentistry fraternity.
   By promoting, in the minds of dental stu dents and practitioners, a spirit of fraternal
 cooperation toward scientific, ethical, and pro fessional progress, the group strives to. raise
 the already high standards of dentistry.
   A Christmas and Spring Formal, a party
 every two weeks, and other functions through out the year make up the Delta Sigma Delta
 social chart, and through them the members
 are able to not only find relief from the concen trated study of dental school, but become pro ficient in the social graces necessary in any
 profession.

Every year adds new laurels to the Delta Sigs, for they refuse

There are few sports or contests in which the Delta Sigs have
not recently taken honors.
  Aside from being competitors, the brothers are also traditionally activities men around campus, and many Delta
Sigs are to be found in all walks of University life. John L.
Sullivan, head football, manager; Chris Gillotti, literary
editor of the Owl; and Swede Jansson, senior class fifth man,
are some of the outstanding brothers.

Amazingly enough, the Delta Zetas did not come out first
in sorority scholarship this year. After three consecutive
years of being the social sorority with the highest Q.P.A., the
DZs broke what was starting to become a tradition. This
year they took second place.
  Not only are the DZs always top in scholarship, they are
always right up there competing with the other Greeks, and
are well represented in campus activities. Marcia Getting,

of one member from each department and one from each class.
  In addition to its administrative functions, the Cabinet
aims to provide a social program for the Engineers, present
awards to deserving groups and students, and promote departmental competition.
  Such projects as Engineers' week, the EMITT program,
a lounge in Engineering Hall, and the Outstanding Senior
Award, combined with dances, banquets, and luncheon meetings, are all sponsored by the E and M Cabinet as the means
to achieve this goal.
To reward high scholarship, and to improve the standards of
the profession, the courses of instruction, and the institutions
where its chapters are located are the specific aims of Eta
Kappa Nu Association, the electrical engineering honorary

  This organization was founded in 1904 at the University
of Illinois. The Beta Delta Chapter at Pitt was chartered
in 1937.
  Eta Kappa Nu accepts for membership a junior electrical

Ever since the initial season of 1890 when the Panthers beat
Geneva, 10-4, Pitt has been noted as a football powerhouse.
There were off and on periods during the long history of
football at Pitt, but there were also many outstanding years
and records.
   Pitt's record 33 game winning streak from 1914 to 1919
stood until surpassed last year by Oklahoma. The legendary
Jock Sutherland coached Pitt to seven Eastern championships during his 15 year regime, and directed Pitt teams to
the Rose Bowl four times.
  Recently the Panthers, under Coach John Micheloson,
have won bids to the Sugar and Gator Bowls.

Serving for two decades, the Heinz Chapel Choir has become
an integral part of all University Chapel services. The Choir
has a threefold aim: to provide choral music for all University Heinz Chapel services, to provide the membership with
comradeship and spiritual uplift through its musical and
social functions, and to bring about a mature appreciation
of religious music..
  The choir is on hand to lend an impressive note to University functions, as it did at the Chancellor's convocation.
  On the social side, the Choir holds an annual banquet,
and each spring is feted at a party given by Mrs. Vira Heinz.
Hillel is a religious and cultural organization sponsored by
B'nai B'rith with over five hundred foundations and fellowships in four countries. The organization itself is primarily
intended to provide members of the Jewish faith an opportunity to share a common fellowship, and conduct their own
religious services and cultural affairs.
  Jewish religious services, as well as various cultural programs, are held weekly at the Y.M. &amp; Y.W.H.A. High on
the list of social affairs are the annual interfaith Chanukah
program, annual "Campus Capers," and the Purim Dance.

HILLEL FOUNDATION
IDAKA
IDAKA
Idaka, a pre-nursing sorority, was organized in 1942 in order to promote friendship among students interested in nursing,
and to acquaint students with the basic
professional nursing program of the University of Pittsburgh.
   Membership in Idaka is limited to
those in pre-nursing having a minimum
of fourteen credits and with at least a 1.0
Q.P.A.
   The Idaka social program includes such
affairs as an open house for freshmen prenursing students, and a Ribbon tea. The
group also attempts to better acquaint its
members with     the  nursing  profession
through   interviews  with   outstanding
women in their field.

  A national group, open to any student in aeronautical
engineering, I.A.S. has a three point program; to facilitate
the interchange of technical ideas, to promote fellowship and
advancement of aeronautical engineering students, and to
stimulate interest in aeronautical engineering among the student body in general.
  In conjunction with the International Geophysical Year
activities, I.A.S. took an active part in the American Rocket

Interfraternity Council is the co-ordinating body for the Pitt
social fraternities. All fraternities are represented and the
group tries to establish a unity of spirit and action among the
Greeks on campus. It also promotes the general welfare of
the student body and the University as a whole.
  Some of their projects are the S-Award, which allows an
outstanding junior man to study in Europe for one summer;
fund raising drives for charity; and the collection of canned
goods for underprivileged families. Social affairs sponsored
by IF were the Interfraternity Ball, Greek Week, and a jazz
concert. A full program of interfraternity sports provided
high spirited competition between the Greeks.
Previously a somewhat haphazardly produced journal, Jet
Blast, the Air Force ROTC newspaper, this year embarked
on a program of expansion and improvement, and is now
recognized officially as a University publication. More pages
were added, new columns were introduced, pictures were
improved, and a monthly printing schedule was maintained.
  A good deal of the credit should go to editor John Johnston,
who along with his staff, rescued Jet Blast from near failure
and turned it into an important asset to the Air Force department. In addition to publishing Jet Blast, the staff organized
an Air Force Glee Club and co-sponsored a Christmas party.

Because Pitt does not have a definite prelegal organization or curriculum, John
Marshall Society has an important job to
accomplish. Open to any student with a
2.0 Q.P.A. and a sincere interest in law,
this pre-legal honorary attempts to answer the problems of undergraduates who
plan to study law, and establish a bond
between the membership, its alumni, and
the faculty of Pitt's Law School.
  One of the means by which these goals
are achieved is dinner meetings featuring
a prominent speaker who talks to members on some topic of interest to legal and
pre-legal students. Members also take
part in law school mock trials.

Positive proof that the local chapter of the Kappa Psi Pharmaceutical Fraternity is successful is the fact that it led all
the other chapters of Kappa Psi in new members during the
last year.
  To its membership, Kappa Psi offers not only fellowship
and brotherhood, but also an opportunity to aid in the betterment of the pharmaceutical profession.
  Some of the recent projects of the group include an educational display for National Pharmacy Week, and a
Christmas collection for the poor, while smokers, the annual
homecoming events, and a spring formal dinner-dance make
up the social side.
The nation's largest social fraternity in number of chapters,
152, Lambda Chi Alpha is upholding a proud tradition at
Pitt.
  The goals of Lambda Chi Alpha are to develop the wellrounded person, to encourage fraternal feeling and cooperation, to establish highest ideals of character, to develop
higher qualities of mind, and to provide a good home for its
members. To help accomplish these aims, the fraternity conducts a wide social program, headed by a White Rose DinnerDance, a Christmas Formal, a Halloween party, a swimming
party, and numerous tea dances. Through these events, the
brothers get to know one another better.

EXPERIENCE IS GAINED by advanced students at the modern, well-equipped clinic, located

PHI SIGMA SIGMA
The members of Phi Sigma Sigma sorority had a busy year in 1957. A bowling
party, the Brides' Tea to honor recent
brides in the chapter, Founders Day and
the December Formal are a few of the
highlights on the social calendar. Other
projects included plans to raise money
for the Rheumatic Fever Drive and for
the National Children's Cardiac Home,
and a rummage sale. A few of the active
Phi Sigs were Marilyn Maipels and Rheda
Meyers, who toured with Pitt Players;
Rochelle Weiss, who was chairman of the
Panhellenic Open House, and Sandra Wesoky and Charlotte Lichter, who trained
for a week before school started to become
Senior Mentors.

Since 1920, when the Alpha Mu local sorority became the
Beta Theta chapter of Phi Mu national, sisters of Phi Mu
have worked toward the goals of co-operation with the University in promoting high scholarship and cultural standards,
and development of sisterhood and friendship.
  One of the most noteworthy of the many Phi Mu projects
is the Orphans Party they hold each Easter. From 15 to 20
children from a district home are entertained, and the sisters
always seem to have as much fun as the kids.
  Tea dances, parties, and a Winter formal make the Phi Mu
social calendar, and help bind the sisters closer together.

Much of the activity which consumed the time of the members of the Pi Kappa Alpha social fraternity was the buying
and the installation of new furniture and the redecoration of
their fraternity apartment, but they still found time to join
with Kappa Alpha Theta Sorority to build the second place
float for Homecoming, "Teahouse of the August Moon."
  The Pikas are hard workers, especially in I.F. There they

at Pitt. It is a local organization, founded
in 1954 by the University Chaplain,
Emory Luccock, and a few pre-theological
students who felt the need for such a
group.
  Pi Theta's purpose is to foster an appreciation and understanding of common
goals and aspirations of all religions, and
to promote a God-centered fellowship.
During the year top men in the field of
religion and related areas speak to the
organization on all aspects of religion.
  Any undergraduate student who is preparing for the ministry, priesthood, or
rabbinate is eligible for membership in
Pi Theta.

Organized in 1946 as a mimeographed newspaper, the Pitt
Capsule has developed into a magazine of high calibre, and
represents well the ideas, activities, and purpose of the Pitt
Pharmacy School. Although it is aimed primarily at the
undergraduate students, it also serves as an essential bond
between the School, its alumni, and the outside world of
pharmacy.
  Despite the fact that the majority of the staff is hampered
by lack of extensive experience in journalism, they manage
to produce a professional looking publication, with a unique
format and a consistently good editorial policy.

PITT NEWS
The PITT NEWS of 1957-58 achieved fame by being quoted
more times in the Pittsburgh dailies than any previous year's
publication. In the midst of the streetcar strike, editor Jim
Marino blasted city officials for failure to provide adequate
parking space for commuters, especially those at Pitt, and his
editorial was quoted and requoted.
  When the controversial trimester plan was first suggested,
the local papers eagerly reprinted the NEW'S view on the
subject.
  Even such sports features as use of the stadium by the
Steelers and lack of student support found their way into the
pages of the metropolitan papers; a fine tribute to one of
"America's great student newspapers."
PITT PLAYERS
Dramatic interest on campus is furthered
by Pitt Players, the oldest dramatic organization  in  Pittsburgh. Since  1926,
players has presented four major productions each year and actively supported
any other dramatic functions at Pitt.
  Upon completion of crew jobs or one
crew job and two acting jobs during the
school year, a student officially becomes
a member in good standing.
  Each spring, following the close of the
final play of the season, a banquet is held
at which time Pitt Players Acting and
Technical Awards are presented to outstanding students. Throughout the year,
informal parties and get-togethers provide a social program for the Players.

together with a schedule of events and a handy memo calendar.
  It is distributed, free of cost, to all students at the beginning of the school year, and serves as a guide for both semesters.
  Polaris is of particular value to new students who know
little or nothing about the workings of the University, but it
is an invaluable aid to any student. With its aid, the vastness

by the American Baptist Convention.
  This Fellowship participates in many projects and social
affairs. International programs and week-end retreats are
held, while square dances, parties, and picnics are only a few
of the social affairs held annually.
  Specific aims of the fellowship are to encourage students
to grow to personal maturity in personal liberty, establish
the supremacy of individual conscience, strengthen the separation of church and state, and grant social justice for all
people.

Orientation projects
Aid frosh adjustment
The freshmen orientation program is centered around Men's
Conference and women's Senior Mentors. This program is
not only designed to help the new student over the countless
rough spots that invariably occur when entering a large and
complicated university like Pitt, but also to urge him to take
an active interest in his school by instructing him in the many
varied aspects of Pitt life.
   Freshman women are assigned to a small group headed by
a Senior Mentor who acts as a."big sister," solving any problems or questions the girls bring to her. She informs them of
Pitt's history and traditions, teaches them the victory songs
and cheers, and accompanies them to the first football game,
Panhellenic Reception, and Sorority Open House.
  In the Men's Conference Classes the frosh meet with an
upperclass counselor and an advisor from the Dean of Men's
office. Here they, too, learn about the University and its
workings, and here they bring out their problems and questions.
  For many of the freshmen, these orientation sessions are
the sole opportunity to talk with someone who is genuinely
interested in their problems, and the only chance to gain a
solid foundation of knowledge about their University. The
Freshmen must consider these sessions worthwhile, for attendance is surprisingly high.
STUDY HINTS, note taking, library procedure, fraternities, Pitt
traditions, and student government are all covered in the men's
conferences. Most frequently asked question: "Now about this
English theme I have to write..."

rushing procedure to a freshman student. She learns
she must wait one semester before accepting a bid.
BUYING BOOKS was just another step in the long orientation process, a step that had to be repeated every semester.

Although Sigma Chi was not the first national fraternity at
Pitt, it has the longest continuous residence at Pitt because
it was able to weather the depression and remain on campus.
This strength is still reflected in the chapter, for they number
among their members many men prominent in Pitt affairs.
Among them are Walt Sickles, photo editor of the OWL;
Randy Marlier, vice president of the Newman Club; Chet
Maruzewski, president of the Society for the Advancement
of Management, and Hal Kelley, Chief Justice of Men's
Court.
  The Sigs' social calendar includes such events as the Sweetheart Weekend, Miami Triad Dance, parties, and tea dances.

SIGMA DELTA TAU
                                     High scholarship is one of the goals of Sigma
                                     Delta Tau, as can be witnessed by the fact that
                                     they won the sorority scholarship award with
                                     overall 2.18 quality point average. But since
                                     their purpose is not only to stimulate devotion
                                     to duty, but to foster friendship, SDTs sponsor
                                     a broad social schedule. Besides an    annual

To promote scholastic, social, and organizational achievement is the specific aim of Sigma Phi Epsilon.
  The chapter at Pitt was reactivated only eight years ago,
but they have taken firm hold and are a rapidly growing and
progressive organization.
  The SPEs achieved one of their fullest seasons this year,
as they sponsored many tea dances, a Christmas Orphans
party, and a Muscular Dystrophy project.
  One of their affairs was a tri-state basketball tournament
held in March. Sigma Phi Epsilon ranks high scholastically,
and are usually ranked in the top five fraternities.

Sigma Sigma are justly proud of the trophy they won in cooperation with Delta Sigma Phi, in this year's annual Homecoming Float Parade. The Tri-Sigma's are also proud of
their members' individual honors, which include: Pat Mack,
Owlette, and Carol Parker and Genevieve Siconolfi, senior
mentors.
  Tri-Sigma's main goal is to establish a perpetual bond of
friendship. This they achieve through such social events as
tea-dances, and through their annual Christmas Orphan's
Party.

SKYSCRAPER ENGINEER
Expanded this year to six issues, The
Skyscraper Engineer made good use of
its two extra issues to better inform the
engineering student at Pitt of the opportunities that engineering offers, and at
the same time, further spread the knowledge of engineering activities at Pitt. The
Skyscraper, which is rated one of the top
five collegiate engineering magazines in
the nation, offers to engineering students
an excellent means of creative expression,
and furthers the standards of good magazine production.
  During the year, the magazine helps to
promote various engineering affairs, most
notably the annual Engineer's Week in
March.

Since achieving varsity status in 1955, soccer has been
one of the fastest growing and most successful sports at
Pitt. Starting with an eight and one record their first season,
the booters have established a place for themselves in the
soccer world, and today schedule games with none but the
best soccer teams in the country.
  Much of the credit for the phenomenal success of the team
must go to Coach Leo Bemis, through whose efforts the
team was formed. The Panther booters can include in their
ranks a two time All-American-Jerry Bressanelli. The senior
from Beadling is a standout on both offense and defense.
The Pitt chapter of the Society of Automotive Engineers, a
professional society, is a very active organization which provides a regular program of projects and affairs.
  The organization's main purpose is to further and enlarge
student interest in the automotive and related industries.
  Some of the groups more significant activities include a
summer placement service for students, an automobile rally,
participation in Engineer's Week, and a series of speakers and
movies on engineering.
  The annual social events held by the society are the Cider
and Donut Affair, and the Spring Picnic.

Evidence of the success of the local branch of the Society for

ranked third among the group's 111 national chapters.
  S.A.M. is open to any student who is taking a line of study
directed toward the administration of management of business. It seeks to help its members by giving them an opportunity to tour various plants, engage in seminars and round
table discussions, and meet with top executives in industry.
  An annual conference was held at the Penn Sheraton Hotel,
and the topic, "Preview of Pittsburgh's Bi-Centennial" was
discussed.
SQUASH
The Squash team, which has been at Pitt
for a number of years as a club and recently broke into the ranks of intercollegiate
competition, is now strong enough to
harass any team it comes up against.
The Squash men compete in two different
leagues, the City League, in which they
play squash teams and clubs from the
Pittsburgh area, and in the intercollegiate league.
   Coach Ben Pope states that the team
is hampered by the fact that it takes
about four years to    become a   good
squash player, so just as a man is becoming expert, he graduates. He hopes this
will be remedied by the Junior Development Program which trains boys to play
squash while still in high school.

The Student Chapel Board is comprised of members elected
to their positions by the religious fellowships they represent.
  Meetings, held on the first Monday of each month, provide
an opportunity for board members to plan Chapel services.
They also review other matters concerning the use of the
Chapel.
  The aim of the organization is to make Heinz Chapel and
the services held there a vital part of each student's life.
  The recently inaugurated free fifth hour provides an open
hour for students to participate in the services.
The voice of the student at Pitt probably echoes loudest in
the meeting of Student Congress, for it is the job of this body
to study the interests and needs of the student body, and follow their findings up with programs to foster good will and
constructive work.
  To achieve these aims, Congress, whose members are
elected by the entire student body, holds a meeting each
Monday. These meetings are open to anyone, and students
are urged to attend, if only to observe student government
in action.
  Such events as Spring Carnival, Homecoming, dances, pep
rallies, and the Asian book drive were only a few of Congress'
recent projects.

  Perennially hampered by the lack of
  their own pool, the Pitt swimmers must,
  by necessity, work twice as hard as their
  opponents. About the only advantage
  that the tankers might receive from the
  continual shuffling of their home pool is
  that they are prepared to perform in any
  type of pool they may encounter. Over  coming their difficulties, the Panther's
  crack 400 relay team set a new school
  record of 4:14.4 earlier this year. The re  lay quartet consisted of Willis Weisz,
  Chuck Nanz, Eugene Adams, and Ken
  Cooper.

A full schedule of parties and tea dances, highlighted by the
Carnation Dance and the Homecoming Alumni Dinner made
up the social side of the Theta Chi year, while an orphan's
Christmas party and participation in interfraternity events
contributed to the activities of the chapter.
  On campus Theta Chi is led by such men as Phil Parkinson, president of Student Congress; Denny Litchman, vice
president of I.F.; and Larry Cervi, head drum major.
  Good scholarship, promotion of school spirit, and education
through social activity are the objectives of Theta Chi, and
the local chapter has worked hard to fulfill them.
THETA PHI ALPHA
Theta Phi Alpha social sorority strives to
advance the interests of Catholic women
in religious, educational, and social areas.
The TPAs carry out their purpose by taking part in campus organizations, holding
an extensive social program, and being

  The TPAs held an Alumni-Active barbecue, the annual Cocktail and Dinner
party at the Holiday House, and two
formals. In the religious area they held
monthly   Communion    breakfasts, and
nationally supported the Glenmary Missions.

The specific purpose of the Wesley Fellowship is to develop
and strengthen the Christian faith and to prepare young
people for future leadership in the church.
  The Pittsburgh chapter is the local branch of the Methodist Student Movement and is made up of students of any
district college, or any others of that age group, who are
interested in taking part in the activities of the organization.
  Some of the group's social affairs were skating and swimming parties, picnics, hay rides, and even cave exploring. As
in past years the members of this Fellowship also participated in many fund raising drives.

AROUND THE CONFERENCE TABLE, the frosh's questions were thrashed out. It is often encouraging for a confused freshman to discover that most of his
classmates are just as bewildered as he.
ADVICE FROM SENIOR MENTORS helps freshman women to adjust to the complexity of college life. Often mentors and their girls develop, from these sessions,
lasting friendships.

   one of the top college wrestling teams in the country. Pitt's
   wrestlers have continually finished with very fine records,
   and Coach Peery has turned out six national champions:
   Hugh Peery, Ed Peery, Joe Solomon, Ed DeWitt, Tom
   Alberts, and Ron Schirf.
     Six lettermen who returned this year to grapple for the
  Blue and Gold were Tom Alberts, Dave Johnson, Vic
  DeFelice, Ted Bienkowski, Bob Richardson, and Bob Bubb.
     The Panthers had a rugged schedule, with five of their

A "hybrid" of campus organization, community service aid, and religious group,
the YMCA aims at applying Christian
ideals to everyday application on the
campus.
   Such services as the placement bureau,
 and a student handbook, forerunner of
 the Polaris, were originally Y projects.
 This year YMCA was co-sponsor of the
 freshman camp, and sponsored the Uni versity International Dinner, U. N. Week
 observance, and studentfaculty discus sion of groups in faculty members' homes.
   Social activities include the annual mid semester conference at Deer Valley and
 dinner forums at the Student Union.

Zeta Tau Alpha has a proud tradition at Pitt, for it was the
first national sorority on campus, coming here in 1915. Since
then it has continually strived to promote internal friendship
within the group, and to aid the growth of the individual
member.
  Two formals, one at Christmas and one in the Spring,
headline the ZTA social program. Besides tea dances and
parties throughout the year, an Orphan's Party, a Christmas
party for the mothers, and an October Founder's Day banquet are also enjoyed by the sisters.
  Nancy Hall, treasurer of Panhellenic, and Rita Olesnevich,
vice-president of W.R.A., are only two of the many ZTAs
prominent at Pitt.

       In the very beginning, when Pittsburgh was only a cluster of cabins at the
Point, two dreams stirred its soul-a splendid, surging materialism, and a yearning
for cultural growth. That these two have achieved a happy symbiosis is brilliantly
expressed today in the Cathedral of Learning.
       * It could have been a temptation, in this town of teeming potentialities,
to concentrate solely on the practical. Wealth always burgeoned here-in farm
products, coal, iron, glass, oil, and steel. Any man with horse-sense and a right
good will to work, could wrest a fortune from the wilderness, seemingly overnight.
       * This city was singularly blessed though, by the quality of the people who
came here in search of a fuller life. They recognized early a need for the specialized
type of training our industries would require. But they wished, for their sons and
daughters, much more than this. With William Penn they believed that "good
and commendable learning is to be preferred before wealth."
       * A succession of such great men-founders, trustees, chancellors, teachers,
and alumni-have steered our university's destiny from the log cabin Academy
of 1787 to the Cathedral of today. Under their vigil has grown up a special type of
university that marries, in its wide curriculum, both the cultural and the practical.
The Cathedral of Learning, itself a uniquely American architectural expression,
is a symbol of a uniquely American type of education.
       * Also uniquely American was the early development of the food manufacturing business. For more than three generations we have been preparing
ready-to-serve delicacies to save the time and effort of America's housewives.

HARBISON-WALKER REFRACTORIES
        keep pace with the atomic age
Refractories are needed for building the many
widely diversified types of furnaces used for
making steel, aluminum, copper, and other
metals, cement, glass, steam-generated power
and substantially all products vital to our
modern civilization and our national economy.
  The high temperatures and other severe
operating conditions which refractories must
withstand in service differ greatly among the
various industrial processes. Through research
and extensive application experience, HarbisonWalker has developed the kinds of refractories
best suited for each specific requirement. From
a mere dozen kinds of refractories made available to industry a half century ago, HarbisonWalker now produces more than four score
commercial types and classes. The proper
selection of these refractories for every particular application assures longest service life
and greatest operating economy.

          It pays to be at th
The many services that a bank performs require the
talents of a surprising variety of personnel, aside from
those with the obviously logical background of financial
training. Your education may very well be the perfect
background for one of the more than 20 well-paying
positions in a bank.
  One of every five and a half banking employees is an
officer. A greater portion of graduates who pursue a
banking career attain the $7500 to $10,000 per year
bracket than those in any other business. These statistics
apply in many cases to both men and women in banking,
since 10% of banking officials are women.
                     Management
Scenter of things
   Banking is out ahead of most other fields in the
 important matter of fringe benefits. The average bank
 employee receives an additional $24 in fringe benefits for
 every $100 in salary.
   A career in banking offers the opportunity to further
 your education if you so desire. Many banks offer free
 courses in money, credit, banking, economics, and other
 allied subjects.
   Banking is a profession of prestige and respect. Few
 fields offer the college graduate such opportunities. Look
 ahead, weighing your talents and ambitions, and then
 answer this question:
What about a banking career... for you?

INFORMALITY, too, was a key factor in orientation. The frosh felt comfortable, felt that their counselors were
more friend than teacher.
THOSE FEW QUIET MOMENTS TOGETHER, squeezed into a hectic
schedule, help immeasurably in the orientation process.
AT THE FRESHMAN BANQUET, the freshman class ate together,
laughed and kidded, and got to know one another. And with their
new friends they looked forward confidently to the next four years.

                                                                      Parking spaces near the Cathedral are almost nonexistent for
                                                                      all but the earliest arrivals, and it is not uncommon to see
                                                                      these hardy individuals sprawled out in their cars, catching

                                                                        Commuter students are roughly broken down into two
                                                                      types: the commuter who takes an active part in extra                                                                      curricular affairs, and the type who remains in school only
                                                                      long enough to attend all of his classes. Of the latter, the ma                                                                      jority usually are those forced to carry outside jobs, and al                                                                      though unable to participate to a large degree in activities,
                                                                      Sthey are nevertheless an integral part of the University. For

                                                                      to achieve it.
ARISING AT DAWN is a necessity for many of the commuter
students with 8:00 classes. The discouraging prospect of spending
the next hour travelling instead of sleeping makes it doubly hard
to start the day off right.
      PARKING SPACES near the Cathedral are at a premium in the morning. Those with the
      money and without the time or energy to search, make use of the many parking lots in the
      vicinity.
                                                                                          A SOFT BED can be enjoyed just as much by a com                                                                                          muter as by a resident-but not for as long. About the

plague commuter
   TRAFFIC TIE-UPS are a familiar part of the commuter's morning;
   and even with Rege Cordic on the radio, it is easy to be in a bad
   mood when finally getting to school.
THE STREET-CAR-BORNE students are saved the agony of searching
for a parking place, but must submit to the jostling annoyance of her fellow rush hour passengers.
AN EXTENSIVE HOME LIBRARY is one advantage the commuter
may have over the resident. Besides having the books right at
home, she is not at the mercy of the library clerks.
PAPER BAG LUNCHES, marks of the commuters, can be supplemented by beverages at the Hunt and Pine Rooms, Tuck Shops, or
cafeteria. Though quite a bit cheaper than going out for lunch,
eating out of a bag does have a tendency to become monotonous.

                         As I sit here trying to put into
                         flowery phrases the respect, ad                         miration, and pride I have felt
                         for this staff, and reminiscing
                         about the fun and hard work in
                         which they have played a major
                         part, I find it difficult to put
                         down my true feelings about the
                         year. It seems like a big jumble of
                         deadlines, trips, parties, and wor                         rying.  The   whole  adventure
                         seems a little hazy now that it's
                         all'over, but the high points still
stand out clearly. I remember the nights spent in the office
laboring over deadlines that we all thought would never be
done on time, but always were. LOIS, our faithful Associate
Editor, was always on hand at these times, sleepily refusing
to get some rest, staying until the final word was typed and
the shipment sent out. CHRIS and RON also worked long
hours and kept the spirits of the rest of the staff up with
their jokes and routines, while doing a commendable job on
one of the most thankless jobs on the book-writing the
copy. WALT'S photo-editing consisted mainly of riding
herd on one of the largest crops of camera-carriers the OWL
had ever seen. LUCILLE, in her fourth year on the staff,
Smith Gillotti Valli m
Smith             Gillotti            Valli
did her usual fine job in handling the senior section, and did
her best to run a date bureau for the unfortunate men on the
staff. Even though DARIN'S father was the "Great White
Father"- the Dean of the College, and she threatened us all
with expulsion, she was one of the best-liked members of the
staff, and surely one of the most dependable. Even when
ROCCO'S stories were long and involved, they provided a
good way to pass an afternoon, and when he wasn't telling
about the latest happenings in Wexford, he was turning out
pictures that are a credit to the book. LEE and ARLENE
handled the most tedious job of all-the typing, and with           Hawx and Howie
find the right balance between work and fun on the OWL.
Even though everything seemed to be against her at times,
she managed to get her work done on time. TOM'S raucous
laughter made an otherwise quiet office come alive, but in
his serious moments, he provided the book with pictures of
Gosztonyi         Geise              Hoff
unexpectedly high quality. BARB, one of the many Chi O's
on the staff, was the speediest person on layouts the staff
had ever seen, yet never seemed to run out of things to do.
JACKIE and JO ANNE, another pair of Chi O's, were to be
seen just about everyday, flitting in and out of the office in
search of work to do. I could go on and fill another 308 page
book about these people, and still not have said enough. As
it is, space prohibits more than a mere mention of some of
our most loyal members. Such people as NANCY, DON,
ADAM, HANK, BILL, PAUL, and GERI were truly the
ones behind the scene pulling the strings. It strikes me as
remarkable that things turned out as well as they did, with
a group of people all striving to achieve something that
existed only in the mind of one person. Well, HOWIE,
we're both a couple of has-beens now, and the worst is over.
All we have to do now is to sit back and wait for the neophytes
to take over. New staffs will come and go, but there will never
he another year like 1958. I think we'll both remember for a
Tishon

out them, the book would still be in production. Although
TISH had her hands full with student teaching during the
first semester, she still found time to come up and spend the
deadline evenings with us. MONETTE was always on hand
through the day with her witty comments about life in
general and the staff in particular, and also found some time
to help with the typing and layouts. EILEEN seemed to
Viola             Rice
    long time the trips to Buffalo and New York City. ACP was
    just great, with the theatre and excellent food (and the girls
    from Detroit.) Then there were the parties in the office to
    celebrate the completion of another deadline, the small talk
    over a brew at Gustines, and the intellectual discussions at
    DOC'S place. Come to think of it, this has probably been
    my only opportunity to make mistakes and have someone
    else responsible to pay for them. To you, HOWIE, to the
    present crew, to next year's staff, and especially to DOC, my
    very sincerest thanks, and good luck!

acknowledge staff
As the semester draws to a close, I can finally put aside the
adding machine and turn to the typewriter to express my
sincere thanks to the business staff. Though we had a comparitively small staff, we were nevertheless able to have
another financially successful year. The competant assistance
of BOB helped to make my job a great deal easier. He tied
together all the loose ends that are bound to appear in any
financial situation as complex as the Owl's. For the missing
link on his gold keychain, he was awarded a long-sought key.
In the circulation department, WILL coaxed, cajoled, and
touch with the staff, and we
found that our jobs soon became less difficult. His sincere
concern for the business staff
helped to make matters more
smooth. I certainly could not
have had a better partner. DR.
SWARTS     has influenced   me
more than any other individual
in the past four years. In any
matter, whether personal or in
the realm of business, he has
always given that added boost.
His cherished friendship has truly meant a great deal to me.
With the approach of graduation, I can look back and vividly
recall the wonderful memories of college days. During these
four years, home was the Owl office. It was here that I
gained a true sense of belonging. The friendship, fun, and
fellowship that was ever-present in 805 made all the work enjoyable. There was no one on the staff who did not show
respect and admiration to his fellow staff member. WhenBurkhart            Overmire          Bonstedt
convinced Pitt students that the yearbook was just as
essential as any textbook. CHUCK, though only a freshman,
showed great promise. GENE executed the advertising section well. The staff, which included DARRELL, HARRY,
and RICK, trudged the streets and brought in the smaller
but no less important ads, and helped in following up the
accounts. All the organizations appearing in the book were
contacted and contracted by the organizations manager,
GARY, and his assistant, MARK. The ballyhooing and
banner-waving necessary to the publicizing of the Owl was
done by JACK, the publicity manager. Among other things,
he makes posters, addressed and sent out hundreds of postcards, and handled all matters of publicity that occurred
during the year. ILENE, who added glamor to the job of index manager, arranged, filed and kept the subscription cards
in order. MARY ELLEN kept all the accounts up to date,
and at the same time, added to the gaity and fun in the
office. Turning aside from the business staff, I would like to
express my thanks and appreciation to the editorial staff,
rrant              Green             Evans
ever I ran into difficulty, especially with typing, I could always rely on one of the staff to pull me out of trouble. I
think I shall always recall, with pleasant memories, the trips
to Buffalo and New York City. The fabulous Italian, German, French, and Swedish dinners, with DOC teaching us to
be gourmets, the trips to Niagara Falls, the informal cocktail parties, the cheesecake at Lindy's, the ACP Convention:
all of these memories will remain with me when I have long

HAWX, and DR. ~WARTS. The writers, photographers,
and other staff personnel who put the book together constituted some of the most likeable people at Pitt, and even
managed to teach me a little about the production of the
Owl. With little effort, HAWX and I managed to keep in

forgotten the long hours of work. Well, gang, I guess its
about time to say good-bye. Now that the book is finished
and paid for, HAWX can hop into his MG and go back to
dear old Indiana, and I can leave the sacred halls of the
eighth floor for the last time. No matter what I may accomplish the rest of my life, I will always consider my association with the Owl as one of the high spots in my career,
and some of my happiest years. With the great carry-over of
staff members, I am sure that next year's staff will be equal
to 1958's. Don't worry about the rough spots and the seemingly insurmountable problems; things usually work out for
the best. Good luck!

A SEAT ON THE LAWN is available to commuters who have long breaks between classes. ROTC puts
on a show in the afternoon, and the oxygen is somewhat purer than the Tuck Shop variety.
PRIVACY of one's own home is definitely more conducive
to study than the dorm or fraternity house. Besides, no one
borrows the typewriter.
A WASHER, DRYER AND IRON, easily accessible at home, make laundry a
rather minor problem to the commuter. This is especially true when these appliances
are combined with an obliging mother.
28
A HOME IN WHICH TO ENTERTAIN is an important advantage the commuter holds. Card
games, parties, and informal get-togethers enable her to keep in close touch with neighborhood friends throughout the year, not just on vacations.
THE TRIBULATIONS OF THE COMMUTER are not limited to just
traffic jams and scarce parking facilities; flat tires, dead batteries
and an occasional ticket are all part of the script.
       CURFEWS of the commuter are dependent solely on the feelings
       of the individual's parents. There are no dogmatic "one o'clocks,"
       and any lateness usually results in only a light reprimand.

                                                       Lantern Night ceremony
                                                             While Freshman Camp was the beginning of the men's search
                                                             for individuality, so, too, the Pitt women's search started
                                                             with the impressive Lantern Night ceremony. This tradi                                                             tional event, first performed in 1926, has been passed on,
                                                             with revisions, to all freshman women at Pitt. The express
                                                             purpose of Lantern Night was to help the freshman women
                                                             set their sights on an academic goal and to encourage them to
                                                             encompass all that college offers.
                                                                To emphasize this purpose, each woman was given a metal
                                                             lantern inscribed with her name and the University seal.
                                                             These lanterns, replicas of those lights by which Pitt's first
                                                             students studied, were presented to the freshmen by the
                                                             alumni. Then Father Pitt, portrayed by the Chief Justice of
                                                             Senior Court, led the freshmen and their mentors into the
                                                             Commons Room to receive the Gift of Light. There, in an
                                                             impressive ritual, the flame-bearers lit the lanterns; the flame
                                                             symbolized the search for truth, teachers, great books, true
                                                             friends, and love of God.
                                                               Alma Mater, portrayed by the president of W.S.G.A., en                                                             couraged the freshmen to always hold their lanterns high and
                                                             culminated the ceremony by leading them    in the pledge;
                                                             "By this flame within my hand, I pledge my word, O Alma
                                                             Mater, to seek for myself and for those who follow me, the
                                                             inner light of truth."
SENIOR MENTORS who accompanied their groups to Lantern Night were
given lighted lanterns to signify that they, as freshmen, had received the
Gift of Light.
ALMA MATER, flanked by Truth and Valor, entered the Commons Room to officially receive the freshmen women into the University.

links freshman women to Pitt
THE JOY OF BEING ACCEPTED into the university was reflected on the happy faces of three freshmen as they
examined one of the lanterns.
FATHER PITT, portrayed by Gladys Flesher, led the freshmen and their mentors
from Stephen Foster Memorial to the Commons Room.
BY LIGHTING THE LANTERNS, the flamebearers passed
onto the freshmen women the Gift of Light. As an integral
part of the University, they were now ready to meet the

SCHENLEY HALL, newest addition to Pitt's ever-growing campus, at last fills a long ignored
gap in student life. Its dormitories, union facilities, and meeting rooms make it the new center
of Pitt activity.

LOAFING, STUDYING, MEETING FRIENDS... Pitt students learn
to make good use of the Union's lounges. It is in such situations that
the real personality of college life becomes apparent, and a singleness of character emerges.
"THERE IS NO REST FOR THE WEARY"(except for a brief cat-nap, stolen between
classes in the Schenley lounge.)
A CASUAL MEETING outside the Union, a ten minute break for coffee,
a bull session in the room down the hall-these are the things that are
college.
THE NEW CAFETERIA, located on the ground floor-of the Union, is more
than just a modern eating place; it is another step in Pitt's climb to greatness.
33
SCHENLEY HOUSE at first glance looks exactly like what it once was-a hotel. But the cold, impersonal feeling of a hotel is gone,
replaced by the close, friendly spirit of a dorm.
A GOOD PLACE TO STUDY is the lounge of the Union. Comfortable chairs and
relative quiet are available to those with the will power to sit down and concentrate.
                                                                                                             THE VENETIAN ROOM, shown here prior to its open                    Mi                                                                                       ing, is designed for those occasions when a more formal

                              MODERN but still comfortable, the new cafeteria combines
                              fast, efficient service with reasonable prices. Here dorm
                              students eat all of their meals, and a good percentage of
                              the student body come for lunch.
                              A DELIGHTFUL CHANGE from the dreary Tuck Shop is
                              the Hunt Room in the new Union. Formerly a bar in the Hotel,
                              the Hunt Room is now a quiet place to sip a coke or have a
                              bull session.
STUDY BECOMES DIFFICULT when a discussion begins in the lounge. Some students sprawl
out in easy chairs, while others favor carpeted steps and marble columns.

RAISING CHILDREN is only one of the responsibilities that married students must face. Despite the problems a youngster causes, there is no greater source of joy to a family. Besides, he is a wonderful source of material
for English themes.

HOMEWORK has a hard time competing with daydreams when a husband is overseas. Married students,
especially women, find their lecture
notes liberally sprinkled with initials,
hearts, and an occasional grocery
list.
          STUDYING by the light of a television set requires a well-developed power of concentration.
          It is particularly hard for the married student to achieve a fair balance between his studies
          and social life, for it is often tempting to put the books aside for an evening and treat the wife
          to a show.
EVERY SPARE MOMENT must be utilized by the married student. The
strain of running a home, attending classes, and in some cases, being the
breadwinner, teaches him to budget his time as carefully as his money, because he always seems to be running short of both.

DR. EDWARD H. LITCHFIELD, Chancellor of the University of Pittsburgh greets the parents of incoming
Freshmen at his annual reception. He spoke to the parents
on the position of Pitt in the ever-changing world of education.
AT THE STUDENT UNION after the formal reception, Chancellor Litchfield and
his gracious wife received the parents of the Freshmen. A long waiting line made it
obvious that the parents were anxious to meet Dr. Litchfield.
COFFEE AND COOKIES were served by student hostesses in the Grand Ball Room of the new Student Union,
to bring to an end a successful and enjoyable evening.

inside look at Pitt at Chancellor's Reception
EXHAUSTED after an evening of hostessing, one of the girls relaxes for a few
moments before starting home. The night would not have been the success it was
without the help of the student hostesses and aides.
The parents of the new freshmen flocked to Pitt early in this
school year to attend the annual Chancellor's Reception. As
in previous years, Dr. Litchfield held this reception for the parents so that they might become acquainted with Pitt, with
the Administration, and with the Administration's ideals and
goals for Pitt in the future. This was the theme of Chancellor
Litchfield's speech to the parents, but he also discussed the
role that their sons and daughters would play in Pitt's future,
and the role that Pitt would play in their future. He added
that the parents themselves were now a part of the University, and he hoped that they would take an avid interest in
Pitt's affairs.
  After the formal part of the program was over, the parents
visited the new Student Union where they were served refreshments in the Ballroom.
  Meanwhile, Chancellor Litchfield and his charming wife
were receiving the guests. Thousands of parents waited,in
line in order to meet the Chancellor, shake his hand, and exchange a few hurried words with him. Dr. Litchfield was, indeed, a very popular man with the parents that night!
  Credit for a job well done should also go to the student hostesses and aides who served the refreshments, directed the people from one place to another, and answered questions about
the university, its buildings, traditions, and student life.
These students left the parents with a very high impression
of the University and the Pitt students.
MASTER OF CEREMONIES, Dean Theodore Biddle, introduced the Deans and
the Chancellor to the guests. It was here that many of the parents got their first impressions of the Faculty and the Administration.

         IN CLASS the student nurses get a laugh from one of their instructors, for even a
         field as serious as nursing cannot be all work and no play. Many of the Pitt men will
         readily admit that nurses are among the friendliest girls around.
THAT GENTLE TOUCH that nurses are so famous for is deeply appreciated when
one is ill. It is reassuring to know that these young women can be trusted to do the
right thing at all times.

"in Nursing School
In no other school of the University is so-called"on-the-job
training" so stressed as in the School of Nursing. Because of
close co-operation between the School of Medicine and the
School of Nursing, it is possible for the students to observe,
first hand, the things that they have been studying in the
classroom. At the affiliated hospitals, trainees work with experienced nurses in order to not only develop the skills required for the successful practicing of their profession, but to
learn the human aspect of nursing.
   The hospitals in the Medical Center now participating in
the program are the Elizabeth Steel Magee Hospital, (maternity), Children's Hospital, (children's afflictions), Presbyterian Hospital, (general medical and surgical). Women's Hospital, (women's diseases), Eye and Ear Hospital, Western
Psychiatric Institute, and the Falk Clinic.
   Another integral part of the Nursing School program is the
 Medical Center Nurses Residence on Lothrop Street. Here                       A LIFELIKE MANNIKIN is used to teach students the basic principles of

TAKING THE FIELD against Syracuse, the Panthers are greeted with a
cheer. The fired-up Orangemen used a last minute field-goal by Al Gerlick,
a third string tackle, to nip the favored Panthers, 24-21.

At each home game, the Panther frolicked when the team was moving and suffered great anguish when they lost the ball, and sometimes invaded the stands to harass the fans.

CONGRATULATIONS, like those offered to sophomore
guard Bob Longfellow, were earned by the Panthers,
whether they were victorious or defeated. They played
good football all year long, and earned the grudging
respect of all who opposed them.
SPINNING OUT OF THE GRASP of Cloyd Shilling, halfback John Flara picks
up a first down against Oklahoma. The Panthers had high hopes of being the team
to halt the winning ways of the westerners, but fell before the ball-controlling precision of the Sooner football machine.
BLOCK P, the student flashcard section, performed at all home games. Their colorful stunts
supplemented the band and cheerleaders in boosting student spirit, and afforded the members
a choice seat for all games.

ROW LEADERS FOR BLOCK P pick up their stunt cards as the first half
of the Syracuse game draws to a close. But every time a cry went up from
the stands their work was interrupted, as they jumped up to watch the action
on the field.
                                                                                             CHEERLEADERS, THE PANTHER, AND THE BAND combine

                                                                                             Despite a comparatively poor season, the fans remained loyal and

                              STILL WORRIED about the outcome of the Penn State game, Coach John Michelo                              sen is not reassured by the confidence of the squad. But his fears were groundless as
                              the Panthers nipped the Nittany Lions, 14-13.
INITIAL THRUST of the Pitt forward wall begins, as Ivan Toncic
spins around to hand off, and the Penn State defensive line surges
forward. The massive Panther line, among the heaviest in the nation,
went hand-in-hand with Coach Michelosen's grinding, relentless
ground attack.
47
ALL-AMERICAN CENTER Charlie Brueckman attempts to break up Oklahoma quarterback Dave Baker's pass. A mainstay on both offense and defense, Brueckman was considered by opponents one of the most vicious
blockers in the nation.
SWEEPING THE END, Syracuse halfback Tom Stephens is met by Panthers
Dick Bowen (42), Bob Stark (46), and Ivan Toncic (14), while Orange Teammate Dan Fogarty (29) looks pained at the turn of events.
A COVEY OF FIGHTING IRISH converge on Bill Kaliden, as Joe Scisly (36) prepares to act as a cushion.
Kaliden kept opponents guessing with effective mixing of handoffs, pass plays, and keepers.

DEFEAT is painfully reflected in the face of Panther end Art Gob, as he
slumps in the locker-room after the Notre Dame game. Unfortunately, this
scene was a common one for the Panthers during this worst season since 1951.
AN ANXIOUS BENCH studies the action on the field during the West Virginia game. Coach Michelosen made
good use of his reserves, and a number of substitutes came off the bench to become stars overnight.

THESE JUNIORS, under the new ROTC system in operation here at Pitt, drill by
themselves in preparation for the time, when as seniors, they will be cadet officers
and take command of the basic corps.
MILITARY BANDS, the heart of all parades, provide color for the ROTC reviews, and both the Army and the Air Force bands try to outdo
each other. Students are used to music drifting into their classrooms as the bands march across the lawn rehearsing for the spring review.

THE BASIC CORPS of Army ROTC is the foundation of the cadets training. Here, aside from attaining the military knowledge of the manual of arms, the
General Orders, and drill, the basics also learn discipline and obedience, for they must be able to follow orders before they can give them.
AIR FORCE ROTC COLOR GUARD passes before the reviewing stand during
the Chancellor's Review, one of the first ceremonies of the spring drill period. Other
highlights in the spring are the Federal Inspections of the Army and Air Force and
the Armed Forces Day Parade in downtown Pittsburgh.
                         RAISING AND LOWERING the flag in front of the Cathedral is
                         one of the duties of the Pitt ROTC. Every morning and evening this
                         ritual is carried out by a squad of Air Force or Army Cadets.
51
SUMMER CAMP where the advanced ROTC cadets spend six weeks between their junior and senior years, provides realistic combat training. This is their first
real taste of military life. Here a squad gets practice in small unit tactics as part of a large scale battle maneuver.
           RIFLE MARKSMANSHIP is another of the many skills attained by the advanced cadet during his stay at the
           ROTC summer camp. Here under the watchful eyes of an army noncom instructor, cadets practice rapid fire in
           prone position. These cadets know that their lives may someday depend on their markmanship. An absolute knowl           edge of the M-1 rifle is a vital necessity for an infantryman.

BUCKLING ON PARACHUTES, Air Force cadets prepare to try their hand at the actual piloting of a plane. Careful instruction, combined with

ROUND-TABLE DISCUSSIONS review common problems of students in the retailing field, and, by their informal nature, stimulate
an exchange of ideas.
                     PUBLIC OPINION POLL, taken by retailing student, attempts to
                     ascertain the changing trends in the buying habits of the American
                     people. These statistics are studied,and from them,retailers are able
                     to formulate merchandising policy.
CHANGING STYLES of fashion are important considerations in many phases of retailing. Here students demonstrate how the tastes in women's vogues have undergone
radical changes, and hint that the high fashion of each
generation may be, in reality, only a fad.
ADVERTISING LAYOUT is one of the important aspects of any marketing program, students
learn to judge relative merits of various types of ads, and are taught the fine points of the art
of swaying public opinion.

ACTIVE AND ALUMNI DINNERS and open houses were sponsored by
some fraternities to celebrate Homecoming and welcome fraternity alumni
back.
                                           BEFORE THE GAME, the various fraternities assembled at their houses,
                                           and amidst shouts and cheers, went to the stadium in a group in order to sit
                                           as a fraternity and cheer the team on.

THE QUEEN'S FLOAT transports the Queen and her Court around the stadium at
half-time. Along with the Queen, Nancy Houlihan, was Grace Weiss, Maid of Honor,
and the three other members of the court, Peggy DePaulis, Nancy Ahlgren, and Lois
Smith. Their float was built by Alpha Phi Omega, service fraternity at Pitt.
AT THE HOMECOMING DANCE the tension was high, and the excitement grew
as the time for announcing the winners of the float parade neared. When Phi Sigma
Sigma and Phi Kappa finally found out that they had won, they went wild at first,
then calming down, they held their trophies high and sang songs of victory.
Freshman
THE PANHELLENIC CHOIR made up of three girls from each sorority presented a program of songs of all sororities. In the center of the stage
is the Wheel of Flowers, traditional part of the reception.
REFRESHMENTS were served on the 12th floor after the reception. Here
the freshmen women and sorority members mingled and got acquainted.

women discover sororities at Panhel Reception
SORORITY GIRLS do a little harmonizing to entertain their guests and for
their own amusement. Pitt sororities, like their sisterhoods on all other campuses, are traditionally songsters and can outsing most fraternities.
Panhellenic Association, the governing body for social sororities at Pitt, held its annual reception for freshmen and transfer women on November 15, in Stephen Foster Memorial Auditorium.
  The ceremony, attended by 300 freshmen and transfer
women, 75 guests, and members of the faculty and administration, was aimed at introducing these new women students
to the sixteen social sororities on campus and to the life these
organizations offer their members.
  Lois Hamilton, Vice-President of Panhellenic, was chairman of the reception. She delivered a welcoming address in
which she explained the benefits of sorority life at Pitt and
the spirit of friendliness and belonging that develops among
their members.
   After the speech, a chorus, composed of three members of
each sorority, dressed in pastel gowns, presented a program
of favorite sorority songs. After singing each particular sorority's song, a representative of that sorority placed a bouquet
made up of her sorority's flower on the traditional wheel of
flowers.
   Following the formal part of the ceremony, the freshmen
women, attending the reception with their senior mentors,
retired to the twelfth floor of the Cathedral of Learning. Here
the sorority girls circulated among the freshmen women,
meeting them and answering their questions about sorority
life at Pitt.
WORKING TOGETHER for an affair like Panhellenic Reception allows the sorority girls to
meet members of other groups and create new friendships. These friendships help pull the sororities together and provides for a closely-knit Panhellenic Association.
MIXING FREELY after the formal part of the program the freshmen girls, their Senior Mentors, Sorority girls, and guests filled the
12th floor. Refreshments, questions, and joking brought the evening
to a happy end.

HEADING THE BALL, Sammy Hazou was an important asset to the team
at all times, and Ohio State found him a worthy adversary in the game that
Pitt won 4-0.
MAKING A LEAPING SAVE during the Ohio State game, Pitt
goalie, Ron Goga, demonstrated his superior ability in this key spot.
Watching the save is Jerry Bressanelli, No. 17, Pitt's All-American.
ATTEMPTING A GOAL against Grove City, Simon Pestich
boots a high one. He didn't make it, but Pitt still went on to
win 1-0, by virtue of a goal by Jerry Bressanelli. The defensive strength of the Panthers is shown by the fact that they
shut out six of their ten opponents, and allowed two of the
others a sole goal apiece. This superior defense did not hamper Pitt's offensive, though, as they scored in every game.
All-American
Springing back from last season's slump, the Panther
booters wrapped up a fine season this year and ended up
with a record of eight wins and two losses. Noteworthy high
points in this season's record were the six shutout victories,
a tough win over a very good Army team on their home
field at West Point, and the performance of Jerry Bressanelli,
who made All-American again this year.
  Coach Leo Bemis, who inaugurated the sport at Pitt,
developed and led a squad that was especially strong on
defense. The one bad loss, 10-1, that the Panthers suffered
at the hands of Penn State was caused mainly by the loss of
two regulars, absent from the ranks because of injuries incurred in the previous game. Bob Long, one of the injured
players, had a broken leg, but Coach Bemis stated that it has
healed properly and that he expected Long to be a deciding
factor next season.
   Jerry Bressanelli, a senior, finished up his soccer career at
Pitt in a royal fashion by being selected as All-American by
officials and coaches from all over the country. Bressanelli,
one of last year's high scorers, spent most of this year
setting up goals for his teammates and provided the impetus
that drove the booters on to victory.
   Other outstanding players for the Panthers were high
scoring Sam Hazou, who also played his last season for Pitt,
dependable goalie Ron Goga, Jack Hester, Harold Kipp and
Bill Eisenger, all of whom were outstanding on the defense.
            HARD-DRIVING ACTION like that of Lee Goodman and Jason
            Shrinsky is characteristic of Pitt's soccer games. The Panthers must
            play hard to stay among the top teams and to preserve their record
            of never having lost a game at Pitt Stadium.
OUTDRIBBLING A DEFENDER Sammy Hazou again proves his versatility.
Sammy is a native Jordanian who never played any soccer until he came to
Pitt, but he learned fast and became one of the Panthers' big guns.
Snow paints campus in cold beauty
A RAPIDLY ACCUMULATING snowfall requires some emergency measures, and the University snow plow is called into action. Man-made contrivances and machines notwithstanding, snow still manages to battle the
Pitt family on even terms.
The coming of winter to the Pitt campus is not so much dependent on a calendar date as it is on the fickleness of the
weather, for winter officially begins at Pitt with the first coming of snow. Not until a white blanket is spread over the rolling lawns, and trees and hedges are painted frosty silver, and
cotton-like snow piles up in drifts do the Pitt students agree
that Winter has arrived.
  The cold, austere beauty of the snow loses some of its appeal, however, when blustery winds whistle down Fifth Avenue against chilled students, juggling to keep balance on the
slippery sidewalks, while icy streets necessitate slow, cautious, nerve-wracking driving, and traffic tieups make lateness a constant problem. Hand in hand with the snow came
the first rash of colds, and even more serious, the severe Asian
flu epidemic that flattens its share of Pitt students, and
plays havoc with a number of Q.P.A.'s.
  Despite all the discomforts it is responsible for, winter
brings with it new ways of having fun. Snowmen appear on
the stately formal lawn in front of the Cathedral, snowballs
are packed and tossed, and hordes of district children invade
the campus to slide down the terraces. The sled-riding idea
is catching, and tobogganing becomes one of the most popular date ideas, ranking with such mainstays as ice skating
and week-end skiing trips.
  The departure of winter is again a matter of weather
rather than calendar, for when the soft, sterile snow turns
gray and slushy, and the sun breaks through to raise the
temperature above freezing, winter is considered past, and
the Groundhog notwithstanding, Spring is just around the
corner.
COLLEGIATE SOPHISTICATION seems to disappear when snow begins to fall; sled-riding, snowman construction, and snowball
fights become a part of campus life. A brief, energetic excursion into the cold, and then quickly inside to thaw out helps develop an
appreciation for winter and its effects.
PEACE AND QUIET seem to descend on Pitt with the coming of the snow and cold weather. Even the bustling Student Union becomes hushed, at least
on the outside. Few students are willing to brave the cold for their bull sessions; the warmth of the lounge or cafeteria is much more appealing.
A NARROW PATH, such as the
one on Athletic Walk, enables students to gain ready access to all the
scattered buildings of the University
plant. Knee-high drifts discourage
short cuts, and caution is the byword
along slippery walks.

to maintain a flexible governmental program. As with all the student government
organizations, A. W. S.'s power and restrictions, as well as their rules and by-laws
are contained in a written constitution.
WELL-ATTENDED MEETINGS of the A. W. S. made it possible to
draw up and pass legislature for the benefit of the women students.
Much of A. W. S.'s work is done through standing committees which
direct specialized programs.

student government
Student government is, theoretically, one of the most important features in the functioning of a university. Made up of
students elected by their respective classes or by the University as a whole, the various student governing organizations
at Pitt all have one common, ultimate goal-to reflect the
wishes of student body.
   Needs and interests of the student's educational and social
 life should be studied and programs could be promoted to fos ter goodwill and constructive co-operation. These student
 government groups are able to co-ordinate scattered student
 activities into a unified, systematic whole. Although the var ious student-governing bodies are composed of an elected
 membership, any student is permitted to sit in on the meet ings and express his sanction or disapproval of their policies
 and legislature.
   Annual spring elections to student government offices are
 marked by active campaigning and vigorous electioneering.
 Sound trucks circle the Cathedral, cards with the candidates'
 slogans appear suddenly in the Tuck Shop and Commons
 Room, and the candidates scurry about, trying to drum up
 support. Student political parties work just as hard as their
 counterparts in the national scale; ballyhooing their candi dates, getting out the vote, and campaigning at the polls.
   The experience a student gains by participating in student
 government serves him a good stead upon graduation; not
 only has he gained in leadership training, but has obtained a
 background in practical politics.
 HITCHHIKING, the order of the day during the long
trolley strike, was facilitated by "1 GO TO PITT" signs,
printed and distributed by Student Congress. At the same
time, student government also attempted to ease the
parking problem.
MINUTES of the last meeting of the Engineer's and Mine's Cabinet are read
and corrected. E. and M., the governing body for the Engineering and Mines
School, has for its main objective the consideration of those problems pertaining to their school.
ALL THE PARAPHERNALIA that goes toward a student government meeting
must be collected beforehand. Often material, in the form of minutes, budgets, and
information guides, is distributed to the membership.
67
AMOUNT OF INTEREST shown by the student body toward student
government varies, but for every disinterested day-dreamer there is
a truly attentive student. Here an E. and M. meeting is confronted
by mixed emotions on the parts of two participants.
A POINT IS MADE in one of the informal debate sessions that are, of
necessity, a part of these meetings. Though Robert's Rules of Order hold
forth, members sometimes forget themselves and speak out of turn, a situation that must be nipped in the bud.
ARGUMENT over a proposed bill in an A. W. S. meeting may well sway the opinion of the dissenter and cause
her to change her mind. But sometimes no amount of persuasiveness can sway her feeling, and the decision must
be finally settled only by voting.
FRESHMAN CAMPAIGN POSTERS were plastered all over the eighth floor during their two-week publicity drive. The elections, in November, spelled for some the beginning of a long stay in collegiate politics.
SPEAKERS, movies, and various other entertainment facets were included in the
Student Congress assemblies program.
INTER-FRATERNITY COUNCIL, the governing body for all the fraternities on
campus, strives to maintain harmonious relationships between the groups. Here,
President Bert O'Malley addresses the membership.
69
E &amp; M EXECUTIVE BOARD (Betty Anuszkiewicz, sec., Bob Muzik
v. p., Joe Martinelli pres.) conduct a meeting. The executive board
plans the agenda for the meetings ahead of time, and insures their
smooth functioning.
        MINUTES of the meeting are particularly important in student gov        ernment. All the important business of preceding meetings is con        tained, along with committee reports and all proposals.
DINNER, prior to the meetings, gives the A. W. S. a better chance
to bring out full membership.
70
OPEN VOTING is the rule for most student government organizations. Only for such
events as officer elections is the secret ballot used.
DISCUSSION BY MEMBERS of student government bodies helps promote the
formulation of policy that reflects the feelings of the majority.

                            STUDYING EXPERIMENTAL ANIMALS is one way to ascertain
                            the effect of certain drugs, and theorize on their effect upon humans.
OTHER FEATURES of the pharmacy school include exhibits in the health
professions building, a student council, numerous fraternities and sororities,
and a quarterly magazine, the Pitt Capsule.

studies, activities
AN EXACT BALANCE is required when dealing with pharmaceutical measurements. Preciseness in every measurement is vital in each problem, for
a mistake of half a milligram can well prove disastrous to the pharmacist.
  DELICATE INSTRUMENTS, through constant use, become a useful
  tool to the pharmacist. He must learn to master these apparatus if he
  is to become proficient at his profession.
The Pittsburgh College of Pharmacy was founded in 1878 and
chartered under the laws of Pennsylvania, although it did not
legally become a part of the University until 1948. On January 26, 1948, the merger with the University was made complete, and all of its activities became integrated with the University.
   The basic purpose of the School is to equip young men and
women for successful careers in the profession of pharmacy.
The School also seeks to promote competency in the fundamental arts and sciences upon which pharmacy is based, to
develop proficiency in the technology of pharmacy, and to
cultivate the capacity to co-operate constructively with
members of the other health professions.
  In fulfilling these aims, the School of Pharmacy has created
a program that is a balance between scholastic and extracurricular activities.
  Each year the junior and senior class visits the laboratories
of large drug manufacturing establishments. These visits are
considered essential in the education of the student in pharmacy, and students assume costs of transportation for these
visits.
  Students in the School of Pharmacy have full privileges in
all libraries of the Health Center. The School also makes use
of a student council, an Alumni News Review, and the School
of Pharmacy Interfraternity Council. The School turns out
pharmacists who are proud,to say they are graduates of the
University of Pittsburgh's School of Pharmacy.
METICULOUS CLEANLINESS is one of the essential habits developed in Pharmacy
School. All equipment is kept spotlessly clean; students learn that in their field,
purity is the only acceptable standard.

ROBERT L. ARTHUR, University Band Director, is largely responsible for the band's success and nationally recognized high
ranking. A talented musician and painstaking taskmaster, Arthur is
respected by all who know him.
  PRACTICE SESSIONS for the band are held in the Panther Room. At Band Camp, held the week before school
  at Camp Kon-O-Kwee, members practice formations, learn new shows, and brush up on their marching.
  Thereafter, twice a week, practice sessions enable the band to keep sharp.

BENNY BENACK, assistant director, rips out a solo in "When the Saints Go

Dixieland, and performs them all with equal quality and vigor. A distinctive

up spirit.

SOME BAND MEMBERS looked forward
to Florida for its sunshine, swimming, and
parading...
WHILE OTHERS had a different impression of the fun that Florida had to offer.
The trip to Miami was one of the highlights of the year for the band, in effect, a
winter vacation for all of the members.
BOB MORLEY, Bandman of the Year, receives his award from
assistant director Bill Svec. A senior in engineering, Morley is the
leader of the cornet section. His selection, based on overall popularity, was made by the band as a whole, with the trophy furnished
by Kappa Kappa Psi, the honorary band fraternity.
76
A TRIBUTE TO SYRACUSE is extended by the band at the homecoming game. At every home game, and at several away games, they entertained the
fans at halftime with shows; shows that effectively combined precision drill with good martial music.
A LONG TRAIN RIDE can get boring, even when Florida is the destination. Bull sessions help pass the
time away, but sometimes a prolonged nap is the best possible solution.

Organizations aid total development of the
U. S. SENATOR JOSEPH CLARK is interviewed by five members of the William Pitt Debate Union on the Union's weekly panel discussion program over
Station WQED. The nationally famous Pitt debaters walked off with a number of trophies in intercollegiate competition, and demonstrated their talents at
various district high schools.
A TRADITIONAL GERMAN DANCE is performed by Kyra Mock and Mel Choolitch as part of the German Club's presentation at the annual modern language
Christmas party. Open to any student of German, the Club attempts to promote the
customs and traditions of Germany.
PERT PEGGY DEPAULIS seems pleased with the new student directory, as Chuck Gennaula of Alpha Phi Omega makes another sale. The directory, co-sponsored by A Phi O,
the men's service fraternity and Cwens, the sophomore women's organization, is an invaluable aid for any phase of student affairs, especially when it comes to getting dates.
78
college student
Because a University education is today accepted as not simply training in some particular field of study, but rather the
means by which the well-rounded individual is molded, the
role of campus organizations becomes increasingly important.
In these groups the student finds the intangibles he cannot
receive in the classroom or laboratory, but they also offer
him the opportunity to put into practice the theoretical policies that his books have taught him. By publishing a newspaper, or by serving in student government, or by playing a
clarinet, or even by taking out a defensive halfback, a wider,
fuller scope of life is open to the activities man. If his classes
teach him about atoms and adjectives and chromosomes and
constitutions, his organizations teach him about people. He
learns to meet people, to understand them, to like them and
make them like him. He discovers that respect and consideration on his part will be answered in kind. He learns the
value of "please" and "thank you," and the danger of too
much "I." He finds that teamwork is not restricted to the
athletic field; it is a necessary part of any project. He develops his qualities of leadership and learns how to use them.
  Organizations, therefore, are as necessary to the total education of a student as compulsory credits in any field. The
holding of an office or position of high authority is not necessary to reap these benefits, for the participating general
membership is the backbone of any organization. Hence the
values of organizations are obtainable by all students, and
are returned proportionately to the effort set forth.
INTERMURAL SPORTS, ranging from volleyball to bridge, enable the sports
minded Pitt students to engage in organized competition. Competition is high between the various groups, and keen rivalries often develop and become traditional.
BUSINESS MEETINGS, though often uninteresting, are needed for the proper functioning of any organization. The Photo Club, with
thousands of dollars worth of photographic equipment, must keep careful check on its books, and finds these meetings a necessary
evil.

Illness and ineligibility hamper harriers
  But they still compile winning record
TEAM CAPTAIN Vince Timon leads the pack along the cross country course
in Schenley Park. Impressive natural beauty makes the park an unusually
scenic field for competition.
              LAST MINUTE WORDS to the runners are supplied by Slippery Roi
              Snowberger. The boys from the north ran a good race, but to no avai
              them, 17-41.
At the completion of this year's schedule, the Pitt crosscountry team had compiled a commendable record of five
wins and two defeats.
   Unfortunately  scholastic ineligibility and illness pre vented the Pitt harriers from competing as a team in the
 IC4A Championships, but Ron Rush and John Christof, two
 of the team's outstanding runners, were able to be present at
 the IC4A's to represent Pitt. Out of a field of 201 runners
 Rush and Christof finished 35th and 59th. Both of these
 Panthers have one more year of eligibility for competition in
 the IC4A's, but Vince Timon, who is a senior this year, will
 not be available for next year's running. Timon was a con sistent winner again this year, and Coach Carl Olson could
 always depend on him to come through when needed.
   Other runners who were important mainstays to the team
 were George Walters, Ron Goldstein, Vince Wojnar, and
 Sam Grisciotti. Coach Olson, a veteran at Pitt, was to a
 great extent responsible for the fine record that the team
 compiled this season, and he is hopeful that next year's
 season will equal or better this one.
   Cross country is a sport that requires the combination of
 outstanding individuals and well balanced team effort to be
 victorious. The star who can finish first is necessary, of
 course, but very important also are the solid supporting men
 who can consistently pick up second, third, and fourth places
 in order to carry the team into the winner's circle.
                     A ONE, TWO, THREE FINISH for Pitt took place dur                     in*g the West Virginia meet. Although the day was rainy
                     and the course slippery, veteran Tom Dudas, and fresh                     men Mick Jupina and Pat Murphy showed the Mountain:k Coach Jim         eers their heels and helped the Panthers to win 15-48.
il, as Pitt took     It was the most lopsided score that the harriers piled up
                     during the season.

      A LITTLE PUBLICITY FOR THE TEAM is always valuable and Coach Carl Olsen
      makes sure that the newsmen and photographers have the right names. Newspaper
      coverage of cross-country, never as adequate as the coaches would like, often
      varies with the team's success.
BEFORE THE MEET Trainer Danny Sommer is kept busy taping ankles, as here
with Vince Timon prior to the Kentucky meet, and generally keeping the boys in top
shape. In a sport such as cross-country, where endurance is especially important,
the slightest injury or sprain must be attended to immediately, and if possible,
prevented.

DECORATING THE NATIONALITY ROOMS for Christmas is the job of the foreign language clubs and the
Nationality Room Hostesses. These rooms are decorated
exactly as they would be in their original countries. The
German Club has a good time decorating their room
and tree.
PAGEANTS DEPICTING THE CHRISTMAS STORY and other related Biblical tales were presented by the
language clubs at the annual student Christmas party, held in the Common's Room. Each year, Sigma Kappa Phi,
the honorary language fraternity, sponsors this program.
82
Christmas gaiety, fun abound at Pitt
Pageantry and ceremony, universal symbols of Christmas,
were as evident at Pitt as anywhere in the world. The entire
student body joined in the festivities, even if just in thought.
In any season, the Pitt student seizes every opportunity
available to celebrate in one way or another, and Christmas
gave him unbounded opportunities.
  For the entire week before Christmas, the classrooms, halls,
and elevators echoed and re-echoed the joyous carols that
reverberated from the Commons Room organ. Groups of
students gathered around it, lifting their voices in song, while
others found themselves humming the simple, yet beautiful
melodies of these tunes.
  Even the cold, impersonal physical plant of the University
took on the spirit of Christmas. A charming nativity scene
was set up in the Italian Nationality Room, the offices of the
Deans of Men and Women were decorated in red and green,
and the traditional cross of lights burned all night in the upper floors of the Cathedral.
  Highlight of the Christmas season was the Commons Room
Ball. While pastel-gowned    and black-tuxedoed couples
danced to the music of Ray Eberle, yule logs, gaily decorated
Christmas trees, and sprigs of mistletoe helped to dispell the
somewhat drab solemnity of the Commons Room.
  But with the ending of the dance, the students went home
to their own Christmas celebrations, and Pitt grew silent.
Christmas had gone-until next year.
THE UNIVERSITY OFFICES, both academic and administrative, were
decorated for the Yuletide season. Typical of these offices was the Dean
of Men's Office on the eighth floor of the Cathedral. Some offices in the
building vied with others on the same floor and tried to outdo each other
in decorating.
INTENT UPON WATCHING the German Club's pageant, these students are typical of those who attended the Common's Room program. The entire audience watched the show in rapt silence, a tribute to
the talents of the performers.
83
ENTERTAINING AT THE COMMON'S ROOM BALL,
Dr. Catherine Allen sang a combination of folk and
Christmas songs. She also led calling in a number of
square dances, a novel change from the formality of
the ball.
FRAMED BETWEEN THE GEORGE HUBBARD CLAPP GATES, several
couples at the Christmas Ball dance to the music of Ray Eberle's orchestra.
The pastel shaded gowns, the bright trees and decorations, and the dreamy
music all blended together to make it "the perfect night."
THE ANNUAL PUBLICATIONS PARTY, one of the highlights of the
Christmas season for the members of Pitt's three publications, was climaxed
by the presentation of gifts from the three groups to Dr. Donald Swarts,
advisor to student publications.
84
THE SOCIAL HIGHLIGHT OF THE WINTER SEASON
is the Christmas Common's Room Ball. The Cathedral's
massive Gothic architecture provided an impressive atmosphere for the dance, and mistletoe located at various points aided in making the dance more interesting.
WARM CHEERY BONFIRES helped to provide the
Common's Room with the right atmosphere. There's probably nothing like a blazing fireplace in the winter to
put one in a dreamy mood, and that was the mood that
seemed to pervade the Ball that night.

assume many roles
The Pitt Engineering Schools endeavor to educate their students in the fundamental sciences and techniques, and the
principles of their application. These Schools also try to develop more than a normal degree of natural curiousity, and to
encourage the student's desire to contribute through the utilization of these skills to the welfare and improvement of the
culture and society in which he lives.
  The Schools of Engineering and Mines are fortunate in being associated with a large university which offers many
courses of the cultural nature. Its graduates are thus qualified
not only as technical experts, but they also have the capacity
to live full and useful lives as employers or leaders in their
communities.
  It is obvious that the advantages are great for an engineering school located in a city such as Pittsburgh, for although
this district is popularly considered to be synonymous with
the steel industry, Western Pennsylvania is also a great coal
center and some of the largest oil companies and their research laboratories are situated here. This area also boasts
one of the largest synthetic rubber industries, one of the largest
electrical plants in the world, an automobile fabrication plant,
and many other industries. These companies provide, in
many cases, the opportunity for engineering students to gain
valuable "on the job" training. Thus, with this program for
practical application of technical theory, the Pitt engineer
graduates with a rich background of experience.

student publications
Everyone is interested in learning about the events that occur
around him, and the students at Pitt are no exception. The
University of Pittsburgh's major publications are the means
by which these students stay informed. The Pitt News, published twice a week, informs the students of each day's events
and happenings. Meanwhile, an engineering student who
wishes to become better acquainted with contemporary advances in science or increase his technical knowledge may
read the Skyscraper Engineer. The Pitt Capsule, read avidly
by Pharmacy students, deals mainly with subjects relating to
pharmacy. An over-all view of life at the University on a
yearly basis, and lasting mementos of years at Pitt are offered
by the Owl.
  Dr. Donald E. Swarts, advisor for all student publications,
is really a great guy and is well liked by all.
  Although working on a publication affords the student an
opportunity to develop skill and proficiency in journalistic
fields, a staff member is not a literary drudge. However, when
the Owl has a deadline or The News must be sent to the printer
the following day, staff members have become accustomed
to working far into the night. Because having to meet a deadline brings many students together, friendship and companionship are found by working for one of the publications.
                                                                        NEIGHBORING business managers, Fred Horn of the Skyscraper Engineer

University services ease student problems
DR. CARLSON, a legend in himself, heads the men's section of the Student Health
Service. To him come every manner of ailment, from splinters to cysts.
Because of the vast complexity of a University like Pitt, the
problems that plague a student, whether of a medical, financial, employment, or guidance nature, are an ever present
problem. To overcome them, the University maintains a number of services, open, at no cost, to students.
   Mass inoculations against polio and influenza at Pitt are
 only one of the features of the Student Health Service. For the
 women students, it includes a physical entrance examination
 for freshmen and transfers, emergency infirmary care and
 even a day sleeping room for commuters and any others need ing rest. The men's branch makes available, free of charge,
 emergency treatment and corrective advice.
   All scholarships are handled through the Central Scholar ship Office. Here students may obtain advice and assistance
 in financing their education, not only through scholarships,
 but as the first step in receiving a loan.
   One of the biggest problems a university student must face
is the question of which field is he best suited to enter. To
help arrive at an answer to this, the Counseling Center,
through use of the best contemporary counseling techniques,
psychological testing, and personal interview, shows the student a clearer picture of himself than he has ever seen before.
  After coming to a final choice of vocation, the student may
make use of the Placement Service to either obtain a parttime job, or arrange for senior interviews with companies in
the field of their choice.
       PART-TIME JOBS for Pitt personnel are available through the University Placement Service. A wide
       range of positions are available, and an interview enables the student to select the one that appeals
       to him.
VOCATIONAL SELECTION  is aided by
material from the Counseling Service. Test
results, brochures, and interviews aid the student in making up his mind about his field of
study.
             94
PERSONAL GUIDANCE is one of the methods used by
Dr. Heath in the University Counseling Service. Along
with vocational aid, the Counseling Service strives to
help the individual in all phases of college adjustment.
MASS INOCULATION of both polio
and influenza vaccine, a function of
the Health Service, is one of their
countless steps toward making Pitt
America's healthiest school.
     JOB OPPORTUNTIES are clearly outlined in the numer     ous pamphlets in the Placement Bureau Library. Every
     job from architect to zoologist is sketched, with advan     tages and disadvantages clearly stated.
