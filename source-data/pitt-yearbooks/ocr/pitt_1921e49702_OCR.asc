Oliver A. Atkinson
Carrick, Pa.

Member, Evening School Association

As Dickens so interestingly portrayed
Oliver Twist to us in literature, so is
“our Oliver” in reality in school life.
There is a bright side to everything and
the world has no room for a pessimist,
in his philosophy. Atkinson is a loyal
student, a cheerful companion and a fel-
low we are proud to claim as an associ-
ate and friend.

II. Stanley Bouer
Pittsburgh, Pa.

His favorite motto is “Silence is
Golden” so perhaps we would please him
best by observing it in his write-up.

Patrick Joseph Boyle
Pittsburgh, Pa.

Member, Evening School Association

Have Yﬁu noticed that proud and
bright countenance on Pat recently?
He’s the happy daddy of a bouncing
baby boy, that’s why. And you should
hear Pat describe the coming President!
—or is it a Traffic Expert, Pat?

John J. Fitzpatrick, “Fit/z"
Pittsburgh, Pa.

Catholic High School, Philadelphia,
Pa.
Student Chemical Society (3)

Gaze upon Fitzpatrick, ladies and
gentlemen. Yes, he’s the one who came
from Phillie. We just learned the
other day that he has been receiving
mail from a lady in Kansas. (There’s a
ieason). His fame now stretches from
Oakland to Soho and even to East
Liberty.

Charles H. Harroun
Meadville, Pa.

Owl Editor, Pharmacy

Mistakes happen even in the best-
regulated families, which helps to ex-
plain how Charles is here. Charles is
a. pharmacist and his name belongs in
that list of names, but we hope he
doesn’t mind being with us just for a
short while.

0. Arthur Frommant James A K W
Pittsburgh, Pa.

Owl Editor, Evening Economics;
Vice-President, Evening School Asso-
ciation; Vice-Chairman, Executive
Committee, E. S. A.; Publicity
Manager, “Pitt Weekly.”

A progressive, live-wire officer,

Works hard night and day.

Breezy, responsive and helpful,

Always happy and ready to smile,
“Art” is on the job all the while,

A hustler true, when there’s something

to do.
Always active for the E. S. A.
We all know him, “C. A. F. J.”

H. G. Smail
Brookville, Pa.

Class President (3)

Here is another misplaced pharmacist.
My, haven’t they a shocking tendency
to get misplaced!

David Whitman
Pittsburgh, Pa.

Manager Owl Evening School; Mem-
ber, Evening School Association.

Dave is some little Manager too—
not only of a literary publication, but
of all other things he undertakes.

We look for big things from Dave,
for he’s a studious boy and well liked
by all who know him.

Martha Alice Brown

Pittsburgh, Pa.

Member, Evening School Association

Still attending school. And we’re
proud of her too. A friend of all who
know her, whose wise and thoughtful
counsel is always helpful.

David Sterling Cooper A K ‘I’

Pittsburgh, Pa.

Member, Evening School Association

Not many “Post-Grads.”‘ﬁnd time to
attend four classes a week. Always a
cheerful smile. A vivid example of
ambition and industriousness. Good
luck, Dave, and we know you'll achieve
what you are striving for.

Elvera Hamstrom

Pittsburgh, Pa.

Member, Evening School Association

Additional to her other work, Miss
Hamstrom never fails to appear in
Doctor White’s Advanced Psychology
Class-—and We don’t blame her, for
we’re all booster’s of Doctor White.
Elvera doesn’t say much—to us, at
least—but she’s a keen “listener” and
a believer in what is known as “food
for thought.” Always a smile, delight-
fully feminine and a good word for all.

Francis Arnold Hegner A K ‘I’

Sewickley, Pa.

Executive Committee, Evening School

Association

Frank’s still with us—and what
would the school do without him? He's
been ﬂattered and complimented so
many times in the Owl that we refuse
to elaborate further. But may we not
repeat with all sincerity that he’s the
kind the school needs? Big hearted,
broad minded and everybody’s friend.
And have you heard that Frank is now
the head of a fami1y?—Rather he’s
married. (Frank admits he’s the head
when his wife’s away.)

Harry Earl Meese A K ‘I’

Carrick, Pa.

Member, Evening School Association

A bright and refreshing-to-know fel-
low, is Harry. And industrious doesn’t
begin to describe him! We are all hop-
ing that Harry will read up on “Sys-
tems” and eventually adopt some
method whereby the Book Store will

have text books in season for use at the
opening of school next year and ensu-
ing years. No we’re not knocking,
Harry; we know.what a job you have,
and then the publishers are some times
(?) slow, aren’t they?

William J. Provost A K \P
Dormont, Pa.

Executive Committee, Evening School
Association

“A friend in need is a friend indeed.”
That’s Bill—a friend every time. Rem-
member the little story about the wise
owl, “The less he spoke, the more he
heard”, etc.? That’s Bill. He doesn’t
say much, but when he does he says
something. We hope he’ll be a “Post-
Grad.” for many more years, for we
beneﬁt by his school experience and
sound judgment. And have you noticed
the interest Bill has cultivated for jazz
music and that “queer” dancing of late?
He sure did step out at the “Prom.”

Frederick A. Rohrmann, Jr. A K ‘P

Pittsburgh, Pa.

Member, Evening School Association

Would it surprise you to see friend
Rohrmann on Pitt’s Evening School
faculty? He taught the “Systems”
class for two nights this semester. But
then who could work for the paltry
salary of a “school master”, when there
is a. ﬁeld as attractive as the automobile
line? Didn’t you see him at the Auto
Show? Oh, my! Fred, like all of the
other “old-timers”, is true blue, a
booster of Pitt, and a cheerful and help-
ful student and colleague.

Anna A. Adams

Crafton, Pa.

Member, Evening School Association
“A gem, to be sure, and ever persever-
ing.”
William Henry Ashford A K ‘I’

Pittsburgh, Pa.

Member, Evening School Association

Bill’s never without a toby and a
smi1e——and we love him all the more
for the smile. .

Horace 0. Beck

Pittsburgh, Pa.

Member, Evening School Association

Remember the story of the tortoise
and the hare? Horace isn’t so slow,
but he’s of that quiet, diligent attitude;

exact and efficient in everything, and al-
ways responsive. He’s true blue!

Herbert Breese
Pittsburgh, Pa.

Member, Evening School Association

A prince of a fellow and an asset to
our School.

Meyer Coon

Pittsburgh, Pa.

Member, Evening School Association

Did you notice Meyer at the big hop
in the Fall at the “Penn” Ball Room?
Meyer’s little, but oh my! A diligent
plugger and liked by all.

Harry Coon

Pittsburgh, Pa.

Member, Evening School Association

As was once said about Harry, “Men
may groan and men may moan, but I
sing on forever.” And Harry’s still
singing too. A studious boy with it all,
and we know there are big things in
store for him in the business world.
Success again, Harry!

Charles J. Drummond A I‘ (1)

Pittsburgh, Pa.

Member, Evening School Association

Here’s Charlie with us again—and
how cold the School would be without
him and his perpetual smile and ever
optimistic View of things! Notice that
digniﬁed pose in the pcture of the Even-
ing Class? Yes, that’s Charlie himself,
but he’s suppressed his smile. Those
who don’t know him are missing a lot,
for he’s sterling through and through.

Margaret Edwards

Pittsburgh, Pa.

Member, Evening School Association

You bet the Evening School has some
fair co-eds! And Miss Edwards is one
of the foremost. Quiet (when neces-
sary) and studious and admired by all.

Emil K. Geyser A I‘ <1)

Pittsburgh, Pa.

Executive Committee, Evening School

Association.

Yes, Emil is still with us—and we
hope to have him for a long time, too.
Industrious, studious, responsive. a. will-
ing worker and a booster for the Even-

ing School. And, oh, yes, you must ask
Emil about the little valley town of
Beaver Falls! He thinks it’s just a de-
lightful spot——and judging from some of
its products (no, we’re not mentioning
any names, but one’s tall and the other
isn’t so tall) we’re inclined to concur.

Arthur Gluck
Wilmerding, Pa.

Member, Evening School Association

That’s Arthur with that apple-blos-
som complexion and a nicer boy never
listened with keener interest to the
“propoundings” of Joe Conrad. Always
a willing helper in anything to be done
about school and we hope that just be-
cause he’s graduating this year he won’t
consider that he knows enough and not
be listed among the “post-grads.” next
year. Good luck to you, Arthur.

Louis A. Komjathy
Homestead, Pa.

Member, Evening School Association

Louis is known to all of us and liked
by all. “Perservance unto the end” is
his motto and he sure does plug in his
studies all of the time. He’s known
especially for his ability as an artist and
as an orator and the school has bene-
ﬁtted by his untiring interest in its wel-
fare and activities. We know the light
is shining ahead for Louis and that a
successful career awaits him.

Earl F. Leo
Pittsburgh, Pa.

Member, Evening School Association

Another good fellow and a booster
for Pitt Evening School. Always in
class; studious in his work and inter-
ested and helpful in all School activities.
We envy him being a Senior this year,
but he deserves it, for he’s worked hard
and is now “reaping what he sowed.”
Earl will leave fond memories with the
school for he’s been a credit to it and
a pleasant companion to us all.

Charles W. Lunk

Pittsburgh, Pa.

Member, Evening School Association

It is difficult to describe Charlie and
not repeat what we’ve said about so
many “good fellows.” Charlie is all of
that—and more. A fertile mind, keenly
interested in everything for the good of

112

the school; busy all the time and never
without a bright c ountenance and a
smile. Charlie has been seen to leave
a little early on Wednesday evenings of
late and We’re going to scrutinize the
papers carefully along in June. Success
to you, Charlie, for you’re deserving of
it, and we hope Doctor White will have
a further advanced Psychology class
next year to bring you back.

John K. Matthews A K ‘If
Pittsburgh, Pa.

Member, Evening School Association

John is one of the “old guard” and
we shall miss his always helpful and
guiding counsel. We have all bene-
ﬁtted by our association with John and
the school is fortunate in having such
a man. Conservative always, but with
consistent pep and push to bring him
out on top every time.

Glenn S. Miller

Pittsburgh, Pa.

Member, Evening School Association

One of those big, broad ‘(literally and
ﬁguratively) minded fellows with a glad
hand and a smile for every one. Busy?
You bet he is, but always ﬁnds time to
attend school and take part in every-
thing going on. We feel he is beneﬁt-

ting by Doctor White’s course on “The -

Executive and his Control of Men” for
Glenn surely has the makings of an ex-
ecutive—a real one, with sympat_hy and
consideration for others.

Thomas E. Sweeney
Pittsburgh, Pa. _
Member, Evening School Association
Experience and success are only by
industry achieved and for this reason
we believe Thomas is a coming leader,
for he sure is industrious. No, we

wouldn’t just call him a book worm,‘

nor one of those queer folk, but a real
fellow, bright and happy all of the
time, and ever ready and willing and
anxious to do some good for some one.
That’s Thomas.

Otakichi Tanaka

Nagasaki, Japan

One of our neighbors from across
“the way.”’ Doesn't say much, but is
always listening and when you can get
him to talk, he’s the most entertaining
boy around. Perservering, you ask?

You’d think he was if you knew he at-
tends both day and evening school,
wouldn’t you? Well, he does, and is
just as big a booster for the Evening
School as any member of it. We’re
proud to have him with us and happy
that he picked Pitt to come to.

G. R. Voltz

Pittsburgh, Pa.

Member, Evening School Association

Voltz is another plugger; in fact, we
have nothing but that kind in the Even-
ing School. Voltz is a ﬁne example of
a real man and a friendly fellow stu-
dent. Interested in everything and al-
ways with a helping hand.

G. E. Wadsworth

Pittsburgh, Pa.

Member, Evening School Association

A man among men; always depend-
able and efficient and a good example
to follow. Wadsworth never fails to
make a favorable impression——on the
ladies too it is said—and We’re sort of
sorry in a way to have him graduate
this year. ‘

Edwin L. Resler A K 111
Pittsburgh, Pa.

President, Evening School Associa-
tion; Chairman, Executive Commit-
tee, E. S. A.

All hail to Ed.! Strong of mind and
body, with a big heart, a cheerful word
and a smile for every one. An able
executive and untiring worker for the
Evening School. Hat’s off to our
Leader who has so sucessfully piloted
the Evening School through the most
ﬂourishing year of its existence! No,
this isn’t ﬂattery. Ask Dean Wright
and members of the faculty what they
think of the results of the Evening
School during the past year and see if
they don’t corroborate what we say.
And its all due to our leader, Ed.

J. E. Wilson

Pittsburgh, Pa.

Member, Evening School Association

We’re proud to claim Wilson as a
member of the Evening School for he’s
sure a credit to it. Everybody’s friend,
slight1y—no, we'll say, conservatively
modest, but isn’t that a virtue in a man?

Ethlyn Brown A Z

Pittsburgh, Pa.

Pitkin Club; Glee Club.

She has red hair, but she doesn’t
have the temper. She is most agree-
able. always willing to accommodate
anybody. She is a ﬁne student and is
one of the intellectual co—eds of the
University. Music is her particular
talent.

Margaret Colcord K A G) <1) E
Pittsburgh, Pa.

Student Senate; Pitkin Club; W. A.

A. (1) (2) (3); W. C. A. (2) (3);

Glee Club (2) (3); Glee Club Mgr.

(3); Woodbee; Music Club.

“Woman, thou fair defect of nature”,
was not said of Margaret. The ele-
ments of gentleness and kindness are
so mixed that she remains an idol, to
be idealized by the poet in his immortal
verse.

Jennie Cook

Pittsburgh, Pa.

Owl Staff

Her hobby is art and her side-lines
are dancing and dark-haired men. She
comes to us from another school, which
marks a gain for Pitt. We hope to
know her better.

Emma Coombs

Monaca, Pa.

Y. W. C. A.; Woodbee; Vocational

Information Committee.

We would like to say something nice
or cute about you, but we do not _know
you. If you ever have occasion to be a.
Junior again, cultivate the members of
the Owl staff by all means.

John A. Coyle

Pittsburgh, Pa.

Here is one of the cases where
quantity and quality are combined, at
least as regards height. Has the habit
of persuading you that his side of the
argument is right. An A-1 student.

Helen Detweiler

Oakmont, Pa.

A ﬁrm believer in the theory that, “a.
still tongue makes a wise head.” A
credit to the University any Way you
take her. There cannot be too many
girls such as Helen. To know her is to
want to know her better.

1921

.THe0wI

Marguerite May Graver K A
Pittsburgh, Pa.

This Kappa Delt is one of the quiet
and studious kind. She doesn’t say
much, but when exams. come around,
she looks as unruffled as ever, and
there’s plenty of reason for it. A’s
seem to gravitate toward her.

Mildred Harry Z T A

McKeesport, Pa.

Senate; Framasor; Woodbee.

She wears an insignia showing her
fondness for red hair. Her business
inclinations run toward gas wells. We

wish her success and hope that her gas
wells come in wet.

Lesley E. Hastings

Pittsburgh, Pa.

Y. W. C. A. Cabinet

Her middle initial stands for eﬂi-
ciency. A wonder as a committee
member for no committee is complete
without her. She has a. way of getting
A’s which we don't understand.

Genevieve Edwards, “Jean”
Duquesne, Pa.

W. A. A.; Y. W. C. A.; W. L. A.;
Pitkin Club; Glee Club (1) (2) (3);
Glee Club Director (3); Woodbee;
Literary Club; Ukelele Club.
Her countenance serene, benign,
Who would have courage to malign,
With all her learning, not too_shrewd,
To be by lesser minds oft W0o’d
To give good helpful suggestions too,
And tablets neat to favored few.

Gladys Freed
Pittsburgh, Pa.

One of the pleasing plump members
of our class. She has literary ambitions
but in spite of her sober countenance
we think that if you read the next few
issues of “Snappy Stories” you’ll be
surprised.

Grace Frech <I> E
Pittsburgh, Pa.

Y. W. C. A. (1) (2) (3); W. A. A.
(1) (2) (3); Glee Club (1) (2)
(3); Pitkin Club.

She sings better than a sparrow and
is as original as the “57”. Likes
pickles and conversation. Genial, warm-
hearted, loyal, and helpful to the Nth
degree.

The Owl

Hannah Kelley
Pittsburgh, Pa.

Y. W. C. A.; W. A. A. Literary Club
(2); Beaver College.

We would suggest that she investi-
gate the merits of a class offered
Wednesday afternoons in the Educa-
tional Gymnasium for its value educa-
tionally and otherwise, almost wholly
otherwise.

Mary Kelso II B <1)
Dravosburg, Pa.
With smile so winning,
And eyes so lovely,
We just don’t wonder
At his (?) devotion.

Don’t worry Mary, for we all approve
of him—especially since he comes from
the Medical School.

Louise Kennedy A Z <I> E
Pittsburgh, Pa.

Glee Club; W. A. A.; Pitkin Club;
Y. W. C. A.; Executive Committee;

She is clever at anything she under-
takes but particularly clever at juggling
sharps and ﬂats. She knows all the
notes on a piano and then some.

Clarence Klein T A 6)
Pittsburgh, Pa.

One of the shining lights of the
School of Education. He doesn’t have
much competition, it is true, but never-
theless, he deserves credit.

Sara T. Leonard
Library, Pa.

With a home like hers she certainly
ought to be able to show us the way
in classes and exams., and she certainly
does, too. She isn’t on speaking terms
with C’s and D’s ‘at all.

Helen Levy X 1" 8 (I) E
Pittsburgh, Pa.

Orchestra (1) (2); W. ‘T’. A.; Glee
Club (1) (2) (3); W. A. A.

We will someday read of her in the
weekly columns under “Pitt Families."
We forget just how many have gone
before her, but we know it is enough
to make a record.

Lillian Licker
Sharpsburg, Pa.

Since prohibition there has been a
steady migration of Pitt students to
Sharpsburg. “What’s in the name?”

Marion Lindbon 1'1 B <1) <1) E
McKeesport, Pa.
Orchestra; Glee Club; Y. W. C. A.

She tries to hide her many virtues in
the obscurity of East McKeesport, but
even this handicap is insuﬂicient for her
purpose. We understand that the Me-
Keesport gas boom has destroyed the
erstwhile exclusiveness (?) of that great
metropolis.

Elizabeth Matthews X 9
Pittsburgh, Pa.

Pitt Weekly Staff (2) (3); Associate
Editor (3); Pitt Review Staff (3);
Student Senate (3); Scholarship
Committee (3); Debating Club (2);
Y. W. C. A.; W. A. A.

She has a wonderful start in life and
we predict for her something unusual
such as ﬁrst lady mayor, or chancellor,
or something.

Mary V. Millar II B (1)
Pittsburgh, Pa.

We think “V” stands for vivacious-
ness. Although appearing quiet and
studious about the halls of learning, she
has a wonderfully large amount of pep
for all social activities.

Anna McE1heny A A H
Pittsburgh, Pa.

This maid with such accomplishments
is blessed,

That when they’re measured do outstrip -
the rest.

Anna Grace Lewis
Avalon, Pa.

Oh, yes, we know her. She explores
the ways and by-ways of our campus
with the tots from the school of child-
hood.

Margaret Richards Z T A
Pittsburgh, Pa.

Ukelele Club; Woodbee; Turtle Club;
W. A. A.; Y. W. C. A.

Too bad that the picture does not
show that combination of red hair and
the brown eyes with _the “come hither”
in them. If we were gifted with them
We would be tempted to become a
vampire.

Ruth McFar1an
Pittsburgh, Pa.

She is noted for her happy smile,
which she bestows generously. Some-
how or other we always feel better after
having spoken to her.

Agnes McNeil]
Dormont, Pa.

Hails from the wild town of Dormont,
This is not sarcasm. If you don’t be-
lieve us take a, trip out, or ask dad, he
knows.

Myrtle Jane Wilson
Wilkinsburg, Pa.
Turtle Club

Who’s the tall, light-haired girl, with
the bewitching smiles and the dimples?

Everyone who has seen her, knows at
once.

Edwarda. Hays Pickett
Pittsburgh, Pa.

She’s been ﬁghting bravely on against
all sorts of difficu1ties,——sickness, and
other troubles, too, but she is overcom-
ing all her obstacles, and next year ex-
pects to blossom forth in a cap and gown
with the other twenty-ones.

Florence L. Racy
Pittsburgh, Pa.

Florence has been unclassiﬁed for a
long time, but she ﬁnally decided that
she ought to honor us with her photo
before she left. She will be graduat-
ing before long, for she has been work-
ing along steadily, and is approaching
her goal at last.

7heOwl

Katherine M. Saunders
Pittsburgh, Pa.
Owl Staff; Asst. Mgr. Girl's Basket-

ball Team; W. A. A.; Scholarship
Committee.

Katherine is the courageous young
lady who looks after that troop of wild
animals known as the Freshmen Basket-
ball Team. When she is not thus en-
gaged, she.is singing ragtime. She
knows every piece a week before it is
published.

Laura Schafer
Pittsburgh, Pa.
Basketball (1) (2) (3); Basketball
Mgr. (3); VV. A. A.; Y. W. C. A.
“Where’s Ann?” “Who saw L.u’s
gym shoes?” “Here comes the train."
“Are we all here?” Laura hopes so,
but she's never quite sure. They are
certainly a responsibility, that basket-

ball team. Worse than a dozen schools
of childhood.

Jennie Sniderman X I‘ 6)
Pittsburgh, Pa.

At dance and game and party doth she
“shine”,

Hence doth she earn her nickname,
“joyous”, “ﬁne.”

Helen Snyder K A
Pittsburgh, Pa.
We falter here—we would like to do

our Helen justice. One of the best
all-round co-eds in school.

Samuel Wagner

Philadelphia, Pa.

Carnegie T‘ech.

Pitt Band; Orchestra; Panther; New-

man Club.

Is following closely in the footsteps
of the Wagner, famous in musical
history.

Edith Weaver
Pittsburgh, Pa.

She is most fair and thereunto her
life doth rightly harmonize.

If you want him, look for him in the
office. When he isn’t in class, you may
ﬁnd him there, keeping things in shape
in the School of Education.

Alice Westwood K A
Pittsburgh, Pa.

They say that she has been delicate
since early childhood and that the
family doctor predicts that she might
not ﬁnish school, but we have it from a
reliable source that she might fool them.

Letitia Wilson
Pittsburgh, Pa.
She has many charms, her most

notable ones being freckles and a Win-
ning smile that never wears out.

EDUCATION

Chester Carter
Pittsburgh, Pa.

“I dare do all that may become a man,
Who dares do more is none.”

Mary Cook
Beaver, Pa.
“He who works earnestly accom-

plishes much. A precious piece of
humanity.”

Elnora Felix
Pittsburgh, Pa.

“I remembered her well and I re-
membered her worthy of thy praise.”

Emma Evans
Pittsburgh, Pa.

“Made up of quickest sympathies,
Of kindliness and truth.”

Sophia Fingeret, “Sophy”

Pittsburgh, Pa.

Sophy is a good sport and a ﬁne
student. She knows all sorts of things.
It is even hinted that she once learned
the binomial theorom. If this is true

and we presume it is, she certainly has
our respect.

Giovnni Giardini T A E)

New Castle, Pa.

The marvel of the man who never
tells other people his troubles. A
particularly quiet youth who says very
little, but accomplishes much.

Mabel Hazlett

Springdale, Pa.

She shows you how a great woman
should act. And there is a. smile,
brightness pressed down and runniiig
over.

Lucy McCarty
Pittsburgh, Pa.
Her voice was ever soft, gentle and
low.
Edna Schlegel
Pittsburgh, Pa.
Studious, practical and congenial.
The sort of girl who deserves to
succeed and who will succeed.
Chester Smith T A 6
Pittsburgh, Pa.

The man with clogging feet. If you
wish to be entertained just ask “Chet”
to dance, “buck and Wing.”

Pearl Wagner
Pittsburgh, Pa.
“A merry heart maketh a cheerful
countenance.”
Myrtle Wilson
Pittsburgh, Pa.

Varsity Basketball (1) (2); Ukelele

Club; Turtle Club.

Who bids fair to eclipse her brother’s
fame as a basketball star, if her slight
physique stands the strain.

Carl Neher
Pittsburgh, Pa.
Carl, a piano you may be able to play,
But, a French horn never and never a
day;
In life you started to be a preacher,

But now, thank heaven, you'll be a.
teacher.

Mildred Reese
Pittsburgh, Pa.

She makes herself agreeable to all by
her pleasing manner and earnest solici-
tude for your welfare.

EDUCATION

Rose Brown H B <1)

Swissvale, Pa.

Rose is a clever little lady who knows
how to have a good time, and be a good
student, too. It's a combination that
can’t be beat. Tell us the secret, Rose?

Jane Bryce
Pittsburgh, Pa.

Jane started her college career at
Margaret Morrison, but saw her mistake
in time. We are glad both for her sake
and our own that she transferred her
allegiance to the Panther. That jolly
old animal appreciates girls like Jane.

Annie Cameron
Pittsburgh, Pa.

When Annie leaves Pitt she will take
so much knowledge away with her that
there just won’t be any left for the rest
of us. But more than that she will
take with her the hearty good wishes
of all her fellow class mates, for Annie’s
cheery smile has made her many friends.

Della Copp

Granville, Ohio

Miss Copp tells us that she is going to
be a really truly teacher next year. We
are going to miss her here at Pitt, but
we feel that some other school will
gain by our loss. Some compensation,
as our friend Emerson says.

Augusta Burdorf, “Pudge" K A (E)
Fullerton, California
“Pudge” is our idea of an all-around
athlete. They say she is a digniﬁed
senior, but if we didn’t know that they

always speak the truth we would say
that she was a roly-poly freshman.
But then we can both agree that
she is a ﬁne girl, and one whom we
will certainly miss.

Lillian Bowes H A 6)
Pittsburgh, Pa.

Owl Staff (2) (3); Panhellenic
Board (3) (4); W. A. A., Y. W. C. A.
‘Committee (1) (2)

Everybody knows Lil, so what’s the
use of our racking our poor tired brain
to try to tell you how much we like her.
Lil is a regular fellow and mighty popu-
lar, and she ﬁnds time to be a regular
student.

Dorothea Brinker, “Dot” Z T A
Pittsburgh, Pa.

We think we have symptoms of poeti-
tis, so we are going to practice on Dot.
We hope she will excuse us.

Here’s a little lady with eyes of baby
blue,

Her hair is gold and curly, she has a
dimple, too,

She can potter pottery and tinker trin-
kets ﬁne

And she can drive her own machine and
dance most any time.

Margaret Brooks,
Pittsburgh, Pa.

There was a young lady named Brooks,
Who was famed far and wide for her
looks;

When asked her vocation

She said education——

We take it she studies her books.

Lois Cranston A A H
Pittsburgh, Pa.

Senate (3) (4); Y. .W. C. A. W. A. A.

Miss Cranston is one of our tall and
digniﬁed seniors; not too digniﬁed
when it comes to having a good time.
However this time next year she will be
teaching the young idea the mysteries
of math. We wish her luck.

Lillie Cupp

Mars, Pa.

Pitt is the most representative school
in the country. We always thought so,
and now we have proof. Here is a
young lady come all the Way from Mars
to go to school with us. We suspect
we have students from other planets,
too, possibly from Venus.

Ruth Douthitt, “Rufus” A E A

Pittsburgh, Pa.

Girls’ Glee Club (1) (2) (3) (4);

Y. W. ‘C. A.; Classical Club; W. A. A.

When “Rufus” starts to teach next
year if she ﬁnds her pupils won’t speak
French she'll just make them sing it
instead. But singing isn't the only
thing “Rufus” can do; in fact, we can’t
think of anything just now that she
can’t do.

Bernard Drass T A 9 ‘I3 A K

Hollidaysburg, Pa.

Newman Club.

Ain’t it awful when there are so few
men in the School of Education that
one of them should go and graduate? It
sort of reminds us of the old ballad of
the ten little nigger boys.

Henrietta Frietley A A II

Pittsburgh, Pa.

There is a lot of determination in
Henrietta, which, mixed with a sunny
disposition, will assure her of getting
whatever she goes after, and of making
many friends on the way.

Laura Fruchs

Pittsburgh, Pa.

W. A. A.; Menorah Society; Classical

Club.

We will be sorry to lose you, Laura,
for one doesn’t often ﬁnd such pretty
brown eyes capable of absorbing so
much useful information. We think
that you will make a ﬁne teacher and if

1921

we weren’t too busy we would certainly
like to be one of your pupils next year.

Clarence Goode T A (-3

McKeesport, Pa.

International Polity Club, Americani-

zation -Committee.

We don’t know you very well, but
your name sounds attractive. We hope
you will live up to it.

Emma Herriott

Pittsburgh, Pa.

We understand that Miss Herriott is
anxiously awaiting an opportunity to
drop a really truly ballot into a really
truly ballot box. We think she will
soon have the opportunity.

Hildegarde Ivory, “Hildy” X 9

Pittsburgh, Pa.

Pitt Review (4); Literary Club (3);

Woodbee’s (4); Panhellenic, W. A. A.

Y. W. C. A.

Hildy is a cheerful little lady who
can get through a surprising amount of
work without seeming to exert herself
or to disturb that omnipresent smile.

Eleanor Johnson
Pittsburgh, Pa.

A maiden named Eleanor Johnson

(We hope she won’t think this a swan
song)

In a very rash ﬁt

Graduated from Pitt

Now she’s known as the ‘pedagogue
Johnson’

Margaret King, “Peg”

Pittsburgh, Pa.

If there are any good times going on
Peg will be there, you can bet your last
penny. And you won’t lose it either.
We prophecy that Miss King will be
as popular a teacher as she has been a
student.

Johnnie’1l be a teacher, and then, says
he, ‘You’ll see

Anna Laufe

Pittsburgh, Pa.

What Anne doesn’t know about
music just naturally isn’t worth know-
ing. We don’t know anyone who can
simultaneously eat Y. W. chocolate and

play the piano with as much ease and
grace as Anna.

Elizabeth Lederidge

Pittsburgh, Pa.

Elizabeth is the kind of girl that the
School of Education can be justly proud
of. We foresee a most successful fu-

ture for her, and wish her good luck in
her career.

Mabel Love A E A

We would have to call her “Love” and
Then everybody would think we

Oh, a sensible girl was Miss Marvin.

Elizabeth Matheny A A II

Westminister College

We are told that Elizabeth can juggle

math problems. We know that she can
juggle charcoal and paint around and
evolve a beautiful picture. We suspect
that she is a very clever young lady, and
very popular, too.

Irene Mechling

So far as we know, Ethel has never
lived up to her name, unless_she robs
the library of some of its knowledge.
We could all do a little more of that
style of robbing.

Elizabeth Rohrkaste, “Betsy”
Pittsburgh, Pa.
P. E. P., Y. W. C. A., W.__A. A.
First in jollity, first in sobriety, and
ﬁrst in the hearts of her classmates.

Mary F. Ross
Grafton, Pa.

Now Mary Ross, please don't be cross,

You know this verse might be still
worse,

But it will do to say to you,

We’re sad to see your school days
through

And sorry you must leave us, too,

We wish you joy, whate’er you do.

Helen Simmern
Pittsburgh, Pa.

Too bad We don’t know you better,
Helen. ‘Come back some time when
you feel the need of a few extra de-
grees, and we'll try to get better ac-
quainted.

Esther Sproul
McKees Rocks, Pa.

Ethel is a real student, but not too
much so to be a real friend, too.

Lois Taylor
Oakmont, Pa.

Oakmont isn’t a very big city, but
some big people have come from it.
(We refer to mental size, particularly).

Hazel Thompson

Pittsburgh, Pa.

Hazel has a sunny disposition and
lots of pep, and is an earnest and ambi-
tious scientist besides.

Elmer Thumm T A G) <1) A K

Pittsburgh, Pa.

Student Senate (4); International

Polity Club.

He knows what he knows, and if he
doesn’t know he thinks he does, which
is just as satisfactory from his point of
view, anyway.

Caroline Welch, “Kewpie” K K I‘
Pittsburgh, Pa.

Caroline came to us from the wild
and wooly west. If all the girls out
there are like you, Caroline, we think
we’ll take our tent with us and settle
down somewhere near the Rockies for
the rest of our lives, or a week or two,
anyway.

Anna Wilson
Pittsburgh, Pa.

We don’t know anything bad about
her, and are afraid to say too many
good things for fear she might mistake
our meaning and think that we were
in need of some “long green”.

Henry W. Busch (Heinie)

Uniontown, Pa.

Chemical Engineering

This “Busch” was raised in Union-
town and is endeavoring to pluck some
fruit from the Tree of Knowledge in
order to return to the town and raise
its standards. We hope he succeeds" in
giving it a more prominent place on the
maps.

John F. Casey, Jr.

Shadyside Academy

Civil Engineering; Student Senate

(3); Cap and Gown (1) (2) (3)

Do you not remember that cute little
girl in the Cap and Gown show last
year? Well that is our own Jack. His
one fault is that he tries his winsome
ways on the faculty instead of keeping
them entirely to the stage.

N. J. Cannon E) X

Vvestinghouse High School

Mechanical Engineering

Who said heavy artillery? Well that
is what Cannon reminds one of, es-
pecially when his forty-eight caliber
brain gets going.

E. P. Denigan A E (1)

Warren, Pa.

Mechanical Engineering

A jolly, good fellow, who tries to
establish himself in the good graces of
the Co-eds; and not without a. large
measure of success. We do not know
so much about his engineering ability,
but assume that “Ed” takes care of that
_before he goes out “fussing”.

A. E. Diggles, “Al” A T A A X E

Johnstown, Pa.

Chemical Engineering; Hi-Kockey

Club.

“Al” thinks he will make a good
chemical engineer. There are several
Junior Civils who doubt this very much.
They do give him full credit for having
an awful ‘‘line’’ of air.

Richard E. Donnelly A T A
Bellevue High School
Mechanical Engineering; Varsity
Football (2); Freshman Basketball;
Fraternity Basketball; Cap & Gown
(3); Glee Club (3); Hi-Kockey Club.
“Dick” would make a good “bunko”
man with his smooth line of chatter.
We think he could get away with it, if
people would not add a grain or two of
salt to his tales.

Joseph Emerson Heckel E K [I

Allegheny High School

Mechanical Engineering; University

Band (1) (3); Cap & Gown (3);

Lock & Key.

A big bluff from the North Side. He
has developed rapidly in this line and
can now hold his own with anyone in
the class. He has been seen quite
often frequenting State Hall and adja-
cent territory which is no place for a
hard working engineer.

William E. Marshall, “Win”

Schenley High School

Civil Engineering; 'Vice-President C.

E. Society; C. H. C.

“Win” was unfortunate enough to
have been at Tech for a year, but he has
successfully gotten over any bad habits,
formed there and has stepped right in
as one of the bunch.

Frank S. Masley

Homestead, Pa.

Civil Engineering; C. H. C.; Fresh-

man Football & Basketball; Varsity

Football & Basketball (2) (3);

Junior Prom. Committee.

“Mas" hails from the renowned town
of Homestead, which is no crime. It is
whispered about that he is a regular
lady-killer and ranks high in the realms
of the Terpsichorean art.

Charles J. Eisaman (I) A (-3

Saltsburg, Pa.

Mechanical Engineering

‘The chap with a sense of humor,
especially when the joke is on him. His
intentions are also good, but they don’t
mean anything. He is a strong cham-
pion of the Mechanicals and does not
like to hear of them being abused.

W. Kaye Estep (D A E)

South High School

Mechanical Engineering;

Clubs (1) (3)

Our old reliable, a man you can de-
pend upon. It is poor policy to get
into an argument with Kaye unless you
are sure of your ground.

George K. Harsh

Washington, Pa.

Mechanical Engineering

A good sensible fellow; quiet, but not
too quiet. He has one fault or shall we
call it a good point,—he likes the girls,
but seldom tells them so.

Ingram, Pa.

Mechanical Engineering; Musical

Club (1) (3); Varsity Manager

Basketball (3); Druids.

Here he is, that talented genius from
Ingram, so well known as a “spoofer”.
A good scholar and a handy man to
have around. Leave it to “Ken” to
make a hit with the ladies.

Wallace H. McCurdy

Ingram, Pa.

Electrical Engineering

A quiet fellow. Not like his brother
“Ken”. He takes his studies seriously
and is a good student. He bears no
grudges and is well liked by all. He
realizes he must uphold the dignity of
the McCurdy family and tries to over-
come “Ken’s” deﬁciencies.

Lee Pendleton 6 X

Little Meadows, Pa.

Electrical Engineering

This is Leap Year, Lee. Look out, or
some member of the fair sex will grab
you. A quiet fellow, but if he ever
wakes up—.

Paul G. Ross A 2 <1)

Waynesburg, Pa.

Civil Engineering; Freshman Basket-

ball; C. H. C.

He does not talk unless he has some-
thing to say. He can not see how danc-
ing improves his looks any, so he does
not go to many. Still he seems to stand
in well with the girls.

Daniel Stepanovich, “Dan”

Mingo Junction, Ohio.

Civil Engineering; C. H. 0.

“Dan” the Mingo Junction “kid”.
This is the boy who put the place on the
map. Before he came nobody knew
anything about the town. Now, due to
good press agenting, we all do. If
perseverance gets anyone anywhere, Dan
will get there.

A. K. Van Tine

Pittsburgh, Pa.

Vice President Pitkin Club; 'Vice-

President Y. M. C. A.; President

We really do not know what to say
about “Van”. He is a quiet chap, and
very easy to get along with. Once a
friend of his, always a friend. His
personality speaks for him.

“Harold” a favorite once in a while

the success of the Carnegie Steel Co.
A good student and, because of his
genial good nature, much liked by his
classmates. For further information,
see “Pike” Young. _

Paul H. Young, “Pike” 8 X

Evans City, Pa.

Civil Engineering; Student Senate

(3); C. H. C.

The whistling kid alias “Canary”.
He has developed a habit of giving vent
to his feelings by whistling, when he
thinks a professor has given too large
an assignment. He also holds the
Camp Hamilton Length & Frequency
Letter Writing Championship. We must
say, however, that they do not detract
from his popularity.

Robert Zimmers, “Zimmie” A X 2

Altoona, Pa.

Chemical Engineering

We would not be surprised to hear
some day of “Zimmie’s” sudden rise in
the world, due to his ability as a chemi-
cal engineer in mixing high explosives.
His gassing is mighty powerful now. It
certainly is a shame and he so young
and fair.

Donald R. Whitehead, “Pony” (1) A E)

Schenley High School

Civil Engineering; C. H. C.

The joke factory for the C. E.’s. His
production capacity in that respect is
only equal to his consumption capacity
for tea. A regular tea-hound. Work
and “Pony” are second cousins, but they
only speak to each other once in a great
while.

Be that as it may we do not hold that
against him.

J. M. Daniels <1) A (-3

Freeport, Pa.

Civil Engineering; Univ. of Pennsyl-

vania; Student Senate (2); Varsity

“Deac” has an outward appearance of
being very quiet. That is only skin
deep, however, so don’t get him started.
He spends his time, whenever he can
not help himself, in studying; otherwise
he is either chasing trains or Co-eds.

Harold R. Henry
Zelienople, Pa.

Electrical Engineering

Always quiet, cheerful and possessing
a genial disposition. His good-fellow-
ship must have come through living
among the evergreeens. We do not
know what affect the moving to Zelien—
ople will have upon him.

John M. Marshall, “Jack"

Schenley High School

Civil Engineering

Jack, now and then, has an outburst
of wit, which is, strange to say, actually
funny. This tendency is probably due
to water on the brain contracted from
the effect of so much canoeing in his
youth. Notice we give him the beneﬁt

of the doubt and concede that he has
brains.

Charles Wesley Merrit, “Wes” G) X

A regular Beau-Brummel. We wonder
where he gets his variety of girls. But
on second thought that isn’t hard to see.
He has a special liking for State Hall
and can be found there most any time
working his “wiles”.

Warren W. Miller

Mt. Lebanon, Pa.

Electrical Engineering

We can’t make him out, but We are
sure of one thing. He is noted for his
bluﬂing in class. You see we have never
caught him working.

William H. Raring

Crafton High School

Electrical Engineering

Leave it to Raring, he always has an
answer for everything. We wouldn’t
like to detract from his ability in this
line, but they are seldom just exactly
what is wanted at that time. To hear
him, would be to classify him as one of
the Who’s Who of the metropolis of
Crafton.

Carl Reisman (I) E 11

Pittsburgh, Pa.

Mechanical Engineering

A good student and a hard Worker,
when he works. One thing We hold
against him is that it took him a while
to ﬁnd out the advantages to be obtained
at Pitt; he wasted energy for a time at
C. I. T. We give him credit for break-
ing away from there before it was too
late.

H. Q. Taylor

Harry is noted for his swimming. He
does not conﬁne that activity to water

I. B. is one of our most respected

bigger than a good-sized pup. He is
quite a musician, for he can stand on a
drawing bench and make the light bulbs
overhead sound like a three-piece or-
chestra.

Charles J. Callaghan, “Cal"

VVilbur M. Culver, “Curley”

A serious minded member of the

A great bull-dozer and likes to fool the

Dick makes some queer jumps in

“Girlie” is a railway mechanical, a

Alumni Activities

HE present collegiate year has been a most momentuous one in the history

I of the University, from the standpoint of Alumni activities. This Was, of
course, largely due to the impetus given by the Alumni Building Campaign.

Not only was suﬂicient money raised from the graduates to ﬁnance another ﬁne build-
ing on the Schenley Farms campus, but the movement awakened an interest among
the Pittites that had never before been attained. It all went to show that an
alumnus who is giving and sacriﬁcing, if need be, for his Alma Mater, is the 100
percent loyal “grad”. The fact that about 2500 subscriptions were received from

the Pitt Alumni and students for the Campaign, proved beyond a doubt that they
are back of their school.

The Campaign was directed from Alumni Headquarters, with Carlton G. Ket-
chum, ’16, J. Steele Gow, ’16, and the Alumni Secretary in charge. Alumni Council
acted as the Executive Committee for the Campaign, with C01. Joseph H. Thomp-
son, '05, President of the General Alumni Association, as Chairman. Frequent
meetings were held before and during the progress of the drive, and these all
helped to add “pep” into the movement and put it across.

The Campaign was the culmination of a. movement which started in earnest
four or ﬁve years ago to get the Alumni of Pitt closer to their school, and to en-
able them to ﬁnally prove this loyalty in a real concrete way. First, all efforts
were concentrated toward getting the membership list of the General Alumni As-
sociation up to a respectable ﬁgure, and by consistent hammering, this mounted
from several hundred to about 3,000—the present membership‘. With all these
3,000 Alumni getting the “Pitt Weekly”, and thereby keeping in close touch with

the University, and being fully informed of her plans and needs, the interest soon
became intense.

 

Athletics Helps

Athletic activities also undoubtedly played an important part in awakening the
enthusiasm of the graduate body. At the big football games thousands of Alumni
came back to see the Varsity perform. This caused them to talk and think Pitt.
The result was that when the call ﬁnally came for ﬁnancial aid, and the proposi-
tion was placed before them in a clean-cut business-like manner, they responded
liberally. Alumni Hall, which will be ready for occupancy next Fall, is the monu-
ment which the “grads” are erecting for all time on the Schenley Farms campus.
And it is a monument that all Pittites will ever be proud of.

The coming of peace, and the return of thousands of service men to their
native country, brought back several thousand of the Pittites who had left their
homes to “do their bit” for Uncle Sam. Many of the “grads” returned to their
old pursuits, while the careers of others were changed entirely by the experience.
But gradually things are shaping themselves back to normal. It was noteworthy
that a large majority of the service men, on returning to Pittsburgh, hunted up
Alumni headquarters immediately on arrival.

During the year the Alumni continued their usual routine activities for the
betterment of Pitt affairs. Each issue of the “Pitt Weekly” contained a full page
of Alumni news, and the 3,000 members read every line of it. The various Pitt
clubs held meetings, and a number of new clubs were formed during the Campaign.
Aid was given the undergraduates in the supervision of their activities, with the
usual Alumni representatives on the Student Activity Board, Athletic Council, and
Student Publication Board.

Commencement Banquet

The 1919 Commencement Banquet was a splendid affair, with the largest at-
tendance on record present. Charles A. Locke, '97, of the “Old Guard”, was toast-
master. Lieut. William H. Allen, Jr., ’15, who had recently returned from France
with a wonderful war record, was one of the speakers. During the Commence-
ment exercises Thomas Bakewell Kerr, '67, was given the degree of LLD., and
William Johnston, '91, was the recipient of the Litt.D. degree.

Two well known “Old Grads" were called to the Great Beyond during the
year, both being members of the class of 1867—Thomas Bakewell Kerr, of New
York, and Howard Dunlap, of Emporia, Kansas. Mr. Kerr was a well known patent
attorney and had been a prominent ﬁgure in the New York Pitt Club. He was
rightly called “Pitt’s Grand Old Man.” Mr. Dunlap was president of the Emporia
National Bank, and a leading business man in his community.

The oldest living graduate of Pitt is Rev. Dr. J. H. Mccandless, '64, of the
Northside, Pittsburgh, formerly of Smethport, Pa. Two members of the class of

’65 are 1iving——Rev. Dr. John Gordon, of Rensselearville, N. Y., and R. Herberton
Negley, of Pittsburgh.

The Owl

Edward H. Bohn, “Eddie” <1) 1‘ A A X 2
Norfolk, Va.

Norfolk High School
Student Senate (3); Student Chemi-
cal Society (1, 2); Owl Staff (2)

Here is good natured Bohn, better
known as Eddie. Even the profs call
him by his ﬁrst name. Eddie hails
from the sunny south where the people
are said to be more hospitable. Bohn
is very economical. When he goes to
the theatre he sits in the gallery to save
enough money to bet on the Pitt football
games.

Herbert Benedict Millhauser, “Milly”
Baltimore, Md. '
Baltimore City College
Pitt Weekly (1, 2); Student Chemical
Society (1, 2, 3); Owl Manager (3);
Owl Editor (3); Student Senate (3);
Menorah Society (1, 2, 3)

Can you see little Milly? Oh, yes, his
picture is larger than he. Although
Milly is short in stature he is going to
be a big man some day. He is indus-
trious and ambitious and incidentally
might mention that he is the only sur-
vivor of his original freshman class.
Milly is quite bashful among the ladies,
but nevertheless they all like him.

0. Kern Stewart, “Stew”
Lock and Key

McKeesport High School
Owl Staff (1, 3)

Can you see my upper lip? Look me
over and see if you can recognize me.
Yes, Stewart said that for a couple of
months. One thing that can’t be taken
away from “Stew”, though, is his school
spirit. He sure has a lot of that.

CHEMISTRY _

Harry Fraiberg, “Harry”
Pittsburgh, Pa.

Harry Fraiberg, the chemist of note,
Of whom this “pome” is wrote,

Is a bear in his qual,

Never misses at all,

Just ask, you’ll get his goat.

Fred Y. Herron, “Doc”

Odd Doc is still giving away advice.
\Vel1, you really can’t blame him. He
has to do something.

Russel L. Jenkins, “Jenks”

We have been told that “Jenks” is
now emulating the works of his famous
predecessor (Prof. Jenks). How about
it, “Frosh”?

Raymond F. Remler, “Romeo”
New Brighton, Pa.

If Remler weren’t so easily attracted
by the fair ones from the Heinz House,
he could get a lot more Work done.
Ray, more time on your work and less
on the window.

J. Charles Stilley, “Jay”

Option, Pa.

Stilley never confessed as to what the
“J” meant. We have a. good idea

though. You see, he hails from Option,
Pa.

Our Adonis. We could tell how he
carried the Prom, against overwhelm-
ing odds to a ﬁnancial victory, and how
he courageously refused to shake his
shoulders because the lady said they
weren’t doing it at all in New York, but
we won’t.

Charles T. Francis (I0 B H

Harold L. Mitchell (1) B H

Woodruff, Pa.

Rogersville High School

Class Vice-President (2); Class Pres-

questions on anything, anytime, and
anywhere.

Wendell Holmes Montgomery 2 A E

eloquence in crabbing.

J. Sanford Moyer N 2 N

he isat prognostication.

Clyde F. Peairs

Clyde says that all he hears at home
is “For goodness’ sake hurry up!” but

FACULTY AND SENIOR CLASS OF THE
SCHOOL OF LAW

Pitt Law School

The School of Law was organized in the month of October 1895, by eight
members of the Allegheny County bench and bar, as a branch of the W. U. P. The
faculty is now composed in part of professional law teachers who give their full time
to the work of the school, of judges from the Allegheny County Courts and of
lawyers in active practice.

The school endeavors to cultivate the power of legal reasoning, to impart a
broad and sound knowledge of the common law and to prepare, particularly for
practice in Pennsylvania. Graduates of the school have had an enviable record
of success in the State Board law examinations. The case-book method of instruc-
tion is used in nearly all of the courses except those which are distinctly pro-
ceedural.

The ﬁrst home of the law school was in the old University Building at the
corner of Ross & Diamond Streets, which was once used as the County Court House.
The ﬁrst nineteen years of its development took place in this building. In 1914
the location was changed to rooms in the Frick Building Annex where instruction
was given until 1918 when the school was moved back to the corner of Ross &
Diamond Streets in the old South School Building. The Law School is now located
in the Chamber of Commerce Building in the downtown section of Pittsburgh.

MIDDLE CLASS OF THE
SCHOOL OF LAW

The large number of courts in continuous session and the law offices which handle
all varieties of litigation and legal business, afford the student ample opportunity
to observe the actual routine of practice while carrying on his law course.

The school is in the center of the law quarter of the city and near the Allegheny
County Court House, where the Court of Common Pleas, the Orphans Court and
the County Court of Allegheny County are quartered and where the Supreme and
Superior Courts of the State meet each year. It is also near the Federal Building
where the District Court of the United States is held. The Law School is a member
of the Association of American Law Schools and all its rules and regulations are
to be read in harmony with the rules of that association. A great majority of the
law students not only attend the Law School but also spend a portion of each day in
some law office, and thereby become acquainted not only with the routine of the
practice of law, but also with the men with whom they will, in the future, associate
in the practice of law. Most Courts are held at frequent intervals under the aus-
pices of legal societies in the Law School, class organizations and the supervision
of the Faculty. There are two national legal Fraternities which have chapters at
Pitt:—Shiras Chapter of Phi Delta Phi and Gibson Senate of Delta Theta Phi.

Students who wish to enter the Law School must have completed at least three
years work at an approved college or university. In most cases however, those
entering the school have their college or university degree.

Alumni Hall

Pitt’s Big Achievement—ALUMNI HALL!

That more adequate class room space may be provided for the increasing
enrollment at Pitt, that a building may be available for use by all campus
schools in need of class-room facilities, that the student morale may be strengthened
and dissatisfaction with the present crowded conditions may be dissipated, that the
enrollment of ﬁrst-class students from all parts of the state and country may be
stimulated;—funds were raised among the Alumni and students for the erection
of Alumni Hall which is now being constructed on the lower campus of the Uni-
versity.

Between the years 1911 and 1919, there was an increase in enrollment of
2,778 students for whom there were scarcely any additional class-room facilities
of a permanent nature provided. This year qualiﬁed students with applications
had to be turned away, they being unable to enter the University on account of in-
adequate facilities as they exist at the present time. Alumni Hall which is now
being erected will relieve the situation, and in the future will take care of the
increasing enrollment. The prime purpose of such a building is to raise the stand-
ard of PITT, and in so doing make Pitt of invaluable service not only to the
community, but also to the state and country.

That such a building may be erected a campaign was planned for the raising
of funds among the Alumni and the students. The Alumni conducted the cam-
paign successfully through the Alumni Council, which set forth a purpose for its
work which was; to provide for the erection of a recitation building to be known
as Alumni Hall which will be available for use by all schools which need class

Samuel Hanna Sarraf, “Period”

Sarraf’s favorite expression is Period.
But to hear this bird talk, you wouldn’t
believe he knew what a period is. We
pity the poor jury when this one once
opens the guns on ’em.

Morris Schneirov
Pittsburgh, Pa.

There may be some things about the
lessons that Morris doesn’t know, but if
there are we never know it, Morris is
one man whom we are convinced has
found his vocation.

Harry G. Schwartz, “Senator”
Rankin, Pa.

Out on the campus last year we used
to call Harry, “Senator”. By gollies the
way he expounds the law, and knowing
his Weakness our predictions are likely
to come true yet.

Benjamin Sochatoff “Bennie”
Pittsburgh, Pa.

We would like to know Where Bennie
gets those awful weeds he smokes. We
don’t object to the use of tobacco but
We do object to that black rope variety
which Bennie uses.

John Cornelius Stern, A. B.

Stern surely must appreciate Pitt to
leave such a peach of a school as Michi-

We welcome and enjoy him as a friend

Meb started out on a jouralistic

make a success of anything she tried we
are glad she decided on law and look
forward as greeting her as one of our

Vergil Wesley Thomas, B.S. A 8 <I>

His parents just knew he was a. born
orator, so they named him Vergil. He
can argue by the yard. Most of the

Buck is as ﬁne a fellow as we have in

BREAKING GROUND FOR ALUMNI HALL

room facilities, and will greatly relieve the crowded conditions which exist on the
campus.

At an early meeting of the council, the plans for the campaign were discussed
and made clear. The plans for Alumni Hall were also brought up at the meet-
ing and endorsed by an enthusiastic and unanimous vote, pledging itself to give
every effort to the undertaking, serving as executive committee for the campaign
and endeavoring to line up every Pitt man in its support. As to the form of the
Campaign, it was decided, that it was to be quiet, personal, and strictly a family
matter, among the alumni themselves. They were to depend upon the Alumni and
the students alone for the success of Alumni Hall.

A committee was named for carrying on the campaign and consisted of the
following: General Chairman, Colonel Joseph H. Thompson; Executive Committee,
Alumni Council; Campaign Directors, K. E. Davis, ’10; Carlton G. Ketchum, ’16;
School Committees, Class Committees, Fraternity Committees, District Teams and
Representatives and Student Committees.

The raising of $300,000 was the goal set for the erection of Alumni Hall. An
Alumni member was named on each school and fraternity committee to help direct
the progress of each committee. A committee on Speakers, Meetings, and a. Fly-
ing Squadron were named. They were L. B. Hurst, '05, chairman; Dr. B. F. Jen-
kins, ’06, Dr. E. T. Chatham, '09, Charles A. Loucks, ’97, J. A. Richardson, ’15,
James P. Herron, ’15, Robert E. Grove, ’14.

On January 17th, the big drive was started to raise funds for the erection
of Alumni Hall. Up until this time preparations had been under Way for two
months. A big campaign organization had been affected. Every alumnus had been
informed, through The Weekly and by letter and bulletin as to the need of Alumni

and proceeds to clean up the place. He
has a strong aﬂﬁnity for colored socks
and besides being a good student he is
a moccasin kicker of no mean ability.

This good-looking boy radiates sun-

only a good student, but a good fellow,
also, and shimmy! oh, girls!

If brains were an ocean Mac's would
ﬂoat a navy. He has little to say in an
argument, but What he does say counts.
A ﬁne scout and a friend of all the boys.

Hall, and the way selected to put it on the campus. And on January 17th, the
drive was officially underway, continuing up until January 31st.

Vacation days may have been holidays in fact as well as in name for some
Pittites, but they were marked by anything but leisure at campaign headquarters
in the Commonwealth Building, where each day during the Christmas period
seemed to be simply a succession of committee meetings. Groups of Alumni repre-
senting the schools, the classes and the fraternities followed one another into the
alumni oﬂice to confer as to organization, draft letters and completing plans for
their respective portions of the job of mobolizing Pitt dollars for Alumni Hall.

Between Committee meetings, busy campaign directors turned out bulletins
telling distant Pittites just what ‘is being done, and why and where. During the
time of the campaign every committee man was doing more than his share of
rounding up the subscriptions. Each committeeman at school had a list of students
whom he was supposed to see and urge to subscribe to the Alumni Hall fund. The
minimum amount was thirty-ﬁve dollars. And every loyal Pittite responded will-
ingly with his share towards the betterment of Pitt.

On Friday, January 16th, the Alumni Campaigners held a rally in the Fort Pitt
Hotel. Workers from every county in Western Pennsylvania and outlying dis-
tricts were present. Colonel Joe Thompson presided at the meeting. Reports were
given by the head committeemen on the progress of the campaign to be made.
New Policies were outlined as to how the maximum could be obtained.

The Campaign was one big race on the campus. A big bulletin board was
erected near State Hall, and on it was kept daily the amount raised by each school,
and the percentage of the school’s subscription in comparisonwith that of other
schools was recorded also with the greatest of enthusiasm ever manifested on the

“Buck” is a little fellow with less
hair and a quiet disposition, and is well-
liked by all. Very active in social
circles. Is a good student and no doubt
will make 1921 famous.

S. C. Stahlman ‘I! Q
Charleroi, Pa.

“Ches” is one of the few good-
hearted boys of the class. Although
he spends a. good deal of time with a
certain fair lass up the "Mon” valley,
we feel sure he will make good.

Harry H. Sternberg

Honorable mention to Harry. Not
only is he a great expert in the theory
of crown and bridge but a statesman as
well. He is a good square fellow, his
one fault being that he pals with Rubin.

THE POSTER THAT BROUGHT RESULTS

campus, the campaign was put across with a success that will never be forgotten in
the minds of every true Pittite.

Monday, January 26th, the ground was broken for Alumni Hall in the pres-
ence of hundreds of students, the faculty and oﬂicials of the University and a num-
ber of prominent alumni and other citizens, Colonel Joseph H. Thompson presided.
In a brief introductory speech, he appealed to students and alumni to lend their
full support to the project and to take more active concern in their Alma Mater.
Floyd Rose also spoke. George Stewart, president of the Senior class, spoke on
the necessity of such a building. The ﬁrst shovelful of ground was broken by At-
torney Laurence B. Hurst, ’02.

It was not long after the ground breaking, that the steam shovel could be seen
at work on the site of the new building, Alumni Hall, which in the future will take
the place of the State Hall annexes. Despite the extreme winter weather the work
was kept up and forms for the foundation were rapidly put in place. The work
on the excavating was held up for about a week on account of the steam shovel
breaking down, but time was made up and by next fall, in all probability, students
will return to the campus to see Alumni Hall completed and ready for use. Build-
ing material is being rushed to the site.

The plans that have been agreed upon by the Building Committee provide for
a three hundred foot recitation hall two stories and basement, approximately ﬁfty
feet in depth, containing thirty-six recitation rooms, each with a capacity of forty
students, four lecture rooms with the capacity of one hundred each, eighteen small
rooms for the use of the instructors, locker space for six hundred, a heating plant
and adequate toilet articles. Benno Janssen one of Pittsburgh's best known archi-
tects, who designed the Pittsburgh Athletic Association Building, was the archi-
tect.

The Industrial Fellowship System, formulated by the late Dr. Robert Kennedy
Duncan in 1906, and primarily placed in experimental operation at the University of
Kansas in January, 1907, was inaugurated at the University of Pittsburgh in
September, 1911. In March, 1913, Messrs. Andrew William Mellon and Richard
Beatty Mellon, bankers of Pittsburgh, established it on a permanent basis at that
institution. Thus while the Mellon Institute of Industrial Research, the home of
this successful system of practical co—operation between science and industry, is an
integral part of the University of Pittsburgh and operates in close sympathetic ac-
cord with it, it possesses an endowment of its own and is under its own manage-
ment.

According to this system of research, an industrialist, a company or an associa-
tion of manufacturers having a problem or group of problems requiring investiga-
tion, may become the donor of an Industrial Fellowship by contributing to the
Mellon Institute a deﬁnite amount of money, for a period of not less than one year.
This foundation sum must be adequate for the purchase of all necessary special ap-
paratus or other equipment as well as to furnish the annual stipend of the research
man or men selected to work on the particular problem, the solution of which is
of interest to the donor. The Institute houses the investigatory work, furnishes
it with the use of its permanent equipment, affords library and consultative facili-
ties, gives careful direction to the progress of the research, and provides an atmos-
phere which is conducive to productive inquiry. All results obtained during the
course of the Industrial Fellowship belong exclusively to the donor. The main ob-
ject of the Institute is to supply for competent investigators every incentive and the
most favorable opportunities for fruitful research in the physical sciences and
technology, and to make science subserve the practical needs of industry.

The following table presents the number of Industrial Fellowships which have
been founded in the Institute from March to March of each year, 1911 to 1920; the
number of Industrial Fellows (research chemists and engineers) who. have been
employed thereon; and the total amounts of money contributed for their mainten-
ance by the Industrial Fellowship donors (industrialists and associations of manu-
facturers) :

The total amount of money contributed by industrial ﬁrms to the Institute f01
the nine years ending March 1, 1920, was $1,213,425.
Institute itself expended approximately $400,000 in taking care of overhead ex-
penses——sa1aries of members of permanent staff and office force, maintenance of
building, apparatus, etc.——in connection with the operation of the Industrial Fellow-
Besides this amount, the building and permanent equipment of the Insti-
tute, which make it the most complete and modern experiment station in the mun-

try, represent an investment of about $350,000.

Reserve Officers Training Corps

The Reserve Oﬂ‘icers Training Corps originated at Pitt in the early Spring of
1917, and was followed in the Autumn of 1918 by the Students Auxiliary Training
Corps. After the demobilization of the Students Auxiliary Training Corps in the
winter of 1918-19, plans were laid for a course in Military Science and Tactics
under the direction of Officers of the United States Regular Army. These plans
materialized in the Autumn of 1919, when Major Mitchell and Captains Lyon and
Falk were assigned by the War Department as Instructors in Military Science and
Tactics at Pitt. Since its inception at Pitt the Reserve Oﬂicers Training Corps has
grown by leaps and bounds until there are now about two hundred men enrolled.

The primary object of the Reserve Ofﬁcers Training Corps is to provide mili-
tary training at civil educatonal institutions in order that selected students can
qualify as Reserve Olﬁcers without interfering with their civil studies. The mili-
tary training a student receives during the time he is ﬁtting himself for a pro-
fession will aid greatly in making him a better citizen, since there Will be inculcated
in him a respect for lawful authority, together with those fundamentals of leader-
ship that nothing but military training can give.

The Senior division of the Reserve Oﬂicers Training Corps at Pitt requires four
years work, and consists of a Basic course and an Advanced course. In the Basic
course the student is required to master the principles of the military profession.
He here gets his ﬁrst ideas_of military discipline, courtesy and justice. At the end

of two years, those Who show the required proﬁciency are entered in the Advanced

course, and on the completion of this" course are eligible to Commissions in the
Oiﬁcers Reserve Corps. '

There are at present three units at Pitt: Coast Artillery, Motor Transport and
Infantry. The Coast Artillery are drilled in the handling of Heavy Ordinance and
in the Fire Control systems of the Coast Artillery Corps. In addition to other ma-
terial, the Coast Artillery has a 155 G. P. F. and an 8 inch Howitzer, together with
a complete Fire Control system as used in the Coast Defenses. The Motor Trans-
port are taught the construction and handling of all motor vehicles used in the
Service, and the handling of motor convoys and truck trains. The material of the
Motor Transport consists in part of Dodge and Cadillac touring cars, a ten ton
caterpillar tractor, and a complete machine-shop on a truck mounting. In the In-
fantry, the men are instructed in the latest methods of trench warfare, patrolling
and general Infantry tactics.

SIGMA CHI

Sigma Chi

Sigma Chi Fraternity was founded at Miami University, Oxford, Ohio, in 1855.
It was the ﬁrst national fraternity to come to Pitt, When, in 1909, a charter was
granted to Delta Kappa, a local here, which thus became Beta Theta Chapter.
The chapter rose steadily and prospered, numbering among its members such men
as Collingwood, Sutherland, Sies, Thornhill, Langdon, McDaniels, and Gerald
Morrow. During the war, twenty-four out of twenty-seven active members en-
listed, and it was found necessary to close the house. After the war, the fraternity,
then numbering six men, secured a new house at 153 North Dithridge Street, the
present home of the fraternity, and began the work of reorganizing and rebuild-
ing. It now numbers among its members many of the active students of the uni-
Versity.

SIGMA ALPHA EPSILON

Sigma Alpha Epsilon

Sigma Alpha Epsilon Fraternity was founded March 9, 1856 at the University
of Alabama, Tuscaloosa. The fraternity has ninety chapters representing almost
every state in the Union. In the fraternity there are thirty-seven Alumni Associa-
tions, one of which was established in Paris, being active during the late war.

On March 10, 1913, Chi Omicron, a local at the University was granted its

charter to Sigma Alpha Epsilon, and was known as the Pennsylvania Chi Omicron
chapter of Sigma Alpha Epsilon.

The new chapter soon gained a position in the University both on account of its
scholarship and its school activities.

PHI EPSILON PI

Phi Epsilon Pi

Phi Epsilon Pi was founded in the year 1902 at the University of New York.
Urged on by its progressive and democratic doctrines, its expansion was phenomenal,
and in but a brief period it was ready to take an honored position in the fraternity
World. Recognizing no barriers to any race or creed, social or political station, it
opens its doors to anyone who can measure up to its high qualiﬁcations and stand-
ards; and today, Phi Epsilon Pi enjoys the unique privilege of being the only national
non-sectarian fraternity in the country. Its aim is to promote an indivisible com-
radeship that strives both to make the individual less selﬁsh, and to develop the
most innate of altruistic motives until the common welfare becomes a continual
source of intellectual enjoyment.

Imbued with these very principles, Zeta Chapter of Phi Epsilon Pi was installed
at the University of Pittsburgh on Dec. 26, 1913, and since then has left no stone
unturned in its earnest endeavors to help place Pitt where it deserves to be.

Supporting all activities, campaigns and undertakings, Phi Epsilon Pi devotedly
takes pride in everything that Pitt accomplishes. We feel that her interests are

ours, and are always ready to put our shoulder to the wheel wherever Pitt is con-
cerned.

DELTA TAU DELTA

Delta Tau Delta

Delta Tau Delta Fraternity was founded in February 1859 at Bethany College,
Bethany, West Virginia (then Virginia). The fraternity adopted a plan of con-
servative expansion and has adhered to this policy so that now Delta Tau Delta is
represented in sixty-two colleges and Universities in all parts of the United States.
A chapter of the fraternity was established in the Western University of Pennsyl-
vania in 1864 and continued to be active for ﬁfteen years following that period, but
the charter was then withdrawn because of sudden inactivity. Some of the alumni
who represent the old chapter are John S. Robb, Henry Meyer, Charles Kelley, Alfred
Duff and James Camp. The fraternity was re-established at the University of Pitts-

burgh November 6, 1914 in recognition of the efforts of Alpha Alpha Local Fra-
ternity.

Alpha Alpha Fraternity was organized October 25, 1902 when the University
was still located over in Allegheny. Realizing the advantages offered by a national
organization the members of that body decided to petition a national fraternity,
chose Delta Tau Delta, and were recognized and established by the Arch Chapter
in November 1914, as Gamma Sigma Chapter of Delta Tau Delta. Since that time
the fraternity has enjoyed activity in the University and hopes to continue to do so.
R. W. Richards, S. J. Glass, Jr., H. E. Friesell, J. G. Gardner, A. P. Miller and R. K.
Soppitt are a few of the alumni of the present chapter who were very active during
their undergraduate days.

Fl LAMBDA PHI

Pi Lambda Phi

The Pi Lambda Phi fraternity was founded at Columbia University in 1895. Its
work during that year showed such an extraordinary development of fraternal love
and spirit that it was not long before Columbia and New York University were ask-
ing admittance to the organization. Then Pi Lambda Phi was incorporated as a
national fraternity and further continued its development by establishing chapters
at Yale, Cornell, Lehigh, University of Chicago, and the University of Pennsylvania.
Gamma Sigma was installed at the University of Pittsburgh during the year 1914.
Although times were bad and struggles numerous it grew with great rapidity and
was soon one of the reconized leaders of its kind on the campus.

Pi Lambda Phi has among its active members Harry Levine, captain of the Pitt
varsity basketball team, Frank Shermer, business manager of the Pitt Weekly, Lou
Mervis, a star tackle on the Pitt football team, the Bloom brothers, who bid fair to
be successful candidates for the baseball team and the holders of several other
campus honors. Its alumni boast of such men as Ben Lubic, one of the best basket-
ball men Pitt has ever known, and Al Paul Lefton who was the busiest and most im-
portant man on the campus in 1917. Academically it is among the leaders and
hopes to duplicate its feat of 1915 in which year it was surpassed in yearly general
average by no fraternity, having a perfect 100% average. The fraternity has always
stood for the highest and best at Pitt and is ever ready to lend a helping hand in
making it the best in the land.

PHI GAMMA DELTA

Phi Gamma Delta

Phi Gamma Delta was founded in Canonsburg, Pennsylvania, at Jefferson
College, May 1, 1848. Since that time the fraternity has allowed a program of
conservative extension and its active chapters now number 62. Over 7,000 of its
members took an active part in the late war and among other notable achieve-
ments, Phi Gamma Delta claims the distinction of being the only fraternity to
have 2 Congressional Medals to its credit.

Among its prominent alumni we ﬁnd the names of such men as Newton D.
Baker, Secretary of War, Thomas R. Marshall, Vice-President of the U. S., A. S.
Burleson, Postmaster General, Charles P. Steinmetz, head of the General Electric
Company and John A. Brashear, “Pennsylvania’s Foremost Citizen”, the last named
coming from our own chapter.

The local Pi Sigma chapter of Phi Gamma Delta, formerly known as Phi Zeta
Phi, was chartered February 3, 1917. Its active chapter has been well represented
in the activities of the University. Six of its men, including the captain, held
regular positions on the varsity football team. Scotty proved a capable cheerleader
while Hastings and Schoﬁeld held the presidency of the Glee Clubs and Cap &
Gown respectively.

PHI DELTA THETA

Phi Delta Theta

The Phi Delta Theta fraternity was founded at Miami University, Oxford, Ohio,
on December 26, 1848. Before its ﬁrst anniversary it had been established at
Indiana University, Bloomington, Ind., and before the expiration of the second year,
at Centre College, Danville, Ky. At the beginning of the Civil War, the fraternity
had laid the foundations for substantial growth, but the war checked, in a measure,
immediate development and caused the suspension of a few chapters.

Ten charters were granted from 1860 to 1869 and during the following decade
the fraternity entered Alabama University, Vanderbilt, the University of Virginia
and several other Southern institutions. From 1879 to 1899, charters were
granted to Eastern institutions as well as institutions in the far west and the fra-
ternity became national in extent. From 1890, the fraternity has enjoyed a steady
growth and today numbers 85 chapters in the United States and Canada.

The local chapter of Phi Delta Theta was granted its charter on January 1,
1918 and was installed here March 15, 1918. Although one of the youngest national
fraternities at Pitt, Phi Delta Theta was the ﬁrst undergraduate fraternity to b11y a
home, moving into the house in May, 1919. The local chapter was organized as
Delta Sigma Pi in 1908 and furnished many men prominent in school activities. At
present the active chapter numbers 35 members.

THETA CHI

Theta Chi

The present University of Pittsburgh chapter of Theta Chi Fraternity was or-
ganized by a group of students in the School of Engineering in December, 1915, un-
der the name of Sigma Epsilon. The main purpose of this organization was to get
together as many non—fraternity men as possible, as Well as to give the School of
Engineering a better representation in the university than had been the case previ-
ously. Under its ﬁrst constitution the organization was conﬁned to the School of
Engineering. But as time went on, in order to get a. ﬁrmer foundation and a
broader ﬁeld from which to draw its members, it was found advisable for the best
interests of the organization to apply to a national Greek-letter fraternity for ad-
mission to their body. A petition was drawn up, accordingly, and was sent to the
Grand Chapter of Theta Chi Fraternity in 1917, and again in 1918. In the latter
year the petition was approved and Sigma Epsilon became Alpha Beta Chapter of
Theta Chi, on May 24th, 1919.

LAMBDA CHI ALPHA

Lambda Chi Alpha

Lambda Chi Alpha Fraternity was founded in 1909 at Boston University,
Boston, Massachusetts. Though one of the youngest of the national fraternities,
it has grown so rapidly that already, in its eleventh year, it numbers ﬁfty-four
chapters, in the important universities and colleges, from Maine to California.

Gamma Epsilon Chapter of Lambda Chi Alpha was founded in 1916 as Omega
Alpha Pi. During the war, most of its members entered active service, and the
fraternity was compelled to surrender its house. When Omega Alpha Pi re-
organized after the war, a petition was presented to Lambda Chi Alpha, which was
duly granted and the local chapter was installed on May 30-31, 1919.

Though one of the youngest of the fraternities at Pitt, Lambda Chi Alpha num-
bers among its chapter roll, both past and present, some of the most active men
that have ever attended Pitt. Particularly is this true in the matter of publications,
in which ﬁeld, Lambda Chi Alpha is the acknowledged leader. The Owl, the
Panther, the VVeekly, and the Review, the debating team and the Cap and Gown
Club, as well as the Aero Club, and various other clubs have many members of
Lambda Chi Alpha occupying prominent positions in their organization.

OM ICRON DELTA KAPPA

Omicron Delta Kappa

Founded Dec. 3, 1914
Gamma Circle
University of Pittsburgh
Established June, 1916.

HISTORY

The founding of the Omicron Delta Kappa Society was the result of the evi-
dent need of some honorary organization to give suitable recognition to men who
have attained distinction in any legitimate line of college life, and to bring the
various groups of the campus community into a closer relationship. The line be-
tween the individual groups in most colleges is often too sharply deﬁned, and since
such a distinction is more apparent than real, its elimination will secure a. better
community spirit and great zeal for the upbuilding of student life.

PURPOSE

The original purpose by which the founders of the Omicron Delta Kappa Society
were actuated in its establishment has already been touched upon. The following
extract from the constitution of the Society will serve to explain this point more
speciﬁcally:

It is the desire of the Omicron Delta Kappa Society “to recognize men who
have attained a high standard of efficiency in collegiate activities, and to inspire
others to strive for conspicuous attainments along similar lines”.

NU SIGMA NU

Nu Sigma Nu

Nu Sigma Nu was organized at the University of Michigan in March, 1882.
Delta Chapter, of the University of Pittsburgh, was the fourth chapter to enter the
national organization. There are now 34 chapters, 1038 active members, and
6,405 alumni, Plans were ﬁrst laid for installing a medical fraternity at the old
Western University of Pennsylvania in 1890. Delta Chapter received its charter
in January, 1891, and became the ﬁrst medical fraternity at the Western Univer-
sity. The chapter iinmediately became active. It had no permanent house at the
time; meetings were held in the rooms of the various members. The men always
spent some time in mutual help in their medical studies. It was not until about
1900 that the chapter had permanent quarters. The headquarters were ﬁrst
located near the old Medical School, on Reardon Ave. When the school was moved
to the campus, the fraternity took quarters in Oakland. About 1910 the chapter
became located in the house at 3517 Fifth Ave., and since that time has always had
a chapter house. In 1917, the chapter moved to the present house, 344 Melwood
Street.

The chapter has always taken an active part in University affairs, on the cam-
pus and in the athletic ﬁeld, as well as in social and in scholastic matters in the
School of Medicine. It has been a rule to set the scholastic requirements for
pledges on a high standard. No man is pledged until he has entered the Medical
School, and only if his previous work has been satisfactory. No pledge is initiated
until late in his freshman year in the Medical School, after he has made a good
record in his medical studies. The chapter has a strong, active, Alumni Associa-
tion, which was organized in 1910. During the war, Delta, through her alumni,
was well represented. Practically 100% of the younger alumni were in some
branch of the service. Since the return of the alumni from overseas, the associa-
tion has been reorganized, and regular joint meetings held with the active members.

PHI BETA Pl

Phi Beta Pi

The fraternity was organized at the University of Pittsburgh (then Western
University of Pennsylvania) March 5, 1891. The local organization was known. as
the Pi Beta Phi fraternity and continued as such till April 1, 1898. At this time a
national organization was formed, the local chapter becoming the Alpha Chapter
and Beta Chapter was installed at the University of Michigan. Due to the fact that
the Womens Fraternity, Pi Beta Phi was an older organization, the name of the
fraternity was changed to Phi Beta Pi, the new chapter dating from August 1,
1900. The fraternity now has thirty-four chapters. The Alumni of the local
chapter are well represented on the faculty and have formed a strong Alumni As-

sociation.

Kappa Psi

Kappa Psi is the oldest of all medical and pharmaceutical fraternities. It Was
founded May 30, 1879. Its chapter roll numbers eighty-seven active chapters,
and its membership is over ten thousand. There are thirty graduate chapters.
Kappa Psi has always been an important factor in promoting a feeling of fellow-
ship and co-operation among the members of the professions of medicine and
pharmacy.

Kappa Psi stands for scholarship, industry, sobriety, mutual fellowship and
esteem, nobility and courage of heart and mind. It is striving to do everything
in its power to develop real strong men, which the university will be proud to
claim as its own. The interests of the fraternity and of the university are always
kept in mind, and co-operation with faculty and school authorities welcomed.
Kappa Psi urges its members at all times to devote their entire energies to “things
worth while”.

PHI RHO SIGMA

Phi Rho Sigma

Phi Rho Sigma was founded in 1890 at Northwestern Medical School, Chicago,
Ill. It has 27 active chapters in medical schools in the United States.

Chi Chapter was established at Pitt in 1908. The history of the local chapter
is as follows: Chi chapter of the Phi Rho Sigma Fraternity, located at the
University of Pittsburgh, formerly the Alpha Kappa Phi fraternity, was organized
in 1894 by Drs. L. W. Swope, the late C. E. Van Horne, A. F. B. Morris and
others, the object being for studying and quizzing. It became a Greek Letter
Fraternity in 1896 and the name Alpha Kappa Phi was selected. It was a strong
local fraternity for several years and movements set afoot for afﬁliation with some
national fraternity were voted down from time to time. When the University in
1908 purchased the large site for the campus, it was announced that all depart-
ments heretofore separated, were to be brought together; this again renewed the
desire for affiliation. The members decided to apply to a National Medical Fra-
ternity for a charter and to this end sought admission as a chapter of Phi Rho
Sigma. After the usual investigation and the preliminaries were attended to, Alpha
Kappa Phi was received and initiated into Phi Rho Sigma Fraternity as “Chi”
Chapter, at the twelfth annual banquet of Alpha Kappa Phi, held at the University
Club, March 12, 1908.

ALPHA CHI SIGMA

Alpha Chi Sigma

The Alpha chapter of Alpha Chi Sigma was organized and founded at the Uni-
verslty of Wisconsin on December 11, 1902. The fraternity was organized as a
professional fraternity, membership being eligible to men making some branch of
chemistry their profession. In the spring of 1915, the Alembic Club was formed at
the University of Pittsburgh for the purpose of petitioning Alpha Chi Sigma for a
chapter. The petition was favorably acted upon and on June 12, 1915, the Omega
chapter was installed at the University of Pittsburgh by Dr. L. 1. Shaw, Grand Re-
corder-Treasurer. After installation, rooms were secured in the Forbes Building
where meetings were held until May, 1916 when the fraternity moved to the Oakland
apartments where several members occupied the rooms. On May 1, 1917, a house
was rented at 234 McKee Place where the fraternity remained until May 1, 1918 when
the present location, 423 N. Craig Street was secured.

Among the alumni, Dr. R. F. Bacon, director of the Mellon Institute of Indus-
trial Research was a colonel in the Chemical Warfare Service, being Chief of the
Technical Division, Chemical Warfare Service, A. E. F. W. A. Hamor, an assistant
director of the Mellon Institute was Assistant Chief of the Technical Division, Chemi-
cal Warfare Service, A. E. F.

DELTA TH ETA PHI

Delta Theta Phi

Gibson Senate of Delta Theta Phi, national legal fraternity, was installed at
the University of Pittsburgh in 1916. The local petitioning body was composed of
20 members known as Delta Kappa Nu. Chief Justice Gibson, for whom the chapter
of Delta Theta Phi at Pitt is named, was the most renowned judge in the annals
of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court. For nearly forty years he was the great jurist
of Pennsylvania, during that time sitting with twenty-six different justices and at
the time of his death he had been longer in office than any contemporary judge in
the world. He is known as the “John Marshall” of Pennsylvania because of the
vast inﬂuence of his decisions on the laws of the state.

The chapter consists at present of twenty—two active members; eight seniors,
four middlers and ten juniors. Meetings are held regularly every Thursday even-
ing, two meetings a month being given over to Moot Trials, and two to business
meetings and social affairs. G. J. Thompson of the faculty and formerly of the
Harvard Law School faculty and Judge MacFarlane are members of Delta. Theta
Phi.

DELTA SIGMA, PHI

Delta Sigma Phi

The activities of the individuals of any Fraternity, Whether manifested in college
or in after life, are her greatest heritage and the Omega Chapter of Delta Sigma
Phi may look with pride upon the enviable record of her members. At the time of
the installation of the Chapter in 1916, the world was ringing from the din of battle
and it was hardly a year later that our country was compelled to offer all her wealth
and energy to protect her honor and the principles for which our forefathers fought.
VVhen the “Call to the Colors” came early in the summer of 1917, Omega, with a
membership of only 50 men, enlisted 42 in the ﬁght for Liberty and Humanity.
None of the worthy sons of Omega sleep in foreign soil but one of the 42 blue stars
in the Chapter’s Service Flag was turned to gold. This gilt marking in the now
sacred emblem holds in memory the name of a U. S. Sailor—Phil McNal1y.

The strife ended, one by one the Delta Sigma Phis returned to civilian life and
are now found leading in college and other special activities. They gave to Simmons
College at Abilene, Texas a Director of Athletics in the name of Dr. Roy A. Easter-
day, who, while at Pitt, had an admirable career in the various lines of athletics.
Among the students, we ﬁnd Robert K. McCurdy, ’21, Manager of the 1920 Basket-
ball Team; Frank E. Eckert, ’21, a former Captain in the Army, End on the 1919
Football Team; John J. McLean, ’23, Guard on the 1919 Football Team, he again
showing his prowess by holding down a similar position on the 1920 Basketball
Team. The fraternity has no house at present, but hopes to have one after the
ﬁrst of May. ‘

TAU DELTA TH ETA

Tau Delta Theta

Tau Delta Theta is a professional fraternity in the School of Education. Its
formation was the culmination of a desire that had been forming for the last several
years among the men interested in the teaching profession. The plans for the forma-
tion of this organization materialized in October, 1919, and the fraternity Was 0ﬁi—
cially recognized by the university in January, 1920. Its purpose is the promotion
of educational interests. Dean Chambers is faculty adviser and honorary member,
and many of the faculty of the School of Education have endorsed the organization.

Among its members, Tau Delta Theta numbers men active in the various phases
of school life. Thumm is a member of the Student Senate, and he and Drass, Coyne
and VVeaver, are members of Phi Delta Kappa, an honorary fraternity. Smith was
a lieutenant in the aviation service during the war. Other members served in the
infantry, and the medical corps. Klein has been a member of the debating team of
the university. All of the other members are represented in some form of activity.

GAMMA Pl SIGMA

Gamma Pi Sigma

Gamma Pi Sigma is an honorary fraternity for those Who are especially in-
terested in the art of Public Speaking, and who have done something of merit at
the University in forensic activities. It was organized in May, 1919, by the mem-
bers of that season’s debating team. Its chief purpose was to stimulate interest in
debating at Pitt, that debating might attain the standard of other activities. The
insignia of the fraternity is a key in the form of a shield on which are the letters
Gamma Pi Sigma. The pledge insignia is a dark purple ribbon worn diagonally
across the vest. ‘

The members of Gamma Pi Sigma are also leaders in other activities. Rowe
was Editor-in-Chief of the Weekly, manager of the Debating Team, manager of the
musical clubs, member of the Student Senate, and of the Pitt Players. He is also a.
member of Lambda Chi Alpha, Omicron Delta Kappa, and Sigma Delta Chi. Nicklas
is business manager of the Pitt Review, Owl Editor for the Law School, and is
a member of the Y. M. C. A. Management Board. He is a member of Lambda C_hi
Alpha, Sigma Delta Chi, and Delta Theta Phi. Fulton is a member of the Student
Senate and a Pitt Player. Brody is captain of this year's debating team. Waring
is Editor-in-Chief of the Weekly and the Review, and is President of the Student
Senate. Friesinger and Davidson are on this year's debating team.

SIGMA ALPHA MU

Sigma Alpha Mu

Sigma Alpha Mu Fraternity was founded by eight men at the College of the
City of New York on November 6, 1909. In the ten years of its existence the
fraternity has grown by leaps and bounds until today it has a membership of over
one thousand in twenty-one chapters in the leading colleges and universities. It
also has six alumni clubs on its rolls. The fraternity has even become inter-
national, since there are chapters in Canada.

The object of the fraternity is “to foster and maintain among its sons a spirit
of fraternity; a spirit of mutual aid and moral support; to instil and maintain in
the hearts of its sons a love for and loyalty to Alma Matei and its ideals; to in-
culcate among its sons such ideals as will result in actions worthy of the highest pr‘e-
cepts of true manhood, democracy, and humanity.”

The local chapter of Sigma Alpha Mu was installed December 6, 1919.

Delta Lambda Mu, Pitt's youngest contribution to the P'anther’s ever increas-
ing litter of humanity’s progeny, has just recently been admitted into the realm
beyond the bolted door. So recently, in fact, that the young cub has hardly
advanced to the stage of making its presence known, let alone speaking up for it-
self before its accomplished elders.

Petition for recognition was submitted to the Committee on admission and
recognition of Fraternities on March 26, 1920. Approval and sanction of activities
was granted April 2, 1920.

Although its activities must necessarily be conﬁned to its local lair, the young
cub is possessed with a predilection for exploring beyond the Well-beaten trail.
Eager to grasp every opportunity of developing into a vigorous specimen akin to
its predecessors, Delta Lambda Mu will strive to its utmost to comply with the
established ideals of its colleagues, and in that way attempt to widen its scope,
thereby attaining a realization of its greatest ambition—a nationalizing program.

Sigma Delta Chi, professional journalistic fraternity, was founded at De Pauw
University in 1909. It now has active chapters in nearly every institution of higher
learning which possesses a recognized school or department of journalism. The
Pittsburgh Chapter, which was installed in June, 1919, is one of four granted to
institutions east of the Ohio, the other three favored being Columbia, Cornell and
Maine. There are at present thirty-three chapters of Sigma Delta Chi.

The purpose of the fraternity is to associate college journalists into a more in-
timately organized unit of good fellowship; to assist the members in acquiring the
noblest principles of journalism and to co-operate with them in this ﬁeld; and to
advance the standard of the Press by fostering a higher ethical code.

Members are chosen generally from the junior and senior classes; and must be
men who give evidence of superior intellectual ability, and have done actual and pro-
ﬂcient work in journalism, either in or out of college.

The fraternity’s inﬂuence for better journalism is being felt more strongly each
year, both in the college world, where its undergraduate members edit many student
publications, and in the professional world, where its alumni shape the policies of
many newspapers.

Phi Delta Kappa is a professional fraternity of an honorary character. It has
existed as a national fraternity under its present organization since 1910. In the
spring of 1910, representatives from seven institutions having educational organiza-
tions met at Indianapolis for the purpose of consolidation. Three types of organi-
zation were represented among these. Phi Kappa Mu founded in 1906 was repre-
sented by three chapters, Indiana, Leland Stanford, Junior and Iowa. Phi Delta
Kappa founded in Columbia in 1908 was represented by Columbia, Chicago, and
Minnesota. Nu Rho Beta founded at Missouri in 1909 was upon its petition allowed
membership in the conference after the eight articles of agreement drawn up by
Columbia. and Indiana had been passed. The chief purposes underlying these sepa-
rate organizations were similar: Co-operation coupled with good fellowship; in
promoting education as a, profession; emphasis upon a fraternal and social spirit;
support of progressive educational movements outside of the University; encourage-
ment of research among school men in the ﬁeld.

Kappa ‘Alpha Theta

ALPHA OMEGA CHAPTER

Kappa Alpha Theta was the ﬁrst society of women organized with principles
and methods akin to those of the Greek-letter fraternities and the ﬁrst to bear a
Greek-letter name. The fraternity was organized at De Pauw University, Green-
castle, Indiana, January 27, 1870. This year, 1920, marks the ﬁftieth anniversary
of Kappa Alpha Theta. From a membership of four on the 27th of January 1870,
the fraternity now has a membership of 8,644. The fraternity has chapters in
forty-four of the largest universities and colleges in the United States and one
chapter in Canada, at Toronto University. There are 32 alumnae chapters. The
fraternity is divided into districts for purposes of administration. There are nine
districts none of which contain more than ﬁve college chapters.

Pi Theta Nu was the ﬁrst society of women at the University of Pittsburgh and
was the ﬁrst to receive a charter from a national fraternity. It was installed as
Alpha Omega Chapter of Kappa Alpha Theta on December 4 1915.

Delta Zeta

Delta Zeta was founded at Miami University, October 24, 1902. Omicron
Chapter was installed at the University of Pittsburgh January 20, 1916. Twenty-
two chapters have been chartered in we1l—recognized universities by Delta Zeta. The
standard of scholarship is high. Chapters can be installed only in universities and
colleges which grant, in addition to the bachelor’s degree, the higher degrees such
as doctor of philosophy and doctor of laws, and whose graduates are admitted to
foreign study. Delta Zeta has the distinction of having not a single inactive chapter
among those that have been chartered. Its official publication is known as “The
Lamp”.

The girls of the Pittsburgh chapter have been prominent in school activities
at all times. Many of them are members of various honorary and professional or-
ganizations, such as Alpha Lambda Nu, Pi Lambda Theta, Phi Epsilon, Quax, and
Sigma Sigma Epsilon. Among the almuni are many members of distinction. Prob-
ably the most notable of these is a Chinese girl, Be Di Lee, who graduated from the
university at the age of seventeen, and is now teaching in one of the Chinese Uni-
versities in Shanghai.

With the backing of the Pittsburgh Alumnae Chapter of Alpha Xi Delta,
Marguerite Roberts of Iota Chapter, University of West Virginia, who had entered
the University of Pittsburgh the previous year, undertook in the fall of 1917 the
organization of a local fraternity with the view of petitioning Alpha Xi Delta for
membership.

On May 17th, 1918, after an existence of four months as the Alpha Delta local
fraternity, a petition to the national fraternity of Alpha Xi Delta was granted and
the nineteen members of Alpha Delta became charter members of Alpha Alpha
Chapter of Alpha Xi Delta.

At the time that Alpha Delta was installed as Alpha Alpha chapter, the fra-
ternity stood highest in scholarship at the University of Pittsburgh, but Was not
granted the loving-cup, which the City Panhellenic offers after mid-year examina-
tions, because of a ruling that a chapter must belong to Panhellenic one year be-
fore it is eligible to enter the contest. Since that time, due to the unsettled con-
ditions during the S. A. T. C. regime, the scholarship standing of the fraternities
has not been determined.

Pi Beta Phi

Pi Beta Phi is the oldest national fraternity for women in existence. It is the
oldest society for women modeled after the men's fraternities and was the ﬁrst or-
ganization of its kind to establish chapters in the different schools and colleges
throughout the country. Pi Beta Phi was founded at Monmouth College, Illinois,
April 28, 1867. It was incorporated as a national organization by an act of the
Illinois State Legislature, October 14, 1899. In all, Pi Beta Phi has sixty chapters
throughout the United States and Canada and a total membership of over ten thous-
and ﬁve hundred and ﬁfty.

Pi Beta Phi was installed at the University of Pittsburgh September 19, 1918.
The active chapter consists of twenty-two members and two pledges. Since its
establishment at the University and even before, while still a local, the fraternity
has endeavored to work for the school and to take part in activities. The fraternity
has always been represented in all forms of activities—athletic, scholastic, and liter-
ary. It has three members in Alpha Lambda Nu; three members in Pi Lambda
Theta. One of its members was Panther Editor, three were Editors of the Owl, two
are on the Pitt Weekly Staff. In other activities such as Senate, class offices, Girls’
Glee Club and Orchestra Pi Beta Phi is also represented.

Kappa Kappa Gamma

Gamma Epsilon Chapter

Kappa Kappa Gamma fraternity was founded at Monmouth College, Monmouth,
Illinois, October 13, 1870. It now has forty-ﬁve chapters and a membership of
nine thousand ﬁve hundred.

Gamma Epsilon chapter was installed at the University of Pittsburgh the 21st
of February, 1919, and is the forty-ﬁfth chapter. Before it was installed as national
the chapter was known as Epsilon Rho Omicron and was organized on February 22,
1916. There were ﬁfteen charter members whose purpose and aim was to become
a chapter of Kappa Kappa Gamma. The fraternity has always held a conserva-
tive policy of extension, seasoned with a reasonable inclination for healthy and
normal growth. From a vast number of petitions received during the recent years
charters have been granted only in those cases in which a strong growing university
with the best material offered itself. The aim of the fraternity is ﬁrst quality and
then quantity.

Chi Omega

Chi Omega was founded at the University of Arkansas, Fayetteville, Ark., April
5, 1895. There were ﬁve founders. Forty-seven chapters are enrolled among the
various Universities and colleges of the United States. Chi Omega was the first fra-
ternity to adopt the white stones as the only jewels permitted in its emblem. It was
also the ﬁrst to issue a secret publication, which is called “The Mystagogue,”

Chi Omega National Policy is essentially that of Social Service. During the
war thousands of dollars were raised for relief work, and in addition each chapter
accepted some more personal War responsibility and purchased as many Liberty
Bonds as possible. The fraternity is also actively interested in vocational guidance
for women and in the betterment of social conditions for women workers. It aims
to develop worth-while, useful citizens of its members. It stands for scholarship,
and co-operation with school and community, all of which is embodied in the open
motto of the fraternity—“Hellenic Culture and Christian Ideals.”

Phi Beta Chapter of Chi Omega was installed at the University of Pittsburgh
by Mary Love Collins, December 6, 1919. It was formerly known as Alpha Gamma
Omicron.

Alpha Epsilon Phi

Chi Gamma Theta was founded at the University of Pittsburgh in May, 1919,
by a small group of Jewish students who aspired to the fulﬁllment of this three-
fold purpose: to promote scholarship and culture among the Jewish women at the
University, to spread the feeling of congeniality and social relationship among the
students and Jewish women at large, and to render unselﬁsh service to all those
in need of it. The petition to the University Committee on Fraternities ‘was
granted in June, 1919, at which time Chi Gamma Theta was localized at the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh. The fraternity was at that time morally supported by a
number of prominent men and women, both Jewish and non-Jewish, among whom
we are permittedto refer to Chancellor Samuel Black McCorn1ick, Mrs. John M.

Mecklin, Mrs. Enoch Rauh, Dr. Marion Shepard, Dr. Luba R. Goldsmith, Mr.
Richard S. Rauh.

Chi Gamma Theta was admitted to the Panhellenic Association of the Univer-
sity in Jan. 1919. It has at the present time the social and moral support of every
women’s fraternity at the University. Its membership consists of 13 regular active
members and two active pledges.

Installed May 7, 1920.

Alpha Lambda Nu. a Woman's activities fraternity, was founded during com-
mencement week, in the year 1916 by a number of seniors and several juniors who
believed that the work a girl did, by engaging in activities while an undergraduate at
the University of Pittsburgh, aside from the requirements of scholarship, was worthy
of recognition; and that by such recognition, girls in the future would be encouraged
to engage in activities and to take a leading part in school affairs.

Alpha Lambda Nu, from the start was founded on a constitutional basis, with
ideals and aims parallelling the men’s honorary fraternity Omicron Delta Kappa.
To become eligible to membership, it was required that a girl be about to complete
her junior year; that she participate in, or have participated in three of the various
activities girls engage in at the Universty; and that she possess a pleasing per-
sonality, maintaining high ideals of womanhood and good standing in scholarship.
During the years 1917 and 1918 the standard of Alpha Lambda Nu was still main-
tained though little was done other than increasing the membership. In 1919 the
scope of work for the fraternity was widened. Talks at meetings by various men
in honorary fraternities gave the members of Alpha Lambda Nu a broader horizon
by showing them what other fraternities thought along these lines. Requirements
and conditions were also investigated to determine what would be necessary to
nationalize Alpha Lambda Nu. 1920's work has been to further the ideals set down
by Alpha Lambda Nu’s founders to look into the work of extension, and to bring
the fraternity to the attention of scholastic and collegiate circles.

Pi Lambda Theta, an honorary professional fraternity for women students in
the School of Education, was founded as a local under the name of Kappa Pi in
December, 1913, at the suggestion of Dean Will Grant Chambers. At a convention
of local fraternities of like nature, held at the University of Missouri, July 3rd and
4th, 1917, Pi Lambda Theta was formed, with the six locals participating as the
charter chapters. The Pitt chapter is Delta Chapter of the national organization, and
became formally known at the foundation dinner in May, 1918.

The purpose of the fraternity is to foster the highest standards of scholarship
and of professional spirit. The members are elected on nomination by the faculty,
from the members of the senior and junior classes of the School of Education who
are qualiﬁed in scholarship and professional ability. All members continue to be
active after graduation, if they indicate such a desire.

Young Men’s Christian Association
University of Pitfsburgh Branch

The Christian Association seeks to be of practical service to every student in
the University: to help every man live up to the best that is in him; it seeks the
largest expression of Christian principles on the campus, in the class room in the
community, and in the interest of humanity throughout the world. The Associa-
tion seeks to bring together all members of evangelical churches and others in-
terested in carrying out the purpose of the Association.

During the days of the Student Army Training Corps, a building was erected
on Thackery street, by the National War Work Council of the Y. M. C. A. and is
now used by the Christian Association of the University. It provides a center for
student life. It is equipped with a piano, victrola, and moving picture machine.
Classes, clubs and organizations of the University are using the building for their
meetings.

PITKIN CLUB

Pitkin Club

The Pitkin Club was founded in 1914, by the delegates to the Student Volun-
teer Convention at Kansas City. It received its name from Horace Pitkin, a martyr
missionary in China. With the splendid help and leadership of Dr. Hugh T. Kerr
of Shadyside Presbyterian Church, the club has continued since then. A great deal
of credit goes to the faithful women of this church, who have prepared and served
lunch to the members of the club during these six years. The club now has a
membership of seventy-ﬁve. The meetings are held at noon every Wednesday at
the Shadyside Presbyterian Church. The club this year numbers almost all the
delegates to the student Volunteer Convention held at Des Moines December 31-

January 5, 1919-1920. The club is now engaged in the study of “The Faiths of
Mankind.”

THE DRUIDS

Druids

The Druids Society is an honorary organization; it is a national organization
which was founded at Penn State College. A chapter was granted to Pitt in 1916.

Sophomores alone are eligible to active membership in the Druids. The men
are picked who during their Freshman year have shown an active interest in school
affairs as well as having a good scholarship record.

The method of pledging Druids is by “tagging” method. The Freshmen are as-
sembled upon the campus and the fortunate ones tagged and presented with an oak
leaf, the Druid pledge pin. Ten men are pledged each year and they are active only
during their sophomore year.

Some of the best known Druids in Pitt have been Mcclaren, Sies, Sutherland,
Hastings, DeHart, Morrow, Jack Thompson, Liggett, Toomey, McCracken, Davies,
Ewing, Fry, Thornhill and Langdon.

FIRST PITT AERO TEAM

The Aero Club of Pittsburgh was ﬁrst formed in the spring of the year 1918,
the purpose being merely to gather together those students of the University of
Pittsburgh who were bound by the ties of a mutual interest in aviation. At its re-
vival in 1919, it was learned that an association had been formed called the‘ Inter-
collegiate Flying Association, composed of the Aero Clubs of Harvard, Yale, Prince-
ton, Columbia, Williams, and Cornell. A petition was immediately drawn up, and
was presented to the Association at their next regular business meeting, and Pitts-
burgh was admitted as the seventh charter member of the Association. After Pitt,
Rutgers, Penn, Lehigh, and Wesleyan were also admitted, swelling the number to
eleven colleges and universities.

The ﬁrst meet was ﬁrst planned to be a cross-country race to be held May 7th
and 8th, 1920, under army auspices, but a modiﬁcation of plans caused this to be
changed to a number of different events. Pitt was entitled to compete in these
events, so a plan was decided upon to choose the contestants. All those who
had been pilots in either the army, navy, or marine corps, of any of the allied na-
tions were considered at ﬁrst, but the rules of the Association compelled the choice
to narrow down to those who held reserve commissions in the United States Army.
From the contestants who possessed this commission, the ﬁve men who had had
the most ﬂying time were selected to go to New York to represent Pitt in the con-
tests. The men chosen, ﬁnal choice being by the Athletic Council, were Louis
Dussere, who was appointed manager and elected captain of the team, George L.
Simpson, Aubrey W. Schoﬁeld, Jacob F. Keller, and Jean 0. Nelson. Physical (lis-
ability compelled Simpson to remain in Pittsburgh, so the team that went to New
York consisted of the other four named men.

The ﬁrst annual contest of the Intercollegiate Flying Association was held at
Mitchel Field, Garden City, Long Island, and the ships were furnished by the
United States Government. The contest consisted of ﬁve events, of which it became
necessary to omit the ﬁfth because of lack of time. The ﬁrst event was a cross-

country race, which was to have been four laps around a twenty-ﬁve mile course.
Delay in starting compelled the cutting down of this event to a single lap. Each
of the eleven colleges in the Association entered a plane in the race, Pitt’s ma-
chine being piloted by Louis Dussere, with A. W. Schoﬁeld as passenger. Yale
won the race, their time being sixteen minutes, with Lehigh second. Pitt was

oﬂicially given third place, the Pitt machine covering the course in seventeen
minutes and thirty seconds.

The second event of the contest was an acrobatic contest, in which each college
entered a single plane. Each entry was given time to secure sufficient altitude, and
then went through a seven minute period of stunting, while army ﬂiers watched
from the ground and judged the merits of the exhibition. The ﬂier was required
to remain above 1500 feet, under penalty of disqualiﬁcation for stunting lower.
A. W. Schoﬁeld represented Pitt in this event, but failed to secure a place, first
place going to Columbia, second to Yale, and third to Penn.

The next event was an accuracy test in landing to a mark. Entrants were
required to circle the ﬁeld, and then shut off their motors and glide down and land,
aiming for a mark. The distance was then measured, and the ships’ rated accord-
ingly. Pitt was represented in this contest by Jacob F. Keller, who won second
place by coming to a stop seventy-ﬁve feet from the mark. First place was won
by a. Princeton representative, who stopped sixty-nine feet from the mark, and third
was given to Williams.

The fourth and ﬁnal event was an alert competition, in which the pilots lay
on bunks without their blouses, leather coats, helmets, and goggles. The ships
were lined up ready to -start. Then a fake German raid was pulled off, a bomb
being dropped, at which a sentry ﬁred a gun as signal. All pilots then sprang up
put on their ﬂying equipment as quickly as possible, ran to their ships, and as
quickly as they could get their motors started they took to the air. The ﬁrst ship
to get its wheels off the ground won. This contest was won by Williams, whose
time was sixty seconds. Weslyan was second with a time of sixty-six seconds, and
Yale third in seventy-two seconds. Pitt was represented by Louis Dussere, who
failed to place.

The approach of darkness prevented the holding of the other contest, which
was to have been an altitude test.

The scoring in the above-described meet was by points, ﬁrst place counting
ﬁve points, second place three points, and third place one point. The ﬁnal results
of the competition were as follows: Yale, nine points, Williams, six, Columbia and
Princeton, ﬁve each, Pitt four, Wesleyan and Lehigh three each, and Penn one.
Harvard, Cornell, and Rutgers failed to score.

Army ofﬁcers who conducted the contest declared it to be highly successful,
and recommended that such contests be held frequently in the future. That
Pitv.’s score was no better may be attributed in part at least to the fact that
the Pitt men were able to secure but little practice, the need of ships at Mitchel
Field precluding the possibility of more than half an hour's ﬂying for each as
all the practice they were able to secure before the events. In order to avoid such
a contingency for future meets, the Pitt Aero Club announces that it will soon
launch a drive to secure subscriptions with which to purchase a plane for the use
of members of the Club only.

The Association wound up its meet by a business session, at which oﬁicers were
elected, and a banquet, at which prizes were presented. . The officers of the Associa-
tion for the ensuing year are, President, M. H. Pyne, Princeton; Vice-President,
E. H. Kelton, Harvard; Secretary, R. M. Curry, Columbia; and Treasurer, Louis
Dussere, Pitt. Each of the contestants ﬁnishing in ﬁrst, second, or third place in
each event was given a medal. Captain Bruce Eytinge also presented each of the
men with a copy of his “Log Book for Pilots". Pitt men brought back two bronze
third-prize medals, and one silver second-prizemedal, besides three copies of the
above-mentioned book.

On Friday night, February 27, 1920, the class of 1921 met at the Schenley Hotel
for the social affair of the year, the Junior Prom. Five hundred people were present
when at 9:30 P. M. Herbert Mccracken Chairman of the Committee led the grand
march with Miss Marcella Whittaker.

At three A. M. on Saturday morning, February 28, 1920 as Ban Joes Jazz Or-
chestra lingered upon the last note of the home waltz, it ended, and between those
hours a veritable garden of beautiful girls and proud youths swayed and danced to
the rhythm and melody of the orchestra.

There was nothing missing, each had a good time. The chaperons were; Mrs.
S. B. McCormick, and Mr. and Mrs. Charles Miller.

PANHELLENIC ASSOCIATION

The Panhellenic Association of the University of Pittsburgh consists of two
delegates from each chapter of the National Women’s fraternities represented at
Pitt and from such locals as they see ﬁt to admit. The delegates from any one
chapter are one alumnae and one active member. A silent member, who is to be
the active representative the following year may also be present. The purpose of
the association is to ﬁx the date of bidding, to regulate the rules of rushing, to at-
tend to other matters of local Panhellenic interest, and to encourage the chapters to
take an active interest in all college activities for the common good. Meetings are
held once a month at the different fraternity houses and special meetings are called
at noon on the campus.

Panhellenic has this year taken charge of the furnishing of the Rest Rooms of
the Activities House. Up to the date of this writing, there are nine nationals and
one local fraternity represented in the Panhellenic.

STUDENT CHEMICAL SOCIETY

The Student Chemical Society is a student organization whose purpose is to
promote interest in the science of chemistry, and foster a spirit of good fellowship
among the students who are interested. Although any student of the University
taking a course in chemistry is eligible for membership, at the present time most of
the members are School of Chemistry students.

The society was ﬁrst organized in 1914, and since that time has been a steadily
growing organization. During the past year its most important activity has been
the holding of monthly luncheons, after which an expert in some technical line de-
livers an address. Several members of the Chemistry faculty are usually present
at these luncheons.

The International Relations Club

This club was formerly known as the International Polity Club, but has changed
names so as to more clearly designate its purpose. The organization is not a new
one at Pitt. It existed and carried on activities even before our entrance into the
World War. The all-absorbing need for whipping Germany during the S. A. T. C.
period eclipsed everything else, and consequently the activities of the club were
temporarily suspended. This year it came back strong, and with greater promise
for its success than ever. Somewhere about the middle of December, the pre-
liminary organization meeting was held in State Hall. Dean Wright of the school
of Economics spoke on “Economic Imperialism, the Case for the Defense”, at that
gathering. No business was transacted, other than receiving the signatures of pros-
pective members. About 50 students signiﬁed their intention of joining the organi-
zation. Dr. L. K. Manley, instructor of political science in the School of Economics,
now the faculty advisor of the club, who presided at that meeting, expatiated on
the aim and scope of the club. '

The next meeting of importance was held about six Weeks afterwards in
Memorial hall, where the following ofﬁcers were elected: Aubrey W. Schoﬂield,
president; Eva Goldstein, secretary, and Esler W. Hays, vice-president. Because of
the unforseen interference of general assemblies, no meeting could be held for
several weeks after that. On Friday, March 12, Dr. Gettell of Amherst College

delivered an interesting talk on the various aspects of international politics at the
Turnverein Auditorium.

The aim of the organization, as suggested in its name, is to promote interest
in and intelligent discussion and understanding of international relations. To attain
this end, the officers of the organization plan to have not only capable speakers
address the club, but also intend in the near future to institute systematic study of
some phase of world politics, such as the League of Nations, and Peace Treaty ques-
tions. The organization is in possession of an extensive library and collection of
syllabi on politics in its international aspects. All this literature will be available
to those members who wish to avail themselves of its use. The organization has
enjoyed a steady growth since its inception, now numbering nearly eighty members,
including both students and teachers.

Menorah Society

The Menorah Society of Pittsburgh was organized in the year 1914 at a special
meeting of students called by Dr. J. Leonard Levy at the Rodeph Shalom Temple.
The deep interest of Dr. Levy in the Society after the oranization was effected was
greatly responsible for its subsequent growth and success. Meetings are held by the
Society every other Tuesday evening at the Rodeph Shalom Temple.

The Menorah Society of Pittsburgh is aﬂiliated with the Intercollegiate Menorah
Association, chapters of which are found in almost every educational institution in
the country. Its program is the study and promotion of Jewish culture and ideals.
This is being accomplished by lectures and discussions that form a prominent feature
of every meeting. The Society is frequently addressed by prominent out of town
speakers, sent to it by the Intercollegiate Menorah Association. The activities of the
Society are not, however, limited to literary‘ matters. Various socials are held at in-
tervals and general good fellowship is always emphasized.

The Menorah Society is open to every student, the only qualiﬁcation being an
interest in Judaism and anything pertaining to it.

“Le Cercle Francais”

“Le Cercle Francais" is an organization open to all students of French at Pitt.

Its purpose is to give the students an opportunity to use French conversation, and V

to put into practice the principles learned in class. The idea of such an organiza-
tion Was conceived by the faculty, who realized how diiﬁcult it is for the students
to get suﬂicient practice in speaking French during class hours. At a meeting of
the French students, Miss Henry proposed the formation of a French Club, a sug-
gestion that was enthusiastically received, and the present French Club resulted.

“Le Cercle Francais” meets the second and fourth Wednesdays of every month.
The members converse with one another in French, and the business sessions are
conducted in the same language. Games, and singing of French songs are also a
part of the regular programs of the “Cercle”.

PITT WEEKLY STAFF

The Pitt Weekly

The Pitt VVeekly is the ofﬁcial student and alumni journal of the University
and is published every Wednesday of the college year. Previous publications which
have been superseded by the Vveekly were the Pennsylvania Western (1882-88) and
the Courant (1888-1910), both monthly literary publications. The achievement of
the 1319-1920 staff has been the publication of an eight-page paper. The Weekly
has always been a powerful factor in undergraduate life, and in the past few years
has become equally inﬂuential and helpful in alumni activities, proving itself an
effective protagonist for such progressive plans of the Alumni Association as the
Alumni Building Campaign. It has 6,500 student and alumni subscribers.

PITT REVIEW STAFF

The Pitt Review

The Pitt Review is the ofﬁcial literary magazine of the University and is com-
posed and edited by the students in the interest of literary appreciation and the
stimulation of original literary effort. Short stories, poems, plays, essays and criti-
cisms are also contributed by alumni and faculty members whose interests lie in
the ﬁeld of literature.

The Review was founded in May, 1919, and is the youngest of Pitt’s publica-
tions. It is published bimonthly.

During the past year the Review has been especially interested in stories of
local setting, a prize of $100, known as the William Johnston Short Story Prize in
honor of the donor, William Johnston, ’91, author of “Limpy,” being awarded to
the student author of the best story of 1000 ‘to 5000 words, having a Pittsburgh
locale.

The Review takes this opportunity to invite the co-operation of every student
and wishes to encourage in the University the spirit of literary activity which the
Review is endeavoring to foster.

Athletics, 1919

 

The favorable reaction in the realm of sport felt since the great war, affected
Pitt as well as every other university. The year 1919 saw the Gold and Blue re-
presented in almost every branch of sport—football, basketball, track, swimming
and tennis. This year sees a. revival in baseball and boxing—and a new sport, a.via-
tion, makes its initial bow, Pitt being the seventh charter member admitted to the
Inter—collegiate Flying Association.

The football team enjoyed a successful season although it did not come through
unscathed as had been the custom for several years previous. The squad went into
training at Camp Hamilton, Windber, Pa., its old habitat. Here Coach Glenn
Warner was glad to welcome back such former stars as Capt. DeHart, Andy Hast-
ings, and Jim Morrow recently discharged from active army service. With such
proven ability as a nucleus and with some clever talent hanging over from last
year, things looked good for a repetition of past successes. But it seems Pitt was
not alone in its good fortune; for after the smoke of battle rolled away, Syracuse
University and Penn State College had left the ﬁeld with Panther scalps.

It had taken ﬁve years to humble the Blue and Gold-—the last defeat being that
suffered at the hands of W. & J. in 19-14. The shutout administered by State was
the ﬁrst hung up against the Panthers since 1913, when Bucknell turned the
tables, 9 to 0.

The 1919 track team, led by Capt. Frank Shea, gave a good account of itself.
Victories in the Baltimore Relays, and the A. M. A. Track championships were espe-
cially pleasing. The victory over State in the annual Pitt-Penn State dual meet
was sweet music to the entire student body. First place was also won in the
A. M. A. Cross-country championships, J. Earl Weigel crossing the ﬁnish line first
for Pitt.

The 1920 basketball team captained by Harry Levine, was one of the best the
university ever had. First place was captured in the Inter-collegiate Tri-State
league. The season opened against Yale University at Trees gym, before a record
crowd. Pitt was nosed out at the ﬁnish, 26 to 25. Old rivals, West Virginia and
W. & J. were bested in series games. State was the only team to turn the tables
successfully on two occasions. The girl’s basketball team, captained by Miss Anna
Klingensmith, continued its splendid record and again enjoyed an undefeated
season.

The 1919 tennis year was not quite so successful as past seasons. But this
year, Manager Murray promises us something better. He has arranged a very at-
tractive schedule and has a line on some good material that should make a winning
varsity.

Swimming returned this year after a. long rest. Meets were held with some of
the leading teams in the East, the team giving a good account of itself. Manager
Tom Thornton says that in Harry Taylor, Pitt has one of the best all-around inter-
collegiate swimmers.

The freshmen football and basketball teams were of such calibre that it was
mighty hard for the student body to approve of the one year residence rule. The

junior teams mowed down just about everything that crossed their paths. “Next

year’s sophs” will make themselves felt when the varsity coaches are selecting the
personnel for their teams next year.

It is a little too soon to predict the futures of baseball, boxing, and aviation.
It might be said that everything looks rosy and that the old Pitt spirit is in evi-
dence which is just about everything. As for aviation, the Inter—co11egiate Flying
Association, of which Pitt is a charter member is planning to hold a cross-country
race, and if the race materializes, Pitt will have an entry.

 

Winners of the “P”

The Varsity “P” is awarded to men who have participated in a certain number
of varsity athletic contests, including in most branches of sport, the Washington
& Jefferson and Pennsylvania State College games. The successful candidate in

track must secure not less than 10 points in one season, or a total of 15 points
during his college career.

The 1919 Eleven

The year 1919 wrought several changes in the football World that occasioned
many an ejaculation of surprise. Elevens that looked like sure winners were de-
feated by supposedly much weaker teams, and not infrequently by decisive scores.

Pitt’s football team, coached by Glenn Warner, began the season in a convinc-
ing fashion. Geneva was defeated 32 to 2. and West Virginia, with a team admitted
by the majority of critics to be one of the strongest in the country, was humbled
26 to 0. Then came the surprise. The following Saturday Syracuse University
was played at Syracuse. Pitt was defeated 24 to 3—the ﬁrst defeat suffered at
the hands of a college team since the 1914 W. & J. game. Four years Without a
defeat is a record of which to be proud and one that should live long in the annals
of the game.

The Syracuse reversal came as a hard blow to Pitt followers and many feared
that it was the beginning of a losing streak. But the Pitt spirit asserted itself;
the following Saturday Georgia Tech was beaten 16 to 6. Then Lehigh fell, 14 to
O. W. & J. was the next victim, 7 to 6. The following Saturday Pennsylvania
was played at Philadelphia, the ﬁnal score resulting in a tie, 3 to 3. A Week
later Carnegie Tech was humbled 17 to 7.

The annual Thanksgiving Day game with Penn State drew the usual large
crowd. State had one of the best teams in its history, and the best in the East.
Pitt fell 20 to 0. State’s victory was clean and decisive.

The Pitt team had to contend with the hardest schedule of any in the country
and there is little doubt that it would have made good on its ambitious contract had
Coach Warner had heavier material at his disposal and had the squad been less
hampered by injuries.

It would be somewhat diﬂicult to determine the regular line-up due to the
havoc wrought by those injuries. Suﬂice to say that Ewing, Eckert, Ginn and
McCrory alternated at ends; Harman, Bond and Mervis were the tackles; McLean
and Meanor, the guards; and Stein, the center. The famous “Flying Squadron”:
Hastings, DeHart, Morrow and Davies, composed the backﬁeld at the beginning of
the season. But Captain DeHart and Jim Morrow were lost to the team before the
season was fairly started, due to injuries. The position left vacant by DeHart was
well ﬁlled by Laughran. Versatile Herb McCracken, who had been holding down a
regular end job, replaced Morrow and proved to be a valuable backﬁeld man. The
substitutes had unusual opportunity during the season to display their talent.

The team was well cared for by its popular student manager, “Bill” Foster,
Economics ’20. Stein was elected Captain for the 1920 team.

Résumé of the Season

PITT, 32; GENEVA, 2
(October 4)

The ﬁrst Saturday in October, the Panthers, then an unknown quantity, faced
the strong combination of gridders representing Geneva College at Beaver Falls.
Just what the outcome of the game would be was rather uncertain although it was
expected that Pitt would win. And they did. DeHart and Hastings, stars of old,
played brilliantly. There were many new faces to be seen in the regular line-up.
The way they acquitted themselves gave ample evidence that Coach Warner had
picked men qualiﬁed to ﬁll the gaps left by graduation. There was one sad feature
about the game; Daugherty, one of the best end prospects, received a fractured leg

which eliminated him for the rest of the season. His loss was a severe blow to the
Panther extremities.

PITT, 26; WEST VIRGINIA, 0.
(October, 11)

The following Saturday marked one of the most exciting games of the season.
West Virginia, with a powerful team, invaded Pittsburgh fully expecting to annihilate
the Panthers. But the Panthers didn’t seem to be quite ready for annihilation.
Out-fought, out-thought, out—lucked, the heavy West Virginians were unable to cope
with the Panther machine. The Pitt back—ﬁeld “the ﬂying squadron”, covered itself
with almost as much glory as mud. The Pitt line, supposed to be more of a liability
than an asset, turned out to be a well forged steel wall. In fact it was quite a vic-

tory for Pitt. The answer to the query “who starred” would be “the whole
team”.

PITT, 3; SYRACUSE, 24.
(October 18)

This is the game we would like to forget. It was on this occasion that Pitt
suffered its ﬁrst defeat in ﬁve seasons. We hand it to Syracuse; they turned the
trick in a very capable manner. The Orange team gave decided evidence of genuine
superiority, in both offense and defense. Pitt fought hard and with the best that
was in them, but to no avail. Andy Hastings’ ﬁeld goal from the thirty-yard line
was all that saved Pitt from a shut-out.

PITT, 16; GEORGIA TECH, 6.
(October 25)

The Georgians came North last Fall with a powerful team and a desire for re-
venge that boded ill for Coach Warner's proteges. Pitt was not in the best of shape
due to the strenuous encounter at ‘Syracuse the previous Saturday. A little thing like
that didn’t bother the Panthers, however. Pitt started early and before the visitors
had a chance to draw breath had registered two touchdowns. The second half Was.
not quite so one-sided. The Georgians came back with new life and fought as only
Southerners can. On two occasions they stopped Pitt drives on their one-yard line.

Tom Davies was Pitt’s out-standing player. Herb Mccracken and Abe Breman

also did ﬁne work. Stein, Mervis, Harman and McLean, distinguished themselves.
in the line.

PITT, 14; LEHIGH, 0.
(November 1)

When the Panthers faced Lehigh at South Bethlehem, it was noticed that the
line-up had undergone a decided change. There were as many substitutes as regulars
selected to cope with the Brown and White. Injuries, and the fact that “Pop” had
his eye on the W. & J. game a week later were the reasons. But the team, however
weak it may have seemed, was able to come through victor. Three times Pitt had
the ball inside the Lehigh ﬁve—yard line but was unable to shove it across. Ten
minutes before the ﬁnal whistle blew, Tom Davies decided it was time to get busy
and uncorked two sensational ﬁfty yard runs that resulted in touchdowns. It was
wonderful foot-ball. The game ended without any more scoring.

PITT, 7; W. & J., 6.
(November 8)

Before one of the greatest crowds that ever assembled at Forbes Field, Pitt de-
feated W. & J. for the ﬁfth successive time. Syracuse’s defeat at the hands of the
Red and Black had rendered Pitt’s chance for victory rather dubious. But before
the game was a quarter old it was seen that W. & J. had her hands full. It was
Pitt’s game from start to ﬁnish, the 7 to 6 victory hardly doing justice to the
superior team play evidenced by the Panthers. The contest signalized the rising
of a new back-ﬁeld star “Speedo" Laughran by name. His work was sensational and
was a material factor in having Pitt come out on top.

PITT, 3; PENN, 3.
(November 15)

The Penn game, staged at Philadelphia, was one. of Pitt's most gruelling con-
tests. Both teams were evenly matched and both had a fair share of the breaks.
With fortune favoring ﬁrst one and then the other, with ﬁrst one goal line and then
the other menaced, the two teams battled on such even terms that anything else but a
tied score would have been tragic. Bell, Penn's quarter-back, scored ﬁrst for the
Quakers, kicking a ﬁeld goal from the thirty-yard line. Pitt evened the score in the
second period when Hastings scored from the thirty-ﬁve yard line with a placement
kick. That marked the end of the scoring. Andy Hastings was Pitt's outstand-
ing luminary but he had company in Morrow and Laughran. Stein, McCracken,
Eckert, Bond and Meanor did great work in the line.

PITT, 1'7; CARNEGIE TECH, 7.
(November 22)

The annual Pitt-Tech game was characterized last Fall with a good many more
than eleven men on each side. Such evidences of school spirit, however, merely added
zest to the encounter; the only horriﬁed onlookers were those who had placed money
on Tech. Tech scored ﬁrst when Marshall, her clever half-back, intercepted a for-
ward pass on his own seven yard line and ran the length of the ﬁeld for a touch-
down. Pitt came back strong in the second half rolling up seventeen points against
none for the Plaid.

PITT, 0‘; PENN-STATE, 20*.
(November 27)

For the ﬁrst time since 1913, Pitt went down to defeat before her rivals from
Center County. The ﬁnal score was 20 to 0. It was indeed a Thanksgiving day
for State as it was her game from start to ﬁnish. Pitt did her mightiest but it didn't
accomplish much. Higgins, State's great end, scored early in the game when he
received a forward pass from Hess and ran ninety yards for a touchdown. Higgins,
Hess, and Way stood out prominently for State. Mccracken, Hastings and Ewing
distinguished themselves for Pitt.

Baseball, 1920

For three years Pitt has not been represented on the diamond. A caucus of
baseball enthusiasts in the school, however, determined that the year of 1920 should
be an exception. The enthusiasm started at Windber last Fall, where the football
team was in training; and ended in a petition for the sport’s revival signed by
nearly every student. With the approval of the Athletic Council, Graduate Manager
K. E. Davis secured the services of an excellent coach, Dick Harley, a man of wide
experience. J. F. Regis Toomey was appointed student manager.

The schedule includes two long trips, one as far south as Georgia where the
University of Georgia will be met and the other an eastern jaunt that will include
West Point, Fordham, Georgetown, and Swarthmore. Coach Harley expects to
have a strong team representing the Gold and Blue. He is quite conﬁdent that
there is plenty of good baseball material in school and lots of spirit.

Basketball, i920

When Pitt defeated West Virginia on March sixth, 1920, one of the most suc-
cessful seasons in her basketball history was placed among the archives of the past.
No doubt the most brilliant feat of the year was the indisputable claim to the
Tri-State championship which Pitt obtained through the fact that the Panther de-
feated W. & J. three times, won two of three from West Virginia, and secured a
victory by decisive scores in each of the three games played with Allegheny, Grove
City, and Geneva respectively. All this was accomplished in spite of the fact that
during much of the season Herb. McCracken, one of this year’s stars, was out of
the game on account of injuries, and that Harry Levine, the brilliant Panther cap-
tain, was also out of several games.

Captain Harry Levine, in his last year in a Panther uniform played a remark-
able game. Robinson, also in his senior year, was a star at center, until Mc-
Cracken's injuries had left a gap at forward, when he ﬁlled in admirably. His
place was taken by Reisgen, who proved himself a game-saver on several occa-
sions. Laughran, fresh from victories on the football ﬁeld, also won new laurels
for himself, because of the manner in which he played a forward position.

The only dark spot on an otherwise almost perfect season was the double
defeat administered by Pennsylvania State College. The fact remains that State
had one of the best ﬁves it has ever known, while Pitt, in both its games, was
handicapped by injuries to stars.

R. K. McCurdy, ’21, was manager for the year, and handled matters capably.
No captain has yet been appointed for next season. Dr. George M. Flint again
coached the team.

Track, 1919

Taken as a whole, Pitt’s 1919 track season was very satisfactory to the student
body. Under the leadership of Capt. Frank Shea, quarter-miler par excellence, the
team scored some notable victories. -

The season was ﬁttingly opened March 15th, when the Gold and Blue won the
A. M. A. Track Championships. In the Baltimore Relays held at Baltimore, Md.
the relay team showed the stuff of which it was made by annexing ﬁrst place. At
the Meadowbrook Club Track Meet at Philadelphia the relay team ﬁnished a close
second, Penn-State copping ﬁrst honors. All Pitt was hoping that Frank Shea
would turn in his old time or better at the I. C. A. A. A. meet at Cambridge, Mass.,
but an unfortunate injury to his leg sustained in a preliminary heat eliminated him
from the ﬁnals. Pitt’s victory over Penn-State in the dual meet held at State
rounded out a successful season. Two Pitt records were broken in this meet, Perry
Addleman lowering the mile record to 4:27 2/5, and “Red” Weigel the two-mile
record to 9:53 2/5. The occasion of the A. M. A. Cross-Country championships

saw Pitt come out victor amidst a galaxy of entries. “Red" Weigel was the ﬁrst
to cross the ﬁnish line._

J. Earl Weigel, Pitt’s classy distance artist, was selected to lead the 1920
team.

Swimming— 1920

This season for the ﬁrst time in years, Pitt was represented in the swimming
world. The varsity, directed by Coach John T. Taylor, with an ambitious schedule
arranged by Manager Thornton, came into contact with some of the best teams in the
country. The ﬁrst dual meet was held at Erie against their crack Y. M. C. A. Pitt
lost by a close score but later turned the tables on their victors when they met them
at the East Liberty Y. In early February the team made an Eastern trip.. In
Baltimore it met a team composed of some of the best swimmers of the colleges
and clubs of that district and though our men put up a stiff ﬁght they fell before the
strong opposition. At Annapolis the following night before recovering from the
effects of the previous meet and the long trip, they came out on the short end of a
tussle with Navy, the strongest college team of the East. In March Pitt won from
the Cleveland Central Y. M. C. A. by a comfortable score. There is a possibility of
meets with Syracuse, Rochester and Buffalo later on but this, however, is merely
tentative.

The personnel at the beginning was composed of Taylor, Messerly, Thornton,
Marshall, Corr, Kistler, Simpson, Moulton and Bauer. ‘Later came Thoma and
Foster. The best individual work was done by Taylor who scored the most points.

Tennis

Unusually heavy showers last Spring did their best to dampen the ardor and
the courts of Pitt’s Tennis enthusiasts. All in all things were not auspicious. To
add to the difﬁculties of the tennis coach, Dr. T. W. Stephens, who, by the way, will
be with us again this season, there were no letter men available because of the de-
predations of the War.

The fellows who cheerfully came out last year in spite of all the clouds were
H. Haines, (Manager) Smith, Lewis, Monk, Merritt and Schmertz. They’ll all be
with us again this year and, with the help of a host of new candidates will start us
once more to our old proud place in the tennis world.

\V. & J. and Penn State, exceptional minor sports teams, athletes who ‘win their
letters in three or more branches of athletics, track record holders, coaches, di-
rectors of athletics, graduate managers of athletics, athletic council chairmen, and
such other individuals .as have signally advanced the athletic reputation of the Uni-
versity, all find a place here. The following are now in the Hall of Fame:

Football teams of 1913, 1914, 1915, 1916, 1917, 1918 and 1919.
Basketball Teams of 1915, 1916, 1917 and 1920.

Freshman Football Team—1919

It is to be doubted whether Pitt has ever had or ever will have a freshman
football team that could be compared with last season’s. It was a team of teams;

one that held its own against the varsity more often than the varsity would care to
mention.

When on September 30th, Coach, Andy Kerr issued the call for all ﬁrst
year candidates, about sixty husky athletes responded, most of them with A-1
scholastic football reputations. There was plenty of material to work with but little
time, since the ﬁrst game was to be played in less than two weeks. But Coach Kerr
was the man for the job. In the short time he had he shaped a team that over-
whemingly defeated Bellefonte Academy in the ﬁrst game of the season. Later,
West Virginia Reserves, Indiana Normal, Tech Plebes, and Penn-State Freshmen also
fell by the wayside. One defeat marred an otherwise perfect season——-the 7 to 6
setback suffered at the hands of Kiski.

The victory over the State Freshmen was particularly sweet to the Freshie ad-

herents. The game was played at State College and was full of thrills from start
to ﬁnish.

It is unfortunate that the playing season of the Freshmen is so limited. Coach
Kerr's team last season could have waged successful wars on quite a few of the big
Eastern prep. schools.

The men on whose shoulders fell the bulk of the season's burden were Clawson,
Hartnett, and Stoyer, ends; Williams, Sacklowsky, and Edgar, tackles; Bowser,
Clark, and Snyder, guards; Magarral, center; and in the back-ﬁeld, Captain Hol-
leran, Hendrian, Hewitt, Anderson and Byers.

Freshman Basketball, 1920

The Pitt freshman basketball team made a splendid record during the season
just closed, and was beyond question the best cub team the Panthers ever had.
Every member would have made‘ a strong bid for a varsity position had he been
eligible. ‘

The yearlings lost only two games and both of them to teams which they
‘also defeated. The teams which conquered them were Indiana Normal and New

Brighton High. Jordan was out of the New Brighton game and the team was
weakened as a consequence.

The team’s biggest feat was the double victory scored over the Penn-State
Freshmen.

Nineteen games were played, 10 of them away from home, The regulars were
Jordan and Mervis or Rose at forward, Clawson at center and Capt. Pollock and
Shanor at guards.

The record for the season is as follows:

Girls’ Basketball Varsity

Pitt Co-Eds exhibited a great interest in basketball and made the season of
1920 a success. They met some of the best girls teams in Western Pennsylvania,
including the Waynesburg, Beaver, Geneva and P. C. W. sextets, and defeated them

all with decisive scores. This is the sixth season of girls’ basketball at Pitt, during
which time they have not lost a collegiate game.

H. H. Provin, for the third year, coached the team and its success was due to
his efforts. Anna Klingensmith, side center, Mary Stokes, Blanche Parker, and
Grace Gilson, forwards, Eleanor Steele and Laura Schafer, guards and Lulu With-
row, center, were retained from last year. Myrtle Wilson and Ethel James at

guard, made the team this year. With such an abundance of good material, it was
difﬁcult to choose the lineup.

Anna Klingensmith captained the team. Laura Schafer was Manager, assisted
by Katherine Saunders. Miss Saunders has been appointed for the year 1921, with
Mary Zeigler as assistant and Mr. Provin is expected to coach the team next season.

Freshman Girls’ Basketball Season, 1920

The 1920 Freshman girls’ basketball team was an unbeatable combination.
Were it not for the freshman rule, observed at Pitt in girls as well as boys athletics,
a number of these players would have made a strong bid for the varsity team.

The sextet trounced some of the strongest high school teams in the city. The
closest score to which they were held by a high school was 29 to 19, on the Schenley
ﬂoor. At Slippery Rock the Freshies broke the Normalities record with a defeat of
28 to 24.

The forwards, Mary Chapman from Peabody, and Anna Anderson from Schen-
ley, featured every game. “Kit” McNamara, center, and “Kit” Roehan, side center,
both from South Hills, played well together. Florence Montgomery, former Wilkins-
burg star, and Grace Love, from Schenley did some phenomenal work at guard.
Elizabeth Dutney, Al1egheny’s prize center, who came to Pitt at the end of the sea-
son, made her debut in Pitt Basketball at Slippery Rock and played a fast game.
Many of the “subs", among whom were Agnes Allison, Edith MacLeod, Catherine
Zerfoos, and Levina Katten, almost ranked with the regulars.

Florence Montomery was captain for 1920, and Katherine Saunders manager,
assisted by Mary Zeigler. Miss Zeigler has been appointed manager for the next
season. H. H. Provin coached the team.

Air: Stein Song from “Prince of Pilsen.”
Come, brothers, sing the old song again,
Our paean to Alma Mater,
We who have followed her beacon light
And marched ’neath her banner fair,
Sing of her fame in the days gone by
And the glory the years have brought Her;
Her colors we wear, Her honors We share,
Then sing till the Winds reply:

Here’s to the University,
Here’s to the Gold and Blue,

Here’s to Alumni and Faculty,
Here’s to Her Students true,

Here’s to Her fame in years to come,
Bright shall Her laurels be,

Here’s to Old Pittsburgh the glorious,
Here’s to the U. of P.

Our"Old Pittsburgh, dear Old Pittsburgh
With love that never tires
Thy loyal sons in homage stand
About Thine altar ﬁres;
Though in the strife of after-life
Far from Thy shrine we be,
Our loyal hearts will ever burn
With love, dear Pitt, for Thee,
Our loyal hearts will ever burn
With love, dear Pitt, for Thee.

On the ﬁeld they go,
To face the foe,

With a spirit strong and mighty;
When the whistle blows,

They are on their toes,

To defeat their prey by ﬁghting;
While high o’er the throng,
We'll play and sing this song,
To the boys who fought to win;
Then we’ll give our yell,

Over hill and dell,

You’ll hear our echoes ring,
P-I—T-T, P-I—T-T,

P-I double T, Pittsburgh.

Chorus
O’er smoky Pittsburgh,

O’er the country wide,

Far spread the stories of our dear old Uni’s pride;

Far spread the stories of our dear old Uni’s pride;

O’er the hills and dells, the crashing echoes answering call,
Pittsburgh victorious, the champions of all.

When the battle’s won,

And the day is done,

And they’re talked of o'er the nation;
When they’ve beaten all,
Whether large or small,

And they fear no combination;
When they ﬁght with might,
For old Pittsburgh's right,
Their old Uni’s love and pride,
Then we’ll let them hear

Our old Uni’s cheer

We'll shout with all our might
P-I-——T-T, P-I—T-T,

P-I double T, Pittsburgh".

Hail to Pitt

Down in Smokytown, in Pennsylvania,
In Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh,

We have a University we’re proud of,
Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh,

She stands a mighty fortress ’neath her colors bright,
Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh,

When forth she goes to battle ’gainst a stubborn foe
This song will upward go:

When the grand old days of football come around,
In Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh,

Her meters at the ﬁeld will make an awful sound,
For Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh,

Down across the ﬁeld her mighty line moves on,
For Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh,

They’ll sweep the foe before them till the goal is won
Then you’ll hear them shout:

Chorus

Hail to Pitt! Hail to Pitt! every loyal son,
Hail to Pitt! Hail to Pitt! ’till the victory’s won,
The Gold and Blue shall wave forever
On high, through fair and stormy weather,
We'll sing her praises far and wide
Until the end of time.

Hoop-hurray! Hoop Hurray for dear old Uni,

Give her a grand old Alleghenee-genac-genac,
We’ll wave and cheer for many a year

And sing her songs out loud and clear,
For our University.

Air: Austrian National Anth.em

Alma Mater, wise and glorious,

Child of Light and Bride of Truth,

Over fate and foe victorious,

Dowered with eternal youth,

Crowned with love of son and daughter,
Thou shalt conquer as of yore,

Dear old Pittsburgh, Alma Mater,

God preserve Thee evermore!

First beyond the mountains founded,
Where the West-road opens free,
Where twin rivers forest bounded,
Merge and journey toward the sea,
In the dawning of the nation

Ere the clouds of strife had cleared,
’Rose Thy rough—hewn habitation,
By our prophet fathers reared.

Close Thy mother-love embraces

All who gather at Thy knee,

Caste and classes, creeds and races,
Mother, are as one to Thee;

Thou who unto knowledge bore us

In the good old days long gone,
Raise Thy Gold and Blue high o'er us
Lead and we will follow on.

Alma Mater, wise and glorious,

Child of Light and Bride of Truth,
Over fate and foe victorious,

Dowered with eternal youth,

Crowned love of son and daughter,

Thou shalt conquer as of yore,

Dear old Pittsburgh, Alma Mater,

God preserve Thee evermore.

Retrospective

No one who has not gone through the throes of putting out an Owl, or nf
some task equal to it in magnitude can properly appreciate the size of the task or
the relief that is ours at feeling that at last our work is done. It has been no
small undertaking, this gathering proper and accurate information about four
thousand students, forty-eight fraternities, scores of activities, the faculty, the
athletic records, and all the rest of the information that tradition has decreed should
enter into the annual Owl. Now that the task is completed and we are ready to
look back at the result, we do so with much trepidation. The Owl presented here-
with is not all that we had hoped it would be; it is not even all we tried to make
it; but it represents the product of earnest and painstaking efforts over many anxi-
ous months; it represents the labor of many days spent in quest of information, or
in selection of what should and what should not enter into the makeup of the
book; in cutting and pasting together the material which an efﬁcient staff poured
in. It has been our effort to make of this Owl more than a mere record of under-
graduate achievement. We have tried to make it something which those who have
a part herein will be glad to look back to. If this book is pleasing to those Whose
shelves it will adorn; if the owners will cherish it as a precious souvenir of the
pleasant days spent at the University of Pittsburgh; if they will look back to it
gladly as a worthwhile token of the work and the accompanying joys at Pitt, we
will feel that in a great measure our work has not been done in vain.

Intellectuality stretches all the way from

with ﬂying colors.

Katherine Finley K A 9

Pittsburgh, Pa.

“Girls! This is your last day to get

chology she knows is appalling.

Helena K. Flinn K K 1"

Pittsburgh, Pa.

Helena was College Editor last year
and so could not do herself justice.
We’ll say it for her now. Good-look-
ing, capable of work on occasions, well-
liked. Who could ask for more?

Irene Franklin

Munhall, Pa.

very, very good.

THE COLLEGE

Sarah M. Gibson

Braddock, Pa.

Braddock High School

Tears no more are shed by her over
her curls. She would even go so far

cipline the Freshmen.

Erma Gill K A 6)

Pittsburgh, Pa.

Peabody High School

Y. W. C. A.; W. A. A.; French Club;

The Classical Club is staunchly sup-
ported by Angelina. She has a vast and
extended Latin vocabulary.

Elizabeth J. Hulton, “Bettie” A Z

Oakmont, Pa.

Oakmont High School

Beattie hasn’t grown one bit in size
since she came to the University, but
as to popularity and intellectuality——oh,
my! In spite of her common expres-
sion, “I’m so tired,” she has had energy
enough to distinguish herself in all
kinds of activities.

Stirling Huntley

With the value of anything that is
“Sterling” going up every day, you can
see what he will amount to some day.

Gayle Isensee K A 0

Huntington, W. Va.

Peabody High School

Y. W. C. A.; President W. A. A.; Glee

Club

She has lots of ideas, with pep and
energy to put them through. It’s one
thing to have ideas, you know, and
another to work them out. But Gayle is
Johnny-on-the-spot in that respect.

Katherine R. Johnson K K I‘

Pittsburgh, Pa.

Dilworth Hall

when we have cut a meeting and see

Miss Henrietta Rauh.
She knows a lot, I vow
There’s nothing sends her up a tree;

Conoquenessing, Pa.

Butler High School

Angelyn surprised not only herself
but all her acquaintances when she be-
came so attached to the Languages De-
partments as to take Spanish, Greek,
Italian and German. We wonder if a
trip in foreign lands is soon due.

Martha E. Russell

Isabel Wightman II B (I)

If words were the only means of sal-

hardly think she was a digniﬁed Senior.
Her quiet, unassuming grace has won
for her a place in all our hearts.

We know little about Jimmy although
he has been with us for some time. He
would much rather listen than be listen-
ed to. We have yet to see him speak
to a. co-ed.

“Chip” decided to desert us for the
dental school, but the lure of State Hall
is too much for him, and you may fre-
quently ﬁnd him there, surrounded by
fair ones.

Lester Brinley
Tarentum, Pa.

Tarentum High School

Each day this little man comes from
Tarentum, and just for the sake of an
education. 0! such ambition is killing.

Franz V. Clicquennoi A T A

See the cute little mustache! Franz
loves to come to school, but there are

we’re not mentioning any names, either.

Emanuel Malcolm Fried II A (I) F H 2
Braddock, Pa.

In spite of the fact that Fried comes
to us from Braddock and was blessed
with the name Emanuel Malcolm, he
has grey matter, wit, and personality.

Jacob D. Golding
Pittsburgh, Pa.
Fifth Ave. High School

One of the hardest pluggers in Econ-
omics. He takes everything very seri-
ously, but when he goes‘ for a good time,
he surely must have it.

Clark W. Green A T A
Erie, Pa.

Student Senate (1); Glee Club (1)
(2) (3); Cap & Gown (1); App.
Football Mgr.; Panther Staﬁ (3);
Asst. Baseball Mgr.

Clark is not the kind of a fellow that
his name indicates. He is very active
about the campus, especially when sell-
ing Pitt Panthers.

John H. Elder, Jr., 2 K II
Pittsburgh, Pa.
Peabody High School
Swimming Team (1) (2); Cap &

J ohnny’s size resembles somewhat the
proportions of the railway magnate in
the newspaper cartoons. His size is
overshadowed only by his good nature.
He would like to meet the person who
said “It is quality and not quantity that
counts”.

Kenneth Emmel, “Ken” A X A
Pittsburgh, Pa.
Ken is so busy attending to matters

at school and at home that he doesn’t
ﬁnd time to loaf around any with us.

Joseph B. Feldman
McKeesport, Pa.
McKeesport High School

Washington and Jeﬁerson College
Pitt Weekly (2) (3)

He ought to make a good lawyer if
he always gains his point as he did with
Dr. Marvin. About face. Forward

Why such a rush to get a train for
Crafton, Max, when so many taxies are
at hand? Nuf Sed.

Edgar S. Hassler, Jr. 2 A X
Shelby, Ohio
Band (2); Pitt Weekly (3)

Edgar has been delayed in graduating
by the fuss across the pond. We hear
that he formed the acquaintance of cer-
tain French ladies while over there.

J. B. Held

“Jake” lives up to his name when
debating. He only has time to talk to
co-eds for he is always in a rush.

Howard S. Helt A T A

From all we know, we judge that he
is going to make a good man and we

We thought the riddle unsolvable.
It took us months to discover who Prof.
