Union slowly becomes center of activities

SCHENLEY HALL, the men’s dormitory, is located on
the top ﬁve ﬂoors of the Schenley Union. The resident men
enjoy the luxury of handsomely furnished rooms located in
the center of the Pitt campus.

100

In its second year of operation, the Schenley Union has devel-
oped, as planned, into the center of student activities on cam-
pus. Contained in the three lower floors of what was once the
lavish Schenley Park Hotel, the Union contains facilities for
all phases of student life. On the ground floor, students can
eat lunch in a gleaming pink and chrome cafeteria, or choose
the formal Venetian Room for dinner dates. The student
lounges are comfortable and quiet, while in the Hunt Room,
deep—toned murals of the chase cover the walls, and tables
for two or three (or more on busy days) crowd the red brick
ﬂoor. The grand ballroom is elegant with its white paneled
walls, sparkling mirrors, and huge crystal chandeliers.

The second and third ﬂoors include dining rooms for group
dinners, tasteful reading and music rooms, and the oﬂices of
varied student organizations.

In the top four floors of this building, called Schenley House,
two hundred undergraduate men live in double or triple
rooms. 7

Next door to the Union is Brackenridge House, the under-
graduate women’s residence. A unique feature of this dorm
is its suite plan. Each unit has three double bedrooms, a kitch-
en for snacks, a living room and a bathroom.

The second hall in the seven-building Schenley Quadrangle
was opened this year. Named Bruce Hall, it houses the stu-
dents and offices of the Graduate School of Public and Inter-
national Affairs, and completes one more step toward the time

when the Schenley Quadrangle will be the nucleus of campus
life.

SAVORING the taste of Tuck Shop coffee is made harder
by its soggy paper container. The two elements combine
to make the brew always distinctive; often unforgettable.

A TUCK SHOP BOOTH, shared by a fra-
ternity and a sorority, is almost an entity in
itself. Next to the house, the booth is vitally
important to socializing, rushing, and frater-
nity-sorority relations.

Tuck Shoppers brave paper

108

A visit to the Tuck Shop is a rigidly observed and inseparable
part of the day at Pitt. At about ﬁfteen minutes to eight on
any morning, a coffee and cigarette breakfast is a must before
facing the ﬁrst hour class. Even that early in the morning, a
smoky blue haze is already hovering above the heads of the
crowd; it seems permanently installed in the atmosphere, and
at noon the cloud is even thicker. A muﬂled roar of voices fills
the Tuck Shop as a milling crowd of students clogs the aisles
to eat dry sandwiches and drink more of the paper-cupped
coffee. No matter what the time of day there is always a warm
greeting from half a dozen friends or fraternity brothers who
welcome company while wasting a free hour with little guilt
and much pleasure. Conversations, whether intimate tete—a—
tetes or lively group discussions, are under way every hour of
the day, often accompanied by hands twisting soda straws
into fanciful shapes or dismembering cigarette ﬁlters.

Ever present are the quiet waitresses forever ﬁlling trays
with crumpled paper cups and tattered napkinsélitter left
from hasty snacks and leisurely lunches.

The peeling blue leather seats are uncomfortable, the dim
lights invite eyestrain, and the food is less than delicious, but
the companionship, the atmosphere, and the spirit of the
Tuck Shop more than balance its shortcomings.

Each issue of the PITT NEWS carries reports and stories of
the latest events that take. place in the many bodies that con-
stitute student government at Pitt. SGA votes to appropriate
money for a new organization. IFC and Pan—Hel announce a
date for Greek Week, and so it goes. But this is only the stu-
dent government that is seen by the person not associated
with campus government. To the student on the inside, stu-
dent government is elections, caucusing, campaigning for
candidates, countering charges of the opposition, counting
votes, and sitting up election night waiting for the returns to
come in.

But after the glamor of the political race is over, the real
work of student government begins. What once seemed to be
a desirable position of prestige and power becomes a seem-
ingly endless round of meetings, long—winded discussions, and
heated arguments.

But even if the work may grow to be monotonous and time-
consuming, the satisfaction is rewarding enough when the
hard ﬁght to get a point or motion passed is won and the stu-
dent will beneﬁt from the work. However, far too often, the
Pitt student notoriously apathetic to the very government
which strives to represent his wishes, does not know or even
try to find how student government functions. Unfortunately,
it is easier to criticize student government than to devote
time and effort toward strengthening it.

campus by ROTC

The Tuck Shop is crowded with noisy students, dressed in the
casual manner of college students all over America. Seated in
a booth is a tall man, dressed in a manner also familiar all
over America. He is a Major in the United States Army. He
is a member of the faculty of the University.

At noon on a crisp fall day, groups of students stand on the
Cathedral lawn watching intently as twenty men, some in
military uniform and some in civilian dress drill in compli-
cated precision patterns, bayonets glittering in the sun, while
a Very straight young man counts with authority, “Hup,

The man in the Tuck Shop teaches military strategy to the
students enrolled in the Reserve Officer Training Corps at
Pitt. The drill team is the Pershing Riﬂes, an ROTC group at
Pitt which is famous for its precision marching. They are the
upper echelon of Pitt's military program.

The bulk of ROTC personnel is made up of freshmen and
sophomores who are Working hard for that coveted lieuten-
ancy. On Thursdays the campus is sprinkled with boys in
khaki and in blue. On this day they lose their undergraduate
slouches, their casual crewnecks, and become soldiers with

of trained fighting men in quantity and in quality.

There is no better place to ﬁnd both a quantity of strong
young men and a fine quality of mind than on a college cam-

Balanced theater was achieved by Pitt Players this year
with a combination of a classical play, a popular play, and
a musical.

The Players, under the skillful direction of Michael
McHale, started their season with Moliere’s “The Would-
Be Invalid.” Starring in this classic comedy were Torn Di-
Silvio, Ethel Schachter, and Jill Freedman.

“The Rainmaker,” by N. Richard Nash, was their next
production. It starred Tom Hall, Alicia Kommich, Herb
Margolis, Don Marcom, Steve Gordon, Al Stewart, and
Duane Jones.

The Players wound up their season with the musical fable
of Broadway, Damon Runyon’s “Guys and Dolls.” This
play was double cast with Gil Lazier and Bob Cleland as
Sky Masterson, Carol Smart and Emily Geeseman as Sarah
Brown, Jill Freedman and Rena Gorm as Adelaide, Irv
Shore and Barry Tarshis as Nathan Detroit, and Karen
Parker as General Matilda Cartwright.

Pitt Players continued to offer opportunities in acting and
crew work for any student with an interest in the theater and
a taste for hard, but rewarding work. Acting talent was not
a prerequisite, and equal opportunities were also open in
the important crew work and technical end of production.

An independent branch of the Players, the Actors’ Studio,
saw its second season this year. A number of shows were
staged, with emphasis on plays in verse, and dramatic read-
ings. These Studio productions, which were directed and
acted in entirety by students, also offered valuable experi-

Fraternity and sorority life at Pitt is a combination of many
activities and many moods, from the seriousness of a solemn
formal initiation ritual to the ribald humor of a Spring
Carnival show.

Rushing which begins the year for fraternities, comes later
for sororities, but means the same thing—shaking hands,
talking fraternity or sorority, luncheon dates, and showing
off the house.

Shortly after rushing, Homecoming arrives, with its rallies,
returning alumni, and football game, but to the Greeks, it
means ﬂoat building.

Interfraternity and intersorority athletics provide year-
long entertainment and competition as the Greeks clash on
gridirons and ping-pong tables. Meanwhile, parties every
other week supply merriment and relaxation and develop
the social side.

The personal talents of a fraternity or sorority are dis-
played during Greek Week and Spring Carnival. Carnival,
with its week of comics, costumes, color, and crowds, has all
the spirit of a Mardi Gras or Spanish ﬁesta, and ﬁttingly
marks the highpoint of the Greek year.

Formal initiation ceremonies make the pledge an active,

THE HOUSEMOTHER gives the sorority or fraternity house

THE HOUSE is an invaluable asset to the fraternity man. Any
day of the week he can stop in and relax, study, or even sleep for
a few hours.

BULL SESSIONS and discussions about a troublesome course are ever-present at the fraternity
house. Comparing ideas and viewpoints often give a new insight into an abstract subject.

sfudem‘ life

Student life reﬂects informal

To a few students the term “social life” is a vague abstrac-
tion, but it is a matter ofgreat signiﬁcance to most Pitt under-
graduates. They realize that although the paramount goal of
every college student is to receive an education in the ﬁeld of
his choice, the social education and personality maturation
that can be gained from an active participation in the whole
of college life is often as valuable a training.

Most students ﬁnd that their interest becomes channelled
into one main area, but it is a rare individual who does not
become active in many aspects of school life. The varsity ath-
lete concentrates upon his sport, but he may ﬁnd himself
assuming responsibility in his fraternity, while a sorority pres-
ident accepts an editorship on a student publication. Even the
scholar Whose life is dominated by libraries and studying, may
ﬁnd himself participating in intramural sports, and a debater
can take time from his tournaments to sing in Men’s Glee
Club.

Through this diversiﬁcation of activities, the student is able
to achieve that elusive generality, “the well—rounded man.”
His school life has taught him to be as comfortable in a tuxedo
as in a crewneck. He can enjoy himself equally as well at a
fraternity party as at a concert, and he enjoys a football game
as much as a stage-play. He has learned to take full advantage
of the opportunities that his collegiate life oiiers him; to him
no college, no matter what its size could ever be an education
factory.

CLASSES AND STUDIES are the main rea-
sons why a student is at Pitt, but a college educa-
tion must include much more if it is to be of com-
plete value. It must carry over from the aca-
demic to include social life and activities.

ATHLETICS provide active participation for some students, and passive entertainment, as spec-

tators, for the rest of the student body.

some friendly horse-play, and then back to the books.

LONG HOURS spent in the libraries of Pitt and Carnegie Institute take up much time and are an unpleasant part
of school life, but they are still as much a part of college living as debates and Student Union dances.

WATCHING TV in the lounge of the Student Union passes away the few free hours that a student
occasionally ﬁnds in his busy day.

PARTIES, informal and picked up on the spur of the moment, are often better than the ones scheduled and planned weeks in advance. The
attitude of the people involved determines its success or failure.

Campus-Wide activities come to a halt

As exams enjoy a Week of attention

- HM»;

A WEARINESS sets in after hours of study, and a student can
only absorb so much; then a break must be taken. A cup of coffee,
a cigarette, and an hour of conversation relaxes a student enough

to return to work.

A soggy brown coﬁee cup, an overﬂowing ashtray and an open
dogeared book symbolize the last week of every school semes-
ter——the week of ﬁnal examinations. Instead of the usual at-
mosphere of gaiety and apparent casualness, the campus is
cloaked with intense pressure as students spend sleepless
nights in a frantic attempt to make the ﬁnal effort Worthwhile.
A few weeks before, there had seemed plenty of time to get
everything done, but suddenly the task appears impossible.
Finishing touches are needed on research papers and reading
assignments that should have been done throughout the ﬁrst
ﬁfteen weeks, but never are, seem twice as long. Solemn vows
are made to never get this far behind again.

Even after the study light has been lit half of the night,
there is always more to be studied, more to be reviewed. So,
another cup of coffee is poured. Another cigarette is lit. And
the studying continues until the morning light appears at the
window.

By the middle ofthis last week, a change is evident through-
out the campus. The Tuck Shop is only half full for the ﬁrst
time that semester. Conversations are centered not on last
night's date but on the impossibility of the last hour’s test.
Notebooks and papers have replaced the playing cards on the
tables in the Pine Room.

At last, the papers are ﬁnished; the texts are closed; the
blue books are in the hands of the professors. Another semes-
ter’s work has drawn to a close. It’s all over now—except for
the grades.

THE TUCK SHOP is ﬁlled with ﬁgures poring over books and notes during ﬁnal week, as its
usual gay atmosphere becomes subdued and studious.

STUDY IN COMFORT is the rule as ﬁnals week wears on. Whether in the library or at the fra-
ternity house, the study effort is concentrated but still casual.

NOTES AND REFERENCES from the library, added to
classroom lectures, help support a student’s ideas on a
ﬁnal exam.

145

CROWDED CONDITIONS often prevail in the libraries and
reference rooms in the days preceding ﬁnals week. The rush to
catch up and prepare for exams is evident all over campus and the
request for a date is often met with the answer, “Sorry, but I have
to study for Econ. tonight.”

This glow is crystalline and molten that burns the city's sky. lt’s the plunging

pour of metal and minds and muscles. The city moves against resisting crusts and

ﬁnds new movement beyond, and running down the ﬁeld, hurtles into Victory.

finals

LATE AFTERNOONS in near-deserted libraries demonstrate the solitude that
marks ﬁnals week, a time when a book is the constant companion of every student.

AN ENTIRE SEMESTER of work is measured by the perform-
ance on the exam. Without aid of notes or texts the student must
interpret, compare, and discuss.

BOWED HEADS and blue books ﬁll every classroom as
the Pitt student struggles over question after question.

146

EXPRESSIONLESS pictures and profs stare out over a

class in Soldiers’ and Sailors’ Memorial Hall as the stu-

dents attempt to cope with the six points on the board.
FINISHING the last ﬁnal leaves the student exhausted, both mentally and
physically, but also relieved that the pressure has been removed. Nothing
more is possible—the student has done his best on the paper and, good or
bad, the course is completed.

THE CLASS EMPTIES OUT and the tension mounts as the
last hour ticks away. The end of the blue book‘ is’ reached and
there is the mental strain for that closing phrase which will com-
plete and climax the written work.

Each year the Editors and Staff of the
OWL search the University for the girls
Who best represent beauty at Pitt. From
the first group of pictures, often number-
ing thirty or more, the girls are eliminated
through a long process of comparison,
argument, and careful study until only the
ﬁve Owlettes are left. From these beauties
Miss Owlette is chosen. Miss Owlette and
her Court represent the type of women the

OWL admires most and the University’

strives to produce—beautiful, educated,
well—rounded.

These are the girls you see in class, at
football games, Student Union dances,
and in the Tuck Shop. Some may be sen-
iors who have been Queens before; some
may be freshmen who will probably be
Queens in the future; they may be study-
ing elementary education or physics; but
no matter What they are or who they are~—
they are most of all, beautiful.

their members

Social fraternities and sororities, local or international, pro-
vide many advantages for their members. The Greeks pro-
mote high scholarship through positive study programs and
tutoring within their own ranks. They teach teamwork and
fair play through inter—fraternity and inter—sorority athletics.
They develop a spirit of competition, which carries over to
outside life, by rivalry in Homecoming and Spring Carnival.
They improve poise and confidence by chairmanships, oﬂicer~
ships, and work in carnival shows. They encourage the joining
and accepting of responsibility in important campus activities.
But most important of all, the Greeks contribute to the social
side of their members.

Through the fraternity and sorority social programs, the
man who was once shy and retiring, learns to be self—conﬁdent
as a Greek. He has developed into the well-rounded person
that he should be, helped by the extensive social activities
presented by his fraternity. At all—Greek affairs the Greeks
get opportunities to meet members of other fraternities and
sororities and to better inter-group relations. Regular infor-
mal parties bring the brothers or sisters together for good
times and camaraderie. Sometimes the Greeks elaborate on
their parties by using novel costume themes: the Roman Hol-
iday, the Hawaiian Hula—Hop, the Roaring Twenties Party, FLQAT BUILDIl\IG aids in solidifying fra-
and the Gay Nineties Party are examples of the many differ— Leg?Eyhiirﬁliggigégié(fgggigznas Greeks team
ent theme affairs held by the Greeks. Formals, whether they '
are the Spring, Fall, or Founder’s Day Formals, are always
the highlight of the social year for any Greek group. Often a
fraternity Spring Formal is combined into a weekend event
which closes out the school year on a social note. The combina-
tion of all these affairs enable the Greek to mature socially,
and to help him become the total man.

A NIGHT OUT with the brothers, along with parties, tea dances, and sports,
builds sociability and promotes brotherhood.

Interfraternity Council

The lnterfraternity Council is the governing body
of all Pitt social fraternities. Each fraternity has

of the general welfare of the University and the
whole student body.

The Council sponsors many diverse programs
including inter—fraternity athletics, ranging from
football to ping—pong; Greek VVeek, co-sponsored
with Pan—Hellenic Council; and special service
projects, such as collecting money for worthy
charities. To further spirit among the Greeks, IFC
awards trophies for all fraternity competition.

ized at Pitt in 1918.

Although the main aims of this fraternity are to
promote friendship among its members and to
have a high degree of mental culture, they have
an active social life as is shown by their many
activities. A few of these activities that are differ-
ent from average fraternity events are the Miami
Triad dance, a community service day, and
strengthening relations with Carnegie Tech by
having parties with fraternities and sororities there.

Phi Delta Theta has in its ranks many of Pitt’s
varsity athletes. Among them are Joe Scisly and
Ken Montanari, football; Ron Schwarzel, golf;

party with the State chapter after the Pitt—Penn
State game.

Outstanding members of Pi KappaAlpha include
Bert O’Malley, President of SGA; Will Hoel, Busi-
ness Manager of the OWL; Pete Prince, varsity

Pi Lambda Phi, national social fraternity, was
founded at Yale in 1895, and the Gamma Sigma
chapter came to Pitt in 1914.

The aims of Pi Lambda Phi are not only to
teach their men how to live together in brother-
hood, but also to develop the quality of leadership
in each individual.

As proof of this leadership ability, the Pi Lams
have such outstanding men on campus as Millard
Amdur, Editor of Pitt News; Stan Franzos, Pitt
Panther mascot; Stan Goldberg, president of the
Student Union Board; and Art Bloom, chairman
of Block “P."

During the past year the Pi Lam social calendar
included a winter and summer formal, a winter
weekend, a Hawaiian party, an Asiatic affair, a
Fathers’ Banquet and a Mothers’ Club Affair.

Sigma Alpha Epsilon

Sigma Alpha Epsilon, national social fraternity, is
represented at Pitt by its Chi Omicron chapter,
founded in 1913. This fraternity has earnest, hard
working men who strive to maintain a high scho-
lastic average. Joe Phillips, a Druid and Phi Beta
Kappa, and Ron Simonsen, a University Scholar,
are SAE’s who have scholastically proven the
worth of their fraternity’s qualiﬁcations.

The accomplishment of both scholastic and
social aspects of education is evident in SAE. As a
group, these men work earnestly and have had a
second place Homecoming ﬂoat and have pro-
vided some rough competition in interfraternity
sports.

Lodge parties, the Sweetheart Dance, a Winter
Weekend at Seven Springs, and the Spring Formal
are just a few of the many pleasurable affairs that
SAE holds during the year.

THE SAE LIONS guard the housefront, and the brothers
do their best to guard the lions from other fraternities who
take delight in trying to paint them.

Theta Chi

The Theta Chi social fraternity was founded in
1856, at Norwich University in Vermont. The
Alpha Beta chapter was organized at Pitt in 1919,
and endeavors to provide for its members a pleas—
ant social atmosphere and practice in self—govern—
ment.

It accomplishes these two objectives by sched-
uling such events as tea dances, weekly parties,
the annual Christmas orphans’ party, and the
annual spring weekend formal, and by actively
participating in interfraternity athletics.

The Theta Chi’s are strong supporters of Pitt
activities. This support is aptly illustrated by the
number of Theta Chi’s in the Varsity Marching
Band, and by Tom DeSilvio, who has appeared in
many of the Pitt Player productions. Other impor-
tant members of Theta Chi on Campus are Dennis
Litchman, President of Men’s Council; and Al
Wright, President of VVestminster Foundation.

A FRIENDLY CARD GAME with the boys helps to
pass away the time if one can ﬁnd much time to kill between

classes, campus activities, and studying.

Sigma Chi, national social fraternity, was founded at Miami Univer-
sity, Oxford, Ohio, in 1855. Sigma Chi is justly proud of the longest
unbroken fraternity history at Pitt. The Beta Theta chapter, organ-
ized in 1909, and this year celebrates its 50th anniversary on Pitt’s
campus.

This past year the Sigs won the ﬁrst All Sports Trophy sponsored
by IF Council for interfraternity athletics. Traditionally strong in
Spring Carnival the Sigs were also active in all other phases of frater-
nity competition.

Strengthening Sigma Chi are many brothers prominent in university
affairs. Among them are Randy Marlier, Chief Justice of Men’s Court;
VValt Sickles, Production Manager of the OWL; Pete Peters, president
of Schenley House; Kent Jarrell, Druids; and Don Hennon, captain of
the varsity basketball team and All—American.

Phi. Epsilon Pi

Phi Epsilon Pi, national social fraternity, was
founded in 1904, at the City College of New York.
Zeta chapter of PEP was established at Pitt in
1913, and has grown steadily until it is now the
largest fraternity on campus.

As might be expected of a fraternity that has
over a hundred members, the Phi Eps are well
represented in all phases of campus life. Well
known members of Phi Epsilon Pi fraternity are
Chuck Wittlin, ChiefJustice ofIFC Judicial Com-
mittee; Murray Chass, Associate Editor of the
Pitt News; and Sam Kamin, Business Manager of
Pitt Players.

The Phi Eps have consistently placed high
scholastically among fraternities at Pitt, and they
are just as consistent in interfraternity athletics
where they always provide intense competition.

Socially, the Phi Eps hold many informal par-
ties, but most important are their winter formal
and their spring formal weekend.

Sigma Phi Epsilon

Sigma Phi Epsilon, national social fraternity, was
organized to promote high scholastic, social, and
organizational achievement. The Sig Ep chapter
at Pitt was reactivated only eight years ago, and
since that time they have become a rapidly grow-
ing and progressive organization.

Socially, the Sig Eps have a variety of tradi-
tional events. These include a pledge party, a
Christmas formal, a Sweetheart formal, and many
tea dances.

Besides sponsoring a party for orphans each
Christmas, they have originated a program which
provides summer recreation for underprivileged

boys.

Sigma Pi

The Orchid Ball, Founder’s Day Banquet, annual
football trips, intramural sports, and the Spring
Carniv-al booth are some of the various activities
in which the members of the Sigma Pi national
social fraternity participate throughout the year.

Some outstanding Sigma Pi’s at Pitt are John
Costa and James Holot. Both of these men have
gained distinction for themselves and their fra-
ternity by being honor students. Also, Max Kumer
holds a track letter in the pole vault; Mike Bili-
rakis is the president of E&M Cabinet; and Van
Maldeg Hem serves on the Heinz Chapel Board.
The most recent honor received for participation
in an event was the interfraternity league “C”
football championship.

The Chi chapter of Sigma Pi, founded at Pitt in
1923, aims to develop scholarship, chivalry, cul-
ture, and character in every member.

they also work hard at aiding their alumni in

a ﬁftieth anniversary. The purpose of AKA is to
afford an opportunity for Negro women to derive
the utmost beneﬁts from college life, educationally
and socially.

AKA members participate in many other cam-
pus activities including AVVS, Mortar Board, Stu-
dent Chapel Board, and intramural sports.

The sorority holds the annual Barn Dance and

tus of a trophy, are their health projects and the
American Council on Human Rights.

and sisterhood are the main purposes of the Beta
Theta chapter of Phi Mu social sorority. Organized
at Wesleyan College in 1852, the Phi Mu’s came
to Pitt in 1920. One of their most notable projects
co-sponsored with the Lambda Chi Alpha frater—
nity, was a Christmas Orphan’s Party. Socially,
the Phi Mu’s take part in tea dances, parties, and
dinners. In order that their mothers can become
acquainted, the girls hold a Mothers’ Tea each
spring. The Phi Mu Winter Formal highlights
their school year. In order to create a close bond
of sisterhood and national unity, the Phi Mu’s
organize trips to nearby chapters in the Tri—State
area. These visits do much to better inter-chapter
relations.

Active Phi Mu’s on campus are Jean Valenzky,
a member of Heinz Chapel Choir; Eda Desantis
and Barbara Menges, OWL staff; and Barbara
Barefoot, OWL and Women’s Choral.

Honoraries recognize student

198

achievement

Honoraries play an important part in the organization of any
University because of their service both to the institution and
to the individual. They serve the institution by actual service
and by fostering a spirit of loyalty and dedication in their
members. They serve the individual first of all, because by
their nature as an honorary society, their members gain a
certain amount of respect from the student body through their
membership. Secondly, honoraries offer a place where a free
exchange of ideas can flow, and thirdly, because many honor-
aries, especially professional, serve as a liaison between their
members’ lives as students and their future lives in the actual
profession. Last of all, honoraries foster a spirit of fellowship
among their members.

The types of honoraries on the University of Pittsburgh
campus vary greatly. There are professional honoraries which
honor students in a particular field, and there are leadership
honoraries which recognize those actively engaged in activi-
ties. There are also scholastic honoraries which recognize
those who have made outstanding contributions in the aca-
demic ﬁeld. Although each of these three types have a distinct
and separate purpose, they all attempt to recognize and honor
those who have distinguished themselves in these various
areas.

No matter what type the honorary is, students are proud
to be tapped as members because it is a mark of achievement
rendered to those who have served the University well.

FREE EXCHANGE of ideas among members is one of the functions of an hon-
orary organization. These ideas often reap beneﬁts for the individual, the honorary,

and the University.

INITIATION for tappees is a traditional
ceremony. Emphasis is placed on rituals that
enhance the privilege connected with being
tapped to an honorary fraternity.

John Marshall Society

Because Pitt lacks a deﬁnite pre»legal curriculum,
the undergraduate student who is interested in law
is often unable to obtain the guidance and back-
ground he desires.

The John Marshall Society attempts to ﬁll this
Void. Composed of top—ranking pre—legal students,
it seeks to acquaint undergraduates With the prob-
lems, responsibilities, and opportunities of the
legal profession.

Monthly lunches, featuring prominent speakers,
Visits to law school classes, and participation in
mock trials give members a more realistic back-
ground for law than they can obtain from their
undergraduate courses. In addition, they aid the
diﬂicult transition from the normal liberal arts
requirements to the rigorous curriculum of law
school.

THE PRE LAW STUDENTS in John Marshall Society are all striving for that
one far-oﬁ" goal—Law School, and the Society is admittedly a decided advantage
in aiding its members prepare for the entrance exam and Law School itself.

Student interpretation of the Nationality Rooms
and Heinz Chapel is provided by Quo Vadis, the
University hostesses service. These student host-
esses conduct guided tours through the National-
ity Rooms and Heinz Chapel answering questions
about them and in general giving to visitors a fa-
vorable impression of the University.

Girls interested in becoming hostesses are given
intensive training during a workshop held during
the summer months. Upon completion of this train-
ing, the girls must pass both written and oral
examinations demonstrating their knowledge of
the Nationality Rooms and Heinz Chapel.

One of Quo Vadis’s activities is the spring initia-
tion dinner. They also hold an annual tea for stu-
dents who have studied abroad; this is in keeping
with their aim of fostering an understanding of
international culture.

Scabbard and Blade is an honorary fra-
ternity for advanced Army ROTC cadets.
Company D, 7th Regiment was estab-
lished on the Pitt Campus in 1929. Mem-
bership is based upon academic standing
and leadership qualities of advanced
ROTC cadets. Its aims are to spread
intelligent information concerning the
military requirements of the United
States; to take an active part in the mili-
tary aﬂiairs of the community; and to
develop and preserve those qualities
essential for good and eﬂicient oﬂicers.
Their projects include a Summer Camp
orientation weekend and the Military
Ball, held in cooperation with the other
military units of the University. The
Saber Trick Drill Team, under the aus-
pices of Scabbard and Blade, performs at
important military functions. Through
membership in this honorary, cadets gain
greater respect for and devotion to the
military profession.

Sigma Theta Tau

Sigma Theta Tau, the national honorary
society for nurses, was founded in 1922,
at Indiana University Training School
for Nurses. Anyone who maintains an
average grade not lower than the second
highest grade on the ofﬁcial grading scale,
shows leadership, capactiy for professional
growth, and shows desirable personal
traits can become a member.

The Society attempts to show its mem-
bers their responsibility to their profes-
sion, to their school, to their fellow stu-
dents, and to society. Their purposes also
include the promoting of high professional
standards, fostering creative works, and
instilling in its members a high spirit of
fellowship.

Some recent projects of Sigma Theta
Tau were evaluating student teaching
programs, curriculum research study, and
sponsoring a research fund on the national
level for studies on health teaching of
diabetic patients.

Total individual developed by

The purpose of any university is to develop and encourage the
three traits of an individual which are most essential to his
future successgintelligence, training, and personality.
Although the first two traits are obtainable in the student's
academic life, the latter one can not be learned in any class-
room. A student’s active participation in the many activities
offered by the University ofPittsburgh is one of the best ways
to cultivate this intangible thing called personality. In order
for an individual to be a successful member of any activity,
he must learn to work with a team and to subordinate his
wishes in favor of what will best benefit the whole group. He
must also learn to budget his time to obtain a healthy balance
in his student life academically, organizationally, and socially
—all of which are necessary to insure his success when his
days as a student are ended.

Besides playing a major part in developing the total indi—
vidual, activities make many contributions to the University
itself. Organizations such as the band, choral groups, athletics,
and publications do much to further the name of Pitt both in
the Pittsburgh area and across the country.

Thus, activities, because of their role both in developing the
total individual and in contributing to the University, are a
vital part of student life at Pitt.

DEBATING, entails activity both on and off the stage. Timers
keep the speakers conscious of the passing minutes, while the
rest of the audience watches, listens, and forms their own opinions
of the issue being debated.

ANY FOOTBALL SATURDAY, many Pitt activities combine to entertain the fans. The band, the cheerleaders,
Block P, and the Panther supplement the action on the ﬁeld.

Freshman Camp aids in

At Freshman Camp, one hundred and thirty—three male
freshman students got their ﬁrst taste of college life as they
participated in a week—end of sports, recreation, and fellow-
ship. Sponsoredjointly by the University and the YMCA, the
camp provided an opportunity for the freshmen to learn to
work together as a team through group participation in sports.
Meetings with upperclassmen and faculty members in a
friendly, informal atmosphere enabled them to get acquainted
with the University of Pittsburgh's customs, activities, and
academic requirements. Through this informal orientation,
those who attended camp were somewhat better prepared to
face the first confusing weeks in the University.

Competition raged between the sections in every sport,
from football to ping-pong, as the closely matched teams vied
for the honor of possessing the much sought after camp
trophy. The enthusiasm of the campers reached fever pitch
by Saturday night as they assembled to present their skits
and songs. The deciding points were won, however, Sunday
afternoon at the speech contest.

The winning group at camp this year was the Gold section,
and for their reward they received the battered milk pitcher
which serves as the “Freshman Camp Cup."

Following the awarding of the cup, all of the campers and
upperclassmen met in the traditional “Friendship Circle.”
Then, to prove that they were really friendly, the energetic
freshmen proceeded to throw the upperclass counselors into
the swimming pool.

VICTORY! The wild joy of winning is evident
as it is revealed that the Gold Section won the
old, battered camp trophy.

CHOWTIME AT CAMP found few complaints, either about quality or quan-
tity of the food. There was plenty for all, but busy days, brisk air, and high excite-
ment worked up appetites that required substantial ﬁlling.

Associated Women Students

Associated VVomen Students is the governing and
coordinating body of women’s activities at Pitt.
Any full time undergraduate woman is automati-
cally a member and can participate in any of the
activities sponsored by the organization such as
Lantern Night, the China Fair, the Activities
Fair, Transfer Students Coffee Hour, Customs
Sings, and Freshman Council Dinners.

AWS was first organized in 1912, under the
name of the Women’s Activities Association. In
1920, it was changed to the Women's Self Govern-
ment Association, and in 1957, to the Associated
VVomen Students.

The aim of AVVS is to foster a spirit of loyalty
to the University; to create a sympathetic public
opinion toward University women students; to
foster these ideals through enrichment of student
life; to promote fellowship between faculty, stu-
dents, and administration; and to coordinate the
organized activities of women into a uniﬁed whole.

 

INFORMAL DISCUSSIONS at AWS meetings often accomplish as much in
forming policy for women students as the regular planned meetings.

Engineering and Mines Cabinet

The Engineering and Mines Cabinet is the govern-
ing body for the students of the Schools of Engi-
neering and Mines. Composed of thirty—seven
members, four from each department and the
Aeronautical option, and one representative from
the Skyscraper Engineer, engineering student
magazine.

The Cabinet plans for and administers such
worthwhile projects as the EMITT Award,
Engineers’ VVeek, and the Outstanding Senior
Award. In addition, the Cabinet sponsors the Fall
Social, the Shamrock Ball, co—ordir1ates an exten-
sive intra—department sports program, and appro-
priates funds for the maintenance of the lounge in
the E&M Hall.

The Engineering and Mines Cabinet has long
been one of the most effective student governing
bodies on campus, and as such, other schools of
the University are coming to pattern their student
governing bodies after this group.

one year old organization on Pitt’s cam-
pus in name only. This policy—making
and policy—enforcing body has been ﬁlling
its role for many years under its old name.
SGA was organized in order to allow stu-
dents to voice opinions on student affairs,
and to provide a channel of communica-

administration.

Among its numerous projects this year
have been the sponsoring and ﬁnancing of
the Symphonetta which has been under
the guidance of the cultural committee,
the ﬁnancing of the new student radio
station, and the appointment of students
for major chairmanships of all school
events. Other activities have included
obtaining extra date tickets for the Penn
State game, a retreat to train students for
their speciﬁc offices in the organization,
and an oﬂicer installation banquet.

MIXED OPINIONS prevail when a new issue is brought before SGA, and each
representative ponders how it may affect the student body.

Business Administration Cabinet

The School of Business Administration has joined
with the other University schools this year in
forming a student cabinet which will serve as a
liaison between business administration students
and the school’s faculty and administration.
Through this body a channel was formed where
student affairs, concerns, and problems could be
more readily brought to the attention of the proper
authorities so that action could be taken.

Since this is only the first year of existence for
the Business Administration Cabinet, their activi-
ties were concerned mainly with laying the foun-
dations for future programs. The major concern of
the cabinet this year was the writing and drafting
of a constitution. Plans were also laid for the for-
mation of a program in which students could
present their problems directly to the cabinet.

Education School Cabinet

A ﬁrst birthday party on December 12, marked
one year of progress for the School of Education
Organization, the governing body of the education
students which is comparable to the Liberal Arts
or Business Administration class cabinets.

To promote the cause of education within the
University and to establish closer relations
between the faculty and students in the various
departments in education, SEO sponsors discus-
sions, seminars, teas, and monthly newsletters.
Speciﬁc projects such as a discussion of the cur-

Women’s Class Officers

The aims of the Women’s Class Councils are to
foster loyalty to the University and to one’s class,
to provide social experiences, to promote friend-
ship and understanding among women students,
and to encourage intellectual and cultural growth.

In order to accomplish these aims, the oﬂicers
of the women’s sophomore, junior, and senior
classes are combined together into one large execu-
tive group known as Women’s Class Councils.
Any full—time undergraduate woman is eligible to
campaign for an oH'ice in her respective class during
the spring elections as long as she has a desire to
foster class unity and better understanding be-
tween other women students of the University.

The Councils sponsor coffee-hour discussions,
class dinners, transfer student socials, student-
faculty get—togethers, and various other social
events throughout the year.

221

Men’s Council is a student organization composed of elected
oﬁicers and representatives from each of the men’s activities
on campus. It is designed to establish and coordinate men’s
activities at Pitt. The group also acts as a sounding board for
the opinions of men students at Pitt, and has the power to
weigh and act upon their ideas.

The council sponsors the men’s intramural sports program
and various freshmen events. It is also responsible for the dis-
tribution of John Marshall scholarship appropriations, and
for the maintenance of the eighth floor lounge.

By integrating the men’s activities on campus, the council
provides a more uniform and versatile activity program for
the men of the University.

Board of Religion

The University Board of Religion was
organized in 1957, by Dr. Charles Peake,
then the Assistant Chancellor of Student
Aﬂiairs. Since this Board is a policy plan-
ning and development body, membership
is obtained through appointment by the
administration for faculty and adminis-
trative members, and election by student
groups for the student members.

The purposes of the group are to
develop a general policy statement to
give direction to the total program of reli-
gion on campus, to prepare recommenda-
tions for a program of religious fellowship
and activities, and to submit recommen-
dations for religion in the curriculum.

The most signiﬁcant activities of the
Board this year included the development
of a statement of policy regarding religion
on the University campus and planning
for a curriculum in religion in the School

of Liberal Arts.

 

GUEST SPEAKERS are brought to Pitt by many religious groups throughout
the year to talk on particular beliefs or universal religious topics.

Work is heard at all University Heinz
Chapel services and at the Chancellor's
convocation.

The aims of the Heinz Chapel Choir are
to provide choral music for all University
Heinz Chapel services, to provide the
membership with comradeship and spir-
itual uplift through its musical and social
functions, and to bring about a mature
appreciation of religious music.

This year the activities of the choir
included a weekend choral camp, per-
formances at local high schools, and an
extensive spring tour. Socially, the mem-
bers of the choir enjoyed a banquet and a
party held in their honor by Mrs. Vera
Heinz.

CONSTANT REHEARSALS are necessary to keep the Heinz Chapel Choir at

Student Council of Religious Organizations

The Student Council of Religious Organi-

religious organizations on campus. It is
composed of representatives from the
Protestant, Roman Catholic, Jewish, and
Eastern Orthodox foundations. Its dual
purpose is to promote inter—religious
instruction and to promote a “religious
consciousness” on the Pitt campus.

In April, 1958, SCRO received a four
thousand dollar grant from the Danforth
Foundation in order to expand its pro-
gram. VVith this grant, SCRO was able
this year to sponsor two—day conferences
on the major faiths represented on cam-
pus, monthly programs held in the Stu-
dent Union, and a Mid—Day Series
program.

In the fall of this year SCRO held a
Planning and Evaluating Conference for
its members at Camp Kon—O—Kwee with
Dr. Huston Smich as the main speaker.

States and the United Church of Christ, was
chartered in 1945, and is presently directed by
Reverend E. Vincent Stratton.

Although its ofiices are on the Pitt campus,
membership is open to all university and nursing
students of the Pittsburgh area. Their oﬁicers are
metropolitan ofﬁcers elected from the students of
Pitt, Tech, Chatham, and nearby nursing schools.

This year the VVestminster Foundation, as usual,

Hillel

The B’nai B’rith Hillel Foundation, which is the
Jewish students’ own community on the University
of Pittsburgh campus, serves the Jewish student
in three ways—religiously, by providing a place
for people of this faith to meet and discuss their
religion; culturally, by offering a number of
courses on various aspects ofJudaism; and socially,
by providing its members with social programs
such as its annual Campus Capers program held
in conjunction with all Jewish fraternities and
sororities in the Pittsburgh area.

Hillel is a national movement founded in 1926,
at the University of Illinois. It has been active at
Pitt for over ﬁve years. Any student is eligible for
membership in Hillel.

Besides greatly expanding its cultural program
this year, Hillel in co—operation with SCRO spon-
sored the Winter Jewish Conference.

Newman Club

The national Catholic college student organization
on non—sectarian campuses is the Newman Club,
and Pitt’s chapter plays an important part in the
University religious program.

The Newman Club endeavors to provide both a
religious and a social life for the members. Its pro-
gram which includes rosary groups, communion
breakfasts, and weekly services gives to Pitt Cath~
olics not only an increased knowledge of their faith
but also a chance to actively practice it. Its dances,
swimming parties, and picnics balance the religious
and social lives of Newmanites.

This year marked the opening of Cardinal New-
man Hall, a center for Catholic students from Pitt,
Tech, and Chatham. The new center contains a
student lounge and recreation hall, a library, and
auditorium. Through this central center, located
on Craig Street, the Newman Club hopes to
develop closer unity among all Catholic students
in the Pittsburgh area.

To foster an appreciation and understanding of the common goals and
aspirations of all religions, and to promote a God—centered fellowship
are the aims of Pi Theta, local pre—theological fraternity.

Founded in I954, by Dr. Emory Luccock, University Chaplain, and
a few pre-theological students who felt the need for such a group, Pi
Theta is open to any undergraduate who is preparing for the priest-
hood, rabbinate, ministry, or religious social work.

During the year this group sponsors chapel services and brings top
men in the ﬁeld of religion and related areas to Pitt to speak on all
aspects of religion. They are also trying to bring to the attention of the
University the need for a larger Department of Religion.

Pi Theta has recently participated in a television program sponsored
by the Council of Churches.

 

Student Chapel Board is composed of representatives from the Protes-
tant religious organizations on the Pitt campus, Heinz Chapel Choir,
and the various governmental bodies. The role of the Chapel Board
this year was expanded into four major areas. They organized weekly
services in Heinz Chapel in cooperation with similar services held by
Hillel Foundation and Newman Club. They were delegated responsi-
bility by the administration to investigate increased use of the Chapel
in the ﬁelds of drama, literature, and music, and to encourage it as a
place for lectures and initiation ceremonies. They arranged a monthly
series entitled “This I Believe,” with speakers from the faculty and
administration. They also brought guest preachers from all over the
United States to speak at Pitt through an endowment from the How-
ard Heinz Fund.

A college yearbook can fulﬁll one of three purposes.
It can be a story of the senior class; a group picture
that covers 360 pages. It can be a campus trave-
logue, capturing in words and pictures, the feeling
of a great university. Or it can be, as is the OWL,
a journalistic history of the school year at Pitt.

Between its covers, the OWL attempts to record
the happenings of 1959, the personalities that
guided and participated in these happenings, and
the areas in which they happened.

To accomplish this purpose, over 8000 man-
hours of work are required from the stall. Photog-
raphers, layout workers, writers, advertising sales-
men, circulation stalls, and editorial and business
boards must plan, produce, and pay for this $20,000
worth of history. But in the OVVL each of them
has 3' graphic representation of his Work’ and ellch LONG HOURS, little sleep, and tedious work mark deadline
Student has a permanent record of the year at Put‘ nights for the OWL, but refreshments, humorous anecdotes, and

horseplay keep the spirits of the stall high.

Pitt News

The PITT NEWS of 1958-59 has attempted to
better communication at the University through
wider coverage of all the undergraduate, graduate,
and professional schools.

The increased scope of news coverage led the
staff to publish on an experimental basis three
times a week for a two month period. Although
the experiment was a success, for ﬁnancial reasons,
it was discontinued. This should provide the spark
for a more regular thrice weekly publication of the
PITT NEWS when a larger appropriation is avail-
able from the University.

This year the newspaper sponsored the Program
for Practical Political Education, which brought
before the student body Mayor David L. Lawrence
and Hugh Scott, successful candidates for governor
and senator, and former Governor George Leader.

CONTROVERSIAL EDITORIALS in the PITT NEWS, coupled with improved
news coverage, led to a higher degree of student interest in campus affairs, another

positive step in eliminating student apathy.

magazine slanted toward the engineering student.

Skyscraper Engineer

This year SKYSCRAPER ENGINEER pre-
sented a modiﬁed format of technical information.
Incorporated into the standard features of the
engineering magazine were articles of general cam-

These awards have served as an incentive to the
staff members for whom SKYSCRAPER provides
an excellent means of creative expression and
thereby furthers the standards of good magazine
publishing practice.

During the year, the magazine helps to promote
various engineering affairs such as the Engineering

Pitt Capsule

The PITT CAPSULE, organized in 1946, is the
University of Pittsburgh’s Pharmacy School publi-
cation. Beginning as a mimeographed newspaper, it
has since grown into a magazine published four
times yearly, containing excellent black and white
photographic reproductions in addition to inter-
esting articles on the latest advancements in the
ﬁeld of pharmacy.

The CAPSULE not only keeps the undergradu-
ate students informed of the latest advancements
and achievements in their ﬁeld, but also reaches a
high percentage of alumni as well.

In order to become a member of the PITT CAP-
SULE stafi a person must be in Pharmacy School
and have a special interest in this particular type
of publication. He does not need to have experi-
ence in journalism, but he must want to study,
write, and learn more about pharmacy, and in so
doing, encourage enthusiasm for his chosen pro-
fession among the pharmacy student body.

Jet Blast

Under the direction of faculty advisors
Dr. Donald Swarts, Associate Dean of
Men, and Captain Mark, from the Air
Force ROTC department, the Jet Blast,
AFROTC newspaper, this year entered a
new phase of development since recently
being made an extracurricular activity.
This new phase includes more pages, new
types of columns, improved pictures, and
a regular monthly schedule.

The paper’s primary mission is to pro-
vide news coverage for Air Force and Army
activities, and in this way secure a closer
bond between the cadets in both corps.

Cadet rank in the organization has been
discarded; enabling the students to see it
as a corps service, rather than a stepping
stone for personal gain.

Although a close knit military organiza-
tion, each cadet is also encouraged to sub-
mit articles pertinent to students through-
out the University.

Polaris

This year a new feature has been added in the ﬁeld
of Pitt publications. Feeling a need for two sepa-
rate informative handbooks, Kent Jarrell, this
year’s editor, divided the Polaris, previous student
handbook, into two distinct units, the Calendar
and the Polaris.

The Calendar is a compact, attractive, and con-
venient reference and date book. It functions in
two ways. It contains a listing of major student
organizations with their oﬂicers and advisers, as
well as a complete daily calendar with a listipg of
major University events from September to June.

The Polaris, a guide for new students, serves as
a convenient reference for freshman and transfer
students. The booklet contains valuable informa-
tion and pictures designed to acquaint newcomers
with every aspect of University life. Its contents
include a map of the campus, a first floor diagram,
and an organizational chart.

Air Force ROTC

The Air Force Reserve Oﬂicer Training
Corps is much more than the glamor of
blue uniforms and the precision of close
order drill as it seems to the outsider.
AFROTC actually means hard work and
study, for the cadets must master the
complicated courses in air navigation, mili-
tary aviation, air base functions, global
geography~all of which are needed to
prepare the cadet for the future role he
will play in America’s ever growing air
power.

On the drill ﬁeld the cadet learns how to
take and give orders, and after passing his
physical and AFOQT, he begins acquiring
the confidence and self—reliance essential
to his role as an Air Force Oﬂicer.

Socially the cadets attend the Military
Ball and the Parents’ Night program for
an Air Force oﬂicer must be able to be a
leader, a ﬁghter, and in addition, a gentle-
man.

The Army Reserve Oﬂicer Training Corps
was established at Pitt in 1917. It oﬂiers
government-sponsored military training,
under the control of the Department of
the Army. The purpose of ROTC is to
train qualiﬁed leaders for olﬁcer commis-
sions in the United States Army Reserve.

ROTC students attend classes in
weapons, military customs, mapreading,
small unit tactics, and the many other
things that an eﬂicient Army oﬂicer must
know. This classroom learning is supple-
mented by a summer training program at
a regular army training camp between the
junior and senior years.

Outstanding cadets are encouraged to
join Pershing Riﬂes or Scabbard and
Blade, military fraternities, to learn even
more about the military profession.

became prominent features of the VVilliam
Pitt Debating Union’s 1958-59 forensic
program. Through their high school
debating series in the Pittsburgh area and
across the country, through their service
club appearances, and through their
weekly television show “Face the People,”
Pitt debaters were not only able to reach
many Pitt alumni but also to make new
friends for the University. VVPDU took
part in twenty—ﬁve major intercollegiate
debate trips this year, including trips to
Canada and the VVest Indies to debate
this year’s national topic: Resolved that
the further development of nuclear weap-
ons be banned by international agreement.

In December of this past year, Pitt
sponsored the eleventh annual cross-
examination tournament which included
collegiate debaters from many outstand-
ing colleges and universities.

“FACE THE PEOPLE,” WPDU’s television program
on WQED, allows Pitt debaters the opportunity to ques-
tion noted personalities, such as Senator Hugh Scott, on
current issues.

TOURING high schools in the Pittsburgh area, Dr. Newman introduces Pitt debaters, John Strauch and Woody

Angel Flight

Angel Flight, the youngest organization
on the Pitt campus, is the women’s auxil-
iary to the Arnold Air Society. Pitt’s
flight is known as the Skyscraper Squad-
ron and its primary aim is to further
interest in the Air Force. There are thirty-
one charter members. Their uniforms are
composed of a straight Air Force Blue
skirt, white long—sleeved blouse, elbow
length AF Blue cape, cap, and blue pumps.
Each member, including officers, must
participate on the drill team for one
semester. Participation after that is
optional.

Block P

Block “P,” the student ﬂashcard section,
provides a colorful addition to home game
half-time ceremonies. Under the able
direction of Art Bloom, the chairman,
Block “P” is fast becoming one of the top
flashcard sections in the country. The
Block has helped to revive ﬂagging school
spirit, as well as to complement our own
famous marching band and the bands of
visiting teams.

The flashing of the cards by the stu~
dents who sit in the Block is fairly simple.
However, the casual observer cannot see
all the tedious work that goes into each
individual stunt. Each one must be labo-
riously worked out on paper, then copied
onto cue cards, numbered for each seat in
the Block. Many hours of hard work have
gone into making Block “P” a success.

Block “P” began four years ago with
only seven hundred students and four
colors. It now has a membership of approx-
imately one thousand students, and its
stunts are done in eight colors.

Delta Sigma Delta

Delta Sigma Delta is an interna_
tional fraternity comprised of
male dental students, practition-
ers of dentistry, and those who
have made notable contributions
to the ﬁeld of dentistry or to the
fraternity.

The purpose of the fraternity is
to keep high the standards of den-
tistry by inculcating upon the
minds of dental students and
practitioners, a spirit of fraternal
cooperation toward scientiﬁc,
ethical, and professional progress.

The most recent accomplish-
ment of Delta Sigma Delta is the
construction of a dental labora-
tory in the basement of their fra-
ternity house. The members hold
two formal rush parties to encour-
age new membership. Social
al-fairs are dominated by both a
Fall and a Spring formal and an
annual Halloween Party.

Evening Students Assoc.

The Evening Students!-Xssociation includes
all students enrolled in the evening or
Saturday classes. ESA was organized ten
years ago to acquaint the evening student
with the many facets ofstudent life avail-
able at the University.

This year the association launched an
extensive campaign which informed many
evening students of the activities and
services adaptable to their evening cam-
pus. Because of their limited time, many
evening students miss out on a campus
life and so the ESA’s social activities take
on a special importance. They sponsor a
Get Acquainted Dance, a Fall Square
Dance, and Chapel services every Thanks-
giving and Christmas.

ESA’S vice—president, Anne R. Blas-
kovich, was recently tapped into Delta
Mu Delta, the national honorary scho-
lastic fraternity; she is the latest of many
past presidents of ESA who have been
tapped to this honor society. V

AS THE COUP DE GRACE,
the jovial freshmen seized the
struggling upperclass counselors
and hurled them into the camp
swimming pool. This happened,
ironically, immediately upon the
breaking up of the “Friendship
Circle.”

VOCIFEROUS UPPERCLASS COUNSELORS spent the weekend haranguing
the men in their groups, leading cheers, whipping up spirit, and, in general, agitat-
ing competition between sections.

The Institute of Radio Engineers is a national professional society I R E
chartered in 1949. The IRE’s desire and main purpose is to develop ‘ ' '
a professional attitude in the students of electrical engineering. Along
with this idea the IRE periodically publishes and distributes technical
manuals to keep their members and professional electrical engineers
informed and up to date on the latest advances in electronics and radio
engineering.

Any full-time, undergraduate in the Electrical Engineering Depart-
ment is eligible to become a member of the Institute of Radio Engi-

Social intercourse, scholastic attainment, and pro-
fessional ideals are the goals toward which Kappa
Phi Kappa works. This fraternity for men in the
ﬁeld ofeducation is both professional and honorary.
. It is professional because its membership is limited
Kappa P111 Kappa to men actively engaged in preparing for educa-
tional work; it is honorary because only those of
high scholastic standing are chosen to join.

In addition to its regular meetings, Tau Chapter

Once a week all of the members of this group meet for a seminar which is a con-
, tinuation of the formal classroom study and instruction. Prominent men from the
Petroleum Englneers oil and mining industries are often featured as guest speakers at these meetings. As
an added feature in this departrnent’s educational program, various field trips are
planned throughout the year.
Along with the other engineering departments and organizations, the Petroleum
Engineering Department builds and displays a group project during the Engineers
Week celebration.

Phi Delta Chi, professional pharmaceutical fraternity, was
chartered at Pitt in 1907. It was originally founded at the
University of Michigan in 1883.

Qualiﬁcations for membership are a 1.0 QPA in non-
professional subjects, a 1.5 QPA in professional subjects, and
a sound and sincere moral and physical character.

The aim of Phi Delta Chi is to advance the science of Phar-
macy and its allied interests, and to promote a fraternal spirit
among its members. At the beginning of the year they pre-
sented a program for freshman pharmacy students and their
parents, “Prevue to Pharmacy,” and sponsored a freshman
tutoring service.

Social affairs this year included a spaghetti dinner, a hay-
ride, and a dinner—dance.

Phi Delta Chi also participates actively in the Pharmacy
Interfraternity Council.

 

Psi Omega dental fraternity was founded in 1892,
at the Baltimore College of Dental Surgery. The
Nu chapter at Pitt was chartered in 1923.

Psi Omega has the distinction of being second
only to the American Dental Association in mem-
bership of dental organizations.

As well as providing a well rounded social life for
the Pitt dental student by holding two annual for—
mals and bimonthly date parties, Psi Omega
exerts its inﬂuence for the advancement of the
dental profession and secures, by cooperation, ben-
efits and advantages otherwise impossible to the
individual dental student.

Psi Omega also works for the betterment of
human relations by sponsoring an orphans’ Christ-
mas Party and throughout the year holding special
clinics on new dental procedures.

S.A.M.

The Society for the Advancement of Man-
agement is composed of education, busi-
ness, and engineering students with a
sincere interest in, and aspirations to, the
administrative levels of government, civic
politics, or private industry.

Its aim is to provide an addition to the
student’s formal classroom education, and
to provide a medium through which he
can practically utilize his formal studies.

Chartered in 1954,, this chapter’s rise to
national prominence in a few short years
is due mainly to the growth of member-
ship and keen competition with other
chapters of SAM. Evidence of the success
of this branch is demonstrated by the fact
that the Pitt chapter is ranked seventh
among national chapters.

This year for the ﬁrst time, the Pitt
chapter played host to 200 top manage-
ment men, as the SAM held their Tri_
State Conference at Pitt.

The Fall Fun Frolic is the annual SAM
social affair, and this year it was held at
South Park.

Women’s Choral

Women’s Choral is the all—women’s University
choral group. Their speciﬁc aim is to foster an
appreciation of good choral music, to provide the
women with an opportunity for choral singing, and
through their interest in music, to serve the Uni-
versity in every possible way.

Women’s Choral annually presents a Christmas
Concert in co-operation with the Men’s Glee Club.
The Christmas Concert is one of their main events,
but they also perform at many University spon-
sored affairs throughout the year. Women's Choral
also participates in the Spring tour of other college
campuses, and they hold many local concerts for
various groups.

Any sophomore, junior, or senior woman who is
a full time student is eligible for membership, and
those who have been in the organization for two
years receive a gold choral key.

W0men’s Intramural Bd.

A new addition to the long list of campus organi_
zations is the Women's Intramural Board. It was
begun in 1957, as an extension to the women’s
physical education program here at Pitt. Its pur-
pose is to stimulate participation in all women’s
sports events and to organize various club groups.

The members of the WIB are women elected by
various campus organizations, each group being
represented by one member. Managers of women’s
sports are also included.

This year Women’s Intramural Board sponsored
an all day outing for all university women at Pitt’s
Wildwood Club. WIB also sponsored an intramu-
ral volleyball tournament. The Fencing Club, the
Dolphin Club, and the women’s tennis team are
also a part of this organization. An annual sports
banquet was held during the year in cooperation
with the Women's Recreation Association.

W.R.A.

The Women’s Recreation Association was founded
to foster and promote among the women of the
University a spirit of fair play, and to provide them
with the opportunity to participate in and enjoy
individual and group sports. All undergraduate
women carrying twelve or more credits are eligible
to participate in the many activities provided by
the VVRA.

Throughout the year the Women’s Recreation
Association sponsors intramural volleyball, basket-
ball, and bowling tournaments between the vari-
ous sororities and independent teams of the Uni-
versity, with trophies awarded to the victors of
each tournament.

Also, on their social agenda were an all day
outing at Pitt’s Wildwood Country Club, and a
swimming party for all women students.

Y.W.C.A.

The Young Women’s Christian Association, the
oldest women’s organization on campus, strives
to promote understanding among women students
of all faiths and nationalities.

A varied program, co—sponsored with the
YMCA, gives its members a chance to meet and
discuss with students and adults social and moral
issues prevalent in our society. They also take part
in the varied programs designed to meet the indi-
vidual needs and interests of a large number of
students. Besides its regular programs, the Y annu-
ally sponsors the Caritas Ceremony and the Christ-
mas Chapel Service.

This year Pitt’s YWCA received an award for
distinguished volunteer service from the Health
and Welfare Association of Allegheny County for
its project of weekly student visits to Mayview
Hospital.

odk man of fhe year

Each year Omicron Delta Kappa chooses an out-
standing man in the senior class to be awarded
the title of ODK Man of the Year. This is the
man who, through his leadership, scholarship,
sound character, and service to the University
represents the type of individual the University
aims to produce.

For 1959, Richard Mattern has been tapped to
this honor.

An economics major in the School of Liberal
Arts, Mattern has served as president of the Wil-
liam Pitt Debate Union, president of the Student
Council of Religious Organizations, and vice
president of ODK. He has been honored by Dru-
ids, Pi Sigma Alpha, and, of course, ODK, and
was named as Senior Worthy. As recipient of the
‘S” Award, he travelled through Europe during
the summer of 1958.

As lasting tribute, his name is inscribed on
ODK Walk, as proof that his service will not be
soon forgotten.

Streamlined registration

A PAIN IN THE BACK W35 35 31WaY5 3 VCTY 90111010“ °°mP1ai“t Registration, that dreaded but necessary day that marks
at registration. Trying to pick up the cards for those needed
classes was one of the hardest parts of the day. Seldom did the
schedule which looked so good at home remain the same by the
time it was handed to the fee clerk.

the beginning of every college student's new term, this
year assumed part of the new look that is becoming so
important at the University of Pittsburgh.

True, the students met the age-old problems of coor-
dinating the dream schedule worked out at home with
the reality of the available class cards, and they still
faced the avalanche of forms, requiring every type of
information; but there was a brighter side. As students
entered the Cathedral gym to see the fee clerk, it was
immediately evident that the inﬁnitely long lines were
things of the past.

The reason for this phenomenon probably lies with
the various changes that were made, which when com-
bined, made registration, if not a pleasure, at least a less
painful experience. For the first time the University pro-
vided a pre-registration of sophomores and freshmen.

The physical layout was expanded to include not only
the Syria Mosque and the Cathedral of Learning but
also Soldiers and Sailors Memorial and Stephen Foster
Memorial. Scholarships sponsored by the various schools
were available in the school Oﬂ'lC€S rather than a central
location.

Those factors decreased mass congestion in any one
area, and the combination of these changes produced a
more organized, less time—consuming day for prospec-
tive students.

FACIAL EXPRESSIONS at registration reﬂected the stu-
dents’ personal experiences. The many emotions displayed
ranged from the carefree gayness of a few, to indifference,
disgust, and total confusion.

mr. and miss pih‘

The graduation ofa senior class each June is a time ofpausing,
when the men and women in that group look back over their
four years in school. It is also at this time that the OWL
pauses to look over the senior class and to study the record
of their four years at the University of Pittsburgh. The
OWL selects two outstanding seniors, one man and one wom-
an, who best represent the type of student the University is
striving to produce. These two seniors are awarded with the
titles of Mr. and Miss Pitt. For 1959, the OWL has chosen
Bert O’Malley and Esther Mishelevich.

During their University careers they have both maintained
a high quality point average, and at the same time they have
been active in many campus activities and organizations.
These two have not joined these groups merely to claim
membership. Rather, they have accepted responsibility in
each of them.

Miss Mishelevich, who is an English major, is a member of
Alpha Epsilon Phi sorority. She was a Junior Worthy, and is
a member of Quo Vadis, Student Union Board, and Sigma
Kappa Phi. She ‘also has been tapped into Phi Beta Kappa
and Mortar Board, and was a recipient of the Thyrsa Amos
Award.

Mr. O’Malley is a pre—medical student and a member of Pi
Kappa Alpha fraternity. He served as president of his fra-
ternity, Interfraternity Council, and the Student Govern-
ment Association. He has also been tapped into Phi Eta
Sigma, Pi Tau Phi, Druids, and Omicron Delta Kappa, and
was chosen as a Junior Worthy.

hall of fame

The OVVL Hall of Fame is comprised of twenty-four out-
standing seniors who have been chosen to represent the senior
class. They are picked by the Hall of Fame Committee, which
is composed of six outstanding Junior men, six outstanding
Junior women, and representatives of the Dean of Students’
Staff. Through the many diversiﬁed activities and interests
of the members of the 1959 Hall of Fame, the OWL hopes
that a fair sampling of the important men and women in the
senior class has been obtained. These people who have been
chosen for this honor are the students who have sat next to
you in class; these are the men and women you see in the
Tuck Shop, at football games, in SGA meetings; these are the
leaders and workers who are oﬂicers and chairmen of their
groups, clubs, and committees; these are students who have
taken an active interest in extra—curricular functions, and in
the University as a whole.

Oldest school in University continues

The School of Liberal Arts, established in 1787, is the oldest
school of the University. From its beginnings as the original
Pittsburgh Academy, this school has grown into one of the
leading liberal arts schools in the country. Its primary purpose
is to provide for the students a broad knowledge of all facets
of life, a liberal education, and a fuller awareness of the world
around them. This is achieved by requiring courses in the
humanities, the natural sciences, and the social sciences. Ac-
quiring at least a basic knowledge in these three areas cannot
help but broaden the Arts Students’ outlook, and create new
experiences which can be lost when too much emphasis is
placed on technical knowledge.

More than any other of Pitt’s undergraduate schools, Lib-
eral Arts strives to awake an intellectual curiosity in the stu-
dents. By doing so, it hopes to make well—rounded graduates
who will, throughout life, attempt to increase their knowledge
and apply it wisely regardless of their chosen vocation.

The School of Liberal Arts, along with the rest of the Uni-
versity, has adapted itself to increasing demands placed upon
our institutions of higher learning in recent years. New majors
have been instituted, such as Far Eastern Studies, to provide
students not only with a liberal education, but also with a
speciﬁc education that can be precisely applied upon gradua-
tion.

A SOLITARY SILHOUETTE, framed in a University window,
signiﬁes the process of learning. Individualistic thoughts and ex-
pressions are developed and cultivated by reasoning out the facts
presented in physics or history, and asking, “Why?”

STUDENT CONFERENCES often crystallize
disorganized ideas into compact theory. Liberal
Arts courses require not only the ability to integrate
facts, but to apply them to practical situations.

262

its growth

REVIEWING ideas and theories expressed in lecture notes, from
courses as diverse as math and ﬁction writing, French and ROTC,
awakens a liberal arts student to the complexity of the ever-
changing world in which he lives.

REFERENCE WORK for term papers, history projects and lab
reports always seem to fall due during the same week, creating a
rush on the Pitt Libraries. The College Reserve Room tries to
meet the demand for material, but when they cannot, students go
to nearby Carnegie Library.

PRECISE LABORATORY WORK helps develop the liberal arts student to think
more clearly and logically. Here he gets a chance to examine for himself the facts
he has been exposed to in lectures and textbooks.

A PENSIVE LOOK on the face of a student can often
mean that the professor has raised a question in his mind,
for the student who asks “Why?” is gaining far more than
the student who merely accepts.

BLACK AND WHITE examples of practical business ad-
ministration enable the student to confront problems simi-

leaders of local industry

Among its many distinctions, the city of Pittsburgh has
world-wide fame as being the home of many of America’s
largest industries. Since a business, in order to be successful,
requires continual expansion and able leadership, large mar-
kets are constantly created here for qualiﬁed personnel in
these ﬁelds. The School of Business Administration plays a
major role in providing people to ﬁll this need.

In 1908 the University of Pittsburgh established an Eve-
ning School of Economics, Accounts and Finance. This eve-
ning school, however, was not large enough to adequately
meet the expanding need. Thus, in 1910, the school was
changed to include both day and evening students and the
name was changed to the School of Economics. Again expan-
sion was rapid, and in 197.4, the school was so broad in its
scope that it became known as the School of Business Ad-
ministration.

Since I957,students in this school are required to have com-
pleted a two—year program of liberal education before begin-
ning their speciﬁc business education. Once this liberal edu-
cation is complete, the student enters into a curriculum con-
sisting of classroom work, plant visits, studies of the business
practices in local ﬁrms, lectures from management oﬁicials,
and attendance at business conferences. Upon graduation,
students with a degree in Business Administration are not
only qualiﬁed to enter the business world, but also have an
adequate enough background in business subjects to enter the
ﬁelds of teaching, the legal profession, or further graduate
study.

 

RESEARCH in the library keeps the student informed
about the backgrounds and origins of today’s principles of
business. Such matters as ethics, legal obligations, and
labor-management relations change from year to year.

CHECKING personal calculations against a computer
often gives a student a strange feeling of inferiority, es-
pecially since the machine is never wrong.

INSTRUCTION in the use of digital computers opens, to the business adminis-
tration student, new and faster ways to complete a given project.

engineering

Flourishes in a great industrial

In the ﬁrst decades of American independence, Pittsburgh,
founded at the rivers’ forks, soon became an industrial center
whose mills and factories grew until today they distribute to
all parts of the world, in iron and steel, in aluminum, and in
electrical equipment, the finest products of engineering re-
search.

Industry, even then, demanded time—saving machinery.
VVestern Pennsylvania, thus, was a natural location for an
early school of engineering. In its earliest period, engineering
degrees were awarded only after an intensive study of both
technical and classical subjects.

The day will probably never return when the University
will demand of its engineering students the classical back-
ground it did before the Civil War. But engineering schools
generally are enriching their undergraduates’ curricula with
a background in such subjects as English, foreign languages,
history, and other liberal arts studies. They realize that the
engineer must be a man of broad outlook if he is to organize
industry for the more intelligent development of man. The
School of Engineering and the School of Mines at the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh, therefore, help the students to create
and build machines; and through their aﬁiliation with the
Schools of Liberal Arts and Business Administration, they
suggest studies that lead the student to an interpretation of
machinery’s human signiﬁcance, an interpretation that may
one day bring, out of the creative energy of the engineer, a
period of renaissance greater than the one we are now experi-
encing.

SOIL COMPOSITION study is an important part of the Civil
Engineering program. The physical components of the soil must
be accurately determined before engineers can be sure that it will
support the foundations for their roads, buildings, and bridges.

RUNNING MOTORS hold the

tional aspect of their course.

SUCCESSFUL VANGUARDS and satellites of
the future will be the products of just such men
as are now in the Pitt Engineering School. Learn-
ing to read an oscilloscope is only a small part of
the intense technical training of student engineers.

THE SURVEYOR’S TRANSIT, an instrument used to divide the world and
reconstruct it on paper, requires hours of study—both theory and practice.

orienfafion

Upperclass advisers help freshmen to adjust

After brieﬂy introducing the entering freshman to uni-
versity life during the Freshman VVeek activities, the
orientation program begins its major job of assisting
each new student in making a smooth entrance into his
college life. Special classes are held during the new stu-
dents’ ﬁrst semester in school, bringing together fresh-
men with upperclass advisers and members of the Dean
of Men’s and Dean of VVomen’s staff.

Outstanding women students, known as senior men-
tors, are each entrusted with the responsibility of guid-
ing four freshman women students through their ﬁrst
confusing weeks of school. For the women students, the
senior mentor is like a big sister, always able to answer
the important questions-—what to wear to the ﬁrst fra-
ternity party, where to sign up for chemistry tutoring,
how to join the Pitt News Staff.

On a more formal scale are the Men’s Conference and
the VVomen’s Seminar groups. Men's Conference, guided
by an upperclass counselor and a representative from the
Dean of Men's office discuss those problems which tra-
ditionally plague freshmen.

Similar to the Men’s Conferences are the VVomen's
Seminars, led by a member of the Dean of VVomen’s
staff. All phases of campus life, from religion to social
graces, are discussed in these groups. Through the work
of these groups, the freshman learns about his university
and discovers how he will best ﬁt into this complex
society.

teaching policy

The University of Pittsburgh School of Education was for-
mally organized and instituted on February 3, 1910. In its
first bulletin was the following statement, “The School of
Education will study the needs of the schools of its neighbor-
hood and will strive in every way to make its resources easily
accessible to teachers and to all others interested in educa-
tion.” In the last forty—nine years, the school has greatly ex-
panded and varied its services to students of the University.
It ofiers a complete curricula in the ﬁelds of secondary, ele-
mentary, business, vocational, physical, and special educa-
tion.

Selection of students for the school is done through per-
sonal interviews and a written examination. Students who fail
to meet the requirements set up by the school are guided into
ﬁelds which better suit their particular abilities.

In this past year the school has taken on a new look.
Changes in the student teaching program have come about as
a result of a three—year study by the Professional Laboratory
Experience Committee, and a study of the curriculum in the
departments. One of the main features in the new program is
a total school day of student teaching, rather than the few
hours a week spent in the past. This full day of teaching will
eliminate the old transition that the student teacher had to
make—being the student at Pitt for half a day and then the
instructor in a high school for the other half. Although the
students teach many different subjects and work with chil-
dren of all ages, a look at any one of them is a look at all of
them.

277

THE EAGERNESS of a class to respond is a good indica-
tion of the worth of an instructor. Whether in grade school
or graduate school, teachers are still the most important
single factor in education.

CLOSED-CIRCUIT TELEVI-
SION, from the laboratory to
the classroom, is one example of
the School of Dentistry’s use of
the newest methods of instruc-
tion.

use of T.V.

The University of Pittsburgh School of Dentistry was founded
April 20, 1896 as the Pittsburgh Dental College a little over
one hundred years after the founding of the University; Dur_
ing October 1905, it became the Dental Department of the
Western University of Pittsburgh.

The courses offered at the school began with the Basic
Science and Restorative Dentistry. Evolving from this were
Oral Medicine, Oral Surgery, and the newest Complementary
and Special Dentistry which includes such subjects as Ortho-
dontics, Psychiatry, and Radiography.

The dental school was ﬁrst located at Pride and Bluff
Streets from where it was moved to its present campus on
June 18, I912.

The school now includes preclinical ir'1structic~n fol" fresli-—
man and sophomore students in the Schools of the Health
Professions Building, the dental clinic for clinical instruction
where thousands of patients are treated every year, the Falk
Clinic, and the dental departments of the University Hospi—
tals. i

This year the School of Dentistry introduced the use of
educational TV, by which they televise lectures and demon-
strations into the classroom.

As the school has become more complex, so has its criteria
for selecting students. The selection is based on the college
record of the applicant and by an objective pretesting prom _

The Dental Student Council seeks to develop and encour-
age a spirit of co—operation with the student body, and Den-
tal Interfraternity Council serves a vital and important part
in creating and maintaining harmonious relationships among
the dental fraternities.

A BREAK between classes allows the student in Dental School to share ideas and
opinions with men who face this same problem.

Uses distinctive uniform to mark Pitt nurses

A PATIENTS COMFORT is one of a nurse’s main duties. Al-
though spirits ﬂag, and one gets tired of changing sheets, serving
meals, and giving pills, the goal of being a senior and wearing a
blue-striped cap keeps one going.

ROW UPON ROW of mailboxes in the lobby of the Nurses
Residence give some idea of the school’s size. Seven hundred and
ﬁfty University of Pittsburgh and Presbyterian Hospital nurses
share the Lothrop Street Residence, close to the famed Pitt Medi-

cal Center.

284

The University Medical Center has fast become a point of
pride, not only to those directly connected with the Univer-
sity, but also to the City of Pittsburgh. One of the newer schools
in the l\/Iedical Center is the School of Nursing, established in
1939. In its nineteen short years, this school has become one
of the best in the country. Pitt’s Nursing School has a marked
advantage, in that unlike most nursing schools which are
connected with only one hospital, the University lVledical
Center is affiliated with Magee Hospital, the Children’s Hos-
pital, VVomen's Hospital, Eye and Ear Hospital, VVestern
Psychiatric Institute and Clinic, and the Falk Clinic.

Besides the opportunity for clinical experience obtained at
the Medical Center, student nurses gain public health nurs-
ing experience by their aﬂiliation with the Allegheny County
Health Department, the Butler County Health Department,
and the Visiting Nurse Association of Allegheny County.

Because of this instruction of both clinical and public
nursing, the School felt that they should have a uniform de-
signed to meet the needs of both areas. The unique uniform
worn by the students today is a direct result of the fulﬁllment
of this idea. It consists of a navy dress with a large white
apron. The dress alone can be worn while doing public nurs-
ing, and the addition of the apron makes it suitable for clini-
cal duty.

The Bachelor of Science in Nursing, besides qualifying the
graduates for careers as registered nurses, gives them an ex-
cellent background for careers in nursing education and psy-
chiatric nursing.

RELAXING on the steps of the residence the Pitt nurses get a much needed break between their
classes and hospital work. With student nurses, the conversation is almost always centered on the
happenings in the hospital, or that special up—c0ming date.

A PLEASANT CONVERSATION during lunchtime relaxes the nurses, who have been on morn-
ing care, and prepares them to return to work in the afternoon. The close bond that exists between
the girls arises from sharing common interests and common problems.

OPEN HOUSE at the Student Union was part of the activity-ﬁlled Freshman Orientation Week.
Many displays greeting the new class dotted the Union’s halls and ornate lounges.

THE FRESHMAN TEA held in
the Commons Room introduced
the new women students into the
University. At this occasion, the
women met their senior mentors
and were able to get acquainted
with the other girls in their men-
tor group.

pharmacy

This year marks the eightieth anniversary of the University
of Pittsburgh’s School of Pharmacy~—eighty years ﬁlled with
growth and change, as the former Pittsburgh College of
Pharmacy grew to become one of the ﬁnest pharmaceutical
schools in the country, fully accredited as a Class A school by
the American Association of Pharmacy.

Through rigid science and administration courses, the stu-
dent acquires not only proﬁciency in the technology of phar-
macy, but also an understanding of the economic problems
and lawful restrictions of his future profession. The Pharmacy
School, however, aims to graduate more than a “student pro-
fessionally capable of keeping abreast of, and contributing to,
the advances of pharmacy.” It‘ also aims “to establish habits
of self—reliance and facility in group action through student
organizations, as a basis for future professional activities."
The latter is accomplished through the School of Pharmacy
Student Council, Rho Chi Pharmaceutical Honor Society
and pharmaceutical fraternities and sororities and their In-
terfraternity Council.

Not relying entirely on laboratory and books, the School
arranges ﬁeld trips to laboratories of drug manufacturing
ﬁrms for the junior and senior classes.

Because the state of Pennsylvania requires that each stu-
dent serve a period of apprenticeship, actual work in a phar-
macy or drug store is required. This combination of both class-
room knowledge and practical experience provides an excel-
lent background for future careers in the ﬁeld of pharmacy.

A PITT MAN frowns critically at his own work. Outwardly
he is the hardworking pharmacy student, but under the
ofﬁcial-looking, white lab coat, he is still another ivy—league

A STEADY HAND is necessary for the precision measure-
ment of drugs and prescriptions. A life may rest in the
hands of a pharmacist, and a student’s skills must be sharp-
ened to the point of perfection.

TECHNICAL SKILL is required by the School of Pharmacy for
graduation, but the department also teaches its students an under-
standing of the business end of pharmacy.

289

A PRETTY GIRL can be just as devoted to the study of pharmacy
as others are to the study of clothes and makeup.

EXACTING MEASUREMENTS are required of the pharmacy student just as they are required
of the practicing pharmacist. Practice in the handling of delicate instruments is a major factor in
pharmacy education.

Extensive backgrounds Valuable to Pitt

Helen P. Rush
Dean of Women

Dr. William L. Swartzbaugh
Dean of Students

The Administration of any great University must be com-
posed of outstanding leaders with experience and in direction
and development. The University of Pittsburgh is fortunate
to have the men and women of ability that it possesses on its
levels of administration.

Chancellor Edward H. Litchﬁeld came to the University
in 1955, bringing with him the valuable experience gained
through his three successfully combined careers—educa-tion,
business, and public service. In the relatively short time that
Dr. Litchﬁeld has been here, he has had to call heavily upon
his background in inaugurating a bold new program for Pitt.

Dr. John Geise, Assistant Chancellor for Student Affairs,
has held this post only since last year, but he has been affili-
ated with the University since 1925. Former Dean of the
School of Liberal Arts, Dr. Geise has served as Director of
many civilian and military projects.

Dean of Students at the University is Dr. William L.
Swartzbaugh, who came to Pitt in 1957 as Director of the
Student Union and took over his present duties in 1958. He
has had experience in teaching, counseling, and student
guidance in various schools in the East and Middle West.

Miss Helen Pool Rush, Dean of Women, has been with the
University since 1920. Her long experience with Women stu—
dents and their problems constantly aid her in her position as
President of the Western Pennsylvania Association of Deans
of Women.

AFTER THE BANQUET, lingering freshmen discussed their plans and expectations for the next four years with
understanding upperclass hosts and hostesses.

THE GAY SPIRITS and wild exuberance of the freshmen
at the Mixer Dance was typical of Pitt’s Freshmen Classes.

THE HOKEY POKEY started
off orderly enough, but ended up
in mass confusion. The freshmen
enjoyed the novelty numbers as
well as Benny Benack’s swinging
arrangements.

PENSIVE LOOKS vividly portrayed the intense interest
that was displayed on Lantern Night. This ceremony is the
traditional welcome of freshmen women into University
life. The lantern, containing the light of knowledge, was lit
that night in the hope that it would illuminate the path of
the women in their ensuing years as Pitt students.

NUCLEU$ OF INDUSTRY

HARBISON-WALKER REFRACTORIES

keep pace with the alomic age

Refractories are needed for building the many
widely diversiﬁed types of furnaces used for
making steel, aluminum, copper, and other
metals, cement, glass, steam-generated power
and substantially all products vital to our
modern civilization and our national economy.

The high temperatures and other severe
operating conditions which refractories must
withstand in service differ greatly among the
various industrial processes. Through research

General Offices . . . .

and extensive application experience, Harbison-
Walker has developed the kinds of refractories
best suited for each speciﬁc requirement. From
a mere dozen kinds of refractories made avail-
able to industry a half century ago, Harbison-
Walker now produces more than four score
commercial types and classes. The proper
selection of these refractories for every par-
ticular application assures longest service life
and greatest operating economy.

Homecoming festivities.

Homecoming 1958, oﬂicially got under way with a pep rally in the
Student Union on the Friday afternoon preceding the Pitt—West
Virginia‘ game. Saturday morning, fraternities and sororities held
brunches at their houses. Before the game, nine ﬂoats, gaily deco-
rated to the central theme of “Proverbs on Parade," and representing
sixteen organizations, paraded before the crowds. At half time, the
Homecoming Queen, Kay Koelsch, her Maid of Honor, Janet Bleak-
ley, and the Court circled the stadium in a motor Cavalcade to greet
the 42,000 spectators. The Panthers beat the Mountaineers, after a
hard fought game, 15-8. Later in the afternoon, the fraternities and
sororities held open houses for their alumni. Climaxing the festivities
Saturday night was the Homecoming Dance in the Commons Room,
featuring the band of Billy May.

Homecoming, however, meant something different to each Univer-
sity group. To the average student, Homecoming was a fever-pitched

football game, a time of spirit, a victory dance. To the alumni, Home- v

coming was a return to the Alma Mater, a chance to recapture those
brisk, football~Saturday afternoons, the renewing of friendships with
classmates and faculty. But to the Greeks, Homecoming meant only
one thing—ﬂoat building. Long, tedious hours were spent for a week
before that Saturday, designing, pounding nails, molding papier maché
ﬁgures, and stuﬂing countless napkins into chicken wire. Finally on
that cool, crisp, autumn Homecoming morning, sleepy forms, sus-
tained only by short cat naps and innumerable cups of coffee, stepped
back from the ﬂoat and admired their work—the rest of the day was
anticlimactic.

IMPROMPTU CONDUCTOR leads the Marching
Band in a rousing rendition of “With a Little Bit of
Luck.” And luck was with the Panthers as they went on
to beat the Mountaineers 15-8.

FIRST PRIZE FLOAT of Delta Delta Delta and Pi Kappa Alpha used the characters from the
comic strip “Peanuts” to depict their proverb “Practice Makes Perfect.” While Snoopy twirled his
hoola hoop and Schroeder played Beethoven’s Fifth, Charlie Brown, frustrated as usual, banged

his head against a wall.

homecoming

JUBILANT shouts of Pi Kappa Alpha’s and Delta Delta De1ta’s ﬁll the Commons
Room at the Homecoming Ball as it is announced that they captured ﬁrst place
in the ﬂoat competition.

BEGINNINGS of a ﬂoat are often unimpressive.
But as work continues, what once was only a
shape becomes a scene depicted in papier—mache',
paint, and table napkins.

SECOND PLACE FLOAT, “A Deck of Cards is the Devil’s
Prayerbook,” was built by Kappa Kappa Gamma and Sigma
Alpha Epsilon.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

One of the shortcomings of our language is the nonexistence of a better
word than “thanks” to convey gratitude. The word is over-used; so
lightly stated that it is diﬁicult to diﬁferentiate a sincere and grateful
feeling of appreciation from an unconscious response. Not having a
better word at my disposal, I must use “thanks” with the hope that
those thanked will fully realize the deep feeling of gratitude that I
hold toward them.

Thanks then to the entire staff of the 1959 OWL for the estimated
8000 man-hours of work necessary to put out the book. From the long-
range planning all the way down to typing of senior names and re-
copying layout, each and every job was important to the success of
the OWL.

More especially, thanks to the handful of people who actually con-
sidered the OWL a way of life rather than just an activity . . . Will,
the kind of Business Manager a good editor would get if he went to
Heaven, and without whose friendship, understanding and business
eﬂﬁciency, I could never have seen half of my ideas materialize . . .
Eileen, who could make the staff get down to work and like it, put the
book ahead of all her other activities, and spent more evenings with
the OWL than with her ﬁancee . . . Ron, who matched me hour for
hour in our pre-deadline, sleepless marathons, overcame his creative
writings talents and turned out ﬁne exposition, and kept the oﬂice
sparkling with his ready wit; . . . Tom, who was ready to defend the
OWL with ﬁsts and phrases at every turn, set an example in dependa-
bility that few of his photographers could match, and never wavered
in his unquenchable optimism about the quality of the book; . . . Walt,
who took his role as the eternal Sigma Chi with good humor, and
turned out color photos that surpassed professional work; . . .
Hank, who was supposed to be just a photographer, but tried his hand
at everything from layout to hunt-and-peck typing, and did an ex-
cellent job with whatever he touched; . .. . and Jackie and Barbara,
who put up with their editor’s unique layout ideas, and gently cor-
rected my mistakes.

Thanks also to the company representatives who worked with us
to produce the best possible OWL. Don Messinger, of Keller’s, who
divided his loyalty 60-40—60% to the OWL and 40% to his company;
. . . Jewell Gates, also of Keller’s, whose patience and understanding
was another of those “Keller services” that we appreciate so much; . . .
Ralph Benz of S. K. SMITH, who put us on the track of a new cover
idea; . . . Sam Fields of Delma, a gourmet who is also a smart business
man, and who was ever eager to please.

Thanks again to Stuart Love of the PITTSBURGH PRESS for
the color shots on pages 6, 7, I0, and I4; Mellon Bank for the color
rendering on page 3; Jones and Laughlin Steel for the color shot on
page 10; U. S. Steel for the shot on page 326; and Shrader Studio for
the shots on pages I, 3, and upper 10.

A special thanks is forthcoming to Jim Marino, former editor of
the PITT NEWS, not only for the ﬁne prose-poetry in the intro-
ductory section, but for his role as a friend and a conﬁdant.

Sincere thanks to my instructors, who were more than under-
standing and took into consideration the time that I spent on the
OWL; the administration, for the full co-operation that they gave us,
and most of all, to Dr. Donald E. Swarts, who, has more profoundly
inﬂuenced me than any other person I have met at Pitt.

And ﬁnally, thanks to my mother for her gracious acceptance of the
idea of seeing her son only briefly on week-ends, and for her never-
wavering encouragement.

All these people have made it possible for me to edit the 1959 OWL.
Of all the things I have done at Pitt, I am proudest of this honor. I
only hope my work can make them proud of me.

greek week

Greeks devote a Week to strengthening

GREEK WEEK QUEEN Marian Wood was presented to
the assembled fraternities and sororities at the All—Greek
Rally by Mr. Vigdor Kavaler, guest speaker for the pro-
gram.

The primary purposes of Greek Week at the University of
Pittsburgh were to provide a combination of social activity
and Greek competition, and to better relations among Greek
groups and individuals.

Greek Week began with the Tuesday noon Chapel Service
in Heinz Chapel. The athletic aspect of school and Greek life
was brought into the picture on Wednesday night when the
Inter—fraternity and Panhellenic All Stars played the men's
and women's faculties in basketball and volleyball. The ex-
change dinners had sorority girls invited to fraternity houses
to mingle and get acquainted. Discussions with faculty
guests after the dinners centered upon the problems the
Greeks would face under the trimester program. At the All-
Greek Rally, on Thursday night, it was announced that the
Queen for 1959 was Miss Marian Wood of Kappa Alpha
Theta sorority. The Greek Week Sing provided high spirited
competition and musical entertainment. Winning groups
were the Delta Delta Delta sorority and the Sigma Chi fra-
ternity. Closing the week’s events, the Greek Week Ball
featured Les Elgart’s orchestra.

Mr. Vigdor Kavaler, Grand National Superior of Phi Ep-
silon Pi, summed up the Greek’s purpose at the All-Greek
Rally: “The Greeks are primarily social organizations
formed to ﬁll a need for social activity on university cam-
puses. We cannot boast only of this aspect or we will be
criticized, but still we cannot cover up or hide the reason for
Which we were originally formed, for if We do, We have no
use or right to exist as social fraternities or sororities.”

GREEK LUNCHEON on Saturday after-
noon brought together 600 men and wom-
en representing every Greek letter society
on campus. Guest speaker was Mrs. Dar-
rell R. Nordwall; National Chairman of
Panhellenic Council.

WINNERS of the “Keep Talking” Contest held during Greek
Week were Chris Gillotti of Delta Sigma Phi and Jeff Hohen-
stein of Pi Lambda Phi. First prize was a toy bucket and shovel.

BEARD CONTEST winner, John Puskaric of the Sigma
Alpha Epsilon fraternity was chosen by Greek Week
Queen Marian Wood. The beards and old costumes were

planned as a part of Pittsburgh’s Bicentennial Celebration.
FIRST PLACE SORORITY at the Greek Week Sing was Delta Delta Delta who

won with the song “Lousiana Hayride.” Delta Zeta sorority sang the second place
number “How Are Things in Glocco Morro?” “Under Paris Skies,” the third place
winner, was done by Kappa Kappa Gamma.

BARTENDERS, in reality Sigma Chi fraternity men, cleaned up in Greek Week
Sing by copping ﬁrst prize with “Way Down Yonder in New Orleans.”

RECEIVING TROPHY for second place fraternity song “Jamaica Farewell” is

third place for their presentation of “Granada.”

Snow brings White beauty to Pitt

THE COMMUTER faces additional problems almost totally
unknown to the resident student. Icy Windshields, dead batteries,
and slippery roads combine to make winter driving a nerve-wrack-
ing chore.

The broad lawns grow white overnight, and sweeping winds
stir ﬁerce small ground blizzards of stinging, powdery snow.
The grounds crew is at work in the cold early morning, and
the scrape of shovels on stone walks carries clearly in the
wind. Snow drifts are piled under the Gothic windows of the
Cathedral, covering the barren stone ﬂower boxes on Lily
Court. Through the revolving door is welcome warmth and
a chance to catch a breath after hurrying to escape the chill
wind. There are puddles on the ﬂoor here from the many
boots which have tracked in snow, and wet footprints have
made shiny paths through the halls.

Inside classrooms, radiators hiss and pipes clang as the
day’s classes start. Outside the snow still falls. The wind
whips the white ﬂakes around the odd angles of the build-
ing, making small whirlwinds, causing the snow to eddy
upward against the windows, giving an odd upside-down
sensation. Still-life scenes are framed in the windows. To
the east is a Hat, white carpet on which sits Gothic Heinz
Chapel, its delicate, slim spire and traced stonework edged
in white. The blossom trees on the lawn are bare and black,
each twisted branch outlined in bright white. The effect is
of an etching, India ink on smooth white paper.

When night comes it is not quite dark, but illumed by
the bluish snow. Faintly-yellow light falls on the drifts from
windows on the first floor. Students hurry to and from night
classes, up and down the broad, icy Fifth Avenue walk. The
wind is stilled. A cold white moon throws a frosty glitter on
the scene. Winter has come to the Pitt campus.

CRIIIPUS.

THE LONG TREK between classes at the YMHA and the Cathedral is particularly trying on a cold morning as
the wind strikes—stinging, blinding, penetrating.

SWIRLS OF SNOW sparkle in the light of the lamps and pow-
dery shrubs huddle against the wind on the walk around the
Schenley Union on a winter’s evening.

ICY FIFTH AVENUE walks with
their gusty blasts of cold winds induce
students to hurry toward the warmth of
the Cathedral.

THE SNOW that blankets Lily Court contrasts sharply with the reds and yellows

students. The distance between buildings on campus seems to increase as the temperatures fall.

Pitt transforms Oakland into a

— an i ' ’ﬁ ..

BOOKSTORES in the Oakland area offer to the student,
who seeks it, a vast world of literature, ranging from
Dostoevski to Keroac.

 

Fifty years ago Oakland was a reserved, sedate, residential
section, comprised of quiet tree—lined streets, and stately man-
sions. But soon came the University of Pittsburgh, and later,
its radical plan to build a Skyscraper University in the heart
of staid old Oakland. The University ﬂourished, and busi-
nesses moved in to serve and live off the inﬂux of students
who daily moved in and out of the area. Soon other schools—
Carnegie Tech, Mount Mercy, Chatham—moved into and
around Oakland. The money of steel magnate Andrew Car-
negie built libraries, a museum, and an institute, and with
this new culture came still more businesses and shops, until
Oakland took the form of a business district.

Today Oakland is a college town; unique, but still a college
town. Crowding the back streets are the weathered houses of
an era long gone by. Nearby, the hustling business district
competes to win the patronage of the college students——the
one element in Oakland which has not changed down through
the years. Their faces have changed a little, and their clothes
have changed and even returned to the original styles, but the
student himself has not changed.

Today the University has grown until it now threatens to
engulf the whole of Oakland in an attempt to become what it
never was before—a campus school. The University of Pitts-
burgh has been, still is, and will be for a few years yet, the
city—campus school. Its campus is the sidewalks of Forbes and
Fifth. It ﬂourishes in an area that has long been dedicated to
a quest for knowledge. It has become the center of activity in
Oakland, and its Cathedral is the hub around which Oakland

revolves.

MODERN museum displays of subjects as old as time enable
students to painlessly assimilate geology, biology, and anthro-

pology.

In 1759, the brick stockade and rude log cabins
clustered together at the junction of the three
great rivers dropped the name “Fort Pitt” and
became incorporated as the city of Pittsburgh.

Twenty—eight years later, soon after the tur-
moil of a revolution, while Pittsburgh was still a
rough brawdy frontier town, a charter was granted
for a log cabin school—the Western Pennsylvania
Academy.

Since that time the city and its University have
survived ﬁre, ﬂood, war and depression. Pitts-
burgh has grown into a rich industrial, city while
the University has kept pace with this growth
until it is now as well-known internationally for
its educational achievements as the city is famed
for its industry.

Pittsburgh’s recent Renaissance from the dirty,
ugly, mill town of twenty years ago has shown the
‘world that a city can be commercial without be-
ing an eyesore; it can be productive but still
embrace beauty and culture.

The University of Pittsburgh is undergoing a
change much like the city’s renaissance. Its new
administration, the acquisition of new buildings
and land, striving toward higher standards of
education, and a revolutionary trimester pro-
gram are bringing to Pitt a brighter future and a
worldwide recognition as a university that is,
like its city, advancing with the twentieth century.

As a salute to the Bicentennial, the 1959 OWL
is dedicated to the city of Pittsburgh, and to the
students who have found its industrial climate
ideal for the assimilation of a University educa-
tion.

AVAILABILITY of Oakland
businesses makes it possible for
Pitt students to utilize a break
between classes by getting a
haircut, doing some shopping,
or visiting a bar.

WINTER IN OAKLAND leaves Schenley Plaza barren and lifeless; only occa-
sionally is the monotony broken by students going to and from Carnegie Library.

CITY COLLEGES present unique problems unknown to the
campus school. To the Pitt student, it often seems that city police
are overly cautious about an expired meter or a two-hour time
zone.

CLASS RINGS, fraternity pins, and trophies glitter in the display windows and
show cases of Balfour and Company. The olﬁcial University jeweler, Balfour is
also the jeweler for most fraternities and sororities, and the Oakland branch ofﬁce
always does a thriving business in everything from charm bracelets to hip ﬂasks.

THE CLASSIC BEAUTY of Athena, Greek
Goddess of War, demonstrates to the modern-day
student the lasting glories of an age which took
the time to create instead of manufacture.

RELIGIOUS NEEDS of the students are met by the many
churches in and around Oakland. Whether it is Friday night serv-
ice at the synagogue, nine o’clock worship at the church, or noon
mass at a cathedral, college students form a steadily increasing
proportion of their congregations.

IN A COLLEGE COMMUNITY students along the streets do as much to make
up the town as its buildings and parks. Students walking on Forbes and Fifth,
sitting in the Luna, or bowling at the Strand are as intergal a part of Oakland as
the Medical Arts Building, the Cathedral, or Schenley Park.

AN ACTIVE MIND not only wants
to study a concept, but also to see and
touch a tangible part of it. Carnegie

Museum provides students with an op--

portunity to accomplish this through
its exhibits, ranging from the natural
sciences to the Bicentennial Art Inter-
national.

OAKLAND’S LANDMARKS are enhanced by seasonal changes—-in-the winter
it may be a fresh snowfall, in the spring the cherry blossoms, in the autumn the
red and gold leaves.

bicentennial

Campus activities tied into

PLANNING Bicentennial events to ﬁt in with the University program, the Student Bicentennial Committee en-
couraged student groups to actively participate in the city’s celebration. Chairman Roger Panella and Jean Lintio
presented results to Mr. Robert Bailie, faculty advisor to the committee.

THE PITT NURSES this year held their
annual Variety Night in conjunction with
the Bicentennial Celebration. Part of their
show included a skit about the founding of $3
Pittsburgh called “What History Never
Told Us.”

  
 

city’s Bicentennial Celebration

A great city is known not only for its great industries and its
historical monuments, but also for its great educational
centers. During the past ten years, the city of Pittsburgh has
been transformed from a smoky industrial center to one of
the most progressive cities in the country. The last decade
has witnessed the renaissance of a city, and its University has
played a great part by expanding this renaissance to its cam-
pus.

In order that Pitt students could be made aware of the
Pittsburgh Bicentennial and take an active part in its cele-
bration, the Student Government Association formed a Stu-
dent Bicentennial Committee to coordinate campus activ-
ities with events throughout the city. This committee, com-
posed of student leaders, contacted all Pitt activities and
encouraged them to have at least one event using the Bi-
centennial theme.-Beginning with the Pitt-Penn State foot-
ball game on Thanksgiving Day, Pitt students took every
opportunity to honor the Bicentennial. Publications devoted
special issues to this theme. Academic honoraries presented
programs devoted to the contributions of their groups to the
history of the city and University. Even campus social
events were endowed with a Bicentennial theme.

Through this campus emphasis upon the Bicentennial, the
student body was made aware of undeniable correlation be—
tween the growth of Pitt and the community that surrounds
lt.

VARIETY NIGHT presented by the University of Pittsburgh
nurses covered many areas ranging from the Bicentennial to
“Life Upon the Wicked Stage” as sung by Rose Miller and cho-

TRAPPERS, explorers, and woodsmen ran wild during halftime
of the Pitt-Penn State football game as they re-enacted scenes from
Pittsburgh history. The Thanksgiving Day game was the first
event of the Bicentennial Year Celebration.

bicenfennial

COLONIAL USHERS at the Bicentennial Ball were portrayed by Pitt students. The Ball, the
ﬁrst big social event of the Bicentennial year, was held in the ballroom of the Penn-Sheraton Hotel.

THE SKYSCRAPER ENGI-
NEER got into the Bicentennial
celebration by publishing a spe-
cial issue on Pittsburgh in its
200th year. From the magazine’s
modernistic white and red cover
design, to the informative, con-
cise writing about the city, the
SKYSCRAPER won new praise
for its outstanding engineering
journalism.

 

THE KILTY BAND of Carnegie Tech performed in Bicentennial activities held at the Pitt-Penn
State Thanksgiving Day game. This game was designated the oﬂicial opening of the Bicentennial
Year Program.

AT THE BICENTENNIAL GAME the history of Pittsburgh was reenacted for the 40,000 spec-
tators who braved the intense cold to see Pitt and Penn State clash and kick off the city’s Bicen-
tennial Year.

Music aids in enriching Pitt

REVIEWING the year’s performances, the Pitt Marching Band
presented their annual Stadium Review at the Carnegie Music

Hall.

DIRECTOR of the Varsity Marching Band Rob-
ert L. Aurthur has devoted years of service to
university bands and music. His hard work has
won him the respect and admiration of every
bandmember.

CONCERTS throughout the year by the Men’s Glee Club provided the University with a series of
varied programs as lighthearted as “Oklahoma” and as moving as “Ave Maria.”

student life.

Musical spirit abounded throughout the University this year,
from the professionally coached bands and singing groups, on
down to the individual student who joined with a few others
for a little ﬂat—voiced harmony.

At pep rallies and football games the vigorous, martial
music of the Varsity Marching Band, one of the top three
in the country, thrilled many a spectator. And on Saturday
afternoons, with spirit running high, and the stadium ﬁlled
with screaming fans, the words, “For Pittsburgh's glory and
the honor of our University” really meant something.

With the coming of Christmas, the music at the Univer-
sity took on the flavor of the season. From the Commons
Room, with the students gathered around the organ, the
beloved carols ﬁlled the halls, drifted up the elevator shafts,
and into the classrooms. Many conversations were inter-
rupted in the Tuck Shop by the spontaneous caroling of
groups of students, interspersing the beautiful religious songs
of Christmas with the light-hearted lyrics of “Rudolf” and
the “Chipmunk Song.”

During the remainder of the year, University functions
were brightened by the appearance of Men’s Glee Club or
Women’s Choral, whose programs were always varied, rang-
ing from Medieval student songs to modern light opera. Each
Tuesday at noon the Heinz Chapel Choir provided the spir-
itual atmosphere for the University Chapel Services. Frater-
nity and sorority parties often provided most of their enjoy-
ment during a rollicking song fest. And always, the im-
promptu quartets were heard harmonizing in the lounges
of the Student Union.

SEATED Bandsmen at the Sta-
dium Review are an unusual
sight. The Pitt student is more
accustomed to seeing the 120
piece Varsity Marching Band
bursting onto the ﬁeld with a roll
of drums and a 160 beat cadence.

A BREAK during rehearsal allows David Wise, Director of the
Glee Club, time to reﬂect on the sharpness of the attack and the
musical balance.

and mediocrity

All memories of Pitt’s dismal 4-6 record of 1957 were eradi-
cated as the Panthers rolled to four victories in their ﬁrst
ﬁve games. With impressive wins over U.C.L.A., Holy Cross,
Minnesota, and West Virginia, and with only a loss to Mich-
igan State, the public was already comparing them to the
1955 Sugar Bowl and the 1956 Gator Bowl squads.

Unlike Panther teams of the past, that were dependent on
a few key individuals, the 1958 edition was built around the
ﬁne depth that the team possessed. The only Panther
thought worthy to be picked as an All—American in pre-
season polls, John Guzik, justiﬁed his selection by standing
out for the Panthers as an offensive guard and a defensive
linebacker. The rest of the Panther line, although smaller
than the Seven Jumbos of 1957, had depth in every position.
Pitt had an outstanding trio of quarterbacks and ends and
the backﬁeld was so well stocked with talent that an injury
to any one player could not seriously hamper the team.

The Panthers opened the second half of the season by bat-
tling a previously unbeaten, untied Army team to a 14-14
tie. Now bowl conscious, the Panthers were defeated by a
strong Syracuse team, but hopes for a post season bid were
rekindled with an upset win over Notre Dame. However,
defeats at the hands of relatively weak Penn State and Ne-
braska brought to an end a season that was ﬁlled with frus-
tration and lost opportunities.

U.C.L.A.: The Panthers opened the season with an
impressive 27-6 win over the Bruins of UCLA. A
wide open offense, featuring touchdowns by Ivan
Toncic, Dick Haley, and Mike Ditka, and a ﬁeld
goal by Norton Seaman, completely overwhelmed
the Uclans. Toncic’s 56 yard runback of a Bruin
pass interception and a hard charging line sparked
the defense.

HOLY CROSS: The Blue and Gold continued to
roll as they blanked Holy Cross 17-0. The Pitt
line, led by John Guzik, was outstanding in smoth-
ering the passing attack of the Crusaders. Art Gob
caught a short pass from Toncic, and Chuck Rein-
hold went 2o yards on a double reverse for Pan-
ther touchdowns while Seaman kicked another
ﬁeld goal.

SOPHOMORE HALFBACK Chuck Reinhold out-leaps a Holy Cross
defender to grab a pass for Pitt’s second touchdown. Coach Michelosen’s

MINNESOTA: Coming from behind to score a
13-7 victory over the Gophers, the Panthers won
their third straight game and the first in the nine
game series with Minnesota. Trailing 7-0 in the
last half, Pitt scored on Kaliden’s sneak. After
missing the conversion, the Pitt Panthers then put
together a touchdown drive with only 1:34 re-
maining in the game. Kaliden scored on a sneak,
and Seaman added the unnecessary extra point.

MICHIGAN STATE: The Spartans stopped
Pitt’s winning streak with a 22-8 win in a game
highlighted by Panther miscues. Pitt, invariably
outscored in the ﬁrst half, failed to overcome the
16-0 Michigan State lead. The Panther’s scoring
came early in the fourth quarter on a 9—yard re-

WEST VIRGINIA: Ivan Toncic’s pass intercep-

zone enabled Pitt to gain their fourth victory in
ﬁve starts as they downed West Virginia 15-8. The
Panther scoring was highlighted by a spectacular
71 yard pass and run play from Toncic to John
Flara. Toncic cinched the game with a two point
Conversion on a pass to Haley.

ARMY: Undefeated Army, ranked second in the
nation, was satisﬁed to settle for a 14-14 tie
against an inspired Panther team. With the Pan-
thers trailing 14-o late in the first half, Flara took
a 43 yard pass from Kaliden, for the ﬁrst Panther
score. The conversion attempt failed, but the Pan-
thers roared back to score on a pass from Kaliden
to Jim Zanos. Haley caught a conversion pass from
Kaliden to tie the score.

SYRACUSE: The Orangemen of Syracuse used
their favorite weapon, the ﬁeld goal, to shade Pitt
16-13. As in 1957 when a ﬁeld goal proved the mar-
gin of victory for Syracuse, a three pointer by Bob
Yates was the margin of victory this year. Pitt
had taken a 13-0 lead as the result of scores by
Jim Cunningham and Fred Riddle, but failed to
stop a last minute Orange drive.

NOTRE DAME: Bill Kaliden raced ﬁve yards
around right end with only eleven seconds re-
maining to give’Pitt a 29-26 victory over Notre
Dame. Pitt jumped off to a 14-0 lead on touch-
downs by Haley and Art Gob. Trailing 20-15, the
Panthers took the lead on a score by Toncic. The
Irish came ﬁghting back behind the aerials of
George I20. I20 hit Monte Stickles for a touch-

centennial began and the University of_Pitts—
burgh’s chances for a bowl bid ended as the up-
start Nittany Lions came from behind to nip the
Panthers, 25-21. The lead changed hands time and
time again, as scoring was marked by sensational
runs by both teams. Spearheading the Panther
offense were 50-yard touchdown sprints by Ed
Sharockman and Chuck Reinhold, and a three
yard plunge by Joe Scisly.

Disappointed fans were undecided about what
had happened to the I958 Panthers, but they were
in agreement on one point—win or lose, they had
seen some memorable football.

NORTON SEAMAN lofts the football over the outstretched hands of the Penn
State linemen for another extra point. Seaman was Pitt’s extra-point and kickoff

specialist.

THE PANTHER LINE rapidly closes up the hole and gang—tackles the Nebraska fullback. Pitt’s defense was

rated as one of the best in the country.

soccer Pitt booters’ year

The Panther booters ﬁnished this season with one of the
poorest records the team has ever compiled. Hampered by
key injuries and ineligibility to top players and the graduation
of All—American Jerry Bressanelli, the Panthers were never
able to get an offensive attack together. Although ﬁve of the
losses were by only one point, the Panthers themselves were
held to shutouts in four games and never scored more than
two points in any one game.

Coach Leo Bemis had hoped to build his offensive attack
around Simon Pestich and Bob Long, and Fernando Fabregas
coming up from the freshman team. Simon Pestich was
declared ineligible and Bob Long was hampered by a broken
leg. If Pestich and Long had been leading the offense, it is
without doubt that some of the close games would have had
a diﬂferent outcome.

Fabregas, a sophomore from South America, led the team
in scoring and- assists. He scored ﬁve goals and also set up
three others. With the brunt of the offensive attack placed on
his shoulders, Fabregas came through in splendid style and
could be Pitt’s second All—American soccer player.

With ﬁfteen lettermen returning, including Long and Pes-
tich, and some top prospects from the freshman team, Coach
Bemis hopes to rebuild a top team next year.

Outstanding players this year for the Panthers were Fabre—
gas, Bob Murdoch, and Jack Horax on offense, Bill Eisenger,
Jason Shrinsky, and Ron Goga on defense.

SOCCER is not just a game of the feet, as
demonstrated by Pete Karravellas, as he
“heads” the ball toward the goal.

PRE-GAME TENSION is turned into
enthusiasm as Coach Bemis maps strat-
egy before the game. Responsible for
bringing varsity soccer to Pitt, Bemis
this year saw his team suffer from a
rash of serious injuries.

Panther grapplers ﬁnish With another

Consistently one of the most powerful wrestling squads in the
East, the Panthers proved 1958 no exception as they swept
to nine victories in ten meets. Their only loss was inﬂicted by
powerful Lehigh, who managed to edge the matmen 16-12.

After having posted a ﬁne season last year with eight wins,
two losses and a tie, Coach Perry looked forward to the re-
turn of last year’s 123 pound NCAA champion, Paul Powell,
Captain Bob Bubb, Tom Alberts, and Alex Skirpan. Larry
Lauchle, at 130 pounds, was the strongest contender up
from the freshman ranks. Peery’s ﬁne one—two punch in the
lightweight classes, Powell and Lauchle, both ﬁnished unde-
feated in dual competition, while Bubb, Skirpan, and Alberts
turned in good records in the middle classes. However, a big
letdown came in the heavier weight classes, where Perry was
unable to ﬁnd a winning combination. Tom Hall started the
season out as the number one heavyweight, but was replaced
later in the season by Bob Guzik, brother of All—American
footballer John Guzik.

After completing the season with only one defeat, Pitt was
hampered going into the Eastern championships by the loss
of Captain Bob Bubb due to an injury to his knee suffered in

ALERTNESS is the most important characteristic of any wrestler. From the opening second until the match terminates, he
must remain watchful, or any mental lapse could result in defeat.

PREPARING FOR A TAKEDOWN, Pitt’s

are no single holds that are as effective as a series
of well-planned moves.

EXERTING all his strength, Tom Hall tries to

nent. Even though Ha1l’s knees are touching, he
is not considered down until his opponent has

Hennon’s performance adds bright

AWARD-WINNING Don Hennon is presented a plaque
by Bert O’Ma1ley, President of SGA, and Pat Perri in
recognition of his ﬁne accomplishments in athletics and
scholarship.

Despite the continuous All—American play of Don Hennon,
the Panthers went down to their ﬁrst losing season since 1954.
Whereas in the past Hennon was assisted by such stars as
Julius Pegues, John Riser and Bob Lazor, this year he alone
had to bear the brunt of the scoring. In the few games in
which Don did not ﬁnish as high scorer, it was his passing and
dribbling that set up his teammates’ scoring.

The season started out with the hoopsters winning three
out of their ﬁrst four games, including a 71-56 Steel Bowl
Championship win over the city rivals, Duquesne. The Pan-
thers then went reeling to seven defeats in their next eight
games and it took an 82-75 win over an outclassed Carnegie
Tech team to restore conﬁdence to the team. The Blue and
Gold then rounded out the season with ﬁve wins in their last
six games.

Although the big name all season was Don Hennon, there
were other stalwarts on the team that took up the slack when
Hennon was off in his shooting. The brilliant play of John
Fridley, only a sophomore, ranks him as a top prospect for
the future. Not primarily a shooter, Fridley led the team in
rebounds with 215 and was a standout on defense. John
Mills, although hampered by injuries throughout the year,
managed to have an above-average season, and the steady
play of Dave Sawyer, John Mesher, and Darwin Smith was
a big factor in Pitt’s attack.

Don Hennon, in his three years of varsity competition, re-
wrote all scoring records at Pitt. The ﬁnal statistics showed
Hennon as holding records in the following: most points in
one game—45, most ﬁeld goals in a single game—2o, most
points in career——I84I, most ﬁeld goals in career—734, as
well as records in most free throws in career—395, most
points in one season—65I, most ﬁeld goals in one season—
267, and most consecutive foul—shot conversions—34.

FAVORITE MANEUVER of Don Hennon is the forced foul, which he executes by faking a shot, bending low, and
thereby causing the man trying to block the shot to come down across his back. Long hook shots, twisting drive-

proved himself a standout throughout the season with his

timely rebounding skill.

FOUL SHOOTING often means the
difference between victory and defeat
in tight games. Although basically one
of the fundamentals of basketball, foul
shooting requires constant practice
and a steady eye.

HALF TIME DISCUSSIONS
invariably began with the same
question——“How many does
Hennon have so far?”

 

HIGH FLYING Don Hennon manages to get off his ﬁeld goal attempt despite the close guarding
of Duquesne’s Red Ryan and Ned Twyman. Although constantly double and tripled teamed,
Hennon still manages to be one of the nation’s top scorers.

CONGRATULATIONS for a well played game is given to John
Mills from teammate Bill Mauro. Although the Panthers were
built around Don Hennon, Coach Bobby Timmons stressed the
team-play and co-operation that is essential for a winning team.

GOING UP for a jump shot Dave Sawyer exe-
cutes a perfect maneuver in getting the ball past
the outstretched hands of an opponent. The jump
shot has been developed into the favorite shot of
practically all ballplayers.

A TANGLE of arms, legs, and
bodies occurs as Pitt and Du-
quesne players scramble for a
loose ball. Good ball handling
and alertness was one depart-
ment in which the Panthers
seemed relatively weak.

A FAST BREAK is executed against Pitt as a
Panther opponent breaks past Don Hennon on
his way to the goal. However, Pitt made good use
of such situations for their share of the scoring.

Pitt swimmers capture Easterns

The Pitt mermen,perennially one of the powerhouses of swim-
ming in the east, bounced back from a mediocre 5-5 season in
1958 to a successful 7-3 season that was topped 0H by the
capturing of the Eastern Championships. This marked the
seventh championship that the Panthers have captured under
the guidance of head coach Ben Brady.

Hampered by the lack of their own pool, the Blue and
Gold must always practice twice as hard as their opponents,
and also lack that all—important advantage of facing the foe
on their own home grounds. Despite this problem, the Pan-
thers still managed to post a ﬁne season record. The mermen
swept to victories in their ﬁrst three meets by defeating Mary-
land, North Carolina State, and Lehigh, before being soundly
defeated by a strong Navy contingent. The reeling Panthers
were then defeated by Ohio, but bounced back to defeat
Rutgers, N.Y.U., and Syracuse. The Blue and Gold ﬁnished
up the regular season by crushing West Virginia 62-24, but
were beaten by Kenyon. The Panthers paced by VVillis
Weisz in the backstroke, and the crack 400 relay team, caused
a mild upset by winning the Eastern Championships.

Stalwarts of the team were Tony Treser in the sprint races,
Willis Weisz, backstroke, Jerry Irwin in diving, and the re-
lay team, usually composed of Weisz, Emert, Chuck Nanz,
and Ken Cooper. The ﬁne balance of the team was rounded
out by Lou Durbin, Lon Paganini, and Pat Fitzgerald.

Panther gymnasts break even

DAVE HIRST comes to the top of his swing as
he begins his routine on the high bar. Long hours
of practice and conditioning are put in before
the gymnast even begins to seriously consider
competing in an event.

Despite the fact that most of their meets were against some of
the ﬁnest teams in the East, the Panther gymnasts managed
to ﬁnish up the season with a respectable 3-3 record. Al-
though All—American Tom Darling, last season’s leading
scorer, was lost by graduation, Coach Warren Neiger looked
for a better season this year. The return of Dave Hirst, who
was sidelined last year by injuries, bolstered the Blue and
Gold’s chances in the highbar, ﬂying rings, and tumbling.
However, the loss of Joe Battaglia early in the season as a
result of a pulled Achilles tendon hampered the Panthers in
not one event, but three. Battaglia participated in the rope
climb and ﬂying rings in addition to his specialty of tumbling.

The Panthers managed to post victories over Syracuse,
West Virginia, and Temple, were narrowly edged by a strong
Army team and beaten by only eight points by Navy. The
Blue and Gold ﬁnished up the season against arch—rival Penn
State, and proved no equal as State, led by Olympic Cham-
pion Armando Vega, thrashed Pitt 55-38.

Hirst ended up the year as Pitt’s top scorer, followed by
Don Kasner and John Marcinko.

Hosting the two—day Eastern Gymnastics championships
for the ﬁrst time in years, the Panthers proved disappointing
in not being able to ﬁnish ﬁrst in one event. Led again by
Vega, Penn State managed to make a shambles of the meet
by sweeping eight titles and ﬁnishing strong in seconds and

thirds.

CLIMBING THE ROPE is the specialty of
Pitt’s John Felman. The event starts with the
competitor ﬁrst measuring the rope, then coming
to a sitting position for the starting pose, and
then the long climb up the rope. The tamboline
at the top is smeared with inkblack, and the
climber must touch this and show the smudge on
his hand to verify that he has reached the top.

Non-varsity athletes participate through

Intramural athletics play an important part in the campus
life of the Pitt student. By a well—planned, well—rounded
intramural program, the student is offered a way to partic-
ipate in sports at school. This program is provided for all to
compete in, and the success is apparent when the number of
competitors is taken into account. Teams are ﬁelded from
fraternities, sororities, engineering departments, professional
schools, and practically every student organization on cam-
pus. Pitt publications even sponsor a “Pulitzer Bowl” to
decide the inter—publications champion.

The student who cannot be a member of a varsity team is
offered a chance to exhibit his skills among his schoolmates
in a number of sports. Not only are the major sports such as
football, basketball, softball, wrestling, and track featured,
but even minor sports such as ping—pong, bowling, squash,
badminton, and golf are offered so that every student can
participate.

The competition does not remain solely on campus, but
spreads to other schools as well. Annually, intermural foot-
ball champions play the winner from Carnegie Tech and
Duquesne in an attempt to gain the city intermural cham-
pionship.

Although the main purpose of the intramural program is
to furnish the students with an opportunity to participate
in any sport, the underlying purpose is to promote better
sportsmanship and a closer relationship between the students.

 

INTRAMURAL VOLLEY BALL games provide the stu-
dent with an outlet after a hard day at school. In addition
to volleyball there is competition in almost every sport,
from football to bridge.

SWIMMING is just one of the many intramural sports in which
coeds compete. For women, as Well as men, intramurals offer
excellent recreational opportunities.

varsity.

FOOTBALL is one of the most highly competitive intramural sports on campus, With teams par-
ticipating from fraternities, schools, and independent groups.

EDITOR Millard Amdur must keep in contact
with his information sources for the PITT NEWS.
One direct result of his penetrating editorials was
the great inﬂux of letters to the paper.

CHECKING and proofreading consumes a great
deal of time, but is necessary to assure the best

OWL possible.

Staffs Work long into the night

Of all the windows in the forty—two ﬂoors of the Cathedral of
Learning, the ones that are lighted the most are the windows
of the eighth ﬂoor—the home of Pitt’s publications. Long
after the classroom lights are out and the administrative
oﬁices are dimmed, the eighth ﬂoor retains its life. Here the
staffs spend long hours, and often sleepless nights, meeting
deadlines in order to bring to Pitt students the news and
views of campus life through the best in college publications.

Pitt publications are many and varied, but each one acts
as a window on campus. Through the PITT NEWS, students
are able to View daily happenings at Pitt, both in perspective
and retrospect. The SKYSCRAPER ENGINEER and the
PITT CAPSULE provide sketches of their respective profes-
sions both inside and outside of the University. And through
the pages of the OWL, a panorama of the year at Pitt appears
for students in all the University schools.

Because of the long hours spent in publishing the best pos-
sible publication, the various staffs often develop among
their members a unity that is unequaled in most other cam-
pus activities. When the deadlines are met and the ﬁnished
copy in the hands of the students, the members of Pitt pub-
lications experience a deep sense of pride. They not only have
memories of long hours of work and fun, but they also have
tangible proof that they were hours well worth the time and

effort.
