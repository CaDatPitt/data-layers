DEAN H. EDMUND FRIESELL has a tooth—not an ordinary
tooth, but an eight foot long tooth—a perfect specimen.
It is the tooth of a unicorn whale or narwhale. Dr. Friesell
purchased this tooth at a whaling station in Norway while
on one of his world trips in search of dental oddities. The
ﬁeld of dentistry is both Dean Friesell’s vocation and avoca- -
tion; he is intensely interested in the progress of dentistry
and has contributed more than his share in increasing the
wealth of knowledge available in the profession. Toward
this end Dr. Friesell keeps in contact with antique book
dealers all over the globe, and sends a rush order for any
book that may not be in his Dental School library. The
library and the museum of the Dental School are Dr.
Friesell's pride and joy, and well they might be, for his
own private Collections were the nuclei of both. Dr.’
Friesell uses what spare time he has writing books and.
papers on dentistry.

Through his extensive research and profound interest in
the dental profession Dean Friesell has brought nation-wide
recognition to the University’s Dental School. The school

occupies three buildings on campus and additional space in
the old Mellon Institute. Its facilities and its faculty are
increased each year. At present there is one faculty member
for every 3.1 students. Some of the recent improvements
in the department include an addition of diagnostic equip-
ment, sixty new chairs, orthodentia equipment, and the
establishment of the dental library in the old Mellon In-

H. EDMUND FRIESELL
Dean of the School of Dmtiytrjr

stitute. The Dental School, however, is conservative in its
principles and methods. It will not accept any equipment
without ﬁrst having it thoroughly tested for efficiency and
practicability.

The Dental School was chartered in 1896. In 1905,
under the leadership of Dr. Friesell, it emerged as an im-
portant part of the University. The Dental course is six
years in length, two and one—half years of which are spent
in the Inﬁrmary doing actual dental work. One of the
greatest ‘collections of dental literature in existence, con-
taining early and rare volumes, is found in the department
library, acclaimed the best of its kind in the world, and
containing thirty thousand volumes in all.

DENTAL FACULTY

 

DR. T. F. MCBRIDE

 

 

DR. W. H. ARCHER

DR. E. G. MEISEL

They are known as “the boys up on the hill"; but by
no means do they keep themselves isolated. The Dents
are justly proud of their well—equipped laboratories; they
claim a monopoly on that intangible thing known as
Pitt spirit; and above all, they point with pride to their
highly competent faculty of which Drs. Archer, McBride,
and Meisel are outstanding members.

Dr. W. Harry Archer, teacher of post-graduate courses
in anesthesia and exodontia, has had a rapid rise in the
Pitt Dental School. Beginning as a demonstrator in the
department of anesthesia and exodontia in 1927 he now
has the title of assistant professor. At the present time,
Dr. Archer holds the enviable posts of chairmanship of
the Executive Committee of the Eastern Society of Anes-
thetists and chairmanship of the Executive Committee
of the Pitt Dental Alumni Association.

Dr. T. F. McBride's imposing list of duties ﬁnds him

100

as a part-time instructor in the Examining Department
and Lecturer in Ethics and Technical composition, an
associate member of the dental staff of Shadyside Hos-
pital, and a member of the International Association for
Dental Research. Much of his work has been in the ﬁeld
of dental journalism, having been alumni editor of Dental
Rays for the past five years, which has been stated to be
“the most outstanding journal in its field."

Dr. Emanuel George Meisel guides the dentists-to-be
as professor of Dental Pathology, Radiography, Clinical
Dental Pathology, and Therapeutics. His work in these
fields has earned the placque awarded to him by the
Odontological Society of Western Pennsylvania for meri-
torious service for 1924-1935. Dr. Meisel is also a trustee
of the American Dental Association and Chairman of the
journal Committee of the Association.

To the Dents, the Dental Student Council is a student governing body of high
dignity whose aims are to promote the moral, intellectual, social, and physical wel-
fare of the Dental School, to encourage a spirit of cooperation among students and
faculty, and to ﬁnd solutions to the problems arising among the dental students . To
the student body on the University campus it represents a deeper meaning. It symbol-
izes an association of members that bears a reputation as an initiator of football
cheers and parades and as the strongest cohering body of supporters behind our foot-
ball team.

Through the council, the dental students have been taught to mix their educational
life with the school social life when they deemed it necessary to do so. At all cheer-
ing sections and pep assemblies, the Dents ﬁll the atmosphere with a long cheer
that creeps down the spines of all people within hearing distance. No one who
heard those chants ever doubted the strong harmony of “those Dents." They show
their school spirit and loyalty at the opportune time, yet, the Council when meeting
behind closed chambers is a group of intelligent, fair minded, and serious thinking
members.

The Council was organized by dental students in 1925. Membership is by pro-
portional representation. Oﬂicers of the Senior, Junior, Pre-Junior and Pre-Sophomore
classes automatically became a member, and for every ﬁfty students in each class,
there is one elected representative. In the Council there are also live faculty advisors
appointed by the Dean of the School.

Because of the association with learned faculty members, the representatives have
an opportunity to discuss problems of professional concern. They learn to develop
leadership through the coordination of undergraduate and upper classrnen dental
students. Here begins the emphasis on loyalty and cooperation which is a great part
in the education of a Dent.

Known as the only council on the campus as being quite independent, the Dental
Interfraternity Council regulates its own competitive rushing and solves its own
problems entirely on its own. To substantiate this assertion, the Council discarded
their old Constitution this year and revised and formulated one which will cope with
present needs and problems. The amending of the Constitution resulted from the
provision pertaining to dental fraternity rushing and from the lack of stated penalties
in event fraternities or its members did not abide by the laws set forth in the docu-
ment. The Council decided to amend only these two conditions, but upon consider-
ing the entire document, they found it unsuitable for present conditions. The new
constitution schedules meetings for once each month, and enforces its laws through
a judiciary composed of three faculty members, one of which is Dean of the Dental
School. Although the old Constitution was not dated the Council believes it to have
been in existence for about ten years.

The Council of six students and three faculty members centers its attention upon
the advancement of the Dental profession and the governing of the three professional
dental fraternities at the University; Psi Omega, Delta Sigma Delta, and Alpha
Omega. It is a branch of the National Dental Interfraternity Council which was
founded in Chicago in 1922.

Although problems of dentistry is its foremost function, the Council is neverthe-
less interested in its fraternities socially. It sponsors its own interfraternity athletic
programs, and sets up its own trophy which is given to one of the three dental fra-
ternities gaining victory in basketball, mushball, billiards, bridge, table tennis,
bowling, and swimming. From the Council come the solutions to the fraternity
problems, a.nd legislation for the betterment of the individual group organization.

When other dental fraternities gave up their monthly clinics this year, members
of Delta Sigma Delta continued their research in this ﬁeld to further knowledge of
dental surgery. Recent clinics on oral surgery, exodontia, and orthodontia were
held in the chapter house. At these meetings discussions relating to academic work
were undertaken to aid undergraduates with their studies, and prominent men from
Pittsburgh dental laboratories spoke on dentistry and its allied ﬁelds. Three times
during the year the undergraduates held combined meetings with the auxiliary mem-
bers of Delta Sigma Delta.

In contrast to the social fraternities’ full week of rushing, dental fraternities rushed
for only ﬁve days. During that period each fraternity had its special night. Follow-
ing the customary house smoker, Delta Sigma Delta brothers and rushees were en-
tertained at several soirées.

Late in October two of the brothers attended the national convention of Delta
Sigma Delta in St. Louis. They returned in time to entertain the boys with conven-
tion stories at an after-game house dance of which the Delta Sigs were hosts to their
alumni and out-of-town undergraduates.

At the end of the year the fraternity held its summer formal, always considered
the event on the Delta Sigma Delta social calendar. Each year, too, the national
organization meets in one of the large cities. This year, officers of the University

chapter attended the convention at Chicago and assisted in the annual election of

national officers.

V “Clean Up" might have been the slogan for Psi Omega, dental fraternity, during
the past year, for its members applied the words in their several interpretations to
make the organization one of the most active in the Dentistry School. The chapter
house was painted, re-furnished, and re—decorated, and recreation rooms and a labora-
tory were built into the basement. Psi Omega also began a movement to put their

» activities program in the fore and set out to capture the dental interfraternity sports
trophy. The trophy, a permanent one, is awarded in recognition of competence
in sports from bridge to swimming.

Psi Omega held its annual summer formal on May 26 at the Chartiers Country
Club. Len Mahlvern and his orchestra played for the occasion which was the most
important social event of the fraternity. Pledge smokers were held also during the
year and a banquet and initiation ceremony was held at the University Club. The
large alumni attendance at the Easter, Thanksgiving and Christmas banquets as well
as the other fraternity functions was proof of Psi Omega's ability to provide a bal-
anced social calendar.

The dental clinics which Psi Omega conducted were discontinued this year, but
Dr. Bielski's soap models on dental subjects became a satisfactory substitute to aid
the fraternity members in their studies along lines of chosen profession. One of the
aims of the fraternity is to promote advancement in dentistry as well as establish
friendly cooperation between the profession and students.

Founded in 1897 through the efforts of Dr.  S. Ashbrook and Dr. Friesell, Psi
Omega is a chapter of a national fraternity. It has 22 active members who meet in
business sessions twice each month, and it is a member of the Dental Interfraternity
Council. The Prater, published quarterly, links together the activities of the 36 active
and 61 alumni chapters of Psi Omega throughout the world.

During 1938 and 1939 members of Alpha Omega took an active part in the
Dental Interfraternity sports program, despite the arduous work expected of
dental students. In the fall A.O., the only Jewish dental-fraternity on campus,
held a smoker for its alumni, members and pledges. Plans for a membership
drive and the year's social activities were outlined at this smoker, following
which pledges were announced. Later in the semester several new members
were initiated into the group, and the active enrollment was also increased by
the addition of two transfer students.

The intention of the local chapter is to foster social recreation, to spur pro-
fessional and intellectual achievement, and to make the college dental training
a most important force in the lives of the undergraduates and alumni.

Since its organization in _Philadelphia in 1909, Alpha Omega has increased
rapidly. At the present time it has numerous chapters and is international in
scope. It was formed by the consolidation of the Ramach Fraternity founded
at the Pennsylvania College of Dental Surgery in 1906 and the Alpha Omega
Dental Fraternity founded at the University of Maryland in 1907. In the fall
of 1920 the “Odons Club," dental organization on the Pitt campus became the

Omicron Chapter of Alpha Omega.

FRANK W. SHOCKLEY
/lctirzg Dam of the 36/200] of Edizcafioiz

MR. FRANK WILLIAM SHQCKLEY has reached a conclusion:
as far as he is concerned a twelve-month-a-year-day-and-
night job leaves no time for hobbies and outside interests.
As director of the University Extension Division and Sum-
nzer Session, and as acting Dean of the School of Education,
Mr. Shockley proved to be one of the University's busiest
men during 1937-38. And then, to top it all, he was ap-
pointed director of Late Afternoon, Evening, and Saturday
Classes. Yet, with all his responsibilities, Mr. Shockley

. . Imcbcmr-to-/Jr are taught"

has retrained the same pleasant, digniﬁed executive with
the ready humor and the frequent smile. Perhaps the secret
of his good humor is contained in his attitude toward his
work. Mr. Shockley ﬁnds his work so enjoyable, so rich
with human interest, that “life is one grand vacation."

Active in public school work until 1917, Mr. Shockley
became interested in extension work at the University of
Indiana, of which he is a graduate. Later he became as-
sistant to the dean in the extension division of the Univer-
sity of Wisconsin, and in 1925 assumed his present position
at Pitt. Mr. Shockley's reputation is nation-wide, for he
was former president of the National University Extension
Association, and His name is included in the current W50’:
Who In America.

The desire to serve others, which is the aim of many
sincere students, reaches fulﬁllment in the School of Educa-
tion. The building of character and the educating of chil-
dren is a signiﬁcant problem calling for the assistance of
superior people. For this reason, before an applicant can
be accepted into the School of Education he must be inter-
viewed for scholarship, capability, teaching, aptitude, and
personality. Only those students meeting these exact re-
quirements receive admission to the School. Once admitted,
the Education student must choose a major course,_ bowing
to the exigency of an age of specialization. He then supple-
ments this course with a related course and with a study of
progressive teaching techniques. The University of Pitts-
burgh School of Education, one of the most extensive in the
country, offers training in all the standard ﬁelds of peda-
gogy: commercial, elementary, kindergarten, primary,
physical education, secondary, vocational, and nurses’
training. Although the main body of the school consists
of its 525 junior and senior students, a great many graduates
take advantage of its facilities. Cognizant of rigid occupa-
tional schedules which the graduate must maintain, classes
in Education have been planned for later afternoons, eve-
nings, and Saturday mornings.

EDUCATION

126

Ef\('}l?\'l*.lih‘.E

Acting as co—ordinator of the various engineering de-
partments is Mr. Elmer Allen Holbrook, Dean of the Schools
of Engineering and Mines. Dean Holbrook has an impres-
sive teaching record chalked up for himself. He has held
the position of Dean of the Graduate School at Penn State,
has taught at Nova Scotia Technical College, and was pre-
fessor of mining at the University of Illinois. Outside of the
classroom, he has acted as technical adviser on coal for
NRA, was superintendent of mines in Montana, British
Columbia, and Mexico, and has worked with the United
States Bureau of Mines at Washington and Pittsburgh. Dean
Holbrook has built up through hard and efficient work the

espect and admiration of all his student engineers; for his
vast experiences and good common sense have labeled him
as a leader and an adviser extraordinaire.

Training in technical supervision and management of
engineering industries is the objective sought by most
schools for their student engineers. The School of Engineer-
ing at the University supplements this training with a
broad program of liberal arts and cultural advantages of the
college which enables engineering graduates to be leaders
in society as well as technicians.

With the moving of the University administrative offices
from State Hall to the Cathedral, centralization of the
School of Engineering was made possible. Until they were
consolidated in State and Thaw Halls, the departments were
scattered over the campus and downtown, making efficient
scheduling difiicult as well as making uniﬁcation of the stu-
dent body almost impossible. Since the change, a marked
increase in morale has been evident on the parts of both
students and faculty. Indications are that the School of
Engineering will be the first undergraduate school to take
part in University affairs as an organized group, a distinction
now held by the School of Dentistry.

The School is divided into seven departments embracing
as many branches of the field, which control almost entirely

their own student groups. They are the departments of
Civil, Mechanical, Electrical, Aeronautical, Chemical,
General, and Industrial Engineering. The dean's ofiice is
now principally a place of coordination rather than of de-
tailed administration. Nation-wide recognition has been
accorded the School of Engineering by outstanding techni-
cal schools and engineering societies. The American Insti-
tute of Chemical Engineers has placed the School on its
accredited list of schools offering chemical engineering.

 BILL, he'll fix‘ it up. You can depend on him for a
square deal,” is the attitude of the meds and pre-meds when
they need help. “Bill" is Dr. William S. McEllroy, Dean
of the School of Medicine. A student here himself in 1912,
Dr. McEllroy thoroughly understands the trials and tribu-
lations of all undergraduates. Athletics interested him then‘
as they do now, and he received a letter in football as well
as a place on the Varsity tennis team. He has risen from the
position of assistant instructor to that of Dean of the school.
In 1917 a leave of absence was granted Dr. McEllroy to
serve as lieutenant, junior grade, in the Medical Reserve of
the U. S. Navy. Even though he has much to do in his new
position as Dean, he finds time to work on the staffs of the
Magee Hospital, the Children’s Hospital, the Presbyterian

Hospital, and the St. Francis Hospital. In addition to his
regular duties he has conducted research studies in blood
pigment, protein and iron, metabolism, kidney functions,

determination of reducing sugars, and anemias.

During his many years at Pitt Dr. McEllroy has seen
important and advanced changes take place, not only in the
physical makeup of the University, but in the supervisory
staff. Where formerly Pennsylvania Hall housed the entire
Nledical School, it now has only two of the departments:
Anatomy and Pathology. Other departments have been

established in the old Mellon Institute. This expansion has

u

 

created a better environment for the students and makes
work easier through the use of advanced types of equip-
ment. The Medical School, under the experienced hand of
Dr. McEllroy, is well able to prepare men for professional
medical service. Students are given an understanding of
medical ethics and history, which enables them to fulﬁll
their duty in alleviating the suffering of others. Besides the
Medical center, the School includes the nearly completed
Western State Psychiatry Hospital, to be used for teaching

purposes, a new women's wing on the Presbyterian Hos-

pital, and the proposed Municipal Hospital, to be built on _ _

University property on Terrace Street.

MEDICAL FACULTY

 

DR. C. E. ZIEGLER

"Growing larger!" Year by year one can watch this
very process in the University of Pittsburgh Medical
School, focal point of a Medical center that continues to
expand. Freshmen and Sophomores moved into the old
Mellon Institute building on O'Hara street, altered to
provide the finest type of facilities for their first two years
of work. The move actually doubled the space occupied
by the Meds. The first ﬂoor of the remodeled building
contains the library stacks and the student lounge and
locker rooms. On the second ﬂoor are the administrative
0H‘lCCS and the library. The library which formerly con-
tained the Mellon collection, has been enlarged and is
now the combined Dental and Medical library. The
third ﬂoor is devoted entirely to the department of physi-
ological chemistry. The department of industrial hygiene
and the department of pharmacology are on the fourth
ﬂoor. The ﬁfth ﬂoor is given over completely to student
and research labs for the department of physiology.

Added to the aforementioned growth comes the new
Presbyterian Hospital. Conveniently; located on the
campus, it will be used for the teaching of clinical medi-
cine, and surgery. Within full View of the Medical
buildings the shell of the new state psychiatry hospital
has risen up, and ground has been broken for the erec-
tion of a new municipal hospital. Little wonder that

139

 

DR. D. HEARD

people have begun to look to this Oakland center to be
the greatest Medical center in the world.

To the responsible position as dean of this growing
school oﬂicial appointment has been made of Dr. William
S. McEllroy. Officially appointed by the Board of Trus-
tees, he was however, the unanimous choice of the Medi-
cal School faculty when they were asked to suggest one
or more names for deanship to replace the late Dr.
Raleigh Russell Huggins. Himself a graduate of the
University school he now heads, he has been associated
with it as instructor, professor, and assistant dean since
his graduation in 1916, and has been a vital part in its
growth.

To Dr. McEllroy is given the ability and privilege of
heading in the University of Pittsburgh Medical School
probably as fine a group of medical teachers and practi-
tioners as has ever been gathered for work in one place.
Among those who are affectionately remembered by de-
parting seniors is Dr. Charles Edward Ziegler, Professor
and Head of the Department of Obstetrics, under whose
supervision they have worked and studied at Magee Hos-
pital. Equally revered is Dr. James Delaven Heard who
has seen students leave the medical school and later be-
come successful physicians since 1909 when he became
associate professor of medicine and head of the depart-
ment in 1913.

FRESHMEN

Freshman wonder, sophomores ponder, juniors
think, and seniors work up at the Med school. Every
first year man wonders whether he is expected to learn
everything, what the lecturer said about a situation,
and how hard the work ahead of him will be. After
three months he wonders why he hasn't seen his first
patient yet and then dashes OH to read the posted
grade lists. Awe for the ‘seniors ﬁlls his mind and he
almost tips his hat as they pass. ‘Instructors amuse
and distress him, ending lectures with “Carry on," and
answering questions with, "Look it up in de book."
Sleepless nights before anatomy exams are burdened

with haunting memories and questions: "Where did

this thing come from?"

 

FOUR YEARS IN

Anatomy

SOPHOMORE

With a year of "experience" behind him the sopho-
more becomes used to being called "Doctor" by rev-
erent patients, whom he doesn’t knovxg what to do
with. Applying his anatomy he now ponders over
the questions of Pathology, more than ever question-
ing—~"Is it learnable?" Faculty observance of rolling
bones is annoying; frog tracings evoke strings of epi-
thets. Seniors are attributed with magic qualities such
as walking on water; freshmen are pitied. Surgery
ﬁnally shows the path to a goal and the student is on

his way.

Treatment

SENIOR

The senior works—when he isn't trying to eat. Ob-
stetrical duties at the Magee; blood pressure every two
hours; laboratory work all evening; assorted tasks
driving him on. Handling of patients: “Quiet, Sonny,
don't yell so loud, (I've studied frogs and rabbits for
three years to see what makes you tick)" From hos-
pital to hospital, Magee, Mercy, Saturday mornings
at the Falk Clinic, the senior dashes. Psychiatry falls
in at odd moments. They’re all mere mortals. Gradu-

ation looms up, all climaxes into a year of internship.

Diagnosis

 

141

JUNIOR

junior men are brain men after two years of prepara-
tion. Drugs and applications become new worries.
Clinical autopsies and partner's pranks become normal
events. Correct diagnosis, differential diagnosis, eti-
ology practically practised, with experienced instruc-
tors offering assistance and preventing serious errors,
all become the order of the day. Operative technique,
positions, presentations are everyday observances.
Conferences on patients are decided by formulas;

Dermatology is a new interest—all dropped for a

hurried trip to Magee.

One of the highest honors that a medical student can aspire to is membership in
Alpha Omega Alpha. This fraternity is the equivalent in medicine of Phi Beta Kappa
for the academic students and Sigma Xi for scientists. It is the only honorary medical
fraternity of its kind in the United States and Canada, and taps only a selected few
to membership. Their aim is toward high ideas in thought and action in the Medical
School, promotion of the best in medical practice, and raising the standards of schol-
arship and professional ethics among the students. Fellow students and teachers
judge candidates on the following points: scholarship, moral character, and future
promise of attainment in their chosen profession, and those judged worthy of the
honor of membership in the fraternity are tapped in the spring, during their junior
year in Medical School. A small percentage of the class is tapped to carry on the
work of the fraternity during their senior year in school.

The Alpha Omega Alpha holds meetings every two weeks in which Medical
matters are discussed. It is in these meetings that the real service of the fraternity
to its members is rendered, for all are inspired to work harder toward perfection in
their profession.

The ﬁrst chapter of Alpha Omega Alpha was founded at the College of Physicians
and Surgeons in Chicago by Dr. William Webster Root._ Other medical schools
recognized the need for an organization of this type to promote the medical profes-
sion, and as a result forty chapters have been installed. The chapter at the Univer-
sity, Gamma, was founded in 1916 through the efforts of Dr. C. C. Guthrie, the fra-
ternity’s faculty advisor. Many of the prominent physicians in Western Pennsylvania
are alumni of the University chapter. The active membership of the Pittsburgh
chapter is eight men from the present class.

Phi Delta Epsilon since 1912 when Nu chapter was founded at the University,
has maintained a high standard of scholarship, activities and personal qualifications
for membership into the group. A strong, national honorary fraternity in medicine,
if had its start at Cornell University in 1904.

In order that they might supplement their classroom knowledge along lines de-
sired by the members, and to get a better view of the medical profession and the

problems which confront it, the Phi Delts have instituted a series of monthly clinical
discussions. Meeting at the Hotel Schenley once every three weeks, they have on

several occasions entertained outstanding members of the profession. Among other
speakers of the past year was Dr. Shapiro who discussed interesting neurological

conditions, and on another occasion the members studied the process and effects of
hypnotism.
To most Phi Delts their alumni members are as familiar as their active brothers.

They have found that the associations they make in fraternal activities with both
undergraduate and alumni brothers have beneﬁted them in their medical studies and
tended to develop the character and leadership that has brought men to the front
in the medical profession. In the spring when books have been closed and exams
passed, the alums fete the brothers at an annual banquet. Here men who have
been pledged early in the year are initiated into the regular roll of Phi Delta Epsilon.
For the outgoing seniors the Phi Delts give a farewell dance. But it is only farewell
to active undergraduate days for once a Phi Delt, always a Phi Delt.

The educational program of Phi Rho Sigma proved particularly advantageous to
freshman students in the School of Medicine during the past year, for the fraternity
gave the men frequent opportunities to observe and study both the theoretical and

practical sides of their chosen profession—medicine. Early in the year the freshmen .

made a tour of Dixmont Hospital for a ﬁrst—hand study of the methods and equipment
employed in treatment of patients there. They also participated - in the surgical
clinics which the fraternity sponsored. Movies presenting modern medical problems
and their solutions were shown to members of Phi Rho Sigma at their monthly meet-
ings, where alumni speakers also addressed them on similar topics of interest to the
future doctors of Western Pennsylvania.

Realizing that “all medicine and no pleasure make a poor prescription," Phi Rho
Sigma members were entertained at a variety of dances and parties throughout the
year. Among these were a Halloween party for members and alumni, a spring formal,
and an initiation banquet. The brothers danced in the Continental Room of the Hotel
Schenley in March, and their formal banquet on April 21 was held at the Roosevelt
Hotel. Initiation ceremonies in which new members were formally inducted into
membership in the fraternity were held in November following a party at the Shano-
pin Country Club. Dr. Alexander H. Colwell, past president of the Pennsylvania
State Medical Society was guest speaker.

Phi Rho Sigma, a member of the Inter-Fraternity Council, has established a
Chapter loan fund upon which seniors may draw when necessary, Dr. Paul McLain,
chapter advisor and assistant professor of physiology, is editor of the national journal
of the fraternity.

One of the best known organizations up at the Medical School is the Student
Medical Society. Corresponding to the professional American Medical Society, this
group is a national organization represented at the University by a most active unit.
Its main purpose is to promote cooperation among members of the various classes of
the School of Medicine and to give to its members social activities.

In the fall a reception was held in the Old Mellon Institute at which Dr. Daven-
port Hooker addressed the members and freshman guests. Frequent meetings were
held during the school year, at which various guest speakers were presented to the
Group. Through contacts with these speakers who are usually men active in the
medical profession, the students were brought in closer touch with the viewpoints
and ideas of those already in the profession. New members to the society were an-
nounced at the annual spring dance.

To record their social and scientiﬁc advancement, members of the Student Medical
Society published a yearbook entitled Pitt Panrea. The national publication T/2:
journal was issued monthly to the members. In an effort to augment the academic
knowledge which the medical students received in their classes, the Society also con-
ducts monthly forums at which place medical matters of current interest were in-
vestigated and studied by the members. Outstanding among the contributions of
the Student Medical Society to the School of Medicine has been the establishment
and maintenance of a student loan fund for deserving medical students who needed
ﬁnancial assistance to continue their studies.

SCHOOL OF PHARMACY

C. LEONARD O'CoNNELL
Dean of School of Pharmacy

PRESIDENT of the Civic Club of Allegheny County, chair-
man of the Board of Managers of the Juvenile Court, former
president of the state pharmacy society, and Dean of the
University of Pittsburgh School of Pharmacy. That is Dr.
C. Leonard O'Connell, gentleman and scholar, man of varied
interests and a sense of civic duty, friend of all the students
who enter his division of the University. Dean O'Connell,
a native Pittsburgher and graduate of the University, guides
the destinies of the Pharmacy School with full knowledge
of the responsibilities of a leader of students. And in just
such a manner does he concern himself with his work as
chairman of the Board of Managers of the Juvenile Court in
which he has been interested for several years. His sense of
understanding carries through to Dr. O'Connell’s work at
school, for he concerns himself with the progress of each
student that enters the School of Pharmacy, giving guidance
and aid whenever he can. Dr. O'Connell’s degrees include
a Ph.G., an A.B., and a Phar.D., all from the University of
Pittsburgh, and an honorary Ph.M. from the Philadelphia
College of Pharmacy and Science.

150

Four years of long and intensive study are required of the
students who attend the School of Pharmacy. In the build-
ing at the Boulevard of the Allies and Pride Street, the
young men and women work toward perfection in their pro-
fession under the guidance of Dean O’Connell. Founded in
1878, the Pittsburgh College of Pharmacy merged with the
Western University of Pennsylvania in 1896 and became the
School of Pharmacy. Since that time its facilities have ex-
panded until today it holds a prominent place among phar-
macy schools in the country. A library of 4800 volumes,
most of which are of special interest to pharmacists and
pharmacy students, is provided for their use. Also available
are the principal pharmaceutical periodicals received regu-
larly by the library.

An opportunity for students to study, at first hand,
plants which yield pharmaceutical drugs is afforded through
the medicinal plant garden maintained in Schenley Park.

This garden, now in its thirteenth year of operation, com-P

prises two plots of ground, totaling eighteen acres. The
course at the Pharmacy School is not all work and no play.
There are several organizations that take students’ minds
off the burdens of study. Two fraternities and a sorority
sponsor many affairs each year for social enjoyment. A long
record of achievement is the proud boast of the School of
Pharmacy, for, since its founding sixty-one years ago, thou-
sands of capable pharmacists have been graduated from the
school.

Contributing much in the line of entertainment for its members who work long
hours each day learning the fundamentals of their profession at the Pittsburgh Col-
lege of Pharmacy, Alpha Zeta Omega, one of the social and professional fraternities
at the school, sets a pace that is pleasant to follow.

Bill Green's Casino was the scene of the fraternity's pledge dance held in January.
Family night for the members took place in February at the Keystone Hotel. Local
district conventions, which gave the members a chance to get together with the
alumni and leaders of the profession in Western Pennsylvania, were a regular quar-
terly feature of fraternity life for the AZO's. A formal stag was held in March at
the Pittsburgh Athletic Association, and new members were initiated into AZO a
month earlier. ‘

An event long remembered by all who attended was the annual spring formal in
May.

Aside from social activities, Alpha Zeta Omega has a serious purpose. The fra-
ternity was founded for the purpose of improving and promoting pharmacy as a

profession. In following this ideal, the local chapter has made a very important

step at the pharmacy school. A fund is maintained for students who, through lack
of funds, must borrow their tuition in order to complete their pharmacy education.
The organization also maintains an interest in all organizations concerned with bet-
tering the pharmacy profession.

There are 17 undergraduate and alumni chapters of the fraternity in the United
States and Canada, with the local chapter dating back to 1928. AZO at Pitt numbers
150 undergraduates and alumni. The official fraternity publication is the Azamz.

One of the largest fraternities in the School of Pharmacy is Beta Kappa chapter
of Kappa Psi, national pharmaceutical fraternity. In addition to conducting phar-
maceutical research, the fraternity tried in many ways to promote sociability as well
as odontology. Beta Kappa's calendar listed social functions almost every month,
most outstanding of which were the annual fall dance and the formal dance in the
spring. The fall dance was held at Bill Green's Casino in October and the formal
dance took place in May. Several smokers for pledges preceded the January and June
‘zrough session" initiation ceremonies at South Park, and third degree smokers for
the new members were also held.

Publication of the annual Beta Kappa N cm was resumed this year, and the national
Kappa Pu’ Mark also resumed publication for its 57 active chapters.

Dean O'Connell of the Pharmacy School was the first grand vice-regent of the na-
tional organization which was founded 60 years ago to unite persons of good char-
acter and to encourage scholarship and research. Beta Kappa chapter has been in
existence at the University since 1913. Only men ranking in the upper third of the
School of Pharmacy were tapped to membership in Kappa Psi which had 24 active

members this year.

Founded with the purpose of promoting sociability and professional interest
among women in pharmacy, Lambda Kappa Sigma lives up to that ideal through a
program which combines study with social activity. The national fraternity was
founded at the Massachusetts College of Pharmacy in 1913. Five years later the local
chapter, Delta, was organized at the Pittsburgh College of Pharmacy.

Believing that an early start is a good one, the girls held a picnic at South Park
earlyiin the fall, and from that time ‘there has been a constant round of luncheons,
parties and other social affairs. The “pharmacy mix" was held at the William Penn
Hotel; the rush luncheon at Gammons. Formal initiation for new members took
place in February.

Each year, founder’s day is commemorated on October 14, when the members
uSC:thC day to remember and honor the founders of their national organization.

Athletics play a large part in the lives of the pharmacy girls. They hold monthly
bowling parties during the year, and a skating party in January.

Although they are still talking about their 1938 convention at Boston, the Lambda
Kappa Sigs are eagerly waiting for 1940, and a trip to Detroit.

Successfully keeping alive the Pitt spirit in the cooperative efforts of the
faculty and students, the Student Faculty Association is the governing force
behind all-University affairs. Since it is impossible to have a good old-fashioned
town meeting to decide questions of importance to all students and faculty,
the governing power is vested in a University Assembly composed of forty
members. Ten Senior men, ﬁve Senior women, ten Junior men, ﬁve junior
women, chosen by popular election, are representatives of the student body.
The Chancellor or his representative, the Dean of Women, the Dean of Men,

and seven other faculty members comprise the faculty group.

Adopting the precedent of action established in previous years, S.F.A.
stepped out in front again this year. Concerning itself with the problems and
necessities of the student body, the various policies and projects adopted by
this assembly, were carried out by numerous committees. Outstanding this
year has been the work of two committees. The Movie Project Committee,
headed by Cy Bielek, attempted something new and made a ﬁne success of it.
Free to the students, they offered such motion pictures as The Crumdex and My
Mam Godfrey. A second new committee was the one in charge of the Cwens—SFA
Student Directory. Through the work of this committee, the students on
campus were offered for the first time a complete student directory at a nominal
cost. Thanks goes to the Social Committee for those afternoon tea dances with
recordings of hot swing bands. This committee also approved all petitions for
social affairs. The chairmanship of the sophisticated Junior Prom or gala
Spring Festival may have been yours if you had proved that you know you
“Susie-Qs” before Jack Daugherty and his Appointments Committee and still
came through the cross-examination of the Executive Committee. Many dis-
tinguished speakers have been brought before the student body through the
efforts of the Forum Committee, while the Safety Committee has provided
parking space for your car. Then, too, there was Scholars’ Day in the Spring,
when deserving students received scholarships and were tapped to honorary
scholastic fraternities. Included also in the work of S.F.A. was the Demon-

stration Block Pep Rallies, and the Annual Spring Festival Week.

In efficiently administering men's customs, granting student loans, conduct-
ing men's Transfer smokers, and supervising general campus activities, Men's

Council has successfully passed through the fourth year of a busy, interesting,
and helpful life.

Most recent in the extensive list of the Council's wide scope of supervision
was the newly installed book exchange, instituted last year as a convenient
facility for the proﬁtable exchange of textbooks. Fifteen per cent of the funds
collected from the sale of books was contributed to the student loan fund, a
project established by the Council for ﬁnancial aid to needy students. The suc-
cess of the experiment has been assured and the idea has rendered aid as a much-
needed student convenience.

Freshmen orientation courses would be impossible without the ten weeks
custom program conducted under Councilmanic tutelage. Each semester thir-
teen councilmen, assisted by campus leaders, introduce freshmen and transfer
students to university life. At the end of the training period, Council awards
keys to Outstanding freshmen in a traditional ceremony conducted by the
Senior Tribunal.

To foster companionship and to orient students who have transferred to the
University from other schools, Men's Council sponsored Transfer smokers dur-
ing the year. Last semester Council especially held many dinner meetings and
Transfer smokers in conjunction with smokers for campus and activity leaders,
thus bringing the Transfers into a closer relationship and fraternal conduct
that would otherwise be lacking.

Men's Council, in addition, has undertaken in the past year a series of new
projects which have added to student comfort and convenience. An activities
information bureau and clearing house for commuters was established through
Dr. Fitzgerald's office. Blueprints for converting the eighth ﬂoor into a Men's
ﬂoor were drawn up and presented to the Administration. Beginning with the
Junior Prom, the Council's tuxedo exchange functioned to enable students to
rent tuxedos at reasonable costs for many formal affairs.

Newly organized, Council‘s Hobby Group has enabled enthusiasts to ex—
change ideas and organize hobby programs. Additional activity in this ﬁeld
resulted in the introduction of courses in “Business Etiquette," in which correct
office procedure and business manners were presented, and a course in “General
Etiquette," to which freshmen were eligible, was instituted. In April and May
seniors were privileged to enter into interviews with prominent business and
civic leaders, to facilitate additional advice and knowledge in job technique.

Broad in scope, interesting in detail, beneﬁcial throughout all of its endeavors
and programs, Men's Council in four years has become indispensable in Univer-
sity student life.

HENRY JOHN HEINZ

STONE’S throw from the urban drabness
of Fifth Avenue and Forbes Street on the
complacent greenness of the Cathedral

lawn rests Pitt's diminutive Heinz Chapel. As
the massive red oak doors of the Chapel en-
trance close behind the visitor, he escapes from
a world of busy noises and changing climates
into the almost ethereal Gothic atmosphere of
medieval France—an atmosphere of time-
reversing calm, of lofty idealistic inspiration,
of soaring serenity.

The Heinz Chapel, dedicated Sunday, Novem-
ber 20, is a gift to the University from Henry
John Heinz and his children. Originally Henry
john Heinz willed a bequest to the University
to erect a building in honor of his mother, Anna
Margaretta Heinz. However, before this plan
wascarried through, his children, Howard
Heinz, Irene E. Given, and Clifford S. Heinz,
decided to add to the bequest and to build this
chapel in memory of both their father and their
grandmother.

The Heinz Memorial Chapel now stands com-
pleted—a permanent symbol of spiritual
growth.

No longer is the building merely a novelty
or an item in the sight-seers guide book; it has

THE HEINZ CHAPEL

become a real chapel on the University campus.
It goes hand in hand with all education on that
campus, being a vital part of that education.
The student and the teacher retire there after
classes to ﬁnd rest, to absorb the beauty of the
surroundings inspired by soft organ music.

In the hustle and bustle of a big urban uni-
versity we are apt to overlook the meaning of
such things as kindness, faith, spirituality, and
response to beauty. The text of the Benedicite
window

‘'0 all}: work: of the Lord, Bleu ye the Lord,
Praise Him, and Magnify Him Forever"

makes us understand the purpose of the chapel
—-a realization of these non-material values.

The medieval French Gothic architecture of
the tiny chapel lends itself toward the lifting
of the skill, the intellect, the imagination, and
the aspirations of man to a unity of purpose
and effect. High pitched vaults, pointed arches,
attenuated stone buttresses suggest verticality.
Traceried lancets extending above the spring of
the vaults give illusion of great height. The
ﬂeche, the spire pointing upward into space,
dramatizing the crossing of nave and transept
within and without the Chapel makes the

whole building appear light, dynamic, soaring. .

At every point a close architectural relationship
emphasizes a unity, complex yet simple.

In the renowned windows of Heinz Chapel
lie its glory and splendor. Through their trans-
lucent glass the sun pours, emerging within a
misty spray of colored light. The symphony
of li ht produced by stained glass of the great
win ows stirs the worshipers to planes of deep
emotion and intense feeling that even the lyric
pens of Shelley and Keats could not justly
express.

All this is Heinz Chapel—an architectural
triumph dedicated to a life of good will, of tol-
erance, of spiritual growth, and of education.

Ample proof of its aim to enrich women student's life at the University is the
Women's Self Government Association’s varied program of events.

Greeting bewildered freshmen women at the green armband assembly the Customs
committee took the coeds in hand until they were well established and deserving of
merit anthers some ten weeks later. For the Lantern night ceremony the weather
blake , but WSGA conquered and proceeded despite the rain, although without the
impressive march of lanterns across the hill. The Women’s Hall of Fame, featuring
prominent Pitt women alumni, was this year originated by the busy tradition com-
mittee as a special feature of the annual Women's Day, for which occasion Mrs.
Chase G. Woodhouse was the guest speaker.

The Presentation Party was another tradition sponsored by the Social committee
of WSGA. This year held in Stephen Foster Memorial seven seniors were presented
as nominees for Senior Queen. The coronation ceremony sponsored by the traditions
committee was held this year for the first time in beautiful Heinz Chapel. The
coronation, always impressive, rose to unparalleled beauty in this chapel of magniﬁ-
cent dignity. ~ '

To Senior Court, judiciary body of WSGA, goes the honor of promoting the most
unusual and vital innovation of the year—weekly student meetings with Chancellor
Bowman. This weekly fellowship between the Chancellor and the Students, soon
nicknamed “fireside chats” is a great step toward greater student-faculty under-
standing.

To establish a greater unity of spirit and action in the College, to advance social
interests, to promote the welfare of the student body, and to establish closer relation-
ships between the faculty and student were the aims of the College Association for
the past year.

Several of these aims were realized indirectly through the series of dances which
the Association sponsored throughout the football season. Not only did the dances
afford pleasure for University students, but their proceeds swelled the loan fund
maintained for the beneﬁt of needy College students. The traditional and informal
Kick-off Dance, first affair on the University's social calendar, was held on the eve
of the Temple game. The Thanksgiving formalwas held on campus for the first
time at the Twentieth Century Club and featured several novel dances. Tea dances
and a winter informal, which was held during men's rushing week so that fraters
and rushees might have a miniature “Inter-Fraternity Ball," completed the College
Association's social schedule.

Social functions, however were not the only means of carrying out the Associa-
tion's aims. It has been the custom of the College Association to sponsor a yearly
assembly and present a prominent speaker to the students. This year the assembly
was held in the Heinz Chapel during the Campus Conference on Religion and Life.
Dr. Harry N. Holmes, ﬁeld secretary of the World Alliance for International Friend-
ship, was the guest speaker. Association members ushered.

The Young Women's Christian Association of the University tries in a practical
way to fulﬁll the spiritual needs of the students and to strengthen the bonds of good
fellowship. Up in room 1232, the new Y.W. of-lice, members can be found at almost
any time planning with Miss Betty Farrow, their new and popular executive secre-
tary, programs to ﬁll these needs. The oﬂicers, cabinet, committees and sub-commit-
tees are always striving to present their programs in new and interesting ways.
Opening the year's work at Stephen Foster Memorial with a Caritas, Y.W. introduced
Freshmen women to great women of history. Living portraits of Queen Esther,
Jean d’Arc, Catherine the Great, Maud Moyer and other famous women were shown
by members. Special music and reading helped make the program impressive as
Freshman were oriented to the religious side of a coed's life. To further this idea of
religion in college life, special Worship services were held in the new Heinz Chapel.
The quiet surroundings of the dim Chapel provided an excellent background for the
inspirational Thanksgiving and Christmas services.

The Y.W. offered other programs to strengthen the feeling of fellowship at Pitt.
This was accomplished through the informal Fall Friendship Fry, dinners, commis-
sion meetings, and the annual outings. Religious Emphasis Week, the week of Feb-
ruary thirteenth, brought new and interesting personalities to the campus. Public
affairs, marriage, everyday religion, and international problems were a few of the
many vital subjects discussed by these authorities. Special services for religious or-
ganizations and campus associations were held daily. The Y.W.C.A. took an active
part in arranging the meetings for women during this Week. Spring brought the
election of new oﬂ-icers and the preparation for summer conferences to ﬁnd new ideas
and thoughts for the coming year.

To help students experience the friendship of men and women who are seeking
worthwhile goals and to show them how they can live the best college life, are the
chief aims of the University Young Men's Christian Association. So that these aims
might be achieved, the Association devoted a prominent place in its program to the
discovery of the values which tend to make college experience more signiﬁcant.

In order that informal contacts between members could be made, the YMCA was
divided into clubs. Two freshman clubs holding weekly luncheon meetings provided
an opportunity for freshmen to meet and talk with students and faculty members
informally. The Association also created a five—point plan to provide a basis for stu-
dent participation in many ﬁelds. One of its most active phases centered about the
principles of Christian living. Pitkin Club, Religious Laboratory, and intercollegiate
conferences and retreats promoted the clearer understanding of these principles, and
the Association played a vital part in the Campus Conference on Religion and Life.

During the past year the Inquiry Forum met to permit open discussion between
students and prominent adult leaders. So that they could visualize some of the
theories set forth, students made several trips to points of interest in Western Penn-
sylvania. Such was the visit to the Westmoreland and Penn-Craft housing projects.

In addition to its religious and educational activities the association held several
social functions. Following Freshman Week, the Freshman Camp Conference was
held at camp Kon—O-Kwee. Throughout the year members attended Association
Night social programs once a month where joint meetings were held with YWCA
members.

Under faculty direction the Women’s Debating Association has taken upon itself
the training of members in self-expression and the clariﬁcation of ideas on pertinent
issues through stimulating discussion. Toward these ends, the ﬁfty active members
discussed and debated such subjects as: the religion of the world, the place of married
women in industry, a proposed alliance with Great Britain, and a policy of isolation
for the United States. At the same time, the association has worked to orient its
members to the general campus program and to bring ex ression of what the Uni-
versity is to the community and to other campuses. In ad ition the women debaters
were inﬂuential in bringing to Pitt several successful coeducational debates in con-
junction with the men's debating team.

An expanded extension program included thirty debates and panel discussions
before civic, professional, business, and political organizations. Eight intercollegiate
debates which took place on campus this year were sponsored with Wooster College,
Penn State, George Washington University, Michigan State, University of Maine,
Gettysburg College, Seton Hill College, and Mount Mercy College. Short trips to
Penn State and through Ohio and an extended trip including Cornell University,
University of Buffalo, New York University, University of Pennsylvania, Trinity
College, and George Washington University rounded out the intercollegiate debating.
Social affairs, a dinner meeting once a month, the party for transfer students, Beaux
Arts, and the annual banquet with the Men's association, added a lighter informal
note. Another important activity was the sponsorship of the freshman Public Speak-
ing unit. A new education program consisted of weekly debate conference meetings
and lectures on debate technique with Miss Charlotte McMurray, the association's
new coach. The tapping of several members to Delta Sigma Rho, honorary debating
society, recognized the outstanding work of these girls in this large, active and
growing organization.

With a new manager, a new coach, new points for debate, and a new itinerary,
the Men's Debating Association embarked on another successful season. Aiming to
give as many students as possible an opportunity to study and practice public speak-
ing, to join in a public forum program that honest1'_v discusses current affairs before
student and adult groups, to represent the University with intelligent and sincere
speakers in debate meetings with other colleges and universities, the Men's Debating
Association has ﬁlled a vital spot in student life at Pitt.

Unique in this year’s organization was a new forum agenda combining the SFA
forum with a lecture, book review, and forensic program. This was inaugurated
under Pitt’s new coach and director of debating, Roy H. Umble, who came here from
South Bend, Indiana, where he was director of debating in public schools. Discuss-
ing the federal incorporation of labor unions, pum priming, and a proposed Anglo-
American alliance, members of the varsity and reshmen debate teams continued
last year’s work in a trying schedule of competition against the well known teams
from Kent, Westminster, Winthrop, Colgate, Cornell, St. Peters, Australia, Boston
College, and the Universities of Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.

In an effort to stimulate interest in debating among high schools, varsity debaters
gave an extension program of demonstration debates before tri-state high schools
including Westminster college demonstrations in the Stephen Foster Memorial and
the second annual n0n—decision high school debate conference with freshmen debaters.

Highlighting the season, briefs of Pitt debates were published in the annual
volume of College Debate, the nationally circulated college debate handbook. The
ever—formal, ever—precocious, ever-imposing University debating association let down
its hair and resorted to informality and frivolity at the annual Maytime banquet and
awarded prizes for outstanding work—the ultimate conclusion to another of many
successful and interesting seasons.

“Come one, come all to our swimming parties, tennis meets, archery con-
tests, bowling parties," invites the Women's Athletic Association commonly
heard around campus as W.A.A. Being a member of the Athletic Federation of
College Women, W.A.A. tries to create a zestful spirit of play among all the
women of the University of Pittsburgh through their recreational sports. This
year, W.A.A. began their activities with a membership drive in charge of Betty
Crowe, Ed. 40, treasurer. As the membership cards began to file in, schedules
of events began to ﬁle out. The archery range was set upon the campus for the
participation of all girls but later, because of the weather, was moved to the
new range inside the Cathedral. The swimming pool was opened on Wednesday
and Friday afternoons; the new recreation room for ping pong, darts, and danc-

ing was put into operation; the outing committee began with their ﬁrst outing
at Camp Pitt; and the first W.A.A. Neu/.r was edited by Grace Richards.

In place of the traditional Coed Prom that W.A.A. has sponsored for the
freshmen women, the Bal Mystique was held this year. At this event, Patricia
Elmer, considered the outstanding woman in the junior class, was presented

as the Veiled Lady. Another feature of the evening was the demonstration of
the Lambeth Walk, the new dance sensation, by Karl Heinrich, ballet master

of the Pittsburgh Civic Ballet. He also led the Champagne Waltz, assisted by a
group of senior women. In both of these dances, Roberta Webb, president of
W.A.A., was Mr. Heinrich's partner.

As Christmas rolled in, W.A.A.’s traditional Yuletide Feast was celebrated
at the Heinz House in the Old English manner with candle light, pork, baked
beans, and the customary bringing in of the yulelog. The feast could not be
complete without the two jesters annoying everyone at meal time by stealing
their candles, which furnished them their only means of light by which to eat.
The boats head was brought forth in the customary style followed by a pro-
cession of young ladies carrying trays of food.

Gym sports were not enough for these active girls. They packed their trunks
and took several week-end outing trips to Camp Pitt. Hiking, sledding, snow-
balling, tobogganing, and singing comprised some of their activities during the
day. After they cooked their meals, they built a ﬁre in the open grate around
which they sang songs and played games until it was time to call it a day.

Health and recreation week was combined with the opening of the new
gymnasium this year. The idea was to stress healthful recreational sports.
Emphasis was placed upon three days of sports and movies all concerning a
healthful way of living. During open house, posters were placed around the
gym and recreational sports were played there in the afternoon.

W.A.A. closed its activities with Spring Festival Week, concluding one of

the finest years in its University career.

A crisp fall day, with the sky threatening snow, a capacity crowd, nerves on edge,
anxious eyes scanning the time-clock, a top-notch band, hysterically playing, “Hail,
Hail, the gangs all here—," the best team in the country easily converting the point
after touchdown—but still the picture isn’t complete. There is something lacking,
and three seasons ago, in 1936, S.F.A. realized that this something was an organized
cheering section, a demonstration block. So section seventeen of the stadium was set
aside to be used exclusively by some 900 students wearing the blue and gold capes of
the ﬁrst organized cheering block at the university. ‘

Responsible for the activities of the block this season were Edwin Ellis, chair-
man, and Patsy Griffiths, assistant chairman. Their capable committee was made up
of the leaders of the small sections into which the block was divided. It was this
committee that took the responsibility for placing the 3,000 thumb-tacks which form
a pattern for the crouching panther, the Cathedral, the P—I-double T which sprang
into being, one after the other. Credit is due Mr. Short of the Civil Engineering
Department for drawing these designs, and to Mr. Biddle, faculty advisor.

The season started off with a brown jug for West Virginia. Then came a top hat
and cane for Duquesne. For Southern Methodist there was the wild mustang and lone
star. At this same game the band swung A Tirket A Taxket while the Block produced
the basket. The highlight of the season however, was the scoreboard at the Fordham
game, with the now broken 0-0 tie. The Tech game brought a Scotty and lost the
goal posts. At the Penn State game it rained, and the students in the cheering block
in their blue and gold canvas were the envy of the drippin fans and students who
hadn't been energetic enough to si u up. On this last Satur ay the capes were tossed
over to the section leaders, counte , stuffed into canvas bags, carried down the stands
and handed over to Bud Ellis and Patsy Griffith for the last time. The stadium has
ceased to reverberate with student cheers for this season, but thousands of football
fans have not ceased to praise the work of the demonstration block.

Announcement for 1939. Below this engraved picture on the cover is embossed,
in raised gothic type, the legend: Unit'erJif_y of Pittrburgb 1939. As a binding
contrast the simplicity of an embossed seal of the University appears on the back
cover. The cover is either of white roan leather or white cardboard with a

blue tassel cord holding together the cardboard booklet, and the leather booklet.

The announcement this year centers about the newly dedicated Heinz Me-
morial Chapel, which is pictured on the opening page of the book. Several
pictures of the Commons Room, the University’s Allegheny Observatory, the
Stephen Collins [Foster Memorial, the Mellon Institute, and other familiar
campus buildings and scenes are scattered attractively throughout the sixty-

two page booklet.

The announcement lists all the Senior Week events, the Senior Committees,
the Oﬂicers of Administration, and the candidates for graduation in all the
schools. Effort has been made by the committee, under chairman Leonard
Sedney, to produce an attractive Senior Announcement that will be truly worthy

of the "University of Pittsburgh 1939.”

A Constant criticism of any industrial school is that the student, sequestered with
his abstract theories and his slide—rule, loses sight of the practical nature of his work.
The Oil and Gas Department has developed a method of bringing the theoretical and
the practical world together and integrating them. They accomplish this by means
of the Oil and Gas Association, an organization meeting weekly, and composed of
both students and faculty members. Aﬂiliated with The American Institute of Min-
ing Engineers, it brings together the student, teacher, industrial worker and indus-
trial magnate on common educational ground.

The Thursday morning meetings bring opportunity for discussion of the new de-
velopments, current phases, and problems of oil work. This past year brought guest
speakers on aerial photography as an aid to oil prospecting; on the production of
seamless tubing, the address being illustrated with motion pictures; petroleum geology
in Colombia and Venezuela; the historical development of oil—well drilling, and safety
in the ﬁeld.

As a special event, members of the Association visited a tube-making plant in
McKeesport for the purpose of witnessing operations. Outstanding achievement of
the year was a revision. of the present school curriculum, on suggestion of the Asso-
ciation, which made it possible for students to get practical experience in the oil
ﬁelds while attending school.

In addition to the Work done by the Association in bringing men in to give part
of their information to the students, the organization has provided a closer Contact
between the students of the school, and at the same time has given them the chance
to become acquainted with leaders in the oil industry, an acquaintance which may be
of value in the future.

Drawing its membership from the ﬁrst—ranking members of the Reserve Oﬂicers

Training Corp, Pitt Riﬂes, honorary military fraternity, is unexcelled in military
drill proﬁciency. Because requirements for initiation are so stringent, calling for
scholarship, good attendance, and excellence at military maneuvers, the sixty-ﬁve
members in the three platoons of Pitt Riﬂes serve as the pride of the Corps.

Initiation to the organization is, in character, akin to that of West Point. Tappees
must do guard duty, memorize long descriptive speeches, ignore co-eds, and be at the
instant command of their superiors. Once initiated, members meet twice weekly for
one-hour periods of drill, twice monthly for discussions apropos to their purpose.
From the Riﬂemen this year ten men were selected to form a "crack manual squad."
When the whole fraternity paraded and exhibited for seventy-ﬁve thousand spectators
at the Stadium during the Fordham game, these ten performed the fancy manual.
They repeated it for Army and Navy Day celebrations, and at Logan Armory.

Social events this year included several smokers, a Military Formal at the Twen-
tieth Century Club in December, and the Spring Banquet, at which new members
were tapped.

Riﬂemen have served the school this year in the capacity of ushers for the various
affairs held at Stephen Foster Memorial and at the Freshmen Reception. Here, too,
they have evoked praise for their precision and regard for duty.

Comparable to the Student-Faculty Association of undergraduate day school, the
Evening Students Association, in which all students who register in the Evening
Division automatically become members, not only governs, but also advances the
social interests and promotes the general welfare of the student body. Although
Evening classes have been in existence at the University since 1908, not until the
school term of 1919-1920 did the University set aside a fund for the maintenance of a
student self-governing unit, a fund to which the University has made an annual grant
ever since.

Lest old acquaintances be forgot and new ones not made, the Association, nick-
named ESA, started the school year off with a number of "open-house" nights held
in the Commons Room. The last echoes of the carolers singing “Silent night, Holy
night . .  had notgyet faded away, before all of the students were shagging be-
tween falling snowﬂakes, taming the wild March lion into a gentle lamb, and cele-
brating the wearing of the shamrock at bridges and dances. Come spring, the stu-
dents exercised their rights at the annual election. The retiring president prexied
the Nominating Committee which further included the Director of the Evening
Classes, and two graduating students who had been active participants in the programs
and social events sponsored by ESA. In order to qualify for nomination, a nominee
must have been enrolled for two consecutive years prior to his nomination, and must
have maintained an academic average of “C" as well as having earned a minimum
credit requirement.

But all the anxiety of elections was dispersed by the downbeat of a swing master's
baton at the Spring Prom as ﬂuffy pastel skirts and trim, stiff-fronted “tuxes" whirled
past the bandstand. Then, before the word "Finis” was scrawled across a varied and
active calendar, one ﬁnal informal party, held in early June, confirmed the lasting
loyalties and life-long friendships that had been made among the students of ESA.

fraternity and cooperation among women preparing for such careers," 24 collegiate
chapters and 14 alumnae chapters are active in outstanding universities.

This year the business meetings were called on the second Thursday of every
month in the Nationality Rooms of the Cathedral of Learning. Talks given by women
who have established themselves in business or the professions highlighted the vari-
ous teas and forums held by the fraternity. Among these speakers were Mrs. George
Wallace, Executive Secretary of the League of Voters, who pointed out to these
aspiring business women the importance of a knowledge of public affairs in relation
to business, and Miss Ruth Forsht, attorney—at—law, who led a forum on the women's
place in business and the professions. One of the most interesting of the educational
tours planned for the year was a visit of the KDKA broadcasting studios. Annually,
the fraternity awards a key to the “Biz Ad” woman who ranks highest in both schol-
arship and extra-curricular activities.

December 17, the date of Phi Chi Theta's annual Christmas Party, scored as the
red letter day on their social calendar. Following this, in early March, the frater-
nity celebrated Founders Day with traditional ceremony at the College Club. Soon
after, not only those women students enrolled in the Evening Division, but also those
registered in the School of Business Administration were invited to dance and play
party games with actives at an informal get-together. The Spring pledges first met
all of the fraternity lassies across a gay luncheon table; then once more tea cups
tinkled and tapering candles ﬂickered as the new and old members poured tea in honor
of their mothers.

SPRING FESTIVAL

New as the Jeffersonian nickel and different as the new
spring shades in milady's spring outﬁt, Spring Festival
Week inaugurated an unprecedented welcome of spring
to the University campus. Having extended the celebra-
tion from the customary three days to a whole week not
only allowed for more events of merry-making, but also
for a greater variety. Following the traditional opening
of Spring Festival Week by the formal dedication of the
ODK Senior Walk at noon on Monday, May 8, the first
innovation appeared in the form of the Women's Archery
Contest. For the first time, by participating in a Women's
Sports Program that culminated on Friday afternoon, the
women, too, had an active part in this week of festivity.
Before a crowd of cheering and jeering sports fans the
Intramural Sports Jamboree and intercollegiate baseball

with a game slated against West Virginia were introduced

WEEK

to campus activities. On Tuesday evening, Pitt Players
triumphed their season of fine productions by staging the
ﬁrst world premiere of the startlingidiiferent play “Our
Town" as an amateur production. Dances, of course,
were quite in order. “Joe College" in his green striped
trousers, brown jacket, and cream-colored “barges"
escorted “]osephine" in her rose colored skirt with a
“dinky" to match and a purple plaid jacket to the ﬁrst—
an informal collegiate tea-dance at the Schenley. Prizes
were awarded for the best combinations of dress that
typiﬁed the Pitt girl and fellow.

Thursday, following the afternoon battle of the fra-
ternal brothers for supremacy in track feats, came Car-
nival Night, the height of fun and frivolity. Even this
every—year—event was distinct in character. In order to

accommodate more students, the Carnival was held on

SPRING FESTIVAL WEEK

Trees Field, a setting that gave reality to the affair.
Falling in the groove of the "fair” complex that has
swept our country in recent years, the Carnival resembled
a miniature International Fair. Centered around an In-
ternational Walk six nationality villages created an at-
mosphere of gaiety conducive to gambling, dancing, and
fun. I

Returning to ceremonial initiations, all deserving men
and women were honored by honorary social fraternities
at the Tap Assembly on Friday morning which was held,
contrary to precedent, on our indoor campus—the Com-
mons Room. Later in the day, cameras clicked all along
Bayard Street to catch a lasting remembrance of the
ROTC parade, and the followi-ng Floatpparade sponsored
by the Panhellenic Association which gave a colorful
and original panorama of scenes to the onlookers. This
year the silver loving cup was awarded to the ﬂoat that

best represented a Chosen song title. Then came the hi-

larious Interfraternity Sweepstakes. Relying on two-
cylinder man power the framed wheels of the “model
racing car” was pushed up and down the race track.
Topping off the eventful day the coed and eds attended

the informal “Campus Circus," a dance held at the

‘_ Schenley Ballroom.

The gay week was formally concluded with the Senior
Ball. Wishing to keep the Ball a Pitt affair on our own
Campus and in a comparatively private spot, the Ball in-
augurated a new dance ﬂoor at the Syria Mosque.
Even as the whole gala celebration of Spring was new,
so were the tickets. Instead of individual tickets
formerly used, books of tickets for the whole week were
sold. Accordingly, more students attended more events
and enjoyed one of the most successful and unique
Spring Festival sheld at the University, a gala week of
celebration that psychologically prepared them for the

exms that followed.

Back in 801 Cathedral between the Pzmtlaer and Y.M.
C.A. offices is the hatching—place of the 1939 OWL. To
this little ofﬁce overlooking the Heinz Chapel and
Schenley Park come daily the staff members to lounge
and loaf, to worry and work. Despite a late start and
later deadlines, they have made an effort to uphold all
that the OwL has always meant to Pitt and to portray
the real essence of life at Pitt. It is amazing, though,
with the crowded conditions, hustle and bustle, clash of
typewriters, and incessant jangle of telephones, that any
work at all has been accomplished.

In the past nine months the staff has waded through
tons of copy, engraver's proofs, contracts, photos, paste,
and printers copy to accurately bring to the students
those events that have marked four years at Pitt and
particularly those that have made the season of 1938-39

 

194

THE 1939 OWL

so vital. Only through complete comradeship and close
harmony has the staff been able to honestly attain what
they have set out to do.

To give justice to the beauty and quality of the
Nationality Rooms and to their signiﬁcance in cultural
education presented many difficulties. Nationality seals,
committee pictures, information, and art work, which
would honestly exemplify the purpose of the Nationality
Rooms, had to be obtained. After numerous disappoint-
ments the staff at last feels that they have coordinated
the spirit of the Nationality Rooms with the spirit of
Pitt to the best of their ability.

In the years to come when the staff members get out
their OwLs, they will not only drift back in memory to
their student days at Pitt but will also recall the happy
experiences in 801 Cathedral.

THOMAS L. SMITH
Editor

The school year of 1938-39 marked the twenty-ﬁfth
anniversary of the Pitt Panther. With the turn of a quarter
century of Panther progress, the magazine achieved the
ﬁnal step in its metamorphosis from a straight humor
publication to a self-styled “campus magazine." In its
new character it seeks lighter brand of humor for its
stories, satires and fantasies. This past year it has in-
cluded_informational, semi-serious articles on such sundry

THE PANTHER

subjects as why there are coed captains in the ROTC,
what to do when you forget your wallet on a date, the
pros and cons of sending corsages for school dances and
the historical importance of mustaches and beards.

After twenty-ﬁve years of joke-making and story-tell-
ing the Panther has emerged from chrysalis a genuine,
oﬂicial “campus magazine,” with a change of content
and a de-emphasis of forced humor. As a campus maga-
zine, the Pitt Panther strikes for pleasant grins rather than
hilarity.

Photographically, the Panther scooped other publica-
tions with a series of action photographs taken during
the student strike in the early part of the second semester,
which tended to show the true pallor of the half-hearted
protest. As publicity stunts, the Panther imported two
lion cubs from the Zoo, passed them off as baby panthers,
and made the ﬁrst—ﬂoor corridor a miniature zoo. To
publicize the November issue, which included a story of
a synthetic fire in the Cathedral, a fire truck clanged and
roared around the Cathedral block for one entire Friday
morning.

JOHN MARTINC()

Always new and different, the Pitt Neu/gr, official stu-
dent tri-weekly newspaper, again entered a year of stu-
dent work and special projects that would do credit to
any larger and better equipped staff. This year, its ﬁrst
under faculty supervision, the New; was late in organiz-
ing its staff since Mr. Machesney, the publications
advisor, could not arrive at the University until after the
school term had begun.

 

THE PITT NEWS

Despite a late start the members entered upon projects
other than those immediately concerned with the pub-
lishing of a student paper three times a week. During the
year they were responsible for the organization of a
committee which concerned itself with the raising of
funds to provide for the education of several refugee
students at the University. To this was added the work
of the business staff as they continue to sponsor the two
annual style shows, fall and spring.

Not enough can be said for the ﬁne spirit and fairness
that the publication has maintained throughout this past
year as they worked under the adverse conditions that
have beset the University. Always on the ‘‘spot,’'
always looked to for “oﬂicial" student reaction to situa-
tions that were constantly arising, a reaction that was
practically impossible to ascertain, Editor_]ohn Martinco
and his associates worked with a fairness and understand-
ing that calls forth nothing but praise from all who have
observed their work.

The unsung heroes of the dramatic productions at Pitt are the Pitt Players Tech-
nical Staff. This group, consisting of about twenty members, is the nucleus which
builds the sets and stages the four annual Players’ presentations.

Under the direction of James Lindsey, technical director, and Jack McKee, his
assistant, who, with the director of the show, do the designing, the Technical Staff
builds, paints, and lights the sets.

Besides providing the “heavy” work for Pitt Players, the group meets once a
week for an illustrated lecture on some phase of stagecraft. In these lectures, Mr‘
Lindsey explains various time—saving devices used on stages, and other means of
creating effects with a minimum of effort. From the lecture on technique prior to
the showing of Kind Lady, the staff developed the weird blue lighting used in this
show.

The tremenduous success of Bratlaer Rat, both at Pitt and, even more, on the road-
trip, was due to the splendid activity of the Technical Staff in designing and building
three serviceable sets.

The Technical Staff often works on shows other than the Players’ dramatic pro-
ductions. It provides the decorations at many University dances and affairs, and
forms the basis of the Foster stage staff. The members of the staff also spend much of
their time doing other stage work: several are actors, and many work with marion-

CIECS.

Lollypops and blotters for the Kind Lady. A cannon bombarding the Cathedral
and two fplebes marking time for Brarlaer Rat. Publicity? Yes! And Pitt Players had
plenty o it this year, for in being one of the most active organizations on campus
they delight in letting others know about it. This drama club is divided into three
all—important staffs: acting, technical, and business. To become a member of one of
these staffs a tyro must appear before director Buell Whitehill and prove his worth.

Try—outs for all players are held for each play.

The long hours spent in swabbing paint, ﬁtting silky gowns, covering bulletin
boards with gaily colored posters, plus the long hours that dwindled into the wee
hours of the morning during rehearsals were not in vain; for each member who earned
eight service points was honored with a gold key. Nor did the Players, in working
forget time for play. After every production they celebrated with a party; danced
at the University Club one afternoon in early December; and shivered through a
combination sandwich—weiner roast and bean feed after seeing the football team off
to Nebraska.

This year, Theatron, an honorary Pitt Player's organization was innovated on
campus. Once members of Theta Alpha Phi, a national honorary dramatic fraternity,
BetaChapter changed to a local organization so that they could sponsor more activi-
ties. They chose the name Theatron from the Greek word for theater. The members
of Theatron have two aims that they are working to fulﬁll; namely to make dramatics
an important and vital part of campus life, and to build a room for Pitt Players
properties. To be tapped for membership into Theatron in the fall or spring, players
must have been active in Pitt Players for at least three semesters as a member of either
the acting, technical, or business staffs. Theatron met regularly every two weeks at
luncheon meetings usually held at the Ruskin Apartments, and planned and dis-
cussed the dramatics problems of the world and the next Pitt play.

HOLIDAY

Phillip Barry's sparkling comedy Holiday was given as the first Pitt
Players production of the year with Eleanor Haught and August Hofrnann
portraying the leading roles as Linda Seton and johnny Case.

Presenting a chapter from the life of the wealthy Seton family, Holiday
revealed the opposing attitudes toward the superﬁcial conventions of a
society which attracted Julia and her father, but which bored Linda. Julia's
ﬁance, Johnny Case, and Nick and Susan Potter also disapprove of the Seton's
characteristic and artiﬁcial dignity, and to escape it all, johnny sails for
Europe leavingjulia behind. The climax is reached when he discovers that
it is Linda whom he loves, and the play ends when he ﬁnds her waiting for
him in the stateroom. It was her Holiday too.

The efforts of the technical staﬁ’ and James Lindsay, designerof the sets,
aided immeasureably the successful production of the play. One of the stage
properties of particular interest was the music box, valued at ﬁve hundred
dollars, which was loaned to the Players by Daniel Buechler.

KIND LADY

Following the successful reception of their first play, Pitt Players produced
Kind Lady, a horror-comedy similar to N i ght Mart Fall. The many character
roles and dramatic intensity of this play made it a diﬂicult one to perform,
but the cast proved more than equal to the characterizations, portraying
them exceptionally well from the principal to the minor roles.

“Unusual" describes the plot for Kind Lady, which centers about Henry
Abbott, an insane though cultured crook, and kindly Mary Herries, Wealthy
Englishwoman who offers her home as a refuge for the demented man.
Completely unscrupulous, Abbott plays on Miss Herrie’s sympathetic nature
to his own advantage. Complications are so numerous that Mary believes
herself insane, and later she is forced to try and prove to Gustave Rosenberg
that she has possession of her normal faculties. “Unusual" also described
the casting of this climaxing scene in which Miriam Harter played opposite
her brother, Earl.

BROTHER RAT

From good, to better, to best was the united conviction of the Pitt
Players subscribers, while those who were attending their first Players per-
formance voiced even more enthusiastic praise when they saw what was
scheduled to be the last production of the season—-Brotlaer Rat. Capacity
crowds in Foster Memorial at every performance, all-time attendance records
shattered, and the first road tour in several years for a Players’ show; Monks’
and Finkelhoff's drama of life at the West Point of the South, Virginia
Military Institute, was a decided "hit."

Bing Edward’s secret marriage to Kate Rice, and a later revelation that
he is to become a father formed the plot of the highly entertaining comedy
which deals with the two most vital interests of the “rats,” graduation and
the success of the baseball team. Billy Randolph's escapades, and the efforts
of the cadets to keep Lieutenant “Lace Drawers" from learning of Bing’s
plight provided many laughs, and the affairs between Billy and Joyce Winfree
and Dan and Clair Ramm furnished additional romantic interest.

Another picture of V.M.I., that of the plebe, was exceptionally well
presented by "Mistol" Bottome, while A. Furnam Townsend, Jr., Harley
Harrington, “Tripod” Andrews, and "Newsreel" Scott portrayed the several
types of boys who are found in most stories about military schools, though
seldom so distinctively characterized as in this play.

“AT YOUR SERVICE”
by
CAP AND GOWN

BILL HOEVELER

Based on a plot which allowed easy introduction of
several features, dances, and songs, the 32nd annual Cap
and Gown show, At Your Service, was presented in Harry

Brown's Nixon Theater the week of May 1-8. Written

by G. Norman Reis,‘ '16, the action centered about the
activities of two college boys, Chuck Wynn and Jack
Craig, the wise—cracking proprietors of At Your Service,
who are in business to "give immediate attention at any
and all needs," whether it be diapering babies or escort-
ing errant damsels. All goes well until Wynn and Craig
are hired by Jefferson Nichols, a» wealthy perfumer, to
go to Egypt and discover the secret of a rare and ancient
perfume.

Wandering movie scouts, American educated native
chiefs, a god-like professor of Egyptology, all hinder the
fulﬁllment of the At Your Service contract, until Joe Slick,

the oﬂice boy and a stowaway, comes to the rescue. KARL STARK

This, the text of the center chancel window sets
the tlomimmt theme of the Heinz Chapel. As such
it is also sytnholic of the part played by these 
world-re1mwn windows in making the Heinz
Chapel one of the most beautiful in the country.

For the first time in a decade, a woman led the Cap and
Gown choruses through their paces. She was petite,
blonde Ruth Miller, former director of choruses at the
Stanley and Alvin theaters, and dancer at the Penn and
Enright theaters. Miss Miller was scheduled to direct
the Cap and Gown show in 1935, but another contract
prevented this.

James Lindsay, technical director of Cap and Gown
and Pitt Players for many years, was in charge of the
technical production and design again this year. Scenic
reproductions of Egypt and the Mediterranean Sea, exe-
Cuted by the Cap and Gown art staff under his direction,
served as a colorful background for the show. And for
another season the orchestra and choral group were under
the efficient direction of Gus A. Schnabel, '15, veteran
Cap and Gown conductor.

The big feature of Cap and Gown this year was the
publication of four of the songs used in the show. Threc

of these catchy tunes were played on the radio networks

DOUG SMHH and recorded by two bands before the show was produced.

Director of the production was Martin B. Fallon,
C31, an old Capand Gowner himself, who returned to
direct this year's show. "Red" Fallon has been a mem-
ber of the old equity company at the Pittsburgh Play-
house, has played in summer theater, and since his gradu-
ation has had part in a show with Leslie Howard. At
present he is an assistant in the department of speech at
Duquesne University.

The published songs were jupiter H4: Nine Moom, and
Diary of Dreame, by Ade Robson, a graduate student,
Nothing 2'; Tao Perfect for You, by August Hoffman, '39,
and Believe Me, by Dr. Benjamin Levant, '19.
Interesting specialties included composer Vernon
Krahl, '39, singing his own song, Grandma’: Back Fram
the City, and the can—can dance which Miss Miller ar-

ranged for the “girls."

Several Cap and Gown repeaters were in the show this
year. They included Milton Hoffman, with his third
“heavy" role, the Hoeveler boys, ]ack~—the quick-quip-
witted At Your Servicer—and brother Bill “Legs" again
scoring a hit as “leading lady." William Murtayas the
professor of Egyptology, and J. Karl Stark, as the "bad
boy," Joe Slick again turned in commendable perform-

ZIIICCS.

The Cap and Gown show put on every spring by an
all—man University undergraduate cast, is the annual
climax to a year of activity and preparation by the Gradu-
ate Cap and Gown Club, a group that ﬁnally falls under
the scrutiny of Theodore W. Biddle, assistant dean of

men and graduate manager of Cap and Gown.

Prior to its opening at the Nixon a preview perform-
ance of the production was presented before the Syria
Mosque Shriners. It was followed by six performances
the following week of May 1-8 at the Nixon theater.
Thirty—two years old, Cap and Gown still remains the

high spot of the year at Pitt.

The name of the men's group singing organization, the “Glee Club," could be

taken literally and still would not be misleading for a deﬁnition of the purpose of
the Club. Meeting twice a week, the group strives to give expression to their enjoy-
ment in song. It was first organized as a hobby club in 1890 and is the oldest non-
athletic activity at Pitt.

The Glee Club serves as a training ground for the male vocal enthusiasts. Here,
under the direction of Theodore M. Finney, faculty leader, the voices are trained,
the musical minds taught to read notes, and the resultant singers moulded into a
choral group.

During the year, the Glee Club has made almost ﬁfty public appearances, climaxed
by the Eastern concert tour, the backbone of their season. In Pittsburgh, the Glee
Club presented its annual home concert in Foster Memorial in the early Spring.
These appearances were supplemented by a radio broadcast and high school, church,
and special society recitals.

Many of the Club meetings were joint dances with the Women's Choral. The
big social event of the year was the annual banquet where keys were awarded to de-
serving members.

The scope of the Glee Club’s activities is recognized by the breadth of musical
expression their programs represented. The mood of the selections varied from
Bach's Death, I Do Not Fear Thee, to the Club's favorite, Swing Along, by Cook.

Entering its ﬁftieth year, the Glee Club has proved its value both to a campus
appreciation of good music and to the members‘ enjoyment of their work.

Is there a heart that music cannot melt? If there is, Women's Choral has, thus
far, been unsuccessful in ﬁnding it. Its members have sung their way into the hearts

of church groups and guests at oﬂicial University functions.
The singing you heard every Monday afternoon and Wednesday evening eminat—

ing from the Stephen Foster Memorial or the Cathedral was the Choral rehearsing.
It depended upon the time of the year just what they were practicing for—it may
have been for a Parents’ Council meeting, for the Commons Room teas, or for Beaux
Arts, but, whatever the occasion, the singers did their best in every program.

One of the Choral's feature programs was the singing of Christmas carols in the
Commons Room. Celestial music ﬂoating around was mellowed by the presence of
evergreens and soft candlelight, and the Christmas spirit was re-created by the
Choral. During the spring months Women's Choral was at its busiest. It took part
in Pitt night at the Fulton School, entertained at Stephen Foster Memorial Open
House, and in April gave its annual home concert. It was also honored by being
included in the Music Festival, representing music organizations of Pittsburgh, at
Carnegie Music Hall.

In addition to its musical activities, Women's Choral found time for social pleas-
ure. Dinner meetings at Heinz House with a program and rehearsal following, were
held once a month. Early in April, the mothers of Choral members were entertained
at a tea, and in May the choristers completed their social whirl with a formal ban-
quet at which the members bid farewell to the seniors.

Mrs. Fred Lissfelt, Director of the Choral, is a source of encouragement and in-
spiration to the members. It is she who is fostering an appreciation of good music,
and it is the Choral which is offering an outlet for the musical talent of the women
on campus.

Although it has been said that this is an age of “swing," the University Symphony
Orchestra is proof that there are still many students with a preference for classical
music. Providing an outlet for the talents of its 55 members, the Orchestra, under
the capable baton of Theodore M. Finney, appealed to all who appreciate good
music.

One of the highlights in the Orchestra season was the annual home concert which
was played on April 19. Also this spring, the group made a tour of local high schools,
which from the members’ point of view, climaxed the season's activities. Rehearsals
for these programs were held once each Week at the Orchestra headquarters on the
twenty-third ﬂoor of the Cathedral. Because of the full schedule, frequent rehearsals
were necessary, but until four years ago the Orchestra only held scattered practice

sessions.

But the Orchestra is a social as well as a musical organization. Its social activities
began in the first semester of school with a party at the South Park Community House.
Later, an Armistice Day Dance was held at the Falk Elementary School.

Mildred Gardner, concert—rnaster, and Vernon Krall, who writes music for the
Cap and Gown Shows, are recognized as outstanding members. Stanley Ambrose,
manager of the Orchestra for the past three years, was assisted by Pomeroy Polevoy
and Walter Logan. Most of the Orchestra members are registered in the new sym-
phony course, sponsored by the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra at Carnegie Music
Hall.

First founded as the A Cappella Choir, to serve no purpose other than a self-
suﬂicient musical group, Mr. Finney harnessed the student’s enthusiasm and ability T
to meet a vital University need. Last fall when Heinz Chapel was opened, a matured
and experienced choir sat in the chancel, and, when this choral group was desig'
nated as the official Chapel choir, they accordingly changed their name to the Heinz
Chapel Choir.

The choral's enthusiasm can best be illustrated by observing the attempts of the
members to have a program calling for eleven chapel services a week in comparison
with three programs a week last year. In addition this mixed choral group, the only
mixed singing organization on campus, represented Pitt at numerous formal functions.
Notable in this respect was the appearance the Heinz Chapel Choir made at the Board
of Trustees dinner honoring Board Chairman George Hubbard Clapp.

The Heinz Chapel Choir was recognized nationally when it accepted an invitation
to appear in one of New York's leading churches last Spring. Working with the
vitality of precocious youth, the Heinz Chapel Choir has carved for itself an impor-
tant niche in University religious and church life. I

If the origin of any one particular activity on campus could be attributed solely
to student enthusiasm, that group is the Heinz Chapel Choir. Last year, thirty Pitt
men and women approached Theodore A. Finney with the idea of forming a mixed
choral group merely for recreation. Mr. Finney moulded this choral-minded group
into one which today is just as closely associated with Heinz Chapel as the well
known stained glass windows.

PITT BAND

Twenty-eight years ago, the ﬁrst band ever to repre-
sent the University performed before a football audience
at Forbes Field. Organized largely through the efforts
ofjames S. Oliver and Dr. Earl Miller, the band appeared
with seven instruments borrowed from a Pittsburgh mu-
sic store. The succeeding years since 1911 have been
marked by many accomplishments in maneuvering and
instrumentation. Reorganized following the War, the
Band gained increasing prestige and today it is regarded
by many authorities as one of the outstanding college
bands in the nation.

When the military department assumed supervision of
F116 Band in 1930, the present cadet-style uniforms were
adopted and the Band became the ofﬁcial marching band
for the student corps. Freshmen and sophomores are re-
quired to be enrolled in the ROTC before they are ad-
mitted to the organization. This year's roster included
more than one hundred and ﬁfty students, sixty of whom
comprised a special concert unit.

Although it is one of the largest in the country, the
University Band owes its fame primarily to the skillful
execution of its intricate and often novel formations. The
basis of these formations is a sheet of paper containing a
hundred and twenty dots, twelve rows of ten each, on
which the maneuver is planned so that each musician can
reach his position with the least amount of matching.
Not until it has been perfected through frequent practice
is the formation demonstrated on the ﬁeld, however.

214

Following the successful presentation of the Big Apple,

the Band this year interpreted two current dance favor-
ites, A Tirkct .4 Tm/zet and the Lzzméetb Walk. At the
Southern Methodist game the Bandmen formed a mus-
tang.

Once each year the Band attends an out of town game.
This year it went to Durham for the Duke game. On
that occasion it added a new formation to its growing
repertoire when it formed the words “Pitt" and "Duke"
in script. The Band also appeared on ice skates at the
hockey games, and played for the entertainment of bas-
ketball spectators.

Selected from the Band for their outstanding musical
ability, sixty musicians were chosen to perform in a con-
cert band which toured towns and cities throughout
Western Pennsylvania this spring, giving a series of con-
certs. The University concert was played at Carnegie
Music Hall on March 31. In April the annual ﬁve hun-
dred mile concert tour was made. This tour did a great
deal to determine the Band’s musical reputation, for it
appeared before a number of prominent conductors and
musical authorities.

To relax from the strain of its winter activity and to
reward its members for their excellent work during the
football season, a dinner-dance was held on January 27.
At this affair band keys were awarded and new ofﬁcers
installed.

torious work in the many activity and schol-
astic ﬁelds are rewarded with membership
into the honorary fraternities. These students

are the true representatives of the University
of Pittsburgh as Petar Petrovich Njegos, poet,
scholar, and statesman, whose portrait hangs
in the Yugoslavian Room, truly represents
the creative spirit of his country.

Proud indeed are those second semester junior women whose names are
called on Spring Tap Day to join the ranks of these who “have rendered service
. . . fostered leadership . . . and honored learning without display.” These
are the women who have earned the privilege of donning the black cap and
gown of Mortar Board, honorary activities fraternity for senior women.

Ushering at the graduation of their senior sisters was the first duty of the
new Mortar Board members last Spring. This fall, as senior mentors, they
guided and advised freshmen women in the friendly and sincere way traditional
with Mortar Board; and when it came time to ask the parents of these same
freshmen to the Chancellor's reception, they were among the first invited to
serve as aides.

Christmas found the l\/lortar Board girls guests of their advisors, Miss Rush,
Miss McLaughlin, and Miss Anderson at a dinner party. In February, the Pitt
and Tech chapters of Mortar Board, together with the Cwens from both schools
invited their mothers to a chapel service at the Heinz Chapel. Jane Bell, their
president, kept the round of affairs going with a slumber party at her home

between semesters.
Maintaining their tradition of fostering high scholarship, Mortar Board

recognized freshman women having high averages, and presented an award to
the girl with the highest average on Scholars’ Day.

Climaxing their year's work, Mortar Board attracted much attention at
Carnival Night during Spring Festival week; and when Tap Day ﬁnally rolled
around, they graciously stepped down and welcomed the junior women who are

to take their places next year.

Pushing away their coffee cups and lighting up their cigarettes and pipes,
the busiest men on campus lean back in their chairs and take a half hour off
for relaxation. These are the members of Omicron Delta Kappa at their semi-
monthly luncheon meeting. Here teachers, students, and alumni informally
discuss the problems of the organization, the university, and the world.

These are the men who have distinguished themselves in the fields of scholar-
ship, athletic, and non-athletic activities, for to be tapped to ODK is the fore-
most honor that a man in activities can achieve. In the early fall and on spring
Tap Day names of junior and senior campus leaders appear on the large key
designating that they have been tapped to ODK.

From March 23-25 all ODK eyes turned toward the campus of Washington
and Lee where a memorable celebration was held on the very ground where
ODK was organized twenty-ﬁve years ago. And, as a tangible landmark, a
monument commemorating the birth of ODK was presented to Washington and
Lee College by the combined ODK chapters. Gamma Circle rejoiced in the
election of her alumnus and former national council member, Stanton Belfour,
as Vice-President in the national oﬂice of ODK. '

Pitt, too, will have its landmark in the form of a Senior Walk which will
serve as a lasting memory of ODK and its members. Work on the walk has
been completed and the names of all the men honored with the Senior ODK
award for leadership will be enscribed in the stone slabs.

Happy indeed were those outstanding freshman women chosen to wear the
silver and garnet necklaces of Cwens, Sophomore Women's honorary society,
on Spring Tap Day last year. When, later in the spring, they exchanged their
necklaces for the symbolic crown and scepter, they were formally initiated into
the Anglo—Saxon order. Upholding their high Anglo-Saxon heritage, Cwens
foster leadership, scholarship, willing service, and outstanding character in
extra-curricular activities and academic studies. The high standards and ideals
of Cwens parallel those of Druids, honorary fraternity for Sophomore men.

The Cwens’s work began just after their recognition on Tap Day, when they
served as ushers at the Coronation of the Senior Queen and as aides at the Cor-
onation breakfast. Returning in the fall, they entertained Freshman women
at the High Tea during Freshman Week. When charming aides for the Chan-
cellor’s Reception were chosen, Cwens were among the first invited to help.
Just before the Pitt-Tech game, Tech Cwens entertained their Pitt sisters, and
in March Pitt Cwens returned the favor and played hostess.

The annual Cwen-Druid Tea Dance was a n0vel'”He '11 She" dance held at
Webster Hall. Clever posters drew attention to this “something new" dance,
and served as the basis for an unusual poster contest. Just before Christmas,
Cwens, combining forces with an S.F.A. committee, published a printed Stu-
dent Directory which included the names of all the students in the University.

Every other Wednesday evening they have their regular dinner meeting at
the Heinz House around a candle—lit round-table as was used in the Anglo-
Saxon period. In keeping with the Christmas spirit, they exchanged Christmas
gifts with jovial poems about the recipient.

As their active year drew to a close, they prepared to receive new Cwens
on Tap Day by giving carnations fastened to a necklace of silver and garnet to
worthy freshmen women. At the Cwens formal banquet, they ofﬁcially bid
farewell to their active membership by handing it over to the new Cwens of

1940.

Munching hot dogs and sipping soda pop, freshmen men signed up to be
prospective editors, business managers, thespians, and musicians as the Druids
welcomed them into the realm of campus activities at the annual fall smoker
on September 21.

Upholding the standards of activities among sophomore men are the wearers
of the black sweaters with the yellow emblems, the Druids. They are the mem-
bers of that ever-active national sophomore honorary activities fraternity that
serves as the ideal of freshmen men.

In January, Druids joined with Cwens to be hosts at a tea dance at the Hotel
Schenley. Rex Edwards, popular campus maestro, played for the affair which
was known as the “He 'n She" dance. Co-chairmen Virginia Childress and
Ruggero Aldisert conducted a successful publicity campaign which included a
poster-quiz contest, the winners receiving complimentary tickets as well as a
chance to win one of the door prizes: a ticket to the Junior Prom, or tickets to
any Pitt hockey game.

Rounding up their cycle of social events, Druids enjoyed another tea dance,
their formal initiation dinner following the tapping ceremony, and their long-
anticipated Spring Formal. However, never forgotten is the Druid program of
Service, Leadership, and Scholarship which found them assisting at the Com-
mons Room teas, as aides at the Chancellor's annual reception to parents of

freshmen, and as leaders in the freshmen camp program.

Every member of Beta Gamma Sigma has had his day on the speaker's plat-
form. This opportunity was granted at the annual dinner-initiation. One after
another, nineteen initiates addressed a talk on some business topic to the actives
and alumni sitting around the dinner table in the hotel Schenley's French Room.
Authoritative speeches were made on subjects ranging from "What People
Don't Know About Liquor" to "Casket Production." The Alumni, who spent
idle minutes talking about the speeches they had made as far back as 1921,
when the Pitt Beta Gamma Sigma chapter was organized, stumped the initiates
with bombardments of queries pertinent to their talks. As toastmaster for the
evening, Montefort Jones, Assistant Dean of the School of Business Administra-
tion, whose reputation as a toastmaster has spread across many banquet tables,
was in good form.

Several of the nineteen new members in the Business Administration Honor-
ary scholastic fraternity were tapped in the fall at a luncheon held in the Schen-
ley Hotel; the remainder were tapped at the regular Pitt Scholars Day tapping
in March. These nineteen junior and senior men and women were tapped for‘
their excellent scholastic attainment, initiative, leadership, and personality.
This year's award to the freshman attaining the highest quality point average,
was presented to A1 Ludwig at the tapping luncheon.

Newly decorated rooms-——Fort Pitt Hotel—Monday evening at 9:30 P.M.
—membets of Alpha Kappa Psi gather after a clay spent in business and studies
for a meeting of their fraternity. Members of this professional commerce fra-
ternity are drawn from many phases of the business life of Pittsburgh. An
Evening School fraternity primarily, it is, however, open to undergraduates in
the day school classes. Gathered in their new quarters members of the group
carried on their regular organization business and added discussions of mer-
chandising, advertising, and salesmanship.

During the past year, speakers have come to the group from the larger busi-
ness ﬁrms of the city to tell of their experiences and answer questions set forth
by members so that the latter might better adjust themselves to the problems
that they face in their everyday work. Many of the leaders brought with them
motion pictures taken at their respective business houses, to set forth their ideas
more realistically. In addition to these lectures, several trips were taken around
the Pittsburgh area. The Irwin Works and the Clairton Steel Works were the
high spots of these trips. They’ were not limited however to the study of steel
and its manufacture, other plants beingivisited among which‘ the Liberty Bak-
ing Company trip proved exceptionally interesting.

The entire year was not given over to forums and trips, for the A.K. Psi's
enjoyed the fellowship of many parties in their meeting room and others out-
side. Mr. C. C. Shepard was the founder of Alpha Kappa Psi.

Members of the Undergraduate Cap and Gown Club have relegated its formal
purpose to a secondary position and have deﬁned for themselves the desire to
make the spirit of Cap and Gown felt all year round. Only men who have been
active as members of Cap and Gown shows are eligible to be tapped to this cam-
pus honorary, with the result that there has been gathered a nucleus of men
who are capable of and interested in carrying forth this work. They have
succeeded this year through the media of smokers and dances in addition to
the regular routine activities of the Club. One of the outstanding extra-func-
tional contributions that the Undergraduate Cap and Gown Club made to the
Pitt campus came with the announcement that the annual Cap and Gown fall
dance, introducing the Pitt formal dance season, was a precedent setting no
corsage affair.

The other social functions were given in collaboration with the Graduate
Cap and Gown Club. These included three smokers open to any of the student
body interested in Cap and Gown, either through participation or from other
active support; and the ﬁnal aﬁair of the year, the annual Cap and Gown
banquet given in honor of the staff members of At Your Service. As has been the
custom, tapping of new members was held at their Fall formal, the winter
smoker, and during Spring Festival. Perhaps the outstanding achievement of
the combined Graduate and Undergraduate Clubs has been placing the Cap and
Gown show in the national lime light which has been its due for many years.
It was largely through their effort that for the first time in the history of Cap
and Gown shows the songs were published by a national company.

At the end of each year outstanding freshmen of the pre-medicine group
are recognized for their ability by membership in Chi Rho Nu. Organized in
1922 as the Chiron Club, Chi Rho Nu became an honorary pre—medical fraternity
in 1930 when its present name was adopted and standards for membership were
raised.

Once each month the fraternity meets for the purpose of promoting stronger
relations among its members and arousing interest in the medical ﬁeld. A bal-
anced program is worked out each year to include both educational and social
activities. The program this year included visits to the Mercy, West Penn, and
Magee Hospitals, as well as a trip to Mayview in the spring. Members were
permitted to inspect the hospitals, their equipment and their methods.

Initiation into the fraternity was conducted in February, following a smoker
held to acquaint members with freshmen eligible for membership. The smoker,
at the YMCA clubrooms, had as speakers Dr. Paul McClain of the Medical
School, and Dr. Williams of the biology department.

A feature of Chi Rho Nu's social program for the year was a large and suc-
cessful dance held in April. The smoker and the dance were only two of a
number of the fraternity’s social events.

An incentive to greater achievement in pre—medical studies is given the group
by an annual award to the member with the highest grades. The winner of the
honor this year was Luther Spoehr.

Delta Delta Lambda, local professional fraternity for students in the com-

mercial education department, was organized primarily to recognize and en-
courage scholarship among the undergraduate students in the field of commercial
education; to act as a medium for discussion of social and technical problems
of the business world; and to introduce to its members outstanding leaders in
commercial education work who would acquaint them with relevant facts and
current business situations. Oﬂicially recognized by the University on March 2,
1935, the fraternity chose for its name the Greek letters Delta Delta Lambda,
the initials of Mr. D. D. Lessenberrv, director of courses in the commercial
education department, and faculty advisor to the group. The present chapter,
the Cathedral chapter includes an active undergraduate membership of approxi-
mately thirty-ﬁve, with many of the graduate members participating actively
in the various group functions. The two major social events during this last
school year were the Spring and Fall initiation ceremonies. At the Fall initia-
tion banquet held on November 19, at the Greystone Manor, the Hon. Ralph
H. Smith, Judge of the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County was the
principal speaker. About seventy-ﬁve alumni members besides the undergradu-
ate members, were present. A supper dance at the William Penn Hotel was the
occasion for the Spring initiation. At other times the organization held a
Saturday afternoon luncheon for all members, and a High School Day which was
planned as a meeting of high school graduates of this district, who were par-
ticularly interested in Commercial education, with members of Delta Delta
Lambda, and faculty members in the Commercial Education Department. In
this way, pre-college students were given an opportunity to learn the types of
courses offered by the department, and to more clearly understand the general
opportunities present in the commercial education ﬁeld.

A desire to discuss mutual problems and obtain a glimpse into their profes-
sion gave pre-legal students the idea of forming an organization wherein stu-
dents might derive extra beneﬁt from their class work. In 1921, students or-
ganized the John Marshall Club named in honor of the famed justice of the
United States Supreme Court.

The present members of the club, chosen from classes of Political Science and
Economics, spend most of their time on the fourteenth ﬂooriof the Cathedral,
the new home of the Law School. These pre—legal students are given a prema-
ture glance of the practice of law by prominent lawyers invited to speak to them
at the regular monthly meetings. Judge Henry Ellenbogen, a member of the
Allegheny County Court of Common Pleas, spoke about “The Place of Lawyers
in America" at the fall initiation meeting. Another noted attorney was ob-
tained for the February tapping program in Mr. Robert H. Kleeb, regional
attorney of the National Labor Relations Board. His subject at the meeting
was “The Truth about the National Labor Relations Board." At this meet-
ing the Constitution of the student lawyers-to-be was considered for revision.

At the regular Scholars Day Assembly the names of those tapped in the
two Tapping programs of the year were added to the list of members. The cul-
mination of John Marshall Club activities was the annual banquet in May when

departing seniors bade farewell from active membership to success in Law
School.

Smokers are an important function in the social calendar of the Kappa Phi
Kappa fraternity. They serve to introduce new men, eligible for membership
to the men's honorary and professional education fraternity, to the active mem-
bers of the group. A smoker is held just before each of the spring and fall initia-
tions. The first chapter of the fraternity originated at Dartmouth in 1922 and
four years later a chapter was started at the University. Six members of the
faculty and eighteen undergraduate students chartered Tau chapter in 1926.
Today Tau is one of forty-seven widely spread chapters at various universities
and colleges throughout the country. At luncheons and dinners that doubled
as meetings of the fraternity in the past year the fraternity has listened to
guest speakers who talked of pertinent education problems that have arisen
in our modern industrial society.

Two times during the year, in spring and fall, those men of sufficiently sound
moral character, possessing recognized ability to engage in the study of educa-
tion and promote its cause, are tapped to membership. The new members taken
into the fraternity this year were honored at the annual initiation banquet,
held at the Cathedral Mansions, and took their places as brothers of Kappa Phi
Kappa, to foster education in general as well as in the University of Pittsburgh.

One of the youngest honorary fraternities on campus is Phi Eta Sigma.
Founded with the purpose of promoting a higher standard of learning among
the men of the Freshman class, this fraternity has already found a permanent
place among the groups at the University.

The national fraternity was founded at the University of Illinois in 1923,
and 43 chapters have been established since that time. The 41st chapter was
installed at the University of Pittsburgh in May 1937.

Outstanding among the activities of Phi Eta Sigma has been the tutorial
service which it has established for all freshmen at the University. Free in-
struction has been offered in Chemistry, Biology, Political Science, Mathemat-
ics, Fine Arts, Physics, and many other subjects. Both men and women were
offered the advantage of this service, and many made use of it during the first
trial period early in the school year.

There were two tappings for Phi Eta Sigma: spring and fall. The spring
tapping took place at the annual Scholar's Day ceremony. A minimum quality
point average of 2.5 is required for tapping, and men may be tapped at the end
of the first or second semesters of their freshman year. A smoker for freshmen
with honor averages at the eight-weeks grade period was sponsored by the
fraternity. Dean Tippetts spoke on the application of scholarship to everyday
life. The most outstanding scholar of the freshman class was awarded a plaque
at the regular freshman honor assembly.

Phi Eta Sigma is justly proud as it points to its campus record, and again as
it ﬁnds an increasing number of men in its ranks who are equally outstanding

in University activities life.

Pi Tau Phi, senior honorary scholastic fraternity in the College, is a purely

local organization, open to second semester Juniors in the College who have
attained a Cumulative quality point average of at least 2.5. With Dr. Omar C.
Held, Assistant Dean of the College, as its advisor, and consisting of a highly
selective membership, Pi Tau Phi has as its purpose the spread of the aims of
scholarship, Culture, and idealism, the stimulation of serious thought, and the
establishment of true intellectual standards.

Through its regular monthly meetings, the organization provided a means
of social fellowship, and an opportunity for exchange of ideas. At these meet-
ings, speakers met with the members to discuss various subjects of current
political, economic, social, or cultural interest. Dr. John C. Amundson, Dr.
Putnam Jones, Philip C. Elliot, Dr. B. J. Hovde, and Mr. Robert Graham have
spoken at these Pi Tau Phi meetings.

A mid year banquet held in January was one of the organization's outstand-
ing social events. This year Dr. A. Robinson, was guest speaker at the banquet
addressing the fraternity on the “Application of Scientiﬁc Methods to the Social

Sciences."

Though tappees are formally inducted into the College scholastic honorary
at an initiation banquet held in April, they are named at Scholars Day exercises.
The membership is usually restricted to approximately thirty. On Scholars
Day, too, Pi Tau Phi gives an award to the senior student in the College show-
ing the greatest scholastic improvement, during his last two years. This year's
award went to John J. Uhl.

In line with the traditions started last year, and, in hopes of making it a
permanent tradition, the fraternity presented a gift of money to the University
Library, with which to buy books as needed.

Whence this unusual name? Members will tell you that “q" stands for the
ultimate question, “u” for the unity of things in the universe, and "a" for the
advancement toward “x", the unknown. Club colors are green and gold-
brown, symbolic of the seasons and the progress of life. Membership is open
to Juniors and Seniors who have science majors and a scholastic average of 2.0
in all science courses. The purpose of the society is to inspire and develop in-
terest in science, and a spirit of good fellowship among student members. It
is the intention of the group to help create an interest in science among the stu-
dent body as a whole. Informal meetings were held at which outstanding speak-
ers such as Dr. Samuel H. Williams, Dr. Alfred Wall, Dr. Margaret Doutt from
Pennsylvania College for Women, Dr. Peter Gray, Mr. Adolf De Werth, con-
sulting horticulturist at the Bureau of Parks, Dr. H. B. Conn, and Dr. Walter
Donaldson took part. Other activities included ﬁeld trips such as the trip back
of the scenes in Carnegie Museum and the excursion to the Allegheny Observa-

tory.

The members of Quax instituted a new social event for this year when a
joint Christmas dance was held with Phi Sigma and Collembolae. This year
the organization instituted something new in the way of an employment
bureau sponsored by the alumnae of Quax to help place members in positions

of scientiﬁc work when they graduate.

Outstanding upperclassmen of the ROTC department are eligible for the
distinction of becoming members of Scabbard and Blade, national honorary
military fraternity. The local chapter, in keeping with the Scabbard and Blade
chapters throughout the country, attempts to develop capable leaders, to unite
the military departments of the universities of our country, and to spread in-
telligent information concerning the military policies of the United States.

Scabbard and Blade is an important social group on campus as well as being
a highly selective military organization in itself. A smoker given for new men
introduced them into the inner realm of militaristic circles and acquainted them
with requirements for membership. At the annual Military Ball, the frater-
nity presented for the first time in public, the impressive formal tapping of new
members. On the eighth of November, eighty—three chapters of Scabbard and
Blade convened at Berkely, California in their national convention. Mark
Mosoikos, president and captain of the local chapter, crossed the country as
the University representative.

New members have been tapped into the fraternity on three occasions dur-
ing the past year. At a formal dance held on November 11, twelve new men
were tapped for membership. Again at a later date six more tappees were ex-
tended the award of distinction in ROTC work. Finally six additional men
were deemed worthy of membership to the fraternity on the annual spring Tap
day.

Following each of these tappings came the famous Scabbard and Blade “hell
week" which culminated in the early morning initiation service. During this
week, upperclassmen go through the manual of arms, patrol the entrances and
passages of the Cathedral, drill, and perform other tasks set for them by their
brothers-to-be. Reporting to the designated meeting place, usually in South
Park, the new men are initiated after an all-night vigil in an impressive cere-
mony held at the break of day. Tested and tried, men of strong character to
begin with, they then become loyal members of a strong fraternity.

Sigma Gamma Epsilon, national honorary fraternity of the School of Mines,
tapped to membership outstanding mining, metallurgy, petroleum engineering,
and geology students who have excelled in campus activities as well as scholar-
ship. Not only did Sigma Gamma Epsilon act as an organization to unite stu-
dents interested in the same ﬁeld, but through its presentation of prominent
speakers at the monthly meetings, it helped students to become acquainted with
the outstanding men in the mining and allied ﬁelds. These practical lectures
served, too, to stimulate interest in recent developments in the industries, and
to provide accurate information about them.

Qualiﬁcations for membership to Sigma Gamma Epsilon include practica-
bility and sociability in addition to scholarship. Twice during the past year,
at the end of the ﬁrst semester and again in the spring, tapping ceremonies took
place at which seniors and juniors who met the qualiﬁcations were invited to
become members of the organization. Not long after the tapping, formal
initiations were held in the YMCA club rooms. The social calendar for Sigma
Gamma Epsilon was then rounded out by farewell parties in honor of the gradu-
ating brothers.

Each year a senior award has been presented to the top-ranking student who
has successfully and capably completed four years of undergraduate study in
the School of Mines. This award is in recognition of distinctive personality,
character, practicability, and an activities record, as well as attainment in
scholarship. The presentation of the senior award this year was one of the
most important events on the program of the fraternity.

A fraternity to encourage and recognize high standing in the study of foreign
languages and to foster the study of these languages has been the purpose and
the proud record of Sigma Kappa Phi for 18 years. This group of students are
a national honorary language fraternity who gather at dinner meetings once
each month to discuss their subject-in-common and to hear guest speakers from
the faculty. The fraternity has followed an active social program for the past
year under the guidance of president Miriam Harter. Among features enjoyed
by the members in addition to the regular meetings were informal get—togethers
to hear songs, recitations, and music of foreignﬂavor. Outstanding among
these was a melodrama given in German by members of the group. In the future,
dances and formal dinners are being planned to popularize the organization
with more students.

Sigma Kappa Phi, since its inception in 1921 by several faculty members,
has grown to a set membership of forty students. Members of the faculty group
who maintain an active interest in the group are: Faculty advisor Dr. W. H.
Shelton and members Johnson, Beckley, DeVitis, Fairﬁeld, Gnatkowski,
Henry, Lohstaeter, Raschin, and Scribner.

The annual award of four medals to seniors taking French, German, Spanish,
and Latin is the culmination of the organization's activities for the year and
furnishes the members a fresh incentive for study of languages in the next year.

Founded at the University of Nebraska in February 1904, Sigma Tau is an
honorary engineering fraternity established on the principles of service to engi-
neering education. Its aim is the recognition of personal attainment on the
part of engineering students. Psi chapter was established at the University in
1930, the twenty-third chapter to come into the national organization. In that
year the Association of College Honor Societies, composed of Phi Beta Kappa,
Tau Beta Pi, Sigma Chi, Phi Kappa Phi, Alpha Omicron Alpha, and the Order
of the Caif, extended an invitation of membership to Sigma Tau, the first chap-
ter to be admitted to the association since its beginning in 1925.

The symbol selected to represent the outstanding qualifications of the fra-
ternity is the pyramid and rail section. The pyramid symbolizes stability, call-
ing attention to the permanence of the organization. The rail section stands
for progress.

Requirements for membership to Sigma Tau are scholarship, practicality, and
sociability. Students in the upper one-third of the junior and senior engineer-
ing classes are eligible to be tapped to membership. Following judgment by
the active members of the fraternity to determine his practicality and socia-
bility, a candidate must receive unanimous approval before he is elected to the
chapter.

Each year its spring tapping ceremony, Sigma Tau awards two medals to
the sophomore engineering or mining students who maintain the highest quality
point average during their freshman year. The award is made in recognition of
scholastic achievement, and it is sought as one of the highest honors accorded
freshmen students by campus organizations.

Xylon is an honorary journalistic fraternity for women who hope and try
to further their journalistic interests. To women with a decided ﬂair for the
art of writing, it is a glowing ﬂame of creativeness. To become a Xylonite,
one must be an outstanding member of one or more of the campus publications.

In December Xylon held one of its several forums, at which Miss Maxine
Garrison of the Pittsburgh Press gave an interesting and worthwhile description
of “Women in Journalism." Freshmen women were invited to this forum. A
luncheon meeting for Xylon members was held in November with Miss Mary
McKenna, faculty advisor for the Xylonites, as guest of honor.

This year, Xylon has been working on a pamphlet, similar to a newspaper
done on the feature angle, to be given to the parents of the women of the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh. Xylon Day was held on May 22, at which time editors
of high school publications were entertained at a tea on the twelfth ﬂoor of the
Cathedral. Editors from city and Allegheny county high schools were invited.
At this time, a cup was awarded to the high school publication considered the
best journalistically.

Tapping and initiation of new members took place in the spring on Activi-
ties’ Tap Day. Here several promising women journalists were given green and
gold ribbons symbolic of their honor, and later were duly initiated into Xylon.

The first Tuesday of every month the members of Pi Lambda Theta meet
for dinner and a business meeting. Here graduate teachers and seniors in the
School of Education become better acquainted and exchange undergraduate and
professional ideas thus fostering a fellowship among teachers and future teach-
ers. Their program was varied this year with lectures, music, and trips to the
art exhibits. Gertrude Taber discussed her recent “Japanese jaunt." The de-
scription of “The Child in Juvenile Court" was given by Mr. Walter Rome,
chief probation oﬂicer and superintendent of the Detention Home, and Dr.
Florence Teagarden talked on “Catching Up with Ourselves." Pi Lambda
Theta numbers among its members many outstanding women including Kath-
erine Foulke, a charter member who is at present employed in the education
department in the Board of Education building.

The group's chief contacts with the students at the University are through
a tea for Junior women and through semi-annual tappings of senior and gradu-
ate women who have been outstanding in their educational ﬁelds. Every year
a Founder's Day Dinner is held so that the growth and accomplishments of the
fraternity may be reviewed. Each year this fraternity contributes to the stu-
dent loan fund.

Pi Lambda Theta's Delta chapter on the Pitt campus grew out of the activi-
ties and interests of Kappa Pi. The key of Kappa Pi was adapted to bear the
three Greek letters of the new national organization, and through this move
it became the oﬂicial key of all chapters.

The year's work was ﬁnished up on May ninth with the conferring of keys
and installation of oﬂicers.

Soft candlelight, autumn gold and brown leaves, formal dress, and the
friendly atmosphere of Heinz House, formed the background for the ﬁrst of
Panhellenic’s traditional events—the Reception for Freshman women. Min-
gling with the “sisters,” perhaps stopping to talk about the new up-swept
hair-do, the freshman women were oﬂicially introduced to women's fraternities
on campus. The freshman-fraternity relationship climaxed in spring rushing
under Panhel Council's supervision, as the freshman dashed from one fraternity
house to another, ﬁrst to a yachting party, then to a Mammy Breakfast, then
wound up with a» treasure hunt.

Panhellenic Council does not concern itself with freshman alone however.
Unifying friendships between the fraternities is encouraged by the council
under Betty Batty. New pledges of all the frats hob-nobbed across the table

At the Panhel Reception

at the Panhel Pledge Luncheon in March while mass meetings throughout the
year depicted the ideal fraternity girl, how to promote a better student-faculty
relationship, and discussed common fraternity problems. ’Tis said that friendly
competition adds ﬂavor to ordinary routine. And so across the Panhellenic
screen ﬂashed Power, S pad, and Pick-U p, Watch the Fora'x Ga By, and We'd Rather
Be Right, as the different fraternities competed in the traditional Interfraternity
Sing. Kappa Alpha Theta proved that It Pay: to Advertise by taking ﬁrsr prize.
Then marking time to the tick-rock rhythm of Tommy Tucker's orchestra,
fraternity women danced at the William Penn Hotel to climax their social year
with the Panhel Ball. Ruth Custer, Vice-President and Chairman of the affair,
led the dancers to the close of a busy year.

ALPHA DELTA PI

The ADPi's proved themselves the tops scholastically this year when they
were awarded the Panhellenic cup for having the highest scholastic average
among the girl's fraternities, theirs being 2.17. Prexyjane McCracken proudly
accepted the cup presented by Miss Margaret England, representative of the
City Panhellenic association, at the Panhellenic mass meeting in March. An-
other ADPi that had taken part in the program was Georgetta Davis, member

of the women's choral, who sang two solos.

Not limited to scholastic attainment, these girls were rewarded also for their
vocal superiority at the Panhellenic Sing in February. They bowed only to the
Thetas and took second place with their skit.

Socially the entire year was a busy one for the ADPi’s. It began when they
entertained their mothers at a lively luncheon last fall and later gave a tea
with their patronesses as honored guests. Early on their December calendar
was their winter formal at Highland Country Club. The decorations were
carried out in the blue and white, the colors of Alpha Delta Pi. During the holi-
days an informal dance was held at the home of Georgetta Davis. Those holi-
days will not be soon forgotten by the ADPi’s because as Christmas gifts they
received beautiful white linen table cloths from their mother's club and a com-
plete set of initiation robes from the alumnae.

When their province prt sident, Mrs. C. Lontren, visited in February, the
ADPi's acted as hostesses at a dinner party, a luncheon, and theater party in
her honor. Shortly after Mrs. Lontren's visit, the girls had a Valentine party
at which they played grade school games and recited nursery rhymes and Valen-
tines for everyone was the theme. The ﬁnale for their social season was the
traditional farewell luncheon for Seniors in May after which the ADPi's began
to look forward to the coming year, their twentieth as a fraternity on the Pitt
campus.

ALPHA EPSILON PHI

The year 1939 marked a thirtieth anniversary for Alpha Epsilon Phi. It
was thirty years ago that the ﬁrst chapter was founded by seven girls at Bernard
College. The local Nu chapter had two reasons for celebrating, however, one
for thirty years of growth, and the other for the habitation of their new quar-
ters in the Centre Court Apartment. The official business and social activity
of the fraternity seemed to take on added interest at these new headquarters.
Here they capably handled a large variety of projects. Among their philan-
thropic activities, the A.E. Phi's have maintained a scholarship fund which
is used to send to colleges all over the country, girls who could not otherwise
secure a College education. To do their part in adding to the fund the local
sisters gave a benefit bridge in October.

Like everv other fraternity Al ha E silon Phi aims to obtain a balance
J , 9
between its social and cultural interests. To keep the cultural activities in the
limeli ht, the Monda 7 ni ht sessions on several occasions were devoted to the
I

presentation of book reviews or speeches by prominent persons.

In addition to the October beneﬁt bridge, there were three other high spots
in the A.E. Phi’s social calendar. In December their winter formal dinner dance
at the Chatterbox pleasantly interrupted studies. White and green, the colors
of the fraternity, were the color scheme for the Mother's Day tea in May. The
spring formal dinner dance turned out to be a ﬁtting climax to a highly success-
ful season.

BETA SIGMA OMICRON

The Beta Sigs are the proud possessors of a new house on Craig Street known
as the Beta Haunt. To this new home, go pledges and actives for meetings,
parties, teas, and informal dances.

December was a busy month socially for the Betas. Proudly they celebrated
their ﬁftieth anniversary of their founding with a banquet. Their annual in-
formal Christmas party was held at the house. During the holidays, the local
and the Westminster chapters merged for their traditional mid-winter formal
at the Penn Lincoln Hotel where the Yuletide spirit prevailed with the aid to
the usual holly, mistletoe, and pine tree favors. Adding to the busy schedule,
the Mother's Club entertained the girls at a Christmas party in Heinz House.
The Mother’s Club, a member of the National Mother's Club of Beta Sigma
Omicron, hold meetings once a month and have dinner at the house.

Shortly after the holidays, Florence H. Orth, national inspector, visited the
local chapter and was entertained at a luncheon at the Schenley Hotel and a
formal dinner at the Culinaire. Later in January, the Betas went skating at the
Diamond Rink.

After spring rushing, the new pledges entertained the actives. The party
was held on St. Patrick's Day, but the pledges abandoned the usual theme of
green shamrocks for a new idea, that of a Salli Magundi party which included
playing all games from a miniature Vox Pop to a School of Swing. Completing
their socially-successful year, the Betas danced at their "Star-Dust Formal" in
April, after which mothers and daughters planned together a Beta family picnic
for June.

CHI OMEGA

The Chi Omegas are always bent for pleasure when they head for their new
fraternity apartment on Dithridge Street. Many happy hours are spent there
experiencing new thrills and delights, for the apartment is still a novelty to
them.

During the Christmas holidays the girls turned tea hostesses. Their new
patroness, Mrs. N. Andrew Cleven, wife of the professor of history at the
University, was honored at a tea, December nineteenth. The following day,
Phi Beta chapter poured tea for the Pittsburgh residents of Omicron Delta
chapter from Westminster College. In February, the Chi O's were feted at a
theatre party at the Pittsburgh Playhouse where they saw Noel Coward's
Tonight at 8-30.

On Scholars’ Day, Phi Beta chapter awarded twenty-ﬁve dollars to the
woman student excelling in the social sciences. This local award parallels Chi
Omega's National Achievement Award, which is presented each year to a
woman of notable accomplishments in the ﬁelds of public affairs, art, the pro-
fessions, business, education, and literature, by virtue of the Personnel Research
Federation, and of the American Association for Adult Education.

In the spring, the girls spent several active days entertaining Miss Helen
Gordon, their national representative. Plans were made to "again send a dele-
gate of Phi Beta chapter to the Fireside conference for active chapters, as Chi
Omega, locally and nationally continues to step ahead.

Challenging the attention of students in the Czecho-
slovak room is the motto of the Czechoslovak Republic,
“Pravda Vitezi"—“Truth Conquers"~—Vvhich appears
above the blackboard on either side of a bronze relief of
the President-Liberator, Thomas G. Masaryk. It was
necessary for a committee of men and women of Czecho-
slovak origin who live in the Pittsburgh district to toil
for fifteen years to gather funds and to complete the ar-
rangements of the room.

In the wall opposite the entrance door is a shrine, in
which is a dedication message from Thomas G. Masaryk,
written as President of the Czechoslovak Republic to the
students of the University of Pittsburgh. This letter,
dated 1929, was placed in the shrine by Jan Masaryk, the
son, on March 7, 1939, the day of the dedication of the
Czechoslovak room.

Overhead in panels cleverly forming one end of the
ceiling are portraits of eight outstanding personalities in
Czech and Slovak history. They are Cyril and Methodius,
Knize Vaclav, Jan Hus, Jan Amos Komensky, Jan Kollar,
and Stur and Moyzes. The ceiling is also decorated in
the fashion of the old Slovak churches with the native
ﬂowers found in the High Tatra Mountains of Czecho-
slovakia. The portraits on the ceiling were painted by
Richard Wiesner of Prague.

The plaster walls of the room are of a mellow White,
decorated with Moravian designs. These paintings, mi-
raculous trees that grow ﬂowers, leaves, and birds, are
the work of Karel Svolinsky. In the niche at the rear of
the room, is the tree of life, whose branches emerge from
behind a parchment imbedded in the plaster wall. This
manuscript is a proclamation of Charles IV when he
founded the University of Prague in 1348.

The woodwork is of larch, a characteristic wood of
the Carpathian l\lountains. The furniture is of oak. The
seats of the student chairs are upholstered in red leather,
giving the room an atmosphere of vitality. The panels
in the professors desk are of magniﬁcent inlay such as
are found in palaces of the Czech Renaissance. The actual
work of inlay with rare woods was done by V. Kopka of

Moravia.

The architectural plans for this classroom were drawn

by Bohumil Slama, one of the leading architects of

 

Prague. The bronze relief is the work of O. Spaniel, one-
time rector of the National Academy of Art in Prague.
It was possible to receive all the works of art because of
the personal interest of a Committee in Prague headed by
Dr. Jaroslav Preis, president of Zivnostenska Bank, Dr.
Alice Masaryk, honorary President of the Czechoslovak
Red Cross, Prof. Imrich Karvas of the Comenius Univer-
sity in Bratislava, and many other distinguished citizens
of the Czechoslovak Republic.

DELTA DELTA DELTA

The local Tri-Delt chapter played hostess at their province convention in
Pittsburgh between semesters. Thirty representatives arrived early on Friday
morning, February third. Before lunch, the sisters compared notes on every
topic close to the heart of a fraternity girl: rushing, dances, pledging, dues,
and such subjects. That afternoon Dean Amos and Miss Rush were the speakers;
discussion followed on their topics. After the buffet supper, the local chapter
gave a dance in the Venetian Room at Webster Hall. The visitors made a tour
of the Cathedral and the Oakland district Saturday morning. In the afternoon
Dr. Auleen M. Jamison spoke on marriage and Louise Thaden, prominent Tri-
Delt alumna, reviewed her newest book, Hig/9, Wide, and Frigbrerzed. The ﬁnal
affair of the convention was the formal banquet at the Greystone Manors.
Sally Fogle, prexy of the local chapter, was one of the speakers. Each repre-
sentative felt that the convention was a grand success for each had contributed
and received in return something really worthwhile.

"Save your Phillip Morris wrappers" was a battle cry last fall as fraterni-
ties cornpered to win the radio-victrola, the prize for collecting the most
wrappers. The Tri—Delta cry proved the most effective when the ﬁnal count
was made and the prize went to them. They have a novel way of keeping up-
to-date on records. At their pledge dance in March, the admission was a new
record for each couple.

A Pansy breakfast for the departing Seniors is a tradition for the Delta Delta
Deltas. This year, the breakfast came the morning after the Senior Ball so the
very sleepy Tri-Delts stayed overnight at the house to be on time to arrange
pansy corsages for the guests of honor. This event and the spring formal at the
Shannopin Country Club in June completed the 1938-39 calendar of active
Delta Delta Delta.

DELTA ZETA

When Delta Zeta held their national convention at Pasadena, California,
last summer, two members of Omicron chapter were marked present. Helen
Poole, president of the chapter, and Lucille Uptegralf made the long trip to
represent Pittsburgh Delta Zetas. In the convention’s “Parade of Flowers,"
Omicron entered a miniature of the Cathedral of Learning made in roses. Back
in Pittsburgh, Delta Zetas were busy getting their new house in order for the
opening of school. Football Saturdays found the Delta Zeta's and their friends
celebrating the victories with hot-dogs, coffee and doughnuts,» and dancing to
the best bands of the land.

Chapter meeting programs were built around careers for women. The topics
of the great speakers ranged from the ﬁeld of medicine to the study of new hair
lines. The founders of Omicron chapter led a discussion on “Why Delta Zeta?"
The fall pledge dance was carried out in true pledge style with decorations and
programs in the shape of pledge pins. December found the D.Z.'s dancing in
the Chatterbox of the William Penn Hotel at their annual winter formal.

The Mothers‘ club of Omicron chapter was busy this year with card parties,
showers for the house, luncheons, teas, and parties for the Fathers. The mothers
presented the girls with many lovely gifts for their new house and taught them
the art of home economics.

Spring brought the end of the social activities for the school year and was
climaxed by the Spring formal at the Shannopin Country Club. Then the house
was closed up for the summer as the Delta Zetas set out for picnicing and camp-
ing at Ligonier.

KAPPA ALPHA THETA

Social activities of the Thetas were ushered in with a dance last fall, but the
affair they will long remember is the combined slumber party and open house
held during the Christmas vacation. While the snow whirled against the
window panes outside, the Thetas, clad in pajamas and housecoats played bridge,
danced, “gabbed," and ate. Before morning, it was evident that the slumber
party had been misnamed, after the “bull sessions" which lasted far into the
night, the girls‘ slept only three hours. They were up bright and early to pre-
pare for an afternoon party in honor of the Kappas, who had entertained
them in November. This party later became an open-house affair when
women from other campus fraternities dropped in during the afternoon.

March brought forth an alumni party and a dance in honor of the new
pledges. No special occasions were necessary in order that the members and
pledges might enjoy a full social program, however. They held Wednesday
afternoon teas, lunched together, and enjoyed an occasional Sunday night
spread.

Last summer's vacation was spent at a cottage by Conneaut Lake, where the
Thetas swam, boated, rode, and danced. So well liked was this sojourn that the
group has planned to return to Conneaut this year. '

“Something old and something new" seems to have been the motto at the
Theta house. Early in the year they had their downstairs modernized into a
new chapter room furnished in Early American style with an open ﬁreplace and
pine wainscoting at either end of the room.

KAPPA KAPPA GAMMA

This year newly decorated Kappa Kappa Gamma house was duly initiated
and christened at an open-house tea, to which all men’s and women’s frater-
nities were invited. So proud were the Kappas of their beautiful new home that
they adopted a new policy for their social year—‘ ‘A social party every month."
This policy went over in a big way, with a house dance being held on this
schedule regularly.

In October, the Kappa Alpha Thetas were guests, and in December, the Theta
Phi Alphas were entertained, each having a house dance held in its honor.
Christmas brought the annual Christmas party with a silly gift and nonsensical
poem for everyone. Also included in the Christmas festivities was a charity
party for eight children from the Soho Settlement House. To enter into the true
spirit of the party, the Kappas reverted to their childhood days, entertaining
their young guests with various games and songs. With Christmas vacation
so hectic, the Kappa House became a veritable haven for these socialites, when
it became headquarters for a three-day house party just before classes resumed.

Kappa Kappa Gamma was the first Women's National Fraternity to have a
magazine, and was the ﬁrst to call a Penhellenic meeting. In her philanthropic
work, she has sponsored a Hearth Stone Fund, which is used in erecting houses
in which alumnae sisters may live during their later lives. There is now one of
these houses in Florida.

To round up their activities for the year, the Kappas held their Spring Formal
at the Pittsburgh Field Club in june—and then said good-bye for the summer.

PHI MU

Unique is the word for the Phi Mu's “new-face party," an excellent get-
acquainted affair. Each Phi Mu escorted a friend who had never attended a
Phi Mu event which make their social calendar novel among the campus
fraternities. Early in October, june Shafer entertained her sisters and their
beaux at a house party at her summer home in Foxburg. Tennis, golf, dancing,
and a moonlight hike ﬁlled an enjoyable vveek—end. In September, several Phi
Mus visited the chapter at the Universit_v of West Virginia. A week later, when
these sisters came to Pittsburgh for the Pirt—WestVirginia game, the local chap-
ter gave a party for them. At the fall rushing tea held at the Chapter room, a
rose and white color scheme was carried out even to the dainty sandwiches.

The lucky Phi Mus did not do all the entertaining during the year. One
moonlight night in February, they drove through a heavy snowfall to a party
at the home of their patrons, Dr. and Mrs. Engelder. The following night,
the mother's club, which had been organized in September, gave a theater
party at the Kilbuck theater.

Last August Phi Mu which is the second oldest women's fraternity had a
national convention in Ashville, N. C. This spring the district convention was
held at Penn State late in April. Several girls from the local Beta Theta chapter
represented their sisters, to help carry forth bigger and better plans for Phi Mu
fraternity.

PHI SIGMA SIGMA

The twenty—ﬁfth anniversary of the founding of the fraternity and a conven-
tion in New York set the pace for the Phi Sigs. The national project recently
undertaken by Phi Sigma Sigma fraternity was to provide seeing-eye dogs for
blind persons who are unable to afford them. Naturally, the Phi Sigs at Pitt took
their part of the project and gave a beneﬁt bridge at the Schenley Hotel to pro-
vide seeing—eye dogs for girls who were offered scholarships to college, but who
couldn't accept them due to loss of eye—sight. After this project was success«
fully brought to a close, the girls eagerly looked forward to their national
convention in New York during the Christmas holidays. The Biltmore Hotel
was the home for the girls in New York. From the Biltmore radiated all events
of the grand and glorious convention. Here all the problems of the fraternity
were solved, all elections held, and all business settled. But they all claim that
their stag parties in the rooms of the various girls about three each morning
were the best part of the fun.

The eleven Phi Sigs who went to the convention came back with a new na-
tional project. The delegates chose the popular problem of student refugees
and decided to provide scholarships and homes at Phi Sig chapters all over the
Country and in Canada for these refugees.

However it cannot be said that the Phi Sigs let their social activities at Pitt
slide because of their national undertakings. Their traditional winter dinner
dance was held December ninth, at the Chatterbox. Combining social and
cultural activities, the girls went to plays at the Nixon, to lectures and the like
several times during the year. Phi Sigma Sigma put a ﬁnis to the year with a
spring formal dinner dance before ﬁnal examinations.

THETA PHI ALPHA

Confetti, balloons, gay colorful costumes, the T.P.A. house decorated in
Crepe paper in true New Orleans style made the Theta Phi Alpha’s Mardi Gras
a real success. Roulette wheels whirled, fortunes were told, bingo was played,
and darts hurled by the guests who represented every organization on campus.
Grand prizes for the evening were a Philco radio and a large basket of fruit and
candy.

The Mardi Gras came just a few weeks after the T.P.A.'s held their annual
winter formal at the William Penn. This year's dance was a supper dance in
the charge of the social committee.

‘ The first affair of the year was the traditional fall dance held the first Satur-
day in October. Appropriately the house was decorated in autumn leaves and
football colors. Several additional informal dances were held during the months
of October, November and December.

Like every fraternity, Theta Phi Alpha has its traditional events. In addi-
tion to their winter and spring formals, they have a pledge dinner for which
Father Rock and Miss Ellen Geyer were guest speakers this year, and an Alum-
nae-Active “get—together." At this year's “get—together" Mary Lou McClain,
president of the local chapter, spoke. Entertainment was provided by the
actives. Another custom started this year which the T.P.A.’s hope to make a
tradition is their “open house" every Sunday Afternoon.

Something different from the usual Mother and Daughter or Father and Son
banquets was the T.P.A. Father and Daughter dinner in May where the often-
neglected “poppas" were guests of honor.

ZETA TAU ALPHA

The ZTA’s kept the spirit of close fraternalism ﬂourishing during the summer
months at a barn dance, picnics, parties, and meetings so that when they ﬁnally
assembled for their first Monday night meeting, there was little vacation gossip
to catch up on.

Particularly memorable to the ZTA’s was the first affair of their highly
successful social season. On a brisk October night on wagons piled high with
hay, singing Zetas, and their best beaux, had horses pull them over the South
Hills. Tea dances celebrating football victories; a Thanksgiving dance with
the traditional fall leaves, pumpkins, and candles; a gala Christmas dinner
with poinsetta favors and surprise presents; the winter formal at the Churchill
Valley Country Club bedecked with pine trees, holly, and mistletoe; and Sadie
Hawkins Day at the Craig Street house kept the ZTA's on a gay round of
social affairs.

A wee bit 0' Erin came to the Zeta house with the pledges as guests of honor
at a St. Patrick's dance. The rugs were rolled back, and shamrocks and Irish
pipes hung on the walls. With the spring came the loveliest of all Zeta affairs,
the spring formal at the Shannopin Country Club—ﬂowers, filmy dresses, moon-
light, and a midnight supper.

Despite their many active social affairs, the Zetas can always be found
scattered over the campus in Stephen Foster, the Publications offices, the Com-
mon's Room, and the twelfth ﬂoor participating in University activities and
keeping the name of Zeta Tau Alpha in the limelight.

The apron string for social fraternities is the Interfraternity Council, the
leading fraternal group on campus. Launching forth upon its twentieth year
of guidance and supervision, the Council has completed two successful decades
in promoting the cause and general interest of the social fraternities. Organized
to improve and augment scholastic, athletic, and general educational activities,
the Council has bound together and fostered fraternal organization by means
of cups, dances, sports programs, scholarship and athletic trophies, sings,
swings, balls, and dinners~all under the vigilant eye of Robert M. Corley,
Assistant to the Dean of Men.

Twenty-six boys from thirteen fraternities met monthly to mold fraternity
policies and activities. Last year brought forth a brilliant harvest of projects.
For the second year, an All—Point trophy was awarded to the house amassing
the highest number of points in interfraternity athletic and scholastic competi-
tion. Coupled with this award was the interest and participation of all the
fraternities in the intramural athletic program, as well as in the stiff competi-
tion for the scholarship cup. In the fraternal atmosphere of the annual Inter-
fraternity Ball, held in March at the William Penn Hotel, the All-Point Cup
was awarded to Phi Delta Theta fraternity.

Analagous with the year’s program, a successful Sing and Swing carnival
and competition was featured in December, climaxing in the selection of cham-
pion “Ed" and "Co-ed" swingsters. The Christmas holidays were enjoyed
after an extensive canned goods campaign conducted under the auspices of this
philanthropic organization. Progressive dances were held throughout the year,
promoting an economical, friendly means of enjoying interfraternal hospitality.
In strictly parliamentary fashion, Council sponsored classes in parliamentary
procedure for the presidents of campus organizations. And looming before a
temporary committee as the most vital issue ever before an I—F Council is the
suggestion for building a Fraternity Row on campus.

Closely knit, fraternal, progressive, the Interfraternity Council brings to
fraternity men a helpful hand, promoting friendship and entertainment for the
men, at the same time advancing the reputation and respect of the University.

DELTA TAU DELTA

The boys at 4712 Bayard Street tore away from summer pleasures a little
earlier this year and after a frenzied ﬂourishing of brushes faced the oncoming
season with a bright, newly-painted house. Soon to take advantage of their
fresh surroundings the Delts started off the social season with a house dance
to get the boys together before rushing season. The Delts were ahead of the
ﬁeld in presenting the first year men a chapter paper with fraternity songs, an
informal history, cartoons, and biographies of members prominent on campus.
T/ye Pam!‘/967' Delt, edited by Stan Williams, house manager of DTD, featured
several advertisements that emphasized the advantages of “going Delt." An-
other feature of the rushing program was a radio broadcast dedicated to DTD
by KDKA.

The Alumni Homecoming, held the weekend of the Pitt-Fordham game,
found the Delta Shelter completely covered on the outside with corn stalks and
large cartoons by john Uhl, corresponding secretary of the fraternity. The
unusual dis lay was lighted by ﬂoodlights and had large cut—out letters placed
in the win ows. The Winter Formal, big dance of the ﬁrst semester, was held
on February 4, at Churchill Valley Golf Club.

The Delt men made an issue of scholarship and came up with a first place
award for the second semester of 1937-38 and third place for the ﬁrst semester
of 1938-39. An incentive to scholarship in the house is the plaque given to the
chapter by Lieutenant Colonel O. H. Schrader, former faculty adviser of the
fraternity, for the purpose of honoring the boy with the highest quality point
average in each senior class. Not alone in scholarship does the Delt name stand
out, for in Interfraternity ping pong, bowling, and indoor track the Delt teams
placed right up front.

Each year the Delts look forward to the pledge-sponsored Bowery Brawl
held in the house and the big Spring Formal, held at Churchill Valley Golf
Club; this year the dances were again true to formwsuccessful dances to ﬁnish
a successful year.

KAPPA SIGMA

Here's a house of boys who work. For several weeks the brothers donned
overalls and proceeded to paint, paper, and completely renovate their residence
on North Dithridge Street. And their work was not in vain, for the Kappa Sig
house shines as one of the handsomest on the Pitt campus. ’

Their versatility is unquestioned, for, besides being general carpenters,
painters, and house renovators, the brothers include among their lot football, 
basketball, and track stars; a composer Whose songs appeared as hits in the $7
Cap and Gown show, and who played the lead in last year's Ceiling Zero as pro-
duced by Pitt Players; a brother who carried off the Interfraternity Yuletide
Festival Swing Cup; the prexy of the School of Mines; and a chapter president
who serves duty as a gymnastic instructor. The Kappa Sigs have also won
fame for keeping a high scholarship rating.

Wishing to encourage their fathers in the fun and fellowship of rushing, the
Kappa Sigs have made it a custom to include an annual father and son smoker
during rushing week. .

With an enthusiasm that has won many trophies for the fraternity house,
the Kappa Sigma brothers claim the distinction of having been the first recipi-

LAMBDA CHI ALPHA

The past school year will not be “just another year" to Lambda Chi Alpha,
but it will linger long in the memories of the boys as one of outstanding achieve-
ment and advancement in the local fraternity world.

Early in the year, the local chapter absorbed the entire membership of Kappa
Alpha Phi, a local fraternity previously affiliated with a national business
group. Discussion and approval of the merger plans came at a dinner meeting
of the officers of both houses. Both undergraduate groups approved of the con~
solidation and the national oﬂice of Lambda Chi Alpha gave the necessary per-
mission. Initiation of the Kappa Alpha Phi’s into the national fraternity was
completed previous to the fall rushing season. The merger of the two frater-
nities was a decided advantage and it greatly strengthened the roster of Lambda
Chi.

Construction of the new Municipal Hospital on the grounds of their home
necessitated moving from Terrace street to Fifth avenue. Their new house is
closer to the campus and more modern than the old one. Putting it in the
words of the Lambda Chi's, "We have the most modern and best equipped
house on campus.”

Starting a move that may gain a foothold among the fraternities at Pitt,
the Lambda Chi's have an art gallery of their own. Pictures line the walls of
the bedrooms, halls, and study rooms, and even their ping pong room houses
part of the collection. The paintings were given to the boys by the Pittsburgh
Art Studio which formerly occupied their present house.

Swing tunes of Artie Shaw and his orchestra provided music for many house
dances and social events held at the house, for the boys are rabid Shaw fans and
have more records waxed by the new King of Swing than any other house on
campus.

At one of the recent house dances the decorations were the fraternity colors
in soft lights. When they were hosts at the Progressive dance, they poked fun

PHI DELTA THETA

It was intermission at the Interfraternity Ball. All eyes were on the Phi
Delt boys as their fraternity was named the winner of the annual Interfraternity
All-Point Trophy for 1939—~the trophy symbolizing all—round athletic and
scholastic achievement gained in competition with the other fraternities on
campus. Phi Delta Theta has always managed to gather an extra share of
trophies and awards, for its well crowded mantel as testimony to good sports-
manship and winning ability, the characteristics of real champions.

This year's athletic competition found them out in front invthe Interfrater-
nity and Intermural touch football leagues, having been declared champions
in both divisions. In other sport events—track, mushball, bowling, basketball,
ping—pong, and volleyball,—~they were consistent enough to bring in the coveted
IF cup. The Phi Delts did not confine their activities to the field of athletics,
but notably spread their membership into the band, glee club, and publications
activities. In the elective offices of the student government organizations, this
fraternity was well represented. Ten members of Phi Delta Theta were mem-
bers of the varsity and freshman football teams. During the past year, also,
Phi Delt alumni served as coaches of schools and colleges throughout the
country.

Between their many athletic events, the Phi Delts took time out to celebrate
their victories. Fall Saturdays were occasions when the brothers hurried down
from the stadium with their dates to enjoy tea dances at their Dithridge Street
home. After the football season, hay-rides, treasure hunts, and skating and
swimming parties replaced the afternoon dances. The fraternity also had the
honor of giving the first of the series of progressive dances among the social
fraternities this fall. —

PHI EPSILON PI

This year saw the Phi Eps celebrating their Silver Anniversary—twenty-ﬁve
successful years on the Pitt campus. Today their house at the corner of Bayard
and Neville Streets is one of the finest of the fraternity group. During the sum-
mer the Mothers Club sponsored a number of large card parties, the proceeds
of which went into a gift for the house. Early in the school year the entire
house was redecorated, and now displays an up-to-date homelike atmosphere
with modern furniture and colorful paint work.

The Silver Jubilee celebration lasted for two grand fun-ﬁlled days. Features
of the program «included a formal Stag Banquet and an exclusive New Year's
Eve Dinner Ball at the William Penn Hotel, with the nationally known or-
chestra of Tommy Blue providing the music. Combined with the Anniversary
was the annual convention, at which the yearly award of recognition to the
person contributing outstanding service to the Jewish cause was bestowed upon
Jonah B. Weiss. A cocktail party and supper dance held at the Phi Ep manor
concluded the Anniversary celebration.

Phi Ep's Wally Hirsh chairmanned the Soph Hop this year, and set a prece-
dent on campus by establishing a no-corsage policy. The boys lost no time this
season in beginning their social activities. They invited the Freshmen women
to the house for a tea on October 2, and have held several informal dances since.

One of their big affairs was a novelty masquerade given in honor of ‘Marshall

Pr_” ' ‘ ' ‘ ' ' ‘ ' ' ' ' ‘  ' ' ‘ ‘ALLEN MUSSOFF "Biggie" Goldberg. The fraters have a habit of kidding “Biggie" about being a
V1” Pref" ‘ ' ' ‘ ' ' ‘MARSHALL GOLDBERG mountaineer down from the West Virginia hills, so everybody donned hillbilly
S“ ' ' ' ‘ ' ‘ ' ' ' ' ‘ ‘ ' ‘ ' ' ‘ "BERNARD HORN and farmer clothes and, amidst broken wagon wheels, held an old-fashioned
Tm” ‘ ' ' ‘ ' ' ' ‘ ' ' ' ' ‘ ‘LAWRENCE LEYTON barn dance. The affair was quite a success with due credit to the helpful serv-

ices of the Mothers Club.

The Phi Ep house set an early date for breaking records at Pitt this year by
clasping the triangular pledge pin on twenty-eight new men. Probably the
swing orchestra with the hot-stepping floor show on the last night of rushing
had a telling inﬂuence.

PHI GAMMA DELTA

The spacious Phi Gam house, formerly Chancellor McCormick's home,
gained a valuable addi'tion this year in its masculine recreation room, panelled
with knotty pine in the same manner as their den. Little Wonder the boys are
tempted to linger there for just one more game on the billiard table or across
the ping-pong net. A frémdly game .

The Fijis certainly radiated the football spirit last fall, holding the distinc-
tion of being the only house on campus to celebrate each game with a dance in
the evening. And under the able coaching of Bob Thurbon, Fiji junior on the
varsity squad, the Phi Gams ﬁnished second in Interfraternity touch football.

This year’s prized Interfraternity Sing cup went to the Phi Gams at the an-
nual contest in Foster Memorial last December. In fact, the boys have made
several additions to the trophies lining the shelves in the den. At last year's
Spring Festival they took second place in the Sweep—stakes, carried home the
first place cup for outdoor track, and received the runner-up cup for indoor track.

The well-known Phi Gam social events have been unusually successful this
year. A week before Christmas vacation the pledges presented the brothers with
a Christmas dance. With the help of the Mary McCay Club (Fiji mothers) the
entire house was covered with silver tinsel and large red and green puff balls.
The evening's climax came with a Grand March, when everyone received a
novelty present from beneath the lighted tree.

PHI KAPPA

Known for years as an activities and athletic fraternity, the Phi Kaps are
equally as proud of another side of their life. The boys take great pride in the
home life created by their house mother and justly so! She is the one who sees
that everything is “just right" at social events in the house for “her boys."

Being the only Catholic fraternity on campus, Phi Kappa has as one of its

purposes encouragement of loyalty to God and clean living among the members.

Kingfor ;/,, ﬁn; umk _ _ _ ,1’ 5 ,.m;,,~,,g The fraternity ‘has a chaplain from the local parish who visits the house from

time to time, and all the boys think that he's “one swell guy" and a person

with whom they share their problems. Throughout the year they hold retreats

which they attend in a body. During the Lenten season, a three-day retreat

was held atSt. Paul's Monastery on the South Side. Accompanied by their
chaplain, the boys spent the week-end in religious thoughts.

Spare time is spent in preparing the A-mu-yer, local publication of Phi Kappa.
This printed newspaper, one of the finest on campus, is issued three times a
year and is the delight of all the members. Editorials, stories, articles, and jokes
are written by the journalistic-minded Phi Kaps, and advertisements are se-
cured from local merchants by the silver—tongued solicitors from the business

 

staff.

PI KAPPA ALPHA

Pictures of girl friends, red, blue, and gold triangle football emblems, ﬂags
of foreign countries, and candid camera photographs decorate most of the rooms
in the PiKA fraternity house. But one room boasts its originality in no uncer-
tain terms, the PiKA's amateur radio broadcasting station, owned and operated
by Bruce Taylor, their Vice President. The monotonous clicking of the tele-
graph key and static dots and dashes, ring through the house all hours of the
day. Electric wires wind about windows and hallways; radio tubes and other
apparatus clutter all the chairs; and the transmitter and receiver reposes on the
top of the clothes closet. Acknowledgment cards of communication from sta-
tions in United States, Canada, and foreign countries are pasted on the wall
above the mantel. The brothers fail to understand the code, but they are proud
of the one radio station the PiKA's have ever owned.

Rushing week provided all around good time and entertainment including
a dance at the Monte Carlo, and a trip through the Mellon Institute. Earlier
in the year, the pledges held a Bowery dance at the fraternity house. Atmos-
phere was a typical old-fashioned bar-room dance ﬂoor with all members
bedecked in overalls and checkered shirts, and with barrels and sacks of hay
strewn about the ﬂoor.

The regular “bull sessions" have been enlivened this year by Ed Hollstein
and Ray Light who vacationed in Europe last summer and bicycled in Denmark,
France, Germany, and several other countries, while Ted Snyder, envy of all
the brothers, spent his vacation as a camp director in Canada. Displaying their
best in harmony, the PiKA sing team added a cup to their mantel for placing
in the annual Yuletide sing competition.

PI LAMBDA PHI

Anniversaries bring back memories, and celebration of the silver anniversary
pﬂxj, We,',, “[1,. 0,413,. . . _ of the founding of Gamma Sigma chapter of Pi Lambda Phi has given actives
and alumni alike the opportunity to look back over twenty-five years of schol-
astic and activity achievement on the Pitt campus. All Pi Lams took time out
to remember and ‘talk over the experiences which have clung to their memories
in the past quarter century. Alumni made the celebration an occasion for re-
newing their acquaintanceship with the house and its undergraduate members.
Climaxing the festivities, which included a banquet, a stag smoker, and an
open house, was the annual spring formal, held this year at Churchill Valley
Country Club, the affair where laughter and enjoyment took the place of serious
thoughts for the evening.

 

Winning the 1937-38 Interfraternity Scholarship placque was an honor
which increased the prominence of the Pitt Pi Lams who mounted the much-
desired award in their campus-renowned “Blue and Silver Room." A high
scholastic rating has always been the goal of this fraternity.

Social events gave the Pi Lams more opportunity to feature their originality
in dance ideas, such as the long—to-be-remembered “Barbary Coast” affair for

SIGMA ALPHA ESPILON

An addition to their already overcrowded mantel of cups and placques came
when Sigma Alpha Epsilon was awarded the cup of the Co-operative Buying
Association for the most efficient and best managed fraternity on campus dur-
ing the past year. To the SAE's this was a reward for their well placed efforts
of the past years.

In the entertainment ﬁeld, dances at the SAE house were noted for originality
in plan and execution. The Bowery Brawl featured decorations and entertain-
ment in accordance with the style and customs of the “Gay '90's." The success
of the affair started talk around the Belleﬁeld Avenue house about the “gayer
'30’s." To celebrate the coming of winter and to play host to visiting SAE's
from Carnegie Tech Chapter, at winterset party was staged shortly before the
Christmas holidays. Decorations were carried out in traditional winter style
and drew many comments from visiting fraternity men. Another unusual dance
idea of the past year at the house was the "Blind-date Dance” at which the
men had an opportunity to enlarge the acquaintanceships.

During the rushing season, SAE's entertained with the usual smokers, dances
and theatre parties, but added an unusual feature when they held a steak fry
in North Park as a part of the week's festivities. One of the largest and oldest
greek letter fraternities in the country it was founded in pre—Civil War days at
the University of Alabama and now has a membership of 40,000 with 11?.
chapters throughout the country.

THE GERMAN ROOM

"Stern endeavor wlaicb no ardzwur task can rlmke

To the hidden fewer of trut/9 atm2'm."'

These words, as Schiller wrote them in German, are
emblazoned in red, gold, and blue letters, on the walnut
panel above the professor's dias in the German Room.
Together with a quotation from Goethe, which is above
the bookcase at the other end of the room, it typiﬁes the
spirit which the room, in early German Renaissance style

attempts to catch.

Walnut paneling, richly carved, inlaid, forms the basic
treatment of the large room. On the wooden ceiling
beams, which separate the ceiling paneling, are placed
the colored crests of fourteen prominent German cities.

Carved crests—those of the two oldest German uni-
versities, Heidelberg, l385, and Leipzig, 1409-surmount
the entrance arches, which are supported by carved wal-

nut columns.

Above the blackboards and panels runs an archtrave in
which are carved the names of twenty famous philoso-
phers, poets, artists, musicians, mathematicians, and
scientists who have contributed to the greater German
culture. The furniture in the room is made of walnut.
The ﬂoor consists of quartered oak planks pegged, rather
than nailed, down.

Visitors have found the most interesting feature of the

23

   

German Room to be the six intarsia panels or inlays
which are on the doors and cabinets of the room. On
the doors are scenes from Rothenburg and Nuremburg,
while the closet panels show scenes of four famous
characters from German literature: Lorelei, Parsifal,

Siegfried, and Heiden Roslein.

 

The six wrought iron chandeliers follow the general
Renaissance style of the room and were made in Germany.
In each alcove at the ends of the room are two wrought
iron wall brackets.

The German Room was designed by the Pittsburgh

architect, Frank Linder.

SIGMA ALPHA MU

Another year in their twenty-year stay on the Pitt Campus has come and
gone, and the members of Sigma Alpha Mu look back on 1938-39 as a success-
ful chapter in their history. Rushing season saw them entertaining at one of
the alumni's homes in Coraopolis Heights. A dance celebrating the Tech
game was planned as a victory affair but although the game was disappointing,
the dance brought some measure of relief to the SAM's. In the line of journal-
ism, the boys continued to put out their local organ, the Pu"-Rm, while reading
The Ottagonimz, national publication, for news of other chapters.

One of the most important activities of the year at the Belleﬁeld Avenue
house was the reception of the Sigma Alpha Mu National Secretary, James
Hammerstein, who honored Psi chapter with a visit in December. Pledges
learned fraternity history and customs and local members and alumni enter-
tained for the secretary’s visit. In a burlesque of the present-day business condi-
tions, the SAM's held a hard times dance soon after the secretary's visit. An-
other house dance was held during March when Sigma Alpha Mu was one of
the hosts at the Progressive Dance.

The national convention, held during the Christmas vacation as usual, found
the delegates travelling out to Kansas City to meet with the representatives of
other Sigma Alpha Mu chapters. The visit of the fraternity’s regional advisor,
Hy Kopp of Syracuse, was another occasion to show off the house, its members
and pledges.

SIGMA CI"-II

The brothers of Sigma Chi have what they term a “darn good rushing chair-
man" in Andy Cancelliere. That he deserves such a title is shown in the results
of this year's rushing: Sigma Chi was second in the first semester rushing and
ﬁrst in the second semester rushing. Not content with this, the Sigma Chi's
hit the books and came out on top in the scholarship race for the ﬁrst semester.
The local Beta Theta chapter ranked fourth in scholarship among ninety-eight
chapters of the fraternity for 1938.

Sigma Chi Was founded at Miami University at Oxford for the purpose of
promoting a spirit of friendship and to encourage scholarship. Beta Theta
chapter was established at the University in 1909 and has preserved the original
purpose for thirty years.

The Sigma Chi's took part in three conventions this year, the national bien«
nial convention held at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles being the most
important. Jack Bellas represented the local chapter at this convention. The
province convention took place at Bucknell University in March, and the dedi-
cation of the Constantine chapter memorial in Georgia gave-members a clearer
View of their fraternity's history.

Outstanding on the Sigma Chi social program was the spring formal dance
which Jack Bellas successfully managed on May 20. Prominent, too, were the
smokers and parties given for rushees in the fall and again this spring.

THETA CHI

“Innovation" has been the byword of the Theta Chi’s this year. Starting
with a refreshing coat of paint for the front pillars of the house and new, green
leather upholstery on the furniture, Theta Chi has inaugurated many novelties.
First of the new_ ideas of the fraternity was to have alumni preside at the initia-
tions of new members as a means of promoting closer contact between under-
graduates and alumni members.

In order to determine what type of dances the members enjoyed most Theta
Chi's experimented with many different ideas in house decoration for their
social affairs. Attractive costumes of the period furnished an authentic setting
for their Bowery Brawl, when the house was dressed as typical of the “Gay
Nineties." The pledges were given a chance to show how they could decorate
the house, when after the Pitt-Penn State football game, members of the Penn
State chapter, Omega, were entertained with a post game dance.

Another innovation of the year is the Alpha-Ber, the local chapter's publica-
tion, which is put out by actives and alumni together. Musically inclined mem-
bers have formed a vocal group, the Alpha Beta Glee Club, which not only
provides music at the chapter house, but also went to a local night club to sing
T/as Sweet/gem‘: of Theta C/az‘ accompanied by a prominent alumnus, Sammy Kaye,
and his orchestra.

A visit by Alfred H. Aldridge, national secretary of the fraternity, gave the
boys a chance to show off their modern house and enlarged membership, for
the local chapter recently absorbed Theta Delta Psi, local Engineering fraternity
to add much to an already strong, versatile chapter.

JIM HAGAN
Director 0]‘ At/aleticr

Following a trend which has been sweeping the coun-
try’s educational institutions, athletics at the University
this year have been spread out to offer healthy activity
to more students and to fit in more with the general plan
of an institution of higher education. Prime factor in
this drive was the inauguration of a highly organized in-
tramural competition to arouse student interest. Touch
football, basketball, bowling, volleyball, mushball,
ping-pong, tennis, golf, horseshoes, handball, track, and
swimming competitions were held for both fraternity and
independent groups which represented school divisions,
clubs, and classes.

A special feature of this plan to increase athletic par-
ticipation among the student body was the rigid enforce-
ment of scholastic requirements both for participants in
the intramural and varsity sports. Intramurals, started
last year, have proven to be farms for the varsity squads,
especially in the minor sports.

Meanwhile the major athletics, football and basket-
ball, besides the minor traveling teams, continued on
their way as brilliant, and not so often bright, stars in
the intercollegiate sports world. The football squad,
though championshipless, received the most prominence
of the University teams as it won eight contests in a back-
breaking ten game schedule. Until upset by Carnegie

Tech, the first eleven was hailed as the greatest team in
the land, the “Dream Team," and even as the greatest
team of jock Sutherland's in all time. Even after this
“most outstanding upset of 1938" until the Duke defeat,
the Panthers were still red-hot candidates for the Rose
Bowl and the Eastern Championship. The largest crowd
ever to see a football game in Pittsburgh, 72,867, watched
Pitt not only score on Fordham, but wallop them, 24-13.
This game, coming after three Pitt-Fordham scoreless
ties, was adjudged the outstanding of any collegiate game
of the season, and left both teams in a weakened, but
satisﬁed, state. Marshall “Biggie" Goldberg, senior left
halfback and fullback from Elkins, West Virginia, for
the second consecutive year was a country-wide choice
for All-American honors.

Rising in prominence to the number two spot in Uni-
versity athletics, John McSorley's two-year-old hockey-
ites again won the city title, but lost their chance for
another Eastern crown when they were defeated twice by
John Carroll, 3-2, in the playoff. Larger crowds than
last year, which certainly must have been gratifying to
Athletic Director Jimmy Hagan, who introduced the
skating sport to the Blue and Gold in 1938, filled the
Duquesne Garden to watch the Ice Panthers. The in-
creased fan-support was rewarded with a ﬁve extra-period

game against Duquesne which ended, at two o'clock in
the morning, in a 1-1 tie. “Doc" Carlson's 1939 “glam-
our boys" slightly improved the previous year’s record,
but more important was Jimmy Hagan’s announcement
of cessation of court competition with Duquesne and

last year's intramurals, and, after an absence of ﬁfteen
years, returned to broaden the roster of University sports.
The team barnstormed through a fourteen game schedule
from April 11 to June 10, creating a marked fan interest
that showed possibilities of making baseball an impor-
tant feature of University competition.

Late in the year plans for improving the intramural
setup of Engineering, independent, and fraternity leagues,
with the respective fall, winter, and spring programs,
was announced. These included organization for better
ofﬁcials, by training impartial physical education majors,
for more adequate space, and for more enthusiastic par-

ticipation.

A feed for intramural manager:

 

Dr. John Bain ("Jock") Sutherland
To the students, to the football men, to the
faculty, and to the alumni the ever-popular Dr.
John Bain Sutherland is more than a football
coach; he is a leader, a teacher, and an inspir-
ing example for all men who know him. In
these traits lies the distinction which other
coaches known only for their football prowess
lack. It is his constant concern not to glorify
himself nor his great nation-renowned football
teams; but rather he pushes on toward that
higher ideal, the advancement of education in
his Alma Mater. Dr. Sutherland has expressed
these sentiments time and again with the
words, “Pitt is my school and it is yours. For-
get about football and bend your efforts toward
making the University of Pittsburgh the out-
standing educational institution of the
country.”

All who have come in contact with him on
and off the gridiron have felt the tremendous
force of his personality. It is the opinion of
many that Jock has always done more than any
other individual to exemplify those ﬁne ideals
of manhood, leadership, loyalty, and character
which any great university should aim to de-
velop.

The deep—rooted and sincere faith which Dr.
Sutherland’s players have in him is well-known
and oft—repeated. “Anything the ‘Old Man’
said always was right" has been a typical com-
ment of a Sutherland—coached Pitt man. Loyal,
human, and altogether ﬁrm and strong in char-
acter, Dr. Sutherland is a splendid inspiration
to those he has taught.

The Pitt football team didn't win all of its games this year;
it lost two. Pitt didn’t win the mythical national champion-
ship this year; it didn’t win the eastern championship, and it
didn't win the city of Pittsburgh title. Pitt didn't receive any
trophies, not even a "feeler" for the Rose Bowl. Impressions
such as these were the ones left by the 1938 defending national
championship football squad of Dr. Jock Sutherland, whose
teams usually are synonyms for “best” each year. Neverthe-
less, Coach Jock rated this 1938 eleven one of his "greatest"

teams; just a "great" team that lost two games.

Opening the season this year on September 24, the Panthers
started off in impressive style by soundly trouncing a threaten-
ing band of Mountaineers from West Virginia, PITT l9—WEsT
VIRGINIA 0. Marshall Goldberg made his debut as a fullback
by going over for the first two Pitt touchdowns, while Joe
Rettinger, sophomore end, hit the headlines in his first varsity
game by picking a team-mate's fumble out of the air, then
stepping across for the final score. Leading 6-0 at half time,
the Pitts scored early after the next whistle, this time a 33-
yard slash through tackle by Harold Stebbins. The third score
was the result of a typical Pitt sustained drive of 80 yards,
with power-running, junior halfback Larry Peace doing most

of the ball carrying.

“Goldberg aromzd end‘ '

An opening game victory for the Gold and Blue being noth-
ing out of the ordinary, it wasn't until after two decisive de~
feats of Temple and Duquesne that fans again began to visual-
ize a national championship for the Cathedral Campus. The
Pitt ﬁrst eleven emphasized its titular reputation as it marched
for scores almost every time it took possession of the ball for
and easy win, PITT 28—TEMPLE 6. Five minutes after the open-
ing whistle in the Duquesne game, Dick Cassiano again went
over from ten yards out, Bill Daddio converting after each six-
pointer. PITT 27—DUQuEsNE O. The unusual spectacle of 18
passes being thrown by the ground minded Panthers held a

Stadium crowd spell-bound.

Kixb ﬁnd: the pat}; wide open

The Oakland Footballers massed 60 points in the next two
weeks, surprisingly overwhelming two reputed opponents,
Wisconsin and Southern Methodist. Driven back to its own
18-yard line early in the first quarter by the only Wisconsin
offensive thrust of the day, the visiting Panther rushed back
with a roar that all Madison must have heard when it scored
four touchdowns and two conversions in the last three periods
to take its fourth straight, PITT 26—WIscoNsIN 6. “Gody"
Gile received a 24-yard pass from jack Tennant in the end zone
for Wisconsin's first score in two years of play against Pitt.
The next week the rising Panthers were back in Pittsburgh
ready to greet a new name on the Pitt schedule, Southern
Methodist University. The Mustangs came out of the South-

west with a hot swing band and plans to upset the vaunted
Pitt Panther. They went home with a hot swing band and a

Five prominent decisive victories indicated that the jungle
Cats of Oakland might be well on their way to another na-
tional crown, and an opponent of three previous scoreless ties
listed for the week put football spirit on Campus at a climatic
peak. The final score was PITT 24—FoRDIIAM 13. Bill Daddio
had the honor of breaking three years of point famine when he
dropped back to the 13-yard line to kick a field goal. The

closing period.

After keeping themselves defeatless for 23 consecutive
games with teams from all corners of the country, the Pitt
Panthers, the “dream team,” was embarrassingly awakened
by its across-the-street rival, Carnegie Tech, with a CARNEGIE
TECH 20—PITT 10, defeat. Curly Stebbins took the opening
kickoff, was escorted safely past midﬁeld by magniﬁcent block-

Daddio converted. Condit's pass to Gene Muha plus Car-
nelly's extra point evened the score for Tech. Minus "Biggie"
Goldberg, Pitt was no match for the victory hungry Skibos
in the second half, Muha assuring a Scotty win by crashing
over for a third touchdown from the one—yard line.

In the next two-week period, Dr. Sutherland’s team raised
itself from the realms of the humiliated back into the national
spotlight with powerful wins over Nebraska and Penn State.
"Biggie" Goldberg's injured knee kept him on the sidelines
the next week for the entire game. Breaks gave Pitt its first
two scores, but the last was a well—earned Cassiano number,
on the tail end of a 68-yard drive. Dick Cassiano, the Panther
junior left halfback, furnished the major thrills to a damp
crowd of 14,000 which braved the rain and chill of the only

poor football day of the season to watch Pitt's Powerhouse
roll over Penn State, PITT 26—PENN STATE 0.

Taking the long train ride to Durham, North Carolina, for
the ﬁnal game with Duke, the Panthers could contemplate

their one ﬁnal chance for outstanding recognition for the year. .

But snow and Eric Tipton, whose toe has since become famous,
won a victory and the Rose Bowl assignment for the Southern-
ers. Time after time the aggressive Blue and Golders were
pushed back by the offensively weak but defensively strong
Blue Devils. Tipton's toe kept placing the ball out of bounds
inside the 20 and 10 Pitt markers. Chickerneo kept success-
fully kicking the ball out of danger from the end zone. Finally
Petdu blocked the last of Johnny's goal-shadow boots, and
fell on it for a six-pointer and victory; DUKE 7~PITT 0.

BASKETBALL

Although his crew this year was composed almost en-
tirely of green sophomores, in contrast to last year's
senior-laden first ﬁve, Skipper Carlson steered his Pan-
ther mates through a stormy campaign that showed 10
victories and 8 setbacks, an improvement on the former
year's passive record of nine wins and a dozen defeats.
The record included second honors in the city race and a
third place deadlock in the fading Eastern Conference.

Signiﬁcant developments which took place off the ﬂoor
were the Carlsonites' secession from two competitions.
First, Pitt and Duquesne decided to call it quits after a
long-standing, heated rivalry. Later, the Blue and Gold,
deciding on a free lance schedule, withdrew from the
Eastern Conference.

COACH CARLSON

In their first game at Evanston on December 9, the
Jungle Cats tamed the Wildcats of Northwestern, 48-37,
but at Peoria, the next night, they bowed before a highly-
geared Bradley Tech offensive 56-39. From the West, the
freshly monickered "glamour boys" of Pitt swung to
Dixie. There they first avenged a football loss by swamp-
ing Duke, 51-37, on December 16, and then “took"
Richmond by a 47-24 count several days later.

After celebrating their home inaugural in gala style by
upsetting a rangy Cornell outﬁt 50 to 39 during the
Christmas recess, the Jungle Cats saw their winning ways
come to a halt when they stumbled before their 1938-39
nemesis, Carnegie Tech, on January 10. Over 3,000 fans
jammed the Tartan court to watch Tech lead most of the

way, ﬁnally winding up in front, 55-50. The scores add
up to the highest total ever registered in an Eastern Con-
ference game. Although Pitt kept lagging behind within
striking distance, Combs, Stark, and company ruﬂled the
nets often enough to stay a step ahead. A second defeat
followed that same week when,Westminster’s tall Titans
took a 45-37 triumph home from the Stadium.

On the fray which rang down the curtain on their cage
relations, the Panthers were easily overpowered by Du-
quesne's dazzling Dukes at the Stadium on January 28
by a 40 to 29 margin. Coach Chick Davies’ speedy sopho-
mores used a tight blockade zone defense to stem every
advance made by the Pitt lads, who had to ﬁre away at
the basket from back court. The Dukes held sway all
the way, for only Straloski's long heaves caused them
trouble. Thus came to an end, at least for the present, a
colorful competition between two strong basketball
squads.

_ Revived by the injection of Sam Milanovich into the
lineup at center, the jungle Cats snapped out of their
brief slump of three straight losses as they ﬁnally turned
back Temple, 42-36, and as they did the same to Carnegie
Tech, 51-43 at the Pitt Pavilion. In the Tartan skirmish,
the "glamour boys," again paced by Eddie Straloski,
whittled down an 18-9 Skibo margin to romp off with a
well-earned verdict. Tumpane and Stark of Tech tossed
in shots from all corners during the early stages of the
game, but the Carlsonmen stymied the Scots with their
tricky “ﬁgure eight” as the game wore on.

Suffering their worst drubbing in eleven years, the Pitt
cagers went down before the onslaught of Penn State
here, 41-22, on February 8. Deﬁnitely in rare form, the
Panthers missed no less than 60 out of 66 ﬂings at the
hoop, whereas the Lions made it their night to howl by
tossing in fourteen consecutive free throws. In addition,
the tilt broke the jinx the Pitt floor squads held over
Lawther-coached teams. Before 3,500 customers in Phila-
delphia's Convention hall three days later, the Panthers
fared somewhat better as they handed the Owls of Temple
a 36-27 win.

The real highpoint in the Panthers’ season, as far as
victories were concerned, was their pair of wins over
Georgetown, leaders in the Eastern Conference most of
the way. Each time that the Hoyas were ready to sew
up the Conference crown, up came Pitt to take the wind
out of their sails. Baeting Georgetown in a hectic con-
test here on Frebruary 13 by a 43-41 tally, the Carlson
Cats repeated over the Hoyas at Washington three weeks
later, 44-39. The second upset sent the Eastern Confer-
ence into a three-way tie.

Between the Georgetown clashes, the Pitt passers
bowed to West Virginia here 45 to 42, clawed the Ford-
ham Rams at Madison Square Garden 40-34, and tumbled
at Penn State 36-35. The Panthers wound up their up-
and—down season by whipping West Virginia at the Pitt
Stadium on March 4, 49-43.

enced material and heavy schedule.

Although Coach Olson's hospital list and A.A.U.
squabbles drew most of the early indoor season public-
ity, a come—back by Johnny Woodruff and the rise of
several sophomore stars to prominence salvaged some

belated glory for the Panther trackmen. The late indoor
spurt points toward an even greater outdoor record than
last season when the Gold and Blue thinclads dominated
the Penn Relays as well as ﬁnishing near the top in both
the I.C.4-A. meet and the outdoor Central Intercollegiate
Conference meet.

A series of ill-fated trips tied up Coach Olson's men
during the greater part of the year. At the Millrose
Games, February 4, Johnny Woodrulf sprained a tendon
in his leg. A week later, in Boston, Larry Tregonning,
sophomore speedster who had replaced Long John, in-
jured his foot. On February 18, in New York, Kenny
Ryden aggravated a throat ailment by competing in a

special N .Y.A.C. invitational hurdle race and spent the
remainder of the indoor schedule in the hospital battling
a severe case of scarlet fever. The first good showing
did not come until March 11 at Notre Dame in the in-
door C.I.C. championships.

Long John's return to form was the turning point in
the fortunes of Coach Olson's troupe. The 1936 Olympic
800 meter champ captured first place honors in the C.I.C.
half-mile and helped teammate Frank Ohl score a victory
in the 440 the same evening. The following week-end
at Indianapolis he returned to the anchor slot in the mile
relay, breaking the tape for his teammates ahead of
Michigan and Ohio State, two of the nation's fastest
quartets.

Before Woodruff's return, the mile relay team enjoyed
fair success. The combination of Ohl, Al Ferrara, Clyde
Graf, brilliant sophomore speedster, and Al McKee ﬁn-

ished third in both the N.Y.A.C. games and the I.C.4-A.
championships, then led the pack by more than ﬁfty
yards at Notre Dame. At Indianapolis the 3220.8 mark
that the Ohl-Ferrara—Graf-Woodruff combination reeled
off was the fastest indoor time ever recorded by a Pitt
mile relay team.

The most consistent individual performer of the indoor
campaign was John Bazyk, husky junior shot putter. In
addition to over—shadowing the ﬁeld by more than a
foot in Winning the C.I.C. contest, Bazyk placed second
in the N.Y.A.C. games and Butler Relays. He created a
new University standard at New York, when he heaved
the iron ball 50 feet V2 inch, 3% inches past his own
former mark set last year. His performance stamps him

as one of the front ranking collegiate shot putters of the
nation.

Sophomores Dave McDowell and Joe Newman and
senior George Clifton also contributed to Panther point
totals in the indoor carnivals. McDowell hovered around
the six foot mark consistently in the high jump and
placed in the I.C.4—A’s, the C.I.C. meet, and the Butler
Relays. Newman, being groomed to fill Kenny Ryden’s
shoes as number one hurdler, copped third place in the
C.I.C. 70 yard high hurdles. Clifton's score in the pole
vault came in the Butler Relays at Indianapolis. Frank
Ohl's broad jumping efforts were also productive of Pitt
scores in the I.C.4-A's Butler Relays.

THE HUNGARIAN ROOM

The Hungarian Room was designed by Denes Gyorgyi,
who won first prize in a limited competition among’
Hungarian architects sponsored by the Hungarian Minis-
try of Education. Professor Gyorgyi, who also designed
the Hungarian Government building at the International
Exposition in Brussels, has said of the room:

“It is designed in complete agreement with Hungarian
character, but with the American viewpoint of practical
utility in mind."

The simplicity of the general atmosphere of the room
is offset by the brilliant dashes of color which have been
added. The walls of the room are of ﬁne grained oak
veneer, arranged into geometric panels, with an oak
wainscoting carved with nineteenth century Hungarian
designs.

The carved oak door is one of the architectural and
artistic gems in the Hungarian Room. The door displays
several Magyar patterns and, waist high, the name of
the country both in English and the Magyar language.
The parquet ﬂoor is representative of Hungarian style.

The five seats of a bench in the rear of the room are
upholstered with robin's egg blue leather. The twenty-
ﬁve student chair backs are hand carved with distinctive
Magyar motifs. The blue chairs are matched by the blue

cloth used in the lining of the cupboard.‘

Additional color is found in the highly ornamented
squares, with a red background, which form the ceiling.
The decorations on the squares are characteristic of
Hungarian peasant art. Along the upper edge of the
walls are carved phrases from the Hungarian national
hymn. The letters, ﬁlled in With red, form a binding

border for the broad expanse of plain oak wall.

 

Cream-colored curtains, embroidered in Hungarian

style, and red over-drapes cover the windows in this
room. At some later date a native wall tapestry depicting
a phase of Hungary's cultural achievement will be hung

on the back wall.

A mathematician could easily prove that the Pitt
Hockey Team had only a good, rather than an unusually
successful, season in 1938-39. In his proof, he could
show that the Panthers won fourteen, lost eight and tied
three, that they scored 55 goals to their opponents’ 41,
and that the ten leading scorers in the eastern division
of the Ohio—Pennsylvania Collegiate Hockey League in-
cluded only three Pitt men. His ﬁgures would be correct
enough, but they would be inconclusive.

Actually the pucksters coached by John McSorley were
one of the two outstanding athletic squads at Pitt the
past year. Six of the eight defeats were by one goal, an-
other by two, and the eighth an 11-0 walloping admin-
istered by a near-professional Yale team which was
clearly out of Pitt's class. Ignoring the Yale score, a
non-league game, makes the Cathedralites defensive rec-
ord look better, while offensively it wasn't that the Pitt
boys couldn’t run up big totals, they just didn’t bother.

Rising early, practising Sunday when the Duquesne
Garden Rink wasn’t being used, Coach McSorley's two-
year-old proteges, have carried an athletic spirit and
ﬁght into their contests that ﬁgures do not show. To
Pitt fans who constantly ﬁlled the stands at their con-
tests, the Panthers were the hit of the season.

HOCKEY

Over the regular season, Pitt collected two victories
each from Case, Western Reserve, Baldwin Wallace, and
Fenn, knocked of Carnegie Tech three times and tied
the Skibos once, battled john Carroll to a 2-2 standstill
and later dropped a 3-1 decision to them and produced
one triumph in four starts against Duquesne who ﬁnished

 

Goalie Elli;

on top of the league. The win over the Dukes was by a
2-1 margin in the first meeting of the two clubs. The
Bluff sextet took the next engagement, 2-0, and the third,
3-2. A fourth game also went to the Dukes, 3-2, after
McSorley removed his team from the ice in the second
period as a protest of referee Terry McGovern's decision
in overruling the goal judge and awarding Duquesne a
goal during a scramble at the Pitt net.

It was in the playoffs that the Panthers really showed
their courage and ability. Although James Hagan, di-
rector of athletics, was willing to concede Duquesne's
superiority and opposed divisional playoffs, Duquesne
and the league officials insisted that the series be run
through. Unluckily for the Dukes, McSorley's proteges
did not concur with Hagan’s opinion of their strength as
division leading materials. ‘

The Hilltoppers won the first game 3-2, but when the
second clash resulted in a 1-1 stalemate after ﬁve over-

.r

 

times, 115 minutes of play, the Panthers came back to
take the next two battles and the series, 3-1 and 2-1, with
goalie Bud Ellis displaying sensational form. Still tired
from the Duquesne matches, the Panthers lost twice by
3-2 counts to John Carroll, western division titleholders.
Pitt tied up both games in the third period after trailing
but on each occasion the Streaks’ Eddie Arsenault won
the game in the overtime with scorching shots.

Ellis, Bob Schooley, Taylor Brittain, Chuck Connick,
and Lenny Broido will be gone from next year's squad,
but Dick Friday, the team’s leading scorer who beat out
Schooley with 18 points to 17, will be back as will Bob
Lowe, Pat Cusick, Clyde Shiring, Irv Artz, Vic Williams,
and Burgin Digby on the line, and Bill Schildecker and
Walter Lovett, two line defense men. Jim Lowe, Bob's
brother will be a sophomore next season and should be
a help, while George Dressler, another freshman, prom-
ises to be pick of the crop of the league goal tenders.

BASEBALL

After an absence of ﬁfteen years from college baseball,
the Pitt Panther returned to the diamond game. Long a
major varsity sport until it was discontinued after the
1924 season, baseball this year snatched the spring lime-
light from golf and tennis. S

Coach Ralph Mitterling, a former Philadelphia Ath-
letics‘ outﬁelder and a baseball coach for twenty years,
called out the baseball candidates early in the season.
Anxious to get a line on his 1939 outﬁt, Mitterling began
spring training midway through February. Preliminary
workouts for the batterymen were held on the Stadium
basketball ﬂoor. While batting was impossible indoors,
the remainder of the squad reported for practice shortly
afterward to work the kinks out of their throwing arms.

Last spring's intramural baseball tournament, which
put nearly ﬁve hundred into diamond action, supplied
Mitterling with most of his material. Although several
varsity football men, who were leaders for regular posi-
tions—-Johnny Chickerneo, Ben Kish, Frank Goodell,
Rudy Gradisak, and Joe Rettinger—-had to drop out be-
cause of spring football practice, there was no lack of
good men.

Treola. Johnson and Haluska were relief hurlers.

Top men in the catching position were George "Red”
Hartman and Bill Schildecker, sophomore hockey player.
Salko was also an outstanding candidate for the mask
and mitt spot.

Outstanding players of the intramural league formed
the nucleus for the varsity inﬁeld. Bob Funkhouser, Phil
Scheiding, Ed Straloski, Bill Brown, Bob Foliart, Eddie
Hughes, Al Holbrook, and Gus Troy all ﬁlled the inﬁeld.

Several outﬁelders engaged in a red-hot battle for the
three outer-garden positions. Alfred Butch, Andy Mur-
ray, John Snyder, Howard Hershman, Edward Keiper,
Howard Uptergraf, Walter Lovett, Charles Krane, Sol
Merlin, Milton Ripp, James Dugan, Richard Mauker,
and James McCann were outﬁelders on the team.

The squad appeared in fourteen games, beginning April
11 with a four game junket through the South, and clos-
ing the season at State College on June 10.

The opening trip pitted the Panthers against George-
town at Washington, D.C. on April 11. A brace of games
with the Duke Blue Devils at Durham, N. Carolina, fol-
lowed on April 13 and 14. The South Carolina Game-
cocks furnished the opposition on April 15 at Columbia,
S. Carolina. After a rest of nearly three weeks, the Pitt-
men tangled with the West Virginia Mountaineers on
two successive days, May 5 and May 6, in the opening
games on the Stadium diamond. Encounters with the
Penn State Lions on May 9 and 10, again at the Stadium,
brought the brief home season to a close. The team trav-
eled East to meet Temple in a single game at Philadelphia
on May 13. Seven days later, Indiana Tech opposed the
Panthers at Indiana. The Panther diamond aggregation
then journeyed to Morgantown, there to play the West
Virginia Mountaineers on May 26 and 27. Two games
With the Penn State Lions at State College on June 9 and
10 completed the baseball slate.

Pitt's four home games were played on the Stadium
diamond, with home plate located in the northeast cor-
ner. A screen was erected in front of the right field stands
to prevent “cheap" home runs. With the erection of

TENNIS

The Pitt tennis team completed a successful season last
spring with an impressive record showing nine wins and
one loss. The Panther netmen were led by their Captain
and number one man Ralph Bald, whose all-court game
made him a hard man to beat. “Tireless Joe" Kristufek's
stamina was too much for most opponents, too, and Joe
at the number two spot, won many long, drawn-out en-
gagements. Bill McKenna, at the number three position,
turned in several impressive wins. Adrian Hartman de-
pended on his usual chopping game to down strong
opponents. Johnny Mogan's sharp forehand and Dudle
Weiss' ﬂashing backcourt stroking added many points
to the team's scores. Light and Kaufman, while not
playing regularly, participated in several net battles.

The Panthers opened the season by routing Bethany,
9-O. Then followed wins over Allegheny, Grove City,
Indiana State Teachers, and Carnegie Tech. Ohio State
administered the lone Panther defeat in the sixth match,
6-3. But the Pitt team took up its winning ways again
to defeat Waynesburg, 8-1; Grove City, 9-0; West Vir-
ginia, 8-1; and Carnegie Tech, 6-1. The netters closed
the season again trouncing Waynesburg, this time by a
9-0 score.

SWIMMING

The Pitt swimming team, or the Pittsburgh Water
Follies of 1939, as it may well be called, directed by Pat
Corr and featuring co-captains Bill Brown and Walt
Mowotny, with Milt Lederstein, Al Beacon, and a great
supporting cast, fully lived up to the traditions of suc-
cessful Pitt Swimming teams. Performing in comparative
obscurity, except on the night on which they swam be-
fore a packed house of seven thousand at Ohio State,
these hidden heroes compiled an enviable record. The
Panther splashers came out on the long end of the score
six times, while losing only twice. After scoring only
one first place (in the ﬁfty yard free style by Walt
Nowotny) against a Big Ten champion, Ohio State, the
Corrmen gained at least partial revenge two nights later
by outstroking the Ohio Conference Champion, Kenyon,
for their most important victory of the season. One more
blot marred Pitt’s record; they couldn’t quite make the
grade against the powerful Franklin and Marshall squad
—but they were far from disgraced. In local competi-
tion, the Panthers were supreme, as they swept through
Slippery Rock, Temple, Allegheny, Penn State, and West-
ern Reserve with the loss of but two events.

GOLF

The Pitt Golfers, coached by Art Snyder, travelled far
and wide last spring, ﬁnally to return with eight wins
to their credit as against two lossestmaintaining their
position as one of the strongest teams in the East.

The divott diggers were able to carry their independent
campaign without a defeat. However when they reached
the competition of the Middle Atlantic Division of the
Eastern Intercollegiate Golf Association, they were
forced to be satisﬁed with third place. Members of the
strong Georgetown and Princeton teams gave the Pitt-

ites plenty of trouble.

The first three men in the lineup of the Pitt team were
ranked with the best Collegiate golfers in the East.
Frank Souchak, No. 1 man, copped the decision nine
times out of ten; while Barret Melvin lost only two and

Tony Kaye, No. 3 man, went undefeated.

RIFLE TEAM

Another successful but somewhat obscure team among
the University sportsters was the varsity Riﬂe Team.
Wending their way up the hill to the riﬂe range under
the stands in the stadium, the boys drilled long hours
under the guidance of Captain Mitchell making ready for
the regular matches.

Throughout the year the boys maintained an average
that few teams have been able to maintain. Three wins
out of every four telegraphic matches saw the boys at
their peak. Shoulder to shoulder matches with Carnegie
Tech, Penn State, Ohio State, and Akron, along with the
National Intercollegiate Riﬂe Shoot at Annapolis were
the season’s high spots.

Number one man on the team was Evan Sage, captain.
Hoffman, Purnell, Stiffey, Diefendorf, and Frankovich
were holdovets from an outstanding team of the year
before. Several new men reported to Captain Mitchell
and, proving their ability, were given a chance to prove
that the University sharpshooters were second to none.
New men to fire were Peris, Berkey, Hittinger, Ayers,
and Bridges. Evan Sage's early score of 383 out of a
possible 400 points set the high mark for the season.

INTRAMURAL

 

In the heavy barrage of epithets and comments set up
by outsiders, the new intramural policy set up by the
University was smothered under as far as the general
public was concerned. To Pitt students, however, and
those concerned in any way with the campus, the intra-
mural competition was the biggest thing of the year.
More University men joined in this program than in any
feature the campus has yet seen. Over a thousand men,
experienced players and "greenhorns," fraternity and
independent, commuters and campus residents, engineers
and Y.M.C.A., all took time to build and exercise the
bodies that housed growing minds. At Pitt, despite any-

292

Inrrzzmuml C MC/Jar

thing that has been published to the contrary, athletics
is every man's interest and not that of the selected few.

To the head of this broad program was appointed
James Potts, assistant track coach at Pitt for twelve
years. His wise planning and judgment, his unexcelled
management of a large and often untrained staff, and
through all an untiring effort to establish not a new
program alone, but actually a new idea in athletics,
directs much of the credit for the remarkable success to
him. He and his assistants divided competition among
three circuits, a league comprising the social fraternities,
an Engineering league with representatives from the

ATHLETICS

I ezmzmzmzl Referee;

various divisions of the School of Engineering and Mines,
and an independent league made up of all other teams not
included in the ﬁrst two sections. All three league cham-
pions in each sport met at the close of that particular
season in a playoff series to determine the outstanding
club of the entire group.

The schedule for the year was split into three seasons,
Fall, Winter and Spring, with five or six sports included
in each season. Although the original plan had been to
appoint a student manager to oversee each season, and
other student managers to each sport, the plan was found
too complex for immediate use, and a few standbyes
were entrusted with the administration. Oliver Stiff,
long an employee of the Athletic Department, had charge
of and did most of the clerical work of the program, as

293

well as notifying the contestants personally or through
their team managers, of the time of the games. Track
star Frank Ohl headed the staff of oﬂicials and acted as
general handy-man for both Potts and Stiff. Included in
Ohl's contingent of whistle blowers were basketball
players Sam Milanovich and Joe Barron; Track men
Larry Tregonning, Bill Nurmi, and Larry Katz; and
Physical Education Instructors Jim Jackson, Charles
Radi, Karl Oermann, and Dave Ward. Varsity cheer
leader, Clarence Shephard, acted as sport manager for the
fall tennis tournament. Last, but of tremendous impor-
tance to any well regulated intramural program, were the
managers of the various teams without whose coopera-
tion the whole setup would have been seriously weak-
ened.

A ﬂying block

Although the intermural fall program
started out very ambitiously, only touch foot-
ball was completed on schedule. Tennis and
horseshoes were popular, but rain and cold
weather brought both sports to a close before
the tournaments had reached the semi-final
stage. The chief difficulty encountered was
in making contact with various boys to let
them know the time of their matches. While
no deﬁnite conclusions could be drawn, some
of the combinations looked very good in both
tournaments. Had there been championship
matches, it is probable that the teams of Myer
and McArdle would have met Engh and Wyar
for the horseshoe crown, while Basset and
Martin, Rau and Kinsey, and Burns and Lari-
mer should have fought it out for the tennis
laurels. Of the other fall sports, little can be
said. The decision to throw open the annual
track and field handicaps to all men in the
University came too late to publicize the fact
sufficiently to the student body, and the meet
was devoted almost completely to competi-
tion among the freshman track team. A pro-
posed cross-country race was abandoned when
the weather became too cold for men not in
condition.

They were able to come back! Those six
words characterize Phi Delta Theta, 1938 in-
termural touch football champions. Defeated
early in the season by Phi Gamma Delta, the
Phi Delts fought their way back to the fra-
ternity league championship, then followed
with two climaxing triumphs in the tri-
league playoffs with the Metallurgists, engi-
neering league cham ions. The Mets previ-
ously had eliminate the Newman Club, in-
dependent league titelists, in the first round.

In the championship game, the Phi Delts
squeezed out a 7-6 win over the Metallurgists
by striking early, then being content to sit
back and break u all the Metallurgists'
thrusts. Shortly aﬁer the opening kickoff
Bernie Cashdollar of the Phi Delts passed to
Larry Smith in the end zone for a score, and
then added the extra point by passing to
Black after taking a lateral from Park. The
Mets scored when Mann intercepted one of
Cashdollar’s hurried passes on his own 25 and
chased his way to a touchdown. After a suc-
cessful extra-point try was recalled and the
Mets were penalized for offside, Mann's pass
was batted out of Reilly's ﬁngers on the one-
yard line.

A rizzger in 1/76’ zzzalzing

More extensive and better received by the
student body, the intramural winter program
far outstripped the fall program. With five
sports actively participated in by the better
than one thousand boys enrolled in the ven-
ture, the 1938-39 winter campaign was the
biggest thing in Pitt intramural athletics
history. '

As during the fall period, the three league
setup of fraternities, independents, and engi-
neers prevailed. Basketball proved the most
popular sport, all three leagues taking part.
Bowling and table tennis rated next in appeal.
The fraternity league had complete entry lists
in both sports but the lack of response from
the engineers and independents caused a con-
solidation of the two leagues in each sport.
The independents and the Greeks played vol-
leyball but the engineers entered no teams.
Handball enlisted only five teams, all frater-
nities.

Lest it be thought that the independents
and engineers were indifferent in their reac-
tions to the program, the point should be
made that although the fraternities had pre-
viously played all of the five sports but hand-
ball, only basketball had been offered to the
other teams under the old intramural organ-
ization. Thus, the turnout by non-fraternity

groups for sports other than basketball should
be taken, and is taken by the intramural de-
partment, as an indication that future partic-
ipation in these sports by all teams will in-
crease.

Fraternities gathered in all of the five intra—
mural trophies, defeating independent and
engineer representatives in the inter-league
playoffs at the close of the season. Lambda
Chi Alpha and Delta Tau Delta, handball and
table tennis champions respectively, were
awarded the titles without the necessity of
playoffs since few table tennis and no hand-
ball matches were played by the non—fraters.

The outstanding team of the season was the
Phi Kappa basketball dreadnaught. Only once
during the entire season did the Phi Kaps fail
to overpower their opponents. That night
Phi Delta Theta, which later won second
place after a playoff with Phi Gamma Delta,
scored a 33-26 upset win.

But every other night Phi Kappa was a
smooth functioning machine that ground out
points and more points regardless of the op-
position. When the Phi Kaps had clinched
the fraternity crown by beating Sigma Alpha
Mu, they kept right on rolling to coast
through the playoffs with scarcely a break in
stride. Glenn, husky center, led them to an

easy win over Oil & Gas, engineer leaders, as
he contributed 25 points to their 52-19 tri-
umph. Against Newman Club, ace ﬁve of the
independent division, it was Captain Dick
Cassiano who pushed in 10 points to help
trim the Newmans, 31-20, after the frat
champs had been behind at the half, 13-12.
Then, after the Newmans had dropped a 21-16
verdict over Oil 8; Gas, Phi Kappa put the
ﬁnishing touches on a great season by ﬂatten-
ing the Newmans again, but this time by a
decisive 48-28 margin.

Though not the ﬁnest team ever produced
in Pitt intramural competition, the new cham-
pions were good, very good, and Phi Kap
rushees will probably be hearing for years to
come about the feats of Tommy Halloran, Joe
Connell, Jack Glenn, Dick Cassiano, Joe
Herron, Steve Goodell, Chick Wassell, and
Bob Ryan.

Newman Club had a stiff ﬁght before emerg-
ing with the independent league top honors.
Both the Newmans and the Pitt Club ended
the schedule with seven wins and only one
defeat, necessitating a best—out—of-three play-
off. Snyder had a ﬁeld day in the ﬁrst game
and his 22 points were just half of his team's

total as the Newman’s took a 44-42 battle.
Then, as Tratar and Ruskin ran wild, Pitt
Club evened the series with a 41—36 win. But
with the chips down, Joe Kristufek paced the
Newmans to a 31-26 victory in the deciding
g£lIIlC.

If any one man can make a ball club, then
Joe Kristufek made the Newmans. Although
Snyder, Dunn, and brother Frank Kristufek
had occasional bursts of scoring power, it was
Joe who led the point-making, was a one-man
defense, and worked the ball up the ﬂoor from
his guard position. When Joe was hurt early
in the second half in the ﬁnal game against
the Phi Kaps, the Newmans were deﬁnitely
ﬁnished. Without Joe the supporting cast of
Murray, Czyzewski, Dornenberg, Wyar, and
the three boys previously mentioned would
never have reached the playoffs.

In the engineering league, the Oil 8: Gas
quintet ﬁnished unbeaten with seven success-
ful conquests on its string. With its first ﬁve
made up from the squad of Hendrickson,
Watson, Collins, Smukler, Woodward, Mat-
reson, Leeper, Croker, and Saunders, the Oil-
ets never had a deﬁnite starting team although

After considerable resistance from Pi
Lambda Phi and Phi Epsilon Pi, Delta Tau
Delta took the table tennis title in the fra-
ternity division with a record of 126 games
won and only 18 lost. In the few games
played in the combined engineer-independent
branch, the Medicals took the league lead
and were awarded intramural keys as inde-
pendent winners while the Industrials, ﬁnish-
ing third, still rated the engineer champion-
ship.

Although delayed several weeks by bad
weather, the spring program was no less suc-
cessful than its predecessors. Almost a thou-
sand boys took part in the intramural setup
proper while the freshman sports program
brought the total to about 1500. In the four
sports including mushball, tennis, golf, and
horseshoes, there were one hundred and one
teams entered.

Naturally, mushball had the most adher-
ents, twenty clubs being organized. Tennis,
horseshoes, and golf, in each of which two
man teams were used, ran next in popularity,
tennis drawing thirty-two pairs, horseshoes
twenty-three, and golf twenty-one.

The fraternity league placed ﬁfty—one clubs
in the various sports, while the independents
and the engineers each signed up twenty-ﬁve
outﬁts. The number of entrants from the

 

 

ranks of the non-fraternity men was signifi-
cant, indicating an increased desire upon the
part of those students to participate in intra-

mural sports. The “5 o'clock commuter’s
complex" seemed to be losing its grasp.

As during the fall and winter, a lack of
facilities was a problem. Mushball diamonds
were laid out on Trees Field and on the soccer
practice field behind the gymnasium. A third
playing surface was the football practice
ﬁeld, but it was available only a short time
until spring grid drills started. Two sets of
horseshoe boxes had been built next to the
tennis courts during the fall, and were used
again this spring. The tennis players did their
volleying on the Trees Field courts and the
golfers used the Schenley Park course when
it was free from most of its regular foursomes.

Fitted into the athletic schedule at Pitt is

the program of Freshman Sports for men, de-
signed to give the student instruction and
playing experience in a minimum of six differ-
ent sports during the freshman year. Each
individual is made to select two different
sports (one team and one individual) for each
of the three seasons of the school year. The
fall sports, in order of popularity, are: touch
football, swimming, archery, tennis, and
horseshoes. The winter sports are volleyball,
handball, swimming, badminton, and table
tennis. Mushball, swimming, tennis, golf,
and handball gained favor in the spring
sports. Popularity for the less familiar sports
as handball, badminton, archery, and horse-
shoes has increased much since students have
learned the rules and skills of the sports by
actual participation. Adequate facilities in
Trees gym and the adjoining ﬁelds, plus the
fact that there are at least two instructors for

 

299

I ntmmuml Kabz'n—Hami.r

each class, have also helped popularize Ll}:
men’s Freshman Sports program. One hun-
dred and twent_V—ﬁve more Freshman men than
in 1937-38 were enrolled in these classes this
year.

All students registering for the first time
were required to have a complete medical and
health examination before participating in the
sports program. On the basis of this examina-
tion students were assigned to appropriate
activities or given prescribed work where re-
quired.

James Potts, director of the Division of
Freshman Sports, is assisted by Ollie Stiff in
charge of the oﬂice at Trees Gym, while
"Scottie" handles the equipment room. James
Jackson, Charles Radi, Karl Oermann, and
Dave Ward were added to the athletic staff
of instructors within the past year, providing
capable direction in the various lines of ath-

letic endeavor.

The past year has been a landmark in the
women's athletic history at the University of
Pittsburgh for as the year rolled around they
were blessed with a new gymnasium on the
lower floor of the Cathedral of Learning. No
more long tramps up the hill for classes!
Ofﬁcially dedicated, the gym was thrown
open to any person desiring to use the ﬂoor

tail, the gym has modern dressing rooms,

boards for equipment.

Two other conveniences made available for
women athletes were the swimming pool in
the Y.M.H.A, across from the Cathedral and
the large room on the eighth ﬂoor of the
Cathedral for dancing classes and recreational
sports.

With these facilities, new impetus was
given to the women's athletic program. More
than two-thirds of the incoming freshman
women enrolled for gym work, although the
course is elective. Once registered they were
given the privilege of choosing from hockey,

tennis, swimming and creative dancing for
their class work. As sophomores Pitt women
round out their work with other phases of
these sports.

To juniors who have chosen to become
physical education majors, opportunity is
given to study recreational sports. They learn
to make shuttlecocks ﬂy true, ping—pong balls
bounce, and hand-balls rebound sharply from
the wall, beside maintaining an interest in
basketball and hockey. But that isn't all.
Juniors also learn “what to do and when"

for teaching swimming. Practice teaching
with the juniors occupies much of the seniors
time also.

For those women who prefer to ride a class
is held once each week at Malone's Riding
Academy. Other outdoor recreational sports
are also held here. During the winter season,
sleigh rides, skiing, sled-riding, and tobog-
ganing are popular. In the fall and spring,
hay—rides, riﬂe shooting, and long hikes are
prevalent. Actually Pitt women want for
nothing in their sports program, and the
courses are growing rapidly.

FRESHMAN DANCE

When it comes to new ideas, fresh enthusiasm, abundant energy, we turn to the
Freshman, but the class of '42 outdid previous classes with the Frosh Hop. For two
weeks before December second the school was bombarded with publicity. Red, blue,
green balloons were ﬂoated about in the Commons Room, on the eighth ﬂoor, in
the Tuck Shop. Handbills were passed out at the Fifth Avenue entrance, in classes,
at committee meetings, spreading the news of “two dollars~two ballrooms—two
orchestras!" On the eighth ﬂoor a stand with streamers, balloons, posters, was put
up. Here, the committee kept vigilance, ready to nab anyone that came by. Thurs-
day, the first, arrived and the committee circulated around the Cathedral in costume
and with signs: a pretty girl in jodphurs“"informal"; a Scotchman in kilts——“two
dollars"; a musician in tails, white tie, and top hat—~“two orchestras!" There was
no escape for the upper-Classmcn; the Freshmen wouldn't let them forget December
second and the dance. Friday night most of the school showed up at the Schenley.
Reggie Child's orchestra was in the Main Ballroom, Jack Walton's band in the Con-
tinental Room. The record crowd received giant green and white match folders for
programs and favors (the matches really worked) and waltzed from ballroom to
ballroom from nine till one. The music was great, there was enough room to dance,
that most popular topic of conversation was obligingly cool, and there was a quarter

moon—~so they say. For once advertising did not lead astray, and we don't doubt
that it paid.

THE RUSSIAN ROOM

Designed and built almost entirely by Pittsburghers of

Russian birth and descent, the Russian Room is a seminar

 

classroom. The room was designed by Dr. Andrey '

Avinoff, of the University Fine Arts and Biology depart-

ments .

The most colorful and most interesting part of the room
is the "vishivka" or appliqué embroidery of St. George
and the Dragon made by Mrs. Helen Sikorsky Viner.
The vishivka is symbolic of the spirit of youth going
forth to ﬁght evil. The design was inspired by the Nov-
gorod school of ﬁfteenth and sixteenth century painters.
Together with its carved frame, the banner is called the
kiot or shrine. The frame and the corner cupboard, which
holds the book of donors, are decorated with ornaments

peculiar to Carpatho-Russian art.

The oak conference table is carved in a manner charac-
teristic of the Vologda district in Central Russia, and the
students’ chairs bear tracery carving characteristic of the
furniture in the provinces of Prem and Yaroslav. The
professor's chair bears more complex carving, in a style
following the ancient type from Ouglich in Northeastern
Russia.

In each corner of the white plaster ceiling is a moulded
ﬂower design symbolizing one of the four seasons. These

were modeled by Carl Beato. An early eighteenth century

27

ikon is on the wall high in one corner. The windows are

of decorative glass in a seventeenth century style.

A triptych or double winged cupboard conceals the
chalk—board opposite the vishivka. The double doors are
carved in a manner similar to the professor's armchair
and are lined with red velvet. The purple slate used in
the chalkboard harmonizes with the oak carving, the
white walls, and the traces of red velvet that can be seen
through the grill-like doors. The hand wrought iron

work in the room was done by Hyman Blum.

 

The triptych is surmounted by carved images of
"Sirin" and “Alcanost," the fabulous:twin birds ofjoy
and Sorrow, which are never far apart. All the carving
in the room was done by John Luhowiak, who came to

Pittsburgh from the Russian Ukraine.

SOPH HOP

Bank balances were unusually high at the Soph Hop, for the unique programs
were Checkbooks, and none of them had been drawn upon before the night of this
first big event of the Pitt dance season. "Pay to the order of Wally Hirsch," wrote
Lydia Mae Stern, first lady of the evening, as she made out her first check to “head
man" Wally—all the other escorts accepted their checks and promised to cash them
in immediately—and there were no N .S.F.’s! In return the men presented the ladies
with gold bracelets, favors which the girls were proud to wear. Cares of the day
and worries of tomorrow’s game with Tech slid easily off the Schenley Ballroom ﬂoor
that night when George Hall and his orchestra swung out in easy rhythm and viva-
cious Dolly Dawn poured her melodies into the microphone. This was one of the
first affairs of the year to be hit by the “no—corsage” policy, but occasional bits of
shrubbery sprouted unconcerned wherever they pleased. A galaxy of the new hoop-
skirted gowns marked the dance as a fashion-conscious one, and added a wistful,
quaint touch to the affair. The only decorations necessary were the stars and the full

moon outside the open windows.

Before the dancers knew it, November fourth was over, and November ﬁfth had
rolled round with only one more hour of dancing left for the first formal of the year.
When the dance was over, white ties were not quite so perky and taffetas'and brocades
not quite so smooth, but the idea at the start had been to have a good time, and the
Sophs had certainly put it over. So when top hats and capes were donned and the
couples journeyed to Childs or Gammons no one denied that the entire evening was

3. SUCCCSS.

INTERFRATERNITY YULETIDE FESTIVAL

Who doesn't recall the hushed anxiety in the burnt-orange atmosphere of the
Foster Memorial on that December evening. The fraters of every house on campus
entered with the memories of a last minute sing practice still fresh in mind. Each
man visioned the big Interfraternity Sing Cup on the house mantel and the thunder-
ing ovation accorded a winning sing team. The boys were nervous and their dates
were nervous for them, especially when the Phi Gams got off to a ﬂying start with
their peppy, streamlined version of On 4 Cmmibazl I516. The Phi Delts had no end of
trouble when their placard fell in the midst of the excitement, and "crooner-extra-
ordinary” Curly Stebbins was overcome by the discordant notes of his brothers.
The Sing is long to be remembered but no more so than the Swing that followed.
The first Swing contest to be held at a University dance proved to be the hit of the
year as informality and jitterbugs ran rampant all evening to the strains of jimmy
Earl’s orchestra. Remember the beads of perspiration that formed on Al Young's
forehead as he tried to clear the way for the contesting shaggers? There was plenty
of cause for dispute during this jitterbug contest, but a Kappa Sig "hep—cat" was
ﬁnally announced “the winnah"! Bob Dannies led the affair with Bobbie O'Donnell
on his arm. Chairman Dannies announced the Phi Gams as the winner of the sing
and presented the intermural football cup to the Phi Delts. The Greeks worked
wonders when it came to decorations for the Schenley Ballroom. Evergreens, holly
wreaths, and mistletoe all helped to make the dancers realize that Christmas was
only two weeks away. The Sing and Swing, or Yuletide Festival, really went down
as a high spot during the 38-39 fraternity year.

JUNIOR PROM

It was Friday, the thirteenth. Wet, and snowy, and slushy, and cold; you were
going to the Junior Prom—-remember? Several hours before, you had viewed from
the Cathedral Windows the whirling ﬂakes of white snow, and the thought of the
coming evening ﬁlled your mind with vague apprehension. There would be chains
on automobile tires that crunched against and dug up the hard—laden snow; there
would be wet rubbers and boots piled up in the checkroom at the William Penn;
there would be gaily printed umbrellas held over black velvet hoods and wide Circling
hoop-skirts. Hardly the calm, moonlit evening that you would have liked it to be.
But you forgot the snow and slush outside once you were engulfed by the brightness
of the atmosphere and the liveliness of the music on the seventeenth ﬂoor. You loved
the smooth, restless syncopation of Larry Clinto‘n's orchestra. There, amid dazzling
lights and decorations, was a perfect rhythm band, that favorite of college dances.
The quickening, jungle-like beat of the drums in Sbadmc/9 caught and spread like
wildﬁre among the stomping feet, giving the ballroom the feeling of a native cere-
monial dance. As each note shimmered forth into the air, it was like a harmonious
bubble, pricked by an imaginary pin to give a musical “pop" with an irregular
rhythm. Then beautiful, petite Bea Wain would step up and croon, in her own dis-
tinctive manner, My Heart Belongs to Daddy and My Reverie with a quality of tone
that was as lovely as herself. The Juniors had certainly been '/discriminating in their
choice of music and atmosphere. Amusing caricatures of various campus luminaries
were placed against the balcony railing; they formed a large border-like strip at one
end of the room. From the balcony you would watch the endless gyrating pattern
of color that made the merges of pale pearly shades in the scene below appear as the
inside of a glossy seashell. Among the hundreds gathered around the bandstand you
caught a glimpse of Chairman Emil Naric, squiring the lovely Marian" Woollett.
In her hand, Marian carried the clever dance program in the form of a billfold which
was another unusual feature of this Prom.

Late in the evening, a drowsy lull mingled with the scent of gardenias and orchids,
and the whole affair assumed a dignity and grace which is apart from everyday life.
You left the Junior Prom feeling that you had just been a part of one of the best
dances of the year.

HEART HOP

Soft feminine voices anxiously asking, “Will you be busy:next Friday night?"
Hesitant boys not quite knowing what they should say. That was the week before
the Heart Hop; the week of turned tables in the eternal social whirl. Many a male
heart must have been broken when the night of February 10th ﬁnally brought the
evening of the dance. Not a few of the girls had their ﬁngers crossed as the heavens
opened and water reigned supreme. Hours in time, however, the evening sky cleared
and the dancers descended happily on the Hotel Schenley and its spacious ballroom.
The dancers, one inside, were presented with valentine programs and were greeted
by the queen of hearts, Edith McCormick and George Altman, her escort. In the
ballroom, high above the dancers’ heads revolved little red and white ﬂecks of light

from the large silver ball at the center of the room.

Through all this sounded the Mega-Muted Music of maestro Brad Hunt. Many
of the old favorites found a place in the evenings melodies, while the famed Hunt
version of Dina/a earned an encore. Winning all hearts for the evening, however, was
the former Miss Pennsylvania, Peggy Neenan. Several of the boys sported boutonnieres
in spite of the “no corsage" policy of several of the other dances. The girls managed
the dance quite well in the money—making way and put the men to shame in reim-

bursing their treasury.

INTERFRATERNITY BALL

Color! Color! Harmonizing color; contrasting color; complimentary color. This
was the glamorous Interfraternity Ball. This night of March third the seventeenth
ﬂoor of the William Penn was transformed to reﬂect the sparkling gaiety of the
Greek affair. Pale blue, violet, amber, and green clusters of full-blown balloons,
held in rein by interlocking twisted streamers, hovered about the chandeliers like
huge tinted effervescent bubbles from a glass of champagne ﬂoating through the air.
Late in the evening the balloons drifted down among the dancers and, to those who
watched from the balcony, appeared as bright speckles moving about the ﬂoor.
Blending with these pastel shades was the overspread glow of the soft lights which
were caught in glints on top-knots of shiny curls. The warm color of harmony came
forth under the baton of Artie Shaw and His Swingsters. When jitterbugs responded
enthusiastically to his discordant harmonies, the walls fairly tumbled with rhythm.
Tired feet could not resist the tantalizing music as Artie Shaw's clarinet rolled beauti-
fully down the scale and up again. The famous swing leader had used the unique
idea of individual name placates for the different musicians in the band. The dancers
swung and swayed around the ﬂoor overﬂowing into the lovely Cardinal Room where
the “up and coming” Bill LeRoy's orchestra continued to satisfy the migrating
couples. This year the favors that glittered from the feminine wrists were tiny gold-
linked bracelets with IF inscribed in the small, attached University seal bordered
on each side with the tiny circles of PI and TT. Contrasting and complementary color

. spring tones of blue and red taffeta gowns swishing and brushing amidst frothy
aqua nets and gaily printed silks . . . merging shades interspersed to form a crazy
quilted pattern of color around the ballroom . . . the highly colorful dresses of the
girls contrasted by the rigid black and white tuxes of their lF escorts. Coming di-
rectly from formal rushing parties, many fraternity women and their rushees were
able to enjoy this beautiful IF Ball among the gala affairs of the busy rushing week-
end. After the dance was over, in the elevators and the checkroom, radiant eyes and
ﬂashing smiles expressed the brilliant success of the colorful Interfraternity Ball of
1939.

Sturdy and individual, yet beautiful in its simplicity, the Scottish room
reflects the culture of early seventeenth century Scotland. The traditional
emblem, the thistle, is the dominating motif of decoration. Curtains with
loose yarn embroidery in dull blues and reds frame the bay windows. Stately
carved entrance doors ﬂank the wood-burning ﬁreplace. The oak furniture
and hand-pegged floor are in delightful harmony with the peaceful atmos-
phere and quiet dignity of the Scottish room.

MILITARY BALL

This year’s Military Ball was a modern version of the old Cotillion dances of the
Civil War days. Reminiscent of the lovely belles of the 1860's with their hoop—skirts
and upswept hair—do's, were the charming girls who leaned gracefully on the arms of
their handsome uniformed escorts. But this evening, led by Colonel Al Berger and
Alice _]ahn, the dancers stepped more lively around the ﬂoor than those who curtsied
and bowed in the quadrilles of long ago. Coed Colonel Betty Adams and Howard
Schweppe, joined the thousand couples crowding the main ballroom—black tuxes
and a few severe blue uniforms with gold stripes intermingled with dainty fem-
inine gowns—billows of foamy net and clouds of pale chiffon, heavy clinging satins
and strapless rustling taffetas.

The entire seventeenth ﬂoor of the William Penn Hotel had been reserved to
insure adequate space for dancing, with the well-known Kay Kyser playing in the
main ballroom, Owen Pieper in the Urban Room, Jimmy Earle in the Cardinal Room,
and Joey Sims in the Silver Room. Depicting Springtime, garlands of new leaves
hung in deep scallops from the balcony railing in the main ballroom. Almost be-
neath the decorative balcony, Kay Kyser with his Southern drawl, led his Musical
Kollege orchestra in the turbulent rhythms of modern swing. As quickly as he would
draw], “Yes dance, Chillun," the crowd became restless, escorts flitted here and
there with their partners, weaving in and out, swinging back and forth among vari-
colored patches of dancers. In the smoother songs, Kay Kyser's muted trumpet
spurred out smoothly, like a fountain, as he hit and dived easily over each note.
Many couples on the balcony were content to listen to the sweet tones of lovely
Ginny Sim's voice, to the high tenor voice of Harry Babbitt, of singing song—titlefame,
and to Sully Mason, whose antics put the crowd in a jolly mood. Looking down on
the ﬂuctuaring crowd, one saw the scintillation of the tiny gold squares inscribed
with the military insignia, the Military Ball favors that adorned each feminine
neck, twinkle as ﬁxed stars when caught in a soft ﬂood of light.

This year Scabbard and Blade, honorary military fraternity, gave its ﬁrst public
tapping ceremony at the Military Ball in a very militaristic fashion. At midnight,
in the main ballroom, the ten men from the advanced corps were formally tapped as
each sedately walked under the arch of majestically crossed swords~——a very impressive
ceremony. As the gay throng dispersed at the close of the evening, the breathless
joy of happiness and the tinkle of the mirthful laughter rippled among these modern
Cotillion dancers of 1939.

PANHELLENIC BALL

In a background of charm and dignity, the Panhellenic Ball was impressive for
its striking simplicity. Pitt fraternity women chose the formal black, white, and
gold of the Urban Room at the William Penn for its basic color scheme. Chairman

t Ruth Custer, who led the Grand March with Sam Werlinich, keynoted the color
scheme in white marquisette and black lace in combination with her escort's white
ties and tails. It was April, and the air held the warm fragrance of a spring night.
It was the first real spring dance of the season, and fraternity girls blossomed forth
in a colorful array of refreshing pastels. The multitudinous color combinations
reﬂected soft splashes of color in the highly polished onyx panels of the walls, so
that each panel was a living painting framed in gold. This reﬂection of color, to-
gether with a profusion of banked ferns, was the only decoration needed to adorn
the simplicity of the black and gold walls. Even the music was in the keeping with
the simple charm of the surrounding. Tommy Tucker's orchestra with its “Tick-
Tock" rhythm ﬁlled the ballroom with a warm blending of harmonious notes.
Friendly smiles were exchanged over broad black shoulders as one Greek—letter
woman nodded to another in passing. Between dances, couples studied their black
and gold celluloid programs to ﬁnd the name of their next partner. At this ball,
the boys gloried in the favorsathe latest in men’s evening jewelry, gold inter-
meshed key chains. In the lobby and elevator, Panhel escorts expressed admiration
for this gala affair which the fraternity women of the University had so successfully

led—the Panhellenic Ball of 1939.

SENIOR BALL

Setting a precedent and leaving his stuffy labs at the School of Mines, chairman
Victor Gallagher waved his magic wand and somehow mixed the right things to-
gether to produce the nicest Senior Ball in years. Behind us as a perfect background
were the memories of the gay activities of Spring Festival week—~the parade, tea
dance, and Carnival Night. Then, still in the festive mood, our fun was rounded
out by the happy combination of Will Osborne and his “sliding trombones," who
recently played an engagement at New York's Cocoanut Grove. As a special feature
Vic and business manager Bill Matthias chose the biggest ballroom from New York

to Chicago, the newly remodeled hall in the Syria Mosque.

Added to this was the spring-like atmosphere which lingered everywhere from
the tropical palms surrounding the bandstand to the farthest nook and corner. White-
coated men with lovely ladies in the ﬁlmiest of formals glided past and drifted lightly
back and forth to the rhythmic lilt of the music. We pointed with pride to Vic and

lovely blonde, blue-eyed Mary Jane Gross as well as to Bill with attractive Jane Bell.

Soon we discovered that another attraction had been added to the already delight-
ful concoction of springtime, catchy rhythms and pastel colors which was Pitt's
one and only warm weather prom. Gold dress clips adorned with the Pitt seal were

our favors, a unique reminder of a never-to-be-forgotten evening.

THE SCOTTISH ROOM

“Once upon a time," says Scottish history, “the King‘

was rescued from brigands by an aide who drove off the
robbers and washed the king's wounds. Ever since then,
the lineal male descendant of this illustrious Scotch
family has always attended the king upon his arrival in
Scotland with the towel and basin of clear water, sym-
bolic of his family's service to the crown." The keeper
of this custom today is the architect of the Scottish

Room.

Reginald Fairlie of Edinburgh has designed the Scot-
tish Room in early seventeenth century style. He has
chosen this period because it is the one in which Scotland

was the least affected by the outside world.

As one looks about the room he is impressed by the
way in which the culture of Scotland is reflected in every
detail. The plaster frieze is adapted from Elcho Castle
in Perthshire and includes the symbols of each of the
Scottish clans which have sponsored this classroom. In
the upper sashes of the bay windows are leaded medal-
lions of the coats-of-arms of the four Scottish Univer-
sities: Edinburgh, Glasgow, St. Andrews, and Aberdeen;
while in the side windows Melrose and Elgin Abbeys
are represented. The carving on the entrance doors dupli-
cates the door of Rowallan Castle in Ayrshire. They

were done by a famous Scottish vvoodcarver, Thomas

Good. He has also handsomely carved the cabinet doors

which swing back to reveal the blackboard. The cabinet
work was done in the shop of Gustav Ketterer, Phila-

delphia. Above the wood-burning ﬁreplace hangs a por-

trait of Robert Burns, painted under the direction of
Stanley A. Cursiter, Keeper of the National Portrait

Gallery of Scotland.

We push our Way through the stadium crowd . . . and traipse down the steps

of the old Heinz House . . . or practice up for the intramural touch-football games

and if worthy, we are tapped to ODK as Juniors or Seniors . . . we stand by

as the pre-meds capture the Freshman Camp "trophy" . . . we are presented with a

merit panther . . . and enjoy the frolics of the Panther between plays . . . or
usher in the intramural season with a lavish banquet.

FRIENDSHIP
EVALUATED

   

UPON GRADUATION the young man or woman enters a
‘ l new and challenging existence—a business life,studded with
problems and keen with competition. Then, more than ever before, the
real value of friendship is realized.

What two qualities offrz'enz1Jhz'p——u/hether permnal or hnJz'ne.rJ——
are more important than that the FRIEND he reliable and that the FRIEND
he nearby when needed?

These two qualities you will find characteristic of the Weszing—
house Company. Reliable, because of the vast experience in electrical
manufacture through more than a half—century of research and progressive
development; always near by, because of its world-wide network of sales
offices and service points-—do further away than your telephone!

Learn early of Westinghouse friendship and let that friendship
beneﬁt you.

CONTINUOUS CARE

N a report of the trustees of the Carnegie Corporation
is this statement:

"The funds of a great endowment can be kept intact only by a
systematic revision month by month of all the securities of the
endowment and by a continuous process of sale and exchange
as circumstances may affect the ﬁnancial soundness of this or
that security. ” T

This same practical plan is applied here in handling
estates left in trust. Only by this constant vigilance
can a trustee fulﬁll all its obligation to conserve and
increase estates.

Impressions and symbols of tranquillity and happiness are strikingly
expressed by the gaily, richly decorative paintings in the Swedish nationality
room. The ceiling is broken into three panels embellished in blue, white,
orange, and yellow flowers, with kings and maidens holding objects of peace.
The back wall has four drawings representing St. Catherine and the Three
Wise Men; in the center of the orange colored door is a painting of a vase
of tulips; the ﬂoor is red brick; and against a side wall is a chimney.

THE SWEDISH ROOM

In material, design, and furniture, the Swedish room.

is characteristic of Swedish art with its structural sim-

plicity combined with rich but delicate feeling for color
and decorative effects. The classroom possesses an at-
mosphere of freshness, peace, and gay life; and the blend-
ing of colors in the paintings seem to have a perfect ar-

rangement in respect to the furniture.

The wooden ceiling is highly decorated with tulips
and blue, white, orange, and yellow ﬂowers which
adorn maiden queens. The walls, of two—hundred—_Vear-
old brick, are covered with twenty coats of whitewash.
The special glory of the room is the rear wall with its
fresco-secco panels. In rich ﬂoral ornament, the four
panels depict St. Catherine and gay cavaliers riding out
into the world. The inspiration for these pictures came
from painted panels which were found in the Nordeske
Museum by Mr. Linton Wilson, the architect and an
outstanding authority on Swedish art and design. These
paintings “uniquely Swedish, strong, dignified, and still
colorful and gay, with a dash of sparkling humor," were
done by a soldier in the army of Charles XII known as
Gustav Renter who returned to his native province of
Halsingland and founded a school of painting and deco-
ration which ﬂourished during the early eighteenth cen-
tury around the shores of Lake Dellen.

Opposite the ﬂower-ﬁlled windows is ‘a fireplace of
traditional Swedish design. On each side of the ﬁreplace
the red ﬁr Wainscot supports a bench which extends

across the end of the room. These benches are typical

31

of Swedish rooms which serve as a meeting place for

"festal or solemn occasions.

The red brick floor is waxed and polished. A vase
overﬂowing with tulips decorates the center of the
orange colored door. The handle and lock are of hand-
wrought brass. The student tablet arm-chairs, the pro-
fessor's chair and table, all of sturdy oak, are stained a

soft slate blue.

 

Linton Wilson had the help and advice of Carl Milles,

Sweden's world famous sculptor, whose studio is now at

the Cranbrook School near Detroit. The ceiling and
walls were painted by Olle Nordmark, whose works in
fresco are known throughout Europe. The woodwork
and furniture were constructed by Erik Janssen of Phila-

delphia.

The Yugoslav room is characterized by its solemnity. The walls are
wainscoted in Slavonian oak and four wooden chandeliers cast shadows on
the intricate wooden ceiling carved with Croatian, Slavonian, and Serbian
folk motifs. Color is brought into the room by the addition of a bright red

and black Kilam rug in the bay window and the portraits of six great Yugo-
slav personalities.

THE YUGOSLAV ROOM

Modeled after the most precious historical monuments
of Yugoslavia—the old wooden churches——the Yugoslav
Room expresses a quiet dignity with its wealth of native
carving. It was designed by Professor Votja Branis,
director of the Industrial Art School in Zagreb, who was
sent to America to supervise the construction.

The wooden ceiling and wainscoting are of Slavenian
oak and are carved with geometric figures and an old
Slavenian heart motif. Along the corridor wall are the
coats of arms of the Universities of Belgrade, Zagreb, and
Ljubljana. The natural grain of the unﬁnished wood in
the furniture is carved with decorative national patterns
which stand out in relief.

A parquet ﬂoor, laid in squares of different’ kinds of
wood, completes the harmony of the paneled interior.

The Yugoslav government, besides sending Professor
Branis to Pittsburgh, has shown great interest in the
room. Gifts of books, rugs, and embroideries as well as
a generous cash contribution were received.

Several other gifts were donated to the room. Dr.
Michael Pupin, world renowned Yugoslav-American
inventor and scientist, gave two of the six portraits in

the room. They were portraits of Petar Petrovic N jegos,

33

‘*.»~...,

the last Prince of Montenegro, and Vuk Stefanovic
Karadzic, scholar, painted by the late Uros Predic of
Belgrade. Ivan Mestrovic, one of the greatest of living
sculptors, presented two bronze busts and also the por-

traits of Bishop Josip J. Strossmayer, statesman, and

 

Rugjer Boskovic, mathematician, who represent the
Croatians. France Preseren, a poet, and Baron George
von Vega, mathematician, are the subjects for the
Slovenian portraits presented by a committee from
Ljubljana,

THE CHINESE ROOM

Designed to express the highest goals of Chinese life,
the Chinese Room is the work of Henry Killam Murphy,
architectural adviser to the nationalist government, and
of Teng Kwei, Chinese artist. The main feature of the
room is the large tablet of soft green slate set in a
small alcove at the end of the room. In this is carved in
quaint Chinese fashion a likeness of the learned and
revered Confucius. Carved quotations from the teach-
ings of Confucius frame the sides of this relief.

Activity in the seminar will center about the “moon"

table, circular in shape, of dark-stained vermillion wood,

which is a gift of the On Leong Merchant's Association.

It especially expresses the thoughts that the architect
wishes to convey, for in the center panel of each of the
chairs which surround the table is a carved Chinese char-
acter, each one standing for one of the twelve essential
qualities of a learned Chinese gentleman: good manners,
love of music, leadership, expertness in archery, love of
knowledge, mathematical ability, integrity, and ability
to adjust, to cultivate, to regulate, to govern, and to
tranquilize.

In bright contrast to the dark furniture and the dull-
ness of the gray stone ﬂoor, the colored ceiling impresses
us immediately with its brilliance. Supported by the
corner columns of Chinese red color, the ceiling is of
striking and multicolored design, while the beams are

ornamented with painted Chinese dragons.

In every way, the best of old Chinese art is incorpo-
rated into a modern classroom. Paintings and carvings
were made under the direction of Henry Killiam Murphy,
the American architect who was the first to adapt Chinese
architecture of ages past for use in modern Chinese Build-
ings. Recreating Chinese culture all the way from Old
Cathay to the modern Republic, the Chinese room is
intended to be a constant inspiration to all scholars who

aim for the highest and best.

THE FRENCH ROOM

The French room has been planned by the distinguished
French architect, Jacques Carlu, director of the school of

architecture at Fontainebleau, France. The richness and

simplicity of the Empire period of 1810 is carried out in -

green and gold design.

According to present plans, walls are painted a soft
green. The Parquet ﬂoor is patterned after a palace ﬂoor
at Versailles. If we follow the green and gold columns
to the ivory-colored ceiling, we see a central chandelier
of bronze and crystal with parchment shades. Dark
green velvet curtains with gold fringes set off the win-
dows, which, in keeping with the style of the period are
clear and plain. The radiator is enclosed in green painted
wooden grille and all of the furniture is solid mahogany

enriched with bronze ornaments. Chairs upholstered in

Mitchell, Dr. W. Shelton, Mrs. Donald
Clark, Hon. Louis C. Celestin.

thick green leather are decorated with bronze nails. The
cabinet will hold gifts, porcelain, and other examples of
fine French work. The blackboard is of the concealed

V sliding type; the board is not black slate, however, but

green to harmonize with the coloring of the room.
Oﬁcial sponsoring by the French government insures
the authenticity of the design of this room which fur-
nishes an ideal setting for undergraduate and graduate
classes in French. “The beauty of the French room in
particular" says the designer, “will depend on the dec-
orator. We must select one of great skill, one who will
obtain the subtle coloring that will be necessary for that
ﬁnesse of ﬁnish which will characterize the French

room."

THE GREEK ROOM

Suggesting a classical Greek temple, the Greek room
might easily be a duplicate of one in which Socrates or
Plato taught.

Designed by a young Athenian classicist, John Travlos,
in association with a group of the foremost authorities
in the ﬁeld of Greek archeology, this room achieves its
beauty from exact proportion, symmetry of arrangement,
and the skillful use of marble columns.

The floor of the main room is covered with white

rectangular marble slabs with a margin of bluish gray
Kokinara marble. Pure white Ionic columns support
the coffered ceiling of plaster. The wainscot, of marble,
terminates in a border decorated with a painted spiral
meander.

In deﬁnite contrast to the austerity of the white marble
are the rose-colored plaster walls which bring warmth
to the classroom. Further color is given to the room by
the addition of a frieze below the ceiling adopted from
"The Porch of Maidens" on the Erecthium, the temple
of the protecting deities of Athens situated on the
Acropolis. The rosette pattern of the marble frame in
which the bronze door swings also comes from the most
famous of Greek temples.

Furnishings are all ﬁne examples of classical art. The
oak seminar table and chairs are beautiful in typical
Ionic simplicity inlaid with ebony. A cabinet contain-
ing reproductions of Greek vases unearthed in recent
archeological ﬁnds and promised by the Greek govern-
ment will be placed in the alcove.

Arrangements have been made for the marble to be
quarried and worked in Greece by Greek artisans who
have inherited their knowledge of stone cutting from

generations past.

THE ITALIAN ROOM

Reviving the magniﬁcence and splendor of the return
to classic style during the Renaissance, the design of the
Italian Room reveals the spirit of ’ this period when
Italian art inspired the whole of Europe. The entire
room is permeated by the grandeur of art that is reminis-
cent of the unsurpassed dome of St. Peter's and the white
marble of the Milan Cathedral, of the decorative work
in the Pitti Palace, and the excellence of painting in
daVinci’s Mom: Lira.

Delicate carving outlines the walnut paneling that
rises halfway to the ceiling and takes on the form of an
armadio or vestment closet at one end of the room. The
carved doors of the armadio open to reveal a blackboard-
Above the walnut paneling, against the parchment col-
ored plaster of the walls, hangs a painting of Helena
Cornaro Piscopia, the first woman to receive a doctor's
degree from a university. This talented Venetian poetess
lived in the sixteenth century and attended the Univer-
sity of Padua.

Underneath the bay windows that overlook the ter-
race before the Stephen Foster Memorial, supplementary
seats are arranged on a platform; a ﬁfteenth century choir
stall inspired the designer, Lorenzo Romanelli, of Flor-
ence. Over each seat, in olive wood inlay, appears the
name of one of the great personalities that Italy has
given the world. The Venetian glass windows bear coats
of arms of the six oldest Italian universities.

The two long tables with leather-backed chairs can be
arranged to center around the ﬁreplace of blue sandstone,
which is ﬂanked by wrought-iron “torcheres" and two
Savonarola chairs upholstered in red velvet. A bronze
bust of Dante stands in the chimney niche above. The
dome-shaped paintings over the carved entrance doors
are fresh in their blue—green coloring. One depicts St.
Francis and the Birds, symbolizing Humanity, the other
portrays Leonardo daVinci and the Birds, symbolizing
Science.

THE LITHUANIAN ROOM

Similar to the other nationality classrooms in that it
suggests the culture of the country it typiﬁes, yet unique
in its own delightful way, the Lithuanian room was de-
signed by Antanas Gudaitis of Kaunas, the capital city.

Linen of soft greenish-gray which has been dipped in
oak—bark solution will cover the walls above the three-
foot Wainscot of white oak. Representing the art for
which the Lithuanian women are so famous, this wall-
covering will be hand woven in Lithuania and will be

of the Birds," a design depicting the path of the birds
in the heavens as they fly south.

Dark, bog-soaked oak, from logs which have been
under water for one hundred years preserved at the bot-
tom of the Niemen River is used in contrast to white
oak in cabinet work. The door will be studded with
bright copper nails and surmounted by two carved
horse's heads incorporated into the design of the wooden
door-frame. Geometrical strips of alternating light and
dark oak contrast to form the cornice between the wall
and plaster ceiling of greenish—gray color while dark
oak is used as a footing for the column-like sections of
the walls and the top of the radiator enclosure.

A rosette pattern is featured throughout the room.
This can be seen in the ornamental wood carving around
the four small lamps in the ceiling, as well as in the sun
ornament in the leaded glass windows, and in the carv-
ing on the white oak chairs which duplicate typical
Lithuanian furniture.

‘Dedicated to the great men of Lithuania whose names
will be carved on the copper-hinged cabinet doors, the
Lithuanian room is a pleasant reminder of the tiny coun-

try on the shores of the Baltic Sea.

THE POLISH ROOM

The Polish Room is designed in the style of the Royal
Castle, Wawel. Since the room serves not only as a re-
minder of the contribution of Polish. culture, but also as
a practical classroom for teaching astronomy, Polish
history, literature, the committee's first concern was to
design it so as to create an atmosphere of dignity and
beauty which characterized the universities in the four-
teenth and ﬁfteenth centuries. The room is named in
honor of the great astronomer, Copernicus.

The most striking note in the room is the artistic ceil-
ing, copied after the beautiful and world-famous Wawel
Castle. An exact replica of the famous Globus ]agiel-
lonicus, used by Copernicus in the sixteenth century and

still standing in the library in Cracow, is placed in the

bay window of the classroom to symbolize the contribu-

tions that Poland has made to science. A bronze chan-

delier hangs from the ceiling in a direct axis between the

window and the handsome carved Gothic entrance door.
The furniture is designed similar in style to that used in
the Wawel Castle during the fifteenth and sixteenth
centuries. The students’ armchairs and the professor's
table and chair are of old walnut. Two shades of oak
are used in the parquet ﬂoor. Beneath the beamed poly-
chromed ceiling, against the simple oak wainscoting,
a large blackboard hangs on the front wall for the lec-
turer. Paintings and framed manuscripts indicative of

Poland’s contributions to literature, art, and music com-

plete the decoration of the room.

 

THE RUMANIAN ROOM

Medieval in theme, the Roumanian Room reﬂects
the style and rich color of Byzantine art. The room,
patterned after the interior of an old Roumanian church,
is decorative yet substantial in design.

Fashioned after the sculptured entrance at Horoz, the
doorway which frames the heavy double oak doors is of
intricately carved limestone. From either side of the
doorway, dark oak panels divided into sections by carved

twisted columns encircle the room. At one end the five

sections of the paneling supports the portraits painted
on copper of five great leaders in Roumanian history-
Inparatul Traian, Stefan cel Mare, Mihai Viteazul,
Dimitrie Cantemir, and Mihail Eminescu. The pictures
are made of copper to insure permanence and are done in
oil on a gold base. Below the pictures are engraved the
names with the dates of birth and death.

In keeping with the theme of the room, both the chairs
and the professor's table are decorative yet sturdy. The
high—backed master's chair is a copy of the carved chair
that belonged to Prince Lapusneanu. The student chairs,
on the other hand, are ornamented with motifs taken
from the rosette border in the paneling. Concealed be-
hind the panels at the other end of the room is a long
blackboard. In contrast to the ornate wood, the upper
walls and ceiling are of white plaster.

When Horoz monastery, a famed place of learning
known as "the place of the owls," was completed in
1690 under the patronage of Prince Brancoveanu, the
names of the architects were preserved in stone. Like-
wise the name of the designer, Professor N. Ghica-
Budesti, a noted writer on Roumanian art, who planned
the Roumanian room to symbolize the inscription above
the doorway—"For the Roumanians, National coopera-
tion through Education”—appears engraved in a corner

of the room.

THE SYRIA—LEBANON ROOM

The Syrian-Lebanon room, according to its designers
promises to be a “jewel box," the results of an art that

ﬂourished under contentment of mind, that ﬂourished

among a people who had no regard for the amount of '

time required to achieve perfect ﬁnesse of color and detail,

The room is a conference room for the use of the faculty
and the administrative members who prefer to meet call-
ers on the first ﬂoor. Low benches with deep cushions,
a practical modiﬁcation of the Syrian custom of sitting
on the ﬂoor, are the chief pieces of furniture.

The decorations on the wall and ceiling are richly

painted in the Gesso style, in which a putty mixture is
used to make a semi-relief of the picture to which the
colors are added. This gives an appearance of depth and
perspective to the painting. Another typical Syrian-
Lebanon feature is the oriental rug covering a stone ﬂoor.

The Syrian-Lebanon room has been placed by the light
court in order to preserve the characteristic appearance of
the native rooms, which always open onto a central court.
Admission to the room is through the Reception Office
which is located opposite the Commons Room on the

first floor.

Not included as one of the Nationality Rooms series,
but a part of the original plan to have each room of the
Cathedral represent some phase of the forces in present
day Western Pennsylvania culture and education, the
Early American Room on the third ﬂoor is an example
of the practical use of museum pieces. For every detail
of this room is authentic and much of the lumber, iron,
bricks, and glass is over a century old.

The restoration is an example of the kitchen-living
room of the mid-seventeenth century pioneer home. Old
pine beams support the ceiling. Bricks used in the ﬁre-
place are old and hand-made, irregular in color and
shape. Window panes of cloudy diamond shaped glass
are fastened together to form authentic windows. Hand-
wrought iron is used for the window frames and hard-

ware. The entrance door is of thick substantial pine,
studded on the outside with cone-headed wrought iron
nails.

The Early American Room really consists of two
rooms. Beside the ﬁreplace is a wood closet, which has
a brick wall on the side next to the hearth. This wall
moves to reveal the passageway which goes over the
hearth into a room above the kitchen—living room. This
room is used as an oﬂice for the instructors who hold
seminar classes about the table in the lower room.

The Early American room was built in honor of Dr.
George Clapp, president of the board of trustees. The
room is symbolic of a period, the Early American, in
which he is personally very much interested.

Mrs. Ruth Crawford Mitchell, having been around the
world twice and having travelled extensively in foreign
countries, is well adapted to be the University adviser

on Nationality Rooms. Mrs. Mitchell has assisted the

seventeen committees throughout all stages of their ac-,.

tivities from the organization, through the construction,
to the dedication and presentation to the University.
Her work with the Foreign Language Information Serv-
ice has also contributed to her preparation.

Mrs. Mitchell was director of the Social Survey of
Prague. It was for this later work that she was decorated
with the Czechoslovak Order of the White Lion by Presi-
dent Thomas G. Masaryk in 1920. In 1925 Mrs. Mitchell
came to the University where she was a lecturer in the

to the United States. Dr. Bowman in 1925 asked her to

assist in a study of the nativity of the students at the
University, which work later lead to the allotment of
Nationality rooms in the Cathedral.

Her work as adviser has really been a momentous
task. Besides understanding the problems of each sepa-

rate nationality, Mrs. Mitchell has had to act as a co-
ordinating power between the committee and the archi-

tect, contractor, governments, and the University.

Assisting Mrs. Mitchell has been Mrs. Beatrice Smith
Doty, who achieved her A.B. in education here in 1931.
It has been Mrs. Doty who has cheerfully handled many
of the routine arrangements for the nationality rooms,
treated their minor problems, and acted in Mrs. Mit-

chell's capacity when the latter was busy elsewhere.

Mr. Albert Klimchek, the University architect, de-
serves much of the credit for the beauty and balance of
the nationality rooms. He came to the University from
the oﬂice of Charles Klauderer, the designer of the Frick

Acres buildings, and has been active in Cathedral con-
struction since the beginning. Mr. Klimchek believes

that the Nationality rooms “are an experience that no
architect in this country or elsewhere can buy or obtain
by searching for it, because only here, at the University
of Pittsburgh, is there a completeness of European cul-

tural representation.”

JOHN G. BOWMAN,
Chancellor of the University

A university that will bring the qualities of excellence,
spirituality, and beauty into the student life at Pitt has
been the goal and life-long desire of Dr. John G. Bowman.
As Chancellor of the University, Dr. Bowman has
watched his plans gradually materialize. He has seen
the Cathedral become a reality and a challenge to all
leaders of progressive education.

This year Dr. Bowman has been a proud participant in
the culmination of his most esthetic plans—the dedica-
tion of the nationality rooms, a symbol of the completion
of the unifying inspirational elements of the Cathedral

46

of Learning. This together with the oﬂicial dedication
of Heinz Chapel has fulﬁlled an ambitious year for the
Chancellor—-a year marked by advancement in education
and spiritual growth.

The inauguration of a series of ﬁre-side chats was the
principal means by which Dr. Bowman this year estab-
lished a closer contact with the undergraduates. He met
with the students periodically before the ﬁre-place in his
oﬂicc. There he discussed problems of the University;
and there he gave and sought advice.

JOHN WEBER,
fecretary of flat L/l7zz'1xer.rz'Iyy

Known as the busiest man in the Univer-
sity, Dr. John Weber can be found in his oﬂice
behind the gray-brown oak door of 106 Cathe-
dral—there he warmly welcomes friends and
visitors—there the brusque but congenial doc-
tor of science and engineer de-luxe serves his
University as its Secretary.

Since graduation, Mr. Weber has had an
admirable rise in the mechanical engineering
department of the University. Beginning as
an assistant professor in 1913, he became an
associate professor in 1917, and in 1925
reached the heights of full professorship and
head of the department.

One of Mr. Weber’s most admirable ac-
complishments has been his role in selecting
the famous stained glass windows of the
Heinz Chapel. To prepare himself for the
task, he traveled in the United States and
Europe studying and examining this type of
window—thus gradually becoming an expert
in one more ﬁeld.

RUFUS F. FITZGERALD,
Prawn of flat U7zz'12emz'z‘y

Working quietly and accomplishing much
seems to be the prime characteristics of Mr.
Fitzgerald, Provost of the University.

The work of the Provost is the least pub-
licized and perhaps the least known by the
great majority of the students of any of the
administrative officers; but few men touch
and affect the activities of the students as does
Mr. Fitzgerald.

To him come the deans of the schools, the
members of the faculty, the undergraduate
campus leaders with their problems of sched-
uling of classes, improving of publications,
sponsoring of new activities and organiza-
tions, computing relative accomplishments of
departments, and increasing faculty'—student
cooperation.

He investigates and gives suggestions. Soft-
spoken and sincere, meticulous and consci-
entious, Mr. Fitzgerald irons out the prob-
lems, and University work and activities roll
ahead.

OFFICE OF
DEAN OF WOMEN

Gradually the activities of the women have moved
down from Heinz House, and the teas and meetings,
luncheons and gatherings have become centered in the
attractive oﬂices of the twelfth ﬂoor. Gone are the days
of traipsing up Alumni Hill to reach the Heinz House.
New freshwomen need only press a button, hop on an
elevator, ride up twelve ﬂoors, and walk out into the
comfortable and pleasing atmosphere of the Dean of
Women's oﬂice. It is on this ﬂoor, over a cup of tea, that
the women of the University become acquainted with the

activities of the University, academic and otherwise. It

_ is here that they become personally acquainted with Dean

Amos and her staff.

From the time the freshman enters Pitt until her

' graduation, Dean Thyrsa W. Amos is interested in devel-

_ "oping her character and orienting her to college life. It

is Miss Amos’ plan that by personal guidance each girl

A receives the opportunity to round out her personality

50

THYRSA W. AMOS
Dam of Women

and to gain the poise that she should get from her four
years at the University. Through her wide experiences
in the work, and from the training that she received at
the University of Kansas, and more especially at Colum-
bia University, Miss Amos has come to be recognized
throughout her profession for her ability and originality
in developing new ways of aiding the women to gain the
most from their college careers. In recent years she has
originated at the University of Pittsburgh a mentor
system of orienting freshman women to Pitt life and
traditions. Under this system, senior women are trained
by Dean Amos and her staff in the art of introducing new
women to college life, of helping them select activities,
and of advising them on all those little points of etiquette

and conduct that are necessary for success.

Miss Helen Pool Rush and Miss Mary Frances Mc-
Laughlin complete the staﬁ" of the Dean of Women.

“Miss Rush, I'm a committee chairman, what should I

OFFICE OF DEAN OF WOMEN

do?" "Miss Rush, what activity should I join?" These
are the type of questions with which Miss Rush is bom-
barded. She is in charge of all extra-curricular activities
and of the activities point scale. During her six weeks
absence in the spring, the twelfth ﬂoor was the scene of

much confusion as activities women sought in vain for
her guidance. It is her enthusiasm, her own joy of living,__

that cheers the girls when they are blue. Her kind words
and advice are largely responsible for the girls enjoying
their work at Pitt.

Miss McLaughlin has the all-important work of pro-
viding part—time and permanent employment for the
women. She also takes care of the out-of—town girls by
ﬁnding suitable housing for them on campus. Miss Mc—
Laughlin’s efficient handling of these responsible duties

has made it easier for many women to complete their

 

University education, purposefully.
In charge of the secretarial work of the office are those HELEN POOL RUSH
two popular receptionists, Miss Jane Scott and Miss A5~”3’”’1’ D9“ of W””“’”
Grace Quil. Miss Quil left the staff this spring to get

married and has been replaced by Miss Kaye Strum.
There is little wonder, then, with such a capable and
sympathetic staff of advisers, that the favorite phrase of

all Pitt women is "Twelfth ﬂoor, please."

OFFICE OF
DEAN OF MEN

Without a doubt the most popular elevator stop in the
Cathedral is the eighth ﬂoor; for on this ﬂoor is the Dean
of Men's ofﬁce, known as 809, the focal point of the
majority of campus activities. Here Dr. Vincent W.
Lanfear and his assistants meet with the boys, plan and
improve campus conditions, solve housing problems, and
help to secure employment.

In the modern cycle of ﬁreside chats and courts of
domestic relations, the University is represented by Dr.
Lanfear who holds open-house for all Pitt males. His
role is that of a sympathetic and kindly counsellor to the
many who daily trek to his office to unload problems
ranging from class and course entanglements to home
diﬂiculties. He modestly confesses that at times he is
even called upon for advice on affairs of the heart. Dr.
Lanfear has built up a strong and close contact with the
students despite the assertion that such a condition is
characteristic only of small-town campus schools. Next
to “talking things over with the boys" he rates the
democratic sport of ﬁshing as his favorite pastime; but
his association with the boys really becomes a pastime
if pleasure derived is to by the deﬁning element.

Mr. Theodore Biddle, in point of service, is the senior

52

VINCENT W. LANFEAR

Dam of Mm

member among Dr. Lanfear's assistants. Upon his gradu-
ation from the University’s School of Business Adminis-
tration in 1929, he secured his present position. The only
interruption he has had since then has been the rather
constant moving from ofﬁce to oﬂice. Generally speak-
ing, Mr. Biddle is responsible for all student activities,
the graduate managership of the Cap and Gown Club
being the largest single undertaking. Their considera-
tion of him as one of them is a fair indication of the stu-
dents’ attitude and respect for “Ted." That he is relied
upon by the students is best expressed by the campus
catch line, "When in doubt, see Biddle.”

When fraternity men need help or advice, or when they
just want to talk to someone, they head for the oﬂice of
Robert Corley. Mr. Corley is always glad to see them.
As general overseer of social and honorary fraternities,
Mt. Corley has a job that keep his hands full. This year
he introduced a class in parliamentary procedure for the
presidents of all fraternities, clubs, and other groups.
Another ofﬁcial duty which occupies much of his time
is the housing of Pitt men. Although his undergraduate
work was done at Bethany, Mr. Corley was a Pitt gradu-
ate-student from 1932 to 1934, during which period he

became well enough acquainted with the problems:of the
men at the University to become an assistant to the Dean
of Men.

Getting a job has been an acute matter for University
students in the past few years, and Mr. Edward Williams
is the man who helps them find positions. A Pitt gradu-
ate of 1931, l\/Ir. Williams had experience in market sur-
veys and business research before returning to Pitt in his
present capacity in October of 1937. Genuinely inter-
ested in the students, his pet project is a plan, as yet in-
complete, to have the leading business men and employ-
ers come to the University and speak to Pitt men on what
is desired of them in modern business. His work at the
present time includes the placement of graduates and sen-
ior men and the part time placement of undergraduates.
His good—natured attitude toward everyone has enabled
him to make friends easily and, although only in his
second year as an assistant in the Dean of Men's office,

his jovial face is well—l<nown to most Pitt men. _

Around the corner from 809 is another rea-
son for the whirl of activity on the eighth
floor—~the oﬂice of Bill Mendenhall, executive
secretary of the University Y.M.C.A. Al-
though their offices are separate, Bill is al-
ways considered part of the Dean of Men's
staff; for his work is basically the same of the
Dean’s assistants, that of being an adviser to
the students. Mr. Mendenhall has spent many
years in student work, having held the posi-
tion of general student secretary of the Y.M.
CA. in the Midwest. His most important
and valuable work has been the conducting
of the Y program and student projects in the
field of religious activity.

Each year as more and more ofﬁces and classes are
moved into the Cathedral of Learning, as it is gradually
completed, Pitt students become more and more aware
of the size of the vast Pitt family. As in previous years,
the enrollment of the Pittsburgh units of the University
have an increase as reported by registrar]. G. Quick
early in the year of 425 students, bringing the total to

9100. These ﬁgures are to the exclusion of the extension

schools in Erie and Johnstown.

At the University this expansion was emphasized by
the addition of an eighteenth division, the School of
Applied Social Sciences. Under the heading, of the
S.A.S.S., the University offers some ﬁfty or more courses,

among which are public welfare administration, pro-

_visions for unemployment relief, family adjustment,

society and the child, social statistics, social work and
the courts, juvenile delinquency, psychiatry and medical
aspects of social work. The school, an outgrowth of the
Division of Social Work, has been placed under the
capable direction of Dr. Wilber I. Newstetter, formerly
of Western Reserve University and president of the
American Association of Schools of Social Work.
Several other new courses have been offered this year
in the undergraduate schools that have attracted much

attention. Under the direction of Joseph Palin Thorley

a new course in the art of ceramics was opened and proved
much to the liking of students who were particularly
anxious to learn to express themselves through the
creative work of their hands. In the School of Business
Administration with the cooperation of the Evening
Division new courses were offered in studies ‘of the
American Institute of Banking, of Chartered Life Under-
writers and, for real estate brokers and salesmen, real
estate fundamentals. In response to a great demand the

School of Engineering instituted a study in reinforced
concrete design under Professor Adelbert Diefendorf, and

in the second semester courses in general engineering to
acquaint the students with the part of the government
plays in engineering, and industrial hygiene and phases
of toxology under Emerson Venable, who is associated

with the Westinghouse Research Laboratory.

The School of Mines_'_actually came intoiits own after
more than twenty years. More simply, classes moved
into the remodeled State Hall, a building that was
originally erected for them but, due to the increased
enrollment after the World War, was given over to
offices for the College, Business Administration, and
Education Schools. In their new quarters, suﬂicient
space was allotted to the petroleum engineering, chemi-

cal engineering, aeronautical engineering and mechanical

engineering departments, so that they might adequately
carry on their Work. To the new freshman was given
the top ﬂoor of the building with well equipped drawing
labs, while the pride of the school is the modern metal-
lography laboratory in the north wing of the building.

Another old branch of the University found a new
home on its twenty-first birthday, when the Research
Bureau of Retail Training "came of age" with the
dedication of its new quarters on the nineteenth floor of
the Cathedral of Learning. Sponsored by the department
stores in Pittsburgh, its purpose is to raise the level of
jobs and personnel in retail work. During the past year,
the annual class of twenty—five students were given courses
in advertising, sales promotion, personnel management,
and labor relations in their new classrooms where
"blackboards" are actually white. The Bureau library
houses one of the most complete collections of retailing

books in the country.

the University, keeping constantly new and vital the
courses that are being offered. To many of our faculty
have come honors during the past year that unmistakably
rank them with the leaders in their fields throughout the
country. A few of these include citations through the
meritorious awards of the Commonwealth of Pennsyl-
vania of Dr. john B. Sutherland, varsity football coach
and professor of physical education, for his effort in the
advancement of sports; of Dr. Charles G. King, professor
of chemistry, for his work in chemical research; and of
Dr. E. R. Weidlein, director of Mellon Institute, for his
outstanding contributions in industrial research. Equally
outstanding are the awards, professional recognitions
and honor positions that have come to innumerable
others, for whom we can but say, for want of space, your
excellent work has made and maintained an academic
name for Pitt that causes students to be proud to be
your students, for what is yours, you unselﬁshly share

with them.

The spirit of college still lingers with the 25,000 grads
through the General Alumni Association of the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh. This organization devotes itself en-

4

tirely to Pitt. Their object is ‘to promote the welfare
and interests of the University of Pittsburgh and its
Alumni, to foster closer cooperation between alumni and
the University, and to support and advance the cause of
higher education."

In order to keep the graduates in touch with the
Alumni of the school from which they graduated, the
General Alumni Association is subdivided into nine con-
stituent associations. Every member of the General
Alumni Association becomes a member of their particular

alumni group. Included in these groups:are the Alumni

Ulhard Hangartner

('38) and Rose Nu-
gent ('38) campaign
workers. . . .

GENERAL ALUMNI ASSOCIATION

DON F. SAUNDERS
Serrermy

 

Association of Business Administration, College, Den-
tistry, Education and Graduate, Engineering and Mines,
Law, Medicine, and Pharmacy in addition to the Alum-
nae Association, which offers an extensive program to
women graduates and students.

Each of these constituent associations has its own or-
ganization and carries on its own program. All of these
individual active groups are integrated with the parent
group by means of their three elected representatives who
serve on the Alumni Council.

Wherever there is a concentration of Pitt graduates
there is sure to be an Alumni Association sponsored Pitt

Club. Although only the Westmoreland and Mercer
Clubs have over a hundred members, making them eli-
gible for Alumni Council representation, there are active
groups in such far ﬂung areas as New York City, Phila-
delphia, Chicago, and Southern California. In Western
Pennsylvania each of the counties has its own Club.

All of these members, graduates of the nine schools
and residents of the four corners of the country, are in-
formed of the events of interest about their Alma Mater
through its monthly magazine, the Alumni Review. It
keeps alive the friendship and associations of under-
graduate days; it endeavors to exert a driving force for
constructive interest in the University. The Alumni Re-
view, which was ﬁrst published under Don F. Saunders,
succeeded the old Pimburgla Record.

 

Today, this organ serves as a memory of all of the ex-
cellent work Don Saunders had done for the University.
First, in his tenure as Review editor and later as secretary
of the General Alumni Association, the position from
which he resigned in April to take a new position as a
staff member of the American Institute of Public Opinion.
As in the case of Mr. Saunders, he too was succeeded by
the editor of the Almmzi Review, William Allison, now
the acting secretary. Assisting both of these men in the
tenure of Alumni secretary, Mrs. Justin Foldessy has
been assuming the ofhce responsibilities as oﬂice secre-

tary of the General Alumni Association.

Many affairs were sponsored by the General Alumni
Association to bring the "old grads” back to talk over
old times. Last year such affairs as the Homecoming
smoker, the Charter Day Ball, and Alumni Day were
listed on the social calendar. Members of the Associa-

tion were also brought closer as they joined in their an-

 

Albert Barr ('38), and Janet Hallock ('38), senior
awardee and queen of their class plan alumni work

nual membership drive, adding many fellow graduates
to. their group.

When members of the class of '39 receive their diplo-
mas on graduation day, they will not have the last tie
of college life severed, but instead they can look for-
ward to the college spirit perpetuated in an active

General Alumni Association.

For four year: we have worked and
played, won and lost, all in the com-
rezelexhip of Life at Pitt. With 4 Jweep
of the hand the towel ix toueel to the
other side, and the tie with thie life is
Jevereol. However each move: on, the

and the contribution: he has lent to the
life of others.

Reigning as honor attendant to their Queen, Alma Mater joins in
the glories of achievement and service.

Service, leadership, scholarship, ch:1r;1cter~~the Seniur Awardcc
is looked upon as the man most representative of the ideais of
the University of Pittsburgh Class of 193‘).

“We try to teach our students as much about business
as we can. But while knowledge and reason are necessary,
what is far more necessary is character and the wish to do
worthwhile things—unselﬁsh things. Without this a ﬁne
intellect is worthless. We must teach them that life is more
than mere ﬁnancial gain."

This is the philosophy of Dr. Charles S. Tippetts, Dean
of the School of Business Administration at the University.
Holder of many degrees including a Ph.D. from Princeton,
and a member of Phi Beta Kappa, Dr. Tippetts has been
head of the University School since 1935. Throughout that
time he has been regarded highly on campus as one who is
not only experienced in his ﬁeld, but also is a capable ad-

ministrator who is never too busy to_listen to his students’

problems. Much of the personal touch that has entered.

into the student-faculty relations in this large school may
be attributed to the example set by Dean Tippetts as he
breaks into a heavy schedule to consider the individual

student.

Since 1908, when it began as an evening session, the
School of Business Administration has trained young men

and women to live successful and socially useful careers in

The “Biz-Ad" mm discuss the last lecture on tbs way to lzmc/9.

business. The student who ﬁnds himself willing and able
to adjust himself to rapidly changing conditions in combina-
tion with an ability to analyze business problems correctly,
has found the true spirit of this School. The curriculum is
unique in that the entire senior year is left to the election
of the student. Little attempt is made to prepare the young
man or woman for a particular job or to enter a speciﬁc
industry. Throughout the course emphasis is placed upon
high standards of business conduct. To the typically busi-
ness courses are added those of a cultural nature aimed at
rounding out a more complete education for the student

who will eventually give his total personality to the busi-

. ness world.

An undergraduate club, The Pitt Business Institute, has
become famous for its bi-monthly luncheon and evening
meetings known as the "Biz-Ad Buzzers" where faculty and
students gather for better understandings of their own rela-

tions and of problems in the ﬁeld of business.

DR. STANTON C. CRAWFORD
Dean of the Callege

Back to the Revolutionary War! That, according to
Dean Stanton C. Crawford is how far he has been able to
go in ferreting out his family tree. Reading and research
work are hobbies of Dr. Crawford and his curiosity in
searching for the interesting details of local history has
given him the pleasure of having discovered items concern-

ing his family tree. Dr. Crawford, who himself now owns

 

Ami they really ./in rmd}

an extensive private librar_v, hopes that through the College
work the students will come to appreciate and later to build
libraries of their own. Dr. Crawford balances his scant
reading hours between fiction and classical works, and likes
a good detective or sea story occasionally. During the sun.-
mer months his thoughts turn seaward, and he likes nothing
better than to board a tramp steamer and cruise for a while.
On one of these trips he gathered material for his Ph.D. in
biology. In 1920 he taught zoology at Pitt and still con-
tinues his professorship in biology and his research in this
subject.

The College, largest of the University undergraduate
schools carries the responsibility for studies in the liberal
arts and sciences. For more than a century and a half this
school has served in this capacity for it is the direct de-
scendant of the original Pittsburgh Academy. The College
has accepted another responsibility at the University as the
various professional schools have come into being, for the
ambitious doctor-lawyer—dentist—to-be here lays the ground
work for his graduate study. Into the college program have
been fitted the many informal contacts that students are
able to attain through campus activities, fraternities, and
faculty conferences, all with the full approval and assis-
tance from Dean Crawford. In these latter experiences the
Association of College Students has supplemented the Col-
lege staff. In all, the College, through its various curricula
and with its faculty, offers to any capable student the op-
portunity to study and through his own efforts and with
skilled guidance to reach his best and highest level of learn-

ing, taste, judgment, discrimination and creative skill.

TO PRESENT

A year at the University of Pittsburgh in which We have grown
with her in stature, in spirit, in knowledge, in character. Particularly
have We tried to capture a significant era in our growth as we open-
ed the doors of the Nationality Rooms of the Cathedral of Learning
and took our places in an atmosphere of the great achievements of

the ancient scholars of the nations of the World.
