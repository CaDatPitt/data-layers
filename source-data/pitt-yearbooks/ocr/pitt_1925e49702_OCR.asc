All aboard!” The Class of ’26 started on its four-year cruise on the good ship
“PITT.” Blue and gold caps for the men, blue and gold arm-bands for the girls—all
who saw us knew that we were the new class of Freshmen. As soon as we pushed off
from land, we began making ourselves known. Never were men so gallant; never could
any knight of old have told of his love in so many different ways. Our Freshmen were
truly bold, for on any part of the deck of this good ship‘ “PITT,” one might have seen
some poor young fellow, just out of High School, trying himself at love-making, even in
spite of the onlookers, and there were many. But, our men did not devote all of their time
to the fair sex. They entertained men, women, and faculty alike with melodies. They
did their serenading at any time of the day. As the’ men did their bit for the Sophs, so
did the women. Our fair co-eds kept these high and mighty people busy. For at all
times the Soph girls could be seen running around catching up some wayward Frosh.

When we organized, we chose as president, Robert Irwin; vice-president, John
Cohen; secretary, Charles Friesell; and treasurer, Leroy Williams. Our girls had as their
oﬂicers, Helen Toay, president; Helen Gilleland, vice-president; Mary Lou McClel1and,
treasurer; and Nina Johnston, secretary. These oﬂicers, with the cabinet and committees.
started us on the ﬁrst fourth of our voyage.

We took our part in athletics, trying to have the Class of ’26 do as much as pre-
ceding Freshman classes had done in winning contests for “PITT.” Football and
Basketball teams were organized, and a Basketball team for the girls. We predicted
great futures for our athletes as varsity players.

W. S. G. A. gave quite a few noon-day dances for the new-comers—dances at which
each sailor on our good ship became better acquainted with the other sailors, dances
which helped us to realize that our class was a distinct organization apart from the rest
of the voyagers. When the ﬁrst fourth of our voyage was ﬁnished, we had ten men
newly elected to “Druids” and twenty women ready to become active in their Sophomore
year in “Cwens.” C

We came back this year as Sophomores, ready to take up the second part of the
voyage. We found new and varied peoples on board, new Freshmen, and we, the perse-
cuted, became the persccutors. We did our best to see that this year’s crop of Freshmen
began their cruise on “PITT” in just the right way. Entertainments, much the same
as we gave last year, were held for our amusement. We enjoyed having the tables
turned; we liked to see other poor Frosh do the very things that we disliked doing so
much.

As class oﬂicers we had George Cunningham as president, George Ferguson as vice-
president, and Paul Nettrour as secretary-treasurer. The girls elected as president, Eliza
Jane Reynolds; vice-president, Margaret Grier; and secretary-treasurer, Margaret Thomp-
son. Under these leaders our class has taken its right place on our good ship. We have
labelled our part of the boat, “PEP,” and we have lived up to this name. In the big
VVash-Jeff parade our girls won the prize, making the second time since we have been
on our voyage that our women have been recognized for their originality and for their
enthusiasm. Our girls had a very successful basketball season, and the men did their
part in athletics.

We have completed the first half of our trip. Some have been seasick, but have
recovered; others (poor souls) have found the Way too rough and have quietly slipped
overboard. We, who are left, will continue the trip, always doing our bit with the same
pep and enthusiasm that characterizes the Class of ’26.

Once upon a time—isn’t that the way most fairy stories begin? At any rate, it was
on the bright morning of September 24, 1923. when 825 freshmen meandered up the
, tiring steps to the campus. What a variety of expressions there was on the faces of that
mighty host of Frosh as they sauntered into the classrooms. Some went about with the
“I am captain of our home town team” air, or “I am. going to show this college a ‘point
or two." However, they all joined with a third group in assuming an air of meekness
and mild humility when the frisky Sophs appeared. ’ Dancing back down the steps to the
tune of the hickory sticks. thatwere wielded by those lofty upper classmen, we were all
assembled for a review. i
And that review! There we stood, coats turned wrong side out and backwards,
trousers rolled to knee length, and dinks set at a conspicuous:-angle; in short, we were
arrayed in such a manner as to make even the most ludicrous jester a back number. After
we had run the gauntlet, rendered solos and been photographed, the Sophs decided they
ought to share their entertainment with the “natives” of the burg, so we began a march
to town. . 1 
Trol‘ey after trolley was pulled from the wire as we trudged along the road to give
the home folks a treat. So enthused were we over the march that some of our members
offered to “love, honor and adore” the dark skinned beauties that happened our way.
After that eventful march to town where we showed our good qualities as a class, we
were permitted to go to our humble abodes. ’ '
Embarking on the second day of our college career, wewere greeted with a “Frosh.
got a match?," or “Here, Frosh, where are you going?”
Despite our evident greeness on that ﬁrst day, we soon showed that we had imbibed

the spirit of the Blue and Gold. We began to win our mark in athletics that bade fair
for our Alma Mater. After many hours on the gridiron, our football team carried off

well-deserved honors. They triumphed in a majority of games played. Then, too. our
basketball team went over big. Getting away to a good startland improving as the
season wore on, the squad pulled. through undaunted and glorious. Not to be forgotten.
was our cross-country team which boasted of some good runners in Captain Howell.
Kerr, Leis and Robinson. With the baseball and track squads just getting under way,
we hope to carry on the good work of our class. A

But our attention was not centered on one line of activities. Some of our journalistic,
witty members have contributed to the success of the Wcelefy and Panther. Even the
band and musical clubs have prospered by our presence as the musically inclined mem-
bers have lent their services to the success of the various organizations.

In order to make our career a triumph, we had to be united within our ranks. Thus,
by the aid of Dean Ashe, we wisely chose our class ofﬁcers. They are: William McClellan.
president; Milton Saﬁer, vice-president; Clyde Jack, treasurer; Mary Florence Taylor,
secretary. With this staff of officers at our head, we settled down to the grim realities
of college life, knowing that we would be safely guided on our way. '

At the close of the ﬁrst semester, we realized that we could not much longer be
dubbed the proverbial Frosh. So, with the; addition of mid-year freshmen. to our roster,
we went merrily on our way. Anticipating the activities of Pitt Week, we will prove to
the world that we can plan for pleasure as well as for work. As the years go on. we
feel that the class of '27 will take an important part in all the activities of the school.
We realize that as Frosh we have done many things we ought not to have done and have
left undone many things which we ought to have done. Yet feeling that each class falls
short of their duty in some respects, we feel that we will hold our banner high.

Thus we end our days as freshmen, not truthfully saying we are glad to leave, nor

l willingly saying we would be glad to stay. During the rest of our college days, we aim
,. to display the talent, energy and spirit shown in this, our freshmen year.

Eh» iﬁrnpnzrh iﬂitt ﬁtahium

By W. S. Hindman, ’98, Chief Engineer.

To the casual observer these great structures do not signify their real meaning. -The
superﬁcial impression of a great structure may be expressed in terms of thousands of
spectators, but to the student the great structure represents the climax of his-schoo1’s
recreational activities, the show place for himself and for those of his fellows who happen
greatly to excel in any one particular branch of athletic endeavor. The great structure
at any institution is the climax of its athletic system, the acropolis of athletic inspiration,
the typiﬁcation of a great ideal which spurs each student on to do his best in his own
recreational persuit.

In the selection of a site for a stadium, a number of important things have to be
taken into consideration. This location seemed to satisfy most of the requirements.
namely: the desirability of being located on the campus, non-interference with other
University buildings, reasonable cost of construction due to land values and natural
contour of the ground, and accessibility from the main arteries of transportation, auto-
mobile parking space is available within walking distance of the- stadium.

Some of the main features of the great structure as planned are as follows: total
seating capacity, 90,000, including 30,000 seats on the upper deck and 1,500 box seats;
length, 834 feet;- width, 592 feet; outside perimeter, 2,300 feet; height above playing
ﬁeld, 100 feet; height at main entrance. 135 feet; eight points of entrance from exterior.
72 portals to seat banks. The principal materials of construction are reinforced concrete
and structural steel and the estimated cost approximately $1,500,000.

Included in the plans are provisions for football, baseball, basketball, track, and
other athletic activities. It will also be available for large University functions and public
gatherings. Adequate space under the seats is provided for athletic ofﬁces, team rooms,
shower and locker rooms, and public toilets. A basketball auditorium to the left of the
main entrance is planned to seat approximately 6,000 spectators. '

Elite New
DR. JOHN BAIN SUTHERLAND

CCORDING to an announcement made by
A the Athletic Council, Dr. John Bain Suther-

lan(l of the class of 1918, will be head coach
of the Pitt Football team for the seasons of 1924.
1925, and 1926.

The selection of Dr. Sutherland has been received
favorably by all Pitt supporters. It has been
felt everywhere that Sutherland was the logical
choice by virtue of his great record as a player
at Pitt and his exceptionally ﬁne record as coach
at Lafayette College. VVhile head mentor of
Maroon football, ]ock's team lost but eight games
of forty-three played, and during that time, his
teams met Pitt four times, and succeeded in
splitting even. In 1920 and 1923, Lafayette lost
to Pitt by the scores 14-0, and 7-0; and won in

1921 and 1922 by the scores 6-0, and 7-0 respectively.
\/Vith Dr. Sutherland as head coach of football, Pitt can now boast of having four
varsity coaches who are Pitt graduates.

G132 (Elh
GLENN s. WARNER

HE close of the 1923 football season brought
T considerable sadness to
student body due to the loss of Head Coach

athletes and

Glenn S. Warner. Pop is leaving to take up the
duties as head coach of football at Leland-Stanford
University. Besides being a true friend to all
his students of the galues, Warner was a pioneer in
football, as it was he who worked out many of
the most famous plays and developed certain parts
of the game to make it more interesting and bene-
ﬁcial.

Coach Warner was a member of the football
team at Cornell University, being captain there in
1894. After graduating from Ithaca, Pop turned
to the coaching profession, and tutored the foot-
ball men at the University of Georgia. Following

 

his stay in the south, he took up the duties as coach of football for his alma mater,

and later he was coach of the famous Carlisle Indian football team.

In 1913, Warner came to Pitt, and has been with us for nine years.
the Panthers won 60. lost 12, and tied 4 games, making a ﬁne record, undoubtedly.
The students are truly sorry to see “The Grand Old Man” leave the Blue andGold, and

all wish him much success in his new position.

In this time,

A RESULT or Gwosm-:N‘s EDUCATED TOE.

BUCKNELL HUMBLED
Pitt 21 Bucknell 0

HE Pitt Panther inaugurated its 1923 football
T season by defeating Bucknell 21-0. For two

periods the warriors battled on even terms. and
it seemed as though the game was destined to be of
the 0-0 type, but in the rest period between halves,
Pop Warner instilled such inspiration in the players
that the second half was productive of three touch-
downs and three resultant goals from touchdown.
Finding the Lewisburgers exceptionally strong in the
line and apparently set for a Warner attack on the
forward line, Nick Shuler displayed some rare judg-
ment while in at quarterback position, and opened up
something in the way of aerial attack that was a treat
to gaze upon. VVith Nick Shuler and Jess Brown
throwing passes with unerring accuracy, and this
duet along with Captain Lloyd Jordan alternately re-
ceiving them with consummate skill. Pitt’s ﬁrst score
of the season was quickly accomplished. '

HOW LAFAYETTE LOST
Pitt 7 Lafayette 0

HEN it succeeded in defeating Jock Suther-
uo land’s Lafayette team, the University of Pitts-
burgh football machine came into its own, for
it was the ﬁrst victory over the Easton lads in three
years. Coach Sutherland was extremely desirous of
making it three straight over his old mentor and,
with this end in view, he had Lafayette equipped with
a variegated assortment of plays, chief of which was
his famous off tackle play. The Old Fox, however,
had the boys well drilled in an adaptable style of
defense and many times Jock was compelled to see
his pet plays stopped by the strong linemen. Gwosden
and Wissinger. In this game, the traditional goal
line defense of the Panthers was demonstrated many
times when the Warnerites, with their backs up
against the goal posts, fought like Trojans to repulse
the well-coached Maroon team.

WEST VIRGINIA VICTORIOUS
Pitt '7 West Virginia 13

' HE varsity suffered its ﬁrst defeat of the
season at the hands of the VVest Virginia Moun-
taineers, l3-7. The score, in a way, indicates

the ferocity of the struggle, although it is impossible

to tell of the ﬁghting spirit of the Panthers in that
memorable second half. The first half of the game
ended with the visiting team on the long end of the

score l3—0,. and seven minutes after the whistle had
blown for the renewal of the contest. Andy Gustafson

carried the ball over the line for the ﬁrst and lone
touchdown for Pitt. The great line work of Chase
and Murdoch in making holes for the backﬁeld men
proved to be a big factor in this scoring. The West
Virginia warriors held the game well in hand during
the ﬁrst half, not letting Pitt have one ﬁrst down.
The second half was quite different, rush after rush
giving the Blue and Gold rooters some hope of
winning with only the ﬁnal whistle cutting off all
such aspirations.

HOW SYRACUSE WON
Pitt 0 Syracuse 3

HEN the evenly—matched elevens of Syracuse
University and the University of Pittsburgh
met in New York. there was considerable ex-
citement, for all during.the contest neither team had
an edge on the other, and due only to the well—trained
toe of fullback McBride was the Orange team given

a 3-point victory over the Panthers. In the first

ha'f, honors were about evenly divided with the Gold
and Blue slightly heavier in the balance, but the
opening of the third session found the Pitt defense
slowing up, allowing the Orange men to creep
up with kicking distance of the Warnerites’ posts.
At this point Marsh Johnson covered himself
with glory by breaking up forward passes and pre-
venting placement kicks. After the beginning of the
second half, the Syracuse team made its lone score
after a l)locked kick and retrial at goal from ﬁeld.
Some sensational aerial work by Hoot Flanagan in
the last minutes of the game gave Pitt hope but the
Syracuse defense proved just a bit too strong.

FLANAGAN MAKING AN OFF TACKLI-: GAIN.

CARNEGIE TECH’S FIRST VICTORY
Pitt 2 Tech 7

N a hard fought game at Forbes Field, the Car-
I negie Institute of Technology gave the University

of Pittsburgh a defeat, 7-2. A spectacular run by
Robertson defeated the Blue and Gold, although
statistics did show Pitt the superior team. Buck
Templeton and Harold Akins starred for the Panthers
in the first Plaid victory in the history of Pitt-Tech
relations. The Pitties fought like madmen to over-
come the lead and twice came within the Tech ten-
yard line. Pitt's only score resulted after a kick to
the T-ech eight-yard line and a subsequent holding of
Tech for three plays which forced the Plaid to call
punt formation. Johnson broke through and blocked
Anderson’s kick, but Anderson recovered the ball and
was tackled behind the Tartan goal line.

ONE 01-‘ THE FAMOUS FLANAGAN TO BOHREN PASSES.

THE" PANTHER BOWS TO OLD PENN

Pitt 0 Penn 6

. 0 LD Penn registered its initial grid victory over

 

Pitt by the score, 6-0. From start to ﬁnish, the

game was a thriller, and it was apparent that
the breaks would settle the argument. Both teams
had numerous chances to score, but the break of the
second quarter which was a costly fumble for Pitt
was the only one taken advantage of. Led on by
Captain Jordan and Andy Gustafson, the Panthers
fought with the old traditional ﬁghting spirit, and
although defeated, they never quit. During the last
half of the game, Pitt placed all its hope in a passing
game and almost pulled the game out of the ﬁre.
Pitt had pushed Penn back well into her own terri-
tory and the stage was set for a Panther Score, but
hope dwindled when one of the Panther backs, suffer-
ing from an injured arm, permitted a long forward
pass to slip from his ﬁngers. Despite the defeat, the
Panthers showed improved play.

MARSH _ToHNsoN BLOCKS A “sURE” GROVE CITY TOUCHDOWN.

GROVE CITY DEFEATED
Pitt 13 Grove City 7

HE football team ended its string of defeats when
Grove City College was tackled at Forbes Field.
The visiting team. coached by Charlie Bowser
and Chalky Williamson, former Pitt luminaries
proved to be stronger opposition than was expecte:l
and forced the Panthers. who, were playing with an
entirely substitute backﬁeld, to extend themselves to
win by the margin of a touchdown. The most
thrilling incident of the battle was Jack Harding's
long run. Harding received a short pass from Brown
on the Pitt twenty-ﬁve—yard line and raced down the
ﬁeld seventy-ﬁve yards for a touchdown. After Grove
City had scored, and the game was at a tie, Keck
Grove City halfback, dropped the ball, and Lee Frank
who had been injected into the fray only a few
minutes before, fell on it in the end zone for the
winning touchdown of the game.

shown in the crushing defeat of Washington and
Jefferson College. when before a crowd of 30.000

spectators, the Pitt eleven completely outclassed the
believerlly unbeatable VV 8: J team. From the first
b'ast cf the whistle. the Blue and Gold team took
the offensive, receiving from W & J in the initial
kickoﬁ‘. The attempts of the Presidents to train
through the line were fruitless, so they resorted to
aerial tactics which earned them several ﬁrst downs.
The most thrilling moment of the game and one which
caused the Pitt cheering sections to go almost wild
was when Jakie Bohren took the ball around right
end for sixty yards to the Red and Black goal line.
The l)all was called back. however, being ruled out
of bounds at the forty-six-yard line. The lone touch-
rlown for Pitt was scored in the third quarter when
Bohren took the ball over the line after a series of
line p'ays and forward passes. The two ﬁeld goals:
made by the trained toes of Gwosden and Byers in
the last moments of play proved to be too much for
1he visitors. and the game ended 13-6 in favor of Pitt
Rohren played sensationally in the backﬁeld and Red
Seidelson did stellar work on the ﬁrst-line defense.

FLANAGAN RECEIVES FROM BOHREN FOR A TOUCHDOWN.

THE NITTANY LION CONQUERED
Pitt 20 State 3

N THANKSGIVING DAY, before a
0 crowd of thirty-ﬁve thousand people,
the Panthers completely outclassed the
Nittany gridders by the score, 20-3. At the
opening of the ﬁrst period, Pitt started
poorly, being off-side on the opening play
and having to kick off a second time with a
ﬁve-yard penalty. On Pitt penalties, State
worked the ball to the middle of the ﬁeld,
but was forced to punt. After regaining the
ball again. State changed its tactics and
Schuster dropped back to the _Pitt twenty~
nine-yard line and booted the ball over the
Pop WARNER WATCHING H15 PANTHERS goal posts. This three-point lead caused the
FOR THE LAST TIMI; TIII; TIDE Pitt stands to clamor for vengeance. and
TURNS AND PI-IT FORCES AHEAD, from this point of the game, a different story
is to be told. In the second period, Bohren
took a long forward pass from Flanagan and raced down the ﬁeld making way for a
touchdown, and after several other plays. Hoot Flanagan took the pigskin over the
line for the initial points for Pitt. VVith the kick off, State could gain nothing and
punted. A Pitt fumble of a poor pass rolled the ball to the Pitt twenty—six-yard line
where State recovered. A forward pass tried by State landed in the deft hands of Jakie
Bohren, who, with a sudden dash of speed, took the oval through the crowd of bewildered
opponents and started down the open ﬁeld with the renowned Harry VVilson in pursuit.
The result was a second touchdown for Pitt. The last part of the contest was more or
less one-sided, but not too onevsided for the Pitt rooters. In this time, Milo Gwosden
intercepted a pass and brought the ﬁnal six points for old Uni. Pitt threatened to score
several times during the remainder of the game but State held fast and further scoring
was checked. It was a game in which every Pitt man played super-football.

O1.1v1-:12 J. DE VICT()R.

Who is Ollie De Victor? Such a question on the Pitt campus, especially on the
upper campus where the athletes are wont to gambol, would be answered with a grunt
of disgust for the unsophisticated and ignorant interrogator. And the reason? Because
Ollie is a one—hundred per cent. good—fellow, and an equally good trainer. Ollie is su-
perior in his line, and is known far and wide in the athletic ﬁeld. To say more of him is

to run a serious risk of depreciating the credit due him, except—hats off to Oliver J.
De Victor!

The 1923-24 University of Pittsburgh Basketball team completed a schedule generally
considered as the heaviest ever drawn up for the Gold and Blue. Of the seventeen
games carded, Pitt won ten. The most important and gratifying of these were the
double victory over W. and J., the win over Tech, and the first Penn State victory
in years. On the other side of the column, Army, Grove City, and Bucknell counted
single victories, while Tech and State defeated the Panther to even the two—game series.
VVest Virginia alone remained invincible, the Mountaineers being the first to best Pitt
on Motor Square floor and to repeat the feat later on their home ﬂoor.

The most outstanding feature of the season was the customary fourth—quarter
rally of the Panthers. Always unexpected, a strong come-back in the face of a decidedly
adverse tally won game after game. It is to this continually outcropping last minute
ﬁght that Washington and Jefferson, Vanderbilt, Amherst, Allegheny, Carnegie Tech.
Lafayette and Penn State owe defeats.

Some of the spectacular performances of the Carlson coached team were parts of
the ﬁrst West Virginia, Carnegie Tech, and State games. In the defeat by the Moun-
taineers and in the victory over the Skibos, the ﬁnal. scores were tied and necessitated
extra periods, but Captain Carr’s ﬁeld goal in the’ haze of the sensational close of the
fourth quarter of the State game won it for Pitt without additional playing.

As to points, the Pittsburgh team was defeated in the first ten games only by the
Morgantown lads’ two points and Grove City’s one. Later, Tech’s victory came by
seven markers, and near the close of the season, Pitt slumped and bowed to West
Point, Penn State, Bucknell, and West Virginia by one-sided scores, but recovered to
hold the Tartan to a more reasonable tally and to beat the: Presidents. The opponents’
combined score, 446, exceeded Pitt’s total score, 435, by eleven points.

At the end of the season the squad numbered nine men: Captain Carr, Levinson,
King, Bohren_, Parsons, Flanagan, Melvin, Bruckoff, and James. Coach Carlson may
be rightfully credited with further developing Levinson, Carr, and Parsons; making ﬂoor
men of Bohren and Flanagan; bringing Wade King, captain-elect, to light as the sen-
sation of the Tri-State collegiate court leagues; and insuring a nucleus for next year’s
squad by pointing Melvin, Bruckoff, James, and “Horse” Chase whose injuries in one
at the gamesdropped him from the roll.

Haraitg iﬁaarhall 1923

VER vieing with the mighty Panther hordes of the gridiron, the University of
E Pittsburgh baseball team, coached by Dick Harley. continues to demand its just
share of prominence in campus athletic circles. In the early spring of last year it
was not generally supposed that the Pitt sluggers would make even a creditable showing.
Nevertheless, after the uniforms had been entrusted to the ravages of the moths and
Coach Harley had retired from the public eye, the black-and-white record of the 1923
(liamondites went into print to be preservedgfor posterity as one of the greatest of Pitts-
burgh achievements.

Throughout the season the periods of defeat were spasmodic in their occurrence, only '
Penn State besting the University boys in two consecutive games. To even matters
with the Nittany Lion, the Pittsburghers slipped over to the Eastern slope of the tower-
ing Alleghanies, baffled the Blue and White with a dazzling style of major circuit base-
ball, and returned to the Steel City with a rich pelt of the King of the Jungle, Against
West Virginia, Pitt commandeered three out of four engagements. For the entire
season the Gold and Blue emerged triumphant in eleven of seventeen games.

Working on the slab with a perfection common to the big time boys, “Steve”
Swetonic and “String” Noble bore the} brunt of the locals’ pitching. Captain Hill makes
his exit as pilot in favor of Captain-elect Swetonic and Manager Wertz gracefully steps
down after a period of conscientious service, “Eddie” Swisher moving up to ﬁll the
vacancy.

TRACK St,_>1iAn.

Elbe 1923 Tlrark ﬁreman

The track team of 1923 had only a fairly successful season. Due to the great Weakness
in the two hurdle events, the team was unable to make a good showing in duel meets,
but on the other hand. it displayed great strength in the intercollegiate meets held at
Schenley Oval and Washington.

When Coach Frank Shea stepped into Andy Kerr's shoes as track coach he had
a number of last year’s lettermen about which to mold his team, and to this number was
added a few stars from the 1925 Freshman squad. The outdoor season opened with a
southern invasion, the team meeting Georgetown and the Navy on April 19 and 21, and
losing both of these contests. The score at Georgetown was 83-43 and that at Annapolis
was 93-38. The runners next met the Army at West Point,. and with the return of Tiny
Hewitt and Gerald Allen, the team did considerably better than on the Southern trip,
but still added another defeat to its record. The West Virginia meet was a great
surprise, the Morgantown cindcrpath men taking the Panthers over by the score 74-61.
Liill Robusch made a new pole vault record, and several of the West Virginia
men set new marks. At Lititle Washington, Pitt won the intercollegiates by having 84
of the ﬁnal score points. Marsh Johnson broke the university sho-t put record, and Ted
Corbett set a. new VV & J record for the two— mile run. Ant Geneva, Pitt had little trouble
in winning, Here, Marsh Johnson again broke the record for the shot put and Gerry
Allen made a new mark for the half-mile. The following Saturday. Pitt held her’ annual
intercollegiate track and Field meet at Schenley Oval. The Panther took a close second
in this meet with Penn State standing ﬁrst. Allan Helfrich of Penn State set a new
record for the half—mile run on Schenley Oval. His time was 1:57 2/5 minutes. The
final meet of the season was lost to Penn State at State College early in June. In this
meet, Pitt scored first in every ﬁeld event, and State took ﬁrst in every track event.
The ﬁnal score was 76-60.

The men lost by graduation are: Captain Esler Hays, Tiny Hewitt, Gerald Allen,
and Merle VVakeﬁeld. Marsh Johnson was the high point score for the team during
the season, aggregating 87 points. Bill Robusch followed with 35,. and Wakeﬁeld garnered
49 to his credit.

Jllrralyman Zllnnthall, 1923

Under the leadership of Captain Joe Preece, former Monaca High School and Belle-
fonte Academy luminary, the Pitt Freshmen griddists brought their season to a close
with a loss to the famous Kiski Prep School team. The season as a whole was very
satisfactory, considering the strength of the opposition, with two games won, three lost
and one tied. , '

The curtain rose on the season for the cubs when the West Virginia University
Frosh played a preliminary to the varsity game at Forbes Field. The result proved
disasterous for the yearlings as the visitors took them over by the score of 21-6. The
next game was more successful for the cubs who journeyed to Syracuse University and
won from the Orange team, 13-7. Ollie Harris and Joe Schmitt did the feature work
for the first year men. The Carnegie Tech Plebes were next on the schedule in a pre-
liminary to the varsity contest. The result was 6-6 tie after a hard-fought contest.
Bellefonte Academy was played and the Freshmen lost to the prep school boys, 27-7.
The next game was with Penn State Freshmen who lost by the close score, 7-6. The
ﬁnale of the schedule was snatched by Kiski, 7-6.

Coach Carlson will turn over to Coach Jock Sutherland a number of stellar players
for the 1924 varsity. Among these are Ollie Harris, Dutch Amann, Joe Schmitt, Joe
Preece, Tulfy McMillen, Mike Meyers, Tiny Linn, Kess Woodruﬁ, Tubby Reister, Fuzzy
jack, Joe Archibald, Vislay and Coulter.

The girls‘ Varsity basketball team at the University in the 1923-24 season was

one of which Pitties could well be proud. A great change was instituted this year, in
that freshmen and new entrants were eligible for Varsity, eliminating the ﬁrst year

aggregation, competing with out of school teams as has been the custom. Great credit
is due to the girls and their coach this year, that they upheld the previous record of
Pitt girls‘ Varsity, for only two of the letter girls from last year remained. The games
at Trees were all successful, and the team when abroad was accompanied by many of
the local enthusiasts. The games with one exception were victories, Geneva, West-
minster and Thiel all being vanquished both at home and abroad, proving that as usual
the Pitt team may be ranked as the best team in the group of Western Pennsylvania
outﬁts. On February 15, the Pantherettes set out on the longest western trip yet taken,
and received the only defeat of the season, at the hands of the University of Cincinnati
co-eds, by a score of 32-30. The game was advertised as a model girls’ game and was
viewed by coaches of girls’ teams from all sections of Ohio. The clash with the Alumni
on March 15, the first game of this kind that has been played at the University for a
number of years. aroused great interest and closed the season for the Panther lassies.
Miss Margaret A. McClenahan, Education ’19, Assistant Professor of Physical
Education, coached the team. '

I mnmmh... HHHHIIIIIIIIIZI:

Wilt, captain (Side-center)
Olive, ’24, played her third and last year of Varsity basketball at Pitt, enjoying the

best season of her career. Playing a very consistent game throughout the year, she
proved her worth as an able leader.

, Zeigler (guard)
Ib, captain of the Pitt freshmen outﬁt of 1925, played her second year as Varsity
guard this season, and kept up her dependable record.
Muter (forward)

Jeanne, captain of the 1926 freshman team, played a spectacular game throughout
the season. This is her first year on Varsity, and her team work and accurate shooting
have given her place in the ranks of Pitt co-ed stars. Her ﬁeld goals totaled 51.

Burgun (guard)
Kathleen played very steady basketball and displayed some of the best ﬂoor work

ever shown here. She secured for the team a well-balanced defense and helped/to send
many a team down to defeat.

Stultz (forward)
Ruth, star forward from McKees Rocks featured every game in her exc-ellent work

in the forward section. Her first year on Varsity, she made an unusual record, the
season netting her 33 field goals.

Russel (center)
Dot, another of our freshmen Varsity girls, has completed a successful season
leaving very little to be desired in her work as center. There were few who could out
jump her and her determination ﬁlls out the necessary qualiﬁcations of a star.

Bigham (forward)

Mary was captain of the 1924 freshman team and bid fair to be one of the most
wonderful forwards, in the game, and it was with the keenest regret that the girls and
Miss McClenahan were forced to realize that owing to an injury received in practice
Mary was out of the game for her third and last year of Varsity.

Lloyd (side-center)

Helen, a transfer from Carnegie Tech, showed up well in the games when the op-
portunity offered, and since she has still two more years at Pitt, much is expected of her.

Kammerer (forward)

Mary’ was a dependable sub last year, and this year earned her ﬁrst Varsity lett-er.
Playing with grim determination she helped considerably in piling up Pitt’s side of the
scores.

Pervosky (forward)

Sylvia is one of our peppiest: and most dependable players. She can handle equally
well a position at side-center or forward and we’re all hoping to see her name in head-
lines by nextyear.

Ackcr (guard)

_ Marcella proved a dependable and efficient guard all season. She was one of our

strongest substitutes and could always be relied upon. '

Jeannette McClure, (Janet Matheson, Elsie Thompson, and Eleanor Resche. These girls
3::

Recognition is given to the following girls: Peg Thompson, Venus Shakarian,
were faithful in practice and deserve much credit for their loyal support of the team.

Something new in basketball in this part of the country was introduced this past
season in the form of inter-class intercollegiate contests between the Pitt and Tech
girls’ class teams. The games were well attended and aroused great interest, promising
to make the series of contests an annual event. The games resulted in victories for the
Pitt combinations, all but the Senior outﬁt, which lost to Tech in a close game ending 10-7.

Inter—class Basketball

In the preceding season, another innovation in the sport was the series of inter-
class games substituted for the inter-fraternity contests of last year. Great interest
was shown in the elimination of the teams and there was a marked improvement over
the teams of last year in training and team work.

Swi.mming—Spring 1923

Manager—Nan Steele (appointed by W. A. A.)

Class Leaders (appointed by Dept. of Physical Education)
Freshmen—Kath1een Burgun and Eliza Jane Reynolds
Sophomores—Be11a Ress and Agnes Hewitt '

Seniors—Adele Boucek and Kit MacNamara

Track

With the coming of the outdoor events, much attention is being paid to the re-
markable prospects for the girls’ track team. Last year a track meet was not held at
the University as in the previous year, but individual records were taken. The material

' for this year is very promising and with a little practice in this line a team may be
developed that will represent the University in intercollegiate events.

Hockey

Field hockey was introduced at the University this last fall, and from now on will
assume a regular place in the girls’ athletic program. The Sophomore team walked
off with the championship this past season.

Tennis

A regular tennis tournament was held last spring, in which many of the girls of
the University entered with great enthusiasm. The contests got under way rather late
on account of the condition of the courts, and so the ﬁnals were played after the com-
pletion of the regular school year in June. Arnoldine Lohman and Marge Sander com-
peted in ‘the’ ﬁnal contest, after winning their way through the elimination. The match
resulted in victory for Arnoldine Lohman, who graduated last June. A silver cup was
awarded by VV. A. A.

Alpha ($amma Elﬂhi

Alpha Gamma Phi Fraternity was founded at theUniversity of Pittsburgh, Evening
School of Economics, Accounts and Finance,‘ in 1916, eight years ago. The rapid growth
of the Evening School, since its inception a number of years earlier, offered a wide
ﬁeld for the selection of men whose aim was to complete the full four-years’ course
required to obtain the Certificate of‘Attainment. It was ivery noticeable that too great
a number of students failed to complete the four, years of study, and Alpha Gamma
Phi undertook to foster the idea that it was to the best interest of the evening school
students and of the Evening School itself that more men should strive to obtain the
Certiﬁcate. One of the pre-requisites of membership in Alpha Gamma Phi is a decla-
ration by a candidate that he proposes to work for the diploma. About half of the
present Alpha Gamma Phi men are now graduates of the Evening School, the remainder
still being undergraduates.

Beginning with a membership of ﬁfteen men, about half a dozen men were selected
yearly, until the present roster numbers about ﬁfty young business ‘men representing
the various industries in the Pittsburgh district.

Alpha Gamma Phi has taken an active part in the social activities of the University,
and has been regularly represented on the Board of Ofﬁcers and Executive Committee
of the Evening School Association. .

Plans are being developed for the incorporation and nationalization of Alpha Gamma .
Phi, approval of which has been obtained from the University authorities. '

Alpha iﬂhi Erlta

The Alpha. Phi Delta Fraternity was organized in 1910 at Syracuse University, and
since then has made exceedingly rapid progress. At the present time there are sixteen

‘chapters located at Yale, Columbia, University of Michigan, University of New York,’

Ohio State and many of the other well—known eastern and middle-western institutions.

The Nu Chapter, University of Pittsburgh, was installed February 4, 1923. It took
the place of the old Delta Lambda. Mu fraternity which was organized in 1914. The
chapter now has twenty-f-our active members and a fairly good representation of alumni
members.

The Delta Sigma Phi Fraternity was founded at the College of the City of New
York in 1899. It is composed of forty active and ten alumni chapters distributed through-
out the country. The Fraternity has become international in scope since the installation
of a chapter at McGill University, Montreal, Canada.

The Pittsburgh Chapter was granted a charter in 1916, the nucleus being the A‘pha
Omega local of 1914. The first chapter house was located at 410 Morewood Avenue and
existed until the outbreak of the war in 1917, when a majority of the members entered
the service. In the fall of 1919 the chapter was revived and maintained a home on North
Craig Street. At present the active chapter consists of forty men.

Kappa Nu

Kappa Nu Fraternity was organized November 12, 1922, at the University of Roch-
ester, by six students seeking some way by which they might inculcate in each other
a more fraternal spirit, in both a spiritual and a social sense. The purpose at ﬁrst was
to have a strictly local fraternity, but the spirit and the groundwork of the founders
were so strong that soon it was decided to allow a branching out into other ﬁelds, but
with restrictions so severe that there was no danger of the formation of immature
chapters. The growth of Kappa Nu since that time has been rapid but deliberate. There
are now eighteen active chapters, located at universities and colleges as far west as the
University of California and as far south as Tulane University in New, Orleans. The
legislative program of Kappa Nu is in the hands of the General Assembly which meets
once a year in convention and which consists of two delegates from each chapter.
Administrative affairs are in the hands of four national ofﬁcers and a council of ten, who
are elected each year by the National Assembly.

In 1920, the Omega Kappa Fraternity existed at Pitt as a local organization. Early
the next year it petitioned and was admitted into Kappa Nu as Xi Chapter and since
that time has formed an integral part of the fraternal life at Pitt.

The Phi Delta Theta Fraternity was founded at Miami University, Oxford, Ohio,
on December 26, 1848, and is known as one of the Miami Triad. From the chapter
organized by six students of Miami University, the Fraternity has expanded until now
the national organization of Phi Delta Theta embraces a chapter roll of ninety chapters
situated in thirty-eight states and two chapters in Canada.

The Pennsylvania Iota Chapter of Phi Delta Theta was founded as the Delta

Sigma Pi Local Fraternity at Pitt in 1908. Delta Sigma Pi was granted a charter by

Phi Epsilon Pi was founded in the year l902'at the College of the City of New
York. Urged on by its progressive and democratic doctrines, its expansion was phe-
nomenal. In but a brief period it was ready to take an honored position in the fraternity
world. Recognizing no barriers to any race or creed, social or political station, it opens
its door to anyone who can measure up to its qualiﬁcations and standards; and today,
Phi Epsilon Pi enjoys the unique privilege of being the» only nationalfraternity in the
country non-sectarian. Its aim is to promote an invisible comradeship that strives to
make the individual less selﬁsh; and to develop the more innate of altruistic motives until
the common welfare becomes a continual source of intellectual enjoyment.

Imbued with these principles, Zeta Chapter of Phi Epsilon Pi was installed at the
University of Pittsburgh on December 26, 1913, and since has left no stone unturned
in its earnest endeavors to help place Pitt where it deserves to be.

(ﬁamma Sigma Qlhaptrr

The Pi Lambda Phi Fraternity was founded at Yale University in 1895. Soon
after, Alpha Chapter at Columbia was admitted, and later New York University was
added to the organization. During the trying years of the inauguration of the Fraternity,
there was a great deal of spirit and fraternal love existing among the chapters of these
three schools. Each became recognized on the Campus entirely through its own
efforts and excellent accomplishments in school activities. Pi Lambda Phi was incor-
porated as a National Fraternity, and further continued its development by establishing
Chapters at Cornell, Lehigh, University of Chicago, University of Pennsylvania, Uni-
versity of Toronto, McGill University, Stevens Tech, West Virginia and the University
of Michigan. Gamma Sigma was installed at the University of Pittsburgh during the
year of 1914. Through hard and earnest work, Gamma Sigma now enjoys an enviable
reputation on the Campus, and is recognized in important activities at the University.

Pi Rho Delta was organized June 5, 1921, with twelve charter members, and was
recognized by University officials on October 21, 1921. Admission to the Inter-Fraternity
Conference was granted January. 1924. Since its inception its growth has been steady
and consistent. Pi Rho Delta aims to encourage its members to maintain a high
standing as students and gentlemen. and to foster cordial and fraternal relationship.

Pi Rho Delta's ﬁrst house located at 235 Darragh street was occupied from Sep-
tember, 1922, until the beginning of the present school year when it was necessary to
seek new quarters. The present home which is ideal in every respect is located at 230
McKee Place.

ﬁigma Alpha Epailmt

Sigma Alpha Epsilon was organized at the University of Alabama, Tuscaloosa,
Alabama, on March 9, 1856. It was ﬁrst intended to be a southern fraternity, but after
the Civil War it spread north of the Mason-Dixon line. The fraternity now has a
chapter at every large college and university in the United States, ninety-four active
and thirteen inactive chapters in all.

The University of Pittsburgh Chapter, Pennsylvania X 0 was formerly a local
of the same name. On March 9, 1913, it was installed as a chapter of Sigma Alpha
Epsilon. The chapter house was originally located on DeSota Street, and later at
4807 Baum Boulevard. In December, 1920, a new home was purchased at 244 Belle-
field Avenue.

The Sigma Chi Fraternity was founded at Miami University, Oxford. Ohio, in
1855. It grew steadily until the Civil War when fraternity and college life was paralyzed
in general. During the Civil War, Sigma Chi had something that was unparalleled in
the Greek world, an active chapter with the armies in the ﬁeld. After the war Sigma
Chi recovered quickly and continued her progress and expansion.

In 1909 Beta Theta Chapter was installed at the University of Pittsburgh, the
oldest national non-professional body on the campus. The young chapter prospered
and soon took an active part in all school affairs.

Theta Chi Fraternity was founded at Norwich University, Northﬁeld, Vermont on
April 10., 1856. Since that time the fraternity has followed a program of very conserva-
tive expansion and at present has forty chapters situated in every part of the country.

The present University of Pittsburgh Chapter was organized by a group of students
from the School of Engineering in December, 1915. under the name of Sigma Epsilon.
The main purpose of this organization was to get together as many non—fraternity men
as possible, as well as to give the School of Engineering a better representation in the
University than had been the case previously. Under the ﬁrst constitution the organiza-
tion was conﬁned to the School of Engineering. But as time went on in order to get a
ﬁrmer foundation and a broader ﬁeld from which to draw its members, it was advisable
for the best interests of the organization to apply to a National Greek-letter Fraternity,
for admission to their body. A petition was drawn up, accordingly, and was sent to the
grand chapter of Theta Chi Fraternity in 1917. The petition was approved in 1918 and
Sigma Epsilon became Alpha Beta Chapter of Theta Chi on May 24, 1919.

Mater.

The fraternity was organized on December 6, 1920, with Henry VV. Angus, president:
C. R. Foster, Jr., vice-president; Theodore R. Crandell, treasurer and Roy W. Jacobs.
secretary. Ofﬁcial University recognition came on February 2, 1921, and admission to
the Inter-Fraternity Conference soon later.

of the college year found it necessary to seek new quarters. The present home, 442
Amberson Avenue, is commodious, thoroughly equipped, and well situated.

Delta in 1917. The Pittsburgh alumnaechapter, together with Marguerite Roberts,
Iota_, and Muriel Scott, Delta, were instrumental in founding the local which four
months later became Alpha Alpha Chapter.

Kappa Kappa ﬁamma

Kappa Kappa Gamma was founded on October 13, 1870, at Monmouth College,
Monmouth, Illinois, and was the second women’s Greek-letter fraterniy to be founded.
At the present time there are ﬁfty active chapters and Alumnae Associations in more
than ﬁfty cities.

National conventions of the fraternity are held biennially, province conventions
being held in the years alternating with the national convention. The national con-
vention will be held in June of this year at Bigwin Inn, Lake of Bays, Ontario, Canada[

During the interim of conventions the affairs of the fraternity are managed by a
National Council composed of ﬁve members which at present consists of: National Presi-
dent, Mrs. May Whiting Westermann, of Bronxville, New York; National Vice-Presi-
dent, Miss Marion V. Ackley, of Detroit; Executive Secretary, Mrs. Della Lawrence
Burt, of Bryan, Texas; National Registrar, Miss Marie Leghorn, of Seattle, Wash-‘
ington; and Editor of The Key, Mrs. Rosalie Geer Parker, of Brooklyn. New York.

Aside from the individual activities of the various chapters, Kappa Kappa Gamma,
as a national organization, maintains a Student’s Aid Fund and an Endowment Fund.
The Student’s Aid Fund is not limited to members of Kappa Kappa Gamma, but is
open to all women, students attending colleges where the fraternity has a chapter.

The fraternity is also active in philanthropic work, one of its more important
undertakings being the support of a Mission for the war-stricken children of France.
In 1917 the fraternity established a dispensary at Bellevue-Meudon, a suburb of Paris,
which it supported for over ﬁve years, and in the maintenance of which the members
of the fraternity continue to have an active interest.

The Key of Kappa Kappa Gamma, the publication of which was authorized in
1881, was the first journal published by a Women‘s fraternity.

Gamma Epsilon chapter was established at the University on February 21, 1919,
when -a National Charter was granted to the members of E. R. O—., a local organized
in 1916.

The insignia of the fraternity is a golden key; its colors are light and dark blue,
and its ﬂower the ﬂeur-de-lis.

Phi Mu, the second oldest secret organization for women, was founded January 4,
1852, at Wesleyan College, Macon, Georgia, but was not made known to the public
until March 4, 1852. It was then known as the Philomatheon Society. From its
founding until the present time, the organization has retained the characteristics of its
original fraternal bond, the same high ideals, qualiﬁcation of membership, insignia,
ritual, and constitution, the only changes being those necessitated by the passage of
years and the transition from a local to a nation-wide sphere. - V

The ﬁrst magazine, the Philomatheon Gazette, was published in 1857. The
fraternity’s publications now include a Monthly Bulletin, an Aglaia Quarterly, and an
Esoteric Annual.

Phi Mu grew steadily in tradition and inﬂuence in the Southern states. Robert
E. Lee, Commander-in-Chief of the Confederate Army, and Jefferson Davis, President
of the Confederacy, were honorary members. Now the fraternity is well represented
over the entire country, charters having been granted to forty—one chapters. Twenty-
six Alumnae Chapters have also been chartered, making a total membership of over 6,000.

The Phi Mu Healthmobile operating in relief work among the poor and illiterate
of the Georgia mountains is an attempt to pay the Mother State the debt Phi Mu
daughters recognize. The fraternity also provides the Alpha Memorial Scholarship
Fund which affords loans to those of its members who have met with unfortunate cir-
cumstances.

The local Beta Theta chapter of Phi Mu, formerly known as Alpha Mu, was char-
tered September 22, 1920.

P iﬂi Etta iﬂlii

The founding of Pi Beta Phi, the ﬁrst national secret college society for women to
be modelled after men’s Greek—letter fraternities, marked the beginning of a distinctly
new epoch in women’s educational life. In April of 1867, twelve women students of
Monmouth College, Monmouth, Illinois, established the fraternity under the Latin name
of I. C. Sorosis. It having been decided that the fraternity should be a national organi-
zation, a second chapter was established at Iowa Wesleyan University, Mt. Pleasant, Iowa,
the following year.

In 1888 the name of I. C. was oifﬁcially changed to Pi Beta Phi by an act of the
Illinois Legislature. There was no change in constitution, ritual, purpose, or basic
ideals of the fraternity. Pi Beta Phi has at the present time 68 active chapters and 116
alumnae clubs.

In 1906 the fraternity, as a national group, established a Scholarship Fund of $1,000
to be awarded competitively to any two Pi Phi undergraduates. Later a Fellowship
Fund of $500 was established to be used in any college of the United States or Europe.
Pi Phi’s activities were not conﬁned to the ﬁeld of higher education alone. Since 1910
the fraternity has maintained a Settlement School at Gatlinburg, Tennessee, in honor
of the Founders. '

Pennsylvania Delta Chapter of Pi Beta Phipformerly Dianthians, was chartered at
the University of Pittsburgh, September 19, 1918.

Kappa iﬁai

The Kappa Psi Fraternity was founded in 1879, in the little town of New Haven.
Connecticut. It was the ﬁrst medical or pharmaceutical fraternity to be organized.
Since then, it has grown until it now has a chapter in every large college or university
in the United States. They now number 87 in all, and extend from the Atlantic to the
Paciﬁc oceans. The active membership is about 15,000.

The Beta Kappa Chapter of the Kappa Psi Fraternity was organized at the University
of Pittsburgh, in 1913. It now has about 1,200 inactive members, and 65‘ active members.

The Kappa Psi Fraternity has been the lifting-stone for all those who have belonged
to it. Its motives are plentiful, and it has proven to be a man-builder to many. It gives
to the fellows a spirit of good-fellowship, scholarship, honor. courage of heart and mind,
and everything else which helps to make a man. This fraternity has progressed in this
way for many years, and will continue to do so, for many, many more years.

The International Fraternity of Delta Sigma Pi was founded in 1907 at New York
University by a group of students who were endeavoring to promote better fellowship. a
liigher scolastic standing and .to promote the study of commerce in Universities and
Colleges. Lambda Chapter was at the beginning a local fraternity at the University of
Pittsburgh. known as Alpha Theta Tau. The grou of students who organized this
Local Fraternity had practically the same idea as did the founders of the International
body. After about one year as a Local, the group petitioned the National Ofﬁcers of
Delta Sigma Pi and on the 13th day of May, 1921. Lambda Chapter was installed. The
International body has grown considerably and at the present time has twenty-eight
chapters located from coast to coast, with one chapter beyond the borders of this country.

The University of Pittsburgh Band was organized under the leadership of Saul
Sabad and the management of Don Kirk in the year 1911-12. The students and
Alumni of the Universityfelt the need of a student Band and loyally subscribed the
necessary funds for the purchase of the necessary instruments.

The first public appearance of the Band was at Forbes Field, Saturday, October
14, 1911, at the Pitt-Ohio Northern football game.

In the year 1917 the Band was very fortunate in securing the coaching services
of M. S. Rocereto, widely known musician. Coach Rocereto has served faithfully in
this capacity down to the present day.

In the year 1920 the Athletic Council adopted the policy of sending the Band to
the Annual Pitt-Penn game at Philadelphia, and in 1921 the Council gave the Band a
complete set of blue overcoats.

George Davis, the present leader, followed Wm. Gregory in the year 1922-23 and
was assisted by Christian, as manager, Gustav Schramm as faculty advisor, and Coach
Rocereto. During his ﬁrst term the Second Annual Home Concert was held. as were
also the Trip and Banquet. The Blue and Gold capes were purchased by the organization
during this year. .

The same leaders continued at the helm during the present year and have guided
the Band through its greatest year. The Band appeared for the ﬁrst‘ time before a New
York audience. at the Pitt-Syracuse football game, and the New York critics spoke of
it as the “finest student Band that ever came to town.” In Philadelphia it met with

~ equally great success. The Third Annual Concert was held at Carnegie Music Hall
on the evenings of April 30, May 1, and May 2. and was a decided success. The year
was brought to a close with the annual banquet and the awarding of the keys to the
faithful members. Too much credit cannot be given the leaders for their ﬁne work and
untiring efforts that made the Pitt Band one of which the entire University is proud.

iﬁiztnrg nf Ihr (Elana nf 1924

In the fall of 1920, from far and wide, came to Pitt a peppy throng of erstwhile
high school students soon destined to be members of the class of ’24.

Even during our Freshman year, when we must bow to the sophisticated Sophomores,
we asserted our rights as in the memorable water ﬁght of State Hall. There, due to
our superior skill in handling the hose, the guardian angels had to literally swim for shore.
VVith characteristic initiative we started having “Baby Hops” twice a month during
lunch hour when all Freshmen, and only Freshmen, joined together for an hour’s fun.
These dances were held in the Heinz House, and served as a means of meeting our
fellow members and of building up a strong class spirit. Soon we organized with
W'illian1 H. Rhody as president, but due to his death, the work of guiding the class
fell to the vice-president, Samuel Samberg. The girls were separately organized with
Edna Vero as president. Sad, but true, several eccentric hair cuts and other minor
punishments were inﬂicted upon us, but these experiences enabled us to administer
punitive measures more efficiently as Sophomores.

Our Sophomore was mostly concerned with enforcing the Freshman rules and with
guiding the youthful footsteps into the well—worn paths of campus life. Under the
leadership of Bernard Funk and Claire McKay, we capably discharged our duty. To
add a little dignity to our ofﬁce, we celebrated the ﬁrst Emancipation Day when, with
appropriate pomp and ceremony. the “dinks” were burned and the traditional hatchet
buried. Not neglecting the social side of college life, we held several dances which
culminated in the Sophomore Hop given in the Schenley Hotel. With football_ basketball,
studies, and newly acquired activities, time rapidly passed, and we found that we, the
class of ’24, had reached the half-way mark and were started on the third year of our
Pitt career.

Our Junior year, we elected Ira Hill as president, Robert Keeley as vice-president,
Edward Knapp as secretary, George Duerr as treasurer, and Mary Bigham as president
of the girls. Under their leadership, the class took charge of the many duties assigned
them, two of which deserve special mention. Of course. the first was the Junior Prom,
the outstanding social event of the year. With Eddie Swisher as chairman and every-
body working hard, its success was assured. Clever decorations, good music, novel
favors—all helped to make it a gala night. Naturally, the other was the publication of
the Junior “OWL”—our “OWL”—and one of the best ever put out by a Junior class.

This, our Senior year, we chose Robert McKinnis as president, Robert Keeley as
vice-president, John Bigler as treasurer, and Clara Plummer as secretary. Nan Steele
was chosen as president of the girls. As Seniors, we have undertaken many new and
responsible duties which only upper classmen can discharge. Pitt Week, with John
Stewart as chairman. will long be remembered as an outstanding occurrence of the year.
The Senior Ball, with Ira Hill as chairman, was a truly Senior affair, as this was the
last big social event when we, as a class, would be together.

Thus, we have spent our four years, with many achievements well done, and others
begun which we leave to the classes following to accomplish. And, as we go forth
from -our Alma Mater, we ﬁnd that we still possess the same determined spirit that
cannot and will not be defeated.

The Collembola Club of the University of Pittsburgh was organized in February,
1923, by a group of students interested in the Natural Sciences. In organization and
methods it is modeled after the Agassiz Club at Cornell University and the Naturalists’
Field Club of the University of Pennsylvania. The name of the club is taken from that
of a “small, primitive insect, which has the habit of being very active.”

Its purpose is to promote a closer union among students interested in Zoology,
Botany and Geology, and it lays special emphasis upon ﬁeld study, made. possible by
regular ﬁeld trips. While ofﬁcers of the club must be undergraduates, membership in
the club is open to any person interested in the club’s activities, whether studying
natural science or not. Membership is not required for participation in meetings and
trips of the club, and the dues per semester are nominal.

Under the leadership of Rudyerd Boulton the ﬁrst year of activity was a decided
success; the ﬁeld trips being especially enjoyed by the members who regard them as
unusual opportunities for legitimate diversion during the school year. The ﬁrst three
week-end trips were so successful that they are being repeated this year, and have been
assigned a deﬁnite place in, the club’s-‘ calendar for each, year. The places visited on the
long trips were Raccoon Creek, below Monaca; Bear"s ‘Cave, near Hillside, Pa.; and
Pymatuning Swamp at Hartstown, Crawford Co., Pa. Additional week-end trips of
the present year have been the State Forest Reserve, near Ligonier, Pa., and the Indian-
Creek and Ohio Pyle region south of Connellsville. Trips for a single day are taken
frequently to interesting localities nearer Pittsburgh. The ﬁeld trips are informal affairs,
and afford a hike for those who like to get out into the open country, as well as
affording objective points of interest and collections for the naturalists. The tang of
the camp-ﬁre meal is well known to all Collembolas.

At the semi-monthly meetings a considerable number of well-known speakers have
been heard, including Professors Jennings, Fish, Collins, Emerson and Leighton of the
Pitt faculty; Dr. Ortmann, Mr. Sutton, Mr. Henn, Mr. Coggeshall, and Mr. Holt from
the Carnegie Museum; and others not connected with these institutions, as Miss Ladoff,
Mr. Grizzly Smith, and Mr. Baldwin, who represents the Inland Bird Banding Asso-
ciation, with headquarters at the Cleveland Museum.

The Collembola custom of serving a dinner before the meeting, has met with well-
deserved success, having an attendance of from twenty-ﬁve to thirty. Since the atten-
dance at the meetings proper is somewhat larger than this, the founders of the club are
greatly encouraged, and feel that the Collembola Club is rapidly becoming the most
active and best supported club of its type on the Pitt campus.

The publications of the club include the Collembola Bulletin which carries notices
of the meetings and the trips, and the Collembola Song Book, a compilation. of old and
new biological ditties together with some songs of local interest.

Because of the “Collembola Spirit” instilled in the members of _the organization,
and the advantages that the students gain from ﬁeld acquaintance with forms studied
in the laboratories, the club has had most generous support from the biological faculty

members. Prof. Fish has granted to the club meeting space, and many other facilities
for “carrying on,” besides his personal interest. Professor Jennings is a Collembola
“old-timer,” and Dr. Emerson and Mr. Cartledge are known as the “god-fathers” of

the club; Prof. Leighton has been unanimously elected a member of the club, while
many others have “done their bit.”

At the time this report is written, the University of Pittsburgh Debating Associa-
tion is in the midst of its schedule. The membership of the Association includes forty-

five men and thirty women; competitions for almost each debate.are open to all these,
and indeed to any undergraduate who may want to try for a place in the chief intellectual

activity of the University. '

At the beginning of the season, Louis Broida, a former star debater at Pitt and now
a prominent member of the Pittsburgh bar, resumed duties as coach. The ﬁrst contest

of the year was a triangular affair with Washington and Jefferson College and Penn-
sylvania State College. The negative‘ team for Pitt, composed of Martin Silverman,

Myron Broida and George »W. Davis traveled to State College only to lose a close
decision; and at home, James M. Barnett, Nathan Perilman, and Anthony W. Smith, III,
successfully upheld the aﬂirmative against Washington and Jelterson College. The
question was: Resolved, That the United States should enter the Permanent Court
of International Justice under the reservations as stated by Secretary Hughes.

By the time of the second debate, Mr. Broido had found his legal duties too
pressing to permit him to continue coaching, and Dr. H. A. Wichelns, Faculty Advisor,
took over the duties of coach. The team that opposed Colgate on continuance of the
three-percent immigration law consisted of Earle Aronson, David Silverblatt, and James
Mierely. Colgate proved the superior.

The thirdforensic meeting of the year was an innovation; it was a forum discussion

_ with Swarthmore College on the Bok Peace Plan; there was no decision for either
school as each had one representative on each side of the question. Anthony W. Smith,
III, defended the plan, and Lytron A. Scholpp opposed it. After the formal speeches,
there were speeches and questions from the ﬂoor; and in handling the latter the Pitt
men had an excellent opportunity to display their quickness in rebuttal.

Contests are still to come with Syracuse, Westminster, Allegheny, and George-
town, each on its home ﬂoor. James, M. Barnett, George W. Davis, and Nathan Peril-
man will represent the University at Syracuse and at Westminster. The question
discussed at both schools will be, Resolved, That the United States should enter the
Permanent Court of International Justice under the reservations as stated" by Secretary
Hughes. The freshmen will have a special debate with the freshmen of Penn State
College on the League of Nations question. George Washington University will come
to Pittsburgh and discuss the limitation of the powers of the Supreme Court question.
In addition Pitt will have a representative in the Civic Oratorical League and in the
Western Pennsylvania Oratorical Association.

The Inter-Fraternity Council of the University of Pittsburgh, composed of two
representatives of each of the sixteen leading social fraternities on the campus, functions
to-promote better feeling and a closer relationship among the fraternities and between
the fraternities and the University. The present Council is the result of a reorganiza-
tion meeting of the old Council on March 2, 1920.

Each year the Inter-Fraternity Council, with the cooperation of the Athletic‘ Asso-
ciation of the University, conducts the Inter-Fraternity Track and Field contests, and
the Inter-Fraternity Basketball Series. ~

The leading social function of the school years in Inter-Fraternity circles, is the
Inter-Fraternity Ball, held under the auspices of the Council, while each year, with the
aid of the Young Men’s Christian Association. the Council has an annual non-fraternity
man's smoker, and an Inter-Fraternity Smoker once a month at one of the local chapter
houses.

Each year a large Loving Cup, the gift of Dean Fetterman, is awarded the Fraternity
having the highest scholastic average in the Council for the previous year.

A set of rules has been drawn up which govern the rushing and pledging of fresh-
men to fraternities that are members of the Council.

The Pan-Hellenic Association of the University of Pittsburgh is a local chapter of
the National organization to regulate affairs of inter-fraternity interest. The local asso-
ciation is composed of one senior, one junior and one alumnae member from each
Fraternity. They make the rushing rules each year and see that they are enforced.

The first Pan-Hellenic Association at Pitt was organized in 1910, and since then it
has steadily grown until at present it consists of thirteen national fraternities and three
local fraternities. '

Ten years have passed since the birthday of,Pitkin Club. .To celebrate its tenth‘
anniversary a supper and good fellowship service was held in the Shadyside Presbyterian
Church, February 3. In addition to the present members, a great‘ number of the former‘
members, including the founders, were present. It has been the greatest meeting this
historic club has held.

;, In accordance with the purpose of the club, which is to study the various mission
ﬁelds and their needs, and to promote an interest in Christian work, the first semester
was devoted to the study of Japan, and the Club is now studying the life of Christ under
the inspiring leadership of Dr. Hugh T. Kerr. '

Pitt Players is the campus organization for the production of amateur dramatics.
It provides an opportunity to receive training in serious dramatic effort and in the
artistic presentation of meritorious plays. Through its numerous offerings during the
1923-24 season, it has enabled practically all of its members to gain some experience in
at least one branch of the work—acting, staging, costuming, and managing.

The privilege of membership is granted to students who successfully display their
ability in the tryouts held annually each fall, and who continue to show marked interest
in the work of the organization during the year. Those who have no desire to take
roles, but who are interested in the mechanics of stage craft may become affiliated with
the organization by serving an apprenticeship during which ability and sincerity of
purpose may be demonstrated.

During the 1923-24 season, Pitt Players underwent a complete reorganization and
initiated a policy that has resulted in increased activity. ‘Jerome K. Jerome’s “The
New Lady Bantock” was the ﬁrst production, and was followed by Arthur Hopkin’s
“Moonshine;” “Matinata,” by Lawrence Langner; “The Conﬂict,” by Ballette McCauley;
Stuart Walker's, “The Medicine Show;” “Mrs. Molly,” by Rachel Crothers; and
“Fourteen,” Alice Gerstenberg. In the spring, A. A. Milne’s well-known “Mr. Pim
Passes By” was taken on a tour through western Pennsylvania previous to its appear-
ance on the campus. . ,

Pitt Player productions have been utilized by numerous campus organizations this
year on their entertainment programs. Dean Thyrsa Amos, the VVornen’s Association,
Omicron Delta Kappa Fraternity, the Faculty Club, and the College Club and others
have been served in this capacity.

“Pitt Week” was inaugurated at the University in 1923. It was the hope of its
sponsors that a “play week” for all Pitt students and Alumni would strengthen Pitt
spirit by making this occasion traditional in the University.

Although in its infancy, “Pitt Week” is already an institution and has done much
toward endearing Alma Mater to all Pitties.

The Pumas Club, an organization composed of Master Masons connected with the
University of Pittsburgh, was organized in November, 1920‘. In May, 1921, the Pumas

Club became national in character by its afﬁliation with the National League of Masonic

Clubs.

The club strives to strengthen the “Pitt Spirit,” aims to further the ideals of the
institution, work for the general betterment, and for a more tangible good, rather than

mere social prestige.

The Student Council was organized in the spring of 1923. when the students of the
University voted to disband the Student Senate and replace it with the Student Body.
of which Student Council is the Executive Committee. Student Council has authority
to act in all matters pertaining to both men and women students, exclusive of those
which fall under the immediate jurisdiction of the faculty. It conducts student assem-
blies, conducts University dances, appoints special committees, and makes recommen-
dations to the administration with regard to student interests.

The Turtle Club, established at Pitt several years ago, is the first organization of
its kind on the campus. The first chapter of Turtles was installed at the University of
Illinois in 1890. The fratority composed of fraternity men and women, was organized
tor the purpose of creating school spirit and encouraging fraternity and inter-fraternity
relations. The club is purely social in nature, and evey year a program of affairs is
carried out. This year, a pledge part, a dance at the Peacock Mansion, a swimming
party, and a joint dance with the Framasors ﬁlled the Turtles social calendar.

The Young Women’s Christian Association exists to be of service in the all—round
development of the women of the university. To their collegiate education it adds the
training in Christian fellowship and service which makes for fuller life. In its weekly
meetings, its Bible study classes, its discussion groups the Y. W. C. A. aims to bring
before the girls a new outlook on race relations, on War and Peace, on life "in general.
In all, these meetings are for the: purpose of developing and deepening the spiritual life.

The deﬁnite work of the Y. W. C. A., besides those things already mentioned, is
divided among the different committees. In the social service twenty-eight girls have
been doing volunteer work in the different settlement houses. Important, too, is the
Big and Little Sister movement which assists Freshmen girls in getting pleasantly and
happily adjusted to university life. The social department develops fellowship and
friendliness among the women students.

The whole desire of the Y. W. C. A. is to help the girls throughout the year to be
their best selves.

The university branch of the Young Men’s Christian Association was founded in
1911, and has rapidly enlarged its sphere of activity since that 'time’.'~' Helping the men
to attain the best in life, encouraging a larger expression of Christianity on‘ the campus,
and training for lives of Christian welfare, the “Y” is dedicated to a program of service.’

The activities of the Association are directed by the student cabinet, of which the
oﬂicers are elected annually by the members of the Association. The president appoints
the members of the cabinet, and each cabinet member appoints a committee to aid in
the execution of the Association's program. The general administration is vested in a
Committee of Management, composed of students, alumni, faculty, and trustees of the
University. An executive secretary has general supervision of the hut and of all activities.

The Open Forum, the Senior Counselor system, the annual Basketball Banquet,
deputation teams to neighboring churches, Bible-study groups, publication of the uni-
versity handbook, and many other activities are directed by the Association.

The Women’s Self Government Association has a three-fold purpose; to foster
among its members a spirit of unity and loyalty to the University, to maintain high
5 standards of academic and social life, and to regulate all matters pertaining to the
student life of its members. The association is governed by an executive, a legislative
and a judicial body. I

W. S. G. A. publishes “The Question Mark” which appears on the campus at least
four times a year and contains many things of interest to University students in general
and women in particular. The “Vade Mecum,” a handbook for new women students is
published yearly.

The \/Vomen’s Athletic Association has had a most successful year, due to the
efﬁcient cooperation between the W. A. A. Board and Miss Margaret McClenahan, who
is the director of Physical Education for Women and the advisor of the association.

In the fall a Co-ed Prom was given at the Heinz House at which the upper class
Co—eds appeared as “dashing heroes” and the Frosh Co-eds as “bashful misses.” Two
beneﬁt bridges were held by the association. one in November at the Kappa Alpha Theta
House, and the other at McCreery’s in April.

Class spirit ran high at all times during the hockey season. The Freshmen won the
championship, downing the Sophs by a 4-1 score. \V. A. A. now turned its attention
to basketball. The Varsity team boasts of a good record, winning seven games and losing
one. Inter-class, and inter-class-intercollegiate games were played with Tech. The
Spring season ﬁnds W. A. A. ready to further track, swimming and tennis. The following
are the present ofﬁcers and Board members:

Mary Bigham . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .President

The Pitt Panther was founded in 1878 by a group of humorously inclined under-
graduates including Carlton Ketchum, Sid Hoehl, Lou Broido, G. M. P. Baird, George
Ketchum and sundry other light-minded gentlemen. Its dizzy career has continued
down through the decades, halting only for major wars and plagues. Editor after editor
has fallen by the way but Panther has marched onward, laughing‘ at life in general.

The present year, the Panther has been goaded along by C. V. Starrett, ’24, as
Editor-in-Chief, and held in leash by Charles L. Garson, Jr., ’24, Business Manager. The
above gentlemen were ably assisted by the following staff members:_ L. E. Irwin, '.’.;'

Assistant Editor; Advisory Council, F. P. Mayer, Faculty; H. E. Reppert, ’23; H. J.
Crossland, ’26; Don Schmadel, ’25; Exchange Editor, John V. VVatkins, ’25; Art Staff.

PITT WEEKLY

The Pitt Weekly is the ofﬁcial student and alumni journal of the university. It is
published every Wednesday, thirty-ﬁve times during the academic year, and is circulated
to over 8,000 students and alumni of the University of Pittsburgh.

The Weekly was ﬁrst published in 1910, and was preceded by “The College Journal”
(1875-1882), “The Pennsylvania Western” (1882-1888), and “The University Courant”
(1888-1910), all monthly literary publications. Since its inception the Weekly has
always been an important and powerful factor in inﬂuencing undergraduate life.

Positions on the editorial and business staffs of the Weekly are competitive, reporters
and assistants being chosen on merit and work printed, from the ﬁeld of candidates in
the annual fall and spring elections. Promotion to the higher editorial and managerial
positions are made on_ length of service and ability. The editor—in-chief, managing
editor and business manager are chosen in April, on recommendation of the retiring
heads, to the Weekly Advisory Board.

Despite the prevalent disbelief in prophecies, the one made by Chairman “Johnny"
Stewart, that this year’s Inter-Fraternity Ball would be one of the “best ever” variety,
certainly came true to the letter. Perhaps it was due to the fact that Dan Cupid was at
large the evening of February 14, in the Hotel Schenley, piercing the hearts of Greeks
with darts tipped with merriment and good fellowship.

This year, the Inter—Frat_ernity Ball, which is the initial event of the social season
at the University, proved to be a huge success. The appropriate St. Valentine’s Day
decorations were made more effective by a.novel, lighting system and everyone “danced
the light fantastic” to the tunes of Auchenbach’s Orchestra from State College. ‘

MY DEAR PEGGY :—

You see that I have not forgotten my promise to write and tell you all about our"

Junior Prom of the class of twenty—ﬁve. It was simply wonderful! I know that you
are just dying to hear all the details of this, our premiere social function of the year,
so I shall begin at the very beginning. .

At nine-thirty, Friday evening, March seventh, in the Hotel Schenley, the three
hundred couples who had already arrived, formed into line for the_ Grand March. The
latter was lead by Chairman Harold Akins with Miss Anne Hocking. Then we
promenaded all around the ball room and had a grand time. And the favors—what do
you suppose they were? Well, you’ll never guess so I’ll tell you. They were the
duckiest little, sterling silver perfume vials you have ever seen; and the best part of
all is that one can wear them! We all agreed that they were the best thing yet, so I
guess they were.

The decorations were so different—and clever, too. The ceiling of the Schenley
was lowered by a mass of blue and gold crepe paper streamers, intermingled with myriads
of vari—colored balloons, and there was a huge Japanese parasol in the very center.
Can you imagine anything quite so fascinating?

It is needless to describe the music, for the orchestra was that heavenly one from
Altoona—the Rainbow Serenaders. Then at the stroke of midnight we all tore out to
the diningroom and consumed chicken croquettes and giggled over the “Prom Pom,”
which was simply killing.

It seems as though I have just about exhausted my subject, Peggy, so I will close
as I am dead tired.

Pan-Hellenic, the women’s annual inter-fraternity formal was held Thursday evening,
April 10, in the Hotel Schenley. Not even the most profound cynic could have doubted
the sincerity" and friendship displayed among the co-eds -of various fraternities during
this evening of their joint frolic.

Palms and fraternity banners composed the decorations, giving the ball room a
“snappy” collegiate appearance. Attractive favors, small black leather key cases, were
given to the men. _

Fraternities arranging the affair were as follows: Zeta Tau Alpha, Kappa Alpha
Theta, Phi Mu, Pi Beta Phi, Theta Gamma Phi, and Alpha Delta Pi.

What Engineering

Owes to the Imagination

 

ACK in the days when wire-
less was just beginning to
spread, Frank Conrad (now
Assistant Chief Engineer of the
“lestinghouse Electric & Manu-
facturing Company) and another
official, happened to compare
watches, to see if it was time to
go back to work. Their watches
diﬂ'ered.

Unable to convince his friend
that his watch was right, Mr.
Conrad suddenly remembered
that the naval station at Arling-
ton, Va., had just inaugurated
a system for sending out daily

time signals by radio. Just the thing to prove

his point!

From An Argument Over
Watches Came KDKA

summoned to the ofﬁce of Harry Phillips
Davis. Vice President of the company.

‘‘Frank,’' said l\Ir. Davis, “I‘m going to
close your radio station." His attention had
been attracted the night before to a simple
note in a full-page advertisement, which read,
“Mr. Conrad will send out phonograph music
this evening."

You know the rest. In November, 1920,
"KDKA” was formally opened to send out
election returns. It had received the first
license issued by Uncle Sam. Today over 500
broadcasting stations entertain and educate
millions of people each night, a wonderful
result from so insigniﬁcant an argument as
one over Watches.

So he built a simple set of receiving apparatus,
erected an aerial, and-you can imagine what
happened! He was badly bitten by the radio bug.
After proving to his satisfaction the accuracy of his
watch, he started experimenting with the trans-
mission of music by radio, with good success.

He began sending out phonograph music from
his home, and attracted the attention of some of
the big department stores, that had installed radio
departments. They in turn, started advertising
Mr. Conrad's “musical evenings."

Then, one day, upon arriving at his desk, he was

0/4 New ‘Ritter ‘Book

“CRITTER PRACTICE BUILDING

SUGGESTIONS”, a book for
thinkers who are interested in success.
Over 200 pages full of practical sug-
gestions for your assistance in establishing
and building a successful dental practice.
-Many successful careers owe their start to

a simple sound suggestion. This book
contains hundreds of them.

A successful practice cannot be guar-
anteed by anyone. That is an intang-
ible thing inﬂuenced by your own per-
sonal characteristics. We can, however,
offer suggestions that will help you suc-
ceed. This we have done, in a concrete
helpful way, in “RITTER PRACTICE
BUILDING SUGGESTIONS.”

One copy of the students’ edition of
this book will be presented to each grad-
uating student in all dental colleges this
year. To obtain your copy you have
only to attend our exhibit at your college,
particulars of which will be sent to you
later.

Serving

Transportation
ESTINGHOUSE Air Brakes

provide the element of con-
trol which is necessary to insure
safe operation of steam and electric
railways, and are rapidly becoming
no less essential in thefield of
heavy motor transportation.

Serving the transportation needs of
the world, in respect to brakes, has
required the development of a great
industrial organization, founded on
a branch of engineering which is
fascinating in its problems and
attractive in opportunity.

Each year, at our great Wilmerding
plant, the largest of its kind in the
world, we train a limited number of
technically-educated young men
for places of responsibility in our
organization, and inquiries are
invited from college students
interested in becoming Air Brake
engineers through the special
apprentice course we offer.

THE INCORRIGIBLE GAMBLER

Thirty negroeswere brought before the
Justice of the Peace to answer to the
charge of gaming.

Quite a few had been disposed of when
the case of Johnnie Jones’ was called.

“Johnnie Jones here?" the judge asked.

"Yessah, Judge. I'se right here,” the Ne-
gro replied.

“Guilty or not guilty. Johnnie?”

“Judge," the Negro said moanfully,
“whenever there’s a crap game, I'se ter-
rible guil\ty."——Hnu.n‘mz Post.

VVHAT IS THE ANSVVER?

Smith (on the ocean steamer)——Going
across old chap?

Br0wn—Yes, are you ?—Ln/tiglz Burr.

The Dental School has probably had a more rapid growth than any similar institu-
tion in the world.

It was founded April 20, 1896, under the name of the Pittsburgh Dental College
and from the beginning was associated with the Western University of Pennsylvania.
In 1904 the Pittsburgh Dental College became an organic part of the University of
Pittsburgh and the name was changed to School of Dentistry.

In 1912 the enrollment was one hundred sixty-ﬁve; for the current year, 1923-24,
the enrollment is eight hundred ninety. The school has ranked as the largest dental

school in the world for a number of years, andoccupies a foremost position among
dental educational institutions.

In the several ratings of dental schools made by the Dental Educational Council of
America, the latest of which was in 1923, the school has always been put in class “A.”
The school has had a State Board record during the last nine years of over ninety-nine
per cent. passed. The Faculty and teaching stat? have grown from twenty-nine mem-

I bers in 1912 to one hundred members in 1923-24. The school occupies three buildings
on the campus and is in urgent need of additional quarters.

The library of the school contains more than ﬁve thousand bound volumes and
upwards of twenty thousand unbound dental journals.

The entering class in the fall of 1924, will be the last class to enter on high school
preparation. One year of college work will be required for entrance beginning with the
fall of 1925.

More than ﬁfty—eight thousand patients were treated in the Dental Inﬁrmary during
the college year of 1922-23 and a noticeably larger number of patients are applying for
treatment during the current year.
