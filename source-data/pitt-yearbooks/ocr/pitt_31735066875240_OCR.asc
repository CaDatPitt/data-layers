REFLECTION

t's been only four years since we came to

Pitt, clutching a campus map and searching

for the corner of Forbes and Bigelow. But

since that time, we've grown into confident
adults ready to enter the real world.

The years we've spent at Pitt have been marked
by historic moments. When global leaders
gathered in our city for the (3-20 Summit, when
"Snowpoca|ypse ZOIO" shut down our campus
for a record three days, when a Steelers Super
Bowl win caused a riot in the heart of Oakland,
we were there.

We came to Pitt with one common goal: to get
a degree. l-lowever, we've all gotten much more
than that. l-lere at Pitt, we've found our niches,
our friends, and our purpose in life. It may have
been only four years, but during that time, Pitt
became our home. As we continue our lives
outside Pitt, we'll ﬁnd new homes and make new
friends, but we always will remain Pitt Panthers.

Hail to Pitt!

Pitt: A History

IN THE PAST

he University of Pittsburgh has fostered

some of the brightest, most intelligent

minds ofthe modern era throughout

its many years. Alumni and faculty
members such as Jonas Sall<, Charles Glen King,
Reginald Fessenden. and Freddie Fu have all been
pioneers in their respective fields.

Originally called the Pittsburgh Academy, Pitt
stands as one of the oldest institutions of higher
education west of the Allegheny Mountains.
Now a nationally known institution in research

and athletics, it began in a humble one—room cabin,
a replica of which is still located on campus.

In I909, Pitt adopted the panther as its official
mascot, the ﬁrst university to do so. The panther’s
natural gold color and its presence in Western
Pennsylvania—not to mention clever alliteration
—made it the perfect match for the University
of Pittsburgh.

Carolyn Boucel<

    

Pitt has been home to many innovators,
.2» such as Jonas Salk, whose team pioneered
the polio vaccine.

Our Uncommon  

 

COMMONS ROOM

he old adage “There may be more than

meets the eye" rings especially true for

the Cathedral of Learning. Hidden just

inside the front doors lies a striking
area: the Commons Room.

Sometimes referred to as the “Harry Potter
room," the Commons Room is four stories
tall and features intricate woodwork and
stonework. The noticeable ornamental gate
stands I8 feet tall and was designed by Samuel
Yellin. Beauty aside, the room also is very
functional; students regularly ﬁll the Commons
Room to do homework, study, eat lunch, or talk
with friends.

    

UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH 0

As students study in the Commons Room, few
may know that where they sit may actually be the
same place Jonas Salk stood in I957, inoculating
Pittsburghers with his new polio vaccine. This
contrast of everyday student life and significant
historical events is what makes the Commons
Room unique.

The Commons Room. central to the University's
identity, brings history and modern education
together.

neo-Gothic architecture

within their walls. Not only do these rooms
function as classrooms, they also represent and
recognize the creative achievements and rich
heritage of various cultures from every part
ofthe globe.

From whispered tales of a spirit that haunts the
Early American Room during Halloween to the
magniﬁcent traditional decorations that adorn
the rooms with the arrival of the winter holidays,
the Nationality Rooms are not just cultural relics.
They represent the spirit of the University and
of Pitt students as together we strive for greatness.

 he beautiful Heinz Memorial Chapel,
a University of Pittsburgh landmark,
was originally a gift to Pitt. Benefactor

mother by dedicating the building to her. Today,
Heinz Chapel is a nondenominational chapel that
is a frequent site for services, weddings, concerts,
and events.

    

Begun in I933, the chapel was designed to highlight
its spectacular 23 stained glass windows. The
windows depict 39l identifiable figures ranging
from ancient and biblical figures to modern
scientists and political leaders. The main attraction

 

   

HEIZ MEMORIAL Cl-lEL

ofthe chapel is its set of73—foot transept windows,
among the tallest in the world, which represent
tolerance, courage, temperance, and truth.

While the structure of Heinz Chapel has remained
primarily untouched since its completion in I938,
adjustments have been made to accommodate
visitors in wheelchairs, and the organ has been
replaced twice in the chapels lifetime.

WILLIAM PITTT UNION

n essential part ota college campus

is a place that brings the student

body together. Nestled between

Forbes and Fifth avenues stands the
William Pitt Union, a central hub for students at
the University of Pittsburgh.

Built in I898, the Schenley Hotel once hosted
celebrities and presidents in its decorative rooms,
some of which were adorned with marble and
chandeliers. ln I956, the University acquired the
hotel, converting it ﬁrst into a residence hall and
later into its current identity.

Today, more than 3OO student organizations call
the William Pitt Union home. ln addition to
ofﬁces, there also are classrooms and even dance

studios where hotel beds used to be. The main
floor has retained much ofthe original splendor
ofthe past, including two ballrooms and a large
marble lobby. The ground floor, once neglected,
now has been renovated and houses a central
dining area.

The William Pitt Union is the center of student
life and organizations; culture, art, and education
have found a home in its walls. The union will
remain an integral part of our campus for as long
as there are students to enjoy it.

PlTl' LANDMARKS

he Cathedral of Learning towers over

Oakland, in sight of anyone in the

neighborhood. But under the shadow

ofthe neo—Gothic building is a bevy
of landmarks that come to mind whenever
students think of Oakland.

A quick walk from campus buildings like the
William Pitt Union and Hillman Library, Schenley
Plaza is an inviting patch of nature. When the
weather is warm and sunny, students head over
to the grassy lawn to sunbathe, enjoy bubble tea,
and catch up on their reading.

 

Dunkin’ Donuts is another popular student
destination. Located right next to the Litchﬁeld
Towers, Dunkin' Donuts is a new addition to
campus life. Although it only opened during the
summer of 20lO, it has quickly become part of
students’ routines.

Pitt’s mascot may be the panther, but “Dippy” the
dinosaur is another animal students associate with
Oakland. Standing 22 feet tall, the public sculpture
outside the Carnegie Museum of Natural History
overlooks Schenley Plaza.

Pitt has many remarkable buildings like Heinz
Memorial Chapel and the Cathedral of Learning.
But for students who have made Oakland their
home, many other landmarks come to mind
when they think of Pitt.

time is spent in Hillman Library

Women gather for Lantern Night, one of the
University of Pittsburgh's many traditions.

LANTERN NIGHT

he night before the ﬁrst day of classes

of each fall term, freshman and transfer

women gather to participate in Lantern

Night, sponsored by the Pitt Alumni
Association's Alumnae Council.

Established in I920, when the admittance of
women was rare, Lantern Night is one ofthe
oldest traditions on campus. At this ceremony,
participants are given lanterns that symbolize

the beginning ofa long journey toward education.
Alumni, including mothers and grandmothers of
ﬂrst—year women, are invited to be the flame

bearers who symbolically pass their knowledge
on to the next generation of Pitt women by giving
them the “light of learning."

The ceremony has moved several times
throughout the years, eventually settling in its
current home, l-leinz Memorial Chapel, in
order to accommodate the increasing number
of female students. After the ceremony, the
students and flame bearers proceed with
lanterns lit to the Cathedral of Learning
Commons Room.

THE CITY IS OUR CAMPUS

t all began with a log cabin, but more than

220 years later, the University of Pittsburgh

has evolved into the much larger campus

of today. Although students enjoy the I32
acres of campus, they call the entire city of
Pittsburgh home.

With Pittsburgh as their campus, students are
not limited to Oakland for entertainment.

The Waterfront, a shopping complex in Homestead,
Pa., is a popular destination for weekend shoppers.
A quick hop on a Port Authority bus and students
can forget about next week's exam and focus

on this week's clearance. The Waterfront isn't all

 

24

about the shopping; a movie theater and popular
chain restaurants ensure that all students will find
something to do.

Home to the SouthSide Works, another shop-
ping complex, the South Side offers quick enter-
tainment only a couple of miles from campus.
Squirrel Hill and Shadyside offer ethnic restau-
rants sure to tempt any palate. Downtown is a
bustling spot of businesses and towering buildings,
and the North Side is home to sports stadiums
and art museums like the Andy Warhol Museum
and the Mattress Factory.

The Students’ Voice

STUDENT GOVERNMENT BOARD

he members ofthe University of

Pittsburgh Student Government

Board (SGB) serve as representatives

ofthe student body and as liaisons
to the University's administration and the
Pittsburgh community.

Led by its president and eight board members,
SGB is a functioning board that oversees many
aspects of student life.

Responsible for the spending of the activities fee
students pay each term, the board meets every
week to allocate funds to various student orga-
nizations. The organizations request funding for

   

community service opportunities

conferences, speakers, and other expenses,

and the board votes on the allotment amount.
Not only does SGB deal with fiscal issues, it also
takes an interest in the political pull ofthe student
body. During 20lO, SGB created a student vote
coalition, a committee dedicated to registering
students to vote and improving voter turnout.

With committees devoted to addressing envi-
ronmental concerns, public relations, academic
affairs, Pitt traditions, and more, SGB has a hand
in every aspect of student life.

FRATERNITIES

any students change as they go
through college. Those who join
fraternities change into community
leaders committed to service

and philanthropy.

 

Although fraternities have a stigma of being
party houses, it's the contrary at Pitt. Fraternities
help to develop their members‘ commitment to
excellence. They also shape members to be the
best they can be, both socially and academically.
Alpha Phi Alpha, Pitt's first Black fraternity, is
focused on improving the lives of not only its
male members but women as well. ln the past,

30

 

the organization has held the Miss Black and Gold
pageant to celebrate the actions and confidence
of young Black women.

The lnterfraternity Council, Collegiate Panhellenic
Association, and National Pan—l-lellenic Council"
the three governing bodies at Pitt—band together
to organize the Pitt Dance Marathon, a 24-hour
dance contest for the student body. In previous
years, the proceeds from the fundraising event went
to the University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute.

Students can receive a great education at Pitt.
Fraternities take it one step further by providing
members with an education that can only be
taught through brotherhood.

SORO RlTlES

ororities at Pitt are communities of
women who continually strive to im-
prove the community and themselves.

The Collegiate Panhellenic Association represents
I3 of the sororities at Pitt. These organizations
aren't just ways for women at Pitt to build
their résumés and develop leadership skills. The
sororities also make many contributions to the
Pitt community.

Although sororities foster leadership skills and
lifelong friendships, one ofthe best aspects of
Greek life is its dedication to philanthropy. Many
sororities host events to fundraise for a specific

UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH 0

charity, such as a male talent and beauty contest
to raise money for cystic ﬁbrosis research.

Sororities also work together to plan philanthropic
events. When they combine forces for charity
events, such as dodgeball tournaments or dance
competitions, these women further enhance
their influence on the Pitt community.

At Pitt, joining a sorority doesn't mean becoming
just another member of Greek life. These women
and future community leaders enter a world of
true friendship and philanthropy.

participate in many service projects throughout
Pittsburgh and the nation.

Students looking for a longer commitment can
sign up for Alternative Break, which sends
students to national locations in need of help
during spring break, or they can participate in
jumpstart Pittsburgh, which trains college
students to become mentors in the national early
childhood literacy program.

College isn't just about homework and
socializing. For some students, it's also about

making a difference.

be found on the fourth floor of the

William Pitt Union. There, students
with a creative edge promote news, music, and
culture through a variety of mediums.

The Pitt News, an independent, student—run
newspaper, is a daily paper that covers all
University happenings. Free for anyone walking
through campus, the paper has the latest
information about sports, entertainment,

and news. During the (3-20 Summit in 2009,
The Pitt News gained notice for breaking news
about the meeting via Twitter faster than

city papers.

Panther Prints is another publication in which
students can gain media experience. Students
write, shoot, and design an almost 200—page
book that chronicles life at the University of
Pittsburgh. With glossy color photographs on
every page, the bool<—given to graduating

A Second Home

DORM LIFE

ollege is a monumental transition for

students, but perhaps the biggest

change of all is the living situation.

Moving away from parents to live
with complete strangers can be daunting, but
Pitt makes sure that those strangers soon
become family.

A room at Pitt is guaranteed for all freshmen
admitted through the Ofﬁce of Admissions and
Financial Aid. While most students end up in the
Litchﬂeld Towers, there are four other residence
halls that freshmen call home. In fall 20lO, the
spaces Pitt reserved for freshmen were not
enough to accommodate all of them, and some
moved into Oal<land's Wyndham hotel.

UNlVERSlTY OF PITTSBURGH O

Nestled in the heart of campus, Schenley Quad
is host to eight dormitories, including the
Litchﬁeld Towers. There, students enjoy the
proximity to ﬁtness centers, cafeterias, and the
Book Center. Regardless of what year students
are, the Office of Residence Life, part of the
Division of Student Affairs, works to make dorm
life a social and educational experience.

At Pitt, living in a dorm isn't just a milestone. It's
also an opportunity for students to make friends

and establish Pitt as their home.

Dorms become a home away from home for
students at the University of Pittsburgh.

Buying food is a responsibility
for students who live off campus
and don't have meal plans.

APARTMENT LIVING

espite the convenience, the allure of

a cafeteria well within walking distance

isn't enough to keep some students

on campus. Luckily for them, Oakland
is full of off—campus housing that makes their col-
lege experience at Pitt just as rewarding as dorm
life—and they don’t have to share a bathroom
with 40 other students.

Striking out on one’s own is just as much a learn-
ing experience as taking courses at Pitt. Students

have to balance checkbooks, pay bills, and scrub
kitchen floors. The added responsibility helps
students to transition into adulthood.

South Oakland is a popular place for students
to reside. Usually just a lO—minute walk to cam-
pus, streets like Semple, Bates, and Meyran are
full of Pitt students in apartments and houses.

Although students may have to wake up a little
earlier than their on—campus classmates in order
to get to class on time, living off campus is still

a rewarding experience.

INTERNSHIPS AND RESEARCH

etting a degree from the University of
Pittsburgh is a great start for students
looking to establish a long and successful
career. lnternships and research
experience are ways for students to build upon
that success and experience the working world.

Numerous programs within the University are
available to students looking for internships.
The Career Development Office within the
Division of Student Affairs works with students
to help them become as marketable as possible;
landing an internship is part ofthe process.
FutureLinks is an online career management
system that lists job postings exclusive to Pitt
students and alumni.

    

An environment rich in research provides
undergraduates with opportunities to work

with some ofthe best faculty in the nation. Not
only are students exposed to the nation's finest
research, but students conducting independent
research also have the chance to apply for
ﬁnancial support through the Brackenridge
Summer Research and Chancellor's Undergraduate
Research fellowships.

A degree from Pitt is valuable. Combine that
degree with experience and a student is bound
for success.

Many ofﬁces in Pittsburgh,

such as those of City Councilman
Bill Peduto and ESPN, offer
internships for students.

a click away. Ask a Librarian is an online instant
messaging system that connects students with a
reference librarian. Students also can reach librarians
by text, e—mail, or telephone or in person.

During one's four years at the University of
Pittsburgh, professors will assign countless projects,

A Global Perspective

STUDY ABROAD AND UCIS

hrough the Study Abroad Office,
students at the University of Pittsburgh
experience the customs and lifestyles
of people all over the world. Offering
numerous program options that send students
to more than IOO countries, the office takes the
idea of broadening the cultural horizons of college
students literally.

Study abroad experiences give students the
opportunity to learn about another culture through
the eyes of its own people. Those who choose
to study abroad gain the advantage of having an
international education in an increasingly globalized
world. The lessons students learn through study
abroad experiences often prove to be invaluable
and life changing.

Italy and Germany are popular destinations
for students studying abroad.

70

If students aren't able to study abroad during their
stay at Pitt, the University Center for lnternational
Studies (UCIS) provides unique opportunities for
global education. In conjunction with various
University departments and programs, UCIS
awards area studies certiﬁcates through centers
like the Asian Studies Center, Center for Latin
American Studies, and European Union Center
of Excellence/European Studies Center.

The encounters that students accumulate while
pursuing global education become unforgettable
and intrinsic parts of their college experience—

experiences impossible without Pitt's strong support.

cases, at a discount or entirely free.

The Carnegie Museums of Art and Natural l-listory

collections and changing exhibits. For those more
interested in nature itself, Phipps Conservatory

Andy Warhol Museum, renowned and famous,
is just a bus ride away and is completely free for
Pitt students.

Affordable and accessible, museums around
Pittsburgh are frequented by all kinds of students
for all kinds of reasons. Whether it is for class or
personal pleasure, going to the museum is a great
way to enjoy a different side of Pittsburgh, one not
to be missed.

GREEN SPACE

hough Pitt is located in the middle of
an urban jungle, there are plenty of
green spots nearby

Point State Park, a sprawling expanse of grass and
trees, sits at the convergence of the Allegheny,
Ohio, and Monongahela rivers. Designated

a National Historic Landmark, Point State Park
honors the history ofthe location during the
French and Indian War. On World Environment
Day in 20lO, Point State Park became the setting
for more than l,7OO canoes and kayaks paddling
on the three rivers that set a new world record
for the largest canoe and kayak flotilla.

 

Many students walk by Schenley Plaza every day,
but the lawn across from Hillman Library is only
a small portion ofa vast civic park. Spanning
456 acres, Schenley Park has numerous facilities
on site, such as Phipps Conservatory and the
Schenley Oval Sportsplex, that offer entertainment
for anyone strolling through the park. Outdoors
lovers can experience nature at its ﬁnest by hiking
through Schen|ey’s expansive meadows and trails.

The city provides many conveniences, but when
students are looking for something a little greener,

nature is only a quick walk or ride away.

Winter Wonderland

WINTER AT Pl'l—l'

inter weather can be difﬁcult to
deal with, but Oakland offers Pitt
students many ways to enjoy the
winter season.

 

Even though winter weather can be a pain, it also
can be a blessing in disguise. In February of 20lO.
a huge snowstorm, dubbed “Snowpocalypse,"
cancelled classes for three days during Allegheny
County's state of emergency, setting a new
school record for number of consecutive days
of cancelled classes.

   
  
  
  

When classes are cancelled, students have plenty
of ways to entertain themselves. Students can stay
warm inside the Cathedral of Learning by exploring
the Nationality Rooms decorated in each country's
holiday traditions. For students who don't mind
braving the frigid temperatures. the Cathedral lawn
is the perfect place for building snowmen or having
snowball ﬁghts with friends.

Off campus, Schenley Park is just a short walk away

and offers places for students to go sledding as well
as an ice rink.

The Pitt Ski and Snowboard Club also offers
weekly trips to Seven Springs Mountain Resort
at a discounted rate for students interested

in skiing or snowboarding.

Lana Tebbets

The campus is often covered in a blanket
of snow during the winter months, but that
doesn't keep students indoors.

Time to Unwind

DOWNTHVIE

hether it is in between classes,
a study break, or the end ofthe
day, downtime is one of the
most valuable commodities

to any college student.

 

When it is cold outside, students at the University
of Pittsburgh gather indoors, oftentimes at Nordy's
Place, a lounge with pool tables, televisions, and
couches. Other popular hangouts include Einstein
Bros. Bagels, the Litchfield Towers lobby, and the

I00

 

Cathedral of Learning Commons Room. Students
also spend time in friends’ dorm rooms.

On a beautiful day, students will flock to Oakland's
best outdoor hangouts. The Towers patio has
tables and benches where many underclassmen
congregate. It also is not uncommon to see
students gathered on the Cathedral lawn, Soldiers
& Sailors lawn, or Schenley Plaza, playing Frisbee or
football or just laying out and soaking up the rays.

Academics are important to Pitt students, and as a
result, downtime can be hard to find. Countless
locations on campus and off give students exactly
what they are looking for: places to relax, recoup,
and get ready for the next academic challenge.

Sally Bucey

Games like foosball, pool,

are perfect ways to spend
a little downtime.

win in the 2009 Meineke Car Care
Bowl and a second-place finish in the
Big East Conference put the Pitt foot-
ball team in a great position to start
the 20lO season. With powerhouse running back
Dion Lewis returning, the Pitt football team was full
of star players ready to dominate on the gridiron.

Led by a dedicated coaching staff, the Panthers had
a winning season, ﬁnishing with an 8—5 record.

Not only did Pitt end the season with a win, the
football team also received many postseason
honors from the Big East Conference. Defensive
end Jabaal Sheard was chosen as the ZOIO Big East
Defensive Player of the Year, marking the fourth

 

time in five years that a Pitt player received that
honor. Sheard, safety Dom DeCicco, punter Dan
l-lutchins, wide receiverjon Baldwin, and offensive
tackle Jason Pinkston also were named to the
A|l—Big East First Team.

Although the end of the season marked a change
in leadership, the team continued to play strongly.
The Panthers ended the season on a high note
with a 27—lO win over the University of Kentucky
Wildcats in the 20ll BBVA Compass Bowl.

MEN'S AND WOMENS SOCCER

lthough Founders Field isn’t on the
Pittsburgh campus, the soccer ﬁeld sees
a lot of Pitt victories from the men's
and women's soccer teams.

The women's team, led by Head Coach Sue—l"loy
Chin, brought eight starters and I8 letter winners
from the 2009 season. With 2009’s overall record
of 8—5—5, the women's soccer team was in a
great position to dominate the Big East Conference.
Although they lost the first two conference
games of the season, the women went on to
defeat Villanova University, which kept them in
postseason contention.

Pitt soccer players expertly control the ball during matches.

I06

Joe l_u><bacher is the head coach of the men's
soccer team, and during the 20|0 season, he led
it to several wins against Big East rivals. Even
though the men ﬁnished the 2009 season 2—l3—2,
the 20l0 season was immensely successful. The
Panthers defeated Rutgers University 3-0, a big
win in the Big East Conference.

The Pitt Panther soccer teams have seen many
wins and losses on Founders Field, but they'll soon
move to another home. The Petersen Sports
Complex soon will be ready for competition,
making the games more accessible to students.

Alyssa King and Amy Town. Games against teams
such as Purdue University, Ohio University, and the
University of Notre Dame kept the season exciting
for the fans.

Not only do the women dominate on the court,
they also display excellence in the classroom. In
2009, the women’s volleyball team received an
American Volleyball Coaches Association Team
Academic Award. The combined force of athleticism
and academics makes the volleyball team a paragon
of success.

The consistently top—ranked Panthers have made

This student section is nationally recognized for

the school spirit and team pride that emanate

force in the Big East Conference.

Showing its passion for areas outside basketball,
the University of Pittsburgh women's team also
came together to ﬁght for breast cancer awareness
during the annual Pink the Petersen event. Fans

and players alike proudly wore pink, and the money
raised went to support breast cancer research.

It was a slam dunk for a cause close to many

CLUB SPORTS

he University of Pittsburgh is known for
its nationally ranked sports programs,
but the average student doesn't have
to be a super athlete to play sports
on campus. A wide variety of club sports give
students the opportunity to engage in an athletic
and social environment.

A quick search on the Student Organization
Resource Center, or SORC, Web site displays more
than two dozen options. In addition to standard
sports like men's and women's club volleyball and
soccer, students also have the chance to participate

in lesser-known sports. The Panther Equestrian Club,
Pittsburgh Fencing Association, and Roller Hockey
Club are a few examples of the uncommon sports
in which students can participate.

As these clubs meet on the Cathedral of Learning
lawn for a quick rugby match or train weekly at the
Petersen Events Center, one thing's for sure: Club
sports provide a type of education that students
can't ﬁnd in a classroom.

ll  more than just selling back textbooks. They

have to pack up a year's worth of stuff and

memories as well as say good—bye to their friends.

 

Students may welcome a brief hiatus from classes
and schoolwork, but the break doesn't come
without a price. The end of April is often the
busiest time for students as they scurry to write
final papers and cram for final exams.

Once ﬁnals are over and Hillman Library clears out,
students then go through the process of hauling

all oftheir belongings out oftheir dorm rooms or
apartments, hugging friends good—bye along the way.

Most students can look forward to fall, when they
will be reunited with their friends and campus.
But for seniors, this is the ﬁnal good—bye and a
bittersweet moment. Graduating seniors leave the
University fully prepared for anything the world
has to offer. but they also have to leave the place
they've called home for the past four years.

Thou shalt conquer as of yore.

President’s Letter
STUDENT GOVERNMENT BOARD

Class of 20l I,

As we close another chapter in our lives,

we look back on the fond memories we hold
from our time at the University of Pittsburgh.
It is here that we have learned to show personal
responsibility and to care for the community
around us. It is here that we have built lifelong
friendships through bonds as strong as the
steel ofdear old Pittsburgh. And it is here
that we have become true sons and daughters
of our University, joined in its mission to achieve
excellence in higher education.

The same community that has given us
numerous opportunities to succeed has also
developed our own individual talents and
strengths. This has undoubtedly prepared us
to become strong leaders in society, our
communities, and our families.

As we, the members of the Class of 20l l,
commemorate the lessons we have learned

in our classes, through campus activities,

and from a promising investment in our city,
we accept our responsibilities as active, dynamic
members of society and know that we can
always “sing our songs out loud and clear for
our University."

Congratulations, Class of 20l ll

/

relationships you build here will yield lasting personal
friendships and professional opportunities every bit
as valuable as your degree. We're proud to have helped
