The Pitt Panther with a few friends.



wo hundred years ago a pioneer
named Hugh Henry
Brackenridge made his way
through the thick Western
. Pennsylvania forest to a small
town nestled among three rivers.
Brackenridge’s dream for this frontier
town was to found an academy to rival
those in Philadelphia and New York Ci-
ty. In a tiny log cabin near The Point his
dream became rooted.

After two centuries that academy has
grown to rival the most progressive
universities in the world. The University
of Pittsburgh is itself a pioneer . . . in
medicine, technology, the arts and
numerous other ﬁelds. Researchers and
educators at Pitt continue to explore new
frontiers, taking Pitt into its third cen-
tury. In the spirit of Hugh Henry
Brackenridge, Pitt people look to the
future and keep his dream alive.

Each year is another milestone in this
continuous quest for progress and ex-
cellence. Each year there is measurable
growth.

But the progress hasn't been easy. It
has taken hard work, leadership and
scholarship. Not to mention an occa-
sional wing and a prayer. There have
been setbadcs, and there have been pro-
found triumphs. Good and bad, fast or
slow, it has all been a matter of growing
pains.

We view growing pains as a positive

T

concept, especially in the case of a
university. Growing pains signiﬁes that
productive change is taking place. They
symbolize the questioning process and
internal unrest that often precede
enlightenment.

Growth rarely comes easily. It often
requires physical strain and intense
thought. Occasionally growth and
change encounter bitter opposition. This
is evidenced by the University's ﬁnancial
investments in South Africa which have
sparked many controversies on the topics
of apartheid’ and divestment. The shan-
ties built by Pitt students were prime ex-
amples of the strong feelings of protest
housed by many. In turn, the destruction
of one of the shanties showed the dif-
ferences of opinion on the topic. All of
this taking place during the Bicentennial
Celebration put a dark and deﬁnitely
political cloud over the festivities.

Yet, the many negative side effects of
growth are essential to the overall pro-
cess. They assure that progress is occur-
ring. And when the progress gets out of
hand, a different set of growing pains
surface to keep it in check.

In many ways, a university is the
source of progress. New ideas emerge
and are challenged. Old “trurhs" are
questioned, and either refined or discard-
ed. The synthesis of old and new, and
the search for the undiscovered are what
keep a university functioning.

At the University of Pittsburgh, we
see indications of this synthesis all
around us.

The emphasis which the University I

places a core on liberal arts curriculum
for undergraduates assures that students
acquire an awareness of the world -

past and present. No matter what one’s f
ﬁeld of study, upon graduation a student 

has been introduced to the humanities,
foreign cultures, philosophy and the arts.
Graduates have been exposed to the
great ideas of the past and have been

given the opportunity to challenge or *

uphold them.

However, the University of Pittsburgh A

also clearly stresses the ideas of the
future. Increasingly, Pitt is becoming a
frontrunner in the scientiﬁc
technological ﬁelds. In engineering,
medicine and computer technology, we

set the pace for others to follow. The 
ideas being worked on today by Pitt i
tomorrow's ‘V

researchers will become

precedents

The combination of old and new at '

the University of Pittsburgh provides

students with an important choice. They '
the established -
disciplines, or they may focus on those .
which are just developing. Yet, no mat— *

can concentrate on

ter what the choice, the results are very
similar. The ideas which they formulate
will be fresh and exciting  always
leading to the future.

Hostage negotiator
missing in Beirut

Hostage negotiator Terry Waite
disappeared somewhere in Beirut in ear-
ly February and has not been seen since.
Waite, an envoy from the Anglican
Church, met with leaders of the Islamic
Jihad terror group to try and win the
release of American hostages, and then
dropped out of sight. It was later learned
that Waite was being held hostage by
the terrorists, who demanded among
other things, the release of many con-
victed Arab terrorists in Israeli jails.
Israel has said repeatedly that it will not
release those convicted terrorists.

C/2ristian—Moslem
ﬁghting continues

Also in Beirut, there was renewed
heavy ﬁghting between rival Christian
and Moslem militias that killed dozens
and injured scores more. Rocket at-
tacks, car bombs, and hand grenades
tossed at passersby also took a heavy
toll of life, killing several dozen people,
including many women and children.
Some of the rocket attacks occurred
against Israeli troops, prompting
retaliatory air raids against Palestinian
targets.

Gorbachev reforms

February saw more of Soviet leader
Mikhail Gorbachev’s reforms, including
the release of two dissidents. Earlier the
Soviets released famed Jewish dissident
Anatoly Scharansky and refusnik Yuri
Orlov. President Reagan praised the
move, but cautioned against
“premature optimism,” because of the

Also in March, accusations and
counter-accusations ﬂew between the
two superpowers over who was respon-

really wanting an arms control agree-

faith. The two sides had met in Geneva
for a series of talks President Reagan
hoped would lead to another Super-
power Summit. But Soviet leader
Mikhail Gorbachev refused to go along
with the President’s offer of a summit in
Washington, saying he wanted some
substance in pre-summit talks before he
would even consider such a trip.

Jim & Tammy Bakker
ousted from PTL

In late March, PTL leader Jim Baker
admitted he had a sexual encounter
with a former church secretary, Jessica
Hahn, and a major scandal ensued —
forcing Baker and his wife Tammy to
resign their ministry posts. Jerry Falwell
assumed the reigns of the board, and
reshaped the upper leadership, kicking
out many Bakker sup rters.

And after weeks 0 investigation, new
charges surfaced that the Bakkers
engaged in wife-swap ing, homosexual
activities, and gross iscal mismanage-
ment. The Bakkers denied all the
charges, and insisted they had done
nothing wrong or illegal.

Building collapses:
kills workers

In April, a building collapsed in
Bridgeport, Connecticut, killing dozens
of workers, many of whom were trapped
under seven tons of concrete and steel
for days. They were never rescued. A
massive rescue attempt ensued, with
dogs and special equipment, but to no
avail. Investigators would not comment
on what caused that collapse, but did
say they were looking into the possibili-
ty that the building was erected using
unsafe materials.

NYC subway ‘hero’
goes to trial

Accused subway gunman Bernard
Goetz’s attempted murder trial began in
April, with prosecutors immediately
playing their hand. The jury was shown
a confession Goetz made to police
shortly after his initial arrest in which
he admitted he was interested in severe-
ly hurting — if not killing —- the four
youths that allegedly accosted him in a
new York subway.

Among the celebrities who died this year were ac-
tor Cary Grant who died of heart failure at the age
of 84. Other page: Singer Kate Smith died of
respiratory arrest at the age of 79; Benny Good-
man, the King of Swing, died of cardiac arrest;
James Cagney, one of Hollywood's famous
toughguys, died at the age of 86; and Ted Knight,
best known for his role in the television series
“The Mary Tyler Moore Show,” died of cancer at
the age of 62.

The prosecution thus portrayed
Goetz as a cold-blooded executioner
who was looking for a black youth to
shoot. But the defense contended Goetz
was the victim of “thugs,” who had a
long criminal background.

More allegations
against Bakkers

Late April and early May saw a “holy
war” hit the PTL ministry, with new
leader Jerry Falwell cutting off Jim and
Tammy Bakker’s salaries, and announc-
ing the ministry was deeply in debt. In
fact, Falwell said the Bakker’s money
management was so bad the church was
millions of dollars in debt. Bakker ap-
parently did not want to give up the
ministry though. Falwell said Bakker
phoned him several times asking him if
he could return. Falwell said “no.”

The “Irangate” hearings opened the

General Richard Secord on the stand.
Secord said approximately $3.5 million
in arms sale profits to Iran were
diverted to the Contras, and he believed
“the President knew and approved of
his conduct.”

Secord also said that no one in the af-
fair proﬁted, except the Contras.
Previously, many Congressmen had
charged that Secord and others reaped
large proﬁts from the transaction. In the

he football season began on a down
note with a 10-7 loss to Maryland at
Pitt Stadium, before a labor day crowd
of 48,000 plus.

In the second game of the year,
things scarcely fared better for the Panthers.
John Congemi and Charles Cladman combined
for 369 yards of total offense, but Pitt dumped
the game to North Carolina State. The Panthers
could have put the game away with a sustained
drive, but a penalty on third and seven forced
the Panthers to punt. The snap was fumbled
and the Wolfpack recovered. With 55 seconds
remaining Mike Cofer kicked a 49 yard ﬁeld
goal, forcing a 14-14 tie.

Against Purdue the run and shoot offense
ﬁnally showed what it could do. The Panthers
romped all over the Boilermakers 41-26. After
falling behind 14-0 in the first ﬁve minutes the
scoring parade began. The Panthers rattled off
34» straight points which included two intercep-
tions returned for touchdowns.

Purdue scored 12 fourth quarter points to
make it look a little better but this game was

Congemi had a tremendous day. He was 16

ﬁeld goals. West Virginia scored a late
touchdown to make the ﬁnal 4-8-16.

As the Panthers primed for their day in the
sun, the Monsoon season suddenly came to
Pittsburgh. The Pitt-Temple game was played
under conditions that ranged from a light drizzle
to a driving rain, so hard that the opposite side
of the stadium could barely be seen.

The Panther offense, bullish in the previous
two games, never seemed to get on track. The
only bright spot was Heyward’s 171 yards on
26 carries and one touchdown. But the Pan-
thers proved a football is slippery when wet,

1983 that Pitt kicked a field goal to win a

game.

The Homecoming game against Navy could
be named appropriately the John Congemi
Show. Congemi passed for 4-66 yards and 5

touchdowns en route to a 56-14 torpedoing of
Navy. The 446 passing yards was a school
record. He completed 30 of 4-3 passes.

Pitt next ventured to the Carrier Dome to
face the Syracuse Orangemen. The Panthers
lost the game 24-20 and quarterback John
Congemi sustained a cracked vertebrae on a
vicious hit in the first quarter. He finished the
game but the injury took away Congemi’s
scrambling ability, a vital part of Pitt’s run and
shoot offense.

The number one ranked Miami Hurricanes
blew into Pitt Stadium and took advantage of
every Panther mistake. Sal Cenilla and Joe
Felitsky substituted for the injured John Con-
gemi, and created 16 Miami points on 5 in-
terceptions. A fumble by Genilla created 7
more.

Craig Heyward was again a bright spot for
the Panthers. He rushed for 254 yards on 39
carries and one touchdown.

I -  _
  The Mike Gottfried Era

New coach shows he is serious about football.

I

Reviewing new plays and leading the team, Coach Mike Gottfried shouts instructions to his players.

N ineteen Eighty-Six marked the beginning
of a new era in Pitt football . . . the Mike
Gottfried Era. The Panther football faithful
hailed this new arrival as the savior of the Pitt
program. Foge Fazio had gone off to Notre
Dame to find a comfortable home as a defen-
sive coordinator. This was the year that the Pitt
Panthers, once among the cream of the college
football crop, were to return to prominence.
Unfortunately, it had been so long since the
Panthers had traveled the road to football glory
that they seemed to have forgotten the way
back.

Mike Gottfried arrived from Kansas to find a
Panther team with much talent, but little
discipline. The young squad shone with poten-
tial, but their accomplishments were lackluster.
Determined to refine the potential of this young

team, Gottfried wasted no time in establishing
his role as leader. He reviewed the disciplinary
records of some Panthers and promptly made it
known that there would be no room for trouble
makers on his team. Several players were
removed from the squad. Even Charles Glad-
man — a thousand-yard rusher the previous
year —— found himself on the wrong end of
coach Gottfried’s wrath during spring drills.

The Panthers also faced an injury problem in
1986 which plagued them throughout the year.
Both of Pitt’s All-Americans, defensive end
Tony Woods and offensive tackle Randy Dixon.
were hampered during the season with nagging
injuries. Vital contributors John Congemi, Reg-
gie Williams and Lorenzo Freeman all
sustained injuries over the course of the year.

The bad situation was worsened by the fact

°t°‘ld "fF’d "'13

that sophomore running back Brian Davis,
Parade's 1985 Player of the Year, was ruled
academically ineligible in August. With Davis’
suspension and the departure of some other
talented backs, the once strong backﬁeld was
left painfully undermanned.

With a little luck, this panther team which
ended up 5-5-1 could have ﬁnished 9-1. Only
the Penn State and Miami games were out of
reach. Fumbles, inconsistent kicking and some
missed opportunities were the downfall of this
squad.

Under the leadership of a seasoned Mike
Gottfried and with the help of a blue chip
recruiting class, Pitt may be able to overcome
this year's detours to find a successful trip in
1987.

he Pitt soccer team looked to 1986 as

a transition season. The relatively

young and inexperienced Panthers

worked hard to overcome losing eight

starters and playing a more difficult
schedule. Under Coach Joe Luxbacher’s
guidance, they ﬁnished with an impressive
10-5-2.

As the season began, Luxbacher wanted the
Panthers to go out and play as well as possible,
and to let the wins and losses take care of
themselves. This philosophy fostered success,
as did the Players’ positive, winning attitude.

“Looking back on the season, I thought our
players overall did a real good job,” Luxbacher
said. “They ﬁnished strong. We went through a
rough time during the middle of the season
where we lost a couple of games that we actual-
ly dominated but couldn’t score. The team hung
in there; they kept working har .”

Luxbacher explained that winning 10 games
was an accomplishment, considering the many
question marks the team faced going into the

season.

“We had a goalie who never really played in
a varsity game. We lost a couple of players to
injury or ineligibility, and we graduated five

 

 

seniors. So it was virtually a whole new team
coming in,” Luxbacher said.

According to Luxbacher, the 1986 team was
a fine group —— they tried hard and did what he

said to do. The Panthers really didn’t have one
dominant player and thus relied on a complete
team effort to keep from being blown off the
field by tough opponents.

The Panthers began the season explosively,
winning their first five games and then tying
Ohio State. Pitt continued to look impressive as
they finished first at the Marshall Tournament,
coming home with a trophy and several in-
dividual honors. Sophomore goalie Mark Hen-
dricks, strong throughout the tournament, was
named to the all-toumament team. Sophomore
Erim Cude, a consistent offensive force, scored
two goals and two assists and was named the
toumament’s offensive player; senior Todd
Smith got defensive player honors. Freshman
Jim Bottomley and Dan Liberati were also
named to the all-tournament team.

The Panthers returned home, only to ex-
perience their first loss of the season to West
Virginia and to face their worst defeat, 4-0,
against Seton Hall. But the Panthers bounced

the biggest question mark on the team. But
sophomore Mark Hendricks came through with
solid play, ﬁnishing the season with nine shut
outs, just one shy of the all-time Pitt record.

“There was a lot of pressure thrust onto
Mark's shoulders,” said Luxbacher. “Since our
other goalies were out with injuries, he was
really the only healthy goaltender. If he had not
come through with good, solid play, we would
have really had problems."

With Hendricks in goal and senior Todd
Smith and junior Dan Liberati on defense, the
Panther defense was particularly staunch.

The team's offensive play was also im-
pressive — Pitt outscored its opponents 38
goals to 15. Key offensive players included at-
tacking midﬁelder sophomore Erim Gude, with
ﬁve goals and six assists for a 16-point total;
senior forward Mike Grimes, with ﬁve goals and
three assists for 13 points; and junior mid-
ﬁelder John Chauvin with nine points.

With a strong nucleus returning next year
and the team having gained valuable ex-
perience, Pitt soccer fans look forward to
another successful season.

There are throwbacks to the original

The designs of these buildings were
meant to give the campus the same
solemn, academic air as the world's great

Few people have entered the Commons

growing pains.

of the Gulf Research Center opened a
world of exploration ‘to Pitt's scientists
and engineers. These buildings and the
work done in them will help distinguish
Pitt internationally as a leading educa-

The campus reflects the facts of grow-
ing pains. As we ﬁnd the need to grow,
we expand outward. We acquire and
build new  equipped to lead us
into the future. But we restore and
treasure what is brilliant from our past.

The city of Pittsburgh has also ex-
perienced its share of growing pains over
the last few years. Unfortunately for
some, this growth has meant some very
very real problems. As with most in-
cidences of progress, the changes in
Pittsburgh have come slowly and with
much opposition.

The recent shift in the economic struc-
ture of the city has left many people out
of work and untrained to find new jobs.
This has meant heartache for several
generations. These Pittsburghers are ex-
periencing the very real effects of
progress.

In this transitional time for Pitts-
burgh, it looks to the future by making
every effort to attract new industries. The
new jobs that these industries produce
may help put the depressed communities
back on their feet, and the addidonal

 

commerce which this generates will
stimulate the entire Pittsburgh economy.

The people of Pittsburgh are
astonishingly resilient. Those who have
felt the economic crunch will bounce
back. Many have already embarked on

to win is a built-in feature to the
character of Pittsburghers.

Much of that die-hard quality comes
from the strong ties to our ethnic
heritage. Many Pittsburghers still have

real belief that everyone can make it here
with a little hard work and a lot of love.

Luckily, Pittsburgh people weather

next year’s season. Pitt’s new coach, Paul
Evans, was largely responsible for sparking the
Panthers into action. Last year's team was
lukewarm, inconsistent at best. With discipline
and intensive training, Evans brought the Pan-
thers to a boil. Evans transformed the sloppy,
haphazard plays of last year’s team into the well
planned, smoothly executed moves illustrated
by the Panthers this season. A haze of optimism
is rising from Pitt’s new found flame as next
year Evans will have the opportunity not only to
continue in his coaching success, but also to
prove his recruiting skills.

Even though Evans did not have the chance
to choose this year’s players, several sizzling
sportsmen did arise from last year’s ashes.

up the court this season by demonstrating his
offensive finesse and proving to be an extreme-
ly destructive force. The Panthers captain,
Curtis Aiken, pointed this year’s team in the

 

right direction, and always seemed to be there
with a three point shot when the team needed it

most. Jerome Lane was the steam behind the
powerful Panthers as he led both the learn and
the nation in rebounds. Tico Cooper was
definitely one of Pitt's more visual players,
knowing exactly where to be and when to be
there. It was Mike Goodson who commanded
the team while on the court, singeing the super
teams like Syracuse. Demetreus Core drove
this team pounding point after point, and rais-
ing both score and overall morale.

Hope for next year lies not only in some of
the more experienced upperelassmen, but is
also found in this year's fiery freshmen. Rob
Brookin possesses a passing ability that has
burned many opponents throughout the season.
Pitt’s spunky point-guard, Pat Cavanaugh, also
showed parks of promise this year proving to be

a player to watch.

With next year’s recruits, this year’s skilled
upperclassmen, and the promising former
freshmen, the Pitt Panthers will surely prove to
be quite a powerful team in the Big East for the
1988 season. Coach Evans has all the elements
needed to ignite a blazing bonﬁre in the basket-
ball world. Panther fans will just have to sit
back and see what arises in next year’s season.
From the looks of this year’s team, the result
will deﬁnitely be hot.

out its worst regular season since the

team’s creation in 1974-, with a loss to Big
East power Providence, 96-78. In the con-
ference, Pitt ﬁnished dismally, winning only
one game in 16. And, outside of the Big East,
the team has an equally gloomy overall record
of 7-20.

This marks only the third year that a Lady
Panther basketball team has turned in a losing
record two of them being under second-year
head coach Kirk Bruce.

The reason might be due to the fact that
Bruce lost his two assistant coaches this past
summer. Carol Dugan, an assistant the past
four seasons at Pitt, left to take a similar job at
Virginia Tech. And, part-time assistant Wayne
Williams resigned to devote more time to his in-

Kim Basick and John LeMiuex were hired to
fill the posts. Basick, an assistant at Robert

 

 

Morris the past three seasons, is a top quality
coach and a good addition for Pitt. “Kim knows
the talent around Pennsylvania as well as
anyone,” said Bruce. “She’s a good recruiter.”
And LeMiuex, a former Kent State assistant,
was not contacted by Pitt about the open
coaching position, rather, he submitted a
resume. Bruce was impresed and hired
LeMiuex.

Nevertheless, the Lady Panthers had an un-
fortunate season. Their only win came when
they downed the Lady Bearcats of St. Vincent’s
College, 95-78, at Fitzgerald Field house. The
coaches had no comment on the season, but
they were excited about the win.

onsistency can be the key to a suc-
cessful season in sports. Coaches swear
by it, players harp on it, fans demand it
and teams are remembered for it.

The Panther’s women's tennis team is also a
model of consistency. They have consistently
been inconsistent 1979. However,
George Dieffenbach took over as head coach in
1981 and has been working to steady the Lady
Panthers. Since Dieffenbach has been at the
helm, Pitt has steadied into a 29-29 record.

Jodi Levine, the 1984 Most Valuable Player
and the only senior on the squad, returned from
a year off which she concentrated on her
studies. In 1984, Levine was an impressive 9-2
in the No. 1 slot. Dieffenbach was pleased to
have Levine back, but he said that she had a big
challenge this year against freshman Tracy
Feltingoff.

Feltingoff is from Emmaus High School in

Bridgett Kyle and Stephanie Nelson entered
their junior year and were a strong nucleus for

the fourth, fifth and sixth singles slots and also
strengthened Pitt’s doubles play.

Karen Meade, the only sophomore on the
team, was a strong-willed player and improved
consistently. Meade played the longest match of
the season in a win over Slippery Rock.

The Lady Panthers did extremely well
against Slippery Rock. Jodi Levine beat her op-
ponent in two straight sets, as did Tracy
Feltingoff. Junior Carrie DeVera and Bonnie
Kartzman made a strong showing by beating
their opponents in two rounds. Overall, the
Slippery Rock game was the best win. Pitt
crushed Slippery Rock University 9-0.

Coach Dieffenbach was pleased with the out-
come of the match. “This was a good turn-
around for the team after being beaten by the
same team last year,” he said.

On the other hand, Penn State crushed Pitt
by the same score of 9-0. Penn State was the
hardest team the Lady Panthers played all year.

coming into the game. (The Panthers also won
their first season game against Waynesburg
College, 41-3). Head coach Rande Stottlemyer
said, “This win was fun for our first home meet.
Jeff Turner and Chris Nufher were the stars of
the day by beating guys who were much heavier
than them.”

However, the Penn State Nittany Lions
defeated the Panther team this year. The Lions
handed Pitt a 32-17 loss. The loss dropped the
Panthers, ranked 17th nationally, to 10-3
overall and 2-3 in the Eastern wrestling

On the other hand, the team ended the
season on a high note by beating West Virginia,

the Panthers a ﬁnal overall record of 10-5 and
a 2-4 record in the Eastern Wrestling League.
The first match of the evening set the tone for
the whole night. Pitt’s Matt Rizzo took the
Mountaineer’s Joe Yancosky all the way before

The Panthers sent three wrestlers to the

swimming team has captured the Big East

Championship title. Pitt completely
dominated the meet, winning with 856‘/2
points. Villanova trailed behind in second place

Pitt’s success was in part due to the outstan-

Emore won the 200-yard individual medley and

even more fantastic if taken into consideration
the fact that he had been struck down with
strep-throat the week preceeding the Big East
Championships. Men's swimming coach Fred
Lewis felt Elmore’s bout with strep-throat had
kept him from going even faster in the cham-
pionship meet.

Emore shared the spotlight with senior team-
mate Jack Shuten, who was voted the most
outstanding diver of the meet. Shuten captured

aining Respect

' Lady Panthers win Big East title.

t was a long season of ups and downs for the

Lady Panther volleyball team. Pitt won

games it should have lost and lost games
they should have won. However, the Lady Pan-
thers ﬁnished the season with a respectable
29-12 record.

The Lady Panthers won the Big East title by
defeating defending champion Providence at
home in November. The volleyball team realiz-
ed another season long goal with an NCAA bid,
although Pitt lost 3-1 to Nebraska in the first
round of the tournament in early December.

Despite the loss to the Cornhuskers, Pitt
earned a lot of respect and credibility from
other teams in the country.

Next season the Lady Panthers are looking
forward to a big year. Every player returns with
an exception of senior Sue Hoover. Hoover,
team captain for the 1986 season, will leave a
big pair of shoes to fill. She was named the first
ever All-Big East Athlete of the Week, and to
the first team All-Big East and the NCAA’s

the first team All-Big East and the NCAA’s
Northeast Regional Team.

However, the loss of Hoover does not
necessarily signal the demise of the team.
Coach Collier will have 10 returning players to
work with next year. Collier believes that these

 

 

players are very capable of defending and suc-
cessfully maintaining the Big East title in 1987.

Great things should be expected of the Lady
Panthers next season. The brunt of this burden
will fall on the shoulders of Densie Frawley,
Nora Mulvihill and Lisa Stewart. All three were
selected as members of the first team All Big
East, while F rawley and Stewart represented
Pitt on the NCAA’s Northeast Regional Team.
Stewart was also honored by being selected
twice as the Big East Player of the Week.

The Lady Panthers will have to work hard to
get back on top in the 1987-88 season. They
will not face a light schedule. Pitt will be up
against teams like Georgia, Tennessee, Penn
State, Texas, Ohio State and Notre Dame. The
Lady Panthers will have a slight edge due to the
high-quality competition they faced throughout
this past season.

Shenandoah Invitational at James Madison
University in Virginia. The Panthers won the
preliminaries, scoring a season high of 247.65,
beating out their toughest competition, William
and Mary, by more than 10 points. For the past
several years, an all-around from Pitt has won the
individual title at meets. This year was no dif-
ferent. The all-around winner was Jorge Gonzalez,
a freshman, who beat out his closest competitor by
one-tenth of a point, with a total score of 52.1.
Gonzalez led the men gymnasts in their first
meet against Eastern Michigan. The Panthers
came away with an impressive 243.0 to 165.95
victory, despite inconsistent officiating and several
disputed calls. But Gonzalez came to Pitt from
Smithtown, NY, because of the already high stan-
dards of the gymnastics program. “Pitt has a good
gymnastics program. They have had a lot of good
all-rounders in the past few years. Plus, it’s a good
place to get an education,” said Gonzalez.
However, the entire men’s gymnastics team did
well against Kent State. Senior Dan Tarosky said,

there not expected to win,” said freshman Pat

Pollaci. “Kent State had consistently scored
higher than we did." Tarosky added, “More im-
portant than winning was the team spirit
throughout the meet. We would have been proud
even if we would have lost. We gave the best effort
we could. Everyone hit clean. There were prac-
tically no mistakes. What really helped us was the
way everyone was cheering for each other.”

However, the Panthers lost their ﬁnal game,
260.45 to 241.55 to Cortland State. Injuries
played an important role in the Panther loss The
Panther’s were without senior Mike Mealie, who
re-injured his knee, and freshman Brock Freehl-
ing, who was out because of a previous wrist in-
jury. During the meet, junior Jorge Sanchez
strained his Achilles tendon and did not perform
on the high bar. As a result, the Panthers only sent
four competitors to this event.

“It’s been a long year with our injuries,” said
head coach Frank D'Amico. “It’s depressing to
lose to a team we could have beaten. But I think
this year we beat everyone in spirit.”

coach this past season. And, gymnastics is
nothing new to Debbie Yohman, the new
gymnastics coach. For the last 20 years, she
has been competing in or coaching gymnastics.
Yohman recalls her best event as vault, but her
favorite was the beam. She competed on all
four events throughout her first three years of
college at Clarion University, and she worked as
the student assistant coach during her last year.
In 1977, Yohman graduated from Clarion
with a degree in elementary education. She
went on to the University of Iowa where she
completed her graduate work and worked as
the graduate assistant coach. At some point,
Yohman worked as the tennis coach, although
she could not hit the ball over the net herself.
After leaving Iowa, Yohman became the
head coach of gymnastics at the University of
Wisconsin at Milwaukee. After three years,

Yohman moved on to being the assistant coach
at Oklahoma State University. For four years,
Yohman’s job consisted of coaching beam and
floor and judging bars and vault.

Last winter, Yohman applied for the job as
head of Pitt’s women’s gymnastics program.
She got the job, replacing Donna Sanft, who
became head of Women Athletes Affairs.

Yohman stated that setting high expectations
for her team is a big part of her coaching
philosophy. “I expect my athletes to be the best
they can be," said Yohman. “It’s a challenge to
bring out their best.”

Lady Panther senior Alisa Spector brought
out her best at a meet against Clarion Universi-
ty. Spector had an excellent meet, taking first in
the all-around with a 36.8. The meet was Spec-
tor’s last as a Lady Panther in Trees Hall. The
meet was the last in regular season competition.
The Lady Panthers easily defeated Clarion,
180.9 to 132.15. The Lady Panthers finished
the year 13-3.

coach of the Pitt baseball team. In addi-

tion to coaching, he is a physical educa-
tion instructor, scheduling and programming
coordinator for men’s sports and executive
secretary of the Varsity Letter Club.

Lewis’ love of his work is shown through his
zest and his energetic approach to each new
challenge. For example, even though he has
coached for over 30 years, he still looks for-
ward to the start of each new season and treats
each and every game with equal importance.

“Going into the season I want the team to
make it to the World Series,” Lewis com-
mented. “A lot of people will ask me, what do
you think the team’s record will be, or how
many do you think you’ll lose? If I knew ahead
of time which ones we were going to lose then
we wouldn't have to bother playing the games.”

Lewis is currently the all-time winningest
coach in Pitt history, with 402 career victories.
But, the record is not something he likes to
dwell on. Lewis said, ‘‘It’s a record that I hope
is broken many times, by many coaches. If it’s
broken, it will mean we are winning in all
sports.”

In Lewis’ mind, the most important thing for
his players is getting a good education. “The
most important thing is that each player gets his

 

degree,” Lewis commented. If they don’t get it,
they are cheating themselves. I’ll always do
anything in my power to help them attain it.
“Baseball, it’s just a game. It should be fun.

there is always a big vn'n that the kids enjoy
which makes it elating to me,” Lewis said.

While Lewis has not been around as long as
the Cathedral of Learning, he has been at Pitt
long enough to see live chancellors, four
athletic directors and hundreds of baseball
players. He is a former Pitt player who had a
lifetime batting average of .293.

“The biggest adjustment has been growing
older and not being able to do the things I used
to,” Lewis said. “I no longer throw batting
practice or field balls in the infield. After a
while your reﬂexes slow down.”

But that has not slowed him down overall. In
fact, Lewis could be around Pitt for many more
years. “I never said I wanted to stay in coaching
all my life, just maybe for 50 years and then get
on with my career,” Lewis said jokingly.
“Seriously, I'm sure there will be a day when I
stop coaching, but I don’t see it as anytime
soon. I love being around the players and
coaches. Maybe the time to quit will be when it
isn't fun anymore or I don’t enjoy it.”

the track team’s athletes, junior Lee

McRae, runner, and sophomore Eric
Cannon, hurdler. McRae is one of the premier
athletes in the world. He spent this past sum-
mer in the Soviet Union competing in Ted
Turner’s Goodwill Games. “It (Goodwill
games) was a big thing for me,” said McRae.
“It was my first time outside the United States,
and it was really interesting to see how other
people live.”

At the Goodwill Games, McRae competed in
two events: the 100-meter dash and the men’s
400-meter relay. In the I00-meter dash
McRae finished fourth. “The meet wasn’t how
the television presented it,” said McRae. “The
food was bad and the facilities were poor. As a
consequence, I didn't perform as well as I
would have liked to. I was disappointed.”

This year’s track season featured two of

Back home, McRae managed to put on his
own little show in the Blue-Gold meet. McRae
tied his own meet record in the 50-yard dash
and shattered the Fitzgerald Field House record

 

of 31 seconds in the 300-yard run with his time
of 30.5. McRae was slightly surprised with his
performance.

“I went out harder than I wanted to because
of Lars (I-Iummel, a member of the Danish
Olympic team),” said McRae. “He is a ﬁne
runner. In the last 10 meters, I was looking
back to see where he was. It also was the first
time this year that I ran the 300 yards. I had no
idea of what I could do. I feel real good about
my performance." McRae also won the 50-yard
dash with a time of 5.1 seconds.

Another rising star was sophomore hurdler
Eric Cannon. Cannon, who burst onto the scene
last year as a freshman, was All-Big East and
All-American indoor 60-yard hurdler. He won
the 60-yard hurdles at the West Virginia Invita-
tional, and he just missed qualifying for the

ﬁnal heat of the Millrose Games.

“With Eric’s speed and ability, there’s no
limit of what he can do,” said Pitt men’s track
coach John Vasvary. “He has done a lot of
great things already. His speed has increased,
and his hurdle technique is better.” Vasvary is
very proud of what Cannon can do, not just as a
hurdler, but as a hard worker as well. “He has

it, too.”

n January of 1983, a convention in

San Diego made up of school

presidents, athletic directors, faculty
representatives and coaches (otherwise
known as the NCAA), voted on a pro-
posal that would set a standard that all
freshman athletes must attain in order
to be eligible to play their freshman
year. This was known in 1983 as
Proposition 48. The bill was voted on
by the NCAA and the majority ruled
that as of August 1, 1986, potential
qualiﬁers for an athletic scholarship at a
Division 1 school must meet

New Rule‘

' Proposition 48 starts this year.

1) In 1982, the average SAT score
for black male athletes was 690 and
950 for white male athletes.

2) In 1982, the average CPA for in-
coming black male athletes was 2.04
for basketball and 1.95 for football.
Among white male, it was 2.49 for
basketball and 2.29 for football.

3) 51% of all black males and 60%
of all black females in colleges today
scored below 700 upon entrance.

As a result of pressure by black col-
leges the NCAA established an amend-

of the National Institute of Education
supports Dr. Bozik’s beliefs. “The
educational system in society as a whole
has a problem,” said Taylor, who is
black. “When the athlete moves into
the public arena it becomes a lot of
peoples’ responsibility, just as when the
athlete is struggling on the field. It’s the
responsibility of the high school,
parents, athletes, teachers, coaches,
counselors and universities. We all

need to do a better job!”
Bylaw 5-l(j) has meant much to col-
lege athletics. Since much of

two requirements:

1) An accumulative
minimum 2.0 GPA in a core
curriculum of 11 units con-
sisting of three years of
English, two of Mathematics,
two of Social Sciences, two of
Science (including one lab
science) and two academic
electives.

2) A score of at least 700 on
the SAT test or a score of 15 on
the ACT test.

Since it has been approved,

PROPOSITION

 

the rule is controversial, many
do not even wish to talk about
the rule. But the facts are out
and it is obvious that certain
schools will suffer more than
others.

The hardest hit football team
was the national champion
Oklahoma Sooners. They lost
10 of their 23 recruits.
Although head coach Barry
Switzer conceded that freshmen
have little room on the depth
chart, Switzer was upset that

it has since become known as
Bylaw 5-1 (j) in the NCAA rules
handbook.

Considering that a student
can attain a score of 400 by

 

the athletes affected by the rule
couldn’t even meet with the
team. “We just had a four and
a half hour drug seminar.
Those kids can’t even be a part

signing his or her name on the

SAT and that a 2.0 GPA indicates an
average student, the NCAA thought that
they were quite lenient in their expecta-
tions of the student-athlete. No sooner
had Proposition 48 turned into Bylaw
5-1(j) than some college presidents
began to argue that the rule was
discriminatory and unfair.

“These institutions have built their
big stadiums and their big treasuries on
the backs of black athletes, and now
they are saying the solution is to get rid
of them,” said Crambling University
president Joseph Johnson. Bylaw 5-l(j)
certainly tends to show discrimination
as the following statistics indicate:

ment for a new sliding scale formula
that will take effect in the fall of 1988.
This will lower the SAT’s below the
700 if a student has a GPA above 2.0.
The SAT requirement, however, can be
no lower than 680.

Pitt’s athletic director, Dr. Edward
Bozik, feels that the high schools should
be paying more attention to their stu-
dent athletes. “High schools should be
making sure that their students are tak-
ing the necessary courses,” states
Bozik, “. . . if the high schools were
more concerned, there wouldn’t have
been so many affected.”

John Taylor, assistant acting director

of that.”

Pitt lost 7 of its 18 football recruits,
making this year’s freshman scholar-
ship class one of the smallest in quite
some time.

Due to federal privacy laws, the
university is not allowed to release the
names of the athletes affected by the
rule, nor are they allowed to release
any academic history of these athletes.

The Univeristy of Michigan seemed
destined to be number one ranked team
in the country. They landed two of the
top ﬁve players in the nation, Terry
Mills and Rumeal Robinson. Now, after
Proposition 4-8 has become reality,
neither Mills nor Robinson will be able

continued on page 1514

150 Proposition 48

 

to play this season.

Pitt has lost two of its basketball
recruits, also. Herb Barthol has
transferred to his home state of Ohio
and has enrolled at Ohio State and John
McNeil has enrolled at a junior college
in Maryland. Pitt has been affected
more by the rule in basketball than in
football. The number of scholarships
athletes on the basketball team is nine.
Nine players on a team isn’t enough to
run a scrimmage even if everyone is
healthy and at practice. Taking this into
account, along with the fact that there
Was a changing of the guard in the
coaching staff, the number of walk-ons
‘Wing out for the team was up from
Previous years.

There are several options that an

athlete affected by Bylaw 5-1  can do.

The first choice is the one being taken
by most athletes; that is staying at the
school and sitting out their freshman
year. By doing this, the athletes lose a
year of eligibility in their sport. A sec-
ond option would be that the player
would pay his own way for his freshman
year, thus preserving all four years of
eligibility. The ﬁnal option would be
that the athlete could transfer to a non-
Division 1 school where Bylaw 5-l (j)
doesn’t apply. With all of these
pressures options and new academic
guidelines, how does the University of
Pittsburgh feel about Bylaw 5-1 (j)?
Athletic Director Bozik, still in favor
of the rule, said the following: “Pitt
was, and till is in favor of the rule. The
rule will, in time, make the freshman
athlete better educated. But now,

Panther Prints photo

 

since the NCAA is cracking down, Pitt
will be looking for the better student-
athlete rather than the best athlete.”
Dr. Bozik was quick to point out that
83.6% of Pitt’s incoming freshman’
class of 1980 have graduated. This

compares with 67.3% of all Pitt
students, excluding transfer students,
graduating at the same time. This
statistic speaks for itself.

Bylaw 5-1 (j) has had and will con-
tinue to have an impact on college
athletics. The rule is in effect whether
universities approve of it or not and the
NCAA will make all efforts to enforce
this rule to the letter.

1939 Owl

he University of Pittsburgh
offers a huge spectrum of
organizations in which its

students can take part.
Whether political, social,
musical, academic or

athletic, campus organiza-

tions enable students to supplement their educations
with peripheral, yet valuable skills.

Organizations provide an excellent opportunity for

students to become involved in the workings of the

University. They often serve as a release for the many

tensions of the academic environment, as well as
allowing students to meet others with similar in—
terests. Many organizations such as R.O.T.C., the
Pitt News and S.G.B. help prepare students for
careers in those areas.

Pitt students can find out about campus organiza-
tions at the Activities Fair held annually in Forbes
Quad. Nearly every organization is represented at the
fair. In the endless chain of booths, there is truly
something for every student.

Involvement in campus organizations can be an in—
valuable part ofa Pitt students experience.

PETT
BAND

After reaching their fundraising
goal of $300,000 this fall, the band
unveiled their new uniforms — com-
plete with bicentennial patches on the
shoulders. They also purchased new
instruments for some sections. Dr.
O’Neill Sanford, the band’s new
director, stated plans for everyone to
have a new instrument by next year,
and Dr. Sanford wants to steadily in-
crease the band’s size over the next
few years.

Along with their usual halftime ap-
pearances at Pitt home football
games, this year the band was invited
to play at the Buffalo Bill’s season
opener in New York. They also at-
tended the Governor's inauguration at
Harrisburg in January, an honor that
even the Penn State Blue Band did
not attain.

Another part of the band, the pep
band, enjoyed Pitt’s success as they
followed the Panther’s basketball
team to the Big East Tournamnent in
Madison Square Garden, and joined
the team at the NCAA championships.
However, the biggest headlines the
pep band made this year was after the
Duquesne game when they did not
even play! At the request of Du-
quesne’s Athletic Director, the pep
band did not play. But they did not re-
main silent either, as they cheered
their team on to victory.

WPTS, as progressive as the music
they promote, is always moving
ahead. This year was no exception.
WPT S added an on-campus AM sta-
tion, and several new programs, in-
cluding a new age and reggae
program.

Pitt’s radio station has continued
doing what it does best — promoting
local bands. Each term, WPTS spon-
sored a multi—band bash in the Stu-
dent Union. It featured Pittsburgh
bands such as the Affordable Floors
and Hector in Paris.

WPTS can be heard for an 18 mile
radius in and around Oakland. Their
music format is varied enough to fit
almost any listener's taste. From
phone-in requests to jazz and oldies
shows, WPTS's style is distinctively
progressive.

1787
1987

Hugh Henry Brackenridge chose to

travel 320 miles to the west, across
seven ridges of mountains, to take up
residence in Pittsburgh. The War for In-
dependence was still being fought on the
western frontier, and communities there
were being brutally assaulted by Indian
raiding parties led by British officers. He
found a trading post and garrison town
surrounded by wild country. It had fewer
than 400 inhabitants, most of them
Scots (like himself), Scots-Irish, and Ger-
man, living in a town, he said, not “dis-
tinguishable by house or street.”

Brackenridge had many noble goals
for his new home. He intended to plant
the values of Enlightenment in the life of
the frontier town. He would adapt the
place to his own personality — that is,
he would civilize and educate it, improve
its cultural life, and correct the morals of
its people.

In December of 1786, Brackenridge
faced the first session of the Pennsylvania
eleventh general assembly. He read
aloud and entered a petition, written by
himself, to charter an academy of learn-
ing in Pittsburgh. Brackenridge used
Benjamin Franklin’s Philadelphia Acad-
emy, as a model for his western
academy, in that it was to receive some
support from the state government but
would be governed by an independent
board of trustees. The bill that founded
an academy of learning in Pittsburgh was
passed by the assembly on February 28,
1787.

Although the Pittsburgh Academy's
charter was granted in 1787 and land
was obtained, formal instruction did not
begin for two years. The story that the
first school building was a log house has
persisted. On March 12, 1789, the
trustees elected George Welch as prin-
cipal and gave notice that the curriculum
would include "the Learned Languages,
English, and the Mathematicks.”

In the 1790s with the help of a public
subscription and a $5,000 grant from
the legislature, the trustees erected a
brick building for the Pittsburgh

Academy. But Pittsburgh had no true
college. The trustees recognized that the
Academy was “inadequate to the accom-
modation and complete education of the
students," and they lamented that young
people had to travel several hundred
miles to the east to receive a higher
education.

By the early 1800s the trustees of the
Pittsburgh Academy were making plans
to develop a prestigious institution of a
higher learning for the young academy
graduates. Accordingly, late in 1818
they petitioned the legislature for a
charter for the Western University of
Pennsylvania. The charter was approved
on February 18, 1819.

The trustees chose as the first principal
of the University the Reverend Robert
Bruce, born in Scotland, a student at the
University of Edinburgh, professor of
natural history, chemistry, and
mathematics, a remarkable man and a
fine scholar. He had four other professors
on his faculty. All five men belonged to
different religious denominations.

The full course of study at this time
lasted sevenyears: four of preparatory
work, called the classical section, and
three years called the collegiate. Tuition
for the classical course was twenty-five

dollars a year, for the collegiate, thirty,
one-half payable in advance. “Boarding”
ran from one dollar to two dollars a
week. The first class, graduated in 1823,
had three members, all destined to be
clergymen.

The University in 1830 moved into a
new building fronting on Third Street
near Cherry, built with savings, private
gifts, and an 1826 grant from the Com-
monwealth. (This was the last aid the
state was to give for the next
half-century.)

By this time, public sentiment was
shifting to favor “useful learning,"
which meant placing more emphasis on
the new practical arts and sciences need-
ed to build roads, bridges, dams, and
canals, to invent and discover and
develop, to administer institutions and
public affairs.

It was during this ﬂedgling period of
the University that one of its most in-
ﬂuential alumni was graduated. Thomas
A. Mellon, founder of the banking fami-
ly in Pittsburgh, entered the Western
University in 1834 at the age of twenty-
one. Upon his first visit to the Universi-
ty, Mellon called it, “just the place I had
been looking for.”

182 Cheerleaders

It all begins with grueling tryouts in
February. By March, about 22 men
and women will be chosen to be the
Pitt cheerleading squad. Seen at foot-
ball games and basketball games, the
cheerleaders are always in top form.
This year for the third year in a row,
the Pitt cheerleaders made it to the
National Championships in Miami.
Due to new, original and more dif-
ficult stunts, it’s no wonder our squad
were named best in the Northeast.

Practices are four days a week for
2-3 hrs., except during competition
when they get much more extensive
(up to 7 days a week!). The
cheerleaders also go to a camp for 3
days at the end of the winter term and
3 days before the fall tenn. But
according to cheerleader Sandy Kraft,
the practices are worth it all. “I just
go out to have fun. I don’t think of it
as work. I put my heart into it.”

They are the ones who take to the

time-out. They are the cheerleaders.
At one time or another, you’ve probably
wondered how these men and women do
what they do. Cheerleading has evolved from
a mere sideline decoration to a recognized
sport. In addition to traditional cheers and
yells, cheerleading has come to include gym-
nastics performed both on the individual and
group levels. These are now breath-taking
partner stunts and pyramids involving as
many as fourteen people. These pyramids
sometimes have cheerleaders stacked three
or four levels high.

  UNIVERSITY
OF PITTSBURGH
  LIBRARIES
1787 ‘
1987 '

In the 1830s the trustees were
pushing for reorganization and a new
look. In 1835 they ﬁlled vacancies on
the Board of Trustees with young
replacements, and they appointed the
Reverend Dr. Gilbert Morgan, given the
new title of president, to replace Robert
Bruce. In his inaugural address Morgan
declared that a new motivation, which he
called “General Education,” should be
brought into the classroom “to perfect
the entire character of the individual and
of society itself.”

However, Morgan’s term was short
and unsuccessful; he could not manage
an effective compromise in the eternal
conflict between theoretical and practical
education. With his departure, Bruce
was reinstated to his former position.
Bruce’s second tenure was also short-
lived, as he left due to international
dissension.

In the midst of this instability and
change, catastrophe struck the city and
the University on April 10, 1845. At
around noon an untended backyard ﬁre
at Ferry and Second streets spread to an
ice house and then to several frame
houses. By nightfall twenty squares in
the most valuable part of the city were in
ruins. The University’s hall at Third
Street and Chery was destroyed, and
with it all the Academy and University
records, ﬁles, books, furniture, and scien-
tific equipment. Some trustees wanted to
cease operations. Others wanted to sell
the valuable lot, and relocate on cheaper
ground outside Pittsburgh.

Luckily this plan was rejected. With
the money received from insurance and
the scale of the old property, a new
building was erected on Duquesne Way
(on the site later occupied by Horne’s
department store).

In July 1849, only four years after the
Great Fire, disaster struck again. In a ﬁre
in the lower part of town, the Duquesne
Way building was destroyed with all its
contents. This time the disheartened
trustees voted to suspend operations.

The Western University remained
alive but dormant through many of the

next six years. On September 2, 1854,
the cornerstone for a new building was
laid and contained a copy of each of the
city’s eleven newspapers and a list of
those working on the building. To their
names they appended an exhortation:
“God save the Union and abolish all
slavery!”

The decade to come would be
dominated by the United States Civil
War. After the fall of Fort Sumpter in
April 1861 and President Lincoln's call
for an army of volunteers, the College
and the city changed in appearance and
in spirit. The students were given the
largest room in the building as a gym-
nasium, and an army ofﬁcer was station-
ed there to instruct them in drill and
military tactics.

Pittsburgh was swarming with
workmen throughout the war, for it was
supplying the North with heavy cannon,
small arms, armor plate, steamboats,
steel pipe, steel and iron fabrication
parts, and coal. The Fort Pitt Foundry
alone furnished almost three thousand
cannon, including the largest in the
world, the ﬁfteen-inch Columbiad, and
10 million pounds of shot and shell.

When the Confederate command sur-
rendered on April 9, 1865, Pittsburgh
was admirably equipped to supply the
industrial products needed to build cities
and expand across a continent. Its forty-
six iron foundries were producing two-
thirds of the country’s iron; its blast fur-
naces and thirty-one rolling mills were
turning out half its steel. A new industry
had been born in 1859 in Titusville, 100
miles north of the city. Now, with ﬁfty-
eight oil reﬁneries operating, it was sear-
ching for more efﬁcient and new uses for
its produa. Accumulation of the ﬁrst
Pittsburgh fortunes began.

During this time the Western Univer-
sity was busy reforming and upgrading
its curriculum. In August 1867, Samuel
Pierpont Langly was chosen director of
Allegheny Observatory and professor of
astromy and physics. in 1870, the
engineering course was extended to four
years, and an attempt was made to

revive the Law School.

The University received $25,000 in
1875 from the estate of Charles Avery,
a progressive clergyman, to provide free
tuition for black students.

Once again, in 1882, a fire caused
the Western University to move to a
new location — across the river to
Allegheny City. The University remain-
ed at this site for eight years before mov-
ing to Observatory Hill.

In late 1890, the trustees elected as
chancellor Dr. William Jacob Holland,
a remarkable man with an extraordinary
background, who was on the verge of
becoming a nationally known writer,
scientist, and personality. He was well
equipped “to gain the conﬁdence of per-
sons of inﬂuence and means,” and he
was not likely to accept easily their
refusal to give when he asked them to
give. In the administration of William
Holland, the College was to become a
university.

Holland’s term as Chancellor was
characterized by tremendous academic
reform. First, he began a program of
graduate studies that would result in
postgraduate degrees. Second, he ac-
cepted two sisters, the Misses Margaret
Lydia and Stella Mathilda Stein, into the
College and, in what was called “a
momentous decision of supreme impor-
tance to theihigher education of Pitts-
burgh and the vicinity,” announced that
the University would hereafter be co-
educational. Third, he brought into the
fold three already established commer-
cial professional schools that had ex-
pressed a desire to become afﬁliated
with the Western University. These were
the Western Pennsylvania Medical Col-
lege, which became part of the Universi-
ty in 1896; And in 1895 he contrived,
finally, to establish a full-ﬂedged school
of law.

These advances were aided by the in-
creased ﬁnancial support from such
wealthy Pittsburghers as Andrew W.
Mellon, George Westinghouse and An-
drew Carnegie.

198 Student Government Board

SGB raises activities fee

he Student Government Board’s

H proposal to raise the student ac-

tivities fee was approved this spring

by an unanimous vote of the university
board of trustees.

The fee for undergraduate full-time
students is increased from $24 per term to
$32 per term, and the fee for undergraduate
part-time students is increased from $8 per
term to $10 per term.

The student activities fee was a major
issue of [SGB President] Phil Moyer’s plat-
form in [his] November campaign.

“The amount we’re working with is
minimal compared to the amount we need,”
Moyer said in November. “I know that a lot
of organizations are upset about not getting
money. We didn’t have any money to give
them.”

The resolution submitted to the ad-
ministration [by the SGB] read, “. .. The
Student Government Board has determined

that an increase in the student activities fee
is both necessary for and beneficial to the
welfare of the undergraduate population and
their organizations.”

Following [the approval], SGB President
Moyer said, “I’m extremely pleased that it’s
been passed, and I’m looking forward to of-
fering student organizations more money.
It’s only going to strengthen our programs.”

The student activities fee increase, was
proposed by the SGB on March 6 and ap-
proved by the board of trustees in May.

The student activities fee, which has not
been raised since 1980 (an increase from
$12 to $24-), is distributed in the following
manner: Student Government Allocations
Committee, 50 percent; Pitt Program Coun-
cil, 35 percent; Student Publications and
Media Board, receives 12.5 percent; and
WPTS-FM, which receives 2.5 percent.

hard work pays off

his year, the Women’s Choral
Ensemble was very busy. This is not

to say that this hasn’t always been
their tradition, but let’s just let their ac-
complishments speak for themselves.

These ladies began the year with a perfor-
mance of a Mass written by Colin Sterne at a
concert given in his honor. Dr. Sterne, a pro-
fessor of music here at Pitt, retired this year
and requested that the WCE sing his Mass
along with the Pitt Men’s Glee Club.

Later in the Fall, the WCE performed
their annual concert, singing a variety of dif-
ferent types of music. Also in the fall was a
concert for a group of residents of the
Bridgeville Towers Retirement Home.

The Women’s Chorus performed their an-
nual Spring Concert which consisted of
“Pop Music Through the Ages.” Numbers
ranged from “Abenlied” and “Wasserfahrt”
by Felix Mendelssohn to “Boogie Woogie

Bugle Boy.” Also in the Spring, was a per-
formance of the “Regina Coeli” by Mozart
with the PMCC at the men’s annual Spring
Concert held in Heinz Chapel.

However, the “biggest” performance of
the year was the production of the opera
“Dido and Aeneas” written by composer
Henry Purcell. This was another joint effort
with the PMCC and other featured soloists
including Lynne Humphries-Russ, a former
member of the WCE and Nina Tober direc-
tor of the PMCC. “Dido and Aeneas” en-
joyed two successful performances.

The WCE is open to any interested
women of the University. Plans for next year
include a Fall, Christmas and Spring con-
cert, performances with the PMCC and
possibly a musical or another opera.

Holland resigned in 1901 and was
replaced by outgoing, popular John A.
Brashear whose term lasted three years.
Under the administration of Brashear’s
successor, Samuel Black McCormick, the
University received its present name and
location.

The trustees felt a new name was
necessary because, mong other reasons,
W.U.P., pronounced whup, was not
digniﬁed. The present location was
chosen in February 1905, in the biggest

real estate transaction in Pittsburgh
history. The executors of the Mary
Schenley estate sold 103 acres of Schenly
Farms to Nicola syndicate for about $3
million. The land encompassed an area
bounded by Forbes Avenue on the
south, Center Avenue on the north,
Bellefield Avenue on the east, and Bou-
quet Street on the west.

On October 2, 1908, the cornerstone
was laid for Henry Hornbostel’s large,
awkward, and inutile Soldiers and

Sailors Memorial Hall. This ceremony
took place near the close of the city's ses-
quicentennial, when distinguished guests
from all over the world were gathered for
a happy, successful, and beautifully
managed celebration. Immediately after
the Memorial Hall ceremony, the crowd
walked ﬁfty feet to see the cornerstone
laid for the first University building, that
for the School of Mines.

The location is just a few miles from the
site in downtown Pittsburgh at Third Avenue

Mr. David Schwartz, assistant executive
director of the Bicentennial Program, said,
“The cabin was erected to serve as a symbol
of Pitt’s beginning 200 years ago.”

The historic log house was donated by
Mr. and Mrs. Charles A. Fagan III of ship-

shipped to Pitt from the dismantled house in
Yatesborough, Pa.

Heritage Restoration, the contractor
which reconstructed the cabin, used authen-
tic materials such as wooden pegs to hold
the logs together. Tools like those used in
the 18th century aided in reconstruction.
According to Brad Mooney, president of
Heritage Restoration, no present-day
materials were used in the rebuilding.

The cabin features a stone fireplace, a
stone chimney and a front porch facing

The HEINZ CHAPEL CHOIR is
Pitt’s largest choral society. It pro-

vides its members with the opportuni-
ty to sing great choral music from all
eras to the University community and
the general public. The Choir, which
performs three annual concerts as
well as other small performances, is
open to any full or part time student,
by audition only.

206 Heinz Chapel Choir

Heinz Chapel serves entire Pitt community

or 50 years, Heinz Chapel has pro-
vided Pitt students with a beautiful
place for religious worship and quiet

contemplation on an otherwise bustling
campus.

According to the chapel’s director of
special events Elmer Eberley, the non-
denominational chapel is available for
several types of religious ceremonies, in-
cluding weddings and memorial services, in
addition to the Orthodox, Catholic and
Lutheran services held every Sunday.

All services are performed by members of
the University Chaplains Association. As a
non-denominational place of worship, “All
faiths may hold private services here, after
they go through our office and schedule
them,” Eberley said.

Although the entire Pitt campus is less ac-
tive during the summer than in the fall,
chapel director Dean Root reports that re-
quests for private use of the chapel are still
numerous, especially for Holy Day services

and weddings.

Root says the privately scheduled services
are “generally for Pitt students” but can be
scheduled by anyone associated with the
university. “That includes alumni, faculty
and other employees, as well as immediate
family members of anyone connected with
the university.” According to Root, those
restrictions are “not part of our policy” but
are the policy of the University Chaplains
Association.

Since its dedication in 1938, the chapel
has served as a breathtaking memorial to H.
J. Heinz and his mother, Anna. With its 70-
foot stained glass windows and its elaborate
hand-carved oak altar, it is easy to see why
the chapel took 10 years to build and why
Root considers it the most beautiful building
on campus. “It’s gorgeous. There is no other
place like it here.”

he Greek system at the
University of Pittsburgh has
been thriving since the turn
of the century. The strength
of the Greeks continues to
grow as they take an increas-
ingly important role on
campus.

In their annual Greek Week festivities, held each
spring, the Greeks raise thousands of dollars for local
and national charities. In recent years, however,
Greeks have extended their service obligations back

into the Pitt community. With such offerings as a
late night escort service, a haunted house for students
and Oakland residents, and a local chapter of
Brothers Against Drunk Driving, Greeks have prov-
en their concern for the University and its students.

Their importance to the University is also seen in
the number of Greeks who hold leadership positions
on campus. Greeks have an active role in Student
Government, athletics, the Pitt Band, the Mentor
program and many other campus organizations.
With all this going for them, it's easy to see why they
urge fellow students to “Go Greek!"

The McCormick administration is
best remembered today for changing the
name of the University, moving the
University to the new campus, and erec-
ting six major buildings. It should be
remembered as well for other less
dramatic developments. That ad-
ministration was one in which the deans
of the schools and the heads of the
departments wielded extraordinary
power. They had, in fact, more authority
to act and to command than faculty ad-
ministrators were to have at the Universi-
ty of Pittsburgh for almost a half cen-
tury. McCormick apparently felt no fear
of being overshadowed by his faculty.

The McCormick administration also
was one that set out to save the College
of Liberal Arts from extinction and in so
doing produced an accommodation in
the century-old conﬂict between pro-
ponents of technical training and those of
liberal education.

If McCormick was known for pro-
gressive academics, his successor, john
G. Bowman, will always be remembered
for progressive architecture. His con-
tribution to the University stands as a
symbol of Pitt's excellence. Under
Bowman, the people of Pittsburgh came
together to erect the Cathedral of
Learning.

In a 1924 letter to architect Charles
Z. Klauder, Bowman spoke of his dream
of building the Cathedral. He wrote,
“My life is tied up in the idea that the
proposed structure will be the most
beautiful and outstanding building ever
erected. I am confident that Pittsburgh
will build it.”

After a massive public fundraising
campaign, work began on the “tall
building” at 11:15 on September 27,
1926. After a series of setbacks, it was
finally completed in October 1934. The
construction of the Cathedral of Learning
is probably what it has been called, the
most important single event in the
history of the University.

The late 1930s were a time of crisis
for the University. Chancellor Bowman
was dissatisfied with the situation and
ordered a committee be formed to look

into it. The investigation of “the situa-
tion at the University in all of its
aspects" was a model of its kind: a
painstaking, probing, productive study
of the operations of an institution in
trouble. The members of the special
committee went directly to the heart of
the University’s problems. They made
surprising proposals that opened the way
for a revolution in procedure and style.
They conducted the investigation in a
manner that reflected credit on
themselves — the seven trustees who
asked the questions — as well as on the
administrators, faculty, and alumni who
answered them.

In the history of the University,
December 1941 is a watershed between
the old and the new, a Great Divide bet-
ween the past and the future. Doubts
were quelled and uncertainties resolved
by the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor,
and for the students there was relief and
unaccustomed excitement in the com-
mon national purpose. In a ﬂurry of ac-
tivity, the University prepared to make
its contribution to the war effort.

By mid-1943 the Cathedral of
Learning was at the center of a large, im-
portant, and efﬁciently run military in-
stallation. The classrooms, the halls, the

Commons Room, the lawn, the
sidewalks about the building were
crowded with young soldiers. Soldiers
who were taught at the University and
professors who taught them speak highly
today of the 1943-1945 experience. The
seriousness and discipline in the
classrooms were hitherto unknown on
many campuses. The students marched
to their classrooms to the cadence count
of a section marcher, who was
distinguished for the day by a blue band
around his upper left arm. They stood at
attention when the professor entered.
The marcher reported his section all pre-
sent and accounted for, holding his
salute until the professor returned it.

With the end of the war on August
14, 1945, the University turned its at-
tention to new and happier problems.
Now and for some years ahead it would
be necessary to process, enroll, and find
room and teachers for a ﬂood of
veterans. John Bowman declared in his
biennial report, “Everyone who comes in
contact with this group of students is im-
pressed by their intelligence and by the
strength of their purpose. They are eager,
disciplined, and, the faculty say, a joy to
teach."

Above: Delta Tau Delta is one of the biggest
fraternities in the Greek system at Pitt. Its abili-
ty to convince students to pledge the fraternity
has never been questioned.

After this past Greek Week, its ability to
contribute to charity won't be questioned either.
Delta Tau Delta turned in over $20,900 during
Greek Week, according to the fraternity’s chari-
ty chairman, Sandy Stern. That figure acounts
for over one-third of the overall Greek Week
goal ($62,000).

214 Greek Week

On Wednesday, March 18, Stern, a
sophomore, presented Greek Week Business
Manager Jeff Martchek with a check for
$17,000.05. The Delts had already turned in
$3,900 the previous weekend from the Greek
Week Dance Marathon that was held at
Soldiers and Sailors Memorial Hall. All money
raised during Greek Week went to the I-Iarmar-
ville Rehabilitation Center.

“This is the best that our chapter has ever
done," Stern said. “Two years ago, we turned in

$18,000, but that was including the dance
marathon.”

“(The Delts) have a really strong tradition in
the past five years for Greek Week," added
Bridget Guernsey, Pitt Greek adviser. Accord-
ing to Stern, Delta Tau Delta has raised over
$72,000 for Greek Week charities in the past
five years. He said this year that the Delts had
set their goal at $200 per brother. As it turned
out they turned in over $250 per brother.

At a board meeting on February 16,
1945, John Bowman asked the trustees
of the University to accept his resignation
as chancellor, effective July 1. He was
succeeded as chancellor in 1945 by
Rufus Henry Fitzgerald. Fitzgerald in-
herited an institution that was almost
free of debt and was about to enter a
ten-year period of unprecedented de-
mand for higher education, much of it
subsidized by federal support for
veterans in a booming economy.

Fitzgerald, who had been a University
administrator for many years, noted the
effects of the post-war campus expansion
immediately. Increased use of admission
tests and interviews, coupled with the
opportunity of selecting from among
large groups of applicants, had given the
University “the most able student body
in (its) history.”

To accommodate the increased enroll-
ment, Fitzgerald initiated a fundtaising
campaign to raise the funds necessary to
construct several new campus buildings.
Out of this campaign came Clapp Hall,
Scaife Hall, and Parran Hall.

With the addition of these new scien-
tific facilities came exciting developments
in research. Foremost among these was
the development of the Salk vaccine.
Salk and his team of researchers worked
round the clock at Pitt’s School of

Medicine in an attempt to find a cure for
the crippling disease. The cure was an-
nounced in April 1955 in Ann Arbor,
Michigan. After nearly a decade of
painstaking research, in February 1957,
thirty inoculation teams began operating
in the Commons Room of the Cathedral
of Learning, giving free injections to
students, faculty members, staff person-
nel, and their families.

Fitzgerald’s tenure marked an era of
unprecedented growth for the University
of Pittsburgh. His unexpected resigna-
tion in 1955 left many questions concer-
ning the future. In July 1955 Edward
Harold Litchfield was elected as the
University’s twelfth chancellor.

Litchfieldjs first address was a full-
scale formal presentation on December
13 to the trustees assembled in the
chancellor’s office in the Cathedral of
Learning. In a step-by-step progression
and with the aid of charts thrown on a
screen, the chancellor outlined the factors
involved in the announced intention of
the board to make the University a top-
ranking institution.

At first, there was some dissension
concerning Litchf1eld’s plans to bring
quick glory to the University. However,
as Litchﬁeld’s programs began to move
forward, faculty resentment was bottled
up, or left the campus, or changed to

applause. Robinson Miller Upton, presi-
dent of Beloit College, was exaggerating
only a little when he said, “The other
universities throughout the nation con-
sider the rebirth of the University of Pitt-
sburgh as one of the phenomena of out

an

age.
By the beginning of Edward Lit-
chfield’s fourth year, July 1, 1959, the
University had made substantial progress
in pursuit of its goal: to attain a level of
distinction in its faculty, its student
body, and its programs that would
ultimately provide the region it served
with a quality of higher education equal
to the best in the nation.

On September 24, 1959, Dr. and
Mrs. Litchfield had out-of-town guests
for lunch on the campus. Pittsburgh was
the last city Nikita Khrushchev visited
on his eleven-day transcontinental tour
of this country before he returned to
Washington to spend three days in con-
ference with President Eisenhower. The
Khrushchev party, arriving at 10:45
Wednesday evening, entered Pittsburgh
by way of Mount Washington in order
to see the brightly lighted Golden
Triangle. Khrushchev said, “Wonderful!
Wonderful!" and other members
avowed that it was the finest thing they

had seen in America

Litchﬁeld’s desire to carry Pitt into the
class of the academic elite progressed into
the 1960s. In April 1962 the University
began a drive to win a share of the
billions of dollars that were being sluiced
into the nation’s aerospace program.
Litchfield set out to sell the region's
preeminence in metals and nuclear
energy, its complex of research labor-
atories, and the need for an institution
that would channel the “spin-off’ of
space technology into industrial and com-
mercial use. He obtained NASA grants
of several hundred thousand dollars.

University Archives

However, Litchfield's numerous
capital projects caused a need for greatly
increased finances. The money never
came in as Litchfield had projected. In a
ten-year plan unveiled in 1961, Lit-
chfield had forecast for the ﬁscal year
1963-1964 a surplus of $730,000. On
January 21, 1963, he revised that ﬁgure
to forecast a deficit of almost $1.4
million. On May 14, 1963, he made
another revision and forecast a deficit of
nearly $2.1 million. This crisis eventual-
ly brought about Litchﬁeld’s resignation
in July 1965.

Zeta Beta Tau

begins reorganization of chapter

Z eta Beta Tau reorganized this year.
Alumni and national chairman Gregory
Lynn headed the reorganization. Lynn began
recruiting at the freshmen Student Ac-
tivities, using a method of rush that was dif-
ferent from the typical fraternity method.

Lynn is working with various alumni of
ZBT. It was the local alumni who first
voiced dissatisfaction with the former ZBT
fraternity. They called the Nationals, who
then sent Lynn here to begin the
reorganization.

Freshman Michael Barry saw Lynn at the
activities fair. He was intrigued by the idea
of starting a new fraternity, so he got
together some of his friends who were also
interested. Freshman Michael Newman said,
“I came with a group of friends (to a
reorganization meeting). We took the first
step, but all of us initiated will be the
founding fathers.”

This year the university has given
freshmen access to the former ZBT house on
University Drive. The reorganized fraternity
will regain the house in the fall of '87.
Freshman Michael Pomerantz said, “It will
be difficult, but we'll manage, and next year
we’ll be stronger in the house. We have to
build up a foundation first.” Freshman and
founder Michael O'Brien agree. “Given the

two semesters to organize, we'll be stronger
next year."

The new fraternity is going to be entirely
separate from the former ZBT brothers who
have been given alumni status. “They have
all the rights of alumni,” said Lynn, “but
they do not have the power to make deci-
sions as to what the new brothers will do.”

Christopher Sepesy is a senior and a
former ZBT brother. Sepesy said that their
being closed down was due to an accumula-
tion of problems over the year. “It's actually
confidential, and I think it should be left
that way. It was a national decision, though.
Some people were upset, and I'm sure they
still are, but in order for ZBT to remain and
thrive, this is for the best. There would have
been too much bad blood, and it would have
taken a long time to rejuvenate."

ZBT alumnus Melvin Cohen is also work-
ing on the reorganization. He said that “we
as trustees voted, and we made the decision
that the former brothers can't rejoin. It's
tough to determine who's good, who’s
marginal and who's bad. I mean, if a com-
pany goes bankrupt, maybe some of the peo-
ple were good, but still . . 

Cohen said the local alumni had been
working with the local chapter here over the
last couple of years. “Things just weren't

working out well. There was too much
emphasis on individualism and not enough
pull for the common goal. Almost any
organization needs framework. We (the
alumni) felt that the desire wasn't there."

The former ZBT president was also
caught embezzling money from the frater-
nity. “We have a bonding agency after
him," said Cohen, “but it's difficult because
he's in another state." Cohen did not know
the exact sum of the money taken.

Lynn, the new founding members and
Cohen are all confident about the future of
the new ZBT. “We want the new members
to be potential leaders to be involved in all
campus activities, not only the fraternity,”
said Cohen. “We want people who can work
in a team, for a team and who can lead a
team.

“I've sat in on some of these meetings (for
the new members), and I get a good feeling.
You know, if you meet someone one or two
times, you can tell if you like them, and I get
good vibes.”

strong academic foundation
has been the University of
Pittsburgh's greatest gift to
its graduates for 200 years.
The major fields at Pitt are
nearly as diverse as the stu-
dent body. From the highly
specialized Electrical
Engineering major to the all-encompassing Liberal
Arts education, the link which binds together all of
Pitt's academic programs is quality.

Pitt also offers many academic beneﬁts to its
students. Semester at Sea, Students Around the

 

World and External Studies are examples of the
University's desire to extend the boundaries of quali-
ty education beyond the Oakland campus. This year
the University Honors College was inaugurated as a
method for motivated students to challenge
themselves beyond what is typically expected for a
degree.

Increasingly, the University of Pittsburgh strives to
maintain a foothold among the nation's leading
academic institutions. It is achieving this goal with a
balance of high technology research and a strong
liberal arts foundation.

WESLEY
POSVAR

is a fact.”
We:/ey P011/ar

262 Wesley Posvar

esley Posvar, in his 20th year as president of

the University of Pittsburgh, is now so much a

part of the university that his own and
university accomplishments have become one and the
same.

This year he was honored, along with Carnegie Mellon
University President Richard Cyert, as “Pittsburgher of
the Year" by Pimburgb Magazine.

“Everything I've accomplished has been through the
university,” he said. “I suppose the person who is at the
helm necessarily becomes identified [with the university].
That’s understandable.”

“I do subjectively identify with Pitt completely," he
said. “I can't help it. When we win something, I derive
personal pleasure from it. When we lose something, I
suffer disappointment and frustration.”

The choice was made by a 26-member selection
committee, with ﬁnal approval on the part of the editors
of the magazine. Posvar and Cyert were given the award
Dec. 29 “in recognition of their vision and leadership.
[Both] are forging bonds with industry and government
that will carry Pittsburgh into the 21st century."

“I think that it has not always been the case that we
have openly worked together in any way we can," Posvar
said. “But I think it's very clear the beneﬁcial elements
that have been brought to Pittsburgh. None of those
things {Supercomputer, Software Engineering Institute,
Harmarville, etc. ] would be here if the two institutions
had not worked together. That's the message I hope is

read in this particular recognition.”

Posvar said there are two major accomplishments of
which he is most proud. The first is eradicating the debt
he inherited from former Chancellor Edward H.
Litchﬁeld.

He said the second was surviving the unrest and
protest that occurred during the late ’60’s and early 70's.

“I think properly channeled with constructive
aspirations, [student protest] is healthy,” he said. “The
period in the late ’60’s and early '70’s was largely
destructive.

“There was an impulse to destroy institutions. It was
really a resurgence of the anarchists of the 19th century to
destroy society and institutions in order to make it
possible to start over.”

He said he is generally pleased with what has occurred
at the university in the past 20 years.

“I think the general move toward excellence
university-wide is a fact."

Posvar said he watched the Penn State-Miami national
championship football game, and if given the choice
between "Pittsburgher of the Year" and a Pitt national
championship, he would prefer the latter. “If I had the
choice?" he said laughing, “Oh, I'd take the national
championship.”

In the 70s commuters started to become a greater part of the student body. Left: Students protested across America

against US involvement in Vietnam.

The University, in the mid-19605,
embarked on the road to ﬁnancial
recovery. On January 30, 1966, the ap-
pointment of David H. Kurtzman as
acting chancellor was announced. It was
not a unanimously popular choice with
the faculty. Kurtzman had been on the
campus only seven months. He was not a
physically impressive man, standing only
ﬁve feet three inches. He was a ﬁnancial
man, an accountant type.

However, Kurtzman’s ﬁnancial exper-
tise proved beneﬁcial. The Budget and
Audit Committee, with a $1.426
million operating surplus for 1966-
1967, began to return the funds
borrowed from endowment accounts,
with back interest so that they could be
reported as income—producing.

As Kurtzman was getting the Univer—
sity on track ﬁnancially, the search went
on for a new chancellor. After a long,
discouraging search, a break was made in
December 1966, and an appropriate
candidate was found. A news release was
given to the press on Friday, January 13,
1967: "The University of Pittsburgh’s
Trustees announced today that Dr.
Wesley Posvar, 41, a political science

 

professor and former Rhodes Scholar
who is Chairman of the Social Sciences
Division of the Air Force Academy, will
become the University's 15th Chancellor
on June 1 this year."

The Posvar administration began at
the onset of the most turbulent era in
collegiate history. The country had never
known anything like it. During an
eight-year period beginning in 1965,
students on several hundred U.S. cam-
puses empted in protest demonstrations.
They denounced the power structure, the
establishment, a corrupt society, the
character of an entire culture. Their
demands ranged from the ridiculous to
the long-overdue reform of educational
and social practices. They wanted an end
to economic injustice, racism, political
oppression, the draft and the war in
Vietnam.

To combat the student unrest, in Oc-
tober 1968 Posvar held the ﬁtst of
several Speak Your Peace conferences in
the Student Union Ballroom. He said,
“The essence of the University is the
relation between faculty and students.
When this relationship is faculty, the in-
stitution breaks down.”

 

Still there were protests. Confrontation
at Pitt began on Wednesday, January 15,
1969, shortly before one in the afternoon,
when some seventy black students
crowded into the chancellor's outer ofﬁce
and the hallway on the first floor of the
Cathedral of Learning and demanded a
meeting with Dr. Posvar. When the
secretary-receptionist told them he was
not in, they said they would wait. The
students placed guards at the outer door.
Posvar returned to his ofﬁce from a
meeting downtown at 3:00 pm and
talked with the students for a half-hour
behind closed doors. At eight-thirty that
evening, thirty students wearing black
berets went quietly to the eighth ﬂoor of
the Cathedral of Learning and there burst
into the machine room of the University's
Computer Center. They ordered everyone
to leave but permitted the operators to
shut down the machines properly,
thereby avoiding erasure of computer
data. They then blockaded the elevator
doors, barricaded the glass door of the
center, and settled down for a “lock-in. "

On March 11 an all-white group that
called itself -Concerned Students and
Faculty announced that it would conduct
a round-the—clock fast in Lawrence Hall
for three days but that its action would
be peaceful and non-disruptive. Some
200 members of the group met in the
Commons Room at noon to discuss their
plans, and about 180 of these marched
to Lawrence Hall and occupied the lobby
of the building. They remained there for
three days.

The University Committee for
\Women’s Rights staged a “teach-in” in
the chancellor's ofﬁce on May 18, 1970.
Arriving at 9 am, only to ﬁnd that
Posvar had a dental appointment, the
women settled down to wait. He arrived
at 11:13 and immediately held a
meeting with them that lasted until
shortly after noon.

By 1973 it was clear that the Univer-
sity had survived the years of violent pro-
test without loss of life, without physical
harm to any person, and with minimal

damage to property.

he University of Pittsburgh and Carnegie

Mellon University announced this years
opening of the Pittsburgh Nuclear Magnetic
Resonance Center for Biomedical Research.

The center is located in CMU's Mellon
Institute on Fifth Avenue.

The application of N MR to living systems is
considered by scientists to be one of the most
exciting modern developments in biomedical
sciences.

NMR can provide an image of the body that
obtained by X-ray, without the use of radiation.

According to Chien Ho Ph.D, director of the
center, “NMR is a powerful and promising
methodology, but it is still in its infancy. In order

to make NMR a truly reliable and valuable
diagnostic tool and a guide for rational
management of diseases, more research is
urgently needed.”

N MR technology exposes tissues to a strong
magnetic, pulsed, radio-frequency field. Under
these conditions, different types of atoms in cells
will respond differently, providing an image of
the body.

NMR imaging provides a static, three-
dimensional picture of a living system at a
particular point in time.

“The great advantage, of course, in N MR
imaging is that it uses no radiation. It is
essentially non—evasive and does not have any
known hazards,” said Cyert.

Since NMR is a safe technique, repeated
studies can be done on a patient and thereby
follow the progress of the disease or response to
therapy. In the future, by using NMR,
physicians will be able to diagnose and treat
diseases long before symptoms appear. Before
this promise can be realized, much more needs to
be known.

“We are hopeful and confident that with the
quality of people that we have at our two
universities and with this wonderful new
machine, that we are going to have some
breakthroughs particularly in some of the
diseases that have defied human understanding
for some time, such as Alzheimer’s disease,” said
Richard Cyert, president of Carnegie Mellon
University.

“In the transplant area, in which Pittsburgh
has a major position, we hopefully can be able to
make great progress with the use of NMR
analysis.”

NMR spectroscopy provides information
about biochemical events or processes that are
going on in a particular region of the body. In
using this with the NMR images, physicians will
be able to observe these biochemical processes
and will sometime be able to find out more
about how biological interactions cause disease.

“It should be understood that this particular
center is devoted to research," Cyert said. “We
expect to see scientists from Carnegie Mellon and
Pitt utilizing the faculty.” I

According to Cyert, there is not enough time

1 available for everyone who wants to use the

machine, so there has to be an allocation process.

“We do not anticipate scientists from other
universities — except on an occasional basis
when they have problems that cannot be solved
by their own equipment —— using the machine."

The Pittsburgh NMR institute, on Craft and
Fifth Avenues is used speciﬁcally for clinical
purposes by the 12 area hospitals.

The center at Mellon Institute is used purely
for research, although there is a flow of
information between the two.

The NMR system which will be used at the

new center is the first of its kind in the world.
The system is called the Burker Biospec II
System and has a 4.7 Tesla magnetic field
strength.

This higher magnetic field strength yields
more sophisticated multinuclear measurements
and spetroscopic measurements using living,
medium—sized animals. This will give researchers
their clearest picture to date of the complex
chemical systems in living organs.

“Professors H. T. Kung has designed, and we
have built at Carnegie Mellon, a new
supercomputer called the WARP,” said Cyert,
who feels the center will be strengthened by the
fact that Pitt and CMU will be able to utilize
their computer knowledge to a great extent to
strengthen the work that goes on at the center.”

“The establishment of the Pittsburgh N MR
Center for Biomedical Research represents a
major commitment on the part of both Carnegie
Mellon and Pitt in their effort to make
contributions to the field of biomedical sciences,”
said Dr. Ho.

Pitt President Wesley Posvar stated, “This is
another example of the cooperation between the
two universities and illustrates what higher
education can do for basic—science research that
will benefit all mankind in unforeseen ways."

The N MR system at the Center, whose
machine weighs 4 tones, costs approximately
$850,000 while others of a higher magnetic field
can cost up to $1.5 million. Because the system
has to be cooled with liquid helium and nitrogen
monthly, the upkeep will be very expensive. Pitt
and CMU have committed $100,000 for partial
operating expenses during 1986-87.

The Richard King Mellon Foundation has
provided $1.7 million to renovate laboratory
space in the Mellon Institute for the NMR center
and for partial payment of the N MR system.
The Ben Franklin Partnership Program of the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania has donated
$358,000 for partial payment of the NMR
system. Carnegie Mellon and Pitt are also
applying for substantial federal funding for the
center.

CATHEDRAL
o1= LEARNING

266 Cathedral of Learning

hat building is the one thing I am most
T proud about on our campus.” “It gives

Pitt a sense of identity.” “It’s kind of grey
and dreary, but it sure is big and impressive.” “I
have never really thought about it. It does have a
lot of character.”

The Cathedral of Learning is the University of
Pittsburgh’s official symbol for this bicentennial
year. As the center of this year’s celebration, the
Cathedral has been specially adorned with gold
lights on its upper ﬂoors and blue and gold ﬂags
at the peaks of its successive buttresses. Its
picture graces the cover of sports programs,
recruiting material, special edition notebooks,
and even Pitt: T/.2e Story of the Uni1/erxity of
Pittrburg/J, 1 787-1987, an interest-in and
insightful look at Pitt’s history by Robert

Alberts.

But, why choose such a “ grey and dreary”
symbol for this bicentennial year? Maybe,
because the Cathedral of Learning is the only
skyscraper classroom building in the “free”
world. On the other hand, everyone knows the
Cathedral and they surely can not miss it rising
high and proud over our campus. However, the
most notable reason may be‘?/ritten in the history
of this historic landmark.

The University of Pittsburgh was on the edge
of financial ruin when John Bowman became
Chancellor in 1921. Major changes would be
necessary if the University was to survive. Most
important among these changes was the need for
space. The University was cramped into quarters
one-third the necessary size. In November of

\ \

I I

1921, Frick Acres, the present site of the
Cathedral of Learning, was bought for two
million dollars. Chancellor Bowman had taken
the first step necessary to expand the University.
Next would be the decision of how to expand.

Charles Claudet was hired as an architect,
responsible for famous buildings at Yale,
Princeton, Duke and many other colleges.
Bowman demanded of Claudet “more than a
schoolhouse." He wanted a “powerful and
lasting stimulus to the work of the University.”
A building that would “carry the message that
education was the result of aspiring to great
heights.” With this in mind, Claudet started
creating the designs for the tall building. He
went through draft after draft of sketches, but
Bowman rejected them all. Finally one morning
around 4 o'clock Bowman and Clauder had
eliminated dozens of possible plans, and both
were becoming irritable. In order to relax they
began listening to the Magic Fire Music from Die
Walkure.

Suddenly the two men became inspired by the
crescendos and climaxes of the music. They
immediately came up with the plan for a
building which appeared to grow to higher and
higher levels. Claudet completed the designs by
the end of 1924.

Chancellor Bowman presented Clauder’s plans
for a 52-story building to a cynical Board of
Trustees. This mix between a Gothic cathedral
and a modern skyscraper would be more than
twice the size of any building in Pittsburgh.
Skeptical over its height, questions were raised
over whether the building would sway or if
elevators would be impractical or dangerous.
Some argued the design was not in the tradition
of college architecture and would lean to the
commercialization of education. An extreme
pessimist insisted students would fall or jump out
of the windows.

By addressing the University’s desperate need
for space, all of these doubts were refuted. With
engineers and architects at his side, Chancellor
Bowman brought out the many advantages of a
tall building: better light and ventilation, savings
on heating costs, more time for students between
classes and better student to faculty accessibility.
With limited dissension, the plans for the
Cathedral of Learning were accepted.

The only thing holding back Chancellor

Bowman's dream was the necessary finances. The
campaign that followed was a classic example of
Pittsburgh spirit and determination. In a three
month period of 1925, $10 million was raised
by the industries and people of Pittsburgh.
17,000 individuals and 97,000 schoolchildren
received personalized certificates admitting them
to the “fellowship of the builders of the
Cathedral of Learning” for their contributions.
The names of every contributor are enclosed in
the cornerstone located in the Commons Room
of the Cathedral.

The groundbreaking ceremony took place on
September 27, 1926. For the next eleven years
Chancellor Bowman fought depressions and
strikes as the Cathedral of Learning slowly took
form. After the massive steel frame was built,
engineers worked from the top down to insure
the building would be its finally designed 42-
stories. On June 4, 1937, Chancellor Bowman
laid the cornerstone, signifying the completion of
the Cathedral of Learning.

The building of the Cathedral of Learning was
a turning point in the University of Pittsburgh’s
history. The University found a new focus on the
lower campus. Pitt could now expand and
develop without the burden of limited space and
tight ﬁnances. Alumni associations were being
revived and the community was beginning to
look at Pitt with pride.

The Cathedral of Learning has been an
important part of Pitt’s history since the 1920’s.
During World War II, over 4000 soldiers

recently, protests against Pitt’s investments in
South Africa have focused on the Cathedral.

Chancellor Bowman’s desire for a “powerful

Cathedral of Learning. It seems only ﬁtting on
this bicentennial year, as our University is
“aspiring to great heights," The Cathedral of
Learning stands tall and proud as our official

Campus of tbe Future

HILLMAN
LIBRARY

 

he $2 million renovation of Hillman

Library will be completed and ready for

use in the Fall Term. Aside from the
obvious change in the physical layout of the
facility, the library will unveil a new card
catalogue system.

“PITTCAT," a computerized card catalogue
system, is being installed in the university
libraries as part of the Campus of the Future
project.

“The bigger benefit of the automation will be
that anybody with access to a micro—computer
anywhere on campus can call in and use the card
catalogue," according to Pam Vance, assistant
director of Access and Administrative Services for
the university libraries. -

Students will be able to check the status of a
book by consulting the computer. The system
will keep a record of books ordered and the
anticipated date of arrival. They can also retrieve
information about books in all libraries,
including those in Pitt's regional campuses.

The major advantage of the system will be the
reduction of the time it ordinarily takes to
retrieve information.

Many of the new terminals are located on the
ground floor of Hillman Library next to the
current card catalogue. Desk attendants will staff
the terminals in the event that a user has a
problem with the system.

During the construction, services offered at
Hillman Library were relocated or temporarily

discontinued to accommodate the renovation and
automation.

Some students said they have not been
affected by the new construction.

“It doesn’t really bother me. I don’t really
know what they’re doing, but it isn’t bothering
me at all," said freshman David Jaminski.

However, a student worker at Hillman
expressed a different view.

“It’s a hassle. All of the reference books are
everywhere, and there are no tables by sections of
the card catalogue. It really makes my job tough.
I don’t know if this is all worth it or not.”

According to Vance, “It’s deﬁnitely worth it.
The automation of the card catalogue system will
enable Hillman to give much better service to the
faculty, students, and staff of the university. The
renovation will create a better atmosphere to
work and to study in. I can see where it is
frustrating now, but it will definitely be worth
it.” I

A potential problem with the computerization
of the card catalogue system is the possibility of
the system crashing. According to Vance, if the
system crashes, the card catalogue will not be
operational. However, there will be a back-up
system so books can still be checked out.

PITT

UNION

" a&;,§;51’l;.'5 E1.-" ~.__.:§.’f

270 William Pitt Union

n the midst of cow pastures and open fields,

on a three and one—half acre site, which was
once a royal grant to Sir William Penn, and then
later owned by Mary Croghan Schenley, plans for
the Hotel Schenley began. The names Andrew
Carnegie, Charles Schuab, Andrew Mellon,
George Westinghouse, Henry Frick and HJ.
Heinz made up the first Board of Directors of the
Belieﬁeld Company, where the original idea for
the hotel was conceived. Built in 1898, by the
Belleﬁeld Company in rural Oakland, the Hotel
Schenley was a “reﬂection of the standard of
excellence that its founding fathers shared.” “It
was to represent Oakland, as a center for culture,
art and education.”

Complete with marble ﬂoors, Louis XV
architecture, and cut glass chandeliers, the Hotel
Schenley established itself as most desirable for
those who could afford the very best. The
Schenley quickly became “the” place to stay in
Pittsburgh and was soon known was “The
Grand Dame of Pittsburgh.” United States
presidents Theodore Roosevelt, Woodrow
Wilson, William Howard Taft and Dwight D.
Eisenhower all were guests. Singer-actress Lillian

Russell lived on the fourth ﬂoor and married
Pittsburgh publisher and Ambassador to Great
Britain, Alexander Moore in the French Room.
Elanor Duse, a famous Italian actress, also lived
there. The names of many others famous for
industry, the arts, education, and sports appear
on the guest registry.

In the summer of 1909, Forbes Field opened
and brought theexcitement of Major League
baseball to the city. That same summer, the
University of Pittsburgh moved to Oakland from
its former location on the North Side of
Pittsburgh.

“The Great Dame of Pittsburgh” became the
place for big league trades, victory celebrations
and the “home base” for the teams playing the
Pittsburgh Pirates. The names of Babe Ruth, '
Casey Stengel, and Ty Cobb would ﬁll the guest
register. “Discussions over dinner at the Schenley
would focus as much on baseball as business
affairs.”

“At this same time, the Schenley was used by
the University as a convenient, yet elegant setting
for the affairs of students, faculty, visiting
professors and friends.”

“At this same time, the Schenley was used by
the University as a convenient, yet elegant setting
for the affairs of students, faculty, visiting
professors and friends.”

In 1956, the members of the Board of
Trustees of the Bellefield Company and the
University of Pittsburgh worked out an
agreement that would allow the University to
purchase the Hotel Schenley at a quoted price of
1.8 million dollars. The purchase went through
in July of 1956 and the Hotel Schenley was
delivered to the University on August 1 of that
same year. Chancellor Edward Litchfield said Pitt
bought the hotel to “create a student center
which will lengthen the exposure of the student
to many valuable aspects of the University life
which lie about him outside the classroom.” He
went on to say that “the purchase of the Hotel
Schenley promises a change of character at Pitt.
The University will go from a district university
to an important regional and national
university.” This venture, worth almost two
million dollars, was speculated to increase the
enrollment at the University.

After its purchase by University, the Hotel
Schenley was permanently laid to rest and a new
beginning was initiated. First, its name was
changed to the William Pitt Union. Next, a
team of architects,

Williams / Trebilcock / Whitehead, would be
given the assignment of restoring the original
character of the hotel while blending in a
functional aspect that would serve the students,
faculty and guests as a campus center. By the end
of the 1970’s the time for a major renovation was
well overdue. In 1981 the University announced
a $14 million project, made possible by bonds
sold by the Allegheny County Higher Education
Building Authority. After the renovation was
completed, theiinterior of the William Pitt Union
was unmistakably different than that of its
predecessor's.

The lower level has been changed to meet the
recreational needs of the student. There is a new
recreation center, which contains an arcade, a
pool room, and a table tennis area. An outside
lobby area for studying and socializing fills the
center of the ground floor perimeter. Adjacent to
lobby area are both the Schenley Cafe and the
television room. There is also a small ﬂower
vender, film store and canteen to cover additional

needs of the students.

The main ﬂoor “represents a painstaking
recreation of the majesty and splendor that
distinguished the original hotel." An outdoor
patio and dining area, veranda, formal garden,
Terrace Room, Grand Lounge, Grand Ballroom
Kurtzman Room, an art gallery, the jazz Hall of
Fame, the stage and entertainment center and
Atrium all honor the main ﬂoor.

The remaining seven ﬂoors above have been
entirely changed from guest suites to offices for
campus organizations. “Only three rooms were
spared renovation.” One, Mrs. Lillion Russell
Moore’s room, located on the fourth ﬂoor. The
other two are on the seventh ﬂoor where the
Student Judicial Board meets, the French dining
rooms, “A" and 

The transformation of the Hotel Schenley to
the William Pitt Union has created, in many
senses, a Student Union with which students for
years to come can relate the honors of
Pittsburgh's past with the values of its future.
“The William Pitt Union now stands as a
centerpiece of the University campus, serving as
the focal point for the organizational, social,
recreational and entertainment interests of the
entire campus community.” It can be recognized
around the country as one of the finest student
facilities on a college campus. Now, after
renovations were completed ﬁve years ago, it still
serves many of the purposes as a student union
that it did as the Hotel Schenley.

From 1898 to 1986, eighty-eight years have
passed before “The Grand Dame of Oakland."
Sure, she's seen change, good and bad alike.
However, even though the times are changing,
the new William Pitt Union has kept up with
them. It still serves the strong precedent set so
long ago by the hotel, one of elegance, comfort
function and tradition. At the front desk where
“the titans of industry, the luminaries of stage
and politics and sports” once signed in, now sits a
bored girl rattling off bus schedules and handing
out matches. We should cherish the past and
look towards the future. Who knows, eighty-
eight years from now, they might talk about you
and how the William Pitt Union is where you
made your beginnings.

n February 2 5, the opening ceremonies of

Pitt’s new Honors College were held.
President Wesley Posvar illustrated the purpose
of the UHC saying,  . . excellence ﬂourishes
best when there are no outer limits on
achievement. ’ '

Open to all Pitt students, the Honors College
provided four basic aspects within the college:
formal course work, special advising, academic
community and a close working relationship with
faculty scholars.

The new University Honors College replaces
the University Honors Program established in
1978. Prior to the development of the UHC,
students could take Melissa Cook
academically
advanced courses
through UHP.
However, honors
degrees were not
awarded to
undergraduates.

The University
Trustees have
authorized the
Honors College to
award the “Bachelor
of Philosophy in
[disciplines]. ” This
degree will be based
on the competency of
the student.

The student will not only have to maintain a
high level of achievement in an approved
program of study, he must also perform well in
an independent scholarship. Each student will be
evaluated on his ability to produce, present and
defend a substantial piece of work.

G. Alec Stewart, dean of the Honors College,
maintained, “High academic attainment should
be done for its own sake. The highest attainment
should be independent of level. The Honors
College should be an affirmation of this belief."

The UHC is not designed to be elitist or
exclusionary, it is designed to be expansionary.

HONORS COLLEGE

Dr. Arlene Seal of the UHP said, “Students do
not have to have a four point to enroll in the
Honors College. A student just needs to have a
great deal of interest in one area.”

The admission process for the Honors College
will not change however, each student must
apply for candidacy for an honors degree.

Seal added, “The majority of the students will
not apply for the degree however, they will
continue to take the honors courses."

Pitt sophomore Monica Perz said, “Students
will have more accessibility to the new College
than they did to the UHP. The UHC will offer a
broader based education.”

“University Honors
Program was one of
the things that
brought me to Pitt,”
said Jennifer Trout, a
UHP student. “The
program offers me
the opportunity to
take the courses I
want and to pursue it
as far as it will take
me."

Brandeis
University President,
Evelyn E. Hanler
received an honorary
Doctor of Science
degree at the

dedication ceremony. The theme of Handler's
speech was that Americans understand the value
of education but lack the will to make education
a sustained national priority.

Pitt’s new Honor College has made a
commitment to this priority.

Dean Stewart noted, “Pitt students have
proven they deserve it. That's the real
justification for the program."

The University of Piltsburgh’s skyline before the storm. Right: In an attempt to improve Pilt’s appearance aging trees are uprooted to provide ample ground for new

growth .

Unlike the ﬁery decade before it, the
mid—1970s marked an important turn-
ing point toward the University’s grow-
ing prestige. The University in 1975
became by invitation a member of the
Association of American Universities, a
select group of ﬁfty institutions strong in
graduate work, professional schools, and
research. According to the perceptions of
the other forty—nine members, Pitt was
thus recognized as one of the top public-
ly supported research universities in the
United States.

On August 23, 1976, the University
marked its tenth anniversary as a
member of the Commonwealth System
of Higher Education.

Although excellence in student
scholarship and faculty teaching had
been sought in various ways down
through the years, after 1976 new ways
of rewarding superior performance were
developed and formalized. The Univer-

22 Bicentennial

sity Honors Program (UHP) was in-
troduced on the Pittsburgh campus in
1977.

Complementing the University's
academic growth of the late 1970s was a
resurgence in Pitt's athletic programs. In
1976, the Panther football team won its
ninth national title, and running back
Tony Dorsett won the coveted Heisman
Trophy. Under Jackie Sherrill (1977-
1981) Pitt had five phenomenally suc-
cessful seasons.

There were important developments
on the campus in 1983-1985 that serve
to illustrate major themes of the Posvar
administration. In April, 1985, Pitt ac-
quired the $100,000,000 Gulf Research
Center as a gift.

In November 1983 Pitt became the
ﬁrst University in the world to adopt the
AT&T Fiber Optics Telecommunica-
tions System — The Campus of the
Future.

Along with other advances in research
and planning, these developments will
help carry Pitt into an exciting future.
The University approaches its bicenten-
nial challenged and intrigued by an ap-
parent duality of mission: to be a
regional institution serving the com-
munities and people of the immediate
area, or to be a national/international
university with a strong emphasis on
research and teaching. Posvar argues that
“we cannot be one or the other; that to
serve the needs and be a leader within
the context of our region — whether
defined narrowly as Western Penn-
sylvania or as the Upper Ohio Valley of
as the Middle Atlantic -—— we must be a
national / international university ranked
among the very best of the comprehen-
sive, urban centers of research and
teaching in the world.”

he Smithsonian Institute in

Rockville, Md., donated a multi-

million dollar radiocarbon dating
lab to the University of Pittsburgh. The
lab was installed at the Harmarville
Research Center.

James Adavasio, chairman of Pitt’s
anthropology department, said he is elated
that the university was able to make such
an acquisition.

“This is one of the foremost
radiocarbon dating labs in the world,”
Adavasio said. “The incredible
competence and reputation that the lab
has are unparalleled.

“The new lab . . . greatly enhance(s) the
university’s capacity to do high-powered
research,” he said. “All scholars who are
interested in dating objects in the last
70,000 years have reason to turn to
radiocarbon testing.”

Adavasio said the acquisition of this lab
is one of the university’s greatest
achievements of the past decade.

“It’s the largest intact facility Pitt has
ever obtained,” he said. “It’s an extreme
credit to the administration that they
managed to capitalize on this windfall in
such short order.”

Adavasio said he believes there are two
reasons why the Smithsonian Institute
decided to donate the research facility to
Pitt.

“First of all, our archeological program
has enormous visibility,” he said.
“Secondly, Pitt is one of the few
universities in the country which had the
space to house the lab.”

previously believed. I

The garment was discovered at the Windover
Archeological Project, on the eastern coast of
Florida, near Titusville.

The cloth, the oldest and best preserved
example of a textile ever found in the eastern
United States, is being preserved here as well as
being analyzed. The cloth is well kept thus far
because it was buried in an airless peat bog.

The garment was sent to Pitt because of their
expertise in analyzing cloth woven by ancient
civilizations. Dr. James Adavasio, chairman of
the anthropology department is an
internationally renowned authority on the
subject.

Dr. Adavasio said, “The complexity of the

that era. ”

He said that the cloth was “either something
the girl wore in her lifetime or a shroud used to
inter the body.” He also stated “It would take a
couple of days to weave a cloth like that.”

According to Adavasio, the Indians of that era
"were usually migratory people who had no
permanent residences. This cloth indicates a more
sizeable population than a small wandering
band.” He said that the girl was anancestot of
other central Florida Indian groups.

The gravesite where the cloth was found also
yielded a projectile point, composite tools of
drilled wood, bone awls, and a drilled sharl<’s

Semester
at Sea

Many of the students think
of their Semester at Sea
experience as a pivotal
point in their academic
careers as well as in their
personal lives.

284 Semester at Sea

6 C his academic experience inﬂuenced me
enough to change my major. It gave
me a totally new perspective on the

world. On the voyage, I learned more than I ever

(had before)," said Corinna Reider, an

undergraduate student who went on the spring

1986 voyage of Semester at Sea.

Semester at Sea is a unique international
program that is academically sponsored by the
University of Pittsburgh and the Institute of
Shipboard Education. One or more students
from your university is taking part in this
program right now.

Twice a year, Semester at Sea provides up to
500 undergraduate students with the
opportunity to take part in a 100—day voyage
around the world while earning a full semester’s
worth of college credit. The program takes place
on an 18,000—ton oceanliner, the S.S. Universe.
About 50 different courses are offered each
semester, ranging from business and economics
to English literature and anthropology. Faculty
members who are affiliated with colleges and
universities from around the world have
extensive teaching and international experience.

I took part in the spring 1986 voyage as a
staff member. Since my return, I learned that
many of the students think of their Semester at
Sea experience as a pivotal point in their
academic careers as well as in their personal lives.

Scott Koontz, a University of Pittsburgh
senior who also went on this voyage, commented
on the academic aspect of the program. “I felt
that the class time was well-structured, and the
faculty on board was great. Their credentials were
really amazing. One class that stands out to me is
English Drama. Since I'm a math major, I
haven’t had English in a while. I wouldn’t have
been nearly as interested in reading different
plays if we weren’t actually going to the country.
For the level of interest it created in me, it made
all the difference in the world."

Many people have found new interest in a
Country that they knew nothing about prior to
sailing; some S.A.S. students have subsequently
included a year at the Chinese University in
Hong Kong as part of their undergraduate
studies. Over the years, the S.A.S. experience has
inﬂuenced a substantial number of students to
serve in the Peace Corps, or to seek jobs with an
international focus.

Students spend roughly half the semester in
the 10 ports of call, which are Spain, Yugoslavia,
the Soviet Union, Turkey, India, Malaysia, the
Phillipines, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Japan.
Courses taught on board are specifically struc-
tured around this itinerary, which provides a
multi-faceted learning experience.

Elephant Caves in India and the Alhambra in
Spain, S.A.S. students are also able to meet and
socialize with university students in five different
countries. There are 150 ﬁeld trips and visits
planned each semester. From the ornate artwork
of Moorish Spain to the stark beauty of shrines
and temples in Japan, students are frequently
struck by the sharp contrasts of many cultures.
The cumulative effect is remarkable and is quite
different from an “immersion” study abroad
program, where a student is exposed to one
culture only.

For a large number of
students, the S.A.S.
experience is their first trip
abroad, and many say that
it has changed their
perspective of the
American way of life.

“Now that I've returned
from the voyage, I’m more
willing to talk about
foreign affairs. I feel more
knowledgeable now about
things, and I try to
understand how the people
are feeling. You can put
yourself in their place since
you’ve been there
yourself,” said Michelle Moser.

While exploring the different locales on their
own, students were frequently impressed by the
genuine interest of their international hosts who
wanted to help them with directions, to practice
their English or simply to be hospitable. It was
not uncommon for Asian taxi drivers to bring a
student or two home with them for tea.

“Lots of people helped me get around,
especially when I was in Hong Kong. I never felt

  

threatened by people, wherever I was. It annoys
me when I hear that people are afraid of a

librarian on the voyage.

Sometimes, relying on the kindness of
strangers is a necessity. Moser related an
unfortunate experience that made her ralize that
“some things are more important than what only
affects you.” When she was in japan, she left her
passport and purse on a train. To get her
belongings back, she had to return to the station

and fill out a form — in Japanese. On the way to

' " V * the station, ajapanese

' I ' woman who spoke English
walked up to her and
asked if she was a Semester
at Sea student. She had
read an article about the
program. If that woman
had not gone to the station
and spent 40 minutes
writing out the entire form
for her, the student may
not have found her
passport. Reﬂecting on the
harrowing experience,
Moser said she is now less
likely to turn the other way
when someone, especially a
foreign visitor in the United States, is having
trouble of this kind. “An experience like that
changes a person,” she said.

Semester at Sea is not merely a trip around the
world. With the combination of the thought-
provoking courses and ﬁeld trips, the program
can educate and change those who take part in it.

Center

288 Placement Center

6 C college degree doesn’t guarantee you a
job.” With yet another class of Pitt

students graduated this spring, these
words reveal a biting reality to many new
graduates.

According to the National Center of
Education, 985,000 students will graduate from
college in 1987. Less than half will have a job
when they leave school. For these graduates, the
average waiting period to find a job is six to nine
months. Many students panic when they leave
school without a job, but serious worries don't set
in until they are out of school for a few months.
Although there are job placement and counseling
services at most colleges, few students use the
services until it is too late.

In the past year, the University of Pittsburgh’s
placement office helped about 2,000 students,
which is a low number considering the senior
class this year was at least double that number.
The placement center is free to Pitt students and
offers resume writing and mock interview
workshops, an employer information library and
a workshop on how to dress for an interview.

Last fall, the service held over 50 workshops.
The placement center organizes visits from

campus recruiters and arranges interviews for
students with company representatives.

The service also has a resume referral service.
It collects resumes from students, then refers
them to companies that request information on
students with specific qualiﬁcations.

The center also offers placement and job
counseling. Staff members help students focus on
how to find specific jobs. The main objective is to
help students constructively look for a job.

Pat Carr, a counselor at the placement center,
said most students don’t return to placement
after graduation, although they may do so.
Students don’t know that the resume service
continues after the recruiting season ends. Since
students aren’t aware of this, they quickly deplete
their supplies of resumes. By not keeping a stack
of resumes on file in the office, the student loses
out on opportunities to get interviews.

The counselors can help get grads back on the
track in their job search. “We have a very
extensive amount of expertise in dissecting a
student’s search after graduation," said Carr.
One student came into the office two years after
he graduated. He had several jobs in that period
of time and was just drifting without any career

l l

opportunities. Carr analyzed his job search. She
saw that he was taking positions with no future
or advancement potential. He was setting himself
up for failure and disappointment. In two weeks,
Carr helped him to change his strategies and got
him looking for a job with real potential, and he
found one.

“We aren't just a clearing house of
information here. We specialize in people and
redirecting their job searches into something
positive,” said Cart. “I think we have valuable
services for graduates that many people are aware
of.”

When a senior sets out to look for a job, his
major has a lot to do with how the job search
goes for him. According to Cart, the most
organized and successful job searchers are
students with technical majors such as
engineering or computer science.

“They are more focused.
An engineer knows what
type of job he or she wants
because the major trains
people for a speciﬁc job,”
said Carr. “Technical
majors get more jobs
through placement because
the ﬁelds have more jobs to
offer, and the students are
well organized in their job
search.”

Most companies that
send recruiters to schools
are technically based. Since
the people with technical
backgrounds have more
interview opportunities than otherstudents, Carr
focuses on teaching these students good
interviewing skills.

“Technical students are much more aggressive
in the job search,” Carr said. “The jobs don’t just
fall in their laps, but they have a better idea of
what they want and how to go after it. Liberal
arts majors aren’t trained for a speciﬁc (job) and

have trouble looking for speciﬁc jobs."

It is Carr’s view that liberal arts majors are less
focused than technical majors. “They stop into
placement later than most students. They start to
look for jobs later than most students and get less
jobs through placement," she said.

Her advice to students with such majors is to
focus on what type of job they want that would
ﬁt their interest and education. The want ads
usually don’t advertise for art historians or poets.

  

Carr tries to show students with “unspecific”
majors how to seek out employers and how to
represent themselves and their qualiﬁcations to a
potential employer. Since there aren’t too many
recruiters on campus for liberal arts related jobs,
many students have to learn to market
themselves on their own. The placement center is
a good place to learn how to do that.

With all the jobless graduates, one might
think the placement center would be packed with
panic stricken students around graduation time.
“Actually, the ofﬁce is pretty quiet then,” said
Carr. “The students are more worried about
ﬁnals and actually graduating instead of looking
for a job. This isn’t the season for frustration to
set in. If the students are worried, we don't see
It. '

If a student graduates without a job, there is
still hope. Most students ﬁnd something if they

' unemployed.

“I stayed home during the summer. Half the
time, I sat home doing nothing, and the rest of
the time I looked for a job,” said Pam. “I sent
out a lot of cover letters and resumes last
summer.”

She expected to have to look for a job when
she graduated. In August she found a job as a
teller at Equibank. “It wasn’t really related to my
major, but it was a job," she said.

Pam still looked for a job related to her major
while working at Equibank. She started to really
worry in December, but by Christmas she found
a job with a statistical data processing ﬁrm in
Oakland. “It's not my dream job, but it’s a
start,” she said.

en million dollars, the largest single

personal gift in Pitt’s 2()0—year history,
was donated to the Graduate School of Business
in January of this year.

Joseph M. Katz, founder and senior chairman
of Papercraft Corporation in Pittsburgh, donated
the money to the university to develop and
enhance programs in the business school. The
gift, presented jointly by Katz and his wife
Agnes, was presented to the executive committee
at Pitt’s board of trustees.

In appreciation of the gift, the university will
name the school the Joseph M. Katz Graduate
School of Business.

“Joseph Katz, an alumnus and trustee of the
University of Pittsburgh, has long been a
dedicated and thoughtful friend of Pitt," said
University President Wesley Posvar. “This gift to
the Graduate School of Business is further
evidence of his generosity to Pitt and of his
concern for the university . . . Now he has
established a benchmark for commitment and
dedication as our largest alumnus donor. All of
us at the university are extremely grateful.”

Katz says he wants to support the efforts made
by the Graduate School of Business in instilling
in its students a sense of the entrepreneurial
spirit.

“That spirit is essential to success in business
today and the Graduate School of Business has
been getting that message to its students," said
Katz. “I hope this gift will provide the school
with some of the resources it needs to continue to
inspire graduating MBAs to emulate that spirit.
Today, more than ever, large corporations as well

as small firms acknowledge the need for
entrepreneurial skills in their management
structures. I believe that Pitt’s Graduate School
of Business is one of the best schools in the
country at advancing those skills."

H. J. Zoffer, dean of the business school, said,
“We've had this under discussion for a number
of years. He (Katz) believed the school had
achieved a quality that made entrance on the very
top few schools in the country, and he wanted to
aid the school in meeting the challenges. He
finally got to the point where he wanted to
associate his name with the school and help us
move it forward."

Zoffer also said the money will be used to
endow new professorships and attract
outstanding scholars from all over the world. The
money will also be used to enhance programs
concerning managerial skills and industrial
competitiveness. The endowment will also enable
the school to teach students how business is
conducted in a global economy.

“We need to have programs that will increase
entrepreneurship and creativity,” said Zoffer.

Katz was named a trustee of the university in
1974, elected chapter trustee in 1982 and trustee
emeritus in 1984. He is chairman of the board of
visitors of the Graduate School of Business where
he has lectured to business students on corporate
mergers and acquisitions. Last year he received
the University's Bicentennial Medallion of
Distinction.

Filling

the Gap

New Provost

 

Dr. Rudolph H.
Weingartner

file photo

 

udolph H. Weingartner, the dean of

the College of Arts and Sciences at

Northwestern University for the last 13
years, is now the new provost at Pitt. He
replaces Roger Benjamin, who left Pitt last
july for the University of Minnesota where he
worked for 17 years before coming to Pitt.

Weingartner said he has more than a
routine awareness of Pitt because he has been a
member of the board of visitors for Pitt’s
Faculty of Arts and Sciences for four years.
But, he said, making the transition from Dean
of the College of Arts and Sciences at
Northwestern University in Chicago to
Provost of the University of Pittsburgh will
still require some adjustment.

“(Pitt) is the kind of middlesized
university, like Northwestern, where I feel I
can be effective,” said Weingartner. “It is a
place that’s doing well but has great potential
to do better. It’s a ﬁrst-class place now, but it
could be even better."

A man of action, Weingartner was
instrumental inthe development of several
programs at Northwestern and said he will
continue with the same enthusiasm at Pitt.

“Occasionally I write papers on an issue to
get people thinking and acting,” he said. “I’m
certainly very interested in undergraduate
education. And I think it’s exceedingly
important for Pitt to do the best it can."

As provost, Weingartner works closely with
University President Wesley Posvar. This
year’s Pittsburgher of the Year, Posvar is

perhaps the most charismatic ﬁgure associated
with the University. Weingartner said he
prefers to take a slightly different stance.

“I don’t mind being visible, but I don’t
particularly like to administer by public
speeches,” he said. “But nobody’s ever called
me a shrinking violet.”

Weingartner, whose specialty is philosophy,
said the fact that Pitt has an excellent
philosophy department is a plus, but didn’t
have anything to do with his accepting the
position.

“I'm delighted to be a member of a (school
with a) good philosophy department," he
said. “I was an (philosophy) undergrad in the
late 40s. I was a philosophy professor long
before I did this."

Though Weingartner said he is intensely
interested in undergraduate education, he said
he is relatively ignorant on the subject of
student aid. However, he said he is very much
against Reagan's cuts in the education budget.

“I think this country is going to face an
education crisis in the mid-90s,” he said. He
anticipates a shortage of young faculty as the
majority begin to age and retire.

“I think it’s unwise for this country not to
maintain its educational system.” said
Weingartner.

Weingartner has a 13-year track record at
Northwestern and said he will stay at Pitt “for
as long as it makes sense to Pitt and myself.”

New CAS Decm

balanced education for undergraduates

and the recruitment of minorities will be

two prime objectives for Pitt’s College of
Arts and Sciences, according to Dr. Mary Louise
Briscoe, the newly appointed dean of CAS.

Briscoe succeeded Irwin Schulman as dean this
year. Briscoe has served as professor and chair of
the English department for the past ten years, a
period in which the programs in composition and
creative writing have achieved national
prominence. She has been on the Pitt faculty
since 1972 and served five years as director of the
Women’s Studies Program. Her areas of
expertise are American autobiography and
culture, medieval literature and literature by and
about women.

Briscoe said she felt Schulman’s curriculum
reform was a major accomplishment and that she
intends to study how well the requirement
structure is working.

“Pitt has been one of the schools that led
curriculum reform in the last decade. We don’t
have to worry about that part of it anymore but
we do need to make sure that the quality of our
offerings is what we intend and that the students
are getting the best deal."

She said the courses students are deciding to
take must be evaluated in order to determine if
they are getting the kind of education the new
curriculum was designed to offer.

“We want to provide our students with the
opportunity to get the best education possible.”

Briscoe also stressed the importance of
minority students in the university. “I'm very
interested in trying to improve our recruitment
and retention of black students. I’d also like to

Dr. Mary Louise Briscoe

do what I can to identify among our black
students those who might be interested in going
on to graduate school and try to give them some
kind of counseling through my office and
department offices to encourage them.”

“The University of Pittsburgh is already
recognized as an outstanding research university.
I don’t think we’ve given enough effort toward
the development of our undergraduate college,”
she said.

Briscoe’s predecessor, Schulman, served for
nine years as CAS dean. Briscoe said, “Under
Dean Schulman’s leadership, we completed the
difficult task of curriculum reform. We are now
in a position to build on its strengths and
concentrate our efforts on improving the quality
of undergraduate teaching and program
development.”

After a year of sabbatical leave, half of which
will be spent in China, Schulman will return to
the University of Pittsburgh in the fall term of
1988 and resume his position as a full-time
professor of political science.

“I have enjoyed my job as dean enormously
for the last nine years,” said Schulman. “I’ve
spent most of my life teaching and researching. It
was nice to work in the administrative part. It
was very exciting and very challenging.”

Schulman said he likes both jobs, but after “a
bit of soul searching," he decided to return to the
classroom.

“I have been in this office for nine years,” said
Schulman. “It is time to give someone else a

in

turn.

nique in the world, the Nationality

Classrooms are gifts to the University of

Pittsburgh from the ethnic groups of
Allegheny County. These rooms, which combine
antique and specially created furnishings, encircle
the Gothic Commons Room on the first floor of
the Cathedral of Learning. Authentic examples of
Classical, Byzantine, Romanesque, Renaissance,
Tudor, and Empire styles, as well as peasant
architectural designs, recreate outstanding periods
from a time prior to the founding of the United
States and the University in 1787. The
committees spared no expense of time, effort,
artistic talent, craftsmanship, or materials in the
building of the Nationality Rooms, designed by
artists and architects from the nations represented.

Used daily for teaching in the arts and sciences,
the rooms directly contribute to a deeper
appreciation and understanding of ethnic cultural
heritages. This experience is enjoyed not only by
the students and faculty, but also by the thousands
of visitors from around the world who View the
classrooms every year.

During the month of December, the rooms are
decorated in authentic Christmas styles, with most
of the ornamental objects made by hand in
traditional fashion.

As ethnic heritages continue to play an
important role in the lives of many people in
Pittsburgh, the Nationality Rooms and
Intercultural Exchange Programs also continue to
expand and to include many other members of the
community. Therefore, some additional
Nationality Rooms are planned for the future.

As the classrooms were completed, the
Nationality Committees initiated further programs
to instill the values of their cultural traditions into
the University,and the Pittsburgh community.
These programs include providing scholarships to
enable students and faculty to study abroad;
sponsoring lectures, exhibits, concerts, and
seminars in ethnic studies at the University;
receiving and providing hospitality for
distinguished visitors from abroad; and assisting
the library in acquiring collections of books
concerning their areas of the world.

In these ways, the intercultural exchange
activities of the committees reﬂect the
commitment of the University to the international
dimensions of education and human relations.

participating in more than 100 activities

throughout the year. The Alumni Association, an
organization representing the interests of over
127,000 alumni, planned a bonanza of events
for the members ranging from dinner dances and
I reunions to concerts and football games. Each of
the members from the constituent alumni
associations and the regional Pitt clubs took a trip
back to their alma mater for their own group’s
activities.

The celebrating started on September 14 with
an alumni-student picnic for those who are
I involved with social work. In the following
months, there were many dinners and luncheons
at which awards were presented to distinguished
alumni. A river cruise was on the agenda for the
Engineers. And the Pitt Band got together for a
reunion and performed during half time at the
Temple football game. Other groups involved in
Pharmacy, Medicine and Business were
spectators as Pitt took on West Virginia and
Navy. I

The alumni enjoyed art displays, concerts 
the Pittsburgh Symphony and various lectures
and programs concerning their field of work. The
Westmoreland County Pitt Club had a reception
I for the Greensburg bicentennial graduating class.
There was also a dinner for the South Hills Pitt
Club. These activities lasted through June and
came to a close with a National Forum on

he University of Pittsburgh
is comprised of students
from all walks of life.
Residents and commuters,
international students and
out-of-staters, as well as
lifelong Pittsburghers give
Pitt its diverse makeup. Just
like the city it calls home, Pitt is a melting pot for
various bits of humanity. As such, the University and
the surrounding community offers a little something
for everyone.

The Carnegie and the Playhouse bring culture to

the heart of Oakland. Bars like Calico's and Zelda‘s
provide a chance for students to unwind. Simply
Frech, Ali Baba and other local ethnic restaurants
cater to curious palates. You can find just about any
“life" you're looking for in Oakland. And if not, a
dollar and a bus will help you find it in Squirrel Hill,
South Side, Shadyside or downtown.

Pittsburgh's urban ﬂare assures that student life is
more than studying, drinking, and waiting in lines.
Yet despite its increasing metropolitan character,
Pittsburgh remains the big city with the small town
taste.

Bicentennial Homecoming

Pitt celebrates 200 yrs. in grand fashion.

n a cool mid-October night, brilliant

ﬂashes of red, white, blue and gold lit up

the Oakland skies as elaborate ﬁreworks
sparked this year’s Homecoming celebration.
Pitt’s Homecoming tradition dates back more
than sixty years —— to the days of ﬁappers and
wingtips. Back then, Homecoming was the time
for alumni to return to root for the 01’ team and
reunite with friends. The emphasis of
Homecoming Weekend was on getting the team
psyched for the big game.

Homecoming these days has changed a lot.
Granted, the game is still played on Saturday,
and wingtips are back in style. But the
similarities to the old days end there. The week
end of festivities has grown into a week, more

Excitement ﬁlled the air as Thomas Brooks and Michelle Bellamy are announced homecoming king and
queen. Right: Janine Disianti congratulates Michelle Bellamy while handing over the crown and title of
homecoming queen.

events have been added and the overall spirit
has changed.

The Homecoming week has evolved into a
celebration of the university and its students,
not just the big football game. This year there
was quite a bit more oomph in the Homecoming
hoopla, as Homecoming Week also marked the
start of Pitt’s Bicentennial celebration. Students
got the privilege of honoring 200 years of ex-
cellence in the University of Pittsburgh as they
enjoyed the Homecoming fun.

The ofﬁcial opening of Pitt’s Bicentennial
was marked by the Bicentennial Convocation
which took place early in the week. The Con-
vocation, a rather prestigious procession, was
led by a corps of drummers and ﬂutists,

reminiscent of American Revolutionaries,
marched from the lawn of the Cathedral to a
well adorned Syria Mosque. Here, beneath the
blue and gold banners, President Wesley
Posvar awarded Bicentennial Medallions of
Distinction to ﬁve Pitt alumni. The convocation
ended with a recessional to the Cathedral lawn
and a raising of the Bicentennial ﬂag.

Thursday night brought a blast of spirit that
will not soon be forgotten. Floating balloons,
colorful clowns, marching musicians, and
charming homecoming candidates ﬁlled the
streets of Oakland as the traditional Homecom-
ing Parade was launched. Grand Marshal Roy
Rogers led the parade, followed by President
Posvar and Mayor Richard Caliguri. After the
parade, Posvar was joined
by the Pitt Band and
cheerleaders in leading the
crowd of Pitt students and
alumni in an inspirational
pep rally. The evening was
capped off by the largest
ﬁreworks display Oakland
has ever seen.

The dawn of the next day
brought the events that
many had anticipated since
the beginning of the term
. . . the almost anything goes
competition. Keg rolled,
balloons popped and
bananas smeared as all par-
ticipants shared in the fun.
Finally, the big day arrived.
On October 25, the Pitt
Panthers defeated Navy in a
spectacular 56-14 victory.

Perhaps the two happiest
Panther fans were Thomas
Brooks and Michelle
Bellamy who witnessed the
fantastic victory from

beneath their crowns.

28 Homecoming

Brooks and Bellamy won
this year’s titles as Homecoming King and
Queen. From the formalities of the bicentennial
Convocation to the excitement of the Keg Roll
this year’s Homecoming was truly phenomenal.

1 Frick Fine Arts Statue

A Song to Nature welcomes Pittsburghers to Schenley Park.

he inscription on the basin reads, “A
Song to Nature, Pan the Earth God
Answers to the Harmony and Magic
Tunes Sung by Sweet Humanity,” but the Frick
Fine Arts statue is better known as A Song to
Nature. It towers over the Schenley Plaza visi-
ble from Fifth Avenue. It stands at the entrance
to Schenley Park, a place many frequent daily.
It would be hard to miss a thirty-foot granite
and bronze fountain. In fact, it makes the
onlooker curious to find out more about it.
At times the basin overﬂows with cool water
that, for some, is too enticing to ignore. The
fountain’s swimming accom-

Pan, the ancient Greek earth god, reclines
with satisfaction as he watches a young woman,
personifying humanity, dance and play the lyre
for him. These two ﬁgures tie into a theme that
won the competition for Brenner. Basically, the
earth god is pleased to see people returning to
nature by going to the park and, in a sense,
returning to a simpler time. Instead of em-
phasizing Schenley, Brenner emphasized what
she did for Pittsburgh. Schenley gave the peo-
ple a place to go and enjoy nature.

Dedicated in 1918, A Song to Nature shows
signs of age. The statue’s bronze plates show

ment of Engineering and Construction and pro-
ject director for the Oakland area, explained
that the City Council ﬁnally budgeted money so
“there’s about a ninety percent chance” that
the fountain will finally get its much-needed
face-lift. The city considers A Song to Nature
the most important art work to be restored, put-
ting it number one on its list.

Padolf explained that restoration will begin
this spring and that Pitt plans to put in
walkways to the Fine Arts Building. A little late
for the University’s bicentennial celebration,
but at least the fountain will be restored, which

is the most important thing.

modations have always been
popular. Grad student Linda
Behers wades in the foun-
tain on hot days to cool off.

Not everyone visits A
Song to Nature just for the
sun. Some come to look and
wonder: why is it here?, or
what is its theme? Only a
few people, like Betsy Zewe,
know it ties into ancient
Greek mythology and even
fewer realize the idea behind
it or why or who built it.
the fountain
stands in front of the Fine
Arts Building,
students erroneously believe the University
owns it. In reality, the fountain was built in
honor of Mary E. Schenley, the donor of the
land that became Schenley Park. In 1911 the
city held a contest for a monument to her. A
Song to Nature was the unanimous choice.

Victor David Brenner, a Jewish immigrant
from Lithuania, created the fountain, one of the
few large monuments he ever did. His portraits
of George Washington and Abraham Lincoln
adorn the City-County Building rotunds.
However, he will always be remembered for his
bronze plaque of Lincoln which the United
States put on the penny.

Students are often surprised to learn the
fountain honors Schenley. Most cannot under-

stand what a reclining satyr and a dancing
woman has to do with a memorial fountain.
When asked, most students shrugged. Many
believe the fountain is erotic or dirty (“I don’t
go for that sort of stuff,” one student told me.).
Few realize what the figures represent.

gaps. Years ago, four huge, bronze turtles spit
water from the ledges into the base. Vernon
Gay, a Pitt physiologist and part-time art
crusader, theorized that three of the four turtles
might have been stolen by overzealous Univer-
sity of Maryland fans, since the turtles re-
sembled their terrapin mascot. Thankfully, the
city managed to save the last one. Unfortunately
it remains in storage where no one can see it.

For at least ten years the city has had plans
to restore the fountain, originally intending to
do so in time for America’s Bicentennial. Every
plan fell through. Gay continued crusading all
those years, even creating a plan to get
ﬁberglass turtles put up (this would have saved
the city money). Nothing seemed to work and
the city even allowed unprofessional people to
paint it (its original color was not bronze but
blue-green).

Bruce, Padolf, from the Pittsburgh Depart-

The site A Song to Nature
stands on also has an in-
teresting history. At one
time, a huge chasm
separated Carnegie Library
and Forbes Field with
bridges connecting the area.
When Grant Street lost its
“hump,” the city dumped
the dirt into the chasm and
E leveled it off. It now serves
I. gas the major parking lot for

g Pitt students. Instead of
2 tearing down the existing
3 structures, the city merely
filled in the space around
them. So, the fountain
stands on the buried Belleﬁeld Bridge.

In a sense, the statue serves as a sort of
bridge. It connects the urban with the rural, the
present with the past. When a student visits
Schenley Park, he leaves behind the busy bustl-
ing campus and city, the worries and pressures
of exams and classes. He enters a simple place
where these worries fade away. Here a student
can find peace and quiet to study, rest or play.
Across from the Panther Hollow Bridge, A Song
to Nature serves as the gateway into another
world.

n campus or off campus?
Every year Pitt students face
the problem of just where
they want to live. Whether
they choose to live in one of
the University
residence halls or some form
of off-campus housing,
there are a number of factors which go into the
decision.

The residence halls are certainly more convenient.

resources like Hillman Library, University Computer

centers . . . and The  But residents must also

tolerate cafeteria food, laundry lines, crowded
elevators, and thirty “next door" neighbors.

Commuter life consists of meter maids, crowded
buses and filled parking spots. A commuter learns
very quickly never to wear white on rainy days — to
avoid the Mammoth Splash from the bus lane. One
sure-fire way to pick out a commuter is by the jingle
in his pocket — change for bus transfers and parking
meters. Of course, commuters benefit from a private
home atmosphere and “real" food.

The conﬂuence of residents and commuters
enhances Pitt’s diverse nature and adds a fresh vitali-
ty to the campus community.

itt's Resident Student Association is an

organization that falls somewhere between a
student government and a social committee.

It has more than 200 active members

through which students can voice opinions and state
problems.

Mark Mizuba,~RSA, adviser of McCormick Hall,
said, “Students don't realize how much power they
have to get things done.”

The RSA is divided into different committees. One
example is the Food Service-Committee in which
students can voice their opinions about the cafeteria.
They can state the foods they like and dislike.
Students can also suggest new kinds of foods to be
served.

“RSA offers an excellent opportunity to students
living on campus. Not only can they get involved in
deciding their own living environment, but theycan
also gain tremendous leadership experience," said
Mike Korondo, RSA adviser of Lothrop Hall.

In Holland Hall, a special committee was recently
designed to take care of maintenance problems. If a
resident has a complaint, she tells one of the
representatives on her floor. The representative then
reports the problem at the next RSA meeting. From
there, the Maintenance Committee will solve the
problem.

RSA also provides the activities for the students
living in the dorms. The activities are decided in
various ways. Some are traditional, such as putting
up the “Pitt Pine,” the infamous Christmas tree in
the quadrangle. Other activities are created yearly,
adjusting to university policies.

A campus-wide activity is provided at least once a
month. For example, the RSA’s Valentine's Day Gateway
Clipper Cruise on Feb. T4 is this month's main activity.

“theses always semethéeg geéeg an”
Jeeet §}flJ(1¥

This year, RSA has sponsored a hayride, hockey
games, spring fling, picnics and the Holland Haunted
House. Future activities include the Gateway Clipper For-
mal and some T-shirt sales.

Other activities are decided by each resident hall. A
busy schedule is generally kept up until finals.

“There's always something going on, including a
wide variety of activities,” said sophomore Janet
Ryban

RSA also helps needy people in the Pittsburgh
area. Every year Lothrop Hall challenges all of the
other resident halls to raise money for the charity of
their choice. The hall with the most money per
resident wins.

The Lothrop Challenge raised a total of over
$1,500 for charities including Make-a-Wish
Foundation, National Neurofibromatosis Foundation,
West Penn Hospital Burn Unit and various others.

Every dorm participated in the three-week
November drive. Brackenridge Hall placed first,
raising money for the Rehabilitation building of
Pittsburgh. Each Brackenridge resident raised
approximately $2.50 per person by cunning and
selling doughnuts.

Other additional fundraising events are blood
drives and the Hand-in-Hand Festival, which was
March 28. Hand-In-Hand is a non-profit event,
featuring a carnival atmosphere complete with
music, shows, booths and games for handicapped
children. These handicapped children are paired with
Pitt students, who act as one-on-one volunteers.

eah, those PAT buses will deliver you to

Oakland. But rest assured, they will take

you OUT of Oakland. (Ha, ha, hilarious!)

Oh .«. . I'm sorry about the attitude, but

I’m a commuter. Commuters need such a disposition
in life in order to be protected from the elements.
Please forgive me.

Anyway, A,B,C and D. These are letters I learned
when I was a child, defenseless and naive. Ooo, just
brings back wonderful and lovely memories of
Sesame Street, Electric Company (“Hey you guys!”),
bed-wetting and dirty fingernails. However, place a
61 or 7] in front of the letters and I kind-of
convulge. Not a serious convulsion, though. At this
point disturbing thoughts of other people's dirty
fingers and fingernails fill my mind. Nay, nay, nay
(translation: No, no no), I am not a snob. But I am
hardened by the commuter's way of life. That's a
whole story in itself. (Note: See meter maid article
— on page 78 for proof).

Oh, I don't mind getting up at 6:00 am (very

early in the morning to go to a class that doesn’t
start until lO:OO. Why so early? You ask, “Why?"
“Well,” (as Ronnie might say), it is in order to
prepare for and travel to school. I figure: get up at
6, “snooze" — it for a half an hour, catch a bus to
town at 7:30, stay in traffic for an hour, grab a bus
to Oakland (“Any 61 or 7 I A,B,C, or D"), and get
there by 9 or 9:15, prepare for class or stroll
through the International Jazz Hall of Fame till class
starts. And thank God for the addition of the Jazz
Hall. It's so educational. Can you believe that Clark
Terry used a plunger as his trumpet mute? I wonder
if he ever worried about getting trench mouth.
Anyway, while on the subject of tourist

attractions, one of our 7 I ’s made it famous this past
year. Yes, hold on to your seats, now Pittsburgh has
yet another attraction; 7 I D

— the Cultural Loop. PAT decided this year to promote
their route by calling it the "Cultural Loop." Apparently,
the bus passes by some deeply controversial and
culturally exciting places. Hmm. Let’s see, it does pass
by the rolling landscape lawns of the Hill District. The
bus also travels on the BUS LANE through Oakland. On a
sunny day around noon, the “D" (short for 7 I D) can

“Peale. ‘fszeiti § eeéai ﬁtﬁﬁiﬁi ‘leg.

knock down a nice-sized group of students coming from
class. What else? There must be more.

Oh, I'm sure the D travels to some really great loca-
tions. Maybe I’m just letting sarcasm get the better of
me. Well, if it’s not sarcasm, then it's anger. Yeah!
Yeah! I said ANGER! Yes, anger, because, geez, I can't
even grab a hold of one of those silver bars on the bus
with my bare hands. Only the Lord above knows what

makes them so greasy. Do you know how hard it is
to walk to the front of the bus grabbing the bars with
the front bendy part of the elbow, whatever it's
called? |t’s hell on earth.

Well, I must concede, bus rides aren't complete
hell. There is hope at the end of the busway. Paul
Brown, a Port Authority Technical Transport
Engineer, yeah, you know, a bus driver, made
headlines this spring because of his iolly and
congenial manner of greeting his passengers. You
see, Paul greets his passengers with a smile, and
with that smile, he gives them a poem entitled “|’m
Fine.” I'd like to share a portion of the poem which
appeared in Pittsburgh Press. They renamed the
piece “Commuter Blues.”

I find each day an exact repetition

Starting and ending with lack of
ambition

I get up each morning and dust off
my wits

Pick up the paper and read the obits

If my name isn’t there, I know I'm
not dead

So after three meals, I pile back
into bed.”

Oh, the man is a joy! If not that, he's hurting for
a raise. But, it makes me feel good that there are
some decent citizens and bus drivers out there. It
sort of makes me feel bad for complaining about
PAT in the first place. But my grievances still hold
true. I might get sued by PAT officials for some of
my comments, but I don't care! C’mon guys, loosen
up! (I wish I lived in the 60's when college students
were allowed to protest).

ou can try and try to avoid it, but face it —

it's inevitable. Sometime during your four

year stay at Pitt, you’re going to have to go

to the Giant Eagle on Forbes Avenue. It’s a

scary thought, I know, but, however frightening, it's
true.

Maybe I should explain myself. I mean, quite
possibly, you haven't had the Giant Eagle
experience. Well, let's see. Where should I begin?
Where can I begin? The South Oakland Giant Eagle
the dive of supermarkets.

I'll never forget my first time shopping there. I

had just moved into my apartment on McKee Places.
I was so happy to see that there was a grocery store
just at the top of my street. How convenient, right?
How nauseating, is more appropriate. Anyway, I
walked up there hoping to fill my fridge and
expecting to do some serious food shopping. Well,
let's just say, those expectations were quickly
disposed of upon my first step into the store.

It was a little dirty — that was the first thing I
noticed. Kind of run down and dingy, you know?
“But appearances aren’t everything," I thought to
myself. Guess what? They are. My initial impression
was more than precise. I confirmed this when I
started surveying the produce section. To say it was
picked over would be an unfair representation.
Picked up, stepped on, squashed and squished paint
a more vivid picture of what it looked like. “Who
needs fruit?" I decided and moved on.

However, almost every section of the store seemed to
have its own unsavory aura. The deli? I skipped it. The
poultry? Looked like an acute case of jaundice to me!
And, in my opinion, frost belongs on little kids‘ noses in
the winter time, not on my frozen foods.

“Rest beleegs ere little ieéési noses in the whites
time. tee? ea my tween feme."

Well, I did manage to salvage a fe items from this
wretched grocery-go-round. You know, the typical col-
lege munchies: popcorn, milk, soup, pop and, needless
to say, ten boxes of Kraft Cheese and Macaroni. I carted
my stuff to the check out counter and waited, and waited
. . . and waited . . . (get the picture?) ‘till it was finally
my turn to pay, get my groceries and run! My only
thought was that the tribulation of Giant Eagle

shopping was ending. little did I know, that there
was one final surprise waiting for me. It's called,
from what I understand, a Jittney. I had noticed all
of these gentlemen standing around the front of the
store when I had first walked in. But I just thought
they were bored or lost or waiting for someone.
They were waiting. For me. All of them (or so it
seemed). Because as I tried to leave with my
groceries, I was accosted by each and every one of
them, trying to offer me a ride home with my bags.
“No thanks. No thanks. N0 THANKS!" I tried to be
polite. But they were insistent. I pushed pass them
all and flew out the doors. I just wanted to go home.

I know my mother never had these sort of
problems when she went grocery shopping. She
would have warned me.

So there it is. South Oakland Giant Eagle. Hell for
college students trying to eat. But what can you do?
It is close. And it's the only supermarket you can get
to without ,a car. So I guess there's really nothing
that can be done. Giant Eagle will continue to get Pitt
students’ business, no matter how bad it looks (or
smells), because it's all there is. See? I told you it
was pretty scary.

I think it was Shakespeare who said “all the
world's a stage." I agree. Just go to South Oakland
Giant Eagle. There's a tragic comedy going on there
everyday.

ay (RA Ray) is a tall, handsome young man
of twenty who practices good grooming. He is
the youngest of six children and plans to be a
successful businessman or a surgeon. P.A.
Ray dates his high school sweetheart and sends
flowers to his mother on every holiday. He’s an A
student in Chemistry during the school year and
tends bar at the Jersey shore over the summer. R. A.
Ray was the second-string quarterback in high school
but — because he was a little too small for college
ball — now satisfies his manly yearnings by playing
I. M. volleyball at his beloved UNIVERSITY. He is a
fraternity man who enjoys community service and
beer. R. A. Ray sees being a R. A. as a valuable
character building experience, as well as a useful
resume padder.
Eager to begin his career as a resident assistant,
R. A. Ray gets to school a week early to find that he
is the only person on his floor, except for the trio of
maids who haven't yet cleaned his room. He moves
everything into his room early Saturday morning,
figuring to give himself a hour or so's rest before R.
A. Workshop begins at noon. Just as he nuzzles into
the heaping mound of argyle sweaters on his bed, a
knock is heard at the door.
“Listen honey. We didn’t clean this room yet, and
it's not pointed either," calls the blue clad beauty in
his doorway. ‘‘If ya wanna move all this stuff outa
here, we'll clean it. Or else we can leave ya this rag
and some Windex, and you can clean when you get
the chance.
“Uh, sure,” replies Ray, the rookie RA. He'd be
glad to help those maids out. He knows they’re busy
ladies and he’ll need them on his side over the long
year ahead. But for now, he’l| catch a few Z’s in
order to be well rested when workshop begins.
Just about every new RA coming to Pitt for the
August workshop starts out in the same positive

    

frame of mind as RA Ray. They're proud to have
been chosen as one of the select 86 upperclassmen
who make final RA cuts in March and anxious to im-
press fellow Office of Residence Life staffers.

This break of enthusiasm usually rolls high into
October. But then, as if by some evil black magic,
the happy-go-lucky, scholastically motivated resident

assistants begin to transform. This psychological
metamorphosis begins to surface some time around
midterms. Some sadistic rule of nature seems to dic-
tate that the RA have his busiest duty weekend while
preparing for three impending midterms and a I2-
page paper. The first phase of RA disillusionment
usually occurs in this period. Four lockouts in one
night and a raucous party brewed up ball players

 

 

tend to quell the enthusiastic spirit of even the most
well-intentioned RA. An all-nighter spent cramming
for Organic Chemistry can be bad enough. But couple
this with a tower full of screamin’, drinkin', dancin’
banshees, and hairs tend to split at a dizzying pace.

Yet, even this first phase of RA madness is often
surmountable. A good all-night bitch session with
some other RA’s is usually enough to temporarily
save the sanity of a RA in this early stage of “the
schizzes."

The real wave of stress and disillusionment
crashes down in February. In this stressful month,
the R. A. is forced to confront a number of differing
character changes in her residents — unfortunately,
none of them good. It may be the blank staring
senior who finally realizes that studying is essential
or graduation is a pipe dream, or the manic
freshmen who gives new meaning to the term
“Cabin fever." Both are R. A. nightmares.

It's about this time that noticeable changes can be
observed in all American R. A. Ray and his happy
cohorts. The previously clean-shoven face gives way
to a stubbly mug. The Pitt Pride T-shirts and shorts
are replaced by tie-dye and camouflage. Gone are
the Reeboks — it's time to go barefoot and think
about tanning. And it's not even all that surprising to
hear a little Dead music blasting through the Advents
in that ol' R. A. suite. To escape the traumas of
spastic residents, many R. A.'s can be seen escaping
to 0'5, Calico’s, or Peter's during nearly all non-duty
hours.

Yes, it's a hectic, stressful lifestyle overseeing the
peaceful cohabitation of 30 or so residents —
especially on four hours of sleep nightly. But,
somehow, those strong-willed, clear thinking, good
hearted R. A.'s manage to make it throughout the
year — somewhat zoned out, but not too much

lthough we've spent nine collective

wonderful years here at Pitt, there are

two things that will be missed least. The

first being the dorm's fraction-of-a-ply

toilet paper that serves its purpose but, being
just shy of 220-grit sandpaper, is for from our
idea of comfort.

Then there is the cafeteria. I, a student for

four painful years, will take you on a guided tour
of our illustrious cafeteria. I must say that I do
have some respect for the cafeteria staff and I
can understand that it is no picnic trying to
prepare and serve food (and I use that term
loosely) to thousands of obnoxious, belligerent
students every day.

However, I still have my gripes. The hot food
wouldn't be all that bad if you didn’t have to chip
the ice from it for IS minutes before you can eat
it. The World War II surplus dinner rolls remind
me of giant, mutant croutons. Did you ever
notice that there are no pigeons in Shenley Park
on the days that we have “chicken"? . . . Makes
you wonder.

Sometimes you have to search both cafeterias
for even a single ice cube, or you can always
pick some up off the floor. While waiting for new
ice cubes to freeze, you can go to a nearby
beverage thruster to get your shirt saturated by
a sputtering torrent of over-carbonated
refreshment. Thankfully, this type of reaction
from a dispenser is the exception, and the next

one over will serve you normally by secreting a dark
brown sample of high viscocity tar, not to be remotely
mistaken for Coke.

“Perhege the veggies meld else he used to chill
the milk.”

Me em: § Iilaser! ifs:

/~J‘J\/x/\/J ‘~./\/\/\/'\./ ./\/\/‘x./_/./\/\.

Angry and sopping, you find a place to sit in a dark
corner under an air-conditioning duct next to some
diseased plant. By this time, you're ready to eat, and
you look down at your tray expecting to see golden
rivers of butter streaming down over your steamy

vegetables.‘ Well, the butter is as hard as a brick and
colder than it was before you got it, but at least you
know where you can put the butter to keep it from
melting. Perhaps the veggies could also be used to chill
the milk, which is usually kept in the neighborhood of
room temperature.

Eventually, you decide to give up hope on this
particular fiasco and attempt to salvage the meal that
was stricken from your ID by going over to the deli line.
“This can't fail," you lie to yourself as you approach the
grumbling lunchmeat hostess. In a proud, clear voice,
you say, “I'll have roast beef . . . on rye . . . with Swiss
choose." You panic as you see her bagged hand pass
over your cheese selection. Think quick! Get her
attention! As you attempt to iog her memory, you shout,
“Swiss. . . Swiss! . . . SWISS!!!" But it's too late. You've
been handed a plate with ham salad on a bun with
muenster.

You pause to think for a moment, but the sheer
magnitude of her error tells you not to try again, and
the endless list of daily cafeteria horrors suggests that
you give up and go home.

“The Hole," “The Pit,” of “The Seventh Layer of
Hell,” call it what you wish, I'm sure not going to miss
it.

Insight:

Pitt Theatre looking
for space to play in.

espite a successful season, the students

and faculty in Pitt’s theatre arts depart-

ment are ﬁnding out how tough the road
to stardom can be.

The theatre arts department is in dire need of
space and renovations. Some work has been
done in the Cathedral basement to alleviate
some of the department’s immediate problems.

Classroom and rehearsal room B16 was
renovated this year to help accommodate the
need for space. New offices have also been built
in the basement for the faculty and graduate
students. Other renovations have been pro-
posed, but no money has been allocated for
them yet.

According to W. Richardson Howe, associate
dean for administration, “Every academic unit
would like to give it to them. Unfortunately,
space is a limited commodity. Therefore we
have to work within the space of the
university."

Dean Koehler of the Faculty of Arts and
Sciences said that it would take 358 or 9 million
to make Bellefield Annex adequate for the
needs of the theatre arts department.

"l doift have $8 or 9 million and neither
does the university at this point." said Koehler.
"It is part of a request that has been made to
the Commonwealth in a priority ordering which
is consistent with the rest of the university's
needs.

According to Nona Gerard. a third year MFA
student. problems arose during rehearsals for
Crease last fall because of inadequate facilities.

“We had no place to rehearse except in what
is called the social room. which has a very hard
concrete floorjust covered with linoleum," said
Gerard. "This kind of cement jams your knees
and throws your back out."

R. A. Ray finally groans out of bed at 1 1:00

on April 2l. Wearing only boxer shorts and a
grimace, he stumbles to the trash room to unload
a year’s worth of iunk. Unlocking the door with
his trusty trash room key, R. A. Ray is met with
a cascade of boxes, books and beer cans.

“Hey, honey," calls a smoky voice from the
bathroom. “You leave your trash bags in your
room. We'll get ‘em for ya. You have a good
summer now.”

R. A. Ray thanks the maid for her

thoughtfulness and sinks back to the huge pile of
underwear on his bed. Exhausted from a year of
sleepless nights and a night oi mindless drinking,
he leans against his trusty bolster. Beside the
milk crate at his feet is an unused bottle of
Windex and a balled-up cleaning rag. Somehow,
miraculously, a tired hall-smile works iis way
into R. A. Ray’s blank gaze. Amid the throbbing
A pain from a lew’too many, a curious thought
emerges. R. A. Ray throws his head back, and
laughs out loud, ‘‘I think I'll do this again next
year."

 Donahue.

TV talk-show host amuses
questions about America ’s lifestyle.

he return of old man winter did not

discourage audience turnout for a lec-

ture sponsored by the Pitt Program
Council, with Phil Donahue, popular television
talk-show host, at the Carnegie Music Hall. Au-
dience members had Donahue answering their
questions for over two and a half hours.

In his lecture, Donahue said the culture in
which he grew up prepared his generation for a
world that did not exist.

“What we realized after leaving the University
of Notre Dame,” Donahue said, “was that we’d
been prepared for a world that never
materialized.”

Donahue said the world of the
19505 and 1960s prepared its
youth for a world in which
women were secondary to men.

“I never trusted [women]
from the neck up . . . These cur-
vaceous women were bad
thoughts,” Donahue said. “At
confession we’d say ‘My Father,
I confess I had 38 bad
thoughts.’ ”

The culture of the 19505 and
1960s, Donahue said, never
prepared its youth for divorce. It
was not until the mid-’70s when
his first marriage dissolved, giv-
ing him custody of his four
children, that Donahue came to
realize the problems women
were facing.

“[I saw] things I
noticed before. My kids’ socks

looked like they'd been

vited me to your house now, I’d

and 24- years of age did not vote in the last
election.

According to Donahue, this lack of respon-
sibility, along with the ill-prepared adolescence
and the infatuation America has with itself, is
hurting its credibility. He said he learned this
when six weeks ago he did a series of Donahue
programs in the Soviet Union.

Donahue said, “I asked audience members,
‘Where would you like to go if you visited the
United States?’ . . . Some said ‘Oxford, Miss.,
home of your great author William Faulkner.’
And I wondered how many Americans knew

they know what’s best for us,” Donahue told his
audience. “Not unlike men in white uniforms in
the basement of the White House.”
they know what’s best for us,” Donahue told his
audience. “Not unlike men in white uniforms in
the basement of the White House.”begun.
“This is not the America I was taught to be
proud of,” said Donahue. “We’ve got to
reassert our democratic inﬂuence over our
government.”
Donahue said the United States appears to
be suffering from a “collective inferiority

complex.”

“We’ve helped rebuild
Europe after the war; we helped
Japan become a major market.
And now nobody likes us,”
Donahue said.

Donahue concluded his lec-
ture by teHing the audience that
Americans must learn to ques-
tion authority and to help end
the problems brought on by the
United States’ lack of credibili-
ty, our educational system’s
faults, and the false world into
which the nation’s youth is
brought.

the question and answer ses-
sion after the lecture kept the
audience inside for more than
90 minutes.

Audience members were
eager to what
Donahue thought of his new
competitor, Oprah Winfrey.
Donahue said he welcomed the
competition, which helped

discover

said.
Another problem facing this country,

Donahue said, is the quality of education.

“We have people out there who don’t know
what eight times seven is,” said Donahue.
“These are the ‘Boys of Summer’ that you pro-
bably see here at Three Rivers’ Stadium —
shirtless males with beer cans who speak a dif-
ferent language: ‘I want to talk about sex.’ ”

Donahue said these people are in need of
education and responsibility. He said statistics
show that 60 percent of all men between 18

that.”

Donahue continued to say that Soviet citizens
read American literature more than Americans.
“There is a fascination with American classics
that I’m not sure exists in our culture — cer-
tainly not with the Boys of Summer,” Donahue
said.

Donahue said Americans are too dependent
upon others in our society. He said we expect
other people to know what’s best for us.

“We still have to deal with people who think

bring more audiences than ever
before to daytime program-
ming in general.

Listeners whether
Donahue would do a week of programs in
Pittsburgh. He said his staff did a week of
Donahue programs in the 1970s at Point Park.

“It rained one day whil--. we were here.”
Donahue said. “It eith-—‘= rains on me or snows
on me.”

That was
Then. . .

In 1960, Atwood Street was two ways.
Students jitterbugged to the music of Elvis,
Chubby Checkers, and The Beach Boys.
Convertibles, pleated skirts, black ﬂats and
THE ORIGINAL HOT DOG SHOP were
“in”.

This Is
Now. . .

Today, Atwood Street is one way. Students
‘ ‘walk like Egyptians” to the sounds of The
Bangles, Bruce Springsteen and Genesis.
Jams, walkmans and jean jackets are the rage.
And THE ORIGINAL ‘HOT DOG SHOP
continues to be one of Oakland’s most popu-
lar eating and drinking establishments.

THE ORIGINAL
H01‘ nos SHOP

at the University of Pittsburgh Since 1960.”

THE BRIDGE.

A bridge is an act of communication. It becomes the
means for movement, for exchange, for commerce. Like a
strong idea in a well-balanced sentence, it connects people
to each other.

Pittsburgh is a ci of many bridges; a city where
much is communicated. nd the largest communicator in
Pittsburgh is Ketchum Advertising.

We are the bridge for many of Pittsburgh’s top
corporations: we deliver their messages to their audiences,
providing sturdy, direct xplassage across the murky waters
of markets and trends. e span the gap, linking people
to people, getting results.

Maybe that’ s why we’re so at home in this many-
bridged city. We can’t imagine doing a more important job.
Or being in a more important place.

Joseph Heller
Author of Catch-22 highlighted Conference.

   

oseph Heller, author of the classic book

‘I Catch-22, spoke about his writings and ex-
periences this Spring at Tenth Annual

University of Pittsburgh Writers’ Conference.

Heller, the keynote speaker of the con-
ference, told the more than 700 people who
filled the Assembly Room of the William Pitt
Union that he made a discovery while still in
elementary school.

“I found out that in this country anybody can
become a writer,” Heller said. “All you need is
a typewriter and some paper.”

Heller explained that after he submitted a
story for publication he made a second
discovery: not everybody who wants to be a
writer can become a published writer.

Heller said that it was not until college, after
World War II, that he ﬁnally became a pub-
lished writer.

“In college, I took a class in fiction writing
. . . Everything I wrote I submitted for publica-
tion to every magazine in existence.”

Heller remembered “The New Yorker gives

such swift rejections.”

Marshall Clark photo

,#

But Heller said that he did get two handwrit-
ten rejections from Esquire and The Atlantic
Monthly saying they liked what he wrote but
suggested revisions.

“I had [three] more stories published,”
Heller said. “I became a campus celebrity, ex-
cept NYU has no campus.”

Heller said that he quickly found out that
even if everything he wrote was published, he
could not comfortably live on that salary. He
said he then decided to go to graduate school.

Heller told his audience that while attending
graduate school at Columbia, he decided to
write a novel. He proceeded to write the first
few chapters of what was to become Catch-22
while working at an advertising agency.

Heller said he then spent the next two and a
half years working on Catch-22.

But writing the book seemed to be an easier
task than getting it published. “I took it to eight
or nine publishers.”

Robert Gotlieb, of Simon and Schuster, final-
ly accepted the manuscript. “I got a contract

and a $1,500 advance,” Heller said.

The reviews for Catch-22 were not,
Heller recalled, raving. “The Sunday
Times book review said [that] ‘Catch-22 gasps
for want of sense.’ "
Eventually, the book sold 2 million copies.
Heller said that he then decided to work on
other books.

His next novels include Something Happened
and As Good As Gold. Both novels were a hit
with readers.

Heller’s next novel, God Knows, was inter-
rupted by a paralyzing illness. Heller told the
audience that one day in 1981 he had trouble
swallowing. He became worried when he tried
to cross his legs and couldn’t. He said he wore
tube socks because he didn’t have the strength
to separate stretch socks.

“I called my doctor,” and he said, ‘It sounds
like Cullain-Barre,’ ” Heller said.

While recovering in the hospital, Heller fell
in love with his nurse, who he intends to marry
this summer.

His first non—fiction book, No Laughing Mat-
ter, co-written with Speed Vogel, documents
Heller’s illness and recovery.

The audience’s reaction to Heller was en-
thusiastic. Listeners said that they enjoyed
hearing his readings from his books.

Pat Patterson, an audience member, said
that she liked hearing about Catch-22. “I had
to read it when I was in college 20 years ago. It
was great hearing him in person — hearing the
update on the new novels.”

Frank Rowe, another member of the au-
dience, said that the speech was inspirational to
him. “Joe Heller has demonstrated great
strength and indeed heroism in coming back
from Cuillain-Barre syndrome."

Lee Cutkind, founder of the University of
Pittsburgh Writers’ Conference, said that he
was pleased with the turnout. “We've probably
had twice as many people through here this
time than ever before, and all of our other con-
ferences were well attended.”

Cutkind said that he was looking forward to
next year. “This [the Writer’s Conference] is
one of those things where you never know if
there will be a next year, but I hope there is.”

arking the official opening of Pitt’s

bicentennial, educators from across

the country and Pitt officials gathered
at the Syria Mosque for the opening Bicenten-

Kingman Brewster and David A. Hamburg. The
two were awarded honorary degrees following a
processional from the Cathedral lawn.

Led by drum and ﬂute group dressed in
Revolutionary War costumes, the processional
included an ROTC Color Guard and various
student organizations. Representatives of many
of Pitt’s schools as well as presidents of other
universities followed.

Many of the delegates were present for the
Association of American Universities meeting,
held at Pitt for the ﬁrst time since it became a
member in 1974-. The AAU, comprised of 57
of the best research universities in the country,
met to discuss the future of American college
education.

Brewster is currently master of the University
College at Oxford. He formerly served as U.S.
ambassador to the United Kingdom and as
president of Yale University where he ad-
vocated social and academic reform.

“Brewster was chosen because he is a sym-
bol of the ceremonial academic group to be at
the convocation,” Harry Kunselman of the
bicentennial planning office said earlier this
fall.

Brewster’s speech focused on
achievement of American higher education and
the responsibilities colleges have to the rest of
the community.

“Our charge [as university leaders] is not the
custody of proof. Our charge is the custody of
the pursuit of truth,” Brewster said.

Brewster advised the assembled presidents
of the need for increased communication be-

Bicentennial Ball

Pitt rolls out the red carpet.

rom the beginning of the University of
F Pittsburgh Founders Day Ball at 8 p.m.

Saturday, February 28, in the William
Pitt Union to its conclusion almost five hours
later, one word sprang to mind again and again:
extravagance.

The red carpet was literally rolled out to
welcome over 2,000 guests representing 14
states, the District of Columbia and the British
Virgin Islands. Faculty, staff, trustees, alumnae
and friends of the university were treated to a
night of elegance that was the highlight of the
Pitt bicentennial celebration.

Two orchestras, Guy Lombardo’s Royal
Canadians and George Gee and His
Makebelieve Ballroom Orchestra, entertained
in the Ballroom and the Assembly Room, while
Mitch DeVall’s Basin Street Band played Dix-
ieland music in the Concourse Room.

In the Lower Lounge, guests were treated to
classical flute and piano performances by Paul
Hoffman and Helen Bledsoe, who are Mildred

Miller Posvar Scholars of Music.

Throughout the evening, special events were
accompanied by the Pitt Marching Band Herald
Trumpeters, who performed a fanfare specially
composed for the bicentennial by 0’Neill San-
ford, director of bands, and the Third U.S. In-
fantry (the Old Guard) Fife and Drum Corps.

At 9:15 p.m., Mildred Posvar led the singing
of “Happy Birthday” after a short welcome
from President Wesley Posvar. He then cut the
7-tiered, 4-foot-high birthday cake —— complete
with 200 candles that took seven people five
minutes to light — with a ceremonial sword
provided by the Fort Pitt Museum. “Let’s live it
up!” he instructed the guests.

Following the birthday celebration, comedian
Robert Wolke, better known as the director of
the Office of Faculty Development and a
chemistry professor, presented a monologue on
“The ‘Real’ History of the University of
Pittsburgh.”

At 11:55 p.m., guests watched a skit featur-

Lavish buffets were set up throughout the
union, including an Americana buffet in the
Kurtzman Room, a Cajun buffet in the Con-
course Room and a pasta buffet in the
Assembly Room. On display in the Grand
Lounge was the new orchid hybrid named in
honor of the bicentennial (Cym. Bicentennial
Pitt); however, it was dwarfed by the 10-foot
tall ice sculpture of the Cathedral of Learning.

According to Posvar, the ball was an ap-
propriate celebration of 200 years of achieve-
ment. Even though the event was open to
everyone, few students attended.

CONDOMS

on CAMPUS
A.-.

At least 1.5 million people in the U.S. today

IDS is no longer just a “gay” disease or
a drug users disease, it is everybody’s

carry the AIDS virus. Each one of these people
puts his or her partner or partners, as the case
may be, at risk, and many students fear con-
tracting the fatal disease.

The AIDS virus can be transmitted between
two people during intimate sexual contact. Ob-
viously, the best method for eliminating the risk
of contracting the virus is to abstain from sexual
activity. However, those who are sexually active
and intend to remain so, must practice “safe
sex.”

According to a pamphlet published by U.S.
News and World Report, the condom adequate-
ly serves as a shield against the virus and other
sexually transmitted diseased. Condom use has
been proven to be almost 90 percent effective.

However, the report said many sexually ac-
tive students engage in casual sex without using
a condom.

One speculation for the lack of condom use
is the unavailability of condoms to students.
Many colleges are considering installing con-
dom vending machines on campus.

“I have not heard that Pitt will be installing
any such condom machines in the near future,”
Janet DeVoe, a nurse and health educator at
Pitt said. “The best way to get the University to
take action on such a project would be for the
students to request that they want the condom
vending machines.

“I think that condom machines on campus is
a good idea. Students should be encouraged to

use condoms if they are unsure whether their
partners have a sexually transmitted disease.”

“I don’t see there being any problem with
condom machines on campus,” said Pitt Health
Pharmacist Joseph Mance. “It would make con-
doms more available to the students.”

Mance said condom sales have noticeably
risen in the Student Health pharmacy since the
AIDS crisis made news, especially within the
past 6-8 months.

“Students are becoming aware of the disease
and its transmission and are doing something
about it,” Mance said.

Nevertheless, there is a difference of opinion
as to whether condom vending machines should
be installed on campus.

“Condom machines as well as education
about safer sex should not influence people who
do not have sex to do so,” said DeVoe.

“Abstination is the best prevention for
transmitting AIDS, but that is not going to hap-
pen. For those people who already have sex and
intend to continue, education about the matter
is beneficial.”

Mance agreed. “I don’t think that condom
vending machines would promote sex to those
who abstain,” he said.

Some Pitt students think the
machines would be a good idea.

“I would think that condom machines on

vending

campus would be helpful. This would give

Farinella, a mechanical engineering student.

own choice,

“There’s enough press on the subject of
AIDS for students to know about the risks.”

Are we
practicing

“Safe Sex? ”

“I think that condom vending machines on
campus is a good idea — in restrooms,” said
Pitt student Michelle LaBrie.

Senior pharmacy major Laurie Trilli agreed.
“If students are going to engage in sex they
may as well protect themselves. Condom vend-
ing machines would probably make condoms
more readily available to students,” she said.

However, some students don’t like the idea.

“When I think of condom machines,” said
Chris Phillips, a business economics major, “I
think of a dirty, dingy bar . . . I think it’s best
for students who want condoms to buy them in
the student health pharmacy or one of the near-
by drugstores,” Phillips said.

Whether students agree or disagree about
condom machine installation on campus, the
AIDS crisis still remains.

SCB President Phil Moyer supports the idea
of condom machine installation on Pitt’s
Oakland campus. “Since condoms are the only
effective means of protection (from) AIDS for
those who are sexually active, I think that the
university has the responsibility to adequately
supply them to the students,” he said. “Con-
dom vending machines would make condoms
accessible to the students.”

“There has been no talk of a ‘condom day’ at
Pitt, but the issues concerning the subject are of
major concern to the student community,”
Moyer said. “I think we need condom machines
on campus to protect against AIDS.”

but the people who use them use them so that

and that’s immoral. We can’t condone immoral,

soon-to-be epidemic. There are occasional,
brief glimpses of success, but liberal estimates

there nothing we can do?

Consider the condom —-— a simple device
that’s been around for centuries and has been
proven to prevent the transmission of AIDS.
Widescale use of the condom could be exactly
what we need to hold off the spread of AIDS
until medical science finds a cure.

However, selling condoms in gas station
men’s rooms and in the pages of skin
magazines is not going to promote the wide
scale increase of their use that is necessary.
The condom industry has to come out of the
dark ages. Make that, our society has to come
out of the dark ages.

Fundamentalists may wail and moan about
condoning sexual practices that run counter to
“Cod’s Law.” I think that containing a killer
disease is more pleasing to God than following a
series of illogical behavior restrictions.

Concerned parents will be upset because

as much as anyone.

All three major television stations in Pitts-
burgh refuse to air the ads for condoms. Afraid
of offending their viewers, I guess. WPXI will
show Bud Dwyer blow his head off and claim
it’s not sensationalising, but they will bury their
heads in the sand when presented with the
chance to help the public.

In U.S. News’ special report on AIDS, it said
that since the AIDS virus can take as long as 10
years after transmission to bring on the symp-
toms of the disease, people can spread it
without having the idea they were carriers. So,
in effect, when you sleep with somebody, you’re
also sleeping with everyone they’ve slept with
for the last 10 years. Pretty morbid stuff.

But all is not lost. The use of a condom will
significantly reduce your chances of contracting
the disease, and it will keep your partners safe,
too. Just to make sure that everyone knows all
of this vital information, condom ads not only
should be aired in the major media, they must
be.

And besides, everyone's wearing latex this

AIDS publicity overshadows, danger of
other forms of VD  

. _ IDS is dominating the headlines, but
A other sexually transmitted diseases still
a fect millions, including another virus believed
to cause cancer that is “spreading in epidemic
proportions,” researchers say. a

Sexual contact has become the chief form of
transmission of one form of hepatitis, a liver
disease. Chances of getting such diseases as
herpes, chlamydia, gonorrhea and syphilis are
vastly higher than the odds of getting AIDS.

“Because of the consequences of AIDS, it’s
very easy to say these other sexually transmit-
ted diseases are just nuisances. “You don’t die,
generally, from gonorrhea or syphilis and cer-
tainly not from chlamydia,” said Dr. Jonathan
Zenilman of the Division of Sexually Transmit-
ted Diseases at the Atlanta-based national
Center for Disease Control.

“But there’s a danger of them getting lost in
the shuffle. They are still very much important
health problems,” he said.

AIDS has struck more than 33,000 people
in the United States, so far killing more than
19,000. In 1986 alone, 12,049 cases of AIDS
were diagnosed in the United States, the CDC
reports.

. y ; But there were more than l3 million cases of
V other sexually transmitted diseases in that same

year, according to CDC estimates. Last year’s
total included 896,383 reported cases of

gonorrhea, up from 883,826 a year earlier but i

down from 1,042,900 in 1980. Researchers
say reported cases are the tip of the iceberg; the
true incidence of gonorrhea is estimated at two
million to three million cases in 1986.

Other estimates include four million to five
million cases of chlamydia, one million cases of

genital warts from human papilloma virus,

500,000 new herpes cases and 90,000 cases
of syphilis, Zenilman said.

Human papilloma virus of HPV, a cause of
venereal warts, was thought to be just a
nuisance, but new research is strongly pointing
to the virus as a cause of cancer, he said. The
virus can also cause anal cancer, most often in
homosexual men, and squamous cell cancers in
the mouth, he said.

“I think HPV is probably going to be the
disease of the ’80’s and ’90’s,” said Dr. Alan
Lawhead, assistant professor of gynecology and
obstretrics at Atlanta’s Emory University and a
specialist in HPV research. Researchers believe
HPV can spread even when warts are not ob-
vious, he noted. As many as 10 percent of
women who show no symptoms of HPV-related
disease may be infected.

Although hepatitis B, a type of contagious
liver disease, is not commonly considered a
“sexually transmitted disease,” sexual contact
has become the chief mode of transmission,

Zenilman said. Scientists estimate L that
200,000 cases occurred in the United States
last year, 10 percent of those patients becoming
chronic carriers of the disease.

Herpes “really does not cause a life-
threatening condition, but it certainly causes
substantial emotional trauma to anybody and
their sexual partners, because it’s prone to
recur over and over again,” Zenilman said. And
scientists have recently learned that, contrary to
a long-held belief, herpes is contagious when it
is dormant and no lesions are present.

Gonorrhea and chlamydia can cause
urethritis in men, but the greatest danger is for
women. If infected and not adequately treated,
women can develop pelvic inﬂammatory
disease, which leads to infertility or even to
potentially fatal ectopic, or tubal, pregnancies.
CDC statisticians say they aren’t encouraged
because such diseases are down as much as 80
percent among gay men in some communities.

“Somehody’s making up the difference,”
Zenilman said. “There’s more occurring in the
heterosexual population than ever before, and
it’s extremely disturbing.”

Unlike other major health problems, AIDS
mainly strikes sexually active adults in their
prime working years.

“The selective involvement of young and
middle-aged adults, including business and
government people and members of other
social, economic and political elites, leads to a
potential for economic and political destabiliza-
tion in areas of the developing world severely
affected by HIV (the AIDS virus),” Mann said.
“What political system could withstand for long
the destabilizing inﬂuence of a 20 or 25 per-
cent higher HIV infection among young

During Pitt’s Health Fair
this fall, representatives
from the Allegheny County
Health Department were
among those who were
promoting “safe sex” on
campus.

 

U. of Penn claims
“Condoms are in.’ ”

niversity of Pennsylvania officials, try-

ing to combat sexually transmitted
diseases including AIDS, handed out more than
1,500 condoms to students this winter.

The Condom Awareness Day was part of an
educational effort that included lectures, ﬁlms,
workshops and small group discussions on sex-
ually transmitted diseases.

“We have a whole generated of college
students that has grown up without ever having
to look a condom in the eye,” said Christie
Lyman, a social worker at Penn’s Student
Health Service, which co-sponsored the project
with the Ofﬁce of Student Life.

I-land-in-Hand

Handicapped kids enjoy annual festival.

he sight of a young child on a college
campus is curious in most cases;

several hundred were seen wandering
in Forbes Quad this Spring.

The Ninth Annual Hand-in-Hand festival was
held once again this year in Forbes Quadrangle.

The festival, which is organized by Pitt
volunteer students, brought in approximately
300 mentally and physically handicapped
children from the Pittsburgh area.

Lekeena Pryor, age 3, said her favorite part
of the program was getting her picture taken
with some of the clowns.

Her “buddy,” one of the volunteer students,
was Nikki Michalides, a freshman psychology
major.

Michalides said that at first Pryor missed her
mother but within a short time she was laughing
and having fun.

Throughout the first and second floor of
Forbes Quadrangle were over 30 booths with
various games and prizes for the children.

Eddie Rawson, age 8, accumulated prizes
such as a deputy badge given by the Allegheny
County Sheriffs Department.

Also present was the Pirate Parrot, the Ken—
tucky Fried Chicken and Cumby. All three were

big hits with the children.

“I like bowling best,” said Gary Lee Beltz,
one of this year’s participants, as he happily
remembered his strike.

The day was not only enjoyable for the
children but for the student volunteers as well.

“I just thought it was a good opportunity to
help these kids,” said Shawn Danday, a
sophomore political science major. “l know that
they look forward to this day all year, so what is
one day out of my year?”

Michalides said, “I was really interested in
this [the festival]. I’m thinking about going into
psychology, so I thought this would be good ex-
perience, too.”

Activities for the children included more than
the game booths. Various acts kept some of the
children entertained for the afternoon. Skits in-
cluded puppet acts, which were both entertain-
ing and educational.

Sign language was used to communicate to
the deaf children. One of the most popular
events was a performance of the Wham song,
“Wake Me Up Before You Co Co.” Stage ac-
tors signed the song and many of the children
followed suit. Enthusiastic audience members
rushed the stage to dance.

The Pitt Cheerleaders also appeared for the
children in the morning.

Also represented at the festival was the
Pittsburgh Zoo, who brought
volunteers —— four human and five non-human.

The non-human included Rocky the boa con-
strictor; Peter the rabbit; Alicia the opossum;
Mystic the albino ferret and Gertrude the
guinea pig.

Volunteer Dick Miller said the animals were

along nine

chosen because “they are easy for the children
to touch and feel.”

All the volunteers were required to attend a
meeting discussing procedures on handling
potential problems with the children. Each
volunteer was given a short medical sheet on
the child assigned for them that day.

The money to finance the Hand-in-Hand
festival came partly from SGB allocations and
partly from donations from different organiza-
tions in the Pittsburgh area.

from a lack of recognition.

“I write on the Afro/American ex-

Pain examines a turbulent love relation»

Yes, Pittsburgh was just about to shed its
rust belt image. That is, until a correspondent
did a rather disturbing story during the last
half-hour of the broadcast. Its true that Pitts-
burgh has come a long way in recent years.
High tech is revolutionizing our city’s economic
base.

However, the report at the end of the show
said that something was being trampled by this
revolution, and that something is people. The
very people who, through their sweat and hard
work, brought about Pittsburgh’s original pro-
sperity — now the former steel workers.

The Today report centered on the plight of a
few unemployed families from the Mon Valley.
The reporter interviewed these families and
followed them through the skeletal remains of
what once were financially secure towns. Soup

Cathedral of Learning

Dream helped turn the University around.

he Cathedral of Learning is the Univer-

sity of Pittsburgh’s ofﬁcial symbol for

this bicentennial year. As the center of

this year’s celebration, the Cathedral
has been specially adorned with gold lights on
its upper floors and blue and gold ﬂags at the
peaks of its successive buttresses. Its picture
graces the cover of sports programs, recruiting
material, special edition notebooks, and even
Pitt: The Story of the University of Pittsburgh,
1 787-1987, an interesting and insightful look at
Pitt’s history by Robert Alberts.

But, why choose such a “grey and dreary”
symbol for this bicentennial year? Maybe,
because the Cathedral of Learning is the only
skyscraper classroom building in the “free”
world. On the other hand, everyone knows the
Cathedral and they surely cannot miss it rising
high and proud over our campus. However, the
most notable reason may be written in the
history of this historic landmark.

The University of Pittsburgh was on the edge
of ﬁnancial ruin when John Bowman became
Chancellor in 1921. Major changes would be
necessary if the University was to survive. Most
important among these changes was the need
for space. The University was cramped into

immediately came up with the plan for a
building which appeared to grow to higher and
higher levels. Clauder completed the designs by
the end of 1924.

Chancellor Bowman presented Clauder’s
plans for a 52-story building to a cynical Board
of Trustees. This mix between a Gothic
cathedral and a modern skyscraper would be
more than twice the size of any building in Pitt-
sburgh. Skeptical over its height, questions
were raised over whether the building would
sway or if elevators would be impractical or

The campaign that followed was a classic exam-
ple of Pittsburgh spirit and determination. In a
three month period of 1925, $10 million was
raised by the industries and people of Pitt-
sburgh. 17,000 individuals and 97,000 school
children received personalized certiﬁcates ad-
mitting them to the “fellowship of thebuilders of
the Cathedral of Learning” for their contribu-
tions. The names of every contributor are
enclosed in the cornerstone located in the Com-
mons Room of the Cathedral of Learning.

The groundbreaking ceremony took place on
September 27, 1926. For the next eleven years
Chancellor Bowman fought depressions and
strikes as the Cathedral of Learning slowly took
form. After the massive steel frame was built,
engineers worked from the top down to insure
the building would be its ﬁnally designed 42-
stories. On June 4, 1937, Chancellor Bowman
laid the cornerstone, signifying the completion
of the Cathedral of Learning.

The building of the Cathedral of Learning
was a turning point in the University of Pitt-
sburgh’s history. The University found a new
focus on the lower campus. Pitt could now ex-
pand and develop without the burden of limited
space and tight ﬁnances. Alumni associations

quarters one-third the necessary size. In §
November of 1921, Frick Acres, the present;
site of the Cathedral of Learning, was bought 
for two million dollars. Chancellor Bowman had_§

portant part of Pitt’s history since the 19205.

University. Next would be the decision of how O

to expand.

Charles Clauder was hired as architect in
February of 1924. Clauder was a leading col-
legiate architect, responsible for famous
buildings at Yale, Princeton, Duke and many
other colleges. Bowman demanded of Clauder
“more than a schoolhouse.” He wanted “a
powerful and lasting stimulus to the work of the
University.” A building that would “carry the
message that education was the result of aspir-
ing to great heights.” With this in mind,
Clauder started creating the designs for the tall
building. He went through draft after draft of
sketches, but Bowman rejected them all. Finally
one morning around 4 o’clock, Bowman and
Clauder had eliminated dozens of possible
plans, and both were becoming irritable. In
order to relax they began listening to Magic
Fire Music from Die Walkure.

Suddenly the two men became inspired by
the crescendoing climaxes of the music. They

dangerous. Some argued the design was not in
the tradition of college architecture and would
lead to the commercialization of education. An
extreme pessimist insisted students would fall
or jump out of the windows.

By addressing the University’s desperate
need for space, all of these doubts were refuted.
With engineers and architects at this side,
Chancellor Bowman brought out the many ad-
vantages of a tall building: better light and ven-
tilation, savings on heating costs, more time for
students between classes and better student to
faculty accessibility. With limited dissension,
the plans for the Cathedral of Learning were
accepted.

The only thing holding back Chancellor
Bowman’s dream was the necessary ﬁnances.

During World War II, over 4,000 soldiers
trained at the University of Pittsburgh using the
Cathedral of Learning as barracks. In the
1960s, blacks blocked themselves into the
Cathedral protesting treatment by the Universi-
ty. Most recently, protests against Pitt’s in-
vestments in South Africa have focused on the
Cathedral.

Chancellor Bowman’s desire for a “powerful
and lasting stimulus” has been realized in the
Cathedral of Learning. It seems only ﬁtting on
this bicentennial year, as our University is
“aspiring to great heights,” The Cathedral of
Learning stands tall and proud as our ofﬁcial
bicentennial symbol.

Ice-Cream Contest

Area ice-cream parlors are deliciously-diﬁferent.

strawberry ice-cream is gone. In today’s
modern times, Pitt students have the op-

era chocolate, vanilla

T

tion of choosing such ﬂavors as Sticky Bun
Pecan, Burnt Cinnamon, Pineapple Coconut
Dream, and Peach Schnapps.

The places to buy such bizarre flavors are far
from scarce in Oakland and the surrounding
area. Any real connoisseur of the delicious,
creamy treat might consider the area an ice-
cream haven.

Six of the most popular places on campus
where students can go are Dave and Andy’s,
Baskin Robbins, Goodies, Pace’s Ice
Creamery, Hilary’s and Haagen-Dazs. Each has
its own atmosphere and original ﬂavors to at-
tract people.

A student survey places Dave and Andy’s at
the top of the list as the most popular caterer of
homemade ice-cream and homemade cones.
The wafﬂe cones are made fresh daily and give
off a sweet aroma that is evident as students ap-
proach Atwood Street.

The atmosphere is deﬁnitely appealing to
students. Those waiting to be served are enter-
tained by watching the ice-cream being made
and listening to Top 40 music hits.

Twelve delicious ﬂavors are kept on hand.
The extra creamy, rich consistency according to
the owner is achieved during production by
adding Traditional vanilla and
chocolate are available and are accompanied by
ﬂavors like Chocolate Peanut Butter, Pumpkin,
Chocolate Chip and their best seller, Cookies
and Cream.

less air.

Real chocolate lovers might choose one of
the many “Addins” to complement their choice
of ice cream. Mixed into the ice-cream are real
chunks of Reese’s Peanut Butter Cup, Snickers
or Twix.

And, for all of this, you get ‘fmore for your
money,” says owner Andy Hardie. A mouth-
watering homemade cone (or a new homemade
chocolate chip cone) with ﬁve ounces of
delicious homemade ice-cream is only $1.20.

The second most popular ice-cream shop in
the Oakland area is Baskin Robbins. They offer
“3l” ﬂavors ranging from traditional to out-of-
the-ordinary. Students tease their taste buds
with Southern Pecan Pie, Pistachio Almond,
and Daiquiri Ice. Pralines and Cream leads the
list as the most popular ﬂavor.

The small shop is located on Fifth and At-
wood. Ample seating allows students to enjoy

70 Ice-Cream Eateries

the delicious treat in a bright atmosphere of pink
and brown decor. A single cone is only 78¢. The
goal of Baskin Robbins is to “promote happiness
and send our customers away satisﬁed,” says
manager Steve Chodder. “It’s our ‘secret ingre-
dients’ that made it special.”

Another local competitor in the ice-cream
business is Goodies. This popular shop is on At-
wood Street, and here students walk into an
old-fashioned candy store atmosphere. The
wooden ﬂoor creaks as they make their way

past the glass candy display case and to the
ice-cream located in the back. A chalkboard
lists the ﬂavors of the day. Students have made

Goodies. This ﬂavor has even been renamed
Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough by students
because of the surprising resemblance to
mom’s real chocolate chip cookie dough!

Students looking for super-priced ice-cream
in a super setting are willing to take extra time
to walk to Pace’s Ice Creamery on South Craig
Street. The wide variety is deﬁnitely worth the
trip. At 94¢ per four ounce scoop, students can
treat themselves to Coffee, Peach, or Peanut
Butter Swirl. They can go for something a little
more “special” (a little higher priced) like
Caramel Nut Sundae or Vanilla Swiss. For the
calorie conscious student, there is a selection of
fruity sherbets.

Small, round ice-cream parlor tables and
chairs are arranged under a sky-light. Huge
windows allow an outside View as students relax
and enjoy their ice-cream.

Some students are willing to take a bus into
Shadyside for a special palette pleasing treat.
According to the manager of Hillary’s on
Walnut Street, “we want to give people a dif-
ferent experience, something more than tradi-
tional ice-cream — the ‘Hillary experience’.” It
is an “experience” good enough for Learning
Unlimited Magazine to have chosen Hillary’s as
having the best ice-cream in the city. A unique
atmosphere certainly creates a mood for ice-
cream eating. The ice-cream parlor look is
complete with small, round marble tables and
colorful Tiffany lamps hanging from the ceiling.
It is a perfect setting for enjoying some of their
most popular 'ﬂavors — White Chocolate
Macadamia Nut or Double Oreo. Other students
can ﬁll a homemade cone with one of their
special gourmet ﬂavors like Myers Rum Raisin
for $1.94. It is expensive, but Kathy Stahl
doesn’t mind, “it’s worth the price.” Students
also have fun creating their own banana splits

and sundaes. Those watching weight can try a.

few low calorie ounces of sherbet or yogurt.

Another shop in the Shadyside area is
Haagen-Dazs. Like Raybans and camels’ hair, it
is both popular and expensive. Cookies and
Cream, Vanilla, and Peanut Butter are the most
popular of the factory—made ice-cream ﬂavors.
Manager Steve Dines says, “Our biggest com-
petition is someone deciding to buy a candy bar
rather than try our ice-cream. After they taste
our ice-cream, they’ll know it’s the best.”

The corner shop is small and does not offer a
parlor-like atmosphere. It is for the student to
decide after experiencing the delicious treat how
much a great atmosphere really matters!

It seems that this year Pitt students are going
for the homemade cone. The traditional wafer
and sugar cones are becoming extinct as
homemade cones add an interesting touch to
ice-cream eating. According to some Pitt
students, there is no better way to enjoy
homemade cones than eating one filled with rich,
creamy homemade ice-cream. Despite the large
variety of ﬂavors offered by the numerous
Oakland shops, Cookies and Cream is the ﬂavor
Pitt students prefer the most.

sometimes you just need to get out at

night, and Oakland is the place to be! If
you want to catch a movie, there’s the Kings

Pittsburgh Playhouse. The Pitt Program Coun-
cil also sponsors movies in David Lawrence
Auditorium.

The Pittsburgh Playhouse stages plays, as
does Carnegie Music Hall and the Pitt Studio

year by the Syria Mosque, Carnegie Music Hall,
the Jewish Community Center, and for the most
culturally inclined -—— Frick Fine Arts building.
The Mosque sponsors mainly rock artists, but
also oldies like Tom Jones. The Pitt Program
Council also organizes coffee-houses, which
feature student talent.

For dining, the Oakland area offers many

During the fall robberies and general harass-
ment increased to a point at which the
Pittsburgh police were forced to place an in-
creased patrol in the Oakland area. This didn’t
really stop the students from ‘cruisin’ the cam-
pus, but it certainly restricted them. More often,
students went out in large groups, and stayed
together. They also watched the time a bit
more. The increased crime made everyone
realize that they weren’t as safe as they had
thought. It made more people aware, and more

A meter maid ’s dream is every

c0mmuter’s nightmare.

arking at Pitt. Geez, what a title. Where

should I begin? Would it be appropriate

to start with the ever-aggressive Pitts-
burgh meter maids? That could be a story in
itself. In fact, Pittsburgh Magazine devoted a
whole page to meter maids in their March 1987
issue.

The last thing I’d like to do is complain about
these “women-in-blue.” They’re only doing
their job. Someone has to make sure the city
isn’t cheated out of its revenue. And we know
that the city of Pittsburgh needs as much
revenue as it can get right now. After all, the
city is trying to raise funds for a new airport.

But, honestly, I feel bad for the meter maids
at times. First of all I know that I could never
walk all day long. That’s very difﬁcult. But
things get worse for these poor ladies. They
have to deal with frustrated students who just
got nabbed with a parking ticket. I can’t im-
agine anything scarier than seeing an angry col-
lege student charging at me at an inhuman
speed, with an inhuman facial expression.

My Aunt Betty is a meter maid. We no longer
speak since I received my first ticket last year. I
see her on campus every once in a while, but
that’s as far as it goes. I deserved every ticket I
got. It’s just that they’re not much fun. Come on
ladies, college is hard enough.

Think about it, half of Pitt’s student body
consists of commuters. Who knows how many
of them drive to school? Lots, probably. And I
know there has to be more students than park-
ing spaces. Each day, the streets and parking
lots turn into a combat zone as poor com-
muters, including myself, fight for the handful
of spots. But it’s not just students looking for
parking. There are business people, visitors to
the Carnegie, tourist, you name it. There are
those few who are “lucky” enough to find a
parking spot. But most likely these spaces are
only good for a half an hour, or, heaven forbid,
in a 4--6 pm tow away zone. Face it, parking in
Oakland is a commuter’s nightmare.

And you know what? This problem’s been
around for a long time. You see, I was ﬂipping

through some old yearbooks, and I stumbled

across the funniest cartoon in the 1975 book. It
was of this fat meter maid, parachuting down on
top of a car at the very second that the meter
went “ping!” And I said to myself, “Wait a
minute! I guess this problem’s old news!” So
what’s the deal? Why hasn’t anything been
done about this yet? I mean, I guess I could use

 

some of the parking garages, like the ones by
the hospitals. But somehow I don’t think my
budget could stand it.

So you see, this problem of parking, (or lack
of it, I should say), is something that Pitt
students have had to deal with for years. And
still nothing has been done. And you know what
else? I’ve heard rumors about building a huge

underground student garage at Schenley Plaza
and no one’s making a move! What the heck?
So what are we to do in the meantime? I
guess just cross our ﬁngers and hope someone
wakes up and smells the pollution and decides
to make some long-overdue changes. Until then
lots of questions float through my mind.
Wouldn’t it be nice to have parking that’s not

 

metered? What’s the point of half hour parking?
Why aren't there meter men? It makes you
think. Maybe I’ll give my Aunt Betty a call. She
might know.

omething can be done about the problem
S of drug abuse among America’s young

people. This is what First Lady Nancy
Reagan told Pittsburgh anti-drug action groups
this fall.

Mrs. Reagan was in Pittsburgh in late
September to complete taping of The Chemical
People II at WQUE-TV. It was the sequel to an
anti-drug and alcohol-abuse program that has
led to the formation of community action
groups across the state.

“We will fight against drugs wherever they
are,” said Reagan. “No one said it would be a
quick fix.”

In the documentary entitled A Generation At
Risk, Reagan told us, “Young people today are
facing the terrifying spector of drug and alcohol
abuse . . . But something can be done.”

C’mon Nancy, The Mod Squad isn’t on anymore

or those of us growing up during the
F rise and fall of the drug culture, scenes

from shows like The Mod Squad can be
rather humorous. The show often dealt with
drugs and the strange lives of those who used
them.

The cops in other shows were always very
straight-laced and condescending toward the
ushers because they knew the kids would even-
tually grow out of this stage of experimentation
and confusion — or they would die from the
experience.

The fashion of those who flashed on our
screens was always anti-society — strange
designs in their shirts and greasy long hair.
There would be things like “Flower Power”
printed in some awful-looking, overblown let-
tering. Somewhere on the shirt would be a
drawing of a daisy. I don’t know what the big
deal with flowers was, or why the daisy was the
flower of choice, but that’s what I remember
seeing.

Today we have shows like Miami Vice and
movies like Scarface to show us where this stuff
is coming from. The drug scene has changed
from one of distant experimentation to a study
in quality. It is not a matter of getting chemicals
and seeing what they will do to you anymore.
Today, the drug-user’s concern is quality.

High Times magazine arose from the advent
of the drug culture. Once a magazine about the

experience of drugs, it has become the source
for information on what the quality of drugs
should be.

The magazine's principal focus is still on
marijuana. But the focus has changed from the
people who use the drug to the drug itself. Take
for instance the letters sent to “Dr Ed.” Ed
Rosenthal offers advice in each issued in Ask
Ed.

For instance:

Dear Ed,

A good friend turned me on to a few Humboldt
County buds. I found six seeds in the smoke. I ’m
moving to Arizona. How would the seeds grow
with the difference in
elevation?

Thanks,

Rialto, CA

soil, climate and

Rosenthal proceeds to offer advice, saying
the soil can be “adjusted to meet the fertility
needs of the plant,” and “the change in eleva-
tion should have little effect upon the plants,"
among other botanical things.

Though the focus of the magazine has chang-
ed, there is still much of the old language stick-
ing with the culture.

So what does all this mean? is it good, bad or

not even worth discussing?

Some say the change has come with the ad-
vent of yuppiedom. The fad that once made
young urban professionals material for national
magazine covers has died, but many of the traits
associated with it remain.

One of those was a desire for the best of
everything. This desire has struck in many
areas, and one seems to be in the drug culture.

The situation is not good in terms of what
Nancy Regan wants to see. Were things the way
she would like to see them, there would be no
drugs at all. But drugs have become a part of
the culture, no longer separate as they once
were.

The change in the attitude about drugs by
users has brought better things. There was a
time when drugs were used with no thought.
Many are now thinking about what they are
using.

Drugs can be a bad thing. lf they are used in-
telligently the harm can be reduced. Ed Rosen-
thal and Hight Times seem to have grasped
that. As long as drugs are a part of life, I’m go-
ing to relax a little and take comfort in that too.

The capitalist way to take a drug test

Texas business man has started a new
enterprise that he hopes will eventually
make him hundreds of thousands of
dollars. His company is called Urico. and the
service it provides can be summed up in the
first few words of the newspaper advertisement
the businessman has placed:
"Pure! Human Urine. No illegal
substances!”
The Texan who only identifies himself as
Sam said, “With so many businesses and
government agencies giving urine tests to
employees and prospective employees, there is

3 need for this service.

99 ..

Many people are un-

L

doubtedly aware that they have drugs in their
urine. We send them urine that is drug free. We
don’t tell them what to do with it, but its pretty
obvious that they submit it instead of their own
urine.”

Urico’s price scale is: $18 for four ounces of
urine; 832 for eight ounces. and $12 for every
additional four ounces. Asked if he thought
what he is doing is in any way immoral. he said.
“Yeah, it’s kind of immoral. but the economy is
kind of depressed down here in Texas. and I
thought it would be an easy way to make some
money.”

He feels that Urico is in the forefront of a

growth industry. “There are an awful lot of
drug users in the United States." he said. “And
it's becoming pretty obvious that urine testing is
going to be increasing. So the drug users have
two choices: submit their own urine and lose
their jobs‘ or buy somebody else‘s urine and
keep theirjobs."

"Myself, I do not particularly care for people
who use drugs. And now I’m helping them. I
know it's ironic. but business is business."

Great American Peace March

City of Pittsburgh hosts last leg of hike.

n 1985, a California man asked his eight-
Iyear-old daughter, “What do you want to
be when you grow up?” “I won’t grow up,”
she responded. “The world will be blown
up by a nuclear bomb, Daddy."

That man and others like him decided then
that something needed to be done to help
secure the futures of their children and
grandchildren.

Out of the dreams and efforts of these people
came the Great American Peace March. Star-
ting in the warmth of the California springtime a
group of more than 1,000 marchers departed
from Los Angeles. Their goal was to make a
transnational hike to Washington, D.C. in order

to raise the American consciousness about the

possibility of total nuclear war.

But almost as soon as they started their
journey, the Marchers faced a cramped finan-
cial situation. In the middle of the Arizona
desert, March organizers were forced to declare
bankruptcy. Many Marchers became discontent
and disbanded.

Those who rallied
together in the name of their cause. The March

remained, however,
was reorganized with increased corporate spon-
sorship, and the Marchers set out again.

During the 3,000 mile journey the Marchers
encountered their share of problems. Rain.
Snow. Doubters. Harsh living conditions. But
their spirit kept them together. They worked as

a community, all pitching in to make their trip

as comfortable as possible

Pittsburgh played host to these peaceful
pedestrians in September on the last leg of their
trek. They made their way through downtown
and camped in Schenley Park, before moving
on to Washington. They brought with them the
spirit of hope and the love of life which had
followed them on their entire journey.

The Marchers arrived in Washington in
November. Met by cheering crowds, they had
accomplished their goal in many respects.
These people who had put their lives on hold
for a year to demonstrate their convictions had
reached their destination. And through their ef-
forts, we all gained a little insight as to just what
it means to be alive.

450 acres provides endless amusement.

n the 1800’s some Pittsburghers felt that it

was time for this city to have its own park.

They realized, not only, that the city’s
growth would eventually take over all the near-
by woodland, but they also wanted to compete
with other major cities that already had wonder-
ful city parks.

On February 13, 1869, a bill was proposed
that would permit the city to purchase the land
for park purposes. Unfortunately, it was
defeated by a 4500 majority. The city was not
able to make any progress on the matter until
the idea of Captain Edward Schenley’s Mt. Airy
tract was considered. In 1889 Edward M.
Bigelow was able to convince heiress, Mary E.
Schenley to contribute to the city of Pittsburgh
300 acres with the option to buy 100 more at
the price of $125,000.00, much less than its
valued price. The city immediately took advan-
tage of the offer.

From then until now, through various ac-
quisitions, Schenley Park has grown to encom-
pass some 450 acres. It is not only the largest
but it is considered by many to be the finest of
Pittsburgh’s Parks. Over the years there have
been many facilities and events that found a
home in the park. Some of these still survive to-
day while others have gone, making room for
new ones.

In the first decade many of the park’s great
assets were constructed. The first was a gift
from Andrew Carnegie of a library and music
hall. These made a wonderful gateway to the
park from Oakland. Phipps conservatory was
the next followed by a casino, a skating rink,
Frick Fine Arts building and Pittsburgh’s first
zoo. Development did not slow down until the
completion of the Matinee Race track, Schenley
Oval, where horse racing was a favorite, a band
shell, Panther Hollow lake, Forbes Field and a
Merry-Go-Round —-— all before 1914-. The
growth of Schenley Park helped to bring many
other major developments to the area as well as
helping to enrich Pittsburgh culturally.

Today, many of the original facilities still ex-
ist. Carnegie Library and Music Hall continue
to enrich the community along with the help of
the Carnegie Museum. Each year these facilities
maintain and upgrade their programs, exhibits,
and information for the benefit of all who use
them.

Other large crowd drawers are the Cinema in

84 Schenley Park

the Parks and the Concert in the Parks pro-
grams. These are both free events that take
place during the late spring and early summer
months. Seventeen films were fun this past
summer, and an estimated 32,000 covered
Flagstaff Hill with blankets and lawnchairs to
watch. The concerts are held every weekend
throughout this season on Flagstaff Hill, which
was in fact designed to act as an amphitheater
for events such as these.

Beginning this year some other renovations
include: repairing the trail
upgrading, construction on both the Anderson
and Panther Hollow bridges, and the nature

These facilities are used extensively and are

welcoming the new improvements. The tennis
courts are used by many hundreds of people
every summer. There are sixteen adult clinics
and camps, and private lessons are held in the
park. The Nature Center provides summer day
camps for the children of Pittsburgh. The
Ecology camp had 1,083 participants last year
while the Summer Fun camp had 510.

There are many things to do in Schenley
Park as a participant or a spectator. Schenley
Park has an 18 hole golf course that hosts
various tournaments each year attracting ap-
proximately 6,200 people in addition to the
Sunday golfers. Many locally sponsored 5-k
races are held in the park, because there is very
little traffic interference. The Great Ride of
Pittsburgh, a non-competitive event takes place
one Sunday in June. The 1,200 participants
can enjoy a day of fun and entertain-

ment while bike riding. There is of course the
Ashley Whippet Invitational if you and your
canine friend possess some talent. About 200
entrants each year show their stuff hoping to be
chosen to compete in the regional champion-
ships in Philadelphia.

For those people who need more speed than
they can get from biking or jogging there is the
Pittsburgh Vintage Grand Prix. This race pro-
vides plenty of excitement for drivers and spec-
tators alike. Nineteen eighty-seven will be the
ﬁfth consecutive year for the race featuring
more than one hundred pre-1959 sportscars.

A popular winter activity is ice skating.
Schenley Park has one of the two of
Pittsburgh’s city rinks that was acquired by a
federal grant to upgrade parks made possible
through Ladybird Johnson beautification
money. While the rink is in open air, the
building which houses equipment and
refreshments is underground. From the hill
above the rink, the building could only be
detected by a few air vents which protrude from
the grass. It was designed this way to keep
heating costs down and to keep the beauty of
the rink and its surroundings unspoiled by the
cinder block necessity.

These are just some of the many facilities
and events that are in the park. This year the
park will celebrate its one hundredth anniver-
sary. There are many gala events being planned
for the 1987 season.

Schenley Park offers the people of
Pittsburgh a much needed break from the
skyscraper monotony and everyday routines.
Here you can see a flower show, listen to jazz,
spend some quiet time enjoying scenery and
sculpture or as many nearby college students
do, find some privacy. Free concerts, bicycle
races, ice skating, golf, walking, reading,
watching children laugh and play, or even sled
riding on cafeteria trays are just some of the
many things that Schenley Park offers. No mat-
ter what you are looking for you are likely to
find it in the park, as they say, “It has
something for everyone.”

US reporter charged
with spying

Another chapter in the Cold War was
written in early September when the
Soviets arrested U.S. News & World
Report correspondent Nicholas Daniloff
and charged him with spying. The
Soviets said they caught Daniloff red-
handed trying to leave the country with
an envelope filled with top-secret
documents and photos of Soviet
Military installations. Daniloff said he
was set up by the Russians. He said he
accepted an envelope from an old friend
thinking it contained old newspaper
clippings. .

The incident triggered a series of ex-
pulsions and counterexpulsions that
finally ended with an angry President
Reagan releasing an accused Soviet spy,
Gennady Zakharov, but saying the
move was not related to the release of
Daniloff, who was released several days
later.

Khadaﬁz threatens
US with terrorism

Libyan leader Moammar Khadafy
also presented problems for the Presi-
dent in September and October.
Khadafy put a spectacular display of
rhetoric -— but little else -— calling
Reagan a “Mad Dog,” and threatening
repeatedly to step up terrorist attacks
against United States citizens.

Khadafy’s outbursts came just mon-
ths after the US bombed the Libyan
capital of Tripoli, doing extensive
damage to civilian property — but only
limited damage to military targets. The
bombing was in retaliation for what
Reagan called “irrefutable proof” that
Libya had sponsored the bombing of a
West German disco earlier in the year
that killed American serviceman Ken-
neth Terrance Ford.

Critics of the law said it would only
serve to stiﬂe the economy by placing

over-burdened middle class.

New US embassy
bugged by USSR

Also in the Cold War, the story broke
that our new embassy in Moscow had
been so badly bugged that it would have
to be torn down before the US could
even move into it. A Congressional in-
vestigation ensued and concluded the
stories were generally correct.

In retaliation, President Reagan an-
nounced that the Soviets would not be
allowed to move into their new complex
in Washington DC until our embassy

was de-bugged and safe to move into. As
expected, the Soviets denied hugging
the embassy, and expressed “outrage”
that they would have to wait to move in-
to their new complex, which is already
finished.

Nazi criminal
goes to trial

In Israel, the long-awaited trial of ac-
cused Nazi war criminal John Demjan-
juk ﬁnally got underway after months of
delays. Demjanjuk, a retired US
autoworker, was extradicted to Israel in
early 1986, after a long legal battle in
which Demjanjuk first denied he was
the former guard at the Treblinka death
camp, and then said Israel had no
authority to extradite him. Israel said
Demjanjuk killed, tortured, and
maimed thousands of Jews imprisoned
at the camp, and they branded him
“Ivan the Terrible.”

LaRouche followers
charged in scandal

October began with ten followers of
perennial Presidential candidate Lyn-
don LaRouche being indicted for fraud
and racketeering. Hundreds of govern-
ment agents surprised LaRouche’s
headquarters in Virginia, seized hun-
dreds of thousands of documents, and
arrested those charged in the
indictment.

The government charged that many
key LaRouche followers — his “inner
circle” —- had engaged in a massive
scheme to defraud people of millions of

dollars. According to the indictment,
those charged had solicited magazine
subscriptions from people and gotten
them to pay for their subscriptions with
credit cards. Then, the indictment said,
the followers used the credit card
numbers to make thousands of
unauthorized purchases.

The government did not indict
LaRouche, although it said it might in
the future. LaRouche denied all the
charges, said the prosecutors had a
vendetta against him, and left for a long
vacation in Europe, presumably so he
could not be subpoenaed to testify in
any of the trials.

Judge convicted
in tax fraud

In Washington, the first impeach-
ment trial in 50 years got under way,
with judge Harry Claiborne under the
gun. Claiborne, who had already been
convicted of tax fraud, had refused to
step down as judge, and thus was still
drawing a $78,000 a year salary.
Claiborne, who eventually was im-
peached, said his lawyer made a mistake
on his tax forms, and he should not be
punished for that error.

Father, son charged
in spy ring

November kicked off with convicted
spymaster John Walker and his son
both being sentenced to long prison
terms. Walker, Sr. received life sentenc-
ing, while his son got 25 years as part of
a plea bargain agreement. The govem-
ment said the pair ran a spy ring for 17
years and handed over numerous top-
secret Navy documents to the Soviets in
exchange for cash.

US secretly sells
weapons to I ran

Another controversy that dogged Presi-
dent Reagan in November was the
secret sale of weapons to Iran. Reagan
said the move was simply a gesture of
good will between the US and Iran
meant to stimulate the moderates in
that country. However, critics said the
move was tantamount to paying ransom
for hostages.

Several weeks after money and arms
were given to the Iranians, one

Blacks protest
in South Africa

In South Africa, the violence and
bloodshed continued, with reports of
more black protestors being killed or in-
jured coming in on nearly a daily basis.

Also prominently displayed in many
headlines were the bombings and at-
tacks on police by blacks angry with the
way the white-minority government of
President P.W. Botha was running
things.

President Reagan still denounced the
actions of Botha’s government, but did
little else. He repeatedly voiced his op-
position to divestment proposals, which
picked up steam on many college cam-
puses throughout the country, including
Pitt. Slowly, many large corporations,
like Eastman Kodak and IBM began
pulling their business ventures out of
the country.

Aquino wins test
Ofgovernmentis power

Democracy in the Philippines sur-

vived its first big test in late November
whek President Corazon Aquino foiled
a coup attempt. The attempt to over-
throw Aquino was headed by Defense
Minister Juan Ponce Enrile, and he was
booted out.

Enrile said he was unhappy with
Aquino because she was not taking a
tough stand against a communist in-
surgency in the Northern part of the
country. The incident stirred new
rumors that deposed dictator Ferdinand
Marcos might try to return and take
power, but that never happened. Mar-
cos and his wife now reside in Hawaii.

Maﬁa heads charged
in money-laundering

December kicked off with the mafia
in the spotlight, as the so-called “Pizza
Connection” drug trial got underway.
Shortly after the trial began, the body of
one of the missing defendents turned up
in a trash bag on a New York City
streetcomer. The government charged
that more than 20 men — many using
pizza parlors as fronts for money-
laundering — ran an international drug
ring that made millions in illegal proﬁts.

Kurt Waldheim
case extended

Attorney General Edwin Meese came
under ﬁre for delaying a ruling on
whether he would ban Austrian Presi-
dent Kurt Waldheim. Many Jewish
groups, including the World Jewish
Congress, said they had “incontrover-
table proof’ that Waldheim committed
atrocities as a Nazi officer during World
War II, and demanded he be placed on
the US “watchlist” -— banning him
from ever visiting this country. Meese
said because Waldheim was a head of
state, it was a delicate matter and would
require more time.

Also in December, another disturbing

that the company knew of the potential

a bitter court fight between India and

Another maﬁa trial made headlines
