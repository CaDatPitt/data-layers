CHARLES WELKER ALBRIGHT A T A
Massillon, Ohio
Massillon High School

"Ollie" wears a new medal after every ﬁeld meet
and the best part of it is that you have to ask him to
let you see it, for he is too modest to advertise hls
ﬂeet-footed ability.

JACOB M. HEPPS
Homestead, Pa.
Homestead High School

“_]ake" always answers "present" with a smile
when the Homestead cars are on time for the eight
o'clocks.

ED. L. MILLS, "Speed" A 2 <1’

Cadiz. Ohio

Case School

Track (2) (3)

“Speed" is a quiet sort of a fellow and does not
live up to his name. Would rather sit out dances
and talk to the girls than dance.

Bellevue, Pa.

Bellevue High School

Varsity Football Manager (3); Freshman Football

Manager (I); Apprentice Football Manager (2);

Owl Board; Senator (I) (Z) (3): Druids; Bug

Club (2)

Lee is the little‘ man with pep spelled with a cap-
ital "P." As a mining student he is a deep digger
and a great fusser. When you see Lee, you see the
long and short of everything, because where Lee is,
there is Tom.

THOMAS W. WARE A T A

Fort Scott, Kansas

University of Minnesota

Senate (3)

When it comes to plugging and methodical think-
ing mixed with conservative policies we refer you to
Tom. Tom is one of those Mining students, too,
but to save our lives we can't see how he is ever
going to get into one of our low down Pennsylvania
mines.

ARTHUR B. CAMPBELL, "Art" Kll’
Clarion, Pa.

Clarion High School
State College

We see before us one of the jolliest fellows of our
class who ﬁnds supreme pleasure in the gentle art of
rough-housing. When we see a bun or custard pie
ﬂying across the room, we know that "Art" is
present. He thinks Miller's voice sounds very much
like Prof. Salbach's. He also has the reputation for
inquisitiveness, especially during quiz class.

WILLIAM A. CARGO, "Bil " <13 A X
Swissvale, Pa.

Swissvale High School

Bill is not a Hercules in stature, but he is the pos-
sessor of a big heart. A gentleman of class and very
moderate in his habits. He sports the picture of a
fair one.

FRANK MILLER COAD
Blairsville, Pa.

Blairsville High School

He’s ever quiet as a mouse.
He seldom makes a sound:

lt's hard to ﬁnd him in the house
When the ladies are around.

VIc'ron CHARLES DETTIS,-"Vicki, (I) A X
Traftorcl, Pa.

Pittsburgh Academy

“Vic" is one of the smallest of the class. Never-
theless it does not affect his pharmaceutical knowl-
edge. He is a true ladies man.

VIRGINIA FRANK, "Virgie"
Turtle Creek. Pa.

Class Secretary (3)

"Virgie" has missed her calling, for her inclination
toward art and a light-haired man are quite in keep-
ing with her mild disposition. We wonder how she
finds time to study as well as to be continually writ-
ing to Beatrice Fairfax. If there is anyone in the
class who doesn't like Virginia, the fact has been
well concealed. I guess it is those blue eyes that
are responsible.

VERNER GROSE
McKeesport, Pa.

McKeesport High School

By the name you would think of quantity. Cross
is the man who thinks more Pharmacy can be
learned outside of a drug store than in one. His
main occupation out of school, basketball and
athletic clubs.

PHARMACY

EDNA M. JAcoBsoN "Ed"
Pittsburgh, Pa.

Pittsburgh High School

“A Smile." and proud she may be of it. "Ed" is
quite popular with the sterner sex and always ﬁnds
time to visit Saalbach's at noon.

GEORGE L. KIEFER “Nut"
Pittsburgh, Pa.

Riverside High School

While by no means reticent, "Nut" is not very
much of a talker. He is quite popular with the girls
of the class because he makes so much fun. As to
him being 2: "Nut," there is nothing really cracky
about him except his jokes, of which he is the sole
author.

WILLIAM A. Koossa "Bill" Pledge K ‘V '

Manor, Pa.

Manor High School

Make room for "Bill." boys. His smile is ever
present and he always has a big hello to greet you.
Optimistic? Well, I should say so. It is always a
pleasure to have him in the crowd.

RALPH E. MCCUNE Pledge  A X
Blairsville, Pa.

Ralph was caught smiling one day and has never
been the same since.

LESTER R. MARTIN “Les" <1) A X

Johnstown, Pa.

The boys have always wondered why he was sure
to check out early Tuesday. "My girl this, and my
girl that," possibly explains many mysteries.

ALEXANDER MEYERS Pledge <1) A X
Pittsburgh, Pa.

Woolslair High School

“Still water runs deep." ln fact, "Alex" is so
quiet that he doesn't run at all. He is one of those
fellows who are always hammering away.

 

PHARMACY

ROBERT C. MEYERS "Bob"
Greensburg, Pa.
Creensburg High School

"A merry heart maketh a cheerful countenance."

BENJAMIN MIDDLEMAN "Benny"

McKees Rocks, Pa.

We are glad to have "Benny" with us again. He
has a leaning toward humor that can't be misplaced,
but still he keeps plugging away.

S. EMMERT MILLER 61> A X

Conﬂuence, Pa.

Juniata Academy

Juniata College

Owl I919

“Good nature is always a success." Quite adept
at asking questions. “Questions, please?"

DONALD M. MITCHELL “Snapshot Bil "

New Castle, Pa.

New Castle High School

Donald is endowed with a charming personality.
Hearts melt before him like water in a blizzard. All
the women address him as "Dear Don."

ESTHER R. PARSONS

Pittsburgh, Pa.

South High School

Esther’s future evidence of prosperity will depend
more directly upon what she does in school than any
of the rest of us, and so we do not feel a bit surprised
that she studies hard. But if she applies herself as
diligently to the car that is in store for her, the con-
dition depending upon the outcome of her work here,
there may be no future in a drug store for her. The
only thing that worries her at all is "That Cough."

PAULINE M. POLINCHUK

Rankin, Pa.

Braddock High School

California State Normal

Pauline believes in the doctrine of work. She is
constantly to be seen with Miss Parsons. Ambition
and diligence seem to surround both of them; but
like the very best of us, Pauline must have her

"off days."

Brackenridge, Pa.

Tarentum High School.

“Silence is his motto and a valuable one at that."
A lady made the previous statement. Cirls, you
should learn to know him. He is a real ladies’ man.

HERMAN SMITH

Pittsburgh, Pa.

South High School

"Doc" thinks big, and his deed sure will grow.
When the battle is over and the smoke has cleared
this gentleman will have two degrees tucked under
his belt. Always overflowing with news from the
campus.

GOLDIE E. SNYDER

Pittsburgh, Pa.

Central High School

“Bright and Intelligent." Never idle a moment.
The only one of the ladies being fortunate enough to
pass the Q. A.

FRANK FLOYD STENCIL “Slenc" K ‘P’

Pittsburgh, Pa.

Pittsburgh High School

Better known as "My Stenc." "They all go wild
over me," but time will tell whether a private or a
captain ranks higher. Besides being a good fellow
and an ofﬁcial gum and cough drop vender, he is a
good plumber.

GUY H. TRIMBLE <13 A X

Greensburg, Pa.

Creensburg High School

“Valuable goods often come in small packages."
Guy is one of the fellows who uses the railroad to
attend Pharmacy. He comes all the way from
Creensburg and declares that he is awake when he

arrives at school, but we all have reasons to doubt
him.

PAUL A. VAN ALLMAN "Van" (I! A X

Hollidaysburg, Pa.

Hollidaysburg High School

President junior Class

He thoroughly believes in a day off. Never hesi-
tated in the least to declare a class cut when our
champions subdued a foe. Thanks to you, "Van."
However pleasure does not always stand in the way
of business, and "Van" is a strict adherer to duty.

"Helpful to every fellow student." She certainly
can recite her lessons well, and, more than that, does
her share of talking. But where is the girl that

COURTNAYE WHITE "Court"

Pitcairn, Pa.

Pitcairn High School

"A heart with room for every joy." Although
quite popular with the gentlemen, Court is quite

Quiet and gentle the entire day; nothing to fuss

Joi-iN RUSSEL FARREL, “Russ"
Pittsburgh, Pa.

Russel is a pacifist and also looks upon Ger-
many with an awe and reverence. Because
of current criticism against his two ideals he
left old Uni. However, with all these draw-
backs he has brains that are unequalled any-
where else in the world. He is a human
dynamo where intellectualism is at stake.
Lencippos is known to have delved into the
depths and soared in the heights of high-
browisms.

   

HERBERT FRANKENSTEIN

BERT!-{A RAUH, "Ber!"

Pittsburgh, Pa.

Peabody High School

"Bert" might have been all right but now
that she's gone and done it and announced her
engagement, she says "Go ahead and try it.
It doesn’t hurt." Has a real sense of humor.
Nothing appeals to her like a good joke.
Spends most of her time in Florida and when
she isn't in New York she can usually be
located in Frisco. Speaks French like a
Parisienne apache and knits like a dope ﬁend.

KATHERINE WEBB SPRING, "Katey,"
Pittsburgh, Pa.

A maiden most aloof. Rarely permits her-
self to be known. As far as we can penetrate
she is keenly intellectual, very vital and in—
teresting to know. ls specializing in biology
and stocks and bonds.

MAURICE L. ToLoci-uco

Here is a quiet earnest worker who never
boasts about himself. Always ready to dis-
cuss chemistry and its opportunities for
young men. He says he would rather be a
chemist than a Pitt engineer.

"Whose nature is so far from doing harm
that he suspects none."

After making his fortune in chemistry
Stilley will return to the farm. Like Wells, he
too, has an abundant knowledge of water
analysis and displays it boldly. Will no
doubt be very successful in his analysis of
soils on that farm.

of the fact."

“_Iasper" is a cousin of “Matador" Trigg,

and has done much work in the arena with

him. Hails from up the river, bluffed his way
through Aspinwall High and here he is. ln
spite of these short comings he has learned to
dance without losing his dignity, but only
after having removed the shine from many

Co-Eds’ shoes. One of the most faithful of

the class.

"Experience is by industry achieved, and
perfected by the swift course of time."

Fraternity Editor of l9l8 Owl '

The writer of Pitt Weekly editorials on such
interesting topics as “Why Pitt Students
Should Wear Cray Uniforms." Busy at
law school and often congratulated for his
“Weekly ’ efforts?

WALTER G. KIMMICH

Pittsburgh, Pa.

Allegheny High School

Comptroller Owl

Quietly goes to classes and is ready for the
worst C. P. A. exam after his experience with
the l9l8 Owl. In a Pitt uniform is one who
almost looks as if it ﬁts.

A. J. LAUGER

Grove City College

Lauger had some radical ideas in his sociol-
ogy class, but since entering law school the
common law and Blackstone have directed
his ideas in more conservative channels.

Had enough Pitt Spirit to come back from
the golden West to ﬁnish his last year. Says
he's going back and drive a steam plow and
follow the back to land movement, or else be-
come a naval hero for Uncle Sam

Although he liked the pleasures of life, the
call of his country was a greater one and he
made the sacriﬁce to have the extreme pleas-
ure of handling the shells that will drive Fritz
from his Vaterland.

E. P. MCCARTER, “Iris/1"

"Irish" has typical attitude on life of a son
of Erin, and besides, to become a member of
the Panther staff took a lot of good nature and
and determination.

J.  MCCARTHY A 2 <1)

Braddock, Pa.

St. Thomas Preparatory School

University of Pennsylvania

Perhaps his saintly teachings received in the
prep school were turned to humor at Penn; but
his associates at Pitt say it is the wit of one
who has kissed the Blarney.

“Chancellor" was with us almost to the
last; but the army call took him from us.
when he felt school could run along alright.
He will now administer the affairs of the
army and show the boys how to ship all the
American shells to Kaiser Bill in a hurry, de-
spite the blockade (shoot them, eh! Chan-
cellor?)

Smiles and good fellowship have placed him

Markowitz ﬁnished early so that he might
assist in the business of the coming wheat
market and make his little million before the
end of l9|8. Can tell you price of grain every
year since it was fifty cents a bushel.

*FRANI< B. MAXFIELD

“Max" had just started our humorous
monthly on its year’s prowl about the campus,
when he jumped to the better job of man-
aging some Ordnance Property for old U. S. A.
His success at Pitt spells success in the army.

*WILLIAM H. MILLER

Foxy made an enviable record on the grid-
iron as a speed demon and general. We are
sure his generalship in behalf of “Old Glory"
will uncover his usual speed and he will go
over the line with the boys when they score
the final victory against William Hohen-
zollern.

It is rumored that a small carriage is often
seen about the piazza of the Piazza home.
May the next generation have the Pitt spirit
of its forebearer.

_]. CYRUS RHODES, "Cy"

New Castle, Pa.

New Castle High School

Pitt Weekly (I) (2) (3); Assistant Editor

(4); Secretary Prodigals: Publicity Chair-

man Young Men’s Christian Association.

Although from a small town. a member of
"Prodigals" and a nickname "Cy," his ability
as a student and his application to butchering
the "cubs’ reporters" copy on the Weekly
showed that he was no candidate for Hick-
ville's postmaster, but he left school last sem-
ester for something big in a big city.

BENJAMIN ROSHENSHINE (PE II

Pittsburgh. Pa.

Fifth Avenue High School

Controller Weekly, Sigma Phi Kappa

“Ben" lost his best friend in the army last
summer and since then his dissipations caused
him to finish a half year early. His close
application to the problem at hand guaran-
tees for him a success after leaving us.. "Bon
Voyage."

JOHN ALFRED VIROSTEK

Braddock, Pa.

St. Thomas High School

University of Pennsylvania

Before coming here Virostek had "Old
Penn" for his ideal, but since coming to Pitt,
Dr. Thorpe's classes convinced him that
Pitt wasn't so bad after all. His attention to
study made the chancellor sign his sheepskin
in February.

NORMAN K. SCHALLER

Pittsburgh, Pa.

Fifth Avenue High School

Controller Pitt Weekly; Prodigals

Became a member of the Evening School
in order to hold down one of those much
bulletined accounting jobs. We are sure he
will do justice to any C. P. A. exam, judging
from his work for the "Weekly."

CLINTON LEE WEDDELL

Elizabeth, Pa.

Elizabeth High School

McKeesport High School

Prodigals

His civil war lineage as suggested by his
first two names, should surely make him feel
perfectly at home on seeing the "Pitt Grays"
drill on the campus daily. Perhaps "Lee"
has a few corrections to offer.

KIVIE WOLFE

Pittsburgh, Pa.

Central High School

Menorah Society; Wrestling

At the law school roll calls are not so ur-
gent and perhaps that's why Kivie has be-
come a law student. However he never
missed a breakfast call at a summer camp on
the Ohio last year.

Sincerety is his crowning grace, while atten-
tion to his studies has resulted in friendship
with few. Quiet and unassuming he is well
liked by those who know him well; by the
others respected for his application to his own
affairs.

JOSEPH BONIDY

New Kensington, Pa.

Clarion State Normal

Because Bonidy graduated from a normal
school, he claims you can't hold it against
him. He came to Pitt to get the ﬁnishing
touches before he decides to run for burgess
of his up-river town.

Crawford was always a sincere and inter-

"Red" took the trip to New York as a bank
representative and he tells many interesting
stories about it.

*CHARLES D. DELPHY, JR. ZAE

Pittsburgh, Pa.

‘Did you hear this one, boys?" and imme—
diately "-Red" would tell a story in a way that
was interesting to all. “Red" is no doubt
amusing the boys in camp with his witty
anecdotes and imitations of the great come-

dians.

*W. H. HECKERT

"Heckert" was the original smile man.
Nothing seemed to worry him and he always
made the best out of life as he found it. His

Versatility and an attractive personality
were “Vics" two recommendations. He
could play and draw equally well and either
performance always won him praise and ap-
plause. When "Vic" comes back, we hope
he will have some of those interesting car-
toons of his, about the war, with him.

Shirk had a series of motions when leading
an "Alle genee" which made every student
do his best. If he can only get the boys in
camp to yell together, as he did Pitt students,
the kaiser wouldn't be able to hear his can~
nons shoot and the war would be won.

made him the fear of every foe. His athletic
activity was not his only achievement, for it
was said that he was liked by the “Sweet

GEORGE E. SHARPE

Sharpe has always been busy knocking out

Graces!

Can be absolutely depended upon in all
emergencies, and is as faithful and true as
Penelope of old.

seen her hovering around classroom doors,
but few indeed have ever seen her ﬁrmly an-
chored in a class.

EMMA DEININGER

Parnassus, Pa.

Parnassus High School

Here is a case too obvious to be disputed:
In ancient days the Muses dwelt on Mt.
Parnassus; moreover, there was among their
number one who favored Mathematics; what
more natural that she, returning to earth,
took up her abode in Parnassus, Pa., and
came to Pitt to major in Math. And today
we call her Miss Deininger.

FLORA GRACE DETWILER

CECILIA HARTZ

Altoona, Pa.

Leads all the co—ed parades, lines us up for
the Honor System. and is always on hand

Bentleyville, Pa.

Bentleyville High School

EXTENSION DEPARTMENT

iﬁiztnrg

The University of Pittsburgh organized its extension division during the fall
of I913. The growth of the division has been steady, the demand for all kinds
of extension service has greatly increased.

iﬂurpnse

The extension division aims to carry to the people of Pennsylvania as many
as possible of the opportunities offered by the University of Pittsburgh.

(Erganizatinn

I. EXTRA MURAL INSTRUCTION DEPARTMENT.

The work of this department is to give instruction carrying University
credit to those who cannot attend the University for such instruction. This
work is conducted by the class room method where there is sufficient demand.

Correspondence instruction giving University credit is given in many sub-
jects. The scope of this correspondence work is extending steadily.

II. PUBLIC SERVICE DEPARTMENT.

This department conducts a variety of public service work.

Lectures for almost any sort of occasion or subject can be furnished. The
community service rendered in this manner is of exceedingly great value.

Through the Package Library Bureau briefs and bibliographies on debate
questions, current literature on topics of the day, and package libraries on various
important subjects are furnished without charge for specified periods of time.
Lists of judges for debates and literary contests are furnished upon request.

The Visual Bureau is a centralized agency for motion picture ﬁlms and lan-
tern slides on educational subjects. This service is at all times given free on
condition that certain necessary requirements, as the use of films, and slides, etc.,

MELLON INSTITUTE

!1HPllntt Zlnatitutr nf Elnhuatrial Reaearrh

Twelve years ago, the late Robert Kennedy Duncan, while attending the
Sixth International Congress of Applied Chemistry in Rome, conceived the idea
of a practical method of bringing the science of the University—~the new knowl-
ecIge—to the service of industry. The idea called for the establishment, in the
University, of Industrial Fellowships by individuals, companies or associations
for the investigation of specific manufacturing problems involving the physical
sciences.

The first Industrial Fellowship was founded in I907 at the University of
Kansas, where Dr. Duncan was then Professor of Industrial Chemistry, by a
company interested in the chemistry of laundering. In I9I0, Dr. Duncan was
called to the University of Pittsburgh to inaugurate the Industrial Fellowship
System in the Department of Industrial Research, now known as the Mellon
Institute of Industrial Research.

The first Industrial Fellowship at the University of Pittsburgh was founded
in March, I9I I, through a grant from a baking company which desired to improve
its product. In the seven years which have elapsed, seventy-ﬁve distinct con-
cerns have endowed some one hundred eighty-nine one—year Industrial Fellow-
ships for the study of speciﬁc manufacturing problems.

During the past year, the Mellon Institute, in common with all of the other
research institutions of the country, has suffered a marked depletion in its staff.
Twenty-one members of the Institute, including the Director, Dr. Raymond F.
Bacon, who was commissioned as Lieutenant-Colonel and is now in command
of the Chemical Service Section of the National Army in France, and an Assistant
Director, Mr. William A. I-Iamor, who was commissioned as Major and is aide
to Lieutenant-Colonel Bacon, have entered Government service in response to
their country's call. The following is a list of the Industrial Fellows who have
gone direct from the Institute into service:

MELLON INSTITUTE

In a number of instances, Industrial Fellows at the Institute, through the
patriotism of the donors of their Fellowships, have been giving part or, in some
cases, all of their time to work on war problems which have been assigned to the
Institute by the National Research Council. The results obtained on some of
the Industrial Fellowships have had opportune application to some pressing war
problems. On these Fellowships, no money is being spared by the donors of the
Institute to make the results of service to the Government.

The institute, in most cases, has been able to fill the vacancies on the Indus-
trial Fellowships which were caused by the Fellows’ entering military service.
However, the shortage of research men, of the type demanded by the Industrial
Fellowship System, has forced the Institute to hold in abeyance a number of very
desirable research problems. It is gratifying to report that, notwithstanding
the unsettled condition of the business world, an increasing number of indus—
trialists are assigning problems on their processes and products to the Institute.

From March, 1917, to March, 1918, forty—two Industrial Fellowships were
founded in the Institute. For the maintenance of these Fellowships, industrial
concerns have contributed about $172,000. The building and permanent equip-
ment of the Institute, which make it the most complete and modern industrial
experiment station in the country, and the yearly allowance for overhead
expenses, are the gifts of Andrew William Mellon and Richard Beatty Mellon,
citizens of Pittsburgh.

It required the cataclysm of the Great War to bring men to realize fully the
part which applied science is playing and, more particularly, will play in the life
of nations. As men have come to know that everything in modern warfare is
controlled in a large measure by science—no gun of large caliber is located or
ﬁred without its aid—so they have come to know that in the making of things—
in the economy and progress of manufacturing operations-—science must have a
place, an important place, too. With this idea in mind, institutions of learning
and industries in this country, but more especially abroad, are investigating and
studying methods to bring about co-operation between science and industry.
The Mellon Institute is proud that, while very young, it has been a pioneer in the
field. Its principal claim to distinction, apart from its contributions to speciﬁc
industries. is based on the service it has been able to render to other institutions
in demonstrating the practicability of a system which brings together science
and industry for the development of a future and more gracious civilization.

MEMBERSHIP INCREASE CHART I916-I917

 

 

ALUMNI

HE diagram on the opposite page speaks more eloquently than words
in describing the growth in membership of the University's General
Alumni Association. From 300 to 2,600 in two years is the record
that all Pitt men should be proud of. All members get the “Pitt
Weekly", the official student and alumni publication. and are

thereby kept in very close touch with the activities at Alma Mater. Annual dues

are $2.00. and entitle the member to a subscription to the "Weekly.” Member-
ship in the Association is of three classes: Regular, Associate and Honorary.

No dues are paid by honorary members. Life membership dues are $50.00 for

Regular and Associate Members.

 

Members are also given preference in the distribution of football tickets for
the more important games. This system was started two years ago when the
demand for best reservations became larger than the supply. lt brought in many
new members of the Association and once they got in and started getting the
“Weekly” a corresponding increase in interest in all University affairs was
noticeable.

The alumni activities are handled chiefly by the Alumni Council, which is
the executive body of the General Alumni Association. lt is composed of fifty
members, two from the ten different schools of the University and thirty elected
at large. Regular meetings are held on the third Monday of March, May,
October and December. The annual meeting of the General Alumni Association
is held in June. Following a custom inaugurated in l9l6, the Council meetings
are held at the Pittsburgh Athletic Association, dinner being served before the
business sessions. The attendance at these meetings has been very good.

The "Pitt Weekly” has filled a more important part than ever during war
times. It is estimated that between l,000 and L200 former students of the
University are in the service and the “Weekly” is sent to all of them. A page is
devoted each week to alumni news. Letters from the men in the service have
also been featured. In many of the Government camps Pitt clubs have been
formed, the aim being to draw the alumni closer together and also k.eep them
close to the University.

The Alumni Directory, which was published in l9I6, has been of great
assistance i.n handling the alumni activities. This book will be revised and
reprinted this summer. lt contains an alphabetical list of former students, also
a list by towns and one by classes. One thousand copies of the l9l6 edition
were printed and are now in circulation.

 

Two hundred twenty-one

 

ALUMNI

Nine former Pitt Clubs are in existence, one being formed in New York City
since the last edition of the “Owl." This club has monthly luncheons at Haan’s
Red Room, with good attendance. Owing to the unsettled conditions and the
fact that a large number of the alumni have entered the service, the other club
meetings were dispensed with during the winter.

The I917 Commencement season was hardly as active as in past years,
although the annual alumni banquet held at the Hotel Schenley, Wednesday,
June I3, was attended by a record crowd. Charles W. Scovel, '83, was the toast-
master, and the speakers included the Hon. James Montgomery Beck, of New
York, former U. S. Assistant District Attorney Thomas Bakewell Kerr. '67, of

New York, Chancellor McCormick, William Churchhill Arther, of the graduating
class, and others.

During the month of December a campaign for endowment for the University
was conducted among the alumni and students, the plan being to have alumni
take out insurance and make the University the beneﬁciary. lt met with con-
siderable success, with prospects of even greater results in the future.

The alumni continued to assist in supervising the various University activ-
ities. Alfred Reed Hamilton, ’94, is the alumni representative on the Board of
Trustees. The alumni have equal representation with the students and faculty
on Athletic Council and assist in handling the athletic activities of the University,
which have grown to very large proportions. There are also alumni representa-
tives on the Student Activities Board, which assists in the handling of all non-
athletic activities, and on the Student Publications Board.

The alumni headquarters are at 503-505 Commonwealth Building and are
splendidly equipped. They comprise a suite of six rooms where the alumni and
athletic affairs are handled. Alumni are always welcome and the daily list of
visitors is large. Complete alumni and University records are kept and are at
the disposal of Pittites at any time. It is aimed to make the alumni headquarters
a gathering place for all of Pitt's friends.

One of the oldest graduates of the University was called by the Grim Reaper
December 22, I9] 7, he being George I. Whitney, of the class of I864. Mr. Whit-
ney was the first President of the General Alumni Association and was a well
known banker, broker and coal operator. At the time of his death he was the
second oldest living graduate of the University, the oldest being the Rev. Dr.
Samuel Carr George, of the class of I858.

CLUBS

iﬂitkin (111111:

The Pitkin Club of the University of Pittsburgh was organized early in the
year 1914 by a small but enthusiastic group of students who had attended the
national Student Volunteer Convention at Kansas City, and it was given the
name of the American missionary hero, Horace Tracy Pitkin.

Since that time the club has been meeting weekly in the chapel of the Shady-
side Presbyterian Church, the ladies of the Benevolent Workers serving lunch.
The membership of the club has steadily increased until in I916-l9l7 it num-
bered about seventy. This year, in spite of the fact that most of the men are
in the service, the roll includes about fifty. Among the members in the service
are George M. Kirk, who is doing Y. M. C. A. field work in Italy, and Dr. Kerr,
who is traveling throughout the Allied countries as a member of the Y. M. C. A.
Commission.

The purpose of the club is to study the various mission ﬁelds and their needs
and to promote the cause of missions in the university. This purpose has been
well carried out under the able and inspiring leadership of Dr. Hugh Thompson
Kerr. Another source of great interest and inspiration to the members of the
club have been the frequent visits of returned missionaries with their appealing
messages direct from the field of service.

Pitkin Club is open to every student of Pitt, the only qualiﬁcations being an
interest in foreign missions.

The officers of the club are:

H. MILLER SPRANKLE, '18 _ _ _ President
CLIFFORD E. BARBOUR, '19 _ _ , V ice-President
GWENDOLYN RICHARDS, 'l8 _ _ , Secretary
HARRIET SMITH 'l9 _ , ,. , Treasurer

The University Y. M. C. A. is an organization for pushing forward Christian
movements within the school. During the past year the organization has suf-
fered considerably due to a great number of the active men having entered mili-
tary service. Mr. George M. Kirk, the former General Secretary, is now serving
in the War Work Department of the Y. M. C. A. at Bologna, Italy. However,
the Association has had a successful year, the outstanding feature of which was
the student Friendship War Fund, the subscriptions of which amounted to about
$12,500, in which every school of the University took part.

The officers of the Association are:

In I909 a department of play was established in the School of Education
of the University under the direction of Mr. George E. Johnson, Superintendent
of Playgrounds in the City of Pittsburgh. The purpose of the department was
the training of workers in the playgrounds of Pittsburgh especially. The courses
proved to be so popular that the scope of the work was broadened greatly after
the first year.

In I9I5 the department of play was changed to the department of physical
education and the course as a whole was changed accordingly to meet the new
purpose. The department now prepares men and women for expert service in
conducting physical education in playgrounds, public schools, normal schools,
colleges, the Y. M. C. A., the Y. W. C. A., settlements and other organizations
which may make physical education a feature of their work.

The department occupies its own gymnasium, which is new, attractive and
well equipped. The membership of the department is now over fifty. Of this
number nine are in the service, as represented by our service flag which hangs in
the gymnasium. This year seven of the physical education girls have earned
their letters on the Varsity basketball team.

The P. E. P. club was organized in I9I6. Students are elected to mem-
bership in it when they have been in the department at least two semesters,
maintained a high standard of scholarship, physical skill and professional ability.

The officers of the club are:

The Prodigal Club is a group of out—of-town students who meet bi—weekly
at the Oakland M. E. Church for supper served by the ladies of the church. This
group was organized three years ago by the Y. M. C. A. for the purpose of de-
veloping a closer bond among out-of—town students. At each meeting they have
held, a student actively engaged in University activities, a prominent alumnus
or some other local man of eminence to address them on some topic of current
interest. Membership in this organization is open to any out-of—town student.

The purpose of the Classical Club is threefold:

I. To deal, by means of papers, lectures and discussions, with the life,
public and private, of the Greeks and Romans, their religion and history, with
Greek and Roman antiquities and similar subjects.

2. To study and produce, from time to time, such plays or scenes from
classical times as may seem feasible.

3. To hold such social meetings as may not be out of harmony with the
foregoing purposes.

ATHLETICS

iﬂiifa mar Efimv Atlilvtira

HEN war was declared April 6, I917, there was much speculation as
to the future of intercollegiate athletics. Some of the large Eastern
institutions immediately called off their intercollegiate athletic com-
petition. All this seemed to have been done Without giving the
question the serious thought that it was entitled to. To the credit
of theUniversity authorities it can be said that they proceeded slowly. A meet-
ing of Athletic Council was held March 3,] , when the declaration of war seemed
imminent, and the sense of the meeting was that no definite action should be
taken until the war policy of the United States was announced.

V 
~ 

ll
(9

When the war declarations came and the conditions gradually righted them-
selves, it was seen by all that the stand taken by the University was the proper
one. Many of the institutions that had summarily called off athletics admitted
they had erred. President Wilson, Secretary of War Baker and other Govern-
ment officials in public statements expressed themselves favorably toward their
continuance. And as the months have gone by and athletics have played such
a prominent part in the training work of the nation it is hard to realize that a
movement for their abolishment should ever have been considered.

The University went ahead with its baseball, track and tennis schedules last
spring, being careful that they did not interfere with the student military train-
ing. The baseball season was the most successful in the history of the national
sport at the University. Walter A. Blair, former American League player, was
secured as coach and with Norman MacLeod as the Student Manager, Pitt was
"put on the map" in this sport. The season ended in a rather unfortunate way
when Capt. "Eddie" Langdon and “Lou" Kennedy, the two star pitchers, were
disqualified for playing on outside teams. This brought about a humiliating
defeat at the hands of Lehigh University on Commencement day. The stand of
the athletic authorities was right, however, and was backed up by the entire
student body. This defeat, while unfortunate, did not offset the great record
made by the Varsity.

The track season felt the effects of the war when Syracuse, Annapolis Naval
Academy and West Virginia cancelled dual meets. The University's annual
intercollegiate and interscholastic meet was a great success, however, and a dual
meet was won from Carnegie Tech. Penn State captured a close meet at State
College. For the second successive year the Panther relay team took first in the
University of Pennsylvania game, at Franklin Field, Philadelphia. At a meeting
of the Intercollegiate Association of Amateur Athletics of America, held in
New York early in March, membership was granted to the University. This will
enable us to send a team to the National I ntercollegiate Track Meet.

ATHLETICS

During the summer, things became more settled as regards athletics and
when time for the opening of college last Fall rolled around all the leading insti-
tutions declared for continuance of football, with the exception of Yale, Harvard
and Princeton. These schools had what they termed "informal teams." it is
gratifying to note that they are now reported back in line and will probably have
teams next Fall. The varsity squad went to training camp, as usual, and despite
the loss of many stars by enlistments, graduation, etc., buckled down to its task
in true Pitt style.

The season was an unqualiﬁed success. not a game was lost, and critics
awarded the Eastern college championship to the team led by "Red" Carlson.
It was possibly not made up of as many star individual players as in previous
years, but it had the "punch" and the "fight." These two characteristics
brought the Blue and Gold through victorious on several occasions when things
looked shaky. Capt. Carlson proved to be an excellent leader and had the men
with him all the time.

Credit is due to the team members for the way they co-operated with the
management in keeping down expenses. No training house was provided for the
team and the boys lived in their homes; yet they were always in good physical
condition. While the attendance at games was not quite so large as other years,
the support was, as a rule, all that could be desired. The crowd at the W. & _I.
game even exceeded that of I916. The student support was splendid, with the
newly uniformed Pitt band always in evidence.

Basketball was very hard hit by the war, but a creditable record was made.
George McLaren was the only regular left from I917. Hastings, Del-lart and
Lubic were in the service and McNulty, captain-elect. decided to give up the
game. "Katy" Easterday, who was a substitute guard the previous year, was
made captain. The hard games were all bunched toward the end of the season
and after a run of ﬁve straight victories, including one over Yale, it was hard
sledding. The series with W. & J. and Tech were tied, although Penn State won
both games.

Minor sports received their share of attention. No wrestling team was
supported, but tennis and swimming candidates were active. The swimmers
engaged in many local A. A. U. open meets.

It was the second year with the one-year residence rule in effect and results
vindicated the judgment of the athletic authorities in adopting that important
piece of legislation. The University teams were given more credit for their
achievement than they had ever received before. Freshmen athletics received
their share of attention. The football team under Coach Kerr made a great
record, as did the basketball team under Coach Ochsenhirt. The baseball team,
coached by “Chalky" Williamson, did well, and the track men, while having little
competition, showed promise.

The girls’ basketball team continued the good work which was in evidence
in former years. Prof. H. H. Provin coached the team.

HE Varsity "P" is awarded to men who have played in a certain
number of athletic contests, including in many sports, the W. & 
and Penn State games. The successful candidates in track must
secure not less than ten points in one season of intercollegiate com-
petition, or a total of 20 points during his college career.

Two men won the Varsity "P" in three branches of sport——R. A. Easterday
and D. H. Sies. Several others won letters in two branches.

Eh» 1917 '4JElt1n>n

AR time football at the University of Pittsburgh last Fall presented
many difficult problems~—financial and otherwise-—but the Panther
eleven came through with flying colors. For the third successive
year not a single game was lost and the record made since “Pop"
Warner took the coaching reins remains untarnished. This is all

the more remarkable when the past season is analyzed. The war took such stars

as,"Andy" Hastings, "Jimmy" DeHart and "Jim" Morrow from the varsity,
and Leon Kelley, Orsen Wilcox and others from the I916 Freshman outﬁt.

"Bob" Peck, the incomparable All-American center, was through, and other stars

who had helped to make the Warner machine invincible in 1916 were among the

missing.

Prospects looked anything but rosy when the team departed for "Camp
Hamilton," Windber, the early part of September. In addition there was an
uncertainty as to just how the game would be effected by the war. Several of
the candidates who went to camp had enlisted and were expecting a call
any time; others had low numbers in the draft and were‘ subject to call. No
ruling had been made as to whether students in the professional schools would be

drafted.

The athletic authorities simply had to take a chance and meet the conditions
as they arose. Before camp broke, several of the candidates who had enlisted
were called. Notable among these were "Gus" Aschman, who was leading the
quarterback candidates. Had he remained he would have undoubtedly gotten
in many of the important games at this position. Hilty, the big tackle, expected
to be called at the same time, but action was deferred in his case until just a few
days before the Pennsylvania game. He donned a sailor suit at Cape May at
that time and Warner had to use a substitute at his position.

One thing these conditions did bring about was that every man who had any
football ability at all had an opportunity to prove his mettle. Players like Roy
Easterday, "Bill" McClelland, "Bill" Harrington and others, who had been
"scrubs" for several years, blossomed forth into stars. Their chance came and
they grasped it. Easterday was one of the sensations of the year and starred in
the backﬁeld in all the big games. McClelland got a trial at quarterback and
he and “Foxy" Miller held down the position capably in all the important battles.
"Jake" Stahl ﬁlled in "Bob" Peck's shoes in splendid style.

ATHLETICS

Sies and Sutherland were the same old steady guards. Seidel was back at
one tackle and the other was ﬁlled by Vance Allshouse, and "Red" Pearlman of
the previous year's Freshman outﬁt. Capt. Carlson was at one end and "Bill"
Harrington, Fred Henry and Ray Allshouse worked at the other. The backﬁeld
was well taken care of by Miller, McClelland, Gougler, McCarter, Easterday and
McLaren and others. McLaren had his greatest year and proved to be one of
the brightest stars of the season. Praise was heaped on him by all the well
known football critics. In the Pennsylvania game his work was awe-inspiring.

The schedule was a stiff one but was arranged so that there were the proper
breathing places. The opener with West Virginia at Morgantown was a hard
game. After which the Bethany game gave the coaches a chance to correct many
errors. Then Lehigh came to Forbes ﬁeld and was given a sound thrashing.
Syracuse got the same dose. The Penn game was somewhat of a disappointment
to the big crowd of Pittites who traveled to Philadelphia. It was won never-
theless——the third straight victory over the Quakers. An easy game was played
with Westminster before the W. 8: J. game.

The W. 8: J. battle was one of the "greatest ever." It is doubtful if a more
thrilling athletic engagement will ever take place in Pittsburgh. The Tech game
following this was easier than anticipated. Penn State gave the Varsity a little
trouble on Thanksgiving, but when they solved their trick plays it was “all off."
The benefit game with the Camp Lee soldiers’ team was easy for the “scrubs."

A number of standbys played their last game. Capt. "Red" Carlson,
"Jock" Sutherland, Fred Seidel, "Foxy" Miller, Fred Henry and "Bill" McClel-

land can be numbered among these.

All did valiant work for the Blue and Cold. George W. McLaren has been
honored with the |9l8 captaincy.

PITT l4—WEST VIRGINIA 9

West Virginia proved a hard test for the Panthers in the opening game at
Morgantown, September 29. Captain Carlson's team made a runaway of it in
the first half, which ended I4-0. Gougler and McLaren advanced the ball for
the first touchdown at the start of the second quarter. Another score followed
when Stahl grabbed a fumble on the 30-yard line, and Cougler, Easterday and
McLaren made the rest of the distance. An error of judgment on the part of
one of the Pitt backs gave West Virginia a safety just shortly after the kick-off
in the second half and they later scored a touchdown when one of Sies' punts was
blocked near the goal line. West Virginia’s record for the entire season was
impressive, they defeating W. & J. in their annual game.

PITT 40—BETHANY 0

The opening game of the season was with Bethany College and resulted
in an easy 40-0 victory for the Panthers. Had Coach Warner desired to run up
a big score the chances are that he could have done so. As it was, he was con-
tent to try out all the men and see what could be expected of them in the big
games later. Pitt scored 20 points in the first quarter, when the double pass
was worked to perfection. Bethany fought gamely in the second and third
quarters and there was no scoring, the Pitt subs being in the most of the time.
In the last quarter the Panthers woke up and scored 20 more points, Capt Carlson
handling a forward pass for the last one. While the Varsity's playing in this
game was far from ﬁnished, it was encouraging to the football fans and all pre-
dicted another great season.

PITT 4l——LEHIGH 0

Lehigh University was expected to give the Panthers a hard game and the
coaches were considerably worried over the outcome. The Varsity sprung an
attack, however, that not only bewildered Lehigh but that set the big crowd
wild with enthusiasm. "Foxy" Miller started the proceedings by grabbing the
kick-off on the IO-yard line and, behind splendid interference, running 96 yards
to the goal line. This seemed to put the visitors up in the air and they never
recovered. Two touchdowns were scored in the first and fourth quarters and one
each in the other quarters. The backﬁeld combination of Miller, Gougler,
Easterday and McLaren performed brilliantly. It was a great exhibition of
football and Lehigh was completely crushed.

PITT 28—SYRACUSE 0

The Varsity duplicated its great l9I6 victory over the formidable Syracuse
University team at Forbes Field October 20 and rolled up a 28-0 score. Syra-
cuse had a fast, powerful eleven and it was some feat to wallop them by such a
score. The Pitt defeat proved to be the only setback they encountered all year,
they later defeatiug Brown, Colgate and other top-notch teams. Pitt scored a
touchdown in every quarter. Syracuse got off to a flying start and almost scored
before Pitt woke up. Then McLaren and the other backs got busy and under
the wise direction of "Bill" McClelland, who was at quarterback, the first touch-
down resulted. McLaren's run of 92 yards on a "line plunge" scored the second
touchdown. “Big Mac" also bucked the line for the third score. Miksch
grabbed a fumble and went over for the final one. The big feature was the
playing of McLaren and he was hailed as a sure All-American back.

PITT I4—PENN 6

The annual game with the University of Pennsylvania was played at Franklin
Field and proved to be one of the real surprises of the season. Pitt won I4-6
after one of the most gruelling battles in football history. Entering the game
with apparently no chance to stop the fast going Panthers, Penn showed its tra-
ditional ﬁght and Capt. Carlson's team had a hard time winning. McLaren's
terriﬁc line plunging enabled Pitt to get within scoring distance just after the
second half started and a forward pass, McCarter to Carlson, brought the first
tally. Shortly after that Harrington grabbed a blocked kick on the I-yard line
and McLaren took it over. Penn’s score came late in the game and was due to
poor judgement on Pitt’s part. A forward pass was tried far down in Pitt ter-
ritory and Penn got the ball and ran to it to the 7 yard line. Several plunges
took it over. One of the largest crowds that ever ﬁled in Franklin ﬁeld was
present. The game was hard but cleanly fought and Pitt's team was praised by
critics and opponents for sportsmanlike conduct. All this helped cement ath-
Ietic relations between the two big Keystone State universities.

PITT 25—WESTMINSTER 0

Westminster College occupied the "ﬁll in" date between the Penn and W. &
J. games, November 3, and Coach Warner used a substitute line-up the most
of the time against them. The score was 25-0, the New Wilmington team giving
a plucky exhibition in the second half and holding the Panthers scoreless. Carl-
son and McLaren were the only regulars who were in for any length of time, and
Warner cautioned both of them to take no chances. Straight football was
played, as the entire W. 81  squad was up from "Little" Washington to see in
action the team that they were to face the following Saturday.

PITT l3———W. & _I. I0

The annual game with W. 6:  was one of the most thrilling in Pitt football
history. It was attended by a crowd that almost equalled the record I9I5
attendance. Walter Camp, the Yale expert, was there. The game was cleanly
fought throughout and brought credit to both institutions. W. 8:  got the
jump at the start when a fumble gave them the ball near the Pitt goal line and
McCreight kicked a ﬁeld goal. Before the quarter ended, the ball was rushed
into W. 8: ]. territory and "Foxy" Miller got away for a 20-yard run and a touch-
down. In the second quarter a long run by Easterday put Pitt within scoring
distance and McLaren finally went over. The score was I3-3 at the end of the
first half. The second half was decidedly W. &  for a while. McCreight ran
back a punt for 35 yards and short passes and runs gave them a touchdown.
Pitt braced in the fourth quarter and should have scored another touchdown
but for a little bad judgment in selecting plays. The ball was lost to W. & 
on the I-yard line.

PITT 27-—CARNEGIE TECH 0

The Carnegie Tech game was comparatively easy for Pitt, the score being
28-0. A touchdown was scored in each quarter. The first came through line
smashes by McLaren and Gougler. McCarter then carried the ball over. The
double pass was worked to perfection in the second quarter and Gougler scored.
Tech did best in the third quarter, but a score was negotiated by Pitt through
consistent gains by the Pitt backs. Easterday's long run in the fourth quarter
helped toward the final score, George McLaren mixing in with his battering
ram line plunges. Capt. Carlson was suffering from a bad leg and only got in
the game for a minute. The Varsity performed splendidly at all stages and
showed a scoring power that completely bafﬂed the Plaid.

PITT 28—PENN STATE 6

For the fifth successive time the Varsity vanquished Penn State in the Annual
Thanksgiving Day contest at Forbes Field. The score of 28-6 about shows the
strength of the two teams. State was dangerous in the latter part of the second
half when a freak triple pass-forward pass play was used. Pitt was not pre-
pared to defend this and it had the boys up in the air for a while. Capt. Carlson's
team started off with a rush in the first quarter and soon had two touchdowns
to its credit. Then State scored a touchdown on the aforementioned play,
making the tally I4-6. Here the half ended. The third quarter saw State
using the same tactics, but Pitt gradually spoiling the effectiveness of the open
play. In the final quarter Pitt got started again and tallied two more touch-
downs, completely smothering the State offense and defense. Statistics show
that Pitt gained 495 yards to States I56 and that 20 first downs were made to
9 for State. In the second half Pitt gained 200 yards to 34 for State. Easterday
was the star ground gainer. State watched McLaren like a hawk and usually
had two or three men on top of him. This gave Easterday a chance to run
wild, which he did to a queen's taste.

PITT 30—CAMP LEE 0

A beneﬁt game was played the Saturday after Thanksgiving Day with a
picked team from Camp Lee, Petersburg, Va. It was won easily by the Panther
team, 30-0, substitutes being used as a rule. The entire receipts of $4,341.00
were turned over to the soldier boys for their camp athletic fund. On the Camp
Lee team were some former well known college football players, such as McKean
of W. &  Marshall of Tech, etc. They were no match for the Pitt boys, who
scored almost at will. Penman, Pitler, Peters and others got their chance and
made good at carrying the ball. There was no raggedness in the Panthers’ per-
formance and the players showed that they are worthy of bigger game next Fall.

ATHLETICS

Eaakethall, 1913

.; ERHAPS no other branch of sport was so hard hit by war conditions
 as the Varsity basketball team. When the l9|7 season ended the
material looked exceptionally promising and it was predicted that the
following year would be one of the best on record. Then Hastings,
‘ -" Del-lart, Lubic and Hammer donned Uncle Sam's uniform, and
McNulty, who had been chosen captain, decided to give up the game. McCul-
lough and Carlson did not come out. This left only Easterday and McLaren
available. The former was chosen captain to succeed McNulty.

 

The Freshman team furnished Levine and Penman for forwards, and Pearl~
man, Robinson, Nicolas, Lutes and Hutchinson reported; also McCarter, who
had starred in football, and Lindberg, an experienced performer. The season
started off with a rush, when Yale was defeated 39-33, and four more victories
followed. Just before the first Carnegie Tech game, Pearlman was disqualified
for playing on an outside team without permission and McCarter and Lindberg
dropped off the squad. This left Coach Flint short of material and he had to
do considerable experimenting. Robinson ﬁnally made the regular center posi-
tlon.

The hard games all came in a bunch toward the end of the season, which
wound up with eight straight defeats——something unusual for a Pitt team. Of
the I5 games played only 6 were won. The majority of the games lost were by
a few points, however, and, considering all the circumstances, no special regrets
are felt over the season. Prospects for next year seem much brighter. All of
this year’s team are eligible and the Freshman team will provide some good
performers.

ﬂaaehall, 191?

HEN Walter A. Blair, former American League catcher, was appointed
‘ coach of the Varsity baseball team, and Norman MacLeod was
given the managerial reins, it was the first step to give Pitt a real
baseball team. For several years it had appeared to the athletic
~ supporters that the material was at hand and that there was no
reason why we should not have a baseball winner. Blair and MacLeod set to
work with a will and they certainly accomplished what they set out to do.

The I917 Varsity was the best that ever represented the University, the
games were better attended than ever before, and altogether the season was a
grand success. True, there was a very unfortunate ending, but neither the
Coach or management could be blamed for this. Captain “Eddie" Langdon
and "Lou" Kennedy, mainstays in the pitching box, were both declared ineligible
before the three ﬁnal games——two with Penn State and one with Lehigh. This
leftbut one twirler, "Tack" Hammer, and he twirled both the State games,
winning the second one. Lehigh was the commencement day attraction and it
was a farce. Hammer could not go in and everyone tried his hand in the box.

It was a rather humiliating ﬁnish to a great season, but indicated to the public
that eligibility rules at Pitt had to be lived up to.

The team played with great snap all year. Friedlander and Sapper did well
behind the bat and with Langdon, Kennedy and Hammer available for the
twirling staff, the team was unbeatable. Carlson played second, Hastings was
at short, and the incomparable “_]immy" DeHart at third base. The outﬁeld
was taken care of by Ceisel, Sies and Kuhlman. Sies developed fast under Blair
and played good ball. His home run won the first game from Lehigh. A
I5-inning tie game with Swarthmore was one of the brilliant feats of the year.
West Virginia—-old baseball rival—was beaten twice. So was W. &  Tech
and Lafayatte. State won two out of three.

Owing to the war there will be no Varsity baseball in |9l8 but inter-depart-
ment games will likely be substituted

hole in the I917 track schedule, Coach Kerr kept his men plugging
steadily throughout the season with excellent results.

, ' The relay team, composed of Burwell, Crumbling, Walker

The University Intercollegiate and Interscholastic meet—the eleventh
annual~—was held as usual at Schenley Oval, May I9, and developed into a bitter
fight between Pitt and Penn State. State won 96 to 83, the meet being decided
in the last two events. The Pitt athletes did Valiant work but weren’t quite able
to nose out the Mt. Nittany crowd.

Dual meets were held later with Carnegie Tech and State, the former result-
ing in an overwhelming Pitt victory. State won the dual at State college by a
close score. Sutherland won three firsts in this meet. The big Scot was re-
elected captain for I9|8Aa wise choice. Burwell, Sheehan and Crumbling were

among the 1917 graduates. Curry, Weigel and Walker are in the service and
not available for the l9l8 team. John R. B. Byers is the Manager.

FRANK J. SHEA

No individual athlete has brought more glory to the University than Frank
J. Shea, a Sophomore in the School of Economics. In the summer of I917 Shea
startled the athletic world by trimming the famous "Ted" Meredith in a 440-yd.
dash. The feat was accomplished at the Middle Atlantic Association A. A. U.
championships at Franklin ﬁeld, August 25, and Shea's time was 49 seconds. It
was the first defeat Meredith ever received at Franklin field in five years compe-
tition. Later in the 29th Annual Championships of the A. A. U. held at St.
Louis, August 3|, and September I, Shea won both the Junior and Senior 440
events. His time in the former was 50 seconds and in the latter 49 3-5 seconds.

Shea entered the University from Irwin High School. He is a member of
Sigma Kappa Pi Fraternity.

HE minor sports--wrestling, tennis and swimming-——were greatly
effected by the war and there were no college matches in any except
tennis. Wrestling never seemed to stir up much enthusiasm among
the students and after the winter of I917 it was decided to do
— ’‘ away with it for the present. It is a hard sport that requires the
stiffest course of training on the part of all participants. Owing to the fact that
the majority of the Pitt students have to go home after their classes and are not
located in convenient “dorms" nearby the gymnasium where they can slip over
for a workout, good results were never obtained in this branch of sport. I t was
also very hard to get matches with college teams as few institutions supported
wrestling. In future years, this sport may experience a revival and when it does,
it will again be taken up by the athletic authorities.

 

The l9l8 swimming season did not include any college matches but the team
was kept in training by Coach John T. Taylor and participated in a number of
local meets. Harry  Taylor won many honors in local and foreign tanks, one
of his notable achievements being the winning of the I50 yard back stroke and
the 500 yard championships of the Allegheny Mountain Association, A. A. U.,
at Columbus, 0., March 9. The relay swimming team, composed of Taylor,
Sweet, McCracken and Foster, also won many honors. This is another branch
of sport where trouble is experiencing in getting a schedule of college matches
as no institution hereabouts supports teams.

The tennis schedule for I9] 7 was ambitious but when war was declared and
the schools started cancelling their matches only six remained. Of these, the
Panthers succeeded in winning two games, tieing one and losing three. The
surprise of the season was the 4-2 defeat of Carnegie Tech, conceded by experts
to be a sure winner. The record follows:

May 2 Pitt 2 West Virginia 2
May 9 Pitt 4 Westminster 0
May I6 Pitt 2 Penn State 4
May I9 Pitt 2 W.&J. 4
May 22 Pitt 4 Carnegie Tech 2
June 2 Pitt 0 Penn State 6

The tennis team was composed of Mohn, lsherwood, Spindler and Wil-
lison, the latter being Manager-player.

HE I917 Freshman football team had a sort of in-and—out record, this
being due largely to the inexperience of the line and ends and the
fact that Coach Kerr had to start right in with his hard games before

3 I he could do any experimenting. He had the eleven going just right

Ll-‘L;.-.’/.951‘ for the ﬁnal game with the strong Penn State Freshmen at Forbes

Field, which ended 0-0. The State yearlings had run over all opponents up to

that game and came to the Steel City brimful of conﬁdence. The Freshmen

also sprung a big surprise against Indiana Normal, defeating them 7-0.

The first game was with Kiski, which the previous Saturday had scored on
and played a close game with the W. &  Varsity. Syracuse Freshmen were
played a close game and won by a long run in what was otherwise an even battle.
The Penn Freshman game found the Pitt boys in a slump and they did not show
true form. The game was played on Franklin Field, which has always been a
“hoodoo" for all Pitt football teams.‘ Bellefonte Academy was an easy victim.

Poindexter and Mervis starred in the line for the Freshmen. Homer was a
Varsity caliber quarterback, and Hileman, McCracken, Curry and Friedman
were also exceptionally good backﬁeld performers.

HE Freshman basketball team kept up the record made by the great
" l9l7 outﬁt and won I3 out of 16 games. Dr. N. C. Ochsenhirt,
former Varsity player, was again the coach. William B. Paul was
the manager. While the team was not as husky as the yearling five
of the previous year it was fast and every player an accurate shot.

 

Coach Ochsenhirt had to do considerable shifting during the season for vari-
ous reasons. Silberstein, who promised to be a star at forward, was debarred for
playing on an outside team without permission, and the faculty also refused to
permit Mervis in the last three or four games. Kelley was the leading scorer.
Ross developed fast for the other forward. McCrory and Masley were good cen-
ters. In Mervis and Bremen the team had two wonderful guards.

The only defeats were sustained away from home—at Indiana Normal,
Kiski and Charleroi High. The team should furnish some good material for I918
Varsity.

ATHLETICS

Qirla’ Eaakethall

HEN one is speaking of Pitt athletics he doesn't want to forget about
the great record of the Girls’ Basketball team. F or three years the
girls have had great basketball teams and during the season of V916
and I917 they did not receive a single defeat. This season the trick
was ﬁnally turned by the Pittsburgh Training Teachers’ team. The
game was played at Trees gymnasium and the Pitt girls lost by a single point——
l8-I7. The playing of Miss Marshall of the Teachers’ team was a revelation,
and it was her individual performance that brought the initial defeat to the Pitt
Girclls. A total of ten games were played during the season and a splendid record
ma e.

The forwards were Minnie Wehmeier, Mary Stokes, Grace Vohr and Grace

guards. Margaret McClenahan was the center and ‘Leila Lewis and Anna

University of Pittsburgh
Alumni Insurance Endowment Fund

It is the one plan that will enable you to do something fine and
big for Pitt at very little cost or inconvenience to you.

Will you do it? Will you help insure Pitt's future?

Except for the business of war, the work of the universities is the
most vitally important work in America today. After the war
there will be need of a larger number of persons expert in the
various fields of applied science than ever before. i

The universities must produce these men. The need is urgent.
Pitt must go forward. Pitt will go forward.

INSURE PITT'S FUTURE
BY INSURING FOR PITT

Owing to our country’s participation in this present great world
war, which means that service to our country comes first, active
promotion of the insurance endowment fund has been suspended
until victory is ours. At that time renewed energy and effort
will be instilled in this great project, with the ultimate object of
enrolling the assistance of each and every alumnus and friend
of the University.

Donora High School

We don't hear from George very often. for he is
quiet and reserved. However. this adds rather
than distracts from his popularity. He is a good
student.

Altoona High School

Isn't responsible for coming from Altoona.
Makes up for it by knowing everything in all the
books. Quiet, digniﬁed, reserved, we ﬁnd her with
a placid smile. We think we would like her if she
would let us know her.

RICHARD A. GRAVES. "Dick"
Dormant, Pa.
Union High School

u .

Having a name like grades, what could one expect
to ﬁnd but a serious-minded individual much given
to study? He says his ﬁrst name is Dick, but no
one ever got familiar enough with him to call him
that. They say he carries matches but no one ever
saw him smoke. Even if he does prefer marble
goddesses to real ones, who can account for taste?
He makes grades that would satisfy the sternest
parent, and has a 500 man-power brain.

EDNA JUNE GRAY, A Z
Munhall, Pa.
Munhail High School

Serious, digniﬁed, attractive to the nth power.
As for studying, she could tell the man who wrote
the psychology books how to concentrate.

MARY REGINA GRIFFIN, Dianthian
Pittsburgh, Pa.
Peabody High School
Newman Club

We can’t write all the interesting sides there are
to Mary's character because we haven't suﬂicient
vocabulary. We do ﬁnd her serious, interesting
and dependable. . She loves highbrow drama. Has
a sweet low voice, and a tumed-up nose.

FOR a long time the slogan of the Lee Smith Company
has been “Smith’s Service Satisﬁes.”

It was not chosen simply for its euphony.

If you—~who may not now be using Smith service—will
ask dentists who are, we feel sure that their answers will
justify the slogan.

Smith’s Service Satisﬁes does not mean that We never make
mistakes. For we do.

It does mean that our people have the desire to serve you
quickly and well and the organization and the equipment
with which to materialize that desire.

Smith’s Service is based upon a knowledge of the require-
ments of dentistry gained in serving the profession for
more than 52 years.

Kochin possesses the uncanny knack of hitting
the nail on the head and seeing the point at issue
with a clarity that is given only those of sound
cerebration. We expect big things of him as we

This quaint little lady smacks of the Orient and
makes you think of tea houses and tiny-feeted
women. She was thoroughly welcomed at Pitt
as being the first of her country women to arrive,
and if they are all like Bee Dee, we expect innova-
tions. Seemingly she is an infant prodigy and a
precious baby for she is but sixteen, and a junior.

THEODORE MONK, “Te  E K H

Wilkinsburg, Pa.

Norwick High School

This debonair youth is the one man in the class
who looks well in his cadet suit. He appears as a
Prussian ofﬁcer, if we may be forgiven. They say
he is a minister’s son, but you never can tell. He
takes life too seriously and spends more time in the
Reference Room than he does eating.

MARIE A. MURPHY

Newman Club
A young lady accomplished in a number of ways.
he is a chemist of renown. We expect to see her
head of the Mellon Institute some day. She teaches
dancing with an efficiency that is purely Teutonic.
A lil' way with the profs makes her report look like
the first page or an alphabet book. Has never been
known to have a pin out of place or a crooked hair.
Runs the 560 soldiers of the Signal Service.

We wish all the world were as straight as the part

HELEN P. Rusn. A Z

Helen's ready sympathy and willingness renders

height. If she doesn't graduate with a "magna

"Let him live to be a hundred, we need‘ him on
earth." A curly headed man with a gentle dispo-
sition. Contributes much to the pleasantness of a
class meeting, by not attending. Happy-go—lucky
George! Long live George!

LOUIS LEVY

How much this man is like a rabbit,
For instance, both have pleasing habit,
Both are quiet; both are small;

Quick to act; and liked by all.

DAVID H. LIGHT H A (I)

Evening School Editor 1919 Owl; “Thursday

Niter"

What's in a name? A great deal sometimes,
especially if you have your best girl in the dark. No
matter how dark it is, Light is always “around."
The brightest Light in Thaw Hall.

Likes the ladies, but is very
Industrious; always striving to
Get ahead; one of

His best assets is
Thoroughness.

ROBERT L. LIPPERT
Turtle Creek, Pa.

"Virtues are lost in interest as rivers are in the
sea." Don't judge a man by the town that he comes
from. Robert is different. He is far from a “small
town guy."

GLENN S. MILLER

Pittsburgh, Pa.

"A center from which the brightest rays radiate."
Glenn's popular song for the last two months was
"I think I am, I think I’m not." The answer to th s
is that Glenn thought he was a Junior when he
wasn't. But now he is. He knew so much law
they simply had to give him credit for it. Glenn is
one of the ﬁnest men that ever lived behind a mus-
tache.

He's a good business manager; he works earnestly
A lover of women, we all must agree;

He's kind, witty, wise, true, polite,

But much like an owl, he's out every night;

He will lend you money, he smokes just a bit;
He’s a friend to the fellow who wishes it.

He is a good fellow.

PHILIP SIMoNs
Swlssvale, Pa.

“There are some bad qualities that make great
accomplishments." Have you ever played “Simons
Says"? Well, what Simons says goes. Simons
knows a lot, and usually lets everyone know it.
However, he makes a “cold and dark and dreary
day" seem as if “behind the clouds the sun's still
shining." He's some man, believe me.

ERNEST _I. WAGNER
Beaver Falls, Pa.

A man’s a man for a’ that.

"Thumbs up" for the man that comes all the way
from Beaver Falls every night to school. And he
has been doing it for three solid years. Ernest does
not believe that “Early to bed and early to rise
makes a man a farmer." He's a man with a golden
chassis.

Our President, who hails from far lands,
ls with us and will shake your hand,
Give you a smile, make you his friend.
This lord of Braddock is some gusher
And has some rep as a heart crusher.

I hate myself and therefore shall

Allow some pal my tale to tell.

He says I'm good on diagnosis

And hopes I won't prove a poor prognosis.
New read those rotten rhymes of mine,
And heat the Kaiser to the Rhine.

HOWARD RAYMOND WEDDELL, B.S., (D R 2

Elizabeth, Pa.
Prodigal Club

He's sort of quiet, but gets his lesson;
He comes to school and does no guessin';
Does what he's told, although it's hard,
And does not need a teacher guard.

This lad will make his mark some day,
Which will him in the end repay.
