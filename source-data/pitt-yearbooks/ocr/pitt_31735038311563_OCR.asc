Many ii13eraI—arts majors wonder what they wiff he
aide to do with their degree in the 1990's. The most
popuiar answerto this question seems to he; anything!

Yet it is the open-ended quaﬁty of the  of
iifrerai arts that proves to he both its strength and its
weakness.

Robert Hopkins, director of the University of Pitts-
burgh's Pfacement Service, describes fiberai-arts majors
as ‘non-tech” and fucking a direct career focus. Mhgors
such as poiiticaf science, Engﬁsh, phiiosophy, ' erai
studies, and chemistry fit into this category.

Instead of risking uncertainty, many students 0 t
for professionai or technicaf majors. The demand jiojr
engineers, accountants and computer programmers can
he very appealing to a student dreaming no/{ success.

However, according to Hopkins, [iher -arts majors
are at no reai disadvantage when searching or a job.

"There is a misdirection that occtus w n peopie
[ooh at the career opportunities in terms of the first '06
out of coffege," said Hopkins. "(Studies show) ir
successes and achievements are at least as good and
sometimes surpass those of their professionaﬂy or
technicaﬂy trained coffeagues."

Unfortunateiy, it takes more ejj‘ort or the [iheraI-
arts graduate to get his or rhlepffirstjoﬁ a r coffege than
it takes for a professio or tec icafiy trained
graduate. More pianning a job searching need to he
done Because as httfe as 35 to 40 percent ofthe on-
campus recruiters hire technicai majors.

Tum N151

Hopkins emphasizes, though, that the ratio of
technicaf and professionaf recruiters to Iifreraf-arts re-
cruiters does not represent the recdity of the job market.

”There may he four, five, eight or tenjobs that do
not require a technicai Background for every one that
does," he said. "But non—technicaI students are not
recruited in the same way, and that's the imhafance
that appears."

Des ite their seemi I o aths to the ture,
[iIJeraI—hJrts majors arengegsefngighfyp [imitfess inf“ their
career possihiﬁties. "But not Being [imited is scary and
threatening," Hopkins said.

The jofrs are out therefor fiberaf-arts major; they
just have to he found. According to Hopkins, the key
tofinding alfjoh is that a student studying in the ﬁheraf
arts has to ecide at sorrre point what it is he wants to
do, counsehng on campus to "start weeding through
those opportunities that fit and those that don't."

Also, gaining experience ilrliﬁpart-tirrie ‘ob, intem-
ship or other opportunity, in ition to t academic
work, is important. Lastiy, the placement center,
thouﬂjh [imited in on-campus recruiting, ossihiiities
for ' erai-arts majors, can he students vise ajob—

A few? Lhi  ﬁt hofd jhhs for [iIJeraI—arts
majors incfude heahh and weffare, sociaf-security ad-
ministrators, government saies, pubiic reiations, man-
agement, the media, advertising and customer service.
Aho a fiberaf-arts major is an ideaf preparation for a

graduate program in education, law, Business m.
icine.
Hank Lerner, a junior at Pitt, is a Ciﬁerails‘
major who pfans to attend [aw schooiupon grad,‘
"I chose hherai studies Because it's a good‘
arationfor [aw schooﬁ Aﬁso, it gives me the c
take the courses I’m interested instead offoffo ‘
requirements of a specific major," he said.
Other hﬁeraf-arts students are not so sure
future their current major hofds. Juliana Ratkie
senior theatre-arts ma'or, said, "I tried a ew
practicaf lrtrrjors-husingss and pre-med and if

didn't care about them. I became a theatre-arts
because I fove to act. I don't know  I'd ever

‘People don'tjust need to know how to do

The inevitabfe communication probfem with
foreign TA's is a serious probiem for many
5mdents. As one anonymous engineering stu-
dent in an upper-fevei math cfass said, "It is so
fmsmmng just trying to get through to him."
Last semester, candidates for Student Govem-
ment Board positions vowed to do something
about it. And so has  at the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh.

However, for the past two years the Schooi

compfete the training and demonstrate proficiency
before being cdfowed to actuaify teach a cfass. A
committee consisting of Baidauf, Harper, Waters
and three members of the Engineering Student
Cabinet is presently drawing up a proposaf to make
this a requirement in CA5.

Bafdaufsaid that he specificaﬂy wants to propose
this to the math and physics departments, which
have the biggest probfem. He said that committee
members have seen vast improvement in the quaiity
of teaching engineering courses since this program
has been impfemented.

"The main thing we want to do is make it
mandatory that the TA finish the course before
entering the cfassroom," Bafdauf said. He feels the
root of the probfem is that many people in graduate
schoo[s are foreigners; "Americans just are not
going to grad schoof.”

under the present pobicy, afi TA's are evaluated
in some way. The office for the Evafuation of
Teaching administers surveys to ad undergraduate
students. Although statistics are now hept by the

office and ad information hept confidential} the
various departments the information _the evaI—
uation office provides.

"Each department uses the information dif-
ferently," Debbie Hazfett from the office ex-
pfained However, as data are coffected at the
end of a semester, changes often are not seen
unt-if the foffowing year.

Hazfett sites changes in the math department
as evidence that the does consider the
students‘ viewpoints. According to her, the
math department wiII now use non-Engiish
speaking TAs for Recitations oniy.

The SGB proposaf should be presented within
a month. Baidauf said that CA5 Dean Mary
Briscoe has afready expressed her supporting the
SGB-proposed program. ”‘,’ou won't see any

health record administrators and an 87-percent jump

loohs even brighter for occupational therapists, with

With an aging population and constant advances

Opportunities in dental medicine and pharmacy
also are expectedto increase, but the less puﬁlicized

The university Honors Coffege exists to provide
afmnative academic opportunities to motivated stu-
dents, acwrdirtg to LLHC Dean Aiec Stewart.

"yvg want them to he aff they can be ac-
adgmicaﬂy. The course worft is demanding, but
mmgwgg, in terms ofworﬁioad,” Stewart said.

Directors of UHC Advising Kim Watterson said
5tu1fgnt5 have reported in their course evafuations
tfuu "they have worfced a [at harder" in UHC
courses than in other classes they have tahen at the
university.

"They all have a high degree ofsatisfaction with
the work they've done," Watterson said.

Stewart said that 90 percent of students who
take a UHC course indicate on their evaluations that
they woufd [ihe to tahe another.

This satisfaction is generaffy the resuit of the
”vo[unteerism" of Both students and  in
UHC, Watterson said. ”No one wiif ever au-
tomaticaﬂy put a student in an honors course. You
have to voiunteer," she continued.

Stewart said ad UHC  must submit pro-
posafs for a course they wish to teach as Honors

Watterson said UHC offers courses in ad dis-
cipﬁnes and programs in the university.

LLHC hiofogy, chemistry and physics courses are
most popuiar with freshmen, and upper-fevei stu-
dents are often interested in Fuunanities courses, she
expfained.

Stewart said programming is another important
component of UHC.

"We try to foster academic comrruinity among
students," he said. UHC works to  speahers
and seminars to the university and encourages

informaf visitations By schofars and other prominent
peopfe, Stewart said.

Watterson said these visitations are important to
the Honors Coifege. "A Big part of the students’
satisfaction with their courses is their comrnon—
afity," she exphined.

Though UHC fists a 3.25 QPA as a requirement
for participation in the program, Watterson said it
is important for students who do not meet this
prerequisite, but are interested in  UHC
courses, to speak with a UHC advisor.

"The number doesn't necessarify matter as much
as the student's motivation. The numericaf data
isn't aiways the best indicator," Watterson con-
tinued

UHC advisors can give students whose QPA is
hefow a 3.25 special permission to enroifin courses.

Keeping up with thejoneses has aiways been
a primary concern of many Americans. That
popufar attitude has seemingiy found its way
into the offices of Pitt's Coffege of Arts and
Sciences.

During an evafuation of poiieies and pro-
cedures two years ago, Coffege of Arts and
Sciences Dean Mary Louise Briscoe changed the
criteria for students to make the Dean's List.

"Looking at our criteria against that of com-
parabie universities, we recdized that our stand-
ards (for the Dean’s List) were somewhat fow,"
Briscoe said

Before then, students were required to carry a
fail foad of 12 credits and have a Q.P.A. of at
feast 3.25. Briscoe raised the Q.P.A. require-
ment to 3.5. On the average, 1,500 students
used to mahe the fist. Since the change, the
average has dropped to 1,000.

"There certainfy haven’t been any compiaints
afrout the new poﬁcy. Everyone seems to he
satisfied," Briscoe said.

She also redesigned the certificate that students
receive in the maif when they mahe the fist, which
is the second part of the recognition, Besides having
the [ist puhiicfy posted each semester.

"The Dean’s List is a recognition on a term—6y-
term basis for outstanding academic achievement,"
Briscoe said.

Afthough most universities such as Penn State,
do heep the Q.P.A. requirement at 3.5, there are a
few that stray ahove and frefow the norm.

At Tempie, onfy a 3.2 is needed for freshmen,
and uppercfassmen need a 3.3 to make the fist. The
university of Caﬁfomia at Berhfey sets a high
standard with a 3.8 requirement; of more than
15,000 undergraduates in the Coiiege of Letters
and Sciences, oniy 200 mahe the Dean's List every
semester.

Methods of recognition afso differ from schoof to
schoof.

"Here at Penn State we [ihe to recognize the
students By puhiishing the Dean’s List in our
newspaper, the Center Daily Times. Everyone who

3
mahes the fist gets a [etterfrom theDean,” sag;

psychology, economics, musing, computer science,

mechanical engineering, Business, political science,

science as the ten most popular majors of graduation
seniors.

Pitt offers unique majors such as crystallography,

the only one in the United States; and one of the
ﬁest ranked philosophy programs in the country.
-Altogether Pitt has 404 separate degree programs.

All students at Pitt are required to complete a
major in order to graduate. A major usually consists
of a minimum of 24 credits. No major requires a
-student to tahe more than 40 credits in any single
ptlepartment, although some majors may require as
many as 60 or more credits distributed over several
departments. There are even dual majors oﬁered
‘such as Business /psychology and political sci-
ence/philosophy. A student even has the option of

 

designing their own major. If students wish to tahe

Pitt's diversity and dedication to academic ex-

majors offered here.

Robert Tosatto already hnew that he was going
to be awarded the Facts and Comparison Award in
Pharmacy before going to yesterday's aruiual Hon-
ors Convocation. But when he got there, he got a
surprise.

Tosatto, a senior in the School of Pharmacy, also
won the E. D. Loclze Award for the outstanding
graduating senior who is devotedto the high stand-
ards of the University of Pittsburgh.

"I was rather surprised, infact," he said "I
really didn'texpectthatI hadachanceaftermeeting
with the board.”

Tosatto was one of many Pitt students and
faculty to receive awards at the ceremony, which
was held in the Carnegie Music Hall.

Pitt President Wesley Posvar started the event
by  onthe students to become leaders oftheir
generation.

"You are going to be leaders in remahing the city
of Pittsburgh," he said "You will also play an
increasing role in the environment around us.”
Posvar also said that the students were a ”force of
wisdom and good that will transcend national

Awtmrs

Provost Donald Henderson then presented the
first awards which went to the academic under-
graduate honorees. "The university tahes great
pride in honoring you today," he told them.

Eric Maisel, winner of four awards, including the
British Marshall Scholar Award, gave the response
for the awardees.

”Ours is not a static world," he said "We have
to develop the ability to leave the world a better
place than... wefoundit."

After the presentation of the graduate and pro-
fessional academic honorees, the winners of awards
for student leadership were recognized Among
these awardees were Tosatto and Gil Boroh, who
was awarded senior of the year.

But students were not the only ones that were
recognized  the ceremony. A group of
members were also recognized for outstanding
achievements.

In the  response, Reginald McKnight,
who also won four awards, including the Kenyon
Review Award for Literary Excellence, told the

audience that awards were great, but also Wm
them, "Don't get big headed"

An honorary degree was given to Dr. Leon
Lederman, a Nobel Prize winning physicist f.
the university of Chicago. In his acceptance spa
Lederrnan gave some statistics showing the lad
scientiﬁc hnowledge among American students,

”In a test of ninth grade students, students in?
United States finished 13th out of 13 mum,
tested in biology, 11th in chemistry and nintﬁ
physics," he said

Lederman also called on the awardees to raise
global standard of living.

worhs hops.

Koesel said.

Things aren’t always easy in college Exams, roommates and jobs are enough to get many people down. For people who need to sort things out,
Pitt's Counseling and Student Development Center is there to lend an ear and offerfree, confidential advice

The counseling center, located on the third floor of the William Pitt union, is composed of three areas: career-development counseling,
psychological counseling and the Learning Shills Center. A trained professional staff meets with students individually and also conducts group

The center’ 5 assistant director, jean Koesel, said that while all areas are utilized frequently by students, more people come for psychological
counseling and are seen individually by a counselor.
"The  that brings more people here than any other is trouble with rebitions hips. It could be with a roommate, boyfriend, or girlfriend, parents
or in general. But it’s usually (this type) of trouble that makes students decideto talh to somebody about it, somebody who's a neutral party,"

One-on-one  seems to be what students prefer when it comes to personal probhms. ”It seems harder for students to come for a group
(session) than for individual counseling. But I’m not sure what the reason is for that,” Koesel said

Many group discussions and worhshops are offered by the counseling center, but they are sparsely attended, Koesel said Sessions include stress
reduction, procrastination, women's issues, interpersonal relationships, shyness and public speaking anxiety. The counseling staff tries to encourage
students to participate in these worlzshops as much as possible.

One area where groups are used heavily is in career counseling. If a student comes to the center wanting career counseling, "the secretary will

probably automatically schedule them for one of our career groups," Koesel said The three session worhshop includes a standardized interest test
"The basic idea ofthe workshop is to help a student hnow how to mahe a career decision — what hinds of things they should be thinking about;
where they cango toﬁnd out about the things they're interested in, and how they canfigure out what they want and don't want. The idea is to teach
people how to make a decision," Koesel said

Because each student is different,  a decision about a career or other problems is important. Students sometimes find that to be a surprise.

It seems that you've made it through the ups and
downs o your undergraduate years of college.

It's een four scrutinizing years of decid' who,
what, when, where, why, and how to s y. But
somehow, you've managed to choose a major, satisfy
all the academic requirements, register for graduation
on time, and make it to the Original Hotdog Shop at
least once a week.

Now you are aced with another decision Do you
purchase a tw suit and apply for ajoB, or do ou
sweat it out for another two to four years in g te
school?

According to BoB Perkokski, Associate Director of
the University Placement Service, the number of Pitt
students involved in on-campus joB interviewing has
increased somewhat this year.

"There has Been real high traffic this year (in the

lacement center)/’ said Perkokski. "This year has
Brought a large amount of recruiting from the Fortune
500 companies. But the smaller companies are 
their mark, too," he added.

Perkokski states that government joBs have Been
currently on the increase Because of such things as
Better advertising. He said that along with this, the
retail industry continues to grow in college in such
occupations as assistant Buying.

As or "safe" majors that guarantee joBs today,
Perkos ' said that areas such as the health-related

' ( . ha )ande ineeri arewellinthe
jccl)eBM$mar ES  need tn?Be sellegtjlve in chooit?
majors though, making sure that chosen areas of s
coincide with their personal interests  they wish to B:
successful in Both school and thejol) market.

"People must Be careful. You don’t want to Be

guided too much By the media," said Perkoski. ”(Students) must Be

 

ood researchers in terms of finding out a5“
dijferentjoBs. If eople go into careers Because they are popular, y may Be dissatisfied and find themset,
wan’ to switc careers," headded. ‘

"(Switching careers) is what you realize, though, is that smaller companies, as well as companies that are,‘
widel advertised, can also 0 er rewarding positions.”

T newer industries 'ng waves in the joB market include Banking and sales, which with commissiq
added can Be higher paying positions.

The environment service industry also is proving to Be a new source of joBs. "We are facing the graying
America," said Perkoski. According to Perkoski as the population continues to age, careers such as nursing (M

facilitators continue to open up.

Liberal arts students continue to have the hardest time finding joBs, Because companies do r1ot recruit ff“
majors as often as others.

As far as what companies are looking for, some place high emphasis on grades, with others placing rnodm
emphasaiia on them. Skills, npérsonality and activities can also play a art in the hiring process.

"Gr emphasis depe upon the history o the company, sa' Perkoski.

A large ppgflilemformcgzrrent co e gpjads caﬁrj; ' in the area of experience. Many companies want professio,
experience a most 5 nts stmpy not ve it. ’

A student's participation in one or more internships duri his or her undergraduate years can prove Beneﬁt,
”I think (internships) are a real lus," said Perkoskil. "T y should not Be ones where the work (is) terﬁq

Many students do opt for this choice, saying that the likelihood of a school accepting them seems Betterthn
company accepting them or ajoB.

O n, mid-sized to rger companies offer tuition Benefits for employees to enter graduate school wt’
wor i for the company, with one stipulation Being that selected courses must coincide with the type of wt

Students continue to contemplate Both options according to Perkoski. Often experiencing the “real world"

With each ving different needs, students will Best Be aBle to decide themselves which option to choost

"It's very competitive," said Perkoski. "On the one hand, (looking for ajoB) may Be a long shot, Butort
other hand, there are gairly lar e groups of students Being hired,” he added ‘

According to Per ski, w tever decision ou choose, you must start early. Procrastination will get
nowhere, either in applying to graduate schoo or in looking for a job. t

”Most students get involved (in the ' ' process) six to nine weeks Before graduation," said P A

‘ Dance O
wtth Diversity

Fehruary 9, 1990 was a Big day for PISO, Pitt International Student Organization. We introduced to
the students of Pitt our very own ”Dance With Diversity” Semi-forrmd dance. The dance was held in the
AssemB[y Room inthe Wifﬁam Pitt Union and it was opento everyone. It was the Biggest event PLSO put
on ever.

The dance was an incrediﬁie success. The numﬁer of students who attended was  A[[ in ad
159 individuafs participated and contriﬁutedto thefun time we shared.

Many wi[IproBaB[y think ’’Oh, there was a dance, Big deaf!” Let me ted ad ofthose that this dance did
notturnoutto Bejustanotherdance Butmuchmore. I-‘irstofali, as diverseas thestudent Body is atPitt, the
dance encompassed ad Einds of student Bachgrounds. Americans and foreign students aﬁhe joined the dance
ﬂoor to get together and move to rap and reggae, to the famﬁada and other Latin American rhythms, to
French and other internationaf Bands. International students were encouraged to Bring music from their
native country. The idea was to expose people to diﬁerent sounds and rhythms. The crdturaf Background of
thesestudents addednew dimensionstothedance. Butthis is notaff. Thedancewas notordyunique By
getting peopfefrom ad over the worfd together, it afso made it ready easy to meet new peopie. It Became a
pargi where By the end of the night everyBody Enew everyBody else and consequently everyBody danced
with everyBody. No cliques, no groups, simpfy a  crowd of 159. just imagine that!

University poiicies state that ad events schedided in the Union have to end by 12:30 am. However, that
was when thefun ready started! Some peopfe kft and went home, hat the majority met again at
Hemingway’s 15 minutes after the official: end of the Semi-I-‘otmaf. We the whofe Each room pfus
some seats eﬂsewhere. I Bet Hemingway’s was happy. After one hour there, hag‘ of us were getting 
So we divided evetyﬁody to  the avaifaﬁfe cars to the most possiﬁfe extent. After aIL it was only a 10
minute ride to Eat andParh wefound some peopfe who we thought we had feftthe party eatfy. It is a smalf
worfd indeed. I think it was 3:30 when wefinaffy [eft and went our separate ways.

Ithadheenafong dayforme. Butevery minuteofprepatationpaidoﬁandthesuccess madeitaff
worthwhile’

Pitt Internationaf Student Organization, hnown as PISO, brings together intemationaf and American
students. It provides Both with a cidtund exchange, enhancing in eachthe understanding ofthe worfd at
large. Through sociaf events, deﬁates and discussion aﬁout current events and cuftures, as weff as
thorough information aﬁout American iifestyfe, PISO Brings the wmfd to you right on Pitt’s campus.

  And, of course, along with the traditions
on the field and gym floor, are those that
occur in the stands. There are the pregame tailgate parties at which students
get geared up for the game, the saving of
seats by fraternity and sorority members,
the cries of "Hail to Pitt!" and "P-E-N-N-ST S S!"; and the furious shouting and
stomping of everyone's feet on the
bleachers when an opponent is at the free
throw line.
  All of these combine in a unique way to
form and continue to carry on the Tradition of Excellence that IS Pitt Athletics.

       Beware the Ides of
           December...
F riends, students, faculty, lend me your ears:
     I have come, in a sense, to bury Gottfried, not t(
  praise him.
The defeats coaches suffer live after them:
the good is oft interred with their bones;
So let it be with Gottfried. The noble Bozik
Hath told you Gottfried was ambitious:
If it were so, it was a grievous fault,
And grievously hath Gottfried answered it.
Here, under the leave of Bozik and the rest -
For Bozik is an honorable man;
So are they all, all honorable men -
Come I to speak in Gottfried's departure.
He was a friend, accommodating and kind to me:
But Bozik says he was ambitious;
And Bozik is an honorable man.
He hath brought many victories to Pitt,
Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill:
Did this in Gottfried seem ambitious?
When the team hath lost, Gottfried hath vept:

Ambition should be made of sterner stuff:
     Yet Bozik says he was ambitious;
And Bozik is an honorable man.
You did hear of a sophomore walk-on in financial
  trouble
'Til Gottfried presented him grant-in-aid,
"I don't know that you'll ever play a down,"
He told AnthonyJagers. "I'll tell you
How to pay me back. Study hard. Graduate.
Be a good person. " Was this ambition?
Yet Bozik says he is ambitious;
And, sure, he is an honorable man.
I speak not to disprove what Bozik spoke,
But I am here to speak what I do know.
You all did love him once, not without cause:
What cause withholds you to mourn for him?
O judgement! thou art based on wins and losses,
Thus men might lose their reason. Bear with me;
My heart is in the empty office of Mike Gottfried.
Yet, regrettably, Iforce myself to
Understand why this event had to occur.
Shakespeare's tragedy is alive and well in 1990.

A.Topsy-Turvy Season for
         Panther Cagers
   or the 1989-90 Pitt Panther basketball team, this past one
   was a season of heartbreaks. Despite Rod Brookin's scor   ing his 1.000th career point at the Civic Arena on Feb   26th, sparkling performances all season by Jason
ews, Brian Shorter, Darrelle Porter, and Bobby Martin, and
  over Oklahoma State (twice) and Arizona, there were
  pcin the system too numerous to count. For the team that was
  edin the top 20 in almost every national poll and third in the
0 East in the preseason, depth, the loss of five top recruits to
Wpooition 48, and the loss of Sean Miller to injury really hurt.
Xer's injury, which was thought at first to be a stress fracture
  wd as to keep him out for only four weeks, ended up being
  eserious than originally thought and required surgery;
oping him out for the rest of the season. The loss of recruits due
Prop. 48 and the recent university crackdown on studentk&amp;tes who don't meet NCAA and university standards also
  the team s hopes for a championship season. But, probably
rbiggest problem of the season turned out to be depth - the
,rthers' lack of it. Since Coach Evans didn't have much of a
poch to look to for help, he had to rely on the five starters and
   or three backups to last the entire game. Thus, causing
 sy of those heartbreaking games that were lost in the final
 utes. But, through it all, the coach and team kept a positive
 Tude and didn't quit, even when they were down. Now, isn't
 at what sportsmanship is all about?

Mexican Standoff, Pittsburgh style!
          Soccer team concludes season with 1-1 tie
T    he Pitt soccer team completed their 1989 season with a 1-1 tie at Grove City on Tuesday (October 31). The Panthers
     finished with a winning record (8-6-3).
       After playing to a 0-0 deadlock in regulation time, the Panthers scored in the first overtime period; Huy Tran fielded a
punt by Pitt goalkeeper Jay Kapusta, nodded the ball past a defender and scored.
  Grove City tied the game with four minutes left in the second overtime when Kapusta slipped on the wet field, allowing an
easy goal.
  Coach Joe Luxbacher said the game was typical of the entire season for the Panthers. "We dominated the game, but failed
to capitalize," he said.
  The Panthers outshot Grove City 22-6 and held the edge in number of comer kicks, 7-1.
  Tran, a freshman walk-on, was the Panthers' leading scorer this season with seven goals and two assists for 16 points.
Tran did not begin the season as a member of the team because his freshman eligibility papers were not approved in time. "I
didn't even know about him at the beginning of the season," said Luxbacher.
  Other Panther leading scorers were junior co-captain Mike Blatz (six goals and three assists for 15 points), senior Heinz Pak
(two goals and five assists for nine points), and freshman Don Overmeier (three goals and no assists for six points).
  The Panthers scored 25 goals in 17 games. "We created many more chances (than last year)," said Luxbacher. "We just
didn't firush them. With a couple of breaks we could have won two or three more games."
  Luxbocher commended his team for not letting injuries affect their play. "They could have used injuries as an excuse (for
losing).,,
  Panther goalkeeper Jay Kapusta, a junior, finished the season with a 6-6-3 record and allowed 1.36 goals per game with
three shutouts. He also recorded a rare assist against Grove City. "Jay has matured. He was much more consistent (this
year)," said Luxbacher. Throw out the 8-1 loss to Seton Hall and Kapusta's average goals against average would drop below
  Coach Luxbacher has a lot to look forward to next season, with his goalkeeper and three of his top scorers returning. "We
have a good nucleus coming back. We've got to get better around the goal."

           Miller forced to look on as team struggles
A   ll Sean Miller can do for the rest of the year is watch.
      He can't bring the ball up the court. He can't move closer to Pitt's career assist record. And he
can't contribute any more three-pointers to the Panther offense.
  When Miller first injured his foot before the season started, it was thought to be a stress fracture
and many believed he would be ready for Pitt's opener. But weeks passed, and the foot didn't heal. It
was determined that it wasn't a stress fracture and it would take longer to heal than initially thought.
  "It's like a genetic thing, I have two bones rubbing against each other, and they shouldn't be doing
that," said Miller. "The only way to correct that is through surgery. It's coming along good. I have two
more weeks on crutches and then I start my rehab."
  Miller said his rehabilitation will consist of swimming, running in a pool, running in straight lines,
and other light manual exercises.
  Not being able to practice or play with the team makes Miller feel like he doesn't have an identity
with the 1989-1990 Pitt basketball team, that is now 1-4 in the Big East.
  "I really don't feel like I am that much a part of things because I'm not practicing," said Miller. "I'm
still a good part of what's happening as far as the guys, I mean I have some real good friends on the
team. But I would be lying if I said I felt like I was part of the team. I wish I was out there, I think I
could definitely help the cause.
An explanation for Pitt's 1-4 start is that without Miller, the other players had to move to positions
they are not used to.
  "It seems like everyone's just had to bump over and do something they're not used to, and that
takes time. The guys that are doing it are doing a great job." Darelle (Porter) is doing a nice job
playing point. Even Jason (Matthews) has to handle the ball more, and as the season goes on, he'll
get better at that."
Taking over Miller's position at point, Porter is averaging over 7.4 assists per game, leading the
Big East in assists and scoring over 10 points. Last season, Miller averaged just over six assists and
9.7 points per game.
Miller has 361 assists in his two seasons at Pitt, which places him fourth on the all-time list.
Dwayne Wallace holds the Pitt record with 436.
                                                                             - Chris Bosak

  Strong finish leaves Lady
  Panthers +.500 for season
he Pitt women's basketball team complete.
     it's first winning season in five years at th
Big East tournament on March 3, 1990. The Lad
Panthers began the tournament with an 84-7
upset victory over Seton Hall before losing 89.B:
to nationally ranked Providence in Storrs, Co
necticut.
  The Lady Panthers (15-14) finished the seaso:
strong, winning key games to earn sixth place'
the conference. Three of Pitt's losses down th,
stretch came on the road against St. John's (8B
81), in overtime against the Big East's top.
seeded Connecticut (82-80), and to highl
ranked Providence.
  The Lady Panthers began a youth movemer
this season with four freshmen playing majc:
roles. Their performance in the tournament he
sent a message that Pitt may be a contends:
next year.
  "We knew when the season started that wE
had a chance to use at least three freshmen
said Pitt coach Kirk Bruce. The freshmen madec
strong first impression.
  Point guard Maureen McConnell and forwar:
Turia Ransom were named to the Big East al
rookie team.
  McConnell averaged 37 minutes and 9
points a game. She led the team in assists wi,
139.
  Ransom averaged 20.5 minutes a game an:
was second on the team in rebounds (6.7:
game) and field goal percentage (.512).
  "Turia gave us the spark that we needed c:
the bench," said Bruce. "She more than lived;
to our expectations."
  Guard/forward Jill McElhinny, along with Me
Connell, started every game this season. S
had a reputation as a strong defensive playe
when she was recruited, and Coach Bruce'
not hesitate to use her against some of the t0;
point guards in the conference.
  Lisa Fessler came off the bench to average6
points a game. She was noted for her clutr
outside shooting.
  "Lisa came off the bench and had some b.
games for us," said Bruce.

for the
co-captains Lorri Johnson and Jennifer Shingler.
  "Lorri, Jen, and Rita showed leadership," said
Bruce. "Sometimes we needed a push, and they
provided leadership that can be attributed to
their play on the court."
  Shingler finished her Pitt career with 1,081
points and 393 assists. She is sixth on the Pitt alltime scoring list.
  Anderson teamed with Shingler as seniors on
the 1986 Altoona Area High School girls' team
which won the Pennsylvania state championship and was voted USA Today's national
champion. Anderson was fourth on the team in
field goal percentage.
Johnson was named to the second-team AllBig East Conference squad. She scored 1,667
career points, fourth on the all-time Pitt list, and
had 652 career rebounds. She had reconstructive surgery on both knees in 1986, and although
she had a good season, the knees did disrupt
her play.
Johnson was only able to play 28 minutes a
game. When she had to sit, Ransom and Connie
Hurt would fill the role inside. Hurt led the Big
East in blocked shots with 64.
Bruce has already begun work on next year's
freshman class.
Jill Colabrese, a 5-foot-10 guard from Hollidaysburg, and Jonna Huemrich, a 6-foot forward from Bethel Park, have signed letters of
intent to play at Pitt next year.
Colabrese was named to the Altoona Mirror
all-district team. Huemrich was named a National Amateur Athletics Union All-American
and was Most Valuable Player in the National
AAAU tournament.
Shannon Davis is a 6-3 forward from Sacred
Heart High School. She enrolled at Virginia but
was ineligible due to the NCAA's Prop 48 rule.
She has enrolled at Pitt, and will be eligible as a
freshman next year.

                                                         Wrestlers drop final meet of regular season
             T he Pitt wrestling team concluded its regular season with a disappointing 21-18 loss to Franklin and Marshall College on Sunday. The defe
                  dropped the Panthers' final record to 3-12.
               "I was very disappointed with the team performance," said Pitt coach Rande Stottlemyer. "We simply didn't have the intensity we had in othel
             matches, and we don't have the overall talent where we can afford to take teams lightly. We don't have the star-studded lineup where one guy can
             take it easy, and the other guys can carry him."
               Even though the Panthers' overall effort was lethargic, there were some bright spots for Pitt.
               Sophomore Bob Simpson pinned opponent Aaron Svitana at the final buzzer. The victory pushed Simpson's record to 26-12 for the season.
               "I was frustrated the whole match, and I went for the pin before the buzzer," said Simpson. "I was lucky enough to get my opponent in a cradle, and'
             got the fall at the buzzer."
               Another bright spot for the Panthers was the performance of senior Alan Utter, who wrestled the last home match of his Pitt career. Utter dominotec
             the Diplomats' Steve DeRafelo throughout the match, and walked away with an easy 9-1 victory.
               "It was a tough day for the team," said Utter, "but the victory made the day for me. It was my last opportunity to wrestle on the Pitt mat, and I made
             the most of it."
               Coach Stottlemyer also credited Brian Shaffer and heavyweight Joe Conlon with impressive showings.

Swimmers and divers earn prestige
o team has dominated the Big East swimming scene like the Panthers, and for the eighth consecutive year, the Pitt women's swimming and diving
    team has won the Big East championship.
  Here are some quick facts to put the victory into perspective:
  - Pitt swimmers captured nine event championships to match the nine titles won last year.
  -Lady Panther swimmers placed no lower than sixth in any event.
  - Runner-up Villanova's best effort in the 200-backstroke placed them 15th out of 16 swimmers.
  -Pitt's eighth championship ties a Big East conference record for most consecutive conference titles.
  A Pittsburgh sports dynasty continues.
  The four-day event began last Thursday as freshman Donna Flatch won the 1 -meter diving championship en route to capturing the Diver of the Meet
award. Her score of 389.85 was good enough to earn a berth in the NCAA pre-qualifying meet. Syracuse diver Shannon Jerome spoiled a clean-sweep
by the Panthers with a second-place finish. Nicole Bunker, Krissa Ratliff, and Mindy Hennon finished third, fourth, and fifth, respectively, leaving the rest
of the pack far behind.
  Ratliff finished her Big East career in grand style by taking the 3-meter board championship. Her point total of 431.30 was plenty to qualify her for the
NCAA pre-quals. She won with an impressive 15-point cushion. There was a lot of blue on the victory stand as Flach, Bunker, and Hennon finished
second, third, and fourth, respectively. Hennon was in sixth place when the first half of the diving ended, but wound up in fourth place.
  On Friday, the swimming events began. Pitt took their eighth consecutive 200-freestyle relay championship with a time of 1:36.60. Second-place
Boston College finished over a full second behind.
  Pitt expected Villanova to challenge them in the freestyle events, and that is exactly what happened. Theresa Picklo placed second to Mary Dowling
of Villanova's winning time of 4:56.05 in the 500-free. Two-time defending champion Celeste Makiel of Pitt finished a surprising seventh. Jill Comeau
finished fifth with a time of 5:05.74. Clare McShane and Liz Sari placed tenth and twelfth, respectively. It may have been an odd day for Pitt freestyle, as
each swimmer was a few seconds off her best efforts.
  The competition in the 200 individual medley was so tough that Laura-Lee Sullivan'&amp;s winning time of 2:08.07 last year would only have placed her
third this year. As a result, she finished sixth in the final heat. Suzi McManus placed  lth swimming in the consolation heat. Rival Villanova placed
second, third, and fourth.
  Senior Laure Walczak finished her Big East season with a victory in the 50 free. Close times were expected in the sprint events, and Friday's event was
no different. Walczak's winning time of 24.09 was.07 seconds off her personal best, and a victory by only.06 seconds. Crit Gallagher came in ninth, only
.5 seconds off the lead. Senior Sandy Albright posted the 14th best time.
  Pitt captures the 400-medley relay championship and set a new meet record with a time of 3:55.61.
  Saturday's competition began with the 200-medley relay team edging Boston College for the victory. Pitt's time of 1:47.92 is almost a full second faster
than last year's winning time. The Lady Panthers have won the event seven of the last eight years.
  One of the most grueling events is the 400 IM. Swimmer of the Meet Cindi Luciani of Providence became the 1990 400-IM champion with a time of
4:29.08. Pitt's Karen Masal swam to a sixth place finish with a time of 4:38.62. Comeau placed second in the consolation heat and posted the 10th fastest
time in the event. Interestingly, Sullivan and Mary Caspero, who posted Pitt's best times in the event last year, did not compete.
  Villanova only entered one swimmer in the 100 butterfly, and that's all they needed to win. Jenny Miller took the event with a time of 57.84. Julie Rocks
of Pitt finished third, only.24 seconds away from victory. Senior Sandy Albright found a new event in the fly during the Villanova meet earlier this year.
The backstroke specialist showed her versatility with a good swim in the consolation heat. Sophomore Noelle Barry finished sixth.
  Only Providence's Cathy Rich prevented a'Nova sweep of the top three slots in the 200 free. McShane, Pickleo, and Makiel finished fifth, sixth, and
seventh, respectively. In the consolation heat, Gallagher placed second, and Walczak came in third.
  Sullivan kept hold of her 100 breaststroke championship by holding off her own teammate, Masal. The pair are two of the best breaststroke swimmers
in the east and proved it with an impressive 1-2 sweep.
  Ritch of Providence came close to Albright's meet record of 57.88 in the 100 backstroke, but missed by.04 seconds. Albright was nearly three seconds
off her record mark, and pulled off a fourth-place finish. Sophomore Trina Thames, who looks to fill the shoes of the graduating Albright, placed second.
  For most people, the thought of swimming for 18 minutes is enough to make them cough up a lung, but for these exceptional endurance athletes, it's just
another day at the office. Villanova's Mary Dowling won the 1,650 free, but the Lady Panthers showed their depth by finishing ahead of most of the rest
of the swimmers. Comeau, Picklo, and Liz Sari finished third, fourth, and ninth, respectively.
The 200 breaststroke matched the swimmer of the meet against Thames, Pitt's fastest swimmer of late. Luciani of Providence earned her award by
beating the rest of the Big East pack very convincingly. Thames finished second, and Jane Atiyeh placed eighth. Liz Sari, who swam the 1,650 free only
two events ago, came in fourth in the consolation heat and finished 12th overall.
The Lady Panthers will host the Eastern Women's Swimming Championships, which begin in two weeks, hoping that the home water advantage can
bring home the title.

                                      Men win eighth consecutive Big East championship
            T he Pitt men's swimming and diving team achieved their greatest point total ever in winning their eighth consecutive Big East championship every
                 year they have been in the conference.
              Their 872.5 points placed them 224.5 points ahead of second-place Syracuse and 299.5 points ahead of third-place Villanova.
              For the second consecutive year, Mike Kozlina and John Sharkey won the outstanding swimmer and diver awards, respectively. Kozlina finished the
            weekend with five victories. He won the 100 and 200-yard backstroke events, and the 100-yard butterfly. He was also a member of two victorious relay
            teams; the 200-medley with Matt Porter, Fred Constantini, and David Bacharach; and the 400-free with Joe Kozlina, Tim Adams, and Bill Folger. "My
            times were better than last year," said Kozlina.
              Kozlina was happy with the way the team pulled together as the weekend wore on. "The first day was a little shaky, then we got into the groove," he
            said.
              He might have clinched the award by leading a comeback in the 400-free relay, a race in which Pitt had been trailing until he edged out Syracuse by
.14 seconds. "I just held back and felt confident I could get him," said Kozlina.
              Sharkey also improved last year's performance in winning the 1-and 3-meter diving events. "This year was a personal best for me," said Sharkey.
            His score of 561.75 in the 3-meter capped off by a tough dive he had been working on established a meet record.
              "I put the pressure on my last big twister," Sharkey said. "I got a record and a title, and I'm satisfied."
              Mike Naylor, Phil Cruz, and Jay Bordeau, all of Pitt, took second, third, and fourth in both diving events, giving Pitt the top four finishers in each one.
              Pitt finished first in 13 out of 20 events between the eight schools. Other Pitt winners included Matt Weist (100-and 200-breast), Eric Mattson (400-IM),
            and Dave Schepner in the 1,650-free.
              "I think the team did excellent," said Coach Dick Bradshaw. "To win over half the events is something unusual." He said this was a great
            achievement because Syracuse and Connecticut (fourth place) have shown improvement, and Villanova always has a strong team.
              Pitt also won the 200-free relay with Matt Porter, David Bacharach, Fred Constantini, and Eric Cornell; and the 400-medley relay team of Fred
            Constantini, Kevin McLaughlin, Eric Cornell, and Matt Porter.
            The Panthers will be off for three weeks and then compete at the Eastern Seaboard Swimming and Diving Championships at Army. They finished
            fourth last year, and Bradshaw would like to see at least a second place finish this year.
                                                                         - Adam Kamras

                                   Gymnasts prove to be pleasant surprise
At the start of the season, Pitt Coach Frank D'Amico wasn't sure what his team was capable of achieving. He had a group of mostly young,
    inexperienced gymnasts with only one returning senior. He lost two of his top men from the previous year, including Jorge Gonzalez, a two-time
qualifier for nationals on pommel horse. His main goal was to get through the season without any major injuries.
D'Amico accomplished that goal, but he was able to add many others to the list. At the National Independent Championships on Saturday, Pitt scored
a season-high 266.75 points, improving their overall score by 21 points from their first meet in January. That score was the highest D'Amico had seen in
eight years.
"This is the first time I've had a team that's been able to improve that much," D'Amico said. "Generally, you start off slow and pick up speed at the end.
But 21 points, that's a lot."
He is proud of the fact that for the first time he had a team compete in a national meet, and they placed third. But this isn't the only evidence of the
team's improvement this season. D'Amico feels that the most important change he's seen is the improvement of his fourth, fifth, and sixth men.
Before the season, D'Amico knew he could count on senior Pat Pollaci, because of his experience. But by the end of the season, he found the difference
between the first and fifth man in each event was very small. He could rely on their newfound depth to defeat more teams on a national level.
So strong, D'Amico said, that they've begun to push the gymnasts on top.
"At any moment things could change," he said. "In the gym, everyone knew they had to work hard because maybe they wouldn't be competing."
The friendly but serious competition between team members in practice showed up in the meets, as they progressively improved.
D'Amico said the team's success is ironic because this is the first year he doesn't have a standout.
"Last year, we had some good, strong standouts to carry the load, but we didn't score this high."
"In the 14 years I've been here, I've never had a team come this far in one season," he said. "This has been probably the best team I've ever had."

(0-1), said his fall experience should make
him very effective for the spring season.
  The other two Panthers who played singles
were Senior Paul Maben and Junior Jeff Mills,
gaining 2-2 and 1-5 records, respectively.
  In addition to his winning record with
Rosenthal, O'Connor also teamed with Orth
to win a match, making his overall doubles
record 3-1.
  Pitt Coach George Dieffenbach was
pleased with his team's success. "It was a
very good fall season. Everybody has improved and done well academically," he
said.
  Dieffenbach said he will have his team
take a break until just after the new year.
They will then start indoor playing and a
conditioning program that focuses on lifting,
flexibility, and running.

Pitt
Pitcher Fred Iriti gets ready to release a fast bal'
                               Panther baseball team looking for consistency at mid-season
            T he Big East baseball season has reached its midpoint, and the Pitt Panthers are still looking for some degree of consistency.
                   The season began with a 2-4 series of games played in Florida. The team seemed to be ahead in certain areas, such as hitting, and a little
            behind in others, such as defense. For the next 10 games, everything went downhill, and the team slumped to a 3-12 record, marked by a 1-9 stretch.
              Now the team members seem to have found themselves, as evidenced by their victories in three of their last four contests.
              Pitt has beaten Boston College once and Georgetown twice for its first Big East wins in the last two seasons.
              "We started to put it together because we're doing all the little things you need to do to win games," said Pitt Coach Bob Lewis.
              "When you fall behind like we have done this season, the strategy is taken from the game," added Lewis. "The bunting is gone (along with) the
            stealing of a base to move a runner up. The things I enjoy doing to win a ball game are gone. This team needs to be 3-2 or 2-0 games. Close games.
            That is what we have been doing, and we're winning."
              To see why his Panther team loses, look at the error column. In its 13 losses, Pitt committed 45 errors for a 3.4-per-game average. In the Panthers' six
            wins, they have had only 12 errors, averaging only two per game.
              "Inconsistency has been a big disappointment for me," said Lewis. "We'll be going along great in (a game) and suddenly start throwing the ball
            around, committing key errors that have knocked us out of games.
              "That's what happened to Georgetown when we beat them. They had an inning where, for no apparent reason, their defense disappeared. If we
            keep our defensive mistakes to a minimum, then we could win some games."
              In the early part of the season, the Panthers played Seton Hall and Providence, two of the better teams in the conference.
              "I wish we could have played these teams later in the season," said Lewis. "I don't know whether that would have made a difference (in the win
            column), but it definitely would have helped our freshmen to come into the program more easily if they didn't have to face the really tough competition
            first."
              The team has shown promise in its hitting - which has lately proved to be disappointing.
              "We have been better offensively lately because we finally bunched some hits. Against Georgetown, we were able to get five or six runs in an inning
            to really help our confidence," said Lewis. "In the earlier part of the season, we left too many men on base. We'd get people in scoring position, only to
            strike out."
              "We have to take advantage of all the opportunities we get."
              A hitting surprise during the Big East season has been outfielder Greg Trimbur. In the last seven games, he has hit.421, including two doubles and
            three RBI's.
              "Trimbur's hitting has been a pleasant surprise," said Lewis. "We knew he was a solid defensive player, but the hitting has been a surprise."
              Trimbur has committed only one error in the 13 games this season.
              The pitching has been erratic as has the rest of the team. The team ERA in the Big East is 6.24.
              "One of our time out a pitcher will show good stuff and get another opportunity which he won't take advantage of," said Lewis.
              "I'd have to say the pitching has been both a surprise and a disappointment. Just like all the other parts of the team, we have to go out every time and
            play a fundamentally solid game."
              As far as freshmen go, shortstop Ralph McNelly seems to have stepped forward.
              "McNelly has handled the pressure fairly well. The more time he plays, the better he will play," said Lewis.
                                                                          - Ron Ledgard

No matter how you figure, the
Macintosh TM is one of the best
computer values available today.
The classic Macintosh interface has
set the standard for "user riendly. "
Very simply, that means that a Pitt
computer lab, your corporate
accounting office, graphic design
studio, or home office will not be
faced with expensive training on
the Macintosh is half the cost of
other PC systems. The bottom line
is, whether you consider training
and start-up costs to be "hard" or
"soft" dollars, the Macintosh is the
best computer value on the market
today. Stop in and talk to one of
our specialists.

WESLEY POSVAR CONTINUES 

A Cradition of Excellence

 

When University President Wesley Posvar
came to Pitt from an administrative job at the Air
Force Academy in 1967, he brought along his good
friend jach Freeman to serve as his executive
assistant. Freeman still recalls their first day on the
‘ob.
J "We both walhed into his very large 0 ' ,
which is a little diﬁerent now, and he said, Well
jach, how do you run a university?’ I hughed and
said, ‘It beats me.’

"I was just cha ' with him recently and
reminded him about t conversation, and we
decided that we're still trying to answer that ques-
tion, but we agree it's hard because the university is
changing all the time. And nobody really runs a
university, ou just learn how to get the most out of
allthe sta ," said Freeman, who is now executive
vice pres’ nt.

So who is this Wesle Posvar anyway? Freeman
says he is "a very in person with catholic
interests. He is interested in a number of regional
and international affairs: he is not a person with a
narrow focus.”

Scanning his track record, it does appear that
Posvar is as diverse a man as the university that he
heads. Holding many different roles throughout his
65 years, Posvar has accomplished far more than
most eople ever dream of.

Aftrer graduating first in his West Point class of
1946, Posvar went on to become a Rhodes Scholar,
earn a Ph.D. from Harvard, and teach at both West
Point and the Air Force Academy, where he found-
ed the school's political science department and
served as a test pilot.

And in 1967, Posvar stepped into the role he
still holds: chancellor of the University of Pitts-
burgh Now 22 years later, altho h the office's
occupant has remained the same, li else about the
position has. The title has changed from chancellor
to president, and these days the job description is
quite a bit di erent.

"The job become much more complex. The
budget has multiplied probably tenfold, and there-
fore, it's necessary much more now to delegate
power, organize sta and use the latest man-
agement techn' ues,' said Posvar.

But as com ' as it may have become over
the past ew , Posvar’s position is still one
he y enjoys. The chie executive spoke with
an edge of determination w n he said he's not yet
ready to throw in the towel

’ Iplan to staggas long as I'm wanted andas long
as I want to," said, "there is no deadline or set
schedule, and whenever I change positions I will
justwanttodoso ' else’

This hind of ambition comes as no surprise to
Freeman. "He still heeps a schedule that would keep
most eo le exhausted, but he seems to thrive on
that ' of activity. Even after 22 years he still
comes to worlt every day with lots of energy and

ready to go."

As Posvar carries his tenure into the 90's, a
main goal is to see the university gain more
prominence internationally.

"I thinlt the changing nature of the world order is
becoming increasingly apparent and will have a
major impact on the [united States]. This uni-
versity is in a strong position to be a rincipal actor
in the new global age of interdepe nce. Political
barriers have been eliminated, and trade passes
through the whole European system now. That's
going to have a big impact here. International skills
are going to be very important to Americans.”

As well as viewing it key to Pitt's academic
growth in coming years, Posvar also counts in-
ternational connections among the university's
greatest successes of the 80's.

"This may be the most comprehensive and
dramatic growth for an outside observer. We're
involved, one way or another, in a hundred places
abroad and dozens of joint and cooperative pro-
grams. We have over 1,000 international students,
and we have leading centers for international
studies. There are new programs developing all the
time"

Posvar cited ”Chautauqua at Pitt," held in Oc-
tober, as evidence 0 the university's worldwide
recognition. The con erence consisted of more than
200 Soviets coming to Pitt to meet with American
experts and discuss numerous political and social
issues.

While the cam us’ international growth accel-
erates, Posvar sa‘ its expansion here in Oahland is
essentially complete.

”I thinlt that the campus is where we want it to
be. It's about twice as large as when I became
president, and it's become very stable in size. But
we are very deficient in dorrnito space. We have
‘pulans for a major 1,000-bed dormitory which we

pe to start building next year," he said

Throughout the past decade, Posvar has noted
definite changes in the students attending Pitt, both
academically and socially.

"Our applications have gone up steadily, and we
had admissions  up earlier with higher SAT
scores than ever this year," he said. "As for
attitudes, I thinh compared to the 1970's, students
are more serious about their studies and future
careers. Previously there was more concern for
social issues than with the classroom studies. I'm
glad to see the students concerned about their e
roles in society, because that's why they re in
college."

Along with its student image, Posvar feels that
Pitt's image around the country has also improved
in recent years.

"A dozen ears ago we were elected to the
Association 0 American Universities, which is
considered the Top 50 universities in America. I
thinlt one ofthe most pleasing reports is that we've

 
  
  
  
   
  
 
    
 
   
   
  
   
   
  
  

been identified as one of the public Ivy L
institutions. That means we're very highly reg
and yet still havpupublic tuition."

In both past a present times, financial
have caused serious dilemmas. In fact, P
guided the universi through its most crucial
etary crises in the te 1960's, a move thatg 1
him h’ h regard. But problems continue. ‘

"T continuing need to deal with s ‘
sources is still our biggest problem, and tuition
gone up more than we would lilte," he said

Posvar’ s personal life sounds as busy as
pgrlfessional one. He married his high schools

rt, Mildred Miller, who also enjoys a flouris
career. The former o era star now serves as
director of the Pitts urgh Opera Theater.

Posvar’ s diversity also shows through ‘
interests, which include ”designing and b '
buildings, playing tennis, shiing and swim
Mildred and I also lihe to tramp around the
outside our home in the country. I'm very b

Indeed he is. A r receiving a phone
president seems a it antsy. When ashed 
anything he'd lihe to add, Posvar smiles and
”No, not really. I've got the new coach «it
outside." And true to word, ' ht outside the :5
stands who else but Paul Hac tt.
