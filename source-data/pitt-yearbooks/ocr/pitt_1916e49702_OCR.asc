ROBERT EMORY PATTISON WALKER,AEA,
Wilmerding, Pennsylvania.

Private Tutoring.

As quiet as a mouse, but what fearful commotion mice
sometimes do cause. One of the sort that permit the other
fellow to do the advertising while they produce. Lately
has seen fit to take a hand in politics. If he has no more

nerve there than he had in the dissecting room, his precinct
will go dry.

CHARLES WELLER WALTER, ~14),
Rockwood, Pennsylvania.

Greensburg Seminary.
Western University of Pennsylvania.

Dr. McCurdy's able assistant in his hash house on the
fourth ﬂoor. You never see that corn-cob pipe but that
you can ﬁgure Abe is near. Exasperates the boys when he

springs a question on the lecturer just as class is about to
be dismissed.

CLAIR DeWITT WALTERS, \IrQ,
Meadville, Pennsylvania.

Meadville High School.
Chairman Dental Committee Junior Prom.

Still raving about the way the Junior prom proceeds were
divided. One of our most married unmarried class-mates.
Answers to numeruus charming titles, among them being
Doggie, Dutch and Bull, all of which were earned as a
results of valorous achievement. A good worlter once he
gets started.

FRANK P. WALTHOUR, _
Harrison City, Pennsylvania.

McKeesport High School.
Musklngum College.
Class Football 1, 2.

This over-grown specimen of the masculine variety some-
how or other has managed to keep up an average sufficient
to guarantee his remaining in the class. At that we don't
regret it, for Wally is as good-natured as he is big, even if
he didn't malce l00 in physiology, his favorite subject.

JUNIOR
CLASS

EDMUND L. WEIGHTMAN, AEA,
Greensburg, Pennsylvania.

Greensburg Seminary.
Student Constitution Committee.

We now gaze upon the likeness of that distinguished in-
dividual from Greensburg. He is noted as a forceful ex-
pounder of that good old line. Likes a good time as well
as the next one, but knows when to stop and get busy.
There are lots worse fellows than Weightman.

HOWARD RUSSELL WILSON, AEA,
Carnegie, Pennsylvania.

Carnegie High School.

The Carnegie boy of social standing. His good looks
make him a prime favorite among the ladies. Has enough
foresight to keep to his books, however. and his road looks
smooth. Always starting trouble. Wears the smile that
won't come off.

EDGAR GRAHAM BEANE, AEA,
McKees Rocks, Pennsylvania.

Pittsburgh Academy.
Class Football 1, 2.

Where have you "Beans?" Oh, yes; was it good?
Heard Dick say he didn't think much of the chorus. One
of the "typodont" specialists of the class. Takes to class
football games like a ﬁsh to water. A real optimist of an
original type.

THOMAS PURCELL BEATTIE, \IrQ,
Wheeling, West Virginia.

Bellefonte Academy.
Varsity Football 1, 2.
Varsity Baseball 1.
Class Treasurer.

Beattie is perseverence personiﬁed. A chap of merit and
an athlete of ability. Has vocal proclivities also, which he
can commercialize on and, instead of using somnoform for
operating, can "Sing Me to Sleep." Prizes highly his
stand-in with Mr. Judd.

THOMAS C. CRAWFORD, ~14),
Blossburg, Pennsylvania.

Blossburg High School.

The sad part of Tommie} record is the fact that he is
here at college spending his parent's hard-earned money.
ls not the noisest individual in the class by any means.
Hard to understand. but manages to land a girl occasion-
ally. It would be a shame to think less of the girls on this
account.

GABRIEL FRANCIS GURLEY, ~14),
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

St. James College.
Duquesne University.
Class Football 1, 2.
Cap and Gown 1, 2.
Newman Club.

"Cabs" ﬁnds it conducive to his health to enjoy more or
less of a vacation as a daily diet. And dance, he can
show the Castles the back door any time. A promising
youth of many promises. A specialist in comparative anat-
omy, and a prosthetic artist of stellar rank.

CLARENCE SIDNEY HARRIS, ~1/£2,
Verona, Pennsylvania.

Verona High School.

Indiana Normal.

Grove City College.

University of Pittsburgh, Engineering.
Cap and Gown.

Likes Owl write-ups so well he gets another this year
just to be sociable. And this last is the word that em-
phasizes this lad's meanderings. Found where the lights
are brightest eight nights out of the week. A musician of
note. Why the dentistry?

 

ROY HARRISON HEIL, EX, M2,
Topeka, Kansas.

Topeka High School.
University of Kansas.
Varsity Football 1, 2.
Pitt Freshman Baseball.

The 'l6 crew is proud of Pete's record. A noble general
on the football ﬁeld, he is just as noble a student. His
living at the track house for two years don't seem to have
had a very depreciating defect upon him. Hence the
unanimous verdict: "Mentally and morally sound."

JAMES FREDERICK HOOD,
Wilkinsburg, Pennsylvania.

Connellsvllle High School.
Ohio Northern University.

James took his first year in 1907 and then came a grand

vacation until this last fall.

Has not forgotten all he

learned, especially as concerns sledge swinging. His move-
ments resemble a streak of lightning. Convinced that mid-

year exams are a frost.

The Mellon Institute

1

It was on Friday morning, February 26, of this year, that the Messrs. Richard Beatty
Mellon and Andrew William Mellon turned over to Chancellor S. B. McCormick the keys of
Mellon Institute, thereby placing themselves on record as exponents of the newer learning em-
bodied in scientiﬁc research. The grandest ediﬁce of its kind in existence was at that moment
given to Pitt by two of the Nation’s most exemplary citizens.

The Mellon Institute of Industrial Research and School of Speciﬁc Sciences was the out-
growth of the Department of Industrial Research, instituted at the University by Dr. Robert
Kennedy Duncan, now deceased. His purpose was to establish an industrial alliance, and was
known as “The Industrial Fellowship System." In this system an individual or a company con-
tributes to the Institute a deﬁnite sum of money to pay the salary of the man or men who work on
a particular problem, the solution of which is of interest to the donating company and is its ex-
clusive property. The cherished ambition of Dr. Duncan is being most capably carried into execu-
tion by his successor, Dr. Raymond Foss Bacon.

And so it proved the good offices of the Mellon Brothers to erect and equip this vast indus-
trial research laboratory, and present it to the University of Pittsburgh as the seventh building of
the proposed group. -

The new building was designed by Mr.  H. Giesey. It is Doric in style, thereby con-
forming with the other buildings on the Campus. There are five stories, granite being used for the
two lower, and buff brick for the three above. Above the doorway, raised from a bronze slab, is
the following:

‘ll THIS BUILDING IS DEDICATED TO THE SERVICE
OF AMERICAN INDUSTRY, WHICH WILL GIVE TO ALL
BROADER OPPORTUNITIES FOR PURPOSEFUL LIVES.

The first, or_main ﬂoor, contains the assembly hall, the various office rooms, and a dark
room laboratory. The second, third and fourth ﬂoors each contain nineteen spacious research lab-
oratories. There is also provision made for certain kinds of testing in the basement. I-Iere also
is the main storeroom, which is furnished with an installment of steel shelving having a total shelf
surface of 3,200 square feet. There is telephonic communication with each floor of the building.
The library, on the ﬁrst ﬂoor, contains 2,000 volumes, embracing chemistry and technology.
Among the contents of the library are a file of reprints of the contributions of the fellows, a ﬁle of
all patents of the fellows, and a trade catalogue guide. At present more than I,000 catalogues
of 4I5 ﬁrms are on ﬁle. The assembly hall occupies a space of 34 feet by 5| feet. It is provided
with a movable lecture table. A lantern with cinematograph attachment is installed in the
mezzanine floor of the ﬁrst ﬂoor corridor.

To proceed further would become more technical than this record necessitates. Suffice to
say that the Mellon Institute is a masterful structure, destined to do untold wonders for the civilized
world, and bound to bring honor and fame to the University, and last, but not least, to its favored
donors.

WILLIAM FOSTER TRIMBLE,

Bellevue High School.

After hearing stories of Chicago from Red and Bob, he
’clecided to go and do likewise.

 

HYMEN LOUIS ABRAMOVITZ,
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

Central High School.
Chemical Society.

Physically he is a wonder, mentally he is abnormal. and

JOHN R. ALLISON, A211,

WILLIAM KARL BENZ, ATA,
Greensburg, Pennsylvania.

Greensburg High School.

A slow, easy-going chap with all the appearances of a

ENGINEERING
SCHOOL

MAURICE A. BENNETT,
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

Farrell High School.

He will be a wonder if his ravenous hunger for knowl-
edge is retained through any length of time. He simply
devours a book. No doubt this is because he ﬁnds it more
proﬁtable in the long run. At any rate, experience is a
good teacher.

CONRAD HENRY CHECCO,
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

Pittsburgh High School.
American Institute of Electrical Engineers.

Conrad is contented only when his marks are of the
superlative order. A “D" to him is the same thing as a
failure, and it nearly breaks his heart. As a result he is
a worker.

WILLIAM ADDISON COOK,
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

Pittsburgh Academy.
Musical Club 3.

One of those fellows who would rather be led than lead.
and at times presses close with a sudden spurt of energy.
Psychologically he is not to be censured.

HARVEY J. DIBLE, Verona, Pennsylvania.

Verona. High School.
Cap and Gown Club 1.

Dible is one of those fellows who have not acquired the
American sense of humor, and is quite content in passing
out sweet, unsarcastic words. Would not hurt anyone's feel-
ings for the world. Even Dean Bishop says he is all right
and has often played with him the entire physics hour.

( J

JUNIOR
CLAss

JOHN HARPER DODDS, EBE,
Kittanning, Pennsylvania.

Klttanning High School.

Dodds is famed as being Garrett's "buddy." When you
see one of them you can safely bet your best suit that the
other is in calling distance. it will be indeed disappointing
if Dodds and Garrett are not the controllers of a big com-
pany some day.

STANLEY D. EDSALL,
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
Central High School.

Cap and Gown Club 1.
Assistant Manager Track Team.

One of the heart-breakers of the class. Not only adored
by the fair sex. but by all who know him. A neat, clean-
cut chap, with all the appearances of a lady; a clear high
voice, but hold! he is not a lady, but a man with manly
characteristics.

FLOYD ALFRED FRANKLIN,
Munhall, Pennsylvania.

Munhail High School.
Carnegie Tech.
Musical Clubs 1, 2, 3.

Another heart-breaker from Munhall. How does he do
it? By that oriole voice? A high mark student with
plenty of time for social functions. Specializes on hitting
the high ones, musically considered and otherwise.

CHAUNCEY OSCAR FRANKLIN, <I>ZN,
Munhall, Pennsylvania.

Munhall High School.
American Institute of Electrical Engineers.

The only man who ever passed Minerology honestly. At
least he didn't admit it if he didn't and his veracity is not
doubted for he is some student. There are lots worse stu-
dents than Chauncey.

ENGINEERING

EDWARD VOLIN GARRETT,
Rockville, Maryland.

Montgomery County, Maryland, High School.

Father of the Engineering class of l9l6 and truly he
deserves the honor if it is an honor. He sails along ap-
parently without diﬂiculty, but always willing to stop and
help the other fellow. He is bound to make good and we
all wish him well.

MANUEL EDGAR GOLDBERG,
McKeesport, Pennsylvania.

’ McKeesport High School.

Another one of those fellows who usually gets the heart
out of most things in common with him.’ Even an "A" is
not beyond him when he makes up his mind to have it.

HARRY HARTZ, Millvale, Pennsylvania.
Millvale High School.

Quiet easy-going chap; says little, listens little, worlrs
little; in fact to him anything but nothing is absolutely
foolish. ls he a day dreamer? You wouldn't think so if
you ever saw him hit a baseball. To us and the Profs. he
is an insoluble puzzle.

RALPH B. HORNER, EAE,
Wilkinsburg, Pennyslvania.

Wllkinsburg High School.
Class Baseball.
Student Senate.

"Jack" hails from the holy city. and truly is a good rep-
resentative. One of our honorable senators. A good scout
with a heart-breaking personality.

ROBERT TELLMAN JOHNSON,

Munhall High School.

American Institute of Electrical Engineers.

If you want to know anything about the fair ones of
Munhall ask Johnson. He's a "bearcat" with the ladies.

EWING LESLIE JOHNSON,
Wilkinsburg, Pennsylvania.

Wilkinsburg High School.

One of those chaps with a personality that you don't
forget in a day or two. Just such fellows as he have made
Fords famous. Of course we don't wish upon him any
such lousy job.

GEORGE M. KRATZERT,
Woodlawn, Pennsylvania.

Sharon High School.

Rayen High School;

Beaver High School.

American Institute of Electrical Engineers.

A good fellow and a plugger from the word go. and
usually ﬁnishes close up to the lead. It strikes us that he
makes good use of his time at every turn and not the worst
in the land should prove his lot.

EARL FRANK LANSINGER, ATA,
Kent, Ohio.

Brlmﬂeld High School.
Senate 1, 2.

In his ﬁrst and second years he was one of the most
active men of the class,but now he is looking after number
one and is one of our high-marl: students. At that, that's
the main thing in the end. so here's to Lansinger.

Without a doubt he is the most popular Jew in our
class. You simply can't make him sore. Do what you will
and you get a smile in return. We wish this short ham-
mered-down Jew the best luck in the world.

PAUL EMERY MEYERS, <I>Z<I>,
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

Carnegie Tech.
Glee Club 1, 2.

A regular at most of the classy dansants. A member of
the "Heart Breal(ers' Club." Work is his last thought,
but nevertheless he gels there. How he does it will be ex-
plained in "our next."

FRANK ALBERT MESTA, ATA,
Finleyville, Pennsylvania.

Peters Township High School.
Secretary Mechanical Engineering Society.

A year frcm now and another variety will be added lo
the Mesta Machine Company, so Frank should worry.
However, he is always on the job and is a regular student.
The chances are he will revolutionize machinery methods
when he gets out.

CHARLES McKNIGHT, JR., <i>Z<I>,
Sewickley, Pennsylvania.

Lawrenceviiie, New Jersey, High School.

Don't judge a man by the car he drives, nor by face
decorations. for surely by this gent you will be badly fooled.
Makes it a point to burn up the asphalt when class hour
draws near. A good idea for some others.

ELMER PA_NNER, A2111,
Rochester, Pennsylvania.

Peabody High School.
Engineering Editor 1916 Owl.

The Engineering department in THE OWL came near
dying a natural death, in fact the ﬂowers had already been
ordered. but Panner came back in a hurry from his Winter
term co-op work and saved the day.

"At that it might have been just as well.
For what he wrote sounds like—chapel singing."

GEORGE RAYMOND PATTERSON,
' Barnesville, Ohio.

Barnesvilie High School.
Carnegie Tech.
American Institute of Electrical Engineering.

Pat has not been with us long, but it doesn't take long
for a fellow like him to make an impression. He never
complains but seems to plug away untiringly.

DONALD LAING SOMMERVILLE,
Crafton, Pennsylvania.

Shady Side Academy.

"Don" is a lover of work and nothing» is too big for
him. Dr. Bishop explains this by saying that Don is an
engineer by heredity, his father, his father's father, and his
father's father's father and, goodness knows. how many
more were engineers.

it is said that he walks home from downtown for exer-

But "It's a Long Way to Tipperary," Wilber.

DANIEL J. SULLIVAN,
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

Pittsburgh High School.
Carnegie Tech.

One of the’few students who knows when to work and
when to play. From 8:30 to sunset you will ﬁnd him plug-
ging away, but soon as night comes you can ﬁnd him at
some "nickle-a-shot-hop" if you look at the right one.

JEROME ARNOLD SWEET,
New Kensington, Pennsylvania.

New Kenslngton High School.
Class Football and Basketball.
Swimming Team, Captain 3.

Captain of the swimming team. a regular student. sweet
on the fair ones, especially in his home town. Has a com-
plete knowledge of every scratch on the ﬂoor of the swim-
ming pool. He's a good fellow to have around.

JOHN MUELLER THORNE,

Shady Side Academy.

Vice President Musical Clubs 3.

A ﬁrm believer in the conservation of energy, Thorne
ﬁnds it less diﬂicult to listen than to stir up the noise. Can
make all sorts of pretty sounds and this is not forgetting
the good old book noise, either.

CHARLES WILDERMAN TRIGG,
Baltimore, Maryland.

Baltimore Polytechnic Institute.
Chemical Society.

He has not been long in our midst, but long enough to
prove that he is one of us all the way. That sounds good,
and changes our mind concerning Marylanders, being con-
vincing evidence that they are not all lobsters around Balti-
more.

JAMES C. WEBSTER, <I>ZN,
Washington, D. C.

Armstrong Tech High School.
American Institute of Electric Engineers.

He's a shark in his studies. Absolutely impossible to
deny him an argument on engineering, for he has the
real "dope" and knows when and how to use it. Big
things are expected of Webster in the sweet bye and bye.

ROBERT LEE WHARTON,
St. Louis, Missouri.

Yeatman High School.
Chemical Society.

Lee is a mighty good representative of the "Show Me
State." His youthful innocence of three years ago has
slowly evolved to the smoking of a pipe—. Quite true, he
may want to send one of these books home. in chemistry

he is there——but, oh, that Math. l0.

JOHN BASEMAN WILLIAMSON, EX,
Cumberland, Maryland.

Allegheny County Academy.
Manager Freshman Baseball 2.
Varsity Baseball 3.

Pseudopian Club.

Johnny is the classy little fellow of the school, but he
doesn't sit around to be admired, for he is one of the most
active members of the class. A dashing fellow with the
ladies, a side line at which he is a winner.

WINTHROP MYERS ALLEN, EX,
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

Shady Side Academy.
Student Senate 2.

Allen, better known as "Win," has the record of getting

The "donor" of the baseballs for the class games last
summer. All we ask is a little time and we shall be able
to pay for them. Wolf has the right spirit at that. and we
can stand for a lot from him.

DAVID FRANKLIN ZIMMERS,
Altoona, Pennsylvania.

Altoona High School.
University of Pennsylvania.

Although only a new man in the class, we feel that we
already know him. He is up on all the ﬁne points, but does
not make an undue public demonstration of everything he
knows. That's to his credit, at least. Knew where to come
when he began to look around for a good school.

E. E. BARTLETT, Sapulta, Oklahoma.
Oklahoma State College, B.S.

Little is known of this gent other than that he is an
ardent worker in the Mellon Institute, where he is destined
to go on record as a famous scientist some day.

JAMES R. DAUGHERTY,
Jeannette, Pennsylvania.

Grove City College.

You see he left Grove City to come to Pitt. He is the
third member of the family here at present and he. brought
the horrible news that there are two more on the road.

PHILIP OUDRY-DAVIS, <I>Z<I>,
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

University of Pittsburgh, Ex. ’13.

Phil, commonly known as “Pod," is only six-feet-three,
and at times looks down on the rest of us. Take a look at
his profile, study it carefully, and then form your own
opinion. For my part, I think he is a mighty good scout.

LYMAN C. DUERR,
Tarentum, Pennsylvania.

Tarentum High School.
Track Squad 2.

He deserves a lot of credit for his track work. Not as
noisy as some other folks we happen to know of, but still
capable of standing up for his rights when occasion happens
to demand.

ROBERT H. EVANS,
Wilkinsburg, Pennsylvania.
Wilkinsburg High.
Bob came into our class because he liked it, not because
he disliked the class of ﬁfteen. In other words, like the

famous Mark Anthony: "Not that he loved '15 less, but
he loved 'l6 more." And we are all glad to have him, too.

WILLIAM SMITH, Waynesburg, Pennsylvania.

Serious at all times. Even the sober statues in Pitt's

wonderful Hall of Fame fairly brink in amazement when
they realize that their abject silence is challenged.

LAWRENCE A. RIDDELL,
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

Pittsburgh Central High.

A mighty good student even if he doesn't look it. Riddell
has some sort of private secret concerning where the cap
of wisdom is stored, but so long as he uses its contents
wisely we have naught to complain.

HARRY RAYMOND KIRK, ATA,
Greensburg, Pennsylvania.

Greensburg High School.
Cap and Gown 1.

Harry is one of the undiscovered baseball players of the
school. His disposition probably accounts for his obscurity.
Great things are expected of him and his "pal" Benz in the
electrical world. Ask him about the Creensburg girls.

GEORGE R. GRAHAM, EAE,
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

Allegheny High.
Basketball 1, 2, 3, 4.
Baseball 1, 2.

"Babe" is one of our athletic heroes and we are proud
of him. When a little help of the right sort was needed on
the basketball floor, the little fellow always came through
with a big boost. Another boost for that theory that "good
goods are done up in small parcels."

Chan likes himself. But this is excusable in him, be-
cause nearly everybody likes him. A good talker, clever
entertainer and delightful host. He is sure to be missed
when he graduates.

This Flood is quite a deluge. Is said to be working his

a large assortment of nec_kties, but is a very popular and

likeable fellow.

FREDERICK ARTHUR JOHNSON,
Ben Avon, Pennsylvania.

New Castle High School.

Rides a motorcycle to increase the consumption of gaso-
line, thereby increasing production of oil and thus causing
a greater demand for his services. A hard worker, sweet
dancer and gentle rough neck.

YE BEH LIENG, Changsha, China.

The vision of the past. Jerry was the hoodoo of the

BAERIN Y LONG, Lzechin, China.

Long has one of those sweet dispositions that are com-

Jornson to the undertaker last year.

GEORGE WASHINGTON MYERS,
Lancaster, Pennsylvania.

First Pennsylvania Normal School.
Manager 1914 Owl.

Old Honesty Myers (not soap) is renowned for the
breadth of his smile and the length of his hair. Myers is
an undesirable in the Mining School because he always
knows his lessons. Never llunked anything.

HAGOP S. PAPERTSIAN,
Trebizond, Turkey in Asia.

Anatolia College, Turkey.
Wisconsin School of Mines.

is said to be a Turk. We know him to be a good fellow
and student. But why did he run from the Turkish police-
man? Also, is bigamy a crime in Turkey?

MYER SALZKOTTER WASSERMAN,
Nashville, Tennessee.

Nashville High School.

Wassy is the original breeze of spring. He is knowledge
personified. Can readily tell the diﬁerence between a mine
mule and an underground motor because he also takes E. E.

Mines Manager 1916 Owl.

He had a terrible time picking out the best picture from
among his proofs—but here he is, girls—gather around.
Ban is certainly one classy boy, but he is so sure of the
fact that he refuses to take himself or aynone else seri-
ously. Is one of the bright lights in the school and is more
popular with the gang than with the profs.

JOHN HARRISON CLEMEN’l‘S, 21>,
Greensburg, Pennsylvania.

Greensburg High School.
Carnegie Institute of Technology .

Clem knows a lot about everything. If you don't believe
us, ask him. Modestly and blushingly, but none the less
frankly he will admit it. He really is a good metallurgist
and has a deep knowledge of economic conditions, having

Tacks is a wonder on defense, but his offense is poor,

He is one of the best all-around men in the school, but that

Pitt—Full of Promise

On September 28th, 1914, the University of Pittsburgh en-
tered upon its one hundred and twenty-eighth year of existence
with a total enrollment of 3,l 56, and up to the first of April, l9| 5,
the enrollment had mounted to the unprecedented ﬁgure of 3,535,
including 350 extension students. This remarkable increase over
the attendance of the year prior, when it was 2,830, permitted Pitt
to take rank as the sixteenth largest University in the United States.

It is a matter of fact that the University of Pittsburgh is the
oldest institution of learning west of the Alleghanies, save the Uni-
versity of Nashville. Dating back to I787 when the Pittsburgh
Academy was incorporated, classes were conducted under the new
grant until I819, when a second charter was approved by the
Legislature, re-incorporating the Academy as the Western Uni-
versity of Pennsylvania. The College existed as the sole school
until I892, when the Engineering and Professional Schools were
organized. In I908 the name was changed to the University of
Pittsburgh, and the organization of the University completed to

include:

The College.

The Graduate School.

The School of Engineering.
The School of Mines.

The School of Economics.
The School of Education.
The School of Law.

The School of Medicine.
The School of Dentistry.
I0. The School of Pharmacy.

I I. The School of Astronomy (Allegheny Observatory).

In l9l0 the Department of Industrial Research was estab-

.\°9°.\'.°‘.U‘:l>.W!\>.-‘

Research.

Fifth Avenue High School.

A very noisy young chap for his size. Philip should
make quite an orator—his only diﬂiculty is that he gets
twisted when he tries to use big words. He has a habit of
resting his lower lip on his chin when listening to a lecture.

THOMAS W. EMERY,
Grove City, Pennsylvania.

Grove City High School.

One of the few woman-haters in the class and a strict
temperance man. He should have considerable money
stowed away somewhere without these two principal drains
on his ﬁnances.

HERMAN F. FEICK, Kxlr,
Avalon, Pennsylvania.

Avalon High School.

Being reared in the village of Avalon, Feick has much
to learn of the wiles and temptations of the city. Everyone
thinks a lot of him, however, and will lend their untiring
efforts to steer him in the straight and narrow path.

EDWIN W. GAMBLE, Butler, Pennsylvania.
B_ut1er High School.

The sport of the class. He is always dressed in the
season's very latest. He is known as the fashion plate.
When the boys are going out to Thuma's or to a formal
ball. they always go to him to ﬁnd out the proper style of
dress to wear.

JUNIOR
CLASS

THOMAS F. GRIEFF, K\Ir,
Emlenton, Pennsylvania.

Emlenton High School.
Grove City College.

Tom thinks it quite a joke to drop a gallon bottle of
ammonia in chemistry lab. Mary Garden or H25 are
alright, but the line is drawn on ammonia. We happened
to know that the hospital was ﬁlled, or Tom might have
had a chance to visit it.

HERBERT W. GROVER,
McKeesport, Pennsylvania.

McKeesport High School.
Carnegie Tech.

Herb seems to be aﬂlicted with clropsy for whenever he
spies a chair he drops into it. At that he is a pretty good
sort of a fellow.

JAMES A. HARGREAVES, d>AX,
Johnstown, Pennsylvania.

Johnstown High School.
The world thinks little of those who think themselves

famous. Jim needs to forget himself and try studying for
a while.

JAMES R. HERSHBERGER,
J ohnstown, Pennsylvania.

Bellefonte High School.
Pennsylvania State College.

Hersh is a fellow one cannot help liking. Very sociable,
intelligent, and an interesting story teller. He will surely
make a success in business.

Mt. Washington _Instltute.

Algie is a very handsome young chap and takes a great
delight in kidding the girls. He is very sociable at times.
Thinks he is funny. Others don't.

MRS. MURIEL HOLMAN,
Parnassus, Pennsylvania.

Linesvllle High School.
A very capable student. Now that she is married she

has decided to settle down to work. She is succeeding very
well, as her marks will show.

HARRY R. HUMPHRIES, K\Ir,
Scottdale, Pennsylvania.

Scottdale High School.
Pennsylvania State College.
Pharmacy Athletic Representative.

Harry is studious, practical and congenial—-—-the sort of a
fellow who deserves to_ succeed and will succeed. He is
not adverse to the fair ones.

NATHAN ITSCOVITZ,
McKeesport, Pennsylvania.

McKeesport High School.

“ltsy" has the happy’ faculty of mixing the ladies with
his studies without slighting either. He undoubtedly makes
too much noise for his size.

JUNIOR
CLASS

BERNARD A. KALSTONE,
McKeesport, Pennsylvania.

McKeesport Hlgh School.

"Berny" worried himself through McKeesport in order to
attend Pitt. He is gelling along fine. contrary to first in-
dications.

FLOYD F. KING, K‘II,
New Behtlehem, Pennsylvania.
New Bethlehem High School.
Floyd has the badly conceived idea that every girl he
meets falls in love with him. He needs sympathy, for it is

indeed disappointing that he displays his ignorance in such
a crude manner.

MICHAEL J. KOLCUM,
Rankin, Pennsylvania.

North Braddock High School.

Mike has forsaken the world for pharmacy and he seems
to enjoy it. It is reported he missed one word in a lecture
last fall, but that is not credited by his neighbors. A jolly
fellow when his mind is unoccupied.

FRANCIS C. KNEPPER,
Berlin, Pennsylvania.

Berlln High School.

A big husky individual who thinks himself a pugilist;
little fellows like Prescott and Davis are the only ones he
experiments with, however. It appears to those in position
to know that he needs quite a bit of training.

ADAM R. LANG, K~I/,
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

Peabody High School.
Student Band.

It is in no way to our liking to state that "Ad" has a
bad case of enlarged "craniumitis," but he surely does imag-
ine he is some pool player. All he does is brag about it;
his playing would indicate the reverse. He loves the women.

CHARLES V. LANGE,
McKeesport, Pennsylvania.
McKeesport High School.
The real thing on the farm, but an awful creation to End
itself meandering up and down Fifth Avenue——especially

since the brush has appeared on his upper lip. He is the
impersonation of a typical rube.

CHARLES C. LING, ‘FAX,
Windber, Pennsylvania.
Windber High School.
Charlie is just as sweet as a peach and such pretty eyes!
Said to be a "lady-killer," but never seen in action. When

the lad wrinkles his nose he is laughing—remember that.
And mind, he gets real mad sometimes.

ALBERT J. SIMENDINGER,
Brisbin, Pennsylvania.

Niagara University.

"Was that a horse neighing?" "No, it was Simmy laugh-
ing." Has a laugh that causes a snicker to escape from
every member of the class. Laying jokes aside, however,
he is a very capable student.

JUNIOR
CLASS

THEODORE T. LINN, K\II,
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

Pittsburgh High School.

Teddy is some orator. His speciality is to let loose with
a monologue when a very interesting lecture is being de-
livered. He has often been given the privilege of having
his say, but when up before the class he seems to lose his
voice.

EDWARD A. MILES, cmx,

Johnstown, Pennsylvania.

Johnstown High School.
Pharmacy Elector 1916 Owl.

Here is quite a jovial little fellow, full of humor and fun.
Whenever you see a group assembled in the smoking room.
you are sure to find Miles in the center. telling some jokes
originated by Noah on the ark, and which he thinks are
decidedly clever. =

GEORGE E. MOORE,
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

Peabody High School.

George has the opinion that he is a shark in Materia
Medica. There is no reason why his head should swell.
for he alone is the only one of that impression. Studying
would do him worlds of good.

SAMUEL R. MORGAN,
Beaver, Pennsylvania.

Beaver High School.

Sam is a regular walking advertisement for the Quaker
Oats Company. He was raised on Mellen's food and hay,
and is a healthy though rather tired proposition. His smile
has been frequently found to be an eflectual anesthetic.

MRS. ELLA P. MYERS,

Storer College.

Can be distinguished by her wisdom. It would seem as
it she would succeed in almost anything undertaken, as
there isn't a single study which seems to mystify her. She
has the wishes of the entire crew for her success.

VANCE ROBERT MCBANE,
East Liverpool, Ohio.

East Liverpool High School.

Vance has the happy faculty of believing that lab.
periods are only creations of the powers that be, and acts
accordingly. Don't know whether he's in love or too busy
otherwise. but school seems the least of his worries.

GLENDON E. MCNARY, rI>AX,

East Washington High School.
Pharmacy Business Manager 1916 Owl.

Mac. must be given credit for getting to school at least
once in a while on time. He is somewhat of a shark in
microscopy. Can distinguish parenchyma from stone with-
out the slightest hesitancy. _"

CARL J. NELSON, -
Glen Campbell, Pennsylvania. .

Glen Carnpbell High School.
Carl is in earnest when he speaks. That's about all that

can be said for him, unless you add that he is a typical
home product. But "a prophet is without honor in his own

country.

JUNIOR
CLASS

JULIAN T. NICKUM, K~Ir,
Ellwood City, Pennsylvania.

Ellwood City High School.

This fellow has a world-wide reputation for inquisitive-
ness. Only his dislike for work can keep him from taking
highest honors. A very congenial sort of an individual.

CURTIS S. OLIVER,
Oriskany Falls, New York.

Oriskany Falls High School.

Here is a truly monstrous subject—something over nine
feet in height, with a girl's complexion, a man's voice and a
horse's laugh. His chief diﬂiculties are found in kissing the
girls and stepping over the Fricl: building. both of which
have been eliminated by the use of an ingenious pocket
stepladcler.

KARL L. OTTO, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
Brushton High School.

Otto often goes to sleep in lectures, and why? He has
a girl. Don't know her name, but she must be 0. K. to
keep the poor boy in such a state of somnolency. It might
be well for them to start saying good night at 9 P. M..
instead of l0, for then he would be sure to leave her at
midnight. and thus enable him to get more sleep.

WILLIAM W. POUNDSTONE,
Charleroi, Pennsylvania.

Charlerol High School.

Bill has the reputation of being one of the best fellows
around school. He takes supreme delight in the gentle art
of rough-house. A good man to consult when you are
trying to pull off an election.

CHARLES R. RINEHART,

Greenﬁeld High School.
Carnegie Institute of Technology.

"Riny" is a star in chemistry quiz. Always ready to
answer any question that may arise, he stands in well with
the quiz-master. His ability to imbibe the good, old-fash-
ioned learning is envied.

MURELL D. ROBERTSON,
Homer City, Pennsylvania.

Homer City High School.
Indiana State Normal School.

Murell considers himself as being one of the few really
bright men of the class. When you want to know some-
thing, ask Murell. If he does not know he will endeavor
to make you think he does.

GROVER C. RUOFF, Ruﬁsdale, Pennsylvania.

Mendon Normal School.

A very dry chap—natural that he should be, for he says
he was a school teacher four years. Specializes in chem-
istry and cigarettes—each alternating with other for su-
premacy.

JOHN R. SANTOS, San Louis, Cuba.

St. Gabriel's College, Cuba.
Virginia College, Washington, D. C.

Santos is quiet and reserved and was never known to
crack a smile. Not shy, however. Demanded a written
guarantee that he would get a good write-up before paying
his OWL assessment. Lots of men have made money who
were less crafty than Santos.

EUGENE M. SHAFFER, Kxlr,
Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania.

Punxsutawney High School.

Another chap from the home of the ground-hog. Like
Davis, he kept hitting the high spots until we started talk-
ing to him like a father, and it seems as though it brought
him to his senses. "Shafe" is a pretty good fellow.

RALPH G. SCHORR, Duquesne, Pennsylvania.
Duquesne High School.

When Schorr first came to Pitt, he was very shy, with
the emphasis on the “very," but he is training down in line
shape now. His jaws are constantly in motion——he likes
“Spearmint."

LLOYD F. SCOTT, <I>AX,
Washington, Pennsylvania.

Washington High School.
Washington and Jefferson Academy.

Slides around school like a gum-shoe detective. Few
see him, let alone become acquainted with him. Was a
sensation in physics when awake (he wasn't a sensation very
often). A tip-top fellow.

HERBERT J. SEIBERT,
Millville, Pennsylvania.

Millville High School.

Seibert is the quiet observer of the |9l6 combination.
Occasionally is mistaken for a member of the faculty. A
model young man except for the fact that he likes to blow
rings.

HAROLD M. SHELDON, K\Ir,

Hughesvllle High School.
Class President.
Student Band.

Here is where the old saying, "A rolling stone gathers
no moss," rings true again. It seems almost impossible for
"Skip" to settle down. As President of the class he is
"right there," as he has lots of life, and is always planning
some amusement for his class-mates.

E. BLAINE SMATHERS,
Oakmont, Pennsylvania.

Smathers is only an occasional visitor, due to the fact
that he is well enough acquainted with most of the dope
to give it the merry go-by while the rest of us have to
plug it out. A sensible sort of fellow with a big future

before him.

JOHN D. SMITH, Ebensburg, Pennsylvania.

Elsensburg High School.
Bethlehem Preparatory School.

"The Wild Man." At least that is what he thinks him-
self, but others hold that he is quite gentle and docile. John
already possesses a marked professional appearance and
carriage.

CHARLES R. SMITH,
Brackenridge, Pennsylvania.

Tarentum High School.

Yes, Smith has a reason for everything. If he hasn't, he
says so, and more than that, he wants to know the other
fellow's reason, despite the fact that he won't give in.
Truly these are admirable trails for a pharmacist.

DAVID R. STABLER, <I>AX,

A village cut-up. Davie is said to spend much of his
time exploring the City of Pittsburgh. Changes his address

when rent comes due. Such is life in a big city. He will
be glad when the end comes.

ALBERT J. STAUFF, JR., K~1r,
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

Ralston High School.

Everything comes to those who hustle while they wait.
According to this, there is not much coming to Stauli. He
seems to answer the bill as being "laziness personiﬁed. A
burner of midnight oil (when someone else is furnishing it).

 

EDWARD G. WAMBAUGH,
Wilkinsburg, Pennsylvania.

Duquesne University.

A hard student, an accommodating class-mate, but ridic-
ulously supercilious at times. He is improving steadily.
however, judging from a more intimate acquaintance with
him. He is not the worst sort that has to be dealt with.

JUSTIN R. WEBBER,
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

Central High School.
Fitth Avenue High School.

His misplaced eyebrow does not credit Justin with having
brains—in fact. it seems obvious that if he would take it
oﬁ, it would display his gray matter in a more favorable
light. Famed for his habitual cuts from chemistry lab.

hours of sleep the night before. Edison and he do not
agree on this subject. A rabid temperance worlcer  '
GEORGE G. WILLIAMS, A<I>A, ;
Tyrone, Pennsylvania.
Tyrone High School.
Howard and Lincoln University.
George surely is a puzzle to the class——says he thinks
microscopy a very interesting study; it is hard to ﬁnd any-
one else of the same opinion. Very fond of kidding people
who are not as witty as himself—they are also very diﬂicult
to find. _ ;,
PAUL M. WILLIAMS, 3
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
Pittsburgh Academy. -
Chemical Club.
All the boys have their share of fun with Charley. His
actions so much resemble those of Charley Chaplin that he
let him have the honor of being called by Chaplin's first
name. Of all the nuts in the class, Charley is the nuttiest.
HENRY L. WIECYORKOWSKI, ;

East Pittsburg, Pennsylvania.
Polish National Alliance College.

"No. 7|" is a very interesting student-—-really hopes to be
the owner of an up-to-date drug store some day in some
large city. The best part of him is his last name. Dili-
gently plugs away, and it is a mystery what he accomplishes.

PHARMACY
SCHOOL

JEROME C. ALBERT, Latrobe, Pennsylvania.
Latrobe High School.

One of the most studious men in the class. Jerry says
he can detect counterfeit money at first sight. With such
an accomplishment as this, there is no reason why he should
not be a successful business man. We wish him luck.

JOSEPH B. ALTMEYER,
Johnstown, Pennsylvania.

Rowe College.

Joe has demonstrated that he is a very persistent pupil.
He is always willing to start an argument, but never ab‘.e
to ﬁnish it. We think him quite a shark in lab., however,
as he is always one of the first ones to leave it.

NEWTON W. ANDERSON,
McKeesport, Pennsylvania.

Pittsburgh Academy.

Anderson is a possessorof good looks and a sunny dis-
position. They say Andy is a big favorite among the
women. Why shouldn't he be? He has all the qualities
necessary to make it possible.

JOHN RAYMOND ASHCOM, <IrAX,
New Florence, Pennsylvania.
New Florence High School,

Rowe College.
Bolivar Academy.

As far as he has demonstrated, it appears that Ash's
character is of the best. He always has a pleasant word for
everyone and is a favorite with every member of the class.

JOHN J. BAUER, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
St. Marys High School.

Here is a very studious sort of a creation—~—keeps the
faculty busy answering questions that do not even concern
his college work. His worst difficulty lies in the fact that
he cannot understand why silver cannot be magnetized.

ADOLPH M. BERKOWITZ,
McKees Rocks, Pennsylvania.

Union High School.

Adolph imagines he is a hard guy just because he comes
from McKees Rocks. but when a light is in sight, he’is
either out for a walk or at lunch. It stands to his credit
that he is quite a shark in chemistry lab.

DAVID BUSIS, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

Intercollegiate Socialist Society.

When it comes to telling you anything not in Webster's

bright young lad and always willing to learn more. A
shark in Materia Medica.

PAUL S. BYRNE, K~I/, Butler, Pennsylvania.

Butler High School.
Ohio Northern University.
Junior Prom Committee.

Paul is an all around good fellow. He is always fin-
ished up with his work, and yet is quite a ladies‘ man. Has
one bad fault, and that is, he eats too much occasionally
and then wonders why he feels ill.

WILLIAM H. CASSELL,
Grafton, West Virginia.

Grafton High School.

Bill has gotten thus far in school with less talk than any
other man in the class. it stands to reason that he either
knows the stuff or he is not sure of his "line." Take notice,
some of you fellows, and do likewise.

WALTER H. C. CHILDS, JR.,
McKeesport, Pennsylvania.

McKeesport High School.

Walt is a very intellectual individual, and, though young,
has made a line record for himself in exhausting the public
school courses in his home city. He is on time every once
in a while. Hates to dissect plants. Spends most of his
time sharpening his instruments.

GEORGE C. CHINTALA,
Duquesne, Pennsylvania.

Duquesne High School.

George has funny ideas about certain matters, but even
if his father does own a distillery, he is no better than any-
one else. With all his faults, he isn't to be harshly judged,
for he is quite a fun-maker.

JOHN M. CONWAY,
Red Lodge, Montana.

Morris, Pennsylvania, High School.

To come all the way from Montana to attend Pitt leads
us to believe that John uses his best judgment in a very
creditable manner. Quite a congenial fellow, but is "all for

Coming from the village of the ground-hog, Barney rolled
into Pittsburgh and immediately fell in love with the beauti-

Barney were a bit lighter on his feet, he might in time attain
his ambition of being an artist on the waxed ﬂoor.

ROBERT L. FOWLER, Kxlr,
Altoona, Pennsylvania.

Altoona High School.

it is a great temptation to call Bob a pest in chemical
lab., for he is as bad as Davis about pouring water in
other people's pockets. If he don't cease his foolishness, the
sad strains of “Near My God to Thee" will resound some-
where in the city of Altoona.

CHARLES V. HALL, Kxlr,
Meadville, Pennsylvania.

Meadville High School.

A good man and true. Hall was at Meadville High
until someone sued him for breach of promise; then he de-
cided to try Pitt, and he has been here ever since.

WILLIAM M.‘ HAMILTON,
Washington, Pennsylvania.

Jefferson Academy.

Bill has a complexion that most girls would envy. He
thinks quite a bit of a certain girl and is continually talking
about her. The general opinion is that he is in love.

ONEIL HERRING, Uniontown, Pennsylvania.

Union High School.
Herring is a very energetic young man. Eats ﬂannel
cakes for breakfast and then feels lightheaded all day. Can-

not understand why mercury cannot be picked up with the
ﬁngers. A very dense head.

FRANK S. HOLMES,

appearances his statement must be correct.

Titusville, Pennsylvania.
Titusville High School.
Bill is a dressy lad and has the making of a neat, little

will capture him when he gets out of college—and it will
not be such a bad catch, either.

THOMAS R. KEPPLE, K\Ir,
Johnstown, Pennsylvania.

St. Anthony’s Academy.

A real live wire. always full of wit and humor, and gen-
erally able to make a lasting hit with the fair sex. Says he
simply cannot study, and, judging from the results of his
work, his assertion seems correct.

JACOB KLEIN, McKeesport, Pennsylvania.

McKeesport High School.

Jake is such a fake—claims to be a bright boy, but on
examinations his face assumes a bluish-white color, indica-
tive of a vacuum. Don't get sore, Jake, you know it's the
truth.

RICHARD K. LATSHAW,
Swissvale, Pennsylvania.
Swissvale High School.
The sport of the class. Dick used to be a pedagogue,
but he decided pharmacy was more to his liking. He burns

much midnight oil and once upon a time 'tis rumored he
burned his feet.

ROY G. LINDIMAN,
Beaver Falls, Pennsylvania.

Beaver Falls High School.

Roy seems to be behaving himself fairly well in Pitts-
burgh, but "he's a devil in his own home town." Just an-
other illustration of the fact that "appearances are often
deceiving."

HENRY J. LEVINE, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
Central High School.

Henry is a constant talker, but what he says does not
amount to much. Borrowed Lang's tennis shoes, and then
told him that "possession is nine-tenths of the law." Lang
is inclined to believe him. .

PHARMACY

DEANE w. McCREERY,

Greenly High School.

Dean answers to the description of being a mighty bright

asked, and it is oftimes surprising to see him answer cor-
rectly.

EARL E. MORAN, <I>AX, Altoona, Pennsylvania.

Altoona. High School.
Class Secretary-Treasurer.

No use talking, Earl is the possessor of an ivory dome.
Cannot understand why stone cells are not merristematic.
The only excuse for this lack of comprehension seems to
lie in the fact that he is very fond of the women.

WILLIAM G. PRESCOTT,
Hazelwood, Pennsylvania.

Duquesne University.

Willie bears the distinction of being the infant of the
class. Had to have a special chair made for his use. Quite
a husky little chap and says he is some basketball star. We
have to take his word for it.

JACOB STUKINSKY,
New Castle, Pennsylvania.

New Castle High School.

The philosopher of the class. The girls think he is funny,
but rummy would be a more correct diagnosis. Jake can
generally be found in the front ranks when rough-house is
started.

STANLEY N. SHELMADINE,
Pleasantville, Pennsylvania.
Pleasantville High School.
Titusville High School.

Grove City College.
University of Pittsburgh, Economics.

Stanley is said to have posed for Gibson. That was the
time he got shaved and brushed his bair back. Thinks
he has a bad temper. After shifting around a bit, he _de-
cided that pharmacy was the one best bet.

HARRY  SMITH,
White Sulphur Springs, West Virginia.
Hinton High School.
Harry is one of those fellows who keep in the back-
ground. If you ever have noticed, though, when the search-

light of public opinion is turned upon these quiet folks, they
are seen to occupy seats in the foreground. A good fellow.

Clarence is a burner of midnight oil (on the street
corner). ,And a great pet of the chemistry quiz-master.
Has a retiring disposition and is a faithful attendant upon
lectures (nit).

CHARLES S. SUITER,
Midland, Pennsylvania.

Ohio Northern University.

"Pop" is a full-grown man——never mind his looks—and
has a wonderful insight into matters. Microbes and bacteria
are visible objects to him (with his glasses on). Exceed—
ingly conversant in the presence of ladies. Not handsome,
but Winsome.

JOHN S. TRESS, Beaver Falls, Pennsylvania.
St. Vincent College, Beatty, Pennsylvania.

This subject is a difficult one to deal with. John seems
to be duly (or unduly) impressed with a sense of his own
importance, and yet at times a very agreeable sort. To
diagnose him properly will require a course of "watchful
waiting."

CYRIL J. WARD, Duquesne, Pennsylvania.
Duquesne High School.

"Cy" is more of a visitor than a student. He stops in
occasionally to see how the rest of the bunch are progress-
ing. He might be better able to tell if he would stay around
a little closer. It isn't bad after you get used to it, Mr.
Ward.

CHARLES  WEINBERGER,
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
Fifth Avenue High School.

“Chuck," as he is familiarly known, is a very sociable
chap. He can generally be heard expressing his views on
woman suffrage. No girls, not in favor of it, but very
much opposed to it——cruel-hearted creature that he is.

BERT‘S. WICK, Kilt,
Brownsville, Pennsylvania.
South Brownsville High School.

Bert is the lad who moves the country into the city every
morning. Full of energy because there is no outlet for its
escape. Never surprised in his life; expects everything be-
fore it happens. A daily ride on the train makes him appear
business-like.

ROBERT L. WOOD, Titusville, Pennsylvania.
Titusville High School.

Last, but not the least by any means, comes Bob, the
fellow with the everlasting smile. He is a very jovial piece
of mechanism, and poses as a real good fun producer. Likes
to see everyone happy, and does his share to keep them so.

The first faculty numbered five, the faculty to-day numbers

three hundred and thirty—two. They have been gathered from .

all quarters of the globe, practically every institution of learning
in existence is represented, and finally, they are as competent a
quota of learned men and women as can be found for the work.
The student enrollment includes young men and women who rep-
resent nearly every nation in the world, as well as every race and
creed.

The combined efforts of all are resulting in most obvious edu-
cational, social, moral, civil and physical progress. It is a school
for the poor boy as well as the more favored. The upward climb
is not to be daunted.

Let the good work go on!

Coming

""“ HE reward of merit is inevitable.
w This applies and is demonstrated
most forcibly as regards athletics
at the University of Pittsburgh.
Furthermore, athletics at this in-
stitution are clean, and teams going out from
here are recognized to-day as models of person-
nel and ability. All of which accounts for the
enviable recognition being rightfully accorded
Pitt athletes in all branches of sport by those
in position to know, and the honor, so earnestly
striven for, is just as fully appreciated by all
concerned, the athletic authorities, the members
of the teams themselves, and last but by no
means the least, the student body.
In football the past season Pitt experienced
a heart-rending reverse when Washington and
Jefferson was returned the victor in the only
game that Pitt lost out of a heavy schedule of
nine hard ones. It was no disgrace to lose that
game, especially did W. and  backers take
on surprise when their twenty and thirty-to-
nothing _"dope" went all wrong. The season
was a distinct success, and a credit in every
sense. The work of Coach Joe Duff and his
assistant “Nubs" Harlan is reﬂected in the line
showing made by the team, and the names of
the former Princetonians will always be asso-
ciated with the turning point in Pitt athletics.
The fact that the one-year residence rule is to
be adopted at Pitt commencing with the season
l9l6-l7 is another step forward in Pitt's ath-
letic prowess. Hopeful opponents need take

266

ATHLETICS
IN GENERAL

Strong

faint satisfaction from this announcement as the
caliber of the teams will not be reduced in the
least, for the quality of the incoming athletes is
fully in keeping with the high standard being
set.

Basketball honors were showered upon
Mother Pitt by her stellar team this year, the
quintette winning the State Collegiate title the
first time in the history of this institution. A
handsome loving cup thereby became the prop-
erty of the University for one year, it being
necessary to win it three years to become the
permanent property of a school in the associa-
tion. Chancellor McCormick voiced the unan-
imous wish of Pitt men when he said he hoped
the teams to come would return the cup to the
University as its own.

The wrestling team had a more or less dis-
appointing season, due to various unfortunate
reverses, but looks forward to bigger things next
year.

Several swimming records were shattered this
season by the Water Men. Their record against
the Navy team was the best made by any col-
legiate crew the past season, which is a distinct
honor. _

Baseball is yet to come, and so are track and
tennis. Indications are that all these teams
will make records fully in keeping with the
splendid work being done by the other squads.
Last year’s teams in these sports were highly
successful, and there are prospects of even better
this spring.

Looking Forward

The football prospects at Pitt for the season
of I915 are brighter than ever before, aug-
mented in great measure by the fact that Glenn
S. Warner, a grizzled veteran of the gridiron,
has been secured to succeed Joe Duff as head
coach. Warner comes here from the Carlisle
Indian School, where he has gained fame year
after year by turning out formidable football
machines. To-day he is ranked as one of the
greatest football coaches in America.

Warner began coaching in I895 at the Uni-
versity of Georgia and later accepted a similar
position at Cornell, his Alma Mater. His great
success at these institutions led up to his ap-
pointment as athletic supervisor at the Carlisle
Indian School for ﬁfteen years, where he has
annually developed wonderful football teams
from green material, save for two years. I904
and I905, when he returned to Cornell.

Warner will have the greater part of last
year's squad to draw from, as well as a number
of new men from the prep. schools, and the
I9l4 Freshman team. Losses to the team are
Captain Smith, a consistent lineman for the past
four years. Leo Collins, who has played a

269

star game at end and in the back ﬁeld for two
seasons, will graduate in the Spring. "Pete"
Heil, the last of the "_Iayhawkers," has served
his time out with Pitt. He has been a depend-
able and steady quarterback during the last
two seasons. Freddie Ward, the all-around
utility back ﬁeld man, will graduate. "Chuck"
Reese, an aggressive guard, and a hard man
for the opposition to handle, will graduate also.
These ﬁve sturdy warriors leave the team with
the satisfaction of knowing that their efforts are
fully appreciated and their records labeled
“Well Done."

Guy M. Williamson was elected captain of
the I9I5 team at the annual football banquet
Thanksgiving night. His chances of piloting a
championship team are decidedly ﬂattering.

The schedule for next season looms up bright
and attractive. In place of Cornell, the man-
agement has booked the University of Penn-
sylvania for a game in Philadelphia on October
twenty-third. Great interest attaches to this
contest, as it is likely to be the forerunner of an
annual game with Penn. Student enthusiasts
are already talking of a special train to Phila-
delphia for the game, and such spirit is to be
encouraged.

Resume of 1914 Season

CORNELL UNIVERSITY 3; PITT 9.

Fresh from a month of preliminary practice
at the training camp near Windber, the Pitt
football squad invaded Ithaca full of conﬁ-
dence for the opening game with Cornell and
came away on the long end of a 9 to 3 score.

Cornell secured the lead three minutes after
the first kick-off after rushing the ball to the 30-
yard line, where Barret placed a dropkick be-
tween the goal posts. Before the last echoes of
the famous Cornell yell had died away, Wil-

all veterans of last year's team except Carlson

center and proved one of the defensive stars of
the team.

The Pitt squad showed remarkable physical
condition, due to the excellent training in the
mountains before the opening of the season.

WESTMINSTER COLLEGE I0; Prrr 2|.

The second game of the season, which was
generally looked upon as an easy one, proved
rather hard going for Pitt. Westminster began

from this time and early in the ﬁnal quarter
worked the ball down the ﬁeld, and Hanley's
pass to Herron deposited the pigskin twenty
yards from the goal of the big Red team, where
Hastings added three more points with a ﬁeld

Pitt's backﬁeld, composed largely of new
men, worked together well both on the offense

and defense. The line did equally well with

274

the scoring with a ﬁeld goal and Pitt followed
with a touchdown by Hastings, which made
the count 7 to 3. Pitt scored again in the sec-
ond, when De Hart recovered a fumble and
raced across the Westminster goal. Pittsburgh's
last points came when "Steve" Dillon captured
a forward pass and eluded several tacklers for
thirty yards to a touchdown. Westminster

U. S. NAVAL ACADEMY 6; PITT 13.

In a hard-fought encounter, in which for-
ward passing played a very important part,
Pitt defeated the United States Naval Acad-
emy on Annapolis Field l3 to 6. During this
contest Williamson had his leg broken, and was
obliged to remain inactive until the last game
of the season.

Pittsburgh scored in the first quarter by virtue
of a forward. pass to Herron, who carried the
ball to the one-yard line, from which position a
line buck put it over.

quarter on a long forward pass. During the

warriors over their opponents in this battle. Pitt
scored early in the first quarter when Hastings
booted one over from the eighteen-yard line. In
the second period of play, a succession of line
plunges coupled with splendid runs by Miller
and DeI-Iart, brought the ball down to the
Indians’ thirty-yard line, from whence DeHart
ran around the Indian line for a touchdown.

and carried 40 yards for a touchdown. Pitt
was unable to score again until the third

whole Georgetown team for a touchdown. Sev-

the stubborn resistance of the Blue and Gold
players. Late in the last quarter, when George-
town was opening up in a final attempt to
score, Miller, Pitt's ﬂeet halfback, intercepted
a forward pass and raced 70 yards for the last
count of the game.

DICKINSON COLLEGE 0; PITT 96.

In a very one-sided game in which Pitt
scored almost at will, the Dickinson College
team was smothered under a 96 to 0 score. The

WASHINGTON AND JEFFERSON 13; Pm 10.

After outplaying Washington and Jefferson

its only game of the season through unavoid-

Black players.

The game was played before the largest
crowd that ever attended a football game at
Forbes Field, there being more than 25,000 in
attendance. Interest in the game was aug-
mented by the fact that Pitt had a clean rec-

Mar. 6—Pitt 39, Penn State 35; at Duquesne Garden, Pgh.

The winning of a sectional championship in
basketball has hitherto contented teams repre-
senting Pitt in that branch of athletics, but this
season's quintette went a notch higher and
grabbed off the state collegiate title. The
achievement was a meritorious one, and
brought fame to every member of the formid-
able team, as well as to their Alma Mater,

which, by leaps and bounds, is mounting fast

28|

in the athletic world. The privilege to play the
championship game with Swarthmore College
came as a result of Pitt winning the sectional
title from State and W. and  Swarthmore
had won the eastern and central championships
by defeating Lehigh and Albright. The classic
contest occurred in Cooper Battalion I Hall,
Philadelphia, on Saturday evening, March I3,
Pitt winning without any diﬂiculty by the de-
cisive score of 40 to 26.

The team was ably coached by Dr. George
M. Flint, and captained by Norman C. Och-
senhirt, Med., ’l5. Those participating in the
championship game were Captain Ochsenhirt,
Ben Lubic, Joseph Matson, George Graham,
Andy Hastings and Thomas Healy. These
men received their letters, together with "Red"

Harold S. Downing.

The championship cup was presented to the
team, represented by Captain Ochsenhirt, dur-
ing the regular Chapel exercises in Memorial
Hall on Friday morning, April 9, by Chancel-
lor S. B. McCormick.- The applause that at-
tended the presentation demonstrated the fact
that the student body heartily appreciated the
excellent work of the team.

covering the team's work for the season show
that a total of 633 points was run up as against
the opponents’ 486, an average of 35 I-6 to 27

a total of 283, including 219 points on fouls.
Matson was the star at making ﬁeld baskets,

At the annual basketball banquet held on
Thursday evening, April 8, Ben Lubic was ac-
corded a well deserved honor when he was
chosen as captain of next year’s team. He will
have with him all of last season’s squad with
the exception of Ochsenhirt and Graham. Add
to this the new material and it sounds like a

Twelve wins out of eighteen games played
was the record of the l9l4 baseball team, con-
stituting the most successful season in this
branch of sport the University ever enjoyed.
The team started oif with four victories, then
hit a slump in the games at the end of the East-
ern trip, but ﬁnished up the season in good
shape.

Pitt captured the Bi-State championship
with two out of three games won from West
Virginia University, and two victories over
Washington and Jefferson. The series with
Penn State resulted in a victory for each. Pitt

285

played Princeton to a 2-3 defeat, Langdon
holding the Tigers to two hits.

The team's batting average was .269 for the
season, with Dillon leading. His average was
.368. Englehart, Ammons and Riehl were all
above the .300 mark. Wilson, Healy. Mor-
row, Peck and Beattie all batted close to the
coveted circle.

The team was coached by Mays Edmund-
son, who proved a very able and tactful in-

I. N. Hayes, third base; T. P. Beattie,
catcher; W. W. Riehl, pitcher; E. H. Lang-
don, pitcher, and R. E. Grove, manager.

The season of I915 gives promise of being
even more successful, as all of last year's team
are back, with the exception of Wilson and
Ammons, and there is plenty of new material
on hand, including Hastings and DeHart,
from Kiski; Matson, from Shady Side; Hart,
from Indiana Normal; Gray, from Mercers-
burg; and several others. Samuel B. Wilson,

 

BASEBALL
RESUME

last year's captain, succeeds Mays Edmundson
as coach. With his keen insight into inside
baseball, his ability to command the highest re-
spect of the players, together with the excellent
material at his disposal, he should be able to
turn out a winning team. Thomas F. Healy,
the crack shortstop, is the new captain, and 
B. Williamson is the student manager. Healy
is conceded to be one of the best college players
in the country, and his ﬁght and "pep" keep
him in the game to win at all times. His pres-
ence as captain will instill the proper ginger
and scrap into his men, which qualities in a
baseball pilot are so essential to a winning ag-
gregation.

The combined efforts of Coach Andrew
Kerr, Captain Matt Marshall, Manager O. B.
Opsion and every member of the squad resulted
in the track team making a mighty creditable
showing against the several opposing aggrega-
tions that were met last year. The team parti-
cipated in four indoor meets, ﬁve outdoor meets
and one relay meet, making good records in all
with the exception of the one at State College,
where the Center County huskies threw a scare
into the Pitt camp by piling up an unexpected
but none the less decisive score.

Track work received special attention for the
ﬁrst time last year and the results were obvious.
The schedule was worthy of the best efforts of
the men, and Captain Marshall unceasingly
kept up the enthusiasm among the candidates,
who were mostly Freshmen, and to him much
of the season's success is due.

During the season three of the University
track and field records were equalled, and
seven new marks established. Burwell and

Jim Marshall equalled the I00-yard dash rec-

ord of IO l-5 seconds, and John Sheehan tied
Tinsley's record of 5 feet 8 inches in the run-
ning. The new records made were as follows:
220-yard dash, James Marshall 222-5 sec-
onds; two—mile run, James Stuart Crumbling,
I0 minutes I8 seconds; l20-yard high hurdles,
Stanley Scott, I5 4-5 seconds; 220-yard low
hurdles, Stanley Scott, 25 seconds; running
broad jump, John Wall Regis Sheehan, 25 feet
5 inches; pole vault, Louis McMaster, ll feet
6 inches; and throwing the discus, Earl Am-
mons, H9 feet I inch.

The following men were awarded their letter
at the close of the season: Captain Matthew
Marshall, James Marshall, James Burwell,
William lVlcI-lugh, Harry Shof, W. W. Allen,
W.  Rosenthal, S. L. Scott,  Stewart

meet, held at Duquesne Garden, January 31,
under the auspices of the Crafton Athletic As-
sociation, Pitt carried off first honors, thereby
winning the championship of New Jersey,
Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Northern
Maryland. On February 2| the team took
more honors at the Y. M. C. A. meet held at
Duquesne Garden, and thereby secured perma-
nent possession of the McIntosh trophy, a silver
cup, offered by Harry W. McIntosh to the
team winning this meet two years in succession.
In a dual meet, the Westinghouse Club was
defeated, scoring but 20 points to Pitt’s 58.
In the last indoor meet in which the University
participated, that conducted by the Pittsburgh
Athletic Association, Pitt took second honors.

The early spring permitted the men to get
into fine shape. The ﬁrst outdoor event was
the University of Pennsylvania relays at Phila-
delphia. In this Pitt ﬁnished third. Opposing
the local runners in the relays were the follow-
ing teams: Lafayette, Johns Hopkins, Ohio
State, New York University, Haverford and
New York Law School. The hoodoo which
usually manifests itself at this meet was con-
quered to a greater extent than for the past few
years. Lou McMasters won second place in
the pole vault on this occasion.

Much interest attached to the inter-depart-
ment meet, which was held at Trees Stadium
on May 2. The A. R. Hamilton trophy be-
came the property of the College team for one
year by virtue of its carrying off first honors
with a score of 48 I-5 points. The Dental
School team was second with 45 points, and
the Miners were third with 36 3-5 points.

The annual dual meet with Washington and
Jefferson College was held at Washington on
May 9. The Blue and Gold athletes had no
trouble in conquering their opponents by the
score of 79 1-2 to 45 1-2. Carnegie Tech gave
the Pitt team its greatest scare of the season in
the meet on May 15th. The Plaid team was
in the lead until the high jump and broad jump
events—the last two events——were held, and it
was in these that the Panther runners forged
ahead and permitted their team to win by the
close score of 63 3-5 to 60 2-5.

TRACK
RESUME

May 23 was the date the Ninth Annual In-
tercollegiate and Interscholastic Track and
Field Meet was held at Schenley Oval under
the auspices of the University. Teams repre-
senting Penn State, Carnegie Tech, Washing-
ton and Jefferson, Allegheny College, West-
minster College, Grove City College, West
Virginia University, West Virginia Wesleyan
and Geneva College were entered. The Penn
State team showed its supremacy by scoring
96 I-5 points. Pitt was second with 641-5
points; Tech third, with 30 l-Z; Allegheny
fourth, with I8 I-2; W. and  fourth, with
12 I-2, and Westminster ﬁfth, with 6 points.

In the Intercollegiate and Interscholastic
Meet held by Westminster College, the Pitt
team emerged with signal honors, having
scored a total of 99 1-2 points. Tech was the
runner-up with 60 I-2 points; Geneva had I8
points, and Grove City 8.

The final and most disastrous meet of the
season occurred at State College on June 8.
This was the annual commencement meet at
State and as the “dope” ran, their team won
by the score of 9] 2-3 to 34 1-3.

S. L. Scott, ’l7, was elected captain of this
year's team, and O. B. Opsion, 'I5, was re-
turned as manager. Both have gotten their
respective duties well under way, and this
year’s team is much more promising than ever
before. The two Marshalls, McHugh, Shof
and Ammons are among those lost to the team,
but new men of repute to take their places are:
Murray, a pole-vaulter, from Indiana Normal;
Sutherland, certain to smash all discus records
in every meet; Del-lart, from Kiski, a fast
track man; May, Punxsutawney High,
quarter-miler; Chappel, a high jumper; Cook,
a quarter-miler from North Dakota University;
Campbell, a pole-vaulter, from Grove City Col-
lege; Livermore, a distance man, and several
others of promise. In the indoor meets to date
good records have been hung up, and bigger
things are anticipated in the open air events. A
shift in the schedule pleasing to Pitt men this
year is the fact that the W. and  dual meet
is to be staged at Schenley Oval.

A Word in Common

Owl History

As a matter of history it might be of interest to those now attending the University to note
in passing that the maiden issue of THE OWL was published in I907. It was dedicated‘ to the now
deceased Honorable Thomas Mellon, then the oldest living alumnus of Pitt. He was the father
of Messrs. Andrew W. and Richard B. Mellon, to whom the l9l6 OWL is respectfully dedi-
cated. A notable distinction is borne out in the fact that the loyalty shown the University by
the father was not permitted to diminish by the sons. James Irwin McCormick was the first editor-
in~chief and Conant Van Blarcom was the ﬁrst business manager.

The second volume appeared in 1908 and was dedicated to William Thaw. In 1909
Dr. John Alfred Brashear, Chancellor from I90] to I904, was honored. The entire student body
was named in l9l0. The builders of the University, both past and present, were named in l9l I.
Dr. Joseph Stockton, Chancellor of the University when it was known as the Pittsburgh Academy,
was honored in I912. The l9l3 OWL was dedicated to A.  Kelly, Jr., always a close friend
of Pitt. It was Benjamin Thaw, A.B.. l878, a son of William Thaw, who was honored in l9l4,

and, lastly, Joseph C. Trees was named in last year's annual.

The University tennis team had an unusually
successful season, in fact, the best in its history.
The team defeated Penn State, the Navy and
University of Pennsylvania, tied Yale, losing
to Princeton and Harvard, the recognized pre-
miers of the college tennis world. Such meri-
torious work is destined to be followed up this
season with a better record, although the new
team will have to strive hard, as it will be with-
out the services of ex-Manager Lytle and Walt

Manager Caut’s

Coach Harry Seymour, a rabid tennis en-
thusiast, is always jubilant over his teams and
their work, but speaks in highly glowing terms
concerning what he expects this year's team to
do to its opponents.

Tennis has taken on a new lease of life at
Pitt this Spring, and a University Association
under student control is being promulgated in
the several schools. Such an organization will
aid materially in bringing out available ma-

terial for the Varsity team.

SWEET CAPTAIN

The swimming team, under the direction of
Coach Taylor, displayed some real formidable
ability the past season, doing well in both the
P. A. A. and U. S. Naval Academy meets.
The _first meet took place before Christmas, at
which time_ the men were greatly handicapped
by lack of practice. At Annapolis, on F eb-
ruary 6, the team showed its real ﬁghting cal-
iber. The meager foot of elusive space which
separated Swope from the white tile was all
that deprived Pitt of victory and enabled the
Navy aggregation to score, for the second time,
a marginal triumph by the score of 36-1 7. The
result was not a discouragement, as it was the
best record made against the Navy by any of
its opponents this year. Captain Sweet scored
a clever victory in the 40-yard dash, defeating
Vail and Marshall, of the Navy, in the fast
time of 40 4-5 seconds. Buckland easily won
the 60-yard back stroke event, establishing a
new record of 39 seconds. New records were
established in the relay race, the back stroke,
the 220-yard and I00-yard events. The sum-

maries were:

I60-yard relay—-First, Navy (Dashiel, Herndon, Cook
and Vail); second, Pitt (Sweet, Ludwig, Swope and
Buckland). Time |:23 3-4.

40-yard dash—First, Sweet, Pitt; second, Vail, Navy;
third, Marshall, Navy. Time 204-5 seconds. ‘ '

60-yard back stroke—First, Buckland, Pitt; second,
Richards, Navy; third, Borden, Navy. Time 39 seconds.

220-yard swim—First, Dashiel, Navy; second, Swope,
Pitt; third, Eckhardt, Pitt. Time 2:37 2-5.

Plunge for distance—First, Post, Navy; second, Lee-
meyer, Navy; third, McDiarmid, Pitt. Distance 60 feet
in 39 l—5 seconds.

I00-yard swim—First, Dashiel, Navy; second, Swope,
Pitt; third, Bodfish, Navy. Time 61 seconds.

Another distinctive athletic triumph was cap-

tured for Pitt on February 26 at the P. A. A.,

300

when Harold Buckland, of the School of
Mines, came into his own through the winning
of the Middle Atlantic Championship of the
A. A. U., in the one hundred ﬁfty yard back-

stroke swimming contest in two minutes and one

. second.

Captain'Sweet, Swope and Buckland were
the only men awarded their letters.

The annual University swimming champion-
ships were held in connection with the inter-
scholastic swimming meet at the gym Saturday
evening, April I7. The contests were all close
and in the 200-yard crawl stroke a new record
was hung up by Wylie Swope, who made the
distance in 2 minutes 23 seconds, lowering his
own record of last year by four seconds. F. H.
Betz, formerly of Washington (D. C.) High,
won the 40-yard University championship race
for novices when he made the distance in 24
seconds. Thompson, Econ. '17, ﬁnished sec-
ond. McDiarmid had everything his own way
in the plunge, winning on a plunge of 53 feet
8 inches. This was over six feet less that that
made in the interscholastic plunge. Swope also
won the University championship 40-yard race,
negotiating the distance in 2| seconds.

Summary :

40-yard novice race, University championship—Won by
F. H. Betz;  A. Thompson second; Messerly third.
Time 24 seconds.

40-yard open University championship—Won by W.
W. Swope; H. Ludwig second; H. Buckland third. Time
2| seconds.

200-yard open race, University championship—Won by
W. W. Swope; Howard Ludwig second. Time 2 minutes
23 seconds. ‘

Plunge for distance—Won by McDiarmid; Helmbold
second; Hallock third.

gone into operation, and now wrestling practice
will be held the year round, with provision
made to have it count for gym credits for those
men who work out with the squad.

Charles Reinecke, formerly national ama-
teur champion of the United States and one of
the best coaches in the country, did much with
the material at hand the past winter, and, al-
though the men did not make a howling suc-
cess of their schedule, he drilled into them many
ﬁne points which will not be forgotten next sea-
son, when he expects to turn out a victorious
team, for he has been retained for another year.

Ray Collins captained the squad and
worked hard in its interests, but the material
was not extensive, and the men not quite ripe
for championship bouts. The reverse is antici-
pated next year after a plentiful course of

tutoring under Reinecke. Many candidates
are beginning to realize that physical develop-
ment is one of the prime results from indulging
in this sport, and in the long run the wrestling

game at Pitt is being given a unique stimulus.

In the P. A. A. meet, held March I9 and
20, the Pitt grapplers did not display any sen-
sational form, but presented enough "stuff" to
make their opponents travel hard at every turn.
Several Pitt men came close to getting in a
winning twist, but lack the ﬁnal punch. The
same was the case in the meet over at State on
March 5. The result of these meets was en-
couraging to such a degree that new life and
hope seemed to be imparted almost spontane-
ously with their culmination, and the men set
out with unprecedented enthusiasm in their de-
termination to build up a winning team next
year.

Ray Huff, 'l6, has been elected manager of
that wondrous team expected to appear next
winter, and is engaged in arranging several
meets, the indications being that the schedule
will be extensive.

The “Hall of Fame” was established at the
University in the fall of l9l4. Its purpose is
to furnish an added incentive to athletes in all
branches of athletic activity, and to create a
sort of public record of the notable achieve-
ments of the various teams and individuals that
those coming after may be able to “go and do
likewise." Teams or individuals who win cer-
tain honors will have their pictures hung perma-
nently in a_ room set aside for this purpose in the
University Track House, each of these pictures
bearing a printed. inscription noting the respec-
tive accomplishment of the teams or individuals
thus honored.

The rules governing the display of such pic-
tures are as follows:

“We Hate Ourselves”

In presenting the ninth issue of THE OWL, the class of I916 places itself on record as
being fully awake to the progress of the times. Hurried resumes of former year books at this institu-
tion convince the staff that this edition is, in a fair way, representative of the upward strides being
made by a rapidly expanding and promising University.

Obstacles encountered by past boards pale in their enormity when it is taken into consid-
eration that, instead of chronicling the activities of a few hundred students, the work of the first
board, this year's staff found it its bounden duty to compile data in the interests of thirty-five
hundred and thirty-ﬁve students, the largest enrollment in the history of Pitt.

Many new features have been introduced in this year's annual, which stamp it as a dis-
tinct credit to all concerned. Especially is attention directed to the art department, the excellency
of which speaks for itself. Those who contributed to this section are indeed to be commended. V

Just as favorable consideration is the just reward of the literary contributors.

Much outside assistance was also sought of necessity, and in all instances was this cheerfully
given.

To the kind friends of the University who rendered financial support in the way of adver-
tising due acknowledgment is made, and we trust their respective establishments will be able to
hire adequate police assistance to keep the crowds back as a reward of their managers’ keen busi-
ness insight.

And to all others who contributed in any and all ways to the success of this book the
sincere gratitude of the OWL board is tendered.

To publish the I916 OWL has indeed been a great privilege and pleasure for the staff,
and if the class accepts it as fulﬁlling its intended mission in due manner, however meager, we will
feel that our efforts have not been in vain.

Freshman Athletics

With the aim in view of applying the one
year residence rule at Pitt starting with the fall
of l9l6, a consistent and determined effort has
been exerted to raise the standard of Freshman
athletics. During the past couple of years the
quality of the ﬁrst year teams has been gradu-
ally improving and by the time the rule goes
into effect a system will be in force that will
guarantee splendid material for them.

The Freshman football team the past season
had quite a successful career, as also did the
basketball and baseball teams. Earl Ammons
directed the destinies of the football and base-
ball teams, and E. L. Landis looked after the
basket ball squad. These same men will have
the teams next year in charge, and will be given
assistance by several of the ex—varsity men who
have served their athletic career.

RICHARD WILLIAM AHLERS, ATA,
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

Allegheny High School.
1915 Owl Board.

Three hours of his valuable time is all he spares us each

. week now. The rest of it he spends learning to extract a

maximum fee from corporations, for the minimum of labor.

WILLIAM FRIES ARRAS,
Coraopolis, Pennsylvania.

Coraopolis High School.

It was reported during the winter term that Bill had a
job. Knowing his lack of academic tendencies in this direc-
tion, we feel that he has valid grounds for a libel suit.

RALPH JOHN ASKIN, rI>P2,
Wilmerding, Pennsylvania.

Turtle Creek Union High School.
School of Medicine, 1917.

Young Men's Christian Association.
Track.

Askin aspired as an athlete as long ago as we can re-

member, but seems to have been disqualiﬁed by his regard
for the Pitt sporting powers.

JOHN STINSON AUSTIN, AAM,
Greenville, Pennsylvania.

Greenville High School.

Thiel College.

Student Band.

Young Men's Christian Association.
Pltkin Club.

Austin has only begun to blossom in his senior year,
apparently. Since he has had an opportunity to make an

occasional speech, his lmowable and likeable qualities have
come to the surface.

MARTIN E. BABACK,
_ Johnstown, Pennsylvania.

Gymnasium of Szarvas. Hungary.
School of Medicine, 1918.

Married and runs a "furrin" drug store. Taking medi-

cine for a vacation.

ANTONIO BIANCO, ~-‘ '
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

Central High School.
Italian Club.

Tony travels incog., under a different alias for every day
of the week. In this way he can attend a dance every
night, and get away with the gay deceiver business.

GRETCHEN BALDWIN BUSKE, IIGN,
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

Central High School.

Young VVomen‘s Christian Association, Cabinet.
VVomen‘s Activities Association.

Pitkin Club.

We have only one fault to ﬁnd with her—-—she is going to
leave us too soon. She is past and present mistress of the
entertainer} art, as the C. A. cabinets can testify. Anti-
dance.

ELLA COHEN, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

Central High School.
VVomen’s Activities Association.

In the old days, before the Great Schism. Ella was a
shining social light. But now she devotes herself to math
and to getting through two terms before the rest of us.

HARRISON DAVIDSON,
Turtle Creek, Pennsylvania.

Verona High School.
Young Men's Christian Association.

As a self-eiiacer, he is a distinct success, and we are
learning to like him, despite that formidable countenance.

MICHAEL DEPTA, NEN,
Mt. Pleasant, Pennsylvania.

Milwaukee Normal School.

East Huntington Township High School.
Student Senate, Medicine.

School of Medicine, 1917.

Depta stepped in where angels would get their wings
soiled. He made a good secretary of the Board of Con-
trol, as such dignitaries go, but was "not there" as a
member.

PITI‘ PANTHER

  The Pitt Panther

During the summer of l9l4 several students
of the University conceived the idea of a comic
magazine for Pitt. With other kindred spirits
the project was planned, and on November
twenty~ﬁfth the first issue was placed before
the student body.

But four issues were projected for this year.
Of these, three numbers have appeared, and
with each succeeding effort the board is putting

out a greatly improved journal.

Much of the success of the undertaking is
due to George M. P. Baird, '09, of the English
department, who has given his support in all
ways possible to the Panther staff.

Next year it is planned to issue at least eight
numbers of the Panther. With the experience
gained this year and the new talent that will
come next fall, Pitt's comic publication should
have a prosperous existence.

With the early weeks of the school year a
local organization of the Intercollegiate Pro-
hibition Association was formed under the
name of the Prohibition League of the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh. The main objects of the
new society were to promote the study of the
liquor question and to train men for leadership
in prohibition work.

During its ﬁrst year the League has con-
ducted a study class on the liquor problem, and
has installed an annual oratorical contest which
was won by C. A. Wagner, ’l8. Delegates
were sent to the state convention at Dickinson
in April, and in addition various matters in aid
of prohibition have been cared for.

The success of the present year furnishes a
very encouraging outlook for the new year and
presages a League which will be a real factor
in the coming ﬁght to make Pennsylvania free.
Plans are_ now under way for an active cam-
paign during the summer and fall, in which

our men will play their part.

The Intercollegiate Prohibition Association
is the central body of student organizations in
more than 250 colleges of the United States.
It is designed not only for the objects men-
tioned above, but offers a ﬁeld where the college
man may find a practical application for his

endeavors before he gets out into the world.

PITT CLUBS

Pitt Clubs

The desire of Pitt Alumni and former stu-
dents to band themselves into local organiza-
tions that they might keep in close touch with

the University resulted in the formation of

three such clubs during the past year.

Pitt men of Jefferson County organized the
Jefferson County Pitt Club at an enthusiastic

meeting held in Punxsutawney. Dr. R. C.
Gourley was chosen President.
The formation of the Westmoreland County
Pitt Club occurrred at Greensburg. Dr. W.
J. Potts is the President.
The third club was organized at Beaver,

being the Beaver County Pitt Club. Dr. 
J. Allen was elected President.

The object of the organization is to further the
social relations and to solve all the problems of
the girls at Pitt. [ED1ToR’s NoTE—We do
not understand by this that it is a combine for

the readier solution of mathematics problems.]

One of the social events of the year was a
dance—and that a manless one. The upper
class girls, masquerading as men, were the

escorts and dancing partners of the freshman
cc-—eds. The W. A. A. has also held several

teas.’ The girls’ rest room has been furnished
by this association. Elaborate preparations
for a spring festival are being made. The fes-
tival is to be held during commencement week.
The Association hopes to make this event one

"Her voice is ever soft and low—
An excellent thing in woman."

Like all geniuses, she can fathom the depths of non-

the literary labyrinth, "_Iahberwocl<y." with much feeling
and exactness. She also likes to fool around with a snaggy
bit of Latin, full of pitfalls and traps for the unwary. But
Ethel merely casts her eye over it, across the page and
downward, and the thing is done.

‘ P. C. W.’S TRIBUTE.

[Toz I WANT THE LAD IN THE UNIFORM.]

They say the soldier boy is brave,
Who ﬁghts his country's foe;
Though he works quite hard there are braver
lads
And some of them we know.
When to a female college called,
With many maidens near,
They venture there most willingly
And show no trace of fear.

CHORUS:
Hurrah for the lads in the Pitt Glee Club,

Those heroes so true;
Indeed they can sing, and do anything
To boost the gold and blue.
We welcome them sincerely
Tonight, with delight,
We think they are some singers, don’t you?
When we think of the boys,
We’ll recall midst our joys—
The lads in the Pitt Clubs, too.

draw up a new constitution for the University
of Pittsburgh Student Body; we are delegated

422

to do a work which shall immortalize our names
at Pitt. [Applause——I-lear! Hearl] Let us,
therefore, with great gravity, proceed to the
work set before us, for “the evil that men do
lives after them; the good is oft interred with
their bones.” For this reason we must be care-
ful in promulgating a document which shall so
long outlive us. I have already appointed a
secretary to save you the trouble of electing one.
[Voicez No trouble at all.] The first thing to
decide is what kind of a legislative body we

shall have.

Mr. FaIvcett——I believe in letting things run
free.

Mr. Welsh—Yes, so do I; everything except
grape juice.

Mr. Parvin——That’s a small matter, any
way. What we are here to decide is whether
there is any possible way of getting Mr. Mor-
gan out of the Senate.

Chairman—I see by these remarks that we
are agreed that there shall be a legislative
body. Now, what shall we call it?

Mr. Selelfman——The Asylum for Defunct
Politicians.

Mr. ArthI1r—Before we name it I wish to
ask: Am I to be nominated for President?

C hairman—No, sir.
Mr. Arthur——Nor for Treasurer?

Chubby's reach exceeds his grasp, politically speaking.
For one year he made the most ornamental banquet com-
mittee member the College ever had. But somebody mixed
the signals when “next time" came around. However, we
can't hold that against a man of such unfailing rosiness of
cheek, and delightful grin. His other features are perhaps
not so fortunate. Always appears sans "weskit." but atone:
by the vocality of his neckties.

She does so love to dance. Figurez-vousl Still, since she
entered that gruelling chemistry course, she has become but
the shadow of her former self. And then again, she came
from that famous “Pennsylvania State Normal School."
which is sufficient handicap for any ambitious student to
labor under. "For a' that and a’ that," she comes up
smiling, and when Ruth smiles that golden smile, a wilder-

"Minerva," "The Spirit of '76." No instructor at Pitt
has yet discovered the art of steering her away from asking
questions. However, these questions frequently lead her
into deep water, as she once, by one of them abruptly turned
a boatride committee meeting into a riot. Her peevish atti-
tude which she is taking through college with her is merely
assumed in order that she may not be overlooked. Minnie
never Hatters anyone. "Oh, you think you look nice, do
you? Well, you don't."

“Victory." “You may ask me anything except my
weight." She is dancing and singing her way through life,
frequently bubbling forth like a geyser, with hot epigrams
and sparkling aphorisms. Every spring she carries a light
schedule, that she may devote a great deal of time to
"Campustry," in which she is proﬁcient. Her sympathies
are with the sufiragettes, and we suspect her of socialistic
tendencies from what she tells us of her political science
class. Gloom ﬂies out at the window when "Victory"
comes in at the door. "Victory" carries the day, when she
goes to a picnic at Oakmont.

Has its own sweet rewards.

THE
COLLEGE

GLENN EDWARD CHARLES,
Warsaw, New York.

Warsaw High School.
Amherst College.

We asked our oﬂice boy what to write about this fellow
Charles, the gentleman in question being separated by some
little distance from his native habitat, and we having not
yet had opportunity to brush up more than a speaking ac-
quaintance. "Oh," says he, "you can always ﬁnd him
homing into a Hock of co-eds and cultivating the gentler
and more agreeable pleasures of life." Which, for an
otlice boy, we considered philosophical enough.

JOHN NEWELL CROMBIE,
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

Central High School.
Chemical Society.
Alembic Club.

Crombie is both petite and chic. He can put on a beau-
tiful side on occasion. It is hinted privately that he has
called on a working majority of the College co-eds—once.
When the "crool" second-year gents sought him he was
expert at making himself scarce. But far from being
captious. we give John credit for a considerable amount of
well-handled gray matter, when it comes to molecules,
ions, et al.

LOUISE STEPHENSON CULLEY, IIGN,
Statesville, North Carolina.

Bellevue High School.

Secretary Freshman College Girls 1,
Treasurer Young Women's Christian Asso 2.
Women's Activities Association.

Pitkin Club.

She is one of those cheerful spirits one likes to have
around. She is always busy at something for the glory of
Pitt, the Y. W. C. A., or the Pi Thets. If Louise
weren't around to run things, the Chancellor would have to
resign. We venture to say that as a saleswoman of choco-
late or a promoter of the dairy lunch industry, she has no
rival. Louise has also worked long and faithfully for the
social solidarity of the l9l6 class, for boatrides, receptions
and proms have seen her on their committees.

JOSEPH PRICE DANCY, A<I>A,
Washington, D. C.

M. Street High School, Washington.
Chemical Society.
Young Men's Christian Association.

Another of those colored boys who are putting the
Capital City on our registration map. He baﬂles the profs
with his elaborate questions and impenetrable answers.
Dancy is very alphabetically inclined. He prepped at M
Street High School in the N. W. section of the D. C..
and belongs to the A. M. E. Z., not to mention the Y. M.
C. A. and the A. P. A.

of study are employed in all departments. The course of study is thorough and

practical, and is intended to train men as pastors and preachers. A special course

is altered in Practical Christian Ethics, in which students investigate the problems
of city missions, settlement work, and other forms of Christian activity. The City of Pitts-
burgh aftords unusual opportunities for the study of social problems.

The students have exceptional library facilities. The Seminary Library of 35,000
volumes contains valuable collections of works in all departments of Theology, but is
especially rich in Exegesis and Church History. The students also have access to the
Carnegie Library, which is situated within ﬁve minutes’ walk of the Seminary buildings.

Two post-graduate scholarships of $500 each are annually awarded to members of
the graduating class who have the highest rank and who have spent three years in the
institution. A gymnasium and grounds afford ample opportunity for recreation.

All the buildings are located on West Park, one of the most beautiful residence
districts of Greater Pittsburgh.

The Way the Freshman Kept His Diary
Sept. 28—Arrived at Pitt. Wonderful school.

Sept. 29—The doctor said my back wasn't broken.

Oct. 2—Met a dandy co-ed at Fresh reception.

Oct. 3—Rah for Pitt; beat Westminister. It's nice to have my
watch again.

Oct. 4——Called on my co—ed friend. Her dad wears No. H’s.

Oct. I7—Forgot to write any this week. Who said “Wicked

Oct. 3l—Dickinson has a rotten team.

Nov. 7—I'm through with this diary. Won't keep another till

it any further, he did so in another book and kept it locked in his
trunk with his money

CHARLES BUNTING DAUGHERTY,

Jeannette, Pennsylvania.

Jeannette High School.
Varsity Track 2.

Football Squad 1, 2.
School of Pharmacy, 1914.
School of Medicine, 1918.

A scholar and a gentleman, as witness his ability to
worm credits from the Kaiser and his conversational ﬂuency
in the Kaiser's tongue. Very pepful. Paid his Junior
class assessment, in the barren desert of the Medical plebes.
Chronic scrub athlete. He could never make a varsity. but
hard plugging on the second is what keeps varsity athletics
on the map. So here's to "Chuck."

RALPH WHITNEY DAVIS,
Homestead, Pennsylvania.

Homestead High School.
Vice President Chemicalsociety.
Alembic Club.

We instinctively call Davis "a nice boy." In fact, it
might be said of him as of some department stores, "we
strive to please." The only thing we can't understand
about him is how he could come so unsullied from the same
town that Bill Crose used to inhabit. Ralph is going to
stick around for an advanced degree and then enter "indus-
trious work."

MARIE ELIZABETH DOLLMAN,
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

Ben Avon High School.
Young Women's Christian Association.
Women’s Activities Association.

A smile, a curl, a veil;
A cheek that's not too pale;
Coquettish eyes, watch out or you'll be caught.
The latest kind of shoes
And frocks with furbelows—-
Marie just lets us all know What is What.

She came, she saw, she conquered Pitt, but aside from
being a butterfly, the bee side of her nature is often visible.
and she can discuss the fourth dimension or the theory of
evolution, as well as the proper length of veils.

AGNES BERNADETTE DUFFY,
Crafton, Pennsylvania.

Crafton High School.
Tree surer French Club.
Newman Club.

"Longitude without latitude." From the time she en-
tered Pitt as a timid little Freshman, to the present, she has
made strides in every direction. Especially has she joined
the class of co-eds who like to "trip the light fantastic,"
for at the College reception, she showed us all how to fox-
trot. ” Bernadette weren't going to Pitt, Annette Keller-
man would have to look to her laurels.

EVINRUDE

Detachable Rowboat and Canoe Motors

HINK what fun you can have with an Evinrude this summer. Think of what it
means to be able to carry with you to lake, river or seashore a powerful little marine
motor that can be attached in a moment to any kind of craft—rowboat, sailboat,
houseboat or canoe—and that will run four hours on less than a gallon of gasoline. An
Evinrude cuts out the hard work of rowing—enables you to enjoy all the pleasures of motor
boating without the expense. Give the ﬂywheel a quarter turn and you are off at a speed
of from 7 to 8 miles an hour for a rowboat—l0 to I2 miles for a canoe.

The I915 model has Maxim Silencer, Automatic Reverse, enabling you to “back
water" instantly; and Waterproof Magneto built into the ﬂywheel—no separate battery re-
quired. Send today for free illustrated catalog and name of Evinrude dealer in your town.

Kneel right down before the maiden
And propose that you two wed?

No, you haven’t! Well you’ve missed it,
For you come to with a jar,

As you take the homebound car.

and professional skill developed by unusual facilities at the command
of the University serve as the basis of this course.

THE TRACK MAN.
It's great to be a track man "It's not so much the crowds, my boy,"
And run in real track shoes A track man said to me;
The crowds do cheer and urge you on— “The little girl in the cutest frock
You really cannot lose. Is the only one I see."

"At every turn I see her stand
And wave her banner high,
, That's my signal to put on steam
And win that race or die."

5. D. (his whole cognomen, by the way) took the "t"
from can't and exported it to McKees Rocks or some other
foreign isle. As a business man, he ranks right up with
the captains of industry, not excepting W. C. MacQuown
or H. 3. Downing. He hails from Crab Hollow, but even
at that we admit that he is very capable and unassuming.
But why argue? He admits it himself. He doesn't dis-
courage publicity, however, and likes to see his name in
the public prints as well as the next man. We like Flinn's
girl, so we won't say what we think, because 5. D. isn't

exactly batting .300 in the Royal Fussers' League, yet.

She has a genial smile which smothers everyone in its
warmth. She also has a clear straight-forward look at life.
Exams do not phase her. She would as soon take them as
not. She knows everyone at Pitt and they all know her.
(This is not mentioning that she has had more time in
which to get acquainted with them than anybody else.)
Helen has hosts of friends, and if she were not around,
numberless people would feel that there was a big omission
somewhere.

For those who were in History I. with her, she is always
"Henrietta," for Dr. Dyess called her that, and that she
remains. Henrietta always knew her history dates, but
they are the least of the knowledge she has assimilated in
the meantime. She is one of those rare beings one seldom
meets in college—a student. Still she has been known to
incur remarks from instructors for frivolous conversation.

"Jonner" did have his eyes turned in the direction of
that school near Beantown where they use the fat "3," but
methinks he has changed his mind. Good judgment, for
the poultry at Cambridge is really very ignorant of his be-
loved fox-trot. Then again. it wasn't such good judgment
to perform that all-too-popular stunt of graduating in three
years. But we congratulate the Seniors on their accession.
"Jenner" has migrated from Schenley Heights to Wilkins-
burg; from the heights to the hollow—quite a drop when
you haven't yet bought your light fall suit.

ALMA MATER

[AIR: AUSTRIAN NATIONAL ANTHEM.]

[GEo. M. P. BAIRD, '09]

Alma Mater, wise and glorious, »

Child of Light and Bride of Truth,
Over fate and foe victorious,

Dowered with eternal youth,
Crowned with love of son and daughter,

Thou shalt conquer as of yore,
Dear old Pittsburgh, Alma Mater,

God preserve Thee evermore!

First beyond the mountains founded,
Where the West-road opens free,
Where twin rivers forest bounded,
Merge and journey toward the sea,
In the dawning of the nation
Ere the clouds of strife had cleared,
’Rose Thy rough-hewn habitation,
By our prophet fathers reared.

Close Thy mother-love embraces

All who gather at Thy knee,
Castes and classes, creeds and races,

Mother, are as one to Thee;
Thou who unto knowledge bore us,

In the good old days long gone,
Raise Thy Cold and Blue high o’er us,

Lead and we will follow on.

Alma Mater, wise and glorious,
Child of Light and Bride of Truth,
Over fate and foe victorious,

Dowered with eternal youth,
Crowned with love of son and daughter,
Thou shalt conquer as of yore,

Dear Old Pittsburgh, Alma Mater,

Cod preserve Thee evermore.
A new tune for the Alma Mater hymn was recently

composed by Charles W. Scovel, '83.

Their merry voices blending.

STEIN SONG FROM “PRINCE OF PILsEN.”]

Come, brothers, sing the old song again,
Our paean to Alma Mater,
We who have followed Her beacon light
And marched ’neath Her banner fair,
Sing of Her fame in the days gone by
And the glory the years have brought Her;
Her colors we wear, Her honors we share,
Then sing till the winds reply:

Here's to our University,
Here's to Her Cold and Blue,
Here’s to Alumni and Faculty,
Here’s to Her Students true,
Here's to Her fame in years to come,
Bright shall Her laurels be,
Here's to Old Pittsburgh, the glorious,
Here's to old U. of P.

Our Old Pittsburgh, dear Old Pittsburgh
With love that never tires
Thy loyal sons in homage stand
About Thine altar ﬁres;
Though in the strife of after-life
Far from Thy shrine we be,
Our loyal hearts will ever burn
With love, dear Pitt, for Thee,
Our loyal hearts will ever burn

With love, dear Pitt, for Thee.

ectric Service

Almost every large manufacturing plant, office building
ﬂl and department store in Pittsburgh is now purchasing
electric service from us in place of maintaining separate
electric power plants. There are many reasons for this, but
the controlling factors are greater economy, higher efficiency,
greater elasticity, absolute freedom from smoke and elimina-
tion of the many annoyances incident to individual plant

operation.

If you have any power problem which is giving you
vexation, call Grant 4300, Contract Department, and
let one of our power engineers help you solve it. Our aim is

to give perfect electric service.

Hail to Pitt

[WoRns BY GEORGE M. KIRK, Col. '13.]
[Music BY LESTER M. TAYLOR, Eng. '12.]

Down in Smokytown, in Pennsylvania,
In Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh,
We have a University we’re all proud of,
Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, '
She stands a mighty fortress ’neath her colors
bright,
Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh,
When forth she goes to battle 'gainst a stub-
born foe
This song will upward go:

CHORUS:

Hail to Pitt! Hail to Pitt! every loyal son,
Hail to Pitt! Hail to Pitt! ’til the victory's
won,
The Gold and Blue shall wave forever
On high, through fair and stormy weather,
We’ll sing her praises far and wide
Until the end of time.
Hoop-hurray! Hoop-hurray for dear old Uni,
Give her a grand old Alleghenee—genac-genac,
We'll wave and cheer for many a year
And sing her songs out loud and clear,
For our University.

When the grand old days of football come
around,
In Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh,
Her rooters at the ﬁeld will make an awful
sound,
For Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh,
Down across the ﬁeld her mighty line moves on,
F or Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh,
They’ll sweep the foe before them till the goal
is won,
Then you’ll hear them shout:

If we were picking one word to describe him. it would
be "furtive." When he turns the battery of those large.
mournful, heifer-like eyes full upon you, it is too weep.
A while back he purchased tortoise shells to accentuate his
lugubrious optics. One of the six-year Meds who is still
very "pre." Bug expert.

BERNHARD ALEXANDER GOLDMAN, 1'IA<I>,
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

Junior Prom Committee.

"Berny," the battling, bouncing, biology boy. He was
always to the fore in such little matters as abductions,
eggings, hair-cuttings, and busted dances, and he still likes
to have his pudgy thumb in everything that promises ex-
citement. Cot cold feet the last minute before the Prom,
but dragged himself there chieﬂy because he was on the
committee. Belongs to the State Hall apron gang, but ex-
pects to do the biggest part of his dissection at Jelt.

doubtedly make the Pitt Weekly a much less depised and
much more hated sheet than its traditions warrant. Knows
enough to follow his own nose, which insures his reaching

He's a reg'lar man now, though you'd never have known
it to have seen him when he wore his green cap. He still
manages to keep fairly well up in the Registrar's Book of
Life, and amuses himself by declining offers to teach the
classics. But he has expanded in forty-’leven directions—
makes real campaign speeches, runs the Fresh baseballers,
educates the poor immigrant up to an appreciation of Keats,
and ﬁnds time, furthermore, to become a Victor catalog of
all the latest syncopations, and to frequently frequent the
polished ﬂoor.

in a manufactured product, emulation and envy are ever at work. Q] In art,
in literature, in music, in industry, the reward and the punishment are always the
same. ']The reward is widespread recognition; the punishment, ﬁerce denial and
detraction. illliwhen a man's work becomes a standard for the whole world, it
also becomes a target for the shafts of the envious few. l][If his work be merely
mediocre, he will be left severly alone—if he achieve a masterpiece, it will set a
million tongues a wagging. l]]_Iealousy does not protrude its forked tongue at the
artist who produces a commonplace painting. qlwhatsoever you write, or paint,
or play, or sing, or build, no one will strive to surpass or to slander you, unless your
work be stamped with the seal of genius. Q] Long, long, after a great work, or a
good work has been done, those who are disappointed or envious, continue to cry
out that it can not be done. 1]] Spiteful little voices in the domain of art were raised
against our own Whistler as agmountebank, long after the world had acclaimed
him its greatest artistic genius. l]]Multitudes ﬂocked to Bayreuth to worship at the
musical shrine of Wagner, while the little group of those whom he had dethroned

‘and displaced, argued angrily that he was no musician at all. C]]The little world

continued to protest that Fulton could never build a steamboat, while the big world
ﬂocked to the river banks to see his boat steam by. 1]] The leader is assailed because
he is a leader, and the effort to equal him is merely added proof of that leadership.

nothing. l]]If the leader truly leads, he remains—the leader. l]]Master-poet,
master~painter, master-workman, each in his turn is assailed, and each holds his
laurels through the ages. ‘J]That which is good or great makes itself known, no
matter how loud the clamor of denial. CJ]That which desires to live—lives.

ABRAHAM _HERMAN,
Pittsburgh,- Pennsylvania.

Central High School.
Drill Corps.

Probably few will ever just know how hard Abe has
worked to get his education, and how deserving a chap he
really is. Anyhow, by his industry outside of school hours,
he has earned the right to snore on Assembly days. Since
he acquired the nose-specs he is becoming actually distin-
guished, his untamed hair giving exactly the right Hellenic
touch to turn Herman into Hermes.

Defendant has been indicted under the following counts,
by persons not fully acquainted with him: (1) Slow;
(Z) studious; (3) inaccessible; (4) Handsome. In refu-
tation, we might pull the "still-waters-run—deep" stuit, but
just what is "slowness" anyway? To be sure, Ed doesn't
know everyone in the University, but we have a suspicion
that the other 99.44% are losing more than he is. He
thinks himself hopelessly dull, but he still answers to the
roll of the surviving fittest. Worst swear-word is "punk."
Cameras and co—eds testify to his guilt on the last charge.

MARY FOX JONES,
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

Central High School.

Secretary Classical Club.

She came from High School as an honor pupil, and she
is going through College as an honor student. Her story of
"Patsy" has made us all laugh and weep, for she is an
elocutionist, even though Dr. Holder intends to add her to
his Mathematics staff. in that line she is a bear. Mary
has one fault; she studies too hard. We recommend that
she should not let her work interfere with her pleasures.

ALBERT S. FRAZER KEISTER, <I>7.<I>,

Intimate friend and companion of John D. Rockefeller.
and other coal and oil "Barrens." He should have the
innate hereditament of a good politician, but has not as yet
made his rhaneau apparent in the Pitt ring. Aided and
abl:>(y)etted by those pink-checked Miller boys in the
Mines school, Keister is having the time of his life going
through Old Uni. A. S. F. is an adept at the "ﬂoor"
game, we understand, in addition to his other accomplish-

Who is this handsome cavalier who struts about the hall?
His clothes are blue, his stripes are new;
He's handsome, brave and tall.
With devilish eyes and debonair grace
His hand upon his heart he'd place,
And bow before us all?

She does like the rest of us, goes to class, takes notes,
forgets all she hears, and makes an A on the exam. She
is a true Pittite.

The incarnation of eﬂiciency in woman. Many a man
has been known to envy her uncanny knack for doing
things. None of your weak-kneed acceptance of a man-
made world for Auleene. Nothing less than a career
would do, and then not content with practicing in the
U. S. A., she picked out the farthest place she could ﬁnd
on the map, and is going to be a medical missionary. Which
is quite in keeping with the beautiful Christian spirit which
she sheds abroad.

PAUL AMMON MAXWELL,
Avalon, Pennsylvania.

Allegheny High School.
Glee Club 2.

"Max" is like Castoria—doctors pronounce it harmless.
When a green he had the exceedingly felicitous faculty of
evading every vestige of trouble. He scented the battle
from afar, and when the blood-thirsty sophs hove in sight
he was abwesend. As a high baritone, he got by the vigi-
lant eye of "_Iimmy'7 Martin, but as a first tenor—oh,
Ammon, how could you? Ever and anon, however, Paul
gets rid of an interrogation that would dismay the most
erudite.

"Lucky Thirteen."

She is not easily ruﬂled, sweet—tempered, and well brought

- up. Her family has made such a good job of the latter

that everybody looks to "Liyan" for all kinds of advice.
She has a most contagious giggle, which has led to the coin-
ing of the phrase, "Look out, she's starting again."
"I cannot cook, and round the house
I'm certainly not handy,
But I can dance the fox-trot and
The one-step simply dandy."

"Deac," one of the vestigial remnants of life. He got
on the Glee Club more through social prestige, it would
seem, than through cackling. He can wear a dress suit
now with perfect savoir faire, and at twenty-two, the blase
youth has seen all there is to be seen of the world and its
contents, even learning by experience that his upper lip is
none too fertile. But if you get beneath the surface, you'll
ﬁnd that loyalty and persistence are the ruling passions of
his disposition.

"Mac" is going to be one of those three-year anomalies,
but he recognized that he shouldn't leave the class of 'l6
Hat on its back without his picture in the Owl, and so we
are inclined to grant him absolution. He is the inventor
and patentee of the continuous "A," which suﬂiciently ex-
plains his scholastic standing. But the company he keeps!
He is at once the antidote for Heinrich Freundt and the
missionary from civilization to Jerry Black. His constant
wail is "four times at church every Sunday," but the re-
action is not so great as might be expected, at that.

Quite serious-minded. In fact. Jack is one of the ﬂy-
wheels of the class. He has one frivolous failing, though,
in common with all the rest of us. Did you notice that
Jack went out for the Glee Club one week before the P. C.
W. concert? Why? He says he likes to walk up Murray
Hill Avenue. So do we. We almost agree with him that
Dilworth and P. C. W. are about the best female dis-
pensaries of learning in the country, but is there a sem-
inary in Latrobe?

CHARLOTTE HAYS MILLER,

Greensburg High School.
Women‘s Activities Assot-iation.

"Maiden with the meek brown eyes." She is desper-
ately, enthusiastically, devotedly in love with chemistry.
But like all objects of admiration, it played her false.

There was a girl in our lab,
And she was wondrous gay.

She poured some HCI on zinc,
And set the stutt away.

A loud explosion followed soon.
Our friend was quick to go;
And now she's playing “safety first,"

To keep her out of woe.

MILDRED DOROTHY MORROW,

Girls’ Chorus.

A gay stretch of major, in time that is slow,

The smith at the anvil strikes blow upon blow.

A sad bit of minor, like wailing of wind,

A song to the girl that's left far behind.

A thrill in the treble, a crash in the bass,

Chords and arpeggios at double-quick pace;

A gay valse of Strauss, or a slow-creeping hearse,
is how Mildred Morrow makes pianos converse.

RICHARD PAUL NICHOLLS,
Fair Haven, Pennsylvania.

Donora High School.
Varsity Wrestling.
Class Football.

A weighty man—at least he'd have to wait a long time
for a wrestling championship if Joe Choynski were umping
the bout. Still he's to be commended for his staying qual-
ities in that desperate I45-pound class. To look at him,
you'd never suppose that he could be beguiled by the
daughters of Eve. But they do say that the height of his
ambition consists in buggy rides in the purlieus of Crafton.
He's forsaken Pitt to be a soldier-boy, that is, if they'll
let in such an unmilitary looking guy.

SAMUEL SCOTT NICHOLLS, A211,
Fair Haven, Pennsylvania.

Donora. High School.
Young Men's Christian Association.

Scott. now, otters a striking contrast to his kinsman, in
several respects. For one thing he seems to get away with
the co-educational sympathy a little more handily. He
formerly considered McKeesport the garden-spot of the
world in this connection, but lately has kept his pleasure
jaunts nearer home. With this diminution has come a
compensating increase of aplomb. He's an oﬂice-seeker
now, and his progress across campus is one of painful
dignity.

The front end sounds as it Bob were intended .for the
profession of fiction. But we believe it belies him. A man
who has the courage and persistency to wade through four
years of Group I. with unabated ardor, in these days of
eﬂiciency experts, Schools of Economics and elimination of
waste products, is certainly destined for a more exciting
modus vivendi than dispensing classics or becoming one
himself. If he could only throw off his Beacon Hill re-
serve once, he'd make an acceptable member of the hoi
polloi.

GEORGE EDWARD PARFITT, «i:BII,
Tarentum, Pennsylvania.

Tarentum High School.
Chemical Society.

George Edward just missed becoming a Dent this year,
but extracted himself by the grace of Providence. He's
one of the luminaries in that reagent gang that roosts in
Thaw Hall, and is never seen far from the vicinage of
"Cyclops" Koenig. Physically he approaches the Jess
Willard type, and used to have the rep of being quite hope-
lessly unswept, unshaven and unshorn.

MARGARET FEREDAY PATTERSON,

She has one very striking quality, viz: She will stand up
for her rights and remain standing "till the earth shall
crumble to ruin," or until she gets them, if necessary. If
she disagrees with an instructor, he is sure to ﬁnd that out.
for she will probably tell him so, and let him beware, for
Patty is truly terrible, when aroused.

C. Gerald is not the easiest man in school wherewith to
become acquainted. When you do, you ﬁnd a diamond of
many facets, with all that stone's well-known traits of hard-
ness and brilliancy, but without its corresponding trans-
parency. ln any c_ountry but America "Fife" would be of
the blood royal, but this is a democracy. He's a humorist
of some ability, as he himself can tell you. He used to be
musical. He is a lineal descendant of Joseph Home's.
with its modern methods. And he conﬁnes his feministic
activities to "The Burg."

THEODORE HOWARD PISCHKE,
Bellevue, Pennsylvania.

Bellevue High School.

He resembles our most distinguished ex-president. They
are both named Theodore. Also he has teeth and a jaw.
Other superﬁcial characters, as they say in biology, are a
polar bear sweater, and a thatch to match. But, even if
one were determined not to be prejudiced by these, his
generic title smites one in the jaw like a portion of a non-
censored cable from the eastern theater of war. Of course
it was wished on him, so we'll let him 03 this time.

THOMAS RYAN QUINN,
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

East Liberty Academy.
Glee Club 1, 2.

"Cute" is no word for it. Tommy is eminently ﬁtted,
both by phiz and articulation. for the oﬂice of king's jester.
Can you imagine him enveloped in a professional mien,
and practicing his calling upon an indulgent public? Neither
can we. Just to hear him diagnose a case of cirrhosis.
sciatica, or erysipelas would dispel the illusion. He admits
that he had no business doing it, but he stuck on that famous
harmony squad for two years. He is also a charter mem-
ber of the Oalzmont Summer Excursion Association.

LORRAINE EDWARD RAMSEY,
Carnegie, Pennsylvania.

Carnegie High School.

School of Medicine, 1918.

Since Red Riley, also of Carnegie fame, joined the
tooth-pulling brigade. Lorraine Lorraine Lorree has had a
solitudinous time of it. Ramsey came to Pitt touted as a
high school athlete of some skillfulness, but has refrained up
to this time from displaying samples of his style. He is
never so happy as when he has a sack of "Mail Pouch" in
his hip pocket and a cud of it in his cheek. He still retains
his ornamental pigeon-toed tread.

Author 1914 and 1915 Cap and Gown Shows.

Two years of the footlights ﬁnished Doc, but the evil
that he did lives after him. It seems a sacrilege upon the
muse to speak of him as the author of "lyrics," yet such
he is on the gold and blue stamped covers of the publica-
tions of Max Friedman and Co. And we're strong for the
extreme modernity of his dialogue. He abandoned his
medical career in order to facilitate collaboration with Gus.
The department of biology is thinking of creating an ad-
junct fellowship with nominal duties, in order that Norman
may live on, year after year, and write comedies for the

We wouldn't want to accuse Reemsnyder of deﬁciency
in the sense of humor, but certainly he is abnormal in
some respects. For instance, he is willing to sing bass in
a quartet; he is frequently caught with a tell-tale, faraway
look in his eyes, and again, he dislikes to accept money.
There may be ulterior reasons for these psychological hia-
tuses. He is wrapped up in his lifework—that of sky-
pilot somewhere not in the U. S. A., for which we honor
him. We have observed, further, that he is not backward
socially.

No! We shall not mention strings of any kind. But if
you were to ask us, we couldn't exactly call Guthrie R.
a bully or a pugilist, which, of course, are not desirable
things to be. For some time he was Scott Nichols' accom-
plice in crime, the crime being too frequent sojourning in
the Tube City. By sad experience, Reed has learned that
home is where the heart is. He is, furthermore, an exponent
of what the Reverend William Ashley Sunday calls a

"sissy game." This has no logical connection.

"Be careful of the maiden with the dreamy eyes." "She

Ralph's existence is bounded on two sides by politics
and prohibition, and all the way around by co-eds and
fussing. Senatorial elections and oratorical sprees furnish
the former, while social committees, "bb" games, sorority
parties, and Glee Club concerts provide an outlet for his
amatory tendencies. Spence claims that he gets the small
end of the deal in all three, but somehow he always comes
back for more. Some people class him along with cranks
and other geniuses, but when he gets his biennial haircut,
he is intensely human, after all.

Of course, he will always have enemies, and will always
be inconsistent. All great men do and are. A pillar of
the Y. M. C. A. necessarily does and is. He has such a
superabundance of red blood in him, that when he really
gets worked up, by the constant exercise of much breath.
the result is the well-known "purple-with-rage" eﬁect. Not
at all limited in the choice of his lady frens, either. He
has them scattered from Cleveland to Philadelphia. with

A shoe merchant from the word go. That's why his
boots are so well shod. And to use the same metaphor,
Napoleon's lieutenant is an habitual kicker. Comes from
"Chloe," or some such environ of Punxsutawney, but hates
to let people know it, and signs himself in a hotel register
as from the metropolis. States is one of the silent majority
of the I916 aggregation, but he has considerable latent
backing, and is biding his time awaiting the auspicious
moment for injecting himself into the mazes of Junior

On page 59 of the current catalogue we discover that
the late Charles Avery (whoever he might be) is the ben-
efactor for whom Turner and the rest of the Washington
bunch pray nightly, being responsible for the presence of
twelve good and true sons of Ethiopia in these classic halls.
Nor are we sorry that Mr. Avery did this deed. Frank
appears to be steering a steady course through our midst

Black is what a textbook of Composition and Rhetoric
would call a "character." He's so "distinctively individ-

He admits, however, that he knocks the honor system merely

GEORGE PRESTON ANDERSON, AZA,
Mercer, Pennsylvania.

Fredonia Institute.
Class Treasurer 3.

It was deemed wise to have a brave man guard the
mighty treasure chest of the class; therefore Mr. Anderson's
ascendency. it will give him experience for the future.

FRANK AMBROSE BANKS, ‘P9,
Kittanning, Pennsylvania.

Slippery Rock Normal School.
Grove City College.

Banks never ﬁnds time to bother anyone, and therein lies
the secret of his success. A good operator and a good
fellow.

JOSEPH FRANCIS BARRETT, .’E‘.\II<I>,
Hoboken, New Jersey.
St. Joseph's Academy.

Baltimore Medical College.
Newman Club.

Joe is the Xi Psi Phi fraternity at Pitt. Saw the light

Also possesses wrestling aspirations.

EARL F. B. CAMPBELL, AEA,
New Kensington, Pennsylvania.
New Kensington High School.
University of Michigan.

Class Football.

"Twin" keeps the bunch riled with "Wait, I've got a
new one." Denies copying them down when cracked at the
theaters. Lives so far from home he can make the trip only
once a year.

EARL CONLIN, ‘I19, Duquesne, Pennsylvania.

Duquesne High School.
Penn State College.

For some uncertain reason he was dubbed "Irene." Bids
fair to pass muster as a ﬁrst rate D.D.S. And "Ziggy" can
tickle the ivories, too.

WILLIAM ANDREW DUNN, AEA,
Chester, West Virginia.

Irondale High School.
University of Pittsburgh, Pharmacy.

When it comes to a basketball discussion, "Mother" can
tell you all about that awful bunch at W. and  They
don't do things over there to suit him A-tall. A big man
can do big things.

MALDEN JAMES FAST, AEA,
Fairchance, Pennsylvania.

Fairchance High School.
Uniontown High School.

Hardly as "fast" as all that; but why worry, for "I
don't give a kitty." Went on record as a loyal Pitt man
when he brought his brother here to school.

ROBERT B. FISHER, ~14),
Greensburg, Pennsylvania.

Greensburg High School.

There is one day in the year that Bob sets aside and that
is Hal|owe'en. Believed dentistry beat civil engineering.
and that's why he changed.

HYMAN A. FRANK, III‘<I>,
New Castle, Pennsylvania.
New Castle High School.

G. E. GETTY, \I1Q, Meyersdale, Pennsylvania.

Meyersdale High School.

Enjoys the enviable distinction of being retired from the

be quenched—in other words, "he has the dope."

ALFRED LOGAN GREGORY, AZA,
East Palestine, Ohio.

East Palestine High School.
Slippery Rock Normal School.
Ohio Northern University.

Came to Pitt with press agent accounts of being a foot-
ball player, but the fourth ﬂoor chop suey establishment
took up too much of his time.

NORMAN S. GRIFFITH, AZA,
Holsopple, Pennsylvania.

Southwestern State Normal School.

This fellow concedes that he is a tennis player. in fact he
admits it. It appears, however, that he should be reminded
that such a team exists at Pitt.

ROBERT LYSLE GRIFFITH, ‘I19,
Homestead, Pennsylvania.

Homestead High School.
East Liberty Academy.

All hail the "Duke." Adheres to the theory that the
world was not made in a day, so why hurry? Troubled
with an atrophied conscience, due to lack of use.

JAMES W. HAMMOND, AEA,
Ford City, Pennsylvania.

Ford City High School.
Grove City College.

Entered College as a meek, unassuming, purposeful
Freshman. Leaves it a care-burdened, trudging, struggling
Senior, and last, but not least—MARRlED.

Monessen High School.
Duquesne University.
Notre Dame University.
West Virginia University.

SENIOR
CLASS

EDWARD CHARLES HILGER, ‘I19,
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

Pittsburgh High School.
Carnegie Technical Schools.

"'Ho, did you see Abby?" Good guess, it's Eddie. A
quiet drone until he is stirred up. Then look out or you
Will be stung. Reported to have said "darn" once.

JOHN THOMAS KEISER, AEA,
Mars,. Pennsylvania.

Mars High School.
He is going back to Mars to show them how it is done

on Earth. His wail is that he is not fully appreciated by
the faculty.

ROY HUGH KERNOHAN, ~14), ATA,
Homestead, Pennsylvania.

Homestead High School.
Varsity Football 1.

quarrel a little, but not dangerous.

RUSSELL HARRISON KIRK, ‘I19,
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

Pittsburgh High School.

Glee Club Director.

Cap and Gown 1.

Commencement Program Committee.

If dentistry becomes a bore to Kirk, he can turn to the
stage, for he possesses "a very musical voice." Has a
classical air that is hard to beat.

HANNA KLOETZER, Asch, Bohemia, Austria.
Burgerschule, Asch, Bohemia.

The rose among the l9l5 thorns. Came all the way
across the ocean to a good University. Mining is all right,
but why not stick to dentistry?

FRANK R. LEIGHNER, AZA,
Mars, Pennsylvania.

Mars High School.

This lad is of a good disposition, and never known to
have been angry. After spending three years in the city he
will now stand without hitching.

CARTER HAMILTON LEWIS, ‘I19,
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

South High School.

Here is the City Guy with the real "down town dope."
His chief diﬂiculty is reaching the ﬂoor with his feet when
operating. Not a bad fellow for his size.

DENTAL
SCHOOL

SAMUEL LICHTER, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

Pittsburgh High School.
University of Pittsburgh, Medicine.

Here it is: "Bring them all on one at a time." Sam
knew what he was about when he jumped from medicine to
dentistry. Has no fears of society.

WALTER DUNCAN LOVE, AEA,
Falls Creek, Pennsylvania.

Falls Creek High School.
Grove City College.
Student Band.

All right but one knee. Yes, you might be able to tell
something about him from his name. An honorable student
who knows what he is at school for.

THOMAS RALPH MAGEE, AEA,
New Castle, Pennsylvania.

Geneva College.

"T. B." came from New Castle to engage in the war
upon caries. He has a bad disposition and little ambition.
Always starting trouble, but not a bad sort, at that.

EMANUEL GEORGE MEISEL, AZA,
Carrolltown, Pennsylvania.

President Dental Senate.

Vice President University Board of Control.
President University Chorus.

Dental Business Manager 1916 Owl.

Meisel is a very busy man outside of school. Worries
day and night over University constitutions, student activi-
ties and the like. Quiet and unassuming; therefore of a
political turn of mind.

HARRY CAMERON METZ, ~14), <I>A9,
Williamsburg, Pennsylvania.

East Liberty Academy.

Class Football 1.

Met: feels that he has a grievance regarding the new

able and inclined to get the very best out of his college
career.

WILLIAM HILGER MCKINLEY, ‘I19,
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

Pittsburgh Academy.
East Liberty Academy.
Newman Club.

"Wait until I use the telephone." Reputed to have worn
the first pair of dare-devil glasses in the Dental School, and
therefore should be court-martialed for all that have come
after.

SENIOR
CLASS

ALBERT B. NEWELL, ‘PS2,
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
East Liberty Academy. ’
Originally hailed from Mon. City, but since has become

a real city guy. Answers to "Abby." The simon-pure
essence of the never-worry idea.

LOUIS HARMAN NICHOLLS, AEA,
Fontabelle, Barbardos, B. W. I.

Combermere School.

Nicholls has courage. He left home in the far-off West
indies and came all the way to Pittsburgh to enlist in the
dental brigade. For all of which success is deservedly his.

PLUMMER ORVILLE NIXON, ~14],
Edmon, Pennsylvania.
Kiski.

Vandergrltt Preparatory School. .
Grove City College.

Just as slow as all "plumbers" are. Is a radically con-
servative thinker and talker. Can generally explain all if
you have time to wait.

CHARLES EDWARD OVERBERGER, AEA,
Patton, Pennsylvania.

Patton High School.
President Dental Senior Class.

"Will you brothers please keep quiet?" "Dutch" has a
hard time of it trying to maintain order at class meetings.
Finds that dentistry is really to his liking.

LORAINE LEON PAINTER, AEA,
Grafton, West Virginia.

Grafton High School.

Herewith we have a physiology specialist, but he is aw-
fully modest about it. Has beautiful hair and his ears are
not entirely out of proportion, either.

GLENN W. PEIFFER, AEA,

DuBois, Pennsylvania.
DuBois High School.
Class Football 1, 2.
Varsity Baseball 2.

ln "Pie" we have some pinch hitter. The greatest of

away. and there is no school on Sunday.

CHARLES SCHULER REESE, ‘I'D,
Warren, Pennsylvania.

Warren High School.
Belletonte Academy.
Varsity Football 1, 2, 3.

"Chuck" gets credit for being the best left-hand dentist
in the class. Would prefer afternoon sessions only, if .he

had his way. A fellow they all like.

RAYMOND J. ROBINSON, AEA,
New Castle, Pennsylvania.

New Castle High School.

Of course he's a Delta Sig.—he's from New Castle.
Somewhat inclined to let matters drift, and his correspond-
ence with the other sex is unlimited. Aside from that he
is first rate.

Pill working did not appeal to Alvin any too convinc-

"Ammy" came here from Kansas with a batch of rec-

abhors. But that didn't phase the Jayhawker any and he
made good with a vengeance scholastically, athletically and
then some. He is the Freshman idol, as he is their football

One of McKeeport's terrors. Came to Pitt from Tech

of ever having gone there. Suppose the Tech folks con-
sider it mutual. Really believes he will amount to some-

"Red" deserted the crew during last summer's vacation—
matrimonially speaking—but he is still one of the boys,
fortunately. He is a conservative theory shark and is
classifying his lectures for the day he takes a chair on the

ALBERT ADAM BRACKMAN, ~14),

Pittsburgh High School.
University of Pittsburgh, Pharmacy, Ph.G.

One of our several distinguished personages possessing
first-row qualiﬁcations. Claims inside information regard-
ing the future plans of our sole co~ed. Besides being the
leading theorist in the class. Bracky ﬁnds time to brush up
on the old Masters, generally being seen carrying a German
or French classic under his arm.

LEONARD I. CALIHAN, «I19,

Otterbein University, Westervilie. Ohio.

Disturbs the world with his impossible wit. A typodont

of relief experienced when this hies itself off to school. At
that, we hope to live and let live.

CALVIN C. CAIN, AEA,

Cain has a terrible time arguing momentous questions
with the boys in his corner of the lab. However, he is one

why he makes progress. A fellow who never loolrs at the

It was back in l9l I, when he was in Pharmacy School,

When it comes to having a big heart, Whitey‘: as as big

only bane of his peaceful existence is the fact that foot-
rests higher than his head are not furnished in the lecture
rooms. Really believes he can warble.

WILLIAM B. COULTER, ~14),

When a man feels that Morewood avenue is but a
pleasure jaunt from Crafton, then love surely is worth
while. But oh, should she ever hear Bill let loose in the

More generally late than "early." Hails from New

town's fair name ever happened. We have to put up with
it, too. but he seems harmless. Would like to be studious.
The unexpected often happens, and Early may amount to
something yet.

HARRY JAMES ECKEL, AEA,

Harry can elucidate on non-important topics better than
the best of them. At that he says he is capable of imbibing
a little knowledge now and then. First rate at ventilating

Came to Pitt touted as a dangerous basket ball artist.
Even now deigns to admit that the Dental Collegian: were

If Johnnie never makes good at dentistry, he, at least, has

Hickory contributes its leading citizen in the person of
"Dick, the Ferocious." A bear at plugging for exams. Has

Blew in from North Warren, but says he was there

Refuses to admit that Cain and McDiarrnid are human.

Here we have the book store representative who soaked

"Izy" is Mt. Union's horrible example. Convinced that

waste his time.

DELMAR A. SHELLENBERG, \IIS2,
Farrell, Pennsylvania.

Farrell High School.

"Shelly" come from Farrell. but you can hardly hold
that against the town. Still there is nothing here to feel
ashamed of, for this fellow is of a first rate brand. He
can't dance, but why worry, that's not dentistry. Has iinally
found a sysem of study and it looks as though he were
putting it to good use.

MERRILL LEIGH SMITH,
Centreville, Pennsylvania.

Townvllle High School.
Grove City College.

Pass him up girls, he's married, too. One of the orig-
inal Smiths, so there is no doubt as to his genealogy. Even
as the struggling serpent managed to get along, so does
Smithy, although it is hard for him to grasp the diﬂicult
subjects with his feeble brain. He tries hard. and that's
all anyone can do. '

JUNIOR
CLASS

FRED H. SWANSON, M2,
Youngstown, Ohio.

Massillon, Ohio, High School.
East Liberty Academy.

Here's to the president of the Mail Pouch League;
senior member of the prosthetic ﬁrm of Crubbins and
Stubbins; director of anti-theater club, etc. These are a
few of the many notable organizations in which he holds
membership. Withal, he finds time to write that letter to
Rockwood every day.

HOWARD E. SWARTZ, ~14),
Wilmerding, Pennsylvania.

Union High School, Wilmerding.
Shadyside Academy.
Pitt Freshman Baseball 1.

He is the second member of the notorious thug combina-
tion of Vogt and Swartz. Very delicate appetite. Rabid
dislike for the women. Feared that his slender build will
hamper his chances of being the cigarette ﬁend with Bar-
num and Bailey's circus again this summer.

JOSEPH BERNARD VOGT, ]R., \IIQ,
East Pittsburg, Pennsylvania.

California State Normal School.
University of Pittsburgh, Economics.
Pitt Freshman Baseball 1.

A student of exceptional destiny. A likely prosthetic
tutor. Joe contends that Dr. Black would never have made
a mistake had he ﬁrst consulted him. A live wire when
occasion demands. With his inlirmary coat on, he looks as
though he might amount to something.

D’ORR VOLTAIRE UREY, AEA,
Mercer, Pennsylvania.

Mercer High School.

With a name like that, one would imagine he was the
very old Nick himself. Urey says there is nothing to that
rumor" about he and Miss Schnurer. We all hope so, for
we gave her credit for knowing better. In a dissecting out-

ﬁt, D'Orr finds himself right at home.
