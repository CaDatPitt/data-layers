DEDICATION
In addition to his responsibilities as Head of the
Music Appreciation Department, Dr. Finney teaches
several classes. This picture, taken as he advises
Barbara Millen, illustrates his genuine interest in
his students.
"My better half" are the words "Pop" uses when
introducing Mrs. Finney. The dogs, "Munk" and
"Punk," as named by the choir, have long been a
familiar part of the Finney home.
Seldom does an afternoon go by when "Pop" doesn't
spend some time in the Tuck Shop conversing and
joking over a cup of coffee with his kids, the Heinz
Chapel Choir.

                                  All Pitt students look on registration time with fond thoughts--the crowds, the
                                  lines, the crowds and the lines. It is one of the few times in your life that you
                                  must stand in line to give your money away.
 PITT IN
The break-down comes! Every student
    carefully plans his schedule so that
    the hours are convenient and he's
    got plenty of free time in between.
After securing seven of the dozen class
cards he needs, he sadly finds out that
  Algebra 3 is offered only fourth hour
  and he had it scheduled for third...
  but that's impossible because English
  Lit is third hour which would mean
  taking French eighth hour six days a
         week... Oh, what's the use!
I0I
   The Vade Mecum is a small book put out
   by the WSGA for the women of Pitt. In it
   are listed all the student activities, their
functions, and purpose, a brief history of the
    University, and a calendar listing major
 events and goings on around Pitt. To every
     Pitt co-ed the Vade Mecum extends the
       friendly invitation, "Come with me."
Pitt starts the season's social whirl with an all
student mixer dance and from the looks of
things the mixation isn't bad at all. The purpose
of these get togethers is to help the new
freshmen and the transfers or out of town
students get acquainted with the general
population of Pitt and the opposite sex, of
course. Pitt is really just one big happy family,
and the mixer dance helps make it so.
        ducators proudly use pictures such as these
                   to point out youth's great craving for
                   knowledge. During the first week of
              classes when students are all in a hurry to
            get their text-books, the bookstore is truly a
            haven for the thin and small. You're a lucky
                    one if you come out as you went in.

The men have a chance to relax and
kibitz away from the din of the tuck
shop and class rooms up in the eighth
floor Panther Room. Ping-pong, card
playing, smoking and munching on
candy bars can be observed at almost
any time during the day. Sort of a
poor man's faculty club!
Pitt often starts celebrating before the game is
won as is the case at the pre-Pitt-Iowa Kickoff
Dance. The lovely young lady is receiving the
           doorprize of the evening: a football
   autographed by all the players and coaches.
     Perhaps the players would like the lovely
                            lady's autograph!
Billy Graham, the Evangelist, speaks to an
assembly of Pitt students at Foster Memorial.
This is just part of the University's plan to
present speakers of different creeds and faiths
to the student body.
Before the semester is hardly begun, you will find many students busy doing
reference and research work in the quiet sanctum of Pitt's library. Here students
are able to relax and study in the pleasant atmosphere of the Alldred Room.
     Another insignificant item that a Freshman
        discovers soon after entering Pitt is that
you've got to stand in line for almost everything
     -especially if you don't have a locker. It's
 amazing how you never walk out with someone
                                    else's coat.
Freshmen often find the quiet of the library a
startling contrast to the mass of jabbering
humanity that jams the elevator corridor.

               To the 1953 OWL staff,
                                     I was delighted when I heard
that you are dedicating the Year Book this spring to Dr. Theodore
M. Finney. From among my many respected friends on the faculty and
administrative staffs here at Pitt I can think of no one more richly
deserving of this honor. Nor can I think of a person who will be more
genuinely surprised, outwardly diffident, and inwardly tickled pink.
For here is one of the few individuals I know who can live successfully without any dualism in two worlds at once. He can be both
director and participant at one and the same time. He places a high
premium on motive and sincerity and in him are mingled in equal proportion joy of life and serious purpose, esthetic sensitivity and
practical performance, informality and propriety, camaraderie and
stern loyalty. Because it is part of his fiber, he can build music
and melody into the eyes, minds and hearts of his students. To the
Heinz Chapel Choir, as to his other students, he is a father, a
teacher, a companion, a human being. And to his associates he is
ever a willing, fair-minded, competent colleague. With ease he makes
teaching a complete way of life. Let me summarize by saying that I
am the better for having known Theodore Finney and am proud that he
is my friend.
               With best wishes to your publication, I am
                                  Very truly yours,
                                  Raymond F. Brittain

     The Pitt chapter of the national honorary
 Air Force fraternity, Arnold Air Society, is a fairly
 new organization. Yet, since its origin in the spring
 of 1949, it has developed with admirable rapidity.
 This year, the society, formerly known as Prop
 and Wing, again strove to promote better relations
 and understanding between the advanced students
 of the AFROTC and the ROTC Department
 Staff, to advance the military preparedness and
 protection of our country and to increase our
 knowledge of the scope and mission of the U.S.
 Air Force.
     Besides its official business, the Pitt chapter
organized a Christmas Dance and other social
functions including pledge smokers and picnics.
    The Air Society taps for members at the beginning of both the spring and fall semesters.
Qualifications for membership are a 2.o average in
ROTC and a 1.5 overall average in the University.

Scientists watch as student injects rabbit with serum.
    Under the watchful eye of President John
Deller, Beta Beta Beta members worked diligently
preparing histological slides for their use in research work. Tri Beta's spent a great deal of
their time in the Tri Beta room and to make it
more livable they decorated it with pictures;
collections of bugs, animals, plants, and bones
that only a science lover could appreciate; and
modern drapes to add a homey touch. Many of
the young scientists did extensive study and individual research work in bacteriology with some
unusual and impressive results.
    Tri Beta's social activities included an open
house and an initiation banquet in the fall and
spring, and student faculty smokers and general
business meetings.
    The feature event of the group was a weekend
field trip to the Pymatuning Laboratory of Field
Biology. At this scenic spot where nature's small
field animals, snakes, wild plants, and aquatic
life live in freedom... until they arrive, the young
biologists were quite at home. For three days
they hunted, fished, collected, dissected, and discussed their personal discoveries... and then the
long road home for happy Beta's.
With squinted eyes Tri Beta's examine insects.

     What do the egg, sunburst, and dart sym bolize in the ceiling of the Greek Room? Whose
 picture hangs in the Scottish room? What do the
 colors signify in the front windows of Heinz
 Chapel? Exactly what happened the night the
 English Room was dedicated? For the answers to
 these and many other questions, ask a Cwen. This
 year every Cwen was a Nationality and Heinz
 Chapel Hostess.
     The social season of the Cwens included a
Christmas supper, Founder's Day Tea and a
party with the alumnae.
    Alpha Phi Omega and Cwens worked together
this year to put out an extra special Student
Directory. For the first time the boys' names were
put in the directory and also their telephone
numbers. That gave everyone a fair chance. In
November the halls were filled with students,
arms loaded with directories, stopping everyone.
"Buy a Student Directory," "Find out her phone
number." There were results. Shortly after the
directory publication telephones buzzed continuously as Pitt's social life progressed... thanks to
Alpha Phi Omega and Cwens.
  Cwens anxiously await elevators to take them to classes.

    The initiation  banquets of Delta Delta
Lambda at the Royal York in November are
traditional at Pitt. Every year DDL, the honorary
Business Education Fraternity, pledges outstanding scholars in this field. They have faculty
speakers, honored guests, and alumni at their
large affairs and social gatherings.
    Every year at Christmas the members have a
party at one of the sorority houses on campus.
This is an informal get-together where they exchange presents and have good things to eat.
    The future teachers of Business Education
have regular meetings and always have speakers
who are eminent in their respective field. "Do
you think the new type of shorthand is better
than the old Gregg method?" or "Have you seen
the new accounting books of high school students?" are some of the ideas and discussions
among the DDL members.
    After the Delta Delta Lambda "Open House"
plans are made, members invite all the department students to the affair. In this way they be-                                   a

Druids are quite proud of their plaque on the
8th floor-Jay Garber (with his back to you)
is studying the plaque very thoroughly.
All smiles, the Druids take time out to enjoy themselves-but what's this Mort Goldstein is hiding under the palm of his hand?
    Dick Beck started the ball rolling by casting
his vote for shrimp, french fries, and cole slaw.
"Steak, peas, and french fries," said Jay Garber.
With thoughts of Thanksgiving on his mind Bob
McGuire added turkey, mashed potatoes, corn,
and stuffing. Suggestions were flying like hotcakes!
What would the Druids serve at their annual
initiation dinner dance? Everything but the food
question had been settled weeks ago. The dance
was planned for December 12 at the Penn Lincoln
Hotel. Just the thought of all this food ended the
meeting and sent the boys scurrying to the Tuck
Shop for a coke and sandwich.
    Further discussions of the boys concerned
how they could encourage the students' support
of campus activities such as Political Week and
the Pitt Chest Fund. Druids played Sir Galahad
by ushering at many affairs and took active parts
in Spring Festivals, Tap Day, and other big
events. Ever anxious to promote scholarship,
Druids kept up their fine record.

    The Lambda Kappa Sigma girls are all
learning how to bake cookies, cakes, pies and
fudge. No, not a home economics course, the
members of the pharmacy sorority just decided
that they wanted to remodel the girls' lounge at
Pharmacy School. Since there isn't a Tuck Shop
at Pharmacy School, the bake sales provide the
students with in-between-classes snacks and
serve a double service.
These girls obviously enjoy the thought of devoting theii futures to prescriptions, powders, and pills.
    Every year the active members sponsor an annual alumni banquet for graduates at the Sheraton
Hotel in February. They present skits concerning
the pharmacy profession and in general, promote
good relations with the alumni chapter. Another
annual party at the end of the school season is a
farewell banquet for the graduating seniors. The
girls all recall freshman days, organic chemistry
tests and the different types of toothpastes that
they mixed up during their many long hours in lab.
    At Christmastime, Margaret Sherwood and
the other girls are busy planning their formal
dance and party at one of the local hotels. The
theme is usually in keeping with the pharmacist
and his line of work from a girl's point of view.
    Since the girls at pharmacy school are definitely in the minority, they all find lasting friendship and enjoyment in working with their Lambda
Kappa Sigma sisters during their four years of
college life.
Marian Mallinger stirs prescription as her co-students check
ingredients and procedure.
A smile with every cup of tea.      Smiling faces, filled table, gay decorations; must be a good

    Members of Mortar Board, the national
honorary for outstanding senior women, strive to
foster leadership, honor learning, and render
service to the University. Conscious of the need
for participation in the privileges offered in a
democracy, the Mortar Board members designed
and had printed birthday cards which they sent
to all the Pitt women on their twenty-first birthday. In addition to congraitulating the women, the
cards reminded each girl of her duties as a citizen.
    This year the Tech chapter of Mortar Board
graciously entertained the Pitt girls at Carnegie
Union. During the informal program and serving
of refreshments, the two groups found they had
many common interests.
    Mortar Board members are known for their
dinner meetings; over recipes and hot coffee the
girls shared their thoughts and problems, both
school and national. And at the close of each meeting with the singing of "Taps," the girls knew
that they had been bound together once more in
the bonds of Mortar Board.

    Each year Omicron Delta Kappa recognizes
college men who have attained high standards in
all phases of collegiate life.
    During the last few days of school in May,
everyone is asking the same question, "Who do
you think will make ODK walk this year?"
    ODK singles out and rewards the senior man
who has done the most in his four years at Pitt
to further ideals of the organization and his name
is inscribed on the ODK walk.
    This year Joseph A. Marasco, Jr. served as
president; Lud Lippert, Vice President.

     Having a Grand President of a fraternity
 right on campus might cramp the style of many
 fraternities but not that of the Pi Delt's at Pitt.
     Under the watchful eye of Dr. Robert X.
 Graham, head of Pitt's Journalism Department
 and Grand Prexy of Pi Delta Epsilon, these big
 wheels of Pitt's publications made the'52 and
'53 semesters two of the biggest in their history.
     At their regular dinner-meetings their speakers for the past year were tops and the food more
delicious than ever.
     But not content with just getting together
at dinner meetings the Pi Delt's sponsored a gala
party at North Park.
    Too, there was their Founder's Day and the
annual National Convention in April with the
members of Pi Delta Epsilon bubbling with enthusiasm over both.
    But uppermost in their plans is the Publications Lounge to be on the eighth floor for all
publication workers.

     Only junior and senior students at Pitt who
have maintained outstanding scholarship and
scholastic records during their four years are eligible for Pi Tau Phi membership. The honorary
scholastic fraternity is mainly made up of undergraduate students and has included in recent
years graduate students who meet the active
membership requirements.
     In the fall and spring semesters the group
welcomes new members at traditional initiation
banquets. They have regular business meetings
bi-monthly and informal social gatherings to
build group fellowship and participation.
    Membership in Pi Tau Phi is truly a challenge to any undergraduate student. The organization recognizes intellectual leadership and is
advised by Dr. Richard Hyde.
    The object of the bi-monthly meetings of
Pi Tau Phi can perhaps best be explained by the
following excerpt from the preamble of their
constitution: "We the members of Pi Tau Phi,
do hereby band together to conserve and spread
scholarship, culture and idealism... always
striving by all sound methods to stimulate sound
thought and true intellectual standards."

     Quo Vadis is an honorary sorority that taps
 its members from the group of women, who as
 student hostesses work to interpret to the public
 and the student body the spirit and ideals of the
 Nationality Rooms.
     These girls are very busy with their many
special projects. They are our University hostesses.
You may see them pouring tea in the Commons
Room any day of the week. It is through their
hard work that the Commons Room gets its
beautiful decorations for Christmas and other
holidays.
     There is a busy social season planned for
this year. It includes dinner on the twelfth floor in
March and a tea with the Nationality Room
hostess guild. Besides these major affairs, the
members of Quo Vadis, cooperate with various
committees of the Nationality Rooms in planning
their social affairs.
    The sorority fosters understanding of the
culture of the individual nationality groups, and
instills an understanding of the interdependence of
nationalities.
    If one day you hear a girl explaining, "This
wrought-iron work came from the 1939 New York
World's Fair," you will know it's one of the Quo
Vadis girls fulfilling her job as Nationality Room
Hostess.

      Scabbard and Blade is the only national un  dergraduate honorary society of its kind. On the
  Pitt campus, the organization honors above av  erage students in advance corps.
      The major purpose of Scabbard and Blade is
  to promote and reward efficiency in the training
  of the reserve officers and to assist and support
  the Military Department of the school. Twice a
  year the members "hit the deck" early in the
  morning to have an initiation breakfast for their
  new pledges. This gives all the ROTC boys an
  idea of real military life.
     Scabbard and Blade is always one of the
 sponsors of the big Military Ball in January. This
 year, Charlie Spivak played sweet music while the
 oniformed men waltzed their dates on the ballroom
 floor of the Georgian Room in the Webster Hall
 Hotel.
     Every semester the group sponsors interfra ternity events with Pershing Rifles and the Arnold
 Air Society. These included smokers, Korean war
 movies and athletic competitions. Another spe cial event this year was the banquet to initiate
 Major Horey McCartney as a faculty adyiser.
 The many activities of Company D of Scabbard
 and Blade kindled a strong spirit of comradeship
 and deep respect for fraternity ideals this year by
 cooperating and working together.

   students who have the ability to understand and
   speak the modern languages with a great deal of
   ease. This is hard for most students to understand
   because of the difficulty that the majority of them
   have in mastering a language in high school or
   college.
       Christmas season is Sigma Kappa Phi season.
  They have a program for their members and pre  sent skits, dances, and customs of the different
  countries whose languages they speak.
       An open house in the spring gave the Sigma
   Kappa Phi an opportunity to entertain high school
   students and the Pitt student body. The evening
   was devoted to plays, speeches, and song recitals
   all presented in a foreign language.
       Also in the spring is the initiation of the new
   tapees. The members qualify for membership by
   entertaining the old members with a foreign lan   guage skit... and then they have a banquet,
   speaking English in the dinner conversation.

     Once a month on the bulletin board at State
Hall there is a notice for all Sigma Tau members.
Meeting only once a month this honorary fraternity promotes higher scholastic achievements
among the engineering and mines students.
     The fraternity does not have a house or a
regular meeting room and yet they are one of the
most active honoraries on the Pitt campus.
Twenty-two actives and twenty-two pledges
comprise the group of engineers under the leadership of Donald Gardner.
     "The West is all right, but I'll take Pittsburgh
any day," at least that is what Don Gardner told
his brothers after his trip to Wyoming this October. Don attended the biennial meeting for all
Sigma Tau presidents at the University of Wyoming. He came back to Pantherville with loads
of new ideas and the lingering enthusiasm that
goes with fraternal conventions.
    Now the Sig Tau's are planning to have regular meetings in a local restaurant. They are also
planning another big project that will take a long
time... but it's in the secret stage now.
    December 15, pledges of Sigma Tau were
honored at a banquet and social evening provided
by active members. There are two initiation banquets a year and two "get-acquainted" smokers
for both actives and pledges.
Four Sigma Tau's make final check on homework before enter-       Four engineers combine knowledge to solve problem as one
ing class.                                             Sigma Tau attempts to do it alone.

    When the Florence Nightingales of Sigma
Theta Tau plan a program for the year they really
make it something special. They began with a
delightful Founder's Day Tea in October and just
six days later they heard a well-known nurse speak
at their program meeting.
    A theater party at the Pittsburgh Playhouse
and a Christmas Party rounded out the year of
1952 for them. But soon after the new semester
began, the Sigma Theta's presented Dr. M. C.
Elmer, who spoke on "Human Relations."
    Their initiation banquet was at the Faculty
Club in March. In April was their card party
and finally in June, their initiation tea.
    As they have don'e every year since their
founding.at the University of Pittsburgh in 1946,
the Sigma Theta's provided a scholarship for a
pre-nursing student in the College at Pitt and
honored a graduating nurse with a special award
on Scholar's Day.
Meetings aren't all work for members. Nurses take time out for      Over dessert, Sigma Theta Tau's anxiously plan their forthFounder's Day Tea.                                   coming Christmas Party.

Phi Beta Kappa
    On the afternoon of January 19 in the English
Room, Xi chapter of Phi Beta Kappa, national
honorary scholastic society, was installed at the
University of Pittsburgh. The installation was performed by Dr. Goodrich C. White, president of
the United Chapters of Phi Beta Kappa. According to the Phi Beta Kappa handbook, in the establishing of new chapters, emphasis is placed
'not on quantitative measurements but rather
upon the spirit of a college, the quality of its work,
and the achievements of its graduates." Much of
the credit in having the chapter established is due
to the seventy-five members of the Pitt faculty
who represented Phi Beta Kappa chapters from
forty-four colleges. These faculty members were
the grantees of Xi chapter and were active in its
formation. The installation of Xi chapter not only
brings honor and recognition to the University,
but is a stimulus and an encouragement to students and faculty alike.
    Members who were initiated in January into
Xi chapter of Phi Beta Kappa are:

        LL OF US here at the University, our University family
        (students, teachers, administrators, alumni, the office personnel,
        the men and women who keep our buildings and grounds
        beautiful) are held together in one common set of aims and
        purposes, which have as a major objective the idea of helping
        build a life that is rich in meaning, happy and successful,
        materially and spiritually. With this ideal in mind the University
        has the following purposes and aims: to draw out, cultivate,
        excite, and inspire the full development of each student; to create
        an atmosphere in which students will learn to think; to help
        students establish values through intimate acquaintance with the
        humanities, the arts, the natural sciences, the social sciences, and
        religion; to develop the character of students-integrity, honesty,
        judgement, cooperation, friendliness, and good-will; to create a
        community of scholars where research, curiosity, free inquiry, and
        discovery advance knowledge; to provide competent, well-trained
        professional leadership for one of the world's most important
        industrial areas; to prepare men and women for citizenship in a
        democratic nation where freedom and liberty go hand in hand
        with law and justice and where responsibility, national and
        international, is a characteristic of the individual.
ELLOR'S MESSAGE
      To carry out these purposes the University has established
      standards, programs and facilities, a distinguished faculty,
      capable students, a campus with useful and inspiring buildings,
      strong and appropriate courses of study, support of research
      programs, help to the student in planning a career, support of
      student organizations and sports, and the integration of the
      University with the community around it. All these ideas and
      plans have grown with the University through 166 years and all
      of them become realities through the loyal co-operation of our
      students.

The University of Pittsburgh is world famous for its many Nationality Rooms. An extension
of this idea was the miniature model United Nations Conference held in October. During this
conference many discussions and debates concerning critical and timely issues such as the "Racial
and Religious Problems of British and French West Africa" were carried on. Students from foreign
countries presented the viewpoints of their countries.
                                                                 An All Nations Tea was held in the
                                                                 afternoon in the Commons Room after
                                                                 one of the assemblies. Nationality Room
                                                                 Hostesses served as guides and helped
                                                                 with the reception. Looks good!
Each year in honor of the freshman women and
their Senior Mentors the YWCA presents the
Caritas Ceremony in Heinz Chapel. Through
pantomime great women are presented who
through the years have made their act of loving
kindness toward better human understanding.
The women portrayed such as this Queen
Esther symbolize the best of life.
   Just back from te cersers and bureau of
   rehabilitatio  is the ejuvenated Panther.
The student went fiftyffty orheir opinions
  as tk   her the cha    w   better or not.
     Some    e hear  in teir acclaim of the
candid view o he campus; others as much as
expressed a desire to have their quarter back.
Only the freshman women can possess such careless abandon, such complete detachment from the
rigors and cares of knowing what exam week means; only at a Freshman Sing could such
expression find an outlet. The enthusiasm of.these co-eds is just one example of the great
contribution freshmen make to school spirit in joining in the singing and learning of school songs.
The look of consternation is the result of the Freshman
    Women's Orientation Exam. The exam is made up
       and given by members of the WSGA's Customs
  Committee and is part of the orientation program for
    new co-eds to introduce them to Pitt life and make
                    them a part of it. Hope you pass!
When a co-ed answers all the questions on the history of
the University, and knows all the cheers and Pitt songs,
she is rewarded with a Panther pin. Once a girl receives
her Panther pin, she no longer must wear that "red
badge of courage": the traditional green arm band.
The women are not the only ones that have to
take an orientation quiz. The Dean of Men's
Office sees to it that no one gets away with
anything. Note the somewhat sadistic smiles on
those who have been through this before!
        The orientation program is no laughing matter
           to the freshman, but by the time Halloween
           approaches-even the much teased "froshie"
             is able to bob for apples and still come up
                                            smiling.
That exam is not as easy as it looks. I
wonder if the boys who make up these
custom perplexers help the "profs" make
up their exams?
  All aboard! Bus leaving for the Pitt Army game...   There's a familiar saying that "nothing can stop the
  and what a game! Pitt's dynamic offense despite the  Army Air Corps," but when rally happy Pitt students
absence of four of the key players from the line-up was take the "sergeant in arms". No ROTC today!
      enough to draw praises from even the New York
                                            critics.
   The ROTC is not the only thing that is disrupted
 when Pittites go all out in their celebration of Pitt's
   upset over Notre Dame. A victory march up Fifth
Avenue and over to Carnegie Tech snarls up traffic--
                  who cares... We won didn't we?
Even the Mayor of Pittsburgh and Chancellor
Fitzgerald help the Pitt Panther organize a rally of the
student body to celebrate Pitt's romp over Notre Dame.
It seems as if all of the University has gathered in the Commons Room when second hour is
called off so that the students can celebrate the Pitt-Notre Dame game in true fashion. The
support that was given to the team and its wonderful coach, Red Dawson, never faltered, and
every stomping foot and every cheering voice in the big hall held hopes of a "Bowl Bid."
The serious business of the 1952
Presidential election invaded Pitt full
force. Committees of Young Republicans
and Young Democrats worked together
to provide all the students with
information on all the candidates.
Booths were set up in the Commons Room so
that the voter could fully enjoy all the privacy
  he or she was entitled to. The position of the
    feet does not indicate whether the voter is
                    Republican or Democrat.
When the ballots were all in and duly counted
by Senior Court, Dean Rush and her staff, the
mock election gave Ike a 252 vote edge over
Stevenson. Presidential pollsters may do well to
heed the slogan "As Pitt Goes, So Goes The
Nation"... the Pitt returns came closer to the
actual plurality than any one of the professional
poll takers!

     The purpose of the Air Force Reserve Of ficer's Training Corps is to train cadets in the cus toms and requirements of a well-rounded officer
 in the U.S.A.F. To accomplish that purpose, in structors who are officers and airmen selected by
 the Air Force, teach cadets such basic subjects as
 World Political Geography, Drill, Exercise of
 Command, Leadership, Aerodynamics, Propul sion and Applied Air Power. Upon successful
 completion of the first two years of the course,
 cadets may enroll in the Advanced Course in
 which subjects taught are in the fields of Adminis tration and Logistics, Flight Operations, and Con trollership.
     The AFROTC program is designed to pro vide the student with a balanced course of officer development training and officer-career training,
 both theoretical and practical. This in conjunc tion with his academic curriculum will qualify
 him to discharge all duties and responsibilities
 which may be required of him as a junior officer
 of any component of the Air Force, without fur ther formal schooling.

     The aim of Alpha Omega, a national dental
fraternity, is to further the professional aims of
all its brothers. A comprehensive program of
extra-curricular clinics is given by men outstanding in the various fields of dentistry-prosthodontia, exodontia, orthodontia, periodontia. In
addition sound movies on technique and other
dental data are used. In keeping with the fraternity's emphasis on scholastic attainment and
devotion to career, each year it presents an award
to the senior in the School of Dentistry who has
attained the highest scholastic rating. The social
program is well filled and integrated with the professional-clinical schedule. Most outstanding of
the association's annual events are a barn dance
held each October and an active-alumni dance
which enables the graduates to keep in close contact with each other. In May the fraternity holds

    For the second consecutive year Alpha Beta
Gamma has one of the largest memberships in the
history of the sorority at Pitt. Over one hundred
active members sparked the professional elementary education sorority on to an exceptionally
active year. The purpose of the sorority is to
promote unity among the students of elementary
education, foster a wider social and cultural life,
           The president of this education frat, Laura Cooper,
           from right, must have told another one of her witty tale
and promote fellowship between faculty and administration. A large Christmas party for members, a square dance, and a picnic provide ample
entertainment for the year. At monthly meetings
speakers such as G. A. Yoakum and George W.
Hoffman provided the insight into actual classroom experience for the future educators.
     In 1904 Alpha Beta Gamma was founded on
 Pitt's campus. From the small nucleus of women
 in the school who then planned to teach in the ele mentary schools, the sorority has steadily grown
 to its present capacity membership. This is an
 indication of the sorority's ability to recognize the
 changing needs of its members on campus in the
 passing school years.

is the aim of the Alpha Tau Delta Sorority, professional sorority for nursing students formed at
Pitt on May 12, 1945. In the month of December
pledging followed a busy rushing period. The
rushees were entertained at two informal rush
parties. The main social affairs of the year were
two formal annual dances sponsored by the sorority in January and May. ATD meetings include interesting discussions about new medicines
and progress in the fields of nursing and medicine
as well as prominent speakers.

Erickson, Marie Gnus, and Dorothy Mereness,
President Betty Geiger and the sorority sisters do
much to further the friendship among nursing
students.

Pharmacy students don't always have to attend classes. But
even when they're out of class, they discuss pharmacy.
    Alpha Zeta Omega invites to membership
pharmacy students approved by the Dean of the
School of Pharmacy. Founded at the Pittsburgh
College of Pharmacy in 1926 as a national organization, the fraternity now consists of twentythree chapters. In serving as a means of promoting
interest and a spirit of good fellowship among
fraternity brothers, AZO provides for a yearly
award to the pharmacy student who has attained
the highest scholastic achievement in his freshman and sophomore years. The second special
project is the support of the Bernard L. Cohen
Memorial Fund, a student loan fund established
by Mu Chapter. The organization also contributes
to the AZO National Culture Fund. Meetings
throughout the year bring together graduate
pharmacists and undergraduate students of pharmacy.

     The student affiliate of the American Chemi cal Society has made rapid strides in the aims of
 its parent organization, the American Chemical
 Society. To become a full fledged member of ACS
 a college degree is necessary, but, nevertheless,
 students can take advantage of the facilities open
 to the graduate members. Events have included
 movies, talks, and tours through plants. The re gional meeting was held this year and was con ducted on the same basis as the meetings of the
 parent organization. This session had representa tives from all student ACS chapters in this area.
 The student chemists read original research pa pers. With reorganization in mind, more new
 members have been recruited. This is also the
 second year for the first ACS newspaper ever
 written at Pitt. With more interest and more
 members, Pitt's chapters of ACS has gone a long
 way in promoting chemistry among students.
Chemistry students are very careful when measuring in any
quantity. At State Hall they practice what they learn in lectures.

     On March 8, 1952, the American Institute
of Chemical Engineers' student membership section celebrated its second birthday. In spite of
its short time on campus, however, the organization has upheld its purpose-to promote and further the professional organization and interest in
the chemical engineering field. One way in which
it has done so is the yearly presentation of an
award to the outstanding sophomore in the field.
In the Seminar's program this year, was the use
of moving pictures and of professional speakers.
In its first year the group heard such noted
speakers as Dr. H. C. Carlson of the University
faculty and Mr. W. M. Gerson of E. I. duPont de
Nemours and Company, Inc. Also stimulating
were the seminar's field trips to various plants in
the area. Last year included in the tour were the
Schenley Distillery and the Duquesne Brewery.

     The goals of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers Seminar are: to encourage young
electrical engineers, to keep the students in close
contact with the practicing field, and to keep the
AIEE's abreast of the latest developments.
     In 1915, five seniors, representing the entire
class of the School of Electrical Engineering at
Pitt, attended the first seminar of the AIEE. Since
that time the seminar has steadily grown into
one of the most active seminars. The student
representation in the chapter this year is near the
two hundred mark including all juniors and seniors
in the school.
    The members attend weekly seminar meetings, being granted one-half a credit toward graduation. At these meetings, movies, lectures, and
professional speakers are featured.

The teacher-student relationship is one tradition carried down through the centuries intactfrom the medieval universities to those of
today. Here Dr. James Tze-Chien Liu, of
the history department, preserves tradition,
informally, with his students in the Tuck
Shop.
At Pitt, too, the faculty can never grow too
far from the students. Crowded as we are in
elevators, halls, thrust skyward in one great
building, men and women, students and
teachers, all are part of life at Pitt. The Owl
camera has here caught Professor James C.
Craig, School of Education, in the elevator
shuffle.
With campus activities centered as they are
in the Cathedral of Learning, men from the
other buildings, State and Thaw and Alumni, must perforce spend a good portion
of their days walking. Faculty, students, all
make the trek, as does Robert Bonn, Instructor in Civil Engineering, uphill to
State.

     Actually, the American Institute of Industrial
Engineers seminar is a combination of two organizations-The Mechanical Engineers and the
Institute of Industrial Engineers. Merged as one,
the organization has two purposes: to keep the
members informed on the advances in the engineering field, and to help the students get the feel
of industry. The Seminar of Industrial Engineering celebrates its birthday simultaneously with
the school of Industrial Engineering. Both date
back to the inception of industrial engineering at
Pitt. Relaxing at numerous smokers where everything from football to industry is discussed is a
favorite pastime of the engineers. In the spring
semester, seminar members all attend the annual
Senior banquet. Later, the same month, the members and their dates sponsor a picnic party for
the association. Finishing their social season in
grand engineering style, the men, in conjunction
with the Engineering and Mines Association,
plan the Cinderella Ball.

     The Civil Engineering Seminar at Pitt does
not stick to the theory of all work and no play.
Aside from the regular curriculum, the members
of ASCE sponsor picnics for association members
and their dates, plus numerous parties. These
social events help the seminar members to become
well acquainted with each other. Once every week
finds ASCE members attending meetings. Here a
member can hear questions and discuss problems
pertinent to the field of Civil Engineering. Leading
men in the civil engineering field are present to
answer those questions and to aid in solving
problems. At the various field trips held during
the school year seminar members had the opportunity to observe civil engineers at work. The
ASCE Seminar at Pitt is not only important in
subject matter but also interesting in its social
calendar. Through its closely integrated program
of study and relaxation, the engineers achieve an
adequate scholastic background and a strong
spirit of fellowship that are excellent preparations
for their future careers.

This chapel at Fort Lee, Virginia, is a fine example of the
religious services offered to army men.
    The mission of the Army Reserve Officer's
Training Corps is to develop army leaders from
the undergraduate men of the University. The
ROTC course presents two basic plans which
specifically offer preparation for commissions in
the Quartermaster and Engineer Corps. However,
a student who is anxious to win a commission in
some other corps may attend the summer camp
of the branch in which he is interested. Under this
arrangement, members have also been commissioned in the Signal Corps, Infantry, Finance and
Part of the training involves classes in study of town fortifications. Here the men examine a miniature town.
Ordinance Corps.
  During the past summer a number of Pitt
students, in attendance at the various Army training camps as a part of the ROTC curriculum,
were singled out for honors as outstanding cadets.
Among them were Steve Stasko, Eugene Cooper,
Edwin Leaf, Robert Scott, and Francis Pauley.
The ROTC course offers the most direct route to
a commission in the armed forces for the young
man who wishes to prepare himself for positions
of responsibility in the service.
The army likes to do things the hard way-Pitt ROTC men
carry out this belief by climbing a lattice rather than use the
first floor doorway!
Shoes play a vital part in the dress of army men. These are

Friday, November 7, I952, the E and M's held a dance at West
View Park. Most of their school turned out for it.
     The Engineering and Mines Association is
one of the important organizations up on "the
hill." Every fall, each engineering seminar at
the University of Pittsburgh, plus the sophomore
and freshman class select two members to form
the cabinet. This group of men comprises a student congress for those students who spend so
much of their school time in the engineering buildings. All of the seminar members praise the E and
M cabinets, past and present, for the many conveniences installed at State Hall for their use.
The candy and coke machines, and well furnished
lounge provide a special Tuck Shop atmosphere
for the engineering students. Main events on
the social calendar this year were freshman
smokers, bowling parties, picnics, exhibits, and
the annual E and M Ball.
     Again through good times and hard work the
E and M Association completed another successful year promoting closer relationship between
the engineering students.
During intermission the fellows and their dates enjoy entertainment provided by the band. Judging from the smiles, it
must have been very funny!

    The Evening Students Association is made
up of all students enrolled in the late afternoon,
evening, and Saturday divisions of the University. The organizations purpose is to provide
both a spiritual and social program that will
compliment the members' academic achievements.
For the first of these, the spiritual program, the
association holds  special chapel services on
Thanksgiving, Christmas, and Easter, while highlighting the social program are square dances,
semi-formal affairs, and the annual candlelight
dinner at which the new officers are installed.
Another highlight of the year is the semi-annual
Get-Acquainted Dance, held on the twelfth floor.
The Red Tuck Shop has become the customary
spot for ESA members to gather for relaxation
and conversation over a cup of coffee and a cigarette.
The Evening Students held a "Get Acquainted" Dance, October 13, I952, in the Panther Room on the 8th floor. The big
crowd had a swell time.

Some of the IRE'S are shown measuring an oscillator frequency with a precision wavemeter.
     The purpose of the Institute of Radio Engi neers at Pitt is to introduce these students to a
 professional society at a student level so that they
 can contribute to the field in their own way. This
 is exactly what the IRE is doing this year but
 they have really worked harder than ever to put
 this purpose across.
     Throughout the year they have had different
 speakers and movies shown on this field. A meeting
 which was held in February had students from
 other schools in the district come and speak on
 "This Field of Radio Engineering." An inspection

    The John Marshall Society is an honorary
prelegal organization. Its purpose is to give assistance and guidance to any and all prelegal students
in the university so that they can in time adjust
themselves to the law school study curriculum.
This year, headed by President Allan Reuben,
was a full and busy one. It was brought to a close
by a banquet held in the Faculty Club with Dean

After the installation service, the K club
holds its first social hour.
After they are sworn in, these men become
the charter members of the first K club chapter at Pitt.
    The K Club is one of the youngest fraternal
organizations at Pitt, having been founded and
organized here in the fall of 195I. Since then the
organization has constantly benefited members
and students with their compelling school spirit
and ambition. During Spring Carnival Week
last year the K Club float took second place
trophy in the float parade and the members opened
a basketball concession at the carnival.
     K Club formal installation was held at the
Villa Catilano pledging thirty men to active participation in a charter membership at Pitt. Since
initiation the K Club has sponsored smokers,
worked for worthy charities, and planned a social
calendar. Their first social event was the Farewell
Dinner Dance at Bill Green's in May. The members have worked hard to make their group a
functioning club and are looking forward to June
when they will be Kappa Sigma Kappa Fraternity
on campus.

   In 1879 a group of students in pharmacy organized Kappa Psi as a professional pharmacy fraternity. The Beta Kappa Chapter of Kappa
Psi, since its inception at Pitt in 1913, has endeavored to advance professionalism and fraternalism in the field of pharmacy. Kappa Psi
is one of the largest professional fraternities in
the United States and boasts forty-one active
collegiate Chapters.
    Highlights of the Beta Kappa Chapter is the

this award in memory of a deceased brother. The
student who earns the annual award is chosen by

the Province Convention and the annual Senior
Banquet. By staying close to fraternity aims and
participating in an interesting social program,
members have maintained the strength and unity
of Kappa Psi on campus.

 for men, know where to get their education-Pitt's libraries.
    Celebrating its twenty-seventh birthday at
Pitt, Tau chapter of Kappa Phi Kappa Fraternity
enlivened the past year with a successful mixture
of business and pleasure. The future teachers of
Kappa Phi Kappa gathered to stress scholastic
attainment, encourage social activity and promote professional ideals among men in all phases
of education. They invited the School of Education to a typical job interview conducted by a
leading school supervisor. Pitt's Kappa Phi's welcomed the establishment of a new chapter at
Indiana State Teacher's College, and then prepared to play host to the Regional Convention in
April. The members of Tau Chapter high-lighted
their social calendar with a smoker for junior and
senior men of the School of Education, an initiation banquet at the Faculty Club and a gala picnic at North Park in May.

     The Petroleum Seminar at Pitt is a credited
course inaugurated by the Petroleum Department
to promote interest in industry. The seminar includes sophomores, juniors, and seniors in a combined student body, which meets every week
either for a department or joint seminar.
     Several speakers were brought in this year to
speak on subjects pertaining to the petroleum
industry. Working closely with allied fields, the
Petroleum Seminar members attended the seventh
annual meeting of The American Institute of
Mining and Metallurgical tngineers, meetings of
the society of geologists and geophysicists, and
many other important talks.
    Orienting itself into life at Pitt, the Petroleum
Seminar, in addition to its sessions, had an active
intramural sports program with football, basketball, and softball teams represented.
    The final event of the year was a picnic early
in June held in one of the county parks. Here
much was discussed but the main topic of conversation must have been petroleum and the petroleum industry to which men will some day
belong.
Petroleum men learn to combine oils; these three men are well
qualified to work in the petroleum field after graduation.
Here, as in many petroleum seminar meetings, the students
learn to test the viscosity of oil.

creative Christian living and service" by performing a series of special projects.
    The first of these preceeding the fall semester
was a three day camp session at Camp Kon-OKwee where "Y" members helped to orient freshmen with Pitt life.
     One of the University's finest projects-was the
"Y's" Religion in Life Week which took place
in March and featured religions and cultural
leaders from all parts of the speaking world to
the student body in formal and informal discussions.
     Frequently the group sponsored community
service parties for the entertainment of handicapped children and periodic forums on topics of
interest. It was from these forums on Pitt's Town
Meeting that Political Week developed.
     Besides these projects, the "Y" also sponsored
monthly tours of local points of interest, and
weekly discussions of biblical material. Because of
these and other fine accomplishments, the YMCA
finished another successful school year as one of
the finest service clubs at Pitt.
    In the YMCA office the members of the group relax on off
    hours. Here Paul Schrading reads an article that seems to be
    of great interest to everyone.
The girls meet and relax in the YWCA office; here a few "Y"
members have an informal committee meeting.
    With emphasis on a full and creative life for
all people through a growing knowledge of God,
Pitt's Young Women's Christian Association promotes and participates in an almost unbelievable
number of activities. They present the impressive
"Caritas," a pageant interpreting the virtues in
the lives of the women pictured on the Heinz
Chapel windows. A United Nations Institute
featured college students from represented nations and was climaxed by the annual International Dinner. They sponsored all-student tours
to the Pittsburgh Press, City Jail and Crime
Laboratory. Working long hours, the girls collected all types of clothing to be sent to Korea
and participated whole-heartedly in Religion-inLife Week. Socially, the girls often combined
with the YMCA for Mixer Dances, Christmas
parties, and a final farewell picnic in May.

Pitt has had many great teachers. But, inevitably, each year we must lose a few of
them. The "Owl," like allthe sludent publications at Pitt, owed a great debt to the late

In ancient times, of course, philosophy
circumscribed all knowledge. Today, as
knowledge has grown complex, one reason
for large universities may be found in the
number of studies necessary to pursue the
manifold pathways of knowledge. But still
philosophy, however, are the complex measurements of Engineer Robert W. -7ackson.
  All during the year, the Heinz Chapel is the scene of many activities. Caritas,
  organ recitals and weddings are held in the chapel. The one service with which
  most of the students are familiar is the pre-Thanksgiving service held
  before recess begins.

    The chapel has been without a permanent
    chaplain for seven years. Dr. Brittain, who
 was assistant chaplain, has been looking after
 things. This year, the University of Pittsburgh
 was fortunate in securing the services of Dr.
Emory Luccock to head the chapel's activities.

Mr. Albert Klimcheck, the University architect, designed the new University of Pittsburgh
Nationality Room-the English Room-in a traditional English style to capture the atmosphere
harmonious with the portions of the bombed House of Commons which came from England to
the University, March i3, 1950. Although simple, the design of the room, in its unity, is rich in
the poetic atmosphere of Tudor England in the time of Shakespeare.
    At the dedication ceremonies of the English Room,
      an honorary Doctor's degree was bestowed upon
Alfred Charles Bossom. Mr. Bossom, who is a Member
  of Parliament, headed the English Room Committee
  in London, and was originally responsible for the idea
     of reproducing the English Room around original
        parts from the House of Commons in London.
The procession into the English Room was a colorful and
interesting sight to the many spectators that were
crowded into the Commons Room. The procession was
made up of many notables from both the English
government, the University, and other important and
influential Pittsburgh residents.
Mr. Gerald Firth, Chairman of the American Committee for the English Room, places the
medallion from Cambridge University on one of the windows of the room. This is only one
of the several trophies and symbols brought to the University from England which add to
the realistic and authentic atmosphere of this new Nationality Room.
After all the formalities of the presentation ceremonies and dedication were over, a reception was
held in the Commons Room for all who had attended. The Nationality Room Hostesses served
hot spiced punch to everyone, while the many visitors who had crowded outside the room were
allowed to go in and look at the unusual paintings, the high oak ceiling and the panelled fireplace.
When it comes to helping out with any worthy cause,
  you can be sure that the Pitt student body is always
  willing and ready to do their share. The annual drive
  conducted by the Red Cross to secure much needed
plasma was no exception. Many students proudly wore
the little red blood drop and white cross in their lapel.
    As usual, some of our hearty Pittites passed out including the chairman of the drive, Isabel Lubovsky.
The job of arranging for senior pictures can get
pretty complicated and nerve-wracking, but the
photographer, the seniors and the Owl always
seem to come through. Each student gets his
share of individual attention and bright lights.
Taking your picture is bad enough, but it's the proofs that really cause the
aggravation. The exclamation: do I really look like that! is the most frequent
comment uttered by astonished subjects.

     Brightening next year's sport scene, Pitt's
Athletic Department has initiated an "extended
program" by acquainting high school seniors
from the tri-state area with Pitt's background and
sport highlights, in hopes of gaining new sport
stars.
    On the intramural scene, Mr. Bemis, the
intramural director, has come up with his biggest
and best program in athletics for the "non-professionals." The athletic administration in fielding
one of Pitt's most powerful football teams, attracted national attention and created an exhilarating athletic interest on campus. The department has undoubtedly shown outstanding evidence of captivating the interest of the university
students and followers.

     One sure sign that Pitt has once more reached
the top of the football heap came as two of our
three defeats were proclaimed "upsets" by the
nation's press. A clean sweep of the Big Ten
warmed Panther hearts as Indiana, Iowa and Ohio
State fell with Notre Dame and Army among the
victims. A loss to Oklahoma had been expected,
but it took our backyard rivals to tame the Panthers; a fired-up West Virginia and an under-rated
Penn State managed to blank the jungle cats for
those painful upsets. All in all though, the team
showed everything the oldtime Pitt teams are
said to have had. A devastating ground attack
shredded some of the best lines in the country, and
the passing game, although spotty, clicked often
enough.
    For the second time in three years Pitt had
an undefeated Freshman team-words to cheer
any coach who is looking ahead to next year. The
Pitt yearlings defeated Army Plebes 19, to 14,
Navy Plebes 17 to 6, and Bullis Prep 39 to 0.
Perhaps even more promising than the scores was
the fact that the Panther Cubs came from behind
to shut out and win the first two games.

Some pursue knowledge with oscilloscopes,
others with books, with anything the search
demands. The communication of knowledge
itself must be studied, and taught. Pitt's
School of Education has a faculty engaged
in creating.faculties, as is Professor 7ohn
W. Harbaugh, engaged in research in the
Sixth Floor Reference Library.
Preparation for classes occupies more of a
student's and a teacher's time than do the
lecture hours themselves. A moment's relaxation, perhaps with a cigaret, and then back
to the books. The picture is of Professor
Harold M. Baker, mechanical engineering
department, but it could be any student, any
night.
Counselling, advising, as well as teaching,
are part of the faculty's duties. Dr. Dorothy
Miller is adviser to many Education students, but here she is fulfilling another academic obligation-grading test papers, a
measure of our progress.
PITT'S ALL-AMERICANS
    Three members of the squad, two seniors and
a sophomore, received well-deserved national recognition, Captain Joe Schmidt, whom many have
called as fine a line-backer as any in the pro ranks
made the INS first All-American team. He also
made the UP All-East team, and Collier's AllAmerican Specialists Team. Joe then played in
the North-South Shrine Clash. Billy Reynolds, the
toughest little man in football, who outgained the
entire backfields of Indiana, Ohio State, Army,
Notre Dame, and North Carolina State, was ignored by the "All's," but opened their eyes later.
               Joe Schmidt
Billy Reynolds
    Reynolds was a standout on both offence and
defense fo the great East-West Shrine game in
San Francisco, playing 50o minutes in these days
of platoons, and scoring the winning touchdown.
Then Billy went to Honolulu to play in two games
against professional all-stars, and scored in both
games to help the collegians win both. Eldred
Kraemer was the only sophomore on the Look
All-American first team, listed for defense. He also
was chosen on the United Press all-East team with
teammate Schmidt. Kraemer was a standout on
both defense and offense all year.

                Oklahoma      49
    Eighty-five degree heat helped crush the
Panthers at Oklahoma, as Pitt without Schmidt
and Blanda found it impossible to halt a speedy
split-T offense built around the deepest backfield
in the country. Still we managed to go into halftime with a 21-13 score after spotting the Sooners
three TD's. Some idea of the Oklahoma power
can be gained from the statistics, where they led
Pitt by 326 yards to 128 in rushing. Pitt's own
drives were impressive, going 63 yards and then
45 for scores in successive chances. Epps, Reynolds, and Neft carried over the TD's.
                                                                                It may look impossible, but Bobby Epps

    The Panthers really bounced back against
Notre Dame in one of the season's greatest games.
Billy Reynolds raced 79 yards from scrimmage for
Pitt's first touchdown to let the Irish know they
had a real game on their hands. Then Mattioli
hit Jacobs for 63 yards and another score. In the
second half Notre Dame came back against the
worn out Panthers, but Pitt, too, was good for a
50o-yard drive, and to clinch it, a safety.
    Although Captain Joe Schmidt was laid up
after the Irish fight, and Army was on the upswing again, Pitt showed itself the class of the
East by a dazzling display of single-wing and Tstuff to run up a 22-0 score at the end of the third
quarter. Then the Panthers, in the worst physical
shape of the season, hung on to take another big
game. Running for the injured Epps, Paul Chess
played his best game, scoring two TD's.

                 Reynolds' block is useless as the Mountaineer line smears Epps.
    With Pitt favored by as many as
four touchdowns, the underdog and under-rated Mountaineers held the Pitt
machine scoreless for the first time this
season, and, led by 17-year-old quarterback Fred Wyant, took back a victory
to jubilant West Virginia. They even
won the battle of statistics equally decisively. Pitt spent a lot of time in West
Virginia territory in the first quarter,
but never hit pay dirt. After that, the                  George Glagola
play was seldom out of Panther land. An
interception by Wrabley led to some hope,
but nothing happened. i6-o!!!
The same story-West Virginia's defenders were too tough.
                                                                                                            Al Smalara

     A maximum of finesse and a minimum of effort, according to the writers,
went into the Pitt victory over Indiana,
second Big Ten victim    of the year. A
great defense, led   by   Zombeck   and
Schmidt, held the Hoosiers to minus 25
yards on the ground. Indiana spent most
of the 4th quarter completing passes,
but not inside our 20. The first half was
marred by penalties, but sparkling running by Reynolds, Mattioli, Epps, and
Hoffman, plus fine blocking by Dietrick
and Epps kept Pitt way ahead all the,
way.

                                     North Carolina State didn't have a chance.
     Pitt completed its conquest of the
Big Ten by smashing Ohio State in a
great running game, where a few passes
really paid off. Ohio passed themselves
silly-in their own territory. A Ford interception and run-back from the Pitt
16 to the State 24 paved the way for the
first TD. Most exciting play of the game
was a Mattioli-to-Dietrick pass on the
Pitt 45, from which Dietrick staggered
55 yards through at least five defenders
to score. A short punt finally opened the
door to OSU in the 4th.

The tough Penn State line stops Epps.
And if they can't stop him, they push him out.
    The Pitt powerhouse was running
wide open against hapless North Carolina
State. The Wolfpack didn't have a
chance as Reynolds, Epps, and Hoffman
each scored twice, and Jacobs added a
seventh TD. Blanda converted six, to
make his season total 18 and tie the Pitt
record. Reynolds, again, outgained the
entire NC backfield. But the season
ended dismally in a shower of crushed
orange blossoms as Penn State ran Pitt
into the ground on the short end of a
17-0 score. Pitt outgained State on the
ground, but between the 35-yard markers,
while interceptions stalled every Pitt
offensive effort. With the game went
bowl, coal scuttle, and "Old Ironsides."

Wrestling
    Largest crowd ever to watch collegiate wrestling in Pittsburgh, 1,937 strong, saw a battle of
the undefeated when Pitt's grapplers met Penn
State to close the season. Unfortunately, State
took the meet, 16-12, to end the Panther winning
streak at 16. This was probably the most important college wrestling event of the year, for
Pitt had already beaten Michigan's Big Ten
champs, as well as Army, West Virginia, and the
tough small school team at Lock Haven.
    Two teammates went undefeated: Olympic
champ Hugh Peery, 123-pounder, and Joe Solomon, 167-pound sophomore. Solomon now owns
nine straight wins, seven by falls, and Peery has
23 straight, for a total of 31 wins against one
defeat in collegiate competition.
    Wrestling now rates as Pitt's top sport, with
a record of 33 wins against 19 losses since the sport
was re-established in I950.

                          Rifle Team
        In its two years of varsity competition, the
   Pitt rifle team has enjoyed unusual success. As a
   member of the Greater Pittsburgh League, which
   includes Tech, Duquesne, W &amp; J, West Virginia
   and California Teachers, Pitt finished in a tie for
   first place in 1952, dropping the shoot-off to West
   Virginia.
        Sending two teams to the National Rifle As   sociation match last spring, the Panthers placed
   third and fifth, but William Noroski and Thomas                           Tom Shepard
   Shepard, of Pitt, took first and second place in the
   meet..
        The major part of the riflemen's schedule is
   occupied by "postal matches," in which scores are
   fired for record against other teams who par   ticipate by mail. In these matches, Pitt defeated
   15 teams, was outscored by 8, including Navy,
   Lehigh, U. of California, Wyoming, Maryland,
   Tennessee and Stanford.

Basketball
     A veteran-studded team ran up the best basketball record in seven years for the Panthers this
season. Putting a 12-II won-lost chart in the
record book, the Pittmen out-scored, out-shot
(percentagewise), and out-rebounded their opponents, committed fewer fouls, and fell behind
only at the free-throw line. In fact, with only five
teams defeating us by more than seven points, a
better percentage at the foul line might well have
put the Panthers up with the top teams of the
country.
     Once known as "ice cream eaters," Carlson's
men this year made the pages of LIFE with their
oxygen tank, a new wrinkle in Doc's longtime experiments with the fatigue curve. The team also
helped in some experiments with the new foul
rules, but less successfully, as Ohio State won the
experimental game at the foul line.

    Deitrick taps one in while
    Dussel and Zernich ready
    for a possible rebound.
         As usual a small fast team, the Pittmen ran
     and shot more than ever in recent years for an
     average of 69 points per game, and bumped seldom
     into trouble of big men. Don Virostek, at 6'4, was
     the big man this year, and his rebounding was a
     big factor in Panther success. Close behind came
     Captain Mickey Zernich, high scorer and light     weight of the team, who outran and outjumped
     most of his opposition to sink a total of 309 points;
     This put Zernich second only to the great Chipper
     Cholly Hyatt with a three-year total of 845 points;
     another record not to be slighted is Don Virostek's
     rebounding: he was fifth in the nation. Other
     sharpshooters were Clarence Burch, Dick Die     trick, and Art Boyd, ably seconded by Dave
Dutch Burch sails under the
bucket for an easy lay-up
against Westminister.

West Virginia game, he pushed a thirty footer through the cords to win the game 67-65.

Scholarship reared its stately head, no uncommon
sight, of course, around Carlson teams, as Boyd
was tapped to Phi Beta Kappa.
    The season started without too much promise,
with a road loss to Michigan, a win over Westminster in the home opener, and then two close
ones, a defeat by Miami and a win over Ohio
University, by one and two points respectively.
The team looked good, but wasn't always winning.
Another loss, to Ohio State, went by before the
Ivy League handed us three easier games.
    The Panthers took a 4-4 record east with
them, and bumped into some real homer officials
at Penn-after leading all the way we lost in overtime. Then came the highest scoring spree in Pitt
history as the Panthers knocked off Geneva, 9775.

       Mickey Zernich seems to sit on a Mountaineers shoulder while
       he puts this one in.
   A one-point squeeze over favored Penn State
and a romp over Carnegie Tech virtually insured
a winning season but didn't help us against West
Virginia, though, as the Mountaineers poured on
95 points to Pitt's 70. Another victory over Westminster started the winter road trip, which saw
victories go to St. Louis and Loyola, by two and
three points, and Navy, with only a win over
Houston sandwiched in.
    Then came sweet revenge over West Virginia
back at home, another loss to Ohio State and
another win over Tech. Finishing the season away,
the Panthers in turn fell victims to revengehungry teams. The district's hottest team, Geneva, trimmed us neatly 81-66, and the Panthers
closed the season by proving that Penn State is
unbeatable at home, 73-53.

     Pitt's Eastern Collegiate Swimming Associ ation champs had a rough season, with a record
 of three wins, four losses and one tie in dual meet
 competition. Hampered by the loss of ace back stroker and captain, Don Fanning, the Panther
 mermen nevertheless showed several flashes of
 form which made the picture less gloomy. Fred
 O'Nions set a new ECSA record in the individual
 I so-yard medley, and Gerry Weiss and Ronny
 Gainsford both set new Pitt records in the 220- and
440-free style, and 2oo-yard breaststroke, respectively. Gainsford set the third fastest mark in
the country this winter.
     ECSA champs of'52 Tom Blosser in diving
and Bill Corr in sprints, helped Gainsford (also an
ECSA record holder) keep Pitt definitely in the
running for eastern honors, along with the always
dangerous relay team of Harry Piwowarski, Dick
Peterson, Gerry Weiss and Bill Corr.

most valuable. However, there is often a man who,
like a sparkplug, seems to keep things going when
it's tough. Here the Owl has gathered ten such

Coach Olson's boys had a narrow miss in the
opener versus Ohio State, losing 521Y to 5123.
The other stumble was to Miami of Ohio. Wally

     Did you happen to drop up on the Mellon
Park Courts last spring? If you did, you probably
saw some of the neatest tennis matches played
there. Did you happen to know that Bob Ilsevich
was the unbeaten Panther in singles competition?
You also saw Joe Bendel along with Harry Campney and Gene Weinstein burning up the sod with
frmidable 6 I records. After taking the first
three matches, a Carnegie Tech group managed
to squeak by the Cat 5-4. But the Panther bounced
over the net to take two more. Penn State halted
the Cat again. This time 7 2. So a 5 and 2 record
hits the books while an even more aggressive team
will hit the sod next year.
Weinstein readies a return while his partner,
Harr) Campney, watches intently.

to be the only block to a perfect season, by dropping the Panthers 5-2 after 5 straight victories.
However, Dave McCormick's linksmen harnessed

unscathed. Pitt enjoyed shutouts over Geneva

A perfect swing, but he fouls into the dirt.
    Coach Ralph Mitterling fielded his team only
a dozen times this year. The Panther Nine outplayed 7 of 12 teams for a.583 season. Milt
Emery led the way with a heavy.341 batting
mark. Bob Kyle led in hits for the season with
15 and 2 big homeruns for a.300 mark. Ollie
Niemela combined 12 RBI's and errorless ball
with 20 chances for a standout performance.
Harry Little made a mark in center field by making good on 24 errorless chances. As the records go,
Joe Scalzo, Panther first baseman, made about the
best showing with 97 putouts without an error and
15 runs probably boosted with his 7 stolen bases.
Rudy Filek at 3B must have acted like Eddie
Stanky in pulling 8 walks through the season.
Dick Shannon, in pitching 3423 innings for a
2-1 record, struck out 35 men and also gets the
credit for the only shutout of the season. Bob Russell had the only clean slate as he issued no bases
on balls and struck out 10 in 12% innings. Don
Shanafelt found the only extra inning game, that
against W. Va., but came out on top. He carried a
3-1 record for 33Y innings pitched. Although
Pitt just bounced through the win-loss columns
like a rubber ball, better things should be appearing on the horizon.

Intramurals
     In February of this year a meeting was held
 to find ways to increase student activity and inter est in intramural sports. Originally called by the
 university athletic director, Captain Tom Hamil ton, this meeting was the start of a new student
 group to promote intramural athletics at Pitt. One
 of its aims was to merge the professional schools
 with the College for a more solidified intramural
 program.
     This year's intramural events ran smoothly,
with a greater percentage of participation on the
students' part than ever before. Thanks to the
foresight of Mr. Leo Bemis, Intramural Director,
and Captain Hamilton, we can look ahead to an
expanded and well directed program again next
year.

     Panther Club President, Mickey Zernich, had
 quite a job trying to get peace and quiet at his
 meetings. "Did you ever try to keep a room full
 of athletes quiet?" asked Mickey. "I not only
 have to stop the noise, but sometimes I have to
 go to their rooms and get the fellows out of bed
 or snatch them from their favorite hangout or
 even close their books and drag them to the
 meetings".
    The club promoted better school relations
by ushering the high school guest athletes to a
reserved section at football games, sponsoring
dances after several basketball games, and planning the varsity day program. In the spring two
outstanding athlete's names were inscribed on
the Varsity Walk.

Christmas at Pitt has many meanings for the
students who spend part of their daily lives on
campus. The happy yet solemn echo of
Christmas carols drifts about from the twelfth
floor to the Commons Room.
Even the post office is caught up in the busy
rushed excitement that spells out the magic air
that goes with Christmas.
To some the looming of Christmas
vacation means a break in class
worries. With two weeks to finish
up those bothersome term papers,
we can afford a few minutes to sit
back and "just relax."

A discussion among the orators is in progress about the coming
Penn State Poetry Festival.
     In loud, clear, oval shaped tones, secretary
Myra Wilson reads the temporary list of activities
planned by the girls in the Women's Speech
Association. Included in the list were discussions,
debates, tournaments, festivals, and parties. The
girls worked furiously on two radio programs, a
fifteen minute skit for WPGH and a half hour one
for KQV. The parliamentary procedure program
was organized by the girls to give help on parliamentary rules to any interested group or organization. These girls were proud of their thorough
knowledge of this technical subject.
    WSA took part in many speech activities
during the year. Pitt's lady orators had a wonderful time at the Penn State Poetry Festival. They
also took an active part in a regional speech
tournament among colleges of seven states and
were honored to become hostesses to a group of
British debators.
The girls take part in one of their socials held in the Stephen
Foster Social Room.
A member of the Debate team prepares to answer a question

These boys are about to criticize the work of fellow debators
who have just completed a rousing debate.
     Resolved: that Men's Debate has had a full
 schedule of debates, discussions, and other speak ing activities this school year.
     The Men's Debate this year traveled to
 approximately 13 other colleges and visited Io
 local high schools for demonstration debates.
 The members also participated in intracity tour naments in October, November, and December.
     The annual Pitt-Western Reserve Debates
were a series of exhibition debates before high
school audiences. During January the members
sponsored a high school Clinic-Tournament at
the university with manager Lud Lippert presiding.
    This year there were two Petro brothers in
the club and one of the opposite sex, Barbara
Newman. Dan Purdy was a busy member, typing
up letters and forms to be sent to different high
schools and colleges encouraging and planning
debate programs.

Varsity
Marching Band
    "Presenting: The University of Pittsburgh
Varsity Marching Band." When you hear this
announcement you think of the band as a group
of marching musicians, but some day these men
will be doctors, lawyers, chemists, engineers, and
pharmacists. Strangely enough, none of them are
studying to be musicians. They practice eight
hours a week, play at reviews and football games,
attend classes and receive practical experience
in working daily with the other band members.
    The spirit of the band is fraternal in nature
because they have to perform as a team, not individuals. They share experiences such as marching in the mud, sitting in the stand when the
temperature is down around the twenties, and
sharing a seat in the bus on a Michigan State trip.
    Every summer the entire organization spends
a week at Camp Kon-O-Kwee. Days there begin
with eight o'clock breakfast and drill on the field
until after dark. Members have blueprints of
different formations and each man must know his
ever important number.
    Behind the scenes the managers are the "work
horses" of the organization. Their chief duty is to
move instruments to and from the games. They
contribute a great deal to the smooth operation
of performances even though they don't play instruments themselves.
    The Stadium Review in December is a concert all members look forward to... and the party
following the review... is just as tremendous as
the review.
    Belonging to the band is getting up -Saturday
mornings for 9:00 rehearsal, marching until your
arms and legs ache, and trying to find time to
study, but it's great, ask any band member.
Animated formations, like this swinging bell, characterize the Pitt Band's progressiveness in establishing a pattern for college
bands all over America.
The band plays and sings its famous version of "Hail to Pitt" at the end of all pre-game shows.
"Ace" Arthur brings the band into action at one of their many
camp rehearsals.
Benny Benack, assistant director of VMB, is a
shining example to all trumpeters.
The band, the glee club, and RCA Victor recording Company
have cooperated to make these records available to the student
body and to the public.
"The Bandsman of the Year Award," presented annually by Kappa Kappa Psi to the
man getting the most votes from the band
members.
                          A waltz done in three quarter time, complete
                          with tricky steps and special musical ar                          rangements, is presented for the public's
                          approval.
Tiny lead soldiers, proportionately scaled to
the  gridiron, are  manipulated   through
various positions before a new formation is
drawn.
This formation, the Panther head, is the trade mark of the Pitt Varsity Marching Band. It is used for
the playing of the Alma Mater at the close of each half-time show.
                     To the strain of "Reuben, Reuben," the band forms these
                                                            dance circles and performs a hoe-down country square dance
                                                            with dips, bows, and dosey-does.

The girls rehearse a few songs for the Women's Day program
accompanied by Suzanne Janos.
     "Sound your A, girls, and keep your mind on
 the rhythm, please," pleaded Suzanne Janos, as
 she and the Women's Choral rehearsed for the
 program they were giving that week at the As pinwall Veterans' Hospital. "We want to have it
 perfect before Mr. Sterne gets back." The Aspin wall concert was just one of many the girls gave
 this year. They had a lovely program for Beaux
 Arts Day and they sang for the Women's Day and
 Mothers' Day Chapel Services in Heinz Chapel.
 And Women's Choral is always asked to sing for
 several of the Pittsburgh church services.
     What would Christmas at Pitt be like without
the traditional informal caroling in the Commons
Room, wondered Teresa Seboly as she waited for
some other members of the group to join her there.
Amidst the decorated Christmas trees and glowing
fires the students joined in singing the beloved
old songs, led by the Choralers, of Women's
Choral.
        With Mr. Sterne as director the choralers tune up for their
        program to be given at the Aspinwall Veterans Hospital.

     In the late afternoon members of Glee Club
could usually be found in the Tuck Shop where
they held impromptu song sessions. Besides the
songs on their current agenda they sang tradition'al
college songs like "Halls of Ivy" or "The Whiffenpoof Song" and "The Songs of Pitt" which they
recorded for the school.
     "With this International Contemporary Music Festival coming up we've lots of work to do,"
said president Bob Graule. "The Drinking Song"
by Vaughn Williams and "We Fight Not For
Glory" from "The Testament of Freedom" by
Randall Thompson were the Men's Glee Club's
contribution  to the festival, which featured
modern songs by unknown American and foreign
composers. The boys who presented the program,
as well as those music lovers who heard the singing, found great pleasure in the varied program of
new songs.
Under the leadership of Bob Graule, the officers of the Glee
Club plan for their annual banquet.

     Hard work plus talent is the keynote of the
Pitt Players, student dramatic group at the University. As soon as the final curtain falls on one
performance it's time to paint scenery and practice
for the next production. Constantly competing
with Carnegie Tech's drama department, Pitt
Players as an extra-curricular activity, has as its
purpose the production of good theatre and experience in the techniques of theatre art.
     To participate in the Pitt Players the student
must be a full time undergraduate and have
satisfactory participation in two fields. Field A
includes acting, business, publicity, make-up and
sound. Field B includes scenery, costumes, lights,
stage and property. To retain active membership,
a player must be active in at least two productions
during the school year. Plays this year included
"The Time of Your Life," "The Heiress" with
"Billy Budd" being produced in the Spring.
    In January, as a special project, the Players
produced "Promethus in Pittsburgh" by Lawrence
Lee; this was the first staging of this dramatic
poem in Pittsburgh.
    The annual June banquet is another big production by the student players. New members are
received into the Players and old members are
awarded keys for outstanding participation, proving that for Pitt Players, "the play's the thing."

The Time of Your Life
The good hearted Nick, played by John Conomikes also has
regrets as his young daughter Anna played by Vickie Buchsbaum reminds him of his wife. Kit Carson played by Chuck
Stetler listens attentively.
Tom, played by Donald Knudsen follows Kitty, played by
Anna Lou Alex to her room. Kitty tells Tom about her unhappy
childhood.
"In the time of your life, live-so that in that wondrous time
you shall not add to the misery and sorrow of the world, but
shall smile to the infinite delight and mystery of it." Nick's
Saloon makes it possible for the characters in the play to live.
The Heiress
The bitter Catherine, Sheila Elias, realizes the impossibility of the fulfillment of her love for Morris, knowing that she has been jilted.
Catherine Sloper, played by Sheila Elias cooly listens as her father, played
by Jaun O'Callahan, tells of his incurable illness. Maria, played by Bonnie
Lee Charlton sympathetically understands.
Dr. Sloper, Jaun O'Callahan, questions Mrs. Montgomery, Nancy Joan
Rylands, concerning Morris' intentions toward his daughter.
The clever Morris Townsend, John Wallhausser, wins favor with Aunt
Lavinia so that he may further pursue Catherine and her fortune.
Billy Budd, condemned to die, ascends the ratlinis, bringing the
play to a climactic ending.
Billy Budd
Donald Poland, Pitt Player, as Billy Budd.
     Jack Ingram as Lieutenant Seymour discusses with Captain
     Vere, Frank Kopta, the basic conflicts of the play.
Gardner, played by Raymond Orie, the comic relief in the play,
scans the log book in hopes of finding errors.

J. Fallon, C. Askey, T. Parker, and B. Warren practice up on

     For those who "just love to sing" the perfect
activity is the Pitt Singers. Although there are
definite talent requirements for membership, the
most important qualifications are a love of music
and a desire to sing. Pitt Singers is made of members who meet all these requirements.
     Under the direction of David G. Weiss the
group had quite a busy year. Among the most
important events in the Pitt Singers' calendar were
concerts and special programs. The group gave a
performance at the Choral Jubilee along with the
other singing groups on Campus; gave their Annual spring concert at Carnegie Music Hall; then
rounded out the year with a concert tour in the
local area.
    This busy year was properly climaxed by the
annual banquet at which the active singers received their reward-a key-that they will long
cherish as a reminder of a wonderful year in
Pitt Singers.
The members of Pitt Singers concentrate on their singing in
preparation for their spring concert.
   Perhaps the most picturesque scene in January was
the Chapel blanketed by a soft snow fall. The wintery
       carpet of white sprinkled over the campus like
                                     powdered salt.

The need for a better method of registering the
many Pitt students each semester has presented
a major problem to University officials. This
January cards and kits went out almost a full
two weeks ahead of the actual registration.
Much time and energy were saved and with a
few changes, this new type of pre-registration
may become permanent.
                                                         Each Military Organization presented
                                                         its choice for Military Ball Queen.
                                                         Dorothy Miller happily wears her
                                                         victory tiara while her ladies-in-waiting
                                                         smile with her even though in defeat.
                                                         Left to right the amiable losers are:
                                                         Irene Levine, Lonnie Cinquegrani,
                                                         Anna Mae Pagano, Marjorie Wright,
                                                         the queen, and Janet Sopher.
      Aside from all the
 drilling, transportation
     or uniform fittings,
         Pitt's Military
Organizations do have a
      social aspect. The
    Military Ball was a
  successful highpoint in
       the fall semester.
This year three of the University of Pittsburgh's
outstanding choral groups; Women's Choral, Men's
Glee Club and Pitt Singers combined to put on a large
Choral Jubilee. This year's program was very well
received as the especially receptive audience shows.
  Seems as though January is the
  month of song throughout the
  school. Pitt women do their best
      to capture first place in the
    annual Inter-Class Sing. This
 year the seniors copped the prize
with their version of "Seniorella."

With the semester's end not very far away, the
    Women's 12th Floor typewriters are busily
  occupied. Those term papers have just got to
                                    be done!
Typing term papers often proves
to be an easier task than studying
for finals. Before that deciding
exam, the concentration and
consternation of students can
be seen everywhere.
This is it! The books are closed
and let's hope memory doesn't
desert us now.

Miss Pitt
    At the conclusion of four years at Pitt it is
difficult to pinpoint the feelings and thoughts of
our many experiences here. The most treasured
moments are intangible and cannot be defined or
represented. But in this picture we have tried to
gather together a few of the things that represent
our life here at Pitt-books, Pitt News, records, a
dance program, and a Fade Mecumn. We of the Owl
have chosen Olga Kril and Mickey Zernich to be
our Mr. and Miss Pitt of I953. Both Olga and
Mickey have participated in activities while maintaining high scholastic averages. They are typical
of the many students who combine studies and
activities-they are our Mr. and Miss Pitt.

Deep in thought, members
plans for the coming year.
    After Pitt's triumphant victories over Notre
Dame and Army, more high school students
flocked to the stadium to see their favorite college
team play West Virginia. Anxious to make the
visitors feel more at home, members of Student
Congress and WSGA volunteered to greet the high
schoolers and distributed mimeographed copies of
Pitt songs and cheers. The students made a LOUD
cheering section. At the game many Pittites were
surprised to hear the high school bands playing
"Hail to Pitt." This was another idea of Student
Congress in conjunction with Druids. They
printed and sent out copies of the song to all local
high schools to promote better public relations.
    The Blood Bank came to Pitt in November
sponsored by the Congress members. There were
many students and faculty members wearing "I
Gave" tags for two days.
    The local governing group played an important part in the numerous controversial issues
this year concerning the welfare of their fellow
students. One debate that gained a great deal of
publicity was the question of permitting wives of
football players and students to sit in the reserved
student section and permission for reduced rates
for those husbands and wives who did not attend
school.

After numerous ideas and suggestions are made, the Social
Committee tries to come to a decision.
The Christmas dance committee finally agreed on plans for
the December formal annually held in the Commons Room.
     Fostering social as well as political life, Student Congress sponsored four student dances this
year. The Commons Room Ball, a fitting climax to
the Christmas festivities, was a huge success.
Dozens of bedecked Christmas trees and even a
student Santa Claus added to the gay evening.
    The biggest project that Student Congress
governs during the year is Spring Carnival Week.
It is the duty of members to keep things running
smoothly and see that everyone has a lot of fun.
They worked with the fraternity and sorority
members and accomplished a tremendous job.
The Main Ball on Friday Night during Festival
Week was the grand climax to carnival and another school year. Congress presented gold cups to
the top shows during the carnival and promised
bigger and better things for next year--confirming
the fact that they're true politicians.
                 The executive committee meets in Mr. El                 liott's office to discuss the problem of more

Members of WSGA plan for the annual Interclass Sing.
    The Women's Self Government Association
was one of the best fed groups on campus this
year. For every commission meeting a different
committee planned, prepared, and served a dinner
for the group and its advisers and guests. The
committees not only learned to cook and to use
the twelfth floor kitchen but they set the tables,
decorated the room, and washed and dried the
dishes afterward with the help of anyone who
happened along.
    WSGA started a class in crocheting this
year, and after weeks of chainstitching on a ball
of thread the girls had made a lovely tablecloth
for the Braun Room.
    To help acquaint the freshmen women with
 Table decorations are planned and made by the Social Com mittee.
 After the successful Chancellor's Open House sponsored by
 Senior Court, the girls thank Dr. Fitzgerald for his gracious
 hospitality.
These girls are ready to give information about the twelfth
floor to any freshman or upperclassman.
Pitt's activities WSGA fostered the guilds and
helped the senior mentors. At the end of the program a guild-customs dinner was held and when
the freshies had passed their customs test they
were entertained at a tea where they received
their panther pins.
    Under the eye of the traditions committee
the Inter-Class Sing was carried out. The theme
this year was fairy tales: freshmen portrayed "The
Pied Piper"; sophomores, "Snow White"; juniors,
"The Three Bears"; and seniors, "Cinderella."
    At Pitt, women are considered equal with
the men and it was only fitting therefore to let the
girls have an opportunity to turn about and ask
the boys out; the Heart Hop gave just that chance.
Steve Passamanek cannot decide whether to remain with the
boys or move to the Panther Room for a fast game of ping
pong.

    When Freddie Freshman enters Pitt, Men's
Council is ready to orient him to college life. They
circle his neck with a blue and gold tie and make
threats if he doesn't wear it always. Then they
shove him in front of a vast football crowd to pull
on a rope against the sophomores so he can take
the tie off.
    If Freddie wants a used book he goes to the
Men's Council Bookstore on the eighth floor.
When Freddie goes to a freshman mixer dance he
sips cider and dances to records furnished by his
teacher, pal, friend, and master-Men's Council.
    Freddie soon learns the value of money and
when he finds himself short of cash, MC Student
Loan Fund is more than willing to help him out.
If he has a check for less than $5.00 he can cash it
at MC cashing service.
     Should Freddie want to play ping pong or
cards or just relax, he can go to the men's lounge
on the eighth floor maintained by Men's Council.
Through Council he is able to see movies of Pitt's
football games. The members of MC are on their
toes constantly-always lending a helping hand
to Freddie Freshman.

Dick Roman's solution to recovering stolen items from the
fraternity houses is met with humorous defeat.
The Phi Ep's came through collecting the most canned food
for St. Barnabas Home and the GAR Home at Thanksgiving.
     "How many here have ever beep inside the
downtown YWCA?" asked Dick Roman with a
mile-wide grin on his face. "If you haven't, you
soon will be," added Lud Lippert at a meeting of
Inter-Fraternity Council, "because we are going
to paint some of the rooms for the girls." And
in December they did just that. With a little
help from some of the girls the boys mixed the
paint and artistically spattered it on the walls.
    At Thanksgiving the frats collected canned
food for the St. Barnabas Home and the GAR
Home. Phi Ep's collected the most but two of
their boys were arrested for collecting food without
a permit.
    The Inter-Fraternity athletic program got
off to a great start in the fall. Many outstanding
football games were played up at Schenley Oval
and the Delta Tau Delta's turned out to be top
team this year, walking away with the championship.
     Greek Week sponsored jointly by IF Council and Panhellenic Council in the fall featured a
progressive dance at the different fraternity and

and smokers during the year, but their biggest
affair was the traditional IF formal where the

     Big brownies with ice cream and hot fudge

reception in November. Freshmen women were
introduced formally to all the different sororities
on campus during the program and afterwards,
in the Blue Tuck Shop, they met the girls informally. The music was provided by the PanHel
Choir, two girls representing each sorority. And
the director, Dorothy Jacob, took a deep sigh
of relief after all the songs were sung---long hours
of practice had paid off! The sorority girls at Pitt
don't need to worry about Leap Year because
every March there is the PanHel formal Ball and
the girls invite the boys. This Ball honors the
pledges of each sorority and they are all presented
with pretty white gardenias by the Council; In
the spring of the year Audrey Cohen was busy
working with Interfraternity Council planning
the PanHel-IF Sing. And all year the sorority
representatives worked together to build a common loyalty among all the groups.

     With three years of exciting college life be hind them, the members of the Women's Class
 of'53 made their senior year the most unforget table. Their first get-together was the Senior
 Soda Social. Highlight of the gathering was a
 hilarious skit by a group of fellow seniors. Look ing at the present and into the future the Women's
 Class of'53 sponsored a series of Senior Seminars.
 Uppermost in their minds was who would be
 Senior Queen. But up came the Interclass Sing
 and everyone busied herself to make their last
 bid in the popular Sing the most successful. The
 long-awaited Tap Day finally came and with it
 was the applause and congratulations that are
 plentiful when Her Highness and the Alma Mater
 are named. The Senior Dinner the day after Tap
 Day was the last time the girls gathered as the

    What a year this has been for the Juniors!
A luncheon, a dinner, a western get-together and
perhaps the crowning achievement, their own
Junior song, combined to make two semesters of
fun and happy memories for the Class of'54. It
all began with the Junior Roundup. The Juniors
westernized the twelfth floor with ten-gallon hats
and bright plaid shirts. Then came the buffet
luncheon before Christmas. Between I1:oo and
I:00, so that all could come, the Juniors spent an
unforgettable afternoon together. Never tiring
of eating, the Juniors invited their nursing school
classmates to join in the Junior Dinner. With
President Doris Hart as toastmistress, the class
of'54 gathered for the last time as Juniors to
close out their third thrilling year at Pitt. And
mixed with the memories of the luncheon and
dinner will be recollections of the Inter-Class
Sing, the Heart Hop and many, many more activities.

 "What's the theme for this month?" President
 The girls are trying to decide which would be more appetizing
 for coming class dinner-veal, chicken or maybe steak.
Maryrose Benkoski may ask at one of the meetings. Then the suggestions for the theme of the
monthly class mixer come thick and fast. Or the
question might be about the menu of the class
dinner: "Veal chops would be nice," Audrey
Longridge, treasurer, may suggest: "What about
chicken?" asks V.P., Rosenella Tolion. Veal
chops? Chicken? Ham? Or maybe even steak!
But no matter what is on the menu it's bound to
be good; for the sophs have Miss Savina Skewis,
Assistant Director of the University Food Service,
as Cabinet Adviser. Add to the agenda a class
picnic, and the Cabinet of the Women's Class of
'55 had a busy schedule working to unite the
sophomores in a year of fun.
Suggestions are being made by the cabinet members for a
suitable theme to be used in the monthly class mixer.

       "The Freshman Council serves as the co   ordinating group for the activities of the freshman
   women. It considers questions of general interest
   to all freshman women. It is the body that decides
   the freshman class policies." This is the definition

   a group of thirty-six girls who put these definitions
   into real actions.
       When girls first enter the University they are
   new and very strange. Through deans' conferences
Freshman Council go over their script for the skit for the
Inter-Class Sing.
the girls become acquainted with each other and
meet some of the upperclassmen who help to
initiate them into their four years of college life.
     During the month of September, Dean Rush
sponsored a dinner for the Freshman Council,
girls chosen form the thirty-six deans' conference
groups. These girls on the Council act as a connecting link between deans' conferences.
     At Inter-Class Sing, the freshman women
compete with the upperclass women in originality
and talent. This year they had as their chairman
and counselor Rosemarie Feil, vice president of
WSGA.
    At the end of their freshman year the council
girls nominate their sophomore class officers, and
have the feeling that they are now full fledged
Pittites.

PITT IN
                                                    A new semester starts and the familiar pattern
                                                    once more takes shape. Handy references like
                                                    the College Outline Series and the Card
                                                    Catalogue are in constant use and demand.
                                                    It is very fortunate for Pitt students that the
                                                    University bookstore provides these guiding
                                                    outlines in almost all subjects and that the
                                                    library is able to provide such an extensive
                                                    backlogue of material for student use.
Each year all the fraternities of the University
of Pittsburgh hold a joint Inter-fraternity Ball.
This time, as in past years, each fraternity
selected a girl who was their candidate for the
title of Sweetheart and Queen. Anna Mae
Pagano was this year's queen and received a
lovely radio along with her flowers and title.
The awarding of the Pledge Scholarship is
another feature of the annual Inter-fraternity
Ball. The awarded plaque signifies that this
year Phi Epsilon Pi had the pledge class with
the highest scholastic averages. Ronald Ecker
receives the award for his fraternity.

The basketball season was a very lively one.
   Helping to make it even more so were the
events held at the half. During the Pitt-Tech
         game a rugged tug of war was held.
Another half-time activity that caused a great
deal of interest was the basketball game
between Men's Council and the Student
Congress during the West Virginia game.
Note the unusual uniforms.
   February is the month of the
 final rushing affairs and it ends
with a great many happy smiles
and of course the much sought
                     after bid.
In contrast to the limited
membership of the sororities and
fraternities, is the Independent
Association which has no limited
quota. All students are welcome
to join and here they get
acquainted at one of their many
social events of the year.
Valentine's Day is the cue for Pitt to sponsor the annual Heart Hop. Many
students turn out for the dance especially to see who will be chosen this year's
King and Queen of Hearts. The lucky couple for 1953 are Elynnedd Pool and
her King Bob Timmons.
A large crowd gathered in the Commons Room for the Convocation which was
held as a part of Religion In Life Week. During the week, many different
speakers were presented. Left to right are shown Dr. James Robinson of Church
of the Master, N. Y.; Joseph Marasco student chairman of the Religion In Life
program; Richard R. Gay from Ohio Wesleyan University; Dr. Bernard Anderson
of Colgate Rochester Divinity School; Mr. Robert O'Donnell, Director for State
Council for Pennsylvania F.E.P.C.; Mr. Ki Aldrich, former football star and now
Evangelist.

     With an effective publicity campaign which
included Owel antics during the haiftimes of football games and a race to the 36th floor conducted
by Publicity Managers Robert DeBroff and
William Stept, the problem of circulation was
solved. By extending the local campaign, Marvin
Leiber and Richard DeBroff, Advertising Managers, were able to exceed the budget in selling ads.
Handling the sales of organizations by himself,
Alan Skirboll did an excellent job of contacting
and soliciting organizations. He, too, went over
the top in meeting the goal established in the
budget. Harvey Rabinowitz, Assistant Business
Manager, helped this small but efficient staff keep
the budget balanced and Karl happy.

Pitt Owlettes
OWL OF i953, Gerda Friedman
       A new Owl feature last year, the Owlettes
   were so well received that we of the 1953 Owl
   staf could not forget them; here again, then,
   are nine lovely Pitt coeds-girls who brighten
   Pitt's hallways, Tuck Shops, and classrooms.
       As something special this year, we have
   chosen Gerda Friedman to be "Miss Owl of
   1953." Gerda, a freshman, represents to us the
   exuberance and sweetness which is typical of
   her classmates.
       Here they are, the 1953 Owlettes.
Gloria Heneghan, Managing Editor, was the
editor's friend in need as well as the staff's.
Here she puts her hands to the typewriter and
comes through with the needed copy.
Jack Caldwell, Mr. Photographer of the Owl,
spent most of the year squinting at people behind lenses. When he wasn't squinting, he
was straining to see in the dark room.
     Plans and layouts for the Owl were drawn up
during the summer by Editor Barbara Millen,
with the assistance of Gloria Heneghan, Managing
Editor. With the first week of school the editorial
staff began work. Joan Franz distinguished herself by meeting a deadline all by herself. Joan sent
in the first sixteen pages of her sorority section in
October completing the first deadline. Taking
nearly fifteen hundred pictures, the small photography staff headed by Jack Caldwell was
haunted with photo assignment sheets given them
by Phyllis Kephart, Photo-Editor. With the idea
that livelier copy would increase student readership, Joan Stigers, Literary Editor, tried to make
the copy as appealing as possible. As fast as Joan
could turn out copy, Cynthia Aberman, the Owl's
record breaking head typist, typed it to be sent to
the printer. Don Gwillim whose every other sentence was, "But Barb, I made the picture assignments!" took over the Fine Arts section in
the middle of the year and in spite of this handicap,
did a remarkable job. Another difficult assignment, the Organization Section, was handled by
                             Comptroller for the Owl as well as
                             scraper Engineer, Jim Alster kept tl
                             straight for all of us.
                             Phyllis Kephart checks one of the
                             of photo assignment sheets whic
                             through her hands while Chuck Sea

Dahlia Katz. With no previous experience in yearbook production work, Dahlia learned quickly and
proved to be a capable editor. In addition to helping Dahlia, Joe Banik, the Owl staff humor man,
performed the unheard of feat of keeping Barb
laughing. In January, when the portrait pictures,
over a thousand of them, came, the whole staff
began pasting pictures to help Dotty Hudson,
Classes Editor, with her section. The staff celebrated the making of that deadline with a shower
for Dotty who left in February to be married.
With little help from anyone, Danny Berger did a
wonderful job with the fraternity section; Danny
concentrated on getting pictures of frat affairs, and
with the cooperation of the photograhpy staff, who
sacrificed many Friday and Saturday evenings to
take pictures, was able to get a good coverage of
fraternity affairs.
Karl Meyers and Harvey Rabinowitz discuss with the business staff how
Mark Friedman can sell 300 more books so that the Owl won't end up in
the red.
         In addition to handling the athletic section, a
    pesky assignment in itself, Chuck Suprock learned
    to take pictures in order to help out the under    manned photography staff. Doris Secor did all of
    the art work in the book and helped with many of
    the special layouts. In order to get a complete and
    accurate coverage for the special picture stories,
    Shirley Schiffman watched the bulletin boards and
    Pitt News faithfully. As office manager, Clare
    Cooper took care of exchange books and collecting
    questionnaires from organizations-a real headache
    Clare discovered. As handy man around the office
    and chief paster of pictures, Paul Gilliland moved
    from staff to staff giving assistance wherever
    needed. These students, with the aid of their small
    staffs, frustrated by missing pictures, negatives,
    names and questionnaires, plagued by school work
    undone, deviled by jangling alarm clocks, hindered
    by colds and flu, and saddened by family deaths
    managed to meet every deadline so the Owl could
    once again come out on time.
When the portraits came back from Chidnoff's, Paul Gilliand
became chief picture paster, and if it hadn't been for his persistence and patience there would have been one deadline
missed.
Dotty Hudson, Class Editor, spent most of Christmas vacation looking
for missing pictures, but in spite of the seeming impossibility of keeping
track of over a thousand pictures and names, Dotty did it-and in the
final check the section was in perfect order.
The typing and special section staffs combine their efforts and relaxation.
Barb Millen, girl editor, dressed for the night,
makes the final check on copy to be sent to
Kellers.
The Pitt News
Dave Green decides to make a few changes in
some of the copy.
    The Pitt News went into the Fall semester
shooting for its ninth straight ACP All-American
Award. Under Editor-in-Chief John Kulamer, a
board of seven assistant editors and a staff of 40
reporters and production personnel took on the
job of bringing before Pitt's undergraduate students the highlights of the daily goings on at Skyscraper U. By far the biggest news break was the
rise of the Panthers to pre-eminence on the national football scene. Reporter Russ Franke's
colorful accounts of the team in training and on the
playing fields earned him the plaudits of many
professional sports writers. Sports Editors Boris
Weinstein travelled with the team on many away
games, and besides bringing back material for
his twice weekly columns, did service as a spotter
for Sporitscaster Ray Scott on the side.
John Kulamer, Boris Weinstein, and Nancy Cook discuss a
completed edition of the Pitt News.
The members of the business staff talk over new methods for
obtaining better distribution.
Stanley Goldmann
Business Manager
    Other highlights that kept News staffers
hopping were Political Week, and the weekly
doings of the various student government bodies.
Earning special praise for good, sharp reporting
were staffers Dave Green, John De Ninno,
Elinore Stone, Barbara Schwartz, and Nancy
Cook. Meanwhile, the business staff, under the
direction of Business Manager Stanley Goldmann
kept the financial wheels of the News turning
smoothly. While Comptroller Alan Ziegler kept
tabs on the purse strings, Advertising Manager
Jerry Froimson took over the job of ad selling and
layout. Jack Greenberg, as circulation manager,
had charge of distributing the News on publication days, and Jerry Schulberg managed the classified section.

The Panther
Gerry, Jane, and Al proofread a copy of the Panther before
sending it to the press.
Gene gives Helen a few pointers on setting up one
of the layouts.
    The Panther magazine, long known for its
spicy brand of humor, underwent a complete
transformation this year. The spring issue of last
year's Panther, a parody of True Confessions,
evoked student and administrative action that resulted in the banning of the magazine. A few weeks
later, the Publications Board established a new
magazine which was to be "photo-feature" and
"non-satirical" in nature. Gene Weinstein, sports
editor of the old Panther, finally ended up in the
editor's chair of the new magazine, while Dan
Purdy, another member of the Edgewood Gang,
was promoted from his circulation manager's job
of the previous year to become businiess manager.
Weinstein and Purdy claimed that they would
operate under the slogan, "Dan and Gene will keep
it clean."
Jay tries his hand at drawing a front page cover for the next
issue.
Richard dictates some last minute copy to Jane, who is quite a typist.
       Many students lamented the passing of the
  ribald humor, while others favored the new prod  uct over the old. Whatever the reaction was, al  most everyone agreed that the new magazine was
  new. The emphasis was focused on photo-stories
  and articles about the school. Some of the articles
  in particular, aroused considerable student com  ment. The bulk of the photo-stories were handled
  by Al Horowitz, while Dick Price, the managing
First Row: A. Horowitz, J. Davey, J. Seiner, G. Weinstein, D. Price.
H. Ruff.
      editor, had general charge of lay-out work. Joan
      Seiner, the Panther's nominee for the best looking
      editor on the 8th floor, headed the art department,
      and Jack Davey, a refugee from the Pitt News,
      headed sports. Advertising climbed to a new high
      under Joe Trattner. Don Ringness directed the
      sorority girls who periodically peddle the mag at
      the doors. Mort Perl rounded out the big three of
      the business staff, filling the comptroller's post.

Skyscraper Engineer
        The gang talks over the latest issue of the magazine with the
        greatest of enthusiasm.
          The old adage that two heads are better than
      one was well tested this year on the Skyscraper
      Engineer, as co-Editors Art Hershkowitz and Bill
      Vogt led a small but efficient staff of engineers in
      putting out four editions of the magazine. The
      second complete year for the Skyscraper found the
      magazine an established campus institution, more
      than fulfilling the hopes of the E &amp; M Association,
      the Publications Board, and other early friends
      and sponsors of the publication. Although sold
      chiefly through the seminars in the schools of
      Engineering and Mines, the magazine was widely
      read at Pitt, and had an exchange and mail circu      lation which carried the name of Pitt and abilities
      of its students over the entire country. Such arti      cles as "Underground Gasification" made popular
      reading, only exceeded by the ever-present joke
      page.
These two boys try their hand at pasting layouts for their next
issue.
Edger Daer tells the boys that this issue is one of the best
ever printed.
William Zehala
Business Manager
     The new headquarters and editorial offices
behind the Pitt News on the eighth floor of the
Cathedral brought the staff down off the hill with
the other publications, which proved of great help
to Bill McCoy, Managing Editor, and his production staff-Bill Rimmell and Cas Bazis--
working out the page plans of Layout Editor
Edgar Daer. The regular features in the magazine: "Progressions," "Skycapers," "State's Men,"
and all, were handled by Irv Spangler, Features
Editor. Paul Cannon's camera was responsible
for the covers and a good bit of the inside photography, and Dick Ryabik joined the staff to bring
in that artist's touch which kept those black and
whites from going grey.

March... and time is spent digging into deep texts
for classes or just in walking outside without a coat.
      Before you know, spring will put in a definite
                                     appearance.
PITT IN
Sometimes, however, it's hard to think of spring when
March winds start blowing the last year's dead leaves
about and almost tear away the new green buds just
                                 starting to bloom.

In March nominations are made for Senior
Queen. The announcement of the selections at
the Rose Tea with the out-going queen
presiding, the bewildered surprise of the girls
chosen, and, the final deciding votes fill the
semester with excitement and great anticipation
for the coming coronation.
On March 6th, Dr. Emory W. Luccock was installed by Chancellor Rufus H.
Fitzgerald as the first full-time chaplain in Pitt's history. Many spectators filled the
large Commons Room to watch the ceremony and attended the reception afterwards
to meet and become acquainted with the new Chaplain.
This year's Vocational Fair sponsored by the women's
organizations at Pitt turned out to be a great success. The
variety of colorful and unusual displays attracted many persons
who found ready information and advice available for almost
any career problem. Representatives from the Armed Forces,
Girl Scouts, Air Hostesses and other professional fields were
willing and glad to answer any questions that were posed.
         The Pan-Hellenic Ball is the annual
  inter-sorority formal. This year Baron Elliott
     provided the music while the girls in their
   lovely gowns provided the atmosphere. The               /
 event was high-lighted by the presentation of
the Scholarship cup (announced here by Dottie
      Jacobs) for the highest scholastic average     I
    during the past two semesters, and the new
pledges passed under the bower to receive their
                                     corsages.

                       Delta Sigma Phi
                                                       Christmas was a season of joy this year for
                                                   the brothers of Delta Sigma Phi. It was about that
                                                   time when they moved into their new red brick
                                                   house on Lathrop Street. But it was January be                                                   fore president Greg Bleakley recovered from a case
                                                   of housemaid's knee developed    from  washing
                                                   and waxing floors.
                                                       Besides becoming owners of a fraternity house
                                                  for the first time since the war, the Delta Sig's
                                                  took several other steps up the ladder in their
                                                  climb back to the top. An outstanding accomplish                                                  ment and one to be proud of was a big jump
                                                  in Inter-Fraternity scholarship ranking. Omega
                                                  chapter was one of the few groups to show an
                                                  improvement in quality point average over the
                                                  previous year.
                                                       The Sailors Ball held in February, had the
                                                  actives hanging over the port side. Everything
                                                  was shipshape until someone discovered     that
                                                  a navy enlistment officer had come uninvited.
                                                       The Delta Sig's closed out the year with their
                                                  Carnation Ball. Named after the fraternity flower,
                                                  this affair was held in June after final exams.
                                                  Delta Sig's spruce up before greeting their favorite Pitt co-eds.

At a Delt fall rushing party the Brothers introduced new
freshmen to Delt-style piano playing.
It seems as though the Delt's want to add some blue ribbons
to their well-filled trophy case.
ZEE: _c
     1952-53 was the year of improvements for
president Leo   Kairys and   the Bayard   Street
Delt's.A
    The progressive dance during the homecom-.                                       I
ing weekend was also a housewarming for the
Delt's. Men of Delta Tau Delta worked all summer to redecorate the interior of their house.
White oak paneling and a pale green wall-to-wall                    -
rug were added to the living room. Other improve-;         _--
ments were indirect fluorescent lighting and a
new spinet piano. Several of the upstairs rooms
and a hallway were replastered and painted
contrasting shades. Black tile was laid and all
of the downstairs furniture recovered in red and
blue leather.
     A  decisive victory over Sigma Chi in the
Inter-Fraternity football league finals returned
the trophy to the Delt mantel, a place where it has
often been. This was only one of the honors won
by the Delt's in a highly successful year for them.
                                                         Fraters Black and Hampers laugh at prexy Kairys' attempt to make a

                                                         During the Homecoming Progressive Dance fellow Greeks saw why the
                                                         Delt House had some of the best decorations.

                                                      usually featured Boston Blackie.
                                                      The IF progressive dance in the fall gave KN a real throng of
                                                      Greeks.
    A rushee wandered into the Kappa Nu house
last fall to find an extemporaneous floor show in
progress.
    Buddy Minsky was doubling as the master
of ceremonies and the more audible half of a
duet. Stan Glasser and several other actives were
filling in with a ukulele concert. No sooner was
the first act finished than the Kappa Nu sing
team gave their version of "A Lovely Bunch of
Cocoanuts."
     Impressed by the display of talent the rushee
pledged Kappa Nu and soon learned that Xi
chapter has many men active in school activities.
"Buzzy"    Robbins was a     cheerleader, Larry
Paper was Interfraternity Chairman of the Athletic Manager Committee and Art Hershkowitz
was editor of the "Skyscraper Engineer."
     Second place in scholarship and second place
in volleyball were trophies won by the "Nu's."
     President Danny Berger was the force behind
the installation of a modern, fully-equipped kitchen used to serve meals during the school week.
Plans for improving the basement were also put
into action this year.

A typical part of fraternity life has always been the group
singing around the piano.
This Fifth Avenue spot was best known to Pitt's incoming
freshman class of 1956.

     An "American in Paris" came to the Phi
Delt chapter this year in the form of an East
Bank Apache Party. Couples dressed in Bohemian
costumes danced in the dimly lighted game room
to "Le Jazz Hot." The musicians were "Pig Allee"
imports sent to Pittsburgh especially for the
occasion.

                        "Look, Jack, I will not kiss any babies. I'm
                    too busy trying to get our program organized."
                    These were the famous words of politician and
                    Phi Kap president, Joe Connor, to his fellow
                    politician, fraternity brother, and Student Con                    gress president, Jack Burwinkel.
                        Politics was just one phase of Phi Kap ac                    tivities this year.
                        Fall semester socials opened with the Phi
                    Kap, Phi Ep, and Theta Chi costume party. Little
                    trinkets such as twenty-one jewel wristwatches
                    were given as prizes for the best costume.
                        In November, Major Charles O'Riordan,
                    senior quartermaster of the Pitt ROTC corps was
                    inducted as an honorary member of Phi Kappa.
                        Christmas week was the orphans' party at
                    the house on Dithridge Street. The affair was a
                    success until two of the little visitors tried to
                    play lumberjack with the Christmas tree.
                        The semester ended on a formal note. The
                    men of Mu chapter gave a traditional dinner
                    honoring their house mother for her help and un                    derstanding during the 1952-53 year.

The PiKA's and the Tri Delt's got together again, this time
for Homecoming decorations.
Dinner at the House gives the PiKA athletes a chance to fill
up on filet mignon.
     During the days of the postwar veteran rush
 Pitt's Pi Kappa Alpha chapter had over a hundred
 members. Finding that much can be accomplished
 with so many actives the PiKA's have maintained
 their standing as the largest house on campus.
     Being so big the PiKA's do everything in a
 big way.
     A climax deluxe was walking off with the
Interfraternity All-Point Trophy. This year the.-r
"Pika's" won a fast finish in spring athletics,
which included a first place in softball.
     Winter formal time found the Pi Kappa
Alpha's snowshoeing out to Chartiers Country
Club where they honored their "53" choice for
Dream Girl. After the dance everyone drove back
to town for an early morning bacon and eggs
breakfast.
    Other big affairs were a homecoming and a
Christmas dance in the Norse Room of the Fort
Pitt Hotel.
    Big PiKA men on Campus were John Wallhausser, Secretary of Men's Council and John
Mamaux, Sophomore member of the Intra-Mural
athletic manager's committee.

                                                    Fraternity life must be wonderful-it can even bring smiles to
                                                    fish-eaters.
     A call for a "change" sounded from a bugle
over the flat sports plain of Schenley Oval. Minutes later taps were sounded. Was it a local ROTC
maneuver? No, the occasion was the Pi Lam football victory over the Phi Ep's for the first time in         K K   10
many years.
    Later bugles were exchanged for trumpets
and soft music at the Highland Country Club,
scene of the winter formal.
    Other victories were celebrated by Pi Lambda
Phi throughout the year. Included was an honorable mention in the homecoming house decoration
contest. President Larry Adler built a Pitt football
player kicking a helpless Hoosier over a goal
post. The motif was labeled "Kick'Em in the
End Zone."
    Al Horowitz had his own personal victories.
As an associate editor of the "new" Panther, he
saw the Pitt feature magazine improve and prosper with each edition.
    Outstanding Pi Lam's who led campus activities were Karl Meyers, hardworking business
manager of the Owl and Joe Trattner of the

    A dinner table conversation among several
brothers of Sigma Alpha Epsilon brought up
inter-fraternity social relations.
     "Every fraternity on campus should be better
known to other chapters," said prexy Bob Scott.
    "Agreed!" chimed in "veep"tTug Brenner.
So Pitt's SAE's started a project that ended in an
early spring stag party at North Park, with the
Phi Gamin's, Delt's, and Sig Chi's.
    On the other hand, women had their moment
at the Sig Alph indoor hayride. No smoking was
allowed as hay was piled waist deep on the game
room floor. Corn shocks and pumpkins were
scattered about for decorations.
    The social tempo was maintained at both the
winter and spring formals.
    Time out was taken for activities and the
SAE's moved into several prominent positions on
the eighth floor in the Cathedral. Tom Piemme
and Dick Roman were officers on the Inter-Fraternity Council. Piemme was the News Editor of
the Greek World and Roman was also tapped to
sophomore activities, the Druids.
Sigma Alpha Mu
      Be progressive is the motto of the Psi chapter
  of Sigma Alpha Mu at Pitt. Their latest innova  tion is the Help Week instead of Hell Week dur  ing the pledge initiation   period. "Sammy"
  pledges, instead of going through hazing, gave
  their time to charity organizations. They col  lected clothing for under-priviledged families in
  Pittsburgh slum areas. The active chapter joined
  with the pledges and built a game room in the
  cellar and installed a ladies' gowder room.
      Sigma Alpha Mu's sleight ride in December
 was the highlight of their winter social season.
 The lack of snow was no handicap to the brothers
 who threw hay in the back seats of several con vertibles and drove through the rural countryside
... a winter hayride, no less.
      President Sid Finkel's fraternity men were
 among the most active on the Pitt campus this
 year. Leading the Sammies in the extra curricular
 field were Harvey Rabinowitz, manager of the
 varsity basketball team, Mel Frost, treasurer of
 Men's Council and Mark Friedman, circulation
 manager of the Owl.

          Each year the Sigma Chi's gather round some

     Ever since the founding of Sigma Phi Epsiion in 19oI, this fraternity has been one of the outstanding examples of the friendly spirit which the
University emphasizes in all its social activities.                         X
The willingness of each one of its forty-five active
members to cooperate in all ways is hard to top..   _  -
    All during the year, an active interest was
maintained in many different phases of Campus:
life. Their booth for the spring carnival took first
place and they were very proud to claim the honor
of fraternity basketball section champs. Individually they were well represented: Fred Benson was
an active member of Men's Council; Bill Starn
claimed membership in Alpha Phi Omega; and
Jim  Nagy copped the presidency of Pitt's Ski
Club. But perhaps what they themselves might
consider their most progressive achievement was
the annual Christmas party which they held for
some fifty orphans. There can be no doubt that
the pin which Sigma Phi Epsilon members wear
so proudly is a true symbol of this group-the
fraternity with a "heart."
                                                           Here are two Sig Ep's who played down to their last shirt.

     "Indiana, here's Pitt's Ford in your Future"
was the motif of the winning Theta Chi homecoming decoration this year.
    President Jimmy Cresto's men worked for
weeks to assemble the project. Featured was a
"Model T" Ford with moving wheels. Surrounding the display lighted with neon were three
grave stones representing Iowa, Army, and Notre
Dame, previous Panther football victims. Entered as co-sponsor with Theta Chi was Beta Sigma Omicron sorority.
    After homecoming, the Theta Chi's shifted
their "Ford" into high gear and entered as strong
contenders in the Inter-Fraternity competition.
Participating in the "B" section of the newly

                                                  and two fine dinners. The coronation formal in the
                                                  Spring was one of the best ever held. At the formal
                                                  the fraternity sweetheart was crowned adding the
                                                  final touch to the affair and the school year.
                                                      Inspiration for the entire year was received

     Kappa Beta Phi, the newest of Pitt's social
 fraternities, is continuing the non-sectarian spirit
 of its founders as it grows in number of actives
 and pledges. In the Fall KBPhi took in the largest
 pledge class in its short history, and one of the
 largest on campus. Rushing was far from the high
 spot during the school year, as a well-planned
 social program gave the brothers and pledges
everything they wanted in socials. A Hobo party,
Comic Strip dance, and a Thanksgiving barn
dance were just some of the "idea" parties. And
the President's Ball Spring formal finished the
year with the installation of new officers.
    Prominent in keeping Kappa Beta Phi wellknown on Campus were Al Reuben of Varsity
Debate and prexy Nick Skarvelis, member of the

It's spring! and all the signs appear in their true fashion. Love blossoms out in
the alcoves like the new leaves on the trees; boots and umbrellas appear more
frequently as the April showers are ushered in; and of course, what would April
be without thoughts of that new Easter outfit.
PITT IN
The general lethargy that is so often associated with the coming of the spring
can be cured in many different ways: a good cold shower, a few term papers, or
just good ole' Grandma's tonic-but there's another angle-could be the answer
lies in the old saying, "In spring a young man's fancy likely turns to thoughts of
love."
The first buds of April appear on
the trees when   the cold winds
of March give way to the warm
breezes of April. All over the campus
these small messengers of spring
bring promises of a sunny May.
  The buds are not the only things
  to come out of hibernation for the
  winter. The lawn is once again
populated with the many R.O.T.C.
units getting in shape for the April
                        Review.
SORORITIES/
Alpha Kappa Alpha
Psychology seems to be the
foremost subject in   the
minds of these Alpha Kappa
Alpha's.
Harmonizing on "Old Suzanna" gives these girls a
minute's relaxation before their meeting.
    By the end of June, the AKA's could look
back with satisfaction on a series of successful
enterprises-all made successful by hard work and
originality. The first of three particularly noteworthy activities was the Intro Ball, in October,
at which Negro freshmen were introduced to
Pitt's social life.
    Then in December of the year, Mabel Bookert, representative from Alpha Kappa Alpha,
participated in the Christmas Bouli' in Cleveland, Ohio. The Bouli' is the national convention
of AKA and five other fraternities and sororities.
Besides the business meetings, Mabel had time
to attend many dances, parties, and other conventibn social affairs.
    At the end of the school year, the girls presented a fifty dollar check to the Termon Avenue
Home for Colored Children. All in all, the 1952-53
year of the Pittsburgh chapter of AKA was highly
successful, for the sisters spent the season helping
themselves by helping others.

             "The coat is a grey cashmere for casual after         noon attire and the model is Miss Ann Burns,
         Alpha Delta Pi." Attending the fall fashion show
         at the ADPi house, one might mistake those
         pretty college coeds for professionals. After the
         fashion show there were tables of bridge or you
         could just sit and kibitz with your friends. The
         welcome mat at the ADPi House is always out.
             Thinking of others, the ADPi's entertained
         orphan children at the annual Christmas party.
         Presents, good things to eat, and a friendly chat
         with St. Nick proved to be an exciting afternoon
         for the boys and girls.
             Besides the orphan party, the 1952-53 season
         will bring to the girls' minds: the Black and White
         dinner formal, bringing the ADPi's and their
         dates together for an evening of fun and relaxa         tion; the achievements of Lorraine Gottschall
         on Mortar Board and Senior Court; that cute little
         Alice Huge bustling around in the registrar's            -    --
         office; the times singing "Sweethearts of ADPi"
         with that odd sentimental feeling you didn't
         know that you had about the sorority.           Bernie and Marianne listen as Ann explains
                                                         the intricacies of knitting argyles.

After meeting, the mirror is the busiest spot
in the ADPi house, while the dates stand
waiting in the living room.
These three ADPi's have a friendly fireside
chat before their meeting begins.
    The AEPhi Fathers' Day dinner and Mothers' Day luncheon have become a tradition on the
Pitt campus. One of the few sororities on campus
celebrating these two days, they make many plans
to give due tribute to their mothers and fathers
-even to the extent of writing poetry.
    As part of their social life, the AEPhi's enjoy the annual Mid-Winter Frolic with their
dates at one of the local ballrooms. And then there
was the IF picnic. The Delt's are still talking
about that southern fried chicken and chocolate
cake. The sorority girls proved to the Delt's that
they are handy when it comes to kitchen work.
    Again this year the girls are supporting a war
orphan in another country, a little garcon in
France. Due to the generosity of the AEPhi's, now
this child has many mothers.
    Audrey Cohen, president of Pan-Hel, has
created "close fellowship among the women at
Pitt" by her industrious efforts and progressive
alterations in Pan-Hel council, 1952-53. It must
be contagious because there isn't a friendlier group
of girls than the AEPhi's at Pitt.

    They'll never get all the paint out of their

Boulevard is being redecorated by the hard working sorority girls and the results are amazing.
They all agree that it is good practice... maybe
they have a good idea.
    With lots of applied energy and perseverance
the girls had the apartment finished for their
first party after the West Virginia football game.
It was open house and time for a post-game chat

   S.. mixing big bowls of colored punch for tea

their recreation room for meetings to the Chi Omega's who lost their house in September. Both
sororities agree that it has created lasting friendships between the girls.
    Again this year the Tri Delt's offered a
scholarship to any woman student on campus that
has completed two semesters at the University,
has maintained an adequate scholastic standing,
and has taken an interest in school activities.
    Many Tri Delt girls are outstanding on campus: Rosemary Feil is vice-president of WSGA and
a member of Mortar Board; Dotty Jacobs is vicepresident of Pan-Hel Council. And all the Tri

     "... and those meals at Antoines." New
 friends, long bus tours, swimming parties and
 many informative convention meetings are the
 memories and remembrances that Arlene Scott
 brought back from the Golden Jubilee to share
 with the Omicron Delta Zeta's. A week in New
 Orleans last summer at the general convention
 united Pitt's Delta Zeta's with many sisters from
 all over the United States.
     Some of the convention enthusiasm has
"rubbed off" because the Delta Zeta's are right on

    June 8 was a big day in the life of Josephine
Gallagher and the Kappa Kappa Gamma sorority.
For the third straight year, a Kappa had been
crowned Senior Queen at Coronation. There was
happiness mingled with tears and squeals of delight after the impressive ceremony. The KKG
girls left school for summer vacations knowing
that they had a right to be proud.
    The Kappa's believe that cheer and happiness should be shared with others. At Christmas
time in their beautiful blue room, they entertained the out of town girls who live in their
sorority house. By trimming a large tree, opening
pretty presents, and serving good things to eat,
the Kappa's made many new friends. A few days
later the sorority was hostess to orphans at an
afternoon party. They're busy gals at this time of
the year, but they still find time for their annual
formal in December.
    There are many outstanding girls who wear
the Kappa key: Betty Patterson is president of
Junior Pan-Hel; Ellen Samonas is chairman of
Housing Board and Lonnie Cinqugrani was the
sweetheart of Sigma Phi Epsilon.

Association of University Women, which annually
sponsors a scholarship permitting a foreign student to study in America. This year the Pitt
chapter was honored to have as their guest on the
Phi Mu scholarship, Margrethe Stub of Oslo,
Norway, who is a graduate student in child psychology. Four days before her arrival, the girls
were busily reading about and discussing the
customs of Norway and for days after Margrethe
arrived she was busy telling her adopted Phi Mu
sisters and the Delta Zeta's, with whom she lives,
about her Norwegian home.
    One of the local projects of the Phi Mu's was a
Christmas party for the children at Juvenile
Court, with Santa Claus, movies, gifts, a Christmas tree, and all the gay trimmings.
    The Phi Mu's social activities kept the gals
busy this year with Christmas and spring formals,
bowling, birthday parties, a hayride, and a square
dance.

    The Phi Sig's promoted good Pan-Hel relations by having a joint square dance with DZ's.

    Red and white crepe paper, lace doilies, red
paper hearts, and lots of sorority spirit were some
of the ingredients for a Valentine Day party at
which the SDT's honored the crippled children
from the Industrial Home. That party is a typical
example of the events which highlighted the Sigma
Delta Tau program this year.
    Other philanthropic work included a donation to the National Multiple Sclerosis Fund.
Also, the girls did volunteer hospital work such as
selling candy, magazines and toys, rolling bandages, reading to patients and spreading good
will in general.

    TPA's were busy girls when they worked on
their sorority projects. Seven of the girls spent
many hours working for the Air Force filter center
downtown. This year as every year TPA's sent
money and clothes to the Glenmary Mission, a

rural districts of America.
    A costume party for Halloween, parties for
Thanksgiving, Christmas, New Year's, Valentine's Day, and their extravagant Christmas formal added to the TPA's social life this past year.

The 1952 float parade was organized around Greek and
Roman Mythology with Zeus, Prometheus, Pegasus and
other stories represented. After the float parade, a
Grape Stomp was held in Foster Memorial Social Hall,
carrying through the theme of the whole Spring Festival.
  Kappa Alpha Theta won the
prize for the best sorority float
  with their "Pandora's Box."
Mayor Lawrence, one of the judges in the float parade,
discusses the activities of the spring festival such as the
Soap Box Derby and the many elaborate floats with
Dolores Schaub and Richard Cohen.
                                           In the Fraternity Division of the float parade, Sigma Chi
                                           with their version of "Prometheus Bound" was judged
                                           the first prize winner.
 Yards and yards of crepe paper,
     boxes of tacks and nails and
     many hours of tireless work
went into the planning for all the
   floats. Almost every fraternity
 and sorority was represented by
             an unusual project.
The fine construction and design
   of all the floats entered in the
   parade made it very hard for
 the judges to decide on the win   ner. Although the prizes were
   limited, there were many floats
   that were highly praised even
           though not a winner.

              Congratulations
    It is a pleasure for us to bring you a message of congratulation on
the day of your graduation from the University of Pittsburgh. We
whose college days have long since passed into memory find a particular
pleasure in observing the "commencement" of the new way of life that
starts for you on the day you leave the University.
    Many of you, we hope sincerely, may take up that new way of life
through positions in our great Pittsburgh industries. Some of you will
find your opportunities elsewhere. And still others have plans for further education, which may lead to the arts, science or professions.
    For all of you, whatever the way of life you choose, we of Jones &amp;C
Laughlin Steel Corporation, and particularly those of us who work at
JScL's General Office, wish you the best of luck, and, God willing, a long
and prosperous and happy life.

       In the very beginning, when Pittsburgh was only a cluster of cabins at the
Point, two dreams stirred its soul-a splendid, surging materialism, and a yearning
for cultural growth. That these two have achieved a happy symbiosis is brilliantly
expressed today in the Cathedral of Learning.
       * It could have been a temptation, in this town of teeming potentialities,
to concentrate solely on the practical. Wealth always burgeoned here-in farm
products, coal, iron, glass, oil, and steel. Any man with horse-sense and a right
good will to work, could wrest a fortune from the wilderness, seemingly overnight.
       * This city was singularly blessed though, by the quality of the people who
came here in search of a fuller life. They recognized early a need for the specialized
type of training our industries would require. But they wished, for their sons and
daughters, much more than this. With William Penn they believed that "good
and commendable learning is to be preferred before wealth."
       * A succession of such great men-founders, trustees, chancellors, teachers,
and alumni-have steered our university's destiny from the log cabin Academy
of 1787 to the Cathedral of today. Under their vigil has grown up a special type of
university that marries, in its wide curriculum, both the cultural and the practical.
The Cathedral of Learning, itself a uniquely American architectural expression,
is a symbol of a uniquely American type of education.
       * Also uniquely American was the early development of the food manufacturing business. For more than three generations we have been preparing
ready-to-serve delicacies to save the time and effort of America's housewives.

The Alumni Council
Alumni Association
Greetings to'53,
    To you who are graduating in 1953 I bring the
congratulations of the General Alumni Association
of our great University and a most cordial welcome
to membership with us. You probably know that
you automatically become an alumnus of the
University after graduation. Whether you become
active or just a name on the records is, of course,
your choice.
    As you move into larger areas of responsibility
following graduation, you will be required to make
many decisions. You will meet the challenge by
getting the facts and making a determination. If
space permitted, many facts supporting a decision
to become an active supporting alumnus could be
listed. Here are a few, however: (I) The facilities
you enjoyed during your undergraduate days
which were essential to your education were made
possible in large measures by the active alumni
interest of former graduates; (2) You with others
have the opportunity of continuing those privileges and making Pitt's future outstanding among
the universities of the nation; (3) The Association
through its organizational structure can be a medium of continuing school friendships beyond graduation. In fair judgement, don't you experience a
sense of obligation to share in the work and objectives of our Alumni Association?
    Will you write or contact the General Alumni
Secretary, J. Clyde Barton, 3632 Cathedral of
Learning, for ways in which you can effect continued interest and loyalty to your Alma Mater.
                 Cordially,
                 Paul W. Kearney
                 President, 1952-53

                                                             The campus of Pitt in June is a
                                                             picturesque green carpet with
                                                             many students lolling lazily in the
                                                             shade or basking in the bright
                                            r                sunlight. The trees are literally
                                                             bursting with soft bunches of
                                                             leaves, almost weighing the

                               A                             summer shadows over the grass.
Graduation is the culmination of four long years filled with study, hard work, and fun.
Often a sigh of relief is expressed, but there is always a tinge of regret at closing
perhaps four of the fullest years in a lifetime.

    A classical motif has drawn together the diverse
sections of the 1953 Owl. In the opening pages there are
photographs or drawings of the Winged Victory of Samothrace, Pan charmed by the spirit of Music, three types of
Greek columns, the Thinker. The book attempts to emphasize the value of the faculty to the University, and
through the classical motif to suggest their intellectual
and cultural contributions. On each sub-division page there
is a person or symbol, Roman or Grecian in origin, and a
photograph which are reproduced and an explanation of
both the symbol and the picture is given.
    A second unifying factor in the 1953 Owl is the sequence of time. This factor is also depicted by art work:
modern conceptions of the Zodiac symbols are presented
in the opening picture story and are repeated throughout
the book in the picture stories.

               Busy with activities and com               mittee meetings, worried about
               approaching exams and over-due
               papers, and with no apparent
               let-up, the underclassmen often
feel like Atlas holding the world on his shoulders.

Huston sometimes holds in his home.

           Night Owls
         On this page we are presenting four people                                             r
    whom we shall refer to as "night Owls." These
    people, although unknown to the general student
    body, are old friends of the Owl staff. They know
    the University only as it is at night, not a hustling,
    bustling madhouse as it is during the day, but a
    silent, serene, eerie structure which must be
    watched by night and cleaned by morning. They
    are a small but necessary part of the huge ma    chinery which is the University of Pittsburgh.                    i
    Through the night they work, cleaning up, wash-                   IN.;
    ing the black boards (a job we used to race for
    when we were kids), scrubbing the elevator floors
    (we bet you never noticed), and making the Ca    thedral a shining place in which to carry on our                                                 i
    daily activities. We of the Owl staff, who often
    must work into the wee hours of the morning, feel                                                 I
    that we are fortunate to have the opportunity to
    get to know these people as more than another
    face in the mass of faces or another pair of feet
    that walk through the halls. Because they have
    been so friendly and co-operative with us and be    cause they are great people, we feel that they
    deserve this recognition.
One of our oldest friends is Jim Seymore. Jim runs the elevator during
the night and is very helpful by depriving us of the pleasure of walking                           F

concern for our welfare.

THANKS...
         The 1953 Owl would not be complete without thanking a few of the people withdut whose help,
     advice and encouragement the book could never have been produced.
         First and foremost on my list of people who deserve thanks are the forty-two loyal students who
     worked long hours, giving up many free weekends, to make this year's Owl "the best ever." Of these
     forty-two, special mention must go to Gloria Heneghan, who undertook the task of managing the
     editor. Gloria did a wonderful job consoling and cajoling the editor. No editor could have been as
     fortunate as I was in having such a capable and good-natured business manager as Karl Meyers.
     Operating on a deficit budget, Karl's efforts were successful in giving the Owl a sound financial basis
     and in keeping the editor laughing-even when he cut expenses. To Cynthia Aberman, Dan Berger,
     Jack Caldwell, Clare Cooper, Joan Franz, Don Gwillim, Dahlia Katz, Phyllis Kephart, Shirley
     Schiffman, Doris Secor, Joan Stigers, and Chuck Suprock, I can only say humbly, without you the
     book and I as well, would have floundered and failed. Mention of these staff members is not meant
     to exclude the many others both on the business and editorial staffs who contributed to the success
     of the 1953 Owl.
         Wm. J. Keller Inc. again did a fine job in printing the Owl, and of the many people at Keller's
     who were willing advisers to me, special thanks must go to Mrs. Jewell M. Gates and Mr. Donald L.
     Messinger. Thanks, Jewell and Don, for being so considerate, listening to my problems and answer     ing my many questions.
         This year's cover is not just another cover; it is, rather, another fine example of S. K. Smith Co.
     covers which are distinct and beautiful in design and quality. Many thanks to Mr. Ralph Benz for
     his invaluable advice to me in the selecting and designing of a cover which is in good harmony and
     taste with the book.
          Group and portrait pictures were again taken by Chidnoff Studios. A vote of thanks must go to
     Mr. Frank O'Neill and Mr. Norman Pell for their ready assistance in helping the staff make the big
     January deadline and also to photographers Jack Mitchell, Frank Stoehr, and sales representative
     Irene Blumenthal, whose cooperation and friendliness was greatly appreciated.
         For Mr. Theodore M. Biddle's encouragement and-help a mere thanks can hardly suffice. In
     fact, the entire Dean of Men's staff and secretaries were an invaluable source of information and
     willing assistance not only to me, but the entire staff.
         Without the constant advice and help of the Director of Student Publications, Dr. Denton Beal,
     the 1953 Owl could certainly never have been produced. Thanks to you, D.B., and Mildred also, for
     your ready assistance in tight squeezes and for your sincere interest in the editor's health and welfare.
         Mr. Thomas Jarrett, the University Photographer, supplied us with many pictures and gave
     professional advice to our own photographers. Many thanks, Mr. Jarrett.
         Jane Shaw from the News Service helped the staff many times when we needed information and
     pictures in a hurry. Thanks, Jane.
         In spite of the fact that Leizer Balk, last year's editor, was hundreds of miles away, he never
     lost interest in the'53 Owl. Leiz was a reliable source of information and a staunch supporter and
     encourager.
         Lack of space limits my mentioning more of the friends-the publications people, the Theta's,
     Mortar Board members, "Pop," the Heinz Chapel Choir-who bore with me, encouraged me, and
     who never lost faith in me. To all of you I can only say, thanks.
         Last, but most important, I would like to say a very special thanks to my family, who, although
     they saw next to nothing of me for eleven months, never ceased to be my most loyal supporters and
     constant source of encouragement and strength.
         With sincerity I say that without these friends, the 1953 Owl could never have been produced.
         And now, as I turn over this office, this desk, and this typewriter to the 1954 editor, I wish him,
     or her, a world of luck and good friends to help him make the 1954 Owl "the best ever."

       College
The fifth floor library is the most popular of the three at Pitt.
A College student usually puts in an average of two hours of
library work per day.
Many of the girls in the College are members of sororities.
These groups add greatly to the social life at Pitt. In the Blue
Tuck Flo takes time out for a coke with some of her sorority
sisters, Chi Omega's.
Flo is a member of Student Congress, one of the governing
bodies at Pitt. Helping her do some of the stapling for important notices is Maggie Dowling.
Florence Horn, a pre-med senior in the College, visits with Dean Crawford to check requirements for medical school. (By the way, Flo was
accepted.)
In their last year at Pitt, senior girls have the opportunity to be mentors.
Flo is one of these girls; she acts as an adviser to freshmen girls, counciling
them on scholastic importance, poise, sororities, etc.
Whether they are studying pre-med, pharmacy, or liberal arts, members
of the College must take a year of a science with a lab.
NSTRUCTION in the College curriculum at the University of Pittsburgh is based on the idea that
every student should receive a general education that will prepare him to express himself adequately,
to understand many of the complexities of the world in which he lives, and to perform his duties as
a citizen with intelligence, tolerance, and conviction, and to develop his own maximum capacity for
the enjoyment of intellectual and asthetic pleasures. To meet these needs each student in the College
is required to complete a schedule which includes, without exception, two years of English language
and literature, two years of a foreign language, at least one year of physical education, and eighteen
credits in three principal areas of academic study: the humanities, the social studies, and the natural
sciences. With this type of background, the student picks his major subject to study intensively and
extensively during his junior and senior years. The College in the University is the direct descendant
of the original Pittsburgh Academy founded in 1787... a fact that every freshman student knows
well. It has been responsible during the years fbr creative writers, painters, philosophers, biologists,
geologists, and various other fields. In addition to serving the College students who are registered for
a degree, the College offers courses to students registered in the other schools of the University and
to those preparing for professional school. The College has developed courses to enable the student
to explore many fields of knowledge and to become aware of their relatedness. Dean Stanton C.
Crawford and the personnel staff, with the aid of the faculty and various administrative officers,
endeavor to maintain a close relationship to aid in understanding of the problems of the individual
student, in order to help him work out a good social, educational, vocational, emotional, and in fact,
general adjustment. The entire college curriculum seeks to instill in the student a feeling of personal
responsibility for continuous growth and a desire for a better understanding of the cultural heritage

Laboratory in Thaw Hall is one of many in which students
spend much time as engineers.
Students are pouring a heat from a furnace into a forging. In
the process one student prepares to take a sample.
With the help of another student, Dick tests an ingot in the
reheat furnace.
Dean Fitterer points out to Dick Fehr, a student in metallurgical engineering, plans for a new engineering and mines hall. It will be located on
O'Hara Street; the center portion of this new building will contain six
floors.
In lab class Dick participates in a thermo analysis of steel. All such experiments are conducted in the metallurgical lab.
Learning to operate instruments such as this is part of the education students receive in this mechanical engineering power lab.
HE DEMAND for engineers is reaching an all time high in the United States. Since World War II
the heavy demands made upon industry and manufacturing have demonstrated the necessity for
correct application of modern engineering principles. To meet the atomic age and keep astride of
engineering designs, the University of Pittsburgh plans to erect a new building this summer connecting Thaw and Mellon Halls. The recognition of the need for new facilities is fundamental to engineering progress. The new six story building will provide well equipped hydraulics and strength
of materials laboratories plus many other labs to accomodate all other phases of engineering. The
Engineering and Mines student is one of the hardest working and conscientious persons attending
the university. Always recognizable by a slide rule under one arm, the engineers are usually seen
walking up Bigelow Boulevard to State and Thaw Halls. The engineers' class hours are longer than
the average undergraduate student. He spends approximately eight to twelve hours in lab in one
week and his outside work consists on the average of four hours a night. The College and the School
of Engineering and Mines of the University have entered into a cooperative plan of studies involving
a total of five years and leading to two degrees. A student completing three years of work in the
College and two years of work in the School of Engineering and Mines may satisfy the requirements
for a Bachelor of Science degree from the College at the end of the fourth year and a Bachelor of
Science degree from the School of Engineering and Mines in the department of his curriculum at
the end of the fifth year. The student can choose either plan and is also eligible to do graduate research work in engineering. A concluding point to bring out in the expansion of the research program
is the new arm of research the University has extended to Fifth Avenue. As the present labs became
more crowded, the establishment of this lab became a necessity. All this expansion and extension
may mean nothing to the present-day student now at the University, but in a few years every one
will benefit; the present-day student, the incoming student, and the graduate; for all will face a
brighter and more useful engineering future.

Students who have classes in the Cathedral have three places
in which to eat: Blue Tuck, Red Tuck, and Cafeteria. Paul
prefers the cafeteria since there is more room and a larger
variety of food.
An accounting major, Paul values all the free time he can get.
An average accounting problem takes approximately five hours
of work per night.
College students immediately think of rulers and large yellow
work sheets when Business Administration is mentioned to
them. True to popular belief, the Bus Ad student spends many
hours on accounting. Professor Jablonski instructs one of
Paul's classes.
Dean Lanfear and Paul Hillier, an accounting major in the School of
Business Administration, confer in the Dean's office.
Paul, Eugene Miles, and Karl Meyers, all students in Bus Ad, practice
operating a Friden Calculator.
Paul attends a meeting of Alpha Kappa Psi, honorary Business Administration Fraternity. The organization is open to male students only.
DDING figures is an everyday job in the School of Business Administration. Business law, economics, political science, merchandising, accounting, and insurance classes are only a few of the
courses offered in the University for ambitious men and women. The purposes of the School of Business Administration are: to prepare students for positions of responsibility in the economic and business world and in government; to cultivate those qualities of mind and character which make useful
citizens with high ideals of business morality and social responsibility; to inspire them toward high
standards of scholarship and leadership; and, to develop in them the ability to think clearly and
logically. The school seeks also to establish a sound education in business subjects for those students
who plan to teach, enter the legal profession, or further their education through graduate study; to
bring about an understanding of the relationships between individuals, business and the community;
and to disseminate knowledge in the field of economic and business affairs, with particular reference
to the important industrial community in which the University of Pittsburgh is located. Speaking
broadly, four years in the School of Business Administration should lead to a successful and socially
useful career in business. Completing the spring of the senior year, representatives from approximately fifteen different companies invade the graduating ranks in the School and interview students
for jobs. Normally, the interview rush is a spring rush. The numerous interviews are arranged by
the Placement Bureau of the University. Out of town companies and accounting firms make appointments with the Bureau and forms showing the interview times are posted on the twentieth floor.
More and more, business is demanding university trained men and women. Every year a number
of former students who have left before graduation to enter business return to complete their
education. The several departments of the School of Business Administration offer a complete
program of graduate courses and seminars leading to Masters degrees.

Teaching a child to write is a challenge to both the student and the
teacher. Ethel, and all teachers, are very proud when they see the boys
and girls whom they are teaching, master this skill.
Reading is taught to the children before they begin to write. To aid the
class, the teacher uses word-cards placed on the board. These words can
be interchanged, thus enabling the boys and girls to better grasp the
meaning of the word.
Ethel and Mr. George W. Hoffman, Director of the Teachers Appointment Bureau and Assistant Professor in Education, take a forward
look to Ethel's career.
Dean Franklin and Ethel Ross, a senior in education, check the University Bulletin to see if Ethel has the required subjects for graduation.
In their senior year, all education students practice teach. A practice
teacher for the first grade at Frick School, Ethel teaches the boys and
gitls a new game.
Helping the children dress is an enjoyable task to Ethel. Her education
prepares her for handling all eventualities with finesse and finality.
HE PRIMARY concern of American education today is... to cultivate in the largest number of
our future citizens an appreciation both of the responsibilities and the benefits which come to them
because they are American and free." The above quotation of purpose may be one of the many
reasons why so many enthusiastic students are preparing to be educators. The School of Education
at the University of Pittsburgh has one of the largest enrollments in the undergraduate schools.
Application for admission to the school is made in the last semester of the sophomore year. The
students must meet the strict standards of the school and have at least sixty-two credits in college
work before they make application. Following their admission they study specialized courses for
teaching methods, tests and measures, and psychological development of the child. The student who
plans to teach must have a broad and extensive education to meet the progressive age in which he
is living. They must be prepared to meet the constant ways of the younger generation. Nowadays
children are helping to educate themselves by watching television and their very receptive minds
need guidance. The basic principles of education will never change, but the education of the students
in schools today is becoming more extensive and specialized, requiring the instructor to also learn
while instructing. To meet this need, Pitt offers courses requiring the students to observe classes in
schoolrooms around the general Pittsburgh area. The students prepare lesson plans and experience
the everyday planning a teacher must do. At Pitt the four fields in the School of Education are
Secondary Education, Physical Education, Elementary Education, and Business Education. During
the first two years in the college, an education student's schedule consists of English, geography,
biology, and other related sciences and general education classes. During the four year college life of
the student, special programs, speakers, and conferences are arranged by the Dean of the school.
Education sororities, fraternities, and honoraries such as Delta Delta Lambda and Alpha Beta
Gamma challenge the students to consistently maintain high scholastic standing.

The Dent students are given thorough instructions on X-raying a patient's mouth.
     Pitt's school of Dentistry has always had the
objective of training students in the diagnosis,
treatment, and prevention of oral diseases, and
the enabling of the student to meet effectively the
responsibilities of dental practice. To this end the
social, economic and ethical relationships of the
profession are stressed.
     From thousands of applications received
yearly, the University of Pittsburgh School of
Dentistry selects only the most capable men for
enrollment in their school, really one of the finest
in the country. Building from a firm basis in the
sciences, the student is given thorough training
in the most modern techniques of scientific anatomy, prosthesis, histology and the many related
sciences. In his junior and senior year, the Dent
student has an opportunity to put theory to practice as he works in the infirmary.
    The University of Pittsburgh School of
Dentistry was established on April 20, 1896 as
the Pittsburgh Dental College. Since that time it
has grown considerably in both size and improvements. The present buildings are well equipped
with modern dentistry tools and improved teaching apparatus.

These Dent students are studying
dental cleaning techniques.
In their junior year, Dent students begin work in
the clinic. Practical experience like this gives them
valuable training for future years.
Students have constant guidance from professors
in their clinical work; here the student discusses the
patient's X-rays with the professor.

SCHOOL OF NURSING
The student nurses trim the tree for the arrival of Saint Nick.
     At Ellsworth Center, the nurses have a small
 part of Pitt all their own this year. Almost all of
 the nursing classes have been scheduled in the red
 brick building for the I952-53 session.
     The faculty and students are able to meet
together through the Student-Faculty Nursing
Association. The Association     works through
special committees composed of both faculty and
undergraduates, which does much to enrich the
lives of the student nurses.
     At the end of the preclinical period, beginning
 students receive their first honor of recognition
 at the "capping ceremony." The Black Banding
 ceremony at the beginning of the senior year is
 the second stepping stone to a career in nursing.
 The final recognition for students of nursing is the
 Pinning ceremony at the end of the basic profes sional program.
     At the end of their five-year training program,
the nurses may schedule further specialization
work at the University or enter their professional
careers with a sense of security based on the
knowledge of the excellent nursing education that
they have received.
Not only must a nurse be adept at administering a hypo, but she must
also be a part-time dietician. Here, the girls practice on themselves by
preparing a well-balanced lunch.

SCHOOL OF PHARMACY
Another ounce is needed to complete this prescription.
    The Pitt School of Pharmacy, although
located on the Boulevard of the Allies, is a very
important part of the University. Pharmacy
school students are an especially close, well-knit
group with a strong sense of fellowship and cooperation. The group publishes its own newspaper, The Pitt Capsule, and has organized an
active student council. Besides busy classroom
and lab work, the senior class annually takes two
trips to Parke-Davis in Detroit, Michigan and
Eli Lily in Indianapolis, Indiana. Prominent
visiting speakers in pharmacy and its allied fields,
stimulating seminars, and visits to pharmacy
laboratories provide a full schedule for these students.
    A student branch of the American pharmaceutical Association provides an excellent link
with the practicing pharmacists. Dean E. C.
Reif and his fine staff believe in a well-rounded
education and have encouraged many social
events each year. The new equipment and research laboratory provided added incentive for
high scholastic achievement.

                                                           Founded in 1918, the Retail Training Bureau
                                                       was organized as a cooperative venture between
                                                       major Pittsburgh stores and higher education for
                                                       the purpose of developing future store executives.
                                                       The close and sympathetic cooperation has con                                                       tinued through thirty-five years.
                                                            Of particular advantage to students is the

                                                       of Pittsburgh, long recognized as "the city of
                                                       department stores." Pittsburgh, therefore, serves
                                                       as the ideal laboratory in training for careers in
                                                       retailing. Students work under a program which
                                                       coordinates university classroom    instruction by

                                                       in prominent retail stores. Classroom    theory is
                                                       tested in actual working situations, an opportunity

Retail students study in the world's largest library of books
and periodicals exclusively on retailing subjects.

                                                                      This student is taking a quick glance between classes to keep
                                                                      up with the world of retailing news and fashion.
        The research division of the Bureau, which
   seeks the better ways of performing retailing func   tions, develops studies based on research in Pitts   burgh's department stores. While working on
   these living problems, students have the oppor   tunity of applying the methods of retail research.
       A  master's degree is earned upon successful
   completion of the year's study.
       The i9th and 2oth floors of the Cathedral of
   Learning are the home of the Retail Training
   Bureau. Here is complete concentration on retail   ing, from  specially designed classrooms to the
   world's largest library devoted exclusively to
   books and periodicals on retailing subjects. These
   floors also include the retail research division,
   faculty and administrative offices, and student
   lounge.
       The Director of the Bureau is Professor's
  Bishop Brown who has been associated with the
  Bureau since 1929 and has been its Director since
  1936. In this capacity he has helped ahd inspired
  hundreds of Bureau students who are now execu  tives in retailing the world around.
Two underclassmen make appointments at the Student Desk to
donate blood for the Pitt Blood
Drive. Underclassmen played an
important part in putting the
Drive over the top.
Students often make dates to
meet in the libraries and study
together. There is always some
question as to how much studying is done, but it is an interesting way to spend the off-hours
between classes.
Although the 1953 Owl is thought of primarily as
the seniors' book, it is also important to the underclassmen who greatly outnumber the seniors. They
too combine activities with studies and social life
to make up life at Pitt.
The fifth floor delivery room is often the busiest in the
University. This is especially evident when the underclassmen realize that their final term papers and book reports
are due.
