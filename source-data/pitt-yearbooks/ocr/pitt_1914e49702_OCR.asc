GEORGE M. BEVIER.
Pittsburgh, Pa.

The travelling salesman for Bevier Co. Can’t see how he ever
arrived at all because he is so quiet.

KEN ICHI BAN.
Tokyo, Japan.

The only Bull of his class. To him everything is “soft.” Supposed
to be quite an athlete but could never ﬁnd in what line except the bread
line and shining counters.

JOHN S. DYMOCK.
Calumet, Mich.

Most noticeable thing about John is_ that he is, or was, the most
consistent winner that ever played. Who will ever forget those few days
before Christmas? John wanted to go home and maybe he didn’t hustle
for carfare. We thought he was quiet but what is the odds? He is a
fine fellow nevertheless. It is said he has been in Pittsburgh (city) only
to come and go from his home. I wonder how he puts in all his time
at the house? Ten to one its a girl. More power to you, John. ‘

PAUL X. GEARY.
Wilkinsburg, Pa.

Paul why are you so discontented? Girls? No, I don’t believe it.
You never bothered them. “That is, almost never.” No we won’t forget
the banquet. That is too good. We ﬁnd that you are the only real miner
excepting Bernard, who approaches the Houghton product. '

CHALMERS HALL. <I)Z(I).
Pittsburgh, Pa.

You surprised us all, old boy. Thought you were a real “Miner.”
Sorry, we hate to lose one of your ability.

Did you happen to know Chal is some athlete? How about that race
and baseball game in Wallace? Hard to believe I’ll admit from other
performances. Let us hope you do better the next time. Also holds the
honor of being the best Bear in the school.

WILLIAM R. KERR.
Youngstown, Ohio.

The best you ever did Bill was to shake "the Rip.” Here you are
a ﬁrstrate Socialist. The almighty dollar sure has wings, don’t it now?
Says “Nix on suffrage, the women will vote as the men because they have
to eat to live and to live we cannot cut the tariff on steel.”

M. CAMPBELL MCNARY.
Ingram, Pa.

Cam, to hear you talk Ingram must be some fast little town. Easy
to be seen you knew your job on coming around this year. Experience
is some teacher where a “game” is concerned. You have one bad fault,
springing that classic stuff on the Miners. How do you expect us to “get
you P”

NORBERT D. MURPHY. ’
Calumet, Mich.

Has the sunniest disposition of them all, and, like the rest of the
Irish, is a glutton for.work. Murphy is the janitor of the Mining labor-
atory, also chief librarxan in the oﬁice where he is employed in ﬁling away
thoughts for the future,

C1... R011

PAUL L. SIMPSON. <I)Z(I).
Monaca, Pa.

Slow waters run deep it is said, so here is a warning. Paul is a
thoughtful fellow. I have seen him play four games of ball at the same
time showing the great development he has attained since coming to Pitt.
It 1nay be said that he led the league in hitting which is a record the
Mining School should be proud of.

EDWARD H. SLOAN, EX.
Pittsburgh, Pa.

— Ed is some thinker. The thoughts come and go so fast they set
his head in :1 whirl and he always ﬁies off at a tangent to the main
question. At that rate there is no wonder Ed thinks he can put any
Prof.’s eye out.

ARTHUR P. WRIGHT.
Pittsburgh, Pa.

The man who eats, drinks and thinks in terms of R. H. J. He says
“that man is some bird—1ne for it.” He is a sticker for facts but theory
is his hobby. If you notice, he has the best memory of them all. Ever
notice how chummy A. P. VV. and John were? There was a method
to this man. Found out that for the two of them there was no limit
to their earning powers.

OTTO F. VVENZ.
Urach, Germany.

Our sunny ‘haired Teuton. May he always achieve his goal. Thinks
everyone IS trying to get him. Don’t worry, Otto, “all’s well that ends
well.” ~

WALTER JOSEPH ALLEN, ZAE,
Wilkinsburg, Pa.
“Walt” is the most modest man in the University. He wouldn’t let
us tell you he was Captain of the Baseball Team, Editor of the OWL and
a lot of other things. He doesn’t believe in class histories and individual

“writeups.” He thinks slow, but when he reaches a conclusion Company
“A” couldn’t move him. How Walter enjoys his thinking!

91

MARCUS A. FOLLANSBEE, AA.
Pittsburgh, Pa.

To know you is a pleasure. Your amiable disposition has helped
to cheer us all. Tell us you are not going to leave. Marc is one of the
best dancers in the school. Ranks second only to Arthur P. The exhi-
bitions given last term were the equal of any seen in Pittsburgh. The
Miners will back him against all comers.

WOLFGANG  BERNARD.
Pittsburgh, Pa.

“Our dancer of the slender swords.” Earned it by hard work too.
VVhat did you say? Why the champion fencer's medal. Don’t think
so worse of him because of that, he is not one bit effeminate. If you
don’t believe ask a good “Miner.”

WALTER G. FLOOD.
Pittsburgh, Pa.
A newcomer in our school but well known as a tennis shark. Look
to your laurels though we have some sharks right among us.

F. ARTHUR JOHNSON.
Ben Avon, Pa.

Nobody would think to look at you that you are out for the “all
round gym” record. Here’s wishing you the best of luck.

YE BEH. LIENG.
Huinan, China.

“Silence” is his handle but don’t worry he is not as dangerous as he
looks.

MARCELLUS I. MOSS. ,lr., EAE.
Pineville, Ky.
This man is Straw’s only competitor in the race for the “Ladies’
Man” honor. My how you follow that brotherly example of other days.

93

GEORGE W. MYERS.
Lancaster, Pa.

George is the only man who can beat Arthur at his own game. After
an interesting lecture one day our president said: “There is a fellow I
admire, with one hours notice he can get up and give the best talk ever
(and without batting an eye, too) better than I could give with a week’s
notice.” This is the n1ost we can say of George because he is too quiet
to get a good line on him.

LOUIS S. PANYITY.
New York, N. Y.

Wouldn’t “Sandy” suit you better as a nickname? Then maybe you
would feel more like the rest of us and come in now and then.

EDWARD F. STRAW. Jr., (I)A(-).
Pittsburgh, Pa.

Here is a good man, but we shall not forget you failed us once,
yes, twice. We remember well how you said “Why no I can’t come be-
cause the girls are going to give a play at P. C. W. and I am to go.”

Here is our typical “Miner.” An athlete from the word go. To see

EPHRIAM FRUHLINGER.
Johnstown, Pa.

Such a quiet fellow, much addicted to study. More power to you
but don’t forget you are one of us.

VERNON HOFFMAN.
Pottersville, N. J.

Someone asked me at a wrestling match one night, “Why don’t that
fellow cut his hair?” Can’t say why, but even at that he is good looking.

GEORGE T. MCDONALD, Jr.
Pittsburgh, Pa.

“Red” is some tlyer so be careful of the track because he is so small
you can’t see him coming at all.

FRANK P. MILLER.
Scottdale, Pa.
Our good natured “Foxy,” who is too accustomed to helping put up
the shutters at Abbey’s. \Ve would have liked you better at first if you
hadn’t worried Muller so much. He was such a nice fellow.

HARRY D. SHOF.
Herminie, Pa.
Did you ever stop to hear :1 train thunder past you? If not come
around when Harry has on the spikes. It sure is a real picture except
he uses hot air instead of steam.

WALTER S. SIMMON.

Pittsburgh, Pa.
Here is some advice “old boy.”

You hear it everywhere “\/Vatch Thomas.” Why? Well, “he thinks

OUR years ago the School of Economics of the
University of Pittsburgh was founded. In the
four years that have lapsed since that great
W, event the School of Economics has come for-
ward with a speed that would make Mercury look like a
snail. Under the able leadership of Dr. John Thom Holds-
worth, our school has risen to a place of prominence among
the schools of the University,—perhaps there is no school
of all the schools of Pitt that is bringing as much favor-
able publicity to the University as the four year old Econ-
omics School.

Let us introduce to you some members of the faculty
of the School of Economics and some of the students, that
you may be able to tell why it is such a great school.

Our Dean, Dr.  T. Holdsworth, does more work
than any other two men in the city put together, and like
Christy Mathewson, he uses his “brain” when he works.
He has more dope inside his head than a healthy VVebster,
and when it comes to aml)ition—he is the guy that put
the “pep” in pepper. He has traveled all over the United
States and Europe and some parts of Philadelphia. He
is the right hand man to the Mayor of Pittsburgh a11d the
legislature at Harrisburg. He will survey any city in
the United States at a classy rate and give the right dope

on how to make things better. As an instructor, he is
faithful to and considerate of the best interest of the men
that are under him. His one ambition, above all others,
is to make the School of Economics of the University of
Pittsburgh the best of its kind in the world. VVe believe
that he will some day realize his dream.

Dr. Francis Newton Thorpe—If you want to know
anything about this man, get down the latest “Who’s
Who” and read the several chapters that are devoted to the
worthy gentleman and distinguished scholar. To use
baseball language, “Dr. Thorpe made a hit the ﬁrst time
111) in a Pitt uniform and has been batting 1,000 ever since.”
He is the man that put the iron in irony: Notwithstand-
ing the fact he spares no person in his classroom wittic—
isms, no person was ever known to get riled at any re-
mark he made, for every student understands that he has
no better friend in the University than Dr. Thorpe. Sim-
plicity of manner and an abiding faith in his fellowman is
his creed. One of the questions that worries every student
is, \Vhat Political Party Does Mr. Thorpe Belong To?
He has never stated in class just where he stands in the
Political ﬁeld, but we are certain of one thing—he is not
for T. R.

Prof. Ira G. Flocken—Prof. Flocken is the little Holds-

worth of the University. He has his office right next to
the dean and is the right hand man to the head of the
school. As an accountant, there are few in the United States
that are the equal of Prof. Flocken. There is only one thing
that he ever tried to do and failed in doing and that is to
keep Dick Johnson awake in class, but no man should be
blamed for not being able to do that which is impossible.

Dr. T. W. B. Crafer—VVhen the boys get together
at the fraternity houses and other places, they do not say
Dr. Crafer, but rather “Tom” Crafer, thus showing that
the doctor is counted as one of the boys, a high honor.
VVhen it comes to matters of sociology and settlement
work, the whole world may well come to Dr. Crafer for
advice. The work that is being done by the members of
his classes in settlement work in the city of Pittsburgh
has received the highest commendation from the city au-
thorities. ‘‘Tom’’ has one failing—he persists in wearing
a Prince Albert coat to school two or three days a week.
However, this is not an unpardonable sin. They say that
the Doctor may get married, providing Holdsworth stays
away from his office enough to permit him to present his
case to Holdsworth’s secretary.

Howard Carson Kidd——Captain Kidd is a most loved
instructor in our school. All upper—class1nen swear by
him. His course in railroad transportation was becoming
dry so he changed to oceanic transportation. He is the
Prof that took the “con” out of economy.

T. R. Williams—“Teddy Roosevelt” Williams, as he

101'

is called by the fellows, is the official dispenser of journal-
istic knowledge at the University of Pittsburgh. The
course in journalism was organized about two years ago,
and since that time has gained great headway, under the
direction of Mr. \\’illiams. Mr. VVilliams is managing
editor of the Pittsburg Press and on the advisory board
of THE PITT V\'EEKLY—he says that the Press posi-
tion is a cinch compared to THE VVEEKLY. As to his
ability as a teacher, just one example: “Monk” \’Vasson
is taking the course in journalism; is handing in every
assignment, and doing real, honest work—can you beat it?

Now for the students of the school and what they
have done to make themselves felt in the life of the Uni-
versity.

If there is a class ﬁght on, who leads the Fresh and
Sophs to battle? Some member of the School of Econ-
omics, in nine cases out of ten, will be found at the head
of the opposing forces, because we make leaders in the
school. Who takes the lead in all the student functions
at the University? Some hard—working member of the
School of Economics. How many of the positions on the
debating teams have been won by members of the college
during the past two years? About six out of a possible
I6—and the rest ?—from the School of Economics. \/Vhen
you want to hear some real good singing, do you go to
the Grand Opera? Not much—not while you have a
chance to liste11 to the Economics Quartette. Who rushes
out everytime there is a class ﬁght and raves around and

F‘-.

claims that he will expel half a dozen men? Not an Econ-
omics professor. They are all human and are able to re-
member the time when they were in college, and remem-
bering, they have patience with the student and the stud-
ent appreciates the situation and does not go the limit.
\/Vho founded the Pitt V\'eekly? Frank Stewart, who last
year graduated from the School of Economics. And so it
goes that everything that is alive in the University has a
more or less intimate relation with the Holdsworth depart-
ment.

VVhen those that are now members of the student
body of»the University of Pittsburgh have grown old and
feeble and the greater portion of the experiences of col-
lege life has passed out of their memory forever, events
connected with the School of Economics, and the work
accomplished, and the pranks played by the members of
that school will linger; who, until his eyes close for the last
time, can ever forget the name of Stambaugh, the mighty; of
Wasson, the genial idiot; of J. G.‘ Quick, the tenor and
head of the Y. M. C. A.; of “Bud” Davies, the man who

could tell stories that Dickens never thought about, of
Roger K. Patton, the Penrose of Pitt; of Frank Stewart,
reporter, editor and statesman; of Dr. Crafer, author of
the two famous lectures: (I) “\\'hy_is it," and (2) “Because,”
which are replies to a lecture of Dr. J. T. Holdsworth, who
coined the dramatic expression “Only yesterday, as time
goes;” of V\«'. H. Colbert, who wrote “Cutting Classes
Make Your School Days Longer.”

But let us now close the story. The writer has been
rather partial to the School of Economics——but every man
loves his own school. There are great men in every de-
partment of the University and every department of the
University should work for the good of the whole Uni-
versity. The School of Economics is bound to grow and
increase from year to year and school pride will grow in
like proportion, However, there is not a man in the School
of Economics that is 11ot working for the welfare and
betterment of the University at large, for, after all.
we are all going to the UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH.

Junior History

(A Tragedy-Comedy)

Players: Dr. Holdsworth, Dr. Crafer, Dr. Thorpe,
Prof. Flocken, Prof. Kidd, Dr. Bishop, Prof. \/Venrich, and
Prof. Fettermann. A number of students.

Time: Sept. 24, 1910.

Place: Steps and lower ﬂoor of Thaw Hall.

Act I

(A group of 15 or 20 handsome, clean—cut young fel-
lows ascend the steps and enter ﬁrst ﬂoor.)
Prof. Wenrich: (See students and hurries to Dr. Bishop’s
ofﬁce.) “Doctor, quick, here is the ﬁnest group
of boys that ever entered Pitt.” i
D. Bishop: (Hurries out into hall.) “Ah, my young
friends, I presume you intend to enter the best
school in the University?”
Students: “We do.”
Dr. Bishop: “Step right into my office and register.”
Student: “Is this the School of Economics?”
Dr, Bishop: “No, this is the School of Engineering.”
Students (in chorus): “VVe said we wanted to enter the
best school.”
Dr. Holdsworth, (hearing commotion in the hall, opens

I05

his door. Speaks in a business-like manner.) “Did
somebody want me?” ‘

Students: “\Ne desire to enter the School of Economics.”

Dr. Holdsworth: “Just in a moment, gentlemen. There
are not enough chairs in my office to accommodate
all of you.” (He sends for Prof. Flocken, who en-
ters from right.) “Prof. Flocken, get some regis-
ter cards, and see that these men get the proper
courses.”

(Enter Dr. Thorpe and Prof. Kidd.) Dr. Thorpe: “It
is altogether ﬁtting an(l proper that they should do
this. I hold it self—evident that these men know a
good thing when they see it.”

Prof. Kidd: (shrrouiirled by a group of upper classmen,
who swear by him), “This is great. This is ﬁne.”
(At this point a tall gentleman, with curly locks, and
Carrying a green school bag enters. He talks in a
loud deep voice.)

Dr. Crater: “Surely, this exodus of handsome men from
their hearthsides is remarkable”.

‘(Telephone rings.)

Dr. Holdsworth (answers) “Hello, yes, Dr. Frost, I’ll

send them right over to matriculate and pay their
tuition.”

(As the students prepare to leave, Dr. Holdsworth, over-
come with admiration, speaks.)

Dr. Holdsworth: “Fellows, I see a great future ahead for
Pitt. Most of the bequests to our institution in the
past have been made by bankers and prominent
men. \\'hen I get all your brains together Pitt will
control the money world. Then we will build an
Economics building. Come to assembly next
VVe(lnes(lay, yon’ll hear more about it.”

(Sophs enter and lead our Freshmen.)

Dr. Bishop: “I'll have revenge. Never will I allow them
to sing in the halls or smoke on the steps.”

Dr. Fettermann, (looking out of window in State Hall).

“Alas, an(l all in the School of Economics. Why
can’t the College get men like this? (He reﬂects a
moment, and then turns to his assistant. Prof.,

go out and see if you can ﬁnd me a prettier secre-
tary than Dr. Holdsworth’s. Maybe it will help
to make the College more popular.”

Act II

P1ace~Stage of Life.
Time—I935.
Setting—A goal, for which all strive.

The engineers are individually seeking to build a ma-

I06

chine or structure to reach the goal. They all fail for lack
of capital.

The college students are poring through the classics
to see how the ancients did it.

(Enter some graduates of the School of Economics.)

They look at it a few moments, consider the cast, and
then sell stock to obtain capital. 7 Pay the engineers to do
the rough work and then mount to the goal. They then
assist the simpler—minded students to attain an end by
using the structure, charging a nominal fee for admission
and transportation.

Such was the introduction some two score young fel-
lows received when they entered the University of Pitts-
burgh in the fall of I910,

And right well did our good Dean rejoice at the ac-
quisition and Dr. Bishop worry, for out of that group have
emerged the MEN who run the University. In three
short years they have held the following oﬂices: Freshman
football and base l)all manager, Fresh class treasurer,
Sophomore class secretary, four out of eight men on the
best debating team Pitt ever had, two “varsity” manager-
ships, swimming and base ball; chairman of the Junior
“Prom” Committee, and vice president, editor and man-
ager of the OWL, and president of the Junior Class. A
total of 16 ofﬁces out of 25 chances.

And if their “Square Deal Dean” had not restrained
them they might have taken the other nine. But he is for
Pitt ﬁrst and the School of Economics second and all the
time and so are his men in the class of 19-14.

 

 

HAROLD _T. APPLESTEIN.

Pittsburgh Central High School. University of Pennsylvania.
Varsity Debating Team.

This learned gentleman is sometimes called “Doctor.” When you
hear “But Doctor Holdsworth, I believe,” you know Applestein is about.
Loves to argue with Dr. Crafer who takes him seriously. He almost
whipped Wooster this year and they tell us he is some debator. Heavy
with surface theories.

OLIVER CROMWELL CAMP, (I)Z(D.

Mercersburg Academy. Chairman Junior Prom Committee.

Freshman Dance Committee. Freshman Banquet Committee. Stud-
ent Senate. Class Football. Class Baseball. Cap and Gown Club.

“Ollie is one of those fellows, whom when you have once met, you
cannot forget. Occasionally gets sore, but soon forgives and forgets and
is a truer friend than ever. Made a great hit at the “From” and created
a graceful ﬁgure in one dance with his girl. Who tripped you, Shorty?
He holds a minor record as a politician.

Organizations Editor Pitt Weekly. Chairman School Banquet Com-
mittee. Y. M. C. A.

All busy men must have some diversion. And since Bill became editor
of the OWL he is the busiest man in school. We believe his diversion is
love. Pennsylvania was going Democratic until T. R. got Colbert to
ride the Bull Moose all over the state. A previous OWL said he was a
shark in his studies. He was until Student Activities got him. Now
he argues for credits. Not appreciated by Dr. Thorpe whose philosophy he

worships. Interested in Washington, Pa. immensely. Why?
ELLSWORTH KUHN DAVIES,CI>Z(D.
Munhall High School. Class Baseball. Glee Club.

The muffler on a six cylinder could not keep Bud from being heard.
When late for class, ascending the stairs he sings, “When the roll is
called up yonder, I'll be there.” Stars in Crafer’s classes because he can
say “Doctor” so well. A member of the Money and Banking (Econonics
4) Quartet. Mainstay in the Glee Club for three years. A bit of free
advice, Never take him to see your girl.

ROBERT B. FORMAN, (I)Z(I).

Bellefonte Academy. Vice President Junior Class.

The only good bet the School of Economics ever lost was “Bob.”
He migrated to California without giving us a chance to hold a farewell
dinner party. He clung close to his friends and few others were able
to fully appreciate him. One of the best fussers in Pitt. Always ﬁrst
to pay any “taxes” and always seen double at Pitt affairs.

JOSEPH GRAHAM GARDNER, AA.

Allegheny High School. Sporting Editor of 1914 OWL. Class
Baseball. Y. M. C. A.

Joe is the handsomest man in the Junior Class. Liked by all who
know him. Joe was not a shark in class in his Freshman year but since
has settled down to work. We don’t know whether he is in love or not.
Something is the matter with him at any rate or he would never have
undertaken such a hard job as Sporting Editor of 1914 OWL.

Pittsburgh Central High School.

President of the Junior Class.
“Varsity” Baseball Manager. Freshmen Baseball Manager. Junior
Prom Committee. Freshmen Dance Committee. Cap and Gown Club.
Y. M. C. A.

Bobby is the most loved student in Pitt. Never made an enemy and
yet he always gets what he wants. He was the Boss on the great Zeta
Steam Roller. Can round up more votes in an hour than Penrose in a
month. Knows all the fair ones; had the best looking girl at the Prom.
Owns stock in all the girls’ prep schools and is on the Board of Directors
at Vi/inchester. Also knows a good bunch of fellows when he sees them.

RICHARD RAYMOND JOHNSTON, EX.
Beaver Falls High School. Head Cheer Leader.

Club. Athletic Committee. Y. M. C. A.

“Dick” hails from the_Ohio valley. He is known by those who do
know him as the “Cocky Kid.” The best cheer leader Pitt ever had.
As a singer of coon songs has upheld the honor of the Cap and Gown
Club for three years. He was the hit of this year’s show, although he
was a bum. How a sporty chap like “Dick” can play a hobo part is be-
yond us. He is also in love.

Cap and Gown

 

 

CLARENCE RUBEN HELT, AA.

Bellevue High School. Student Senator.
Chief I914 OWL. Cap and Gown Club.

“Rube” is the J. P. Morgan of Pitt. He can get more money with
less effort than any man in Wall Street. Lives in Bellevue and will admit
it if you corner him. Declares Canton is the worst town on the map
because the only “chicken” he could find was served at the hotel. Be-
came Manager of the OWL to reduce his weight. But he failed. He al-
ways smiles and never says “I should worry.”

Business Manager-in-

RODGER T. SCHENK, EX_

Bradley Polytechnic Institute. Varsity Baseball.

This keen cut chap has a piercing look that smacks of a 120 horse
power brain. He is also the best third sacker Pitt ever had. He is batting
400 in the fussing league. When he talks he says something that makes
you think. He likes to be where there’s lots of room that’s why we ex-
pect to see him at the top some day.

109

CHARLES SLAVENS, CIJFA.
Greenﬁeld, (Ohio.) High School.

Ohio Wesleyan. Student
Pan—Hellenic Club. Vice Chairman School Committee.

“Chuck” is a guiet unassuming chap that does things and does them
right without causing a ruffle of comment. He was largely responsible
for the greatest school banquet ever held at Pitt. Says little and. thinks
much. What Slavens says he will do. Never known to break an engage-
ment. He is a man from his shoes up to his square shoulders and there
is a head on those shoulders.

Senate.

CHARLES PALMER POWELL, ASH.
Class Football. Student Senator.

“Pi” is gone on his “lil” queen. Takes her to every Pitt affair which
is very nice. The fellows from his home town think well of him so he
must be all right. He was almost champion in the 220 yard swim but
luck was against him. Loves his prep school and Shadyside Academy?

Sophomore History

F  REAT as our class is it had an ignominous begin-
Es; ‘I ning. What one of us but does not remember
that morning when we ﬁrst appeared on the
, campus in the hopes that we might be taken for
a Soph, until the “worst was over?” Vain illusion of an
untutored mind! VVith what lightning rapidity were we
not deprived of the festive fedora of the digniﬁed derby
and introduced to that badge of servitude, “la petite
chapeau verte.” Indeed, some of us lost our hats, dignity
and pants at one fell stroke and were compelled to await
the outcome of the class rush in a costume more airy than
conventional.

And then Freshman year—when we began to get
acquainted with each other and the faculty—what a varied
memory it all is now :—Mr. Flocken’s go0d—natured efforts
to beat some economics into our heads, broken resolutions

 
 

not to copy in bookkeeping, Dr. Dyess’ history dates, a _

sudden ﬂooring remark from Dr. Thorpe and the erudite
gesticulations of Dr. Crafer are all combined with a hazy
impression of increased knowledge, the remains of dog-
eared notes, and a ﬁrm conviction that Freshman year
at Pitt is a good thing to have had as an experience. Those
of us who went into athletics and other school activities

I12

learned to know what earnest endeavor meant and per-
haps found a few of the laurel leaves of fame mixed in the
brown paper of our pipe tobacco.

And then vacation and ﬁnally the fall again when we
all assembled somehow with an increased enthusiasm for
Old Pitt and the realization that we were real Sophs and
could walk right up the front steps of Thaw Hall without
having murderous missiles or approbrious epithets hurled
at us. It was some little time, however, before we availed
ourselves of this privilege as receiving the Freshmen in a
proper and ﬁtting manner took up the ﬁrst week of school.
Some we put to work on the hump removal project and
some right on the University property, helped haul dirt
for the overworked and bristling city employees in the
grading and road making.

The history of the last two years would be a sorry
thing without mention of the faithful faculty. Dr. Holds-
worth teaching his classes when he should have been in
bed, Dr. Thorpe’s unfailing optimism that some facts will
eventually percolate through the cracks in the ivory, Mr.
Flocken’s patience and Mr. Kidd who came to us later
but not too late to ﬁnd a mighty warm place in the chest
of every Soph, are by no means overlooked or forgotten.

Nor would tl1is history be complete without the mention
of our Economics Banquet. From oysters to speeches it
was enjoyed gastronomically and intellectually so that we
carried away a renewed affection for our own school as
well as a full stomach. All hail to the Banquet Committee.

It has been a ﬁne year; we all feel the bands of college

life and common experience, friendship and good fellow-
ship drawing us closer together, more enthusiasm in the
future of Pitt and a just conﬁdence that when we ﬁnally
pass out of the events of undergraduate life we shall not
ﬁnd it altogether necessar_\' to celebrate the fame of Econ-
omics, '15 by the doubtful evidence of our own applause.

Freshmen History

.. HE PAST of 011ly the great is interesting to
' mankind. He that steps into the ﬂaring light
of Fame is held up for public inspection. Loud
hurrahs greet him. And if this one continues
not only to point out, but also to lead the way the enthus-
iasm of the public becomes conﬁdence and trust.

 

Therefore, we must consider the Freshmen of the
School of Economics. Because of interest and participa-
tion in student activities, these fellows have an unpar-
alleled record. Goodfellowship is one of their highest
aims. Sophomore contempt has changed to toleration,
and toleration has turned to respect,

There is always a beginning. The “big inning” for
the Class of 1916 happened to fall on September 30th, 1912.
On this day some of the wiser ones lost conceit as well as
dignity. A little black cap with green forepiece and but-
ton sat jauntily on many a “dome” of future brilliancy.
Some of the Freshmen began to rid the campus of obnox-
ious objects such as stones and Sophomores, while others
enjoyed excursions down the hill in a “Paddy \’Vagon.”
Then came the parade downtown. \\'hat a hit we made!

The Class Rush occurred Oct. 22nd. On account of the
large number of Freshmen, the frightened Sophs cap-

II7

tured and imprisoned many. Their most famous strong-
hold was located at 316 Atwood Street. The Freshmen
were not handcuffed. but their mode of attire was not
suitable for an afternoon's promenade. Consequently with
many Freshmen imprisoned the Sophs succeeded in win-
ning a majority of the events. Huff from our department
was the only Freshman to win an event.

In October, Carl I-lockensmith was raised from non-
entity to the high pedestal of Class President. There he
stands like Patience 011 a monument, waiting, lVlicawber—
like, for something to turn up.

The Freshman Banquet of the School of Economics,
the ﬁrst and only affair of its kind in the University, held
Friday evening, March 7th. was an opportunity for light-
ing another sk_vrocket with “Turk” Steen as master of
ceremonies. \\’hen the stick came down it hit the class
so hard that the treasury has never recovered. However,
the banquet itself, to speak in the distinctive language of
college dailies, “was a most enjoyable meeting.” It had
the honor of being neither a saturated nor even a moist
occasion. About eleven o’clock the crowd broke up,—
that is broke up a few dozen dishes.



A
In our class there are many shining stars. VVe have
“Tom” Morgan, as senator and debator; Levy, as leading
lady; Tanney, as swimmer; Blumenthal and Shapira as
manipulators of the pigskin; Huff as wrestler and debater;
“Rose” Haines as a miler; “Slim” Collingwood as a heavy-
weight; “Beauty” Conway as chorus lady; “Tuby” Moran
as champion of society; and Bieler as student. There are
thirty—ﬁve Freshmen who are doing their utmost for their
school. Because of enthusiasm and activity, we claim the
medal for ﬁrst place as real “Pittites.”

VVe have found that there is a beginning and thus
there must be an ending. The term of four years is too
short for the accomplishing of great purposes and the
making of thorough friendships; but we have pledged to
make our four years complete and remarkable for thorough-
ness. Our ﬁrst year is swiftly passing. \Vhat little 1916
has contributed towards uplifting the University has been
but the carrying out the work given to us. We must soon
leave it unﬁnished till the next year.

“The morning drum call on my eager ear

Thrills unforgotten yet; the morning dew

Lies yet undried along my paths of noon.

But now I pause at whiles in what I do

And count the bell and tremble lest I hear

(My work untrimmed) the sunset gun too soon.” G.

Junior History

‘ ENIMUS, vidinvus, vicimus, is really the history of
our illustrious class. \\'hen we decided that the
University of Pittsburgh was to be our Alma
Mater, we enrolled in the college, not because we
did 11ot wish to enter the School of Education, but
because the School of Education did not enter on its record
books, the cognomens of green buttonites and green ribbonites.
The Sophomores won in the class rush simply because it was
the custom for such to be the case and we unassuming Fresh-
men (lid not even dream of being so presumptuous as to lay
aside such a custom.

Not until we became the second stratum in the rock of
university life did we taste of the joys and sorrows of life in
the School of Education, Biology was the V\/aterloo of that
year, but we all proved to be V\’ellingtons. Then there was a
compulsory chapel for the School of Education only, and had
it not been for the very interesting lectures on such questions

 

129

as “\\'hy your conversational communications should possess a
coalescent consistency and a concatena.ted cogency without
thrasonical bombast" we never could have endured it.

Now we are Juniors worthy of all respect and due con-
sideration. It was at the beginning of this year that an art de-
partment was established in the School of Education. Proud
we are to claim as the president of our illustrious class, him
who has furnished all the cuts an(l art work in the OWL. and
truly justiﬁed are we in our pride.

The score of teachers who will go forth from this class
are already assuming a digniﬁed mien becoming to our posi-
tions. Under the guidance of Dr. Robertson, Dr. Chambers.
and Mrs. H. G. Carmalt, we are preparing for our last ascent
to the mount of Seniordom.

\\'ith the foundations which we have to build on, the
future of the class of IQI4, will be marvelous and a credit to
our well-beloved Alma Mater.

 

 

 

BEATRICE DIANA KING, Pittsburgh, Pa.
Knoxville High School. Pi Theta Nu. Y. W. C. A.

To am or not to was a Junior has been a question of great perplexity
with Beatrice. For a short time she was a Freshman with us; then she
became one of those ornamental creatures who are classed under the term
“specials”. For three whole months she played the role of “Sophomm-e",
but ﬁnally showed her good judgment in joining the ranks of the “high-
brows”. Even though some of her ways are mysterious, her “Cummins”
and-goin’s are well known.

MABEL ELIZABETH LOVE, Verona, Pa.

Verona High School. Clarion State Normal School. Pi Theta Nu.

Y. W. C. A.

Mabel is one of those creatures who never allows her studies to inter-
fere with her college education. She is a shark at mathematics, but
“Dearie, I haven’t time to do that for you, now”. Is extremely fond of
adjectives, such as “big” and “black”. To obtain the full conception of
the truth of this statement one must translate them into the German lan-
guage. Mabel is greatly opposed to rewards of merit, and is, therefore,
just good for nothing.

ELAINE MARIE OMANS, Munhall, Pa.

' Munhall High School. Y._ W. C. A.

Maiden with the meek, brown eyes. Elaine is becoming quite reckless
with her code of morals and right living, for she has been known to cut
class twice in one term. If only conscience wouldn’t interfere, lifewould
be pleasant and without a tear. She is a ﬁrm believer in the theory that
a woman may change her mind any time at all. Ask her. -She’ll explain.

ELIZABETH KENNEDY, Pittsburgh, Pa.
Pennsylvania College for Women.

The beautiful blonde with the de—e—e—p voice. And she will talk, ye
gods, how she will talk. And wl1at’s more of it, she talks almost all the
time. 0, yes! she sings when not talking. We have heard that she uses
as a model for her Cupidial missives, “Abelard and Heloise”. Elizabeth
goes to the theater as often as three times in one week. “Howe”? Yes,
that’s the answer.

The animated question mark. “Now, just what do you mean by that,
Doctor”? Margaret_ knows why the hot water pipes freeze ﬁrst. It’s be-
cause all the animallife has been killed by boiling and there is nothing in
the water to give any heat to it. ’Tis better to have bluffed and ﬂunked,
than never to have bluffed at all. A parting wish, Margaret, “may your

ISABEL JACKSON, Jefferson, Ohio.
Mary Teachers’ College. Columbia University.

The girl who speaks a dozen tongues,
When all is said and done,

Cannot compare with her who can
And does keep still in one.

A quiet, reserved lady is Isabel with a fund of humor, kindly good na-
ture and sympathy, that you never would guess unless you knew her well.
Yet all who have ever been in her classes know that she is always on time,
is faithful and conscientious and an all round good student.

JANE FRANCIS PHILLIPS, McKees Rocks, Pa.
Coraopolis High School. Y. W. C. A.

A still small voice. She seems to believe that virtue consists in actions
rather than words and in pursuance of this philosophy she goes quietly
about her daily duties. When called upon to recite she generally knows
just what to say. Jane was heard to speak two whole sentences in succes-
sion once. As yet, she is untainted and unmarred by her environment.

The watch dog of the Owl funds is a great admirer of every woman.
On the whole he is quite harmless. He decided to cast his lot with us at
the beginning of this year and so pleased is he with his progress, both
mentally and socially, that he has concluded to stay and succeed Dean
Chambers. “A question just there, Professor.” If I should promulgate
the esoteric cogitations, would my cogitative faculties be immersed in cogi-
bundity of meditations?” Lawson is so fond of argument that he won't
even eat what agrees with him.

Sophomore History

EPTEMBER 1911, the high and mighty class of
1914 viewed with much trepidation the en-
trance of the sophisticated Freshman Class.

 

Those who came were not arrayed in green,
neither would they don that "color, although locked in the
Chapel for over an hour. Putting our Freshman wits to
work we made our escape, one via the window, the other
in a more conventional manner, (by removing the hinges
of the Chapel door, using hair pins and ﬁnger nails as
screw drivers. This all—important question of supremacy
once settled it was smooth sailing for us the rest of the y¢:ar.

Such was the quality of our class that September,
I912, found the ranks unbroken (we needed no weeding

out”) with the valuable addition not only of a girl from the

135

College and one from \\*'estern Reserve, l)ut to this purely
feminine organization came an “ash” from Westminster.
which added some more grit to our bunch although we
were pretty well supplied heretofore.

Having learned our lesson from Experience, we were
able_to cope successfully with the annual Disturbance en-
tering last fall. They not only gladly wore the green but
appeared for two days with their hair obeying the law of
gravity, though it was not regarded with gravity by the
fellows.

So now in preparing for the Junior year, having sur-
mounted all obstacles, we fore—ha11dedly are beginning to
save our pennies for the 1914 OWL, for we will not have
our fair name blotted by monetary obligations.

Freshmen History

  
   
 

 

HE Class of 1916 made its entrance to the ven-
erable halls of Pitt as quietly as the proverbial
March.

will emulate that of March, but we do surmise

  





that it will be a little more triumphant than its entry.
VVe shall never forget those first memorable days

V/Ve are not predicting that the exit

when Freshies found force only in numbers, and Sophs
strutted about us in the pride of their newly-acquired sta-
tion; when we valiantly refused to wear the Freshman
color on our ﬂowing locks and smooth pate, respectively
—not, of course, for any aversion to green, nor for said
f. l. & s. p. (see above); but for the mere reason that we
objected to green cheese—cloth and microscopic hats. And
that memorable day when we pantingly and wheezingly,
hampered by the results of the smallpox epidemic, as-
cended the hill and saw the Freshmen win the class rush.
(Far be‘it from us to make any statement as to who won;
sufﬁce it to say it was awarded to the Sophs.) After the
dust of conflict had somewhat settled, we proceeded to
elect a worthy president and a ﬁtting cabinet and to con-

I38

duct ourselves rationally as beﬁtted college students
(Here we might say in passing, that we ignore the episode
of the ﬂaming numerals against the hillside.) VVe frolicked
at Phantom parties, socials an(l teas and we “crept, climbed
and intruded” into quite a few College Functions. Follow-
ing the “Pittean” weakness for hills we co—eds dragged
ourselves up to Stanton Heights, there to dance till we
were too tired to do anything but roll down. (No refer-

ence to rolling in taxies.)

VVe observed, with dignity becoming our state, the
boorishness of our former classmates of faroff Prep days
at the High School receptions, and did our best to ensnare

Chapter I

1. It came to pass, in the days of old, that Tom
the Pharoah, Son of Arbuthnot, gathered unto him a great
number of men wise in the mighty art of healing.

2. And from many lands he chose as councillors,
O’Klotz, the man from the Northlands, great in the mys-
teries of pathology, an(l Holman, and Haythorne, and
MacLachlan, his henchmen;

3. And Heard the Humorite, and Lichty the Stoma-
tite, and VVhite the Lungite, and Johnston the Typhite;

4. And Sheldon the Hittite, and Guthrie the Stew-
artite, strong in his knowledge of physiology; and Buch-
anan the Cuttite;

5. And Ziegler the Obstetrite, and VVerder ‘the
Gynecite, and Edwards and Cohoe and Blair;

6. And Diller the Neurite, and many others, all un-
equalled in all the sciences known to mankind; these were
Iiiscouncillors.

7. Now all the wise men talked together one with
the other, and came with Tom the Pharoah to the City
of Smoke in the land of \Nillpenn against the banks of
the Ohio.

History

151

8. And when Tom the Pharoah and his wise men
came to the City of Smoke they took council among them-
selves.

9. And it came to pass that they, in their discus-
sions, said that they would impart unto the young men of
the" land their learning in the healing arts.

10. So they l)uilded them a house and called it
“School of Medicine,” and said house was in the wilds of
Brereton Avenue over against Herron Hill.

II. Many were the young men who came to sit at
the feet of these great and learned men, until lo, the house
which they had builded them would no longer hold the
young men, so many and studious were they, seekers after
knowledge.

12.
of Arbuthnot, again called together his wise men,

13. And they must needs build for them a new build-
ing, on the top of a high and mighty mountain.

14. Yes, on a Very high mountain, that they might
have peace and quiet.

15. And Tom the Pharoah, son of Arbuthnot, looked
upon his temple on the high mountain, and upon his wise
and learned councillors, and saw that it was good.

So it came to )ass that Tom the Pharoah son
1 :

Chapter II

1. S0 Tom the Pharoah bade his servants to send
forth to all the lands, yea, even to all the corners of the
earth;

2. And bring to him young men wise and of good
stature, good to look upon, and learned for their years
and age.

3. So to the City of Smoke, to Tom the Pharoah,
returned they them. And with them came the young men,
goodly to look upon, and learned for their age and years,
the illustrious class of 1914.

4. And there was in this gathering together of the .

young men Edbraun, and Dboggs, and Bruce, known as
Paul; and Cohen, the VVhistler;

5. And Buck, and Andycance the Singer, and Col-
well the Tink;

6. And Cubby the Benedict, and Samﬁnegold and
Fredette, and Garman from Garman’s Mills, and Bilgoeh—
ring the Fleet;

7. And Safety Gillette, and Joegold the Unique, and
Julius the Cackle;

8. And Hanlon the Arguﬁer, and Tomharter the
Pres, and Spotharris the Quiet, and Ralph the Touch;

9. And Hemphill, and Hood, he of the long locks;
and Bobhibbs, and Kalet the Duke;

10. And Kelly, yea, even he the married one; and
Kreuger from the land of Nod; and Monklong, and he of

152

riot fame; and Nevergold the Cavedweller; and Yakmorks
the Mexican; and Noah the Ancient Mariner;

II. And Bilmarkell the Committeeman, and Mervis
a man wise in drugs;

12. And McAnulty the quiet, and McCormick, and
Sheeprnager the ﬁghter;

13. And Page the Roughhouser, and Patterson the
speedy;

14. And Redreed the Sparkle, and Juniergot, he of
the golden curls, and Perrysinith, and Booksmith;

15. And Teplitz the brother of Goliath, and Treshler;

16. And Hubrwag the athlete, and Wechsler, and
Yeggwolff from Dutchtown; and a few others who have
since departed for other ﬁelds.

Chapter III

1. Now, Tom the Pharoah was exceedingly well
pleased when he looked upon them, and spake he kindly
to them.

2. So the young men entered the portals of the
mighty temple of Aescalapius, and began to cast about for
things to do and wonders to see.

3. And they learned the yrending apart of things
to see what was therein, and mighty was their preceptor
thereof, he of the white hair from the Northlands.

4. And Koch, the quiet and skillful, showed unto
them the mysteries of Chemistry, and great was their en-
joyment in his house.

5. For he was a strong man and wise, and would
not go to the young men and they came unto him.

6. And Sheldon the Hittite wrought mightily with
the young men, and labored valiently with them.

7. So it came to pass that some of the young men
counselled together and spake in this wise:

8. “VVe are compassed round about by our enemies;
yea, they are on every side of us; let us therefore retreat
before it be too late, and Sheldon the Hittite descend upon
us in his wrath.”

9. And some took up their burdens and left.

10. But Sheldon the Hittite was a man persistent in
all things, and he labored still more valiently, yea, even
so that more of the young men traveled hence.

' II. The other young men looked on in awe and
wonder, but were not to be turned aside in this fashion.

And Sheldon desisted for a time,

12. And it came to be said that the young men were
wise, even though they did raisell, and desert the temple
of Aescalapius and hie them to the Temple of Terpsichore,
and Venuses, and Bacchus, on lo these many days.

13. Now when all these things were done the young
men departed for their homes to return when the summer
was gone.

Chapter IV

1. Now when the summer was passed Tom the
Pharoah, again summoned the young men to him.

153

2. And when they were in the height of their joy
Sheldon the Hittite came upon them suddenly, and great
was the gloom caused thereby; for,

3. Sheldon was not lightly to be passed over, but
a man to be reckoned with. And he ﬁnished his work of
the year before, but the young men were wise, and but
few foolish.

4. So Sheldon was repulsed with a pile of fourteen
dead before him.

5. And after Sheldon the Hittite had been blessed
by the young men, Guthrie the Shuite, the man great
in physiology, took them in hand,

6. So that there was wailing a11d gnashing of teeth,
yea, great was the groaning thereof.

7. And the young men were greatly put to it to
ﬁnd new and varied uses for frogs and other vermin,

8. But Guthrie the Shuite, and Andyeyan, and
Docbrooks, his fellows, pursued the young men until they
were wearied nigh unto death;

9. And came to reason among themselves and
spoke thusly:

10. “Does medicine consist then of frogs and smoked
drums? Wherewith have we came from far and near to
be thus treated. Vi/hat will the people say when they are
sorely stricken and we comfort them with froglegs and
tracings?;

II. But they were prevailed upon to keep 011 in their
pursuit of knowledge, which was likened unto a stern

 

chase, with \\’isdom before them and the faculty behind.

12. And while the young men were deep in the
studies of the mysteries of physiology there came upon
them O’Klotz, and they were called upon to see small bugs
and other things called, “bacteria.”

13. And through the telescopes of O’Klotz the young
men gazed at many wondrous mikerobes, and they were
not afraid.

I4. Yea he showed them the streps and the staphs
and the typhies, and anthrax, even those after which
Sheepnager was named;

15. And the tbs, and some Neisser than those, so the
young men laid by a great store of knowledge thereby.

16. And their liking for O’Klotz increased, and his
praises were loud in the lan(l.

17. But many of the young men delighted in the
pleasures of Mailpouch, upon which O’Klotz frowned,
so they were downcast, and Redreld and Cubby and many
others were hard put to it.

18. And when the end of the year was at hand, the
young men appeared before the wise men, and shewed
unto them their knowledge, or their lack of it.

19. So that while many were called, few were chosen,
and some departed for their ow11 dugouts to return no
more. V

20. Now it came to pass after two years that the
young men departed, and went to their homes far and
near.

154

21. And spent the summer in such manner as to
cast from their minds all remembrance of what had gone
before.

Chapter V.

I. And Tom the Pharoah again sent for the young
men and they heeded his call to sit at the feet of the wise
men.

2. So they came back one and all, and these are
some of the things they heard and did:

3. Buck the Cuttite, taking up the work where
had ﬁnished Sheldon the Hittite, exhorted, entreated, and
instructed the young men in the ways of surgery;

4. Amid a scenery of white tables, and a back-
ground of fair nurses, and he was aided and abetted by
Davis, and Grifﬁth, and Donaldson the fast talker, and
Dixon the well-liked, and Stewart the fast worker, and
Hays, and many others.

5. So when in the month of December, the young
men came before Buck he did gird up his loins and smite
them hip and thigh.

6. Yea, and great was the smite thereof,

7. For Buck the Cuttite did pounce upon nearly all
of the young men, and they fell before him in his wrath.

8. And these young men, goodly to look upon, and

learned for their age and years, did rend ‘their clothes, t

ha-1»7*~ ». M .

and put them on sackcloth and ashes, and mourning pre-
vailed in the temple builded by Tom the Pharoah.

9. But yet other sore trials and tribulations awaited
the young men.

10. For they were soon summoned before the others
of the mighty counsellors to show forth their knowledge.

II. And O’Klot7. the man from the Northlands, and

Heard the Humorite, and Lichty the Stomatite, White the

Lungite, and Johnston the Typhite,

12. And Ziegler, the Obstetrite, W/’erder the Gyne- I

cite, Blair, Edwards, and many others did sorely try the
young men;

13. And after many days these wise and mighty
councillors did hand forth to the young man certain 1nark—
ings which they term grades, and again great sorrow
came upon them.

14. And now after many reasonings together the
young men decided to again pursue the dictates of Tom
the Pharoah and his counsellors summoned from afar.

15. So they did journey to the top of the high and
mighty mountain, even to the temple erected by Tom the
Pharoah.

16. And to the Mercy, and to the large and mighty
stronghold builded in the memory of St. Francis.

155

17. And here they did again thump chests with re-
newed vigor; yea, did they even lay hold of heads and
arms and many other parts, of which the possessors there-
of wailed bitterly.

18. So Frost and Billings, Miller and Donaldson,
Robinson, Sieber and others of those councillors did loudly
praise the young men for their learning.

19. And so the young men continued to appear be-
fore the wise men at the rising of the sun, and sit at their
feet until the going down thereof, taking of their knowl-
edge.

2o. And great fellowship prevails among them; yea
even many tried and true friendships exist, and great hap-
piness is seen when the young men are together;

21. Yea, may there ever be joy when ’tis said, “Let
us go up to the Temple of Aescalapius, even that founded
by Tom the Pharoah, son of Arbuthnot, and his mighty
councillors, the Alma Mater of the illustrious class of
Nineteen Fourteen.”

PAUL COOPER BRUCE. <I>P2. Erie. Pa.
Erie High School.

Paul is our sole representative from the Great Lakes. So very quiet
and unobtrusive that we seldom have the pleasure of hearing him express
his opinions except in quiz. He occasionally indulges in a quiet little argu-
ment with Cubby, and a Chinese Laundry attendant in Oakland, but never
when a gang is around to hear it. His attainments as a student, his noise-
less personality and good humor have stamped him an all around ﬁne fel-
low and we like him.

DAVID ALEXANDER BOGGS, Pittsburgh, Pa.
Pittsburgh High School.

It is vaguely rumored that he presents striking anomalies of excess,-
causative agent unknown. A renowned athletepwhose mighty prowess has
frequently caused many of the aspiring amateur teams to again get a repu-
tation. He admits he is also a boxer and wrestler of no mean fame.
“Scurvy” stands on his own ability, the courage of his connections being
frequently seen cropping out of his arguments. The spirit he displays is
always that of good will, and feeling toward him is one of respect and
appreciation.

EDWARD J. BRAUN, CIJAZ, Pittsburgh, Pa.
Pittsburgh High School. President of OWL Board.

An easy going individual with a sparkling sense of humor, and is very
popular among his friends. His favorite expression is, “How do you
mean ?” His main occupation is studying when he has nothing else to do:
when he has studying to do he goes to the Monteﬁore or the show. Eddie
still talks of a trip to New York taken some time ago and everything now
is compared to the big burg. Appreciation for his keen abilities was ex-
pressed by electing him to the presiding of the OWL Board and ably and
well has he fulﬁlled his many duties.

CLARENCE JOHN BUCK, AKK, Edgewood Park, Pa.
Edgewood Park High School.

“Buck” was an addition who came to us rather late, but has been here
strong ever since. His rosy cheeks are always in evidence, although he
himself remains in the background to watch the others. When it comes
down to fussing the women, dancing, etc., “Buck” forges to the front in
grand style. He also likes to romance a little during noon hour. He tells
us stories in admirable style and produces some good sound logic, which
always makes him very acceptable, and his presence very much enjoyed.

ALEXANDER HUNTER COLWELL, (DPS, Pittsburgh, Pa.
Pittsburgh Academy.

When it comes down to starting a fuss old “Alex” the Great had noth-
ing on our own classmate, otherwise known as “Fink”. During his ﬁrst
year or so in school he was, to say the least, peaceable; but now if he can
not get in a physical riot, he crosses words mentally with some one.

We recognized his remarkable mental abilities before he became an
honor student; a ﬁrm true friend of every one in the class, we'know all
about him and like him just the same.

ANDREW ROXEY CANCELLIERE, NEN, Pittsburgh, Pa.
Theta Nu Epsilon. Pittsburgh High School. Junior Prom. Com«

mittee. Glee Club, (I), (2), (3).

Cance belongs to the Uniques. He insists on prolonged and interest-
ing (?) discussions with the profs after lectures and quiz. When remon-
strated with, becomes rather peeved. Leader of the gang which holds
forth in the smoking room, emitting noises, simulating a feline courtship
on a back fence. ’

Andy is one of our best entertainers and spare moments never drag
heavily when he is with us. He has been one of the mainstays of the Glee
Club since he has been in school, and we wish him success in his chosen
profession.

MORRIS AARON COHEN, Pittsburgh, Pa.
Pittsburgh High School.

His near whistling has driven many of us to despair and as a result
of this terrible whistling Cohen would have been in a cemetery or we
would be in an insane asylum if it were not for the strong will power
constantly exerted by the class. Morris very seldom cusses, but when he
does. he uses some very choice expressions: “Goll Durn” and “G011 Ding”
are his favorite words of strength to fall back on when angry. He always
manages to occupy a seat in the front row accompanied by “Teppie”, and
aside from his whistlings is a pretty good fellow.

CARL JACKSON CUBBISON, (DBH, MS, Freedonia, Pa.
Hamonsburg High School. Freedonia Institute.

“Cubby” is one of the “Old Guard”. He sweats profusely the coldest
day in winter, although never known to hurry. The etiology of this con-
dition is unknown, but those purple socks and other things have often been
suggested. Has tried to be a father to “Red” Reed, Hibbs, and “Paddy”
Gillette for three years as he had to have some one to be a father to and
this trio was thrust upon him. A steadfast, honest, sincere gentleman who
is always up among the leaders.

Estate. Sam is a good student and has the happy faculty of minding his
own business, He has been going around lately with a very much worried
expression which cannot be accounted for except that possibly he intends
to get. married or other like calamity.

JOHN WASHINGTON FREDETTE, NZN, Wilkinsburg, Pa.
Wilkinsburg High School. Class Vice President.

Johnny is now a hard working interne and claims he hasn’t had any
sleep for a month or more. Maybe so, but he still has those pink cheeks
and immaculate clothes, though he does need a shave oftener than he used
to. John stands by quietly and listens to all the expert opinions handed
out free. and then last of all gives his own. which is generally pretty good
dope. We respect these opinions of John’s, as we do John himself, and we
all }know him as :1 big hearted friend who'will share with you anything
he as.

HARRY FRANKLlN GARMAN, (DBH, Garman's Mills, Pa.

Pittsburgh Academy.

He forsook the quiet and reposeful life of Cambria County, came
down and joined us, where his modest ways soon won for him a warm
place in the hearts of his classmates. True, he occasionally indulges in
mortal combat with Ross Kelley, and shadows McAnulty continuously, but
we can overlook that. He is a quiet, smooth, easy—going fellow, who is
always there or thereahouts at the end of the year.

NINDE TROY GILLETTE, (IJBH, Corry, Pa.
Slippery Rock Normal.

Known as “Paddy", because we hesitate when approaching that speci-
ﬁc generic distinction which he says signiﬁes something nice. Plays end
man for “Cubby” in the famous Kentucky story and has promised to take
a week off to explain a couple of Reg Kreuzerfs “jokes". He heats up
George Harris with the gloves occasionally and spends the remainder of
his time in arguments and writing letters. We all like “Paddy" and glory
in his successes which are many and varied, for he is recognized as one
of the best men in the class.

 

 

WILLIAM NEEB GOEHRING, (DPS, Pittsburgh, Pa.
Westminster College.

“Bill” makes a specialty of undertakers’ expressions and refuses to be
aroused from his state of coma except on examinations when he always
comes through with colors ﬂying. He had a hard time in Physiology Lal)—
oratory, because of being handicapped by Joe Gold; and many and varied
were the means he used. endeavoring to stimulate Joe to action, but all to
no avail. ‘‘Bill'’ is a hard working, conscientious student. who sticks strict—~
ly to his own affairs which gives him great prestige with his classmates.

JOSEPH BRAND GOLD, (DBH, N. S., Pittsburgh, Pa.

Allegheny Preparatory School. Princeton. Class Senator.

Besides being one of our class comedians, Joe has had the honor of
being our class president for the first two years and is at present senator.
He is frequently embarrassed by being asked where he lost the “stein” off
his handle, but never the least bit fussed when asked where he is going to-
night. That same reply is always forthcoming. We forget her name. An
amicable, jovial. good fellow, who can always furnish fun. May the best
of everything that is good be yours, both now and later, Joe.

159

JULIUS CAESAR GORFINKEL, (THE, N. S., Pittsburgh, Pa.
Allegheny High School. . .
The baby of the Junior Class and worry is his middle name, running

a close second to the above Caesar business. “When do we have exams?”
and “When do we eat?” are his favorite queries. He is also endowed with
a peculiar laugh, otherwise known as a “cackle”, which has placed the class
in a state of mania on many occasions. Is addicted to green hats and teddy
bear hair cuts,‘ which, combined with that “cackle" manages to. keep him
in the public eye.

TORRANCE JOHN HANLON, NEN, Monongahela City, Pa.
Monongahela High School. W. U. P.

Jack is a member of the Mexican Athletes and comes from the wilds
of the Monongahela Valley, where they make good rye. He admits he is
a star at duckpins and pool—we don’t. Jack is at all times to be found
at the beginning, during, and at the end of every lecture telling the profs
about science as she is, or ought to be, and while we’ve known him, has
been never heard to acknowledge defeat, which is, sadly, not infrequent.
Be that as it may, we all admire Jack for his earnestness, his conscientious
attention to his duty, and his excellent good nature.

 

 

CHARLES LESTER REED, (DBH, Bellaire, O.
Bellaire High School. Class Secretary.

Better known as “Red” Reed. Comes from down the Ohio Valley
but we can overlook that. He is absolute proof that red eilia is no owner
of an ill temper. “Sparkles” favorite prescription is :—R Essence of
Mail Pouch z jss M Sig: Take one handful now or less as needed.
Proﬁt by Red’s experience and never take this drug before entering public

' places unless you have an impermeable bandana. Sparkle is surrounded

by an atmosphere of good cheer, and where Red is, there is a good time.
He is very popular with all the fellows.

GEORGE RANDOLPH HARRIS, JR., NEN, Pittsburgh, Pa.
Pittsburgh High School. Chairman Student Senate.

George, or the “so-called Spot”, is first and above all a member of
“The Committee”. He has gained undying fame as a “simultaneous lec-
turer”, and his classical expressions,—“Dry up”, and “seat, you rat”, are
always with us. He has a gait which is comparable to a funeral march
until some one says,—“Let’s go burn one”. George is the best note writer
in the class, and his notebook is a thing of beauty and a joy forever. He
is a little sarcastic at times, but withal is jovial, witty, and an all around
good fellow.

160

RALPH HAMILTON HARRISON, (DPE, Pittsburgh, Pa.

Pittsburgh High School.

Alias “Touch”. Is abbreviated in stature, but has more wit and humor
per square inch of his surface than the greatest fun artist in the business.
He also has a very spare growth of ﬂagellae on his dome, which gives it
the appearance of a billiard ball when seen from a bird’s eye view. He
and Dave Boggs stick together as though they owed each other money;
and when hunting, Dave uses him to scare up the “birds”. One of the
most popular men in the class and we wish him the best of everything
goo .

DAVID EARL HEMPHILL. Tarentum. Pa.
Allegheny High School.

Hemp has been out of school a couple of years. and came back to join
a good class. Likes to get some one in a corner and romance about Bill
Lange. the old amphitheatre. and the other incidents of Brereton Avenue.
Them was the happy days. Many and varied are the stories he also brings
to us from up the valley. where there are more and prettier girls to the
square inch than anywhere on earth. He is a quiet unassuming chap, and
we would proﬁt by a few more additions like old Hemp.

ROBERT CHARLES HIBBS. (IJBW. Miff1in_ Pa.
Milflin High School. Franklin and Marshall Academy.

Bob is one of our youngest men. comes from down East. hence the
favorite song. “The Blue Juniata”. He is very strong in his own _opinions,
especially when he is wrong, which he generally is. He is a hard worker
outside of school, but he won't tell what nights he works. This gives him
a good excuse to call on all the unengaged females in the Allegheny Val-
ley District. Bob is quiet and rather retiring, and improves greatly with
acquaintance.

ROBERT THURLOAW HOOD, (DPS, Pittsburgh, Pa.
Westminster College, ’o9.

“Doc” and “Alex” Colwell at one time had a peculiar interest in calo-
rimeters, but their enthusiasm suddenly disappeared. Many theories have
been handed out, why he does not get his hair cut, but the general opin-
ion is that it is just a peculiarity of one great scientist to distinguish him-
self from the others. He is one of the most genial and even tempered men
of the class and never too busy to lend his interest or aid to any who may
desire it. We wish you a quick and sure road to greatness, Thurlow.

I61

HARRY JULIUS KALET, Pittsburgh, Pa.
Pittsburgh High School.

Surnamed “The Duke". He deserves great credit for the cilia labiae
superious,——not for its artistic beauty, but because he had nerve enough to
exhibit one of, its kind. Intends to be a great Pathologist and ever more
sit in a laboratory and draw pictures. He haunted the ofﬁce for exam
marks until the “powers that be” threatened to hang him. His amusing
stories told as only he can tell them. have caused many laughs and his only
regret is that he cannot induce the class to cut every day. Best wishes and
great success. Harry.

ROSS ANDREW KELLEY, Slippery Rock, Pa.
Slippery Rock Normal.

His noble stride savors of plowed ground, rail fences, and the like,
but a good fellow nevertheless. He is rapidly gaining a reputation as a
neurologist and a rough house agent. Noted for the original jokes he
pulls off on the faculty. Ross is an earnest worker, who never cuts classes
to go fussing the women, for he is now under subjection to a female of
the species; a believer in woman’s rights; and one of the best natured and
most affable men in the class.

 

 

 

ROBERT REGINALD KRUEGER. (DX, Pittsburgh, Pa.
Pittsburgh High School.

A true descendant of Oom Paul and responds best to the name of
“Reggie". Is said to be some “fusser", but we see enough of him to dis-
claim the rumor. Some person said they saw him at a ﬁrst hour lecture
one morning, but this was never taken seriously. Reg has a propensity for
telling stories and distributing pills. He also took a course in Comparative
Anatomy up at Walker's Soap Works last summer. Quiet and unassum-
ing. he attends strictly to his own affairs which gets him the good will of
every one.

HERBERT MILTON LONG, NZN, Pittsburgh, Pa.
Pittsburgh High School. Medical Editor of OWL.

Chief Member and Chairman of “The Committee". “Monk” is Long
on arguments and will enter one at any time whether he knows the sul)—
ject under discussion or not. In fact, he makes a better showing in the lat-
ter class. He has a ﬁne voice which is chieﬂy characterized by its loud-
ness. Occasionally some one else can be heard when he is at school. He
also has a weakness for parading Fifth Avenue at noon with—well, some
one. We cannot say Herbert is the best looking man in the class, or the
best student, but when you want to ﬁnd the best all around man in the
class, look for “Monk". They don’t make any better than he, and there is
only one of him.

162

JOSEPH ELMER MAGEE, CDX, Carnegie, Pa.
Carnegie High School.

Maggie is regarded as a stunner and is very fair to look upon. His
assumed name which he loves (learly is “Sheep". Mac told us a thrilling
tale in his Freshman year, completely surpassed all previous attempts and
never tried it again. He aspires to the sash weight championship of the
class, but at present is having some trouble with the other “hopes". He
is a very busy lady now, that he is learning some of the latest dances. in
fact, he has been seen almost tied in a knot. Also preparing a treatise on
feline anaesthesia. An easy—going big—hearted fellow, whom we all like.

CHARLES HOWARD MARCY, (DFA, NEN, Cambridge Springs, Pa.

Cambridge Springs High School. Allegheny College.

A member of “the Uniques", and one of Dr. Klotz’s Bug Hunters.
Spent all of last summer chasing small animals. microbes, etc., up Fifth
Avenue and down Wood Street, in trying to shed more light on the smoke
problem. “Spike" was one of our honor pupils for the ﬁrst two years, and
if the ladies don’t get him, like history, will repeat A quiet reserved young
man who studies hard, a critic of fair faces, and a good friend.

 

THOMAS HUDSON HARTER, (DX, Washington, Pa.
Washington High School. President of Class.

Our most honorable “Pres.” One of the best examples of that mod-
ern political invention, “The Steam Roller”. When all “dolled” up with
his hair plastered down, he is affectionately known as “The Rat”. Hails
from “Little George”, but outside of that, he is entirely normal. Has a
peculiar diathesis for school teachers and a stock laugh which really has
quite a catchy air. His amazing stories told in his own peculiar style, to-
gether with his exceptional abilities as a master, when in “the chair”, have
won him a warm spot in the hearts of us all.

HARRL GARDNER NOAH, (1)132, Burgettstown, Pa.
Franklin College, ’o8.

The “Ancient Mariner” is one of the old standbys of our class. It
has been truly said that he needs to be hammered together somewhat but
we think the elongation was entirely Physiological. He could persuade
more people that they really were sick than he could ever cure by Thera—
peutics. He has a capacity for work equalling two ordinary men and a
great store of dry wit and humor which never grows old. A gentleman,
a scholar, and a good judge of women, he stands as a leader among us.

Medical Business Manager of OWL.

163

JOHN WESLEY PAGE, 2 AE, <pBn, Sewickley, Pa.

Cincinnati High School. Ohio Wesleyan.

“Leaflet" decided that our class was better suited to his peculiar
temperament than any he had before been a member of, so he applied for
admission. He quickly showed that he could kick up more disturbance
in less time than was expected of one of his size, and this soon gave him
access to the inner circle. Every one seems to glory in his technique of
carrying out these ructious and we believe he is now in his proper element.
Strong physically, and we are just as strong for him.

FRANK BORTZ PATTERSON, (DX, Swissvale, Pa.
North Braddock High School.

“Pat” is going at a terrible pace lately and it certainly is a shame he
went wrong. He also is quite good at spinning yarns. Grabbed a life
preserver when the ship seemed to be sinking for the last time and reached
shore in spite of the hot pursuit of the captain. He easily outdistanced
the other fugitives who sank but have the habit of turning up regularly.
“Pat" is one of our cool, quiet, easy—going individuals, always the same
good fellow whenever you meet him, with a temper which we never see

 

BERNARD JOHN MCCORMICK, (PX, Carnegie, Pa.
Carnegie High School.

Mac persists in wearing his hair in the straight-up fashion after hav-
ing been told about it on numerous occasions, which proves him to be
very obstinate. He is a wonder i11 baseball, football, with the ladies,
dancing, and other Medical pursuits. His chief occupation seems to be
guardian for Magee. True he becomes rather radical at times but 11ot
near enough to detract any from the excellent feeling existing between
he an(l our class.

JAMES A. SCHURGOT, XZX, Wihnerding, Pa.
East Liberty Academy. Westminster College. George Washing-
ton University.

Jimmie hails from \7Vi1merding but in view of his other sterling qual-
ities we cannot hold that against him. He came to us a stra11ger last
year and the class was quick to appreciate his varied abilities so he made
good with a vengeance. Ergot has one failing, that of going into a trance
in front of jewelry store windows and newspaper bulletins, his friends
often requiring the assistance of the police force to remove him. Jimmy
is an artist of note and also a great whistler, his only rivals being a few
rare song birds. He has decided ability i_11 making and keeping friends,
is a good student and a good fellow at all times.

164

FRANK EDWIN SMITH, (PX, Palmyra, 0.
Sharon High School, '

-K11ow11 to the elite as “Boob.” He admits his worst habit is an alto-
gether too stout love for “skirts.” That trance effect, or sort of coma, is
seen only in the class room for when outside he undergoes a complete
reversal of form. This was proven by his being discovered sitting on a
park bench in a secluded corner of Schenley Park the coldest day this
winter with an “object of adiniration." But there may be reason in her
madness. “Boob" is a gentleman, a scholar, and a good judge of “Mis-
souri Meershams.”

PERRY CLARE SMITH, (DBII, New Brighton, Pa.
New Brighton High School.

Perry is one of our real quiet men who never indulges i11 rough
house or loud arguments of any kind. He is generally contented when
ﬁlling the capacity of an on—looker; is usually on hand when any doings
are in progress and sticks to the linish. His appreciation is shown by
that silent mirth and laughter which is so often evident. His prolonged
illness plainly demonstrated how much we enjoyed his being with us and
were doubly thankful to be again graced _by his presence.

i;av.-am..~;,a.._ ,

 

WILLIAM ODY MARKELL, NEN, Monongahela City, Pa.
Monongahela High School. W. U. P.

Another member of “The Committee”, “Hematoxylin Crew”, and other
oﬂicial bodies. He hails from a small burg up the river which should keep
him quiet, but doesn’t affect our Willie in the least. Arguments are B1ll’s
long suit, and profs and students all look alike to him. He always -corrects
(for his friends) the statements of lectures to his own satisfaction, at least.

We endure his arguments, for we appreciate his sterling worth, his
faithfulness, and his loyalty to his friends.

JACOB KEENE MARKS, (PAS, Pittsburgh, Pa.
Munhall High School.

According to “Jake” ,one Teplitz is the smallest man in the class, but
we know better. A favorite song of his is, “Where the River Shannon
Flows”, and his greatest enemy is the word study. He studies when “The
Duke” studies which is all the time. He is our future orthopaedic sur-
geon. Doc Yak is a lecturer par excellence to nurses on surgery, and he
bashfully acknowledges he is a great man. It is the earnest wish of the
class that if he is not he will be in the near future.

165

FRANK HENRY MERVIS, Braddock, Pa.
Pitt Pharmacy School, ’09. Class Treasurer.

Mervis, our white hope, is a jolly good natured chap who supplies
tobacco to most of the class. He was really quite peeved on one occasion
when we asked him in a chorus of voices, “Who hit Teacher?” Remem-
bcr the answer, Frank? Is a hard working student and no doubt will be
a great success in later life. The longer he is with us the better we like
him and all wish him every recognition in his chosen profession.

ARTHUR HALE, MCANULTY, (DBH, Pittsburgh, Pa.
Pittsburgh Academy.

Mac was a school teacher -at one time. He got tired walloping the
kids so he came down here to enlighten the class, but he has largely
conﬁned his efforts to arguing with Alec Colwell. These are the good
old “straight laced” arguments based on personal convictions. He is a
good student, earnest and faithful to his duty; has his own peculiar
method of telling stories, and is a gentleman thoroughly liked by his
fellows.

 

 

MAX TEPLITZ, Pittsburgh, Pa.
Pittsburgh High School.

This chap, commonly known as “Tep,” is small in stature but fulﬁlls
that old adage that “the smaller they are the better they may have been”
or something to that effect. He is known to study a great deal but is
rewarded by always being there, or thereabouts. Tep is one of the best
fellows in the class, indulges in some rough house occasionally, which is
altogether out of proportion to his size, and is liked by all of us.

HARRY JOSEPH TRESCHLER, Uniontown, Pa.
St. Vincents’ College.

“Tresch” is one of the species which is prone to inhabit medical
schools,—the studious student. Is known to his fellow scientists as
“Father Ignutz.” It has been predicted that he will soon be billed as the
star speaker for the “Morals Eﬂiciency Commission.” A quiet, hard-work-
ing student. highly esteemed by his fellows.

JOHN HUBER WAGNER, NEN, Monaca, Pa.
Monaca High School. Geneva College.
’II, ’I2. Captain Elect, ’Varsity Football, ’I3.
Commonly called “King of the Uniques.” His worst offense is a daily
attempt to address the’ class by mouth, waving of hands, etc., only to be
unceremoniously drowned out by the bunch before making any headway.

’Varsity Football ’To,

166

Hube received a love letter one day (probably from a blind girl) and he
has been reading it in the classroom every day since. This stunt, com-
bined with his excellent» imitations of the faculty, makes him a great
entertainer.

LAWRENCE WECHSLER, (DA2, Pittsburgh, Pa.
Pittsburgh High School,

Wechs is a physician in the true sense of the word. He is a boy.
who by circumstance chose his profession many years ago, and has been
in training ever since. He is a silent observer, a generous listener, gentle
in manner, and all the ear marks of a servant of the sick. A youthful
face has he, but a noble brow.

RAY ALVIN WOLFF, (DX, N. S., Pittsburgh, Pa.
Allegheny High School.

Yegg is the last but not least member of “The Committee,” and one of
its ex-chairman. The German’s thoughts are somewhat extra—mural at
times, and he was necked for the same one afternoon. One day way back
in the Freshman year he came to a first lecture, but the strain was too
much for him, and now he arrives some time later. Ray is some dancer,
and can be found any time talking about past, present, and future hog-
wrestles over in Dutchtown.

A Chant for Unwreatlied Victory

 

0 Thou, who tread’st, with valiant feet,
The rugged‘ road of hostile years,
Whose lot hath been the glean-ed ears
Snatched from a world of garnered wheat,
O hungered tender of the vine
Wright of unguerdoned husbandry,
0 thirst-irked treaderout of wine
Red crushed for others’ revelry,
Wreathed in new song, I bring to Thee
The love of those whose hearts are thine.

Upon thy hip the sword of might,
In thy firm hand the torch of truth,
Thy cheeks flushed with eternal youth

Thy sapphire eyes thought-starred with light;

Strong limbed and goddess molded, free,
Aureant armored, laurel crowned,

And ’neath thy fountain hrests close bound
With cinctures of self mastery

Hear thou the song we sing for Thee
In whose fair strength our hope is found.

0 Thou, who from reluctant dust
-Mingled with labor’s sweat and tears, —
Strong in a faith that knows no fears,-
’Ga1nst scourge of flame and jealous thrust
Hast reared Thy pillared citadel;
O keeper of the sacred fire,

O warder of Pirene’s well
0 pioneer of hearts’ desire,
On in they triumph mounting higher
To thunderous songs no storm can quell.

Thy faith mocks our inconstancy,
Thy lavish palms, our avarice,
Thou giv’st beyond great rubies’ price,
A niggard alms we grudge to Thee;
We buy world-laughter and reproach
In love of show and civic gaud,
For alien brows Thy cruse we broach,
Thy wealth we squander far abroad;

- Alma Mater

A Chant for Unwreathed Victory

 

How long shall scorn and churlish pence
Be bartered for thine opulence?

God help thy loyal sons to plead

Thy righteous cause till men shall rise
To aid Thee in thy high emprise

And guard thee in thine hour of need;
God rear thy temples on the height,

Loosen thy burdens, set them free.
God give thee champions to fight

The winning fight for truth and thee.
God give thee faith to keep aright

Thine upward path of destiny. _B_,O9

dental class of 1914 assembled and organized.
Even Harry, District Janitor and crap extin-
guisher, was impressed and confessed his esteem
 by purchasing a bright new shovel and a pair of
brﬁs knucklers;

\: Took only one short year to prove to the world and the

Beard of Directors that this class comprised such a quality of ‘
. gP§itlS, virtue and nobility, as to deserve special consideration,

g-:-.;_fshed with an improved habitation. ‘

7 Fortliwith a splendid new building was erected on one of
the most exclusive peaks of University Hill; quite above high
water mark or even the height of contour.

.‘l '

Script— -\Ve take this opportunity to extend greetings and

’“at home” cards to all the other schools on the compass, and
, would have them know that the School of Dentistry can al-

ways be (lepended upon for a liberal share of red ﬁre when any

[student commotion is instigated.

History informs us that the dental department has always
supplied the principal vertebrae to the “Varsity Spine" wheth-
er comprising eleven or nine. But. be that as it may, even
greater things may be safely expected ‘now that it is located
securely and painlessly in the very cardiac region of the Uni-
versity.

Junior History

Junior classes in past years have been freely accepted as
the best living example of the evolution of a freshman into a
raving, roaring roughneck, but this present collection of sick-
tooth artists has completely wrecked that old adage.

For further conﬁrmation of this statement consult Dir.
:\shbrook. His Thursday serenade, in B Series, expresses
such love and interest as might overcome a less hardy class
than 1914. VVhen Dr. McCurdy attempts to impress on us our
value to society and faculty his flow of language simply gums
up and sticks. Dr. Friesell does not employ English to ex-
press his feelings. He puts the lid on the smoking room.

It would be indeed selﬁsh if we should pretend that this
acknowledged excellency was due entirely to our own personal
potency when it is true that we have been the very first class to
enjoy the beneﬁts of such assistance and sympathy as is pos-
sible only-under the present system of preceptorship.

However large our troubles be

They cannot do us injury,

We simply visit preceptor

He drowns them all and calls for more.

The above poem has been safely passed by the National

Board of Censors, but for all that we are eagerly waiting for
an even greater production which listens something like “Hand

in your keys for here are your degrees".

FRANCIS KENNETH BECK, Crafton, Pa.
Crafton High School. Pittsburgh College.

Frank is afflicted with a disorder that Dr. Jones might pronounce
idiopathic but what some of his more intimate friends call an “atrophied
conscience.” As an organizer, Beck classes with Washington and Barney
Dreyfuss. For it was his affectionate handshake of welcome that dis-
pelled those acute green feelings of trepidation that were ours when we
made our initial appearance at Pitt Dental. In about ﬁfteen minutes he
had’the splendid class of ’I4 dead in love with each other and willing
to prove it by the loan of any instrument iii the Freshman outﬁt.

WILLIAM ORLO BOSS, AEA, Townville, Pa.
Alden Academy. Allegheny College.

Yes, girls, William died joking to the last. The fellows sitting nearest
him in lab couldn’t stand it any longer and when the opportunity pre-
sented one of the bravest dropped a handful of plaster. down the back
of his neck. Of course cremation would have been quicker, but that, more
than likely, would have dishevelled his outer garments, which heaven
forbid. Boss has occasional hard luck in soldering but in almost every
case he has succeeded in retaining all sulphurous exclamations.

C. CHARLES BRIGGS, ‘PQ, Newton Hamilton, Pa.
Juniata College.

A noble youth with a Greek proﬁle. Possessing a choice collection
of gestures and poses which vividly betray his imperial lineage. T12‘.
dance with its demand for grace and courtesy has a strong appeal for
Charles XIV. He has gained for himself an enviable position in Dr.
McCurdy's Hall of Fame and Honesty. His doctor will not permit us
to mention Dr. Goldsmitlfs pretty words of commendation. With a mind

much larger than his profession he is capable of developing an active
affection for a pretty maiden, even while she waits. . / fr
BEN K. BUCHANAN, AEA, Grove City, Pa.

Mercer Academy. Slippery Rock State Normal. G. P. Auto-

mobile School.

School teacher, auto expert, dentist. Ben even thought of being a
preacher at one time but got no farther than getting the collars. Well,
perhaps it is good to have another thing to go back to, in case you have
diﬂiculties, but in Ben’s case we think he will have no cause to change
his profession as he generally gets anything he goes after. That is, he
is especially successful in extractions.

 

 

 

 

WALTER G. SUTTON, AEA, Pleasantville, Pa.
Pleasantville High School.

And last of all came Sutton, a bright little fellow from Pleasautville
who smiles uproariously. His boisterous teasing style of standing still

‘invites a punch to the jaw which never lands for it always occurs to him

to get out of the way about that time. What is the use of being serious
when you can be like Sutton and have everybody like you. His relatives
and friends need never worry about Walter and his grades either, for his
ears are so sensitive that he can hear a man think the answer to a ques-
tion four rows away. ’

r

EARLE DE WITT BEACHAN, ‘P9, Braddock, Pa.

Swissvale High School. Pittsburgh Academy. Carnegie Tech-
nical Schools.

Beacham——the telephone girl. When not answering calls he is telling
when he expects the next one. His hobby is argument. Is no respector of
persons when he starts up. An occasional massage with a sand paper
disk would improve his physiognomy considerably. But on the other
hand. in opposition to these heinous faults just mentioned, we are happy
to advertise one great redeeming virtue:—-Earle smokes no cigarettes.

FERRY ARNEY BIDDLE, ASA, New Castle, Pa.
Slippery Rock State Normal. "Varsity Baseball. Class Football.

Class Baseball. Class Basketball. Class President 1912.

He would make such a perfectly militant suffragette. Still it took just
such a disposition as his to protect us from the deadly ravages of the ty-
rannical Juniors last year. Arney is a hustler and could sell you the shoes
you are wearing. Is sure not to let any grass grow under his feet. An~

. swer:—He would mow it down and sell it for hay. We would not call

Perry_a wizard, but he certainly covers his obligations in class room and
lab. with little display of time and effort.

LILIAN ELLEN BIRKETT, East Liverpool, Ohio.
East Liverpool High School.

A detailed description of Miss Birkett's personal characteristics would
sound entirely too much like a love letter for general publication. There-
fore we strive to restrain our natural impulse and simply state that this
particular suffragette controls the solid vote at Pitt Dental. There is not
a student but would embrace the opportunity of supporting our little
ladvjf she should show the least need of assistance. She is truly as good
a sport as any of her classmates, and we all join in wishing the fullest
measure of success in the practice of her father’s profession.

 

VVILLTAU GAYLORD BUCHANAN, AZA, Grove City, Pa.
.\lercer Academy.

It’s no use, girls, he’s a very much married man. Last'year “Doc”
was known to make frequent and extensive trips to Mercer, Pa., which
was all well and good. But this year when he deliberately tore “Her”
away from her happy home and brought her to school along with him
like Mary and her little lamb, our faith in human nature was shattered.
llowever we took them both in our arms and bestowed our blessing
and hearty congratulation.

JOHN GEARY BUTLER, AEA, Ellwood City, Pa.

Ellwood City High School. Cap and Gown. Glee Club. Class
Football.

There certainly must have been weeping and accluding of dentition
when Jack departed from Michigan and came to sign up with our folks.
His is a dreadfully happy and mirthful disposition. At church he ﬁlls his
ears with impression compound lest he be tempted to mix in a little “rag-
time” when the congregation gets up to sing. Shakespeare surely under-
stood when he remarked that as “The pen is mightier than the sword, so
Butler’s tongue can crush you with a word.”

FRANCIS JOSEF CARROLL, Monongahela, Pa. -
Scott’s Academy. Class Football,

If you ask Joe to do something he will always answer “Yes, if I
don’t do it today, I’ll forget.” About the only thing Joe don’t forget
to do is to see his girl. That is as much a habit with him as eating his
meals. Go to it Joe—Here’s hoping you don’t forget. This subject does
not limit himself solely to the serious things of life, for some of his ex-
periences on the train while going back and forth from school sound gay
and boyish. Never hesitate to go to Carroll tfor a favor for he will promise
you anything within his power—or without.

WATSON HARRY EVERHART, 2111(1), Sharon, Pa.

Sharon High School. Sharon College of Commerce. Temple Uni-
versity, Philadelphia. _ Class Football.

Harry has the distinction of belonging to a famous family of football
players. This may account for the display of outraged dignity he once
shot off in honor of Dr. McCurdy. Everhart is generally regarded as an
agreeable, affectionate young man and if his right hand neighbor"is willing
to stand for it, surely boys in the class can acquire a toleration.

WILLIAM ELLIS FERINGER, ASA, Barceloneta, Porto Rico.
New Castle High.

Bill started here once, hesitated, and has now started in again. We
certainly think that a previous class lost a good man when he dropped
out for a few years to run the Porto Rican government for Uncle Sam.
Bill says you can buy an auto every time you hammer in a gold ﬁlling
down there. We expect him to keep at least two auto factories busy all
the year round. We wonder how he is going to_ spend all the money
he makes out of the rest of his practice.

W. CLYDE HASLETT, IPQ, Pittsburgh, Pa.
East liberty Academy. Cheer Leader. Y. M. C. A. ’Varsity

Track Team. Class Football.

All together now fellows let’s give a rousing Alle-genac, lots of pep
and show them we have the spirit. That’s our pop; a regular little ﬁre-
brand when it pertains to athletics. Pop made the University Track
Team through hard and faithful work and put up a sterling and game
light in the class football game with the Freshies. Having ambitions of
becoming a regular M. D. he took a full year of medicine but later de-
cided to follow in the footsteps of Pop Sr. and so became a dental student.
His great number of friends was shown in the successful fight for the job
of head cheer leader. Keep it up Pop we are all proud of you.

OSCAR O. HAZLETT, Charleroi, Pa.
Valentines Academy.

Oscar started his professional career with the ambition of making
modern dentistry more painless but later his ambitions got sidetracked
and he invented the Oh! Oh! Eatem up Pitt yell that has been inﬂicting
agony on his fellow beings ever since. A gentleman in every sense, mild-
mannered and a steady worker. But even he has been heard to cuss when
things go wrong as they often do in the Junior lab.

WILLIAM FULTON JACKSON, AEA, New Castle, Pa.

New Castle High. Western Military Academy. Cap and Gown
Club, ’I2, ’I3. Class Football. Class Basketball. Dental Manager
of OWL Board.

Willie’s life ran along quietly and smoothly until one morning he
carelessly stated the assessment for our wise old 1914 OwL. Since that
time he throws a shower of tears every time he thinks of poor old Doc
Yak in the Sunday Leader. Shall we condemn his fondness for attractive
cravats when his leisure hours are spent with such associates as Linn and
Phillipbar of the Senior class?

 

CLARENCE BURLEIGH JAMES, 1119, Charleroi, Pa.

Elwood High School, Elwood, Ind. Douglas Business College.
Alden Academy. Student Senate.

Judging from his expression Beak might eat a graven image. But,
fellow countrymen, his looks belie him. A more gentle loving disposi-
tion has never been located, especially in Charleroi, where the stars are
ever shining and her face is ever bright. If you are able to separate
Clarence from his pipe, you will set free a tongue active and smooth as
Tuxedo. As for his pipe, it is strong enough to take care of itself. James
is known as the guy that butted the bull off the bridge.

WILLIAM JOHNSTON LACOCK, \1I§_2, N. 5., Pittsburgh, Pa.

Allegheny High School. Penn State College. Cap and Gown.
Track.

Bill takes life and himself too seriously. During the early fall he
evidenty had great ambitions of ﬁlling a heavy part in some Shakespear-
ean role for he grew 21 very cute little black mustache. But alas for
dreams! Bill's must have vanished and with it went the mustache. Bed
is evidently Bivll’s best friend for never yet has he seemed able to separate
himself from it in time for a nine o'clock lecture. One Big Ben just
before rising might cure this disease. Like good wine, improves with age.

189

BENJAMIN LEVIN, Pittsburgh, Pa.

Pittsburgh High School. East Liberty Academy.

Here lies Benjamin, child of Mr. and Mrs. Levin a11d of whom they
may be justly proud. When first he joined our_ happy family we took
the liberty-to call him Adolph, but since that time sporulation has set
in and his nicknames are now numbered by the thousands. His sunny
upturned smile invites a conﬁdence and comradeship which his class-
mates are not slow to'take advantage of in case any of their own labora-
tory equipment is mislaid. Treat him with fairness and courtesy and he
would let you have the home waltz with his favorite Rebecca.

GEORGE LEONARD LONG, ASA, Greensburg, Pa.
Delmont High School. Delmont Normal School.

Commonly known as Long George. Migrated from Congruity, to
which place he expects to some day return and enlighten that small pop-
ulation with his large knowledge of dentistry. Even at that Geo. is a
good fellow and is exceedingly liberal with his old tobacco pouch. Had

a very remunerative position at Forbes Field last season keeping all the ‘

hits clean. Is in good standing with his landlady when she does not have
him treed under the table with an ugly looking fork.

 

 

 

 

 

WILLIAM RUFUS LOPER, ‘PQ, Wheeling, \/Vest Va.

Wheeling High School. President of Dental Senate.
‘ Representative to Board of Control.

Dental

Senator—Mr. Chairman~—vBill. Bill came to us from Wheeling a shy
blushing lad, but has developed wonderfully since. Indeed it is a fact
that Bill took at least two ladies to one of the Senate Hops a11d had a
good time, too. Only an exceptional student could bear his burden of
school activities and still be on friendly terms with the faculty. He
enjoys an oppressing sense of responsibility. When Loper smiles his face

.looks round. When sad his feet lie next the ground.

HERVE C. MANON, ‘PS2, Carothers, Pa.
Morris Township High School.

The fall of 1912 found this young man on the campus at Pitt, where
he soon made friends with all the fellows—well—met. Because of his asso-
ciation with distinguished names he is destined to be great. Manon is
related to the “Father of his Country” by birth in \Nashington County;
like Lincoln he was born in a log cabin—-and proud of it; by ambition he
is a ﬁrst cousin to Caesar, and in love, none can excel.

I90

PHIL EMMETT MATHEWS, AEA, l\lcKeesport, Penna.
McKeesport High School. ‘ I
Emmett is very quiet and reserved. He is a good. worker and a good

fellow. It is admitted that he has his faults. one being that he is from
l\/[cKeesport, but such small matters are easily overlooked. He is well
liked by all. He (l0es not make himself offensive by continually breaking
jokes but his open face grin proves that he has a sense of humor just the
same.

ROBERT DUDLEY MEIKLE, ASA, Turtle Creek, Pa.

Union High School.
tary.

Ohio Northern University. Class Secre-

Bob is a quiet, serious fellow who is all work and study. He has no
glad looks for the fair sex while in Pittsburgh but that does not cover
his actions at home. He says he goes home every night but we are at
a loss to know where he spends his spare time since he has dropped
the undertaking business. There are only two fellows from Turtle Creek
that we really like and Robert is one of them.

 

 

OTTS G. MOORE, ]r., AEA, Knox, Pa.
Edenburg High School.

If you don't see “Ponkey” first he will brush an imaginary grain of
dust from your coat sleeve and greet you with -“Lend me a quarter so
I can eat.” He has never been known to raise any money by this
plan but if he should he would more than likely spend it for beans or
some other insubstantial dessert. Oh Gee! is not cursing when Moore is
around for that is the name he got when he was baptised.

CHALMER B. MCCOMBS, ASA, Youngstown, Ohio.
Ohio Northern University.

Mac looks to be a quiet, peace—loving citizen, and he really is at times.

But when there is a rough house the police generally drag Mac out last.’

Chalmer has a style and manner entirely his own and he has to be under-
stood to be entirely enjoyed, for otherwise you might be tempted to faint
when he growls at you. His wife need never hesitate to buy a new
“Electric” for Mac can knock out more work for his weight than any man
in the class.

I91

HARRY T. MCKNIGHT, McKees Rocks, Pa.
Oakdale High School.
It is a question whether Harry will be able to stay away from his

grandmother long enough to get established in his profession. But.don’t
get a1armed—this boy will never starve for no one has seen him when
he wasn’t munching at a big piece of lunch. He shows the results of
this dissipation too, for as the child is fed, so the waist expands. The
fat is developing in the proper place, though, for Harry quite’ fizequently
displays real intelligence, at least :1 keen insight into his abstract, when
answering questions.

FREDERICK CARL PETERS, North Warren, Pa. _
Warren High School. Class Football. Class Baseball.

F. C. Peters of North Warren is better known as “Kats, the Yiddish
Life Saver.” Pete is the guy that gets the grades. He is never satisﬁed
with less than 99, even though he is compelled to buy a new set of books
about every three months. As for prescription writing, he’s there. Kats
is the only lad in school who ﬁghts shy of the girls. He is neither bash-
ful nor timid, but Oh, that Queen at home! Peters, aside from being a
favorite chocolate, deserves recognition as a baseballist.

RONALD M. REID, IPQ, East Pittsburgh, Pa.
Union High School.

A child of sorrow and acquainted with disease, for his early life was

‘HOWARD CAMERON RINK, QIQ, Hoboken, Pa.

Grove City College, ’o8, Ph.B. Class President I9I3. Member
of Athletic Committee.

Rink doesn't get many points as a Mellin’s Food baby, but he is
quite fat enough to keep the front wheels of the Class of 1914 in the
middle of the road. As chief executive of his class he was able, by the
power of his cool masterful oratory and _incomparab1e diplomacy, to con-
vert a raving, violent mob of dental politicians into a hearty unanimous
vote for Old Murphy, the class pet and basket ball captain.

DAMASSO RAMON RIVERA, AEA, Coamo, Porto‘ Rico.
Coamo Iligh School. Louisiana State University.

“Hookem Cow” started a revolution in his room one day and after
smashing up a few choice articles of furniture, was deposed from his
temporary throne by his good old landlady. However, a tub of ice water
quickly brought him to and now he is quietly preparing himself for a
D. D. S. degree which he can carry back home and inflict on the poor
helpless natives, Although Damasso has'always ranked as an excellent
student, nobody has held it against him and he is ‘well liked by every
member of his class.

FRED R. SMITH, ‘{1Q, Brilliant, Ohio.
New Castle High School. ’Varsity Baseball ’I2

Fred agrees with the sage who said that real genius depends on being
misunderstood. It is no use, though Smithy, for we know you are not
as savage as you try to appear. A splendid example of physical perfec-
tion aiid quite willing to display it when any of the instructors give him
an opportunity. Fred attends strictly to his own business and asks very
little advice from his neighbors. Too bad there aren't more men of Fred’s
style for Smiths may come and Smiths may go but none look good as
Freddie.

 

GEORGE A. SMITH, Jr., ‘HQ, Allegheny, Pa.

Smity—the Old War Horse. Smith kept it a secret but in some
mysterious way it got out at last—he’s married. He is one of the boys
who has his younger days all spent. Very fond of the Movies and
vo—devil. When he is not in the laboratory he can be found at the
Olympic Nick or the Harris. While G. A. is not the speediest man in the
class he does his work thoroughly and well. Smith might have made a
reputation as a philosopher but with a wife and the present cost of living
he had to take up something more practical.

ARTHUR WILLIAM SPEEDY, ASA, Indiana, Pa.
Indiana Normal School.

Our hero has a very unsatisfactory cognomen for a name specialist
would immediately conclude that Speedy was fast. This would be en-
tirely wrong for Arthur’s liveliest dissipation does not exceed a ﬁve cent
“Movie show.” On the other hand, if your eyes were quick enough to
follow him, as he rushes up the hill to a nine o’clock lecture ten or
ﬁfteen minutes after the opening service, you would begin to think of
lightning and other quick actors.

Steve is a man of immense experience and capabilities. But worst

of all, he is married and happy. May his wife never learn of his esca-
pades with the pretty female passengers who sit near Speers between
Spears and Pittsburgh. Can any good come of a man who would delib-
erately push a_l)rick through a plate glass window and then be first to ask
who did it when the proprietor came rushing out to investigate? Wouldrft

such a creature be tempted to mix leather washers in his ﬁlling materials.

ALEXANDER MALCOLM ALLEN, AEA, Turtle Creek, Pa.
Union High School.

Otherwise known as the “Runt" but nobody knows the reason why..
In fact‘ Allen is so diminutive as to often be taken for Polly Galvin’s
shadow when he was a little boy. Even though nature did cheat Alex
in stature he belies the old gag that children should be seen and not
heard for he never lets anyone forget that he is around. Shorty, although
a minister’s son, is a popular little fellow with the boys and if we may
believe him, with the ladies as well. Go to it, Alex. That’s what we like
about you. ,

WILLIAM M. WALLACE. Ingram, Pa.
Carnegie High School. Chartiers Valley Pitt Club.

Bill—Mr. Wallace—The human football. When you feel a grouch
coming on take it out on Bill. There is nothing about an auto that Bill
cannot work except the starter when he stops to see Ethel. Likes to play
pool and attend lectures where be generally interrupts with his musical
sneezing. Willie's verdant beard inspired Edwards to write his latest
song hit, entitled “Mary, Mary, Mary, Hide Your Face in the Grass.”

LOGAN ARTHUR \/VILLARD, 11/Q_ Apollo, Pa.

Apollo High School

A peculiarly fortunate child in possessing trustful and not too exact-
ing parents, for otherwise it might be otherwise and possibly no welcome
checks from home either. He speaks frequently, yea soulfully, of his
native hamlet on the cinder covered banks of the Kiski, known geograph-
ically and mythologically as Apollo, P3,. whether spelled forwards or
backwards.

E. Wayne Vl/olford. now known as "Fink” in the “Fink and Kats

where he grew and waxed strorg, both physically and intellectually.
“Wolly” came to Pitt because his Star of Bethlehem, whoever she is led
him here. He early put on the armor of Gold and Blue and can shout
“Hail to Pitt" with all the zeal of a Spartan soldier. Fink is a good

W. H. HOFFMAN, Jeannette, Pa.

Hock! Der Kaiser. A great traveller. VVent to Greensburg with
Payne and had to raise the dough to get back by singing. They had no
trouble getting out of town but Hoffman said it was awfully hard on the
feet. Some men are born singers. others acquire voices but we have
music thrust upon us when Hoffman gathers the dental quartette in a
corner and asks them if they are ready. W. H. has a professional ap-
pearance and there is nothing to hinder his becoming a first class dentist
if he can only arrange to get a little of his laboratory work off.

HOWARD BOCK, ‘HQ, Sharpsburg, Pa.

Canton High School.
Class Vice President.

Ohio State University. Class Football.

Howard can break open a good joke and look as serious as a preacher
at a cabaret show. That isn’t saying anything mean against the minister
either, for Bock can make as good a full solder as any preacher who
ever stuck two loving hearts together. llis willingness to write on the
board for the instructors proves that he would have made a first class
stenographcr if he had been prettier and a girl. Good old Bock! How
we love it!

LEO JOSEPH JENDRZESKI, Carnegie, Pa.
Pitt Pharmacy School, Ph.G.

Our Polish Shark from Carnegie. Don’t search the laboratory if you
want to ﬁnd Leo for he is always with HoFfn1an. He conducts himself in'
a quiet, unassuming, though rather mysterious manner, and has never
been seen trying to kill anybody in the smoking room. These virtues
deserve especial mention for they are very rare in the Dental Depart-
Possibly Jen has never fully recovered from that quarter pound
dose of Sodium Bromide he took by niistake down at Pharmacy the year
he graduated.

JOEL SISSMAN, Pittsburgh, Pa.
Brooklyn College of Pharmacy, Ph.G.

A studious student and his recitations prove it. He deserves the
greater credit when you consider the responsibilities and anxieties which
are his as assistant captain of the Class Basket ball team. It is diﬂicult
for one of Joel’s temperamental disposition to endure the sordid atmos-
phere of a dental school, but he is putting up a noble struggle that his
friend Olean may have some one to love, cherish and obey.

HOWARD B. HENDERSON, qio, Kittanning, pi.

Kittanning High School. Thiel College.

Alias Luke or Fess. Fess came to Pitt from Thiel College with a
reputation of being some fusser and a determination to live up to all
expectations. According to latest reports Luke is supplying the genuine
article. An all—round good fellow with plenty of pep and ability to make
a success in life but rather too easy going. A fact which Luke is begin-
ning to recognize. Dig in Fess and the good things in life will come later
as a natural sequence to things accomplished now.

GEORGE A. WASHABAUGH, Grove City.

Grove City High School. Grove City College.

Just manages to escape the penalty of the law as applied to conver-
sation hucksters. He employs no standard measure for distribution and
the quality is such as to engage your rapt attention long after class has
been announced. His acquaintances range from Alpha to Omaha and
every victim can quote instances in George's past momentous life that
make your blood run cold. A sharp student but does not respect the
memory of the guy that put the work in laboratory.

MARK ROONEY HOAG, (PP,
Holy Cross Prep. University of Penna. ’Varsity Football ’i2.

It isn’t always safe to judge a man by the way he behaves in his
Sunday School clothes. But this doesn’t apply to our Irish Dutchman for
that word “behave” has never been clearly explained to him. He keeps
himself in condition for football the year round and is liable to try a
ﬂying tackle when you least expect it. Somebody is going to get bene-
ﬁts out of their accident insurance if they dcn’t show more respect for
Rooney's overcoat when he leaves it in the locker room.

J. F. FOLZ, M.D., AEA, Philadelphia, Pa.

Camden Figh School. Sts. Peter and Paul Parochial of Camden
Medico-Chi of Philadelphia.

Some one has said that when Doc. takes off his hat he is half naked.
That does not signify that he is one of those half naked denizens of the
black forests of Africa, for a man who can equal him in class, lab or
obstetrics has got to be a member of the highest race in the human
family. His only fault is his uncontrollable passion for cigarette cou-
pons. Every time he sees a tack he turns it over on its side for fear it
might puncture a tire when he gets enough coupons collected for the
automobile.

KUSSIEL HORELICK, Miusk, Russia.
Graduate of St. Wladimir University of Kieff.

Father of the class by right of superiority in age and mustache.
Possesses a quiet unintelligible disposition. Distributes no news. Left a
happy home in Russia, where he was a graduate dentist, for fear the
Czar might select him for court dentist. We congratulate him on his
narrow escape for the best of operators will inflict a little discomfort upon
a patient at times. A cigarette and a match will make Horlick happy-
until he gets another cigarette rolled.

GEORGE A. GEHLERT, Duquesne, Pa.

Villa Nova Prep, St. Vince‘it's College. ’Varsity Football "09,

Never mind, Pappy, I'll be a dentist yet. Dutch emphatically dis-
agrees with Edison when he says that man does not need more than
two hours. sleep in twenty—four. It is not on record that Thomas A. ever
played four big quarters of college football either. George is such a
quiet, unassuming boy that he was captured in broad day light in the
vicinity of Duquesne by the present Mrs. Gehlert. And Pitt rejoiced when
she dedicated her child to our Fine Old ’Varsity.

JAMES HORROCKS, ‘IJQ, Wilmerding, Pa.
Union High School. Class Football,

It is easy enough to be cheery, when life goes along like a song,
But the man worth while is the man who will smile when his typodant
is gone.

Come on in Jim, the suds are ﬁne. It just about kills this boy to
stand up on both feet and recite, especially to our nice little quiz—master in
Physiology. Jim is fat but we love him any way.

EDWARD SPEAR BRACKEN, Jr., qtg, McKeesport, Pa.

McKeesport High School. Mercersburg Academy. Class Foot-
ball. Class Basketball.

This smiling youth with the innocent face and criminal hair cut
ﬂoated down the Monongahela from McKeesport. Arrested for vagrancy,
the judge sentenced him to three years of hard labor at Pitt Dental. If
the judge could only realize the torture Bud has suffered during the time
already served, he would surely, out of the kindness of his fatherly
heart, add another year to the young man’s sojourn at Pitt. Moral: It
is a wise man who does not follow his own inclinations.

JOHN HUTCHISON, ‘P9, New Bethlehem, Pa.
New Bethlehem High School.

One way to ﬂatter the average man is to ask him for advice, but
Hutchison gives it whether you ask him or not. Downright good advice,
too, for his has been the rare privilege of attending school at Medico-
Chi. Now Medico—Chi is a marvelous school that cannot be excelled in a
single department. Pages could be employed in describing her glories, so
who dares blame the class of 1914 for feeling chesty when a man will de-
liberately sacriﬁce such a glorious institution in favor of our modest
Training Quarters which cannot even boast a lunch room at times.

CARL WALLACE HAYES, ‘IIQ, Butler, Pa.
Butler, Pa. Marietta College. Class Football.

Class Basketball.

Snack, like all other clever wits is not a bit shy when it comes to
displaying it. He spares neither faculty nor classmates, male nor Lilian,
Jew or Gentile. For, like a drunken baby hit with a brick, we are all
sure to fall. This is not the worst to be said of Jack’s friend, either,
for he has pictures portraying him as a regular athlete. He may be
worthy of investigation for a Freshman has said that he plays football
in a very striking manner.

CARY BLEDSAL MORRIS, AEA, Covesville, Va.
Cove Academy.

Morris certainly goes.the pace that kills. His speed is much faster
than one would “natchally” expect in a native of the sunny South, where
the chickens have the reputation of laying omelets in the recently dissected
timothy. Still when you see Cary studying Pathology, setting up teeth and
singing “Steam Boat Bill” all at the same time, you begin to understand
why his eﬂiciency is so much higher than the rest of us. We shall all
be glad to visit Morris when he gets nicely established among his friends
down in “Old Virginia.”

HOWARD F. KEYSER, ‘IIQ, Duquesne, Pa.

Duquesne High School. Ohio VVesleyan University.

Procrastination is his besetting sin but he d.oes not mind it, so what
is the use of operating on him? It remains a mystery how a well-dressed
young man like Keyser can be so handsome and not become proud. He
would just as soon ask assistance, if he needed it, of the shortest man in
the class as the greatest. We like Keyser for a very large number of
things, not the least of which is that handy little car he drives. Blessings
on you, Red Haired Boy, and may your steering arm never grow shaky.

WILLIAM OLEON, Pittsburgh, Pa.
Russia Gymnasium.

Oleon is one of our musical critics. And his 0. K. is as difficult
to secure as Dr. Booths’ in the case of a full upper and lower. He pos-
sesses a brain which is several years in advance of the rest of his class-
mates, but that never prevents his being present when anything musical
is occurring. He has the added advantage of knowing a clever sister
in the Senior class who serves as his private advisory board. Even at
that he has been known to crack a facing during the process of soldering.

JOHN W. ASTRY, ASA, Salem, Ohio.
Salem High School.

Jack is the only member of our class who enjoys the reputation of
having once been a regular hard guy and recovered. The rest of us still
have it. Whether Billy Sunday or Salvation Jane. deserves credit for
his conversion we do not know. But the fact remains that Jack 1S now
a model student and can recite with just as loud and emphatic a voice
as any of us. It might be added that this same yoice may be heard 111
laboratory also, especially if Astry is in the near vicinity.

GEORGE M. M. CONNELLY, AZA, Pittsburgh, Pa.
Shadyside Academy.

G. M. MC, etc. comes to classes at least once a month, or rather, just
as often as that little “queen” can spare him. Too bad a fellow can’t
make love and hollow metal crowns at the same time. George has always
got a story handy and delivers it in a style similar to the exhaust on a
motorcycle. Can’t help but love Connelly for he doesn’t come around
often enough to become a nuisance. He is well known in and about East
Liberty—but so far has managed to escape conviction.

MELVIN FROST BROADWATER, ‘HQ, Grantsville, Md.
St. Johns’ Military Academy. Member’ of Junior Prom Committee.

Dr. Frederick Linstrom has written a very complete treatise on this
species of bird in a previous instalment of this worthy book. And the
natural course of a year’s evolution did not succeed in raising it to a more
complex class, it has had a good time and revelled in several very inter-
esting developments. Most important of which are modern dancing, with
its transformation from a pretty entrancing two step to a catch as catch
can contest between the dancers, and his affairs with the Janes.

WILLIAM J. LEAHY, ‘P9, N. 5. Pittsburgh, Pa.
Allegheny High School.

And still they gazed and still the wonder grew that a laddic with such
pretty hair could slay the guards he slew. Bill has anchored down Pitt's
center against many a terrific bump. But next season he is going to get
his name on the All-American Football Team and at the same time get
satisfaction for a splintered nose he has been carrying around in a sling
all winter. Leahy ca.n escort the goods and might have been captain of
1913 ’Varsity but for his pleasant disposition and deficiency in sulphur-
ous eloquence.

“Jack” is a product of Westminster College, where he cultivated a
taste for athletics and argumentation. He is the real King Pin of the Jack
and Snack Dear Friend Association, but that does not prevent the Snack
from making a strike occasionally. In fact John is never so brilliant as
when he has Snack’s reassuring grin to lay his hand on. The class would
never recover if he should forsake it and take up the ministry, life in-
surance or something.

B. CLYDE COOMBE, ‘I19, Mingo Junction, 0.

The only downright wicked member of the Junior class. His degre-

He possesses an unusual constitution and except for his heart—breaking
confessions you would never associate dissipation with a face so fair.
Clyde is still in the game though and bids fair to become a useful citizen
for all his baritone escapades. He should think of the torture some of
last year’s Seniors suffered just before the State Board convened.

RUSSELL PHILIP CUSTER, IPQ, Stoyestown, Pa.

Conceit is the least of Custer’s faults and real boldness is a minus
quantity. Even the doctors declare his internal organs perfectly nor-
mal and his periphery absolutely up to the standard. Arcy is the
only son of a man who really received benefit from sowing wild oats.
I-Ie proved himself worthy of graduation from the rubiform class when he
suggested, with a perfect ring of cigarette smoke, that big Joe take the
ﬂy paper out of his samlals an(l hustle along to class. For further infor-
mation refer to “Custer’s last stand or third down and three inches to

The work of a historian is to Search the records
of the past, note the rise and fall of nations, and use his
imagination as to the future trend of the great topic Civil-
ization.

These records are not old and musty for ours is but
a short existence—yet some of the facts and truths con-
ﬁned to the roll of parchment are undecipherable merely
for the fact that the historian cares not to reveal some of
the secrets which are precious to us as a body.

So with the data gathered and with the help of a
vivid imagination, I will endeavor to weave you a beauti-
ful story, dispersing her and there a few grains of truth,
like golden threads running through a costly fabric.

So—Throughout the month of September the
steps leading into the famous old building on Bluff Street
were used by young men with determined countenances
and perhaps I should say faltering steps, yet oncegin the
office and matriculation over and with the realization that
on the ﬁrst of the coming month things would look
brighter, they would feel their courage returning.

The month of October arrived and with it came what
may be easily termed a selected class. For some time
things were strange and new to us but these gradually
wore away and the class foundation was complete and we

began to realize more or less clearly that there were tiL‘:~‘.
which bound us one to another; that We had come tn-
gether, that we would run the race together; in short tlml
we were the class of "13 and ’14.

The class was slow in organizing, clue to the fact that
many minor difﬁculties had to be overcome, but they were
ﬁnally overcome, officers elected and a more binding lie
was made.

The class is proud of its record and we are all Ptoud
of the only girl in the class for many reasons, for she has
the class spirit that is never found wanting.

If any are amazed at the rapid advancement and the
place that the class has taken among the other Junior
Dept. Classes let them observe a few points, which may
help to clear up the mystery. Studiousness, personality,
courage. originality, leadership, their record as to the
preceding classes—these are some of the many things
which distinguish this class from previous classes and lead
people to predict that in 1915 the different states that are
represented will be greatly blest by receiving some of the
best and most useful Druggists ever graduated from Pitt.

So you see I have kept my word as to the ﬂowery
description, leaving out the story of the rough road that
many of us have to travel for it is known throughout the

University that the Pharmacy Departme'nt is the hard working
Department and if we have taken our proper place among the
other departments it is for the reason that the class has
stuck together and co—operated in everything that has
made us what We are.

Granted this isn’t exactly as a class history
should be, but remember as I told you in the beginning

ours is but a short existence and the history is short. So
let me add in conclusion that our class owes much to the
Faculty for the interest and support they have given to
the class undertakings and with their continued encour-
agement the class can rank in the foremost ranks of the
different Departments.

dent when he “tries”. The chief class cutter. Love is a curious thing, so
saith “Stevie”, at least the telephone wires between Greensburg and Glen-
shaw are kept busy. Originator of Stevie’s Quartet, in which he is chief
musician. Stevie is never too busy to help a friend and is one of the

GLENN HOWARD LONG, Delmont, Pa.

Long may be live and short be his troubles. A marvel of the class,

“Slow, but perfectly sure.” Another one of the loyal West Virginia

proved since coming to Pitt. So don’t be surprised if he turns traitor to

“Happy go lucky and free from care.” “Hony” is one of the real fun
makers of the class and his sunny disposition has made him a favoritewith
all. We know that he applies himself diligently to his studies, but the ex-
amination somehow gets his Angora. So as the time goes on we begin
to think that he is destined to the Moving Picture business. He'll win
fame this year on the Varsity nine.

MERLE JOSEPH NADOLNY, Pittsburgh, Pa.

“Study is a systematic research.” “Merlie” has been heard to remark
that Pharmacy was the bane of his young life; but nevertheless -notwith-
standing that fact, you can always ﬁnd him on the job by 8 A. M. He is
a great ionizier, that is, if he doesn’t know what he is talking about. He

goes from positive to negative.

the beginning of the University of Pittsburgh, the oldest University in the United States west of the
Alleghenies. In that little settlement of pioneers, where the Monongahela and Allegheny Rivers join

 

In 1787 Hugh Henry Brackenridge, a classmate of President James Madison at Princeton, secured the en-
actment of a law incorporating the Pittsburgh Academy as a seat of learning. The incorporators were men of
affairs and prominence at that time and their activity in founding the school was but one of many examples of
their public spirit. All of these men whose names appear as incorporators were graduates of Princeton and pion-
eers in the cause of education, through whose lal)ors subsequently V\/ashington and Jefferson came into being.

Such was the prosperity of the Academy at the close of the second decade of the last century that the mani—
fest necessity for the establishment in this community of an institution of higher learning gave birth to a move-
ment to reincorporate the Academy as, “The VVestern University of Pennsylvania.” This was approved in 1819.

The ﬁrst faculty was Very catholic in regard to its me1nbers——Presbyterian, Reformed, Associate Presbyter-
ian and Romanists worked together at a time when denominational rivalry was so keen. Among the student
body the same generosity prevailed.

The university continued for 27 years and among the alumni of that period we1‘e,—one United States Senator,
four Representatives, three Chief Justices, two Governors, one Ambassador, two Judges of the United States and

Football

The football sea-
son at Pitt was cer-
tainly a disastrous one.
The team did not win
a single big game, gai11-
ing but three Victories
out of ni11e games, an(l
these were recorded
over the minor colleges
on the schedule. It is
true that several games
were very closely con-
tested, but in each in-
stance the team lacked
the necessary punch to
- put over a Victory.

* was a disappointment,
it is certainly to be con-
gratulated on the show-
ing which it made.
Time after time, although beaten, they fought to the last

ditch, and as a result, wo11 praise 011 all sides. This ﬁght-
ing spirit made them dangerous contenders at all times.

The fundamental reason for this unsuccessful season
was the scarcity of seasoned material. Of last year's team,
only four regular players remained: Captain Galvin,
“Red” Smith “Bill” Leahy and “Hube” \Vagner, a quar-
tet of football players the equal of any linemen in the
country. These four players represented the backbone
of the team and the major portion of the praise is due
them. Captain Galvin, however, was incapacitated in the
Carlisle Indian game, sustaining a fractured collar bone,

and was compelled to remain out of the lineup until the _

VV. & J. game. Tlierefore, during the greater part of the
season, there were eight new men on the team, with a
constantly changing lineup and the season’s record was all
that could be expected, under these circumstances.
Head Coach “Joe” Thompson issued the ﬁrst call for
candidates, three weeks before school opened. About
twenty—ﬁve men responded to the call, which squad was
steadily augmented, and in a week’s time there were forty
men practising daily on Trees Stadium. To coach this
squad, all but a half dozen of whom were new men, was

_ Rose, ’96. The ﬁrst week was spent in punting, tackling

the dummy, forward passing and other preliminary stunts.
The second week was a repetition of the ﬁrst week’s work,
but with a still larger squad participating.

The week before the opening game with Ohio North—  '
ern marked the real beginning of hard practice. Scrim- 
mages were held daily, and from the ﬁerce nature of the 
competition in the scrub games, it appeared as though in 
Pitt would have nothing short of a championship team. 7 ’

At the end of this week “Joe” had three sets of backﬁeld

men and two different lines ready for the fray, and every-
thing was in readiness for the opening of the season with
Ohio Northern University,

Ohio Northern Game

In this game, Pitt duplicated the score of the pre-
ceeding _Vear, 22—o. The teams were almost evenly
matched as to weight, but Ohio Northern had no chance
to score at any time, being completely out—played by Pitt.
Coach Thompson used, in all, twenty—four players during
the progress of the game, and every one of these per~
formed splendidly.

\\’agner starred for Pitt, by reason of his wonderful
tackling and long end runs. Galvin also played well, his
long, well—directed punts confusing the opponents’ back-
ﬁeld considerably. For Ohio Northern, Peters the giant
fullback, and both ends, Grisbaum and Gardner were the
stars.

Westminster Game

On Saturday, October 5, Pitt ran across a “Tartar”
in the \\'estminster College team. Although greatly out-
weighed, they held Pitt to two touchdowns, and them-
selves scored a ﬁeld goal, the ﬁnal score being 13—3.

VVagner, for Pitt, again starred, making seemingly
impossible tackles, mostly of the necktie variety. Schoff
and Dillon also played brilliantly, each making big gains
through the visitors’ line. McLoughrey, the V\/estminster
fullback, and Blair, the halfback, pulled off good runs,
while McLoughrey proved to be a “bear” on the defense.

GAME

 

Bucknell Game

The Bucknell game was a big surprise to the Pitt fol-
lowers. Although forewarned that Bucknell had one of
the best teams in her history, the local Pitt adherents did
not see any cause to fear. True to the advance notices,
Bucknell arrived with one of the best drilled football ma-
chines that has been seen on Forbes Field in a long time,
and defeated Pitt——6 to o.

The work of Topham, the Bucknell fullback, is es-
pecially worthy of comment. His punts averaged about

ﬁfty—ﬁve yards, together with the fact that he was a most '

consistent ground—gainer. Capt. Jordan at end, also played
a stellar game, tackling ﬁnely and scoring the lone touch-
down in the last few minutes of play, on a forward pass
from quarterback Cruikshank. “Dutch” Hockensmith and

“Red” Smith stopped many of the opponents’ line rushes,
and were directly responsible for the low score. T

CROWD AT

STATE GAME

Galvin and \/’\«"agner played in a brilliant manner
throughout the entire game, \Nagner almost setting the
eight thousand spectators wild, time and again, with his
hair—raising tackles of the Re<l—Skin backﬁel-d men. Con-
nelly, although handicapped by his lack of weight, carried
the ball well. “Red” Smith and Leahy performed i11 their
usual fautless manner against the powerful Aborigines.

Navy Game

On Friday, October 25, the Varsity, accompanied by
a band of loyal rooters, left Pittsburgh, their destination

 

240

being Annapolis, Maryland, where they opposed the Navy
team on Saturday, October 26. This event marked the
initial competition in any branch of sport between the
two institutions. Navy won the game, after a very hard
battle by a 13—6 score. '
The gritty game put up by the locals was a most
pleasant surprise, because, on paper, Pitt, with her crippled
team, was not even conceded to have a look—in with her
heavier opponents. As it was, Pitt played the Navy to a
standstill in the ﬁrst quarter, the score at the end of this
period standing even, 6—6. and this too with the absence

of Hockensmith, who had been .substituting at center for
Captain Galvin, who had been disabled in the Indian game.
Hockensmith was compelled to retire, with a badly sprained
knee, shortly after the opening of the game, Blair taking
his place. The Navy’s advantage in weight and their
numerous substitutions, told in the second quarter, however,
when they suceeded in scoring another touchdown, mak—
ing the ﬁnal score 13-6, as they were unable to score in
the second half.

Wagner was the bright particular star of the game,
as the Navy did not begin to have a man who played up
to “Hube’s” standard. His punts were such, as had not
been seen on the Navy ﬁeld since the departure of Dalton.
Wagner’s best accomplishment of the day was his wonder-
ful quick-kicking from formation. He also proved to be
Pitt’s best ground—gainer, and his tackling was well—nigh
perfect. Dillon and Reese fought splendidly, and VVard
and Kernohan plunged well.

Cook, Ingram and Gilchrist played “bang—up” foot-
ball for the Navy, especially Gilchrist, who was on the
big end of most of the forward passes, never failing to
gain in this manner.

Notre Dame Game

The Pitt team played more real football in the Notre
Dame game than it did in all the other games on the
schedule combined. It was a neck and neck affair the

251

whole way, and not until the last few minutes of play,
when Dorias for Notre Dame, kicked a ﬁne ﬁeld goal
from the 23-yard line, was there a score registered by
either team. W/ith the score 3—~o against the locals, the
real climax came at the end of the game, when, with but
15 seconds of time remaining, Ward of Pitt missed a ﬁeld
goal, by inches only, and Pitt had lost her last chance to tie
the score.

To Quarterback Schoff, Wagner, Pratt, Smith and
Leahy belongs the larger end of the praise. Schoff showed
ﬁne generalship and made substantial gains every time he
carried the ball. VVagner out—booted Dorias, the Notre
Dame punter, and also pulled off his usual number of
hair—raising tackles and long runs. Smith, Shapira, Pratt,
and Leahy formed an invincible quartet in the center of
the line, and held their ground valiantly on every occa-
sion. Dorias, Eichenlaub, Pliska and Berger played the
sterling article of football for Notre Dame. 

Maryland College Game

On November 9., an “almost football team,” repre-
senting the University of Maryland, appeared on Forbes
Field as opponents for “Pittsburgh’s hitherto-much-
beaten football team.” The encounter was a regular farce,
as far as good football goes, the ﬁnal tally being 64——o,
against the Southerners. Egbert, Dillon and Wagner
made touchdowns at will, the game assuming the aspect

..~..».w*" ‘ ‘G

 

of a track meet, rather than a football game, before the
ﬁnal whistle blew.

Washington & Jefferson Game

The I3—o defeat administered by \Vashington &

Jefferson College eleven was the ﬁrst set—back handed to -

Pitt by this institution during “Joe” Thompson's regime
as Coach at the University of Pittsburgh. But the result
of the game was nothing other than had been expected,
because, ﬁguring on pre—ga1ne dope, Pitt did not seem to
have the slightest chance to even hold VVashington & Jef-
ferson to a low score, as the Indians had defeated Pitt in
a 45—8 game, whereas \\’ashington & Jefferson had
played the Indians even, o—o.

The visitors presented a splendidly balanced team,
and it was only the great work of the Pitt linemen, with
\7\'agner’s tackling that held the score down to thirteen
points. “Hube” was all over the ﬁeld at the same time,
spoiling many of the opponents’ end runs. “Red”, Flem-
ing. Young, Goodwin and Springer played the best indi-
vidual football for V\'ashington & Jefferson.

Pennsylvania State College Game

The Penn State game was the most disastrous event
on the Pitt football card, the locals being defeated 38-0.
The Center County institution had the best team in her

253

hisory, while Pitt had one of her poorest, so the result
can easily be accounted for.

Fullback Mauthe, the State captain, tore through consis-
tently for good gains, and Quarterback Miller, and Very, the
end, made wide end runs, resulting in good gains, when-
ever they succeeded in eluding the ever—present “Hube”
\Vagner. H “Hube” also did a little “starring” by his suc-
cessful line—plunging. Schoff, at quarterback for Pitt,
showed rare ability as a “pivotal” man, and Dillon tore
off wide, productive end runs.

Only once did Pitt have a chance to score a touch-
down, this being when \\'agner was ﬁnally brought down,
after making a thrilling, 7.ig—zag run, in the latter stages
of the game. The whole team strove valiantly, but to no
avail, as they were confronted by an insurmountable prop-
osition. In connection with this overwhelming defeat, it
must be set forth, that the rooters gave an exhibition long
to be remembered by those unacquainted with the real
“Pitt” spirit. Headed l)y Cheer Leader “Dick” Johnson,
the rooters remained long after the close of the game cheer-
ing and re-cheering for their fallen warriors, leaving the
ﬁeld only after their vocal organs had given out.

Immediately aftr the big annual football banquet on
November 28, given by A. R. Hamilton, ’94, the election
for captain of this year’s team was held at the Hotel
Schenley. It resulted in a very close contest between
“Hube” \/Vagner and “Bill” Leahy. Both these men were
certainly deserving of the honor, but as only one could

possibly be chosen, after many ballots had been taken, it
was ﬁnally given to Wagner.

The election for coach was almost as spirited as the

election had been for the choice of a captain. The appoint-
ment was extended to J. M. Duff, the well—known ex-
Princeton guard, who was Walter Camp’s choice for
guard on his “mythical” All-American team, in 1911. Mr.
Duff was also Assistant Coach at Princton during the past
season. As. Mr. Duff’s assistant in the coaching depart-
ment will be “Nubs” Harlan, also an ex—Princeton half-
back, and Walter Camp’s selection as halfback on his All-
American team of 1907. Mr. Harlan is by no means a
newcomer in the coaching ranks as he coached the emin-
ently successful Princeton teams of 1908-1909, therefore,
should prove to be a peerless instructor for the Pitt back-
ﬁeld candidates.

It is thought on all sides that the appointment of
Messrs Duff and Harlan as coaches will prove to be a most
popular move, as former Coach Thompson’s time will be,

254

for the most part, occupied with his duties as State Sena-
tor, to which honorable ofﬁcei he has recently been elected
from Beaver. County, Pa. Mr. Thompson, however,
kindly consented to accept the chairmanship of the Advis-
ory Athletic Committee, therefore his usefulness in ath-
letic matters will not be entirely lost to the University.

The resignation of Laurence B." Hurst, ’o4, necessi-
tated the appointment of a new Graduate Manager of
Athletics. Mr. Karl E. Davis, ’Io was unanimously elected
as his successor. Mr. Davis is one of the most prominent
alumni of Pitt, and one who has always been interested in
the athletics of the university. As the following schedule will
show, Mr. Davis has arranged the most attractive gridiron
card ever arranged for a Blue and Gold football team, and
if this initial schedule can ‘be taken as a criterion, Pitt’s
future athletic success is assured.

The men to whom letters were granted in football
were; Captain Galvin, Leahy, Smith, Pratt, Hoag, Reese,
Egbert, Joyce, W'ard, Wagner, Corboy, Dillon, Schoff,
Shapira, Kernolian, J. Blair, McEllroy, Hockensmith a'nd

Connelly.

Commonwealth Courts, eighteen Trustees of Colleges, ﬁve College Presidents, thirteen Professors, three Moder-
ators of General ;\ssemblies, ﬁve Editors and two authors of wide reputation.

In 1845 the buildings were burned to the ground. A new home was erected in 1857 and the University began
a new era of usefulness to society. Dr. George \\’0ods was officially termed Chancellor of the University in 1858.
The institution advanced with rapid strides in the acquisition of material resources.

Dr. Henry M. McCracken succeeded Dr. ,\r\'oods in 1880. During his administration the institution was moved
to another location. In 1884 Dr. Milton B. Goff became Chancellor, and under his guidance several new build-
ings were erected on the Allegheny site.

The year 1885 was marked l)y the founding of the Law School. A little later the Engineering School was
started under Dean Carhart, a distinguished author of well-known works on Civil Engineering. In 1895 the
\’\'estern Pennsylvania Medical College was absorbed by the University, becoming its Medical School. About
the same time the Pittsburgh School of Pharmacy became a part of the University and shortly afterwards the
School of Dental Surgery was founded. The School of Mining Engineering was established by the State in 1897.
Post—graduate courses in the various branches were also organized.

Dr. Holland held the chancellorship wisely from 1890 to 1900. From 1900 to 1902 Dr. Brashear acted as
chancellor awaiting the election of a new man. That man was Dr. McCormick.

The choice of Dr. McCormick in 1902 marked the dawn of a new era in the life of the University. Among
the ﬁrst things Dr. McCormick accomplished was the re—organization of the faculty. The introduction of up-to-
the—minute systems of teaching and equipment followed. V\'ith this reform and many other improvements came a
great increase of the student body. —

Vi/hen the students numbered close to two thousand facilities were totally inadequate, and a new campus
and buildings were sought. Our present home was ﬁnally selected and a new group of buildings planned. In
1908 by special act of the legislature the name was changed to the “University of Pittsburgh.”

Now we may look at “Old Uni Hill” as she awaits in expectancy for the group to be completed, a model of
the Acropolis in Athens. As we ascend the hill along Grant Boulevard the college building is the ﬁrst to be met.
To the west turning 0H the boulevard into the serpentine driveway which winds up the hill, is the Engineering

Baseball

The team of 1912 was the ﬁrst baseball
team supported by the University for ﬁve years.
R. E. Grove was appointed manager, who got to
work on a late schedule. Thomas L. McCreery,
the old Pittsburgh “Pirate” and later, Brooklyn
outﬁelder, was secured as coach, and a more
popular or efficient man could not have been se-
cured, owing to his expert knowledge of the
ganie and also his capacity for good fellowship.
Every man worked his hardest for “Tom.”

It is surprising that the team performed as
well as they did, because it was handicapped
from the beginning by the lack of practice facil-
ities. The contractors failed to have Trees Sta-
dium completed in time for baseball workouts,
necessitating the holding of practice on all avail-
able ball parks, which were, indeed, few a11d
ordinary.

They practiced for one week under these
adverse conditions and then tackled the initial

game of the schedule, against Grove City, on April 20, at
Grove City, Pa. The result of this game was a welcome
surprise to the Pitt supporters. The game went eight inn-
ings to a tie, I—I, being called at the end of this time to
allow the Pitt team to catch a train. “Rernie” Cooper

259

twirled a beautiful game, his ﬁne pitching making the tie
score possible, and he is deserving of the lion’s share of
the praise.

On April 21, the varsity left on a week's trip through
West Virginia and Ohio. They met defeat at the hands

upon‘the acquisit-ion of these three men to the regular
lineu , a reaction set in, the other members of the crew
recovered their “land legs,” and from that time on played
real baseball. '

'Koenig, ’I2 was elected to the captaincy of the team, ‘

this all—important position having been unﬁlled up to this
time. It must have been “Boot’s” election to the position
that turned the tide, as the team promptly recorded vic-
tories over Franklin College, Bellefonte Academy, Car-
negie" Tech, and Juniata College. The players, therefore,
did not strike their true stride until the closing weeks of
the season. The last game was with the Alumni team at
Forbes Field, June 18. The Alumni landed the game

after ten innings of the most strenuous baseball, by a 9--7’

SCOI'€.

Robert Grove, ’I4,‘ was re—elected manager for the
present season, and has completed a very attractive
schedule, having games with such teams as University of
Michigan, Pennsylvania State College, Ohio Northern
University, Bucknell University, West Virginia Univer-
sity, and Washington & Jefferson College.

VV. J. Allen, ’I4, catcher on last year’s team, was
unanimously chosen captain of the 1913 team. Mays Ed-
mundson, ’I3, has been secured as coach for the squad,
and it looks as though the athletic authorities made a
“ten—strike” when'they chose such an able man. Mr. Ed-

mundson has long been known as one of the best coaches,

 

in the V\7estern Pennsylvania district, he having coached
the Pitt team, which, years back, gave Penn State the only
defeat she has ever suffered in a Commencement game.
As a professional player he is also widely and favorably
known.

Coach Edmundson has the battery candidates work-
ing out in the gymnasium at the present time, and from

the wealth of the material at hand, all signs point toward
a winning team in 1913.

The men receiving letters in baseball are as follows:

BASKET BALL TEAM

W. G. MACQUOWN
Manager

Basket Ball

Basketball enjoyed it’s usual successful season at Pitt.
But successful as the former seasons may have been, Cap-
tain Campbell’s team eclipsed their records, inasmuch as
it was not only the number of victories, but also the cal-
ibre of the teams which were defeated. The schedule,

’ arranged by Manager Macguown was the hardest, and

most attractive ever arranged for a Blue and Gold ﬂoor
team,

The season’s record was seventeen victories to seven
defeats. Of this number, more than half were played on
foreign ﬂoors, but the team performed just as creditably
abroad, as it did at home, winning two—thirds of it’s con-
flicts on these trips, and consequently establishing a ﬁne
reputation throughout the east.

The ‘season opened on December 27, with the Uni-
versity of Pennsylvania as the attraction at Trees Sta-
dium. Pitt won the game handily, 22——I8, although great-
ly outweighed by their rivals. This game was followed by
two more decisive victories, one over the VVestinghouse
Club team, at Wilkinsburg, Pa., and the other over Jun-
iata College, at Trees Stadium.

The ﬁrst defeat of the season was registered when

267

Penn State won a very close game, 3o—26. Next came
nine straight victories, and it was during this period that
the Pitt passers displayed the fastest ﬂoor work of the
entire season. On January 29, Geneva College opposed
Pitt at Beaver Falls, Pa., Pitt winning 3I—19. Bellefonte
Academy and Mt. Union College both met defeat at Pitts-
burg, 38—22, and 43——2I, respectively. '

On Sunday, February 2, the Varsity, under the lead-
ership of Coach Flint, departed on the annual eastern in-
vasion. The program called for six games on six con-
secutive days, against some of the fastest ﬂoor quintets in
the country. To say that the men played ﬁne basketball
is putting it too mildly. They outdid themselves and
really accomplished greater things than anyone had hoped
for. They opened hostilities by defeating Georgetown
University at \K/ashington, D. C., then on Tuesday, Feb-
ruary 4, won from Mt. St. Mary’s College, at Emmitts—
burg, Md. From Maryland the next jump was made to
Gettysburg, Pa. Here Gettysburg College bowed before
them, 27—II, and incidently, by this defeat, Pitt had ac-
complished something which other eastern institutions
had striven in vain to do for four years: they had defeated

Gettysburg on her home ﬂoor, and by a decisive score, too.
On Thursday, Pitt won from Frankiln and Marshall, at
Lancaster, Pa.

At Swarthmore, Pa., on Friday, Swarthmore College
met with the biggest surprise of her career. They had not,
up to this time, been defeated on the home ﬂoor for four
years, but the Pitt delegation seemed to take delight in
putting a crimp in four— year records, so they proceeded to
ruin this Swarthmore record. Pitt won by a 3I——25 score,
in an extra—period game; the greatest contest ever staged
on the eastern college's ﬂoor. On Saturday Pitt met the
lone defeat of the trip. The pace had been too strenuous,
and they were compelled to play this last game in the
afternoon, against Lehigh University, the latter team win-
ning. Upon the team’s return home, they were given a
great ovation at the Union Station, Pittsburgh, and a cel-
ebration was held in it’s honor, on the following day, at
Trees Stadium.

The ﬁrst home game after the successful eastern trip
was lost to VVestern Reserve University, by the exceed-

ingly close score of 23—22, and on February 20 occurred

the first game of the short trip through Central Pennsyl-
vania. Pitt defeated Bucknell on this occasion, 25——15.
Bellefonte Academy and Penn State both defeated Cap-
tain Campbell’s quintet by the respective scores of 35—3o
and 3I———2o. The University of Wooster lost to Pitt, 3o—
29, at the Pitt gymnasium. as did also V\/ashington Ea Jef-

268

ferson in a 32——19 set—to. The balance of the season was
uneventful, Pitt winning from \Vest Virginia \’\’esleyan,
Washington & Jeffersoii and the \Vestinghouse Club
teams, and were in turn defeated twice by Allegheny Col-
lege.

Throughout the entire season, Captain V\/alter Ca1np—
bell played a consistently ﬁne game at guard, being the
real mainstay in that position. “Johnny” Baker’s play-
ing at forward needs no comment at all, as he is recognized
as one of the most brilliant basketball performers who
has ever competed for Pitt. The other forward position
was ﬁlled by Frischman, Straw, Graham and Heiner.
Frischman, a midget in size, was a member of last year’s
grand team, but played even better during the season just
closed, caging many ﬁeld goals of the timely variety.
“Dick” Straw is a new man, coming from Purdue Univer-
sity, where he captained the Freshman team in 1911. He
gave a very good account of himself, at every opportunity,
and put Pitt in the running on different occasions by his
well—timed shots. He substituted at forward in nearly
every game, and was at his best in this position. “Chuck”
Reese met very few centers who were able to out—jump
him, besides making goals when they were most needed.
Ochenshirt played the same steady article of basketball
that he gave last year, sometimes at guard, and again at
center. Although slightly undersized for the latter posi-
tion, he was a tower of strength in either place.

Dr, Flint will, in all probability, be retained as coach, The following men received the “P” in basketball:
as it would be a difficult job to ﬁnd his equal in this ca— Captain Campbell, Baker, Reese, Straw, Frishman, Ochsen—
pacity, and it was largely through his efficient efforts that hirt, Graham. and Heiuer.

Pitt can point with pride to her basketball achievements.

March 9, marked the
initial competition of
the 19-12 season. “Jim"

was the star of the
meet, winning every

very well in this meet,

two ﬁrsts and several

Freshmen won the

forts of Boots, Matt Marshall, and Manos. The Sopho-

In the ﬁrst dual meet ever staged between Pitt and
\7Vashingt0n & Jefferson College, held at V\/ashington, Pa.,
on May II, Pitt defeated her ancient football rivals by
the score of 38—18. Out of fourteen events, Pitt captured
nine ﬁrsts, making a clean sweep in eight of these, namely.
the Ioo-yard dash, the 22o—yard dash, the half mile run,
the shot put, the pole vault, the hammer throw, the discus
toss, and the high jump.

The only close race of the afternoon was the quarter
mile run, which brought together Captain Bryson of Pitt,
and Brush of \\’ashington & Jefferson, Bryson winning a
very close race, in the good time of 52, 1-5 seconds.

Pitt entered a half dozen men in the Pennsylvania
Intercollegiate and Interscholastic Track and Field Meet,
on May 18, an(l succeeded in grabbing IO poi11ts. The
meet was wo11 by Penn State, with Pitt, Lafayette, Car-
lisle, Swarthmore, \V. and ]., Gettysburg, and Dickinson
also competing. Galvin won the shot put with a throw of
39 feet, 6 inches, Matt Marshall placed third in the half
mile run, Davis came in third in the 100 yard dash, and
Rosenthal got a fourth place in the 220 yard dash.

The big event of the track card was the 7th Annual
Intercollegiate and Interscholastic Track and Field Meet,
conducted by the University at Schenley Oval, on May
25. Pitt won the championship in the college class, her
nearest competitor being VV. & ]., whose athletes scored
39, 1-3 points, to Pitt’s 56, 1-3 points. VVestminster,
Grove City and Geneva ﬁnished in the order named. The

meet was a grand success, as this annual meet always is,
and was thoroughly enjoyed by the thousands of assembled
spectators. Everything was favorable to the meet, as the
track was fast, and the day an ideal one for such a meet.
In the inter—school competition, Kiskiminetas Springs
School won with 35 points, barely nosing out Pittsburgh
High School, the later gleaning 31, 1-2 points, East Lib-
erty Academy came in third, with 19 points. Next in line
came Johnstown High School, Lisbon High School, Se-
wickley High School, Cleveland Central High School,
VV. &  Academy, Greensburg High School, Shadyside
Academy, Allegheny High School, Beaver Falls High

School, and lastly, Grove City High School, W'i1kinsburg
High School and Rochester High School, with one point
each. 

As has been stated before, the Pitt men broke two
University records in this meet, the one—half mile record
falling when Matt Marshall won, and the relay team clip-
ping several seconds from the mile mark, the new time
being 3 minutes, 30, 3-5 seconds.

Pierce, of Grove City College, also broke the local
track record in the half—mile, doing the distance iii 4 min-
utes, 37 seconds.

Chalmers Hall, ’I3, was re—appointed manager for the
present season and has arranged a schedule which will
force the Pitt speeders to their utmost, in order to win.
Pitt should have the best track team in her history to up-
hold her honor in this lucrative schedule, as many prep
school stars entered school this year. Among these are:
Thomas, from Pittsburgh High School, who has won the
distance runs consistently‘ while in prep school; McDon-
ald, from Hawley Preparatory School, is also expected to
do great things on the cinder path, having a prep school
record of 10, 1-5 seconds in the century run, besides being
an exceptionally fast quarter miler; Schoff, the quarter-
back on the football team, has already shown his class.
In the Y. M. C. A. Athletic Carnival at the Exposition, on
the night of ‘February 22, he astonished everybody by
winning the 80 yard (handicap) dash, against Donald Lip—
pincott, the Olympic Champion. Later, in the same even-
ing, he won the quarter—mile run from a fast ﬁeld.

The men winning the “P” were: Mgr. Hall, Capt.
Bryson, Rosenthal, M. Marshall,  Marshall, Boots, Lins-
ley, Manos, Hise, McKinney, Galvin, Gehlert, Davis, Haz-
lett.

season opened. It was certainly an ill—timed accident, as
much had been expected from McEllroy. His place was
taken by Ebe, ’I5, T
who proved to be
a ﬁne substitute, and
won nearly all of
his matches.
Wilbert played
his usual steady
game throughout
the season, while
M a n a g e r Mac-

Krell, in almost
every contest, was
practically invin-

cible. Wright also
put up a brilliant
game during the

season, he being
elected manager
for the tennis season
of 1913.

The ﬁrst match
was w i t h Penn
State at State
College, Pa., on
May I. The Pitt racqueters won every match but one,

No news has ever gladdenedithe hearts of the tennis
enthusiasts at Pitt as much as the recent announcement to
the effect that Harry Seymour had been secured to act
in the capacity of coach for the present season. Mr. Sey-

285

mour is known far and wide as one of the best tennis play-
ers who has ever handled a racquet. He knows the game
from A to Z, but better still, he possesses the happy fac-
ulty of knowing how to impart that knowledge to others,
and consequently, Pitt should consider herself fortunate
in securing such a man to pilot her team through such a
hard schedule as mapped out for the season of 1913.. The
schedule, as announced by Manager A. P. VVright, is as
follows:

Swimming

The completion of Trees Gymnasium made possible
the addition of aquatics to the already long list of sport-
ing activities at Pitt. \Vm. H. Colbert, ’14, was selected
as the manager, and worked out a schedule on short no-
tice, showing triangular meets between Pitt, Princeton,
and Pittsburgh Athletic Association on March 24 a11d be-
tween Pitt, Cornell and Pittsburgh Athletic Association
on April 3. Both of these meets were held in the Pitts-
burgh Athletic Associatioifs pool, which is one of the
best equipped swimming pools in America.

This year’s Pitt team was organized in order to ﬁnd
likely material, rather than to compete. Mr. John I. Tay-
lor acted as coach for the team. The facilities for this
branch of sport are splendid, as the tank is one of the
ﬁnest in Western Pennsylvania, and with such an able
coach as Mr. Taylor, who is a real authority on swimming,
as well as in all other branches of athletics, Pitt should
present a ﬁrst class team next year.

The candidates have certainly shown the proper spirit
so far, and it looks as if Coach Taylor has uncovered
several stars. In the Middle Atlantic Swimming Champ-
ionships of the Amateur Athletic Union, held in the Pitts-
burgh Athletic Association tank, R. D. Linn, of the Den-

289

tal School, plunged for a distance of si_xty—seven ‘feet, ﬁn-
ishing second to J. G. Hay, the champion. Sweet, ’I6,
won second place in his trial heat in the 50 yard race, but
lost out in the ﬁnals. On every occasion, Bonine has also
given a good exhibition, being an exceptionally strong
swimmer.

Pitt did very well, considering the fact that this is‘
She came in third in ‘

her initial attempt in water sports.
both triangular meetings, but that fact is not held against
the team, as all three of Pitt’s opponents in these meets
can boast of some of the fastest swimmers in the land.
This is especially true of P. A. A., whose team won both
contests.

The University Cliampjonships were held on March
28, with contestants from all departments. Results:

50 yard race———Harry Bonine.
100 yard race—Arnold Sweet.
220 yard race——\/V. H. Hallocl<._
Plunge for Distance—R. D. Linn.

On February 14, an interscholastic meet was held at

 

Trees Gymnasium, under the auspices of the University.
All the high schools of the Pittsburgh district supporting
swimming teams were represented, including Allegheny
High School, Peabody High School, Sewickley High
School, Union High School, and Fifth Avenue High School.
It was marked by some very strenuous competition; to the
greater degree between Allegheny and Peabody High
Schools. Allegheny ﬁnally captured the high honor with
26 points, to Peabody's 24 points. It is proposed to make

a

Fencing

This year marked the ﬁrst season of intercollegiate
fencing for the Pitt foil team. VV. E. Gray, ]r., ’15, re-
ceived the appointment as manager. Professor Postgate,
who is Fencing Instructor at P. A. A., coached the candi-
dates. Most of the men were new at the game, conse-
quently he was confronted with a very hard task in getting
ready a team to represent Pitt in the Intercollegiate
Fencing League of America, to which association Pitt has
been admitted. The league comprises teams from the
largest universities in the east.

In the trials at Annapolis, Maryland, Pitt lost every
match, but this was due to the fact that the opponents
used the Italian style, which was new to our men. They
were given a place in the ﬁnals, to be held in New York

City, as a result of their showing.

This branch of sport is comparatively new at Pitt,
but judging by the added interest which is bei11g dis-
played, with the passing of a couple of seasons, Pitts-
burgh should rank with the best in the country.

depravations and debauchery brought discredit upon the
general fraternity system. Fraternities themselves added
to this discredit by deterioration chiefly along two general
lines. First, the enlargement of membership and disre-
gard for the purpose of the fraternity, which caused the
fraternity to degenerate into a mere eating and lodging
house. Second, the other extreme, in attempting to be

exclusive, fraternities have chosen men because of arti-

302

ﬁcial possessions rather than mental, moral or physical
qualities, resulting in a collection of unreal, snobbish lot
of men to whom brotherhood is but a high—sounding name,
and whose Greek letters are but symbols of mysticism,
snobbery, secrecy and nothing more. With opposition to
fraternities rampant in this country, these erring fraterni-
ties must correct their ways or they are doomed to fall
as surely as the useless class bands and inter—fraternity
secret societies have fallen.

The fraternity that distracts from the real work in a
ur1iversity,—mental and physical preparation for life’s
latter work,—through encouraging habits of idleness, in-
difference and immorality; the fraternity that makes class
attendance optional,——not imperative; the fraternity that
dissipates the energies of its men in senseless horseplay
and barbaric branding; the fraternity that overemphasizes
the importance of social events; the fraternity that bows
to the autocracy of athletics; the fraternity that affords
nothing but pleasure to its members; the fraternity that

excites nothing but envy and jealousy among the non- »

fraternity men; the fraternity that barters away the vote
of its members on the block of self return; the fraternity
that is so narrow as not to see and admit the good in other
fraternities; such a fraternity is the best argument against
the general fraternity system.

There never was a greater opportunity for Greek!
letter men to prove the worth of the system that is now

present in Pitt. Most of the fraternities are young and in-

ter-fraternity good—feeling is in its infancy. There is an
opportunity to welcome the increasing number of stray
Greeks, who, despite the fact that their fraternity does not
have a chapter here, are coming to dwell within our walls.
If good—feeling is to reign supreme among all Greeks, if
there is to be here a democracy that cares even for the
least among Pitt’s great student body, the 1914 OWL asks
you Greek men if it is not your duty to strive to bring it
to pass.

HEN the University moved its location from the
wilds of North Side to its present site on the
classical heights of Schenley Farms they built
, ; their buildings and laid the foundation of the
grander and greater University of Pittsburgh a11d gathered
the cream of 1909 Prep graduates and duly placed them in
this new environment, with the numerals 1913 to be
their heritage.

The novelty of their new habitation made the “Sophs”
put the easy pedal on the usual bunch of rough stuff. The
chief event of the early days was the informal pink tea
given around a 20 ft. pole on the top of Uni Hill, after
which the sophomores declared dividends derived from
selling the rag gathering privilege.

 

They were leaning o’er the rail,

They were looking very pale,

Were they looking for a whale,
Not at all.

It was I9I3’s slaughter,

Made them cast it on the water.

In a way they hadn’t oughter.
That was all.

History

The Sophomore and Junior years slipped by with the
ranks of nineteen thirteen constantly growing smaller but
the work of the class as a whole and its large number of
excellent individual students was above the standard. “Dea-
con” Smith and “Turtle” Brand, the two scientists of the
school can be heard any time every (lay philosophising on
the if—ness of nothing. Gibson knows “moah" about New
York and Monto Carlo than any two ordinary mortals.
It is rumored that he writes for magazines. Allison, the
college jester, is a veritable Abe Lincoln. Frishman is a
little Jewel at basket ball and, being too fast for the 1914
bunch, stepped up a year. So 011 ad inﬁnitum.

Our Senior year which is fast drawing to a close has
seen the bands of close fellowship and good spirit ever
tightening and holding us closer and closer to these things
which we all hold so dear.

I11 this, the closing lines, let us express a hope that
in after life, the memories of our college days at Pitt will
still hold us together in the same ﬁrm hands that has kept
us united from ’o9 to ’13.

Class Roll

JAMES LEWIS ALLISON, JR., EAE, Wilkinsburg.
Wilkinsburg High School. Class Treasurer, ’12.

Y. M. C. A. Classical Club.

An all around good scout. Comes to class once in a while. Knows
more about argument than Daniel Webster. May be seen in Y. M. C. A.
making a prayer, on the steps telling more stories than Abe Lincoln or
walking out Fifth Avenue with a Jane on his arm. Will be a lawyer.
Take care what you say to him, girls, he’s taken.

THURLOW WEED BRAND, AA. Pittsburgh, Pa.
Pittsburgh High School. Cap and Gown, 1911312-‘I3. Owl

Board, 1913.

“There’s always fair weather . . . . . . . . ..” A great artist. Prefers to
teach the Co-eds. Is strictly temperate. “Say, Deacon, how many cuts
has this fellow?” “Five?” “Make it two.” Turtle’s some shark in
French. He just dotes on it for several reasons (mostly feminine).

J. RUTH CARPENTER, Wilkinsburg.

Pittsburgh High School. President of Executive Committee of
Women's Students' Y. W. C. A.

Ruth is the guardian of our morals, a conservative of the most pro-
nounced type and is the brains of the Co-eds. We don’t know how she
stands on woman suffrage, but judge she’s on the right side.

CATHERINE THERESA CHARLETON, Washington, Pa.
Washington High School.

Chemicals and acids,

Smoke and water, too,
Cannot cause the fading

Of her cheeks’ bright hue.

WILLIAM JAMES CONNELLY, New Haven, Conn.

New Haven High School. Earlhan—Wabash College.
football, 1911, 1912. Track, 1912.
Few men combine the qualities of a student, a fusser, and a football
player. He is a good scout, but we are sorry 'he kicked over the tracks
and joined the senior class.

Class Football.

Varsity

JOSEPH D‘ALF.SSIO.
Lost somewhere in the intricate network of education.

PHIL YALE DANLEY.
Waynesburg College.

The Ex—shining Light at Waynesbiirg College. Asks Dr. Thorpe
questions that takes an hour to answer. Has not yet made Pitt students
appreciate his brainy qualities. Never mind, Phil, if Shakespeare, can’t
repeat. you can.

MORRIS FRISHMAN, Pittsburgh, Pa.

. Pittsburgh High School. Capt. Freshman Basket Ball, ’II. Var-

sity Basket Ball, ’i2, ‘I3.

Its just Frish’s luck to have to tackle a 2o0—pounder every game, but-

You oughta see,

You oughta see,

You oughta see the “Midget”
A-shovin him around.

Morris, old boy, is awfully “persnikity”. He made us wait 20 min«
Lites and answer more questions than a Civil Service Examiner before he
would consent to give us the above data about himself. Brought bacon
home from eastern trip.

HELEN FROST, Pittsburgh, Pa.
Pittsburgh High School. Pi Theta Nu Sorority. Y. W. C. A.
President.

Extremely interested in all religious movements. The Co—ed who
comes to school with “Mother".

W. I... GORDON GIBSON,
Charter House School. Junior Owl Board.

The man who went to New York to get some hair oil lest he should
lose his ﬂowing locks. Spends all his money on perfume and his mani-
curing bill. Knows more about styles than any tailor. Putting all fool-
ishness aside, however, you’ll go a long way before you ﬁnd a better scout
than Gibby and one who has more of that all necessary element we call
horse sense. A future Dr. Thorpe.

MABEL JACKSON, Wilkinsburg.
Greenville High School.

Halls of learning fade away

Latin, Greek, and French they say,
On the shelf are placed to stay
When Cupid comes your way.

MARY KATHERINE MULHEIM, West Bridgewater, Pa.
Beaver College. Y. W. C. A. Vice President Senior Girls.
An earnest adherent of pow-w'ow, but we promised not to mention it.
’Tis said she wears a diamond.

FRANK ALEXANDER MCDERMOT, Pittsburgh.
One of Silverman’s proteges. .

ROBERT H. WETTACH. 2AE- ,
Allegheny High School. Sophomore Literature Prize. Intercol-
legiate Debate, (2), (3). Athletic Committee, (4). Y. M. C. A. Cab-
inet, (4). President Intercollegiate Oratorical League, (3). Track,

(3). President of Student Senate, (4). Representative to Oratorical

contest at Hamilton, N. Y., (4).

His head contains that which the Almighty intended it to-—Brains.
Works all the time, takes everything serious but will laugh by the hour at
Harry Lauder’s songs. When it comes to making speeches, getting up
banquets, or presiding over the Student Senate he's strictly there. All the
Freshman think iae’s Prof, (he’d make a good one); likes girls, but bet-
ter yet. they like him.

HELEN SCHMIDT. Pittsburgh.
Bryn Mawr College.
A digniﬁed young lady from the East.

WILLIAM ROBERT SMALLS, A(I)A, Beaufort, S. C.
Armstrong Technical High School, Washington, D. C. Forensic
Society (1).
A sport. He surely must have hobnobbed with Congress when he was
in Washington. Future President of the Watermelon Trust. Nothing
small about him, though.

WILLIAM SMITH, (I)Z(I), Castle Shannon, Pa.
Student Senate '12-’13. Student Advisory Board.

Biggest man in Castle Shannon except Dean Fettermann. Great
roughneck. Is the Brains of the Advisory Board and the paternal advisor
of the Co-eds and Freshmen. Better known as “Deacon”, “Whiskey” or
,“Uncle Willie”. For all this he’s one of the kind that will bear mighty
close inspection. The better you know him, the better you like him.

LAWRENCE L. STEPP. Glade Mills. Pa.
Grove City College, ’12.

This is the lad with the rosy cheeks and the raven hair. Perfect im-
age of “der Kaiser", bless his dear heart. Don’t ask him why he left
Grove City, That’s a bloody and mysterious affair. Never talks to the
ladies. When you want a drinking-cup, see Stepp.

S. ELIZABETH MCWILLIAMS, Allegheny. -
Allegheny High School. Le Cercle Francais, President.
Quiet demure little lass of Pitt,
She sure will be a credit to it.

DAVID DOUGLAS PORTER, Pittsburgh, Pa.
Allegheny High School. Westminster
Debate, 1913.
“Be it ever so humble,
There’s no place like home.”
When Porter is debating, this applies especially. Is on Kitty’s black
list. In fact. Porter is becoming more like a low brow Economic or a
rough neck Engineer rather than a gentleman of the College. Neverthe-
less, he is the delight of dear old Scriby’s heart.

Never in»the history of the U1ii\'ei‘sity has it been
represented by as large a11d loyal an organization as that
of the 1912-1913 .\lusical Clubs, which enjoy the destine-
tion of being the best and most successful clubs since their
organization was effected way back in the days of \\’. U.
P. The success of the clubs this year has been due to the
loyalty of the members to the Gold and Blue.

Opening the concert season with the Pitt—State joint
concert Tliaiil<sgi\'iiig‘ night, in Carnegie Music Hall, the
clubs were given a royal reception by a large audience.

The reception and dance held in the Schenley ball

greatly to the social entertainment. Many alumni of both
institutions attended the dance, which was one of Pitt’s
brightest functions during the school year.

The Musical Clubs_were greeted by large audiences
in every city in which they appeared this season. In many
instances the Pitt men were entertained with receptions
and dances following lhe presentations of the entertain-
ments especially among the high school folks of the var-
ious cities.

The Pitt program was composed of varied Mandolin
and Glee Club numbers, with vocal and instrumental

solos added. Andrew R. Cancelliere of the Medical
School, accompanied the clubs in several concerts
as soloist. His work adds a distinction to the Pitt

program, as no other college or university musical clubs
have a song soloist of true work as is Mr. Cancelliere.
Another soloist is A. H. Bennett, of the Economics School,
who held his audiences under the spell of his little violin.
Mr. Bennett plays the more difﬁcult selections in easy
and pleasing fashion.

' following officers:

The Glee Club under the direction of Henry T. Ashe,
of Uniontown, Pitt alumnus, was brought out to its
best. Mr. Ashe, who has been in music up to his ears
for a number of years, and a member of the Pittsburgh
Male Chorus for several seasons, added many touches of
humor to the Pitt Gleemen in his direction of the club.
The Mandolin Club, under the leadership of F. A, Frank-
lin, an Engineer, is the largest and best instrumental club
that has ever represented Pitt. Mr. Franklin was a very
capable leader, and his work as leader of the Pitt instru-
mental clubs is deserving great credit.

The 1912-1913 Musical Clubs were represented by the
President, Bert Humphries, Law
School; Vice President, H. H. Birmingham, Law School:
Secretary. E. O. Hobbs, Evening School; Treasurer, ].
J. Bane, Economics; Manager, W’. Don Hise, Law Schocl.

Y. M. C. A.

The Pitt Y. M. C .A. has had a great year. W’ hen one
stops to think about it, the association proposition is every
thing else but an easy one. A student may look upon the work
connected with such student activities as the “Pitt V\/eekly”,
“Cap & Gown", Base—Ball, etc., as presenting a rather difficult
aspect; but the Y. M, C. A, effort meets with as many if not
more discouragements than any of the student endeavors.

Three" handicaps stand in the way of more efficient work
among the students. In the ﬁrst place, the lack of dormitories

‘makes it difﬁcult for the students to meet in any one place,

where such as Bible Study groups, or Mission Study classes
could be very effectively held.

The fact that students are only given one hour a week
that they can call their own, puts a limitation upon any possible
extra session which might be deemed advisable for the for-
warding of the work.

Lastly, the lack of a resident student Secretary can be
looked upon as a very great impediment. Those who had the
work at heart, although they were loyal, yet were limited by
the amount of time necessary to attend to their studies. VVith
a student secretary. a man who would devote all of his time
and energy to the Association, the results can be estimated by
any average student, even tho‘ he be “less than a prophet”.

377

But in keeping with the first line of this contribution to
Pitt's greatest Year Book, it is well to e‘numerate'son1e of the
achievements of the Association, inthis, its most gratifying
year. i

In December, 1912, one month after the Association was
organized, the ﬁrst membership campaign was conducted‘ and
the number of members enlisted was 40. In the first part of
March, 1913, the second campaign increased the roll to I2 5.
These are phenomenal ﬁgures considering the fact that the Y.
M. C. A. was dead and buried before the revived Spirit began
to work last November.

The Monday morning meetings have in every way been
exceedingly helpful and inspiring. The value of true, honest
Christian living has always been held up before the student by
the many speakers who have addressed the Association.

The importance of sociability and fellowship has in no
way been overlooked. One of the most helpful events in the
annals of the University was the Reception given to the new
members of the Y. M. C. A. just after the second membership
campaign. The true College Spirit that should always per-
meate the activities of the students was very notable on this
occasion. The Association here rendered a great service to the
University.

Junior

_ HE Class of 1914 have reached the third rung of
‘ the ladder of success. One more rung and
then—the jumping off place. Some of our
noble bunch are already prepared to jump, but
’tis well known that hot air rises more quickly than the
cool variety.

VVe’re here——why? The Seniors say because they
showed us the way; the Sophs say they boosted us; the
Fresh say we derived inspiration from the green; but we
say we’re here because you can’t keep good men down.
The Class of ’I3 did its best, the faculty tried hard but they
couldn’t down us.

As we look backward we see our pathway strewn with
victories and broken hats and beautifully ﬂounced Fresh-
ies, etc. VVe pause on viewing one scene. VVe see a short,
heavy—set man busily engaged in jerking Sophs away from
Freshies in the basement of State Hall. We boast with
pride that we are the only class that required that dis-
tinguished gentleman to quell its glowing spirits.

We have read somewhere that many are called but
few are chosen. So it has been with us. Many started
with us to climb the ladder. Some waited for the eleva-

 

History

27

tor and were left behind. Some tried to ride, but few horses
can climb. Some have risen by hanging onto coat tails,
so to speak, while others found the climbing too strenuous
and took the course of least resistance, via Economics.
However, what we mean to say is that what is left of us
is here and we're satisﬁed because we learned that the
best lasts the longest and we’re pretty good stickers.

Every ter1n’s end the faculty tries to make our path
more difficult by smearing grease on the rungs. But little
we care—we’re strong on sand and we’ve got our eye on
that fourth rung.

When we get to that jumping off place, instead of
jumping off into obscurity and oblivion, as former classes
have done, we will just let loose our little aeroplane and
sail right over to the “heights of fame.”

We have often thought, but our modesty never before
allowed us to speak, of what would happen to Pitt if the
Class of ’I4 should all suddenly leave our Alma Mater.
The Y. M. C. A. would be a ghastly wreck. The Student
Senate would b: feebleminded. The Pitt Weekly would be
in smithereens and the Y. W. C. A. in despair. The foot-
ball, basket ball, baseball, swimming, wrestling and track teams

The work of the Social Service Committee is worthy of
especial mention because of its practical achievements. As
many as 10 members found places for deﬁnite social service in
the various settlement houses of Pittsburgh. Free dental aid
from the School of Dentistry was obtained for the Soho Set-
tlement House—a service which involves a consideration of
$600.00 yearly. Earnest endeavor crowned the work of this
committee with success.

In the Mission Study class the subject of the Chinese
Revolution was carefully investigated, the text being “The
Chinese Revolution”, by Browri. These studies were of tre-
mendous proﬁt to those interested, both from a religious and
educational standpoint.

The future of the Y. M. C. A. at old “Uni” seems bright.
New blood will come into the association and a greater ﬁeld
will encourage more earnest and conscientious effort on the

378

part of the old members, and with the additional aid of a resi-
dent secretary and a permanent Association Headquarters, no
one could speak pessimistically about the work next year.

In closing this brief account it is well to realize that the
difﬁcult task successfully performed by a few devoted fol-
lowers of the great cause of the Young Men's Christian Asso-
ciation within the walls of Pitt, stands out as a challenge to
those who are to resume the responsibilities next year. Every
hearty wish and strong hope is extended to the ofﬁcers for
1913-14. May you dedicate your prayers, time and energy to
the work to such an extent that in the future the Association
will be a potent factor in the moulding of student life. May it
soon be said that the Y. M. C. A. of the University of Pitts-
burgh, is on a par with the associations of the other colleges
and universities of our land.

Y. W. C. A.

The Young \/Vomenis Christian Association of the
University was organized in May, 1910, with about ﬁfteen
members. Since then the work has been growing slowly,
but surely, and it is hoped that very soon the Association
may take its proper place among the activities of the
University.

There are forty-ﬁve members this year, almost twice
as many as there were last year, which in itself is a cause
It is evident also that there is more real
interest in the work of the Association than ever before.

Meetings of various kinds have been held weekly.
Besides those of a purely devotional character, meetings
have been held in the interest of home and foreign mis-
sions, and social service. One mission study class has
studied the book, “The Conservation of our National
ideals.” Besides these meetings of a serious nature, ﬁve
socials have been held since September.

At Christmas time gifts were sent to the girls at the
Pittsburgh Home for Girls. This, together with some

381

settlement work done" by individual members, comprises
the social service work of the organization.

The Association was represented at theisummer con-
ference at Eagles Mere, Pa., by three delegates, ’and'by
the same number at the Student Volunteer Conference at
Westminster College in November. In February the
members were joint hostesses with the girls of the Penn-
sylvania College for V\"omen, for the Sectional Student
Council of the Young VVomen’s Christian Association.

The money needed for the work of the Association,
outside of what was received for dues, was made at
counter lunches and candy sales. These were so successful
last year that the same plan is to be followed this year.

VVhen the work of the Association here is compared
with that of others in similar institutions it seems small,
but it is the hope of all those interested that it may be
the foundation of more extensive work and greater
achievements.

.1. 7716 Pitt ‘Weekly

BOUT three years ago an ambitious individual, by
name Frank C. Stewart, conceived the idea that it
would be altogether ﬁtting and proper for a week-
ly newspaper to supplant the monthly magazine
publication of the University, the Courant. And

thus it came about that this great man founded the greatest

paper in the history of newspaperdom, The Pitt VVeekly.
Since that time the Pitt VVeekly has been running full
blast; part of the time running in debt; part of the time run-
ning from its creditors; part of the time running on schedule
time, like a good newspaper; part of the time running behind
time, like a B. & 0. limited; but under all circumstances it has
been mmnmg. That is the signiﬁcant factor of this paragraph.
When Frank C. Stewart’s term as editor expired, the
sceptre passed to Ralph George, than whom no more ambitious
youth hath ever lived, bar none,—not even Caesar. Ye Gods!
had George lived in the time of Ceasar, Brutus would never
have given Caesar a second thought. For one whole year the
paper fairly snapped and crackled, so full was it of the spirit
of the editor. No man, from Chancellor McCormick to the

janitor, was ever spared in an editorial, if the editor decreed a

certain individual deserved some publicity. And how the

“cubs” did work when George was boss. From the time that

 

382

the reporter entered the sacred ofﬁce of the mighty editor until
he ﬁnished his last assignment, he was conscious of the fact
that the greatest newspaper man since the days of H. Greeley
was watching his every movement, and many a poor “cub" got
an awful call for pulling some “ivory” stunt. But, after all,
George was a real editor and his good work shall ever stand a
monument to his name in the history of Pitt.

From George, the royal crown of editor passed to the
writer of this article, who had served his time under the old
regime’, starting out as the greenest of green “cubs”. The less
we say of his reign the better. W’ e shall lower him into the
grave of oblivion with the simple statement “He also was a
king for a day, but now his throne is held by another and his
crown is resting on another’s head. VVe are here to bury him,
and not to tell how rotten he was.

As this article is being prepared for the OWL,  P. Harvey
has but recently been installed as the fourth editor of “The
Pitt Weekly”, and “may God have mercy on his soul”. The
writer wishes him all luck and success. He believes him to
have the right spirit, the spirit which will enable him to make
the paper better and larger than ever before. He has advan-
tage of being the fourth editor, and can, therefore, proﬁt by
the experiences of the three men who have gone before.

But, after all, the Pitt VVeekly has much to be proud of.
The paper has improved in style and in the character of news
from year to year, and each new year should bring a better
paper. There is more interest taken in the paper now than
ever before, it has an advisory board composed of business
men, who freely give good advice to the editors and managers.
The old debts of the ﬁrst two years are to be taken care of, the
paper expects to have no deﬁcit this year and every stuff from
now on should make money, thanks to the persistent demands

by the advisory board for a business—like handling of The
Weekly funds. What brighter prospect could be wished?

It is only a question of a year or two until The V\/eekly
must go by the boards, as did the Courant, and a daily take its
place, leaving the VVeekly publication to the Alumni. It is in-
evitable—with Pitt growing as she is—a daily paper must
come. Run the Weekly two years on a paying basis—the third

year you will have a daily.

Debate

Because Pitt lost the best debating coach she ever had,
who was one of the best in the country, because no varsity de-
baters competed for places on the team, because the new
coaches were handicapped, our debating team fell down.

But all credit to the men on the team! Credit to those

Freshmen! Credit to them all, because the ﬁrst question we
ask of a team is not “Did you win ?”, but “Did you ﬁght ?”

Our boys fought, fought hard and lost; but they fought
that’s what counts, and therefore we are proud of our debat-
ing teams.

agree with Pittsburgh’s ablest critics that “The Prince of
Shani” given this year by the Cap and Gown Club was
the best college play that has visited our city. The music

lines, with their accompanying “business” were ably car-
ried by the players. The “chorus girls” seemed genuine

can not be given to this year's Cap and Gown perform-

on and mention such things for hours but why frighten
our readers this way for we expect to stay a while longer.
The faculty like us so well they just simply won’t let us
go yet. “Kitty” would probably be the only one to rejoice
at our leaving, for there would be no more concerts in the
halls of “Old State” or riots in the library.

After briefly mentioning all these things is it any
wonder that our history is solemn and digniﬁed. VVe are
setting a most worthy example to the underclassmen who
are earnestly striving to attain the standards we have

set for them.

anything worthy of note.

Many have believed the Senate has never done
But, while the Senate has never
felt that it must be turning things upside down, merely
for the sake of doing something, it has nevertheless dealt
with many of our student problems, and dealt with them
fearlessly and with a fair degree of wisdom and common
sense.

Since its organization it has taken charge of the
Freshman—Sophomore exercises and in place of the dan-
gerous, illegal, unregulated, retaliatory hazing and guerilla
warfare in which the two lower classes have been accustomed
to indulge, we now have a legal, open and above—board
clean ﬁght in which they settle all grievances in one beau-
tiful battle on class day.

Senate

It has instituted the honor system which has not
been in operation long enough to brand it as a failure or
to call it a success.

It has put an end to the scheduling of noon—hour
classes, which if nothing else justiﬁes its existence.

It has managed the social life of the University in an
admirable fashion.

It has handled the Pitt V\’eekly debt, the payment of
which will stand as a monument to the Senate forever.

VVith these tangible results already achieved and
standing as it does face to face with many more problems
of equal importance in different stages of solution, the
Senate bids fair to increase in usefulness and inﬂuence in
the years to come.

THE COMMON CAUSE

Some are bound for professions esthetic,

Some hunger for labors prosthetic,

Some favor the lancet and others the transit,
VVhile some sigh for laurels mimetic,

A few prefer preaching and many like teaching,
Scores more would be captains ﬁnancial

Some druggists, some miners, some penny—a—liners,
Some lawyers or bankers substantial;

But all have one common ambition,

One ﬁeld for their might and their wit,

A passion consuming to ever keep booming

Our glorious varsity, Pitt. B ’o9

however, for the “whirl of society”. But since this is a common charac-

HUMAN NATURE.

The oldest course in the curriculum. The
aim is individual development. During the
present term, 2, 500 undergraduate tutors and
150 members of the faculty will give instruc-
tion daily. Individual lectures are given, but
care should be taken in the selection of the in-
str11ctor. Although no credits are given for
this course, any student who fails to pursue it
leaves the University without taking advan-
tage of the best course it offers.

FUSSING.

An interesting course consisting largely
of individual experimental work. Open to all
students, only qualiﬁcation is to be “\Villun".
Field trips may be taken any night, but
V\/ednesday and Sunday are usually selected
Other hours may be arranged by appointment.

The Pard for Pitt

The Navy cheers the William Goat,

The Army loves the Mule,

The Bulldog symbolizes Eli’s grit,
Nassau is for the Tiger,

California lauds the Bear,

But the Panther is the bully beast at Pitt.

Chorus—Ee—yah! Ee—yah!

You’d best beware the, Panther and his team
He’s our fearless ﬁghting Pard,

So you’d better be on guard,

If your hostile, when you hear the Panther scream,
Ee—yah!

You’ll be (lone for when you hear the Panther scream.

Lithe and clever he comes bounding to the fray,
Mix your valor with discretion,

If you’d still be in possession, -

The Avalentine Party of
February 13th, 1913 ~

The 13th can't be lucky for everybody so the Economics and Engi-
neering Students wandered around the campus as though they had been
shot at and hit when they discovered that the College fellows only had
been invited to a co—ed party. The Bishopites swore and cussed the
co—educational system and the loyal Sons of “Square—Deal” Holdsworth
declared their Dean still lovedythem even if they didn't get a bid. Just
think of two hundred co—eds all “dolled" out in their Sunday “duds”,
and each making herself a hostess to the lucky College Students. Then,

too, Dean Fetterman made a speech, and granted a license to dance
anything the floor would support. All the games in the book were
played and worst of all for the absentees and best of all for those pres-
ent “eats”A were announced. It was some party and it was the biggest
co—ed affair of the year, even if, (or because), the Roughneck Engi-
neers and Gentlemen Economics were conspicuous by their enforced
absence.

That Committee

The Committee, composed of Chairman “Monk" Long. “Spot" Harris,
“Bill” Markell, and “Yegg” Wolff, was appointed by Aescalapious, the
father of medicine, to see that the Class of 1914 of the University of Pitts-
burgh Medical School remained in the straight and narrow path. Their
methods are not the smooth and persuasive ones of the Mexican Athlete,
but rather those of the “Big Stick” and “Steam Roller”. How well they
have succeeded is shown by the peace and tranquility which permeates the
Medical School when the Juniors have an idle hour. (For corroboration,
see Miss Poole.) The Committee has advanced the science of medicine
by the introduction of the “Boring Reﬂex”, “Flick Percussion”, “Forehead
Smack” and many others which they have practiced with much gusto. They
have never failed to coin new words and phrases as the occasion demanded
and their markmanship is a thing of beauty and a joy forever, as their
many victims will sorrowfully affirm. However, _their chief claim to fame
necessarily rests on their beautiful rendition of the pathetic little ballad,
entitled “What does the Committee Say?”

JAMES C. CUTHBERT, 2 AF‘, Freeport, Pa.
Freeport High School. Allegheny College. Owl Board.

One of your shy chaps. Never misses chapel or Berger’s Choir. Jim
has a great desire to be an actor. Can eat more ice cream than any three
C0-eds in school. He doesn’t know a girl at Pitt, but he knew one up at
Allegheny wunst. The girls don’t know what a ﬁne fellow he is or he
wouldn’t be so lonesome. We fear Ed. Coen will have to take a back seat
when the Co-eds discover him.

JOHN W. CUMMINS, AA.
Alpha, Alpha. Fresh Football Team. Fresh Wrestling Team.
Varsity Football, 1911. President of 1914 Class, (I), (2). Manager
of University Book Store, (3).
When John came to Pitt it was diﬂicult to distinguish whether he was
a dentist or a traveling salesman. Those gold teeth were the sort that
excite the admiration of every man or woman. However, he has piloted
the class over the ﬁrst two years of college life and has led them like a
general. His one weak point is work. He can’t be happy without doing
things, accordingly he gravitated to the Book Store managership. The
class owes much of its good start to John who is a necessary asset to more
than one college activity.

EDWARD E. COEN, Homestead, Pa.

Homestead High School. Y. M. C. A. Chapel Choir. Classical
Club.

The Kaiser's right’ hand man. Has an inordinate desire to form male
quartets. Has gained everlasting fame and not a little popularity by defy-
ing the “power that would be" in the library. Dropped Latin, because the
transportation facilities gave out. He claims he was an honor student in
prep school, but we are from Missouri.

WILLIAM H. CRAIG. (I)'/,(I), Castle Shannon. Pa.
Union High. Knoxville. Pa.

“Bill” loves to talk. Kitty ejects him from the library every other
day :—causa loquendi cum femim's. Has Bacon, Kant, Shakespeare, and
the other high brows beaten to a frazzle. “Say, Professor, I don’t agree
with Shakespeare in his conception, . . . . ..etc.” Do you get us? “Bill”
is the greatest fusser in school, excepting P. D. Bier However, “A man’s
a man for a’ that”, as Homer used to say.

FRESHMEN HAVE THEIR PICTURE TAKEN A LA FLOUR

Poem School of Education

Oh, the School of Education

Has a ﬁne administration

For the best profs of the nation,
Dwell within its sacred walls.

VVhen you come for registration,

You will meet the whole legation,

And with them hold consultation
In the lecture rooms and halls.

Do not stop to ask a question,

Go to Sies if you’re a Freshman,

You can tell him by the color
Of the visor which he wears.

But if “S0ph” your title’s reading,

Then the man you will be needing,

You will always ﬁnd by leading
To the library upstairs.

Henry Sheldon is his name, sir,

I am sure you’ve heard his fame, for

All the student’s say he’s hard, or
That he rushes them too fast.

Yet withal there’s not a kinder,

More magnanimous, reﬁned, nor

Quicker, wittier of mind, sir,
Than the one your lot has cast.

If a Junior by the next year,

You will meet another “Monsieur,”

Who will frighten but is sincere,

 

You will stop, and look, and listen,
And your eyes will glare and glisten,
For you do not like the gist in
VVho your ancestors might be.
If you wish to study nature,
Randall, loftiest in stature,
Bids you get your hoe and spade, sir,
Clear your garden and dig in.
But if art is more alluring,
You will do well by securing
Mr. Kniffen, the enduring,
Patient teacher, full of vim.
Then you’ll ﬁnd among electives,
“Backward Children and Defectives,”
Courses taught by a selective,
Earnest, and hard-working man.
If you wish to work intensely,
And to read, and read immensely,
Think you’re clear, yet see things densely,
Take these quickly as you can.
Household arts, domestic science,
With attention and appliance
Teaches one of whose reliance
You have heard, Miss M. MacLean.
Then “Primary Methods” et al,
Taught by Mrs. H. G. Carmalt,
Is a good course and without fault,

And more practical is none.
You’re improved by his inspiration,
And he'll ﬁt you for election,
For he is all but perfection,
Doctor C. B. Robertson.
At ten-thirty every Wednesday,
You will all meet for Assembly.
Among others it is likely
That Dean Chambers you will see.

410

If you take it you are sane.
Go to east, or go to west, sir,
School of Education’s best for,
One who wishes to be teacher,
That is absolutely true.
If for this you are not pining.
As a teacher to be shining,
“Go the path your heart’s inclining,”
Is advice for me and you.

A Tale of T011

Now. this is the tale of What’shisname,
Who entered Youknow College,

Determined to scale the heights of fame.
By the short-cut paths of knowledge.

This thing I boldly submit to you,
Was a highly ladable thing to do.

He looked the catalogue through and through,
And seemed to be quite dejected,

When the dean informed him, he C0uldn’t do
A half of the work elected.

And that remark you’ll agree, I ween,
Was a sapient one on. the part of the dean.

Said the fresh to himself, I'm a glutton for toil,
In leisure I ﬁnd no enioyment.

So the plans of the tempter I’ll cleverly foil,
By looking for extra employment.

Now you’ll admit it’s certainly true,
The devil ﬁnds tasks for the idle to do.

A Tale of Toil

Continued

So he joined a frat and a club or two,
And eke the Y. M. C. A..

And he tried for all of the teams, for he knew,
He had hours to squander away.

His college spirit, you must confess,
Was quite deserving of huge success.

He sang with the Glees, went to co—ed teas,
And posed as a social lion.

He loved and courted an auburn cheese,
Whose name was Patricia O’Brien.

You must concede that the choice of hair
Was manifestly his own affair.

A year went by—years usually do,
Each day brought new occupations,

And he wondered why other folks seemed so blue
On the eve of examinations.

Our tale here comes to a sudden close,

He flmzleed ’em all and now he knows. B’

MARY S. COLEMAN, Allegheny.
Allegheny High School. Girl’s Senate. Berger’s Choir.

One of our few students who is qualiﬁed to discuss co—education. You
see Mary has been to Maggie Morrison for one term, but absence from all
little impromptu tete—a—tetes, shy glances, etc., has caused her to renounce
domestic science, become a suffragette, and return to Pitt. She is a shark
at History, especially dates. She loves her professors, has been known
to give long dissertations on the “Relative Merits of Studying”, is never
late and a model in all respects. A winning smile and winning ways, for
more. see Mac.

JOHN H. ECKLES, A(I)A, Pittsburgh, Pa.
Allegheny High School.

The boy with the smile that won’t come off. He polishes it up each
morning with Sapolio. When he walks he bobs up and down as if he were
on springs. Eckles has a beautiful tenor voice. He expects to form a
company to tour America and Europe in the near future. A third Wash-
ington.

ARTHUR M. GROSSMAN. Homestead, Pa.
Homestead High School. Grove City.

A bright man, but like all men of genius has his faults. First he lives
in Homestead; second has a face that would sour vinegar. Some one said
his looks ﬂatter him. He believes in the motto, “The Lord Helps Them
Who Help Themselves”, and has the degree D. F., (dandy fellow). We
hope he’ll improve with time. Don’t judge a man by his looks, but by
what he does—that’s why we refrain from passing judgment upon him.

“Peggy" is one of those fellows who likes to “cut up”. He is taking a
six year medical course and the way he is “cutting up” at the Medical
School is gaining him world wide distinction. “Peg” is one of the lumin-
aries of Pitt in baseball. Although not playing on the Varsity he was
the successful pilot of the “Dissecting Room Reserves” during the past
season.

THAT ANNUAL JCR/\P

DI§E—T3AiI‘i T

Three Types

THE GRIND

Here we have a genus of the University Man, who has
taken his four years too seriously. Oil went to $3.00 because
of the midnight grinding. T wenty—four hours daily he spent
over his texts. He sought no friends and made none. To
himself alone he lived. Student activities did not interest him.
If W. & J. had a football team, it was not to his best knowl-
edge and belief. He had never talked five minutes with a Fra-
ternity—Man, much less had he Visited a House, but he knew
very well that “Frats” were “cliques” of the idle-rich, who
branded initiates and started them on the run to ruin. He
graduated and each two years following, two or three "letters
were added as titles to his name. He gathered a head full of
knowledge, harmed no one and died.

THE SPORT

Here we have the color maze of fashions. VVith four
“F5”, and two “D’s” on his report he loudly proclaims to all
listeners or otherwise that teXt—books are sold to raise money

for the University; that “booze” was made for him to con— .

sume during his four years’ loaf on dad’s “Change” and that
he was “soused right last night”; that the new cigarettes are
doped; that he didn’t join a “Frat” because he wouldn’t hang

420

around any bunch and let them “look him over", or his “Frat”
had seven cases of “Cooks Imperial” last night meeting. He
knows a red light is a danger sign, but he doesn’t care. Foot-
ball games are held to "give him an opportunity to display his
tai1or’s latest freakiest creation. His joy-ride on the good ship
earth was short, he harmed himself, smoked a million
cigarettes, ate a wagon load of pretzels to make him thirsty
for the young brewery’s output which he consumed, he
traveled the fast road, broke down, and coughed himself into
eternity.

THE MAN

Here is the University—Man. He loved his Alma Mater.
In Money, Time, and Pleasure he gave up to see her advance.
He was here for business, but he “cut” when “cutting” was in
order. He believed in student activities and supported them;
rooted for the teams because they stood for clean sportsman-
ship and represented his university. Because he saw the Greek
men were usually the men who did things in the university he
stood by Fraternities. He graduated a P‘itt—man and remained
a PTitt—man, he worked for the interests of Pitt and prospered
himself. And his fellowmen in the circle in which he moved
mourned the death of the University—Man.

 

 

G. M. P. B.
Pitfs Promising Poet

PRESIDENT ToM HARTON
At Work

“KEGGY”
Pitt’s Greatest Editor

By a Pittsburgh Man on the Event of Our 126th Birthday

Hurrah for the coming of Charter Day!
Hurrah, for the U. of P.!

Proud of its long scholastic sway
And its steady advance are we. ,

Founded by solid old pioneers,
To its place up front it sticks

’Mid the veteran schools, for 10 its years
Are a hundred and twenty-six.

Though it cuts today a broader swath
Than many an older fane

Of knowledge, it traveled a hard, hard path,
’Ere its goal it could attain.

For the coin wasyshort and our forbears thought,
In their queer, hard—headed way,

That scholastic eminence should be sought

With never a cent to pay.

So under a burden hard to bear
The ﬁne old school began;

But hopeful signs were in the air
And hence for a goodly span

Of years in primitive style it moved
Along. It had no strings

To pull, but fairly and squarely proved
Its title to better things.

And better things came, for Father Pitt

Could not look on and feel

That it wasn’t his place to help a bit
And for knowledge to show his zeal;

And a wallet was opened here and there
And the state at last chipped in

Till the gallant old U. began for fair
Its uphill ﬁght to win.

Behold it now with its schools diverse
And its student body vast.

With nothing to fear from poverty’s curse,
’Tis on solid ground at last;

And its fame keeps spreading far and wide,
And seeing its high renown,

Pa Pitt feels thoroughly gloriﬁed
As lord of a college town.

Then hasten to pass the loving cup
And to join in festive song.

Come, townsmen all, let us whoop’er up
And help the feast along. i

Let town and gown in a loyal way
Forever united be.

Hurrah for the coming of Charter Day!
Hurrah for the U. of P.!

Every Student

Everystudent sets out on his search for Knowledge ac-
companied by two companions, 'S»elf—Conﬁdence and Inno-
cence. Self—Conﬁdence is his chief help. As long as he has
Self—Conﬁdence with him he will ﬁnd anything he sets out for.
Innocence is a good friend at the ﬁrst of the journey, but if he
stays too long he may become a drawback.

\Vhen Everystudent arrives at the University, which is
his ﬁeld for the search, he is met by the Sophomore reception
committee. They greet him enthusiastically, but they laugh at
Self-Conﬁdence they do not like, and
they are continually plotting to get him out of the way. The
committee then conduct Everystudent to what they call the
“class in. landscape gardening". He is told to get a pick and
shovel and begin his ﬁrst lesson. He joins the class which has
already started to work.

his friend Innocence.

“But We haven't registered for this class". Protested
Innocence. “I thought we only had to take what we were
registered for”.

This seems to amuse the Sophomores for they laugh I

heartily. Self—Conﬁdenc‘e immediately bristles up.

424

“We're not going to take anything unless it’s absolutely
necessary”, he says. “VVe can pass any study in the school,
but we are not going to let any Sophomore force us to take

anything we don’t want to”.

“Oh, you’re not, are you”, says the Head—Sophomore.
“Come on, boys, this fellow don’t belong here”.

They attack Self-Conﬁdence, who struggles hard to main-
tain himself. At last he is forced to ﬂee and a committee of
Sophomores is appointed to see that he stays away.

Everystudent, now deserted by his best friend, makes no
attempt to resist the indignities placed upon him by the Sopho—
mores. These are by no means few. They call him by the
oppobrious name Freshman. He is forced to wear a small
blue cap with a large green button on it as a badge of his posi-
tion. He may not use the same steps or walk as the Sopho-

IHOYCS.

He now becomes somewhat discouraged in his search for
Knowledge. Innocence deserts him. This does not cause him
much sorrow, for of late, he has become ashamed of Inno-
cence.

y taken for his brother Conceit, who is a rascal.

By the middle of the year the Sophomores, becoming
careless, allow Self—Conﬁdence to return. He greatly encour-
ages Everystudent. He begins to get an occasional glimpse of
Knowledge and feels sure he will eventually ﬁnd her. He re-
fuses to wear the undigniﬁed cap and even dares to use the
same walk as the Sophomores. At the end of the ﬁrst year

Everystudent himself becomes a Sophomore.

At the ﬁrst of the Sophomore year Self—Conﬁdence brings
his twin brother Conceit. Now Self-Conﬁdence is all right.
He is a good fellow to have around. However he is oft mis-
The nickname

of Conceit in vulgar parlance is “Swelled Head”. It is Con-

ceit who urges Everystudent, when he is a Sophomore, to drive
Self—Conﬁdence from the Freshmen.

In his Junior year Everystudent comes to despise
“Swelled Head”, and gets rid of him. In his place comes Dig-
nity, a good fellow when he is under control. Everystudent is
now getting closer to Knowledge every (lay.

In the last year of his university life Everystudent ﬁnds
Knowledge and receives a diploma for so doing. After Every-
student has found Knowledge it takes him all the rest of his
life to become fully acquainted with her. Everystudent owes
his ﬁnding of Knowledge to Self—Conﬁdence. Everystudent

will always ﬁnd Knowledge when he has Self—Conﬁdence.

university she claims it is her desire to get educated. She is a
distraction in the class room, an attraction on the campus,
which is to her delight; the greater the distraction and the
stronger the attraction, the higher her glory. Her alluring
smile haunts the underclassmen. She believes college life is
cutting cheese into rabbits without using l)eer or milk. Her
idea of a sorority is a place where the deep—waved-tangled
mysteries of the coiffure are explained. If she is aware that
the fellows are watching her, she always walks with her eyes
straight in front. Any pin that anyone will give her, from a

prep—pin to a real Fraternity pin she will wear prominently.

She knows every Fraternity man in school by his ﬁrst name,
but she loves the Barbs because the Fraternity—1nen are wise to
her game. She buys a “Pitt \Veekly" to be seen carrying it
about the campus, goes to chapel to be seen, and sings to be
heard. Her knowledge of the latest pink for the nails, the
best pencil for the eyes, of the latest dance is astounding to the

unsophisticated. ever is she without a Chamois. Of course

she believes in football, and roots for the college of the fellow‘

who takes her. According to her the seniors are perfectly
adorable, but the Freshmen are a lot of roughnecks. To hear
her tell it. the gym ﬂoor was made for dancing and should not
be spoiled for other things. She has a fondness for the word
“cat" which is an expression of sisterly affection. A ninet_v
l1orse—power automobile is pleasing to her eye, the book of
-fashions is her bible, and her creed is monosyllabic “I”. Anl
still we like her. Do we?

Pitt Weekly, “'11, ‘I2. Y. M C A

One of the “Nervy Four”. He has great ambitions for track. Here's
our sympathy. Horace doesn’t believe in dancing. Wonder why? Is a
great roughneck for a pillar of the Y. M. C. A. Does anybody know why
he and Matt glare at one another every once in a while? We do. Bet
he be a preacher some day. Horrors—he was ﬁred out of the library the
other day. Plays the piano and spends most of his time in the movies,
like all the present—day college students. A good scout.

A head is a head even if there is nothing in it. “Lazy” tells us what
he did and what he will do, but there is no present tense in his vocabulary.
Why he has not become an Economic student (?) is one of the two won-
ders at Pitt. The other is: how Houggy ever got into “dear old College”.
But he’s too good natured to take this seriously. Eats at Moerlein’s in-
stead of University Restaurant.

Quiet and unobtrusive this good—natured fellow is, as he wends his
scholarly way through the stately halls of classic learning peacefully re-
posing on the lofty brow of Father Pitt’s Acropolis. How's that for a
good imitation. Haynes had better come over with two bits for this.
Haynes is some physics shark, too. Proved to Dr. Wenrich's satisfaction
that you can’t drive a nail with a sponge, no matter how much you soak

“Tell me not in mournful numbers,

Thus sings Mac. He’s got a girl. When he was seen at the Basket
Ball Game, a Soph remarked: “There’s McKinney with a fair dame. I
guess there’s some chance for me." Is very eccentric :—is pushing Y. M.
C. A. one day and the next he breaks open a couple of drinking-cup ma-
chines. Nearly went to the “Prom.”

the “ﬁsh” in efﬁciency; and the “pull” in political.

The only thing Cnarles wouldn’t be much good at would be a pall-

A tall lanky 6 foot 0’ man—looks like Abe Lincoln. Here’s one of
those men whom. despite his many faults, we all like. Mac swears off
smoking every other week and takes up chewing. Furnishes the steam to
run the machinery of the Senate. Rumour says that he is partial to the
North Side (P) (of the solar system, of course). Figured he could buy
$20.00 divided by 5 or 400 cigars by not going to “Prom.”

‘little’ here below, but he wants that ‘little long’ ”. Had some ﬂuss at the
Prom.

WILLIAM J. LAPPE, Pittsburgh.
Allegheny High School. Cap and Gown Club.

Gentlemen, this is “Bill”. Books trouble him little and he laughs his
way into the hearts of his classmates. He spends his summers at Chau-
tauqua Lake and the splash he made last year was heard in Pittsburgh.
Knows more people than Franklin ever did and has a habit sitting in a
cool restful place telling stories.

Richmond High School. Earlham College. Track Squad, (2),
(3). Y. M. C. A.

Positive. shy; comparative, shyer; superlative, shyest; ultra-superlative,
Plummet. Through this quality he has acquired some speed in running.
Is so shy of girls that he goes downtown on the Forbes Street cars to
keep from passing “Mamma Chambers’ Home for the Aged”; yet you can’t
blame him. Is a social settlement worker.

LAWRENCE H. PETERSON, Bunola, Pa.
Elizabeth High School. Y. M. C. A.

Whenever you hear a roaring and a howling and a shouting and a
bawling in the vicinity of State Hall, denken Sie nicht, dass die Holle aus-
gebrochen ist. It’s only this king of hard guys and some other loafers in
the basement of said Hall singing (?) hymns (?). Pete is some orator,
but in spite of this he's a pretty good fellow.

JAMES W. ROSENTHAL, Pittsburgh.

Pittsburgh High School. Class Basket Ball, (1), (2). Varsity
Track, (I), (2). Captain, (3).

“Booboo” or “Rosy” is a track man of the ﬁrst water. What he didn’t
know about running, he learned from “Ham” on the Philadelphia trip. Is
a social lion too, as he brought some “queens” to the basket ball games this
winter. He does not claim to be a student; his ability lies along the track
and he’s a hustler at that.

WILLIAM ROBERT SMALLS.
Howard University Academy.

own business and always says you should not worry. Good goods come in
small packs.

 
 

 

FRANK DOWNING SHUMAKER, AA, Pittsburgh, Pa.

Pittsburgh High School. Student Assistant in Analytical Chem-
istry. Student Band.

Here’s a man with class to him. You can tell by looking at him that
hes a jolly good fellow. Has only one failing :—the dod—gasted feminine.
When asked to join the Y. M. C. A. he said, “You fellows can’t do me
any good.” Must be pretty far gone.

ERNEST W. WEBER, N S., Pittsburgh, Pa.

Allegheny High School.

Weber is the terror of all underclassmen. Whenever there is any
rough stuff going on you will ﬁnd Weber there in all his glory. He res-
cued his brother, a sophomore, from the hands of the terrible freshmen
the day the class picture was taken. He is a great booster of Pitt.

HAROLD EUGENE WELLER, Belle Vernon, Pa.
Monessen High School. Wooster University. Glee Club. Chapel

Choir.

The Medical School claimed Del’s smile this year. As a result we
are lacking in Biological authorities in College. He was a business man
too. Be dad, if he was cast away on a desert island where no one lived,
he’d go around sellin’ maps to the inhabitants. Ask him for a coca cola
ticket. Is a Freshman and a Junior at the same time. Can you conceive

of such a phenomenon.

ﬁnd, if not his long sought honest man, at least
a near honest memoir, a quid pro quo of deeds for words
that may record the past events of the remarkable and
original class of 1915. How proud are the chosen few
who wear those numerals over the campus! When lowly
Freshmen, we of course showed our classy football ma-
terial by wholloping the Sophs; nor did the 1916 class
score on us. ‘

Freshman History

UMOR, as of old, had accomplished her duties.
She had warned their unwelcomed victims of
the troubles the ﬁrst day might bring us. After

hastened back and forth across the campus, their way was

chased to make these newly acquired additions of the
school realize their insigniﬁcance. Proceedings then fol-
lowed quite similar to a ﬁeld meet, though somewhat re-
vised in form. There was a peanut race, a dry land row-
ing match and rescue after one of the boats had over-
turned, linguistic oratory on various subjects including
“The Nothingness of Nothing,” the beautifying of the

campus and numerous other stunts. Thus the comedy

continued amusing the upper classmen, pleasing the Soph-
omores and of no less interest to the Fresh themselves.
To form a ﬁtting climax of the (lay, all gladly joined in a
procession, the Fresh locking steps with their Sophomore
guards marching to the city and through the main streets.
This was merely our beginning.

The football team was a success in that it developed
a lot of material for the varsity and before a month was
over a great part of our team was on the varsity squad
and left us crippled. This, however, was just an exhibi-
tion of our spirit that is growing stronger every day. Our
basket-ball team was a winner and made a name for itself.
We trust that as time goes by we may do as much for
Pitt as she is doing for us; that Pitt spirit may grow with-
in us and shine out forever.

WALTER WILLIAM BOYLE, AA, Bellevue, Pa.
Allegheny High School. Engineering Elector to 1914 Owl Board.

The smallest man in the class. We mean small in stature only, for_

when it comes to knowledge and ability, “Jimmie” is one big man. Is an
artist, a musician, an excellent cribber and, drives “my car” perfectly.
Comes to school to learn, and always realizes his purpose. Is a one girl
fellow, and we don’t blame him for we’ve met her.

ANTONIO RIBERIO GUIMARIES, Rio Preto, Brazil.

BENJAMIN GOLDBERG, Pittsburgh, Pa.
Pittsburgh High School. Glee Club. Civil Engineering Society.

An extreme radicalist. Has announced that he intends to change his
name and join both the Y. M. C. A., and the “Turn Verein”. Good luck,
Bennie, we wish you joy. Wiederkehr says that if Goldy were only Ger-
man. he would love him like a brother. Goldy is a ﬁddler of note, (Huh),
and can be seen after all the Basket Ball games doing his little best for the
wrestlers.

P. L. HOFFMAN, Homewood. Pa.
East Liberty Academy. Civil Engineering Society.

Was originally a butcher, but decided to become an engineer and is
now one of Dyche’s closest friends? Took a trip in an automobile last
summer and stayed at the best hotels going, but slept in his car out in the
hayﬁelds coming back. “That was my sister I had at the basket ball game,
fellows”. He is a constant attender of all high school receptions, and is
always strong for a trip to Turtle Creek or Mt. Washington. Another
friend of the summer school girls.

 

J. H. HOYERT.
Valpariso University.

We welcomed Hoyert to our midst this year and have been glad ever
since. He is quite distinguished looking with his glasses on as one can
readily see from his picture. Always shows his teeth when he laughs and
he laughs often. Comes from Valpariso and says he couldn’t help it; that
school was wished on him. Hoyert is a clean cut fellow and we hope he
will stay with us. Somebody speak to Harris.

WILLIAM P. HALL, ASH, Lock Haven, Pa.
Central State Normal School. Y. M. C. A.

Society.

With respect to spending his evening in Schenley Park, he has im-
proved considerably since his Freshman year. Knows every secluded spot
in the park, has a girl on every street in the city, and a different girl for
every night in the week. Has recently been troubled with headaches,
caused by too much study. With the aid of an orange, Bill drove Thorpe
to distraction, and has been lying low ever since. Tried to induce “Vir-
gin” to become a partner in crime, but was unsuccessful. A great friend
of Professor Berger.

KURT HANDGARTNER, Pittsburgh, Pa.

Pittsburgh High School. Student Senate.

The terror of “Heine” and the life saver of Ritter. Has had but one
ﬂunk in his three years and that was Wiederkehr’s course in “Smoking
room etiquette”. A rumor was once circulated that Kurt went to the Gay-
ety after a victory on the gridiron, but this was branded as false. Has but
three faults: his hatred for barbers, his propensity to laugh at Wieder’s
jokes, his—but we don’t know her. She lives in the same place that Kurt
does and nobody knows where that is.

GEORGE HICKMAN, Pittsburgh, Pa.
Allegheny High School.

A student and an undergraduate. Never ﬂumked a subject, never
hopes to. Rolls his own “dreams” and it is said he once chewed tobacco.
With Hoffman for a partner he could be depended upon to give the sum-
mer bunch some swell feeds. He can name every star-that was ever at
the Grand, and if you think Hick has no friends (lady) just stand on Fed-
eral Street with him some day. He knows all those swell North Side
chickens. He was at a party over there one night and they played Post
Oﬂice. Hick said he didn’t even get a circular letter.

Squad, (2), (3). Class Football, (1).

“Bumps is big in body and soul. He has labored and slaved on the
football ﬁeld for two years and has gained nothing but a hoard of experi-
ence, but we well bank on him to turn the trick next year. Bumps talked
about his class football trips until we were weary. “They sure have some
cute ones at Indiana Normal and Slippery Rock.” His very best girl lives
up the country, but we haven’t heard of her lately. You haven’t noticed
Bumps pining away, have you? Argues with the profs and cusses with the
students.

H. F. JENKINS, Jeannette, Pa.
Jeannette High School. 1913 Student Football Manager.

He is the greatest lady fusser in college. He is good looking, and is
therefore a popular favorite at all High School receptions. Has a girl
over in Jeannette; but, he knows a few here in the city, which she is not
supposed to know about. Lookout, brother, some one may inform her.
Once in a while seen in Wilkinsburg.

   

JAMES BERNUS JACKSON, Hunter, N. Y.
Hunter High School. Y. M. C. A.

Was the quietest man in our class when he came, but now——-you would
never know he came from York State. Is personally acquainted with
Maude Adams; that is, his uncle once knew a man that once saw Miss
Adam’s summer home in the Catskills. Jackson is a real worker when
out on Co-op. Hence, the frequent pilgrirnages to Coraopolis. He says
that he has but one objection to that town and that is that Pittock lives
there. Another fellow for whom Hooper supplies the noise. A dramatic

critic of the ﬁrst water.
‘O4

NATHAN BERND JACOBS, F2, Pittsburgh, Pa.
Pittsburgh High School.

One of the sharks, but he can’t help it; he loafs with Handgartner.
Usually sits silent in the classroom, but when he gets outside his face starts
to broaden, his eye to twinkle, and lo a gladsome smile breaks forth. Some
one has said that if it were not for his ears the corners of Nathan's mouth
would meet at the back of his head. It is a smile that cheers one when
he sees it and makes one sorry to leave it behind. Don’t mistake our mean-
ing and try to imitate Jacobs. It can’t be done.

 

 

JOHN KERR MUSGRAVE, ASH, Pittsburgh, Pa.
Shadyside Academy. Y. M. C. A.

The only real business man in the class. He works ﬁfteen hours a
day and says not a word about it. Quiet and good—natured, but shows his
Irish blood when someone starts tomfoolery. Recently proclaimed l’llS
leaning toward equal suffrage by carrying a “Votes for Women” banner.
As Virgin said, “He is for suffrage, heart and coat—tail”. Sings “Han-

nah’s” praise to all who will listen. ‘
*1‘

BERNARD EUGENE O’HAGEN, Pittsburgh, Pa.

Crﬁifton High School. "Cap and Gown Club, (1). Student Sen-
ate, (2 . _

“A fool may give a wise man counsel”; “Dutch” to “Irish”. Very
excitable in class ﬁghts and when contradicted by a Prof. Never has to
take an exam and is even on speaking terms with Physics XIV. Used to
have a girl in Oakland, but deserted her after seeing what they have in
¥rookline. Makes a living by managing his High School Basket Ball

eam.

WALTER PALMER POWERS, Procter, Vt.
Procter High School. Student Assistant Electrical Laboratory.

Bouis would say that Powers belongs to “the Quality” of the New
England “Yankees”. Everlastingly talks of the Green Mountains and Ver-
mont maple syrup, but we all boost the latter, so we can’t blame him.
Went to all the High School receptions during his Freshman year, but has
gotten over it now. Walter is a fairly good dancer, ‘a better singer, and
a most excellent ﬁddler. Rooming with Leilich, spoiled his ﬁrst year and
since Cupid removed the restraining party Powers has enjoyed himself
immensely. Well known to a few and by those few known of well.

LOUIS B. PITTOCK, ASH, Coraopolis, Pa.

Coraopolis High School. Cap and Gown Club, (1). Student Sen-
ate, (2). Engineering Editor, 1914 Owl. Y. M. C. A. Junior Prom.
Committee.

Comes from the country, but won’t own up to it. Famous for mak-
ing speeches on the Honor System. Quite a fusser; knows three Co-eds,
but can’t get Jenkins to introduce him to them all. Neither drinks nor
curses, but that is “Her” fault and we doon’t blame her for such a cute
little thing as “Louie" should not do those things. Is a hard worker when
he works, but takes an eight weeks vacation in the middle of every term.

r2;''1
 

 

JOSEPH LESSIN, Brooklyn, N. Y.
Erasmus Hall High School. Michigan Agricultural College.

“Joe” is the quiet, sober, and industrious good friend of us all. Staid
and conventional, in word and action at least; we know not the inner work-
ings of his master mind. Usually owes the Profs. a large number of re-
ports, but ﬁnishes strong at the end of the term. Not the most illustrious
in C. E. 19, but by far the steadiest. A real man and a generous friend
and you'll ﬁnd you’re missing something if you don’t know him.

GORDON LEWIS, AEH,Verona, Pa.
Verona High School. Y. M. C. A.

Assumes a bellicose attitude toward life. This spirit has gotten him
everything he went after, except his credits in Electricity. Is quite a bas-
ket ball fan and always takes a girl to all the games. Has had a scrap
with Harris and thinks of changing to Economics, but he doesn’t know
what he is _wishing on himself. Seems to always have a “date” in Verona,
but all his letters come from Punxy. Lewis is a hard worker, quite an
artist with a tennis racquet, and all round good fellow. Get to know him
and ﬁnd out for yourself.

JAMES BYRON MCCANN, Homewood, Pa.

Duquesne University. Civil Engineering Society. Cap and Gown
Club, (I).

This good looking gentleman has accompanied Kaye to Panama. He
is a great lady fusser, and can be found most any evening at a place in Mt.
Washington. He was once known to be in the company of Hoffman and
two nurses, but aside from this he still belongs to the one girl class. He

~ was a great favorite with the School Marms who attended the summer

school, and always wore a white collar. Is specializing in Tuxedo.

F. F. MURDOCK, A24), Waynesburg, Pa.

Waynesburg High School. Waynesburg College. Business Man-
ager, I914 Owl. Pan Hellenic Club.

Is quiet but has Hooper to make a noise for him. Is always waiting
on the street corner for some body, but nobody seems to know who he is
waiting for. Floyd is a real student, and in after years we will all be ap-
plying to him for jobs. Takes the Owl seriously.

 

ENOCH COLBY PRATT, Pittsburgh, Pa.
Pittsburgh High School. Varsity Football. Varsity Fencing.

Cap and Gown (1), (2). Class Football.

Short and chubby. Never seen without his letter displayed on his
manly chest. Thinks he is handsome, but handsome is that handsome does.
A twenty-four carat loafer, and since he made the football team, has taken
to posing on the steps and in the hall. Burns up a lot of coffin nails when
he isn’t in training, but they don’t seem to hurt his wind. But Enoch is a
ﬁne fellow in his better moments, and these occur quite often. Visits Doc
Bishop’s ofﬁce every week.

WILLIAM HANS RASMUSSEN, K2, Oconta, Wis.
Oconta High School. Lake Forest (Ill.) College. Pan Hellenic
Club.

William Hans gets them all with that bored, don't-care-if—you-see-me-
or-not air of his. Very handsome, and knows how to use his good looks.
Spent one Co-op. term in playground work, because of the young ladies
working with him. “Rass” is full of plans for the betterment of the class,
but, it was ever thus, the fellows will not take heed and you can easily
see the horrible consequences. Can cuss ﬂuently or assume a sanctimoni-
ous air as the occasion demands.

EDWIN WILLIAM SIEGFRIED, JR., Springdale, Pa.
Tarentum High School. Iowa State University.

Sometimes called “Ed”, sometimes “Siegy” ; but never “Edwin”. They
say he fusses, but we have yet to see him with a skirt. It may be that
he has but one, and she is in Springdale. If anyone knows where that
town is, let him step forward and inform us. “E” is some mathematician
and can make all the Profs. believe that he knows their stuff. In spite
of this, however, he is a good old scout and universally liked. Cusses oc-
casionally.

WILLIAM SMITH. Bulger. Pa.
Pennsylvania State College.

Another newcomer, but no one would have suspected it two weeks
after he arrived for “Smitty” is too good a mixer to remain unknown. Has
evidently held some good positions as he kicks hard against these Co-op.
jobs. Is quite a Prof—bucker and can hand the “retort courteous” to any
of them. He is both large of body and mind and we may all wish that
he’ll “stick around” until June, 1914.

 

 

 

ROBERT HENRY SVENSON, (I)Z(I), Pittsburgh, Pa.
Kiskiminetas Springs School. Cap and Gown Club, (1). Student Sen-

ate, (1).

Robert, the cool and very digniﬁed Robert. Just get fresh with him
and see if you are not reprimanded severely. The very hardest Co—op.
worker in the class and the most gentlemanly fellow in the school. A chiv-
alrous and gallant manner toward the ladies has become a mania with him,
and, don’t advertise this, fellows, but when Svenson journeys to East Lib~
erty of a Sunday Eve, he drops all his dignity and becomes just plain
“Bob”. '

W. H. VIRGIN. ASH. Millsboro, Pa.

W. & J. Academy. Civil Engineering Society. Student Band.
Y. M. C. A.

Bill Hall’s life saver. He was once suspected of carrying matches, and
drinking coca cola. Has a girl over in Allegheny, but is wise enough to
let nobody see her. Comes from a place which is not on the map, but
has almost outgrown it. If he travels with Bill Hall much longer, he will
soon learn the ways of a large city. A real student. Only knows the
word “toot” as applied to a musical instrument.

70

KARL FREDERICK WIEDERKEHR, Altoona, Pa.

Altoona High School. Student Senate.

When he came to Pitt he cut loose and hasn’t been caught yet. Worse
roughneck than Hall and should remain a Sophomore all his life. His
favorite expression, “Lets go down to Abby’s and read a few Moerleins”.
Great at ﬁxing up his room to receive Dad. But Wieder is all right fel-
lows if you know him. But there is only one person who really does
know him, and we don’t know her. Why didn't you bring her to the
Prom, Karl? Not a member of the Y. M. C. A.”

RICHARD LESTER BEST, ASH, Dravosburg, Pa.
McKeesport High School.

One who would ﬁght to uphold his school. Get him started. He
was able to main six Fresh at one time last year, but due to his wooing
of Lady Nicotine (in the form of “Honest Scrap”) has gone down rap-
idly. At present he is helping “Mesta’s to run their plant, and if they keep
Dick long they will have one awful mess. But we cannot improve on
those few words of the 1912 Owl. Under Dick’s name they wrote. “All
that the name implies.”

W. E. KAYE, AEII, Monaca, Pa.
Monaca High School. Civil Engineering Society.

“The Panama Kid”. At the time of writing is a full ﬂedged Pana-
manian. He used to make a bi-weekly trip to the Allegheny General Hos-
pital, and we don’t know what she is doing since he has gone away. Comes
from the same place as Mr. Wagner, and is just as fast (we don’t méan
on the ﬁeld). He is missed very much by all who know him, and we will
welcome him back.
