Moving Out

Its time! Time for
what, you ask? Time
to get all your stuff
packed up and ready
to move back home.

Moving out can be
a time of joy or sad-
ness. For seniors, it is
a time to be joyful,
since you have finally
done it and graduat-
ed. But it can also be
sad, for your days at
Pitt have come to an
end and you have to
say goodbye.

Throughout bouts of

crying, you must pack
up your college memo-
ries, say goodbye to
your many friends
(promising to keep in
touch) and move on.

Finally, everything is
packed and your ride is
here. So you load up all
your stuff into the little
yellow cart and put it in
the car, moving van,
truck, etc., and pull out
of the Quad. As you
pass the Cathedral, you
say goodbye to Pitt.
-Gin Brown

For many students, the de-
cision to attend the Univer-

ii 7 sity of Pittsburgh was made

in their junior or senior year
of high school: Now,“ as
graduates of this University
thatedecision seems to have

M i been made in the distant

past. Yet, that was not so
long ago, possibly five or six
years, which is if you con-
sider your age. almost a
third of your present life-
time. Though it has been

which have shaped the "stu-
dent into the professional

graduation.

Right: Now What?

Graduation

Graduation a time
for some much need-
ed celebration. As al-
ways, this year's
graduation ceremo-
nies were held in the
Pittsburgh Civic Are-
na.

The Class of 1993
graduated on May 1,
1993. The class was
handed out blank di-
polmas during the
ceremony. Never
fear though, the real

thing should be arriv-
ing by the second
week of Iune.

The arena was
packed with gradu-
ates, Pitt officials,
and many parents
and well wishers.
The ceremony
marked the end of
many students’ ca-
reers, and the begin-
ning of their futures
as college gradu-
ates.

Iust by uttering the
words "The University
of Pittsburgh" to a com-
plete stranger makes
an image come into fo-
cus in their minds eye.
That image being the
Cathedral of Learning.
The Cathedral of
Learning is synomous
with the University of
Pittsburgh, for it is the
most recongnized fea-
ture of the University,
towering over the other
ninety buildings that
make up the campus.
Pitt students can find
their way home no mat-
ter where they are in
the city, all they have to
do is to look for the Ca-
thedral and walk that
way. This is possible for
the Cathedral can be
seen from almost every
vantage point in the
Oakland, Squirrel Hill

Student Life

and Pittsburgh area.
The Cathedral holds
a special spot in the
heart of Pitt students.
Iust looking at it brings
back fond memories (or
not so fond memories if
you had a lot of exams
in the building and
maybe did not do so
well on some of them)
of days spent at Pitt. Be
it from reminiscing
about the lack of air-
conditioning in the
summer, the nonexist-
ence of heat in the frig-
id Pittsburgh winter, the
tiny,dark and cramped
classrooms, those
scary elevator rides to
the upper floors, run-
ning up and down
those many flights of
stairs for some much
needed exercise, to
hanging out and study-
ing with friends in the
dark Commons Rooms

to the wee hours of the
mom.

The Cathedral of
Learning plays host to
many campus func-
tions. This year during
Homecoming Week, it
was the scene of the
annual Alumni Recep-
tion. The Cathedral
was also the site of the
fourth annual stair-
climb and the Slovak
Heritage Festival.

Yet, many people do
not know anything be-
yond the point that the
Cathedral of Learning
is the hub of the Pitt
campus. Though the
Cathedral has a rich
history and is full of in-
teresting facts and
happenings.

For instance, did you
or do you know any of
the following facts con-
cerning the Cathedral
of Learning?

- The University, in
1907, bought a pasture
in what is now the
home of Oakland.

- With the construc-
tion of the Cathedral of
Learning, the Universi-
ty of Pittsburgh was re-
located from Down-
town to what is now
Oakland.

- Funded in part with
the dimes of area
school children, today
the Cathedral of Learn-
ing is the schoolhouse
for 28,120 Pitt students.

- Ground-breaking
for the Cathedral took
place in 1926.

- The first classes
were held in the unfin-
ished building in 1935.

Priding themselves on their close sisterhood, the sisters
of Alpha Epsilon Phi actively participating in intersorority
events such as pledge sleepovers, Big/Little activities, and
holiday parties. It is through these events of sisterhood that
close and long lasting friendships develop and mature.

The calendar of social events include a faculty tea, par-
ents/alumni brunch, crush party, spontaneous date party,
formal, and many mixers.

Alpha Epsilon Phi takes academics very seriously. The
pledge program provides individualized attention and
study sessions at the library.

This chapter also strives for campus and community
involvement. AEPhi’s can be seen volunteering at the
Riverview Center, the hospital for the aged. Sisters are also
active in the Mentor Program, Order of Omega, Rho
Lambda, Panhellenic Executive Board, and The Pitt News.

This chapter has received the prestigious Achievement
and Excellence Award for being their number one chapter
in the country. They also placed second overall in Greek
Week 1993.

Colors: Green and White
Mascot: Giraffe

<-== Alpha Delta Pi ==>

The sisters of Alpha Delta Pi are proud to boast the title
“The First and the Finest” as AAII was the first secret
society for women established in 1851. The newly
recolonized Alpha Iota chapter has already proven itself
active on campus, bringing home a Greek Week trophy and

McDonald House.

Although the Alpha Delta Pis are a very close sisterhood,
they are also seen in various organizations on campus.
They can be found as members of business and service
fraternities, the Pitt band, mentors, resident assistants, Pitt
Program Council, and much more. As you can see, the
Alpha Delta Pi sisters are a very diverse group of women.

Even though Alpha Delta Pi is busy on campus, they still
have time for an active social calendar. Along with the
usual fraternity mixers, Greek Week events, crush parties
and chapter retreats, the most anticipated event of all is the
one and only Black Diamond Ball.

The Alpha Delta Pis know when it’s time to work and
when it’s time to have fun, but the most important thing to
remember is “We Live For Each Other.”

ters, with 220,000 brothers world-wide.

Here at the University of Pittsburgh, Sigma Chi prides itself on a
strong uniﬁed brotherhood dedicated to excellence in academics,
athletics, and service to the University and the community. In ad-
dition to success in Greek Week, we participate in several phil-
anthropic services. Our largest campaign, Derby Days, involves so-
rority participation and raised over $1,000 for a local charity. Our
efforts in 1992 earned us our nationals most prestigious award, The
Peterson Signiﬁcant Chapter Award, and Interfraternity Council’s
highest honor, The Cathedral Award.

National Founding: November 1, 1901,
University of Richmond

Pennsylvania Gamma Chapter at Pitt:
December 12, 1903

Colors: Purple and Red

Nickname: “Sig Ep”

Address: Brackenridge Hall

Our academic excellence is insured in an environment which emphasizes
and fosters study skills. Also, the Sig Ep Educational Foundation provides us
with scholarships, loans, academic awards and educational programs and
services. Superior scholarship is a cornerstone of Sig Ep excellence.

Our leadership excellence is cultivated by our leadership developmental
programs. Sig Ep yearly sponsors Regional Leadership Academics which bring
together chapter leaders for a weekend of sharing and learning, Sig Eps also
develop leadership skills from guiding our fraternity to its excellence.

Our social excellence is lived through our strong bond of friendship, fel-
lowship and brotherhood. This special bond lasts beyond our years in college
and extends itself to the rest of our lives. We enjoy the beneﬁts of our social
interactions with sororities and fraternities.

Beta Phi Chapter
at Pitt, 1962

The Beta Phi chapter, was rechartered in the fall of 1986,
and already we have become one of the most inﬂuential
fraternities at Pitt. Over 70 brothers strong, our mem-
berships represents most of the country’s major cities.

Pitt Zebes are very competitive in academics, charity
and intramural athletics. Having one of the top sports
programs among Pitt’s fraternities, we participate in a vast
array of sports including: football, soccer and basketball. In
addition we have proven to be top competitors in Greek
Week. ZBT at Pitt doesn’t stop there! We also have an
exceptional social program in which “ZTBahiti” and our
yearly formal have overwhelmingly proven. Our leadership
excellence extends into the campus as well as the com-
munity. We are actively involved in student government as
well as fundraisers for area charities.

Pitt ZBT is one of the top ZBT Chapters nationally. We
placed 3rd in the coveted Brother Mark Trophy (best
chapter).

what do you want
to do? I don't know.
What do you want to
do?" Have you heard
this refrain often. I know
I have. Usually your re-
ply is "anything."

After you've gotten
over that litﬂe stumbling
block, you come to an-
other one — "Where do
we go to do anything?"
"I don't know wherever
you want to go."

So, it's decided you're
going anywhere to do
anything. That leaves
things up in the air a lit-
tle doesn't it? I mean you
could be going into the
bowels of Pitt Stadium to
check out the caulking
on the hot water pipes.
That sounds interesting
doesn't it. If your like me
that really isn't my cup
of tea. So how about we
go over to the Wﬂliam

Pitt Union and check out
the action there.

The William Pitt Union
is the gathering place of
numerous Pitt students.
The Union offers a wide
variety of things to do.

First, you could walk
down the stairs (or if
you're really lazy or
have a broken toe you
could take the elevator)
and see what's playing
in the T.V. Room. So, if
your ir1 between classes
and your favorite soap
opera is on head on
over to the T.V. Room to
see if it's on the big
screen.

If T.V. doesn't sound
appealing, then walk
about 20 feet and look to
your left. What do you
see? If your eyesight is
20/20 then you should
see the Recreation
Room, also know as the
Pool Room. So if you're

in a mindset to rack ‘em
up and break ‘em up
head on in. Though, if
you don't like pool and
do like video games,
ping-pong and great
tunes come in, because
the Rec Room has all
that and more.

If games aren't your
scene and getting rid of
the munchies is, then
look to your right and
you'll spy the Schenley
Cafe. The Schenley
Cafe offers a little bit of
everything from frozen
yogurt, sandwiches,
soups and salads, to
please that old man
hunger in you.

If you need a place to
crash in between class-
es, if you commute, then
the Blue Room is the
place for you. The Blue
Room offers a quiet,
restful environment in
which to study or catch

 

up on your 40 winks; But,
if you like to talk to your
friends and study then
try the Red Room. It has
comfy seats, a relaxed
atmosphere, and friend-
ly folks.

The William Pitt Union
is also the home of many
campus organizations
including the Student
Government Board, The
Pitt News, the Office of
Student Affairs, and
Panther Prints.

So, the next time you
and your friends need
something to do and
don't know what, stop
by the Wﬂliam Pitt Union
and see what's happen-
ing.

Forbes Field Facts

  

Seating Capacity: 35,000
Largest Paid Crowd: 44,932 on Sunday,
September 23, 1956

Forbes Field is the second oldest major
league ball park in the country, with only
Connie Mack Stadium in Philadelphia
being older.

Forbes Field was built in four months —
work started March 1, 1909 and the ﬁeld
opened and was dedicated on June 30,
1909 before 30,338 fans who watched
the Pirates lose 3-2 to Chicago.

May 25, 1935 Babe Ruth hits homerun
#714, the last of his career. It is the first
to clear the Forbes Field’s right-ﬁeld
roof.

Night baseball came to Forbes Field in
1940 with the first night game being
played on June 4th, the Bucs beat Bos-
ton 14-2.

He owes his start to the in-
eligibility of a superstar. An
emerging superstar himself,
senior quarterback Alex Van
Pelt began his career as a
freshman when Darnell
Dickerson had academic
problems. He was an un-
known. It did not take long,
however, for college football
to sit up and take notice of
the talent of this young play-
er.
Before the start of his sen-
ior season, Van Pelt already
had many impressive statis-
tics. He had 8,104 yards pass-
ing, 620 completions, a .566
completion percentage, and
46 touchdown passes. In fact,
he is the only Pitt quarter-

back to throw over 2,000
yards for three straight sea-
sons. In his ﬁrst year, he set
the Pitt single-season record
with 2,881 yards. He needed
only 494 yards going into the
1992 season to pass NFL Mi-
ami Dolphin superstar Dan
Marino as Pitt’s all-time
leading passer.

Van Pelt surpassed Marino
on September 17, 1992
against Rutgers in only the
third game of the season. In
that game, he passed for a
season high of 395 yards. It
seemed as if he were going to
finish his college career with
a bang.

By mid-season, opinion
was split as to the success of

Van Pelt. His team had a rec-
ord of 2 and 4, and things
were looking grim. Many felt
that he was carrying his team,
and the team performance
was affecting his ratings. The
other side claimed that he
was little more than the man
in the spotlight who based all
his success on his brilliant
freshman career. It seemed
like he went back and forth
between the two opinions,
combining skill and bril-
liance with hard luck and
costly errors. He was racking
up the impressive statistics,
yet his team still lost.

No matter how one looks
at it, however, the statistics
are impressive. He ﬁnished

the season with a total of
3163 total passing yards
and only seventeen inter-
ceptions. His completion
percentage was .602, and
he threw for twenty touch-
downs. Averaging 7.3
yards per play and 263.6
yards per game is not easy.

Alex Van Pelt started his
Pitt career as a star, and he
finished an otherwise di-
sastrous season with im-
pressive totals and new
Pitt records. He was a
bright spot for a team who
did not come away with

‘much glory in 1992.

This season was a long sea-
son, not only for the players
and fans, but also for the
coaches as well. At the start
of the season, high hopes
were held for third year
coach, Paul Hackett. In his
three seasons here at Pitt, he
compiled an overall record of
13-20-l, winning his first
game at Pitt’s last bowl game,
the John Hancock Bowl in
1989.

March 14, 1989, offensive
coordinator and quarterback
coach Hackett embarked
upon his journey through Pitt
coaching ranks. He had pre-
viously worked from 1972-75
as the quarterback coach at
University of California at
Berkeley and ﬁve years as
quarterback and receiver
coach at Southern Cal. He
also served as some type of
offensive coach for the Cleve-
land Browns. San Francisco

for Pitt from Mike Gottfried
on December 31, 1989.

On Wednesday, November
14, 1992, the Paul Hackett
years were over. Hackett an-
nounced his resignation and
left the stadium midway
through the season. He
blamed his resignation on the
lack of success, as to that
point, the team had a record
of 3 and 7. Although he al-
ways stressed academic suc-
cess for his team, he also re-
alized the importance of
success of the ﬁeld. There-
fore, he felt he needed to step
down to allow the team to
advance towards that goal of
success on the ﬁeld.

On December 11, 1992,
Johnny Majors, who coached
the University of Pittsburgh
football team to a national
championship in 1976, re-
turned to Pitt. After spending
the past sixteen years as the
head coach at the University
of Tennessee, he was named

  
 
    

K a'ors returns to take

 
 

   

   

as Pitt’s 31st football coach.
When Majors ﬁrst arrived
at Pitt twenty years ago, he
inherited a squad which had
ﬁnished 1 and 10in 1972. By
1973, however, he guided
Pitt to a winning record, 6-5-
1, for the ﬁrst time in eleven
years. The team also went to
play in the Fiesta Bowl, the
first bowl for Pitt in seven-
teen years. By 1975, Pitt beat
Kansas in the Sun Bowl and
earned the final national
ranking of 15 by the Asso-
ciated Press. In 1976, Pitt re-
mained undefeated, with a
record of 12 and 0, and they
went on to crush Georgia in
the Sugar Bowl to win the
national championship. After
the 1976 season, Majors went
to Tennessee as head coach.
“Coming back to coach at
Pitt is one of the most ex-
citing challenges a person
could have,” Majors said.
“We have had great success
here in the past. To achieve

success again, it will take a

concentrated effort from:

everyone who loves Pitt.’’ ;
Majors will have a tough 1

assignment. The 199231

Panthers struggled to a
ﬁnal mark of 3 and 9 on
the ﬁeld, the most losses
by a Pitt team since the
1972 Panthers. He dis-
counts the skepticism con-
cerning his age and health.
The 57 year old coach un-
derwent open heart sur-
gery before the start of the
1992 season.

“If I didn’t feel good
about this, I would not
have taken this job.” he
said. “If I couldn’t do the
job they wanted, I
shouldn’t be here.”

He realizes times have,
changes, but he is conﬁ- '
dent Pitt can return to the ‘

status as one of the na-

tion’s top intercollegiate .

football programs.

As November third rolled
around, many students
were faced with the issue of
voting for the next presi-
dent.

The main topic of conver-
sation was the question of
who should be elected as
the next president. Presi-
dent George Bush and his
running mate Dan Quayle
were the incumbents. The
challengers were Arkansas
Governor Bill Clinton and
Tennessee Senator Al Gore
as his running mate. And
then there was Ross Perot,
the on-again, off-again in-
dependent candidate and
his running mate James
Stockdale, a highly decorat-
ed former Navy fighter pilot
and POW.

George Bush was born on
June 12, 1924. After service
in the Navy during World
War II, Mr. Bush first went
into the oil business and
then went into politics. He
was elected a congressman
from Texas in 1967. And
then, after a stint as CIA di-
rector and Ambassador to

the United Nations and then
U.S. ambassador to China,
he became vice-president
under Ronald Reagan in
1980. After eight years in
that job, he ran for president
in 1988 and won. His vice
president was Dan Quayle,
an unknown and untested
Senator from Indiana. Born
in 1947, Quayle put a con-
servative imprint on the
Bush administration. He be-
gan his political career in
1976 as a congressman
from Indiana. Four years
later he was elected to the
Senate.

Bush kept Quayle as his
running mate in 1992. The
two arrived at the GOP con-
vention in Houston (and left)
as underdogs to the Clin-
ton/ Gore ticket. During the
GOP convention, the im-
pression the Bush strategists
sought to convey was that
the President was the true
agent of change and that
Clinton was slick and un-
reliable. For the Democrats,
the economy — and Bush's
perceived mishandling of it
— remained the main mes-

sage that they hammered
again and again. After the
Democratic convention in
New York City, the Clin-
ton/Gore ticket was far
ahead in the polls.

Bill Clinton stepped ir1to
the national spotlight and
won the nomination at the
Democratic convention in a
hot Iuly week in New York
City. Clinton, a former
Rhodes Scholar at Oxford
University and a graduate
of Yale Law School, was
governor of Arkansas when
he decided to enter the na-
tional race. As his running
mate, he chose Al Gore,
who was elected to the
House of Representatives at
the age of 28 in his first cam-
paign for public office. He
was elected to the Senate in
1984.

Ross Perot, was at first a
candidate, then he dropped
out in July. Then, about five
weeks before election day,
he dropped back in. Some
called this billionare busi-
nessman from Texas a
spoiler; some called him a
savior. Perot made his first

   

billion when the computer
company he founded began
selling stock. As his running
mate, he chose Iames
Stockdale, 68, a highly dec-
orated former Navy pilot
and POW. Spending mil-
lions of dollars of his own
money and relying on an
army of "volunteers," the
Perot campaign was off and
running. It included a spot
in the presidential debates
that were held in October.
Election day had arrived.
The polls opened at 8am
and closed at 7pm. Voter
turnout had increased from
past years. The nation
turned its eyes towards the
national television cover-
age of the election returns.
The results were encourag-
ing for the Clinton/ Gore
ticket and disheartening for
the Bush/ Quayle ticket. The
final popular vote results
were in at 2am on Novem-
ber fourth. The country had
elected a new President, Bill
Clinton, and Vice-President,
Al Gore.

the Panthers in scoring —
this time tallying 28 points
on 10 goals and eight assists.
He also led the Panthers with
three game-winning goals.
Prex’s two-year total of 17
goals put him on pace to
match the Panthers’ career
goals record of 35, held by
current Pitt head coach Joe
Luxbacher. His two-year
point total stands at 45.

Prex was named to the A11-
Mid-Atlantic Region team

Joe Luxbacher — In his
ninth season as head coach of
the Pitt soccer team,
Luxbacher guided the Pan-

Working with a nucleus of
young but untested players.
Luxbacher guided the Pan-

Luxbacher molded a talented

Big East Champs Again

There’s no doubt that the
nine straight game sweeps
leading to the three match
victory was initiated by the
playing of the three time Big
East Tournament MVP
award winner, Ann Marie
Lucanie. But, the exquisite
playing from sophomores
Melanie Gustafson, An-
nemarie Memagh and Chel-
sea Hemingway, freshman,
Sarah Miklce, Sara’ Mitchell,
Laura Horvath and Alyssia
Yanck was a major contribu-
tion that was also a necessary
contribution.

The team continued on to
the WCAA championships to
unfortunately be eliminated
by Stanford University’s no.
2 ranked team in the first
round. After traveling to Palo

Alto, California to play of

though, the Panthers came

ther team’s future does not
appear to have any gray

Everyones Most Valuable Player

If at any one time she had
anything to prove to anyone
she surely has done it by
now. In the 1992 season not
only did she carry her Pitt
team to its fifth straight Big
East Championship win,
Ann Marie Lucanie was
named the Big East Tour-
nament Most Valuable Play-
er for the 3rd straight year.
She didn't quit with that
award though; she also
captured her second con-
secutive Big East Player of
the Year Award.

When asked to speak
about Lucanie, Coach Sue
Woodstra said that, "I'm
awfully glad Ann is on our
side. If I were playing
against her I would try to
keep the ball away from her
at all costs. The more she's
involved in the match . ..
(pg. 8 Guy book, 2nd column
#2) It is clear that her skills
are not expendible. With her
talent and that of the other
players there is no doubt
that they have a magical
mixture and a brilliant fu-
ture.

One thing that is impor-
tant also is the ability of Lu-
canie to shine yet not steal

the spotlight. Rather she
shows herself as a figure of
leadership and inspiration
to her fellow teammates. As
Woodstra says, "Quote 3,
pg. 8, column 3, main book."
She is obviously not only
looking towards molding the
inexperienced players, she
is looking to capture the
NCAA Volleyball title.

"Our goal this season is to
win the Big East
(Tournament) champion-
ship." That goal expressed
by Coach Sue Woodstra
was certainly accomplished
as the Pitt Woman's Volley-
ball team rallied to beat
Providence on Nov. 21-22 in
the Big East Championship
game.

From the 1991 season to
the 1992 season, the team
lost many experienced
players, leaving the team
with the great challenge of
rebuilding itself to the cham-
pionship team that it was.
Woodstra stated, "We tried
not to talk too much about
expectations this season."
She also stated, "Early in
the season I felt maybe I
was putting too many ex-

pectations on them, even
though I knew realistical-
ly, that we were very
young and that we had
lost so many experienced
players from the previous
year. But, I also know that
we had some great ath-
letic ability." Athletic abil-
ity they proved they had
and any expectations
that could have possibly
been placed on them,
along the lines of team
growth, playing, and
abilities. Woodstra felt, "it
seemed like the players
never had any doubts."
That is believable consid-
ering until Sept. 25 when
Villanova defeated Pitt 3-
l in the 9th game of the
season, the 1992 Lady
Panthers upheld a 28

game Big East winning
streak that dated back to the
1987 Big East Champion-
ship game where Provi-
dence beat the team 3-1.
The team did have behind
it the return of the Juniors,
outside hitter, superstar Ann
Marie Lucanie, who at the
point of the loss, had al-
ready picked up where she
left off last season with a
newly acquired 54 kills, 46
digs, four blocks and 2 serve
aces at the Miami Tourna-
ment. Also, coach was able
to depend on her entire
freshman recruiting class as
Sara Mitchell and Sarah
Mikla finished 2nd and 3rd
respectively behind Lucanie
in kills for their first ten
matches. In the same period
of time, Laura Horvath re-

ported 53 digs, five aces
and 3 kills, as she became
known as a 5-3 defensive
whiz. Finally sophomore
Annemarie Mernaugh con-
tinued her impressive shows
as she started every game
since her freshman arrival
in 1991.

All in all, the team worked
through their youthfullness
and found their niches. In-
stead of having a repeat of
1987, they proved them-
selves as they stormed
through the rest of the sea-
son. When meeting Provi-
dence head-to-head in the
Big East Conference Cham-
pionship game at our home
Fitzgerald Fieldhouse, Pitt
attacked them and
clenched the 5th straight Big
East Championship title.

It may not have been
pretty, but the Panthers did
it. They took it down to the
wire, but they managed to
grab a berth in the NCAA
tournament. The season
started off very well. By mid-
February, the Panthers had
a record of nine and one,
with one loss in the Big East.
In fact they had an impres-
sive seven game winning
streak going coming off the
winter holidays. Many peo-
ple began to give another
look to this relatively un-
known team. It seemed as if
this was going to be their
season.

And, in many ways it
was. The Panthers finished
with an impressive record of
17 and 9 in the regular sea-
son. For many, the highlight
of the season came when
the Panthers upset Seton
Hall in the middle of the sea-
son. Seton Hall was ranked
seventh in the nation, and
later went on to become the
last Big East team in the

NCAA tournament. The up-
set helped Pitt earn a rank-
ing of as high as thirteenth
in the AP polls, and showed
the nation what the team
was made of. The team fal-
tered at the end, losing its
last regular season game
and first Big East Tourna-
ment game to the
Orangemen of Syracuse.
But, they still earned a spot
in the NCAA playoffs.

Under the direction of
head coach Paul Evans, the
team was fairly young. The
team was made up of five
seniors, four juniors, three
sophomores, and two fresh-
men. The team leaders
were no doubt sophomore
Ierry McCullough and junior
Eric Mobley.

Sophomore guard Jerry
McCullough was one of the
smallest players in the
league, standing only five
foot eleven. But, he knew
how to get the job done. He
could dribble through the
toughest defenses, pass

around the tallest players,
and shoot the hardest shot,
including those from three
point range. He led the team
in steals and assists. He also
led the team on the court,
calling the plays and direct-
ing the men on the court.
Earning the nickname of
"Ice", it was not uncommon
to hear the fans chanting his
name during the games.

Providing heighth, power,
and presence on the court,
junior forward/center Eric
Mobley was the big man. He
stood a full foot taller than
McCullough at 6'1 1". But,
the two of them meshed and
led the team. Mobley con-
trolled the inside game, in-
timidating many opponents
with his heighth and ability.
The big "E" was someone to
be reckoned with during the
game.

McCullough and Mobley
were not alone on the court
however, and they had an
impressive team behind
them. Senior forward Chris

losing several key games in the
conference, but they still managed
to pull out a very respectable sea-
son.

The key to the Lady Panther
game was their defense. It was
their defense and team work that
kept them in several games when
their shooting percentage began to
drop. The girls hustled and worked
together to get the victory by keep-
ing the other teams from scoring.
Defense played a key role in this
season.

However, the team had several
stand-out players. Picked in the
pre-season to be the all-Big East
player, junior forward Jonna
Huemrich led the team in scoring
and rebounding. She is also con-
sistent, starting in every game
since her freshman season. The
team looks upon Huemrich as the

player who will come through
when it is needed the most. The
outcome of the game was very
closely related to the success of the
court of this player, and she was
the one player most other teams
tried to shut down. Even during
the slump the ladies went through
late in the season, she remained
optimistic and upbeat, never once
giving up.

Huemrich was not alone, how-
ever, on the court, and the team
had many players who greatly con-
tributed to the team’s success.
Center Turia Ransom was among
the nation’s leading scorers, and
she also was a key rebounder. Suf-
fering a knee injury midway
through the season, she was forced
to the sidelines for a while, but
then came back strong. The team
was not exceptionally tall, but

players such as Ransom and
Huemrich did not let that Stop

The Pitt women’s basket-
ball team ended its 1992-’93
Big East season Saturday,
March 6, with a 74-59 defeat
at the hands of Villanova in
the Big East Tournament.

Villanova used 50 percent
shooting and a stiﬂing de-
fense to send the Panthers to
their second consecutive loss.

“On an ordinary night I
think we can beat them,” Pitt
head coach Kirk Bruce said.
“They played very well, but
we didn’t play up to our po-
tential.”

The Wildcats took advan-
tage of 15 steals and 28 Pitt
turnovers to hold the Pan-
thers to 43.6 percent shooting
from the ﬂoor.

“Villanova did a nice job
defensively against us,”
Bruce said. “I credit their de-
fense for our lack of offense.”

The ’Cats ran an eight-
point lead early in the first
half to as many as 17 in the
ﬁrst and 23 in the second,
sending the Panthers to their
12th loss of the season.

from the ﬁeld and contrib-
uted only six boards.

“They did a nice defensive

“You would think that J onna

The combination of Villa-
nova’s Nikki Benedix and
Karen Connell, who scored
23 and 14 points respective-
ly, proved too much for the
Panther defense. Benedix led
all scorers with 23 points on
eight-of-12 shooting. She also
hit seven-of-eight free
throws.

“Benedix got a couple [of
baskets] on some
breakaways,” Bruce said.

The goal was set two months
ago.

”We will break the school team
record of 186.90 by the end of the
season," first-year Pitt gymnast
Bethany Toellner said after the
Panthers’ first meet of the season
back on Jan. 15.

That was quite a bold state-
ment at the time, considering the
concern over the existing and
possible future injuries and the
uncertainty surrounding the per-
formance of the first-year stu-
dents over the course of the sea-
son. '

Seven weeks later the proph-
ecy became reality as the gym-
nastics team ﬂipped and tumbled
its way en route to having the
best three meets in team history.

On the first Saturday during
Spring Break the team hosted
Ohio State and Towson State,
with each team earning a score
of 191.1 and 188.8, respectively.

This meet was the cnix of the
season for Pitt. The possibility of
qualifying for the ECAC Cham-
pionships and the eventual berth
in the Regional Championships
(playoffs) rested on the outcome.
They had a couple of question-
able performances going into the
meet and they needed to resolve
the problems of inconsistency
and below average contributions
on the part of some gymnasts.

The record-breaking score of
187.50 was due in large part to a
rebirth of a confident, uniﬁed

team. The team had good scores
throughout the better part of the
season, but for various unknown
reasons the team was not per-
forming up to its potential. The
team needed to realize that
everyone must give 110 percent
in order for success to come its
way, and every gymnast re-
sponded by puting forth her best
effort.

The highlights of the meet
were a career all-around score of
37.65 for senior Karen Iorgensen,
a then career-high all-around
score of 37.9 for senior Kristin
Brown and a then school record
38.35 for Alisha Friend in the all-
around.

Pitt began the meet, which
was designated as Senior Night,
on vault with a score of 46.15.
The score consisted of perfor-
mances by Christine Battista
(9.0), Brown (9.2), Friend (9.4).
Meg Iohns (9.3) and Bethany
Toellner (9.25).

The next event was the un-
even parallel bars where the
team earned a school record
score of 47.20.

The Panthers were represent-
ed by Brown (9.45), Iorgensen
(9.4), Friend (9.75), Toellner (9.15)
and Brenda Stevens (9.45), who
saw her first action since the first
meet of the season when she suf-
fered an injury. The scores of
Friend, Toellner and Stevens
were career highs.

Beam has been the question-

able event throughout the sea-
son, but not on this day as the
team earned a then season-high
score of 46.50.

Brown (9.5), Deena Daller
(9.05), Friend (9.4), Iorgenson
(9.65) and a career high for Iohns
(8.9) racked up impressive
scores.

Going into the final event,
which was ﬂoor, the team need-
ed only a total score of 47.05 to tie
the 186.90 mark. But the team
would not settle for a tie. The
team said it wanted the record
for itself finished with a score of
47.65, which was then a season
high.

Commanding performances
were represented by Brown
(9.75), Iohns (8.8), Iorgensen (9.7),
Toellner (9.6) and Friend with a
9.8 for the second time this sea-
son.

Following the meet, team
members said they were excited
but they were not satisfied with
their performance.

"I am pleased with my score,"
Friend said. "But as a team we
know we can do even better."

The team came out on Tues-
day and beat its own record with
a score of 188.3 against West
Virgina University (190) and In-
diana University of Pennsylva-
nia (180.3).

On vault the team score was a
46.5 with Battista and Brown
each earning a 9.3, Iohns and
Toellner a 9.2 and Friend a ca-

 m’?

reer high 9.50.

The team earned a strong
score of 46.25 despite a few falls,
The competitors on the apparq-
tus were Toellner (9.15), Stevens
(9.05), Friend (9.05), Shannon
Brown (9.35) and Kristin Brown
(career high 9.65).

The team moved on to beam
where it earned a new team rec-
ord of 47.40. Toellner scored a 9.0
and the Panthers got career
highs from Daller (9.45), Friend
(9.5), Iorgensen (9.7) and Kristin
Brown (9.75).

Brown's and Iorgensen's
scores were more than simply
career highs. Iorgensen tied the
team record shared by present
gymnast Mikie Myers. But no
sooner was Iorgensen reﬂecting
on her performance she had to
turn her attention toward Brown
who surprisingly broke her rec-
ord set just minutes‘ ago.

Pitt finished the meet on ﬂoor
with a score of 48.15, also a new
team record on this event. The
scores were represented by a
season high for Halovanic (9.25)
and career highs for Toellner
(9.65), Iorgensen (9.7), Friend

‘(9.8) and Kristin Brown with a

9.75.

Brown's score was good
enough to give her an all-around
score of 38.45, which was a 10th
of a point higher than the record
set by Friend just three days ear-
lier.

just not a keg roll, it

was a series of events,

or shall I say
"obstacles," that the

teams) had to "roll"
through.

Friday evening was

The Pitt women's gymnastics
team's performance over Spring
Break, in which it had the three
best meets in its history, earned
the team the opportunity to com-
pete in the ECAC Champion-
ships at Towson State this past
weekend.

That gave Pitt the chance to
qualify for the Regional Cham-
pionship if two things happened.
The Panthers had to outscore the
University of Vermont —— which
was competing against them at
the ECACs — and to outscore
Temple University — which was
competing in another conference
championship. Both school were
challenging Pitt for the seventh
and final spot in the regional
rankings.

The second thing was for the
Panthers to come out and do
what they have been doing the
past three meets — go out-
perform up to their level of po-
tential and put up the numbers
that they were capaple of earn-
ing.

Makes It to Regionals

Pitt has averaged a score of
187.65 in those meets, and it was
most likely going to need a sim-
ilar score at the ECACs in order
to clinch a berth in the Regional
Championship.

Pitt did what needed to be
done. The team scored in the 187
range (with a score of 187.2), and
it beat both Vermont and Temple.
All of this spells victory for Pitt
and a guaranteed invitation to
the Regional Championships,
which will be held on Saturday,
April 3, at Ohio State University.

With their score, the Panthers
finished fifth in a field of seven
teams at the ECACS. The top spot
went to Towson State University
with a score of 191.25. New
Hampshire (189.7) placed second
and Maryland (187.9) was third.
William 8: Mary finished just
ahead of Pitt with a score of
187.3. Iames Madison University
(186.45) and Vermont (186.35)
brought up the rear.

On vault, beam, floor and in
the all-around, Pitt gymnasts
placed in the top 20 a total of nine
times.

The Panthers began the meet
on vault with a score of 46.15.

Alisha Friend had the team's
best score (9.40), which placed
her 13th overall in the compe-
tition.

The routines were performed
by Bethany Toellner (9.2), Chris-
tine Battista (9.15), Meg Iohns
(9.2), Kristin Brown (9.2) and
Deena Daller (9.15).

The next stop for Pitt was bars
where the team tallied a score of
46.40. The scores were provided
Shannon Brown (9.4), Karen
Iorgensen (8.7), Brenda Stevens
(9.55), Friend (9.7) and Kristin
Brown (9.05).

The team then moved on to
beam where it improved its
scores and performed close to its
average score throughout the
season. On this event, Mikie My-
ers placed fifth overall with a 9.6
and Kristin Brown was the 18th
best overall with a score of 9.50.

Daller (9.4), Iorgensen (9.25)
and Friend (9.3) filled out the list
of Panther participants on the
apparatus.

Floor proved to be the differ-

ence between the team moving
on to regionals and going home
to think about next year, as it
finished strong earning a score of
47.60.

On this event the top gymnasts
were Friend with a 9.7, which
was good enough to place her
third among all competitors.

Kristin Brown and Iorgensen
tied for fifth, each earning q
score of 9.650. Toell.ner's score of
9.5 earned her 13th place over-
all.

Friend was the top gymnast
for Pitt and was the fifth best
competitor on the day with an
all-around score of 38.1, only .25
off her personal best score which
she earned this season and only
.35 off the school record set by
Kristin Brown two weeks ago.

Consequently, Kristin Brown
finished 15th overall with a score
of 37.40. Toellner placed 22nd
overall with her score of 35.8.

That score came despite the
fact that this is only her first year
of competition, and thus only her
first time participating in a meet
of such magnitude.

Severino, the Panthers’ top

mark, although not a career

six teams, along with the best
12 individual gymnasts in
each event, compete for only
three team and six individual
spaces in the ﬁnals, which are
to be held on May 17 at the
University of New Mexico.

“Genaro is a great vault-
er,” Pitt head coach Frank
D’Amico said. “He gets ex-
traordinary height and his
vaults look good.”

Severino’s trip to the ﬁnals
is the ﬁrst for a Pitt gymnast

ified on the ﬂoor exercises in
1986.

“He really hit his vault,”
D’Amico said. “He does a
high degree of difﬁculty and
he just hit it.”

What makes Sevcrino’s ac-
complishment all the more
outstanding is that just a year
ago he suffered a season-

“None of us know the story
behind it,” Pitt senior Clare
McShane said. “We never

Belowich could not be
reached for comment at his
Butler residence.

The announcements

shocked players and coaches,
neither of which saw the res-
ignation coming.

“Nobody had anyvclue that
[Belowich would quit],”

Knobloch said. “Everybody
was very upset. It shocked
everyone.”

“I thought they’d have to
cart him out,” senior captain
Clare McShane said. “I never
thought he would go out on
his own will.

“You could definitely say
it was a sad day. He really
brought a name to Pitt swim-
ming.”

Belowich, 42, was named
head coach prior to the 1981-
’82 season, replacing long-
time men’s and women’s
Coach Richard Bradshaw.
Before his tenure at Pitt,
Belowich served as head

Rande Stottlemyer said it
before the Eastern Wrestling
League ﬁnals.

“We could ﬁnish ﬁrst or
fourth [at the Eastern Wres-
tling League championships],
it’s that close.”

And that’s exactly what
Pitt did. Having opportuni-
ties to make a run at the team
title, the Panthers were upset
in the EWL ﬁnals and ﬁn-
ished in Stott1emyer’s least
wanted premonition -
fourth.

Finishing behind Bloom-
sburg, Lock Haven and West
Virginia, Pitt put three wres-
tlers in the ﬁnals but came up
short on all three attempts.

The Panthers, however,
did send six wrestlers on to
nationals, the most Pitt has
sent since 1989. Advancing
were John Ritchey at 126, J.
J. Fasnucht at 134, Steve
Budman at 150, Sean Gibbs
at 167, Jeff Kloiber at 190
and heavyweight Pat
Wiltanger.

“We had six qualities [for
nationals], which is excel-
lent,” Panther assistant
coach Jim Beichner said.

Qualifying six out of 10

Sends Six to Nationals

wrestlers is a feat for a Pitt
team that came off of two
disappointing season-ending
losses. Still, the Panthers
could not avoid the upset in
EWLs.

Perhaps the most shocking
turn of events came at 167.
Panther Sean Gibbs, seeded
No. 1, lost to West Virginia’s
Scott Haig in the 167-pound
ﬁnals.

“Sean got pinned early in
the ﬁrst period which really
hurt us,” Beichner said.

Gibbs, who had beaten
Haig in a regular season dual
meet, got caught on his back
early and could not recover.

Pitt’s other co-captain,
Steve Budman, also ran into
trouble, losing in the ﬁnals of
his weight class.

While Pitt’s seniors strug-
gled, the youths gave some
good signs of a bright future,
especially ﬁrst-year wrestler
Wiltanger.

“Pat [Wiltanger] was a big
surprise,” Beichner said.
“Wilt beat the No. 1 seed
[Cleveland State’s Jeff Sher-
man] in the semi-ﬁnals.”

Wiltanger was a surprise
because he was seeded fourth

. entering the tournament. But

Stottlemyer and Beichner
both said they knew
Wiltanger had the skills to do
well.

“Don’t count out Wilt, he
could ﬁnish ﬁrst or fourth,”
Stottlemyer said before the
tournament. Wiltanger ﬁn-
ished second and qualiﬁed
for the NCAA Tournament
in his ﬁrst attempt.

More youthful Panthers
hopped aboard the NCAA
train as sophomore’s John
Ritchey (at 126) and J. J. Fas-
nucht (at 134) placed in the
top three of their weight
classes and will make the tip
to Iowa City.

Making the trip for the
third year in a row is Panther
junior Jeff Kloiber. The 190-
pounder is back in the
NCAAs looking to become an
All-American for the first
time.

With six wrestlers making
the grade for Iowa City,
Beichner said he is excited at
what lies ahead.

“It’s a heck of a tourna-
ment [NCAA],” Beichner
said. “Preparation is the key
—— this tournament becomes
much more individual. You
have to prepare yourself for

the tournament.”

Beichner said the six qua1.
ifying wrestlers are still prac.
ticing with a few wrestling
partners and coaches and
that these workouts produce
an atmosphere of individu.
ality.

“We do what is best for the
wrestlers,” Beichner said.
“We give them time to them-
selves, and we give them time
to heal.”

Having no EWL champi-
ons this year has not put a
damper on the Panthers’
hopes for an All-American.

“I think we have a good
chance to get at least one [All-
American],” Beichner said.
“Gibbs is our best chance.
Wilt has a good chance, too,
if he goes in with his head
screwed on right.”

Not ruling out anybody,
Beichner pointed out several
circumstances that might al-
low Pitt to advance farther
than expected.

“If you have a good draw
and a good day, anything can
happen,” Beichner said. “But
you still have to wrestle hard
and smart. You got to go out
and know you did the best
you could.”

-—== Wrestling
Motives
By Cory Walborn years. Stottlemyer said he expects

If Sean Gibbs wants inspi-
ration to wrestle, all he has to
do is look inside his locker.

Within “Gibber’s” locker
there is no Penthouse center-
field or even a picture of a girl-
friend. Instead, inside the 2-
by-6 steel box is a photo of a
marked man.

He is a Nittany Lion that is
wanted dead or alive. His
name: Dave Hart.

After losing a controversial
match to the Penn State Wres-
tler at the Eastern Wrestling
League championships a year
ago, Gibbs set his goal for the
1992-’93 season to beat Hart
and help the Pitt wrestling
team win — in that order.

“My locker is plastered with
his [Dave Hart] pictures,”
Gibbs said. “I have one picture
of the EWL championships,
and he is in first and I’m in
second.”

With those pictures en-
graved in his mind, the senior
co-captain is showing his best
stuff this year. With a record of
23-5, the 167-pound wrestler
has become more dimensional
than in the past.

The past dates back to
Gibbs’ hometown — North
Canton, Ohio. Gibbs wrestled
at Hoover High School and has
seen a big difference in wres-
tling styles since he has been in
Pennsylvania the last three

Athletics

“In Ohio the wrestlers wres-
tle more on their feet,” Gibbs
said. “But in Pennsylvania you
ﬁnd more mat wrestlers, and
I’m not really a mat wrestler.”

Gibbs has then stayed on his
feet throughout his college ca-
reer. He has “lived” and
“died” by the takedown.

“I usually beat people on my
feet,” Gibbs said. “I take them
down and I let them up.”

But Gibbs, who had an im-
pressive record of 25-9 last
year, said he was too one-
dimensional a year ago.

“I basically had one move
[for the takedown] last year,”
Gibbs said. “If they
[(opponents)] shut that one
move down, they shut me
down.”

This year, however, Gibbs is
back with a more wide-open
type of attack.

Expanding his offense, he is
ready to make a run at his ul-
timate goal of being a national
champion.

But first and foremost, there
lies the responsibility of being
a team co-captain.

“Last year it was Perry
[Miller] and Scott [Hovan]
who were the leaders,” Gibbs
said. “But this year, me and
Steve Budman have come to
the front and have put stability
into leadership role.”

Panther head coach Rande

both Gibbs and Budman to
carry the team.

“As your seniors go, that’s
how your team goes,” Stot-
tlemyer said. “We expect a lot
from Sean [Gibbs] and Steve
[Budman].”

Expecting a lot is an under-
statement.

Stottlemyer, who calls Gibbs
one of his “horses,” expects
the senior to win every time
out.

“When Coach Stottlemyer
looks at matches, he always ex-
pects a win from me so he can
ﬁgure out who he might wres-
tle at other weight classes to
help our team,” Gibbs said.

Having this type of relation-
ship with his coach, Gibbs has
learned plenty from Stottlemy-
er.
“Coach Stottlemyer instills
the desire to win. He creates
the greatest intensity level
needed to win,” Gibbs said.
“He teaches you to go ‘balls
out’ constantly, nobody is go-
ing to go harder than you for
those seven minutes [the
length of a college wrestling
match].”

Not many people have gone
harder than Gibbs for those
crucial ticks on the clock.
Gibbs has won over 70 match-
es at Pitt and the count is still
on as the season approaches its
midway point.

Gibbs’ solid, hard-nosed
wrestling has brought back I
memories of the recently de. .
parted All-Americans Miller
and Hovan.

“Sean is an outstanding,
ﬂashy athlete who has a lot of
good stuff,” Stottlemyer said.

Stottlemyer also said that
Gibbs has the potential to I
wrestle on the level of Miller
and Hovan.

With all of these compari-
sons and the important role of
team co-captain, Gibbs knows l
he only has two more months 3
to wrestle before his career is 
over. I

During these two months,
Gibbs will help the Pitt wres-
tling team to the best of his
abilities. ,

But don’t be misled, only
one thing will be on his mind.
A Feb. 20 date against Penn
State — against Dave Hart.

That match has been Gibbs’
obsession since he lost to Hart
almost a year ago. It is Gibbs’
personal rematch, and he is ea-
ger to show he is the better
wrestler.

“I can’t wait ’til the Febru-
ary 20th showdown,” Gibbs
said. “I think about it, and
Dave Hart, constantly.”

Just ask to see “Gibber’s”
locker.

, he expects to build on the un-
expected success of this win-
iter.
‘ “We did very well consid-

back during the indoor sea-

f great contributions.”

Najuma Fletcher played ma-

down with injuries.

Williams, a senior, ran the
fastest 55-meter hurdle time
in the United States at the
Big East Championships and
was recently named All-
American at the National
Championships in Indianap-
olis. She placed sixth in the
country in the 55-meter hur-
dles.

“Allison ran outstanding in
the Hoosierdome,” Lewis
said. “Hopefully she can con-

Fletcher, a first-year stu-
dent, set three Pitt records

Hurdler Williams ma/ees ber mar/e

By Keith Pompey
For The Pitt News

For the past four years, Pitt hurdler Allison
Williams has been compared to the two—time
Olympic gold medalist Roger Kingdom.
Kingdom, a former Pitt great, holds the world
record in the 110-meter high hurdles.

But when asked about her comparison to

Kingdom, Williams will tell
you she does not like to be
compared with male‘ hurdlers.
Allison would rather stand
alone.

“People still compare me to
Roger (Kingdom), Eric
(Cannon) and Elbert (Ellis),”
Williams said. "They were
hurdlers on the men’s team. I
am a hurdler on the female
team. I would hope the
women's program at Pitt has
enough credentials to stand ‘
on its own.”

Williams hopes to add to
those credentials by winning
the 100-meter hurdles at the NCAA
Championships June 2-5. The storybook end-
ing would be a ﬁtting career topper for the
woman destined to go down in history as the
most successful hurdler in Pitt women's track-
and—field history.

For the few people who don't know much
about the hurdling phenom, Williams is a
senior from Bayshore, New York, who, in
1990, established herself as one of the
nation's top track-and—field performers. She is
the first female hurdler’ from Pitt to obtain All-
American status. V

Besides Williams’ tremendous hurdling abil-
ity, she also carries a 3.14 grade point average
as an exercise science major. For her hard

    

work both on the track and in the classroom,

,Williams was awarded the Blue—Gold award

at the seniors’ award banquet. The Blue—Gold
awards are presented annually to the male
and female student-athletes who best repre-
sent the student-athlete ideal based on acade-
mic scholarship, athletic achievement, leader-
ship qualities and citizenship.
Williams, who hopes to attend physical
, therapy school in the near
future, credits Pitt head coach
Steve Lewis for her success in
the classroom.
“He is the main reason the
women's tiack—and—ﬁeld team
has a high graduation rate,"
' Williams said. “Coach Lewis
stresses that college [athletics]
cannot be your center in life.
He say a person’s focus in life
is to be the best person they
can be."

performer, she was crowned Big East champi-
on in the indoor 55—meter hurdles, breaking
the school record in the process. Her rookie
success continued during the spring outdoor
season as well. Williams broke Pitt’s outdoor
100-meter hurdles record and helped the
Panthers win their first Big East conference
championship by winning the hurdles and
running on the winning mile relay.

coach John Vasvary said.
“We started the season real
slow, but the team really
came on in the last few meets
of the season, which gives me
great hope for next year.”
First-year speedster Jay
Jones sprinted his way to
ﬁfth place in the 100-meters
with a time that was the
fourth-fastest in Pitt men’s
track history. Jones’ perfor-
mance helped ease the pain
of not being able to run the
100-meters in the Big East
Tournament because of a
false start disqualiﬁcation. In
the IC4As Jones showed
hints of what might have
been as he finished ahead of

all the Big East 100-meter
sprinters in the event this
weekend.

Jones, Curtis Anderson,
Brian Whitley and Jay Mur-

ran seventh in their compe-
tition [41.61]. Sophomore
Wes Alexander also earned
All-East honors by placing
sixth in the 110-meter hur-

In the ﬁeld events, Pitt had
two more All-East athletes.

In its ﬁnal tournament of
the fall season, the men’s ten-
his team earned a second place
trophy in a doubles bracket
and compiled a 9-16 record at
the Duquesne Invitational last
weekend.

The Panthers completed
their season with a perfect 3-0-
1 record.

The tournament field in-
cluded Saint Bonaventure, the
University of Detroit, the Uni-
versity of Buffalo and Du-
quesne University.

Unlike the Eastern Michigan
Invitational on Oct. 2-4, in
which all players competed
against equal seeds, the Du-
quesne Invite grouped the top
three seeds and the bottom
three seeds into two groups
and let them battle within their
respective groups.

This allowed for unmatched
seeds to have a chance to play
each other — a departure from
standard collegiate tennis.

The No. 1 seed for the Pan-
thers, Alex Cobbold, lost to
Thiru Govender of Saint Bon-
aventure 6-2, 6-4 in his first

match of the day. Unable to
compete in the consolation
match due to a muscle pull in
his leg, Cobbold defaulted to
finish at 0-2.

Pitts No. 2 seed, Scott
Smith, encountered similar
problems in his second match
as he was forced to withdraw to
Vince Riveroll of Duquesne af-
ter defeating Buffalo’s John
LaVere 6-3, 6-4.

Eric Weaver, Pitt’s No. 3
seed, lost two matches in his
bracket. The first came to
Adolfo Willete of Saint Bon-
aventure 6-1, 7-5. The second
went to Julio Godreau 7-5, 6-4.

In bracket B, the grouping of
seeds 4, 5 and 6, the Panthers
encountered greater success as
the bottom grouping broke
even with a 5-5 record.

No. 4 seed James Chronister
defeated St. Bonaventure’s J a
Harned 6-0, 7-6 but lost to Je f
Edd of Detroit 6-0, 6-3.

Effrum Garnett, the Pan-
thers’ No. 5 seed, encountered
the most success in the singles
draw. He notched two victories
before finally having to sue-
cumb to an illness midway

through his match with the
Buffalo’s Matt Klein. The
score for the match was 6-4, 1-
0 before Garnett withdrew.

Garnett did, however, gar-
ner two tough wins in the
bracket after losing his opening
match to Kirby Hasseman of
Detroit 6-3, 4-6, 6-2. He de-
feated Dave Gallagher, also
from Detroit, 6-4, 6-4, before
encountering Panther team-
mate David Dumpel, whom he
dispatched 4-6, 6-2, 7-5.

No. 6 seed Jeff Campbell
split his two matches of the
day. The senior began by de-
feating Matt Klein of Buffalo
before bowing out to Brian
Mitchell of Saint Bonaventure
7-6, 6-2.

David Dumpel, Pitt’s sev-
enth player, lost to Luis Gurri
of the University of Buffalo, 6-
2, 6-2, before defeating Jason
Fuges of Duquesne, 4-6, 6-2, 7-
5

The doubles pairing of Gar-
nett and Campbell provided
the Panthers with the only
placing of the weekend, a sec-
ond place finish in Group B.
The duo began by beating pairs

from Duquesne and Buffalo, 6-
2, 6-0, and 6-4, 6-2 respective-
ly, before losing to Saint Bon-
aventure, 7-6, 6-0.

In Group A, the team of
Cobbold and Chronister de-
feated a team from Detroit 6-1,
6-3 before losing to Mark
Garwood and Tony Whitt, also
from Detroit, 6-4, 7-5.

Weaver and Smith, the sec-
ond of Pitt’s two Group A
pairs, were hampered by
Smith’s toe infection as they
defaulted to Robert Rydell and
Kirby Hasseman of Detroit.

Dumped and Kevin
Sambuchino, the second of the
two Group B pairings, suffered
a loss to Luis Gurri and David
Monkarsh of Buffalo, 5-7, 6-3,
6-1, after receiving a bye in
their first match of the day.

played. Smith and Cobbold

The Pitt women’s tennis
team wrapped up the 1992-
’93 fall season by defeating
Indiana University of Penn-
sylvania and Youngstown
State.

These two victories gave
Pitt a final fall record of 7-3.

The Lady Panthers will
now enter the spring cam-
paign knowing that they have
already completed their first
winning season in four years.

On Oct. 14, Pitt faced one
of the region’s tougher com-
petitors when the team trav-
eled to Indiana, Pa., to face
the IUP Indians. These two
teams have had close battles
in recent history, and this in-
stallment was the closest by
far.

Top seed Julie LoPrinzi
gave Pitt an early lead with a
victory over Heidi Sjoberg of
IUP.

After dropping the first set
seven games to ﬁve, LoPrinzi
stormed back with a venge-
ance, dropping only three
games for the rest of the
match. She would go on to
win in three sets (5-7, 6-1, 6-
2).

IUP’s Amy Newlon quick-
ly evened it up by defeating
Pitt’s Alison Baker in No. 2
singles. Newlon won con-
vincingly, taking the match
in straight sets (6-1, 6-2).

The Lady Panthers an-
swered back with consecutive
victories in Nos. 3 and 4 sin-

gles.

Senior Erika Devins, who

has been one of the Lady
Panthers’ most steady per-
formers, rolled through her
No. 3 singles match. Devins
wasted no time in this match,
winning in straight sets (6-2,
6-0).

Marla Zielinski followed
with a win in the No. 4 spot.
Zielinski’s straight set (6-1, 6-
4) victory gave Pitt a 3-1
match lead, with two more
singles matches left to play.

The Lady Panthers saw
their lead evaporate when the
Indians stepped up to take
the final two singles matches,
leaving the contest to be de-
cided in the doubles round.

Pitt’s No. 1 doubles team
of LoPrinzi and Devins
helped Pitt regain the lead
when the team thumped the
IUP tandem of
Sjoberg/Newlon in straight
sets (6-2, 6-0). The score was
4-3 with two matches to go.

IUP again climbed back
with a win in No. 2 doubles.

Baker/Zielinski in straight
sets (6-4, 6-3) to tie it up at
four matches apiece. This
meant that Pitt’s No. 3 dou-
bles team of Andrea Pas-
sarelo/Carie Voda would play
the IUP duo of Hort/Barker
in a winner-take-all match.

After dropping the ﬁrst set
6-2, Passarelo/Voda took the
second set by the same 6-2
score. This forced a deciding
third-set tiebreaker.

The battle in the ﬁnal set
went back and forth until the
two teams were tied with six

games apiece. Both teams
would now have to play a
match-deciding, third-set
tiebreaker.

The Lady Panthers finally
came out on top in this back-
and-forth affair, winning the
tiebreaker 7-3. The hard-
fought victory raised Pitt’s
record to 6-3 on the year.

“The win [against IUP]
was very important for us,”
Pitt head coach George Dief-
fanbach said.

“We really earned this
one.”

Pitt played its final fall
match on Oct. 16 against
Youngstown State at the Cost
Center. This victory came
much easier, as Pitt won 7-1.

Youngstown’s top seed, Ju-
lie LeMay, became
LoPrinzi’s latest victim.
LoPrinzi completely over-
powered her opponent, tak-
ing the match in straight sets
(6-1, 6-0).

LoPrinzi’s victory set the
tone for a dominating Lady
Panther victory.

Pitt’s Nos. 2, 3 and 4 sin-
gles players blasted their
Lady Penguin opponents
with three consecutive,
straight-set victories. These
wins, combined with a de-
fault win in No. 6 singles,
clinched the victory for Pitt
before the doubles round
even began.

In No. 2 singles, Baker an-
nihilated Cindi Lane of
Youngstown State (6-0, 6-2).
No. 3 Devins destroyed Tar-
ra Pavlosky (6-0, 6-2), and

Zielinski downed Jen DiPas.
qua (6-2, 6-2) in the No. 4
slot. Pitt’s Josie Neiswenter
won by default in No. 6 sin.
gles.

Pitt’s only defeat of the day
came in No. 5 singles, where
Voda lost to Susie Schwartz
in a third-set tiebreaker (6-2,
5-7, 7-6).

With the Pitt victory al.
ready wrapped up, both
coaches agreed to play only
two doubles matches in a pro
set format. Pitt won both
matches 8-6.

The impressive 7-1 victory
gave the Lady Panthers a 7-3
record for the fall sea-
son.They are now guaranteed
their first winning record
since going 7-6 for the 1988-
’89 season.

“The key [to the 7-3 fall
record] was that we won
three of our matches by a
score of 5-4,” Dieffanbach
said.

“We worked on improving
fundamentals all season 
we had good teamwork
throughout the year in our
doubles matches, which can
often determine the outcome
in a close match. I am very
impressed with our perfor-
mance so far.”

The Lady Panthers will be-
gin the fall season on March 4
at home against Cleveland
State.

They will then travel to St.
Bonaventure on March 20
and Buffalo on March 28.

Students rolled kegs
Friday afternoon on the
Cathedral lawn and
partied afterward with
three live bands, fire-
works and a laser
show.

Todd Cable, Special
Events coordinator for
the Pitt Program Coun-
cil which sponsored
these activities, said
that there was a bigger
turnout than last year,
and students were
more enthusiastic
about it.

"People were more
into it than last year, a
lot more people were
cheering on the side
even when members of
their team were not
competing," he said.

"It was a real team
effort, there was com-
petition but not individ-

ual competition. It was
more of a group effort,
everyone cheered for
other teams, not just
theirs," chair of the Keg
Roll, Shelby Patrick,
said. "It definitely
shows a lot more spirit
among students. Any-
one who didn't partic-
ipate really missed out,
it was a good time."

Sue Kwiecinski,
member of Kappa Del-
ta sorority said, "The
most crucial part of the
Keg Roll was the egg
toss, that's where the
most time was lost. The
revolutions were very
hard, everybody kept
plunking over."

"I think it's good
though, because it
helps keep the student
body active and in-
volved," she said.

David Mattiko, mem-

ber of the Iota Beta
Kappa fraternity,
which placed first at
the Keg Roll said, "It
was a lot more fun than
last year, it was a good
opportunity to have a
good time and relax."

Chancellor O'Con-
nor, who was at the la-
ser and fireworks
show, said, "Home-
coming has just been
terrific so far . . . I've
had a tremendous op-
portunity to meet with
some terrific alumni. It's
been a great weekend
so far, and I'm looking
forward to a great rest
of the weekend."

"I'm so impressed
with the students’ ef-
forts to put on this pro-
duction, these fireworks
are just great," Mary
Ann Aug, director of
Human Resources,

said.

After seeing the sky
light up, students lis-
tened to The Clarks,
Pure Gold and Stinging
Rain in the William Pitt
Union.

Robert Iames, guitar-
ist for The Clarks, said
the group was happy to
be playing at Pitt. "It's
really nice to be back,
we haven't played on
campus in a while."

"I liked the fireworks
and laser show. I
thought it was pretty’
awesome," said Pitt
first-year student Brock
Nedierlander. "Be-
cause of midterms, it's
a great time to relax
and have a good time."

Great Promise
By Tom Schneider “I don’t think you can Unfortunately, the Huskies off the persistent Husky at.

For the Pitt Baseball team,
a season of great promise and
vast improvement came to an
abrupt halt when the Pan-
thers fell to the University of
Connecticut, 5-3, on Satur-
day. The loss ended the Pan-
thers’ dream of a first-ever
Big East playoff berth as it
dropped the team to sixth
place in the ﬁnal standings.

The Panthers ﬁnished the
season with a 10-11 mark in
Big East play, the best con-
ference record ever for a Pitt
team. Despite their strong 9-
5 start, the Panthers struggled
down the stretch, losing six of
their last seven conference

games.

point to one thing [that
caused the downslide],” sen-
ior ﬁrst baseman Jason Roth
said. “As a team, we didn’t
play as well as we were earlier
in the season. I don’t think
we played over our heads
[earlier in the year]  we
just seemed to play down to
our competition down the
stretc .”

After being manhandled by
ﬁrst-place Villanova in a 10-2
loss on Thursday, the Pan-
thers needed a win over
UConn and a St. J ohn’s vic-
tory over last place George-
town on Sunday in order to
secure the fourth and final
playoff spot.

had other ideas as UConn
pitcher John Kelly held the
normally potent Panther of-
fense to just three runs on
eight hits.

“We just weren’t getting
guys on base as much as we
can,” said Roth, who scored
one of Pitt’s three runs with a
solo home run. “Earlier in
the year, it seemed like every
inning we had a chance to
score a lot of runs, and we
weren’t doing that [on Sat-
urday]  Kelly pitched a
very strong game.”

Panther hurdler, Bill Jun-
ker, pitched well while scat-
tering nine hits throughout
the game but could not hold

tack which pieced together
runs in five different innings
to topple the Panthers.

Pitt’s lost opened the door
for the Redmen, who could
take the Panther’s spot in the
playoffs with a win over the
5-15 Hoyas.

Despite missing the
playoffs for the ninth straight
year, this was a hugely suc-
cessful season for the Pan-
thers and Jackson. In only his
third year as Pitt’s head
coach, Jackson has done
wonders to turn around a
program that was headed no-
where when he arrived.

Sutherland Hall a
new place to dwell.
Construction started for
the new dorm in late
1991, with the estimat-
ed completion date
slated as spring or ear-
ly summer of 1992. This
was to be a massive
undertaking, Pitt's first
new dorms in over a
decade.

Sutherland is a state
of the art dorm facility.
It consists of two wings,
east being eight stories
and west being ten sto-
ries high, connected by
a central commons
area. The dorms con-
tain two laundry rooms,
one for each wing of
the building. The sec-
ond ﬂoor of the com-
mons area houses the
joint cafeteria. The east
wing offers a fully
stocked kitchen with all
the equipment: dish-
washer, microwave,
stove, oven, lots of

Student Life

       

counter space, and
sink.

The first ﬂoor of the
commons area con-
tains the mail room,
main desk, and com-
puter lab. With the con-
vience of the computer
room, Sutherland resi-
dents do not even have
to leave the residence
hall in order to work on
the computer.

Sutherland Hall even
boasts its own shuttle to
carry the residents to
and from the residence
hall to the lower cam-
pus area. The shuttle
service runs twenty-
four hours a day to
meet the needs of the
residents.

The rooms in Suther-
land are six person
suites, four person
suites, and doubles.
The suites have a self-
contained bathroom
area, a common living
room area and the
bedroom areas are

Sutherland Hall

A New Place To Dwell

doubles. The doubles
share a bathroom with
the double next door.
The rooms are very
spacious, each resident
has a bed, desk with a
built in shelf unit, and a
large dresser. The
rooms also contain two
very large open, airy
closets and a
countertop area with
shelving area located
above.

Each ﬂoor has a tel-
evision lounge and
study lounge, that the
residents may make
use of. The television
lounge is equipped
with cable television,
therefore, residents
may tune into their fa-
vorite shows on any
channel.

Though Sutherland
was to be completed
before the beginning of
classes in August 1992,
some parts of the build-
ing were still unfinished
when residents moved

into the building. The
landscaping around
the building was not
complete until late Sep-
tember. The laundry
rooms were not com-
plete with washers and
dryers until the first full
week of September.
The mailroom finally
opened a month into
the term and the caf-
eteria opened in Octo-
ber of 1992.

Dear Iim,

Hi! Sorry I haven't
written in months, but
you know me. I've been
busy, busy, and busy.

What's up? Lots of
stuff here, I can't wait to
tell you about it. So,
how are you? I'm fine,
the semester's pretty
cool, so far.

I moved into a new
dorm, the new ones.
They are great. Moving
in was a pain of course.
Who wants to lug
10,000 boxs of stuff from
the car into a room? My
room is huge. I've got
all new furniture -
bed, dresser and this
huge desk. Me and my

Student Life

roomie, Danelle, get to
share a bathroom with
the girls next door -
Lisa and Kara. But,
that's cool with us since
we're friends.

I have a great view
of Pittsburgh, since I
live on the East side of
the building. And if I tﬂt
my head just right I can
see all of the stadium.
What a way to watch a
football game, if I don't
want to walk across the
road to the stadium.

The only thing(s)
wrong when I moved in
was the mail room
wasn't finished yet, so
we had to go to a tem-
porary maﬂroom to get
our maﬂ. That was a

pain, because they
were never open when
I had time. They finally
got the washers and
dryers into the laundry
rooms after we had
been there for a week.
It was about time to, I
had a lot of laundry pil-
ing up. The washers
are those new com-
puterized ones and the
dryers are the best,
they have them set a 44
minutes per 50 cents.
The computer lab
wasn't open, but now it
is so I can compute my
brains away in the
middle of the night
without having to leave
my dorm. The only
bumming thing was

that the cafeteria
wasn't open either, and
we had to hike our butts
down to Lothrop or the
Towers to munch and
crunch. They finally
opened it in October,
boy is the food tasty. I
mean it really. It
knocks the gravy off
the mystery meat in the
Towers.

Well, I have to be go-
ing Danelle, Lisa, Kara,
and me are going off to
Zelda's (‘member this is
a Thursday night). Got-
ta go. Take care.

Love,
Gin

Living in Holland Hall
is not all that terrible.
You know that all wom-
en's dorm that is locat-
ed smack dab in the
middle of the Schenley
Quad. Yes, the one that
is shaped like a U and
overlooks the Quad,
the Towers and Fifth
Avenue.

In fact, living in Hol-
land is kind of nice.
Holland is a lot quieter
than the Towers. The
elevator stops on every
floor, not every third
ﬂoor like in the Towers.

The rooms are more
spacious, they are
square or rectangular
in shape, rather than
looking like a slice of
pie. Though, Holland
does not have central
air or heat, it does have
a kitchen on every
ﬂoor. Clearly a bonus,
think of all the late
night munchies you
can whip up on the
stove instead of nuking
in the old microwave.
Friendships build
rather quickly, since
you see everyone in the
hall and bathroom.

  

Holland Hall

A Feeling Of Home

 
 

Surprisingly, there is
not a morning rush to
hit the showers, al-
though someone is al-
ways taking one no
matter what time it is.
Decorating the hall-
ways for holidays is al-
ways a group project.
And you can tell it is
someone’s birthday
from the cake scent
wafting from the kitch-
en and the signs wish-
ing them a Happy B-
day taped to their door.
Holland Hall is a
great place to live de-
spite the ten fire drills

    

within a three week
time frame, during the
first semester. Also, it
tends to be irrating
when the North side of
the building is closed,
and you have to go
through South. I am
among the plethera of
people who have tried
to get out and was
trapped in the lobby.
So, if you get a
chance come on up
and visit us in Holland
Hall. You will feel right
at home.

Pie shaped rooms,
tempermental elevators
and noise, noise, noise,
noise. Yes, ladies and
gentlemen, welcome to
Towers A, B and C. The
greatest place to be.
Yeah if you like living in
an itty bitty room. God
forbid that you would
want to stretch out in the
place. There isn't
enough room to breathe.
The elevators stop on
every third ﬂoor. Have
fun trying to move in.
But, of course, they
have the luxury of a caf-
eteria right downstairs.
This is a constant source
of entertainment. What
better way to spend an
evening with your
friends than a heated
debate over what the
meat of the day is. They
put gravy over every-
thing so it makes it dif-
ficult. And did you ever

Student Life

notice that the put olives
in every thing? We al-
ways liven things up a
bit by playing with our
leftovers. We create
everything from Mr. Po-
tato Heads to garnishing
drinks. The reason we

have so much extra food
is because we have to
sample everything in or-
der to determine which
is the worst. The whole
problem with cafeteria
food is that it looks and
tastes good for about 30

   

seconds. And somehow
the food gets extremly
cold going from the
counter to your seat. An-
other great thing about
living in towers is the
Towers Express. What is
more fun then spending

all your choice dollars
on junk food from our
campus store. The tow-
ers lobby is a great
place to meet people.
Everyone always seems
to just be waiting
around for something.

The last bonus of living
in the towers is that you
can check your mail
every hour since the
maﬂroom is right next to
Towers Express. Hey it
isn't all bad.You get to
know your roommate
real well since you are
constsantly stumbling
over one another. And
you do make several
friends in such small
quarters. The view isn't
too bad and the Quad is
only a few feet away.
That is if you can catch
an elevator going down.

up.

and find something to do to
whﬂe away the time.

So, you are working on
number four, good choice.
Ahha, what do we have
here — The Pitt News. Now
there is something to do.

You pick up your copy. Time
to look at the headlines,
read a couple of lines to get
the scoop on the happening

else this paper has in store

sports, the crossword puzzle
and comics (if they had
enough space to put it in
when they created the pa-

possibly the campus police
blotter. Ahh. . .the blotter,

what interesting things have
happened in the last couple
of days in and about the Pitt
campus.

The campus police blotter
is one of the most widely
read items in The Pitt News.
Students not only read it to
keep informed about the
crime situation around Pitt,
but most students read it for
the sake of pure enjoyment.
The blotter is always a
source of laughter. People
get together and laugh over
some of the things that were
reported in the blotter.

 The campus police

blotter is back! ‘

As graduating seniors
many of you know that the
blotter was taken away
from the Pitt student body
for almost a year. This was

due to University policy. But, '

on Wednesday September
16, 1992 the campus police
blotter was back.

For your pleasure we
have taken the liberty of
giving you a permanent co-

Spring Break. It con-
jers up thoughts of sun,
sand and surf. It also
brings to mind party,
party, party, party and
even more parties. To
many spring break is
thought of as one big
wild party where
spring breakers drink
too much beer and al-
cohol, party ‘til they
drop and reke havoc
on Florida communi-
ties.

Though this may be
the case for other uni-
versities, it is not the
case of Pitt spring
breakers. Pitt students
are sought after by
many different Florida
cities, for Pitt students
are regarded as one of

the best spring break
groups. Pitt students
know how to party and
party well. They party,
get drunk, have a good
time, but they do not
destroy. It is this fact
that makes Pitt spring
breakers a sought after
commodity.

The Pitt Program
Council is in charge of
organizing the annual
Pitt spring break pil-
grimage to the sun.
This year once again
they chose to go to Pan-
ama City Beach, Flor-
ida. Panama City
Beach is the newest hot
spot for spring break.
The city welcomes
spring breakers with
open arms. The area is

a hot spot for it offers
many attractions, such
as the night clubs Pine-
apple Willies, Spinna-
ker, Club La Vela, nu-
merous seafood
resturants, shops ga-
lore, games, bungee
jumping, para-sailing,
jet skiing, deep sea
fishing, mazes, scuba
diving, etc.. Panama
City Beach has every-
thing to offer.

It's spring break and
I want to go again
since last year was
such a blast. That was
the sentiment echoed
by yours tmly this year
when the time for
spring break rolled
around again. Who
wants to go with me?

Well, I gathered three
close friends, Danelle
Marra, Evon Hromy
and Monica Rager, to-
gether and we decided
to go for it. This was
way back in early Feb-
ruary. We decided that
if we were going to do
Panama City Beach
right we would need a
car. So there I went
thumbing through the
yellow pages. Ahhh. ..
there it is rental cars.
We made the reserva-
tion, and we were set.
The car would be there
waiting for us the day
we arrived in Florida.

Time to get ready to
go. We're making our
lists, checking them
twice, still trying to de-
cide if we'll be naughty
or nice. Clothes, they
would be helpful if we
brought them along,
don't you think? Suntan
lotion and lots of it. Hey
we're planning on hav-
ing totally gorgeous
weather down there,
while you guys have
lots of snow back here.

weighs about 30

check in. That's done
time to get on the bus.
remember we have to
get on the bus before 5
PM or they will leave
without us.

Finally, we pick out
our seats on bus three
and plop into them. Ten
minutes ’til we start to
roll, time to start drink-
ing. The bus ride down
was an adventure
everyone was drinking
and hanging out. By
being confined to a bus
for over 20 hours
friendships tend to start
and people begin to
bond. Though the bus
ride was long, PPC
brought a lot of movies
along so we could

watch them on the way
down. We watched a
little bit of everything
— Single White Female
to My Cousin Vinny.

If you decide to go on
spring break bring your
walkman and a lot of
tunes. It really does
help the miles just roll
by. Around 2AM the
guys in the back of the
bus started singing
everything from Big
Balls (AC/DC) to the
Brady Bunch theme
song. It was great, a
bus full of druken peo-
ple trying to sing.

After numerous
stops, we hit the Florida
border. Only a couple
more hours to go.

Yeah!!!!!! We're here.

Holiday Inn Panama
City Beach. The cheers
went up throughout the
bus. Check in. Get the
luggage off the bus and
to the room. Unpack
and check out the view.

The car, the time is
right lets get the cab
and go get it. Wheels
all right. Since Monica
and I had been on
spring break last year,

we played tour guide to
Evon, Dave, and
Danelle.

Where to go? That
was the question we all
asked that evening as
the sun was setting ma-
jestically over the gulf.

Spinnkaer, that's
where we would go. So
we all got ready. Styl-
ing to the max, I'm sure
you'll see a picture of
what we looked like in
all our finery around
here someplace. The
club was really hoping.
The cover was expen-
sive. It was $15 for un-

about going to one of
these clubs with a fake

ed over the years. It's
impressive to say the
least. A couple of
bands were playing
outside and the dance
ﬂoor was bumping. We
got home around 4AM
after meeting some
people and going back
to their hotel to party
with them.

Sunday dawned
bright and sunny the
weather was in the 80's
the entire time that we
were down there. Time
to hit the beach and
make a beer run to
Food World. Mission
accomplished. Hey lets
go jet skiing. That was
fun, Danelle and I
went. We got the big
wave runner and took
off into the Gulf. We

went about a mile out
and ran until our legs
fell off.

That night we partied
in the hotel with our
ﬂoor mates. The way to
get to know people is to
hang out on the balco-
ny and shout at the
people you see. By do-
ing that we made
friends with people
from Notre Dame,
WVU, Ball State,
Rutgers, etc..

Monday, we ended
up going to Spinnaker
to see Izzy Stradlin and
the Iu Iu Hounds. They
we good, but the con-
cert was shut down
halfway through due to
excessive noise com-
plaints.

The week was pass-

   

ing us by in a hurry,
one minute we had just
got there and the next
minute we had only a
couple of days left.
Monica convinced us
on Tuesday to go
through the giant hu-
man maze with her. It
took Danelle and I 40
minutes to get through
and validate our cards
at all four checkpoints,
while Monica and Evon
saﬂed through in about
10 minutes each.

With the weather be-
ing so great, we hung
around poolside for the
days, taking in the
poolside activities.

There were a lot of pool-

contest there was at least on
participant from Pitt. There
were marshmallow eating
contests, stupid human
tricks, best buns hun, best

Wednesday morning
Dave and I decided to take
off and go to DisneyWorld.
We left at 5AM and drove
straight through. It took
about 7 hours to get there,
but the trip was well worth
the drive. We toured Epcot
Center taking in all the
sights and sounds. We even
had dinner at the Nine

heart of the China World. It

did not have enough time to
enjoy everything totally. We

left at 9PM and didn't get
back until 4:30AM. Boy, was
I sleepy after driving all that
time. ‘

Oh no is it Friday al-
ready? Our last night in par-
adise. Let's leave PCB with
a bang and party at Spin-
naker. Time to pack up. Boy
is it getting cold out and this
rain. Oh, no it's a ﬂood look
at all that water coming into
our room. Better call main-
tenance and get some
towels. At 2:30 in the morn-
ing it actually snowed in
Florida. I tried to take some
pictures to show you guys,
but alas it was to dark.

Saturday, time to leave.
What's this, there's a bliz-
zard and the roads to the
North are closed. What
about us? Where are we go-
ing to go? Back to our rooms
that's what we did. Strand-

ed in Florida, a dream come
true. We heard that in Pitts-
burgh there was four feet of
snow and there was no way
we were going to home for a
while. We were on standby
as to when we would leave.
But that was okay for we got
some new neighbors, Matt,
Glen and Dan from Rutgers.
Within minutes of meeting
them we had the connecting
door open and were party-
ing. That is after calling our
parents collect to tell them
that we were stranded and
wouldn't be home. There
went that month's phone
bill.

Monday, time to leave. It
was a sad time we didn't
want to leave our new
friends but we had to. As
usual we were the next to
last group to check out.

On the bus again. We had

the bus ride from hell, for it
lasted over 30 hours. It in-
cluded our bus having me-
chanical difficulties and a
three hour wait while they
decided what they were go-
ing to do with us. The roads
had frozen over in Virginia
and we couldn't get
through. So we were rer-
outed through North Caro-
lina, and past D.C.. After
stopping at every
McDonalds from Florida to
Pennsylvania, we were
home. It was 5 PM on Tues-
day. It never felt so good to
lug my luggage towards the
car.

So if you ever want to go
on spring break, check out
Panama City Beach, it's a
blast.

I don't have a favor-
ite place to hang out.
because I am in Engi-
neering and I never
have any time to hang
out. I guess you can
say I hang out in my
room or the computer
lab. If I was in CAS, I
would have plenty of
time to hang out. I
would probably hang
out at the  or may-
be at the Union, but I'm
not sure because I ha-
ven't had the time to go
to either of those
places yet.

My favorite place to hang out is in the
University Honors College (UHC), on the
35th ﬂoor of the Cathedral of Learning. The
best reason for going up there is to admire
the spectacular view it has, both looking
East and West. It is best at night. This
spectacular view is one of the best kept
secrets at Pitt.

Hang out? As in spend time for
social purposes? (No such thing!)
I've found that I meet interesting
people at the computer lab — es-
pecially around 2 or 3 o'clock in the
morning. Other than that, I like to
"hang out" anywhere off campus!

When I find time, I like to go to the
Cathedral lawn. With a little bit of
homework, a cool drink, and a shady
tree the rest of my cares fade away.
There's almost always something hap-
pening there, whether it be a soccer
game, football or a few students playing
frisbee. In any event, they are all en-
joying, along with myself, the freedom
of college and the beauty of the lawn.

I don't really have a fovorite place to hang-
out, but I enjoy going to the "O" and watch-
ing all the different types of people go in and
out.

The best hang out spot at Pitt is
the Beehive because they have
"awesome" cheesecake and the
people are usually weird. It is just a
cool place to be, so you can meet
people of abnormal personalities.

In front of the Union. There's al-
ways a lot of people out there. It
seems that way at least.

Yes, it is that time of the year again. Shhh. . . don't say it. Everyone dreads registration.
After searching the course description guide we then turn to the printed pages of the
Schedule of Classes. This Pulitzer Prize winning piece of literature informs us, mere college
students, that we can't take that composition course and geology required for us to graduate
because they are offered at the same time. Great. Everyone has experienced scheduling
problems. We all ponder how to work out our classes so we can sleep in on Fridays after
hitting happy hour at Zelda's.

Nothing stimulates the brain more than waiting for your name to be called in the (brace
yourself, I'm using the R Word again) Registration Room. The office closes at 4:45, so of
course you get there at 4:44. Excellent timing, but the line winds around Thackery three
times. Once you get to the desk, its time to register for the year 2000. The lady proceeds to
tell you that you can't register until you've had your shots. What am I a rabid animal? Should
I call a vet? After straightening out the medical records situation, the lady behind the desl
tells you to have a seat. Like there is any. Ha! Finally, after getting several permission slipq

    
 

for the now closed classes you are registered. Wait until next week when you go throug

Advising Center

Most incoming students are assigned an ad-
visor in the school of arts and sciences before
declaring a major. The student must make an
appointment with them to register for each
semester. To do so they go to the advising
center, which is located on the second ﬂoor
of Thackery Hall. If you have an academic
problem this is where to turn. Advisors help
you with things like choosing the right prer-
equistes, suggesting study habits and picking
a major. The scene consists of comfy plush
chairs, tables and a scattered assortment of
schedules, ﬂyers and course descriptions.
Good reading material for insomniacs. Many
frazzled students can be found in these

’ chairs waiting for the chance to chat with
their advisor. In the cubicles in the back you can find intelligent and caring individuals who
try to help you in the best way. Of course, there may be instances when your advisor tells
you to take a certain class and you struggle through it only to discover it didn't fufill any
necessary requirements. But, for the most part, they will aid you in chosing the correct
courses and guide you to success. They give you the facts and they're honest. If you need an
unbiased opinion on academics opt for the advisor route before taking classes that will put
you on the 10 year plan. ~-

Required Classes

Must take classes. You know, those courses you must take before graduation. Each
major has their own set of requirements and the College of Arts and Sciences has several.

The purpose of the requirements is to give an individual a sort of liberal arts education.
Admit it. You wouldn't have taken that art or writing course, if you didn't have to. But,
some people actually enjoy these classes, for starters it adds variety. Instead of loading
up on science or history, one can take math or music and still get credit. Many courses are
not just an easy grade though. You have to work hard and keep up. The down point is
that sometimes they take time away from your other classes.But, are these other classes
more important? The required classes give you basic ideas and skills one can incorporate
in every day life. Also, one can discover a hidden interest or talent and study it as a
related area. Some even go as far as to change their whole major. These classes are
beneficial and shouldn't just be taken to get them over with. Choose these courses
carefully, for they could change your future.

The College of Arts and Sciences is Ad-
minstrated by a team of highly respectable
individuals. Dean Mary Briscoe and Assistant
Deans W. Eugene Deskins, Barbara Mellix
and Linda Burns along with others work to
create a school where the emphasis is on the
students.

CAS is but one school within the Uni-
versity, but for many students this is where
their education begins. The focus of CAS is to
give students a liberal arts education and to
prepare them for further studies.

Many of the educators who aid in these
goals have national and even international
reputations for their work. The faculty is

' active in research and graduate student train-

 

ing as well as lecturing to undergrads.

Another asset of CAS is the several publications they produce such as Ventures (a CAS
magazine), The Bulletin, Course Descriptions and the Schedule of Classes.

CAS has specific general skills and education requirements. The purpose of these courses
is to produce well rounded students. They give the student the opportunity to explore fields
of interest with out officially declaring a major. The College of Arts and Sciences wants to do
what's best for you. t

The Frick Fine Arts Department was founded at the University of Pittsburgh in 1927 by Miss Helen Cla
Frick (1888-1984) to commemorate her father, the Pittsburgh industrialist Henry Clay Frick (1849-1919?:
First housed in State Hall and later in the Cathedral of Learning, the department moved to the current
building of white limestone and marble. It was designed by Pittsburgh architect Burton Kenneth Johnstone
and completed in 1965. The style of the building is reminiscent of the Villa Giulia (designed by Vignola) on
the outskirts of 16th century Rome. The Library Reading Room was paneled in fruit wood and the elegant
cabinetwork was built by Italian craftsmen.

The building houses the offices of the Frick Fine Arts De artment, the Frick Fine Arts library, the
University Art Gallery, a Cloister, a concert hall, art studios, an classrooms. The Mary Schenley Fountain
(1918) on Schenley P aza in front of the Frick Fine Arts Building was sculpted b Victor Brenner and depicts
Pan hibernating in the spirit of Harmony. The fountain is one of a set of scu ptures erected to honor the
three citizens who created Schenley park (Schenley,Bigelow and McGee).

The Library Reading Room is paneled in fruit wood with elegant cabinetwork by Italian craftsmen. This
closed stack reference libra of over 70,000 volumes and 250 subscriptions is devoted to the history of art.
There is a stack core of five evels which hold especiall designed shelves to accommodate books of varying
sizes, including horizontal rolling shelves to hold a arge collection of double folios. The collection was
begun by Dr. Frederick Clapp, the first director of the department.

This library is a ve peaceful place to stud and not many people are around. So if you need a change
from Hillman for stu ying try the Frick Fine rts Building.

4 he Honors Colle

The elevator doesn't stop on the 35th ﬂoor! You must go to the 36th and climb down a
ﬂight. Then, you encounter the Honors College. That's right a college within the
University that offers specialized honors courses for students who excel in academics.

It is through this program that one may obtain a Bachelor of Philosophy degree. To
do this the student must fulfill all the requirements for his or her major and also a set of
courses set up by the Honors College.

To be in this respected group, one must maintain a 3.25 Quality Point Average
(Q.P.A.) and attend special advising appointments which help the student to choose
honors courses.

The college is hard work, but they have fun too. Several lectures are held for those
students interested. There is a lounge with an awesome view where students relax and
chat.

The purpose of the college is to provide an excellent education, while teaching
students to really think and broaden their horizons.

Students, who need money (don't we all ) to pay for college often turn to the government referred to as
P.H.E.A.A. After filing out endless paperwork to apply, students must wait an eternity to find out the
results. Finally, the letter comes showing that not only have you been cheated out of your fair share you
have work study. Actually, what it consists of is working for money that ou may use for your tuition. The
federal government determines how much you can earn, say $1000, an its up to you to find a job in the
Universit .

The wayy it works is after determining how much you may earn in one year, you must attend a seminar
held in the Union at the beginning of the semester. (Happy,Happy,]oy,]oy) Even if this is your fifth year
doing work study it is mandatory t at you attend. After going through what will be in your packet about 50
times, there is a stampede to the tables where your acket is. It takes a enius to determine which line you
need. Familiar sounds are ”Is this the line?”, ”No, t at is two lines over ’, ”Excuse me”, ”Ow, that was my
foot.”, ”Sorry”. You get the idea. After getting the said packet finding a job is easy. There is a list of
employers, job descriptions,requirements and wagers‘. Many jobs are in offices filing and copying, but there is
a diverse range of opportunities. Jobs such as wor ' g in a lab, to security ard are available. Once you find
a job that sounds good, and you qualify ( ay attention this maybe difficult call the number listed, ask for an
interview, and go. The hard art is actual y saving the money. Most people will use their hard earned money
to study the cholesterol leve in ‘'0'’ food and to check out the latest movie. But, college kids are suppossed

to be broke. Does $0.34 in the checking account ring a bell?

<3 oks, Books, Book

   

Do you remember kindergarten? Sure, ou do. Blocks, games, stories, and the letter people. Something
was missing, though. Books! As we got oldler and education got harder, we ot books at the beginnin of the
school year and returned them at the end. We wrote in them all year, then franticallty erased everyt 'ng on
the last day. We never worried about the condition or cost, then we came to colle e.

350 dollars for one book may seem a tad bit steep, but those thick me 'ca1 books can run high.
Some classes require up to 12 books. As you know, the cash total can even be larger than Visa’s credit limit.

Prices aren t the only problem we encounter when selectin our books. Can someone actuall
interpret those cards and determine where the CRN# is and then actualﬁr find the book? Many times it isn t
there. Then you wait weeks, when it was supposed to be there in two days. By the time you et the book, it's
the clay befc1><re the first exam, so you speed read 12 chapters while chugging a Mt. Dew, co ee and No-Doz
to sta awa e.

y Then there's the hassle of the lines and squeezing by one another to reach a book. The line next
to you always seems to go 10 times faster. After waiting 15 minutes, you switch lines only to discover it's a
cash only line so you have to go back to the other line anyway.

Finally, there's the idea that a $60 book sold back to the store is only worth $25, after only being
used for one semester. Hello, money doesn't grow on trees. There are a few ways to solve these problems.
Some peo le sell their books to other students. You can also sell our books back at Your Cam us Store.
They buy ack used books all year. To avoid lines you can sho at reek Street for used texts and °t Forbes
for Health text books. Often, Kinko's offers professor's notes or students. The rice of books is outrageous,
but everyone in college gets to have the great experience of owning a $60 boo , that was used once.

Language Lab

Parlez-vous francais? The lan age lab is located at G-17 in the Cathedral of Learning. People who are
,.taking forei language classes gave an opportunit to use the lab free of charge to practice speaking the
“language 0 choice. Generally, the student enters t e lab and tells the {person at the desk what language,
what level and what chapter they need. Then one exchanges their ID or an audio tape and seat number.
The individual cubicles are equipped with built in cassette players and headphones with a microphone.
Several language classes have an accompaning lab book that follows with the tape. You can record your
woice and replay it to hear yourself.
Several classes come as groups and use the lab. For people who's schedule doesn't fit the labs, dubbing of
tapes is available free, if you provide the tapes.
Another option is grammar practice using computer tutorials. The programs quiz the students on a
particular point and then gives a score so one can see progress.
Lastly, now available are TV monitors with VCR tapes for viewing sign-language. Several students take a
language to fulfill a general education requirement. The lab is an asset that may improve their grade.

If you are looking for a class that sounds
easy and can give you a few needed credits
look no further than the course description
guide.

Several one credit courses are designed to
give you credit for something you may enjoy
and use later on in life. For example, Judo, I
can teach you skills that may one day save
your life. Of course there are classes that
seem pointless or have strange titles. A pool
operating course teaches a student how to
run maintenance on a swimming pool. Hur-
ry, the lines for this class are gigantic!

Freshman studies is a class everyone
makes fun of, but it may do some good. It

' teaches freshmen some interesting things
about Pitt. Like, did you know that the Cathedral was built top to bottom?

There are also several music classes such as chamber music and harpischord. Or, take a
course in Argument, the Airforce today, Tension, Taekondo, diving, or even Western and
Samurai films. If you're feeling daring try Triathalon Training at Trees. You never know
when a class may be useful. If you ﬂunk out, pool maintenance knowledge could be handy.

Hi boys and girls. Today's new words are stress and procrastination. Can you say them? Good. Now let
me tell you what they are: .

Procrastination-to put off (an action) habitually till another day or time. Stress-physical,menta1 or
emotional tension.

Often these two go hand-in-hand, especially during finals week. People like to wait until the last possible
moment to study or write a paper. Wh ? Well, some people work better under pressure. Plus it's fun to
wake up your friend at 3 a.m. to ask t em for Feb. 19th's lecture notes. Here is a small tip: buy a word
processor or typewriter with a spellcheck, because when you are typing a paper at 7a.m. that is due at 9:00
you don't have time to proofread. As far as studying goes, all-nighters work. The essentials are to have at

east two other people so you keep each other awake. And food, you must have food, preferably chocked
full of caffenine.

Everybody knows the keys to reducing stress, but just to review they are: excercise, eating healthy,
meditation, and organization. Well these are difficult to follow if ou are the average college student. For
one, who can eat healthy with the food they are serving in the cafe. As far as excercising goes crawling from
one bar to another or ﬂexing that fin er to call Domino s is the extent of physical exertion and it's kinda hard
to meditate when your neighbor is ﬁlasting Garth Brooks. I don't know about you, but I'm lackin in the
organization department. So my solutions are to dance around laughing hysterically. Yeah, it soun s dumb
but try it, no one has to know. You can also splurge on a pizza fest with some friends or take a few hours out
to do some shopping. The irn ortant thing to remember is to take breaks and don't be grumpy. Your friends
are there for you but don't ta e you stress out on them. Good luck and have fun procrastinating.

R.O.T.C. stands for Reserve Officer Training Course. The main purpose of both the Air force and Army
R.OciT.C. is to train and educate students in a four year program. It prepares them for the military after
gra uation.

There are a few ways that students are approached for this program. First, there are interviews
constructed nationwide for scholarship applicants. Students sign up for R.O.T.C. from day one of their
college career. A second tactic is to talk to high school seniors planning on attending Pitt. Sometimes,
students are recruited from Pitt who are already students here.

In the Airforce branch, cadets learn skills through attending a weekly hour and a half leadership lab. Here
the learn how to march and lead.

reshmen must have a 2.65 Q.P.A. and maintain a 2.5 in the following years. Each cadet must also ass a
fitness test consisting of five events. Between the sophomore and junior year, they must atten field
training, during the summer.

Their activities include raising the Cathedral ﬂag, visiting vets, helping the community in service, ushering
sporting events, and a drill team and colorguard. T

The Army R.O.T.C. is similar, but there are three ways of trainin . Classes are held twice a week.
Mandatory P.E. is held at 6:00AM, three days a week. There is occasiona weekend training. During the first
years, no standard Q.P.A. is set, but a 2.0 is expected. They have several groups within itself, such as The

angers,Scabbard and Blade, drill team and colorguard. There is also a fraternity called Rho Tau Chi. It is the
first established in the nation. Other activities include Air Assult, Airbourne School and mountain warfare.

Academics

Many of the science classes at Pitt have corresponding lab sections. Certain Biology,
Physics and Chemistry all have labs in which the student is required to participate. The labs,
that are done, are designed to give a better understanding of the material covered in lecture.
Usually, the labs are once a week and last a couple hours.

Some people complain because labs are only worth one credit. A lot of work is done, such
as dissecting, reports and practical exams. People could take courses like Bungee-jumping
101 and get the same credit. In many students eyes this is an injustice. The reasoning is that
since a lab is only one day a week it deserves only one credit hour. However, the lecture last
three hours a week and so does the lab.

Another issue the labs bring up is animal rights. You have the right to not touch the animal
being dissected, but you have to observe. If you skip class, you may miss important test
material, but if you don't believe in it. It can be difficult for you to stand by and do nothing.

Aside from these difficulties, labs do provide a way to apply classroom material and
actually see what happens when two substances are mixed or the effects of static electricity.
Pitt may create the next Dr. Frankenstein.

Ode to Pitt

0’ Pitt how I have loved you so
Yet it is now off into the world I go

You have kept me well
Within the hallowed halls of which I have dwelled

You have guided and nutured me
Shaping me into the adult I am to be

You have given me a sense of kinship
With the creation of everlasting friendship

You have imparted with me a feeling of home
Of which has been cast in stone

You have blessed me with a sense of spirit
Of which one day the wind will inherit

It is now that I must bid you Adeiu
Though in my heart your spirit will always linger
