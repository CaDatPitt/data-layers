In the southwestern corner of Pennsylvania, two rivers cut down through the
mountains and meet to form a third. Four miles away from the point where
these two rivers join, there is a university which has, as one of its major claims
to fame, a forty-two story Gothic skyscraper called the Cathedral of Learning.
This is the University of Pittsburgh.

Around this building revolves the life of the University. A student’s education
begins at registration in its Commons Room, and ends at Commencement on
its lawn. Even though there are additional buildings scattered from the medical
center on the hill to Schenley Park, this building is still the center and symbol
of the University.

And the number of additional buildings for the University is steadily growing.
Langley Hall and Trees Hall are already centers of science and swimming
classes, and the sound of bulldozers echoes across the campus as a ﬁne arts
building is constructed in Schenley Park and a new wing is added onto a
medical center hospital. Plans have recently been disclosed for a National
Aeronautics and Space Administration ‘research center to be connected with
the University. The most striking project of all is a new building which will
span the formerly useless Panther Hollow. The major feature of this combi-
nation bridge-building will be the computer housed in its basement, the use
of which will be instantaneous communication with any spot in the universe.
Also on the drawing boards is a method to transfer human speech directly onto
magnetic computer tape. Once this process is perfected and the computer
housed safely in its basement, every member of the University staff from the
rank of assistant professor on up will go to his office at 4:45 each afternoon
and there dictate into a tape recorder his thoughts of the day. Whether he has
been thinking of Melville or molecules, his thoughts will be remembered by
the giant brain in Panther Hollow and thus become available within thirty
seconds for anyone who wishes to use them. The University will become one
gigantic brain.

University expansion and the burgeoning ﬁeld of space research have brought
with them greater emphasis on the sciences and graduate work in those sci-
ences. A graduate with a bachelor’s degree in chemistry or physics, unless he

The

Professors

A professor should be more than just a man who
stands at the front of a classroom and lectures for
ﬁfty minutes three times a week. He should be a
combination taskmaster, advisor, conﬁdante, and
friend. In his classes, he should be able to present his
material in such a way that it is grasped by the student
with a minimum of difficulty. His lectures should not
be droning discourses from pages of notes that are ﬁve
years out of date; they should be laced with current
material to make the student straighten in his chair
and think about the subject that is being presented.

A professor should be willing to answer student
questions, and he should answer them in such a way
that the student is encouraged to do additional work on
his own. He should not brush off student questions
as irrelevant, and neither should he use them as an
excuse to ﬂy off on a half-hour digression from the
subject of his lecture.

A professor should be willing to have his students
come to his office for private conferences. He should
listen to problems with an attentive ear and not make
the student feel as though he is wasting the professor’s
time. He should also, to the best of his ability, attempt
to help the student solve his problems, be they academic
or personal.

A professor should not forget what it is like to be
a student. He should remember that the student, on
the ﬁrst day of class, may not be even vaguely inter-
ested in what the professor has to say, and the pro-
fessor should attempt to make the student take an
interest in the course, be it through inspired lectures,
weekly papers, or fantastically difficult examinations.

A professor should be all these things, and the mem-
bers of the University faculty on the following pages
are those professors who have attained these standards.

DR. CHARLES S. BEROES: ENGINEERING

“Greater stress should be placed on the student getting
the material for himself . . . at the first meeting, sell the
students on the value of the subject and keep him sold
.. . keep courses as interesting as possible.”

DR. ROBERT G. COLODNY: HISTORY

“I do not believe in pouring facts into students’
heads . . . make them think creatively . . . let them

DR. HARRY FOWLER: PSYCHOLOGY
“Two important aspects of teaching
are motivation of the student by what-
ever method available and the use of the
question and answer method to force
the student to consider the material
more deeply and to see if he under-
stands it and can generalize it to other

fields.”

DR. MALCOLM T. IOLLIE: BIOLOGY

“Make the kids work hard . . . students can
only break through the educational barrier
by careful, thorough, meticulous work . . .
there can be no shortcuts to learning . .
trying to educate students is not all ice cream
and cake.”

MR. LAWRENCE LEE: ENGLISH

“Literature is a most useful revelation of man’s
nature—its pleasures and dangers; it is a non—sec—
tarian insight into man’s greatest beliefs. This joy of
being as reflected in literature communicates itself
to students when I do my job correctly.”

DR. EZRA T. NEWMAN: PHYSICS

“My style is one of informality . . . a teach-
er’s own personality comes out when he
teaches . . . try to relax the tension.”

DR. WILLIAM C. PANETTA: CLASSICS

“Homo sum; humani nil a me alienum puto—I am a
man; I deem, therefore, that nothing which affects man
does not affect me.”

MR. REX PEERY: EDUCATION

DR. ELIOT B. SPEISS: BIOLOGY
“Get the kids interested in the subjects . . .
arouse their curiosity . . . make them work all

the time—not just before exams . . . I always
encourage them to come into my office and

DR. CARL A. PETERSON:
EDUCATION

“Get to know the students well . . .
it is our mission to teach the students
first and not the subject matter .
the important thing is the student . . .
each student is individual and unique
and should stand out at his own
level.”

 

DR. COLIN C. STERN: MUSIC

“Try to elicit from the student an excite-
ment in a field that I am interested in . . . to in-
still an excitement in Western culture and
stimulate continued interest and the develop-
ment of a critical sense.”

DR. RICHARD C. TOBIAS: ENGLISH

“I would like students to be themselves . . . make
them think . . . many times I try to take a different
point of View to make them think and do some hard
work.”

DR. ARTHUR TUDEN:
ANTHROPOLOGY

“Encourage the exploitation of all
fields of cultural development . .
the wider the Variations, the better
the student will understand the prob-
lems of culture.”

The School of the Liberal Arts

Although many students use the School of Liberal
Arts as a stepping-stone to a graduate or a profes-
sional school, there are a great number of students
who remain in the school for their entire collegiate
education. It provides the broadest education of any
school in the University, and a student may major
in anything from anthropology to zoology.

Entering freshmen ﬁnd themselves scheduled for
a language, a laboratory science, English 1, and usu-
ally two other courses from the ﬁeld of social sci-
ence. By the time they have ﬁnished their sophomore
year, they must have chosen a major and completed
all their distribution requirements in the natural sci-
ences, social sciences, and humanities.

The freshman must quickly learn to concentrate.
A theme a week for his English course improves his
typing skill and, hopefully, his composition. He be-
comes bi-lingual through his memorization of the
Russian alphabet or his discovery that French verbs
are all irregular. Research papers teach him how to
use the basic elements of laboratory methods. He
learns not to look into a bubbling test tube, and dis-
covers the correct method of mixing acid and water.

One of the major hazards the Liberal Arts student
must face is the fact that Pitt has an engineering
school. He must learn to defend himself in bull ses-
sions with the “ingunears.” He has to be able to jus-
tify his ﬁeld of study and prove that it is just as dif-
ﬁcult and important as Petroleum Reﬁnery 121. If he
is a non-science major, he is often a man alone,
caught between what he believes in and a world
that is growing more and more technological. He is
taught to think, while others are taught to do what
they are assigned and not to ponder why they are
doing it. He comes to feel that people are rapidly be-
coming holes punched in IBM cards and that he is a
superﬂuous man in American society.

If he is to survive, he must realize that the world
needs him more than any engineer or nuclear physi-
cist. He is the man who, in a world balanced on the
knife edge of destruction, must keep his head among
those who are screaming for arms, men on the moon,
and bigger and better nuclear weapons.

The university is composed of scholars, non-scholars,
those who don’t know the difference, and those who don’t
care. Take a cross-section of these. They come in all sizes
and shapes, some appealing, and some fantastic. Remove
engineers, professional graduates, and those of general stud-
ies. Tire of differentiating, combine what is left—those who
know what they want, those who don’t and those who never
will. Result: the School of Everything Else.

Give this school a setting. Spread it from Schenley Park to
the Hill, for the man must be kept in shape through long
hikes to classes. Then exercise his alertness in a vertical
maze. Let him ponder over elevators of limited stops, and
staircases of questionable origin and termination. Give him
a central structure to revolve around. Call it a Cathedral of
Learning. Lest he forget that it is a cathedral, sound chimes
twice every hour. Pamper him, direct him for about a week.

At this time chew up his class cards in the IBM machine,
change his schedule, and declare him on probation. Then
send him on a treasure hunt from 1817 CL to Alumni Hall
to unravel the red tape. This trek will insure that the student
will know his university inside and out, and will be able to
assist the Information Office in directing curiosity seekers.

Liberate him from the narrow. Mix biologists and sculp-
turers in French III. Present the English major with the di-
lemmas of rates of chemical reaction. Challenge too the
mathematician with the prospects of American democracy.
Blend well the scientist and non—scientist; the realist and
abstractist. And the purpose in such contradiction is simply
this: to present building materials of all types to insure that
the organism will survive the most rigid of disciplines——life.

 

has deﬁnite plans to attend graduate school, often considers himself lucky to
ﬁnd a job as a laboratory assistant. A Ph.D. candidate in any field of science is
considered a duffer if he does not have some sort of government research
grant to cover his tuition and pay most of his living expenses, while graduate
students in the humanities and social sciences are forced to work on their
own and attend part-time classes.

The result of University expansion and the academic plums received by the
scientiﬁc ﬁelds of research work has been another lost generation. Amid the
clicking of computer relays, the rumble of bulldozers, and the quoting of con-
struction costs in the million-dollar bracket, the undergraduate still exists.

He is often confused, lonely, and lost, feeling alone in a world which is not of
his making. He may not be neglected, but he often feels that way. His ninth-
floor advisor ends his private conference as quickly as possible, and as the
student leaves, he imagines he can hear the computer whirring on the ﬂoor
below him. He ﬁnds himself in lecture courses with two hundred other stu-
dents and referred to by a seat number instead of his name. He is thrown in
with a group of strange people from all over the earth whom he does not know
and who do not know him. His instructors, pressed for time, often ﬁnd it
convenient to brush off his questions with a suggestion that the student
work on his own and ﬁnd out the answer for himself. His classmates begin
to form dormitory cliques, to join fraternities and sororities, and to become
active in student organizations. He looks about himself for something that
will provide an aim or goal to his life, for something that will give him a
purpose. This something may be a booth in the Tuck Shop, a girl, or a desk
on the publications floor, but, hopefully, he ﬁnds it. If he does not, he soon
learns that Pitt is no place for anyone who has a trace of apron strings around
his waist.

Although the undergraduate is the lowest man on the academic totem pole,
although he is often neglected, he is still the vital force which brings the
University to life, and this is his book. This is his story, seen through his
eyes, and told in his words.

The Schools of
Engineering and

There is a world apart from the University. Its build-
ings sit on the Hill, above the campus, and during one
week of the year its students participate in an organized
madness called Engineers’ Week. It is a world small in
some ways, but very large in others.

At some time during their freshman year, the engi-
neering students develop a pride and affection for their
Hill, and they begin to conceive of it as their home, rarely
leaving it to associate with the students on the main cam-
pus and in the “college.” Their years of education are
years of slide rules, briefcases, and laboratories. They
complain about instructors, high tuition, and compulsory
attendance at seminars, and deride the Liberal Arts stu-

Mines

dents as Joe Colleges who take nothing but snap courses.
Since their education is almost entirely technical, their
appreciation of the non—scientiﬁc students on the campus
is necessarily limited, and they come to feel that the Uni-
versity is one large solar system that revolves around the
sun of the engineering school.

But in their classrooms, this limited viewpoint is for-
gotten, and their world becomes one of entropy, enthalpy,
mass transfer, unit operations, and “What happens when
. . . ” The engineering students are just beginning to think
that they have all the answers, when they suddenly dis-
cover that there is a great deal about which they do not
even know how to ask the questions.

School of
Education

When a student in the School of Education has
reached the senior year and has a minimum of Q.P.A. of
2.5, he or she is at last able to put his psychology pre-
requisites to work in Student Teaching. For many, the
idea of student teaching is a strange but fascinating
idea, for not too long ago they were sitting in class
rooms glaring at fumbling, frightened college students
testing their modern book techniques in an actual class-
room. The outcome is usually different than the book
predicts, but the teaching experience and humorous
incidents of actual group contact is a discovery worth
the waiting. However, student teachers are not so old
that they cannot remember the tricks they played on
the unsuspecting student teacher; now it is with hesi-
tancy that they assume the same role of that poor
teacher. During this period two subjects are taught and
a participation in co-curricular activities of the cooperat-
ing school is expected. A student teacher may find him-
self participating in a school club program or engaging
in a homeroom conspiracy as the go-between to ﬁnd out
what the teacher would like for a Christmas present.

“Double, double, toil and trouble, ﬁre burn and cauldron
bubble” might well be used as the slogan of the pharmacy
student as he ponders over his serums, ointments, and solu-
tions. His lab coat pockets are perpetually stuffed with
bottles or mysterious mixtures prepared in lab. Not all of the
preparations, however, are medicine; one sometimes comes
across a vodka—orange juice combination, designed to cure
the common cold and whatever else ails you.

Pitt's Pharmacy School is relatively small and, therefore,
the students attending are a closely knit group, for the most
part. For this reason, the pharmacy student spends much of
his time out of class with his fellow students also. Three
fraternities—Phi Delta Chi, Kappa Si, and AZO—and one so-
rority—Lambda Kappa Sigma—have been organized. Non-
academic functions become an important part of the phar-
macy student’s life. These organizations hold parties and
dances at various intervals throughout the year.

Modern labs and equipment are some of the beneﬁts
shared by the pharmacy students. The pleasant atmosphere
is believed to have a strong positive effect on the student’s
work. A concoction brewed in a large modern lab usually
turns out to be a good concoction. When ﬁlling a prescrip-
tion, the young pharmacists are serious—minded and alert,
for they know the importance of putting in the correct in-
gredients in the right proportions. Some monkey business
occurs, however, in the pharmacy lab as well as in the other
labs. This accounts for the holes and stains on the student’s
white coat. These little outbursts are overlooked, though,
for it is usually recognized that we all have to let off steam
once in a while.

The School of
Dentistry

Edward I. Forrest, Dean

The year 1962-63 saw some important changes introduced
into the Dental School by its Dean, Dr. Forrest. Among these
changes is the replacement of a white lab coat for the former
beige one, enabling the dental student to look and feel more
like the professional man he is than a mechanic. New classes
have been added in the sophomore year in order to further
broaden the minds of our future dentists. Time spent in the
clinic has been lengthened to give the student more prac-
tical experience. And a new grading system has been estab-
lished, substituting letter grades for the percent plan.

Upon entering Dental School, the student finds himself in
a new world. He must arise before daybreak and present
himself at the Health Professions Building cleanly shaven
and neatly attired in a suit, white shirt, and tie. Dirty, bitten
ﬁngernails spoil the whole effect of the professional picture.
The dental student learns a different language which, when
spoken to the layman, sounds very impressive. He gains a
sense of maturity and a professional air, commanding re-
spect from his friends and colleagues.

A date with a dental student is an exciting experience for
any girl. He likes to have fun—to laugh and joke and make
love—just like everyone else. And at the end of the evening,
when he holds his favorite young lady in a passionate em-
brace, he tells her what a beautiful gum ridge she has and
that her overbite will never make any difference in their re-
lationship.

September brought its heat, its classes, its bonfires, and its football games.
The first pep rally, held just before the game with Miami University, was
nationally televised, and the students turned out in force. They brought ban-
ners and pennants which exhorted the team to win its game and their mothers
to send money. Coeds and cheerleaders swelled the throng, adding a touch
of glamour to the boisterous crowd. At the first football game, the exuberant
and optimistic students arrived early, in order to reserve a seat from which
they could easily see the predicted slaughter. The students’ enthusiasm re-
mained with them throughout the band’s performance and the pre—game ac-
tivities, then turned into a dull despair as they saw the wrong team being
slaughtered, and the disappointed faces began to dot the stands.

The School of
Nursing

116

Virginia G. Braley, Dean

The girl in the blue uniform with the large white buttons
is a nursing student. Instead of spending her days as most
other students do, she passes her time half in class and half
in a hospital. The classroom work provides the theoretical
knowledge for mixing formulas, administering injections,
and proper care for a craniotomy patient.

But no matter how much the student nurse learns in the
classroom, she discovers, when she begins to work in the
hospital wards, that there is no substitute for experience.
How to placate a cranky old woman Whose dinner did not
please her is a subject that is not covered in the textbooks.
And neither is there a set formula for curing a little girl’s
broken heart when the little boy in the room down the hall
goes home.

While the prospective nurse is still a student, she does not
live in the University dormitories, but in the Nurses’ Resi-
dence in the medical center. She has a room of her own, but
must keep up a running battle with the students from Pres-
byterian—University Hospital. She quickly learns that two
buzzes mean a visitor, one buzz means a phone call. She also
learns in a hurry that nursing is not what it is made out to
be by the writers of many popular television programs. She
discovers that not everyone in the hospital is an actress, mil-
lionaire, gangster, or sex ﬁend, and that she is just one notch
above the orderlies in the hospital social order. She is not
treated as an angel of mercy with healing in her wings, but
as someone who is to empty bedpans, change sheets, and
feed babies. And her ego is crushed as she learns that prom-
ising young doctors on their way up do not readily fall in
love with mere student nurses.

118
The School of
Medicine

The symbols of the medical student are his little black bag
and the stethoscope which invariably protrudes out of his
lab coat pocket. His all-white attire stands for the ideals and
purposes sanctioned by the medical profession. The pure
white does not stay that way long, however, for it soon be-
comes stained with blood and chemicals. The medical stu-
dent too, you see, is still a human being.

Contrary to the opinion of some, the cadaver is not the
medical student’s best friend. The student of medicine is,
often by nature, a very social being. Throughout the school
year various activities are planned by the students to satisfy
their social tendencies. Fraternity life is often a welcome
thing, for it allows the med student to break away from his
books and classroom tedium. It gives him the opportunity
to get together with his classmates on a different, more
friendly, basis than the lecture room and the lab provide.

The med student can sometimes be found in the snack bar
of the coffee shop, conversing with his peers over cigarettes
and inevitably drawn back to medicine. When the med stu-
dents join one another at mealtime, napkins and tablecloths
are covered with doodles of the central nervous system and
other areas of the body recently discussed in class. Patients,
also, are a common topic of discussion and argument among
these students.

The medical student, in his junior year, begins a series of
hospital assignments which enables him to learn the prac-
tical application of medicine. Then, after four years of med-
ical school, he is ready for internship.

Not too many years ago, a pre-med student needed either
money or connections in high places in order to be admitted
to medical school. Such is not the case today. Many young
men who would be qualiﬁed to enter the ﬁeld of medicine
are turning away from it and entering professions in which
the ﬁnancial returns come much sooner. Nine years plus resi-
dency is longer than most young people wish to remain in
school.

As a result, medical-school enrollment is lower now than
in past years. Social and ﬁnancial backgrounds are no longer
taken into consideration when a pre-med student applies to

medical school, and grade averages are not so important as
they once were.

The School of
Law

A crowded elevator ride to the fourteenth floor, a briefcase
that is ready to split along one seam, and a jacket and tie
every day of the week quickly become an integral part of the
law student’s life. He learns to divide his assignments with
others in order to meet instructors’ demands. He ﬁnds the
quietest spots to study and the best persons with whom to
study. The lounge on the floor below becomes the place to
meet his friends, discuss courses and assignments, and sip
hot coffee.

The time between his classes is used for last-minute prep-
aration trying to discover examination questions, or discus-
sing the merits and/or drawbacks of the several secretaries
employed on the law ﬂoor.

His days become one long round of coffee, classes, bull
sessions, more coffee, more classes, and ﬁnally the ride down
to the ground ﬂoor in the late afternoon, in an. elevator ﬁlled
with instructors, University employees, and a few lone un-
dergraduates.

His three years of schooling are in preparation for one
great event—his bar examination. He may approach it with
fear or conﬁdence, but the one thing he can be sure of is
that he has received one of the finest backgrounds in law
that this country has to offer. The percentage of University
law students who fail their bar examinations is extremely
small; there is only one other law school in the United States
which has a lower percentage of failure.

But law school is not all toil, sweat, and tears. There are
a few lighter moments, usually employed in trying to con-
vince outsiders that Blackstone Tort is not a student in the
University of Pittsburgh Law School.

Contrary to popular opinion, a Bachelor of Laws degree is
by no means an immediate key to a Cadillac and a ten—room
house in the suburbs. If the lawyer wishes to go into private
practice, he must spend years building up his practice and
increasing the number of his clients, with no guarantee that
he will be successful. He may ﬁnd a position in a private law
ﬁrm, but it is probable that, unless he is exceptional, his
salary and advancement opportunities will be limited. Like
any other ﬁeld, a successful career in law requires work.

The Graduate School of
Public and International Affairs

A student in the Graduate School of Public and Interna-
tional Affairs becomes more than a registered graduate stu-
dent; he becomes a member of the close-knit family of stu-
dents studying the bases of critical issues of modern times.
Language barriers and discrimination are forgotten as the
students gather in the Bruce Hall lounge to discuss the Cuban
crisis, last night’s Pirate loss, or plans for Saturday’s re-
ception for campus visitors. Smiles of “bella” are the re-
actions of a Nicaraguan woman to a New Iersey native’s
description of the annual Saint Patrick’s Day parade and
hearty laughs result from a foreigner’s experiences with
television commercials. By this combination of working and
relaxing together, these students are gaining valuable under-
standing for their futures in government work.

The GSPIA forum is one activity which provides a cul-
tural aspect for the student as he hears an expert speak on
the Common Market. A delegate from the United Nations
is guest at the Fall Assembly. And for first-hand experience
the student can visit Mexico for two weeks with E.S.D., or
spend four days in Chicago examining public agencies. In-
ternational law and the origin of foreign policies of different
countries become topics at bi-weekly luncheons in Interna-
tional Affairs.

In GSPIA the student becomes aware of the individuality
of each of his fellow students, yet each of his experiences
with the group of other students becomes preparation for
public and international leadership.

The Graduate
School of

Library Science

The Graduate School of Library Science, now celebrating
its first year as an independent professional school at the
University, has been inﬂuential in creating a new concept
of the librarian. The number of married librarians and the
increased enrollment of men in the school have eliminated
the standard image of a cranky old maid spending her entire
life checking books in and out and collecting penny ﬁnes
from forgetful youngsters. The librarian is now a college
graduate who is educated in the sciences, social studies, and
humanities. Coming from all ﬁelds, the engineer, the human-
ist, and the biologist all enter this school, ﬁnding opportuni-
ties to satisfy their interests.

The library student attends the Colloquium each Tuesday,
hearing a review of Webster’s Third New International Dic-
tionary of the English Language or a moving rendition of
Christmas stories. He checks the placement center and A-V
Laboratory for the latest on jobs and equipment. He learns
the Dewey Decimal System by checking and classifying the
numbers on license plates. For an assignment in Children’s
Literature he reads Winnie—the-Pooh, and in a course in cata-
loging he is concerned with documentary control. The Stu-
dent Organization provides him with the social activities of
a faculty—student luncheon or a swimming party at Trees
Hall. Whether he is scanning LiRiP for ideas on research or
following a map in the Bookmark by climbing seventy-two
steps, he is appreciating and enjoying his valuable training.

Because of his wide educational background and genuine
interest in people, he receives satisfaction from the personal
contacts he makes and the aid he gives. As he learns the
classification of rare books, studies the art of storytelling
for an hour, he realizes his importance in helping others ﬁnd
new ideas, in helping minds grow, and in communicating his
love for books.

Alumni
Board

In recent years, Pitt alumni have been badly treated.
But since the advent of the Alumni Association, the sit-
uation has been changed. The Alumni Association is, like
the rest of the University, dynamic and growing, working
with alumni, the Admissions Office, and students pres-
ontly on campus.

The major aim of the Alumni Association is to educate
Pitt alumni so that they will be able to assume a role of
liaison between the University and the friends and neigh-
bors of the alumni themselves. The alumnus should be a
sort of public relations man for the University, providing
personal contact between Pitt and those who are unin-
formed about University activities.

The Alumni Association works in close cooperation
with the Admissions Office by releasing names of po-
tential freshmen to alumni. There are 260 alumni repre-
sentatives in Allegheny County alone, and others, 172 of
them, scattered over the country in 35 cities in 15 states.

There are actually twelve separate alumni associations,
including all the professional and liberal arts graduates.
Each one of these separate Alumni Associations sends
three representatives to meetings of the general Alumni
Association, which are held ﬁve times each year.

The Alumni Association holds annual dinners for all
graduating seniors, at which undergraduates get a chance
to meet alumni from their own school. Annual smorgas-
bords and dances are held at Commencement and Home-
coming, and the Association also publishes PITT, a mag-
azine for all alumni.

One of the areas in which the Alumni Association is
trying to strengthen itself is in its relationship with stu-
dents presently on campus. The Association is attempting
to get the campus undergraduates to understand exactly
what the Alumni Association is, what it does, and what it
can do for the student once he graduates.

Army
ROTC

“Hup-hoop—hreep-horp! Hup-hoop-hreep-horp!”
The sergeant’s cadences echoed across the Cathedral
lawn and bounced off Heinz Chapel every Thursday
afternoon as the Corps practiced its marching.

But besides the drills, there were also the hours in
the classroom. The cadets learned how to read maps,
how to defend a hill with seven men and a machine
gun, and studied in detail the battles of the Civil War.
They also learned who to salute and how to salute,
how to polish brass, how to clean an M-1 with the
least amount of elbow grease, and how to keep the
shine on their shoes until Inspection.

The beginning of the year for the Heinz Chapel
Choir was marked by the annual Choir camp, at
which the singers tried to get back into form both mu-
sically and socially.

A banquet for all the members of the Choir was
held at Stouffer’s late in the second trimester, and as
soon as classes were over the Choir went on its an-
nual tour.

One of the highlights of the ten—day tour was the
stopover in New York, which was the only place
where the singers had more than a few hours free
time to themselves.

With the return to classes next fall, the Choir
hopes to recruit new members, along with instituting
a program of concerts at several area high schools.

Newman Club

The trademark of the Newman Club has become
the “Peanuts” cartoons on the bulletin boards. Be-
sides advertising the social affairs that are held
weekly in Newman Hall, the signs inform club mem-
bers and all others who may be interested of the cur-
rent projects and activities of the organization.

This year, the Newman Club hosted the club’s an-
nual convention and received the Bell Award for
Special Religious Programming on Network Radio.

Men’s
Dorm
Council

The transition from high school to college life is
often difﬁcult, which is the reason for the existence
of Men’s Dormitory Council. Composed of student
representatives from various ﬂoors in the men’s dor-
mitories, the council attempts to aid residence hall
students by presenting them with cultural, social,
and athletic activities.

This year, the council held open houses and dorm-
wide dances, along with intramural sports programs
and planning the use of recreational facilities in the
new circular residence halls.

tioned to strengthen communication among students, fac-
ulty, and administration. Kiski Day, early in the year, gave
the freshman a chance, through a program consisting of
swimming, boating, baseball, skits, and cheering around a
blazing campfire, to mingle and enjoy a last ﬂing before
classes began.

Shortly after, the satisﬁed expressions on parents’ faces
were signs of the success of Parents’ Weekend. As the year
progressed, Student Government promoted several other ac-
tivities, such as Homecoming, the Pitt Chest, and the Student
Book Exchange.

Perhaps the greatest accomplishment, in the eyes of the

 students, was the publication of a Student Directory con-
taining the names, addresses, and phone numbers of all un-
dergraduates, thus enabling anyone to ﬁnd the phone num-

 ber of the cute girl he met at Gustine’s last Friday night.

This year Associated Women Students, the women’s gov— .
erning organization, was a valuable aid in helping freshmen 
and transfer students to adjust to University life. Even
though the freshmen women might have complained as they
tried to recite the second verse of the Alma Mater for the 
ninth time that evening, the moving ceremony of Lantern
Night impresses upon every woman her duty and impor-
tance upon becoming a student at Pitt. Presented with a lan-
tern which was inscribed with her name, and a burning 
candle inside, she followed her mentor in a procession, hear-
ing about the glorious tradition of the University of Pitts-
burgh. Sponsoring the Freshmen Council dinner or a tea
for honor students, Associated Women Students promoted
school spirit and encouraged loyalty to Pitt among all women
students.

The Engineering and Mines Cabinet is the governing body
of the Pitt engineers. Composed of representatives from
every department in the School of Engineering and Mines,
the Cabinet is perhaps the most important organization on
the Hill.

The Cabinet members have a hand in almost every en-
gineering activity. They help to organize Engineers’ Week,
from the first decision as to what the theme of the year
will be to the ﬁnal scheduling of the arrival of Saint Patrick.
The Cabinet helps to publish the weekly newsletter, the
E&M Bulletin, in which important notices and occasional
editorials are printed. The Fall Ball and the Shamrock Ball
are only two of the social activities which the Cabinet spon-
sors.

Unlike the rest of the governing organizations on the Pitt
campus, the Engineering and Mines Cabinet has a strong
voice among the engineering student body, from setting ﬁnal
athletic schedules to-publishing the student opinion of the
trimester plan or the new probation system.

Publications

There is no activity at the University more demanding
and more rewarding than student publications. For any-
one who becomes engrossed in the work, it quickly be-
comes a way of life for him. The publications office be-
comes not only a place to work, but a place to live. A
member of any publications staff studies at his office
desk, sleeps on the couch, and ﬁnds the office a con-
venient place to start a bridge game.

The publications life is one of panic sessions and dead-
lines, crayon-marked proof sheets and reams of typed
pages. There is the weekly crisis, concerning anything
from how to ﬁll up a column to where to get a picture of
a senior that now makes his residence in Skagway,
Alaska. There are the deadline nights, with arguments,
empty pizza boxes, and overﬂowing ashtrays. The hi-ﬁ’s
ﬁll the hall with everything from Rachmaninoff to the
sound track from The Alamo to Iewish folk songs by
Theodore Bikel.

No publications office is neat. Even with the nightly
maid service, keeping the offices from looking like the
aftermath of a tornado is an impossible task. Copy sheets,
photographs, and proof sheets litter desks and ﬁll waste-
baskets, along with empty Coke bottles and pipe tobacco
tins.

Every University publication has a deﬁnite purpose. The
OWL is the book you are now reading. The Pitt News is
the campus information agency, The Pitt Capsule is a
magazine for pharmacy students, and The Skyscraper
Engineer publishes technical articles that will interest en-
gineering students. Ideas and Figures is the magazine of
the liberal arts, and the Polaris is a handbook that is use-
ful for both freshmen and upperclassmen. Working in
conjunction with all these publications is WPGH, the
campus radio station.

The cold, chilling rain of early fall arrived, bringing with it a return to classes
and a return to the rush and the scramble of the trimester system. It always
began to rain just as the students had to make the long, unprotected dash
from one end of the campus to the other. Everyone tried at first to get from
Langley, across Fifth, and up to 224 CL in ten minutes, but they soon gave
up as they discovered that the professor was always ﬁve minutes late. Despite
the rush from class to class, from exam to exam, from paper to paper, a lucky
few managed to find a few moments for themselves. Amid the organized chaos
that could often be called an ulcer factory instead of a university, the lucky
ones found an extra ﬁve minutes to view the art in the SU lobby or the
museum photography exhibit.

The numerous activities and facilities of the Student
Union were made available to the University Community
through the concentrated efforts of the Student Union
Board. Friday night dances were only part of the pro-
gram. The PM series presented Columbian singers and 
Columbian cofee, and Midday speakers tried to answer

student questions. Instructors who participated in the I 
Last Lecture Series presented issues that were vital to
the preservation of mankind. The Film Series kept stu-
dents from becoming bored. B

William Pitt

Debate Union

In the fall of 1958, the William Pitt Debating Union was
formed by means of the consolidation of the Pitt Men’s
Debate and the Pitt Women’s Debate. Since then, the organi-
zation has sponsored annual cross-examination debates, de-
bate clinics for high school students in the Pittsburgh, West
Virginia, and Ohio areas, and has published its own year-
book, Adventures in Argument.

More recent projects of the William Pitt Debating Union
include an intercollegiate debating program with over five
hundred debates, twenty-ﬁve major trips, and regular en-
gagements in the West Indies and Canada. A high school
program takes visiting speakers from six major universities
to sixty school assemblies appearing each year before some
forty-ﬁve thousand people.

Aside from formal activities, the debate union is com-
prised of a close—knit group of debaters who conduct occa-
sional parties for holidays and victory celebrations.

This year, the American Institute of Electrical Engineers
combined with the local chapter of the Institute of Radio En-
gineers to form the present organization, the Institute of
Electrical Engineers. The Institute is made up of students in
good standing with the University who are majoring in elec-
trical engineering.

After winning the first place for display in Engineers’
Week, many of the junior and senior members of IEE were
tapped to the engineering honorary fraternities, Sigma Tau
and Eta Kappa Nu.

Men’s
Glee Club

Begun in 1890 as the Pitt “Mandolin
and Banjo Club,” the Glee Club is
now one of the oldest extracurricular
activities on campus. The club sings
for the Chancellor's Reception and
during the spring. This year, the men
also sponsored the Intercollegiate
Music Festival and toured to Elmira,
Beaver, and Goucher Colleges. Half
the fun in being a member of the
Glee Club is being able to go on these
trips, since the aim and purpose of
the Glee Club is to sing well and
and above all to have fun doing it.

Quo Vadis

No one on campus knows more
about the variety and detail of the
Nationality Rooms on the first ﬂoor
of the Cathedral than the members
of Quo Vadis. These student hostes-
ses are trained to lead visitors and
tourists around the circle of Nation-
ality Rooms and keep up a running
commentary and lecture as they go.

To many outsiders, these hostesses
are their only contact with the Uni-
versity, which is the reason for the
examination each girl must take be-
fore she becomes a member of Quo
Vadis.

Women’s Choral

The white blazer with the University seal
on the pocket is the trademark of the Cho-
ral. The group is made up of women from
all classes, freshman to senior.

In addition to their concerts, Women's
Choral also attends a singing camp each fall.
At this camp, the singers are given the
chance to acquaint themselves with new
friends and new music.

Three times a week, the members of
Women's Choral gather for rehearsal in a
small room on the ninth ﬂoor of the Cathe-
dral. For several hours, their singing is di-
rected by Mr. Donald Colton, whose teaching
ability is evident in every line the Choral
sings.

Mortar Board

Mortar Board is an honorary for senior women.
The privilege of wearing the gold and black pin,
shaped like a small mortar board, indicates the
wearer’s outstanding achievement on the campus
and high intellectual ability.

At the regularly scheduled meetings of Mortar
Board, reading lists were handed out, and the read-
ing topics were discussed in later meetings. Sopho-
more and junior women were also invited to join
the discussions, in the hope that they would be stim-
ulated to pursue extra reading on their own. Often,
the senior members of Mortar Board were surprised
at the intellectual abilities of these younger women,
and developed a new respect for them

 

Twice each year, the big wooden key appeared on the
Cathedral lawn, bearing the names of the men who had been
selected for this senior men’s honorary. They were men
who had demonstrated that they were able to keep a suc—
cessful balance between activities and the classroom.

Omicron Delta Kappa annually administers its Senior
Award to the University student who most exemplifies the
ideal product of the University. This year, the award went
to Tom Olofson, President of Student Government.

Besides administering this award, the honorary also do-
nates money for the “S” award, which enables a University
student to travel, work, and study abroad. Luncheons were
held in the Student Union every other Tuesday, at which
important business was discussed and decisions made.

 Whatever the purpose of any Quax meeting, complaints
and discussions about chemistry lab or experimental psy-
chology exams seem to become part of the business meet-
ing. Quax’s activities of the year concentrate on deﬁning
women’s role in the ﬁeld of science and in each Quax mem-
ber’s particular science. Visits to cyclotron labs and dinner
meetings with guest speakers are means of fulﬁlling the dual
role of the woman in the scientiﬁc world.

Alpha
Epsilon
Delta

Alpha Epsilon Delta once again functioned with
great efficiency and expediency. Everyone knew
about scheduled meetings at least twelve hours ahead
of time. Times and places of meetings were deter-
mined by a system of maximum inconvenience. Ac-
tivities of the year included asking which ofﬁcer
would like to be in charge of publicity for one of the
planned seminars, desperately hoping to ﬁnd at least
one pre-med registered with the ninth floor, trying to
explain to Mr. Bodin why his seminar hall was so
empty, and depending on the officers to give the im-
pression of adroitness during the initiation ceremo-
mes.

Cwens

Cwens, the national sophomore honorary
society for women, derives its name from the
Anglo-Saxon word for “lady” or “queen.” The
Cwens on Pitt’s campus are the young ladies
who have demonstrated outstanding qualities
in leadership, scholarship, and service to the
University.

The members of Cwens work during
Freshmen Orientation, usher at Fall Convo-
cation and other University functions, and
are hostesses at Heinz Chapel services. Be-
sides these duties, the Cwens this year spon-
sored Cwen evening and attended the
Cwen National Convention at Allegheny Col-
lege.

Cwen’s aims are to foster leadership, schol-
arship, and service; to promote fellowship
among sophomore women; to encourage
leadership among freshmen women; and to
serve and promote the interests of the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh. Members of Cwens
must have a 3.0 quality point average, and
are chosen with respect to qualities of lead-
ership evidenced during their freshman year.
In this respect, Cwens is the women’s coun-
terpart of Druids, the men’s sophomore hon-
orary.

Druids

Druids is the men’s counter-
part of Cwens. The fraternity
is made up of sophomore and
junior men who have ex-
celled in leadership and activi-
ties.

The Pitt chapter of Druids
this year named Dr. Ionas
Salk an honorary member,
among several other out-
standing faculty members.
Among the outstanding mem-
bers of Druids on the Pitt
campus are Chancellor Ed-
ward H. Litchﬁeld and Irving
N. Rothman, member of the
University faculty and Direc-
tor of Student Publications.

and scholastic ability. Among the functions of this honorary

organization are the administration of the electrical engineer-

ing department’s Outstanding Senior Award, the awarding  
of a prize to the sophomore electrical engineering student

with the highest grade average, and an annual initiation ban-

quet. Eta Kappa Nu also attempts to promote and reward

excellent scholarship, while co-operating with other campus

honorary organizations.

Phi Eta. Sigma

Phi Eta Sigma is one of the
few honoraries which con-

who have achieved a 3.5 qual-
ity point average during their

earned a 3.5 cumulative qual-
ity point average during their
first year at Pitt.

Sigma Tau

At this University, there are leader-
ship honoraries, science honoraries,
business honoraries, and journalism
honoraries. Sigma Tan is the hon-
orary fraternity for engineers.

Twice each year, the names of Sig-
ma Tau tappees are announced in, the
weekly seminar. If the tappee wishes
to join the honorary, he is required
to pay an entrance fee, study a pam-
phlet containing information about
the honorary, and go through his in-
itiation.

His initiation is the most unusual
one on campus. He is required to
wear a railway engineer’s denim
cap with “Sigma Tau” printed across
the bill, and railroader's gloves with
“Sigma Tau” written on the cuffs.
Until he becomes a full-ﬂedged mem-
ber of the honorary, he is required to
follow the orders of the older mem-
bers.

Alpha Kappa Psi

Alpha Kappa Psi is a fra-
ternity for men in the ﬁeld of
Business Administration. In
order to recruit new mem-
bers, rush smokers are held
each trimester. A program of
pledging follows, after which
the new initiaties are wel-
comed into the fraternity.

Through membership in
Alpha Kappa Psi, it is possible
for a Business Administration
student to make important
contacts which may later help
him when he seeks a job.

The ﬁelds of business and industry are badly in need of   

qualiﬁed accountants, and it is the purpose of Beta Alpha
Psi to serve as a liaison between accounting students and
their future employers. The study of accounting is not only
learning the principles of debits and credits; the accounting
major must also be acquainted with a wide range of business
subjects such as economics, industrial psychology, and busi-
ness ‘administration.

Men who have proven their ability in these related ﬁelds
are candidates for Beta Alpha Psi, which encourages cordial
relationships b'etween its members and those of the account-
ing profession.

A professional sorority for women in the field of phar-
macy, Lambda Kappa Sigma is this year celebrating its ﬁf-
tieth anniversary. Its prospective members must have a
quality point average of at least 2.0 on a four-point system,
have personality and character, and have the endorsement
of ninety percent of the active members of the chapter.

Lambda Kappa Sigma is also active in the publishing ﬁeld.
Its publications are the Blue and Gold Triangle and Lambda’s
Tales. These publications are aimed at accomplishing the
purpose of the sorority, which is the advancement of women
in the field of pharmacy spiritually, socially, and profes-
sionally.

The Eta chapter of Sigma Theta Tau provides a partial
scholarship yearly to a qualiﬁed student in the basic profes-
sional program, and, on a national level, Sigma Theta Tau
maintains a Research Fund which provides grants for re-
search on the doctoral level.

With such qualities as leadership and an overall 3.0 quality
point average, the ability and intelligence of these aspiring
nurses cannot be denied. Although professional rather than
social in purpose, teas and banquets are also held by the
Eta chapter, and distinguished speakers address the mem-
bers at program meetings.

Greeks

U

6
1|.

Greek organizations on the
Pitt campus lie in a no-man’s
land between the University
and the Luna. They are offi-
cially under the jurisdiction of
the University and controlled
by the office of the Dean of
Men, but their houses are all
off—campus, and so is much of
their social life. Their pledg-
ing and initiation process is
carefully controlled by the Ad-
ministration, but their social
functions are often open to
the entire University com-
munity. The Greeks have also
had a token sort of control
imposed on their social af-
fairs, in the form of a no-
liquor regulation. While on
campus, most of the Greeks
obey this ruling, but many
parties are held off-campus,
with a resulting relaxation in
the observance of the Univer-
sity no-alcohol ruling. To
avoid the added expense of
holding social affairs off the
campus, the Greeks have
often attempted to have the
University alcohol law re-
pealed. The latest attempt only
imposed an even stricter rul-
ing. But, even though the
Greeks are an often-maligned
group of Pitt organizations,
they do serve a definite pur-
pose. In a large University, a
student often feels lost in the
masses that crowd the halls. It
is the purpose of the Greeks to
provide a group with which
the student can ﬁnd his place
in a giant school-city.

Interfraternity
Council

Serving as the governing body of the fraternity sys-
tem, Interfraternity Council works to create an atmos-
phere of cooperation among its members. Meeting in
the Student Union on Wednesday nights, the men dis-
cuss ways of increasing unity and promoting the gener-
al welfare of the fraternity members, as well as the
University itself.

Two of the big issues this year were rush and the
alcohol question. The Council was very active athlet-
ically as well as socially. Ranging from track meets at
the Field House to ping—pong matches, Interfraternity
Council helped to spark the good—natured violence
among the fraternities. Social aspects of the Council’s
program included a successful Interfraternity Ball at
Baldoc Country Club, and, in conjunction with Pan-
hellenic Council, the greatest Greek Week ever.

Delta Iota Delta

It was a good year for Delta Iota Delta. September brought
the new house and furniture. The physical education pro-
gram for the exceptional children at Saint Anthony’s School
got under way once again, and the fall pledge class of a dozen
men helped to strengthen the chapter.

sweat and struggle paid off. The chapter was in the black,
grade averages were up, and the new president and his ex-
ecutive committee had the house and chapter running

The extracurricular activities of the student body were centered around the
Student Union. It was a place to meet friends before or after dinner, to
lounge for a few moments before crossing the street to the Cathedral and
classes, and a place where the various activities of the Student Union Board’s
PM and Midday Series could be held. It was a place of activity. The ballroom
was used for dances, addresses, and singers. Its upper ﬂoors were used as offices
for Various student organizations, the University publications, and the campus radio
station. It was also used as a men’s dormitory, and the elevators were in constant
use during the night, as students went to and from nights on the town and study

sessions. But it was also a place where a couple could find a corner and argue their
differences.

Delta Sigma Phi was one of the big winners in this year’s
interfraternity sports program. The Delta Sig’s took ﬁrst place
in wrestling, basketball, ping—pong, and golf, while winning
second places in bowling, track, and football. The IFC all-
sports trophy was lost by only three points.

Social affairs of the year included the Sailor’s Ball, and the
annual Sphinx Ball for the sweetheart, plus weekly meetings
at the Luna, Chief’s, Fat Daddy’s, and Fox’s.

Both living rooms of the house were completely refurn—
ished, and during Hell Week, the pledges painted the entire
inside of the house.

Pi Kappa. Alpha

The express aim of the Pi Kappa Alpha Fraternity
is to promote brotherhood and have a good time do-
ing it. The year’s social events contributed to this
end. The Dreamgirl Formal was held at the Univer-
sity Club on December eighth, and the Spring Week-
end was held at Seven Springs on April ﬁfth.

The PiKA’s placed men in Phi Eta Sigma, Druids,
Student Government, and the Interfraternity Council
Executive Committee. The Chapter also took second
place in Homecoming and won trophies in several in-
terfraternity sports. The basement of the house was
remodeled with materials donated by the Mother’s
Club and work donated by the brothers and dream-
girl.

The national organization of Pi Kappa Alpha Fra-
ternity was founded on March 3, 1868, which makes
it one of the oldest Greek-letter fraternities. The Pitt
Chapter was founded on March 1, 1934.

For several years, the fraternity’s quarters were lo-
cated in the Belleﬁeld Apartments. Two years ago,
a house on the corner of Bayard and Belleﬁeld Streets
was purchased. Since that time, the house has been
improved and remodeled, with most of the work be-
ing done by the brothers themselves. This year’s
president and vice president, Bob Bryan and Dave
Garwood, continued the tradition in getting the broth-
ers to remodel the basement.

° One of the largest national fraternities, Sigma Alpha Ep-
 silon this year participated fully in inter-fraternity and inter-

sorority activities.
A1 h The SAE’s built their homecoming ﬂoat with Kappa Kappa
p a-' Gamma, and held an inter-fraternity party with Sigma Al-

. of the biggest Greek social events of the year on Pitt’s cam-
 pus. In the annual Greek Sing held during Greek Week, Sig-
ma Alpha Epsilon chose as its song “Standing on the Corner,
Watching All the Girls Go By.”
A Christmas Party was held after the completion of the
fall trimester. One of the freshman men, Ioseph Bensey, was
named to Phi Eta Sigma, the freshman honorary.

Sigma Chi

Traditionally, each year the men of Sigma Chi gather on
the shores of Conneaut Lake for the purpose of electing a
sweetheart for the following year. This year’s meeting at the
Oakland Shores Hotel was made more festive due to the
chapter’s sweetheart, Beverly Hodgkinson, who was nom-
inated by Sigma Chi’s national organization to compete for
the title of National Sigma Chi Sweetheart.

Also traditional are the Greek Week Exchange Dinners,
the White Rose Dance, which is the final rush party, and the
regular weekend parties. Participation in Homecoming is
also an annual activity. This year’s ﬂoat carried a giant
paper—mache facsimile of a roll of Delsey tissue, with the
slogan “Wipe ’em up, Pitt!”

Traditional, too, are the Luna, Fox’s, Mambo Leucidi, and
Butterball Sinceri. The entire downstairs of the house was
remodeled and paneled, and through some miracle the grass
was cut in the back yard.

In sports, men of Sigma Chi captained the football team,
the basketball team, and the track team. In student govern-
ment, Tom Olofson was president of the student body. In
social activities, twenty—ﬁve of the brothers were either
pinned or engaged.

Beverly Hodgkinson
Sweetheart

In its first full year as ZBT on the Pitt campus,
the chapter moved forth with vigor in all areas of
fraternity, campus, academic and social activities.

   Fall rush obtained the largest pledge class on cam-
pus. Matching skills with SDT created a beautiful
ﬂoat for the Homecoming Parade. The brothers
ranked second among fraternities in academic
standing.

In the winter, the initiation of 15 new brothers
and the election of a new “V” brought a burst of‘
new energy. In the area of social service, the chap-
ter held a party for crippled children with the
pledges of AEPhi and won a plaque for outstand-
ing support in the UMOC Contest. The year’s so-
cial calendar was full, but the crowning events
were the First Anniversary Dinner—Dance and the
Spring Weekend at Mont Chateau.

jammed the Commons Room at Registration, forced classes to overﬂow into
halls, and created gigantic traffic jams on Bigelow Boulevard as they crossed
to the Union at the noon hour. They seemed to be everywhere, and there

seemed to be no escaping them. But the moment always came when they-

seemed to disappear from the earth like lemmings. On these infrequent oc-
casions, there was time to catch a few moments alone in the Flagstaff Hill sunshine.
There was time for an elderly woman to read an article in the campus newspaper
that related the mass activities scheduled for Homecoming, and there was time for
a girl to take a lonely walk down a rain-soaked drive.

- The 1962-63 year at the Sammy House had many diverse
 events. Some of which will be remembered are: Coming to
a Pep rally in a black and orange car, the top out off, and a
palm tree imported from Florida sticking out . . . the dirty
 mind and similar food of Rosie . . . Gil Miller’s heroics in
killing a bat inroom 8 . . . the completion of bathrooms and
the unique stall . . . ﬁrecrackers at three in the morning . . .
 11 daily bridge games and weekly lessons . . . sudden AWOL of
Iimbo . . . Barry Hirshﬁeld’s dissertations on “How to get a
girl” . . . Dave Tyson’s sophisticated dates . . . the way Tyson
and Al Paulanoff let each other use their Corvettes . . . 150
dollar phone bill in room 8 each month, thanks mainly to the
daily calls to McKeesport . . . ]ack Herman’s friendliness in
taking hints on “How to run a kitchen” . . . daily pilgrimage
to Web Hall and all the friendly waitresses . . . Tippecanoe
and Kessman too . . . the ‘petite’ appetite of Howie Haber-
man . . . the beautiful renditions on the piano from the
“gross scene from Great Neck.”

Greek organizations on the Pitt campus are in a perilous
position. Every year ﬁnds another fraternity or sorority going
off campus, or another Greek organization in serious finan-
cial trouble. Each fall, the number of freshman rushees
decreases, and so do the number of new pledges. Fraterni-
ties are plagued by perennial rushees who pretend to be in-
terested in a particular fraternity so that they can attend the
rush parties. Grades of freshmen are notoriously low, and
the grades of freshmen who pledge fraternities are notori-
ously lower.

Problems of public relations also enter into the picture.
Noisy parties cause trouble with private families who live
near fraternity houses, and a brotherly quartet on its way
home from a Monday-night meeting at the Luna does not
add to the peace and quiet of North Dithridge Street. Frater-
nity men are derided by anyone who does not spend his
spare moments in the Tuck Shop. They are often looked
upon as playboys or docile sheep who merely ﬁnd a group,
adjust to it, and quickly fall into a typed pattern.

Greek organizations are also accused of wanting nothing
to do with the University. Supposedly, the fraternity men
and sorority women would rather spend their extra time in
their house or suite than enter into the larger social and in-
tellectual world of the University.

But there is another side to the story. In the last two years,
Greek organizations have taken a searching look at them-
selves, determined their shortcomings, and set out to cor-
rect them. Tutoring systems have been set up, more and
more Greeks are becoming active in University affairs, and
noisy parties are now either not so noisy or are held off
campus. Hopefully, the Greeks are on their way up.

Panhellenic

Council

Providing an opportunity for the sororities to
“air out their problems,” Panhellenic Council
again demonstrated its importance as the unifying
force between and within sororities.

On questions concerning policies for rush, open
houses, or ideas for philanthropic activities, sug-
gestions were heard from each sorority, and
through the help of individual chapters, it was
possible to make wise decisions.

As the delegates return to their sororities en-
thusiastically talking about the great, idea for a
Greek Week theme, planning the pledge reception
in Ianuary, or deciding the important questions of
what to wear and whom to ask to the Pan-Hel
Ball, they clearly show the aim of Panhellenic
Council——fostering of a cooperative spirit among
the sororities and their members.

A1 h D  P‘ The aims of the Alpha Delta Pi Sorority are to foster sisterhood,
p a! e a1 1 to encourage high scholarship, and to add to college life the social
and philanthropic aspects of an educated woman’s existence.

The Pitt Chapter of Alpha Delta Pi was founded at the University
in Ianuary of 1919. Since that time, the sorority has grown in both
size and renown. The honors that the individual members of the
sorority received are evidence of this fact.

Four of the sorority sisters were named to Mortar Board, three
were members of Cwens, four were senior mentors, and one sister
was elected to Pi Delta Epsilon. Linda Whitney won the Pan—Hel-
lenic Scholarship for the Pittsburgh area.

Beta Sigma Omicron

 

Wright, D. Fleming, M. Otterman.

 

The members of Beta Sigma Omi-
cron piled up another year of memo-
ries. Dee’s wine ceremony was one
of the highlights of the year. Square
dances and quick Monday night din-
ners added to the confusion. Dottie
forgot to get off of the elevators and
rode to the eighth ﬂoor of the Student
Union. Iosie played the ﬂute in the
Cathedral elevators and the whole
chapter carried signs to football
games and pep rallies. Picnics in the
rain and pajama parties provided a
social atmosphere. The National Con-
vention was held at the Elms. Every-
one ran to catch buses, and coaxed
Betsy to run. The year wound up with
Inez and Dee graduating, and Inez
won cum laude honors.

Besides fostering sisterhood within
their own sorority, the members of
Beta Sigma Omicron also partici-
pated in Pan-Hellenic and all-Greek
activities.

Pitt’s chapter of Kappa Alpha Theta holds
an annual orphan’s party each year at Christ-
mas, along with contributing to Western
Pennsylvania School for the Blind and the
Institute of Hagopedics at Wichita, Kansas.
Social activities included a Christmas Formal,
a Spring Formal, active alumnae parties with
alumnae from both Pitt and Carnegie Tech,
tea dances with campus fraternities, and par-
ties with other sororities.

Among the outstanding members of Kappa
Alpha Theta this year was Beverly Hodg-
kinson, who was named University Scholar,
Greek Week Queen, and was nominated for
national Sweetheart of Sigma Chi. The The-
tas also placed third in this year’s annual
Greek Sing.

campus, Sigma Delta Tau came to the Uni-
versity in 1950. The aims of the sorority are
to promote leadership, friendship, and char-

spirit of service to the University, while keep-
ing in mind the social development of the
women of Sigma Delta Tau.

“Let me entertain you,” the Tri—Sigs begged at

their skill by smashing a ﬂower-decked train into

searching for their own dance.

Zeta. Tau Alpha

The requirements for membership in Zeta Tau Alpha are
the completion of twelve credits at the University and a
quality point average of 2.0. The ﬁrst chapter of Zeta Tau
Alpha was founded on October 15, 1898, at Longwood Col-
lege in Farmville, Virginia. The sorority achieved national
status in 1929 when a chapter was established at the Univer-
sity of Manitoba.

The women of Zeta Tau Alpha built a Homecoming ﬂoat
in conjunction with Phi Kappa Theta Fraternity. They also
held several tea dances during the year. The highlights of the
social schedule included a Christmas party and an Orphan’s
party.

Gloria Storc was president for the year, Linda Kleiner
served as vice-president, and Marsha Colling and Elizabeth
Hall were secretary and treasurer.

Like most of the other sororities on Pitt’s campus, the
women of Zeta Tau Alpha live in their sorority suite, located
in 801 Amos Hall. The sorority colors are gray and blue, and
the slogan is “The Call of Zeta.”

The
Action

It was a big year for mediocrity. There were times to
cheer, and times to jeer. There were athletes who did their
best, and those who just didn’t care. The student body
seemed to turn its enthusiasm on and off like a faucet. There
were football games at which they were on their feet for
minutes at a time, and there were games at which they just
sat and watched either the Chancellor or the sign—trailing
airplane overhead. The coaches were carried off the ﬁeld one
week and maligned by sportswriters the next.

Final records followed the same pattern. One or two teams
managed to do better than average, most broke even, and a
few fared miserably. The famous quote of Pitt coaches,
“We’ve got some good boys coming up next year,” seemed
to have been forgotten.

Grades took their toll. Certain professors were seen by
coaches as sadists evilly chuckling into their dissertations
as they gleefully scribbled failing grades onto athletes’ class
cards. Other athletes who had been highly praised as fresh-
men or sophomores found, when the day of the important
match, game, or meet arrived, that they simply did not have
the ability to play regularly in big—time college sports.

But for every athlete who did not produce, there was one
who managed to come through with the right play at the
right moment, to make the winning basket, or score the
important points. Many of these were men who had ridden
the bench in their earlier years or who had been overlooked
by both coaches and sportswriters.

Since Pittsburgh is a sports-conscious town, the outsider
is often a major source of headaches to the University stu-
dent. He arrives on Saturday morning to ﬁnd his parking
spot stolen by a boozy baseball fan on his way across Forbes
Avenue to the ﬁeld where the stumbling Pittsburgh Pirates
once had their ﬂeeting moment of glory. On football week-
ends, the outsiders poured into the Stadium, paying ﬁve
dollars a head. The student, for his six hundred dollars a
trimester and seventy—two dollar University Fee, was en-
titled to a six-inch strip of bench on the ten—yard line, while
the outsiders took reserved seats on the ﬁfty.

The student who walked up to the Stadium for the logical
reason of watching a sports event often turned away in dis-
gust. He arrived an hour before game time only to ﬁnd fra-
ternity pledges roping off blocks of ﬁfty seats for a fraternity
with twenty-ﬁve men. If he stayed to watch the game, he
either had straight gin spilled down the back of his neck or
was hit in the back of the head with a Greek—letter sign.
Gung-ho cheerleaders exhorted him to dash down onto the
ﬁeld and form a tunnel for the players as they ran out of the
locker room. When he returned, he found his seat stolen by
someone who had formerly been sitting in the stone aisle
between the benches. He too often felt that Pitt sports were
not meant for him but for the faceless guy shouting ob-
scenities in the back row.

Convocations were
held once every tri-
mester. Each begins
with a stately pro-
cession of faculty
and trustees, fol-
lowed by the Chan-
cellor. The ceremo-
nies were always
conducted with
much pomp and
much circumstance,
and a fair propor-
tion of the students
took advantage of
the two-hour break
from classes to at-
tend these convoca-
tions. On the stage,
in front of the gigan-
tic copy of Lincoln’s
Gettysburg address,
the honors were con-
ferred and the Uni-
versity scholars
named. Small gold
ribbons were handed
to the chosen few,
and those who had
not been chosen
watched from their
chairs with expres-
sions of envy, deri-
sion, and a touch of
admiration.

The year began with the annual ﬂurry of optimism
and enthusiasm. The football team was playing its
usual hara-kari schedule, but ]ohn Micheloson was
said to have some of the finest material in the coun-
try and an exciting new style of play.

Early in the season, hopes were high. After an
opening game loss to Miami and George Mira, in
which Pitt’s pass defense had “more holes in it than
the Maginot Line,” the Panthers won two games in
a row against Baylor and California, and students
were forced to call it a streak.

But then the downfall slide began. Pitt was out-
played by West Virginia, trounced by Notre Dame,
where football had been de-emphasized, and shut out
by Penn State.

At the home games, rooters were treated to the
same old style of Pitt football. Off guard, off tackle,
pass, punt. Off guard, off tackle, pass, punt—the back-
ﬁeld ran like a record with its needle stuck. Students
in the grandstand made themselves as comfortable
as they could on the splintery wooden benches and
passed the afternoons away by trying to guess the
plays before they were run, a fairly simple task.

On occasion, however, there were real surprises.
About once or twice each quarter, Pitt would run its
famous double reverse that usually backﬁred. It had
worked well in the days of Iock Sutherland and the
“dream backfield,” but it was now just about thirty
years out of date. Opposing linemen had worked out
a solution. All they had to do was tackle both half-
backs, and Pitt was second and fifteen instead of
first and ten.

Passing was just as poor. A Pitt end or halfback
would be behind his defender, with nothing but grass
between him and the goal line, while the quarterback
was either throwing out of bounds or being buried
by a wall of opposing linemen. On the rare occasions
when the pass was to the right man at the right spot,
the receivers seemed to have their hands greased. The
result was that Pitt rooters cheered at any completed
pass, even if it went for a loss.

Watching the way the team was coached was like
watching a re—run of an old movie on television. If
Pitt had the ball within the opponent’s thirty, every
play was sent in from the bench. They were usually
dives through the center of the line——exactly what
the opposition was expecting.

197

Ilaw
In other instances, a second-string quarterback would
drive the Pitt squad eighty yards to the opponent’s ten-
yard line. The combination in the backﬁeld would be
working perfectly, every man seeming to know where he
was going and what to do when he got there. Then the
coach would exercise his superior knowledge and send in
the ﬁrst-string quarterback equipped with a series of four
plays to be run in a given order. Four charges into the
line, four pile—ups of twenty—two men, and Pitt would be
forced to surrender the ball if no one had fumbled in the
meantime.

The superiority of Pitt coaching could easily be seen by
watching the plays that were ordered in critical situations.
Pitt has the ball on the opponent’s twenty—seven, fourth

and half a yard to go. One student in the stands says to
another, “What would you do?” There are a variety of
answers. “I’d go for it.” “I’d try a ﬁeld goal.” “I'd pass.
They wouldn’t be expecting it.” But only the coach
comes up with the play that will dazzle the opposition and
catch them unaware. He orders a punt. Not a punt that is
angled toward the sidelines to drive the opposing team
back to their own goal, but a punt that is boomed into the
end zone and that the opposition watches as it sails per-
fectly over the goal posts, over the goal line, over the end
line, and rolls to a stop on the warming track, giving the
opposition a touchback and the ball, ﬁrst and ten, on
their own twenty. There are no boos from the crowd, only
a muted groan.

After the last bit of confetti had been swept from
the Stadium seats, the last empty Seagram’s bottle
dropped into the groundskeeper’s wastebasket, and
the last pom-pom ground into the dirt of Stadium
Drive, the football team’s record was ﬁve wins and
five losses. It was a mediocre season, but it was the
best record of any Pitt football squad in the last four
years. While the football team was losing half its
games, the soccer squad was quietly sweating out its
meets.

The soccer team did not lose a game during the
regular season. The only blots on its record were two
ties, one with Ohio University and one with West
Chester. Both tied games went into overtime, and
Pitt won every other game by a margin of at least
two goals. Robert “Corky” Cuthbert was high scorer
again, kicking in ﬁfteen goals during the course of
the season, two higher than his record of the previous
year. Close behind him were George Shimpeno and
David Reichenbach, with eight and six goals, respec-
tively. Pitt had seventy-six corner kicks against
thirty-seven for the opponents, and two hundred and
ﬁfty shots against their opponents’ goals, while Pitt’s
adversaries managed only ninety-four shots against
Pitt’s goal.

Soccer and football games often ran concurrently,
and, when the public-address announcer at the Sta-
dium would notify the crowd that “Pitt’s soccer team
has just beaten . . .,” the cheers were often louder for
the soccer squad than for the football team on the
ﬁeld.

The soccer team remained undefeated until the Na-
tional Collegiate Athletic Association playoffs, when
they lost to Maryland University in the playoff match
and to Penn State in the consolation match.

While things were going well for the soccer team,
the case was not the same on Flagstaff Hill, where
the cross—country squad was frantically trying to
look good during a season that had become a sham-
bles. In their ﬁrst meet, they managed to squeeze
by lowly Slippery Rock State Teachers, but in their
second, they lost to Ohio University by thirty points.
After that, it was all over. Although the cross—coun-
try squad had won its ﬁrst meet against a small
teachers’ college, whenever it came up against a
bigger school, something was missing.

p
L
201
The missing quality was either talent or hustle.
Against Penn State, Navy, and VVest Virginia, Pitt
could not manage to get under forty points, while
these three opponents never scored over eighteen
points.

Last year’s cross-country squad was made up
mainly of sophomores and juniors, who were sup-
posedly “gaining valuable experience." Five losses
out of six meets during this year’s season proved that
experience was not so valuable after all.

While the soccer and cross—country meets were
usually poorly attended, the crowds at the Field
House for basketball games were somewhat bigger.
No one really expected much of the basketball squad,
since the previous year they had won only twelve of
twenty-three games. But when this year’s season
began in earnest, they surprised everyone by winning
eleven of their first thirteen games, losing only to
Northwestern and Miami of Florida. Students began
to take interest in the team, and soon tickets to home
games became hard to ﬁnd.

By season’s end, Pitt had won nineteen of its
twenty-four regularly scheduled games, and had re-
ceived a bid to the National Invitation Tournament.
Shortly after, a bid was received for the National
Collegiate Athletic Association Tournament. The
NIT bid was declined, and the NCAA bid accepted.
Pitt went off to its first game of the tournament with
high hopes and dreams of glory, and returned
soundly beaten by New York University and Penn
State. Pitt was outshot, outrebounded, outdribbled,
and generally outclassed by its competition in the
NCAA tournament.

Although accepting the bid to the NIT instead of the
NCAA Tournament might have resulted in a greater
amount of prestige and a higher national ranking for the
basketball squad, the performance of the individual team
members was admirable.

Dave Roman, a newcomer to the squad, was high
scorer, averaging fifteen points a game and scoring three
hundred and forty—three points during the course of the
season. Paul Kreiger, one of the stars of last year’s squad,
was high rebounder with two hundred and fifty-nine re-
bounds. Brian Generalovich also played to the best of his
ability in every game.

As the basketball team ended its season, the gymnas-
tics squad began to work out in the catacombs of the
Field House. The result of all the practice, all the sweat,
all the workouts, was a perfect record. The team lost
every meet.

Last year, the gymnastics squad had managed to come
up with a split season. It had not been termed failure, be-
cause, in the eternal words of coaches, there had been
some inexperienced men who were up-and-comers and
who would be the mainstay of this year’s team. What

happened? No matter what the excuse, the gymnasts still
looked sloppy in the meets and, thanks to the NCAA
Tournament that was held this year in the Field House,
looked sloppy to coaches from all over the country.

The year dragged on into a dull, dismal winter, and
the gloom of the season was reﬂected in the faces of stu-
dent sports fans as they began to take a don’t—care attitude
about the course of Pitt athletics. The routine was the
same as every other year, with Pitt winding up in the loss
column in the greatest number of cases.

Except for the swimming team. Trees Hall Pool
opened early in the fall, and the new, well-lighted pool
with its clear tile markings provided an added incentive
for a team that usually turns in winning records.

The swimming team opened its season at Trees Hall
against Princeton. The Panthers were underdogs to the
Ivy Leaguers, and a spectacular squeeze win by Pitt pro-
vided the basis for another winning season. The swim-
mers lost to Maryland later in the year, but that loss was
the only one on their record. Unfortunately, students have
little interest in the swimming team. They follow more
closely the fortunes of the wrestlers.

For years, Pitt had been one of the big powers in
Eastern college wrestling. Rex Peery had trained the
squad well in past seasons, and, through his ability
as one of the country’s outstanding coaches in any
sport, had always managed [even with the worst ma-
terial] to make a team that would win. He had pro-
duced regional and national individual champions
and teams that had consistently ranked in the top ten
squads throughout the country.

But this year, such was not the case. The wrestling
squad ﬂubbed their season. Rex Peery had one of his
worst seasons as a Pitt wrestling coach, and for no
good reason. Matches were lost to schools that should
have been easy marks, and scores of meets were
closer than they should have been. Pitt just scraped
by teams that they should have ground into the mats.

The material for Pitt’s wrestling team was first
class and the coaching was the ﬁnest in the country.
Why should a team with this potential fall ﬂat on its
face? It is impossible to place the blame on Rex
Peery.

The teams in the minor sports fared just as poorly.
An outstanding example was the tennis team, for
whom thirteen was the unlucky number. They were
faced with thirteen matches in the course of the sea-
son, and scored exactly seven points in the thirteen
matches. They were shut out four times, scored one
point five times, and scored a smashing two points
in their last four matches. And this poor showing fol-
lowed on the heels of a winning record the previous
year.

The riﬂe team improved tremendously. After a
dismal, winless season the previous year, the riﬂe
team proved that this year it was on the comeback
trail. The team won one match. The squash, golf, and
track teams also decided to follow the trend. They all
produced losing seasons.

207

The course of Pitt sports seemed to be downhill
all the way until the baseball team played its first few
games. The team opened its season with a strong
team that stayed strong for the entire schedule. In
the course of the season, the squad won twenty
games.

The only incident that marred the winning record
was the fact that the Panthers were not invited to go
to the National Collegiate Athletic Association Dis-
trict Two Playoffs. The teams replacing them were
Penn State, Rider, Temple, and St. ]ohn‘s, with Penn
State sweeping the tournament. A popular campus
rumor had it that the tarpaulins which were usually
carefully spread over the Penn State ﬁeld by the
groundkeepers were removed on the rainy night be-
fore the double-header so as not to endanger Penn
State's chances of going to the NCAA Tournament.
There was also a rumor concerning the integrity of
the board that had selected the teams for the playoffs.
Be that as it may, the passing up of the baseball squad
by the NCAA selection board had a deadening effect
on the team, producing apathy and sloppy playing,
and a feeling that, for Pitt, the baseball season was
over.

Such was the year in Pitt athletics. It was not good,
and neither was it bad. It was only mediocre, and for
no single reason. Poor coaching, student apathy, lack
of desire by the players——it might have been all, none,
or any one of these.

Sheila Rinne

Joel B. Filner

Mr. and Miss
Pitt

]oel Filner and Sheila Rinne were chosen as this year’s
Mr. and Miss Pitt by a committee composed of prominent
juniors in the various schools of the University.

Mr. Filner was editor of the 1963 OWL and president of
the Pitt Foto Club. He also served, in earlier years, as as-
sociate and photo editor of the OWL, production editor of
The Pitt News, and as Tri Delt Man of the year. He was on
the SU Film Series Committee, the Ideas and Figures literary
magazine staff, and the Skyscraper Engineer staff. He was a
member of Pi Delta Epsilon honorary journalism fraternity
and was a charter member of AU.

Miss Rinne was student director of the Student Union
Board, president of her dormitory, and a representative to
the Associated Women Students Housing Board. She also
served on the AWS scholarship committee and was a mem-
ber of Mortar Board.

OW1 Hall of Fame

After the Omicron Delta Kappa Senior Award has
been given and Mister and Miss Pitt have been
named, there are still some people left over who have
been active in University organizations. These are
the people who are selected for the OWL Hall of
Fame.

They are also people who have taken the un-
glamourous jobs, who have done the dog work, who
often have had to sit by while others take the credit
for their achievements. They are the assistant editors
who keep their organization moving while the editor
is out impressing the students and the members of
the University Administration. They are vice—presi—
dents and secretaries who have spent long hours
mimeographing minutes and organizing programs.
They are athletes who have ridden the bench for
four years, watching others take the varsity position,
but still try out for the team, year after year. They
are minor editors who manage to complete assign-
ments despite the press of classes. They are the SG
Senators who do their best to represent their classes.

These are the people who have helped the ODK
Man of the Year, Mister Pitt, and Miss Pitt win their
awards. Without people like these who have been
selected for this year’s OWL Hall of Fame, no or-
ganization could remain active for long.

The evenings on the University campus were as varied as the students them-
selves. Those who could play bridge picked up a foursome and passed the
evening discussing Gerber and Blackwood. Some dragged their troubles down
to Gustine’s, in the hope of forgetting their problems momentarily in the
pleasant and convivial atmosphere. Others checked the University calendar
of events, and twisting couples in the ballroom found themselves being eagerly
watched by a small Indian boy tightly holding his mother’s hand. For others,
the pressure of classes and assignments weighed too heavily for them to waste
an evening. These conscientious students spent their evenings with their books,
trying to understand the method of balancing ionic equations and memorizing
French verbs. For them, it was an enjoyable evening.

For many of the stu-
dents, their educa-
tional progress was
often lonely. It was
long hours bent over
a desk in the poorly-
lit Commons Room
and lonely trudges
through the deepen-
ing snow to Carnegie
Library for a book
that the Pitt library
had not taken the
trouble to purchase.
It was silent even-
ings spent alone in

a room with the
snow drifting deep
and feathery on the
windowsill, trying to
read two hundred
and ﬁfty pages be-
fore the exam that
was scheduled for
eight the next morn-
ing. It was trying to
find a quiet spot for
some precious last-
minute search for
additional informa-
tion with which to
pad a paper. It was
becoming lost in a
textbook, trying to
assimilate in a single
night fifteen weeks of
knowledge. It was
often a lonely world.

The snow descended on the campus with suddenness and silence, whitening
cornices on the Cathedral and drifting down on abandoned motor scooters in
the Student Union drive. For commuting students, the snow was only an an-
noyance as it doubled their traveling time and rendered their automobiles use-
less. For those on campus, snow meant that all activities, except snowball ﬁghts
and snowman building, would now take place indoors. As students went from
class to class during the day, the snow made the walk from Langley Hall
to the Cathedral a nuisance. The snow drifted down the collars of their
jackets and dampened the paper in their notebooks, along with giving them
wet feet and ﬂu that later proved to be an opportune excuse for class cutting.

The art of being
a non-conformist

or why many perceptive yearbook
staffs prefer a very distinguished
publishing house

Retaining one’s individuality is not easy in
these days of mass production and stand-
ardization. This is especially true of year-
book publishing, in which mass production
methods have the tendency to force one to
buy just what the other fellow buys.

Making of soap or soup or salad dress-
ing by mass methods is one thing. But it
is quite another to attempt to produce a
creative yearbook by trying to squeeze it
into some pre-conceived mold. it just can't
be done that way.

The Wm. J. Keller firm brings together
highly trained craftsmen, the very finest
papers and ink of superlative quality. Add
to these a unique service plan built around
the individual school, and, finally, produc-
tion by the Velvatone process, which Keller
perfected especially for the printing of
yearbooks, and you have a truly distin-
guished performance. A_nd a yearbook with
singular character and individuality . . .
we call it “THE LOOK OF THE BOOK.”

The yearbook you are presently leafing
through is the product of the Keller custom
program. If you would care to see other
examples of “THE LOOK OF THE BOOK"
as produced by Wm. J. Keller, get in touch
with us now.

The clank of the
bulldozer was heard
in the land as the
University construc-
ted its new circular
dorms with the pie-
shaped rooms. The
dorms grew ﬂoor by
ﬂoor, and the build-
ings grew to be al-
most as high as the
wages of the hard-
hatted men working
on them. The build-
ings inspired stu-
dent self-expression.
The more artistical-
ly minded built their
own circular dorms
from scrap sheet
metal and old beer
cans, while those
with tastes closer to
the earth remained
awake into the small
hours of the morn-
ing, thinking of
names for the new
dorms that would
express the vision-
ary ideals of the
planners and the
new spirit of the

University. After
countless student-
hours of contempla-
tion, a few names
were discovered
that suited these
ideals to the highest
degree and were
nationally quoted:
Ajax, Comet, and
Bab-O.

there is a

bright future

in foods

. . . and this new Heinz Research Center stands as a promise of the growing world leader-
ship of H. J. Heinz Company in the ﬁeld of food processing.

Located in Pittsburgh, on the north bank of the Allegheny, it is the hub of the Heinz inter-
national operation. In its ultramodern laboratories, test kitchens and pilot plant, new prod-
ucts are born, new packaging ideas conceived, new methods of factory processing formu-
Iated.

Here research in the ﬁeld of nutrition is carried on—to be translated into more healthful,
as well as more ﬂavorful, foods for infants and adults. Here, with scientiﬁc exactness, the

It is an obsession. A drive to present in print an obvious self-
centered personality. A book reflects the common interests of
all the workers involved. But on the whole represents the in-
dividual and his personality to himself. Nothing is more
pleasing to a writer than to read himself in print. Nothing is
more satisfying to a photographer than to see his photos cov-
ering pages in a book. Or for him to compare and to compete
for a visual impression with another photographer on the
same page. He looks and judges: Criticism or a rare burst of

humility, in the form of a compliment, follows.

It is our world. We operated haphazardly, each trying to pre-
sent more of ourselves. Yet each resisting their egos for a
better product. The book becomes a chemical compound, the
molecule not resembling the individual atoms but having a

set of characteristics of its own. Or else it is defeated.

It is full of hate. The conflicts of ideas, ideals, and idiosyn-

crasies tear at the book. Much of it was strained through hate.

It is not my book. I acknowledge this.

Nonetheless, the University’s building program continued with even greater
vigor. As the dormitories neared completion, plans were announced for ad-
ditional buildings that would stretch from Panther Hollow to the Medical
Center. These new buildings would bridge a formerly useless ravine and
create one giant campus with the small engineering school located just on the
other side of the valley. Everything from ﬁne arts to one of the world's largest
computers will be part of the massive project. A NASA research center was also
included in the plan. But, after being subjected for years to the announcements
of new building projects, none of the students were inspired enough to leap
for joy when they discovered that Gustine’s was to be demolished.

The student began
at the bottom. In

the monstrous
school-city that is
the University, he
belonged to the low-
est rank in the vast
hierarchy. As he
made the long,
lonely march up the
Fifth Avenue walk,
he often felt like an
ant squashed by the
heel of the upper ad-
ministration. He felt
that he was on the
last, lowest rung of
the ladder that
stretched to the 40th
floor. But his plight
did not go unno-
ticed. There were
those whose job it
was to look down on
him, care for him,
and guide him as he
wandered through
the seemingly end-
less maze of his edu-
cation. Where the
clouds drifted
around the Cathe-
dral windows and the
View stretched for
miles, these people
met in secret con-
ference and decided
his fate. But they
did not make him a
pawn on a chess-
board, only a num-
ber in a gigantic IBM
machine.

The Tuck Shop was
without a doubt the
most crowded, the
least air-condi-
tioned, and the most
over-priced eating
place on the cam-
pus. It was also the
daylight gathering
place for all Greeks.
It was carefully
segregated into
booths, and every
Greek made sure
that he sat in his
proper booth, un-
less he wished to
circulate among the
sisters of the soror-
ity across the aisle.
It was the place to
go to find out the
latest rumors on the
tuition increase, the
starting time of Sat-
urday night's party,
and the location of
this year’s Greek
Week Ball. It was a
convenient place to
waste an hour while
the student was
cutting a one o’clock
class. But most of
all, it was a place to
eat lunch. The stu-
dent could eat in the
company of his chat-
tering classmates, or
eat his lunch alone.

For many of the freshmen men, Freshman Camp was their ﬁrst excursion into
the big bad world of college. They spent Labor Day Weekend at Camp Kon-O-
Kwee, and had an enjoyable time keeping each other awake and throwing
their counselors in the lake. The counselors were upperclassmen who wished
to do service to their University and also line up a few likely looking prospects
for their fraternity. Besides instructing the freshmen in the ideals and tradi-
tions of the University, the counselors also taught them songs, none of which
are ever sung by any students.

If a student elected to live in the dorms, he signed away his privacy for the
next eight months. Dorm living was one long round of shared showers, cafeteria
lines, hot water that never stayed hot, and noisy evenings. In the winter, the
eighteen-degree-below wind whipped around the upper ﬂoors of Schenley and
Brackenridge, and in the summer trimester, the muggy weather made it im-
possible to either sleep or study. Some students spent all their spare time in
the dormitory rooms, while others seemed to go there only to sleep. The rooms
were intended for studying and sleeping, but were used for everything from
bull sessions and political discussions to eating pizza. Men students were
continual complainers about their ﬂoor counselors, while women found the
curfew hours and the orders from the Twelfth Floor too restricting.

34

The dormitories were ordinarily ﬁlled with laughing, lively students who were
busily engaged in planning their weekend or joking about the day’s happenings.
On Friday and Saturday nights, the rooms and halls emptied as the students
began their evenings on the town. They poured out the Quadrangle on motor
scooters and in Iaguars, leaving the weighty problems of college life behind
them for an evening. As more and more students left, the lights in the dorm-
itory windows grew less and less numerous, and the halls seemed to grow
longer, dimmer, and more lonely. The downstairs lobby emptied, and the Uni-
versity policemen locked the Forbes Avenue door and turned off the lights in
the lower lounge. But no matter how many students left, there was always one
who was left behind.

35

37

The dormitories, besides being a place to stay away from, were also a place
to work. Beds were better to study on if they were unmade, and four walls
were easier to stare at if they were papered with copies of Miss September
instead of assignment schedules for Mathematics 23. Some students preferred
study sessions, but most quickly realized that the best way to accomplish their
ends was to study alone. Thus the moment of truth arrived. When the mass
lectures were over, the student’s grades were decided by what he had ac-
complished alone, over an open book.

The thought of the
cafeteria caused an-
xiety in any student
unfortunate enough
to have a meal ticket.
He was faced at every
meal with selecting
one of the various
overcooked bland
repasts. His next
problem was one of
ﬁnding the proper
type of knife with
which to eat his soup.
At times he faced his
meal sans spoons,
sans forks, sans
glasses, sans all but
knives. One distinct
advantage was that
he could usually
obtain a second
helping of material
which was knifeable
either in anger or in
self-defense. His
ability met the
supreme test on
Saturday night when
faced with tough
steak, tough lobster,
or tough roast beef
and tough to get
seconds, knifeable or
not. But, after meeting
all the challenges he
was reminded of past
battles by Sunday
night’s Foods of the
Week Review.

For some students, college suddenly took on a new meaning as they dis-
covered that certain Someone for whom they had long been waiting. And the
campus, with its long, tree-shaded walks and circular benches, was the perfect
place for this discovery. Here two students, usually one male and one female,
could sit and discuss courses, life in general, and each other. They pledged
their undying love and vowed to keep their promise when they were apart.
But more often than not, the ﬂower of their romance was ground under the
heel of a Harvard man with pipe and Iaguar.

Commuting students
came to the Univer-
sity by means of
every wheeled ve-
hicle that was
known to man-
kind. They drove
automobiles, rode
the buses, came by
bicycle and motor
scooter, and rode the
oldest means of
commuting to the
University—the too
hot or too cold, nev-
er-on-time Pitts-
burgh Railways
streetcar. But no
matter how the stu-
dent commuted to
the University, if he
drove it, he couldn’t
park it. The No
Parking signs
seemed to grow like
weeds along the
curbs, and in the
few places where
there were none of
these signs, there

were parking meters.

The city govern-
ment, swallowed up
in its greed for an
even greater amount
of revenue, had once
again decided to
ﬂeece the student.

Autos, autos every-
where and not a
place to park. Stu-
dents soon learned
that they would
have to arrive at
seven-fifteen in the
morning in order to
park within half a
mile of the Univer-
sity. Seven-twenty
was too late. The
vast cavalcades
moving in on the
University from
every point of the
compass soon filled
every square inch of
curb space. The
hardier students
brazenly parked in
front of ﬁre hy-
drants, at cab
stands, and in the
endless posted
zones. When it was
announced that the
last free parking lot
in the area, Schenley
Plaza, was to be pol-
luted with the ever-
present parking
meters, the student
body rose up in
arms. Such a plan
would never be tol-
erated by the stu-
dents of the mighty
University.

So the students once more shouldered their ideals and signed their petitions,
and rode off into the sunset to joust once more with the officials of the city.
Led by Student Government, they were conﬁdent that their plea would be
heard and that the days of liberty and free parking for all would return once
again to the campus of the University. They signed the no-parking petition
believing that it was meant to halt all parking meter installation on the
campus. They suddenly discovered that they had signed a petition just extend-
ing the time limit on the parking meters.

The advantage of a city campus is that it is usually the center of the intel-
lectual life of the city and all its cultural advantages. The campus of the Uni-
versity is so situated, but it is also close to an entirely different side of city
life. Not all the people who live in Oakland are young, bright-faced college students.
Some are steelworkers and housewives. Some are old men who spend their fading
days picking chewing gum off their shoes.

For commuters, life was one long ordeal. The day began and ended in a
fourth—hand automobile or rickety streetcar that rattled over the Forbes Avenue
potholes. The student often had to rise before dawn in order to make his
eight o’clock class, and, if he had a reason to remain late at the University, had
to carefully check the bus schedules to be sure that there was a run out of
town after midnight. He discovered that public transportation schedules were
meant for those who worked nine to five on ﬁve days of the week, not for
college students with night classes and weird hours.

Many of the stu-
dents were forced to
commute by means
of the many street-
car lines that ran
through the campus.
In the winter, the
heavy snow kept the
trolleys from meet-
ing their schedule
and kept the student
freezing on the
safety island. In the
spring, these islands
were no protection
for the short-sighted
student who had for-
gotten his umbrella.
And in the summer,
the cars were
jammed by masses
of fat old ladies with
huge shopping bags
who trundled their
way through the

car, elbowing stu-
dents and the motor-
man alike while
they declared squat-
ter’s rights on the
last remaining seat.
Students were
forced to pay one of
the highest fares in
the country for their
ride on the trolley,
and they found
themselves at their
wit’s end as the
deadline neared for
the annual Christ-
mas strike.

The more provident
students on campus
took care to find a
mode of transporta-
tion that would be
quick, cheap, and
easy. For some, it
was a motor scooter
or a bicycle. Those
of lower ﬁnancial
status resigned
themselves to walk-
ing for the rest of
the trimester. But
those students who
lived more than a
twenty-minute walk
from the University
had to either drive
or find some means
of public transport,
and had to put up
with all the incon-
veniences and all
the difficulties con-
nected with com-
muting to class. One
of the inconven-
iences was the time
lost commuting, and
the resulting short
nights of sleep. Thus,
when the com-
muter’s day was
over, hefound him-
self alone on a
poorly-lit street
corner, waiting for
the one-ﬁfteen
streetcar.

59
There were the masses, and there were the individuals. The masses ﬂocked
to all the sports events held at the University, and cheered or booed according
to the fortunes of the team on the field. They made spectacles of themselves at
any all-University function, while the individuals with something to say found
a couch in the lower lounge of the Student Union and met with students over a
cup of coffee. The individuals were quiet people, but their presence meant more to
serious students than the presence of the Penn State football team.

There was the noise,
and there was the
quiet. The noise
came as the team

on the court scored
another basket, and
the quiet came as
the seconds ticked
away in the ﬁnal
quarter with Pitt be-
hind by ten points.
The noise came as
thirty thousand
people rose to their
feet following one of
the few completed
Pitt passes, and the
quiet came to the
Homecoming Queen
and her escort as she
waited for the mo-
ment when she
would be crowned
by the Chancellor.
The noise came as
students jammed the
hallways of the
Cathedral in the ten-
minute break be-
tween classes, and
the quiet came as a
student pored over
his textbook on the
night before ﬁnals.

The fad of the year
at the University
was the camp11s
riot. The award for
the outstanding stu-
dent riot of the year
went to the resi-
dents of Fifth Floor
Schenley as they
used the Cuban sit-
uation to great ad-
vantage. The pam-
phlets and placards
began to appear just
before the noon
hour, and a small
picket line soon
grew to a full-scale
mob as sympathetic
students painted
their own placards
with such legends
as “God save St.
Peter's and the
South Side Syna-
gogue.” In the con-
fusion, someone had
the presence of
mind to call the Uni-
versity police to
make sure the pick-
ets did not get out
of hand. Second
place in the riot
awards went to a
group of enterpris-
ing students who
hung the sarcastic
campus sportswriter
in effigy.

The rush season for
Greek organiza-
tions began with the
registration smoker
in the Student Union
Ballroom. The eager
rushees quickly
signed their names
to the cards in anti-
cipation of the soon-
to-come free dates,
parties, and lunches.
The fraternity men
met them with hand-
shakes and the eter-
nal smile of the Pitt
Greek. The rushees
were immediately
subjected to all the
propaganda that the
Greeks could throw
at them in the
course of one night.
The rush parties
followed, featuring
the Limbo, women,
and, of course,
punch that was
guaranteed to be
non-alcoholic. The
rushees were intro-
duced to brother
after brother, and
forgot names im-
mediately.

Once again, Home-
coming was a week
of hurried ﬂoat-
building and house-
front construction.
The Greeks mixed
papier-mache by the
barrel and slapped
it on the ﬂimsy
chicken-wire frames.
Fraternity men and
sorority sisters co-
operated in the ﬁnal
hours of the rush
just before the struc-
tures were judged
by the committee.
Long hours were
spent on the moving
parts of the dis-
plays, and napkins
by the thousands
were stuffed into
holes in chicken
wire. The ﬂoats
were hard to build,
but were much eas-
ier to tear down.
The biggest problem
lay in deciding what
to do with the soggy
masses of tissue,
and tattered chicken
wire that remained
after the ﬂoats were
destroyed.

The Student Union PM and Midday Series provided University students with
an added dimension to the normal routine of their life. Columbian folk singers
brought their guitars and their coffee for an evening with the students. Inter-
national folk dancing groups, who also provided food from their native coun-
tries, gave the students an idea of the Czechoslovakian Twist. Foreign students
attending the University were urged to come to these affairs dressed in their
own native costumes. The coffee the Colombians brought with them was hailed as
greatly superior to Saga’s.

Studying was a lone-
ly process. It was a
quiet spot in a dorm
hall while everyone
else was out for the
evening. It was a
mass of open books
and note paper
spread across a
table in one of the
libraries. But no mat-
ter where it was, it
was always done
alone. The student
had to cut himself
off from the world
and force himself to
concentrate on the
black—and-white
squiggles on the
page in front of
him. For some, it
came naturally. For
others, it was like
dying or having a
tooth pulled.

Once upon a time, there was a man who was hired to be the leader of a
gigantic mob of students and teachers. This man was called the Chancellor,
and the mob of students and teachers was called a University. Now, this man
saw that his students wasted a lot of time doing things like registering, and
he saw that his employees spent a lot of time writing these students letters and
helping them register. So he decided to do his students a great favor and
save his employees a lot of work. He bought a computor. But the computor
could only understand numbers. It didn’t know what to do with names. So
the Chancellor decided to make all students numbers instead of people, and
everyone lived electronically ever after.

As registration ended, the grind of classes began once again. The first days of
classes brought assignment sheets and reading lists, as students tried to get
the latest information on each instructor and his grading system. As usual,
the last two rows of seats in classrooms were filled, and only a few dared to attract
the attention of the instructor by sitting in the first row. No one seemed to crack a
book during the first ﬁve weeks of the trimester, but after the first exams and
papers were graded and returned, students began to panic.

There were the good instructors, and there were the bad ones. The good ones
spent their time trying to get their students to ask questions and become
interested in the course, while the bad ones gave a dry, droning lecture three
times a week. The good ones made sure the students knew their office hours
and urged their classes to take advantage of office hours, while the bad ones
only made their office hours available when students pressed them for an
appointment. Fortunately for the students, there were more good instructors
than there were bad ones.

Any learning that was done at the University began in the classrooms. There
were classrooms that were equipped for three hundred students and sound
movie projection, and there were classrooms with one small table and six
chairs. The classrooms were never at a comfortable temperature, but always
seemed to be either too cold or too warm. Students either shivered or dozed.
While instructors were lecturing, students read the campus newspaper, drew
cartoons, slept, or passed messages to their friends. Much to the surprise of
the instructors, a few even took notes.

The trimester drew
near its end, and
the pressure
mounted. Some stu-
dents were informed
that they would
have to get a hun-
dred and twenty
points on the ﬁnal
out of a possible
one hundred if they
were to pass the
course. All-night
study sessions be-
came a matter of
habit as papers fell
due, and the clicking
of typewriters

could be heard at
any hour of the day
or night. The exam
schedule was made
up by a computor
which had been
programmed to
schedule the exam-
inations on a system
of maximum incon-
venience.

83
For anyone with enough credits and the proper distribution requirements, the
last, ﬁnal day was Commencement Day. It was a dark, drizzly morning, and
everyone’s mortar board seemed just a little wilted by the light rain and the
humidity. After sitting through a speech of dubious merit that was given by
a government official, the degrees were granted. For an hour and a half, the
Chancellor conferred on the graduating class the rights and responsibilities

appertaining to the degrees. Then it was finished, and the graduates hurried
to the Bookstore for their ten dollars.

The Thomas C.
Vrana Photography
Award is given each
year to a student
who has produced
outstanding work

in the field of photog-
raphy. Photography
lies on the border-
line between the sci-
ences and the arts.
An exact knowledge
of chemical pro-
cesses is needed in
the developing of the
ﬁlm, while the
photographer must
use his artistic
abilities in printing
and composition.
The photography on
these pages was the
work of Margie
Nichols, winner of
this year’s Vrana
Award.

The Chancellor is an image of many forms. He is the
welcomer of the anxious freshmen. He is the man ac-
claimed in national newspapers and magazines, yet the
man who may unexpectedly appear in the unorganized
frenzy of a quadrangle pep rally to shout friendly en-
couragement. He is the gold—robed man at the very end
of the convocation procession for whom students watch
with sophisticated awe, yet he is the man in the press box
above the football field who causes the students to rise
and turn with rowdy delight and somewhat frantic sa-

The
Chancellor

lutes. He is the man who can speak authoritatively to a
board of directors or talk cordially with a student and
his parents during Parents’ Week—End. He is the man who
extends innumerable and carefully worded greetings and
challenges in university publications, yet the man who
may leave the notes of a prepared speech to speak with
frank and concerned enthusiasm about his hopes for the
University. At last, in June, he is the man who stands
before the graduating seniors, presenting the problems
that await the graduating class.

  

When a student at the University is perplexed by a
dilemma, he often stares in disbelief at the seeming
chaos around him and wonders if there is someone,
somewhere, who has some sort of control over the sur-
rounding confusion. If he looks long enough and hard
enough, he discovers that that someone does exist.

Dr. Ranl<in’s office, on the first ﬂoor, is the only room
in the first ﬁve stories of the Cathedral that is equipped
with Venetian blinds, and any student entering his
office is impressed by the provincial furniture and the
psychiatrist’s couch.

Dr. Crafts’ office is located on the eighth floor, directly
across from the University computer, and his modern
office is carefully shielded by its glass doors, which
swing open on aluminum hinges. His office is also the
headquarters of the fraternity advisor. Any women with
problems are invited to discuss them in the pleasant
Victorian atmosphere of Miss Rush’s office.
