ongratulations on your graduation

from the University of Pittsburgh!

This collection of essays and photos

by your fellow students will keep
memories of your Pitt experiences alive for years
to come. Your Student Government Board and
the Office of the Chancellor have partnered
to produce this keepsake of impressions for
the Class of 2006.

As you look to the future, remember you are
entering a world that needs the knowledge,
talents, and skills you developed at the
University of Pittsburgh. Your formal credentials
will reveal some of your achievements. But many
of the truly significant talents you nurtured here
will not be apparent from your transcript: the
ability to analyze problems and think critically,
to gather and synthesize information using an
array of tools, to work in teams, to “walk in
another’s shoes,” and to continue to learn and
to grow—every day in every way. These lasting
benefits of your Pitt education will remain with
you throughout your life and will pay lasting
dividends, both to you and to society.

MESSAGE
FROM THE
CHANCELLOR

As you meet new challenges and pursue new
opportunities, please remember that you always
will be a part of the University of Pittsburgh.
Our extended family of former students—Pitt
alumni—can be found throughout the United
States and in most nations across the globe.
We invite you to stay connected and continue to
be involved in your University by participating in
Pitt alumni programs and events. lt’s rewarding,
it’s fun, and it is one of the best ways to
continue building the talents and skills that
are the product of your Pitt education.

Your alma mater forever will be a part of your
life, and we hope you will join us as we build
further on the proud legacy that belongs to the
University of Pittsburgh—and to you. Best of
luck in everything that you do, and hail to Pitt!

REFLECTION

uring the past four years at the

University of Pittsburgh, we were able

to share many experiences that we

will hold close to our hearts in the
years to come. We've seen the University
expand, watched students give it their all, and
worked together in response to events in the
world around us.

Several new buildings have been added to the
University in the past four years to improve
the quality of student life. In 2002, the John M.
and Gertrude E. Petersen Events Center was
completed. lts uses are countless. Students

to eat, or watch a basketball game. Another
addition, Pennsylvania Hall, was completed
in 2004. It is located on upper campus and
houses 420 students.

In 2003, Larry Fitzgerald showed everyone
that hard work and dedication could pay off.
He ended his season with 92 receptions and
22 touchdown catches. He currently plays for
the NFL’s Arizona Cardinals.

Besides life on campus, things were going
on in the world around us. In November 2004,
a record number of students turned out to vote
in the presidential election, and George W. Bush
was re-elected.

Later in 2005, students felt the devastating
effects of Hurricane Katrina. The storm ripped
through Louisiana and Mississippi, destroying
just about everything in its reach. Although they
were more than 1,000 miles away, student
organizations at Pitt held blood drives and
fundraisers to help victims of this disaster.

There are many other significant memories
that Pitt students experienced. As we travel the
journey through life, we will never forget them.
Congratulations, Class of 2006!

PAST AND
PRESENT

t is easy to forget the University of
Pittsburgh's humble beginnings as you walk
past the lofty Cathedral of Learning in the
bustling world of today’s students. In 1787,
Hugh Henry Brackenridge founded the University
in a log cabin. From its first few buildings,
most of which are now historical landmarks,
Pitt has evolved into an integral part of the city.

However, the University of Pittsburgh’s build-
ings and campus are not nearly as impressive
as its graduates and faculty. Since its founding,

Jonas Salk gives the vaccine to a child as part
of a field trial at a Pittsburgh elementary school

 j_ V   :
The Cathedral of Learning during construction

the University has served as home to many firsts
and several medical and scientific breakthroughs.

In 1955, Pitt researcher Jonas Salk and his
team developed a successful vaccine for polio.
The vaccine has nearly eliminated the once-
deadly virus, and its development marked
the beginning of the University’s reputation
as a leader in research. Today, Pitt is a member
of the Association of American Universities,

a group of 62 leading research schools in
North America.

Currently, the University of Pittsburgh serves

about 33,000 students. It has expanded

its educational resources to campuses in
Bradford, Greensburg, Johnstown, and Titusville,
and continues to grow, as new and modern
facilities are constructed in Oakland and the
regional campuses.

from the bustle of Oakland. The Cathedral also
contains 26 Nationality Rooms, each decorated
to represent a different heritage. Visitors may
view the rooms through tours, but there is noth-
ing like having a class in one to fully experience
the culture.

The Cathedral was constructed to be more than
an elaborate schoolhouse. It also serves as a
touchstone of pride for Pitt alumni and students.

lthough there are many excellent

study abroad programs offered at the

University of Pittsburgh, Pitt students

only need to travel as far as the
Cathedral of Learning and up a flight of stairs
to experience a wide range of cultures.
Surrounding the Cathedral’s Commons Room,
situated on the first and third floors, are the
Nationality Rooms.

The rooms were created under former

Chancellor John Bowman, who wanted to add

a distinctive aspect to his newly-built education
facility. In order to highlight the rich cultural
heritage of the Pittsburgh area, he decided to
work with the various nationalities inhabiting
the region. Nationality committees formed to
collect artifacts that represented each cu|ture’s
respective homeland.

Indian Room

 

 

The first rooms, including the Scottish,
Russian, Swedish, and German rooms were
finished in 1938. The most recent is the Indian
Room, which was dedicated in 2000. There are
currently 26 rooms and there are plans to
add eight more, including the Turkish, Danish,
and Swiss rooms.

Students are not the only ones who get to
experience the culture within the Cathedral
walls. The Nationality Rooms are open for
public tours led by Quo Vadis, a student group
at Pitt that was started in 1944. Students in
this group have studied each room in detail
and have created unique tours that can be
based on the interests or age of visitors. Each
year, more than 30,000 visitors from near and
far come to view this beautiful and historic
tribute to the diversity found at the University
and in the city of Pittsburgh.

much to offer with its diverse neighborhoods,
and there are many activities that are just
a short bus ride away.
For instance, downtown Pittsburgh is filled
with mesmerizing skyscrapers, such as
One Oxford Center and the stately glass castle
of PPG Place. Also downtown are the Byham
Theatre, the Benedum Center, and Heinz Hall.
These facilities offer opportunities to see
Broadway musicals, dance performances,

can catch a baseball game at PNC Park or a
football game, either pro or collegiate, at Heinz
Field. The confluence of the city’s three rivers,
located near the baseball and football stadiums,
is part of the magnificent view from atop the
Duquesnelncnne.

Another short bus ride away from the
University is the city’s South Side. This area is
known for its hip boutiques, pubs, and unique
galleries. Also located here is the recently built
SouthSide Works Cinema, which boasts stadium
seating and 10 screens. The Cheesecake Factory,
an upscale casual dining restaurant, is among
other newer attractions.

Although there are other areas that interest
students, such as Squirrel Hill, Shadyside, and
Station Square, the campus itself is full of variety.
University-owned buildings are scattered between
medical facilities, local businesses, and neighbor-
ing homes. From its world-renowned medical cen-
ters to its eclectic culture, Pittsburgh certainly
offers a world of opportunities and adventure.

ome to the University of Pittsburgh,
Oakland contains a diverse mix of
sights and sounds. During the day,
the area is busy with people bustling
about by foot, car, bike, or bus. By night,
darkness transforms the same area, accenting
and magnifying the neon lights of shops and
restaurants, which stand against the background
of the illuminated Cathedral of Learning.
Oakland also provides a cultural center of
which students can take daily advantage. Within
walking distance from campus are the Carnegie

Museums of Art and Natural History as well as

the Phipps Conservatory and Botanical Gardens.

Other student hot spots include areas for dining
and socializing. Among those most popular
are The Original Hot Dog Shop, Kiva Han, and
Joe Mama's Italian Deluxe.

Apart from everything there is to do, the
architecture is also a special feature of Oakland.
A mix of aging high—rises and newer buildings
splashed with color enhance Pittsburgh’s land— _
scape with their unique charm.

In addition to college students, Oakland’s
streets are filled with neighboring residents and
the people who work for the area’s numerous
hospitals and businesses.

in such a diverse community, learning takes
place by default. Whether it is walking along
the Oakland streets with friends or relaxing
in Schenley Park, there is always something to
do or see. A fluid and dynamic place, Oakland
is a reflection of the people who enjoy all it
has to offer.

fter a few weeks of using nothing but
meal blocks, many students at the
University of Pittsburgh venture out to
find other places to eat. Yes, the taco
salad at Eddie’s Cafe is fantastic and the
Marketplace is always worth a stop for brunch,
but sooner or later, everyone needs a change.

Luckily, there is an answer. The many
restaurants located throughout Oakland
virtually guarantee a satisfied appetite, and
there is something for everyone.

lndia Garden is a wonderful place to go to
enjoy authentic Indian food, and Joe Mama’s
Italian Deluxe is a well—known restaurant that
offers a takeout menu for students on the go.

For those students on a budget, there are
plenty of places to grab a cheap bite to eat.
Hemingway’s Cafe is a perfect example and

is visited by most students. La Fiesta—another
half-price stop—serves Mexican food in huge
portions. A personal pan pizza is just one of the
items that can be purchased from Fuel & Fuddle’s
ha|f—price menu. For those who would rather
have dessert, there is Dave & Andy’s, which
serves homemade ice cream in a waffle cone.
The ice cream is available in many different
flavors, including birthday cake.

Although Jazzman’s smoothies are truly
addictive and the Schenley Café has a Pizza
Hut, whenever Pitt students seek a deviation
from the norm, they can find any type of cuisine
in Oakland.

INNOVATION

he University of Pittsburgh, founded

in 1787, began in a little log cabin and

was known as the Pittsburgh Academy.

A replica of this cabin is now a promi-
nent historical site on the Oakland campus.
Since its founding, the University has acquired
several buildings that have become landmarks
not only to the University, but also to the world.

In 1937, Pitt expanded upward with the

dedication of the Cathedral of Learning.
The 535—foot building contains 2,529 windows
and is internationally known for the Nationality
Rooms located inside.

A year later, the University dedicated Heinz
Memorial Chapel. It was built with a gift from
the estate of Henry John Heinz in memory of
his mother. The nondenominational chapel
is known for its beautifully detailed stained—glass
windows and is a popular venue for weddings,
concerts, and special events.

Another landmark, the William Pitt Union, used

to be the Schenley Hotel, which in its day host-
ed famous figures like Woodrow Wilson and
Katharine Hepburn. The building is now home to
more than 300 student organizations and offices.

As old buildings are restored, new buildings
are rising across the Pitt landscape. The
University of Pittsburgh is a campus growing
up and out, but its beginnings will never
be forgotten.

ARRIVAL SURVIVAL

tthe end of August, there is a distinct

atmosphere at the University

of Pittsburgh. Roads are blocked off

throughout campus. Signs labeling
places such as the William Pitt Union are put up.
Blue and yellow carts are being pushed and
pulled by students and parents. Volunteers are
helping in every way possible. This bustle can
only mean one thing: Arrival Survival.

The Arrival Survival program was created to
ensure that moving in would be as pleasant,
seamless, and stress free as possible. The volun-
teers are trained to explain directions and offer
useful information. In 2005, volunteers distrib-
uted ice cream bars and water to students and
their families to relieve the tension of moving in.

24

Once everything is moved from the vehicle
to the dorm, the unpacking begins. However,
this task is usually put on hold as students
attend activities that are planned each year to
ease the transition into college. These activities
include Freshman Convocation, the Meet and
Greet Ice Cream Social, trolley tours of the city,
and the Orientation Aloha Luau. Ceremonial
events such as Lantern Night, as well as
Panther Prowl, are held annually.

Arrival Survival bridges the gap between home
and college for freshmen and returning students
alike. Through friendly service, organization,
and thorough planning, moving in becomes much
easier. As goodbyes are said and new friend-
ships are forged, Arrival Survival helps make
the first week of college easier.

raternities and sororities are an integral
part of the University of Pittsburgh's
community. Nearly 10 percent of students
are Greek members, many of whom are
involved in prominent campus organizations such
as the Student Government Board, Pitt Program
Council, and the Resident Student Association.

The Inter-Fraternity Council, National
Pan—He|lenic Council, and Pan-Hellenic Council
are the three Greek governing bodies. They
emphasize the importance of academics while
also coordinating community service activities
and promoting educational programming.

The 16 fraternities, 11 sororities, seven
African American fraternities, and one multicul-
tural fraternity that thrive on Pitt’s campus have
similar mission statements. For the brothers
of Tau Epsilon Phi, for example, that mission is
“to guide young college men toward productive
lives and to prepare them for community
responsibility by practicing Friendship, Chivalry
and Service.”

Annually, fraternity and sorority members
participate in Greek Week, which is composed
of events that allow the students in Greek
organizations to come together and have fun
while raising a great deal of money for a
worthwhile charity. The week culminates with
performances from each of the fraternities
and sororities. It is a huge event with a very
high attendance.

Fraternity and sorority members consistently
exceed the average GPA at the University of
Pittsburgh. This outstanding scholarship carries
them into the world outside Pitt. Brothers and
sisters of Pitt’s Greek organizations take with
them countless memories as well as valuable
communication and interpersonal skills.

it went from housing guests such as Woodrow
Wilson to housing student activities.

The William Pitt Union, frequently called
the Union, currently serves as a common
gathering place for students and houses
more than 300 student organizations and
services, including the Pitt News. Equipped with
a ballroom and a functional assembly room,
the Union holds events such as activity fairs
and blood drives.

The Union is also a place to get valuable infor-

information desk along with several e-mail kiosks
and bulletin boards displaying event details.
Students can also access information about
study abroad or career placement programs.

The Union is also home to Schenley Cafe.
Located on the lower level, this cafeteria allows
students to use their meal blocks to make “the
Sub Connection” or to enjoy a home—style meal.
Besides two dining areas where students can
eat and chat with friends, there are video
games, a television room, and a number of pool
tables for students to use in their down time.

With so much to offer in a central location,
the William Pitt Union is a sure stop for most
students. Whether students are eating, checking
e-mail, or participating in a campus activity,
the Union is a valuable center for student life,
resources, exploration, and culture.

SGB

ach year the Student Government Board
(SGB) faces the difficult task of address-
ing the needs, desires, and concerns
of the undergraduate population at the
University of Pittsburgh.
The board consists of eight members and
a president, as well as 10 student committees.
Seats on the board are filled by elections in the
fall. In 2005, Brian Kelly ended his second con-
secutive term as SGB president. New members
were sworn in and will serve one—year terms.

Together, these board members work to allocate

funds to student organizations. For example,

for the trip by SGB in 2005. Other groups were
also pleased with the amount of money they
were allocated in the fall. “We’re going to be
able to go to more tournaments,” said Lindsey
Bigelow, manager of the women’s volleyball club.

SGB is active not only in allocating funds,
but also in creating events for students. In the
fall of 2005, they arranged a benefit concert to
raise money for the victims of Hurricane Katrina.
Also, board member Liz Blasi implemented Pitt’s
first Light Up Night, an evening of culture and
celebration for student organizations that is held
close to winter break.
Students at the University of Pittsburgh

can rest assured that their best interests are
the number one priority of the Student
Government Board.

OUTINGS

he Pitt Outdoors Club is one club at the
University of Pittsburgh where adven-
ture is sure to happen. Established in

: the late 1960s, the club currently
offers opportunities for students to experience
and learn about the outdoors.

Panther Treks is one adventure that is offered
through the club. It is a wilderness orientation
program, started in 2003, that is offered to
incoming freshmen. Through this program
students get to experience it all, from backpack-
ing to whitewater rafting. In the past, those who
have participated in Panther Treks have gone
kayaking in Ohiopyle, Pa., and rock climbing
at Seneca Rocks, W.Va.

An on—campus event sponsored by the Pitt
Outdoors Club, which can be experienced by all,
is the Scottish Games. This event takes place
on the Cathedral lawn in the month of April.

On this day students can be seen doing the
hammer throw, the caber toss, or even the sheaf
toss. Area businesses donate prizes for the
winners of these particular events.

Another on—campus event takes place during
the fall term and is known as the Thursday Night
Games. Here students are invited to play
everyone’s childhood favorites, such as Capture
the Flag, Sharks and Minnows, and Red Rover,
on Thursday nights around 9 p.m., when classes
are over.

The Pitt Outdoors Club offers several other
activities, such as spring break trips to go
canoeing in the Everglades or hiking in
Shenandoah National Park. The possibilities
appear endless for those interested in hiking,
climbing, swimming, caving, and rafting.

FROM STUDENTS

ven while balancing their studies, social

lives, and jobs, many Pitt students find

time in their day to do volunteer work

on campus, in the Pittsburgh area, and
even across the United States. The Student
Volunteer Outreach (SVO) provides students with
a world of volunteering opportunities.

For extremely busy students, SVO offers one-
time service projects, most of which require an
afternoon or less. These projects include helping
to stock food banks and helping to clean up the
streets of Oakland.

Students who have more time on their hands
are able to volunteer in programs such as
Jumpstart Pittsburgh, a yearlong commitment
that allows Pitt students to tutor young children
in reading, literacy, social, and other important
skills. Each month SVO e—mai|s more than

which then provides them with a list of volunteer
opportunities and service projects in the
Pittsburgh area.

Another way that SVO allows Pitt students to get
involved is through the Alternative Break program.
Instead of going to the beach during spring
break, students in this program opt to volunteer
their time in other areas of the country, doing
community service projects such as building
homes in Appalachia and working with the
homeless in Washington, D.C. It is a unique
experience that gives students a chance to do
something meaningful during their spring break.

The Student Volunteer Outreach gives students
an opportunity to make a difference not only on
campus, but all across America.

MEANINGFUL

MEDIA

he fourth floor of the William Pitt Union

is the broadcasting hub of the entire

campus. This floor houses the offices

of The Pitt News, Pitt TV, WPTS FM, and
Panther Prints.

The Pitt News began producing copies in 1910.
Currently about 14,000 copies go into circulation
each day, keeping students up to date on news
and sports. A space is also provided for regular
columns and the ever-popular crossword puzzle.

For the remote control-savvy student, Pitt TV
is the perfect channel to watch. Broadcasting
movies and announcements, it helps keep
students both entertained and informed.

If it is music that is desired, WPTS 92.1 FM
has it. Pitt’s progressive, student-run radio
station strives to provide the ears of Pitt with
a different sound than they would normally hear
on commercial radio. Favoring independent
labels, the station offers an eclectic variety of
sounds while maintaining a college radio station
format. WPTS blends experimentation and pro-
fessionalism with success.

Panther Prints is an annual publication that
records many different aspects of life at Pitt and
is presented to graduating seniors at the end
of their spring term. Ultimately it serves as a way
to look back on the many scenes and memories
of the University of Pittsburgh.

All of these media are brought to students and
faculty through the hard work and dedication of
Pitt students. With the variety of media offered,
all students’ senses are sure to be satisfied.

Students playing 4-Square at the club's
first birthday celebration

he ubiquitous force behind the University

of Pittsburgh’s newest campus—wide

phenomenon is the childhood game

of 4—Square. Growing from a group of
10 students to more than 400, the club cele-
brated its first birthday on October 7, 2005.
Although 4-Square is a newer club, it has evolved
quickly into a dominant social force on campus,
hosting parties and meetings sponsored by Red
Bull and featuring DJs from WPTS 92.1. Meetings
and events take place in the Schenley Quadrangle
and in the concrete park area between Hillman
Library and Wesley W. Posvar Hall.

4-Square has built for itself a community of
students with a passion not only for the game,
but for interaction with other students. Founder
and President Justin Keogh emphasizes the idea
that 4-Square is a community. He believes that
participating in a physical activity that invokes

the joy of childhood, while engaging in social
relationships with other students, can have only
a positive effect on students’ lives.

Following the basic rules of the game (for which
you might have to think back to elementary school
to recollect), 4-Square is a competitive game
involving four regulation—sized squares blocked off
and numbered in a clockwise direction.

Absolutely no one is excluded from being
involved with 4-Square and often at Monday
night play-offs, people join in from right off of
the street. Keogh would like to see this kind of
attitude and passion extended throughout
Pittsburgh, and to other areas and schools
throughout the country.

LIFE RHYTHM

here is never a dull moment in Pittsburgh.

This is evident in the students at the

University of Pittsburgh and in the activi—

ties to which they devote themselves.
However, for the students involved in the Pitt
African Drumming Ensemble (PADE), the pulse
of life is felt through the magic of music.

The ensemble performs several times a year
on and around Pitt’s campus. One annual per-
formance is Black Nativity, which is performed
near the holiday season. Drums are combined
with other contemporary instruments, such as
the guitar, bass, and even trumpets, to open the
understanding of music and to have fun.

Dancers accompany the ensemble during
their performance of "Gahu"

The members of the ensemble all study African
drumming, which contributes to their abilities
to work on and assemble pieces together.

The members, like each instrument, are essential
to the unique rhythm the ensemble creates.

In turn, the club is an enriching activity to all
who participate and to those who have seen

it perform.

Business manager Sarah Nielsen envisions
a bright future for PADE: “We hope to be able
to perform a few gigs at local open mikes and
see where that takes us.” The group’s talent,
camaraderie, and love for what they do will likely
take them far.

Though the members don't give formal lessons,
they are always looking to expand both their
membership and their minds. The African
Drumming Ensemble is a rarity among student
organizations. It is a creative outlet that enriches
both the lives, and the rhythm, of all involved.

Student studying in his dorm room

BE IT EVER
SO HUMBLE

very night is the same, yet a little differ-

ent. The click—c|ack of computer keys

coming from partially closed doors is

constant and mixes with the sounds of
television sets, radios, and laughter. As the
night goes on, intermittent groans of exhaustion
betray the hard work that will keep some students
working into the early morning hours.

Combined with this constant hum of activity
are occasional baritone shouts and thumps from
guys tackling each other in the hallways during
frequent study breaks, which sometimes take up
more time than actual homework. Most free
moments become an excuse to reminisce about
childhood or to congregate for karaoke or Family
Guy parties. The sounds that spill out of crowded
rooms are childlike and carefree.

University of Pittsburgh

Outside the Towers lobby

Living in a dorm is like living in a perpetual
slumber party peppered with homework and
other school activities. Sleeping little and eating
whenever there is food, every student works
hard outside the classroom without forgetting to
enjoy life as well. Whether it means converting
the laundry room into a movie theater on a
Friday night orjoining friends to experiment with
microwave cooking when dorm food becomes
unbearable, enjoying life away from home is an
experience that quickly becomes interpersonal.

The sounds of dorm life are irreplaceable
and unique to each floor and residence hall.
As students grow and evolve throughout the
year, so does their lifestyle, creating a spectrum
of memories nothing else could reproduce.

OFF THE
BEATEN
PATH

hile they may not live on campus

or in the immediate area like thou-

sands of students, commuters are

an integral part of life at the
University of Pittsburgh. They typically arrive
early and spend a majority of their day on cam-
pus. They know the good parking spots, the bro-
ken meters, and how to avoid traffic. Best of all,
they get to go home and enjoy free laundry serv-
ice and a real home—cooked meal.

Although there are many who are a long way

from home, other students have grown up with
Pitt practically in their backyards. In fact,

The Port Authority Transit is one form of transportation
used to get to class by students living off campus

 

19 percent of students at the University are
from Allegheny County. They are given a unique
opportunity to attend the University without
leaving the comfort of their homes.

There are also students who have traveled far
and wide to attend the University of Pittsburgh
and have only spent a year or so living on
campus. When they become tired of community
showers and sharing a bedroom, they often look
into finding an apartment in the surrounding
area. The feeling of freedom that accompanies
having one’s own place is hard to match. Pitt’s
campus is still a walk or short bus ride away,
but there is finally a place to call home.

Commuters, apartment dwellers, and those
in the dorms each contribute to Pitt’s campus.
No matter where students may lay their heads
at night, they all call the University of Pittsburgh
home during the day.

or many students at the University

of Pittsburgh, Hillman Library becomes

a home away from home. The largest

of 17 libraries on Pitt's campus, it is
also the one most visited by students, whether
it is to do research, study, or socialize.

The library was named for J.H. Hillman Jr. and
was dedicated at the inauguration of Chancellor
Wesley W. Posvar in 1968. it provides capacity
for more than 1,500 people and holds 1.9 mil-
lion volumes within its five floors. All of these
sources can be located online through the

University's PlTTcat system, which can easily

devices in Hillman Library.

Hillman also contains many specialized depart-
ments to suit a researcher’s needs. These range
from the African American Collection to the
Gertrude and Philip Hoffman Judaic Collection.
Hillman also has a listening center, worldwide
periodicals, and a film/video collection.

Besides studying and research, many students
come to the library to meet up with friends.

The ground floor contains a number of comfort-
able chairs for lounging as well as a coffee
shop, Cup & Chaucer. The first floor is perhaps
the busiest. Here students push together tables
to form large study groups. The second, third,
and fourth floors are a bit quieter and are nice
for those needing a quiet reprieve.

Hillman Library is certainly a year—round hot
spot on the University's campus. Whether
students are sitting on the steps outside enjoying
lunch from one of the food vendors or studying
inside, Hillman is sure to be hopping.

WORKING
WONDERS

omework is not the only stress plaguing

the students of the University of

Pittsburgh. In fact, if asked, many
students would likely cite student loans and the
cost of school each semester as major stresses
on their daily lives. Due to the need for money,
many students have the added pressure of a job
on top of a full workload at school.

Although it seems time consuming, having a
job while attending college has many positive
effects. Since having a job is such a commit-
ment, the student has no choice but to acquire

time—management skills, a valuable postgradua-
tion asset. Also, working while in college can
look great on a résumé because it demonstrates
a strong work ethic and sense of responsibility.

Along with working in retail shops or restaurants,
many students have on-campus jobs and intern-
ships. One example of an on-campus job is the
Pitt Start Program, through which upperclassmen
spend time with up—and—coming freshmen to aid
them in all aspects of student life. In the end,
this program is rewarding to everyone involved.

Of course, there are several other areas in
which people work on campus, and all of them
can have positive effects on the students who
work as well as the people they help. Having a
job while being a full—time student can be a great
indicator of how students will perform once they
have a full—time career.

ENRICHMENT

 ver the years the Pitt Program Council
 ‘i has amazed students and faculty at
 the University of Pittsburgh. Through
l  » extensive planning, this student group
is able to offer events at little or no cost, with
just about every interest in mind.

 

One of the largest student organizations on
campus, the group regularly plans popular
activites each year. Events such as Fall Fest,
bonfires and pep rallies, and Bigelow Bash are
just a few programs that the Pitt Program
Council sponsors each year to bring students
together for some fun. In 2005, the program
council created a winter wonderland at the
University of Pittsburgh by setting up an ice

skating rink where students could skate for free.

University of Pittsburgh

At the end of each term, the program council
converts the William Pitt Union into a haven for
those looking to escape stress created by finals.
Oxygen bars are set up to give students a chance
to breathe easy and gain more energy. Students
can also get massages to relieve tension.

The organization also brings in guest speakers
such as Maya Angelou and entertainers like
hypnotist Ken Whitener, and provides students
with the chance to take low—budget trips to
Canada or exotic locations for spring break.

The Pitt Program Council’s goal is to enrich
the lives of students. Judging from the oppor-
tunities it has provided over the years,
its ambitions have been achieved.

ENGAGING EVENTS

n 1997, a fresh and innovative program
known as PITT ARTS was created to engage
students in the cultural world of Pittsburgh.
 Every year, PITT ARTS provides 30,000
students with 110 free excursions. Located
conveniently in the William Pitt Union, the
organization puts access to upcoming cultural
and artistic events at students’ fingertips.

Through the PITT ARTS program, students
receive free admission with their Panther Card
to many of Pittsburgh's fantastic facilities
such as the Andy Warhol Museum, Phipps
Conservatory and Botanical Gardens, the
Carnegie Museums of Art and Natural History,
and the Mattress Factory.

PITT ARTS also includes Cheap Seats,

a program that enables undergraduate students,
faculty, and staff to purchase discounted tickets
to performances by the Pittsburgh Symphony
Orchestra, Pittsburgh Ballet Theatre, Pittsburgh
CLO, and MCG Jazz, to name a few.

60

Not only does PITT ARTS put students in touch
with the city’s eclectic cultural life, it also serves
to bring art directly to the students. Throughout
the year, on—campus performances are held in
the Towers and William Pitt Union. Events range
from operas to informal dialogues, improvisa-
tional comedy sessions, and live concerts.

No matter what the venue or event, PITT ARTS
is a conduit through which students may connect
to the culturally vibrant life of Pittsburgh.

uring the coldest days of a Pittsburgh
winter or early spring, sometimes the
best option is to escape the city and
travel somewhere warm, sunny, and
sandy. Although students travel all over for the
few precious days of spring break, most escape
the snow and ice for more tropical weather.
The most popular locations are the beaches of
Florida and the beautiful Caribbean coast.

Months before the break, students are visiting
the gym, saving money, and planning their trips.
But for those who long for hassle-free fun,
the Pitt Program Council comes to the rescue.

TAKE A BREAK

Every year they put together packages that send
students to the destinations of their dreams
without emptying their wallets. These trips
include roundtrip airfare, hotel accommodations,
and the assurance of an enjoyable vacation.

Other students find that spending their week
off providing a service is just as rewarding as
a vacation. The Student Volunteer Outreach
program prepares alternative spring breaks,
where students travel all over the country to
better the lives of others. These projects
include everything from constructing homes in
low-income communities to working on Native
American reservations. Students also help
with several other causes that support the
country’s well being.

Whatever option a student chooses, returning
to campus is inevitable. However, after a week
off, most students are refreshed and ready to
finish the school year.

HIGHER LEARNING

ccupying the penthouse space on the
36th floor of the Cathedral of Learning
is the University of Pittsburgh’s
University Honors College (UHC).
The Honors College offers students who excelled
in high school an opportunity to take college
courses catered to their learning styles.

The office itself, which is named the Honors
Center, is lined with wooden bookcases and
features a staircase trimmed in brass. It offers
the best city view of any area on campus, as
well as a place for fellow honors students to
gather and discuss everything from classes

In 2003, Britain's Andrew, the Duke of York,
named the University a Marshall Center of
Excellence

66

and lectures to events sponsored by UHC, such
as Friday night movies.

Founded in 1986 to help stimulate the accel-
erated learning demonstrated by motivated
undergraduates, UHC emphasizes the fact that
it is not a membership organization, meaning that
there is no paper application to apply, with the
exception of the Bachelor of Philosophy degree.
Any student who feels intrigued by an honors
class can enroll by talking to his or her advisor.

In addition to the Bachelor of Philosophy
degree, the Honors College also offers a politics
and philosophy major, which involves the com-
pletion of a minimum of 51 credits in the areas
of political science, philosophy, and economics.

There are many other outside activities
planned by UHC, such as lectures and movie
nights, to add depth to one’s academic interests.
With a space on the top floor of the Cathedral,
UHC can really be considered an area of
“higher” learning.

THE REAL WORLD

he University of Pittsburgh offers many

unique learning opportunities. Among

these are the undergraduate internship

program offered by the Office of
Experiential Learning and internships through
specific academic departments.

The Institute of Politics (IOP) located in Alumni
Hall is just one of the departments at Pitt that
offers students a chance to gain undergraduate
internship credits. In connection with the political
science department, IOP offers up to 15 positions
a semester with elected officials at the federal,
state, or local level. There is a class that is taken
along with the internship, where students get to
meet other professionals in the fields of politics
and government as well as reflect on their experi-
ences in their assigned offices.

University of Pittsburgh

Students can also search for internships on their
own. PantherTRACS, a database available through
Career Services, is a great place to start.

During the summer of 2005, Kevin Newak,
an undergraduate at Pitt, worked for State Rep-
resentative Jim Wansacz. He worked in Wansacz’s
district office doing constituent services,
researching bills, and writing letters. Overall,
Newak said, ‘‘It was a great internship because
I got real world experience and learned things
about the state government that I wouldn't have
in a classroom setting.”

Internships provide hands—on learning, allowing
students to be involved and expand their academic
horizons. Undergraduate students can earn one
to three credits for participating in an approved
internship. Many students find that internships
are a great way to expand upon an area of study,
get involved, and even make a difference.

BOOK IT

he University Library System (ULS) is

used widely by students, faculty, staff,

administrators, and researchers at the

University of Pittsburgh. This system
consists of the 16 libraries located on the
Oakland campus and the libraries of the regional
campuses in Greensburg, Johnstown,
Titusville, and Bradford.

Barco Law Library and the Health Sciences
Library System, which are both located on the
Oakland campus, share an online system with
ULS. The Millstein Library and the Hanley Library
are not located on the Oakland campus, but are
affiliated with ULS.

The University Library System is a member
of five prestigious library associations: the
Association of Research Libraries, the Oakland
Library Consortium, the Center for Research
Libraries, the NorthEast Research Libraries
Consortium, and the Pennsylvania Academic
Library Consortium.

lt’s no wonder that ULS is able to be a part of
many associations. They set high standards for
providing students and faculty with a collection
that spans thousands of databases with over
5,500 electronic journals and 145,000 electronic
books. The system also contains more than
4 million volumes and more than 35,000
periodical subscriptions.

The large databases and quick speed are
essential to students and faculty conducting
library research. With virtually everything in the
library available in digital format, the research
process for students and faculty is easy. Instead
of having to search through the entire library,
one can quickly find an article and read it in the
comfort of one’s home or dorm.

TALKS

n addition to offering resources such as

The Writing Center and workshops for majors

and general students alike, the University

of Pittsburgh’s English department gives
students and the general public opportunities
to listen to some of their favorite authors speak
right here on campus.

The Pittsburgh Contemporary Writers Series
brings in famous novelists, playwrights, and
poets in order to give the public a chance to
hear their thoughts and hear them read from
new works or recite old favorites. in the past,
the series has featured Charles Baxter,
the author of numerous short stories and the
four novels Saul and Patsy, The Feast of Love,

 

Suzanne Greenberg, 2003 Drue Heinz
Literature Prize winner, also visited Pitt
as part of the series

Michael Ondaatje, author of
The English Patient

Shadow Play, and First Light; poet W.D. Snodgrass,
who is best known for the Pulitzer Prize winner
Heart's Needle; and Sandra Cisneros, who has
explored every genre from poetry to children’s
books, and whose works include The House on
Mango Street and Loose Woman.

The events are usually held in the Frick Fine
Arts Auditorium, which quickly becomes packed
with students, faculty, and fans. They all come to
get a chance to hear and speak with well-known
authors. The receptions that are held afterward
provide a comfortable atmosphere for literary
discussions and a unique opportunity to get
to meet and even chat with the author.

The Contemporary Writers Series is just one
of the many distinctive and exciting series of
events that are held on campus, for the benefit
of students and the community as well.

ON THE ROAD

ne great aspect of the University
of Pittsburgh is the opportunity for
students to study abroad in almost
any corner of the world. Students have
the option to choose programs through Pitt or
through a wall of other programs. Because there
are so many options, deciding which one is right
is extremely difficult.
Luckily, Pitt offers an entire office dedicated
to helping students throughout the study abroad
process. They offer peer advisers who have
experienced this incredible journey themselves
along with counselors to point students in the
right direction. Once the program is picked,
there is always someone in the office to assist
students in each step of the application process
and answer every question.

74

As the study abroad experience begins, it
becomes clear that all that effort was well worth
it. From Pitt in London to a semester in Costa
Rica, students become immersed in the fabulous
culture of their selected study location.

For many programs, students live with a family
and become a part of the culture they are there
to study. There are opportunities to travel, as
well as to meet other students studying abroad
from other colleges and universities in the
United States.

This unforgettable experience opens students’
eyes to many unimaginable adventures. When
students return to Pitt, they leave a part of
themselves behind, but they take their study
abroad memories with them forever.

CULTURE
BEYOND
CAMPUS

oday’s society demands a better

understanding of the many cultures

of the world. The University Center for

International Studies (UCIS) helps Pitt
students to learn about the countries and
people outside of the United States, through
programs such as study abroad, certificate
programs, and the International Studies Living
Learning Community.

During their college careers, the majority
of Pitt students will spend at least some time
completing a study abroad program. This program

allows students to live in another country while

still earning credits. Study abroad programs are

available all around the globe.

Other students will learn and experience culture
in the classroom through participation in certifi-
cate programs. Certificates center on under-
standing a particular area of the world. These
areas include Africa, Asia, Latin America, and
Europe. There is also a broader, global studies
certificate, which allows students to pick one
of six issues. They then study a region where
that issue applies and its language.

Students interested in international studies
can join the International Studies Living Learning
Community (ISLLC). ISLLC, located in Sutherland
Hall, holds biweekly forums covering various world
issues. ISLLC students also visit international
restaurants and festivals.

Whether students prefer to study in distant
countries or to take classes right here at Pitt,
there’s a program right for everyone.

OPPORTUNITIES

he University of Pittsburgh offers
extensive scholarship opportunities to
undergraduate students. in addition
to courses taught by world—renowned
faculty, Pitt students can avail themselves
of unique learning experiences outside of
the classroom.

The Office of Experiential Learning (OEL), part
of the School of Arts and Sciences, is in charge
of organizing these vast opportunities. Through
OEL, one can earn academic credit through
academic internships, research, service learning,
or undergraduate teaching experiences. The
hands—on approach given by these programs
is perfect for those who wish to apply all they
learn in the classroom to real world experiences.
They can also be used as a guide to finding
the right career.

Many of the programs offered, such as under-
graduate teaching, also help to develop more
efficient methods, attitudes, and behaviors for

78

studying. They not only benefit undergraduates
in need of assistance but the peers they teach
as well. For those who would rather do research
or who are in pursuit of experiential learning,
the office generously offers small grants to help
offset costs.

The Brackenridge Undergraduate Summer
Research Fellowship is another wonderful
opportunity. It allows students to investigate,
research, and create original projects. It is run
by the University Honors College, and consists
of a select group of students with impressive
academic records who possess great aspiration
and motivation.

All of these programs are available to those
who desire a more interactive education to
enrich their college experience as much as
possible. Students who have participated have
received a form of education beyond what is
learned in the classroom.

INSPIRED

DEDICATION

he University of Pittsburgh has always

produced great football athletes. Pros

such as Dan Marino, Mike Ditka,

and Tony Dorsett are all Pitt alumni
and inspire current student athletes.

Having such alumni sets high standards,
but current and recent Pitt athletes have pro-
duced more than a few unforgettable moments
as well. In 2002, the Panthers, led by Rod
Rutherford and Larry Fitzgerald, finished their
season ranked in the top 20 and routed Oregon
State, 38-13, in the Insight Bowl to finish 9-4.

Fitzgerald took center stage in 2003 by com-
ing in second in the voting for the Heisman
Trophy, and by catching 92 passes and scoring
22 touchdowns for the season. The team
appeared in the Continental Tire Bowl, but lost
to Virginia, 23-16.

Tyler Palko led the team to a share of the
Big East title in 2004 and a Bowl Championship
Series appearance against undefeated Utah
in the Fiesta Bowl. The Panthers fell, 35-7, to
the Utes.

in January 2005, Dave Wannstedt, a former
NFL head coach and Pitt football player, took over
as head coach of the Panthers. He immediately
gained a reputation as an outstanding recruiter
with the football class of 2006 being ranked
in the top 10 by some national experts. The
2004-05 Panthers, led by Palko, Greg Lee, and
H.B. Blades, finished with an 8-4 record, but
showed promise for the season to come.

The players of the Pittsburgh Panthers football

team appear to become more dedicated as

the years go on. Maybe their experiences don't
compare to those of Ditka or Dorsett or Marino
as of yet, but their commitment and skill

will always be remembered by their fans and
fellow students.

volume increases, the beat of the

It is no wonder that men’s basketball evokes
such a response at Pitt. In March 2005, the
team broke a school record by earning a fourth-
consecutive appearance at the NCAA tournament.
They finished the 2004-05 season with 22 wins,
including a thrilling victory against fourth-ranked
Syracuse along the way.

Coach Jamie Dixon, named 2004 Big East
Coach of the Year, had quite an impressive
roster with which to work. Carl Krauser, Chris
Taft, and Chevon Troutman were just a few of
the outstanding players that led the team to a
winning season. The end of the 2004-05 season
marked the end of several players’ college
basketball careers. It also marked the beginning
of a professional career as Taft entered the
2005 NBA draft and was picked up by the
Golden State Warriors shortly thereafter.

The most difficult tickets to acquire for a Pitt
sports team are for men’s basketball. It will likely
stay this way as long as the Panthers continue
their ongoing string of big win seasons. Here’s
to another season of nothing but net.

University of Pittsburgh men’s and

women’s soccer teams have
earned honors and awards that are well known
around campus.

In 2003, 86 University of Pittsburgh athletes
were named to the Big East Academic All—Star
team. Five of these honorees were from the

The men’s players aren’t the only ones receiv-

Joe Luxbacher was inducted into the Western
Chapter of the Pennsylvania Sports Hall of Fame
in March 2005. He is also the founder and
director of the Shoot—to—Score Soccer Academy.

In 2002, the Pitt News named women’s
soccer player Jamie Pelusi the Freshman Female
Athlete of the Year. In 2003, Carli Brill was
named the freshman athlete of the fall semester,
and for the 2005 season, nine of 11 starters
returned. Strong players such as Erin Hills,
Corina Sebesta, and Meta Haley support the
defensive line, a major aspect of the team's
playing strategy. Key team members Jacqueline
Reuter and Stephanie Davis also returned for
the 2005 season.

The women’s coach, Sue-Moy Chin, has
plenty of coaching experience at schools such
as Duke and Notre Dame. She was named head
coach of the Panthers in 2003 and looks fon/vard
to getting the team to the top of the
Big East Conference.

TO VICTORY

n Fitzgerald Field House, there is one team
that spikes, digs, and volleys harder than
any other—the Pittsburgh Panthers women's
volleyball team. Under a top coaching staff
led by Chris Beerman, the team has made a
tremendous turnaround in five years.

In 2003, the Panthers (26-6) captured their
11th Big East championship title, earning an
appearance in the NCAA tournament for the first
time in nine years. Pitt advanced to the second
round, dropping a 3-1 decision to Penn State.

Many team members and Beerman received
recognition for these efforts. In December 2003,
Beerman was named the Big East Co—Coach of
the Year. Standout players Wendy Hatlestad,
Megan Miller, and Megan McGrane all received
the American Volleyball Coaches Association
(AVCA) All-Northeast Region Honors. McGrane
made the AVCA All—Northeast Region team.

In the 2004 season, the team finished
with a record of 8-2 in the conference, which

Diana Andreyko was named Big East Rookie

McGrane led the team on and off the court in
2005, earning a second straight AVCA Al|—America

17-13 and are looking fonivard to even better

SWIMMERS

t 5:30 on most weekday mornings,
the majority of students are still fast
asleep. However, this early hour
marks the start of the first practice
of the day for the University of Pittsburgh men’s
and women’s swimming and diving teams.
These student-athletes practice twice a day,
Monday through Saturday, spending about
20 hours a week in the pool in Trees Hall.
However, the team’s accomplishments prove
that all the hard work has been worth it.
During the past three years, the women’s team
has moved up from fifth to second place in the
Big East championship. This outstanding team

Twisting and turning and hoping for a 10

has broken almost every record previously post-
ed by the University. The men’s team has won
two Big East championships and has been

ranked 17th in the nation for two years running.

In addition to all of their athletic accomplish-
ments, the teams make time for schoolwork.
The women’s team has the highest GPA of any
athletic team at Pitt, and their collective GPA
is the highest in the nation for any Division I
athletic team. Likewise, the men’s team boasts
the highest GPA for any men’s varsity team on
campus, and both teams have been named

Academic Al|—Americans for three years in a row.

Dedication is evident in both the men’s and
women’s teams. Boasting achievement both
in the pool and in the classroom, the swimming
and diving teams exemplify the role of the
student-athlete.

AND STRENGTH

or the past four years, the University
of Pittsburgh’s gymnastics team has
accomplished several individual and
team achievements.

In the 2003-04 season, the team beat its
toughest rival, earning its first win against
Penn State in more than 20 years. Even more
amazing was the 2004 performance of Alyse
Zeffiro, who scored two perfect 10s——the first in
Pitt history—on vault and floor. Other achieve-
ments include the qualification of Leila Tait to
the NCAA Women’s Gymnastics Championships

Kaitlin Harrison performing a floor routine

University of Pittsburgh

during the 2004-05 season. Her score at

nationals, along with other exceptional team per-V

formances, placed the team in good standing in
the NCAA regional championships.

Rounding up her 20th year as head coach

is Debbie Yohman. Assistant Coach Mike Rowe
joined the team in 2005. Rowe has sent
more gymnasts to the Junior Olympic National
Championships than any other person and

is expected to bring great things for Pitt's
gymnasts for many years to come.

Also new to the team is the gymnasium

in Trees Hall, which is used for practice and
tournaments. Although the team will never
forget “the cage” where they once practiced,
Yohman says the new gym is “invaluable
beyond belief.”

The members of the gymnastics team at Pitt

are highly committed to their sport. They put

in 20 or more hours a week during their season
and even put time in during the off season.
Each individual knows that her personal dedica-
tion is what creates the award—winning team.

REMEMBERING

PITT

he festivities for Remembering Pitt:
Homecoming 2005 began October 20
and concluded October 23. It was an
event—fil|ed weekend for alumni and
students, including an elaborate fireworks and
laser show, career networking, reunions, and,
of course, the homecoming football game,
this year against Syracuse University.

For the students who ran for homecoming king
and queen, campaigning began more than a
week before the football game. They chalked
sidewalks, put up flyers, passed out candy,
and even held eating contests to win students’
votes. Clever slogans like “Eat your pasta and
vote for Natasha” and “Go nuts for Peanut”

could be found across campus and even on
bedsheets hanging out of windows in the Quad
and in Bouquet Gardens.

The homecoming court was announced at the
fireworks show on Friday, October 21. Following
the show, the Homecoming Extravaganza took
place in the William Pitt Union. This event featured
performers, a Dance Dance Revolution game,
and other video games.

The following day, the Panthers took on
Syracuse, and Dilinus Harris and Brittany Taylor
were crowned the new king and queen during
halftime. School spirit was high and cheers
from both students and alumni resounded
throughout Heinz Field.

Wrapping up the homecoming festivities was a
cruise on the Gateway Clipper on Saturday night.
An evening of dancing, celebrating, and socializing
with friends was an excellent conclusion to the
weekend’s events.

OUT ON THE TOWN

ttending college is not only about full
course loads, hours of homework, and
absorbing the never—ending supply of

knowledge. It is also about having fun.

Pittsburgh is a fantastic city that has much to
offer students who are looking to relax and let
loose when they are not studying.

Some popular places that students from the
University of Pittsburgh enjoy around the city
include the Waterfront, Station Square, the Strip
District, Shadyside, and the South Side. These
locations offer many opportunities for shopping
and dining. Some locations, such as the Strip
District and Station Square, are known for their
nightclubs and bars, like Matrix and Bar Louie.
Shadyside offers a more upscale atmosphere
for dinner and drinks, with places such as the
Elbow Room and Shady Grove.

University of Pittsburgh

However, when students do not want to travel
far for a good time, there are also plenty of
options right in Oakland. The hot spots are
located along Forbes Avenue, near the center
of campus. Every night of the week, Hemingway's
Cafe is filled with Pitt students enjoying the

famous half—off menu with friends and classmates.

Another legendary place is the Original Hot Dog
Shop, more famously known as “The O,” with
its extraordinary “O” fries. Other enjoyable
nightspots are Fuel & Fuddle and Joe Mama’s
Italian Deluxe.

Of course, some students prefer more
intimate gatherings at apartments and dorms
with close friends. But no matter how busy
students are, time can always be made for
friends and fun in the city of Pittsburgh.

lasted for three hours, and featured dishes
ranging from pad thai at the Thai Place Café

to coconut rice at the Spice Cafe.

Students could also attend information sessions
for Habitat for Humanity, the Peace Corps, and
study abroad programs. These sessions helped
keep students informed about opportunities
around the world. Other international activities
offered during the week included salsa dance
lessons, Irish and Celtic storytelling, and several
lectures and seminars centered on global issues.
Many international clubs at the University
also made an appearance, ready to recruit any
interested students.

Near the end of International Week was the
International Fair, which condensed a whole
week’s worth of activities into a series of
tables offering food, drinks, and information.
Most information sessions and cultural demon-
strations had tables set up throughout the fair.
This event was an excellent way to end a week
filled with exciting cultural activities, lectures,

PASSION
FOR JAZZ

n November 5, 2005, the 35th Annual

University of Pittsburgh Jazz Seminar

& Concert took place at Carnegie

Music Hall. This year’s performances
included many great musical artists, including
Nicholas Payton, Nestor Torres, Renee Rosnes,
and ldris Muhammad.

The Pittsburgh Jazz Seminar was established
in 1970. Since then, it has developed into an
annual event enjoyed by many. It was founded
by Nathan Davis, the director ofjazz studies in
the Department of Music.

The seminar is marked by a week of free
lectures and information sessions that are held
on and around Pitt's campus. The week's events
conclude with a concert.

The Pittsburgh Jazz Seminar & Concert is not
the only time or place where one can experience
jazz at Pitt. The William Pitt Union houses the
International Academy of Jazz Hall of Fame.
Here great artists such as Ella Fitzgerald and
Miles Davis are featured, and artifacts from
famous musicians, plaques, and various instru-
ments are displayed.

Another collection ofjazz, the Sonny Rollins
International Jazz Archives, is housed in Hillman
Library. Here original manuscripts, instruments,
and other items donated by musicians are kept.
Visitors can also review visual and audio record-
ings of past jazz seminars held at the University.

The Jazz Seminar has had a great impact on
the University’s campus as well as on the city
of Pittsburgh. As interest remains strong, it is
sure to continue to be a prominent annual event.

THE WRITE STUFF

untu Repertory Theatre, Pittsburgh's

oldest African American performing

arts group and part of the Department

of Africana Studies, is a voice for the
African American playwright.

Founded in 1974 by Vernell A. Lillie, an asso-
ciate professor at the University, to showcase
the works of Rob Penny, Kuntu has produced
more than 80 performances by such writers
as James Baldwin, Langston Hughes, and
August Wilson. For more than 30 years, these
performances have brought African American cul-
ture to
life through song, ritual, dance, and tradition.

During the 2005-06 season, Kuntu performed
five shows, one of which—MahaIia Jackson:
Standing on Holy Ground——is about the life
of the famed gospel singer and was written
by Lillie. Other season performances include
Little Willie Armstong Jones, Steal Away, Sing

University of Pittsburgh

Black Hammer, and Wilson's Seven Guitars.

In addition to its main stage productions, the
company also conducts community workshops,
which have traveled far outside of the immediate
community to New York, South Carolina, and
South Africa. These workshops focus on psy-
chodrama, theater, music, and dance.

Kuntu also takes its productions on the road
10-12 times annually, performing at colleges,
community centers, and prisons, “to stimulate
creative thinking, promote creativity and conver-
sation, and to enhance the quality of life for
the community.”

Whether performing at the University or in the
community, Kuntu Repertory Theatre is a cultural
and artistic treasure.

t the corner of Thackeray Street and

Fifth Avenue, delicious scents of

spices waft through the air. Instantly,

one’s mouth begins to water, and the
only thing that can hit the spot is a few feet
away——truck food.

Truck vendors line the side of Thackeray Street,
serving tasty ethnic food that ranges from Thai
to Greek. No matter what one is craving, the
friendly vendors provide speedy service with
a smile. A cultural hot spot in its own right,
this corner in Oakland is the only place one
can find such a variety of foods in such close

Food vendors on Thackeray Street

University of Pittsburgh

Students shop for Pitt gear at the Pitt Stop

proximity. The vendors insist on large portions
at inexpensive prices, and that keeps customers
coming back for more.

Once students’ appetites are satisfied, they
can head to the William Pitt Union where other
vendors often set up stands selling tapestries,
jewelry, and posters. When the weather is cold,
mittens and scarves can be purchased as well.

Located on the corner of Forbes Avenue and
Bigelow Boulevard, the Pitt Stop has been
supplying fans with Pitt gear at reasonable prices
for years. Charles “Chaz” Bonasorte, the owner,
can often surprise prospective students on
campus tours with a free t—shirt or two if they
answer a Pitt trivia question correctly. Rain,
sleet, or snow—the Pitt Stop weathers it all.

Whether it is culture, inexpensive Pitt clothing,
or some exotic food that one is seeking, the
vendors in Oakland can surely accommodate
any desire.

WINTER

 

WONDERLAND

he sing|e—digit temperatures and inches
of snow can make the winter months
dreary. Pedestrians are no longer people,
but mysterious forms covered head to
toe in scarves, hats, and big, fluffy coats. Classes
seem a million miles away and it becomes more
tempting to stay indoors, wrapped in a blanket,
watching a movie. Months pass by, and it seems
like winter will never end.
Fortunately for University of Pittsburgh students,
there are plenty of options to take the bite out
of the air. At the end of November, the city holds
its annual Light Up Night. Many students head

Students take turns snow tubing ouside
the Cathedral

downtown to PPG Place to celebrate the begin-
ning of the winter season with the rest of the
city as a giant Christmas tree is lit. One can
sip hot cocoa and watch the fireworks over
Point State Park, or ice skate around the tree
and absorb the atmosphere of an outdoor rink
in the heart of the city.

Other practices significant to student life are
snowball fights on the Cathedral lawn, sledding
down the hill in front of Sutherland Hall, week-
end ski trips to Seven Springs, and ice skating
at the Schenley Park rink.

Although winter at Pitt forces us all to walk a
little faster to class, there are also ways to have
a lot of fun. Despite what the very low number
on the thermometer might read, students are
sure to take advantage of all that winter at Pitt
has to offer.

SIDELINE SUPPORT

—l—T——T; P—l—T-T; P—l-T—T; Let’s go

Pitt!” is a cheer that every University

of Pittsburgh Panthers fan knows well.

It is one that is initiated by the Pitt
cheerleaders and marching band to get fans
in the spirit of the game, and more importantly
signifies when points are about to be scored.
During football and basketball games, the band,
cheerleaders, and Pitt dance team provide both
entertainment and spirit, cheering the Panthers
to victory.

Although they are not traditional sports teams,
the marching band, cheerleaders, and dance
team earn their varsity status through rigorous
practice schedules and performances on game
day. The cheerleading squad has consistently
finished in the top 10 at the National Collegiate
Cheerleading Championships, and the dance
team has placed in the top 10 in its last six
competitions and has been a finalist at the
National Collegiate Dance Championships.

University of Pittsburgh Varsity Marching Band

The cheerleaders, band, and dance team
are leaders in the community as well as on
the field. From playing and dancing at benefits
to organizing food and clothing drives, these
groups lead more than fans at a game.

With their flashy uniforms and their strong
school spirit, it is hard to miss any of them at
the games. They serve not only to excite the
crowds, but as motivation for the teams as well.
Whether they are playing ‘‘Hail to Pitt” at the
beginning of the game, cheering from the side-
lines, or playing and cheering to “Victory” at
the end, the band, cheerleaders, and dance
team inspire players and fans alike.

DOWN TIME

or students at the University of Pittsburgh,

time is not completely consumed by

the art of being a student. Amazingly

enough, there is time to sit back and
relax during the course of a semester. For any
student, free time can be used in a number
of ways.

For those who prefer a productive route,
one might covet a cubicle in Hillman Library to
catch up on work. Free time may also be the
perfect opportunity to lug that overflowing
laundry basket to the laundry room and fill the
drawers with clean clothes once more.

Students who prefer to save their dirty laundry
for the last possible moment might instead grab
a group of friends and lay out on the lawn

114

 

Students playing ping pong in the Union

of the Cathedral of Learning, to catch the last
bit of sunshine before the long Pittsburgh winter.
A few hours of down time can also be spent
getting off campus to do some shopping, go out
to eat, or catch a movie.

Many students enjoy simpler things, such as
watching a movie with friends or ordering in to
save the trouble of finding food to eat. Another
option is using free time for a nice, long, and
much-needed nap.

Students’ lives can easily become dictated

by exams, classes, their professors’ office hours,
and meetings for extracurricular activities. Pitt
students, however, never take advantage of their
free time, and always find some way to spend

it wisely.

LETTER

ongratulations, Class of 2006! Only

four short years ago we came to the

University of Pittsburgh as freshmen.

It is amazing how much we have
changed in such a short period of time. i hope
that your years as an undergraduate at Pitt have
been your best yet and that Pitt has provided
you with the tools to make the years to come
even better.

Over the past few years you probably have
heard the phrase "the city is our campus."
For many of us, the neighborhoods around
Pittsburgh have become our second home.
if this is the case, then this has been a year
filled with home improvements, including two
new residence halls, a biomedical tower, and
a beautiful park.

Student Government Board (SGB) made
strides in enriching student life with projects
such as Light Up Night, Panther Pride Campus
Wide, and a benefit concert for Hurricane
Katrina relief. However, the main goal of SGB
is to promote the interests, needs, and welfare
of undergraduate students. I am proud that this
goal has been accomplished, as seen in the
pages of this book.

I feel privileged to have worked with such a
motivated group of students, staff, and adminis-
trators through SGB. If our accomplishments
are indicative of the future, then I am extremely
excited for the years ahead.

This is an exciting time in our lives. No matter
what adventures await you outside of this
University, I hope you will look back on your
memories of Pitt and feel proud to be a Panther.
Graduation is a major milestone, and you
should be congratulated for completing an
education at one of the top public universities
in the country.

Hail to Pitt!
